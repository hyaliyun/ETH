Haute of Wadenhall  The de Haute family were established at Wadenhall from the 13th century, when Sir William de Haute (died c. 1302) held office as lay steward to Christchurch Priory, Canterbury.

It exerts its effect as a selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist, and has an effectiveness similar to cetirizine, fexofenadine, and desloratadine. It was developed in Spain by FAES Farma. Bilastine is approved in the European Union for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria, but it is not approved for any use in the United States.Bilastine Approval Status, drugs.com Bilastine meets the current European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) and Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact of Asthma (ARIA) criteria for medication used in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Bilastine has been effective in the treatment of diseases of allergies, including rhinoconjuctivitis. Additionally, bilastine has been shown to improve quality of life, and all nasal and eye symptoms related to allergic rhinitis. Medical uses Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis The clinical efficacy of bilastine in allergic rhinitis (AR) and urticaria has been assessed in 10 clinical assays in which over 4,600 patients were involved. All of them compared bilastine with placebo and another second generation antihistamine with confirmed efficacy (active comparator). Allergic rhinitis The studies on SAR were double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group involving male and female patients over 12 year of age with symptomatic disease at the beginning of the study. Nasal symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching and congestion) were assessed both before treatment and during treatment period on a daily basis. Non nasal symptoms (itchy eye, watery eye, itchy ear and palate) were also assessed according to a 0‚Äì3 scale, so that the Total Symptoms Score (TSS) and other related parameters could clearly reflect daily evolution of SAR in each patient and treatment group. Parameters such as quality of life and discomfort were also assessed, and in the same way the type and frequency of AE, tolerability and general safety of treatment were registered. In this SAR studies the daily oral administration during 14 days of bilastine proves to have the same efficacy as the administration of cetirizine and desloratadine. Urticaria A review article evaluated data from trials which detailed the efficacy of bilastine in skin models and urticaria to assess whether bilastine has an optimal profile for updosing in urticaria. The authors concluded that bilastine has an excellent profile for both efficacy and safety, although there is a need for controlled clinical trials to compare the efficacy of bilastine in a real-life updosing study in patients with urticaria, paying special attention to itch control. Dosage It is taken by mouth and shows a rapid onset of action (within 30‚Äì60 minutes). It should be taken only by children older than 12 years and adults. Side effects Toxicity of bilastine investigated in preclinical toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs after oral and intravenous administration showed no mortality observed after oral administration of massive doses. After intravenous administration, LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of animals) values were 33 and 45‚Äì75 mg/kg in mice and rats, respectively. No signs of toxicity were observed in any organ after bilastine massive overdosing, either orally (in mice, rats and dogs), or intravenously (in rats and dogs) during 4 weeks. No effects on fertility, no teratogenic or mutagenic effects, and no apparent carcinogenic potential were seen in the studies carried out in rats, mice and rabbits. In clinical research, bilastine has proven to be well tolerated, with an adverse events profile similar to that of placebo in healthy volunteers, patients with AR and with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Although the tolerance profile of bilastine and levocetirizine or desloratadine were very similar, bilastine was markedly better tolerated than cetirizine in a clinical assay in SAR, with fewer adverse events in the bilastine group. No anticholinergic adverse events were observed in the clinical trials with bilastine. No serious adverse events were reported during the research and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG) or laboratory tests. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and studies in special populations indicate that dose adjustment of bilastine is not necessary in elderly patients or in chronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease. Cardiac safety The clinical cardiac safety of bilastine has been assessed in all of the clinical trials performed so far (more than 3,500 patients treated with bilastine) and in a phase I study (Thorough QT/QTc study) designed according to the ICH E14 guidance and the most demanding requirements from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When electrocardiograms (ECG) data from all of the phase I studies are analysed, no significant alteration is appreciated in any of the parameters after administering bilastine at single doses (up to 11 times the therapeutic dose), nor at multiple doses (up to 10 times the therapeutic dose). Phase II and III studies on AR and urticaria (including the open-label extension phase of 12 months) do not reveal alterations in the ECG, nor significant prolongations of the QTc interval after administration of bilastine 20 mg. The Thorough QT/QTc study was designed to assess the effect on the QT/QTc interval, both of the therapeutic dose (20 mg) and 100 mg of bilastine, but also the coadministration of the therapeutic dose with usual doses of ketoconazol (400 mg/day), a metabolism inhibitor and a P-gP dependent transport system. It was verified that bilastine 20 and 100 mg administered during 4 days, does not induce significant changes in the QT/QTc interval duration in any of the individuals. Likewise, coadministration of bilastine 20 mg and ketoconazol 400 mg does not produce any significant prolongation of the QT/QTc interval attributable to bilastine. Interactions Preclinical data suggest the possibility of interactions between bilastine and drugs or food that are inhibitors or inducers of the P-glycoproteins. Coadministration of bilastine and grapefruit juice (a known P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport activator) significantly reduced bilastine systemic exposure. This interaction is due to the known effect of grapefruit flavonoids on intestinal transporter systems such as P-glycoproteins and organic anion transporting peptide (OATP). Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Bilastine binds to guinea-pig cerebellar histamine H1-receptors (Ki=44 nM) and to human recombinant histamine H1-receptors (Ki=64 nM) with an affinity comparable to that of astemizole and diphenhydramine, and superior than that of cetirizine by three- fold and fexofenadine by five-fold (Corc√≥stegui). In different murine models, bilastine by oral route, antagonizes the effects of histamine in a dose- dependent manner, with potency similar to that of cetirizine and between 5.5 and 10 times greater than that of fexofenadine. Preclinical investigations demonstrate the affinity and specificity of bilastine for histamine H1-receptors compared with other histamine receptors subtypes and other 30 receptors from different amines. In vivo experimentation confirmed the antihistaminic and antiallergic activity, which was at least comparable to that of other second-generation H1-antihistamines such as cetirizine. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bilastine is most quickly absorbed with the absence of food, and reaches a mean peak plasma concentration of 220 ng/mL approximately 1 h after both single and multiple dosing. Absorption is reduced by a high-fat breakfast or fruit juice, and the estimated global oral bioavailability is approximately 60%. Bilastine has linear pharmacokinetics in the 2.5‚Äì220 mg dose range in healthy adult subjects without evidence of accumulation after 14 days of treatment. Distribution Bilastine distribution has an apparent volume of distribution of 1.29 L/kg, and has an elimination half-life of 14.5 h and plasma protein binding of 84‚Äì90%. Metabolism Bilastine is not significantly metabolized in humans and is largely eliminated unchanged both in urine and feces ‚Äì a third and two thirds of the administered dose, respectively, according to a Phase I mass-balance study with radiolabeled bilastine. Bilastine does not readily cross the blood brain barrier and is not metabolized by the liver. Ninety six percent of the administered dose is eliminated within 24 hours. In relation to its antihistamine effect, oral doses of 20 mg daily of bilastine, measured as skin wheal-and-flare surface areas for 24 h, bilastine is capable of inhibiting 50% of the surface areas ‚Äì throughout the whole administration interval. Chemistry Bilastine, or 2-[4-[2-[4-[1-(2-ethoxyethyl) benzimidazol-2-yl] piperidin-1-yl] ethyl] phenyl]-2-methylpropionic acid, is a novel molecule with a molecular weight of 463.6 daltons and a chemical structure similar to piperidinyl-benzimidazole. Bilastine can be therefore classified into the same chemical group as many of the new antihistamines on the market, although it is not structurally derived, nor is it a metabolite or enantiomer of any of them, but an original molecule designed with the intent of fulfilling all the requirements of a second-generation antihistamine. Research Clinical studies using different dosages were done on histamine-induced wheal and flare reaction over a 24-h period, compared with a single 10-mg oral dose of cetirizine. The results of this research indicated that bilastine was at least as efficient as cetirizine in reducing histamine-mediated effects in healthy volunteers. Remarkably, 20 and 50 mg of bilastine reduced the wheal and flare reaction significantly more quickly than cetirizine.

In the course of over six decades, the Wine Circle hosted many of the reference-point estates from the wine world. While the Wine Circle was a sociable group, the emphasis at meetings was on the wines themselves: as a former President, Tom Bromwich, noted: \\"It's certainly not pretentious ‚Äì most people, including me, have always liked wine and just want to know more about it.\\" Along with members of the more recently established Oxford University Wine Society and the Oxford Blind Tasting Society,OBT members of the society often participated in blind tasting competitions.

Notable former members include Jeremy Seysses of Domaine Dujac, Arabella Woodrow MW, Jasper Morris MW and Alex Hunt MW. Until the mid-2000s, the OUWC ran the Oxford blind tasting training and oversaw team selection for the Varsity Match, and there are numerous wine professionals who discovered their love and talent for tasting wine while preparing to compete against Cambridge such as: Oz Clarke and Charles Metcalfe.

Parker is widely known as the artist of MTV's Beavis and Butt-Head comic book, published by Marvel from 1994 to 1996. He wrote and illustrated his own graphic novel, Deadboy, in 2010.  Early life Parker grew up in Savannah, Georgia. He did not own many comic books as a child ‚Äî instead, his artistic influences include Little Golden Books and the comic strips Mutt and Jeff and Little Orphan Annie. (He also lists Will Elder, Wally Wood, Carl Barks, Harvey Kurtzman, Roy Crane, and Jack Davis as influences.) Parker earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of Georgia, and his Master of Fine Arts at the Pratt Institute. Military service In February 1966 Parker was drafted into the United States Army, completing basic training at Fort Stewart, GA and becoming a tank driver. Parker applied for Officer Candidate School and completed Advanced Infantry Training at Fort Jackson, SC, subsequently completing Officer Candidate School at Fort Sill. After becoming an officer, Parker was involved in the testing of Pershing Missiles in the deserts of New Mexico and Utah. He was also an acting Battery Commander at Fort Sill and briefly was the Officer-in-Charge of military funerals for Northern Texas, Oklahoma and Western Arkansas. Career  Comics  Parker got his start in the comics industry as a letterer for Marvel Comics, starting in the late 1970s. Spider-Man editor Jim Salicrup recalled, \\"Not only did I like having him letter all the titles just so I can pretend to be J. Jonah Jameson and scream 'Parker!' at him all the time, but he lived not far from me at the time, and quite often I would visit his home and hang out with him while he lettered pages, and then we'd drop 'em off at the FedEx office together. This easily saved days on the schedule, and got the books done much faster.\\" Parker was one of the four original artists of The Pekar Project (SMITH Magazine, 2009‚Äì2010), which brought the writing of the American autobiographical comics pioneer Harvey Pekar to the web. He also drew the introductory pages of Tales from the Crypt for Papercutz from 2007 to 2009. Parker has illustrated a series of graphic novel parodies (written by Stefan Petrucha) for Papercutz Slices (Papercutz) ‚Äî titles include Diary of a Stinky Dead Kid (2009), Harry Potty and The Deathly Boring (2010), Breaking Down (2011) (a parody of the Twilight series), Percy Jerkson and The Ovolactovegetarians (2011), and The Hunger Pains (2012).  Fine art  Parker's fine art consists of paintings, drawings, collage, assemblages, sculpture, lithographs, photographs, performance, and conceptual art. He was the founder of the Barking Dog Museum in New York City (1975‚Äì1987). His artwork has been shown at the Hundred Acres Gallery in New York, the NYU Art Gallery, The Georgia Museum of Art, the Pratt Institute Art Gallery, Franklin Furnace Book Archives, the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art, and the DUMBO Arts Center.

In Oostendorp et al. eds., The Blackwell Companion to Phonology. Modally voiced nasal clicks are ubiquitous: They are found in every language which has clicks as part of its regular sound inventory. This includes Damin, which has only nasal clicks, and Dahalo, which has only plain and glottalized nasal clicks. They are fully nasalized throughout, like the pulmonic nasal and . That is, you pronounce a uvular sound (like English ng) with the back of your tongue, and make the click sound in the middle of it using the front of your tongue. They are typically transcribed something like ; in Khoekhoe, they are written , in Ju«Ä ºh√µa as , and in Zulu, Xhosa, Sandawe, and Naro as . Aspirated nasal clicks, often described as voiceless nasal with delayed aspiration, are widespread in southern Africa, being found in all languages of the Khoe, Tuu, and Kx'a language families, though they are unattested elsewhere. They are typically transcribed something like ; in Khoekhoe, they are written , and in Ju«Ä ºh√µa as . Initially and in citation form, words with these consonants are pronounced with voiceless nasal airflow throughout the production of the click and in some languages for an extended time afterward; this period of up to 150 ms (the voice onset time) may include weak breathy-voiced aspiration at the end. However, when embedded in a phrase after a vowel they tend to be partially voiced; the preceding vowel will also be nasalized or the click prenasalized, for a realization of vs . They have a tone-depressor effect, so that a level tone on the following vowel will be realized as rising. The description above is typical, characteristic of languages such as Khoekhoe and G«Äui. However, aspirated nasal clicks have a more extreme pronunciation in Taa, where they need to maintain a distinction from both the plain voiceless and breathy-voiced nasal clicks. In this language they are not voiced after vowel sounds except in rapid speech, and in addition do not have nasal airflow; Trail reports that they instead have active ingressive pulmonic airflow (that is, air is breathed in the nose rather than being vented out). Breathy-voiced (murmured) nasal clicks are less common. They are known from !Kung languages such as Ju«Ä ºhoansi, from Taa, and from the Bantu languages Xhosa and Zulu. They are pronounced like modally voiced nasal clicks, but in addition are followed by a period of murmured phonation, and like other breathy-voiced consonants, may have a depressor effect on tone (in Zulu and Xhosa, for example). They are typically transcribed something like or ; in Ju«Ä ºh√µa, they are written , and in Zulu and Xhosa, as . In IPA, they could be either or Voiceless nasal clicks distinct from voiceless aspirated clicks are only attested from one language, Taa, which changes the voicing of the initial consonant to distinguish singular and plural nouns. In this language, both voiced and voiceless nasal clicks (but not the aspirated and breathy-voiced nasal clicks) nasalize the following vowel; they are largely distinguished by voiceless vs. murmured nasalization leading up to the click release, and the voicelessness occurs even after vowels.Naumann, Christfied (2008). \\"The Consonantal System of West «ÉXoon\\". 3rd International Symposium on Khoisan Languages and Linguistics.

The hotel closed to guests on November 13, 2015 for ongoing renovations, following the sale of the property from Jeff Hunter to Hawkeye Hotels, and will reopen as a Curio Collection Hilton Worldwide hotel. Architecture The hotel is an eleven- story building that rises above the ground. There are two floors below ground and the building contains three elevators. The hotel rooms are in a nine-story H-shaped tower that allows for increased light and air circulation for more rooms. It sits on a two-story base that houses the public rooms and commercial space.

In particular, the site is known for the rare western rustwort, a plant that grows only at two other sites in the UK. Geography The SSSI, notified in 2000, comprises three separate sites that are all about north of the town of St Austell.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin They all lie within china clay workings which are still active and are situated on either pits, spoil tips or vegetation-covered granitic debris. The combined site is also designated a Special Areas of Conservation (SAC). Wildlife and ecology The SSSI owes its importance to a rare liverwort, the western rustwort (Marsupella profunda), which in the UK can be found only at this site and at two others: Lower Bostraze and Leswidden and Tregonning Hill SSSIs, both within Cornwall, to the west. It is mostly found growing in moist conditions on micaceous or clay waste substrates with no or little sloping, as well as on soft or crumbling granite rocks. Lansalon Pit, within St Austell Clay Pits Important Plant Area Owing to the presence of the rare western rustwort, Plantlife has designated a large area of active and disused mine workings in the St Austell area as an Important Plant Area, with the same name as the SSSI. This area includes all the SSSI sites, as well as many others. It is thought that the protected areas will act as a source for colonisation for the western rustwort to other locations in the surrounding china clay area.

Written and produced by Play & Win members Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea and Marcel Botezan, it was made available for digital download on 20 April 2012 as the fifth single from the record through DIY Records. Musically, \\"Wow\\" is an electropop song. An accompanying music video was shot by Edward Aninaru at MediaPro Studios in Buftea, Romania in January 2012. It was uploaded onto Inna's official YouTube channel on 5 April 2012 and references multiple fairy tales and animated movies, including The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland (1951). Music critics applauded the visual, praising its contemporary production. The song was nominated for Best Dance at the 2012 Romanian Music Awards. Commercially, \\"Wow\\" reached number 10 in Romania and position 171 in Russia. Background and reception \\"Wow\\" was written and produced by Romanian trio Play & Win members Sebastian Barac, Radu Bolfea and Marcel Botezan. It was made available for digital download in Italy on 20 April 2012 by DIY Records; both the Italian and American digital releases featured multiple remixes alongside the original track. The accompanying cover artwork for \\"Wow\\" was shot by Edward Aninaru in a summer 2011 photo shooting session. Following its release to Romanian radio stations, \\"Wow\\" entered the nation's Airplay 100 chart at number 77 on 22 April, reaching number 10 on 10 June. On Russia's Tophit chart, \\"Wow\\" debuted at number 216 on 28 April and reached number 171 on 19 May 2012. The song was nominated for Best Dance at the 2012 Romanian Music Awards. Music video The music video for \\"Wow\\" references multiple fairy tales and movies, including Alice in Wonderland (1951). An accompanying music video for \\"Wow\\" was shot by Aninaru at the MediaPro Studios in Buftea, Romania in January 2012, with whom Inna had previously collaborated for around 50 photo shootings at that time. According to the singer, Aninaru came with the idea of referencing multiple fairy tale characters ‚Äî including Snow White and Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz ‚Äî in the visual, which she agreed to. The clip was uploaded onto Inna's YouTube channel on 5 April 2012, preceded by a preview lasting 23 seconds. The music video ‚Äî lasting for nearly five minutes ‚Äî begins with Inna in a van driving to an animated beach setting along with other people; while on journey, they sing a stripped-down portion of \\"Wow\\". Following this, they exit the van and encounter other summary dressed people lying on a confetti ground. After being hit by a beach ball, Inna faints and is afterwards looked from above by people dressed in black-and-white outfits. As the music video progresses, the singer is shown dancing and performing to the song in various fairy tale settings, while encountering various characters. Scenes include her appearing oversized while inside a room, and her dancing on a table at an Alice in Wonderland‚Äìinspired meal with various characters in a background of champignons; she wears a Hatter‚Äìesqu√© hat. The clip ends with Inna performing a synchronized choreography with all characters before the screen turns black. An Urban.ro editor praised the visual and its production, calling it \\"sexy\\". Schaap of Direct Lyrics saw the clip as \\"out there... to say the least\\", and labelled it as a mix between Alice in Wonderland, the 1971 American musical film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory and American singer Gwen Stefani's \\"swagger and theme\\" in her visual for \\"What You Waiting For?\\" (2004). A writer from Utv.ro thought that the music video \\"has everything to be successful: it's very dinamic, full of color and it's hard to look away from the screen.\\" Live performances As part of her \\"Wow Session\\" series on YouTube, Inna performed the song in a setting similar to its music video on 3 March 2012 to celebrate five million fans on her Facebook page. Inna's vocal delivery and the live instrumentation received praise from an Urban.ro editor. She also delivered a live performance of \\"Wow\\" at the World Trade Center Mexico City in September 2012 along with other material from I Am the Club Rocker.

It was released on March 23, 2005.  Overview  In 1993, Yoshiki recorded his first classical studio album, Eternal Melody, in London at the studios owned by English record producer Sir George Martin, who produced and co-arranged the album, with the music performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. It mostly included orchestral arrangements of songs from his band X Japan. This second album was recorded in the Los Angeles County, California; in his own Extasy Recording Studio, O'Henry Sound Studios, and Paramount Pictures Scoring Stage M facility. All songs were written and composed by Yoshiki.  Composition  The albums contains two songs from his first single \\"Amethyst\\", the title track and \\"Ima wo Dakishimete\\". The second song was also released as a single in karaoke adaptation, in 1994 was the 35th annual best-selling single, and won the \\"Excellence Award\\" at the 36th Japan Record Awards. There are two orchestral arrangements of X Japan's songs \\"Longing\\" and \\"Forever Love\\", studio versions of songs from Yoshiki's symphonic concerts held in 2002, and the new song \\"Without You\\". It also includes songs by his solo project Violet UK, \\"Unnamed Song\\" and \\"Red Christmas\\". The first features female singer Daughter, who performed it in his concerts in 2002. The song \\"I'll Be Your Love\\" could possibly belong to his solo project as it was also performed for the first time in 2002, sung by Nicole Scherzinger. However, the song was released in 2003 as the debut single for American-Japanese female singer Dahlia, and was used as the theme song for the world fair Expo 2005, held in Japan, where Yoshiki conducted the orchestra in the opening ceremony. The album also includes; an orchestrated version of, one of the few songs he contributed while in Tetsuya Komuro's pop band Globe, \\"Seize the Light\\", the theme song \\"Kimi Dake Dakara\\" for the TV NHK's 50th anniversary commemorative broadcast, and the song \\"Anniversary\\" which he composed and performed at the request of the Japanese government at a celebration in honor of the tenth anniversary of Emperor Akihito's enthronement in 1999.  Release  The album was released on March 23, 2005, by Nippon Columbia. It debuted in third place on the Oricon daily charts, and reached number fourteen on the weekly chart in the initial counting week of April, with sales of 16,241 copies, and charted for six weeks.

It has been given the recommended English name of meadow waxcap in the UK and in North America has variously been called the meadow waxy cap, salmon waxy cap, and butter meadowcap. The species has a widespread, mainly temperate distribution, occurring in grassland in Europe and in woodland elsewhere. The basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are edible and are occasionally collected and sold commercially. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1774 by the German mycologist and naturalist Jacob Christian Sch√§ffer as Agaricus pratensis. It was subsequently combined in a number of different genera, before being transferred to Hygrocybe in 1914. The specific epithet comes from Latin \\"pratensis\\" (= growing in meadows). Molecular research published in 2011, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences found Hygrocybe pratensis not to belong in Hygrocybe sensu stricto and was moved back to the genus Cuphophyllus, in which it had previously been placed. Description Basidiocarps are agaricoid, up to 150 mm (6 in) tall, the cap convex at first, becoming flat, umbonate, or slightly depressed when expanded, up to 125 mm (5 in) across. The cap surface is smooth and dry, pale salmon to orange-buff. The lamellae (gills) are waxy, pale cap-coloured, and decurrent (widely attached to and running down the stipe). The stipe (stem) is smooth, cylindrical or tapering to the base, and cream to pale cap-coloured. The spore print is white, the spores (under a microscope) smooth, inamyloid, ellipsoid, about 5.5 to 6.5 by 4.0 to 5.0 Œºm. Similar species Hygrocybe berkeleyi is very similar, but fruit bodies are white (it has sometimes been considered a variety of H. pratensis). Hygrophorus nemoreus is also similar, but is an ectomycorrhizal species, growing in woodland with oaks, and has a distinctly mealy smell. Distribution and habitat The meadow waxcap has a widespread distribution, mainly occurring in temperate zones. It has been recorded in Europe, North Africa, North and South America, northern Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Like other waxcaps, it grows in old, unimproved, short-sward grassland (pastures and lawns) in Europe, but in woodland elsewhere. Recent research suggests waxcaps are neither mycorrhizal nor saprotrophic but may be associated with mosses. Conservation In Europe, Cuphophyllus pratensis is typical of waxcap grasslands, a declining habitat due to changing agricultural practices.

Congress also expressed concern over the potential impact from long-range transport on national and international policy. Congress further directed that a comprehensive 10-year research plan be developed and guided by an Interagency Task Force consisting of representatives of 12 agencies, the directors of four National Laboratories, and four presidential appointees. Operational management evolved to a six-member Joint Chairs Council consisting of the Administrators of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); secretarial officers of the Departments of Agriculture, Energy and Interior; and the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality. Other program managers include a Director for Research for executive functions, Task Group leaders reporting jointly to the Director of Research and their agencies for Coordination of research in each major subject area, and two committees composed of the Director of Research and senior representatives of the Joint Chairs Council‚Äôs agencies, i.e., the Interagency Science Committee and the Interagency Policy Committee. Mandate According to the Congressional mandate, the research was to include programs for: : 1. Identifying the sources of atmospheric emissions contributing to acid precipitation; : 2. Establishing and operating a nationwide long term monitoring network to detect and measure levels of acid precipitation; : 3. Research in atmospheric physics and chemistry to facilitate understanding of the processes by which atmospheric emissions are transformed into acid precipitation; : 4. Development and application of atmospheric transport models to enable prediction of long range transport of substances causing acidic precipitation; : 5. Defining geographic areas of impact through deposition monitoring, identification of sensitive areas, and identification of areas at risk; : 6. Broadening of impact data bases through collection of existing data on water and soil chemistry and through temporal trend analysis; : 7. Development of dose-response function with respect to soils, soil organisms, aquatic and amphibious organisms, crop plants, and forest plants; : 8. Establishing and carrying out system studies with respect to plant physiology, aquatic ecosystems, soil chemistry systems, soil microbial system, and forest ecosystems; and : 9. Economic assessments of (a) the environmental impacts caused by acidic precipitation on crops, forests, fisheries, recreational and aesthetic resources, and structures, and (b) alternative technologies to remedy or otherwise ameliorate the harmful effects which may result from acid precipitation. Other responsibilities Other responsibilities of NAPAP include coordination and communication of the Federal program related to acidic precipitation and cooperation with international, private, and State organizations engaged in similar research. The legislation also required reporting of results and recommendations to the Administration and Congress by the issuance of Annual Reports. Federal agencies responded to the Act by conducting a vigorous research and development program coordinated by NAPAP. The NAPAP Interim Assessment was issued on September 17, 1987. A major assessment was issued in 1990. Following the 1990 renewal and expansion of the Clean Air Act, resources devoted to NAPAP declined.

The Butterfly addresses these issues by being a simple design and by employing a single surface wing with a large area. Similarly the carriage is simple and lacks options, to reduce cost and weight. The resulting aircraft has a low landing speed of at the cost of a low cruise speed of . The Butterfly features a cable-braced hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, a single-seat, open cockpit, tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft's single surface wing is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, covered in Dacron sailcloth. The wing is supported by a single tube-type kingpost and uses an \\"A\\" frame control bar. When the aircraft was in production the wing was also available from the factory as a kit, as well as fully assembled. The landing gear uses tubular suspension and the nose wheel is steerable.

It follows U.S. Route 431 (US-431) in east Huntsville and State Route 53 (SR-53) in west Huntsville. Governors Drive is one of the main entrance points to the city from the east, carrying on average approximately 48,000 vehicles a day across Monte Sano Mountain. Road description Governors Drive as it starts to head up Monte Sano Mountain From the east, US-431 travels north up Monte Sano Mountain where it meets Dug Hill Road and becomes Governors Drive. From there, the four-lane highway turns to the west and meets Monte Sano Boulevard at the top of the mountain providing access to Monte Sano State Park. The highway then continues down the mountain, intersecting multiple surface streets along the way. Once down the mountain, the road widens to seven lanes where it intersects California Street and travels through the medical district intersecting with Franklin Street, Whitesburg Drive and Madison Street which provides direct access to Huntsville Hospital Emergency Room. The next intersection, Gallatin Street leads to the main entrance of Huntsville Hospital along with the new Twickenham Square development. Continuing to the west, Governors Drive intersects Harvard Drive where the new Downtown Gateway is being constructed. This extension of Harvard Drive will provide a direct connection to Big Spring Park and Downtown Huntsville. The road then travels south of the oldest Baptist Church in Alabama, the First Baptist Church of Huntsville, past the well-known Eggbeater Jesus then crosses over a former Louisville and Nashville Railroad rail line and intersects Monroe Street, one of the main access points to Downtown, providing access to the Huntsville- Madison County Public Library. The road then meets Memorial Parkway at which point US-431 turns to the north; Governors Drive continues through the intersection to the west and joins SR-53. The highway narrows down to five lanes at Clinton Avenue, the main access point to Downtown for West Huntsville. Finally the highway continues to the west to meet with Interstate 565 (I-565) and Jordan Lane, where SR-53 continues to the north.  Major intersections  Location of Governors Drive in Huntsville History Prior to 1955, before Memorial Parkway was constructed, Governors Drive was two separate streets. West of Whitesburg Drive, Governors Drive was known as Fifth Avenue and east of Whitesburg Drive, it was named Florida Short Route. Fifth Avenue ended at Whitesburg Drive and Florida Short Route became Longwood Drive at Whitesburg Drive, one block south of Fifth Avenue. US-431 traveled along Florida Short Route and turned north at Whitesburg Drive, traveling through downtown. When Memorial Parkway was built as a downtown bypass, US-431 needed to access the Parkway; so these two streets were connected and to allow US-431 to flow directly to Memorial Parkway. As a growing Huntsville consolidated, hundreds of streets were unified and renamed in 1956. The name Governors Drive was chosen for this road to honor the nine Alabama governors associated with Madison County history. Prior to the construction of Interstate 565 in the early 1990s, Governors Drive extended further west, connecting to Slaughter Road just outside the city of Madison. The interstate removed over five miles of roadway, cutting Governors Drive nearly in half. Portions of the road still exist while other portions were relocated to make room for the interstate highway. From Slaughter Road to the east, Governors Drive took on the name Madison Boulevard. A two lane road connecting Madison Boulevard to Old Madison Pike was created as a service road and took on the name Governors West. The roadway from Research Park Boulevard east to Jordan Lane was removed completely as the interstate was placed. Transportation Access to shuttle buses provided by the city of Huntsville are available along Governors Drive.

Plot Scrooge McDuck receives a silver platter for his Number One Dime, as a gift from an anonymous admirer. Pleased at this, Scrooge places the dime on the platter. This turns out to be a trap set by Scrooge's old enemy Magica De Spell: the platter is in fact a magical teleportation device, connected to an identical one in Magica's house at Mount Vesuvius, Italy. As soon as Scrooge places his dime on the platter, it disappears and reappears at Magica's house, where she easily steals it. Magica has forgotten to turn the spell off after stealing the dime, so Scrooge and Donald soon catch wind of the plot: whatever they place on the platter instantly appears at Magica's house, and vice versa. Thus they begin to use Magica's spell against her, creating all sorts of havoc to keep Magica from melting the coin down into a magical amulet: first (a part of) Donald runs around Magica's house, randomly crashing into things, then Scrooge fires a cannon into Magica's house, and Donald uses a fire extinguisher to spray Magica with. Finally, Scrooge threatens to flood Magica's house with seawater unless she surrenders and gives up the dime. Magica does, but with a parting gift: a whole boxful of foof bombs. Over the radio, the two detectives assigned by Scrooge to watch Magica's hut, cheerfully report that everything is fine and Magica has never left her home. Scrooge, coughing on smoke from the foof bombs, says they're both fired. Notes Rosa mentions that he finds this story particularly funny because Scrooge and Magica engage in full-scale combat without either of them ever leaving their home. It was only after Rosa completed and published this story that he remembered his old mentor Carl Barks had used a similar concept of a teleportation device in his 1961 story Stranger than Fiction, published in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories issue #249.

The main objective of the museum is to promote a culture of peace through raising awareness about the devastating consequences of war, with a focus on the health and environmental impacts of chemical weapons. Currently housed in a building donated by the municipality of Tehran within the historic City Park, the Tehran Peace Museum is as much an interactive peace center as a museum. On June 29, 2007, a memorial for the poison gas victims of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1980‚Äì88), along with a Peace Museum, was completed in a park in Tehran, capital of Iran. These facilities were established by the Society for Chemical Weapons Victims Support (an Iranian NGO), the city of Tehran, some other NGOs, and individuals and groups in Hiroshima. The museum coordinates a peace education program that holds workshops on humanitarian law, disarmament, tolerance, and peace education. At the same time, it hosts conferences on the culture of peace, reconciliation, international humanitarian law, disarmament, and peace advocacy. Additionally, the museum houses a documentary studio that provides a workspace wherein the individual stories of victims of warfare can be captured and archived for the historical record. The museum‚Äôs peace library includes a collection of literature spanning topics from international law to the implementation of peace to oral histories of veterans and victims of war. The 3D Holographic images are exhibited here. They have been made from the portraits of Iran‚ÄìIraq War's Martyrs. They designed by Hesam Bani-Eghbal and his team on Hesam Animation Studio.

Founding the Iranian Peace Museum Movement Its founding began with a conversation between the founders of the Tehran-based Society for Chemical Weapons Victims Support (SCWVS) and a coordinator for the International Peace Museums Network. This, as well as a visit to Hiroshima, Japan by members of SCWVS, fed into the desire for a museum in Tehran. It was in Hiroshima where the suffering from atomic arms was able to convert most powerfully into a drive for peace manifested via a peace museum. This ability to use the intense suffering of war to highlight the need for peace made the Tehran Peace Museum‚Äôs founders realize Iran's parallel suffering from chemical arms and the need for a parallel drive for peace.\\"The Background of the Tehran Peace Museum\\". Focus on survivor involvement While visiting Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, the founders of the Tehran Peace Museum realized the necessity of involving the victims of war in the creation of the museum. Only these individuals could provide credible accounts of the harsh realities of war and their correlating desire for peace. The most moving, enthusiastic, and relevant of these war survivors emerged as the Iranian victims of Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons attacks, the majority of whom were already in contact with SCWVS. This group of victims has proven to be extremely passionate about sharing their stories and serving as living monuments to the atrocities of war. Opening ceremony of the new building On June 29, 2011, concurrent with the anniversary of the gas attack on the city of Sardasht in 1987 and the Day of Campaign against Chemical Weapons, the new building of the Tehran Peace Museum was officially opened for public. during the ceremony, a number of guests from different countries, including the director of Hiroshima peace museum,http://en.tehran.ir/ViewArticle/tabid/77/ArticleId/49/Tehran-Hosts- Hiroshima-Peace-and-Friendship-Delegation.aspx a delegation representing the survivors of Hiroshima atomic bombing, survivors of chemical weapons attack from Halabja, Northern Iraq, as well many Iranian activists and war veterans attended.International Network of Museums for Peace Newsletter no 02, November 2011.

He ran propaganda operations for the British during both World Wars.  Early life  In 1885 Campbell Arthur Stuart was born in Montreal, Canada to stockbroker Ernest Henry Stuart and Letitia Mary S. Brydges. He was descended from British Empire loyalists who moved to Canada from the United States of America following the American War of Independence.  First World War  In 1915, Stuart raised an Irish-Canadian regiment drawn from both the Protestant and Roman Catholic communities in Quebec. En route to France he arranged for the officers and men of the regiment to march through Ireland as a show of solidarity. The effect of this effort to build a cross denominational consensus caught the attention of Canadian Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden. Borden arranged for Stuart to travel to the Vatican City to seek an audience with Pope Benedict XV and raise Papal interest in French Canada's war effort. Vatican officials were reportedly astonished at the speed in which he obtained his audience. After his Vatican mission, Borden dispatched Stuart to Washington D.C. as Assistant Military Attach√©. This made Stuart the first Canadian to be officially appointed to the British Diplomatic Service. Lord Northcliffe arrived in the United States and had Stuart transferred to his mission as Military Secretary in New York City. He then moved with Northcliffe to London to work in a propaganda role as Deputy Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries. At the end of the First World War, Campbell was a Lieutenant-Colonel and had been Mentioned in Dispatches.  Inter War Years   Newspapers  Stuart was demobilized in 1920 and Northcliffe offered to make him a managing director of The Times (a role which included supervision of editorial staff and news services). The following year Stuart was also made an managing editor at the Daily Mail. Northcliffe said of Stuart - After Northcliffe's death in 1922, Stuart was instrumental in negotiations which saw a controlling interest in The Times moving to Major Astor. Stuart was an active member of The Times board as a director for thirty-seven years until 1960.  Canadian Historical Society  In 1924, Stuart was a leading participant in the foundation of the Canadian Historical Society in France. He arranged for the society to be launched with a meal at the Palace of Versailles in the Galerie des Batailles. In order to secure use of the palace, Stuart insured the building and contents with Lloyd's of London. The meal was attended by descendants of the English and French families who had being prominent in Canadian history as well as members of the French and Canadian governments. Stuart served on the society's committee until 1958, including 10 years as chairman.  Communications Work  In 1928, Stuart served as the Canadian representative at the Imperial Wireless Cables Conference. Then in 1933 he was elected chairman of the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee.  Other Organisations  Further to his other roles Stuart also served on the committees of the following groups - * Beit Foundation for Scientific Research * Wolfe Memorial Committee (at Greenwich, London) * Quebec House Committee (at Westerham) * Hudson's Bay Record Society * King George's Jubilee Trust and Fields Foundation  Second World War  With the outbreak of the Second World War, Stuart was appointed Director of Propaganda in Enemy Countries. He recruited to his section Ray Shaw of The Times to be his deputy, Sir Dallas Brooks and Noel Coward before leaving his post in 1940.  Honours  He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 New Year Honours and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1939. Stuart was the Honorary Vice-President of the Champlain Society from 1964 until his death in 1972.  Personal life  Stuart never married and enjoyed entertaining with his mother acting as hostess. The Times (15 Sept. 1972) noted - He would entertain at his home, The Grove, in the Highgate area of London. It was at his home where he died on 14 September 1972.

He has spent most of his career working on the dynamics and predictability of weather and climate. Amongst various research achievements, he pioneered the development of probabilistic ensemble forecasting techniques for weather and climate prediction (at the Met Office and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). These techniques are now standard in operational weather and climate prediction around the world, and are central for reliable decision making for many commercial and humanitarian applications.

She has been the Chief Scientist at the Met Office since 2009. She is also a Visiting Professor in the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, where she held, prior to appointment to the Met Office, the positions of Director of Climate Research in the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) National Centre for Atmospheric Science and founding Director of the Walker Institute for Climate System Research.\\"Julia Slingo OBE\\", Met Office of Julia Slingo From 2015 to 2016 she was one of the members of the High Level Group of Scientific Advisors of the European Commission Scientific Advice Mechanism, part of its Directorate- General for Research and Innovation. Early life and education Julia Mary Walker was born on 13 December 1950 in Kenilworth, Warwickshire. She was educated at the King's High School for Girls, an all-girls independent school in Warwick. She studied physics at the University of Bristol and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1973. In 1988, she was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree at the same university. Career and research Following her degree she joined the Met Office, where she became a Senior Scientist in the dynamical meteorology section. Her research focussed on clouds and their interactions with the rest of the atmosphere, and she pioneered new ways to represent clouds in weather forecast and climate models. In 1985 she left the Met Office and, after a year at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in Reading, UK, Dame Julia moved in 1986 to the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in the USA. While at NCAR she was awarded in 1989 a PhD in atmospheric physics from the University of Bristol, for a thesis completed through a series of published papers. In 1990, Slingo returned to the UK, to join the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, where she founded a group researching into tropical climate. She became an established researcher in tropical climate variability and cumulus convection, its influence on the global climate, and its role in seasonal and decadal climate prediction, and led the development of a new generation of high resolution climate models. She developed a particular interest in the monsoons of India and China, working closely with scientists in both countries. More recently, she has also been investigating the impacts of changes on water resources and crop production, and the need to better represent the hydrological cycle in climate models. While at Reading Dame Julia became the first female Professor of Meteorology in the UK, and was appointed to the leading role in the UK climate science community of Director of Climate Research in NERC's National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS). In 2006 she founded the Walker Institute for Climate System Research at Reading, aimed at addressing the cross disciplinary challenges of climate change and its impacts. As Chief Scientist at the Met Office, Slingo is responsible for providing scientific and technical strategy, ensuring that the organisation adheres to good scientific and technical standards, and for directing and managing research and development within the Met Office. She also represents the Office on science and technology across government. In March 2012, Slingo said that a reduction in Arctic sea ice caused by climate change was possibly linked to colder and drier winter weather in the UK. In February 2014, she said that climate change is likely to be a factor in the storms and floods Britain had been experiencing for several months. Her research has been funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). Honours and awards Slingo was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2008 for services to environmental and climate science. She was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2014 New Year Honours for services to weather and climate science. Slingo was awarded the Buchan Prize of the Royal Meteorological Society in 1998. She was awarded honorary degrees of doctor of science by the University of Bristol in 2010, and the University of Reading in 2011. In 2014, Slingo was named one of the 100 leading UK practising scientists by the Science Council. She was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2015. The same year she was awarded the International Meteorological Organization Prize from the World Meteorological Organization. Slingo was the first female Professor of Meteorology in the UK. In 2008, she became the first woman President of the Royal Meteorological Society. She was interviewed on The Life Scientific by Jim Al-Khalili in 2014. She was awarded the Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal by the American Meteorological Society in 2020. Personal life Slingo married Anthony Slingo in 1978. He was an environmental scientist who died in 2008. They had two daughters; Mary and Anna. She lives in Sidmouth in Devon.

The film competed at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2012, where Petzold won the Silver Bear for Best Director. The film was selected as the German entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but it did not make the shortlist. Plot East Germany in 1980: Barbara (Nina Hoss) is a physician who arrives for her first day at a small rural hospital near the Baltic Sea. She had been at the prestigious Charit√© hospital in East Berlin but, after she'd filed an \\"Ausreiseantrag\\" ‚Äì an official request to leave East Germany ‚Äì she had been incarcerated and transferred to the small town where she is still monitored by the Stasi. The Stasi punishes her for the hours in which they cannot find her by searching her house, strip-searching and cavity-searching her. In her new job, she works in pediatric surgery, a department led by chief physician Andr√© Reiser. Reiser eventually tells her a story (whose veracity she questions) of how he too had lost his job at a more prestigious hospital in Berlin ‚Äì he was responsible for an accident with an incubator that left two premature infants blind. The Stasi had agreed to keep it quiet if he agreed to relocate to the provincial hospital and to work for them. So now Reiser reports on suspected people, including Barbara. Early on, when the police deliver Stella, a young runaway from a labour camp, to the hospital for the fourth time, Reiser thinks Stella is malingering. Barbara intervenes and orders removal of the restraints on the patient, readily diagnosing her with meningitis. During her recovery, Stella develops a strong attachment to Barbara, whose welcome bedside manner includes reading the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to her. Stella is pregnant and wants to raise the child. Wanting to escape from the country and to have her child in a new land, she implores Barbara to take her with her. However, they cannot find grounds for keeping Stella longer and soon she is returned against her will to the labour camp. Meanwhile, Barbara makes secretive bicycle treks, to a place to stash her secretly received funds for escape, and to the woods where she meets with her West German lover J√∂rg, who has been supplying her with prized goods and is preparing for her escape. When she meets him for a second rendezvous in an \\"Interhotel\\" (an East-German hotel for foreigners), he tells her of his completed plan for her escape the following weekend: she will be picked up in a small boat in the Baltic Sea and taken the short distance to Denmark. As Barbara spends more time working with Reiser, he begins making romantic overtures, which she rebuffs although she is intrigued by and attracted to him. He has built a laboratory, to test samples on-site, and he has created his own serums with which to treat patients. One day before her planned escape, Barbara is on duty caring for a critically ill patient named Mario, whose suicide attempt had resulted in his being hospitalized. Barbara discovers that Mario has not been recovering from his traumatic head injury as well as believed and requires immediate brain surgery. She tracks Reiser down on his day off, to inform him of Mario's urgent need of surgery. She finds him at the home of the Stasi agent who has been overseeing her monitoring. Reiser is treating the agent's wife, who is dying of cancer. Reiser persuades her to return to the hospital ‚Äì the same night of her planned escape ‚Äì so that he can perform the surgery, with her assistance as anaesthesiologist during the operation. Following her agreement to be there, yet still planning her escape, Barbara accepts Reiser's invitation to let him cook a lunch for her at his home on the same day. When Reiser finally tells Barbara that he is happy to have her there with him, she kisses him. Then she abruptly pulls away from him, and returns to her house to continue preparing to escape. During this time, Stella flees the labour youth detention programme again and comes to Barbara's doorstep that night. Barbara takes her to the agreed-upon area on the beach, where she is to meet a person who will help smuggle her out. Barbara writes a note to accompany Stella, which is presumably addressed to J√∂rg, explaining why she has chosen to let Stella escape, instead of going herself. After helping Stella to a waiting raft, and a skin diver who will help her escape by sea, she returns to the hospital. She takes a seat, across from Reiser, who is watching over Mario at his bedside. She has decided to stay in the East, to be with Reiser. In a final close-up, their eyes meet in mutual understanding. Cast Nina Hoss and Mark Waschke Ronald Zehrfeld and Rainer Bock Critical reception Barbara has a \\"certified fresh\\" approval rating of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 76 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Smart, solidly grafted, and thoroughly gripping, Barbara offers a deliberately paced, subtly powerful character study.\\" The film also has a weighted average score of 86/100 on the critical aggregator website Metacritic, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Writing in The Guardian, film critic Peter Bradshaw said of Barbara: \\"The weird oppression and seediness of the times is elegantly captured, and Hoss coolly conveys Barbara's highly strung desperation.\\" Bradshaw awarded the film four stars out of five. The New York Times designated Barbara a critics' pick. In her review, Manohla Dargis said of the film: \\"Barbara is a film about the old Germany from one of the best directors working in the new: Christian Petzold. For more than a decade Mr. Petzold has been making his mark on the international cinema scene with smart, tense films that resemble psychological thrillers, but are distinguished by their strange story turns, moral thorns, visual beauty and filmmaking intelligence.\\" Steven Rea wrote that \\"Christian Petzold's masterfully hushed, suspenseful thriller percolates with dread....Hoss, wearing her blond hair pulled back tight, and wearing an expression of inscrutable melancholy, gives a performance that doesn't feel like a performance at all. Her Barbara is absolutely real, and absolutely trapped. The film is aching, and exquisite.\\" In The Independent, Jonathan Romney includes Barbara in the genre of war stories - \\"as nerve-wracking as the best.\\" In the Chicago Sun-Times, Sheila O'Malley concluded \\"This is well- trod ground for Petzold, but never has it been so fully realized, so palpable, as in 'Barbara.'\\" In her article on Barbara, film scholar Christina Gerhardt argues that Petzold draws on melodrama and combines this genre with slow realism to add a chapter to post-Wende films about the GDR.

History The history of this picture can be traced right back to the beginning. Vasari mentions it as being in the house of a Modenese doctor, Francesco Grillenzoni; in 1582 Cardinal Luigi d'Este bought it, and presented it to Catarina Nobili Sforza, Countess of Santa Fiora and grand-niece of Pope Julius III. It was still in her possession in 1595.G. Vasari, The Lives of the Artists, Oxford (2008), s.v. Correggio and passim. In 1614 the panel was in Rome, the property of Cardinal Sforza of Santa Fiora,Cf. The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Biographical dictionary, as well as Catholic Hierarchy data for this cardinal who had no doubt inherited it. It was subsequently owned by Scipione Borghese, and then by Cardinal Antonio Barberini; the latter gave it to Mazarin in c. 1650. Louis XIV bought it from Mazarin's heirs in 1661, for 15000 livres.D. Ekserdjian, Correggio, Yale University Press (1997), pp.193-212. Correggio first depicted this subject in a little painting originally held in Naples (and not universally accepted as his work). The Louvre picture dates from the early 1520s, and it shows clear signs of Leonardo's influence (esp. lips, hands, visage), to which Correggio was particularly susceptible in his endeavour to convey a soft and graceful effect. A number of replicas of this painting have been made, many of which still survive. It has often been a source of inspiration to artists: in the 19th century it was copied by Louis Gustave Ricard, and several times by Fantin-Latour.F.

The service acts as a marketing tool for high-end restaurants used to seat tables that would otherwise go unseated, while consumers receive a discount at these restaurant. The goal of the business is to provide a variable pricing model for restaurants to match demand with supply, similar to the method used in other hospitality markets. Service for Members When launched, Savored (then VillageVines) allowed registered members to search for available reservations based on party size, time, date, neighborhood and cuisine. Reservations were $10 per booking, and in return members received a 30% discount on their meal. If the total bill was less than $33.33 (meaning the total discount amount works out to less than $10), a member could request a refund on the $10 booking fee. On May 9, 2012, Savored announced a new model. Discounts are dynamic and vary with consumer demand for different timeslots. For example, a given restaurant may have more available tables at 5-6 PM, and therefore offer a 40% discount, whereas the 8-9 PM timeslot receives a 10% discount. Service for Restaurants Savored offers to its restaurant customers a yield management tool which allows them to fill tables on days and at times that the tables would otherwise go unseated. Reservations are made both manually and also through a proprietary electronic reservation book. Savored also allows restaurants access to its Signatures platform to market special events and menus. History In 2009, McKean and Leahy left their jobs on Wall Street to start VillageVines, originally positioned as a web site that would offer discounts at restaurants for a limited time period. The service began with a select number of restaurants in New York and service expanded to Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago in September 2010. That model gave way to the existing model, which features $10 reservations for members, at a discount of 30% off the total dining bill. In January 2010, VillageVines raised $3 Million in its first round of funding from Hearst Interactive Media, GrandBanks Capital and High Peaks Venture Partners. VillageVines announced in June 2011 that it would be renamed Savored and continued its expansion to include another five markets, rolling out service in Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Miami and Denver.Shontell, Alyson (2011-06-20) \\"VillageVines Changes Its Stripes: Restaurant Deals Site Gets A New Name, New Look And New Strategy\\", Business Insider. National partnerships with OpenTable and Zagat were also publicized at this time.Miller, Claire Cain (2011-07-25) \\"OpenTable Offers Daily Deals With Savored\\", The New York Times. In October 2011 Savored Signatures, which features unique one-off experiences , was introduced by Savored partners and other industry names. On September 24, 2012, Savored was acquired by Groupon for an undisclosed amount. At the time, Savored had partnerships with about 1000 restaurants in 10 cities.

It is found living on the seabed in the waters around Antarctica. It has been used as a model organism in the fields of reproductive biology, embryology, ecology, physiology and toxicology. Molecular phylogeny The mitochondrial DNA of the Antarctic sea urchin and several other urchins found in the circumpolar region was examined in order to assess their phylogenetic relationships. It was found that Sterechinus neumayeri was most closely related to Paracentrotus lividus and Loxechinus albus, both of which are found in the southernmost part of South America. The divergence of the three species began 35 to 25 million years ago, which coincides with the period at which Antarctica became separated from South America.

The Antarctic sea urchin ranges in color from bright red to dull purple and can grow to in diameter. The test is globular with vertical rows of long, strong, white-tipped spines between which there is a dense covering of smaller spines and vertical rows of tube feet.

Most of the specimens found have been in water down to a depth of about . Biology The Antarctic sea urchin largely feeds on diatoms and other algae. It also consumes foraminiferans, amphipods, bryozoans, hydrozoans, polychaete worms and sponges and also seal faeces when available.Antarctic sea urchin Underwater photography. Retrieved 2012-01-09. The Antarctic sea urchin is often found living in association with the Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki and the seastar, Odontaster validus. Research Metabolism Metabolic processes tend to slow down as the temperature decreases and the Antarctic sea urchin lives in an extremely cold environment. A research study has found that the larvae use energy 25 times more efficiently than other organisms do. Mature urchins were collected from under the sea ice and moved to a research laboratory at McMurdo Sound where they were induced to spawn. Over 10 million embryos were used to test the protein turnover rates and the associated changes in metabolic rates in the larvae as they developed and this super-efficiency was found. Despite this, it took the larvae a year to develop into juveniles. The mechanism for this energy efficiency was unclear but it was surmised that if it could be transferred through genetic manipulation to other organisms such as clams, oysters or fish, it could transform aquaculture. Global warming A research study examined whether the reproductive capacity of the Antarctic sea urchin and the Antarctic proboscis worm (Parborlasia corrugatus) would cope with the increased ocean acidification that would be likely to accompany global warming. It was found that a lowering of the pH from the normal level of 8.0 to 7.0 had little effect on reproduction in the worm, apart from a slight increase in the number of abnormal later-stage embryos. In the urchin, fertilisation rates were reduced at a pH below 7.3, but only at low sperm concentrations. There was a considerable increase in abnormal embryos at later stages of development under lowered pH conditions. In the case of these two cold water invertebrates, these results were not more significant than those of other example organisms from more temperate regions of the world.

Pierce, (1859‚Äì1939) was a founder of Pierce Brothers Mortuary in Southern California, which at the time of his death was the second-largest funeral business in the nation. He was also a member of the Los Angeles City Council and that city's Planning Commission. Biography Pierce was born on December 28, 1859, in Delaware County, New York, the son of James Washington Pierce of Dutchess County and Francis C. Clark of Delaware County. His brothers were C.W., Herbert and Fred Pierce, and he had a sister, Catherine (later Wheat). He was married on April 15, 1886, to Mary Jane Newton of Saybrook, Connecticut. They had three children, Sterling N., Gertrude (Mrs. Hyalmar Johnson) and Helen Mary (Mrs. Harry Hum).Los Angeles Public Library reference file He attended public schools in Delaware County and graduated from Walton Academy in Walton, New York. At the age of nineteen, he was a schoolteacher for a year, then emigrated in 1880 to Sacramento, California, where he joined a brother in the grocery business. The next year he spent with another brother in Sierra Madre, California, and then ran a general store for a year at Tuolumne Hill, Calaveras County. Moving to Los Angeles in 1885, Pierce engaged with both brothers in a furniture store and livery stable business on the Los Angeles Plaza. Later he took on raising grain and hay on Mission Road near the eastern city limits, and in 1902 all three began a mortuary business under the name of Pierce Brothers & Company. It became the second-largest mortuary in the United States. In 1934 he owned three farms of more than 200 acres in the San Joaquin Valley and Riverside County, and he listed his hobbies as golf, farming and viticulture (grape cultivation). He was a member of the Masons, Woodmen of the World, Elks Lodge, California Country Club, City Club and Commercial Club. He was an official of the First Unitarian Church, Los Angeles, and a Republican. He was a founder of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.

Public service City Council Pierce's interest in municipal water ownership was satirized in this 1902 newspaper cartoon In 1898 Pierce was elected to the City Council from the 1st Ward in Lincoln Heights. He was reelected and served until 1903. His interests centered on the problems of the city's water supply, and he took part in the successful endeavor to establish a municipal water system, with the Los Angeles Water Department, precursor to today's Los_Angeles_Department_of_Water_and_Power, taking over control from private companies in 1908. Commissions Pierce helped organize and was president of the City Planning Commission from 1920 to 1922. The 51-member group was \\"an outgrowth of the City Planning Association formed primarily to prepare a program of civic improvements to create employment for returned soldiers of the World War.\\" He was next a member of a new planning commission until 1925. He was also an organizer and president for one term of the city Traffic Commission.

Designed by the architectural firm of Stageberg Beyer Sachs, Inc., the building was completed in 1985. It is essentially a modernist building, but it exhibits elements of the Postmodern style. These are found in the light and dark colored banding at the base and the blue hipped and gabled roof. History In the 1980s, the Plaza joined the Civic Center of Greater Des Moines and Cowles Commons in helping to spur the revival of the downtown area. The Plaza overlooks these cultural attractions and one of the benefits of the building's design is that it is positioned at a 45-degree angle to give sunlight and views to as many residents as possible. Over the years, The Plaza has proven itself as a luxury living solution for downtown Des Moines with a continued return on investment. There are currently 186 residential units with guidelines on the number of units that can be subleased to ensure owner interest in the building. Units vary from 650 to 5,000 square feet.

The city is situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, and at above mean sea level, Atlanta has one of the highest elevations among major cities east of the Mississippi River. Atlanta straddles the Eastern Continental Divide, such that rainwater that falls on the south and east side of the divide flows into the Atlantic Ocean, while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide flows into the Gulf of Mexico. Atlanta sits atop a ridge south of the Chattahoochee River, which is part of the ACF River Basin. Located at the far northwestern edge of the city, much of the river's natural habitat is preserved, in part by the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. Climate The climate of Atlanta and its metropolitan area is humid subtropical, (Cfa) according to the K√∂ppen classification, with four seasons including hot, humid summers and cool winters that are occasionally cold by the standards of the southern United States; the city and its immediate suburbs are located in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 8a, although the far northern suburbs begin to transition to Zone 7b. Summers are long and consistently hot and humid. The daily average temperature in July is , with temperatures occasionally exceeding , and slight breezes, and typically a 20‚Äì40% chance of afternoon thunderstorms. During the summer afternoon thunderstorms, temperatures may suddenly drop below with locally heavy rainfall. January averages , with temperatures in the suburbs slightly cooler. Warm, maritime air can bring springlike conditions while strong Arctic air masses can push lows to between . Snow may not occur in every season in the city and inner suburbs but does every season in the northern metro. When snow falls it is almost always during the period of December through March: there have occurred only three measurable falls outside these months in the past ninety years, the largest being on November 11, 1968. Typical of the southeastern U.S., Atlanta receives abundant rainfall, which is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, though spring and early fall are markedly drier. Average annual rainfall is about , with late winter and early spring (as well as July) being the wettest and fall (especially October) being the driest. Despite having far fewer rainy days, average yearly rainfall is higher here than in the Seattle area, especially due to heavy thunderstorms and occasional tropical depressions. Extremes Temperatures at or above now occur on 44 days per year (up from 37 previously); though there have been as many as 91 days in 2019, and as few as 2 days in 1967. Overnight freezes can be expected on 40 days, but the high temperature rarely fails to climb above the freezing mark. In very cold winter months with high-latitude blocking, averages can occasionally fall below freezing: the coldest month was January 1977 which averaged and which amazingly saw Atlanta average colder than Anchorage, Alaska almost 30 degrees latitude further north. The only other month with a subfreezing mean has been January 1940 with an average of and a record cold mean maximum of . Snowfall averages per season. The heaviest single storm brought on January 23, 1940, the most snow in one calendar day, and the most in a calendar month; the most snowfall in a season (July 1 through June 30 of the next year) is in 1935-36. True blizzards are rare but possible; the Storm of the Century, which affected the region on March 12‚Äì14, 1993, is one such example, bringing snowdrifts up to high in some parts of north Georgia. Ice storms usually cause more trouble than does snowfall; the most severe such storms may have occurred on January 7, 1973 and January 9, 2011. In 2010, Atlanta had its first White Christmas since 1882 and 1883. Later that same winter (the third-coldest ever), a major snow-and-ice storm almost prevented the inauguration of the new governor of Georgia, and crippled the region for two days, with snow still left more than a week later in some places. Official weather recordkeeping began in Atlanta in 1878, on the morning of October 3. Since then, the highest recorded temperatures at Atlanta were on June 30, 2012; the hottest month on record is August 2007, with a mean temperature of . The lowest recorded temperatures were and on January 20 and 21 of 1985, and on February 13, 1899. There was also an official recording of in 1985 in Marietta. The coldest high temperature was , again on February 13, 1899, while, conversely, the hottest low temperature was on August 8, 2007. The rainiest month ever was July 1994, when Tropical Storm Alberto dumped massive amounts of rain on parts of the state and the south metro area, bringing at Atlanta, over three times a normal July. Flooding was a major problem in those areas, and further down-state it was a major disaster. The driest month was October 1963 when a record dry spell occurred over the entire eastern and southern United States, leaving Atlanta with only a trace of precipitation for the entire month. Data Effect on vegetation Some palm trees like palmetto and cacti like prickly pear can withstand the cold nights, complementing numerous flowering pansies and a few camellias, and other mild-winter-friendly plants of the region. The growing season in the area lasts several months, hardy plants being as early as mid February, and others from mid March to late October, when the last and first cold snaps usually occur. Spring weather is pleasant but variable, as cold fronts often bring strong or severe thunderstorms to almost all of the eastern and central U.S. Pollen counts tend to be extraordinarily high in the spring, regularly exceeding 2000 particles per cubic meter in April and causing hay fever, sometimes even in people not normally prone to it. Pine pollen leaves a fine yellow-green film on everything for much of that month. The rain helps wash out Atlanta's abundant oak, pine, and grass pollens, and fuels beautiful blooms from native flowering dogwood trees, as well as azaleas, forsythias, magnolias, and peach trees (both flowering-only and fruiting). The citywide floral display runs during March and April, and inspires the Atlanta Dogwood Festival, one of Atlanta's largest. Fall is also pleasant, with less rain and fewer storms, and leaves changing color from late October to mid-November, especially during drier years. A secondary peak in severe storms also occurs around the second week of November. Effect of geography The area's geography affects the weather as well. An anticyclone over the Northeastern U.S. will blow cold air over the warmer Atlantic Ocean, forming a wedge or marine layer up against the mountains. This east or northeast wind will often blow down into the metro area in winter or even spring (sometimes fall and very rarely summer), dramatically lowering the temperature and bringing clouds and often fog or mist, along with a swift breeze. The temperature gradient across the sprawling metro Atlanta can be as much as 20 ¬∞F or 10 ¬∞C, occasionally even more. In winter this can be a curse, bringing freezing rain to exposed objects on the north and/or east sides of town, and occasionally very dangerously to the ground and roads. Later in the spring however, it can be a great blessing, as it often protects the area from severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, with the cool air acting like a fire extinguisher to the storms. The wedge may occasionally go the entire way through central Georgia and even into Alabama in the strongest conditions, while still leaving areas of northwest Georgia much warmer than the metro area. Conversely, shallow and heavy cold air from the northwest may be blocked by the mountains, preventing snow. The local geography also plays a role in the day-to-day weather, with the shallow valleys to the southwest (rather than the mountains to the northeast) cooling rapidly on clear and calm nights, particularly when the humidity is low. Peachtree City and especially Newnan often report dramatically lower temperatures (by as much as ) on the 10 pm and 11 pm news, and will not drop much further, while the city (built on a ridge) will continue falling slowly but never reach that low. This type of dramatic difference in microclimate is somewhat unusual for a place not near large mountains or bodies of water. Extreme weather Tropical cyclones Hurricane Opal brought sustained tropical storm conditions to the area one night in early October 1995, uprooting hundreds of trees (mainly oaks) and causing widespread power outages, after soaking the area with rain for two days prior. The western metro area caught the worst of the storm, gusting to nearly officially at Marietta. Such events are very rare so far inland, some inland from the Gulf of Mexico where most of the storms come from; however some areas particularly east and south of the city received similar damage from the wide wind field of Hurricane Irma in September 2017, with a gust to at Atlanta's airport and sustained winds up to there. Record-cool high temperatures of caused by cold-air damming against the Appalachians served to eliminate the normal tornado risk in north Georgia and to weaken the storm faster than expected, reducing the anticipated damage to the area. Less than a month later in early October 2017, the much smaller Hurricane Nate was forecast to pass rapidly through northwest Georgia as a weak tropical storm, expected to cause far fewer issues to the metro area than Irma. These two storms caused the first tropical storm watches (and for Irma, warnings) for the area since these were allowed to be issued for inland locations instead of just coastal ones. Tornadoes Since 1950, some metro counties have been hit more than 20 times by tornadoes, with Cobb (26) and Fulton (22) being two of the highest in the state. (Note that some tornadoes may have occurred at the same time, or in two different counties.) Another struck the Georgia Governor's Mansion in 1975. The Dunwoody tornado in early April 1998 was the worst tornado to have struck the suburban area. Since then, many counties have reinstalled civil defense sirens removed after the Cold War. On March 14, 2008, an EF2 tornado hit downtown Atlanta with winds up to . The tornado caused damage to Philips Arena, the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel, the Georgia Dome, Centennial Olympic Park, the CNN Center, and the Georgia World Congress Center. It also damaged the nearby neighborhoods of Vine City to the west and Cabbagetown, and Fulton Bag and Cotton Mills to the east. While there were dozens of injuries, only one fatality was reported.Eberly, Tim; Shea, Paul. \\"Tornado Claims One in Polk County .\\" Atlanta Journal and Constitution. March 15, 2008.

During the 2000s, only four major snows occurred (December 2000, January 2002, January 2008, and March 2009), while three occurred in early 2010 (an El Ni√±o year) alone, making it the snowiest winter since the 1970s. Despite predictions of a warm and dry winter due to La Ni√±a developing the following summer, additional fell on December 25, giving the city (and its northern and western suburbs) its first true white Christmas in over a century. The only other measurable snows on that date were in 1881, and in 1882. A trace last fell on Christmas in 1993, and a dozen other years before that. A blizzard (see: 1993 Storm of the Century) caught much of the Southeast off-guard in 1993, dumping at the Atlanta airport on March 13, and much more than that in the suburbs to the north and west, as well as in the mountains. Dallas, a suburb about to the west-northwest, received from the storm. Some people were awakened by thunder and lightning in a very rare thundersnow event. Several areas of northern Cobb County recorded over in snowdrifts. It is widely regarded as the snow event of the century for Atlanta, and is referred to as the \\"Storm of the Century\\", placing fifth in the city's snowfall records. The only other recorded winter storm of comparable severity was the Great Blizzard of 1899, which struck in February. A blizzard hit on January 9‚Äì15 crippling the city and leaving schools out for the whole week. Ice-covered roads and over eight inches of snow fell in some places with over a foot in the far northern metropolitan area. The heaviest snow, however, was on January 23, 1940, when buried the city during its second-coldest month on record. The second-heaviest was in 1983, when a very late storm dumped on March 24. The latest snow and freeze ever were in 1910, when and were recorded on April 25. Since 1928, the earliest measurable snows were November 11 and 23, followed in 2013 by on the 27th, the day before the second-coldest Thanksgiving on record. Prior to March 2009, the most recent major snow occurred at the beginning of 2002, when up to fell on January 2‚Äì3. As of 2007, the stretch of five nearly or entirely snowless winters made for an extremely long period compared to average. This streak was ended in January 2008 when fell on January 16 and fell three days later. The following year, the first widespread winter storm since 2002 dumped on March 1, with the heaviest to the southwest and east-northeast, and surprisingly little or nothing in the far northern suburbs and mountains. Much of it melted almost as fast as it was accumulating at mid-day, while eastern areas had thundersnow and cloud-to- ground strikes reported by lightning detection; it was an upper-level low from the Great Plains, while most major storms in the area occur with a typical surface low-pressure area traveling along the Gulf coast. The 2009 snow tied with the 1993 blizzard and another storm for fifth-heaviest official daily snow in the city's recorded weather history. Areas to the due east and west often receive more snow than metro Atlanta, because the energy begins to transfer to a coastal low in the Atlantic, on its way to becoming a nor'easter. Also the mountains to the northwest entrap shallow cold air. Average annual snowfall from 1971 to 2000 in Atlanta is ‚Äì the snowiest month is January with . Due to two record-breaking heavy storms during the averaged period, it is actually March that is statistically second with ‚Äì cut in half if the heaviest storm is removed. This is followed by February with and December with , then November, April, and October averaging a trace each. The latest was April 25, when fell in 1910, also the heaviest for the month, and the latest-ever freeze. Four other April snows have been recorded since 1879, the most recent significant one being April 3, 1987. Flurries occurred in 1993 on the afternoon of Halloween, marking only the third recorded October snow (all of which were an unmeasurable trace). Although December is just as cold as February and has more days, it receives the least snow of any winter month (roughly once per decade), due to less overall precipitation in the later months of the year compared to the rainier mid and late winter. However, the lowest sun and shortest days of the year mean that what does fall can stay around for days. A mid-December 2000 snow (a record for the month) was followed by very cold weather that left spots of it on the ground in shady areas until Christmas. Following the 2010 snow, the next December event was in 2017, when the heaviest snows since the March 1993 blizzard hit the northwestern suburbs and west-northwestern exurbs. Paulding, northwest Cobb, and southeast Bartow counties were hit with up to of very heavy and wet snow, due to the temperature being slightly above freezing for much of the event. The very high water content and lack of any wind in turn caused widespread power outages as major accumulations brought down power lines, leaving some without electricity for days. This was the earliest in the season that the metro area is known to have received so much snow, though long-term official records are only kept at Atlanta proper. Ice storms have also occurred in the area. Two hit the city a week apart in January 2000, the second one while Atlanta was hosting Super Bowl XXXIV, which was felt to affect the city's future chances for hosting it again. The well-remembered January 1973 ice storm was brutal, and was followed in February by the record-breaking 1973 Southeast U.S. snowstorm that hit the coastal half of the state, bringing light snow to what were then the far southeastern suburbs. A January 1982 snowstorm, which came to be called \\"Snow Jam '82\\" by the media and those who lived through it, also crippled the city just as bad as ice can, striking in the afternoon while everyone was at work, several hours earlier than expected. Tens of thousands of people were stranded in the city, abandoning cars on every road and freeway and booking hotels to capacity, unable to get home to the suburbs. Despite this well-known experience, the same thing happened in January 2014, when snow expected to hit mainly middle Georgia in the afternoon crept northward at midday, the resulting road ice stranding children in schools and even on school buses overnight, while people slept in makeshift shelters such as Home Depot, Kroger, and CVS stores, and in fire stations and even in their vehicles. Commutes that normally take minutes instead took several hours or even until the next day, with average speeds near zero and many vehicles running out of gasoline. Several people simply walked to their destination, while Georgia National Guard troops were called to join HERO units along with the Georgia State Patrol and local police in checking on stuck and abandoned cars. While only fell on the afternoon of the 28th, and many issues from the 2011 snow-then-ice storm had been addressed, the sudden rush of traffic between noon and 1pm rapidly created massive gridlock and prevented snow removal and deicing equipment from going anywhere. GDOT equipment that had been dispatched to areas further down-state based on early forecasts also lessened the response, as they could not get back north to their regular districts in time. Officials tried to blame the National Weather Service, but this was refuted by The Weather Channel, CNN, and local TV stations, which showed that winter storm warnings were extended up to the northern suburbs more than two hours before most school systems needed to decide on whether to cancel school for the day, and even the prior winter weather advisory should have been enough to cause these cancellations. Drought The driest year in Atlanta history was 1954 (31 inches of rain), with 2007 being a close second. The Southeastern U.S. drought of 2006‚Äì2008 began with dry weather in 2006, and left area lakes very low. Most of the area's drinking water is stored in Lake Lanier and Lake Allatoona, which reached record low levels in December 2007. Up through September 2007 was the driest year on record in over 75 years, second only to 1927 and 1931. On September 28, the state issued a total outdoor watering ban for the north and northwestern 40% or so of the state, affecting 61 counties generally north of the Fall Line. (Some local authorities and water systems had already taken such measures.) It was the first time the state had enacted such a ban. Throughout the 3-year drought the Atlanta area occasionally experienced smoke from the wildfires in south Georgia, causing the local air to become dangerous for everyone. The severe record drought which affected the region starting in late 2006 finally began to abate significantly after heavy fall rains in 2009. Flooding The historic drought ended with historic flooding in 2009. The 2009 Atlanta floods affected the entire area on September 21, 2009 with parts of eastern Paulding, northern Douglas, and southwestern Cobb counties getting around of rain in a week, with half of that falling in just 24 hours near the end of the period. Douglasville received the most rain in 24 hours than any other city in metro Atlanta, the city received over 16.5 inches of rain on Sept 21, 2009. (The USGS calculated it to be a greater-than-500-year flood; the National Weather Service stated that chances of that much rain anywhere in the region are 1 in 10,000 years.) Some freeways closed temporarily, and several small bridges and culverts were ruined and will take months to replace. Many homes in the area were completely destroyed. Occasional heavy rains and flood advisories continued through early February 2010. Flood events are localized from nearly stationary thunderstorms, or more broadly impacting from slow-moving tropical storm remnants, or sometimes from unusually heavy and persistent winter rains during El Ni√±o years. Other droughts have also ended in lesser floods, including in 1989. The flooding has also ended as of 2010. Environmental issues Announcement of Virginia-Highland's carbon- neutral zone, the first in the United States In 2007, the American Lung Association ranked Atlanta as having the 13th highest level of particle pollution in the United States. The combination of pollution and pollen levels, and uninsured citizens caused the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America to name Atlanta as the worst American city for asthma sufferers to live in. However in 2010, all counties in the Atlanta metro area began requiring yearly emissions testing for all motor vehicles, with the exception of antique cars and the three most recent model years. Bright spots include projects that encourage smart growth, such as the BeltLine and Atlantic Station mixed-use development, which the Environmental Protection Agency commended in 2005. In 2009, Atlanta's Virginia-Highland became the first carbon-neutral zone in the United States. There, neighborhood merchants, through the Chicago Climate Exchange, directly fund the Valley Wood Carbon Sequestration Project (thousands of acres of forest in rural Georgia).

It is applied in the context of agile software development methods, in particular behavior-driven development. This approach is particularly successful for managing requirements and functional tests on large-scale projects of significant domain and organisational complexity. Specification by example is also known as example-driven development, executable requirements, acceptance test‚Äìdriven development (ATDD or A-TDD), Agile Acceptance Testing, Test-Driven Requirements (TDR). Advantages Human brains are generally not that great at understanding abstractions or novel ideas/concepts when first exposed to them, but they‚Äôre really good at deriving abstractions or concepts if given enough concrete examples. The more examples we are given, the more likely we are to correctly understand the intended meaning. Also, by using concrete examples, they become more familiar and relatable to something similar to our past experiences, which generally makes them easier to understand. Successful application of Specification by example is documented to significantly reduce feedback loops in software development, leading to less rework, higher product quality, faster turnaround time for software changes and better alignment of activities of various roles involved in software development such as testers, analysts and developers. Examples as a single source of truth A key aspect of specification by example is creating a single source of truth about required changes from all perspectives. When business analysts work on their own documents, software developers maintain their own documentation and testers maintain a separate set of functional tests, software delivery effectiveness is significantly reduced by the need to constantly coordinate and synchronise those different versions of truth. With short iterative cycles, such coordination is often required on weekly or biweekly basis. With Specification by example, different roles participate in creating a single source of truth that captures everyone's understanding. Examples are used to provide clarity and precision, so that the same information can be used both as a specification and a business-oriented functional test. Any additional information discovered during development or delivery, such as clarification of functional gaps, missing or incomplete requirements or additional tests, is added to this single source of truth. As there is only one source of truth about the functionality, there is no need for coordination, translation and interpretation of knowledge inside the delivery cycle. When applied to required changes, a refined set of examples is effectively a specification and a business-oriented test for acceptance of software functionality. After the change is implemented, specification with examples becomes a document explaining existing functionality. As the validation of such documents is automated, when they are validated frequently, such documents are a reliable source of information on business functionality of underlying software. To distinguish between such documents and typical printed documentation, which quickly gets outdated, a complete set of specifications with examples is called Living Documentation. Key practices Teams that apply Specification by example successfully commonly apply the following process patterns: *Deriving scope from goals *Specifying collaboratively - through all-team specification workshops, smaller meetings or teleconference reviews *Illustrating requirements using examples *Refining specifications *Automating tests based on examples *Validating the underlying software frequently using the tests *Evolving a documentation system from specifications with examples to support future development Software teams that apply specification by example within a Scrum framework typically spend 5%-10% of their time in refining the product backlog, including specifying collaboratively, illustrating requirements using examples and refining examples. Applicability Specification by example applies to projects with sufficient organisational and domain complexity to cause problems in understanding or communicating requirements from a business domain perspective. It does not apply to purely technical problems or where the key complexity is not in understanding or communicating knowledge. There are documented usages of this approach in domains including investment banking, financial trading, insurance, airline ticket reservation, online gaming and price comparison. A similar approach is documented also in a nuclear-power plant simulation project. Tests based on shared examples fit best in the category of tests designed to support a team while delivering software from a business perspective (see Agile Testing Quadrants) - ensuring that the right product is built. They do not replace tests that look at a software system from a purely technical perspective (those that evaluate whether a product is built the right way, such as unit tests, component or technical integration tests) or tests that evaluate a product after it was developed (such as security penetration tests). History The earliest documented usage of realistic examples as a single source of truth, requirements and automated tests, on software projects is the WyCash+ project, described by Ward Cunningham in the paper A Pattern Language of Competitive Development in 1996. The name Specification by Example was coined by Martin Fowler in 2004. Specification by Example is an evolution of the Customer Test practice of Extreme Programming proposed around 1997 and Ubiquitous Language idea from Domain-driven design from 2004, using the idea of black-box tests as requirements described by Weinberg and Gause in 1989.  Derived works   Example Mapping  Example Mapping is a simple technique that can steer the conversation and derive Acceptance criteria within 30 minutes .The process involves breaking each stories into Rules and Examples and documented in the form of Specification by examples. Example Mapping was first introduced by Matt Wynne in the 2015 Agile alliances conference and is one of the wildly used techniques in the BDD world .  SHEQC grooming  Similar to \\"Example mapping\\" SHEQC grooming enables teams to groom a complex user story in less than 30 to 45 min using a concept called as continuous grooming using design thinking techniques . SHEQC uses Specification by example as the standard for documenting scenarios . The process involves the double diamond rule for brainstorming and the out come is a set of question and Acceptance criteria again documented in the form of Specification by example for the story . SHEQC grooming was first introduced in the Innovations in software engineering conference ISEC2019 , WESSEE by Ranjith Tharayil and later published in XP2019 conference as one of the core methods for continuous grooming Automation Successful application of Specification by example on large scale projects requires frequent validation of software functionality against a large set of examples (tests). In practice, this requires tests based on examples to be automated. A common approach is to automate the tests but keep examples in a form readable and accessible to non-technical and technical team members, keeping the examples as a single source of truth. This process is supported by a class of test automation tools which work with tests divided into two aspects - the specification and the automation layer. The specification of a test which is often in a plain text or HTML form and contains the examples and auxiliary descriptions. The automation layer connects the example to a software system under test. Examples of such tools are: *Behat *Concordion *Cucumber *FitNesse *Framework for Integrated Test *Robot Framework *Gauge (software)  References  External links *Google discussion group *Books, videos, tools and presentations from Specificationbyexample.com *Definition on Martin Fowler's bliki Category:Software development philosophies Category:Software testing Category:Business analysis ","title":"Specification by example"},{"id":"34340145","text":"Roman Pivarn√≠k (born 17 February 1967) is a football manager and former player from Slovakia.http://www.profutbal.sk/ligy/cze1/clanok208342-Slovak_Pivarnik_trenerom_Plzne_Nebojim_sa.htm?

Short-lived but significant in American film history, World Film was created by financier and filmmaker Lewis J. Selznick in Fort Lee, where many early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based in the early part of the 20th century.  Formation  Selznick Studio, Fort Lee, 1920 World Film was to be the distribution arm for three main production companies: Selznick's own production company called Equitable Pictures, Jules Brulatour's Peerless Pictures, and the Shubert Pictures production company founded by the strong-willed promoter and entrepreneur William Aloysius Brady. Under this arrangement World Film was the distributor for some 380 short films and features from 1914 through 1921. It also became a production company, with filming centered at Brulatour's Peerless Studio facilities, and run by Brady. The Schuberts intended to use their own chain of vaudeville and legitimate theaters as film venues.The American theatrical film: stages in development, by John C. Tibbetts, page 85 In the period between 1912 and 1915, all of the five most important film production companies in the U.S. had similar ties to theatrical entrepreneurs, all hoping to leverage their theater chains: Famous Players Film Company, Klaw & Erlanger's \\"Protective Amusement Company\\", the Jesse L. Lasky Company, the Triangle Film Corporation, and World Film.The American theatrical film: stages in development, by John C. Tibbetts, page 64 By 1916, Selznick was ousted from World Film by its board. Chicago investor Arthur Spiegel was put in charge as president. Production remained at Fort Lee until 1919, when the company was re-purchased by Selznick and absorbed into his Lewis J. Selznick Productions, based on the west coast of the United States.  Talent  World Film was distinguished by its concentration of talent. It acquired film production company Equitable Motion Pictures Corporation. The outbreak of World War I drove a re-organization of foreign film-industry assets in Fort Lee, including the employees. Within World Film a number of French directors and cinematographers organized themselves in a separate French-speaking unit, with its own sensibility. For about three years Maurice Tourneur, L√©once Perret, George Archainbaud, Emile Chautard, Albert Capellani and Lucien Andriot, among others, worked together on films such as the 1915 version of Camille, and taught a young apprentice film cutter at the World studio: Josef von Sternberg.Von Sternberg, by John Baxter, pages 21-22 Others were also hired into World Film: actress Clara Kimball Young (second wife of director James Young, married and divorced) hired away from Vitagraph, Sidney Olcott hired away from Kalem Studios, screenwriter Frances Marion, actress Elaine Hammerstein, and vaudeville star Lew Fields, and Clara Whipple (third wife of director James Young, married and divorced).

Several memorial sites were established between 1945 and 1960, though widespread building started after the founding of the Non-Aligned Movement. Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito commissioned several memorial sites and monuments in the 1960s and 1970s dedicated to World War II battles, and Nazi concentration camp sites. They were designed by notable sculptors, including Du≈°an D≈æamonja, Vojin Bakiƒá, Miodrag ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Jordan and Iskra Grabul, and architects, including Bogdan Bogdanoviƒá and Gradimir Medakoviƒá. After Tito's death, a small number were built, and the monuments were popular visitor attractions in the 1980s as patriotic sites, and since the Yugoslav Wars and the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the sites are mostly abandoned.

Alexander McWhirter \\"Alex\\" Howat (1876‚Äì1945) was a Scottish-born American coal miner and trade union leader. Howat is best remembered as the chief opponent of the Kansas Court of Industrial Relations in the early 1920s and as the leader of a radical rank-and-file revolt against the officialdom of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) in 1923. Howat's activity ultimately led to his expulsion from the UMWA in 1930, forcing him into new occupations outside the organized labor movement. Biography Early years Alexander Howat was born in Glasgow, Scotland on September 10, 1876. He emigrated to the United States as a small child, arriving with his parents in 1879.Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume IX: The TUEL to the End of the Gompers Era. New York: International Publishers, 1991; pg. 216. The family lived first in Troy, New York and Braidwood, Illinois, before moving to Crawford County, Kansas, located in the Southeastern corner of the state.Randy Roberts, \\"Alexander Howat, the Industrial Court Law, and the 'Amazon Army.' Leonard Axe Library, Pittsburg State University, Pittsburg, Kansas. There Alex went to work in the coal mines for the first time as a boy of 10. He worked as a coal miner until the age of 22. Howat's activity in the mines soon lead him to membership in the United Mine Workers union. In 1902 he was chosen by his peers as a union official for the first time, when he was elected to the board for District 14 of the UMWA, covering the state of Kansas. In 1906 Howat was elected president of District 14 of the UMWA, retaining that position without interruption until 1914, when he refused to stand for re-election amidst charges of having accepted bribes from mine operators. Following investigation of this corruption charge, which led to Howat's exoneration, he was returned as the president of District 14 UMWA in 1916, remaining in this position through 1921. The Kansas Industrial Relations Act John L. Lewis, President of the United Mine Workers of America and nemesis of Alexander Howat, as he appeared in 1922. During World War I and the period immediately following the war Howat led several strikes of Kansas coal miners.John W. Hevener, \\"Alexander Howat\\" in Gary M. Fink (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of American Labor. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1984; pp. 305‚Äì306. These work stoppages moved the Kansas Legislature to pass the Kansas Industrial Relations Act in 1920, which banned strikes, picketing, and the use of boycott in favor of a binding Court of Industrial Relations for the resolution of labor disputes. Howat was a bitter opponent of this new system and in 1921 he led a strike in open defiance of the new industrial court arrangement. When he refused to participate in the proceedings of the industrial court, Howat was arrested. Over the next three years Howat was repeatedly jailed and released for his refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Kansas Industrial Court system. UMWA President Lewis and the union's executive board agreed with mine operators that Howat's support of wildcat strikes had constituted a violation of the union's contract, and Howat and other District 14 leaders were removed in favor of newly appointed officials.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 9, pg. 217. The charters of 83 Kansas locals were also revoked by the executive board. Howat and the Kansas situation was brought before the September 1921 annual convention of the UMWA at Indianapolis, Indiana. Following protracted debate, the convention voted to sustain the actions of Lewis and its executive board by a vote of 2,753 to 1,781, with the delegations from the Midwestern states of Kansas, Illinois, and Indiana siding with Howat in the minority.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 9, pg. 218. Despite Howat's defeat on the main question concerning him, he was elected by the 1921 convention as a delegate of the UMWA to the 1922 International Miners Conference, scheduled to be held in Europe.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 9, pg. 219. The battle within the UMWA continued in the months after the September 1921 convention, with Kansas miners, backed by the Illinois district organization, continuing their fight against the International union and the Kansas Industrial Court. In reply, on October 12, 1921, Lewis revoked the charter of District 14 altogether, ousting Howat and his associates in favor of a new slate of \\"provisional\\" officers who were to reorganize the district. Those miners continuing to strike against Kansas mine operators without sanction of the UMWA were expelled from the union.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 9, pg. 220. Howat's local had its charter revoked and union officials maintained that by this action Howat was himself excluded from the union. The 1922 annual convention of the UMWA was eventful, with Howat and 125 of his expelled followers in attendance. Howat forced his way to the platform to speak, but was denied this opportunity by union president Lewis, who declared that since Howat was neither a delegate nor a member of the union, he was not entitled to recognition by the assembly. Anger erupted on the floor and a debate was permitted on whether Howat should be allowed to bring the Kansas situation before the body. During an interlude in the debate the convention recognized \\"Mother\\" Mary Harris Jones, a 92-year-old radical trade union activist, who declared to the convention: > \\"I have known Alex Howat for twenty years, and while I have not always > agreed with Alex, I want to make this statement to the audience and to the > world: That my desire is to have a million Alex Howats in the nation to > fight the battle of the workers. He has fought for his men and he has fought > that damnable law that the governor of Kansas put on the statute books to > enslave the workers. He fought it nobly and is willing to go to death for > it...\\"Quoted in Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: > Vol. 9, pg. 220. More heated debate followed, after which supporters of Howat were narrowly defeated in a roll call vote, amidst a turmoil described by one historian as \\"stormy scenes verging on rioting.\\"Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 9, pg. 221. Later union activity The English-born John Brophy, whom Howat supported in 1926 in the last serious effort to unseat John Lewis as head of the UMWA. No United Mine Workers convention was held in 1923, the annual gathering being held over until January 1924, when it was convened in Indianapolis. It was there that once again Alexander Howat attempted to unite delegates in opposition to the well-entrenched president of the union, John L. Lewis. Howat combined with left wing union organizer Powers Hapgood in attempting to organize left wing delegates associated with the Communist Party's trade union mass organization, the Trade Union Educational League (TUEL) as well as anti-Lewis conservatives in an effort to depose Lewis.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 9, pg. 265. The 1924 effort was a wild affair, marked by delegate demonstrations, swarming in the aisles, fist fights, and the copious use of its sergeants-at- arms by the Lewis administration. Chief among the opposition's demands was a call for the election rather than the appointment of union organizers, the election of convention committees by the body as a whole rather than the appointment, the reinstatement of Howat to good graces in the union, and reform of the UMWA's election system.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 9, pp. 265‚Äì266 Decisions were made by a deeply divided convention, amidst accusations of falsification of roll call counts by the so- called \\"Lewis machine.\\"Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 9, pg. 266. An attempt by Howat to gain a hearing of his case by the convention was once again ruled out of order by virtue of Howat being neither a delegate nor a union member, although he was allowed the right of making an appeal to the Lewis-controlled Committee on Appeals and Grievances. In desperation Howat attempted to rush the platform to speak, but he was stopped by brawny Lewis supporters and forcefully dragged from the platform. Lewis hastily adjourned the meeting and his supporters departed, leaving Howat and the dissidents control of the hall.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Vol. 9, pg. 267. Howat mounted the platform and delivered a lengthy speech in opposition to Lewis and the standing leadership of the UMWA. The rhetorical triumph proved ephemeral, as Howat and a number of his supporters remained outside of the union, with Lewis firmly retaining control of the organization. In 1924 Howat attended the July convention of the Federated Farmer-Labor Party, an organization sponsored and largely controlled by the Communist Party.C.E. Ruthenberg, \\"Workers and Farmers on the Mark,\\" The Liberator, v. 7, no. 7, whole no. 75 (July 1924), pp. 16‚Äì19, 20‚Äì21. Howat was elected chairman of the governing National Committee by the gathering. In 1926 Howat was a supporter of John Brophy in his attempt to depose Lewis from head of the UMWA. This effort, too, ended in failure. In the aftermath of this defeat William Z. Foster of TUEL attempted to carry on the fight against the Lewis regime in the UMWA through an organized faction called the Save the Union Committee.Edward P. Johanningsmeier, Forging American Communism: The Life of William Z. Foster. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1994; pg. 240. A preliminary conference to establish this group was called in January 1928, attended by 125 delegates, of whom about 20% were Communist Party members. Brophy accepted a place as chairman of this session, although Howat declined playing a public role in this anti-Lewis opposition movement in the hopes that he would eventually be reinstated to the UMWA. The Save the Union Committee held its formal founding convention in Pittsburgh on April 1, 1928, attended by 1100 delegates. The gathering planned a strategic strike of three coal pits in Western Pennsylvania which, if successful, would both bolster ongoing strikes throughout the region as well as establish credibility and prestige for the new miners' reform movement. Sensing that Foster's actual intention was to split the United Mine Workers and establish a new union, both Howat and Brophy moved away from the Save the Union Committee shortly after its formation.Johanningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pg. 241. By the end of the summer the Save the Union Committee strike had come to a conclusion and a new miners' union was indeed formed, the National Miners' Union, the first of a number of dual unions promoted by the Communist Party and its trade union auxiliary group headed by Foster.Johanningsmeier, Forging American Communism, pg. 242. Despite his wariness towards the new radical union, Howat was never readmitted to the UMWA, however, and his trade union career effectively came to an end. Later years With his more than two decades in the American trade union movement abruptly terminated by expulsion, Howat began a series of other jobs, working in the 1930s and 1940s as a Kansas state border guard, editor of a labor newspaper, and gaining employment as a city employee of Pittsburg, Kansas.

Born in Adams County, Illinois to John Milton Morgan and Mary (Gooding) Morgan, Morgan was educated in the country schools of Bourbon County, Kansas, later attending the Kansas Normal College at Fort Scott. In 1890, when twenty years of age, he set out to win a fortune in the far west. Making his way to Idaho, he located at Moscow in Latah County and secured employment on ranches in that vicinity. During the winter of 1890-91 he took up the study of law, and was admitted to the bar on October 9, 1894. In the interim, he became a deputy sheriff of Latah County, serving in that position from 1 January 1893, until 1895, when he began practice. He served as a Democrat in the state legislature from 1897 to 1899, and in 1897 was also appointed private secretary to Henry Heitfeld, United States senator, and continued in that position for five years or until 1902, spending most of the period in Washington, D.C. While there, he pursued a course in the law department of Georgetown University, receiving an LL.M. in 1899. Morgan's brother Albert was also an Idaho lawyer, and the brothers were law partners at various times. Although they were closely associated in their professional and social interests, they had opposite political views, Morgan being a Democrat and his brother being a staunch Republican. Morgan served as mayor of Moscow from 1906-1908, and returned to the state legislature from 1911 to 1913, serving as the minority leader in the House. In 1914 he was elected to the Idaho Supreme Court, and by natural rotation became Chief Justice on January 1, 1919. Morgan resigned from the Idaho Supreme Court in 1920, returning to private practice. However, he defeated incumbent Justice Bertram S. Varian to return to the Idaho Supreme Court in 1933,\\"Justice faces unusual election challenge\\", The Spokesman-Review (April 24, 2000), p. 5. and served his death at age 72 in 1942. Personal life Morgan married Emma May Friedline of Moscow on July 22, 1895. They had two daughters, Pearl and Grace, and a son, Arthur Percival, who died at the age of seventeen months.

He is the principal owner and managing general partner of the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). , Davis has an estimated $500 million net worth. Early years Davis was born in Brooklyn, New York to Al and Carol Davis. Davis is a graduate of California State University, Chico. Prior to owning the team, Davis was involved in the retail part of the Raiders' business where he helped develop the organization's Raider Image stores. He also spent time in the Raiders equipment department where he developed the muff-style hand warmer for football. In 1980, Davis represented Raiders player Cliff Branch in contract negotiations with the team which resulted in a deal that included an annuity (active until his death in 2019) and got Mark kicked out of his father's house for being too close to the players. He later lived with Branch when the team moved to Los Angeles. Professional sports Oakland / Las Vegas Raiders Davis inherited the team after the death of his father, Al Davis, in 2011. Davis with his mother, Carol, owns a 47 percent share of the Raiders, which is contractually structured to give them controlling interest. Davis has day-to-day control of the team. Davis gained control of the team towards the end of the Raiders lease with the Oakland Coliseum, a facility that dates back to 1965 and had multiple issues due to its age. It was also at the time the only facility that still housed both a Major League Baseball and NFL team, a major point of contention for both leagues. Relocation to Las Vegas Davis put himself in charge of an effort to establish a new stadium for the Raiders, an issue that his father Al was never able to solve in his tenure as owner. He initially stated a desire to keep the Raiders in Oakland (preferably on the Coliseum site) or the immediate area. Due to the lack of a stadium plan, Davis began to communicate with representatives in other cities such as Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Las Vegas. In late February 2015, Davis announced that the Raiders would pursue a shared stadium in Carson, California, with Dean Spanos and the San Diego Chargers. Davis cited the proposal as the result of years of talks with Oakland city officials that ultimately led nowhere. While the Chargers have historically been inter-divisional rivals, he recognized that Spanos was in a similar position with San Diego city officials and that their partnership could expedite the process of resolving the stadium issue for both franchises. The Los Angeles Times reported that the team's relocation could result in the franchise \\"being worth 150% of its current value\\". On February 23, 2015, while still involved in the Carson project, Mark Davis attended a secret meeting at the UNLV International Gaming Institute to look at Las Vegas sports betting, its effect on pro sports, how it could effect a pro sports team in Vegas and how the Raiders and the NFL could possibly work in Las Vegas. At the time Las Vegas was seen as a long shot candidate for the Raiders. The meeting was set up by Napoleon McCallum, former Raiders player and current Las Vegas Sands employee. In attendance was Davis and McCallum along with then UNLV president Don Snyder and Bo Bernhard, executive director of the International Gaming Institute. The meeting would not be known about until two years later. On April 23, 2015, a new proposal for the Carson stadium was released, outlining several personalized touches for the shared tenants. These include stadium seating changing from navy blue to black depending on which team homefield, as well as a 120-foot tower on the concourse that would serve as a memorial for the late Al Davis for Raiders touchdowns or shoot simulated lightning for Chargers' touchdowns. The Carson stadium proposal also featured sprawling ground-level parking, rather than multi-story carparks, at the request of Davis who insisted that tailgating at a new stadium was a necessity. Davis' and Spanos' proposal directly competed with and eventually lost to Rams' owner Stan Kroenke and his proposed stadium in Inglewood. In 2016, the Carson Stadium design was retained by Davis with the small additions of a roof and black covering instead of silver in a stadium proposal with Sheldon Adelson's Las Vegas Sands Corporation to interests in Las Vegas, Nevada. Until after the Carson vote Davis was also actively working towards a resolution in Oakland. In an interview, he said \\"we are trying everything possible to get something done in Oakland right on the same exact site we're on right now\\". The Oakland stadium proposal called for a smaller 55,000-seat stadium at the current site, with space for commercial development and renovations for the existing BART Station. After a dispute over rent in Oakland where the city raised the rent on the team after the Carson plan failed and a lack of what Davis saw as a credible plan from Oakland, Mark Davis began discussions with Las Vegas. He initially teamed up with Sheldon Adelson to get a stadium in Las Vegas. During Davis' meeting with Adelson, he also visited the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), which included a contingent consisting of the university's president Len Jessup, former university president Donald Snyder, Steve Wynn, and former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) owner Lorenzo Fertitta. The stadium is being proposed to replace Sam Boyd Stadium and would serve as the home of both the Raiders and the UNLV Rebels college football program. A relocation to Las Vegas would be a long-term proposal, as Sam Boyd Stadium is undersized for the NFL and there are no other professional-caliber stadiums in Nevada. Raiders officials were also in Las Vegas to tour locations in the valley for a potential new home; they were also on the 42-acre site of the proposed stadium to ask questions about the site. Interviewed by sports columnist Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News, Davis said that he had a \\"great\\" visit in the city he described it as interesting. Davis also said that Las Vegas was a global city and that \\"it's absolutely an NFL city,\\" as well as saying that \\"the Raider brand would do well\\" and \\"I think Las Vegas is coming along slowly\\". On March 21, 2016, when asked about Las Vegas, Davis said, \\"I think the Raiders like the Las Vegas plan,\\" and \\"it's a very very very intriguing and exciting plan\\", referring to the stadium plan in Las Vegas. Davis also met with Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval about the stadium plan. On April 1, 2016, Davis toured Sam Boyd Stadium to evaluate whether UNLV could serve as a temporary home of the team and was with UNLV football coach Tony Sanchez, athletic director Tina Kunzer-Murphy, adviser Don Snyder and school president Len Jessup to further explore the possibility of the Raiders moving to Las Vegas. On April 28, 2016, Davis said he wanted to move the Raiders to Las Vegas and pledged $500 million toward the construction of a proposed $2.4 billion domed stadium. \\"Together we can turn the Silver State into the silver and black state,\\" Davis said. At a media conference in UNLV's Stan Fulton Building, Davis also said the club had \\"made a commitment to Las Vegas at this point in time and that's where it stands.\\" In an interview with ESPN after returning from a meeting for the 2016 NFL draft he expanded upon reasons why Southern Nevada held a certain appeal over the East Bay of the Oakland‚ÄìSan Francisco Bay Area, how he tried to make it work in Oakland and why (as he told Sandoval) he hopes to turn Nevada into the \\"Silver and Black State\\"; he also spoke of the meeting saying, \\"It was a positive, well-organized presentation that I believe was well-received\\", and stating, \\"It was a very positive step in finding the Raiders a home.\\" On May 20, 2016, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said he would support Davis and the Raiders move to Las Vegas, stating, \\"I think it would be good for the NFL.\\" If the Raiders were to move to Las Vegas the only competition they would have is the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League. On August 11, 2016, Raiders officials met with Northern Nevada officials about the possibility of Reno being the site of a new training camp/practice facility and toured several sites including the University of Nevada, Reno, Reno area high schools, and sports complexes. On August 25, 2016, the Raiders filed a trademark application for \\"Las Vegas Raiders\\" on the same day renderings of a new stadium (located west of Interstate 15 at Las Vegas) were released to the public. On September 15, 2016, the Southern Nevada Tourism Infrastructure Committee unanimously voted to recommend and approve $750 million for the Las Vegas stadium plan. On October 11, 2016, the Nevada Senate voted 16‚Äì5 to approve the funding bill for the Las Vegas stadium proposal. The Nevada Assembly voted 28‚Äì13 three days later to approve the bill to fund the new Las Vegas stadium proposal; two days later, Sandoval signed the funding bill into law. Davis told ESPN on October 15, 2016 that even if the Raiders are approved by the league to relocate to the Las Vegas metropolitan area, the club would play the next two seasons at the Oakland Alameda Coliseum in 2017 and 2018, stating \\"We want to bring a Super Bowl championship back to the Bay Area.\\" The team originally planned to play at a temporary facility in 2019 after its lease at the Coliseum expired, but they were able to get a two-year extension by the Coliseum board in March 2019, with the second year in 2020 tagged on as insurance in case Allegiant Stadium was not ready in time. Davis had also indicated a desire to play at least one preseason game in Las Vegas, at Sam Boyd Stadium, as early as the 2017 season, but this ultimately never came into fruition. On October 17, 2016, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval signed into law Senate Bill 1 and Assembly Bill 1 which approved a hotel room rate tax increase to accommodate $750 million in public funding for the new stadium. The Raiders officially filed paperwork to relocate from Oakland, California, to Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 19, 2017. On January 30, 2017, it was announced that Adelson had dropped out of the stadium project, also withdrawing the Las Vegas Sands' proposed $650 million contribution from the project. Instead, the Raiders would increase their contribution from $500 million to $1.15 billion. One day after Adelson's announcement, Goldman Sachs (the company behind the financing to the proposed Las Vegas stadium) announced its intent to withdraw from the project. On March 6, 2017, the Raiders revealed Bank of America would be replacing the Sheldon Adelson portion of the funding. On March 27, 2017, the National Football League officially approved the Raiders move from Oakland to Las Vegas in a 31‚Äì1 vote, ensuring them a new stadium in the process. Management style In his short ownership of the Raiders, Davis has focused on the business aspects of the team while leaving football matters in the hands of general manager Reggie McKenzie. This form of management is in stark contrast to his father, who was well known as one of the most hands-on owners in professional sports. Al Davis became general manager of the Raiders in 1966 after returning from a short stint as AFL commissioner, a post he kept after becoming principal owner in 1972. He exercised close control over both business and football matters until his death. In 2013, Davis fired the Raiders public relations director because of a Sports Illustrated article that was critical of Davis' father. Davis stated that the director's replacement needed to understand the importance of his father's legacy and actively protect it. On domestic violence in the NFL Davis spoke out publicly on the issue of domestic violence in the NFL, following San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Ray McDonald's arrest on August 31, 2014. Davis disagreed with Jed York's decision to keep McDonald on the active roster, proposing that the league should suspend any player arrested with pay while \\"the investigation moves forward\\" This was the first proposal of this kind following the Ray Rice assault video surfacing, that specifically called for an immediate suspension of players rather than leaving the decision to suspend up to the respective franchises themselves. In March 2015, Davis again went public on the issue of domestic violence, shutting down rumors that the Raiders' started negotiations with Greg Hardy, who was convicted on domestic abuse charges earlier that year. The Raiders' organization has traditionally been vocal about domestic violence issues, with direct involvement with the Tracey Biletnikoff Foundation, created by Hall of Famer Fred Biletnikoff to support community substance abuse treatment and domestic violence programs. On social justice and player protests Davis has spoken out publicly on the controversial National Anthem protests in the NFL, where players kneel during the playing of the pre-game National Anthem to protest social injustice and police brutality on African Americans. Davis originally preferred his players to stand, but after comments made by President Donald Trump calling protesting players \\"Sons of Bitches\\" and saying they should be fired for kneeling, Davis changed his stance. In a public statement the following weekend he stated, \\"About a year ago before our Tennessee game I met with Derek Carr and Khalil Mack to ask their permission to have Tommie Smith light the torch for my father before the game in Mexico City,\\" Davis told ESPN's Paul Gutierrez. \\"I explained to them I was asking their permission because I had previously told them that I would prefer that they not protest while in Raiders uniform. And should they have something to say once their uniform was off, I might go up there with them. Over the last year, though,\\" Davis continued, \\"the streets have gotten hot and there has been a lot of static in the air and recently fuel has been added to the fire. I can no longer ask our team not to say something while they are in a Raider uniform. The only thing I can ask them to do is do it with class. Do it with pride. Not only do we have to tell people there is something wrong, we have to come up with answers. That's the challenge that's in front of us as Americans and as human beings.\\" In May 2018, Davis abstained from an NFL owner resolution on the anthem protests that called for players to stand or stay in the locker room until after the anthem is played or face a team fine for kneeling, locking arms or raising their fist. Davis abstained along with San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York after speaking out on social justice issues to the other owners. Personal life Davis says he is a food connoisseur and has said that his favorite restaurants include Dan Tana's in Los Angeles, California, Joe's Stone Crab in Miami Beach, Florida, and P.F. Chang's. Davis is known for his signature bowl haircut and for driving a 1997 Dodge Caravan SE which is outfitted with a bubble-top Mark III conversion kit as well as a VHS player mounted to the ceiling. Davis donated $10,000 to the Gridiron PAC between 2016 and 2017.

All click types (alveolar , dental , lateral , palatal , retroflex , and labial ) have glottalized variants. They are very common: All of the Khoisan languages of Africa have them (the Khoe, Tuu, and Kx'a language families, Sandawe, and Hadza), as does Dahalo and the Bantu languages Yeyi and Xhosa (though Zulu does not).Derek Nurse, The Bantu Languages, p 616 They are produced by making a glottal stop (the catch in the throat in the middle of English uh-oh!), which stops the flow of air, and then using the front of the tongue to make the click sound in the middle of the glottal stop. Glottalized nasal clicks In all languages which have them, glottalized clicks are nasalized, though a few have non-nasal glottalized clicks as well. Glottalized nasal clicks are formed by closing the glottis so that the click is pronounced in silence; however, the nasal passage is left open (the velum is lowered), and any preceding vowel will be nasalized. They are typically transcribed something like ' or ' or ', and often !‚Äô word-initially but n!‚Äô between vowels. In Khoekhoe they are written with the single letters «É «Å «Ä «Ç, in Ju«Ä‚Äôh√µa, as «É‚Äô «Å‚Äô «Ä‚Äô «Ç‚Äô with a preceding nasal vowel, in Sandawe as q‚Äô x‚Äô c‚Äô, in Hadza as qq xx cc, and in Xhosa as nkc nkx nkq. When full glottal closer is made, there is no nasal airflow during the click itself, and there is a period of silence after the click and before the pronunciation of the vowel. That is, they are pronounced , etc. However, in many languages the glottal closure is not complete, in which case they are pronounced with accompanying voiceless nasal airflow and transcribed , etc. A more general transcription is ; superscripting the nasal and glottal components indicates that they are articulated simultaneously with the click and not adjacent to it. Initially and in citation form, the nasal component may be inaudible. That is, in this position glottalized clicks differ from plain (tenuis) clicks in the gap between click and vowel (the voice onset time), and from aspirated clicks in that this gap is silent rather than noisy. In canonical form, a glottal stop occurs between the release of the click and the start of the following vowel. However, in practice the glottalization often 'leaks', with a creaky-voiced transition into the vowel. However, in medial position or embedded in a phrase after a vowel the nasalization can usually be heard: any preceding vowel will be nasalized or the click will be prenasalized. This is somewhat similar to aspirated nasal clicks, though in the later case the nasal airflow continues through the click itself. In neither case is the following vowel normally nasalized, something which occurs with simple nasal clicks in languages like G«Äui.  Ejective clicks In a few languages‚ÄîG«Äui, Taa, «Ç‚ÄôAmkoe, and, in Miller's analysis, Yeyi‚Äîthere is in addition a series of oral, non-contour glottalized clicks. These have been described as ejective in the cases of G«Äui and Taa, and Nakagawa (2006) transcribes the two series of glottalized clicks as glottalized ( in earlier publications) vs. ejective . Miller (2011) treats them as differing in nasality rather than in the type of glottalization.Amanda Miller, 2011. \\"The Representation of Clicks\\". In Oostendorp et al. eds., The Blackwell Companion to Phonology. Miller treats the glottalization in these clicks as phonation, so that both oral and nasal clicks occur with five phonations: tenuis, voiced, aspirated, murmured (breathy voiced), and glottalized. Other types of glottalized clicks Other series of glottalized clicks have only been reported from two languages, Taa and «Ç‚ÄôAmkoe. Taa distinguishes the singular and plural of many nouns via a voiceless vs. voiced initial consonant, and thus there are voiced and voiceless versions of the glottalized nasal and oral clicks. In the voiced versions the glottalization is delayed, so that the hold of the click is partially voiced or nasalized: that is, vs. and vs .Naumann, Christfied (2008). \\"The Consonantal System of West !Xoon\\". 3rd International Symposium on Khoisan Languages and Linguistics. Riezlern. The release of the voiced glottal click is \\"creaky\\", as the voiceless nasal often is. In Miller's treatment of phonation, this is perhaps a morphological contrast superimposed on the basic five-phonation system. Preglottalized nasal clicks A few languages also have preglottalized nasal clicks. These are pronounced like ordinary voiced nasal clicks, but are preceded by a very short period of prenasalization that has a glottal-stop onset. They are considered unitary consonants, and not sequences of glottal stop plus nasal click. They are reported from Taa, Ekoka !Kung, and «Ç‚ÄôAmkoe. (Taa and Ekoka !Kung also have preglottalized nasals .) In one dialect of G«Äui, glottalized nasal clicks before pharyngealized vowels have become preglottalized nasal clicks, perhaps under the influence of «Ç‚ÄôAmkoe.

The Lindeman-Sobel Approach was pioneered by Henry Lindeman (July 28, 1902 ‚Äì March 7, 1961), an American woodwind player and member of the Paul Whiteman Orchestra, and expanded by Phil Sobel (May 13, 1917 ‚Äì September 14, 2008), first chair woodwind with the NBC staff orchestra, leader of the West Coast Saxophone Quartet and a student of Henry Lindeman from 1935 to 1946. Los Angeles Times. (10/1/2008) \\"Philip Sobel Obituary\\"Kyle, Robert (Jan/Feb 2001). \\"Getting intimate with the sax and Phil Sobel\\" \\"The Saxophone Journal\\" (Vol 25, number 3) __TOC__ Summary According to the Lindeman-Sobel Approach music is sound in motion and that sound is created when the air stream (or bow) meets the fingers. The Lindeman-Sobel Approach seeks to create an awareness in the individual of how their sound is being played rhythmically relative to the resistance of the tube length and the notes on the page. Motion and rhythm A fundamental tenet of the Lindeman-Sobel Approach is that the general tendency among musicians is to hold long notes too long and make short notes too short. \\"When you hold a note too long, it causes you to miss your next entrance and consequently, you may rush to make up for lost time. Music is made up of entrances. If you are constantly in motion, you won't miss your entrances and you won't have to rush to make up for lost time. Most musicians are constantly rushing because they are constantly late. We put weight on the wrong notes.....We play the long notes too long and the short notes too short.\\" ‚Äì Phil Sobel ‚Äì March 1999. The Lindeman-Sobel Approach also contains an emphasis on being aware of note groupings. This awareness involves placing a greater weight on the downbeats of groupings and bars. \\"It's not about keeping up with the metronome (or the beat), it's about playing the correct mathematical combinations and always moving forward and going somewhere!\\" ‚Äì Phil Sobel ‚Äì March 1999 Fingers Being in touch with the fingers and aware of our fingers can have a significant impact on sound. If we lose this awareness of the fingers then we become disconnected from the instrument and the sound suffers. Phil Sobel said, speaking about great saxophonists \\"they all have great fingers. Fingers that are intimate with the instrument. Fingers that barely move and are always in touch with the horn. What did they know that most saxophonists do not? That the speed at which you put down or pick up a finger affects the sound and the pitch of the note. The distance from an open saxophone key to a closed key is very minimal, so any extra distance, i.e. starting with the finger above the key but not yet on the key is a waste of motion. The opposite is true also, that in opening a key if you actually lift your finger off of the key and come out of contact with the instrument, you have now wasted energy and motion in two directions because now you will have to get back down on the key to play it again. It is impossible not to see how much motion most saxophonists waste because they don't pay enough attention to their fingers.\\" Timbre Timbre is viewed as a combination of sound and pitch. This is because if a note is out of tune it will not have a great sound. Rhythm is the glue that holds the sound together. Without rhythm to coordinate the air, tongue, embouchure, slide, fingers, bow, etc. the sound will not resonate at its full potential. The Lindeman-Sobel Approach also emphasizes an awareness of the resistances that occur naturally within the instrument and how those relate to where you are on the instrument and where you are going.

Overview 7MW Solar EOR project in Amal, Oman Generating steam for EOR using concentrated solar power GlassPoint's enclosed trough technology encloses lightweight mirrors in a standard agricultural greenhouse, concentrating the sun's energy to create steam. The company's solar thermal technology uses trough-shaped mirrors, standard piping and a greenhouse structure. By using the enclosed trough architecture, GlassPoint claims it can produce emission-free steam for two to three times less than competing concentrated solar power technologies, such as the power tower and linear fresnel. The company is based in Fremont, California, with offices in Bakersfield, California, Muscat, Oman, Kuwait City, Kuwait and Shenzhen, China. In December 2012, GlassPoint announced $26 million in Series B financing. Investors in the round included Royal Dutch Shell, RockPort Capital, Nth Power and Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital. In September 2014, GlassPoint announced $53 million in Series C financing. Investors in the round included Royal Dutch Shell, State General Reserve Fund of Oman, RockPort Capital, Nth Power and Chrysalix Energy Venture Capital. To date, GlassPoint has a total of $86.7 million in funding.https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/glasspoint-solar It was announced that GlassPoint Solar was to be liquidated in May 2020, the company citing low and unpredictable oil and gas prices for the decision. Projects Berry Petroleum The world's first solar EOR project, operated by Berry Petroleum Company in Kern Country, CA, USA. In 2011, GlassPoint deployed the world's first commercial solar EOR project at an oilfield operated by Berry Petroleum in Kern County, Calif., USA. Built in less than six weeks, the system uses the sun's radiant heat to produce approximately 1 million British Thermal Units (Btus) per hour of solar heat. GlassPoint partnered with local firms TJ Cross Engineers and PCL Industrial Services, as well as San Francisco based REM Design, to construct the system, which spans 7,000 square feet of land on the 100-year-old oilfield. The enclosed trough system preheats water to 190 ¬∞F used as feedwater for Berry Petroleum's gas-fired steam generators. Petroleum Development Oman A solar enhanced oil recovery project commissioned by Petroleum Development Oman In May 2013, GlassPoint commissioned the Middle East's first solar EOR project, a 7MWth system developed in partnership with Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), the largest oil company in the Sultanate of Oman. The system produces an average of 50 tons of emissions-free steam daily. operated successfully for more than 4 years, generating an average of 50 tons of emissions-free steam per day that fed directly into existing thermal EOR operations at PDO's Amal West oilfield. The system was completed on time, on budget, and with no Lost Time Injuries demonstrating GlassPoint and PDO's shared commitment to health, safety, security and the environment (HSSE). During the first 12 months of operations, actual performance of the GlassPoint system matched output models within a few percent and steam production continues to exceed contracted performance targets. The system recorded 98.6% uptime and maintained regular operations during severe dust and sand storms. The automated roof-washing unit proved particularly effective in all weather events, restoring system performance overnight. The project served as a performance and operational baseline for larger steam generators in Oman and provided PDO with valuable information for planning potential large-scale projects in the future. In July 2015, Petroleum Development Oman and GlassPoint Solar announced that they signed an agreement to build a 1 GWth solar field. The total solar field will be 1.8 km and the total project will be 3 km. The project, named Miraah, will be the world's largest solar field measured by peak thermal capacity. In August 2017, GlassPoint and its contractors crossed the threshold of 1.5 million man-hours worked without lost time injury (LTI) at Miraah. In November 2017, GlassPoint and Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) completed construction on the first block of the Miraah solar plant safely on schedule and in line with budget, and successfully delivered steam to the Amal West oilfield. As of November 2018, the first 100 MWt of Miraah are operating and meeting all performance targets.  Belridge Solar  In November 2017, Aera Energy and GlassPoint Solar announced a joint project to create California's largest solar energy field. Located at the South Belridge Oil Field, the project, called Belridge Solar, will be the first in the world to incorporate solar steam generation with solar electricity generation. The Belridge Oil Field resides near Bakersfield, California. Once completed, the facility is projected to produce 12 million barrels of steam annually through a 850MW thermal solar steam generator. It is planned to reduce the natural gas used at the Belridge Oil Field for the production and extraction of heavy oil in its enhanced oil recovery process (EOR). Additionally, a separate 26.5 MW electricity generating facility using photovoltaic panels is planned to power oilfield operations. A rendering of the Belridge facility, which, when done, will be the largest in California. This new facility is predicted to reduce carbon emissions by more than 376,000 metric tons annually. This will offset more than one-third of all the cars driven in Bakersfield. It is also expected to create hundreds of jobs throughout California. This project highlights a growing trend of oil and gas companies partnering with the solar energy industry.  Occidental Petroleum of Oman  In November 2018, GlassPoint and Occidental Petroleum of Oman signed an agreement to cooperate on a solar thermal project to facilitate oil production on an oilfield in the Sultanate of Oman. The agreement outlines plans to generate up to 100,000 barrels of solar steam per day for heavy oil production at Mukhaizna oilfield. The proposed solar thermal plant would exceed two gigawatts and could save more than 800,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions each year. Occidental of Oman would purchase the steam under a long-term off-take agreement, providing a cost-effective, zero-emissions alternative to steam generated using natural gas. In-country value Glasspoint introduced the concept of an enclosed trough to EOR GlassPoint claims its technology can help oil operators free natural gas currently burned for oil production. This gas can be redirected to higher value applications, such as desalination, industrial development or export as LNG, thus increasing economic well-being. New supply chains associated with solar industries can generate significant societal value as well.  GlassPoint Innovation Spur  In January 2018, GlassPoint signed a collaboration agreement with a host of partners to establish its corporate social responsibility initiative, the ‚ÄòGlassPoint Innovation Spur‚Äô. The program is set to contribute and sustainably drive innovation within Oman's renewable energy and water management sectors. The list of partners includes The Research Council (TRC), Innovation Park Muscat (IPM), Public Authority for SME Development (Riyada) and Sharakah. An intensive full-cycle incubation program, the GlassPoint Innovation Spur will provide aspiring Omani entrepreneurs with an integrated ecosystem of scientific, technical and business support. The two-year program will equip participants with valuable skills through coaching and mentorship, as they transform their innovations into implementable businesses. Robust screening, selection, and testing criteria is in place to ensure originality and economic feasibility. Selected entrepreneurs will receive practical support to further develop their inventions and establish businesses before being linked to investors.  SolaRISE Technology Center  In September 2018, GlassPoint Solar in partnership with Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) announced a new technology center. The joint initiative is called SolaRISE for Solar Research, Innovation, and Sustainability in Energy. It was formed to develop and test solar technologies in oil fields. Researchers will focus on cutting costs and automating operations. The center also will pilot and evaluate solar energy uses for other industrial processes in Oman and worldwide.

The legislation called for many restrictions regarding the restrooms of any public buildings built within Wheelock city limits. History In a meeting in early May 1952, council member Gene Hill proposed a piece of legislation which essentially put restrictions on the specifications of restrooms in all public buildings. His request (labeled Proposition 411) passed with a council vote of 4‚Äì1 and was put into effect a week later. The legislation stated that: * Fresh soap must be present in every bathroom * Only non-wooden stall doors could be used * Modern plumbing must be installed in all establishments Proposition 411 also: * Prevented the building of 'co-ed' bathrooms (family bathrooms) * Contained constraints regarding the size of men's and women's bathrooms But the most famous and talked about aspect of Proposition 411 was that it also banned the use of urinals or 'tank-less' toilets from public bathrooms. Called the 'anti- urinal' bill by locals, the bill was the first of its kind in the whole state of Texas to impose local limitations to public restrooms. It was mentioned briefly by the nearby Bryan Eagle and Robertson County Gazette as well as in the inaugural edition of Mad magazine. According to local historian Jennette Rivers, the townspeople were wary of the relatively new technology for several reasons. One of the reasons was that there were many falsified accounts of urinal related injury spreading throughout the town. The townspeople were wary of this new technology and its potential harmful impact and were susceptible to believing rumors regarding health risks involved with urinal use. Another worry to the community was the lack of privacy associated with urinals. Urinals were more exposed than the traditional stalls or outhouses and this was considered immodest by the elders of what was a heavily Protestant community. Proposition 411 was still enacted as of February 2011.

His career was seriously damaged by the Rebellion of Silken Thomas, in which several members of his family played a leading part, and he narrowly escaped permanent disgrace. Background and early career He belonged to an Anglo-Irish family which had long been settled at Moyglare, County MeathBall, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 1 p.193 He was a cousin of Sir Walter Delahide, who married Janet FitzEustace, an aunt of Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare. The FitzGerald family had been almost all-powerful in Irish politics since the 1470s, but the ruling class eventually split into pro- Kildare (Geraldine) and anti-Kildare factions. Given their close family ties, it was natural for Richard to look to the Earl of Kildare to advance his career. Though little is known of his legal practice, it was almost certainly on Kildare's nomination that he was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in 1514; he held that office for 20 years, though he was threatened with removal in 1529. He was also made Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer in 1533.Ball, p.193 Silken Thomas Rebellion The Geraldine connection proved disastrous for Delahide when, on the false report of his father's death, the 9th Earl of Kildare's son and heir Thomas, nicknamed \\"Silken Thomas\\" rebelled against Henry VIII. The judge pleaded that he was completely loyal to the Crown, but apart from his own ties to the FitzGerald family, the main supporters, if not instigators, of the rebellion were the Delahides of Moyclare. The \\"most false disloyal traitor\\" James Delahide,An Act for the Attainder of the Earl of Kildare and others 28 Hen. VIII c.1 described as Thomas FitzGerald's \\"principal counsellor in all his doings\\"Act for the Attainder of the Earl of Kildare was the son of Richard's cousin Walter, and James' parents and brothers were also said to be involved in the rebellion. Inevitably, Richard was removed from office both as Chief Justice and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Later career Judging by his letters to Thomas Cromwell, Delahide seemed less concerned at the risk being prosecuted for treason than with the loss of his public offices. Elrington Ball Ball, pp.124-5 quotes his abject letter to Cromwell in 1534 in which Delahide denied that he had ever slandered Cromwell : in good faith I never spoke nor thought to speak any such thoughts...I know it well ye be of our Sovereign Lord's Privy Council and as high in his favour as any man. He greatly resented the loss of the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer to Thomas Cusack but grudgingly conceded: I would have been contented that he should have enjoyed the same accordingly though it had rightfully been mine own. Delahide's main concern was to be restored to the office of Chief Justice : he wrote that there is labours made for mine office of Justiceship wherein I have truly to the best of my little power served the King's Grace by the space of 20 years trusting that there shall be no good cause proved why his Grace should (re)move me from the same.Ball, pp.124-5 Delahide's pleas were partly successful: although he was not restored to office as Chief Justice, in 1537 he was made Chief Baron, and held that office until his death in 1540.Ball, p.193 Personal life He married Jenet Plunket, daughter of Christopher Plunkett and granddaughter of his predecessor as Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, Sir Thomas Plunket; they had at least one son, George. Richard lived partly at Loughshinny and partly at the Castle of the Ward. His widow and son were still living at the Ward in 1542 but soon afterwards it came into possession of Lord Howth.

Modular's DISPATCH Fleet Management System is available in eight languages, and has been deployed at more than 250 active mine sites; among these are nine of the ten highest-producing surface mines in the world. Modular Mining was founded in Tucson, Arizona, in 1979. Over the next two years, Modular Mining developed and successfully implemented the DISPATCH system, a computerized fleet management system designed to optimize haul truck assignments to loading and dumping points in an open-pit mine and to produce operating reports during the shift. Following the DISPATCH system's development, Modular Mining has gone on to create a number of other software and hardware products that seek to improve different areas of mine operations. In 1996, Komatsu America Corporation (KAC) of Rolling Meadows, Illinois, in concert with their parent company, heavy equipment manufacturer Komatsu, Limited, of Tokyo, Japan (Komatsu), acquired a controlling interest in Modular Mining. In 2003, KAC acquired the remaining shares of the company, and today Modular Mining remains a wholly owned Komatsu subsidiary. History First Installations From 1980 to 1981, Modular worked with Phelps Dodge Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold since 2007) to develop and install the first version of the DISPATCH system at the company's open-pit copper mine in Tyrone, New Mexico. Following this implementation, Phelps Dodge conducted a productivity study on the system, showing a 10% production increase. In 1985, Phelps Dodge contracted Modular Mining to develop and install a DISPATCH system tailored to the rail operation at its mine in Morenci, Arizona, and the company also had the system installed at El Chino Mine in Santa Rita, New Mexico. Global Growth Following initial installations in the Southwestern U.S., Modular Mining went on to install the DISPATCH System at various mines around the world. International customers included Iron Ore Co. of Canada (IOC) at Labrador in 1985; Palabora Mining Co. Ltd. in South Africa in 1985, and the Cerrej√≥n mine in Colombia in 1988. After a decade of rising industry demand for the DISPATCH system, Modular established its first subsidiary, Modular Mining Systems, Pty. Ltd., in Caboolture, Australia in 1989 to support its expanding Australasian customer base. The Australia office was relocated to Tuggerah, Australia in 1993. Modular has established the following global subsidiaries: * 1989 ‚Äì Modular Mining Systems, Pty.

In October 2010, Modular announced its two-hundredth customer: Vale S.A.‚Äôs Moatize mine, an open-pit coalmine in Tete Province, Mozambique, which marked the third greenfield mine that year to implement Modular technology. Recent innovations from Modular have come in the areas of machine guidance, remote vital signs monitoring, and mine safety. Products The IntelliMine Suite Modular provides software applications and hardware products designed to enhance mining operations‚Äô productivity, safety, and equipment availability/utilization. The core Modular product line, the IntelliMine integrated asset management suite, includes the following products: *Modular Mining's flagship product, the DISPATCH Fleet Management system (FMS) for open-pit mines, has become established as a standard for fleet management software in the mining industry. At its core, the system optimizes haul truck assignments, reducing truck queuing at loading and dumping locations, through the use of multiple optimization algorithms, including linear programming, best path, and dynamic programming. A mine's dispatcher uses the system to centrally manage mine operations, including equipment allocation, shift change, refueling, and equipment downtime events. Other features of the system include GPS-based equipment positioning, equipment health monitoring, maintenance tracking, blending, and production reporting. The DISPATCH system enables real-time, computerized, central management of mine operations to maximize production and efficiency, while increasing safety and control. *The DISPATCH Underground system, first deployed in 1991, is the only fully integrated mine management technology for underground operations. The system uses rugged field computer components designed for underground mining environments. DISPATCH Underground supports all major underground mining methods and processes, providing tools for inventory and material movement, crew management, and fleet monitoring, and location management. *The MineCare maintenance management system is a software application designed to minimize maintenance response time, perform predictive and reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), provide critical failure analysis information, and report key performance indicators (KPIs) to mine maintenance personnel in real time. Modular offers over 175 interfaces to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) systems, giving operators access to equipment data, and allowing maintenance personnel to monitor the health of components such as engines, hydraulics, electrical systems, and tires. The MineCare system has helped save considerable maintenance costs and equipment downtime at mining operations around the world. *The ProVision machine guidance system utilizes high-precision Global Navigation Satellite Systems or GNSS (including GPS and GLONASS) to enhance safety, provide reporting and immediate operator feedback, highlight opportunities for improvement initiatives, and reduce operating costs. ProVision technology is available for excavators, loaders, backhoes, drills, and dozers. To improve safety, the ProVision system offers features such as the Proximity Detection module, which is designed to alert equipment operators of encroaching equipment, hazards, and keep-out zones by use of GNSS and on-board camera.\\"Camera Ready.\\" *The RoadMap position and safety tracking system enhances safety for light vehicles at mine sites. It monitors light vehicle positions and provides real-time awareness of changing conditions to visitors and mine personnel. Any equipment with a RoadMap system installed continuously tracks its own position using GPS, comparing it in real time to a preconfigured road network. The basic configuration uses a PDA with internal GPS receiver. Autonomous Haulage Systems From early on, the development of autonomous (driverless) haulage systems (AHS), i.e. vehicle automation has played a significant role in Modular Mining's affiliation with Komatsu. In November 2011, multinational mining and resources company Rio Tinto signed an agreement with Komatsu Limited for the purchase of 150 autonomous haul trucks, to be implemented into the company's Western Australian Pilbara operations by the end of 2015. The deal marked the first large-scale commercial deployment of autonomous haulage in mining, and came as a major milestone for Modular as a company. Modular's contribution to the Komatsu AHS includes: the supervisory system, operational intelligence, communications infrastructure, operation reporting, and vehicle-interaction safety technologies. This implementation of autonomous haulage has been credited with the ability to create high-tech jobs and help improve mine productivity, safety, and environmental performance. Presence in Underground Mining In 1991, Modular Mining Systems developed and installed the world's first underground fleet management system at a diamond mine in South Africa. The DISPATCH Underground system increased productivity by detecting equipment positions in real time using infrared beacons, as well as by operator interaction with a field computer on board the Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) machines used to extract ore-bearing rock. Field information from the on-board computers was delivered to the central server. Today, some of the world's largest underground mining operations use DISPATCH Underground to proactively manage underground mining equipment. Solution was updated in 2016 according to the recent market requirements. ModularReady OEM Interfaces Modular has relationships with all major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of heavy equipment in mining to provide asset health monitoring. ModularReady interfaces allow 3rd-party systems to interface with IntelliMine products. In total, Modular has over 175 interfaces that provide thousands of parameters to issue payload readings, automate haul cycle events, issue OEM and user-defined alarms, and analyze trends that indicate impending equipment failure. ModularReady interfaces provide the ability to aggregate min, max, and average parameter readings, streaming them to central applications such as MineCare for use in RCM analysis. Services Value Added Services Modular provides value-added services, to help mines discover and address areas for improvement in various parts of mine operations and maintenance. The Modular Value Add Services (VAS) division specializes in design, implementation, and optimization of mine management systems, for both surface and underground mines. Services include product user training, consulting, business process mapping (BPM), performance benchmarking, change management, and lean services, among others. In April 2011, Modular expanded its offer of change management and lean to all customers worldwide.

History  Originally catered to students attending North American institutions of higher learning (US and Canada, excluding Quebec), the contest is currently running in separate countries across the globe (30 to date). The goal of the contest is to provide students with the opportunity to experience working with mainframes. The contest was created in part to increase the number of mainframe skilled individuals in the computing workforce. The North American contest has successfully completed 7 contests to date.  Contest  The contest that runs for North America typically starts during the Fall semester and runs until the end of December. It is separated into 3 parts in which each part increases in complexity. Part 1 introduces the contestants to the basic aspects necessary to get started with mainframe technologies and requires minimal time to complete. Part 2 on the other hand involves more steps for each tasks and usually takes a day or so to accomplish. The first 60 winners of Part 2 will receive monetary prize in recognition of their achievement. Lastly, part 3 is more in depth and may involve multiple programming challenges such as COBOL, REXX, JCL, etc. (depending on the questions set for the year's challenge).  Prizes  Past winners of Part 3 have receive gifts such as iPad, iPod, laptops or netbooks. Winners also receives an all-expense- paid trip to the IBM mainframe facility in Poughkeepsie, New York.

It was developed in Moscow, Russia at the Institute for Information Transmission Problems (:ru:–ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞—á–∏ –∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∏–º. –ê. –ê. –•–∞—Ä–∫–µ–≤–∏—á–∞ –†–ê–ù). It is a rule-based system which uses the Meaning-Text Theory as its theoretical foundation. At present, there are several applications of ETAP-3, such as a machine translation tool, a converter of the Universal Networking Language, an interactive learning tool for Russian language learners and a syntactically annotated corpus of Russian language. Demo versions of some of these tools are available online. Machine translation tool The ETAP-3 machine translation tool can translate text from English into Russian and vice versa. It is a rule-based system which makes it different from the most present-day systems that are predominantly statistical-based. The system makes a syntactical analysis of the input sentence which can be visualized as a syntax tree. The machine translation tool uses bilingual dictionaries which contain more than 100,000 lexical entries. UNL converter The UNL converter based on ETAP-3 can transform English and Russian sentences into there representations in UNL (Universal Networking Language) and generate English and Russian sentences from their UNL representations. Russian language treebank A syntactically annotated corpus (treebank) is a part of Russian National Corpus. It contains 40,000 sentences (600,000 words) which are fully syntactically and morphologically annotated. The primary annotation was made by ETAP-3 and then manually verified by competent linguists. This makes the syntactically annotated corpus a reliable tool for linguistic research. Lexical functions learning tool The ETAP-3 system makes extensive use of lexical functions explored in the Meaning-Text Theory. For this reason, an interactive tool for Russian language learners aiming at the acquisition of lexical functions has been developed. Such learning tools are now being created for German, Spanish and Bulgarian References External links Category:Artificial intelligence applications Category:Computational linguistics Category:Machine translation Category:Natural language processing software ","title":"ETAP-3"},{"id":"34340888","text":"Taftafineh Shams Ali (, also Romanized as TƒÅftƒÅfƒ´neh Shams  øAlƒ´; also known as TƒÅftƒÅfƒ´neh) is a village in Teshkan Rural District, Chegeni District, Dowreh County, Lorestan Province, Iran.

Dickson. It is adapted from the play by his friend and investor Joseph Jefferson with Dion Boucicault based on the 1819 story of the same name by Washington Irving. The film features Joseph Jefferson as a ne'er-do-well, who wanders off one day into the Kaatskill mountains where he drinks some of a group odd men's mysterious brew and passes out only to find when waking up that 20 years have passed. The film is compiled from a series of films produced in 1896, which consisted of; *Rip's Toast (AM&B; Cat. #45) *Rip Meets the Dwarf (AM&B; Cat. #46) *Rip and the Dwarf *Rip Leaving Sleepy Hollow (AM&B; Cat. #52) *Rip's Toast to Hudson and Crew *Rip's Twenty Years' Sleep (AM&B; Cat. #50) *Awakening of Rip *Rip Passing Over Hill These films were added to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 1995 and featured on the DVD release More Treasures from American Film Archives, 1894-1931. Production The serial--filmed at Joseph Jefferson's summer home in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts in August 1896-- was filmed in wide shot with a one or two camera setup in 68 mm format with an aspect ratio of 1.36:1. American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. registered the copyright on February 4, 1897. The actor selected scenes that were largely pantomimed, eliminating the need for explanatory titles.  Release  The series was one of the films American Mutoscope offered to customers who purchased their projectors in September 1896. Exhibitors had the option of purchasing any or all of the eight scenes and were free to display them in any order. The films were so popular that the production company (which changed its name to the Biograph Company) edited the scenes into a single feature in 1903. Thanks to hit films like The Kiss (1896), Biograph became one of the most popular studios in the United States.

He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig in 1734 for an unspecified occasion. The text consists of the unchanged words of the hymn by Paul Fleming (1642).  History and words  Bach wrote the chorale cantata in 1734, about a decade after his annual cycle of cantatas, in the same year as his Christmas Oratorio, one year after Kyrie and Gloria of his later Mass in B minor. He dated the manuscript himself, but the occasion is unspecified. The work may have originally been composed for a wedding, because the score shows on top of movement 7 the crossed-out words \\"nach der Trauung\\" (after the wedding). A later copy mentions the fifth Sunday after Trinity. The text consists of nine unchanged stanzas of the chorale by Paul Fleming, published in 1642. The six lines of each stanza rhyme in pairs: 1 and 2, 4 and 5, 3 and 6. The text was written in 1633 at the outset of a \\"long and hazardous journey\\" to Moscow and reflects a \\"beginning in God's name\\". Bach structured nine stanzas in as many movements, framing a sequence of arias and recitatives by an opening chorus and a closing chorale. At least two later performances between 1735 and 1747 are documented.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, two oboes, bassoon, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Chorus: In allen meinen Taten # Aria (bass): Nichts ist es spat und fr√ºhe # Recitative (tenor): Es kann mir nichts geschehen # Aria (tenor): Ich traue seiner Gnaden # Recitative (alto): Er wolle meiner S√ºnden # Aria (alto): Leg ich mich sp√§te nieder # Duet aria (soprano, bass): Hat er es denn beschlossen # Aria (soprano): Ich hab mich ihm ergeben # Chorale: So sei nun, Seele, deine  Music  In the two choral movements, Bach used the melody of the hymn, but composed music unrelated to the melody in the other cantata movements. The poet wrote the words to fit the well-known tune of \\"Innsbruck, ich mu√ü dich lassen\\" by Heinrich Isaac. Bach had used it twice in his St Matthew Passion, in movements 10 (Ich bin's, ich sollte b√º√üen) and 37 (Wer hat dich so geschlagen). In keeping with a beginning, Bach set the opening chorale fantasia in the style of a French overture, in a sequence slow ‚Äì fast (fugue), as he had done already as early as in 1714 in Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 61, beginning a new liturgical year. The slow section, marked grave, in dotted rhythm is instrumental, in the fast section, marked vivace, the orchestra plays a fugue, to which the soprano sings the cantus firmus of the melody line by line in long notes, whereas the lower voices take part in the imitation of the instrumental motifs. After the last line all voices join in an \\"urgent homophonic concluding statement\\". Bach structured the inner movements, named \\"versus\\" (Latin for stanza), as five arias and two recitatives, using the voices from the lowest to the highest, increasing the instrumentation from continuo to obbligato instruments. He kept the structure of the text, two even parts, in all of these movements but the duet which shows a modified da capo form. The recitatives are kept simple, the first (versus 3) is secco, the second (versus 5) is accompanied by the strings. Versus 2 is introduced by a ritornello of the continuo on a theme which the bass picks up. Versus 4 is brightened by a virtuoso violin part, possible as an image of God's grace in \\"Ich traue seiner Gnaden\\" (I trust His grace). John Eliot Gardiner compares the writing for the violin to that in his sonatas and partitas for solo violin. The strings open versus 6 with motifs illustrating rest and motion, which is obvious when the alto sings: \\"Leg ich mich sp√§te nieder\\" (Late do I lie me down), \\"erwache\\" (wake up), \\"lieg oder ziehe fort\\" (lie still or go forth). Versus 7 is set as a duet with continuo. The ritornello begins with a theme later also used by the voices and ends on a characteristic motif illustrating the resolution of \\"... then will I uncomplaining unto my fate press on\\". In the last aria the oboes support the soprano singing in extended melismas \\"I have surrendered myself to Him\\". In the closing chorale, the strings play three independent parts in addition to the four vocal parts, while the oboes play the choral melody, termed \\"augmenting the luminescent harmony\\" by Gardiner. Called by D√ºrr \\"hymnische Kr√∂nung\\" (hymnal crowning), the movement balances the first movement and adds weight to the summarising text of the final stanza, \\"To thee be true, o spirit, and trust in Him alone now who hath created thee\\".

He travelled to Rome in about 957 and became a monk at Fleury Abbey in France. Back in England by 964 he served as a monastic official before being named abbot of Winchcombe Abbey in about 970, a position he was removed from in 975. Germanus may have become abbot of Cholsey Abbey in 992. Early career Although Germanus's name is not Anglo-Saxon, Byrhtferth, a contemporary who wrote the Vita Oswaldi, which contains much information on Germanus, states that he was a native of Winchester. Germanus accompanied Oscytel, the Archbishop of York, and Oswald of Worcester, on their trip to Rome in about 957, purportedly to collect Oscytel's pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority. This journey, however, has been challenged by the historian Donald A. Bullough, who argues that no previous archbishops of York had collected their palliums in person. He also points out that this story is only related in the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis, the chronicle of the Ramsey Abbey.Bullough \\"St Oswald\\" St Oswald of Worcester p. 8 According to the Ramsey story, Oscytel and Oswald returned to England, but Germanus remained on the continent and became a monk at Fleury Abbey in France.Lapidge \\"Germanus\\" Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England pp. 202‚Äì203 Another story has Oswald journeying to Fleury on his own, with Germanus arriving at Fleury after Oswald had been resident at Fleury for a number of years prior to 958.Nightingale \\"Oswald, Fleury and continental reform\\" St Oswald of Worcester p. 24 Return to England In 963 or 964 Germanus was recalled to England by Oswald, who had recently founded a small monastic priory at Westbury-on-Trym. Germanus was named prior of that community and helped with teaching the novice monks.Barrow \\"Community of Worcester\\" St Oswald of Worcester pp. 93‚Äì95 He was also prior of Ramsey Abbey, or perhaps dean,Thacker \\"Saint-making\\" St Oswald of Worcester p. 252 before becoming abbot of Winchcombe Abbey in about 970. Ramsey was founded by moving the monks of Westbury to Ramsey, but Germanus was not named abbot of Ramsey when this move was completed, being named abbot of Winchcombe instead. The reasons for this transfer are unrecorded. He was the first abbot of Winchcombe, but was removed from office in 975,Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 78 as a result of political instability following the death of King Edgar of England in 975, when the monks at Winchcombe were exiled to Ramsey. The Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis states that he became abbot of Cholsey Abbey in 992, and the Vita Oswaldi concurs with this statement. The Vita relates that when Oswald and the lay patron of Ramsey were near to death in 992 they urged the monks to elect Germanus as the next abbot of Ramsey when that office might become vacant. Instead, the monks elected another monk, and the Vita states that King √Üthelred II of England appointed Germanus to Cholsey instead.Barlow English Church p. 102 footnote 2 Some historians have challenged Germanus' appointment to Cholsey, owing to the extreme length of ecclesiastical career this would necessitate.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses pp. 39‚Äì40 Later life and legacy Germanus took part in the translation, or moving, of the relics of St Ivo to Ramsey in 1001 or the following year. He and Eadnoth, the abbot of Ramsey, carried the remains of the saint and his recently discovered companions from where they were found to Ramsey.Thacker \\"Saint-making\\" St Oswald of Worcester pp. 257‚Äì258 The \\"Ramsey Psalter\\" or \\"Psalter of Oswald\\",British Library \\"Detailed record for Harley 2904\\" sometimes known as the \\"Harley Psalter\\", (now British Library manuscript (MS) Harley 2904) and the \\"Cambridge Psalter\\" (now Cambridge University Library MS Ff.1.23) as well as the \\"Sacramentary of Winchcombe\\" (now in Orl√©ans, MS BM 127 (105)) have been connected with his abbacy. Germanus died some time around 1013. The Vita Oswaldi describes him as an expert in monastic affairs; a forged charter later described him as abbot of Fleury, although he never held that office.Nightingale \\"Oswald, Fleury and continental reform\\" St Oswald of Worcester p. 31 Citations References     Further reading * External links * Category:English abbots Category:1010s deaths Category:English Benedictines Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Germanus of Winchester"},{"id":"34340921","text":"Venus Records is a Japanese jazz record label.

Stanton Evans, who asserts that Joseph McCarthy was proper in making accusations of disloyalty, subversion, or treason within the US State Department and the US Army, showing proper regard for evidence (during a period in the late 1940s and 1950s known as McCarthyism or the second Red Scare). Summary The book's premise is that a vast Soviet conspiracy infiltrated the Roosevelt and Truman administrations to create a foreign policy that advanced the spread of world Communism, including the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe and the fall of Nationalist China, which McCarthy exposed, only to have his efforts undermined by political opponents with a vested interest in allowing the conspiracy to continue. The book exhaustively examines, chronicles, and documents the oft- disputed claim that Communist spies, sympathizers and fellow travelers, who were aided and instigated by the Soviet Union and Communist China, infiltrated the administrations of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, to aid in the expansion of Communism throughout the world during the Cold War. The book's footnotes and the references provide links to the documents located in the National Archives and the records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, among other sources. Evans documents the fact that the National Archives copy of at least one of the most critical documents McCarthy submitted to the Congressional boards has been ripped out of its binder and stolen by persons unknown. Evans was able to track down another copy in the private papers of one of the Congressmen involved in the hearings. Much of the information that is cited by Evans was previously classified and unavailable to researchers, but it has now been declassified and is now available publicly. Claims of Communist infiltration and spies within the federal government were further verified by the release of the Venona decrypts and records released by the former Soviet Union's KGB in recent years. Reviews Ronald Radosh, a historian and expert on the Cold War spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, states that \\"rather than a biography, Evans has written a defense counsel's brief for his client, whom he seeks to defend against all the slanders made about McCarthy by his political enemies.\\" He praises Evans' \\"extensive research\\", and his exposure of the political agendas of McCarthy's main opponents and their unwillingness to look more closely into Soviet penetration. He also commends Evans for correcting the view that all of McCarthy's \\"victims\\" were innocent. Radosh severely criticizes McCarthy's failure to distinguish between communists and anti-communist \\"liberals\\", and between those expressing communist or pro-communist views and those working as Soviet agents, and criticizes Evans for glossing over this. Radosh concludes: Reviewing the book for The New York Times, American historian David Oshinsky was harshly critical, calling Evans' primary thesis a \\"remarkable fantasy,\\" asserting that Evans has uncovered no fresh evidence and arguing that the evidence supports the view that communist spy networks in the United States had largely been dismantled by the time McCarthy started his campaign and that McCarthy was \\"a bit player in the battle against Communist subversion, a latecomer who turned a vital crusade into a political mud bath... The fiercely negative judgments of those who lived through the McCarthy era are widely accepted today for good reason: they ring true.\\" Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"[a] revisionist biography\\", which, although a \\"detailed account\\", is \\"marred by ideological blinders\\" and fit \\"[f]or true believers only\\", Publishers Weekly described Evans as \\"given to conspiracy thinking\\" and Reason magazine described the book as \\"revisionist\\" and \\"a breathless defense of McCarthy.\\" In a 2008 review by Wes Vernon of Accuracy in Media, he says, \\"Generally, the media that trashed the Evans book did so either from a wealth of ignorance or willingness to gloss over the book's irrefutable documentation.\\" References External links * book review by Henry E.

Known for such well-received albums as Twilight (for the German/Dutch jazz label Double Moon, 2001), Chimera (for the major indie jazz label Steeplechase, 2007), and Transplants (Ruzztone, 2009), he has performed with a wide variety of artists, including Tony Bennett, Petula Clark, and Gene ‚ÄúMighty Flea‚Äù Conners. In addition to his contributions to jazz, he has made his mark on pop culture, serving as music coach and guitar instructor to the young actors on Nickelodeon‚Äôs popular series The Naked Brothers Band. Early life and education Spiegel, a member of a musically inclined family, was born in Los Angeles, California, and raised in Santa Monica. Spiegel‚Äôs older sister plays the bluegrass fiddle, and his brother is a pianist and composer. Their father is an avid amateur jazz trumpet player. A fan of pop radio as a youngster, Spiegel discovered rock music as he entered his teens. He soon became determined to own an electric guitar and took lessons at a local music store in Fountain Valley, later earning enough pocket money to purchase a Fender Stratocaster. He began jamming with other area musicians, eventually forming a rock cover band that played house parties around Orange County. While Spiegel was in his late teens, his father found a job at Rhein-Main Air Base, near Frankfurt, Germany. Upon graduating from Frankfurt American High School, Spiegel entered the University of Maryland, which maintained a campus in Munich. While there, he formed a progressive-rock band, joined a local R&B; and soul unit, and began learning jazz standards. In 1982 Spiegel returned to the U.S. to complete his bachelor‚Äôs degree at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, earning a degree in philosophy. In 1986 Spiegel applied for and won a scholarship to the renowned Berklee College of Music, in Boston. Upon completion of his studies, he relocated to Germany in 1988. Music career Once in Germany Spiegel gradually made contacts in the music world and began playing on military bases and at local jazz clubs and festivals. During a stint in Paris he formed a quartet called Guitar Hell, which toured widely in France and Germany. He soon found himself in demand as a guitarist and electric bassist with various European big bands, jazz ensembles, and blues groups. Joining the band of the popular American trombonist/vocalist Gene ‚ÄúMighty Flea‚Äù Conners, Spiegel performed concerts throughout Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Around the same time, Spiegel joined the band of German jazz organist Barbara Dennerlein. With Dennerlein he played numerous tours and jazz festivals throughout Europe and performed with her band on several television and radio shows. Thanks to his greatly enhanced profile, in 1999 he was awarded the coveted Jazz Scholarship by the city of Frankfurt for his contributions to the city‚Äôs artistic scene. In 2001 Spiegel returned to the U.S., settling in New York City. There he studied under teachers Adam Rogers, Paul Bollenback, Ben Monder and John Patitucci, receiving his master‚Äôs degree in jazz performance from the City College of New York. In 2008 his Jazz/North Indian classical fusion ensemble, Sundar Shor, undertook a tour of India under the auspices of the American Center, and it has toured widely in Europe as well.

(1612 - 20 May 1677), was a Sulpician priest from France, who was a significant leader in the development of New France. He was the founder and first superior of the Seminary of Saint- Sulpice in Montreal. Life Early life De Queylus, as he was known during his life, was born in 1612 in Privezac, in the ancient Province of Rouergue in the Kingdom of France, a son of a wealthy nobleman. Destined for service in the Church, at the age of 11 he was made the commendatory abbot of the Abbey of Loc-Dieu, giving him the lifelong title of abb√©. Choosing late in his life to pursue the priesthood, he studied at a seminary in the village of Vaugirard, now the Quartier Saint-Lambert in the 15th arrondissement of Paris. He was ordained a priest on 15 April 1645. In July of that year, he joined the Society of Saint-Sulpice, dedicated to the sound training of a clergy for France and her territories. That same year, independently, he joined the Soci√©t√© Notre-Dame de Montr√©al, an organization dedicated to the conversion of the people of the First Nations in the recently conquered territory of New France. Almost immediately after his admission to the Society, Queylus gained the trust of its founder, Jean-Jacques Olier, whom he might have known from their mutual alma mater. Olier soon entrusted him with the task of establishing new seminaries in the format which he had instituted in 1641 in founding the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice, Paris. Within a few years, De Queylus had established seminaries in his native region of Rodez (1647), as well as in Nantes (1649) and Viviers (1650). In 1648, moreover, he was briefly made superior of the motherhouse of Saint-Sulpice in Paris. Two years later, Queylus settled in the Vivarais, as the pastor of Privas, site of the final rebellion of the Huguenots in France. He worked to convert the remaining Huguenot population to the Catholic faith. He also established a Sulpician seminary at Clermont in 1656. Shortly after that, he was suddenly recalled to Paris. New France First mission In 1656, the Societ√© de Montr√©al had determined to establish a seminary in the colony of Ville-Marie, now Montreal, for the training of missionaries to the indigenous people of America. Olier, himself a member of the society, nominated de Queylus, his trusted assistant who had already successfully founded four such schools. Given de Queylus' large fortune and his characteristic generosity, it seemed even more of a natural choice for an enterprise which would require all the resources that could be found. Some members of the society further proposed that the candidate should be a bishop. Queylus gave his consent to both proposals. His nomination was declared at the General Assembly of the French clergy held on 10 January 1657. The Jesuits, who at that point had complete control of the colony, objected and put forth an alternate candidate, Fran√ßois de Laval, who enjoyed the favor of the royal court. This turn of events was to rankle Queylus for much of his time in New France, but he accepted the decision of the society and prepared for his departure for the New World. For the mission, Olier also appointed two other priests, Dominique Galinier and Gabriel Souart, and a deacon, Antoine d‚ÄôAllet. All four set sail on 17 May 1657 from Saint-Nazaire in Brittany, after receiving ecclesiastical authority, conveyed by letters dated 22 April, from the Archbishop of Rouen, Fran√ßois de Harlay de Champvallon, who claimed authority over the operations of the Catholic Church in the colony. The archbishop had also given letters patent to de Queylus, naming him as his Vicar General for the whole of New France. What de Queylus did not know was that the previous archbishop had given that same authority to the Superior of the Jesuit missions in Canada in 1649. The new appointment made no mention of the prior one. Queylus and his colleagues arrived at √éle d‚ÄôOrl√©ans in late July of that year, where they were hosted in Rivi√®re-des-Roches (now the Les Rivi√®res Quarter of Quebec) at the house of Ren√© Maheut. As soon as he heard of the clerics' arrival, Jean de Quen, the Superior of the Jesuits, hastened to the √éle d‚ÄôOrl√©ans, where he welcomed the Sulpicians, and brought them to Quebec. Their first meeting was polite and cordial. A few days later, de Queylus showed de Quen his letters of appointment. They agreed that the Jesuit would take no action in his capacity of Vicar General, inasmuch as the Archbishop of Rouen had left his status unclear. After confirming the Jesuit pastor of Quebec, Joseph-Antoine Poncet, the Sulpicians sailed for Montreal. One innocent act on the part of de Queylus, however, was shortly to ignite longstanding tensions between the two leaders. The Sulpicians had given Poncet a papal bull of Indulgence granted by Pope Alexander VII on the occasion of his election to the papacy, with instructions to proclaim it from the pulpit. Without notifying his superior, Poncet read the papal document to the congregation. Quen was offended by what he took to be a show of independence, and ‚Äì as he was entitled to do by reason of his formal agreement with de Queylus ‚Äì relieved Poncet of his office and replaced him with Father Claude Pijart. Poncet, on his way to the Iroquois country, stopped at Ville-Marie at the beginning of September, and informed de Queylus of this incident, who, taking offense in his turn, ordered the Jesuit to accompany him to Quebec. When they arrived there on 12 September, de Queylus immediately took the control of the parish away from Pijart and declared himself as the pastor of the town. A battle of names ensued between de Queylus and de Quen. This situation was exacerbated when Queylus took the Jesuits to court in an effort to claim their residence as parish property. When it was proven that the Jesuits had, in fact, paid for the property, their victory did not help the situation. The situation did ease, however, so that by the summer of 1658, a visitor was to report that the religious leaders of the colony were in harmony. The test of this quickly came, when documents came that July from the Archbishop of Rouen, confirming both as his Vicars General for the colony, the Sulpician in Montreal, and the Jesuit for the rest of the colony. While de Queylus initially balked, he soon relented and moved to Montreal. During this period, de Queylus worked on building up the colony. In 1657 he reorganized the parish of Montreal and appointed his fellow Sulpician, Gabriel Souart, as its pastor. In 1658 he authorized the building of the Churches of Sainte-Anne at Beaupr√© and of Notre-Dame-de-la-Visitation at Ch√¢teau-Richer. In 1659 he supervised the development of the settlement of Ville-Marie, fixing the site of the town and making it ready for the arrival of new settlers, who were to clear the fiefs of Saint-Marie and of Saint- Gabriel. De Queylus had envisioned the founding of a hospital at Ville-Marie for aged and sick Indians. He hoped that the natives, following their relatives who were being cared for there, would come to Montreal, settle there, and gradually acquire the French language and manners from their contacts with the settlers. Admiring the work of the Canonesses of St. Augustine of the Mercy of Jesus at H√¥tel-Dieu de Qu√©bec, in 1658 he had offered them the administration of a hospital which was being operated by Jeanne Mance, a laywoman who had helped to found the colony, pending the arrival of canonesses from another religious Order in France. Queylus obtained Laval's permission for the direction of this institution to be entrusted to the canonesses of Quebec. The administrator of the hospital, however, found another benefactor and was able to bring three Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph from the H√¥tel-Dieu of La Fleche in France. De Queylus' position was eroded, moreover, with the hurried appointment of de Laval as Vicar Apostolic for the colony by the Holy See, which rejected the protests of the Parlements of both Rouen and Paris. Laval landed in Quebec on 16 June 1659. While initially confused as to his authority relative to that of de Queylus, the colonists soon accepted him as their spiritual leader. De Queylus himself acknowledged him as such the following August. This changed when new letters giving de Queyluy ecclesiastical authority over the colony were received from both the Archbishop of Rouen and King Louis XIV the following month. Recanting his earlier submission, de Queylus sought to have the governor of the colony enforce his authority. Unfortunately for him, the king had quickly reversed his decision. When a letter to that effect arrived, de Queylus relented. He then sailed back to France on 22 October 1659. Second mission After his return, de Queylus immediately began to form plans to return to New France. Laval, suspecting him of this, had already requested that the king take steps to prevent his return. In February 1660, King Louis explicitly forbade de Queylus from leaving France without his express permission. When de Queylus was unsuccessful in getting the king to reverse his decision, he covertly left for Rome, where he tricked the Apostolic Datary into giving him a papal bull which established a parish in Ville-Marie independent of the Vicar Apostolic's authority. It further gave the right of nomination of the pastor for said parish to the Superior General of the Sulpicians, and the right of appointment to the Archbishop of Rouen. Once he had received this appointment by the archbishop he sailed to New France under an alias. Disembarking at Perc√©, he then took a small boat which arrived in Quebec before the ship from Europe had arrived, landing there on 3 August 1661. Laval was completely astonished at de Queylus' arrival and claims of authority. He refused to recognize the papal bull and threatened de Queylus with suspension of his priestly faculties if he were to proceed with his plans to go to Montreal. Completely ignoring the threats of sanctions, de Queylus took a canoe and arrived in Ville-Marie on 6 August. When King Louis heard of this, he ordered Pierre Dubois Davaugour, the newly appointed Governor of New France to have him sent back upon his arrival in the colony. De Queylus boarded a boat bound for France on 22 October 1661, which ended the struggle between himself and de Laval. It further led the Archbishop of Rouen to drop his claims of authority over the colony. Third mission De Queylus' forced return to France was a major setback for the waning Societ√© de Montr√©al. He had been a major financial supporter of their undertakings. In March 1663 they ceded ownership of Montreal Island to the Sulpicians. Though they were now the Seigneurs of the colony, without de Queylus' guidance and financial support, they questioned the viability of the project of a seminary there. During a visit to France, de Laval was asked to allow his return. This he steadfastly refused to do. By 1668, however, de Queylus' quiet submission in the matter changed de Laval's mind and he allowed him to return to New France as the Superior of the Seminary of Ville-Marie. Laval even appointed him Vicar General for the island. Upon his return in the autumn of that year, de Queylus embarked on an ambitious program of missionary activity by the Sulpicians of the colony. He sent two priests to establish a mission among the Onondagas on Lake Ontario, aided the following year by Fran√ßois-Saturnin Lascaris d'Urf√©. By 1670 there were three separate missions on the shores of the lake. At the same time, he sent two Sulpicians to evangelize the Odawa people in the Mississippi Valley. They traveled as far as Lake Erie, which they claimed in the name of France. De Queylus also took up the challenge of the cultural conversion of the native children, having both boys and girls educated in French and useful trades by the Sulpicians and the early members of the Congregation of Notre Dame. These attempts proved ineffective. Additionally, he also attempted to fulfill his earlier promises to the canonesses of Quebec for funding a medical mission to the Native Americans. In 1671, in order to persuade them to assume this undertaking, he promised them a generous grant of land and a fund of 10,000 French livres. This project never reached completion. His offer of land grants to colonists who would come to serve for a time as indentured servants nearly tripled the population of Ville-Marie between 1666-71. Final days By 1671 de Queylus' accomplishments had won the praise of the king and others. That year, however, he had to return to France for the division of his father's estate among himself and his brothers. While there, he took seriously ill. He retired to the motherhouse in Paris, where he died on 20 May 1677.

Synopsis Deza Malone's family has the motto \\"We are a family on a journey to a place called Wonderful\\" and Deza is consistently marked in her school as someone who is sure to go far in life. However, when the Great Depression hits Deza's hometown of Gary, Indiana, her father loses his job and must travel in order to find work. Her mother uproots the family and goes out in search of Deza's father, with Deza and her brother ending up in a Hooverville outside Flint, Michigan. As life continues to go on, Deza's brother Jimmie leaves the camp in the hopes of becoming a performer while Deza and her mother try to carry on in the hopes of finding Deza's father. (Deza's father gets in a boat accident and almost dies.) Themes The Mighty Miss Malone deals with the themes of homelessness during the Great Depression, racism, and family bonds, family and friends especially because that's how they overcame the great depression, together. . Reception Critical reception for The Mighty Miss Malone was mostly positive, with reviewers praising the book's themes. The New Pittsburgh Courier remarked that \\"there were a few story threads that were a little odd\\" but overall enjoyed the book and recommended it as a read for children and book groups.

It had been reputed to have been used in the 1890s as a lockup for indigenous Australian prisoners on their way to Derby for sentencing, but there is no evidence that it was ever used to house prisoners.Vincent Serventy, Nature Walkabout (A. H. and A. W. Reed, 1967)  Early use  In the Nyulnyulan languages of the Western Kimberley, boab trees are called ‚Äòlarrgadiy‚Äô (alt. spelling larrgadi) and have considerable mythological significance. The ancient trees are often regarded as cherished individuals with unique personalities. Anthropologist Herbert Basedow was one of the first Europeans to document the Derby Boab Tree. In his 1916 expedition to the Kimberley region, Basedow photographed it and captioned the image as ‚Äúthe hollow trunk of a live baobab used by the aborigines as hut and burial place, Mayhall's well, King Sound‚Äù. Basedow (1918) also wrote that: ‚Äú[t]he natives have long been in the habit of making use of this lusus naturae [freak of nature] as a habitation; it is indeed a dry and comfortable hut‚Äù. He found bleached human bones lying on the floor, which suggests that Aboriginal people had also used the tree as an ossuary for the dead. The human remains seen at the tree by Basedow and other early non-Indigenous visitors have disappeared, and may have been stolen.  The 'prison tree'  Kristyn Harman and Elizabeth Grant traced the prison tree myth back to 1948. Around that time, an Australian artist called Vlase Zanalis spent eight months camping in and around Derby. Zanalis became intrigued by the region's extraordinary boab trees. When one of his resulting art works titled ‚ÄòThe Boab Tree‚Äô was later exhibited at Sydney, the Albany Advertiser described the tree as having in its ‚Äòearlier days‚Äô had its trunk ‚Äòused as a prison of a temporary nature until it was possible to transfer the prisoners to a more permanent abode‚Äô. Harman and Grant concluded that the ‚Äòhistory‚Äô of another boab tree (located at Wyndham) was transposed to the Derby tree. Over time, this myth was repeated and became accepted as a ‚Äòfact‚Äô, despite not being supported by the available historical evidence. Kim Akerman also refuted the notion, on the grounds that Aboriginal histories do not support the story that this tree was used to imprison Aboriginal people (either by the Derby police force, or by blackbirders taking enslaved Aboriginal people to the coast).  The tree today  The tree is now a tourist attraction. It is protected under the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972. In recent years a fence was erected around the tree to protect it from too much human traffic, carving of initials etc., and compacting of surrounding soil by vehicles.The Boab Prison Tree in 1960.

The sixteenth tropical storm of the annual hurricane season, it formed from an area of disturbed weather over the Gulf of Mexico on October 29\\\\. The storm later came ashore along the west coast of Florida. After crossing the state, it produced severe thunderstorms along the North Carolina‚ÄìVirginia coastline before becoming extratropical on November 1\\\\. The extratropical system intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. It eventually dissipated on November 6, shortly after hitting northwest France. The storm affected the town of Norfolk, where it became the most damaging storm since 1879. Despite the damage inland, the storm is best known for the unusually high number of shipwrecks and maritime incidents it caused. One ship, a schooner called the Manantico, capsized, killing the captain and one of its crew members. Three other ships were driven ashore on Virginia beaches from Dam Rock to Cape Henry, and numerous others were put in danger. Meteorological history The storm originated from an area of disturbed weather that had persisted in the Gulf of Mexico during late October 1887, outside the area of coastal stations. On October 29, the disturbance completed tropical cyclogenesis and became the sixteenth tropical storm of the season. After forming, the storm was located 200 miles (320 km) northwest of Key West and began moving east-northeastward, making landfall on the Florida Peninsula. It crossed land and emerged over water within the next eight hours while weakening. During its passage near Fort Meade, the storm had an estimated barometric pressure of , supporting minimal tropical storm strength. Upon crossing the state, it paralleled the East Coast for two days while restrengthening. It passed closest to land near the North Carolina coastline on October 31 at its peak intensity, with sustained winds of and a pressure of . Shortly after moving away from land, it became extratropical. The extratropical cyclone moved away from the coast and strengthened to the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on November 1\\\\. It began a weakening trend on November 2 while taking a wavering path across the north Atlantic Ocean. On November 4, the cyclone started a general east-southeast motion, passing near the southwest coasts of Ireland and Great Britain. It made landfall on the Cotentin Peninsula of France on November 6 and dissipated, although one proposed track, which is a modified track that differs from the official record due to new evidence or theory, was given by Charles Mitchell that showed the cyclone executing a counter-clockwise loop over northwest France until dissipating the storm on November 8. Impact In its formative stages, the storm was responsible for causing rain from the Rio Grande Valley along the Gulf Coast to Florida. As the storm crossed Florida, Fort Meade recorded less than of rainfall. As it strengthened off the East Coast, the storm caused damage in various towns. A maximum wind speed of was measured at Hatteras, North Carolina. In Kitty Hawk, impact from the storm was more intense, generating maximum winds of to as high as from late on October 30 to the following afternoon; despite the intensity, only minor damage was reported. In Lenoir and Raleigh, heavy rain totals up to were reported. Unusually, reports of hail and snow were also received from these locations. Telegraph poles were snapped on Bodie Island and south of Little Kinnakeet, affecting communication. The worst land-based impact from the storm was in Virginia. Cape Henry was hit with a combination of wind, rain, and blown sand on October 31 and communications between Cape Henry and Norfolk were lost. In Norfolk, the storm was the longest-lasting and most damaging since the Great Beaufort Hurricane of 1879. The storm conditions made beaches in the area so hazardous that they were watched day and night. Effects from the storm reached as far north as Provincetown, Massachusetts, where winds of were recorded. Despite causing damage along the East Coast, the storm is best known for causing a record number of maritime incidents. Numerous ships were caught in the storm from October 30, when the steamship Claribel reported gale-force winds, to November 6, when another steamship, the Australia, reported stormy weather. One ship, the brig Osseo, was caught in the storm on November 1 and became flooded. Although the pumps were manned, the water level inside the ship soon reached . After being carried away by a wave, the distressed ship was spotted by the Camalia, which rescued the crew and brought them to port. Another vessel, the Wyonoka, spotted a sunken schooner with its five crew grasping the mast and ropes: they were also rescued. In addition, four ships were deemed total losses after being beached in Virginia. The first was the Mary D. Cranmer, which was ripped from its cables and stranded near Cape Henry. Shortly after the rescue of the crew of the Cranmer another ship, the Carrie Holmes, was found beached. The ship had been driven so far up the beach that its crew were able to jump and wade to safety. A third ship, the Manantico also crashed into shore due to a combination of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a sudden stop. This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck ‚Äì that of the Mary D. Cranmer ‚Äì was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.

Vaid maintains that the American gay rights movement must reconsider its tactics and move from advocacy of civil equality to aiming at social change. The book received mainly positive or mixed reviews, and was compared to the political commentator Andrew Sullivan's Virtually Normal (1995). It was seen by reviewers as partly a personal memoir by its author and partly a guide for readers on how to advance the cause of gay rights, and as having benefited from Vaid's experience as an activist. Some reviewers criticized Vaid for failing to explain fully how her proposals could be implemented. Vaid was awarded a Stonewall Book Award in 1996 for Virtual Equality. Summary Vaid argues that the movement for gay rights in the United States has been only incompletely successful. She maintains that while its partial success is apparent from the increased openness and cultural participation of gay people, the \\"vast majority\\" of gay people are still unwilling to openly acknowledge their sexual orientation, and gay people continue to remain \\"profoundly stigmatized\\" and to suffer from problems related to \\"health, violence, discrimination, and social services\\". Vaid argues that there was a backlash against gay rights, and that most heterosexual Americans continued to view gay people as \\"immoral, unnatural, and unhealthy.\\" Comparing the problems facing the gay and lesbian movement to those facing the modern black civil rights movement and the women's liberation movement, Vaid suggests that the cause of gay rights had reached a decisive moment similar to that faced by the black civil rights movement in the 1960s and the women's liberation movement in the 1970s, having achieved greater freedom but not true equality for gay people. She argues that the gay rights movement had to consider moving beyond advocacy of civil equality and the \\"partial equality\\" it provides and aim at social change. Vaid criticizes its objective of \\"mainstreaming\\", or integration into the \\"status quo\\" of political and cultural life, maintaining that such a strategy cannot achieve \\"genuine freedom or full equality\\" because the goal of winning tolerance differs from that of winning liberation. Vaid argues that the gay rights movement had moved from the pursuit of fundamental change to the more limited goal of tolerance, and that by doing so it had adopted a pragmatic strategy that conflicted with what should be its moral objectives and \\"long-term vision\\". Publication history Virtual Equality was first published in hardcover by Anchor Books in 1995. A paperback edition was published in 1996. Reception Overview Virtual Equality received positive reviews from the journalist Richard Goldstein in The Village Voice, Jeffrey Ingram in Library Journal, Matthew Rothschild in The Progressive, the historian John D'Emilio in the Journal of Homosexuality, the law professor Jane S. Schacter in Harvard Law Review, and Adrian Oktenberg in Provincetown Arts, mixed reviews from Adam Goodheart in The Washington Post and Michael Schwartz in Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review, ACT UP member Scott Tucker in The Humanist, and the critic Harriet Malinowitz in the NWSA Journal, and a negative review from the critic Bruce Bawer in The New York Times. The book was also reviewed by Genevieve Stuttaford in Publishers Weekly, Thomas J. Jackson in the New York Native, Victoria A. Brownworth in Ms., Cindy Rizzo in Sojourner: The Women's Forum, David L. Kirp in Tikkun, Irene Elizabeth Stroud in The Women's Review of Books, Liz Sayce in off our backs, Victoria M. Davion in the Journal of Homosexuality, and in The New Yorker. Virtual Equality received two reviews in The Advocate, one by Tom Stoddard, the other by John Weir. Many reviewers contrasted Virtual Equality with Andrew Sullivan's Virtually Normal (1995). Vaid and Virtual Equality were discussed by Todd Simmons in The Advocate and Tamara J. Michels in Lesbian News. Simmons noted that Virtual Equality had generated controversy. Vaid was interviewed about her book by Surina A. Khan in The Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review, Rizzo in Sojourner: The Women's Forum, and Anne-Marie Cusac in The Progressive. In her interview with Cusac, Vaid identified the feminist author Shulamith Firestone's The Dialectic of Sex (1970), the philosopher Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949), and the work of socialist feminist Juliet Mitchell as influences on Virtual Equality. In 1996, Vaid was awarded a Stonewall Book Award for the work. Positive reviews Goldstein described the book as \\"the most politically adept history of the gay movement\\" and \\"essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the difference between gay liberation and gay rights.\\" However, he believed that it was not elegantly written, gave too much space to issues of minor importance, and that it was likely to receive less attention than Virtually Normal because of Vaid's left- wing views. He criticized Vaid for suggesting that \\"homophobia in the black community\\" is solely due to racism in the gay community and underestimating the difficulty of \\"building a movement across class lines.\\" Ingram described Virtual Equality as a \\"passionate account of the most recent successes and failures in the movement for full equality for gays and lesbians in America\\", calling it \\"Part memoir, part social activist primer\\". He recommended it for most libraries. Rothschild wrote that it was one of the most impressive books he read in 1995, and described the book as \\"an urgent and valuable contribution to the study of social-change movements\\" and \\"a damning but instructive account of how the gay and lesbian liberation movement has sold itself short\\". D'Emilio wrote that while Virtual Equality and Virtually Normal were both \\"high profile\\" books about the politics of homosexuality, they could not be more different. D'Emilio contrasted Sullivan's book unfavorably with Vaid's, writing that Vaid was grounded \\"in the actual battles and debates\\" of the gay movement, and provided a detailed account of its \\"strategy and tactics\\". He noted that Vaid's criticisms of those strategies was sometimes \\"intense\\", but that she also fairly criticized herself, since she had played a significant role in gay politics. He credited her with identifying key problems faced by the gay community, such as whether gay people should decide to seek \\"legitimation or liberation\\". Schacter considered both Virtual Equality and Virtually Normal important books, but saw their authors as having very different objectives and approaches. Schacter observed that Virtual Equality was in part a personal memoir and in part a \\"how to\\" manual for supports of the gay rights movement. She argued that it benefited from its author's experience in the gay movement and that Vaid presented a more compelling case for gay rights than Sullivan. She praised Vaid for presenting a detailed list of ways in which the gay movement could better its tactics. She endorsed Vaid's critique of the movement's ultimate objectives, agreeing with Vaid that it should form part of a coalition oriented toward \\"progressive politics\\", and aim at an \\"expanded conception of gay equality\\" that went beyond the superficial \\"virtual equality\\" that gay people have thus far achieved. However, she criticized Vaid for failing to fully spell out the connections between her vision of gay rights and her proposed tactics, and did not believe that she would convince more conservative supporters of gay rights. Oktenberg described Virtual Equality as \\"a deeply democratic, deeply moral, and optimistic book\\" which \\"every gay person should read and take to heart and to action.\\" She believed that it benefited from Vaid's experience as an activist, and that it helped show the way toward \\"true equality\\" for gay people. She credited Vaid with providing a useful history of the gay rights movement, including its failures and mistakes, as well as with synthesizing the arguments of major gay activists to provide an insightful discussion of past and present problems facing the movement. Oktenberg praised Vaid's critique of the \\"mainstreaming\\" of gays and lesbians and its associated civil rights strategies, and her style of writing. Oktenberg saw Vaid's most important observations as being that \\"gay culture\\" is \\"deeply moral\\" and that \\"the Right is, at its core, a totalitarian project.\\" She contrasted Virtual Equality with works such as Sullivan's Virtually Normal, maintaining that as a \\"brown woman\\" it was natural for Vaid to address the gay rights movement as a whole. Mixed reviews Goodheart agreed with Vaid that while gay people in America had achieved unprecedented media visibility and political opportunity, they also faced a powerful movement hostile to gay rights. Goodheart also credited Vaid with having an \\"insider's perspective\\" on the gay rights movement, but found her book \\"plodding\\" and \\"repetitive\\", writing that it \\"reads as though it were written by a committee.\\" While Goodheart considered many of Vaid's practical proposals for the movement worthwhile, he also criticized for weakening \\"the impact of her good ideas by giving equal time to too many suggestions, not all of them well thought out.\\" He questioned her view that gay rights should be linked to other social causes. Schwartz wrote that Virtual Equality and Sullivan's Virtually Normal defined \\"sharply contrasting positions on the gay political spectrum\\". Schwartz agreed with many of Vaid's political stances, but questioned whether her book would appeal to readers not already in agreement with Vaid, writing that she took the truth of many \\"progressive\\" views for granted. Though supportive of some of Vaid's practical recommendations for the gay rights movement, he also found them lacking in detail, and suggested that she attributed too much power and importance to the gay rights movement in the United States, arguing that it was weak on a national level. He disagreed with Vaid's explanations of why more gay people were not involved in the gay rights movement, and maintained that they generally had better lives than Vaid suggested. He wrote that while Vaid's ideas were powerful and her book had much to offer anyone who cares about lesbian and gay politics, her writing was \\"diffuse and abstract\\" and therefore unable to encourage gay people to support the gay rights movement. He also criticized the length and presentation of Virtual Equality, writing that a shorter book \\"could have conveyed the same ideas more effectively\\". Tucker criticized both Vaid and Sullivan for failing to present \\"any thorough analysis of class conflicts\\", though he credited Vaid with treating \\"class more directly and seriously\\". In his view, while both authors' books were being widely read and reviewed, Vaid's work had received fewer and more hostile works in the mainstream media due to Vaid's daring in deal with the issue of class, her feminism, and her willingness to challenge \\"conservatives of all sexual persuasions\\". Tucker believed that Virtual Equality had received fairer attention in the gay press. Tucker considered Vaid generally fair in discussing gay politics, though he noted that she settled some scores in the book. He criticized her treatment of issues such as outing, \\"the sexuality of youth\\", and her discussions of groups such as ACT UP, but credited her for illuminating the current state of gay rights in the United States. Malinowitz credited Vaid with discrediting the \\"mainstreaming\\" approach to advancing gay rights and with using \\"her own power to demystify power\\" by making \\"the machinations of Washington and of large national organizations comprehensible\\". She nevertheless found Virtual Equality to be an only partially successful work, suggesting that Vaid failed to convincingly apply \\"Postmodern theories of queer identity\\", made \\"vague and utopian assertions\\", and was unclear about the details of how her ideas should be implemented or how she could work with gay conservatives. Malinowitz found Vaid's political stances to be \\"at times contradictory\\", noting that while Vaid was a \\"progressive thinker\\" she engaged in \\"overtures to popular American sensibilities\\" by employing \\"religious discourse\\" and making favorable comments about gay and lesbian service in the American military. Negative reviews Bawer dismissed Virtual Equality as the work of an \\"ideological extremist\\" alarmed at the role moderates were playing in the American gay rights movement, though he believed that Vaid had moderated her tone in an attempt to win support from a larger audience, and even echoed themes from the \\"gay conservatives\\" she criticized. Bawer maintained that most gay people did not share Vaid's view that they \\"embody a radical differentness that makes them the natural vanguard for revolution.\\" He criticized Vaid for suggesting that there was a \\"gay\\" position on every political issue that all gay people must accept, and rejected her proposals for cultural transformation as both utopian and vague.

At that time, the day school opened in Skokie, with four teachers sent by the Japanese government. The day school first opened with 100 students in grades 1 through 7. In 1981 a branch Saturday school for middle and high school students opened at the former Niles Township High School East in Skokie. In August 1984 the Saturday school and day school moved to Niles, Illinois. In April 1985, due to a lack of space in the Niles school, the Saturday school classes for grades 7 through 12 moved to rented classrooms at Notre Dame High School in Niles. As of 1988 the school was less than half the size of the New York Japanese School, the other U.S. school sponsored by the Japanese ministry of education. In 1994 the day school had 280 students, with almost all of them being nationals of Japan, and the Saturday school had 850 students. By that year the economic recession in Japan had caused a decline in students. For a twenty-year period the day school operated in obscurity. This ended in 1998 when the day school moved into a new location.Deardorff, Julie and Karen Cullotta Krause. \\"School Mourns In Its Own Way\\" (Archive). Chicago Tribune. May 20, 1998.

On Monday, May 18, 1998, two school officials boarded a helicopter so they could arrange the taking of aerial photographs of the school for a brochure. 49-year-old Shinobu Sada, the vice principal, 38-year- old Kazuya Yamaguchi, an art teacher, 62-year-old Yasuo Sato, a photographer from Wilmette, Illinois, and 40-year-old Scott Maras, a helicopter pilot from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, died when the helicopter crashed into a house in Arlington Heights. Operations The Futabakai operates the day school and the Saturday school, which are private schools registered with the State of Illinois. The parent organization of the Futabakai is the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology provides the guidelines under which the day and Saturday schools are operated under. The funding for the day and Saturday schools originates from tuition, support from the Japanese government, and donations from Japanese businesses in the Chicago area. As of 1986 the Japanese government provides faculty, financial assistance to cover building expenses, textbooks, and teaching materials at no additional charge. As of 1992 the Japanese government covers half of the school's operating expenses. According to Ken Mitani, an administrator at the school, 20% of the school's funding originates from the Ministry of Education of Japan and from the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Chicago. As of 1994 there is a requirement that parents of students at the day school be members of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Chicago. They may be a part of a corporate membership or be individual members. As of 1994, the yearly tuition was, for students in grades 1-5, $1,620 ($ when adjusted for inflation), and for students in grades 6-9, $1,740 ($ when adjusted for inflation). Mitani stated that year that the decline in students could cause fees to increase. As of 1986, in Japan, the Ministry of Education requires domestic schools to offer a 40-week school year, with six instructional days per week, making a total of 240 instructional days per year. The Japanese school year begins in April, and terminates in March. As of 1998, corresponding to the beginning of the Japanese school year, the Futabakai school year begins in April. Unlike domestic Japanese schools, Futabakai has to schedule separate Saturday schools, so it offers 200 school days per year for day school students. As of 1986, in order to qualify for state aid, Illinois public schools were required to have classes in session for at least 180 days, including teacher institute days. As of 1992 Futabakai has a day school year of around 200 days, while area public school students had a school year of 187 days. Both the Futabakai and American systems had an equal number of hours devoted to educational instruction. Students, as of 1998, have about ten weeks per year where they do not attend school. As of 1986, instead of having one large summer vacation, students have smaller intermittent vacations throughout the school year. As of 1990 holidays include traditional Japanese holidays and a holiday after the end of the school year.Evans, Kimberley D. \\"Life Lessons\\" (Archive, Page 2, Archive). Chicago Tribune. May 16, 1990. Style 12. Retrieved on January 11, 2012. Futabakai operates a Saturday school program for students who attend local American schools. The Saturday program involves the study of the Japanese language and mathematics. The Saturday school, as of 1990, meets 44 times per year, and within its scope, students study many of the same courses that the day students study. In 1990, parents said that this causes the pace of the Saturday program to be more accelerated.

As of 1986 the student body for the day program was mainly in an area bounded by Deerfield to the north, the North Side of Chicago to the south, Schaumburg to the west, and Lake Michigan to the east. Some students attended the Saturday school only because they lived too far away to commute every day for school; some Japanese companies required employees to live in company- provided housing in the Chicago Loop. In 1995 most students came from Chicago suburbs in the north and northwest, and some students commuted up to one hour per direction to attend Chicago Futabakai. In 1986 the Saturday school had 800 children in grades Kindergarten through 12. In 1992 the school had about 280 students in elementary and junior high school. During the same year around 1,000 children attended the Saturday school program. In 1995 the day school had 275 students in grades 1 through 9. While the school was located in Niles, the peak enrollment for the day school was 300, and the peak enrollment for the Saturday school was 1,000. In 1998, 230 students attended the day classes and about 730 attended the Saturday classes. In 1995 Tsuneo Akasaka, the principal, said that it was common for a Japanese national student to transfer to Chicago Futabakai from a public school in preparation for eventually returning to Japan, while it is not common for a student to transfer from Futabakai to a public school. Akasaka added that if a student was going to an American high school instead of going to high school in Japan, then a student typically would transfer to a public school. Faculty As of 1986 the Japanese government assigns teachers for the day and Saturday program in three year shifts. In 1986 the day school had 21 full-time teachers and 2 part-time teachers. Of all of the teachers, the Japanese government had sent 14 of them. Of the 32 teachers of the Saturday school, the Japanese government sent 2. In 1992 the Japanese government sent 16 teachers to Chicago Futabakai. In 1995 the day school had 28 teachers, with 16 teachers from Japan and 12 local teachers. Some of the local teachers were English teachers who did not know how to speak Japanese. Day school curriculum As of 1998, American social studies and English as a foreign language are taught in English, but all other classes are taught in Japanese. As of 1992, in order to be admitted, the student has to be able to understand Japanese. As of 1992 the students take calligraphy classes. As of 1995 students tend to learn at a quicker pace than at American schools. For instance, in 1995 first graders at Futabakai learned addition, subtraction, and numbers up to 200. During the same year American first graders typically learned numbers up to 100. Takanori Tajima, a first grade teacher, said that in all subjects the acts of learning and playing are combined together. As of 1990 students are required to take music and physical education classes. As of the same year, because the students have so many required classes, the school does not offer electives.

The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers. Note that the image itself describes colors using sRGB, and colors outside the sRGB gamut cannot be displayed properly. Depending on the color space and calibration of your display device, the sRGB colors may not be displayed properly either. This diagram displays the maximally saturated bright colors that can be produced by a computer monitor or television set. The Ekta Space is a common name for two color spaces developed by Joseph Holmes - Ekta Space PS 5 and Ektachrome Space to safely contain fine image scans of film originals generally of 24-bit color depth. Specification RGB working spaces are ICC profiles, which encompass a particular region of the CIE XYZ color space (and therefore also the CIE L*a*b* color space). The function of ICC profiles is to establish an equivalence between device color values, such as RGB or CMYK, and actual colors, as represented by points in one of the CIE spaces. Given two ICC profiles, e.g. one for a working space and one for a printer, image files can be converted from one to the other, with good fidelity. This is a major part of color management. An important consideration in selecting and using a space is to avoid clipping and to ensure that conversion into future output spaces is feasible. History The purpose of these color spaces was to protect an image's actual colors (as scanned from film or as mapped from a color negative). One issue was handling the clipping process which is required when an out-of-range color is scanned. J. Holmes designed Ektachrome Space in September 1997 and later its sister Ekta Space PS 5.

Located in the Ventura County portion of the Santa Monica Mountains, northwest of the city of Malibu, California, the house has been widely publicized internationally because of its unique design, its sustainable use of recycled materials, the dramatic transportation of the wings to the building site that was completed by a truck and helicopter, and its creative repurposing of abandoned infrastructure to achieve an architectural work of significance. The project was completed by American architect David Randall Hertz, a fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and his firm, the Studio of Environmental Architecture, in 2011. Working with associate Lucas Goettsche, Hertz assembled a team that was able to realize the project after many years of waiting on government approvals. 747 Wing House Wing on a semi-trailer Colombia Helicopters Operated Columbia Model 234 Commercial Chinook carrying wing A wing lowered into place History Site The property was formerly owned and occupied by famous artist and Hollywood set designer Tony Duquette. Duquette's property was burned in the Green Meadow fire of 1993, which resulted in the complete destruction of over twenty-one of the structures that he and his wife had created from recycled objects and movie sets.Reed, Mack and Alvarez, Fred (November 03, 1993) \\"Green Meadow Wildfire Flares Again\\" Los Angeles Times Concept Whilst flying in the air and pondering the design, Hertz imagined a floating roof that would hang over the site to minimize structural obstructions of the views of a nearby mountain ridge. Hertz's initial concept sketches showed a site section with a curved ceiling and a roof form that reminded him of the wing section of an airplane. The wing, a self-supporting structure, cantilevers off the fuselage of an airplane like an outstretched arm. This requires little vertical support and only a few walls, which is ideal for a structure to minimize obstructions and maximize views. Creating a wing foil shaped roof would be complex and difficult to build conventionally. Through examining and exploring a variety of actual wing dimensions, Hertz determined that the wings from a 747 would fit on the existing pads and that they were already oriented to keep the views. The low profile of the wings was integrated into the ridge top, and the wing made to appear to cascade down and float above the ground. Utilizing the wings as 100% post-consumer recycled components and appropriating them in creative new ways is consistent with the existing context of Duquette's structures of found objects and emblematic of Hertz's thoughts on the \\"disposable\\" nature of our society.Webb, Michael. \\"Wings Over Malibu.\\" Mark 29 (2011): 144-51. Print. Design The main house comprises two separate buildings linked together on three levels and uses two wings and two horizontal stabilizers from a Boeing 747-100. The lower house is partially open air and has ceilings topped with the left 747 wing. The upper structure creates the main house and uses the right wing as the main roof and two horizontal stabilizers as the roofs of the master bedroom and bathroom. Execution Hertz convinced the client to purchase the 747 airplane, originally worth about $25 million when Boeing completed it in 1970, for US$30,000. Mark Thompson of Thompson Aviation sold the airplane and his team detoxified, cut apart, and transported the plane for airlift. Using a laser and the cut-off saws at the Victorville Airport, home of the second largest airplane graveyard in the nation, the cockpit and tail were removed and the fuselage cut longitudinally. Next, transverse sectioning reduced large segments of fuselage and the wings to a manageable size for transport. A truck carried the parts, measuring , successfully without damage. Seven California Highway Patrol vehicles escorted the truck during the night and closed multiple lanes of three major freeways, State Routes 2 and 15, and US Route 101, to accommodate the vehicle. The wings traveled from the Southern California Logistics Airport aircraft boneyard to Camarillo Airport in Oxnard, California, located 10 miles from the site. At that point, because each wing weighed approximately and the only way to transport such heavy, unwieldy sections to a remote destination was from above (navigation by truck was deemed impossible), the wings needed to be cut in two for proper positioning for transport by helicopter, which was completed by a Columbia Model 234 operated by Columbia Helicopters Inc. of Portland, Oregon and took over two hours to complete. The helicopter positioned the wings on a large pile of tires at the site. The wings were then spliced back together and lifted onto columnar supports, attaching the custom fabricated steel brackets on the columns to the engine mounts on the wings. The wings touched the ground at few points creating minimal foundation requirements. Environmental features Hundreds of airplanes had been retired to sit in the deserts of California and sold at the price of their principal raw material, aluminum. The idea of utilizing recycled components and appropriating them in creative new ways was certainly consistent with the existing context of the original Tony Duquette structures and envisioned by architect Hertz as a continuum of that concept as appropriated to today's concerns regarding minimizing primary raw material use in buildings.Futagawa, Yukio. \\"747 Wing House\\" GA HOUSES 124 (2011): 46-61. Print. The building is extremely light weight and features very few conventional materials. The main roof structure is almost entirely composed of the recycled wings. The use of the wings makes for a structure that uses materials more efficiently to achieve higher strength with less weight. Using the wings to achieve the curvilinear roof structure desired by the client saved a substantial amount of embodied energy, carbon dioxide output, and construction waste, compared to building a similar sized house made from conventional materials that would have to be transported up and down the mountain to the same location. Using the wing was also a substantial cost reduction. Even at $8‚Äì18,000Amelar, Sarah. \\"The 747 Wing House\\" Architectural Record, April 2012. Retrieved: 21 August 2012. per hour for the helicopter and $30,000 for the 747, it was still a fraction of the cost of building a similarly shaped roof with conventional materials. The 747 Wing House was built on the site where existing Duquette structures had burned. Some of the materials from the previous building were used as walkways.Rogers, John. \\"Giant \\"wing house\\" lands in Malibu\\" Denver Post, 10 July 2008. Retrieved 1 May 2014. The use of the existing pad minimized site grading. The foundation used many of the existing concrete retaining walls but they were rebuilt and reinforced as required to meet new code regulations. This greatly reduced the amount of concrete needed to make the foundation and new walls. Because the wings are only supported in four primary places to the ground, the foundation was further minimized. Both main wings are held up entirely by the four large mounts that the engines originally hung from. By designing the weight distribution on the mounts, it allowed for the outside walls of the building to be made of high efficiency self-supporting glass instead of conventional load-bearing wooden walls. This maximizes solar gain for heating and allows the entire building to be opened to the outside. This also keeps it cool in the summers and minimizes the need for artificial light. The home features an eight kilowatt solar array and a vacuum insulated hot water system as well as thermal solar systems for heating water. High performance glass and cellulose insulation is used in the wings to create an energy efficient building envelope. Future structures The finished main house incorporates only the wings of the 747-100. Hertz also designed many outlying buildings that use the remaining portions of the 747 fuselage. An art studio building will use a long section of the upper fuselage as a roof, while the remaining front portion of the fuselage and upper first class cabin deck will be used as the roof of a guest house. The lower half of the fuselage, which forms the cargo hold, will form the roof of a barn. A meditation pavilion will be made from the entire front of the airplane, measuring in diameter and tall, in which the cockpit windows will form a skylight.

Colonel Henry White bought the house from John Doherty, and at this time the name of the house changed to St. Helen's. He then sold it in 1851 to Hugh Gough, 1st Viscount Gough. Hugh Gough became a Baronet in 1842 in recognition of his military services in China. In 1846 while commander in chief of forces in India, he was raised to Baron. He was raised again in 1849 to Viscount Gough due to his achievements during the Sikh rebellion and the annexation of the Punjab. In 1857 he became Knight of St. Patrick. In 1863, the house was enlarged to the designs of the architect John McCurdy.Dictionary of Irish Architects At another time the architects Carmichael and Jones were brought to work on the house, but they were dismissed for alleged negligence. It is noted in the Valuation Office of 1865-1867 that the property was 56 acres and 6 perches. Hugh Gough's wife, Frances Maria Gough, died here on 15 March 1863. He died in the house a few years later aged 90 on 2 March 1869. From 1869, George Gough, 2nd Viscount Gough, occupied the house until his death in 1895.

In Prescott, the route began a short overlap with Highway 24 to the northwest before splitting and terminating at Highway 26 in Delight. By 1929, Highway 19 was truncated to Highway 26 in Prescott and between May 1934 and April 1935, Highway 19 was replaced by US 79 from Louisiana to Magnolia. Between 1938 and 1939, the northern terminus was extended north to its original terminus in Prescott, and the southern terminus was extended along the route's current alignment to the Louisiana state line along the former Highway 3. Upon completion of the Narrows Dam in 1951, a paved road was built to the structure from Murfreesboro, but was not initially designated a state highway. By 1953, the road had received the Highway 19 designation it carries today. It is the fact that Highway 26 formerly served as a northern terminus that possibly explains why Highway 26, not Highway 19, is the primary route from Delight to Murfreesboro despite being a lower number.

Loanpal offers consumers access to a variety of residential lending products including mortgages, solar financing and home improvement loans. The company has loaned more than $27 billion to over 125,000 customers across 50 states. Loanpal is an approved seller-service of both government sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and has raised over $635 million in funding for its consumer finance loans. 80% of the top 50 solar operations use the Loanpal platform.  History  Loanpal, originally named Paramount Equity Mortgage, was founded in 2003 by Hayes Barnard, Jason Walker and Matt Dawson. The company was incorporated in California to provide residential mortgage loans. Although they launched in California‚Äôs Sacramento Valley, the company quickly started branching out to other states and is now lending nationwide. In 2006, the founders launched an insurance company focused on auto and home insurance. After 10+ years offering insurance services, the company sold its insurance company to Brown and Brown. In 2009, the founders saw another opportunity to enter the quickly emerging residential solar market and Paramount Solar was established. After building an efficient residential solar sales and marketing platform, the company was approached in 2013 by SolarCity (now Tesla Energy) and Paramount Solar was sold in a transaction valued at approximately $120 million. In 2011, Loanpal (known as Paramount Equity at the time) took on an equity investment from Guthy-Renker, the nation's largest direct-to-consumer marketing company. In December 2017, Paramount began originating residential solar loans and later rebranded as Loanpal. In 2017, the company was chosen as the Best Places to Work by the Sacramento Business Journal. In 2019, Loanpal announced a partnership with PenFed Credit Union. The companies use Loanpal‚Äôs technology platform to make clean energy products more accessible to homeowners. Under the partnership, PenFed uses Loanpal‚Äôs platform to deploy capital, while Loanpal manages the lending experience, including installer management, origination, funding, and servicing. As of 2019, Loanpal is responsible for 30% of all new residential loans in the U.S. and is the top solar lender in the country. In 2020, the team launched its online platform for financing additional energy-efficient home improvement products including battery storage, roofing, windows, landscaping and turf, LED lighting, water efficiency, and HVAC systems. In 2020, Loanpal was selected as one of Inc.‚Äôs Best Workplaces. In June 2020, Goldman Sachs securitized $459 million worth of Loanpal loans they had previously purchased and expanded their warehouse facility to $300 million with Loanpal. Goldman Sachs also committed to buying $320 million in loans from Loanpal. Loanpal offers homeowners the option of bundling their solar loans into conventional mortgages. This allows customers to spread payments out over decades and lowers costs. Bundled loans are written in two steps: first, solar panel installers present Loanpal as a financing option. Then, once the solar project finance deal is complete, homeowners are given the option to tuck the loan into an overall refinancing of their mortgage. The solar loans are funded through warehouse lines with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Western Alliance Bancorp, and mortgages are sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac. and others. Through Loanpal‚Äôs direct pay program, the company contributes $20 to GivePower for each loan sold. Each $20 contribution is enough to provide clean water for one person for 20 years.

Armed with a main battery of four guns in four single turrets, Capit√°n Prat was the first battleship in the world to be equipped with an electrical system. She was built in the La Seyne dockyard in France, and commissioned into the Chilean fleet in 1891. Foreign navies tried to purchase the ship twice before the outbreak of wars, including an American attempt in 1898 and a Japanese offer in 1903. Capit√°n Prat served in the fleet for about ten years, until she was disarmed in accordance with a treaty signed with Argentina intended to stop a naval arms race between the two countries. The ship returned to service, however, and remained on active duty with the fleet until 1926, when she was reduced to a coastal defense ship. In 1928‚Äì1930, she was used as a submarine tender, and in 1935, she was disarmed and used as a training ship for engineers. She remained in the Navy's inventory until 1942, when she was sold for scrap. Design Line-drawing showing the disposition of the armament and the extent of the armored belt Capit√°n Prat was designed by Amable Lagane, the director of naval construction at the Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e shipyard in La Seyne-sur-Mer. The design for the ship influenced Lagane's next project, the pre-dreadnought battleship , specifically the use of twin-gun turrets for the ship's secondary battery.Jordan & Caresse, p. 30 Capit√°n Prat was long between perpendiculars and had a beam of . She displaced and had a draft of . Her hull was steel- built, with wood and copper sheathing, and was equipped with a ram bow. The ship mounted two masts, both with fighting tops. She had a crew of 480 officers and enlisted men. She was powered by a pair of horizontal expansion engines that were supplied with steam by five cylindrical boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels on the centerline. Her propulsion system was rated at for a top speed of . She was designed to carry of coal, though she could carry up to .Gardiner, p. 411Miller, p. 86 She was the first battleship of any navy to utilize electricity to power machinery.Ropp, p. 72 The ship was armed with a main battery of four /35 caliber guns in single, electrically powered turrets. One was placed forward, on the centerline, two were mounted amidships, and the fourth was located aft of the superstructure on the centerline. Her secondary battery consisted of eight guns in four twin turrets; they were mounted on either side of the foremast and mainmast. Close- range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of six 6-pounder guns, four 3-pounder guns, and ten 1-pounder guns. She was also armed with four torpedo tubes in deck-mounted launchers. One was in the bow, another in the stern, and two on the broadside. The ship's armor consisted of Creusot steel. Her armored belt was thick amidships above the waterline, and below. Above the waterline, the belt was reduced to forward and aft. The belt was below the waterline, on either end of the ship. The belt extended for above the waterline and below. The citadel was thick and protected the ship's machinery spaces amidships. It extended to the upper deck and was closed on either ends by bulkheads thick. Outside the citadel, the deck was protected by thick armor. The barbettes for the main battery guns were thick, with thick hoods to protect the gun crews. The conning tower had thick sides. Service history left On 22 August 1887, the National Congress of Chile passed a law authorizing the construction of new vessels to modernize the fleet. As part of this, they decided to order a new battleship‚Äîthe largest ship ever constructed for the Chilean Navy‚Äîfrom a foreign shipyard.Crawford, p. 59\\"Crucero Acorazado Capit√°n Prat (2do)\\", Unidades Navales.,\\"Naval Notes,\\" Marine Engineer and Naval Architect. The contract for constructing the new Chilean battleship was advertised throughout the European shipyards, and was sought by British, German, and French shipbuilders.Ropp, pp. 71‚Äì72 The contract for Capit√°n Prat was awarded to the Soci√©t√© Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e shipyard in La Seyne, France on 18 April 1889. The cost of the ship was agreed at ¬£391,000,Grant, p. 124 a figure which was ¬£4,000 less than the lowest bid submitted by the British shipbuilders, and she was laid down in 1889.Marshall, p. 53 The ship was launched on 20 December 1890, commissioned into the Chilean fleet in 1891, and arrived in Chile in May 1893. Capit√°n Prat received favorable reviews from contemporary naval critics, as she was seen as a prime example of combining a high speed with good armament and armor protection.\\"Chile,\\" p. 414. She was also heralded as \\"the most powerful war ship possessed by any South American Government ... [and] any vessel at present in commission in the United States Navy.\\" The construction of the ship helped begin a naval arms race between Chile and Argentina.Scheina, pp. 45‚Äì46Garrett, pp. 85‚Äì87 In addition to Capit√°n Prat, the Chilean Navy ordered two new protected cruisers and a pair of torpedo boats. Argentina responded with the battleships and . The race continued through the 1890s, even after the expensive 1891 Chilean Civil War.Scheina, pp. 45‚Äì49, 297‚Äì98, 347 The race culminated in the orders for two armored cruisers for the Argentine Navy and two s for the Chilean Navy, though the latter two were purchased by the United Kingdom. The British, concerned over the possibility of war between the two countries, mediated an agreement, which resulted in the Pactos de Mayo. The treaty ended the expensive arms race and stipulated that both countries arrive at an agreement to balance their fleets. The latter led to the demilitarization of Capit√°n Prat and two Argentine armored cruisers, though all were later rearmed.Scheina, pp. 49‚Äì52\\"Treaty of Arbitration\\", 298. The German East Asia Squadron in Valparaiso in November 1914; Capit√°n Prat is at extreme right In March 1898, shortly before the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the US Navy attempted to purchase Capit√°n Prat to bolster its fleet for the coming conflict with Spain. The negotiations fell through, however, and the ship remained in Chile.Long, p. 55 By 1903, in the prelude to the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese government looked into purchasing Capit√°n Prat and the cruiser Esmeralda, along with other South American warships. Esmeralda was eventually purchased and commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as Izumi. By 1907, the ship was seen as outmoded in comparison to newer armored cruisers in the fleet.Elliot, pp. 337‚Äì38. In 1909‚Äì1910, the ship was modernized, which included the installation of twelve new Babcock & Wilcox watertube boilers in place of the old cylindrical boilers, increasing the ship's top speed to . The height of her funnels was also increased.Miller, p. 87 On 11 March 1916, Capit√°n Prat suffered a magazine explosion while she was anchored in port in Valparaiso. Two cases of bad cordite propellant in the aft main battery magazine exploded. The construction of the ship, however, which provided a quick venting of the explosion, and defects in the propellant cases that allowed the explosive gasses to escape easily, saved the ship from destruction. The cordite was by that time 17 to 20 years old, about the maximum life-span of the propellant. By 1926, Capit√°n Prat was reduced to a coast defense ship. From 1928 to 1930, the ship was designated as a submarine tender for Chile's H and submarines. She was disarmed in 1935 to serve with the mechanical training school. The old battleship was ultimately sold for scrap in 1942.

Like other decorator crabs it habitually attaches other organisms to its back. The sessile organisms are attached to hooked setae that act as a sort of velcro attachment. This decoration provides visual and chemical camouflage thus reducing predation risk. Pacific halibut are a major predator of O. gracilis. Other predators include octopus and sea otters. The main food source of O. gracilis is floating kelp and algae that they capture utilizing a waiting strategy in order to maintain cryptosis. Anatomy and physiology Oregonia gracilis have three body segments: head, thorax and abdomen. Like many crustaceans, the head and thorax combine into a cephalothorax and are completely covered in a continuous exoskeleton called a carapace. The carapace is heart shaped, a brown, tan or grey color and 5 cm in length with five long thin walking legs (pereopods) attached to it. The first three pereopods are called maxipelleds and are used for feeding. Another pair of the legs have pincers attached and are called chelipeds. The chelipeds are used for feeding defense, and to decorate their bodies. The chelipeds, are longer than the walking legs in males and shorter than the walking legs in females. Two long stalked compound eyes protrude from the cephalothorax. Behind each eye is a large and curved postorbital spine. Using fine hooked setae found on the carapace, the crab liberally decorates itself with algae, sponges, bryozoans and hydroids. Its shell covered in sessile organisms makes the crab camouflaged to its environment. Juveniles and adult females decorate heavily whereas adult males are sparse in their decoration. Range and habitat O. gracilis live in the intertidal zone up to 436 meters deep. They can be found in the Bering Sea, the North Pacific Coast and Japan. Reproduction For the majority of their lives, O. gracilis live by themselves except during mating season. Mates are found using chemical cues. During the mating process the male uses the first and second abdominal appendages to transfer sperm packets called spermatophores to the female. The sperm fertilizes the egg which the females produce and carry on their setae. Recently hatched eggs are orange-red; eggs nearly ready to hatch are reddish-brown. The O. gracilia hatch in an advanced larval stage called zoea. Having developed compound eyes and a spiny carapace the zoea drift towards the surface. After the zoea phase, the larvae advance to the megalopa phase until finally reaching their adult form.

It lives among forests of kelp on the Pacific coast of North America. Description The carapace (shell) of this small crab is slightly longer than it is wide and grows to a width of in males and in females. The rostrum (the part of the carapace in front of the eyes) has two flattened projections which spread apart. The margin of the carapace has a pair of large teeth on either side of the rostrum and another, more flattened pair, slightly further back. The carapace is scattered with small tubercles. The legs are long and bear spines which may help the crab cling onto the kelp. The colour of this crab varies, usually being brown, red or yellow, but sometimes being orange, pink, white or blue. The chelae (claws) have blue extremities, with red, orange or white tips, and the walking legs often have pale bands. Distribution and habitat Pugettia gracilis is native to the west coast of North America, its range extending from the Aleutian Islands, off the coast of Alaska, to Monterey Bay in California. Its typical habitat is among the fronds of kelp, or among the stems of eelgrass, both on exposed coasts and in more sheltered locations. It can occur on pilings, even when there is strong water movement. Its depth range is from the low intertidal zone down to about . Ecology Pugettia gracilis relies on the kelp among which it lives for food and for protection from predators. It sometimes employs fragments of kelp as decoration, but not to the extent of the graceful decorator crab (Oregonia gracilis). It is at its most abundant in late summer, when the canopy of the kelp forest is at its maximum, but is generally found in the higher part of the kelp understory rather than the canopy. In the winter, the kelp dies back, the crab population declines and crabs may hide in rock crevices. Predators of this crab include fish, sea otters and octopuses. When mating, the male crab lies on his back while the female stands over and facing him. The female carries the batch of eggs she lays, which may number upwards of six thousand eggs, under her abdomen.

The heritage-listed road bridge was designed by William Christopher Bennett and built from 1864 to 1867 by Francis Bell. It is also known as Prince Alfred Bridge - Iron Road Bridge and Iron Bridge over Murrumbidgee River at Gundagai. The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The bridge was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 July 2019 and on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate on 21 March 1978. In 1977, the Sheahan Bridge replaced the Prince Alfred Bridge as the Hume Highway crossing of the Murrumbidgee River. The Sheahan Bridge was duplicated in 2010. Since the opening of the Sheahan Bridge, the Prince Alfred Bridge has served local traffic only. The timber spans on the Prince Alfred Bridge have deteriorated to such an extent that the 1896 side ramp has had to be reinstated, so that most of the northern approach is disused, and has deteriorated to the point where it is closed to vehicular traffic and pedestrians. The portion that remains in use consists of the wrought iron truss spans and a small number of timber spans at each end,  Etymology  The bridge was named for the then reigning Queen Victoria's son, Prince Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and was built to carry the Great Southern Road (now the Hume Highway) across the Murrumbidgee. It has existed in three forms, with only the main spans across the river itself being common to all three.  History  The site was historically known as the \\"crossing place\\" and is where Charles Sturt first crossed the Murrumbidgee. It became known in the mid-19th century as the safest location to cross the river. Periodic flooding of the Murrumbidgee had already had detrimental effects on the pioneering settlement of Gundagai, situated on the floodplain. In 1852 almost 100 people were drowned in a severe flood. By 1853 a new town site had been chosen on the high ground north of the floodplain and its main street, Sheridan Street, became part of the Great South Road, subsequently the original Hume Highway until it was bypassed in 1977. On 30 January 1861 The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the NSW Legislative Assembly had rejected a motion for a road bridge at Gundagai due to lack of funds and lack of evidence of a need. A public meeting was held in September at the Gundagai Court House and resolutions from the meeting together with a subsequent petition from the district were forwarded to Sydney for consideration by the NSW Government. The river crossing had become a major obstacle for travellers and teams following the Hume and Hovell route to the Riverina and Victoria, and there had been regular petitions and deputations to the Colonial Government for a bridge. Successive governments deferred on the grounds of low traffic flows and the high cost of any bridge project to cross the half-mile flood plain, but political and commercial factors forced the Government's hand. The merchants at Wagga Wagga favoured trade with Victoria since that colony's railway had reached Echuca in 1864, and they accused the distant Sydney-based Government of neglect. They formed a joint-stock company and built a substantial three span timber bridge over the Murrumbidgee River in order to direct traffic from the surrounding districts through the town. It was reported that as a financial speculation the bridge has proved successful. A similar bridge had been erected over the Murray River at Albury. The NSW Government was forced to act in order to turn the flow of wealth towards Sydney. Not only was a bridge planned, but an expensive iron structure was approved as a clear indication to the south-western districts of the Government's legitimate interests in those regions. In late 1861, the Government placed A¬£24,000 in the estimates for a modest scheme with a short viaduct, which would have left the floodplain impassable during a flood. However, in 1864 the estimate was increased to A¬£37,000 for the whole river flat to be bridged. The Prince Alfred Bridge over the Murrumbidgee River was opened on 24 October 1867 and named after Queen Victoria's second son who was touring Australia that year. It was the first metal truss bridge to be built in NSW. A short sloping viaduct descended to join the road over the river flats until the long timber viaduct was complete in 1869. In England in 1848, James Warren and Willoughby Monzani had obtained a British patent for a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles that could support a road on either its top or bottom chord. Warren's name became synonymous with this form. The first major spans using this configuration were built in England, and English construction firms built prefabricated versions for use in the British colonies, especially India. Thomas Kennard then applied a more detailed analysis of the stress distribution, allowing further economy in the use of iron by varying the cross-sectional area of the top and bottom chords without adversely affecting strength. Kennard patented his invention in 1853, and it was the Warren and Kennard patent that was used by Bennett in his design of the Prince Alfred Bridge. According to Bennett, the Warren girder had been adopted, because it required the least workmanship on the ground, and because of the rapidity with which it could be erected, incurring least risk from the violent floods of the Murrumbidgee during construction. However, Bennett, along with many other engineers of his day, considered the lattice truss superior. The main objection to the Warren truss was that all the strains are taken by a single pin, whereas in the lattice system the strain is divided amongst a number of rivets instead. Francis Bell, the contractor, also preferred the wrought iron lattice, which, he said, could be imported from England and launched into position very economically. For these (among other) reasons, very few Warren truss bridges were constructed during this period. The iron for the superstructure was furnished by Messrs Lloyds, Fosters, and Company's Wednesbury, Old Park Ironworks in Staffordshire, and was inspected by eminent engineer Mr. Fowler. Testing of the wrought iron was conducted, and the strength was found to be much in excess of the specification. The testing in England of the first span for the bridge was also reported as very satisfactory; the deflection with a load did not exceed an inch. In 1848, three Sydney businessmen had joined a local man in an attempt to exploit the iron resources of the Nattai district, which became the Fitzroy Ironworks. The Fitzroy Ironworks were the first ironworks in Australia, but their story is one of persistent failure over half a century despite numerous and repeated ambitious, entrepreneurial and optimistic attempts. For finished products (cast or rolled), land or water transport to an English port plus sea freight to Sydney were less than the cost of cartage between Mittagong and Sydney. Pig iron, also, could not compete against British iron, mostly brought out as ballast in wool ships. The Prince Alfred Bridge, with the Denison Bridge at Bathurst, has the distinction of being one of only two early Australian bridges that contained Australian iron. While the iron for the piers of Denison Bridge at Bathurst was cast at P. N. Russell & Co's Foundry in Sydney from pig iron obtained from the Fitzroy Ironworks, the cast iron piers at Gundagai were cast by the Fitzroy Ironworks from largely local iron. The piers are therefore a rare example of a substantial finished product produced completely by the Fitzroy Ironworks at Mittagong. The four pairs of cast iron cylindrical columns for the piers were made at the Fitzroy Iron Works in 56 sections. Each was long, in diameter, with a wall thickness and each weighed approximately . They were delivered by bullock drays, although delays occurred in carting the cylinders to Gundagai because scarcity of feed and water between Yass and Gundagai deterred carriers from undertaking the work. When a section of cylinder was placed in its required position, the material inside and under the cutting edge was excavated by hand, causing the cylinder to sink under its own weight. As the cylinder descended, additional lengths were added with internal bolted connections until the necessary depth or foundation had been reached. The hollow cylinder was then filled with rubble consisting of red sandy soil with the odd stone. An immense amount of difficulty was at first experienced in reaching the necessary depth; borings to a great depth had to be made, through huge masses of timber brought down by floods in bygone ages, but the indomitable energy of the superintending engineer, Frederick Augustus Franklin, overcame every obstacle. Franklin, who worked for Francis Bell, was well regarded and gained the cordial good wishes and esteem of the people of Gundagai by his work. The design for the three iron truss spans of the Prince Alfred Bridge are based on the British pin-jointed Warren and Kennard trusses, and have the unique feature of the trusses being suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord, supported on roller bearings on vertical posts at each pier. The end roller detail has five rollers placed between the extended upper chord and a pillar which rises from the pier top. A similar detail is provided at the central pier, where each upper chord is continued from one span to the next across a nest of rollers. The Warren truss, as originally patented, consisted of a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles but the Prince Alfred Bridge has additional verticals at each cross girder location, designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. It and the railway truss downstream (constructed more than 30 years later) are two of only three pin-jointed metal trusses remaining in NSW - the other is the Whipple truss road bridge at Nowra. The deck on the truss spans originally consisted of two thick layers of diagonal decking, the upper layer being approximately at right angles to the lower layer. The deck was finished with a light curved iron kerb, similar to the kerb which still exists on Denison Bridge (see photo). This arrangement of deck for the truss spans was retained when Percy Allan designed the new northern viaduct which was constructed in 1898, but by 1932, there was just a single layer of transverse decking on the truss spans similar to the viaduct approaches, and a timber kerb rather than the original iron kerb. By 1932, it was thought that, \\"the iron spans, then being sixty-five years old, could hardly be relied upon for a further period of service much in excess of thirty years (the average expected life of a timber girder span as used on viaducts), which would bring them to an age of practically 100 years. Apart from not being heavy enough to carry the present-day standard bridge loading, old age had probably affected the iron and caused some loss of strength.\\" However, after considering a number of options for a new bridge it was admitted that, 'It was plain that the existing iron trusses, though light and of unusual design, viewed from the aspect of modern structural practice, were in good order and were capable of rendering efficient service for the life of at least one more timber approach.' Since that time, the timber deck has changed arrangement a number of times, and the ironwork has been painted with a number of different systems (originally white, now grey). In the early 1960s a footway was added to one side of the bridge, which remains today. Good design and quality construction have given a durable bridge able to carry much heavier loads that originally intended or foreseen, and for much longer than had been imagined. Located on the main Sydney to Melbourne route, the Prince Alfred Bridge carried huge volumes of traffic in its lifetime until 1977 when the Hume Highway was realigned to bypass Gundagai with the construction of Sheahan Bridge. The Prince Alfred Bridge continued to carry local traffic over the Murrumbidgee River between North and South Gundagai; until it was declared unsafe for vehicular and pedestrian traffic.  Description  The Prince Alfred Bridge over the Murrumbidgee River is a three span, wrought iron, pin jointed Warren truss on cast iron cylindrical piers. A Warren truss, as originally patented, consists of a configuration of repetitive equilateral triangles that support a road on either the top or bottom chord. The trusses of the Prince Alfred Bridge have additional verticals at each cross girder location, designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. The trusses are suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord, supported on a nest of five rollers located on vertical pillars attached to the top of each pier. The four cylindrical cast iron piers are filled with soil and stones. The trusses support a timber deck, which carries two lanes of traffic. Longitudinal timber sheeting was added to the deck in 1959, and a footway was added on the outside of the truss in the early 1960s. As opened in 1867 the bridge had a total length of , consisting of three wrought iron truss spans each of across the river, two timber southern approach spans each of , and twenty-three timber northern approach spans each of , rising on a gradient of 1 in 30 from the level of the floodplain. It was the first iron truss bridge to be built in New South Wales, The pin-jointed Warren truss section is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia. It was designed by William Bennett, Engineer and Commissioner for Roads and constructed by Francis Bell. The trusses were assembled from iron work imported from England. The cylinderical casings for the supporting columns were cast at the Fitzroy Iron Works at Mittagong, using iron smelted from locally-mined ore in their blast furnace. There were 56 cylindrical castings weighing between each - with one cylinder being long, in diameter, with a wall-thickness of . The columns were sunk through alluvial deposits to a foundation in coarse gravel and detached pieces of rock, the deepest being founded about below low water level. After the opening, work continued with construction of the rest of the high-level bridge with work expected to finish within eight months. The second configuration of the bridge was built by the twenty-three northern approach spans being replaced by a much longer structure which spanned the full width of the floodplain. It consisted of 105 timber spans varying from long, but as far back as 1932 the details of this configuration of the bridge had been lost, and no further details are known, other than the fact that it was longer than the bridge which replaced it. later with houses behind In 1896 the third configuration of the bridge was completed. The northern spans and southern approach spans were all replaced. The northern spans were replaced by seventy-five spans of and one of , one of the longest timber beam bridges in Australia. Historic Engineering Marker The alignment of this new approach was slightly to the west of the previous (second) northern approach. The two southern spans of dating from 1865 were replaced by one span of and one of on the same alignment as the previous southern approach spans. In addition a side ramp was built on the western side in 1896, leading down from the bridge six spans north of the main spans down to ground level of the floodplain beneath the approach spans, as it had already become necessary to reduce wear and tear on the timber approach spans. After the 1896 reconstruction the bridge had a total length of , and remained the longest bridge in New South Wales until the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932.  Condition  As at 13 April 2016, the wrought iron is in excellent condition considering its age. There is minor section loss due to corrosion, but the loss is not substantially affecting the load carrying capacity of the bridge. A few of the iron castings supporting the cross girders are broken. The portions of the cast iron piers which are below water have been subject to graphitisation (a form of corrosion leading to loss of strength), as is common in cast iron river piers. This does affect capacity, but is not yet causing signs of distress for this bridge. Archaeological potential is low.  Further information  The integrity of the Prince Alfred Bridges is excellent. The original cast iron piers and wrought iron trusses are clearly visible. Although the arrangement of the deck has changed over the years, it is still timber as it was originally. The footway added in the 1960s restricts views to the trusses from some viewing angles. Timber deck changes throughout the life of the bridge (both fabric and form), addition of footway in early 1960s, repainting throughout the life of the bridge.  Heritage listing  As at 13 April 2016, the Prince Alfred Bridge is of State heritage significance for its historical values as the first iron truss bridge to be built in New South Wales and the second-oldest metal truss bridge remaining in Australia. In addition it is of significance for its rarity as it is one of only three pin jointed metal trusses remaining in New South Wales. Its historical values include the fact that the cast iron piers were cast in at the Fitzroy Iron Works, the first ironworks in Australia, chiefly from local ores. The Bridge and the piers therefore provides an irreplaceable source of information on the quality and techniques used by Australia's first ironworks and demonstrate the technical achievements of the colony of NSW in producing its own iron. The construction of the bridge was a significant development in the history and development of NSW as it provided easy access to Sydney therefore channeling the resources and wealth of the Riverena district north to Sydney to the benefit of New South Wales rather than south to Melbourne and Victoria The state level heritage significance of the Prince Alfred Bridge is enhanced through its important association with inland road transport and communications between Sydney and Melbourne. The bridge is also associated with a visit to Australia by the Duke of Edinburgh in 1867 afterwhom the bridge was named. In addition the bridge is associated with two eminent engineers, William Christopher Bennett the designer and Francis Bell the Contractor. Technically the bridge is of state heritage significance as it demonstrates some unique engineering elements such as the support arrangements, consisting of vertical pillars at each pier, having the trusses suspended from the top chords, resting on a nest of roller bearings. The Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its landmark qualities as an integral part of the overall historic vista which includes the iron bridge, the long timber viaduct and adjacent rail bridge. These are a widely recognisable part of the built environment in Gundagai and have a place in the experience and memories of travellers between Sydney and Melbourne from its opening in 1867 until its closure in 1977. The Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its special value to the engineering profession, particularly for the history of metal bridge design and construction in New South Wales. Prince Alfred Bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 July 2019 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Prince Alfred Bridge - iron road bridge is lof state heritage significance as it is the second-oldest metal truss bridge in Australia and the oldest in NSW. It formed part of the longest bridge in New South Wales () until the completion of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. The Prince Alfred Bridge is important in the history of the development of inland road transport and provides evidence of significant early engineering activity in the Riverina. It also demonstrates the early importance of the Sydney to Melbourne route. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The state heritage significance of the bridge is enhanced through its associated with two eminent engineers William Christopher Bennet and Francis Bell. William Christopher Bennett, Irish born engineer, designed the iron bridge. After arriving in Australia Bennett quickly rose to the position of Commissioner and Chief Engineer in the Roads Department (appointed in 1860), a position he retained until 1889. Bennett and his Department constructed 16,000km of road and 64 km of bridges. In addition to his prodigious work on roads and bridges in New South Wales, Bennett also made a significant contribution to navigation, water supply and sewerage works.In 1872 Sir Henry Parkes commended Bennett and his work with the department sayying he was \\"one of the ablest officers in the government service\\" Francis Bell was another engineer who was born in Ireland By 1853 Bell had migrated to Australia, and was first involved in a number of significant engineering projects in Victoria. His expertise was such that he was often requested to give evidence to the Victorian Royal Commissions on the River and Harbour Trust, to Select Committees on the Railway Department and the Central Railway Terminus. He was involved in constructing a number of iron truss bridges including the earliest substantial metal truss bridge in Australia, the Hawthorne Bridge over the Yarra in Melbourne. Bell was City Engineer for the City of Sydney from 1871 to 1879, and was a member of the Sewerage and Health Board. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance as is an important work of a prominent designer, William Christopher Bennett, who made use of the design technology that was patented in England less than 15 years before the opening of the bridge (1853 the Warren and Kennard patent). Bennett's innovations include the support arrangements for the trusses, consisting of vertical pillars at each pier to support the trusses from the top chord, and the introduction of additional vertical elements designed to provide lateral support to the top chord. The Prince Alfred Bridge also demonstrates the technical achievements of the colony of New South Wales in discovering, mining, smelting and manufacturing the cast iron piers. The Prince Alfred Bridge is of state heritage significance for its landmark qualities as an integral part of the overall historic vista which includes the iron bridge, the long timber viaduct and adjacent rail bridge. These are a widely recognisable part of the built environment in Gundagai and have a place in the experience and memories of travellers between Sydney and Melbourne from its opening in 1867 until its closure in 1977. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The item is of state heritage significance as it has special value to the engineering profession throughout the state, as demonstrated by the Engineers Australia Historic Engineering Marker. It also has a special association with travellers between Sydney and Melbourne, having carried Hume Highway traffic for over 100 years. Since the realignment of the Highway in 1977, the historic features of the bridge with its viaduct have been successfully promoted such that it, along with the rail bridge and its viaduct, is a prominent tourist attraction. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It meets this criterion of State significance because the cast iron cylinders for the piers were made with the earliest Australian iron, cast in The Fitzroy Ironworks which were the first ironworks in Australia. The pier cylinders are therefore an irreplaceable source of information on the quality and techniques of Australia's first ironworks. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The bridge is of state heritage significance as it is one of only two early Australian bridges built with Australian iron (Denison Bridge at Bathurst is the other). It is also one of only three pin jointed metal trusses still extant in NSW (the others being the Whipple truss road bridge at Nowra and the Gundagai rail bridge, no longer in use). It is a British pin-jointed truss of a type that did not appear in the USA until the 1880s, and has the unique feature of the trusses being suspended from a continuous horizontal top chord member, supported on roller bearings on vertical pillars at each pier. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Prince Alfred Bridgeis of state heritage significance as it is representative of the engineering excellence of the designer William Christopher Bennett, and of the contractor Francis Bell. While William Christopher Bennett was responsible for the design of many hundreds of bridges in the mid to late 1800s, only very few remain. The bridge is an outstanding example of the designs of William Christopher Bennett, demonstrating his ability in sound structural analysis as well as his willingness to make use of relatively new methods and practices in bridge design.

All click types (alveolar , dental , lateral , palatal , retroflex , and labial ) have linguo-pulmonic variants, which occur as both stops and affricates, and are attested in four phonations: tenuis, voiced, aspirated, and murmured (breathy voiced). At least a voiceless linguo-pulmonic affricate is attested from all Khoisan languages of southern Africa (the Khoe, Tuu, and Kx'a language families), as well as (reportedly) from the Bantu language Yeyi from the same area, but they are unattested elsewhere. Analysis Traditionally, contour clicks were believed to be uvular in their rear articulation, whereas non-contour clicks were thought to be velar. However, it is now known that all clicks are uvular, at least in the languages that have been investigated, and that the articulation of these clicks is more complex than that of others but no different in location. Miller (2011) analyzes them as contours (that is, as a transition from one kind of sound to another within a single consonant), whereas Nakagawa (2006)Nakagawa, 2006. Aspects of the phonetic and phonological structure of the G|ui language. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Witwatersrand. analyzes them as sequences of a click followed by a uvular consonant (that is, as consonant clusters). The benefit of a cluster analysis is that it greatly reduces the consonant inventory of the language. Taa, for example, has 164 known consonants, including 111 (and potentially 115) clicks, an extraordinary number considering that the largest inventory of any language without clicks, that of Ubykh, is 80 (84 consonants including loanwords). With a cluster analysis, the number of clicks in Taa is reduced to 43, and the total number of consonants to 87, only slightly surpassing Ubykh for the most consonants in the world.Naumann, Christfied (2008). \\"The Consonantal System of West «ÉXoon\\". 3rd International Symposium on Khoisan Languages and Linguistics. Riezlern. There are, however, some disadvantages to a cluster analysis: Although the click series and non-click series can often be made to align, in some languages there are consonants in these purported clusters that never occur alone, something that never happens with other kinds of consonants. Also, all other languages in the world that allow obstruent clusters (as English does with s and t in steep, and as these click clusters would be) also allow clusters with sonorants (as English does with r in treat). However, no Khoisan language allows a cluster of any consonant, click or otherwise, with sonorants like l, r, y or w. Miller concludes that the remarkably large numbers of consonants in these languages is real, a consequence of the greater number of permutations of clicks, where there are two places of articulation that can be independently manipulated. Description Phonetically, a linguo-pulmonic consonant is a click in which the forward and rear articulations are released independently. The forward articulation, made with the lips or the front of the tongue, releases with a lingual airstream as in any click. The rear articulation, however, is held longer, and when it is released, it is with a pulmonic airstream. (Linguo- ejective consonants are similar, except that the second release is ejective.) That is, such consonants have a double release burst, one ingressive (the air pulled in by the tongue) and the other egressive (the air pushed out by the lungs). The rear articulation is involved in both: it helps create the suction that powers the first, and then is itself released for the second. Because the back of the tongue operates in the uvular or pharyngeal part of the mouth to generate the first burst, and the two bursts are very close together in time, the second release is uvular as well. Types Six series of pulmonic-contour clicks (as classified by the rear release) are attested. There are two manners of articulation (stop and fricative) and four voicing contrasts, each of which is found for each of the places of articulation (as classified by the front release) that clicks use. ;Linguo-pulmonic stops In linguo-pulmonic stops, the rear articulation is released into a pulmonic stop. This may be tenuis, aspirated, voiced, or murmured (breathy-voiced). The modally voiced and breathy-voiced clicks tend to be prenasalized in the various languages which use them, for reasons which are not clear. They tend to be written with a before or after the letter for the click, and with an afterward for the aspirated and breathy-voiced clicks. In IPA, using the alveolar series as an example, the four attested series of linguo-pulmonic stops may be transcribed , , , , with the possibility of or to indicate the prenasalization. The breathy-voiced consonants of some languages such as Ju«Ä ºhoansi, including clicks, contain a voiceless interval and are sometimes written with mixed voicing. Miller (2003) attributes this to a larger glottal opening than is found in for example Hindustani breathy-voiced consonants. ;Linguo-pulmonic affricates The rear articulation may also be released as a fricative, one which may be either voiceless or voiced. Aspiration / breathy voice is not distinctive, as fricatives are not easily aspirated. However, because the forward articulation may be considered a stop, these are called affricates rather than fricatives. There are two conventions for writing the frication: the English convention, with an , and the Afrikaans tradition, with a . Both are used in the orthographies of Khoisan languages. In Ju«Ä‚Äôh√µa, for example, they are written voiceless and voiced , and in the old orthography and ; in Naro, they are (voiceless) , and in Khoekhoe . In the IPA, the two series of linguo-pulmonic affricates may be written and , though with a cluster analysis they would be and . These clicks are affricates at the posterior place of articulation; they are independent of the fricated alveolar clicks, which are affricates at their anterior place of articulation, a manner which does not affect the airstream. The fricated alveolar clicks may be lingual or linguo- pulmonic‚Äîthat is, they may be affricates at both places of articulation, or at one.

Contemporary EPAP devices have two small valves that allow air to be drawn in through each nostril, but not exhaled; the valves are held in place by adhesive tabs on the outside of the nose. The mechanism by which EPAP may work is not clear; it may be that the resistance to nasal exhalation leads to a buildup in CO2 which in turn increases respiratory drive, or that resistance to exhalation generates pressure that forces the upper airway to open wider. In OSA it appears to be effective to reduce but not eliminate apnea for people with mild to moderate OSA (Apnea‚Äìhypopnea index < 30) and for people who cannot tolerate CPAP, but within those groups it is not clear why some respond and others do not, and the evidence consists of small clinical trials with follow-up no longer than one year. As of 2015 there was evidence from one small trial that it may be useful in children with OSA. It has shown evidence of reducing snoring as well. EPAP is unlikely to be effective in people with significant nasal obstruction.

Description Stegocephalids have smooth and globular bodies with a short and deep head. It has small rostrum and the highly modified mouthparts are arranged into a cone structure. the functions of which are unknown but believed to be either for sucking or piercing. The upper part of the lips has a small notch on the distal side, while the lower lip are tall and lack inner lobes. The mandibular molar and palp may be absent or only present in vestigial forms. On the maxilla, the inner plates are setose and well-developed while the palp is often reduced and consists of only a single segment. The maxillipeds are large, often with an inner cutting edge and slender weakly dactylate palps. The eyes are kidney-shaped when present, but is more often completely absent. The antennae possess short peduncles and flagella, with that on the first pair being somewhat stout with fused flagellar segments near the base. In males the first antennal pair is covered with brushlike setae. On the first four body segments are four very large, non-overlapping, and deep coxal plates, forming a sort of skirt on the front half of the body. The fourth plates are subovate in shape and are the largest. The gnathopods may are slender and may possess small claws or none at all. The third to seventh pereopods are roughly the same size, with the seventh pair being the shortest. The pleon plates on the sides of the body are deep with strong pleopods. The three uropods possess rami that are about the same size and are lanceolate in shape. Their tips extend past the telson. The telson may be composed of lobes fused at the base and tapering to sharp point; or the lobes may be completely fused together to form a small plate. Distribution and habitat Stegocephalids are found worldwide, almost exclusively on deep and cold waters. Ecology Most of the members of the family are believed to be bathypelagic and free-floating, inhabiting the oceanic water columns at depths of thousands of meters below the ocean surface. They are commonly found with oil globules just underneath their carapaces. These are believed to function as aids in making the animals more buoyant, allowing them to float in the water with little energy expenditure. The smooth, globular shape of the body helps in streamlining the animal while drifting in the water currents, further aided by the animal retracting all its appendages within its coxal plates. The more pelagic the habits of the species, the more elongated they seem to be. Some species, however, may primarily be benthic, inhabiting the surface of the ocean floor in association with megabenthic fauna like sponges. This includes Parandaniexis mirabilis which shows evidence of being a primarily benthic micropredator of polychaetes. Their coxal plates are more reduced with more robust peropods adapted to clinging and walking than that of free-floating stegocephalids. Stegocephalids extend their legs once resting on a substrate. In observations on captive specimens, they do not seem to have the tendency to burrow into the substrate, though this might only be because of the absence of prey in the laboratory substrates. They are mostly predators of cnidarians, with the exception of the genus Andaniotes which are scavengers. Taxonomy Stegocephalidae is the sole member of the superfamily Stegocephaloidea.

Most of the range is located in Sainyabuli Province (Laos), as well as Nan and Uttaradit Provinces (Thailand), with small parts in Phitsanulok and Loei Provinces. Several rivers such as the Nan, Pua and Wa river, have their source in this range.Heritage, Northern Thailand Phu Fa waterfall, the biggest and the tallest waterfall in Nan Province, is also located in these mountains. This range is part of the Luang Prabang montane rain forests ecoregion. Geologically its composition is similar to that of the parallel Khun Tan Range and the Phi Pan Nam Range, both located further west. Geography The Luang Prabang mountains are the easternmost range of the Thai highlands. The range runs roughly in a North/South direction between the Mekong and the Nan River. Its northern end begins in the area of Hongsa District, a stretch in Laos near Luang Prabang where the Mekong River flows from west to east; its southern end is about 260 km further south, at the western end of Loei Province in Thailand where the Phetchabun Mountains begin. The highest point of the range is 2,120 m high Phu Soi Dao. Other high peaks of the Luang Prabang Range are 2,079 m high Phu Khe, 1,980 m high Doi Phu Kha, 1,837 m high Doi Phu Wae and 1,745 m high Doi Phi Pan Nam; Phu Khe is one of the ultra prominent peaks of Southeast Asia. Many of the important peaks are located at the border. The vegetation is evergreen hill forest on the highest altitudes of the range height and mostly dry deciduous forest below 1,000 m, with an abundance of teak trees, which has led to heavy deforestation. Like in most ranges of the area, a great proportion of the original forest cover has disappeared owing to shifting agricultural practices and illegal logging.Lindsay Falvey, Cattle and Sheep in Northern Thailand, Chiang Mai (1979). 104pp The area is allegedly a heartland for military involvement in timber trade. The Luang Prabang Range is practically devoid of vehicle roads on the Sainyabuli Province side, where there is only one north-south route extending from Sainyabuli, the provincial capital, to the Thai border opposite Thailand's Loei Province. History Seal of Lan Chang Province (1941-45) In 1904 the Laotian area of the range was ceded from Siam to the French Indochina colony. Following the Franco-Thai War in 1941 it was annexed by Thailand again under the name Lan Chang (Million Elephants) Province, but returned to its pre-war status in 1946 following the 1946 Washington Accord. Certain Hill tribe communities live in the range, like the Khmu and the Hmong, whose tribal villages are located on both sides of the mountain range. Since the Mekong isolated Sainyabuli from other Laotian provinces with Hmong villages, the warfare during the Quiet War which so badly affected other Hmong communities in Laos largely did not affect the Hmong in the Luang Prabang Range. Most Hmong villages in Sainyabuli Province did not see any fighting.Fadiman, Anne. \\"Flight.\\" The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 1997. 155. However, later they were persecuted all the same by the Vietnamese and the Pathet Lao soldiers, who regarded them as traitors, thus many fled across the border. There are refugee camps on the Thai side of the range. The southern part of the range saw some confrontation between December 1987 and February 1988 when Thai and Laotian forces engaged in cross-border fighting. Known as Thai‚ÄìLaotian Border War, this short conflict was caused by a dispute involving the map made by French surveyors in 1907 to mark the borders between Siam and French Indochina. The Thai-Lao Joint Boundary Commission (JBC) was established in 1996 to clarify the 1,810-kilometre boundary and settle ownership of the disputed villages. Border demarcation is still going on. Yetis are said to have been spotted in the remote Mae Charim area of the range. Tourism Presently on the Thai side of the Luang Prabang Range some of the Hmong communities are regularly visited by organized tourist groups.The Politics of Ethnic Tourism in Northern Thailand River Wa is a popular river for white water rafting between July and December. Protected areas There are large swathes of protected areas on the Thai side of the Luang Prabang Range. On the Lao side there is only one. In Laos The Nam Phouy National Biodiversity Conservation Area, a large protected area in Laos home to many wild elephants, is located in a forested sector close to the Thai border.UNOSAT Map The projected reservoir of Lower Nam Phoun dam, however, is partly within the Nam Phouy NBCA and a large zone of the protected area will be flooded in the future. In Thailand Khun Nan National Park,Khun Nan National Park Doi Phu Kha National Park, Sinan National Park, Mae Charim National Park, Na Haeo National Park, Klong Tron National Park, Phu Suan Sai National Park and Phu Soi Dao National Park are located on the Thai side of the Luang Prabang Range. Phu Miang-Phu Thong Wildlife Sanctuary is another protected area on the Thai side.

From 1993 to 2013, Kearney was the head coach of the Texas Longhorns women's track and field and cross country teams at The University of Texas at Austin; she held the position until her resignation on January 5, 2013. Kearney guided the Lady Longhorns to six NCAA Championships: Indoor Championships in 1998, 1999, and 2006, and Outdoor Championships in 1998, 1999, and 2005.  Early life  Kearney's mother died when she was 17. She later was homeless and worked multiple jobs to support herself. Kearney was a standout student-athlete and began her track and field career at Hillsborough Community College where she earned National Junior College All-America honors. She then earned a scholarship to Auburn University where she claimed two AIAW All-America honors and was selected the Auburn Athlete of the Year and team MVP as a senior. In 1980, Kearney qualified for the U.S. Olympic Trials in the 200-meter before closing out her career at Auburn in 1981 and earning a bachelor's degree in social work. She graduated in 1982 with a master's degree in physical education from Indiana State University, where she began her coaching career in track and field.

Accessed January 7, 2013. The former athlete notified Texas officials about the relationship in October 2012, and Texas placed Kearney on leave in November 2012 while an investigation took place. After confirming the relationship, UT officials decided that Kearney could not continue in her position and informed her that she could either resign or be fired. School officials maintained that any romantic relationship between a player and a coach is unacceptable.ESPN.com, Texas coach Bev Kearney resigns January 6, 2013.University of Texas, Statement from Patti Ohlendorf, UT-Austin Vice President for Legal Affairs, regarding Women's Track and Field program January 5, 2013.

Kearney and her attorney, Derek Howard, told the Austin American-Statesman that she did not know she was required to inform the women's athletic director about any relationship she had with one of her players. While Kearney admitted displaying poor judgement, Howard issued a statement asserting that male coaches have engaged in similar conduct and have not been punished, in particular football coach Major Applewhite, who had an extramarital affair with a graduate-student trainer. Applewhite's only punishment was a salary freeze for 11 months of 2009. He was given a $9,000 raise in 2010.Why Major Applewhite's affair with Texas student trainer came out four years later USA Today Patti Ohlendorf, UT Austin's vice president for legal affairs, noted in comments to CNN that the distinguishing feature of Kearney's conduct was her position as a head coach and the status of the directly subordinate student-athlete, saying that the relationship \\"crosses the line of trust placed in the head coach for all aspects of the athletic program and in the best interests of the student-athletes in the program.\\"  Auto accident  On December 26, 2002, Kearney was a passenger in an SUV that flipped over several times, throwing her about 50 feet from the car. The accident left Kearney paralyzed from the waist down. Two friends died on the scene including Ilrey Oliver Sparks, a 40-year-old academic counselor at UT and a former Jamaican Olympic track star, and Muriel Wallace, the mother of the driver. Three passengers survived including: Kearney; the driver, Michelle Freeman, a former Jamaican track and field athlete and Olympic bronze medalist; and Sparks's two-year-old daughter, Imani Sparks. When paramedics found Kearney on the pavement, she was barely breathing. Her spinal cord was badly injured, a chunk of her back had been ripped out, her skull was fractured, and she was bruised all over.http://www.thesurvivorsclub.org/survivor-stories/extreme/its-a-place-of- healing When doctors explained to Kearney that she was paralyzed, she vowed to walk again. She underwent multiple major surgeries and months of rehabilitation and physical therapy.

They are typically variously of Iberian, Criollo Spaniard, Mestizo, and Gen√≠zaro heritage, and are descended from Spanish-speaking settlers of the historical region of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico, which makes up the present day U.S. states of New Mexico (Nuevo M√©xico), southern Colorado, and parts of Arizona, Texas, and Utah. Neomexicanos speak New Mexican English, Neomexicano Spanish, or both bilingually, and identify with the culture of New Mexico displaying patriotism in regional Americana, pride for various cities and towns such as Albuquerque or Santa Fe, and expressing through New Mexican cuisine and New Mexico music, as well as in Ranchero and U.S. Route 66 cruising lifestyles. Alongside Californios and Tejanos, they are part of the larger Hispano communities of the United States, which have lived in the American Southwest since the 16th century or earlier (since many individuals are from mestizo communities, and thus, also of indigenous descent). The descendants of these culturally mixed communities make up an ethnic community of more than 340,000 in New Mexico, with others in southern Colorado. Hispanos identify strongly with their Spanish heritage although many also have varying levels of Apache, Comanche, Pueblo, Navajo, Native Mexican, and Gen√≠zaro ancestry. Exact numbers for the population size of New Mexican Hispanos is difficult, as many also identify with Chicano and Mexican-American movements. For most of its modern history, New Mexico existed on the periphery of the Spanish empire from 1598 until 1821 and later Mexico (1821‚Äì1848), but was dominated by Comancheria politically and economically from the 1750s to 1850s. Due to the Comanche, contact with the rest of Spanish America was limited, and New Mexican Spanish developed closer trading links with the Comanche than the rest of New Spain. In the meantime, some Spanish colonists coexisted with and intermarried with Puebloan peoples and Navajos, enemies of the Comanche. New Mexicans of all ethnicities were commonly enslaved by the Comanche and Apache of Apacheria, while Native New Mexicans were commonly enslaved and adopted Spanish language and culture. These Gen√≠zaros served as house servants, sheep herders, and in other capacities in New Mexico including what is known today as Southern Colorado well into the 1800s. By the late 18th century, Gen√≠zaros and their descendants, often referred to as Coyotes, comprised nearly one-third of the entire population of New Mexico.House Memorial 40 (HM40), \\"Genizaros, In Recognition,\\" 2007 New Mexico State Legislature, Regular Session.Senate Memorial 59 (SM59), \\"Genizaros, In Recognition,\\" 2007 New Mexico State Legislature, Regular Session. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, New Mexico and all its inhabitants came under the governance of the English-speaking United States, and for the next hundred years, English-speakers increased in number. By the 1980s, more and more Hispanos were using English instead of New Mexican Spanish at home.  Term  In New Mexico, the predominant term for this ethnic group has always been ', analogous to ' and '. In New Mexico, the Spanish-speaking population (of colonial descent) was always proportionally greater than those of California and Texas. The term is commonly used to differentiate those who settled the area early, around 1598 to 1848, from later Mexican migrants. It can also refer to anyone of \\"Spanish or Indo- Hispanic descent native to the American Southwest.\\" Since the spread of the terms Hispanic and Latino since 1970 to encompass all peoples in the United States (and often beyond) of Spanish-speaking background, the terms Nuevomexicanos, Novomexicanos, and Neomexicanos are sometimes used in English to refer to this group, but this is less common in New Mexico.  History   Spanish governance  The first Spanish settlers emigrated to New Mexico on July 11, 1598, when the explorer Don Juan de O√±ate came north from Mexico City to New Mexico with 500 Spanish settlers and soldiers and a livestock of 7,000 animals. The settlers founded San Juan de los Caballeros, the first Spanish settlement in what was called the Kingdom of New Mexico, after the Valley of Mexico.Simmons, Marc, The Last Conquistador, Norman: U of OK Press, 1992, pp. 96, 111 O√±ate also conquered the territories of the Pueblo peoples. He became the first governor of New Mexico. The exploitation of Spanish rule under O√±ate caused nearly continuous attacks and reprisals from the nomadic Amer-Indian tribes on the borders, especially the Apache, Navajo, and Comanche peoples. There were also major clashes between the Franciscan missionaries (brought to New Mexico to convert the indigenous peoples to Christianity and Hispanicize them) and secular and religious authorities. The colonists exploited Indian labor, as was typical in other areas of the Spanish colonies in the Americas. In the 1650s, Governor Bernardo L√≥pez de Mendizabal, and his subordinate Nicolas de Aguilar, enacted a law to force the settlers and Franciscans to pay Native Americans for their work. He opposed what he perceived to be the mistreatment of the Indians by the Franciscans and proposed to allow the Indians to preserve and to practice their culture, religion, and customs. The Franciscans protested the law and accused the governor before the Inquisition. Later he was tried in Mexico City. So, the Franciscans indirectly governed the New Mexico province. In 1680, the Native American groups that lived along the Rio Grande successfully rose against the Spanish colonizers in what became known as the Pueblo Revolt. When the Spanish returned to the province in 1692, Don Diego de Vargas became the new governor of New Mexico. He entered the former capital bearing an image of La Conquistadora. The Native Americans were so intrigued by the statue of the Virgin Mary that they are reputed to have laid down their arms at the sight of it. This Reconquista of New Mexico is reputed to have been bloodless and every year since then this statue of the Virgin Mary has been carried in procession through the City of Santa Fe to commemorate the event. At the time of Vargas's arrival, New Mexico was under the jurisdiction of the Royal Audiencia of Guadalajara and belonged to the Viceroyalty of New Spain. However, in 1777 with the creation of the Provincias Internas it was included only in the jurisdiction of the Commandant-General. After the revolt, the Spanish issued substantial land grants to each Pueblo Amerindian and appointed a public defender to protect the rights of the Indians and to argue their legal cases in the Spanish courts.  Mexican governance  The mainland part of New Spain won independence from Spain in 1821, and New Mexico became part of the new nation of Mexico. The Spanish settlers of New Mexico, and their descendants, adapted somewhat to Mexican citizenship. The Hispanos choose to make New Mexico a territory of Mexico, rather than a state, in order to have more local control over its affairs. In 1836, after the Republic of Texas gained independence, Texas claimed part of the Province of New Mexico which was disputed by Mexico. In 1841, the Texians sent an expedition to occupy the area, but it was captured by Mexican troops.Carroll, H. Bailey. \\"Texan Santa Fe Expedition\\". Handbook of Texas Online. Texas State Historical Association. Retrieved May 29, 2011. The Revolt of 1837 in New Mexico caused the Hispanos to overthrow and execute the centrally appointed Mexican governor, demanding increased regional authority. This revolt was defeated by Manuel Armijo, a fellow Hispano appointed by Mexico, which eased the people's concerns. The impetus for this revolt was the class antagonism present in New Mexican society. When central rule was reestablished, Armijo ruled the province as governor, though with greater autonomy. In the mid-1830s, New Mexico began to function as a trading hub between the United States, Central Mexico, and Mexican California. New Mexico grew economically and the United States began to take notice of the strategic position New Mexico played in the western trade routes. In 1846, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the United States Army occupied the province, which caused the Taos Revolt a popular insurrection in January 1847 by Hispanos and Pueblo allies against the occupation. In two short campaigns, U.S. troops and militia crushed the rebellion. The rebels regrouped and fought three more engagements, but after being defeated, they abandoned open warfare. Mexico ceded the territories of the north to the United States with the so-called Mexican Cession. As a result, Texas gained control of the City of El Paso, which was formerly in New Mexico. However, in the Compromise of 1850 Texas gave up its claim to the other areas of New Mexico.  United States governance  The New Mexico Territory played a role in the Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War. Both Confederate and Union governments claimed ownership and territorial rights over it. In 1861 the Confederacy claimed the southern tract as its own Arizona Territory and waged the ambitious New Mexico Campaign in an attempt to control the American Southwest and to open up access to Union California. Confederate power in the New Mexico Territory was effectively broken in 1862 after the Battle of Glorieta Pass. The New Mexico Volunteer Infantry, with 157 Hispanic officers, was the Union unit with the most officers of that ethnic background. Along with Colonel Miguel E. Pino and Lieutenant Colonel Jose Maria Valdez, who belonged to the 2nd New Mexico Volunteer Infantry, the New Mexico Volunteer Infantry also included Colonel Diego Archuleta (eventually promoted to Brigadier General), the commanding officer of the First New Mexico Volunteer Infantry, Colonel Jose G. Gallegos commander of the Third New Mexico Volunteer Infantry, and Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Perea, who commanded Perea's Militia Battalion.MILITARY ORDER OF THE LOYAL LEGION OF THE UNITED STATES After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Anglo Americans began migrating in large numbers to all of the newly acquired territory. Anglos began taking lands from both Native Americans and Hispanos by different means, most notably by squatting. Squatters often sold these lands to land speculators for huge profits, especially after the passing of the 1862 Homestead Act. Hispanos demanded that their lands be returned but governments did not respond favorably. For example, the Surveyor of General Claims Office in New Mexico would at times take up to fifty years to process a claim, meanwhile, the lands were being grabbed up by the newcomers. One tactic used to defraud Hispanos from their lands was to demand that they present documentation proving ownership written in English. Because the territory had previously been part of Mexico, only Spanish language ownership documentation existed. While the Santa Fe, Atchison, and Topeka railroad was built in the 1890s, speculators known as the Santa Fe Ring, orchestrated schemes to remove natives from their lands. In response, Hispanos gathered to reclaim lands taken by Anglos.Rosales, F. Arturo Chicano: The History of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement (Houston, TX: Arte Publico Press, 1997) p. 7-9 Hoping to scare off the new immigrants, they eventually used intimidation and raids to accomplish their goals. They sought to develop a class-based consciousness among local people through the everyday tactics of resistance to the economic and social order confronting common property land grant communities. They called themselves Las Gorras Blancas a term owing its origin to the white head coverings many wore. In January 1912, New Mexico became an American state, and Anglophones eventually became the majority population. The state's Hispanos became an economically disadvantaged population, becoming virtual second-class citizens compared to the Anglos. The Hispanos suffered discrimination from Anglophone Americans, who also questioned the loyalty of these new American citizens. The cultures of Hispanos and immigrant Anglophones eventually mixed to some degree, as was the case with immigrants in other parts of the United States.Phillip Gonzales and Ann Massmann, \\"Loyalty Questioned: Neomexicanos in the Great War.\\" Pacific Historical Review, Nov 2006, Vol. 75 Issue 4, pp 629‚Äì666Phillip B. Gonzales, \\"Spanish Heritage and Ethnic Protest in New Mexico: The Anti-Fraternity Bill of 1933,\\" New Mexico Historical Review, Fall 1986, Vol. 61 Issue 4, pp 281‚Äì299 The United States and the New Mexico State governments tried to incorporate the Hispanos into mainstream American life. Examples of this include: is the mixing of Hispanos' images with American patriots' symbols, the first translation of the national anthem into Spanish, and the recruitment of numerous Hispanos ranchers, horsemen, and farmers to fight for the U.S. in both the Spanish American and First World wars. One early contribution by the Hispanos to American society was their support for women's suffrage. Contributions from both sides helped to improve the conditions of citizenship in the community, but social inequality between the Anglos and Hispanos remained. Anglos and Hispanics cooperated because both prosperous and poor Hispanics could vote and they outnumbered the Anglos. Around 1920, the term \\"Spanish-American\\" replaced \\"Mexican\\" in polite society and in political debate. The new term served the interests of both groups. For Spanish speakers, it evoked Spain, not Mexico, recalling images of a romantic colonial past and suggesting a future of equality in Anglo-dominated America. For Anglos, on the other hand, it was a useful term that upgraded the state's image, for the old image as a \\"Mexican\\" land suggested violence and disorder, and had discouraged capital investment and set back the statehood campaign. The new term gave the impression that Spanish-Americans belonged to a true American political culture, making the established order appear all the more democratic.Charles Montgomery, \\"Becoming 'Spanish-American': Race and Rhetoric in New Mexico Politics, 1880-1928,\\" Journal of American Ethnic History, Summer 2001, Vol. 20 Issue 4, p59-84  Population  Currently, the majority of the Hispano population is distributed between New Mexico and Southern Colorado, although other southwestern states also have thousands of Hispanos with origins in New Mexico. Most of New Mexico's Hispanos, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, live in the northern half of the state, mainly Santa Fe, Taos, and Espa√±ola, although they are distributed throughout the north of the state. Also there communities in the Albuquerque metro and basin, in mountain ranges like the Sangre de Cristo, Sandia‚ÄìManzano, Mogollon, and Jemez, and along river valleys statewide such as Mimbres, San Juan, and Mesilla. The Hispano community in Southern Colorado is descended from Hispanos from New Mexico who migrated there in the early 19th century. Several Hispano ethnographers, linguists, and folklorists studied both of these centers of population (particularly Rub√©n Cobos, Juan Bautista Rael and Aurelio Macedonio Espinosa Sr.).  Crypto-Judaism  According to the Kupersmit Research, in 2015 there were about 24,000 Jews in New Mexico, 1,700 of whom were born in the state. Some researchers and historians believe that number would rise considerably if Anusim (or Crypto-Jews) were included in those estimates. In Old Town Albuquerque, the San Felipe de Neri Church, built in 1793, contains a Star of David on the left and right sides of the altar. Some observers believe that this is evidence of the influence of Crypto-Jews in New Mexico, but others think there is not enough to support that interpretation. Researchers have found cemetery headstones in Northern New Mexico with Hebrew and Jewish symbols alongside those with Catholic crosses.Halevy, Schulamith C. (2009). Descendants of the Anusim (Crypto-Jews) in Contemporary Mexico (PDF). Hebrew University. Since their maternal lines were not Jewish and they have not maintained Jewish practices, they would not meet requirements of Orthodox Judaism's halakha, but possibly would under Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism. Genetic studies have been conducted on some Spanish New Mexicans. Michael Hammer, a research professor at the University of Arizona and an expert on Jewish genetics, said that fewer than 1% of non-Semites, but more than four times the entire Jewish population of the world, possessed the male- specific \\"Cohanim marker\\" (this is not carried by all Jews, but is prevalent among Jews claiming descent from hereditary priests). Some 30 of 78 Hispanos tested in New Mexico (38.5%) were found to carry the Cohanim marker. Bennett Greenspan, Family Tree DNA‚Äôs founder, whose recent ancestors were Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe, also carries a Sephardic Y-chromosomal lineage, belonging to haplogroup J-M267. Greenspan‚Äôs 67-marker STR matches include two Hispanic descendants of Juan Tenorio of Seville, Spain, one of whom is Manuel Tenorio, a Catholic from a New Mexican Hispano family. Other Y-DNA testing of Hispanic populations revealed between 10% and 15% of men living in New Mexico, south Texas and northern Mexico have a Y chromosome that can be traced to the Middle East. New Mexican Hispanos have been found to share identical by descent autosomal DNA segments with Ashkenazi Jews, Syrian Jews, and Moroccan Jews in GEDmatch. However, Hispanos of New Mexico have no more Sephardic Jewish genes than the Hispanic American population.  New Mexican families  The following family names are listed in the New Mexico Office of the State Historian, Origins of New Mexico Families by Fray Ang√©lico Ch√°vez, and Beyond Origins of New Mexico Families by Jos√© Antonio Esquibel.  New Mexican Spanish  Spanish language in New Mexico by county. It is commonly thought that Spanish is an official language alongside English because of its wide usage and legal promotion of Spanish in New Mexico; however, the state has no official language. New Mexico's laws are promulgated bilingually in Spanish and English. Although English is the state government's paper working language, government business is often conducted in Spanish, particularly at the local level. The original state constitution of 1912, renewed in 1931 and 1943, provided for a bilingual government with laws being published in both languages. The constitution does not identify any language as official.Constitution of the State of New Mexico. Adopted January 21, 1911. While the legislature permitted the use of Spanish there until 1935, in the 21st century all state officials are required to be fluent in English. Some scholars argue that, since not legal matters are published in both languages, New Mexico cannot be considered a true bilingual state. Juan Perea has countered with saying that the state was officially bilingual until 1953. With regard to the judiciary, witnesses have the right to testify in either of the two languages. Monolingual speakers of Spanish have the same right and obligation to be considered for jury duty as do speakers of English. In public education, the state has the constitutional obligation to provide for bilingual education and Spanish-speaking instructors in school districts where the majority of students are hispanophone. In 1995, the state adopted a State Bilingual Song, \\"New Mexico ‚Äì Mi Lindo Nuevo M√©xico\\". Because of the relative isolation of these people from other Spanish-speaking areas over most of the area's 400-year history, they developed what is known as New Mexico Spanish. In particular the Spanish of Hispanos in Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado has retained many elements of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish spoken by the colonists who settled the area. In addition, some unique vocabulary has developed here.Cobos, Rub√©n (2003) \\"Introduction,\\" A Dictionary of New Mexico & Southern Colorado Spanish (2nd ed.); Santa Fe: Museum of New Mexico Press; p. ix; New Mexican Spanish also contains loan words from the Puebloan languages of the upper Rio Grande Valley, Mexican-Spanish words ('), and borrowings from English. Grammatical changes include the loss of the second person plural verb form, changes in verb endings, particularly in the preterite, and partial merging of the second and third conjugations.Cobos, Rub√©n, op. cit., pp. x-xi.

Motoo Kimura introduced the notion to simplify a model of Fisher's fundamental theorem. QLE greatly simplifies population genetic equations whilst making the assumption of weak selection and weak epistasis. Selection under these conditions rapidly changes allele frequencies to a state where they evolve as if in linkage equilibrium. Kimura originally provided the sufficient conditions for QLE in two-locus systems, but recently several researchers have shown how QLE occurs in general multilocus systems. QLE allows theorists to approximate linkage disequilibria by simple expressions, often simple functions of allele or genotype frequencies, thereby providing solutions to highly complex problems involving selection on multiple loci or polygenic traits. QLE also plays an important role in justifying approximations in the derivation of quantitative genetic equations from mendelian principles.

The match saw the greatest successful comeback in the history of the Australian Football League, with Essendon winning by twelve points after trailing by 69 points midway through the second quarter. Background Essendon went into the match placed first on the ladder with a record of 13‚Äì2, while the Kangaroos were placed ninth with a record of 8‚Äì7. The match was crucial to the Kangaroos' chances of reaching the finals in 2001. Essendon and the Kangaroos had been two of the best teams of the era, winning three of the previous five premierships between them (the Kangaroos in 1996 and 1999, and Essendon in 2000), and both clubs had finished in the top four for the previous two seasons. The 2001 season was seeing a decline for the Kangaroos, whilst Essendon was on target to win a third consecutive minor premiership. Essendon had comfortably won the previous two encounters between the clubs, by 125 points in the previous year's qualifying final, and by 85 points in Round 1. This form and their respective positions on the ladder meant that Essendon was a warm favourite to win. Match summary Essendon full-forward Matthew Lloyd kicked nine goals in the match. The Kangaroos kicked twelve goals to two in the first quarter, to lead by 58 points at quarter time, 12.1 (73) to 2.3 (15). After kicking three of the first four goals of the second quarter, the Kangaroos extended the lead to 69 points, leading 15.1 (91) to Essendon's 3.4 (22). Essendon then kicked 9 unanswered goals to reduce the margin to only 15 points, before the Kangaroos kicked a goal after the half time siren to make the margin 21 points at half time, 12.4 (76) to the Kangaroos' 16.1 (97). An even third quarter saw Essendon kick seven goals to the Kangaroos' six. The Kangaroos led 22.4 (136) to Essendon 19.8 (122) by 14 points at three quarter time. Essendon kicked eight goals to the Kangaroos' three in the final quarter to complete the greatest comeback in AFL history, winning the match by twelve points, 27.9 (171) to the Kangaroos' 25.9 (159). The win ensured Essendon remained on top of the ladder, and kept the Kangaroos outside the top eight.AFL Tables - 2001 Season Scores Essendon full-forward Matthew Lloyd kicked nine goals and Jason Johnson kicked four. Corey McKernan kicked five goals for the Kangaroos. Aftermath Essendon's win set a new record for the greatest comeback in AFL history, breaking the record of , who had come back from a 63-point deficit to beat by 13 points in round 12, 1999.

It remains the highest scoring match since quarters were shortened to 20 minutes in length in 1994. Both clubs finished the season indifferently after this match. Of Essendon's last six matches in the regular season it won just three, enough to secure the minor premiership (first place after the regular season). They lost the Grand Final to the , which marked the end of an era, as they dropped out of the top four the next season. The Kangaroos, by contrast, won just one more match for the season and slid to 13th on the ladder. Significantly, after this game, the Kangaroos won their next six matches against Essendon; it was not until Round 1, 2008 that Essendon defeated the Kangaroos (who by then had reverted to its old name \\"North Melbourne\\") again. Additionally, Kevin Sheedy never had a win against the Kangaroos as a coach again; as the coach of the Greater Western Sydney Giants in 2012 and 2013, the club lost three times to North Melbourne during this period. Footnotes :1. The club is most commonly known as the North Melbourne Football Club, using 'the Kangaroos' as its nickname; however, from 1999 until 2007, the club was officially known as the Kangaroos Football Club.

In a career that lasted from September 1851 to July 1853 he ran eleven times and won two races. In the summer of 1852, he proved himself one of the best British colts of his generation, winning the Derby at Epsom and the St James's Palace Stakes. Daniel O'Rourke came into the Derby as a maiden and won as an unconsidered outsider on heavy ground. He was one of the smallest Thoroughbreds to win a notable race, being technically a pony under some definitions of the term. Background Daniel O'Rourke was a compact, powerfully-built chestnut colt with a narrow white stripe and one white foot. He was bred by his owner John Bowes at Streatlam Castle, County Durham. At the peak of his success in 1852, Daniel O'Rourke was measured at 14.2 hands high, although as a stallion he grew to be over 15 hands. He was sired by Birdcatcher, a successful Irish racehorse who became an important and influential stallion. His progeny included the Classic winners Knight of St George, Warlock, The Baron (a leading sire) and Manganese. He was Champion sire in 1852 and 1856. Daniel O'Rourke was the first foal of the mare Forget Me Not, who went on to produce five other winners. Bowes sent the colt into training with John Scott who trained forty classic winners from his base at Malton, North Yorkshire. Daniel O'Rourke was named after a character in an Irish fairy tale who was carried to the moon by an eagle: his sire was often known as \\"Irish Birdcatcher\\". Racing career 1851: two-year-old season Daniel O'Rourke made his debut on 16 September in one of the season's most important two-year-old races, the ¬£775 Champagne Stakes at Doncaster in which he finished second, beaten by half a length by Augur. On his only other start in 1851 he ran in the ¬£710 Criterion Stakes at Newmarket on 27 October. He started 7/4 favourite but finished fifth of the six runners behind the filly Red Hind. 1852: three-year-old season Daniel O'Rourke's Derby was one of forty classic wins for John Scott Daniel O'Rourke made his seasonal reappearance in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket for which he was strongly fancied, starting second favourite at odds of 3/1. He finished fifth of the nine runners behind Stockwell, and was beaten by \\"a long way\\". At Epsom on 26 May Daniel O'Rourke started a 25/1 outsider for the Derby with Little Harry starting favourite ahead of Hobbie Noble. According to the Daily News, which compiled a list of all the predictions and \\"prophecies\\" for the race for weeks in advance, none of the press commentators or experts mentioned Daniel O'Rourke as a potential winner. The race, which offered a first prize of ¬£5,050 attracted the customary huge crowd, despite the cold weather and heavy rain which made the ground unusually soft and \\"sticky\\". There were several false starts caused partly by the crowd encroaching onto the course, but the twenty-seven runners eventually got under way, with Little Harry leading in the early stages and Daniel O'Rourke, ridden by Frank Butler well back in the field. Butler moved Daniel O'Rourke steadily closer, but he was still at least four lengths behind the leaders as they turned into the straight. The closing stages of the race were difficult to follow, with horses stretched across the entire width of the track: Daniel O'Rourke steadily wore down Barbarian on the stands side, while Chief Baron Nicholson and Hobbie Noble raced together against the opposite rail. Daniel O'Rourke, staying the distance well on the tiring ground, crossed the line a \\"short half length\\" ahead of Barbarian, with a length back to Chief Baron Nicholson, who beat Hobbie Noble by a head for third place. Stockwell, whose training had been disrupted by a gumboil and who was badly hampered in the race, finished unplaced. The winning time of 3:02 was the slowest recorded up to that time: Ellington broke his \\"record\\" by winning in 3:04 four years later. Daniel O'Rourke was then sent to Royal Ascot where he won the St James's Palace Stakes, beating Alcoran \\"cleverly\\" by a length, despite suffering an injury to his hip in the horse-box on the way to the course. As at Epsom, he seemed particularly well-suited by the heavy ground. The experience of running injured however, \\"spoilt\\" the colt's temperament and he became increasing difficult to train. In the Ebor St Leger at York in August he started at 2/5 against his only rival, Frantic. Although the descriptions of the race were conflicting as to the details, all reports agreed that Frantic beat Daniel O'Rourke easily. In September he was sent to Doncaster for the St Leger for which he was made 5/2 second favourite behind Stockwell (7/4) in a field of six. He was never able to reach the leaders and finished a remote third as Stockwell won easily by ten lengths. At Newmarket on 29 September he finished third of the six runners in the Triennial Stakes behind Hobbie Noble. 1853: four-year-old season As a four-year-old, Daniel O'Rourke ran twice, both at Goodwood's summer meeting. On 27 July he started 4/5 favourite for a Bentinck Memorial Stakes but ran very poorly behind Poodle and was pulled up in the closing stages although he crossed the line for third place ahead of Hobbie Noble, who had also been eased down to a walk. The following day he reappeared in the ten furlong Chesterfield Cup and finished unplaced behind Nabob. Assessment Daniel O'Rourke's Derby win was commonly regarded as a \\"fluke\\", and he was certainly inferior to Stockwell, who beat him on their three other meetings. He was also reported to be definitely inferior to his stable companion, The Oaks winner Songstress. Stud career At the end of his racing career, Daniel O'Rourke was sold to the leading breeder Sir Tatton Sykes and was retired to stand at his stud at Sledmere in Yorkshire. Daniel O'Rourke was not a great success as a stallion in England and was sold in 1861 for 800 guineas. He was exported to Austria- Hungary where he was based for the rest of his life at the Imperial Stud at Kisber.

History Ultimatum was formed in 1992 in Albuquerque, New Mexico by Robert Gutierrez, John Carroll and Greg Dingess. The band's name is taken from concept of the ultimatum given by Joshua in which states, \\"But if serving the Lord seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve.\\" Robert's former Angelic Force guitar player Steve Trujillo joined soon after. Vocalist Scott Waters joined the band in January 1993 and their first public performance together was at the Sonshine Festival in Albuquerque, NM in 1993.> From 1992-1995 the band performed regularly locally and recorded three demos, Fatal Delay (1993), Symphonic Extremities by Ultimatum (1994), and then Symphonic Extremities (1995). The later two demos were later combined and released on CD by indie label Juke Box Media and released on CD with a new song that was mixed by Whitecross guitarist Rex Carroll. Drummer Sean Griego joined the band in 1995, whose more aggressive style helped the band morph from traditional heavy metal to a more aggressive speed and thrash metal style. That same year the band opened up for Mortification on their Blood World tour. Mortification bassist Steve Rowe liked the band's performance and purchased all their demo tapes to sell through his new indie distribution company, Rowe Productions. In 1996, the band was signed to a three-album contract with Rowe, releasing Puppet of Destruction in 1998, which was distributed by Diamante Music Group in the US.Heaven's Metal, Feb/Mar 2008, Issue No. 73, p18 Puppet of Destruction received mixed reviews.HM Magazine, July/August 1998, Issue No. 72, p81-82 HM Magazine, July/Aug 1998, Issue No. 72, \\"Ultimatum\\" p50 (article written by John DeLaurentis about Ultimatum's Puppet of Destruction) Within a year the band used the same line-up on their second album for Rowe Productions, Mechanics of Perilous Times. The album was scheduled to be released in early 2000 on Rowe. During this time, the band also released two songs for Dwell records, including a cover of Testament's \\"Sins of Omission\\".NM Magazine, Mar/Apr 2000, Issue No. 82, \\"Ultimatum\\" p54 Due to the success of the Testament cover, Massacre Records approached Ultimatum about being on their label. Rowe Productions allowed the band to release the album on their new label in March 2001. Bassist Tom Micheals left Ultimatum in 2001 following the band's performance at the second Stryper Expo in Anaheim, CA. The band put up an ad on their website searching for a bassist and Rob Whitlock answered the advertisement and became their new bassist. The band began recording demos again in 2004 to shop to record labels. They recorded a four-song demo that caught the attention of Retroactive Records who signed the band. In the meantime, the four song demo was released on CD with a couple of bonus tracks as the 'Til the End EP on Roxx Productions (2006). It was re-released in 2016 on Stone Groove Records. In 2006 guitarist Steve Trujillo left the band and was replaced by Augustine Ortiz. Into the Pit was recorded with producer Ysidro Garcia at Sight 16 Studios. During the recording, longtime drummer Sean Griego was replaced by former Moshketeers drummer Alan Tuma. Alan recorded drums on four of the album's eleven tracks. Into the Pit was released by Retroactive Records on October 30, 2007 to positive reviews.Unrestrained Magazine Issue No. 37, p. 98 Outburn Magazine, Issue No. 43, p. 43 Heaven's Metal, Aug/Sep 2005, Issue No. 59, p. 6 In 2007, Retroactive reissued Symphonic Extremities and Mechanics of Perilous Times, remastered and containing bonus tracks. In 2008 Ultimatum recorded a covers album featuring songs that were at least partially chosen by fan suggestions on the band's discussion board.

It runs in an east‚Äìwest direction from the junction of U.S. Highway 71 (US 71) and LA 1239-1 in Montgomery to LA 123 in Dry Prong. The highway traverses a thickly forested area between the town of Montgomery and the village of Dry Prong, two small municipalities in Grant Parish, located in the central portion of the state. Along its route, LA 122 passes through the small rural communities of Hargis, Verda, and Faircloth. The eastern portion of the route between Lake Iatt and Dry Prong is largely located within the Kisatchie National Forest. Route description From the west, LA 122 begins at an intersection with US 71 in Montgomery, a small town in Grant Parish. The intersection is also a junction with LA 1239-1 (Old Jefferson Highway), a minor local route. LA 122 heads northeast from Montgomery into a thickly wooded rural area. Over the next , small clusters of homes sporadically line the highway at such points as the tiny community of Hargis. As it approaches the Winn Parish line, LA 122 curves to the southeast through the twin communities of Verda and New Verda. Here, the highway intersects LA 1240, which heads due south to a point on US 71 near Aloha. Shortly afterward, LA 122 begins a brief concurrency with LA 471, which heads north toward Winnfield, the seat of neighboring Winn Parish. Just beyond New Verda, LA 471 continues ahead to the south while LA 122 turns eastward onto an intersecting road. The surroundings become more sparsely populated as the highway passes along the north side of Lake Iatt, which contains a game and fish preserve. About beyond the turn-off, LA 122 curves sharply to the south before resuming an eastward course through an area known as Faircloth. The route then turns southeast into the Catahoula Ranger District of the Kisatchie National Forest. LA 122 winds its way through the piney woods for another before entering the village of Dry Prong. Traveling along Grove Street, the highway reaches its eastern terminus at a point on LA 123 located from a junction with US 167, connecting with Winnfield to the north and Alexandria to the south. Route classification and data LA 122 is an undivided two-lane highway for its entire length. The highway is classified as a rural major collector by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD). Daily traffic volume in 2013 averaged between 800 and 1,040 vehicles. The posted speed limit is generally , reduced as low as through populated areas. History Pre-1955 route numbering In the original Louisiana Highway system in use between 1921 and 1955, the modern LA 122 was part of two largely concurrent routes. The majority of what is now LA 122 was originally part of State Route 162, an addition to the state highway system that was designated by an act of the state legislature in 1926. The route followed the modern LA 122 from Montgomery to Faircloth but rather than continuing into Dry Prong, it turned northeast onto what is now Parish Road 11 (Landfill Road) to a point on US 167 (pre-1955 State Route 99) near Williana. Two years later, State Route 475 was established along the same alignment between Montgomery and Faircloth but with a terminus in Dry Prong rather than Williana. alt=Photograph of As the more detailed legislative description for Route 475 indicates, Montgomery and Verda were located along the Jefferson Highway and Pershing Highway, respectively. These were two important auto trails that pre-dated the numbered U.S. Highway system. In 1926, US 71 was routed along the Jefferson Highway (State Route 1) through Montgomery, and US 167 was routed along the Pershing Highway (State Route 5) through Verda. The western portion of Route 162-475 that connected the new U.S. highways was gravelled around 1929. However, US 167 was shifted onto its present alignment through Dry Prong in 1932, allowing a more direct route between Alexandria and Winnfield. Soon afterward, the gravel road was extended eastward to Dry Prong along Route 475, which became the main traffic route, while the eastern portion of Route 162 between Faircloth and Williana remained unimproved. Route 162 was dropped from the state highway system prior to the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering, leaving the entire length between Montgomery and Dry Prong as Route 475 only. Paving of the Montgomery‚ÄìVerda and Faircloth‚ÄìDry Prong sections of Route 475 was completed about 1954, leaving only the gap between Verda and Faircloth as a gravel road at the time of the renumbering. Post-1955 route history LA 122 was created in 1955 as a direct renumbering of former State Route 475. Since the 1955 renumbering, the route of LA 122 has remained virtually the same. Only minor changes have resulted from the smoothing of several curves over the years. The biggest improvement to the route occurred early on when the last section of gravel highway between Verda and Faircloth was paved around 1957.

Coronato is best known for his paintings of present-day Western Americana, cowboys, and American Indian life and culture. Life and career Bob Coronato was born in Newton, New Jersey.Depree, A, Peter.Wild West Magazine.June 1996 p.72. His mother was an executive assistant, and his father was a C.P.A. As a boy he loved to draw and paint. He would stare at the paintings of the \\"Old West\\" in history books and was fascinated by the culture and way of life. He and everyone around him knew he wanted to be an artist. While in high school Coronato began painting murals and commission paintings for money and trade. When Coronato was 18 he moved to New York City and took a summer course in illustration at Parsons School of Art and Design and New School for Social Research. He realized he needed to be closer to the subject matter he alwayswanted to paint and applied to Otis Parsons' sister school in California.Jackson,Devon.Southwest Art.December 2007 p.74. In 1991, while attending Otis Parsons in L.A., Coronato took a vacation to Wyoming and South Dakota. He visited the High Plains Heritage Museum in Spearfish, South Dakota which had advertised that they had original Charles Russell and Frederic Remington oil paintings. After not seeing any paintings, he talked to the curator, Leo Giacometto. Giacometto told him that the collection had been pulled. The museum was to have a grand re-opening the following spring. Coronato asked if he could contribute paintings for the event. Giacometto said that if he liked the paintings he would give Coronato a show during the re- opening.Zanetell,Mryna.Art of The West. Sept/ Oct 2008 p.55. Coronato preceded to turn every assignment into Western subject matter in oil on canvas, to prepare for the show. Coronato tortured his instructors by doing this: If the assignment was to paint an advertisement for an automobile, Coronato would paint a covered wagon. After graduating from Otis Parsons with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, Coronato returned to Spearfish and was granted his first museum show at the age of 23.Going Platinum.western art collector.March 2010 p.167. Coronato decided to get closer to his subject matter. He moved to a town with a population of less than 400 in the heart of \\"Cowboy Country\\" ‚Äî Hulett, Wyoming ‚Äî based on a recommendation he got at the museum show in South Dakota by a saddle maker named Carson Thomas. Carson offered the \\"starving artist\\" space above his saddle shop to work and live in while Coronato got settled. Thomas became invaluable to the direction the young artist's career would take. Thomas introduced Coronato to many of the ranches in the area. Soon Coronato was free labor in exchange for the chance to capture the life of modern cowboys. His days were spent at brandings, helping to gather cattle, or just fixing fence on ranches as big as 300,000 acres. His nights were spent painting the events he had witnessed. George White, foremen of the I.P.Y ranch,Santos,Kendra.American Cowboy Committed to a vision, April 1997 p.62. and his wife Vicki took Coronato under their wing. They made sure he didn't \\"get himself killed\\", as George would say. He was always welcome and much of his early work comes from events and scenes from that ranch. After diving into the \\"cowboy\\" way of life Coronato was introduced to Tom Waugh. Waugh is an artist specializing in Native American subject matter and a dealer in Native American artifacts. He introduced Coronato to the world of collecting and painting this subject matter. Coronato began studying American Indian culture, past and present. He began collecting American Indian artifacts and soon he was drawn to the many nearby reservations. Hulett is in a hub very close to the Crow, Cheyenne, and Sioux Indian reservations. Coronato started visiting the reservations. He witnessed the beauty and tradition that was in practice. Coronato admires and respects the American Indians and their strength as a society. He wanted to share his experiences through his work and began painting the modern life on the reservations through depicting their practice of traditions. Coronato's work evolved from painting historical scenes to only painting what he saw in the present. Coronato was soon invited to attend Crow Fair on the Crow Agency in Montana and other ceremonies held on reservations throughout Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota. After Coronato had spent many years painting in oils, he decide to draw. He had always been influenced by Edward Borein and admired his intaglio copper plate etchings. Coronato began making plates and printing them in his studio in Wyoming in the late 1990s.Ford, Christine. The Art of Etching and Mezzotint. spring 2005 p.16. Coronato is very successful intaglio printmaker who has produced numerous images. He was dubbed the \\"Leonardo da Vinci of Cowboy Art\\" by the New York PostEllwood,Mark. Wyoming cowboy poets. New york post.oct 15 2009 p.19. and has mastered the skill of original printmaking. Pittura di strati While trying to produce more work, Coronato had been experimenting on combining the three mediums for nearly eight years. Coronato found a new way of combining his intaglio printmaking with his love of oil painting. The pittura di strati medium of silkscreen, oil, and acrylic is the only way to achieve the effect he wanted. Coronato wanted to explore the age-old tradition of silk screen with cutting-edge techniques with the drawing and imagery from his etchings.Brown, Corinne.Rodeo posters art and advertising, Persimmon Hill. Spring 2013 p.27. Coronato begins by texturing a board with thick gesso. Multiple layers of acrylic paint are applied, and on top of the acrylic goes the silk screened line work. Layers of translucent oil paint are slowly built up. Oil can create fine glazes, transparent and slow to dry. As each layer builds up, they create effects of light and texture not possible with other painting techniques. This glazing technique is very similar to that of the artists of the Italian Renaissance, giving the paint a luminous quality.http://www.bobcoronato.com/pages/Paintings By combining the painting mediums and the dozens of translucent layers of oil paint, the pittura di strati technique refines the work to a unique style of painting. Because of all the variables in the layering, glazing, and varnishing, paintings in the series are unique and can vary in color, texture, etc. Similar to the bronze method of producing art, the end result is the original intention of the artist, and all the steps through the process are the only way to get to the end finished piece. In 2007 after attending hundreds of small town rodeos, Coronato was inspired to create rodeo posters in a vintage turn of the century style but using modern day imagery and techniques. Using pittura di strati, he began producing rodeo poster paintings he has become most known for.Dalton, David. Matinee idols, Andy Warhol giant size. 2006 p.174.

The central equation of Economic Alchemy is W = P x Tn : Wealth = Physical Resources times Technology, and T (Technology) has an exponential multiplier effect on itself. Pilzer began developing Economic Alchemy in 1975 as a graduate student at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania when he theologically could not accept his professor's views that God had created a world of growing population but limited resources. Over the next 15 years, he developed Economic Alchemy while working at Citibank (1976‚Äì1981), and served as an appointed economic advisor in Ronald Reagan's Presidential Administration (1983‚Äì1988).

Kodak advertisement from 1918 The participation of women in photography goes back to the very origins of the process. Several of the earliest women photographers, most of whom were from Britain or France, were married to male pioneers or had close relationships with their families. It was above all in northern Europe that women first entered the business of photography, opening studios in Denmark, France, Germany, and Sweden from the 1840s, while it was in Britain that women from well-to-do families developed photography as an art in the late 1850s. Not until the 1890s, did the first studios run by women open in New York City. Following Britain's Linked Ring, which promoted artistic photography from the 1880s, Alfred Stieglitz encouraged several women to join the Photo-Secession movement which he founded in 1902 in support of so-called pictorialism. In Vienna, Dora Kallmus pioneered the use of photographic studios as fashionable meeting places for the Austro-Hungarian aristocracy. In the United States, women first photographed as amateurs, several producing fine work which they were able to exhibit at key exhibitions. They not only produced portraits of celebrities and Native Americans but also took landscapes, especially from the beginning of the 20th century. The involvement of women in photojournalism also had its beginnings in the early 1900s but slowly picked up during World War I. Early participants While the work of the English and French gentlemen involved in developing and pioneering the process of photography is well documented, the part played by women in the early days tends to be given less attention. The beginnings Women were however involved in photography from the start. Constance Fox Talbot, the wife of Henry Fox Talbot, one of the key players in the development of photography in the 1830s and 1840s, had herself experimented with the process as early as 1839. Richard Ovenden attributes to her a hazy image of a short verse by the Irish poet Thomas Moore, which would make her the earliest known female photographer.Maev Kennedy, \\"Bodleian Library launches ¬£2.2m bid to stop Fox Talbot archive going overseas\\", The Guardian, 9 December 2012. Retrieved 11 April 2013. Anna Atkins, a botanist, was also introduced to photography by Fox Talbot, who explained his \\"photogenic drawing\\" technique to her as well as his camera- based calotype process. After learning about the cyanotype process from its inventor, John Herschel, she was able to produce cyanotype photograms of dried algae. She published them in 1843 in her Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions, said to be the first book with photographic illustrations. Another botanist and keen amateur photographer, John Dillwyn Llewelyn, was possibly introduced to photography by his wife Emma Thomasina Talbot, a cousin of Fox Talbot. His wife had shown an early interest in photography and did all his printing.Michael Pritchard, \\"Llewelyn, John Dillwyn\\", Michael Pritchard. Retrieved 11 April 2013.

As society has evolved, African-American photographers have been critical in the preservation of authentic portrayals of images about and of black culture. The participation of African-American women in photography began to receive widespread acknowledgment in the mid-20th century and with growing recognition came a shift in focus on social, economic, and political conditions. Some of the most prominent female African-American photographers include Carrie Mae Weems, Lorna Simpson, and Coreen Simpson.  Carrie Mae Weems  Born in Portland, Oregon, Carrie Mae Weems started her career in 1973 when she received her first camera. Her initial interest in the arts started in 1965, when she met lifelong friend Tom Vinters and began participating in street theater and dance. Though noted as an accomplished photographer, Weems' work spans text, fabric, audio, digital images, installation, and video. \\"‚Ä¶from the very beginning I've been interested in the idea of power and the consequences of power; relationships are made and articulated through power.\\" When exploring the idea of power, Weems oftentimes uses herself as the subject of her work, not for her own admiration, but \\"as a vehicle for approaching the question of power‚Ä¶\\" Through different mediums, Weems has made it her mission to explore the family relationships, gender roles, the histories of racism, sexism, class and different types of political systems. She was introduced to Dawoud Bey in 1976 and developed a long lasting friendship and professional relationship with the photographer. While on a work trip to Europe, Bey interviewed Weems in BOMB, a magazine focused on artists in conversation. Lorna Simpson  Susan \\"Sue\\" Ross  Sue Ross is the co-founder of Sistagraphy, a collective of women photographers, most of whom are based in Atlanta, Georgia, that has a passion for photography. In Atlanta, Sue is known as the PhotoGriot, sharing stories of the African American community through a photo lens. Sue has captured culture events and programs, as well as dignitaries and civil rights leaders who live and have visited the City of Atlanta, including but not limited to National Black Arts Festival, Atlanta Jazz Festival, Nelson Mandela, Ambassador Andrew Young, the past six African American Mayors (Maynard Jackson, Andrew Young, William \\"Bill\\" Campbell, Shirley Franklin, M. Kasim Reed and Keisha Lance Bottoms) of the City of Atlanta, and more. Since 1985, Sue has exhibited her work throughout Atlanta, including places such as Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture & History, Hammonds House, Mason Murer Gallery, Micheal C. Carlos Museum, the Atlanta Life Building, and more.  Lorna Simpson  Lorna Simpson began her career in fashion photography, taking pictures of people whose style she admired. Simpson was able to develop her skills and became a photojournalist who captured images in politics, culture, music, and sports. Receiving her education in photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York and the University of California, San Diego, Lorna Simpson was considered a pioneer of conceptual photography well before the peak of her career. Through her work, Simpson aims to challenge the traditional views of gender, identity, culture, history, and memory as viewed by society. Her combination of large-scale photography with meaningful text work together to provide strong visual implications. Her work can be found in museums across the country at the Museum of Modern Art (NY), the Museum of Contemporary Art (Chicago, IL), and the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), and many others around the world.  Coreen Simpson  Making her mark as a photojournalist, Coreen Simpson started her career as a published writer. Her interest in documenting experiences in writing grew into a love for the visual arts when she contacted Essence magazine about an article she wanted to write about a business trip to the Middle East. Although the article was never published, her interest in photojournalism was heightened. In his article \\"Coreen Simpson: An Interpretation\\", Rodger Birt describes looking at a photograph as being \\"let in on the workings of another human consciousness\\" allowing for the simultaneous opportunity to receive an authentic depiction of the physical world. Through her work, Simpson has created visual narratives that aesthetically tell the stories of diverse groups of people. Not only is she able to evoke emotional responses through her storytelling, but through design, chiaroscuro, and color as well. Simpson's friend, Walter Johnson, became one of her biggest mentors and guide as she expanded her knowledge in photography. She also studied Frank Stewart's process and developed a strong capacity for the history of photography. One of her biggest struggles was to differentiate her visual style from those of her inspiration. The four greatest influences of Simpson's work include Diane Arbus, Baron Adolph DeMeyer, Joel Peter Witkin, and Weegee. Whether conceptually, methodically, or creatively, each of these photographers have contributed to her approach in different ways. The combination of her admiration for Arbus's uniqueness, Weegee's hunt, DeMeyer's study of the composition, and Witkin's manipulation of the print work together in encompassing the personality of Coreen Simpson's work. Elizabeth \\"Tex\\" Williams Elizabeth \\"Tex\\" Williams was a world war 2 military photographer. She was in the last year of war. She was one of the first women to have a photography career beyond \\"camera girl\\".  Lesbian women in photography   History  Many lesbian women find employment and creative fulfillment as photographers. While lesbians have taken photographs since the medium was invented in 1839, many 19th and early 20th century work by lesbian photographers has been lost, destroyed, or never published because of social stigma against lesbian women. Professional lesbian photographers may have also hidden their sexuality. While all women who worked as professional photographers were seen as defying gender norms, lesbians may have embraced the photography profession as a way to earn money without depending on men. Emma Jean Gay (1830-1919) is the earliest known lesbian photographer. Lesbians also took photos to experiment with self-expression. Lesbians took photos of themselves, their friends, and their lovers embracing each other in intimate settings which hinted at same-sex relationships without being explicitly erotic. Alice Austen (1866-1952) took photos of her friends wearing men's clothing or participating in traditional masculine activities such as smoking. These images were predominantly not for commercial use, instead existing as personal mementos the photographers and models shared with one another.  Post-Stonewall  In the late twentieth century, the second wave feminist movement in the United States and the gay liberation movement following the Stonewall riots inspired efforts to create a cohesive lesbian identity with dedicated cultural artifacts such as explicitly lesbian art, including lesbian photography. These images developed new artistic trends, including depictions of sexual activity and genitalia. Joan. E. Biren (b. 1944) published the first photo anthology of lesbians portraits, Eye to Eye, Portraits of Lesbians, in 1979. Other influential lesbian photographers include Tee Corinne (1943-2006) and Cathy Cade (b. 1942). Scholars have argued that lesbian artists and activists during the 1970s and 1980s intentionally labeled their art as \\"lesbian art\\" in order to foster a sense of community that was distinct from the broader feminist movement. Jan Zita Grover argued that the lesbian identity depicted by this art movement was culturally specific to colonizer societies like the United States and the United Kingdom, and was thus not representative of indigenous systems of gender and sexuality.

History The company was established by the Scranton Board of Trade as the Scranton Lace Curtain Manufacturing Company in 1890 and was incorporated on June 15, 1897. The name Scranton Lace Company became standardized in 1916 when the Scranton Lace Curtain Manufacturing Company and one of its subsidiaries combined their operations. On May 13, 1958, the company changed its name to The Scranton Lace Corporation, but soon thereafter reverted to using the name The Scranton Lace Company as its official title. From 1916 to 2002 the company remained the first and largest known producer of Nottingham Lace in the United States.Scranton Lace I, Tom Bejgrowicz, Blogspot.com, 18 January 2010 (retrieved 10 January 2012) The company was the world leader in Nottingham lace and also produced tablecloths, napkins, valances, and shower curtains, among many other types of lace items. During the 1940s, the company teamed up with subsidiaries such as Victory Parachutes, Inc. and Sweeney Bros. to manufacture parachutes and camouflage netting. The company prospered well into the 1950s, but risky investments involving Hal Roach Studios and the fledgling television industry placed the company in financial peril and eventually led to its closure in 2002. Despite the factory being one of area's biggest employers, it closed in 2002 with the company's vice president telling its employees, mid-shift, that the facility was closing \\"effective immediately\\". The facility featured a theater,Photographer captures pathos of abandoned Scranton Lace Works in North Scranton, Josh McAuliffe, The Times-Tribune, 28 October 2011 (retrieved 10 January 2012) bowling alley, gymnasium, infirmary, clock tower (that is a city landmark and has a Meneely cast iron bell) and other amenities.

He was also the founder of the new Tahert. Life Abd al-Rhman was probably born in Iraq. His father, Rustam, a Persian man, leaves Iraq with his son and wife to join the Maghreb, but dies when he arrives in Mecca or its surroundings. His mother had remarried a Kairouani pilgrim she had met in Mecca and the couple raised Al-Rahman at Kairouan. Abd Al-Rahman was a quick and energetic learner, and had studied under Abu Ubaida Muslim in Basra. Abd Al-Rahman became one of the five missionaries who was ultimately responsible for the spread of the Ibadite doctrine in the Maghreb. The first Imam of the Ibadites had captured Kairawan from the Warfadjuma warriors and after his conquest, he gave several parts of Ifrikiya to Abd al-Rahman (unfortunately, in June 758- the same year- Ibn al-Asha'ath retook Kairawan). Ibn al-Ash'ath was after him though. Quickly though, Abd Al-Rahman and his son Abd al-Wahhab and their companions took refuge in central Maghrib and ended up finding the town of Tahert, which is now known as Tagdemt near Kuzul. The city was quickly populated with Abadite emigrants from Ifrikiya and Djebel Nefusa. At about 776 or 778 CE, Abd Al-Rahman became the Imamate of the Ibadites of Tahert. He seems to have had a very peaceful reign and worked hard to ensure that justice and simplicity were also instilled in Tahert's legal system. The eastern Abadite communities held high respect for him and sent him a number of money and presents, in addition to recognizing his right to an Imamate. He is allegedly to have died at about 784 CE and his son Abd Al-Wahhab was supposed to have succeeded him.

This list includes various groups of toxins, including common pollutants, pesticides, drugs, food toxins, household and industrial/workplace toxins, cigarette toxins, and uremic toxins. These toxic substances are linked to 2,086 corresponding protein/DNA target records. In total there are 42,433 toxic substance-toxin target associations. Each toxic compound record (ToxCard) in T3DB contains nearly 100 data fields and holds information such as chemical properties and descriptors, mechanisms of action, toxicity or lethal dose values, molecular and cellular interactions, medical (symptom and treatment) information (Fig. 1-3), NMR an MS spectra, and up- and down- regulated genes. This information has been extracted from over 18,000 sources, which include other databases, government documents, books, and scientific literature. The primary focus of the T3DB is on providing mechanisms of toxicity and identifying target proteins for common toxic substances. While a number of other toxic compound databases do exist, their emphasis is on covering large numbers of chemical compounds that are almost never seen outside a chemical laboratory. T3DB attempts to capture data on only those toxic substances that are abundant or in widespread use and have been detected or measured in humans. T3DB is fully searchable and supports extensive text, sequence, chemical structure, relational query and spectral searches. It is both modelled after and closely linked to the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and DrugBank.

Of the two other genera of stem tetrapods from Greenland, Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, Ymeria is most closely related to Ichthyostega, though the single known specimen is smaller, the skull about 10 cm in length. A single interclavicle resembles that of Ichthyostega, an indication Ymeria may have resembled this genus in the post-cranial skeleton.  Discovery  Ymeria is primarily known from a partial holotype skull including the lower jaws and palate, as well as impressions of the shoulder girdle. The holotype comes from the southern slope of Mt. Celsius on Ymer Island in northeast Greenland. Fossils of Devonian tetrapods like Ichthyostega have been known from Ymer Island since 1929. The skull of Ymeria found in 1947 by a team of paleontologists from Sweden and Denmark. It came from a talus slope or pile of rock fragments at the base of Mount Celsius, encased in a pale red sandstone. The fossil's origin on the mountain has not been identified. There are four formations preserved at Mt. Celsius, all belonging to the larger Celsius Bjerg Group. Since the skull cannot be traced to any one of these formations, its exact age is uncertain.  Classification  Swedish paleontologist Erik Jarvik, a member of the 1947 expedition, could not assign the skull to either Ichthyostega or Acanthostega. In 1988, English paleontologist Jennifer Clack was the first to propose that the material represented a third type of tetrapod from Greenland, based mainly on the teeth. While the skull shape is closest to Ichthyostega, the teeth are smaller, more numerous and less curved, indicating the two exploited different foods. The surface ornamentation on the skull bones are less pronounced, indicating lighter dermal armour. The material was assigned to a new genus and species, Ymeria denticulata, in 2012. The genus is named after Ymer Island, while the specific name refers to the denticulated or bumpy surface of the lower jaw.  Description  The cranium of the holotype only preserves a few fragmentary bones. The premaxillae (toothed bones at the tip of the snout) were present and seemingly bore indentations at the front for a median rostral. A small bone is preserved behind the right premaxilla. This bone may be a lateral rostral due to possessing a lateral line, but its shape is more similar to a tectal. Rostrals and tectals are small skull bones scattered around the snout, which are present in tetrapodomorph fish but lost in true tetrapods. Both maxillae (toothed bones at the side of the snout) are well-preserved, but not particularly specialized. The premaxillae and maxilla bear numerous tapering teeth, with about 11 on each premaxilla and up to 24 on each maxilla. This is slightly more than Ichthyostega (which has 8-10 on the premaxilla and 16-23 on the maxilla), and Ymeria further differs by having the largest teeth be slightly further forwards in the snout. Bones of the palate (roof of the mouth), such as the vomers, palatines, ectopterygoids, and pterygoids, are poorly preserved, but similar to those of other Devonian stem-tetrapods (in terms of both shape and dentition) when visible. A sliver of bone near the cheek region may represent a branchial element (gill bone). Preserved fragments of the shoulder girdle resemble those of Ichthyostega, such as smooth clavicles and a pointed rear stalk of the interclavicle. The lower jaws were thick and well-preserved. Their external bone texturing consisted of indistinct and shallow pits and grooves. This contrasts with Ichthyostega and Acanthostega, which have much more pronounced systems of ridges and pits. The jaw also has a (mostly) open lateral line groove on its outer surface. Like other early tetrapods and their close relatives, there were two main rows of teeth on each lower jaw. The outer (marginal) tooth row was present solely on the dentary bone, which was narrow and had alternating regions of light and absent texturing. It had at most 33 teeth, including a symphysial fang (an enlarged tooth near the chin) which was only slightly larger than the other dentary teeth. The inner tooth row stretched along four plate-like bones: the parasymphysial plate and three coronoid bones. The parasymphysial plate has a large tooth at its front edge, followed by a smaller tooth and a diastema (toothless area), similar to Ichthyostega. About 22 teeth were present in a mostly unbroken row along the coronoids. The largest coronoid teeth were present at the front of the first coronoid, the middle of the second, and (to a lesser extent) about a third the way down the rear coronoid. These large teeth are the same size as the dentary teeth. In contrast, even the largest coronoid teeth of Ichthyostega are much smaller than the dentary teeth. Another unique feature of Ymeria is the presence of a large patch of tiny tooth-like denticles on the prearticular bone, which lies directly under the inner main tooth row. This patch of denticles is unknown in Ichthyostega or any of its relatives. All of Ymeria's teeth (on both the top and bottom jaws) were sharp but conical, in contrast to the recurved teeth of Ichthyostega.

Camp history The camp was established on 14 August 1940 on the corner of Landweg and Osdorfer Stra√üe in Berlin-Lichterfelde. The commandant and camp administration offices (Kommandantur) were later located at Belle- Alliance-Stra√üe 106-107, in Kreuzberg. With prisoners from Belgium, Great Britain, France, Yugoslavia, Soviet Union, Poland, USA, Italy and Czechoslovakia, the camp's maximum capacity was 58,000 men. Prisoners were mostly allocated to sub-camps (Zweiglager) and work details (Arbeitskommando) in and around the city. Their medical needs were provided by Reserve Lazarett (\\"Reserve Hospital\\") 119 at Neuk√∂lln and RL 128 at Berlin-Biesdorf. Sub- camps Prisoners of Stalag III-D were also housed in a number of sub-camps (Zweiglager), designated Stalag III-D/Z: * Falkensee * Gro√ü Schulzendorf, Zossen * Wutzetz, Friesack (closed late 1943) * Damm I, Friesack * Damm II, Friesack (closed late 1943) * Wustrau I, Neuruppin (closed late 1943) * Wustrau II, Neuruppin * Zietenhorst, near Wustrau (closed late 1943) * Kirchhain/Niederlausitz (transferred from Stalag III-B late 1944) Two further sub-camps; Stalag III-D/999 in Zehlendorf West, Berlin, and Stalag III-D/517 at Genshagen, Ludwigsfelde, were created in May‚ÄìJune 1943 as \\"Holiday Camps\\", offering better living conditions, and a steady diet of propaganda, in an attempt to persuade prisoners into joining the British Free Corps. The Germans particularly sought out former members and sympathizers of the British Union of Fascists, but the attempt was largely a failure with the unit never numbering more than about 30 men at any time.

About 300 species of migratory birds have been recorded here. Sanctuary The sanctuary is unique having both fresh water lakes, salt and freshwater marshlands. It is spread over an area of 6.05 km2. Lonely Planet Before Indian independence, a check dam was built for storing the waters of river Ruparel just before it entered the sea. Over the years with fresh water of the rain and river on one side and salt water of the sea on the other side, a unique area was formed here. On the other side of the bund large creeks flowing from the Gulf of Kutch are located. These creeks support mangroves and other marine vegetation while on land side of the sanctuary inland vegetation like Deshi babul, Pilu, Prosopis and others are found profusely. The sanctuary is located at the watershed of Ruparel river and Kalindri at the North East coastal region of Jamnagar district in the Gulf of Kutch and has a very special and unique ecosystem. Further, as sanctuary is located near Narara Island, therefore it also has a beautiful and bio-diversified coral reef.It is also a good place to capture a perfect sunrise and sunset. Location It is located about 12 km away from Jamnagar. The nearest airport is at Jamnagar having daily direct flight to Mumbai. It was declared as a Sanctuary on 6 November 1982.Marine National Park (Khijadiya Bird Sanctuary) - Jamnagar It is the biggest bird sanctuary in Gujarat. Buses and taxis are available for going to sanctuary, form where in you have to walk about 3 km to reach inside the sanctuary.

SMPDB is designed specifically to support pathway elucidation and pathway discovery in metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and systems biology. It is able to do so, in part, by providing colorful, detailed, fully searchable, hyperlinked diagrams of five types of small molecule pathways: 1) general human metabolic pathways; 2) human metabolic disease pathways; 3) human metabolite signaling pathways; 4) drug-action pathways and 5) drug metabolism pathways. SMPDB pathways may be navigated, viewed and zoomed interactively using a Google Maps-like interface. All SMPDB pathways include information on the relevant organs, subcellular compartments, protein cofactors, protein locations, metabolite locations, chemical structures and protein quaternary structures (Fig. 1). Each small molecule in SMPDB is hyperlinked to detailed descriptions contained in the HMDB or DrugBank and each protein or enzyme complex is hyperlinked to UniProt. Additionally, all SMPDB pathways are accompanied with detailed descriptions and references, providing an overview of the pathway, condition or processes depicted in each diagram. Users can browse the SMPDB (Fig. 2) or search its contents by text searching (Fig. 3), sequence searching, or chemical structure searching. More powerful queries are also possible including searching with lists of gene or protein names, drug names, metabolite names, GenBank IDs, Swiss-Prot IDs, Agilent or Affymetrix microarray IDs. These queries will produce lists of matching pathways and highlight the matching molecules on each of the pathway diagrams. Gene, metabolite and protein concentration data can also be visualized through SMPDB's mapping interface. SMPDB is part of a suite of metabolomics databases that also includes Human Metabolome Database, DrugBank, and the Toxin and Toxin-Target Database (T3DB). While DrugBank includes information on 7000 drugs and >4200 non-redundant drug targets, enzymes, transporters, and carriers, HMDB houses over 40,000 small molecule metabolites found in the human body. The suite is complemented by T3DB with its over 3100 common toxic substances and over 1300 corresponding toxin targets. Version History The first version of SMPDB was released on January 1, 2010. This release contained more than 350 image-mapped pathways for small molecule pathways. The viewer interface was limited to scroll-bar image navigation with 3-step (small, medium, large) zooming. The pathways in this first version were limited to 1) human metabolic pathways; 2) human metabolic disease pathways; and 3) human metabolite signaling pathways. The second version of SMPDB was released in 2014. This version contained more than 620 small molecule pathways. The viewer interface was enhanced to include a Google-Map-like interface with click-n-drag image navigation and unlimited, interactive zooming.

Miller, Ferenc F√©h√©r. Khrushchev and the communist world. Kent, England, UK; Fyshwick, Australia: Croom Helm Ltd., 1984. Pp. 6-8.  Origin  Khruschevism is the name given to a broad series the Soviet Union undertook during the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev's goals were to reject the cult of personality around Stalin, liberalize the economy, and allow for greater political freedoms for the citizens of the Soviet Union.  Components   Rejection of Stalinism  Khrushchev denounced what he called Stalin's cult of personality. This involved tearing down the various statues that had been made in honor of Stalin, and allowing for arts and music that Stalin had banned.  Liberalizing the economy  Khrushchevism also rejects the strict adherence to the central planning that Stalin had used. Instead, Khrushchevism focuses less on heavy industry in the way that Stalin had, but more on consumer goods. This meant a reduction in the production of steel, and military products, and instead investment in things such as radios, televisions, medicine, and appliances.  Private Property  Khrushchevism allows for minor amounts of private property to be held, to spur economic growth and to give people better quality services should they be able to afford it. Khrushchev allowed the creation of privately owned apartment blocks, which is different from the communal housing that Stalin had enforced. This meant many people were having personal kitchens instead of communal ones for the first time.  Political Freedoms   Arts  Khrushchevism allows for the citizens to view artwork from outside the country, even if it is not supportive of the regime. Examples of this include Khrushchev letting books and movies from the west be shown in the Soviet Union, as he believed the quality of life portrayed in these works could be matched by the Soviet Union. Dudintsev's Not By Bread Alone was allowed to be published despite its criticisms of bureaucracy.  Travel  For the first time Khrushev allowed the people in the Soviet Union to travel in large groups outside of the Soviet Union. Critical of Stalin's travel restrictions, Khrushchev believed that the Soviet Citizens could see the quality of life in the west and that this would not be a problem as he would be able to match this quality of life in the Soviet Union. Over 700,000 Soviet citizens traveled abroad in 1957.

All click types (alveolar , dental , lateral , palatal , retroflex , and labial ) have linguo-glottalic variants, which occur as both stops and affricates, and may be voiced. At least a voiceless linguo-glottalic affricate is attested from all Khoisan languages of southern Africa (the Khoe, Tuu, and Kx'a language families), as well as from the Bantu language Yeyi from the same area, but they are unattested elsewhere. Analysis Traditionally, contour clicks were believed to be uvular in their rear articulation, whereas non- contour clicks were thought to be velar. However, it is now known that all clicks are uvular, at least in the languages which have been investigated, and that the articulation of these clicks is more complex than that of others but no different in location. Linguists now analyze them as either contours (that is, as a transition from one kind of sound to another within a single consonant) or as sequences of a click followed by a uvular consonant (that is, as consonant clusters).Amanda Miller, 2011. \\"The Representation of Clicks\\". In Oostendorp et al. eds., The Blackwell Companion to Phonology. See pulmonic- contour clicks for discussion. Description Phonetically, a linguo- glottalic consonant is a click in which the forward and rear articulations are released independently. The forward articulation, made with the lips or the front of the tongue, releases with a lingual airstream as in any click. The rear articulation, however, is held longer, and when it is released, it is with a glottalic airstream. (Linguo-pulmonic consonants are similar, except that the second release is pulmonic, as in English consonants.) That is, such consonants have a double release burst, one ingressive (the air pulled in by the tongue) and the other egressive (the air pushed out by the glottis). The rear articulation is involved in both: it helps create the suction that powers the first, and then is itself released for the second. Because the back of the tongue operates in the uvular or pharyngeal part of the mouth to generate the first burst, and the two bursts are very close together in time, the second release is articulated in approximately this same area. Types Four series of ejective-contour clicks (as classified by the rear release) are attested. There are two manners of articulation (stop and fricative) and two voicing contrasts, each of which is found for each of the places of articulation (as classified by the front release) that clicks use. Linguo-glottalic stops In linguo-glottalic stops, the rear articulation is released into a ejective stop. Although ejective stops are necessarily voiceless, click‚Äìejective contours may be voiced, as the voicing during the articulation of the first (click) release is stopped for the second (ejective) release. In IPA, using the alveolar series as an example, the two series are and (also , etc.). Linguo-glottalic affricates The rear articulation may also be released as a fricative. However, because the forward articulation may be considered a stop, these are called affricates rather than fricatives. There are two conventions for writing the frication: the English convention, with an x, and the Afrikaans tradition, with a g. Both are used in the orthographies of Khoisan languages. In Ju«Ä‚Äôh√µa, for example, they are written voiceless «Ék «Åk «Äk «Çk and voiced g«Ék g«Åk g«Äk g«Çk, and in the old orthography qg‚Äô xg‚Äô cg‚Äô √ßg‚Äô and dqg‚Äô dxg‚Äô dcg‚Äô d√ßg‚Äô; in Naro, they are (voiceless) qg‚Äô xg‚Äô cg‚Äô tcg‚Äô, and in Khoekhoe (Korana), «Ékh‚Äô «Åkh‚Äô «Äkh‚Äô «Çkh‚Äô. In the IPA, the two series of linguo-pulmonic affricates may be written and (also ), though with a cluster analysis they would be and . Miller (2011) distinguishes between two kinds of affricates: homorganic, where the rear articulation has the same uvular place in its release as it held during the front release, and heterorganic, where it is either velar or epiglottal. Although no language contrasts these possibilities from homorganic affricates, she holds that they are different enough in sound that considering them to be different consonants is useful. The transcriptions she uses are or (velar) and or (epiglottal).Technically they should have superscript or, in broader transcription, , but a precomposed Unicode glyph is only available for , and in most fonts the other combinations look bad. (It is not clear if the is written because the rear release is actually an affricate, or because it better distinguishes these from the homorganic/uvular case, as in broad transcription may be used for either a velar or a uvular fricative.) In G«Äui, which has a velar release, the fricative is actually lateral, and so may be narrowly transcribed as (or ).

With future senator George S. Nixon as his mentor after he settled in Winnemucca in 1899, and fellow gambler John Hennessy as his partner in the mining boomtown of Tonopah after 1901, Wingfield rose from faro-dealer to become richest man in Nevada in less than five years.http://www.goldfieldhistoricalsociety.com/featured-story- GeorgeWingfield.html Early and family life In November, 1906, the Goldfield Consolidated Mines Company was incorporated by owners George Wingfield and United States Senator George Nixon George Wingfield was born at Fort Smith, Arkansas in 1876 to Thomas Yates Wingfield (1846-1906)and his wife, the former, the former Martha Matilda Spradling (1848-1940). His grandfather Edward Wingfield had moved his family (including his 3 sons, William, Thomas and Henry and their families) from Albemarle County, Virginia to Fort Smith in 1853, then moved to Missouri during the American Civil War, then back to Arkansas, and would move through Nevada, but settle in Oregon, only to resettle in Arizona, where two of his sons had settled and he died in 1880. Meanwhile, Thomas Wingfield's family moved with his extended family to Oregon when young George was five years old, and he would became a buckaroo on a ranch in Burns. He married, but after he made his first fortune in 1906, as discussed below, his wife, May, filed for divorce; the couple received an annulment. He then married a divorced woman, Maud Azil Murdoch Hamlin (1890-1955) of San Francisco, and they had a son, George Wingfield Jr. (1914-1987).https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d;=SFC19120612.2.5&e;=-------en--20--1-- txt-txIN--------1 Wingfield later married Roxy Thoma (1892-1979), daughter of a prominent doctor in Reno, who would survive and like George Jr., be buried beside Wingfield.findagrave no. 64456859 ¬∑ Career By age 20, Wingfield had become a cattle drover, and drove herds from Oregon and California eastward to Winnemucca in Humboldt County (in the state's northwestern corner). Winnemucca was the Humboldt county seat, as well as (approximately since the Civil War) a stop on the Southern Pacific Railroad (the transcontinental railroad which acquired the Central Pacific). It was known for a variety of businesses more hidden in respectable towns, including saloons, gambling and brothels. In Winnemucca, Wingfield met former railroad man turned banker and future United States Senator George S. Nixon, sixteen years his senior, and who became his mentor. In 1899, Wingfield decided to leave the cattle business and opened a saloon in Golconda, also in Humboldt County, but sold it by 1901. He used the proceeds to travel south, arriving in Tonopah, then the county seat of Nye County and a town of about 250 residents, which was booming because Jim Butler had discovered silver ore and established a mine nearby in 1900. At first, Wingfield played poker and dealt cards for faro at the Tonopah Club, but by 1902, he and fellow gambler John Hennessey took over the club and soon made $200,000 in profits. By October 1902, Wingfield and Nixon formally became business partners, investing in mining and real estate.http://www.goldfieldhistoricalsociety.com/featured-story- GeorgeWingfield.html They soon owned the Boston-Tonopah Mining Company and the Nye County Bank, among other properties. By 1904, having grub-staked many miners after a gold strike the previous year about 27 miles away in Goldfield, Esmeralda County, Nevada, Wingfield moved to Goldfield, and also bought a saloon, which his millionaire mentor Nixon advised him to sell and concentrate on respectable investments, so over the next years they bought more real estate and all but one of the local mines.http://www.goldfieldhistoricalsociety.com/featured-story- GeorgeWingfield.html In 1904, Nixon became a U.S. Senator, representing the state. By his 30th birthday in 1906 (also the year his father died in San Francisco), Wingfield had made a fortune in Nevada, based on mine ownership in Tonopah and Goldfield. After taking their Goldfield Consolidated Mining Company public in 1906 (which he and Nixon had organized with $50 million in capital), Wingfield alone was worth $30 million. However, when their Goldfield mines became an organizing target of the Industrial Workers of the World in 1907 (and knowing the IWW had called strikes elsewhere), the mine owners closed the mines. This put between 6,000 and 8000 miners out of work, which led not only to considerable publicity, but civil unrest.

His partnership with Nixon dissolved in 1909, with Wingfield taking the mining interests and Nixon the banks.http://www.goldfieldhistoricalsociety.com/featured-story- GeorgeWingfield.html He also invested in the Coalinga Oil Field.https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d;=SFC19120612.2.5&e;=-------en--20--1--txt- txIN--------1 After Nixon's death, Wingfield bought the Golden Hotel in Reno, and he also bought the city's other major hotel (the Riverside Hotel) and the Spanish Springs hotel in Springs, would acquire many Nevada banks, and the mining company acquired international interests. Wingfield also returned to his cattle-ranching roots, operating a ranch and dairy farm in Fallon. After his mentor Nixon died in 1912, Wingfield received an appointment to fill the rest of his term, but after consulting with Nixon's financier friends, including Bernard Baruch and Henry Clay Frick, turned down the appointment.https://wingfieldfamilysociety.org/notables/george- wingfield/https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d;=SFC19120612.2.5&e;=-------en--20--1-- txt-txIN--------1 He cultivated friendships in both political parties, and his businesses survived the 1923 fire which devastated Goldfield. In the 1920s Wingfield worked with legislators to make Nevada a quickie divorce location, which helped his Reno hotel businesses. He also worked to legalize gambling, illegal in many states, especially California and other destinations easily reachable by railroad. Not only his businesses in Reno, but the entire state of Nevada became a tourist destination. In 1928, Wingfield was elected to the University Board of Regents for the University of Nevada, but rejected an offer to become a US Senator. Much of Wingfield's fortune was lost during the Great Depression. In 1931, $500,000 in state funds were missing and Wingfield was accused of embezzling them. He put up the money himself, but soon declared bankruptcy. However, by 1935 he was rebuilding his fortune, investing in the Getchell Mine near Winnemuccs. However, by 1955, he was ready to retire, selling his Reno security company and the Riverside Hotel.http://www.goldfieldhistoricalsociety.com/featured-story- GeorgeWingfield.html Death and Legacy George Wingfield died in Reno on December 25, 1959. He was survived by his widow and son, who were later buried beside him in Reno.

Controversy  The books is one of the biggest Brazilian publishing phenomenon in recent years. Although not too explored by Brazil's mainstream media, it sold 15,000 copies in one day (the whole first edition becoming a best seller by Brazil's editorial standards) and 120,000 copies in a month. It produced waves in social media and among bloggers and alternative media publications, which questioned the silence of mainstream media. Jos√© Serra called as soon as the book was published and strongly requested the bookselling company to set apart their entire stock of the book. According to an employee who preferred not to be identified, they refused to accede to Serra's request. According to the book, Serra's entire family was involved in a corruption scheme of diverting public funds to offshore financial centres in fiscal paradises and money laundering. Dep. Delegado Prot√≥genes Queiroz (PCdoB) presented a petition to install a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry in the Chamber of Deputies to investigate privatizations carried out by the Cardoso administration (1995-2002).

It is also identified as WUCAM and Vstm3. TIGIT could bind to CD155 (PVR) on dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, etc. with high affinity, and also to CD112 (PVRL2) with lower affinity. Research has shown that TIGIT-Fc fusion protein could interact with PVR on dendritic cells and increase its IL-10 secretion level/decrease its IL-12 secretion level under LPS stimulation, and also inhibit T cell activation in vivo. TIGIT's inhibition of NK cytotoxicity can be blocked by antibodies against its interaction with PVR and the activity is directed through its ITIM domain. Clinical Significance TIGIT regulates T-cell mediated immunity via the CD226/TIGIT-PVR pathway. HIV During Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, TIGIT expressing CD8+ T cells has been shown to be expanded and associated with clinical markers of HIV disease progression in a diverse group of HIV infected individuals. Elevated TIGIT levels remained sustained even among those with undetectable viral loads and a large fraction of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells simultaneously express both TIGIT and another negative checkpoint receptor, Programmed Death Protein 1 (PD-1) and retained several features of exhausted T cells. Blocking these pathways with novel targeted monoclonal antibodies synergistically rejuvenated HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Further, the TIGIT pathway is active in the rhesus macaque non-human primate model, and mimics expression and function during Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) infection. This pathway can potentially be targeted to enhance killing of HIV infected cells during \\"Shock and Kill\\" HIV curative approaches. Cancer TIGIT and PD-1 has been shown to be over expressed on tumor antigen-specific (TA-specific) CD8+ T cells and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from individuals with melanoma.

Awaska was made from llama or alpaca wool and had a high thread count (approximately 120 threads per inch).

Southeastern Woodlands Pieces of 7,000- to 8,000-year-old fabric have been found with human burials at the Windover Archaeological Site in Florida. The burials were in a peat pond. The fabric had turned into peat, but was still identifiable. Many bodies at the site had been wrapped in fabric before burial. Eighty-seven pieces of fabric were found associated with 37 burials. Researchers have identified seven different weaves in the fabric. One kind of fabric had 26 strands per inch (10 strands per centimeter). There were also weaves using two-strand and three-strand wefts. A round bag made from twine was found, as well as matting. The yarn was probably made from palm leaves.

Northwest coast Chilkat blanket in the collection of the University of Alaska Museum of the North, Fairbanks, Alaska Traditional textiles of Northwest Coast tribes are enjoying a dramatic revival. Chilkat weaving and ravenstail weaving are regarded as some of the most difficult weaving techniques in the world. A single Chilkat blanket can take an entire year to weave. In both techniques, dog, mountain goat, or sheep wool and shredded cedar bark are combined to create textiles featuring curvilinear formline designs. Tlingit weaver Jennie Thlunaut (1892‚Äì1986) was instrumental in this revival.

William I On his deathbed, William the Conqueror accorded the Duchy of Normandy to his eldest son Robert Curthose, the Kingdom of England to his son William Rufus, and money for his youngest son Henry Beauclerc for him to buy land. Thus, with William I's death on 9 September 1087, the heir to the throne was: # William Rufus (b. 1056), son of William I William II William II had no children. He and his elder brother Robert previously agreed to be each other's heir. However, on his death, on 2 August 1100, Robert was away on crusade. Their younger brother, Henry Beauclerc, had the nobility elect him as king. Henry later warred with Robert and by treaty was recognized as king. Henry I The succession to Henry I was altered by the death of his son, William Adelin. Left without male heirs, Henry took the unprecedented step of making his barons swear to accept his daughter Empress Matilda, widow of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, as his heir. However, the throne was usurped by Henry's nephew Stephen of Blois (the third son of Adela of Normandy) who claimed that Henry changed his mind on his deathbed. With the support of the barons he became King Stephen. Stephen An artist's impression of the negotiation for the throne of England between Stephen of Blois and Henry of Anjou during the Anarchy which was resolved by the Treaty of Wallingford in 1153. The succession to Stephen was altered by the death of his son Eustace, whom he wished to have crowned king during his own lifetime (in imitation of the Capetian monarchy). Though Stephen still had a son, William, the boy was still young and unprepared to challenge Henry of Anjou, the son of his cousin Matilda, for the throne. By the Treaty of Wallingford, Stephen agreed to make Henry his successor. Thus, on the day of Stephen's death, 25 October 1154, Henry became King Henry II. Henry II The succession to Henry II was altered by the death of his son, Henry the Young King, who was crowned king while his father still lived. Henry II had wished to divide his lands among his children upon his death, but was forced to sign the unfavorable treaty of Azay-le-Rideau on 4 July 1189 (two days before his death) with the king of France and his rebellious sons, by which he recognized his eldest son Richard as sole heir. On the day of Henry II's death, 6 July 1189, the throne passed smoothly to his eldest living son: Richard I. Richard I Richard had no legitimate children. On the day of his death, 6 April 1199, if the line of succession to the English throne had followed primogeniture, he would have been succeeded by his nephew Arthur I, Duke of Brittany (b. 1187), son of Richard I's brother Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany. However, since Arthur had sided with Philip II of France, Richard's enemy, Richard named his younger brother John as his heir, and he became king. John John died, on 19 October 1216, in the midst of conflict against his barons; most of them had already recognized Prince Louis of France as king. However, with John's death, his barons saw his young son as a safer option. John's eldest son became Henry III, and the French were driven away from the country. Henry III On Henry III's death, on 16 November 1272, the throne passed to his eldest son, Edward I. Edward I On Edward I's death, on 7 July 1307, the throne passed to his eldest surviving son, Edward II. Edward II On the day of Edward II's abdication, 25 January 1327, the throne passed to his eldest son, Edward III. Edward III The succession to Edward III was governed according to his entail to the crown in 1376. On his death, on 21 June 1377, the line of succession to the English throne was: # Richard of Bordeaux (b. 1367), son of Edward III's son Edward, the Black Prince (b. 1330) # John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster (b. 1340), son of Edward III # Henry Bolingbroke (b. 1367), son of John, Duke of Lancaster # Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (b. 1341), son of Edward III # Edward of Norwich (b. 1373), son of Edmund, Duke of York # Richard of Conisburgh (b. 1375), son of Edmund, Duke of York # Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester (b. 1355), son of Edward III The throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Richard II. Richard II On the day of Richard II's abdication, 29 September 1399, the line of succession to the English throne was as follows (following primogeniture, according to Richard II's entail in 1399): # Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March (b. 1391), son of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March and great-great- grandson of Edward III through Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster # Roger Mortimer (b. 1393), son of Roger #* Anne de Mortimer (b. 1390), daughter of Roger #* Eleanor de Mortimer (b. 1395), daughter of Roger # Edmund Mortimer (b. 1376), brother of Roger and great-grandson of Edward III #* Elizabeth Mortimer (b. 1371), sister of Roger and great-granddaughter of Edward III # Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland (b. 1393/1394), son of Elizabeth #* Elizabeth Percy (b. circa 1395), daughter of Elizabeth #* Philippa Mortimer (b. 1375), sister of Roger and great-granddaughter of Edward III # Henry Bolingbroke (b. 1367), son of John, 1st Duke of Lancaster However, upon Richard's abdication the throne was taken by Henry Bolingbroke as Henry IV. Henry IV Henry had justified his usurpation by emphasizing his descent in the male line. Thus, the Lancastrian line of succession is agnatic, similar to the French succession. On the day of Henry IV's death, 20 March 1413, the line of succession to the English throne following agnatic primogeniture was: # Henry of Monmouth, Prince of Wales (b. 1387), son of Henry IV # Thomas, Duke of Clarence (b. 1388), son of Henry IV # John, Duke of Bedford (b. 1389), son of Henry IV # Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (b. 1390), son of Henry IV # Edward, Duke of York (b. 1373), son of Edmund, 1st Duke of York # Richard, Earl of Cambridge (b. 1375), son of Edmund, 1st Duke of York # Richard Plantagenet (b. 1411), son of Richard, Earl of Cambridge Upon his death, the throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Henry V. Henry V On the day of Henry V's death, 31 August 1422, the line of succession following agnatic primogeniture was: # Henry, Duke of Cornwall (b. 1421), son of Henry V # John, Duke of Bedford (b. 1389), brother of Henry V # Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (b. 1390), brother of Henry V # Richard, Duke of York (b. 1411), son of Richard, Earl of Cambridge Upon his death, the throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Henry VI. Henry VI (first instance) On the day of Henry VI's first deposition, 4 March 1461, the line of succession following agnatic primogeniture was; # Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales (b. 1453), son of Henry VI # Edward, Duke of York (b. 1442), son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York # George Plantagenet (b. 1449), son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York # Richard Plantagenet (b. 1452), son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York However, during the Wars of the Roses, Henry VI was forcibly deposed by his third cousin twice removed, Edward, Duke of York, who became Edward IV. Edward IV (first instance) On the day of Edward IV's deposition, 3 October 1470, the line of succession following male-preference primogeniture was; # George, Duke of Clarence (b. 1449), brother of Edward IV # Richard, Duke of Gloucester (b. 1452), brother of Edward IV # Anne of York (b. 1439), sister of Edward IV # Elizabeth of York, Duchess of Suffolk (b. 1444), sister of Edward IV # John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln (b. 1462), son of Elizabeth, Duchess of Suffolk # Edward de la Pole (b. 1466), son of Elizabeth, Duchess of Suffolk # Elizabeth de la Pole (born c. 1468), daughter of Elizabeth, Duchess of Suffolk # Margaret of York (b. 1446), sister of Edward IV However, Edward IV was deposed, and the throne was restored to Henry VI, the previous monarch, during the period known as the Readeption of Henry VI. Henry VI (second instance) On the day of Henry VI's second deposition, 11 April 1471, the line of succession following agnatic primogeniture was: # Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales (b. 1453), son of Henry VI Edward IV and his descendants were removed from the Lancastrian succession due to an attainder #* Edward Plantagenet (b. 1442), son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York #* Edward Plantagenet (b. 1470), son of Edward Plantagenet # George, Duke of Clarence (b. 1449), son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York Prince Richard of Gloucester was also removed from the succession as he had fled with his brother Edward #* Richard Plantagenet (b. 1452), son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York However, the English nobility again became frustrated with Henry's inability to rule competently, and reinstalled Edward IV as king after less than a year.  Edward IV (second instance)  On the day of Edward IV's death, 9 April 1483, the line of succession following male-preference primogeniture was: # Edward, Prince of Wales (b. 1470), son of Edward IV # Richard, Duke of York (b. 1473), son of Edward IV Prince George of Clarence's son Edward was debarred from the succession due to his father's attainder # Elizabeth of York (b. 1466) # Mary of York (b. 1467), daughter of Edward IV # Cecily of York (b. 1469), daughter of Edward IV # Anne of York (b. 1475), daughter of Edward IV # Catherine of York (b. 1479), daughter of Edward IV # Bridget of York (b. 1480), daughter of Edward IV #* Edward Plantagenet (b. 1475), son of George, Duke of Clarence # Richard, Duke of Gloucester (b. 1452), son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York # Edward of Middleham (b. 1473), son of Richard, Duke of Gloucester Upon his death, the throne passed smoothly to the first person in line, who became Edward V.  Edward V  On the day of Edward V's deposition, 25 June 1483, the line of succession following male-preference primogeniture was: # Richard, Duke of York (b. 1473), son of Edward IV Prince George of Clarence's son Edward was debarred from the succession due to his father's attainder. This was confirmed by Parliament following the King's deposition # Elizabeth of York (b. 1466), daughter of Edward IV # Mary of York (b. 1467), daughter of Edward IV # Cecily of York (b. 1469), daughter of Edward IV # Anne of York (b. 1475), daughter of Edward IV # Catherine of York (b. 1479), daughter of Edward IV # Bridget of York (b. 1480), daughter of Edward IV #* Edward Plantagenet (b. 1475), son of George, Duke of Clarence # Richard, Duke of Gloucester (b. 1452), son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York # Edward of Middleham (b. 1473), son of Richard, Duke of Gloucester The throne was usurped by Edward V's uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who claimed that Edward V (and all his siblings) were illegitimate and therefore could not ascend the throne. Gloucester, as the following heir through primogeniture, became Richard III. Richard III Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field. He was succeeded by the victor of the battle, Henry Tudor, 2nd Earl of Richmond, a descendant in a legitimated line of John of Gaunt. He became Henry VII. He also buffered his claim by marrying Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, his heir by male-preference primogeniture upon the deaths of her brothers. Henry VII On the day of Henry VII's death, 21 April 1509, the throne passed to his oldest living son, Henry VIII. Henry VIII On the day of Henry VIII's death, 28 January 1547, the line of succession was governed by the Third Succession Act: # Prince Edward (b. 1537), only legitimate son of Henry VIII # Lady Mary (b. 1516), elder daughter of Henry VIII # Lady Elizabeth (b. 1533), younger daughter of Henry VIII #:Descendants of Henry's elder sister Margaret, Queen of Scots who would have been next in line were excluded by Henry's will: #* Mary, Queen of Scots (b. 1542), Margaret's granddaughter through James V of Scotland #* Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox (b. 1515), Margaret's daughter by Lord Angus #*Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley (b. 1545), Lady Lennox's son. #:Frances Grey, daughter of Henry's younger sister Mary Tudor, was excluded by Henry's will, but her heirs of the body were included. # Lady Jane Grey (b. 1536/7), Frances Grey's eldest daughter (later briefly queen regnant) # Lady Catherine Grey (b. 1540), Frances Grey's second daughter # Lady Mary Grey (b. 1545), Frances Grey's third daughter #:Eleanor Clifford, Countess of Cumberland (b. 1519), Frances Grey's sister was also excluded by Henry's will, but not her heirs of the body: # Lady Margaret Clifford (b. 1540), Eleanor Clifford's daughter Upon Henry's death, the throne passed to Henry's son, who became Edward VI.

The company is headquartered in 's-Hertogenbosch and its North American headquarters are in Radnor, Pennsylvania. History The company was founded in 's-Hertogenbosch (Den Bosch) in September 1997 by former Bolesian employees including Dr. Victor Allis. Allis and several colleagues initially began developing a scheduling application for an aluminum manufacturer as a side project. It was offered first to Allis's then-employer, but Bolesian was not interested. Because the software they developed was highly configurable, and thus of use to many other types of companies, it was decided that a new firm should be created around the software. Preparing the software for sale to as wide a variety as possible of corporate customers took two years of development. Quintiq sold its software to a client for the first time in 1999. In 2011, two investment firms, LLR Partners Inc. and NewSpring Capital Ventures LP, bought into Quintiq, giving them a 48% stake in the company's ownership. Later in 2014, Quintiq was bought by Dassault Syst√®mes. Products Quintiq's Supply Chain Planning software has three layers or modules: one based on service-oriented architecture, with both optimization and planning management features; one that provides a variety of different templates for use in different industries; and one customized for each Quintiq customer. Unlike competitor software, Quintiq's uses AI pattern recognition to help customers manage their supply chain logistics. Other features of the software include adaptive capacity planning, automated real-time scheduling, a multi-function company planner, a multi-scenario macro planner, materials management tools, and proprietary algorithms for coordinating production with customer orders. Competitor software is more robust in a number of specific areas, and for this reason some Quintiq users employ both Quintiq software and competitors' products in a hybrid approach to supply chain management. Locations In addition to its world headquarters in Den Bosch and its North American headquarters in Radnor, Quintiq has offices in Melbourne, Australia; Shanghai, China; Vantaa, Finland; Mannheim, Germany; Rome, Italy; Petaling Jaya, Malaysia; and London, United Kingdom. Clients Notable companies and organizations which use Quintiq software include Copenhagen Airport, Danone, international shipping company DHL, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Jumbo (supermarket), KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, freight forwarder P&O; Ferrymasters, and retailer Walmart.  Acquisition  On July 24, 2014, Dassault Syst√®mes announced plans to acquire Quintiq for $336 million. The deal was subject to regulatory approval in Germany and Austria.

Rickard was the middle of two siblings. He had an older brother, James Robert Rickard and younger sister, Consuelo \\"Connie\\" Rickard. Rickard lived in and attended school in Santa Barbara until the 1925 earthquake destroyed the family home on Victoria Street. On June 28, 1925, Rickard and his family moved to the family's ranch, the El Encinal, in Los Alamos, California. When school was ready to start in the fall, the family moved to Hancock Park in Los Angeles. While living in Los Angeles, Rickard and his brother, Robert, attended Urban Military Academy and Loyola High School; however, summers were always spent in Los Alamos on the Ranch. Rickard began his college career at Loyola University but after the completion of his sophomore year decided to transfer to the University of Santa Clara where he earned a bachelor's degree. Upon completion of college, Rickard decided to follow in his father's footsteps and become an attorney. He attended the University of California's law school, Boalt Hall, and earned his law degree and passed the bar in 1939. Rickard set up a law practice in Los Angeles and practiced there until he enlisted in the US Navy when the United States entered into World War II.  Marriage and children  In 1943, while serving in the Navy, Rickard married Marion Esther Foster of Des Moines, Iowa in Miami, Florida. They would remain married until Marion's death in 1987. Rickard and Marion had five sons: James Bickle (1946), Robert Webb (1947), John Treloar Jr. (1948), Thomas Orena (1950), and Dennis Foster (1953-2015).  World War II years  In 1942, Rickard enlisted in the United States Navy. He would serve in the South Pacific with the Navy until 1945 gaining the rank of Lieutenant Commander. Rickard was honorably discharged from the Navy in 1945. During his time in the Navy his brother Robert was killed in action while on duty on the USS Franklin in the South Pacific. Also during this time, Rickard's father, James Bickel Rickard, retired Santa Barbara Postmaster was stricken with appendicitis while at the family ranch and died before receiving the proper medical attention.  \\"Old Spanish Days\\" and mayoral years  At the end of the War, Rickard returned to Santa Barbara to set up his practice as an attorney. Rickard was instrumental in revitalizing a local festival called \\"Old Spanish Days Fiesta\\", which had been placed on hold due to World War II and the subsequent droughts in Southern California. He would be El Presidente for \\"Old Spanish Days Fiesta\\" in 1948 and 1949. In the mid to late 1940s he would serve as City Harbor Commissioner and as City Attorney of Santa Barbara. In 1953, he ran for and was elected Mayor of Santa Barbara. He would serve two terms as Mayor (1953-1954, 1955-1956). His terms as Mayor are largely considered to have been very successful. During his mayoral terms the following was accomplished: * \\"Voluntary Annexations\\" for City services helped Santa Barbara's City limits expanded to include Coast Village Road to the East and Highway 154 (Five Points) to the West. * City Hall would also approve bonds to acquire the land for Shoreline Park. * City Hall would secure Real Estate that would later become Mackenzie Park and the Municipal Golf Course. * A sign ordinance would be adopted that limited the size and height of signage in Santa Barbara. * A new police station and fire station were built. Both remain in use today. * City trash and paving contracts were put out to bid. The cost savings helped fund sidewalks and street paving on the lower Eastside. * Boat slips were built in the harbor for the 1st time. * Trash burning in the backyard was banned and trash collection was regulated, as not to allow trash to be picked up curbside. However, the most important accomplishment by City Hall during that time may have been the no drilling sanctuary that was enacted on August 27, 1954. The sanctuary spanned from Summerland (Sheffield Drive) to UCSB (16 miles long). This gave the City of Santa Barbara jurisdiction from its shoreline to the three-mile limit where federal control begins. Rickard felt the sanctuary was needed to \\"protect beautiful beach recreational and residential areas from desecration by oil well development...\\". Rickard & Reagan Rickard chose not to run for a third term as Mayor and would return to his career as a lawyer. He would remain politically involved in Santa Barbara. During this time he worked intimately with the likes of city matriarch Pearl Chase and former Santa Barbara News- Press owner T.M. Storke to promote the creation of ‚Äúsmokeless‚Äù industry based on the research and development potential offered by UCSB. He believed that essential to that vision was a full service commercial airport capable of handling the new generation of large jet planes. It was he who figured out that by extending city jurisdiction to include a 50-foot-wide ribbon of land underneath the ocean that ran up the coast to the airport, Santa Barbara could claim the airport as ‚Äúcontiguous‚Äù property, essential to the annexation process. The shoestring annexation would allow the City of Santa Barbara to make improvements, upgrades, and operations expansions required to meet federal requirements to retain commercial carriers vital to Santa Barbara's economic vitality. On November 14, 1961 the airport land was annexed by the City of Santa Barbara. In 1968, after spending the majority of his professional career as a lawyer, he was appointed a Superior Court Judge by the Governor of California, Ronald Reagan. The following year (1969) he was honored as Santa Barbara's \\"Man of the Year\\". Rickard would serve for 14 impeccable years on the bench before retiring in 1982. In his honor, the County Bar presents an annual award, the John T. Rickard Judicial Service Award, to an individual who has made outstanding contributions to the judiciary and/or the local court system.  Legacy  On October 30, 2012 the Santa Barbara City Council voted 5-2 to name the new $63 million airport terminal, the John T. Rickard Terminal.

According to the 2011 India Census, Jains represent 0.12% of the total population of Tamil Nadu, and are of the Digambara sect. Tamil Jains are primarily concentrated in northern Tamil Nadu, in the districts of Madurai, Viluppuram, Kanchipuram, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai, Cuddalore and Thanjavur. History Early Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions in Tamil Nadu date to the 3rd century BCE and describe the livelihoods of Tamil Jains. Inscriptions dating back to 8th century CE were found in Tiruchirappalli narrating the presence of Jain monks in the region.A 7th-century Jain Sittanavasal Cave painting. The Kalabhra dynasty, who were patrons of Jainism, ruled over the entire ancient Tamil country in the 3rd‚Äì7th century CE. Pallavas followed Hinduism but also patronized Jainism. The Trilokyanatha Temple in Kanchipuram and Chitharal Jain Temple were built during the reign of the Pallava dynasty.http://www.thehindu.com/thread/arts-culture-society/article8179948.ece The Pandyan kings were initially Jains but later became Shaivaites. Strabo states that an Indian king called Pandion sent Augustus \\"presents and gifts of honour\\". The Sittanavasal Cave and Samanar Malai are Jain complexes that were built during the reign of Pandyan dynasty. The Cholas patronized Hinduism, however, Jainism also flourished during their rule. The construction of Tirumalai cave complex was commissioned Queen Kundavai, elder sister of Rajaraja Chola I. The Tirumalai cave complex consists of 3 Jain caves, 2 Jain temples and a high sculpture of Tirthankara Neminatha which is the tallest idol of Neminatha and the largest Jain idol in Tamil Nadu. The Digambara Jain Temple in Thirakoil and the Mallinathaswamy Jain Temple in Mannargudi were both built during the reign of the Chola dynasty.  Decline of Jainism  Royal patronage has been a key factor in the growth as well as decline of Jainism. The Pallava king Mahendravarman I (600630 CE) converted from Jainism to Shaivism under the influence of Appar. His work Mattavilasa Prahasana ridicules certain Shaiva sects and the Buddhists and also expresses contempt towards Jain ascetics. Sambandar converted the contemporary Pandya king to Shaivism. During the 11th century, Basava, a minister to the Jain king Bijjala, succeeded in converting numerous Jains to the Lingayat Shaivite sect. The Lingayats destroyed various temples belonging to Jains and adapted them to their use. The Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana (c.11081152 CE) became a follower of the Vaishnava sect under the influence of saint Ramanuja, after which Vaishnavism grew rapidly.  Art   Influence on Tamil literature  A palm leaf manuscript with ancient Tamil text thumb Parts of the Sangam literature in Tamil is attributed to Jain authors. The authenticity and interpolations are controversial, because the Sangam literature presents Hindu ideas. Some scholars state that the Jain portions of the Sangam literature was added about or after the 8th-century CE, and it is not the ancient layer. Tamil Jain texts such as the Cƒ´vaka CintƒÅma·πái and NƒÅla·π≠iyƒÅr are credited to Digambara Jain authors. These texts have seen interpolations and revisions. For example, it is generally accepted now that the Jain nun Kanti inserted a 445 verse poem into Cƒ´vaka CintƒÅma·πái in the 12th-century. The Tamil Jain literature, states Dundas, has been \\"lovingly studied and commented upon for centuries by Hindus as well as Jains\\". The themes of two of the Tamil epics, including the Silapadikkaram, have an embedded influence of Jainism. Silappatikaram, the earliest surviving epic in Tamil literature, was written by the monk Ilango Adigal. This epic is a major work in Tamil literature, describing the historical events of its time and also of then-prevailing religions, Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism. The main characters of this work, Kannagi and Kovalan, who have a divine status among Tamils, were Jains. M. Karunanidhi, the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and writer stated that, \\"the virtuous Jains have adorned our ‚ÄòTamil mother‚Äô with innumerable jewels of literary works. If you remove these works of Samanars, the world of Tamil literature would wear a deserted look; such is the contribution of Jain poets to the Tamil language. The ancient kings have also encouraged and supported these noble efforts.\\"https://balpatil.wordpress.com/2010/09/06/jainism-in- tamilnadu-chief-minister-dr-m-karunanidhi-on-jainism-and-tamilnadu/  Jain structures  Tirumalai|thumb There are 26 caves, 200 stone beds, 60 inscriptions, and over 100 sculptures in and around Madurai. This is also the site where Jain ascetics wrote great epics and books on grammar in Tamil. The Sittanavasal Cave temple is regarded as one of the finest examples of Jain art. It is the oldest and most famous Jain centre in the region. It possesses both an early Jain cave shelter, and a medieval rock-cut temple with excellent fresco paintings comparable to Ajantha paintings; the steep hill contains an isolated but spacious cavern. Locally, this cavern is known as \\"Eladipattam\\", a name that is derived from the seven holes cut into the rock that serve as steps leading to the shelter. Within the cave there are seventeen stone beds aligned in rows; each of these has a raised portion that could have served as a pillow-loft. The largest stone bed has a distinct Tamil-Brahmi inscription assignable to the 2nd century BCE, and some inscriptions belonging to the 8th century BCE are also found on the nearby beds. The Sittannavasal cavern continued to be the \\"Holy Sramana Abode\\" until the 7th and 8th centuries. Inscriptions over the remaining stone beds name mendicants such as Tol kunrattu Kadavulan, Tirunilan, Tiruppuranan, Tittaicharanan, Sri Purrnacandran, Thiruchatthan, Ilangowthaman, Sri Ulagathithan, and Nityakaran Pattakali as monks. The Kazhugumalai temple from the 8th century CE marks the revival of Jainism in Tamil Nadu. This cave temple was built by King Parantaka Nedunjadaiya of Pandyan dynasty. Mel Sithamur Jain Math is headed by the primary religious head of this community, Bhattaraka Laxmisena Swami.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 6. Noori was released from the detention camp on May 31, 2014, in a prisoner exchange that involved Bowe Bergdahl and the Taliban five, and flown to Qatar. Intelligence analysts estimated he was born in 1967 in Shajoie, Afghanistan. Norullah Noori was the Taliban's Governor of Balkh Province. 2001 press reports describe General Rashid Dostum bringing Noori with him when he toured the ruins the Qala-i-Jangi fortress, after over 400 captives died there in what is usually described as a failed prison uprising. Noori was reported to have ordered the Taliban fighters in his jurisdiction to peacefully surrender to Dostum's Northern Alliance forces. Norullah has been listed by the United Nations 1267 Committee since January 25, 2001. Norullah Noori arrived at Guantanamo on January 11, 2002, and was held there for 12 years. The allegations used to justify his detention in Guantanamo asserted he was an interim Provincial Governor of Jalalabad, temporary governor of Mazari Sharif and Governor of Balkh Province. Neither Jalalabad or Mazari Sharif is a Province. They are cities. Throughout the fall of 2011 and the winter of 2012, the United States conducted peace negotiations with the Taliban and widely leaked was that a key sticking point was the ongoing detention of Norullah and four other senior Taliban. Negotiations hinged on a proposal to send the five men directly to Doha, Qatar, where they would be allowed to set up an official office for the Taliban. Governor under the Taliban Farida Kuchi, a Kuchi nomad tribeswoman who ran as a candidate for the Wolesi Jirga in 2005, described her delivery of a list of 1000 Kuchi stranded in an impromptu refugee camp to then Governor of Balkh Noori as the beginning of her political activism in 1998. Fareeda told Carlotta Gall, of the New York Times that Noori accepted her list, and forwarded to humanitarian agencies, and aid did arrive. In the fall of 2001, when the United States, allied with the Northern Alliance and other anti-Taliban forces, started to use military force to seek out al Qaeda, Noori was one Taliban leader who is reported to have directed the Taliban fighters in his province to lay down their weapons and surrender. In December 2001, shortly after the overthrow of the Taliban, Human Rights Watch called for a human rights tribunal to be convened against Noorullah and two other former Taliban Governors of Northern Provinces to investigate claims they had been responsible for alleged massacres of Hazara and Uzbek civilians. The reports of civilian massacres were alleged to have occurred during the previous three years (1998-2001). The two other Taliban leaders were Mullah Dadullah and Mullah Mohammed Fazil. Fazil, like Norullah, had already surrendered and would be sent to Guantanamo. Held aboard the USS Bataan Former Taliban Ambassador to Pakistan Abdul Salam Zaeef described being flown to the United States Navy's amphibious warfare vessel, the USS Bataan, for special interrogation. Zaeef wrote that the cells were located six decks down, were only 1 meter by 2 meters. He wrote that the captives weren't allowed to speak with one another, but that he \\"eventually saw that Mullahs Fazal, Noori, Burhan, Wasseeq Sahib and Rohani were all among the other prisoners.\\" Historian Andy Worthington, author of The Guantanamo Files, identified Noori as one of the men Zaeef recognized. He identified Mullah Wasseeq as Abdul-Haq Wasiq, Mullah Rohani as Gholam Ruhani and Mullah Fazal as Mohammed Fazil. Combatant Status Review Tribunal Combatant Status Review Tribunals were held in a 3 x 5 meter trailer. The captive sat with his hands and feet shackled to a bolt in the floor.Guant√°namo Prisoners Getting Their Day, but Hardly in Court, New York Times, November 11, 2004 - mirror Inside the Guant√°namo Bay hearings: Barbarian \\"Justice\\" dispensed by KGB-style \\"military tribunals\\", Financial Times, December 11, 2004 Three chairs were reserved for members of the press, but only 37 of the 574 Tribunals were observed. Initially, the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the Geneva Conventions to captives from the war on terror. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the U.S. could not evade its obligation to conduct competent tribunals to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status. Subsequently, the Department of Defense instituted the Combatant Status Review Tribunals. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were lawful combatants‚Äîrather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an enemy combatant. Summary of Evidence memo A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Mullah Norullah Noori's Combatant Status Review Tribunal, on August 8, 2004. The memo listed the following allegations against him: Transcript Noori chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as \\"enemy combatants\\" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual Administrative Review Board hearings. The Administrative Review Boards weren't authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status and they weren't authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an \\"enemy combatant\\". They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States because they continued to pose a threat‚Äîor whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free.

England, the Designated Civilian Official. The review board convened on January 31, 2007. The board's recommendation was unanimous but was also redacted. The Board's recommendation was forwarded to England on March 29, 2007, and England authorized his continued detention on April 2, 2007. Writ of habeas corpus Norullah Noori had a writ of habeas corpus, Civil Action No. 08-cv-1828, filed on his behalf in late 2008 before US District Court Judge Ricardo M. Urbina. On December 17, 2008, Patricia A. Sullivan filed a \\"status report\\" on his behalf. She reported that Norullah Noori had a DTA appeal filed on his behalf in 2007. Joint Review Task Force When he assumed office in January 2009, President Barack Obama made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo. He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp and also promised to institute a new review system. That new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back a year later, the Joint Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request. Norullah Noori was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release. Although Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board, less than a quarter of men have received a review. Release negotiations Most Afghans who had been held in detention at the U.S. facility had been repatriated to Afghanistan by 2009. Throughout the fall of 2011 and the winter of 2012, the United States conducted peace negotiations with the Taliban and widely leaked that a key sticking point was the ongoing detention of Norullah and four other senior Taliban, Khirullah Khairkhwa, Mohammed Fazl, Abdul Haq Wasiq and . Negotiations hinged on a proposal to send the five men directly to Doha, Qatar, where they would be allowed to set up an official office for the Taliban. In March 2012, it was reported that Ibrahim Spinzada, described as \\"Karzai's top aide\\" had spoken with the five men in Guantanamo earlier that month and had secured their agreement to be transferred to Qatar. Karzai, who had initially opposed the transfer, then reportedly backed the plan. It was reported that U.S. officials stated the Obama administration had not yet agreed to transfer the five men. Release from Guantanamo Bay Noori and four other prisoners who were known as the Taliban five were released from Guantanamo Bay and flown by U.S. military C-17 aircraft into Qatar on June 1, 2014, where they were set free. Their release was in exchange for that of U.S. soldier Bowe Bergdahl who had been captured in Afghanistan five years earlier. The exchange was brokered by the Emir of Qatar. Noori and the others were required to stay in Qatar for 12 months as a condition of their release. Upon his release, the Taliban confirmed that Noori was eager to resume his efforts to kill Americans. \\"After arriving in Qatar, Noorullah Noori kept insisting he would go to Afghanistan and fight American forces there,\\" a Taliban commander told reporters.

The tree was once known as the Hillgrove Lockup. Prison usage Evidence indicates that police on patrol from Wyndham in the 1890s noticed that holes in the upper branches indicated that the tree was hollow and so cut an opening into the tree to use it as a lockup for Aboriginal prisoners on their way to Wyndham for sentencing, as this excerpt from a 1931 news article suggests. > The bottle tree known as Hillgrove lockup, situated on the King River 25 > miles from Wyndham is a tree with a history.

The continuation of the 1931 article also states that it \\"has accommodated 30 prisoners at one time\\", however this is likely to be an exaggeration. Another 1940 news article states, probably more accurately, that when there was not enough room for all prisoners inside the tree, that they were chained to the outside of the tree. The article goes on to describe the escape of a prisoner who had been chained outside the tree. > Some years ago a trooper was bringing into Wyndham a party in chains when at > dusk they arrived at the baob-tree.

However a photograph at the State Library of South Australia taken clearly shows the words \\"Hillgrove Lockup\\" cut into the trunk. With hundreds of new names and initials that have been cut into the boab since then and with time, this has almost completely disappeared and had become an almost forgotten name for the tree. A 1966 news article states that the Boab Prison Tree, Derby had never been used as a prison, though confirms that the Boab Prison tree at Wyndham had been used.

Ayurvedic physicians (5th/6th century BC) first noted the sweet taste of diabetic urine, and called the condition madhumeha (\\"honey urine\\"). The term \\"diabetes\\" traces back to Demetrius of Apamea (1st century BC). For a long time, the condition was described and treated in traditional Chinese medicine as xiƒÅo kƒõ (Ê∂àÊ∏¥; \\"wasting-thirst\\"). Physicians of the medieval Islamic world, including Avicenna, have also written on diabetes. Early accounts often referred to diabetes as a disease of the kidneys. In 1674, Thomas Willis suggested that diabetes may be a disease of the blood. Johann Peter Frank is credited with distinguishing diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus in 1794. In regard to diabetes mellitus, Joseph von Mering and Oskar Minkowski are commonly credited with the formal discovery (1889) of a role for the pancreas in causing the condition. In 1893, √âdouard Laguesse suggested that the islet cells of the pancreas, described as \\"little heaps of cells\\" by Paul Langerhans in 1869, might play a regulatory role in digestion. These cells were named Islets of Langerhans after the original discoverer. In the beginning of the 20th century, physicians hypothesized that the islets secrete a substance (named \\"insulin\\") that metabolises carbohydrates. The discovery and purification of insulin for clinical use between 1921‚Äì1922 by a group of researchers in Toronto‚ÄîFrederick Banting, J.J.R. Macleod, Charles Best, and James Collip‚Äîpaved the way for treatment. The patent for insulin was assigned to the University of Toronto in 1923 for a symbolic dollar to keep treatment accessible. In regard to diabetes insipidus, treatment became available before the causes of the disease were clarified. The discovery of an antidiuretic substance extracted from the pituitary gland by researchers in Italy (A. Farini and B. Ceccaroni) and Germany (R. Von den Velden) in 1913 paved the way for treatment. By the 1920s, accumulated findings defined diabetes insipidus as a disorder of the pituitary. The main question now became whether the cause of diabetes insipidus lay in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, given their intimate connection. In 1954, Berta and Ernst Scharrer concluded that the hormones were produced by the nuclei of cells in the hypothalamus. Early accounts  Ancient Egypt (c. 1550 BC)  Ebers Papyrus The Ebers Papyrus is among the oldest and most important medical papyri of Ancient Egypt. Written circa 1550 BC, it was likely copied from a series of much earlier texts, and contains a passage from the First Dynasty (c. 3400 BC). The document is named after Georg Ebers, who purchased the document in 1872 in the city of Luxor, the site of Thebes (known to Ancient Egyptians as Waset). Thebes was the most venerated city of Ancient Egypt in its heyday during the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom. The Ebers Papyrus is thought to contain the first known medical reference to diabetes, by the phrase: \\"...to eliminate urine which is too asha\\". The crucial word asha can mean both \\"plentiful\\" and \\"often\\". It is unclear whether the condition described was excessive urine (polyuria), which may have been symptomatic of diabetes, or increased frequency of urine, very often due to urinary tract infection. The following mixture was prescribed for treatment: \\"A measuring glass filled with Water from the Bird pond, Elderberry, Fibres of the asit plant, Fresh Milk, Beer- Swill, Flower of the Cucumber, and Green Dates\\". Urinary troubles in the adult were also corrected with \\"rectal injections of olive oil, honey, sweet beer, sea salt, and seeds of the wonderfruit\\". Charaka (c. 500 BC)  Ayurveda (5th/6th century BC)  Ayurveda is a Hindu system of medicine with historic roots in the Indian subcontinent. Some of its conceptual origins trace back to the Indus Valley Civilisation. It developed significantly through the Vedic period. Polyuria in diabetes was associated with a sweet taste in Sanskrit texts of the 5th/6th century BC, at the time of two notable physicians Sushruta and Charaka. They described several diseases of polyuric nature collectively called Prameha (\\"to flow\\"). Included in this group of ailments was the equivalent of diabetes mellitus, madhumeha (\\"honey urine\\"), named as such because the sweet urine of patients would attract ants and flies. These patients are said to have suffered from extreme thirst and foul breath. Ayurvedic texts provided dietary prescriptions for the condition. They constitute the earliest known references to the presence of sugar in the urine (glycosuria) and to dietary remedies, at least a thousand years before modern European descriptions began to more comprehensively conceptualize the disease. Sushruta and Charaka also identified the two types of diabetes mellitus, later dubbed Type I and Type II diabetes.  Ancient China  Qing-era drawing of the lungs and heart nexus. Illustrates the Huangdi Neijing (The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine) Modern-day diabetes is associated with two terms in the Chinese language. The traditional term, xiƒÅo kƒõ (Ê∂àÊ∏¥), means \\"wasting-thirst\\" and correlates closely with diabetes in most instances of historical description. The more modern term, t√°ng ni«éo b√¨ng (Á≥ñÂ∞øÁóÖ), means \\"sugar urine disease\\", and is equivalent to diabetes mellitus. It has been suggested that the modern term is derived from exchanges with Ayurvedic practitioners who called the condition madhumeha (\\"honey urine\\"). Within the Sinosphere (regions of East and Southeast Asia historically influenced by the linguistic and literary traditions of the Chinese empire), this etymology has also been borrowed into Korean (tang nyo byeong [ÎãπÎá®Î≥ë]) and Japanese (tou nyo byou [„Å®„ÅÜ„Å´„Çá„ÅÜ„Å≥„Çá„ÅÜ]). Reviews of diabetology history in Traditional Chinese medicine have classified the diagnosis and treatment of xiƒÅo kƒõ (Ê∂àÊ∏¥) into four periods, summarized below. Classic texts provided a typology of the condition and outlined various recommendations on diagnosis, development, treatment, and prevention. Knowledge of wasting-thirst was integrated with knowledge of diabetes during the Qing dynasty.  The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine (475 BC-8 AD)  Hu√°ngd√¨ N√®ijƒ´ng (ÈªÉÂ∏ùÂÖßÁ∂ì), or The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, is a fundamental ancient text in Chinese medicine and a major book of Daoist philosophy and lifestyle. It is generally dated to the late Warring States period (475‚Äì221 BC) and the Western Han dynasty (206 BC-8 AD). The text named the condition xiƒÅo kƒõ (Ê∂àÊ∏¥; \\"wasting- thirst\\") and elaborated on it through 25 clauses. It recorded such symptoms as \\"three increases [excess] and one decrease [loss]\\": excessive thirst (polydypsia), excessive hunger (polyphagia), excessive urine (polyuria), and weight loss. Three sub-phases of xiƒÅo kƒõ were given, characterized by their dominant symptoms. These roughly correspond to the progressive stages of diabetes in modern-day Western medicine.  The Treatise on Cold Damage and Miscellaneous Diseases (9-280 AD)  Woodcut of Zhang Zhongjing. Engraved during the reign of Wanli of the Ming dynasty. ShƒÅngh√°n Z√°b√¨ng L√πn (ÂÇ∑ÂØíÈõúÁóÖË´ñ), or , is the first Chinese monograph on diseases by Zhang Zhongjing. The original work is lost, but most of its contents are preserved in two extant works called ShƒÅngh√°n L√πn (ÂÇ∑ÂØíË´ñ; \\"The Treatise on Cold Damage\\") and Jƒ´ngu√¨ Y√†ol√º√® (ÈáëÂå±Ë¶ÅÁï•; \\"Essential Prescriptions from the Golden Chamber\\"). The first work primarily addresses externally triggered conditions while the latter work describes internally generated conditions. Zhang's specialized chapter on xiƒÅo kƒõ is found in ShƒÅngh√°n L√πn and Jƒ´ngu√¨ Y√†ol√º√®. Nine subsections and nine formulae (herbal remedies) on wasting-thirst were recorded. The text proposed a theory of \\"three wasting-thirsts\\": upper- (associated with the lungs), middle- (associated with the stomach), and lower- (associated with the kidneys), all three of which shared excessive urine and thirst as symptoms. This theory was later expanded through the works of Liu Wansu (1120‚Äì1200 AD) and Wang Kentang (1549‚Äì1613 AD). According to Liu, \\"lower wasting-thirst\\" attributed to \\"kidney-yin deficiency\\" was associated with sweet urine (glycosuria). This may indicate differentiation akin to modern-day differentiation of diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus.  Extensive development of \\"wasting-thirst\\" (265‚Äì1368)  The diagnosis and treatment of xiƒÅo kƒõ was expanded significantly through the Sui (581‚Äì618) and Tang (618‚Äì907) dynasties. Zeng Liyan (545‚Äì649) expounded on the diagnosis of modern-day diabetes mellitus through the presence of sugar in the urine (glycosuria). This characterization was echoed by other physicians in the centuries that followed. Notably, in W√†it√°i M√¨y√†o (Â§ñËá∫ÁßòË¶Å; \\"Medical Secrets of an Official\\") written in 752, Wang Tao (fl. 8th century AD) included a detailed case report of sweet urine and a summary of diabetology history before the Tang dynasty. Sun Simiao (581‚Äì682 AD) further developed approaches to treatment, prevention, regulation, nursing, and convalescence. The formulae for wasting-thirst grew from one in The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, to nine in Zhang Zhongjing's works, to 73 in Sun Simiao's. The selection of herbs grew from one (Eupatorium Fortunei), to dozens used by Zhang, to over one hundred used by Sun.  Integration of Chinese and Western medicine (1368‚Äì1949)  During the Ming (1368‚Äì1644) and Qing (1644‚Äì1912) dynasties, medical discoveries slowed but practitioners achieved significant knowledge integration across cultures. Over one hundred comprehensive medical monographs were cultivated, many synthesizing developments in the study of wasting-thirst and of diabetes. Zhang Xichun (1860‚Äì1933), a renowned integrator of medical knowledge, produced (among other works) Yƒ´xu√© zh≈çng zh≈çng cƒÅnxƒ´ l√π (ÂåªÂ≠¶Ë°∑‰∏≠ÂèÇË•øÂΩï; \\"The Integration of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine\\"). In a dedicated chapter named \\"XiƒÅo-kƒõ therapies\\", he discussed the following aspects synthesizing wasting-thirst and diabetes: nomenclature, theories (pathologies), primary formulae, medications (herbology and pharmacology), nursing (diet and maintenance), medical cases, and integrated analysis (protein and essence; qi and fluids). Yu Yunxiu (1879‚Äì1954), a Japanese-educated practitioner of Western medicine aligned with the modernizer camp of the Chinese Ministry of Health, attempted to forbid the practice of Chinese medicine in 1929. In 1939, he wrote on the rough equivalence of wasting-thirst and diabetes.  Classical antiquity  Greco- Roman accounts of what we now know as diabetes primarily describe excessive urination (polyuria). There is no known account of sweetness in early Greco- Roman concepts of the disease. Given the lasting legacy of classical medicine, these descriptions remained highly influential into the Middle Ages in Europe.  Greek writers  It is assumed that the Hippocratic Corpus bears no direct mention of what we now know as diabetes. However, a number of indirect statements referring to excessive and \\"watery urine\\" suggest that Hippocratic writers may have been familiar with the condition. The term \\"diabetes\\" is derived from the Ionic for \\"siphon\\", meaning \\"to pass or run through\\". It reflects the dominant notion at the time that fluids consumed by the diabetic patient passed through the body unchanged, as if flowing through a tube or siphon. A number of conflicting accounts exist as to the first use of this term, placing the originator as either Apollonius of Memphis (fl. 3rd century BC), Demetrius of Apamea (fl. 100 BC), or Aretaeus of Cappadocia (fl. early 2nd century AD). In-depth probes of Greek etymology agree that the term came from Demetrius of Apamea. C.L. Gemmill (1972) states: > Caelius Aurelianus prepared a Latin version of the works of Soranus. In the > index of the Drabkin edition there is a subject heading \\"Diabetes,\\" but on > examination of the text this section could not be found (footnote 3, p. 776) > except for a short paragraph. In this paragraph Caelius quotes Apollonius of > Memphis as separating two forms of dropsy, one marked by retention of fluid > and the other by the inability to retain fluid; the patient discharges > whatever he drinks as if it were passed through a pipe. Apollonius lived in > the second half of the third century B.C. Caelius Aurelianus continues by > stating that Demetrius of Apamea distinguishes this disease from dropsy in > which any fluid that is drunk is discharged as urine. Demetrius calls this > condition diabetes. The time of Demetrius of Apamea is given as the first > century B.C. None of his works have come down to us; we have only quotations > in later authors.

Engraved portrait of Aretaeus by Ioannes Sambucus (1574) In his classic description of diabetes, Aretaeus of Cappadocia (fl. early 2nd century AD) noted the excessive amount of urine that passed through the kidney. He also noted its rarity (\\"Diabetes is a wonderful affection, not very frequent among men...\\"). He described the disease as \\"a melting down of the flesh and limbs into urine\\" and attributed it to the bladder and kidneys, commenting that \\"life (with diabetes) is short, disgusting and painful.\\" Aretaeus's contemporary Galen (129-200 AD) stressed that diabetes was a disease of the kidneys and affirmed its rarity, having observed it \\"only twice\\" at the time he wrote On the affected parts. Aretaeus and the others authors under discussion did not differentiate between diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. It is assumed that they were referring to diabetes mellitus, although Swedish physician F. Henschen has suggested that Aretaeus and Galen may have instead been referring to diabetes insipidus. For all practical purposes, however, diabetes insipidus remained unrecognized well into the 17th century.  Roman writers  Aulus Cornelius Celsus (fl. 30 BC-50 AD), who interpreted Greek works in Latin, provided an early clinical description of diabetes in his eight-volume work titled De Medicina. He wrote that \\"urine exceeds in quantity the fluid taken even if it is passed painlessly.\\" This concept of an imbalance between the ingested and excreted amounts of fluid was repeated by many authors into the Middle Ages. Rufus of Ephesus (fl. 98‚Äì117 AD), a physician famous for his work on the variations of the pulse, described the symptoms of diabetes as \\"incessant thirst\\" and immediate urination after drinking, which he called \\"urinary diarrhea\\".  Byzantine writers  The Byzantine Empire was a continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire. The capital was Constantinople (modern Istanbul, former Byzantium). It was conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Physician Oribasius (c. 320‚Äì403), personal physician of the emperor and philosopher Julian, compiled all known ancient medical texts of his time by theme into medical encyclopedia. He quotes Galen and Rufus on diabetes, considering it to be a polyuric disease of the kidneys. Various descriptive names are given for the condition, including: chamber-pot dropsy, diarrhea of the urine (diarrhea urinosa), and the thirsty disease. These descriptions, along with a number of other names for the condition (\\"liuria\\", \\"extreme thirst or dipsacus\\"), were echoed by later Byzantine writers in key encyclopedic texts.  Medieval Islamic world  The Canon of Medicine by Avicenna During the Islamic Golden Age under the Abbasid Caliphate, prominent Muslim physicians preserved, systematized and developed ancient medical knowledge from across the Eurasian continent. They synthesized concepts from classical antiquity (see: Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome), Persia, Ayurveda, and China. This work laid the foundations for later advances in medieval European medicine as European physicians came into contact with Islamic authors through the Renaissance of the 12th century. Rhazes (c. 854‚Äì925), or Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi, included writings about diabetes in the more than 230 books he produced in his lifetime. Avicenna (980‚Äì1037), or Ibn Sina, was a court physician to the caliphs of Baghdad and a key figure in medicine who compiled an exhaustive medical encyclopedia titled The Canon of Medicine. His account detailed the clinical features of diabetes, and termed the disease albulab (\\"water wheel\\") and zalkh el kuliah (\\"diarrhea of the kidneys\\"). He documented \\"the abnormal appetite and the collapse of sexual functions\\" and the sweet taste of diabetic urine, and further differentiated diabetes associated with emaciation from other causes of polyuria. He also elaborated on diabetic gangrene and treated diabetes using a mixture of lupine, trigonella (fenugreek), and zedoary seed. The treatment, prescribed at the recommendation of the French director of Tunis, was reportedly effective in 5 cases. It has been noted that references to diabetes expanded in the medical texts of this period. Eknoyan and Nagy (2005) speculate that this indicates the increasing prevalence of the disease. Other interpretations are also possible, including that the increasing references are the result of more systematic knowledge sharing practices. Maimonides (c. 1135‚Äì1204), a renowned philosopher and polymath of the era in both the Jewish and Islamic worlds, claimed to have seen more than 20 cases (in contrast to Galen's two cases). Abd al-Latif al- Baghdadi (1162‚Äì1231), also a philosopher and polymath, produced a treatise dedicated to diabetes (On Diabetes, Fols. 140v-149r).  Modern Europe  Thomas Willis's Pharmaceutice rationalis (from 1679) In the 16th century, Paracelsus (1493‚Äì1541) described diabetes as a constitutional disease that \\"irritates the kidneys\\" and provokes excessive urination. He reported that evaporating urine from a diabetic patient left an excessive residue, which he called \\"salts\\". It has, however, been noted that he advised tasting the urine for sweetness in other contexts. In 1674, Thomas Willis made reference to the sweet taste of diabetic urine in Pharmaceutice rationalis. While this reiterated ancient observations from across the Eurasian continent, it is generally understood to be the first explicit reference to sugary diabetic fluids in the modern European context. However, contrary to some claims that the term mellitus was added by Thomas Willis to specify the condition by its glycosuria, the word appears nowhere in his chapter on diabetes. The verifiable statement that may be derived from relevant sources is that Willis elaborated on glycosuria but did not distinguish between different types of diabetes. Notably, Willis disagreed with the common idea that the disorder originated in the kidneys (\\"Reins\\"), suggesting instead that it was a \\"Distemper of the Blood than of the Reins [Kidneys]\\". He also noted the connection between the condition and certain dietary habits, \\"chiefly an assiduous and immoderate drinking of Cider, Beer, or sharp Wines\\". The presence of sugar in the urine (glycosuria) and in the blood (hyperglycemia) was demonstrated through the work of a number of physicians in the late 18th century, including Robert Wyatt (1774) and Matthew Dobson (1776). In 1769, William Cullen called attention to diabetic urine that was \\"insipid\\" in taste: > I myself, indeed, think I have met with one instance of diabetes in which > the urine was perfectly insipid; and it would seem that a like observation > had occurred to Dr. Martin Lister. I am persuaded, however, that such > instances are very rare; and that the other is much more common and perhaps > the almost universal occurrence. I judge therefore, that the presence of > such a saccharine matter may be considered as the principal circumstance in > idiopathic diabetes. In 1788, Thomas Cawley published a case study in the London Medical Journal based on an autopsy of a diabetic patient. He suggested a link between the pancreas and diabetes after observing stones and signs of tissue damage in the patient's pancreas. The significance of this discovery went unappreciated for another hundred years. In 1794, Johann Peter Frank of the University of Pavia found that his patients were characterized by \\"long continued abnormally increased secretion of non-saccharine urine which is not caused by a diseased condition of the kidneys\\". He introduced the term insipidus, derived from the Latin (\\"tasteless\\"). Frank is often credited as the first physician to describe clinical differences between diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. This claim, however, warrants further examination given prior instances of comparable description (e.g. those by William Cullen). It has been noted that 1792 seems to be the year when \\"unequivocal\\" diabetes insipidus was first described in the medical literature. One may observe the lingering ambiguity in the general notion of \\"diabetes\\", especially as it manifests very differently in diabetes mellitus and in diabetes insipidus. In 1843, William Prout aptly summarized the general notion of diabetes of the time as follows: > The term diabetes, implying simply an increased flow of urine, is applicable > to any disease in which that symptom is present in a remarkable degree. This > general use of the term, however, has caused a great deal of confusion; as a > variety of diseases differing altogether in their nature, except in the > accidental circumstances of being accompanied by diuresis, or a large flow > of urine, have in consequence been confounded with one another. To prevent > this confusion in future, I would recommend that the term be restricted to > those affections in which the urine is saccharine. Hence I define Diabetes > to be a disease in which a saccharine state of the urine is the > characteristic symptom.  Pathophysiology  Pathophysiology refers to the physiological processes associated with a disease or injury. In the history of medicine, diseases became better understood as human anatomy became better understood. The development of autopsy in the 15th and 16th centuries was key to this learning. As anatomists detailed the complex structures of the human body, they began to pay more attention to the pathological structures associated with diseases, their causes and effects, and mechanisms of progress. By the 18th century, many such pathologic observations were being published in textbooks and journals. This work lay important foundations for advances in medical treatment and intervention. Historically, various notions of present- day \\"diabetes\\" have described some general mix of excessive urine (polyuria), excessive thirst (polydipsia), and weight loss (see: History of diabetes#Early accounts). Over the past few centuries, these symptoms have been linked to updated understandings of how the disease works, and how it manifests differently across cases. This section outlines these developments as various diabetic conditions have become better understood.  Diabetes mellitus  Today, the term \\"diabetes\\" most commonly refers to diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is itself an umbrella term for a number of different diseases involving problems processing sugars that have been consumed (glucose metabolism). Historically, this is the \\"diabetes\\" which has been associated with sugary urine (glycosuria).  Role of the pancreas  In 1683, a surgical experiment by Johann Conrad Brunner almost led to a medical breakthrough. He excised the pancreas of a neighbour's hunting dog, causing polyuria and polydipsia. Brunner very clearly described these classic symptoms in pancreatectomized dogs, but made no association with diabetes. In 1788, Thomas Cawley published a case study in the London Medical Journal based on an autopsy of a diabetic patient. He observed stones and signs of tissue damage in the patient's pancreas, noting that the \\"right extremity of the pancreas was very hard, and appeared to be scirrhous.\\" Considering the idea that diabetes \\"be not a disease of the kidneys\\", he suggested that \\"a cure may have been effected... provided the stomach and organs subservient to digestion had retained their digestive power\\". In the decades that followed, Richard Bright (1831) and Von Recklinhausen (1864) also reported gross changes in the pancreas of diabetic patients. Claude Bernard demonstrated the function of pancreatic juice in digestion between 1849 and 1856, clarifying an important link in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Plaque in Strasbourg commemorating the 1889 discovery by Minkowski and Von Mering In 1889, Joseph von Mering and Oskar Minkowski excised the pancreas of a dog, which soon developed the symptoms of diabetes. According to some accounts, Minkowski was taught by his supervisor, Bernhard Naunyn, to test for sugar in urine whenever he noticed polyuria. According to some other accounts, a laboratory attendant pointed out that only the urine of the pancreatectomized dogs attracted flies, prompting the researchers to test for sugar. Ultimately, the pair tested for sugar in the urine and confirmed the connection with diabetes mellitus. This event is commonly credited as the formal discovery of a role for the pancreas in diabetes. While the researchers continued to work on obtaining a pancreatic extract, they were unable to obtain the presumed anti-diabetic substance. In 1893, Edouard H√©don in Montpellier conducted a pancreatectomy in two stages. In the first, he took out almost all of the pancreas, cutting off the supply of pancreatic juice entirely. He then left a small remnant of pancreas grafted under the dog's skin. The dog did not become diabetic until the remaining graft was also excised, leading H√©don to the conclusion that the pancreas must have two functions: digestion via an external secretion, and carbohydrate metabolism via some internal secretion that was released directly into the bloodstream. J.J.R. MacLeod, among the Toronto group that later isolated and purified insulin for clinical use, cited this finding as the most convincing proof of an internal secretion in his 1913 book, Diabetes: Its Pathological Physiology. Also in 1893, √âdouard Laguesse suggested that the islet cells of the pancreas, described as \\"little heaps of cells\\" by Paul Langerhans in 1869, might play a regulatory role in digestion. These cells were named Islets of Langerhans after the original discoverer. Soon after, it was established that the role of the pancreas in carbohydrate metabolism could be localized to the islets; Eugene Lindsay Opie (1901) confirmed this connection in relation to diabetes mellitus. In 1909, Belgian physician Jean de Mayer hypothesized that the islets secrete a substance that plays this metabolic role, and termed it \\"insulin\\", from the Latin insula (\\"island\\"). Sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer independently proposed the same in 1916, not knowing at the time that de Meyer had made the same suggestion a few years prior. The endocrine role of the pancreas in metabolism, and indeed the existence of insulin, was further clarified between 1921-1922 when a group of researchers in Toronto, including Frederick Grant Banting, Charles Herbert Best, J.J.R. MacLeod, and James Collip, were able to isolate and purify the extract.  Types of diabetes mellitus  Between 1850 and 1875, French researchers Apollinaire Bouchardat and E. Lancereux acknowledged a need for classification. They distinguished between those diabetics that were lean, had severe symptoms, poor outcomes, and pancreatic lesions at autopsy (diabetes maigre), and those that were overweight, presented later in life with a milder form of the disease and had a better prognosis if put on a low calorie diet (diabetes gras). These descriptions are comparable to the two types identified by Ayurvedic physicians Sushruta and Charaka (400‚Äì500 AD), with one type being associated with youth and the other with being overweight. Harold Percival Himsworth established a clearer distinction in 1936, differentiating two types of diabetes based on sensitivity to insulin (both injected and pancreatic). In 1950, R. D. Lawrence observed that some diabetics were deficient in insulin and that some were not. Philip Hugh-Jones, while working in Jamaica in 1955, clarified Lawrence‚Äôs classification and coined the terms \\"type 1\\" and \\"type 2\\" diabetes. He also noted a rarer variety observed in insulin-resistant youth (whose condition could not be placed into the two types). He called this third group \\"type J\\", where J stood for Jamaica. The terms type 1 and 2 were for some time forgotten. In 1976, they were revived and popularized by Andrew Cudworth after he discovered the link between type 1 diabetes and a specific genetic marker.  Diabetes insipidus  thumb In 1794, Johann Peter Frank gave a relatively clear description of diabetes insipidus, as a \\"long continued abnormally increased secretion of non-saccharine urine which is not caused by a diseased condition of the kidneys\\". This remained the general state of knowledge for another century. William Osler, in the first edition of his textbook (1892), summarized the pathophysiology of the condition as follows: \\"The nature of the disease is unknown. It is doubtless of nervous origin. The most reasonable view is that it results from a vasomotor disturbance of the renal vessels... giving rise to continuous renal congestion.\\" thumb In 1912, Alfred Eric Frank, then working on diabetes mellitus in the department of Oskar Minkowski in Breslau, reported a specific link to the pituitary gland upon observing a case of a man who had survived after shooting himself in the temple. Morris Simmonds drew the same connection in 1913. Thereafter, numerous reports documented cases of diabetes insipidus associated with pituitary lesions, steadily accumulating evidence favouring the hypothesized connection. George Oliver and Edward Albert Schafer were among the first researchers to document its endocrine functions. In the first two decades of the 20th century, however, a number of conflicting reports on the diuretic versus anti-diuretic properties of the pituitary extract caused confusion in the field. A general agreement was reached that some of the results that reported diuresis was due to increased pressure and blood flow to the kidney, while the posterior pituitary extract had an antidiurectic effect. By the 1920s, accumulated findings defined diabetes insipidus as a disorder of the pituitary. The main question now became whether the cause of diabetes insipidus lay in the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, given their intimate connection. In 1920, Jean Camus and Gustave Roussy summarized a number of years of research, reporting that they had produced polyuria in dogs by puncturing the hypothalamus while leaving the pituitary intact. These results were later replicated by many others. Over the next few decades, various competing hypotheses arose as to where and how the \\"posterior lobe hormones\\" were produced, transported, and stored. Finally in 1954, Berta and Ernst Scharrer concluded that the hormones were produced by the nuclei of cells in the hypothalamus.  Types of diabetes insipidus  Since about 1850 it had been known that diabetes insipidus might be a hereditary disorder. In 1945, it was noted that vasopressin had no effect on treating some patients with familial diabetes. Based on this clue, it soon came to light that there exist two types of hereditary diabetes insipidus. In 1947, the anti-diuretic hormone (ADH)-insensitive variety was termed nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), and attributed to a defect in the loop of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule. Since then, acquired forms of NDI have also been identified and associated with a broad range of causes. Gestational diabetes insipidus has also been identified as a rare variety of disease that manifests in the third trimester of pregnancy and the early postpartum period.  Treatment and Intervention   Diabetes mellitus   Dietary intervention  Remedies for diabetes before the mid-1800s often consisted of blends of ingredients, bleeding, and opium (which was still being mentioned by William Osler in 1915). Another treatment that prevailed into the 20th century was to provide the patient with extra nourishment to compensate for the loss of nutrients to urine. Patients under this regimen were advised to eat as much as possible; sometimes, to eat extra large quantities of sugar. This was misguided advice that resulted in early deaths. Meanwhile, greater success at controlling diabetes was found as physicians began to notice that fasting, not overfeeding, seemed to improve the symptoms of diabetes. Dietary restriction was reported successful by John Rollo (1706) and by Apollinaire Bouchardat, who observed the disappearance of glycosuria in his patients during the rationing while Paris was besieged by the Germans in 1870. A variety of sugar- free, low-carbohydrate diets (occasionally involving physical restraint of patients lacking self-discipline) became increasingly popular. Among others, Frederick Madison Allen's \\"starvation diet\\" was notoriously spartan, but was shown to extend life expectancy. Elizabeth Hughes Gossett, later among the first people to be treated with insulin, was among Allen's patients.  Pancreatic extracts before insulin  The limit to early diabetes control was partly due to the common-sense assumption that the stomach was wholly responsible for nutrient metabolism. As physiologists came to better understand the metabolic role of other organs, they began to hypothesize alternative causes for the disease. Through accumulating evidence, it was established that the \\"cause\\" of diabetes could be localized to the pancreas, then to its internal secretion (see: History of diabetes#Pathophysiology#Role of the pancreas). These findings fueled attempts to treat diabetes in animals and humans with direct extracts from the pancreas, by no less than 400 researchers according to historian Michael Bliss. In the early 1900s, Georg Ludwig Zuelzer experimented extensively with pancreatic extracts. After initial tests on rabbits, he injected his extracts (which he called \\"acomatol\\") on humans to clear but inconsistent success and severe side- effects. He nonetheless took out an American patent on his yet-problematic extracts. Unfortunately, Zuelzer was ultimately unable to purify the extract due to difficulty obtaining pancreases, a lack of funding, and interruption by World War I. Ernest Lyman Scott, studying at the University of Chicago between 1911‚Äì12, also obtained some promising results but was discouraged from continuing. In 1913, John James Rickard MacLeod, at the time several years into research in the area of carbohydrate metabolism and blood sugar behaviour, synthesized the state of research in Diabetes: Its Pathological Physiology. He concluded that there was an internal secretion of the pancreas, but suggested several reasons why it may never be captured in a pancreatic extract. Between 1910 and 1920, techniques for measuring blood sugar (glucose test) were rapidly improved, allowing experiments to be conducted with greater efficiency and precision. These developments also helped establish the notion that high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia), rather than glycosuria, was the important condition to be relieved. Working at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research between 1915‚Äì1919, Israel Kleiner reported convincing results on the effect of ground pancreas solutions on blood sugar levels, using rigorous experimental controls which \\"theoretically... support[ed] the internal secretion hypothesis of the origin of diabetes\\" and \\"practically... suggest[ed] a possible therapeutic application.\\" He discontinued this work upon leaving Rockefeller institute in 1919, for reasons not clearly known. Romanian scientist Nicolae Paulescu, another notable figure in the search for the anti-diabetic factor, began experimenting in 1916 using a slightly saline pancreatic solution like Kleiner's. After being interrupted by the Battle of Bucharest and the postwar turmoil, he published his first results in French in 1920 and 1921. His extracts resulted in clear reduction of blood and urinary sugar in the tested dogs, but had no immediate effect in his human patients (through rectal injection) that could not be duplicated by doses of saline alone. Paulescu took out a Romanian patent on his solution (which he called \\"pancr√©ine\\") and method of production, but during the next year, made no further progress with his work due to a lack of funding.  Insulin  In October 1920, Frederick Banting took interest in carbohydrate metabolism while preparing a talk he was to give his physiology students at Western University in London, Ontario. He encountered an article by Moses Barron which reported an autopsy of a patient whose pancreatic stone had obstructed the main pancreatic duct, but most of the islet cells had survived intact. From this encounter, Banting had the idea to: \\"Ligate pancreatic ducts of dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving Islets. Try to isolate the internal secretion of these to relieve glycosurea [sic]\\" On November 8, 1920, Banting met with J.J.R. Macleod, a senior professor of physiology at the University of Toronto, to ask if he might mount a research project on the internal secretion of the pancreas. Banting lacked experience in physiological research and had superficial knowledge of the subject. Nonetheless, Macleod took some interest and accepted Banting's request to work in his lab. On account of what may have interested Macleod, Michael Bliss considers the following: > Speculation is in order here and is permissible because we have some idea of > Macleod's knowledge of the literature. Whether he and Banting were > discussing grafting or extracting, what must have appealed to Macleod as > \\"never having been tried before\\" was the idea of somebody experimenting with > degenerated or atrophied pancreas. Now there was nothing new in the idea of > producing degeneration or atrophy of the acinar tissues by ligating the > pancreatic ducts‚Äîall sorts of researchers had done this. Their interest, > however, had been almost entirely in measuring the relative amounts of > degeneration that took place in the various components of the pancreas, > particularly the relative changes in the acinar and islet cells... Nobody > had either tried to prepare a graft or administer an extract using a fully > degenerated pancreas. And yet, theoretically, if there was an internal > secretion, and if it did come from the islets of Langerhans, and if it was > the acinar cells but not the islets that degenerated after the ducts were > ligated, and if two or three other conditions held good, then perhaps some > interesting results would follow. Even if the results were negative, it was > the kind of experiment that ought to have been tried long ago, if only for > completeness's sake. Chart for Elizabeth Hughes (1922) Banting, Macleod, and student assistant Charles Best began the first experiment on May 17, 1921. On June 14, Macleod left for Scotland and advised remotely through the summer, returning on September 21. During this time, Banting and Best obtained mixed but encouraging results. Since they began with the hypothesis (months later falsified through their own work) that it was necessary to avoid the external secretion in order to obtain the internal secretion, they first used degenerated pancreas, then used foetal pancreas obtained from slaughterhouses. Progress accelerated through December 1921 as it was clarified that pancreatic extracts could be used without removing the external (digestive) secretion. As the group prepared for clinical trials, biochemist James B. Collip joined the team at Banting's request to help purify the extract for human injection. On January 23, 1922, Leonard Thompson was successfully treated with Collip's extract at Toronto General Hospital. Six more patients were treated by February 1922 and quickly experienced an improved standard of life. Other notable early recipients of insulin included Elizabeth Hughes, Constance Collier, James D. Havens, and Ted Ryder. In April 1922, the Toronto group jointly authored a paper summarizing all work thus far, and formally proposed to name the extract \\"insulin\\". In October 1923, Banting and Macleod were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology based on a nomination by August Krogh for \\"the discovery of insulin and their exploration of its clinical and physiological characteristics\\". Banting and Macleod publicly shared the prize with Best and Collip, respectively. A diabetes clinic was established at Toronto General Hospital that summer to increase capacity for treatment by Banting and collaborating physicians. The non-commercial Connaught Laboratories collaborated with researchers to scale production. Once limits were reached, Toronto contracted with Eli Lilly and Company beginning May 1922 with some caution regarding the commercial nature of the firm (see: Insulin#History of study#Patent). = Nobel Prize Controversy = The 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology awarded to Frederick Banting and J.J.R. Macleod‚Äîpublicly shared with Charles Best and James Collip, respectively‚Å†‚Äîsparked controversy as to who was due credit \\"for the discovery of insulin\\". Early mass-reproduced accounts of the discovery often emphasized the role of Banting and Best's work, sidelining Macleod and Collip's contributions. This lopsided narrative persisted due to limited availability of documentary evidence and sustained differences in researchers' attitudes toward claiming recognition. During their lifetime, Banting (d. 1941) and Best (d. 1978) were more active‚Äîand in some ways, more obviously placed‚Äîthan Macleod (d. 1935) and Collip (d. 1965) in emphasizing their contributions to the work. However, the criteria advanced to prioritize the pair's early work alone (before the extract was purified) would itself run into challenges in the 1960s and 1970s as attention was drawn to successes in the same year (Nicolae Paulescu) or earlier (George Ludwig Zuelzer, Israel Kleiner). As tends to be true of any scientific line of inquiry, \\"the discovery of a preparation of insulin that could be used in treatment\\" was made possible through the joint effort of team members, and built on the insight of researchers who came before them. In 1954, American doctor Joseph H. Pratt, whose lifelong interest in diabetes and the pancreas went back well before the Toronto discovery, published a \\"reappraisal\\" of Macleod and Collip's contributions in refining Banting and Best's flawed experiments and crude extract. After Charles Best passed in 1978 and complete documentation (including Banting's papers and Macleod's account of events) became available through the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, historian Michael Bliss compiled a comprehensive account of the events surrounding the discovery of insulin. Notably, Bliss's account reviews the nominations and Nobel Prize committee's own investigations that culminated in the 1923 decision.  Metformin  In 1922, metformin was developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Further developments  Other notable discoveries since the early development of insulin and metformin include: * Development of the long acting insulin NPH in the 1940s by Novo Nordisk * Identification of the first of the sulfonylureas in 1942 * Reintroduction of the use of biguanides for Type 2 diabetes in the late 1950s.

The insulin was isolated from genetically altered bacteria (the bacteria contain the human gene for synthesizing synthetic human insulin), which produce large quantities of insulin. The purified insulin is distributed to pharmacies for use by diabetes patients. Initially, this development was not regarded by the medical profession as a clinically meaningful development. However, by 1996, the advent of insulin analogues which had vastly improved absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) characteristics which were clinically meaningful based on this early biotechnology development. In 2005, a new drug to treat type 2 diabetes, derived from the Gila monster was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The venom of the lizard contains exendin 4, which triggers one of the insulin-releasing pathways.  Diabetes insipidus  In 1913, researchers in Italy (A. Farini and B. Ceccaroni) and Germany (R. Von den Velden) reported the anti-diuretic effect of the substance extracted from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The hormone responsible for this effect was later isolated and named vasopressin. Even while the pathophysiology of diabetes insipidus was being further clarified, these findings made possible a relatively simple and effective treatment such that physicians could begin to control the disease. Various preparations of the extract were produced and made commercially available by the pharmaceutical industry through the 20th century. In 1928, Oliver Kamm and his colleagues posited two active principles in the pituitary extract: one with antidiuretic and pressor properties (vasopressin), and another with uterotonic properties (oxytocin). In a series of landmark achievements between 1947 and 1954 which culminated in a Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1955), Vincent du Vigneaud isolated, sequenced, and synthesized oxytocin and vasopressin. Today, synthesized and modified vasopressin is used to treat the condition.

Sherrell Evans of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said that many would go on to area public and private high schools, or attend private Japanese boarding schools in New York and Tennessee (Keio Academy of New York and Tennessee Meiji Gakuin High School).

Operations  As of 2014, the school operated a pre-school for children ages 3‚Äì4, a kindergarten, and an elementary school that ran through the 6th grade. The school accepted qualified applicants of all national origins, religions, and racial backgrounds. Around 1994 the school implemented a policy that prevented prospective applicants who are not entering at the kindergarten level from enrolling if they do not know Japanese. During that year, Nobuaki Oda, the headmaster, said that the policy was implemented because it was too difficult for the school to teach academic subjects in a language that some students could not understand. As of 1994, the annual tuition ranged from $3,100 ($ according to inflation) to $5,320 ($). The lowest cost was for kindergarten students and the highest cost was for junior high school students.Park, Andrew. \\"The ABCs of Asian schools.\\" Transpacific, Transpacific Media, Inc.. 9.4 (June 1994): p46+. Available on General OneFile, Gale Group, Document ID: GALE|A15239827 As of 2002 the annual tuition costs ranged from $5,000 ($) to $7,000 ($). As of 2014 the annual tuition costs ranged from $7,000 to $9,000, though the school did offer scholarships. As of 1990, if a student left Seigakuin Atlanta in good standing, he or she had the option of automatically enrolling in the Seigakuin University network of schools in Japan. Due to the declining birthrate in Japan and the declining enrollment in private schools, Japan Seigakuin was no longer able to financially support Seigakuin Atlanta International School. For this reason, the board made the decision to close SAINTS at the end of the first term in 2018.  Curriculum  The school used the curriculum of the Japanese Ministry of Education. As of 1990, all classes except English language classes are taught in Japanese. The textbooks originated in Japan. Unlike in Japanese schools, students at Seigakuin Atlanta studied U.S. history. In addition, they began studying English in kindergarten; in 1990 this was seven years earlier than when Japanese students had to begin studying English. From elementary school, students studied all of the core subjects in Japanese, using the same textbooks as their peers in Japan. As students got older, English-language instruction in these core subjects was added to the curriculum, such that students might study math in Japanese on Monday, then continue with math in English on Tuesday. Consequently, students are exposed to both American and Japanese history and literature. By the time they reached 6th grade, about half of their instruction time was in English, and half in Japanese. The curriclum was adjusted in 2004 as more students originated from non-Japanese backgrounds. Sherryl Lane, an English-language instructor quoted in Transpacific, stated in 1994 that \\"Our students are from families interested in their children being fluent in Japanese and English\\" and that many parents select the school because of its English language program. The curriculum also had a Christian component. In 1994, in Kindergarten students listened to Bible stories and prayed, and by the seventh grade, Seigakuin Atlanta students regularly took Bible classes. Kindergartners learned Bible verses in both languages, while elementary students attended a twenty-minute worship service each morning. The school also put on a Christmas pageant each year.  Student body  , the school had 92 students. 52 percent were are native Japanese speakers, 14 percent were native English speakers, and the remaining 34 percent came from bilingual households. In 2016 the school had about 100 students, with about 50% natively speaking Japanese and the remainder from other backgrounds. When the school was first founded in September 1990, it had 23 students, including 16 kindergarten students and 7 students in grades 1 through 4. In December 1990 the enrollment increased to 30 students. Around 1990, when the school was first established, most of the students were born in Japan. The parents typically resided in the United States for three to four year periods before taking themselves and their families back to Japan. Most of the parents worked for Japanese companies, and they wanted their children to easily adjust to the Japanese educational system upon their return to Japan. In 1992 the school had 62 students, 75% of whom were Japanese nationals who were scheduled to eventually come back to Japan. In 1994 the school had 75 students in preschool through 8th grade.Transpacific, Volume 9, Issues 1-4. AsiAm Pub., 1994. 49. Retrieved from Google Books on January 11, 2012. In 1994, the number of children who were not fully Japanese was increasing. As of that year, 20% of the students were Americans with no Japanese background and Americans who each had one parent of Japanese descent. Many parents enrolled the students in the school because they were interested in the Japanese educational style, which has a high international reputation, and/or because they wanted their children to learn about Japanese culture.

The hairy bark is an unusual feature. Taxonomy First collected near Roma in central Queensland, the stringybark she-oak was described by Ferdinand von Mueller and Frederick Manson Bailey in 1882 as Casuarina inophloia. Exactly 100 years later, Lawrie Johnson moved it to its current genus Allocasuarina in his revision of the she-oaks. Description Allocasuarina inophloia grows as a small tree with an open habit ranging from high. It is dioecious. Like all she-oaks, its foliage is composed of segmented branchlets with segments known as articles, its leaves reduced to tiny scales between them. Distribution and habitat In New South Wales it occurs in areas such as the Clarence River valley, Emmaville, Yetman, south to Waralda, while it ranges in Queensland north to Herberton. It is found in woodland on sandstone, ironstone or laterite ridges. Associated species include grasstrees (Xanthorrhoea) and eucalypts, such as drooping ironbark (Eucalyptus caleyi). Northwest of Glen Innes it is found in tall scrub on granitic soil uplands with other dominant species such as the she-oak species Allocasuarina brachystachya, wattle species Acacia williamsiana and the endangered Severn River heath-myrtle (Micromyrtus grandis) and understory shrubs such as Leucopogon neo-anglicus and fringe myrtle (Calytrix tetragona). It has been recorded as a host plant for the orange mistletoe (Dendrophthoe glabrescens). Cultivation Its shaggy bark gives the species its horticultural potential. It is frost hardy and able to tolerate poor soils.

The Behbahan Battalion was positioned near Shalamcheh, in the south of Iran, about 10 km from the port of Khorramshahr. The battalion was waiting for orders to be deployed to the front line when they were attacked. The Fadjr Battalion soldiers, numbering around 300, took refuge in an open-air shelter on the side of the road. The mustard gas bombs were dropped both on the road as well as on the sides of the road close to where the soldiers took shelter, and the resulting debris greatly affected them. Soon, a thick layer of poisonous smoke covered the whole area. Due to the high volume of mustard gas that the bombs contained, many soldiers were poisoned, some losing their lives in the few hours after the attacks. Other soldiers were evacuated to field hospitals in Ahwaz and to medical centers in Tehran. Some of those who were not initially wounded stayed behind in the contaminated area of the battlefield to help get the wounded out. From the over 300 soldiers present at the time of the attack, 90 lost their lives as a result of the chemical bombs within a few days. This is one of the highest mortality levels of mustard gas bombs known to date.Foroutan A. Medical Experiences of Iraq's Chemical Warfare. Tabib Publication. 2003. The surviving veterans have suffered from a variety of illnesses due to exposure to mustard gas, some having lost their lives in recent years due to complications. The most recent veteran to lose his life due to exposure to mustard gas at Behbahan was Enaytollah Nasseri, who died in late 2009 in a hospital in Tehran, suffering from a collapsed lung. In addition to the soldiers of the Fajr Battalion, soldiers from nearby battalions‚Äìincluding Fath Platoon‚Äìwere also affected by the use of chemical bombs.Khateri S, Wangerin R.

She physically portrayed the Emperor in the original release of The Empire Strikes Back, though her face was masked and her voice dubbed. The 2004 DVD release of the film had her replaced by the best-known portrayer of the character, Ian McDiarmid. Biography Eaton's most famous painting, \\"Taos Ceremony\\", circa 1928-1932 Eaton was born in Oakland, California and raised in the San Francisco suburb of Palo Alto, California. She attended the Katherine Delmar Burke School and graduated in 1920. She studied at The Art Institute of Boston, in Florence, Italy and in Paris. In 1925, Eaton's stepmother, Edith Cox Eaton purchased the historic Palo Alto house of Juana Briones de Miranda and it became a celebrated art colony and family home up until its destruction is 2015. Artist Lucretia Van Horn and sculptor Louise Nevelson spent significant periods of time there, as did Marjorie.The Tall Tree, Newsletter of the Palo Alto Historical Association, October 2011 issue, pg. 3, accessible online at www.pahistory.org/talltree/TT-2011-10.pdf In 1939, Marjorie designed and built her own adobe near the Briones house working closely with renowned architect Gregory Ain. Marjorie Eaton had taken painting classes with Hans Hofmann at the Art Students League of New York and afterwards shared a studio with Louise Nevelson whom she met at the League.Louise Nevelson, by Arnold B. Glimcher, Dutton, 1976, page 41Marjorie and Louise lived downstairs from Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo and the four became close friends and fellow artists. Though trained in the Stanislavsky method of acting, Marjorie Eaton's initial career choice was to work as either an architect or commercial artist. Before acting, she had joined the art colony in Taos, New Mexico from 1928 to 1932 and Mexico from 1933 to 1935, where she lived with and worked with Diego Rivera on locations in northern Mexico. She gained \\"a reputation for modernist figural work with bold lines, strong color, and Cubist influenced.\\" Her painting \\"Taos Ceremony\\" was exhibited in December 2008 as part of a retrospective exhibit \\"Colorado and the Old West\\", which showcased 19th and 20th century artworks related to Colorado and New Mexico. However, she found it impossible to make a living as a woman artist, so she gave up painting entirely and turned to acting. Eaton in Night Tide Eaton appeared both in film and on stage, performing in a number of Broadway plays. She made her (uncredited) film debut in Anna and the King of Siam in 1946. Later roles included Hester Forstye in That Forsyte Woman (1949), Madame Romanovitch in Night Tide (1961), the starring role of Hetty March in the low-budget, science fiction B movie Monstrosity (1963), Miss Persimmon in Mary Poppins (1964), and Sister Ursula in The Trouble with Angels (1966). In 1979, aged 78, Eaton filmed scenes for The Empire Strikes Back, the second Star Wars film. Eaton portrayed the role of Emperor Palpatine, under heavy makeup, with superimposed chimpanzee eyes and a voice dubbed over by Clive Revill. While Revill received on-screen credit, Eaton did not, and they were both replaced by Ian McDiarmid for the 2004 special edition. The makeup was sculpted by Phil Tippett and applied by Rick Baker‚Äîwho had used his own wife Elaine for the makeup tests. As nobody received on-screen credit for playing the emperor other than voice actor Clive Revill, the identity of the actor was initially unclear. It widely misquoted that Elaine Baker had appeared on screen while in reality she was only used for makeup tests and it is Eaton who appears in the final film. As a result, Eaton's role in the film remained largely anonymous for many years. In March 1986, she suffered a stroke. On April 21, 1986, she died at her childhood home in Palo Alto surrounded by two nieces and a nephew by marriage. After the memorial services, her cremated ashes were scattered in two places: half over the property where she grew up and half in Taos where she spent years as an artist.

Jacquelot supported Anthonie van Dale's rejection of the supernatural, as did Le Clerc, with some qualification.Israel, p. 366. Their positions, with that of Benjamin Binet, marked out the moderate rationalism of the first half of the 18th century.Israel, p. 371. On theodicy, Isaac Jacquelot agreed with Gottfried Leibniz in his Conformit√©.Jon Bartley Stewart (editor), Kierkegaard and the Renaissance and Modern Traditions Volume 1 (2009), p. 3; Google Books. On the other hand, he considered Leibniz's solution to the mind-body problem to be a less powerful variation on occasionalism.R. S. Woolhouse (ed.), Metaphysics and Philosophy of Science in the Seventeenth and eighteenth Centuries: essays in honour of Gerd Buchdahl (1988), p. 165; Google Books. The two met in Berlin in 1702. Leibniz replied with his doctrine of pre- established harmony, which Jacquelot criticised on grounds of free will in a projected appendix to the Conformit√©, the Syst√®me abr√©g√© de l'√¢me et de la libert√©. After negotiation the Syst√®me abr√©g√© appeared in a modified form.R. S. Woolhouse, Richard Francks (eds.), Leibniz's 'New System' and Associated Contemporary Texts (2006), pp. 171‚Äì3; Google Books. Jacquelot used an argument from design in his Dissertations sur l'existence de Dieu, defending divine providence and revealed religion: observation can and will support the purposive nature of the creation of animals and Man. His exposition was much read subsequently.Israel, p. 459‚Äì61. Controversies Jacquelot attacked the system of Benedict Spinoza, as did Samuel Clarke, by taking aim at what were perceived as key propositions in it.Israel, p. 81. During his time in Berlin, Jacquelot engaged in a final controversy with Pierre Bayle, who died in 1706 while the debate proceeded; he had frequently accused Bayle of declaring reason and faith incompatible by fiat.Israel, p. 338. One contentious topic was the article on Manichaeism in Bayle's Dictionary. As part of the exchanges, Jacquelot declared in favour of Remonstrant (Arminian) views.Daniel Pickering Walker, The Decline of Hell (1964), p. 186; Google Books.A New and General Biographical Dictionary vol. 7 (1762), p. 20; Google Books. Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek article, Jaquelot, Isaac.

Jonathan I. Israel has characterised the outcome of the debate between Bayle and the rationaux as a serious setback for the latter. Jacquelot and Le Clerc were criticised by Jean-Nicolas-Hubert Hayer. The weakness in their approach, from a Christian perspective, was to claim too much for reason.Jonathan I.

Attachment at critical stages As stated in Brewer v. Williams, , the right to counsel ‚Äúmeans at least that a person is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him, 'whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.'‚ÄùBrewer v. Williams, 430 U.S., 398 Brewer goes on to conclude that once adversarial proceedings have begun against a defendant, he has a right to legal representation when the government interrogates himMassiah v. United States, and that when a defendant is arrested, ‚Äúarraigned on [an arrest] warrant before a judge,‚Äù and ‚Äúcommitted by the court to confinement,‚Äù ‚Äú[t]here can be no doubt that judicial proceedings ha[ve] been initiated.‚Äù Individuals subject to grand jury proceedings do not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel because grand juries are not considered by the U.S. Supreme Court to be criminal proceedings which trigger the protections of that constitutional protection. Choice of counsel Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest,Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153 (1988). scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono or for a fee),Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1 (1983). criminal defendants have a right to be represented by counsel of their choice. The remedy for erroneous deprivation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140 (2006). Conflict free counsel Whether counsel is retained or appointed, the defendant has a right to counsel without a conflict of interest. If an actual conflict of interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal.Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776 (1987); Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335 (1980); Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475 (1978). The general rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived,See United States v. Curcio, 680 F.2d 881 (2d Cir. 1982). but some conflicts are un- waiveable.See, e.g., United States v. Schwarz, 283 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Fulton, 5 F.3d 605 (2d Cir. 1993). Appointment of counsel In Powell v. Alabama, the Supreme Court ruled that \\"in a capital case, where the defendant is unable to employ counsel, and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance, feeble mindedness, illiteracy, or the like, it is the duty of the court, whether requested or not, to assign counsel for him.\\" In Johnson v. Zerbst, the Supreme Court ruled that in all federal cases, counsel would have to be appointed for defendants who were too poor to hire their own. However, in Betts v. Brady, the Court declined to extend this requirement to the state courts under the Fourteenth Amendment unless the defendant demonstrated \\"special circumstances\\" requiring the assistance of counsel. In 1961, the Court extended the rule that applied in federal courts to state courts. It held in Hamilton v. Alabama that counsel had to be provided at no expense to defendants in capital cases when they so requested, even if there was no \\"ignorance, feeble mindedness, illiteracy, or the like.\\" Gideon v. Wainwright explicitly overruled Betts v. Brady and found that counsel must be provided to indigent defendants in all felony cases. Under Argersinger v. Hamlin, counsel must be appointed in any case resulting in a sentence of actual imprisonment. However, in Scott v. Illinois, the Court ruled that counsel did not need to be appointed if the defendant was not sentenced to any imprisonment. In the United States, while the right to counsel in trials by the federal government was recognized by the US Bill of Rights, the affirmation that this right extended to cases tried by state courts (i.e. most criminal trials, including for crimes such as murder in most cases) came much later. While some state supreme courts affirmed this right during the 19th century, it was only in the 1963 decision Gideon v. Wainwright that the Supreme Court affirmed the right for defendants to have counsel in felony trials. Ineffective assistance of counsel The constitutional right to counsel necessarily encompasses a right to effective counsel.McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14 (1970) Mere formal appointment of counsel does not satisfy Sixth Amendment's constitutional guarantees;Avery v. State of Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 446 (1940) instead, a criminal defendant is entitled to reasonably competent representation.State v. Wissing, 528 N.W.2d 561, 564 (Iowa 1995) In Strickland v. Washington (1984), the Court held that, on collateral review, a defendant may obtain relief if the defendant demonstrates both (1) that defense counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness (the \\"performance prong\\") and (2) that, but for the deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different (the \\"prejudice prong\\").Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). See also Casey Scott McKay, Constitutional Law-the Plea-Bargaining Process-Mr. Counsel, Please Bargain Effectively for Your Client's Sixth Amendment Rights, Otherwise the Trial Court Will Be Forced to Reoffer the Plea Deal and Then Exercise Discretion in Resentencing, 82 Miss. L.J. 731 (2013) . To satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland, a defendant who pleads guilty must show that, but for counsel's deficient performance, he or she would not have plead guilty.Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985). In Padilla v. Kentucky (2010), the Court held that counsel's failure to inform an alien pleading guilty of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have plead guilty but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea.Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010). See also Casey Scott McKay, Constitutional Law-the Plea-Bargaining Process-Mr. Counsel, Please Bargain Effectively for Your Client's Sixth Amendment Rights, Otherwise the Trial Court Will Be Forced to Reoffer the Plea Deal and Then Exercise Discretion in Resentencing, 82 Miss. L.J. 731 (2013) . Self- representation A criminal defendant may represent himself, unless a court deems the defendant to be incompetent to waive the right to counsel. In Faretta v. California, , the Supreme Court recognized a defendant's right to pro se representation. However, under Godinez v. Moran, , a court can require a defendant to be represented by counsel if it believes the accused less than fully competent to adequately proceed without counsel. In Martinez v. California Court of Appeals, , the Supreme Court ruled the right to pro se representation did not apply to appellate courts. In Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U.S. 164 (2008), the Court ruled that a criminal defendant could be simultaneously competent to stand trial and yet not competent to represent himself. The Court ultimately concluded that, in light of these rules, a state may require an otherwise competent criminal defendant to proceed to trial with the assistance of counsel. The standard for competency to stand trial presumes that the defendant will have a lawyer to assist him at that trial. Implicit therefore in the Dusky rule is the idea that the standard for competency to stand trial must be lower than the standard for competency to represent oneself. The right to represent oneself at trial is qualified by the trial court's interest in preserving courtroom decorum and promoting the orderly presentation of evidence, questioning of witnesses, and advancement of legal argument. For the Court, it was \\"common sense\\" that a defendant's mental illness might impair his ability to accomplish these tasks‚Äîtasks that any lawyer must if he is to press his client's case effectively. \\"A right of self- representation at trial will not affirm the dignity of a defendant who lacks the mental capacity to conduct his defense without the assistance of counsel.\\" In Bounds v. Smith, , the Supreme Court held that the constitutional right of \\"meaningful access to the courts\\" can be satisfied by counsel or access to legal materials. Bounds has been interpreted by several United States courts of appeals to mean a pro se defendant does not have a constitutional right to access a prison law library to research his defense when access to the courts has been provided through appointed counsel.2nd Circuit: Having a Lawyer Satisfies Test for Court Access, Law.com, Mark Hamblett, October 8, 2004 Similar state-law provisions In Louisiana, the state Supreme Court has discussed at what point the right to counsel attached under the state and federal constitutions in State v. Hattaway, 621 So. 2d 796 (La. 1993). In this case, the Court repeated the Brewer condition that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches after the commencement of adverse judicial criminal proceedings, and that the right exists only during pre-trial confrontations that can be considered \\"critical stages\\" during adverse judicial criminal proceedings. 621 So.2d at 801. No clear definition of a critical stage was given, but interrogation of a defendant by police officers was offered as an example of a critical stage in that case. Some states extend the right to counsel to all matters where a defendant's liberty interest is threatened. The New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously held that, regardless of whether the proceeding is labeled as civil, criminal, or administrative, if a defendant faces a loss of liberty, she or he is entitled to appointed counsel if indigent. Anne Pasqua, et al. v. Hon. Gerald J. Council, et al., 186 N.J. 127 (2006) (March 2006). Application to state offenses Until 1963, the right to counsel only applied to criminal defendants accused of federal crimes. However, in Gideon v. Wainwright, the Supreme Court held that the right to counsel also applied to state criminal defendants.

According to the myth, she was born into an affluent Padamangalam Nair tharavad by name Mangalathu at Kanjiracode in Southern Travancore (now in Tamil Nadu). Being a ravishingly beautiful courtesan she had an intimate relationship with Raman Thampi, son of King Rama Varma and rival of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma. According to the story, she was murdered by her servant and she turned into a Yakshi, (a class of mythical beings in Malayalam folklore) waylaying men with her beauty and drinking their blood.Kaimal, Kesava. 'Thekkan Thiruvithamkurile Yakshikal'. Srinidhi Publications, 2002. Mangalathu Sreedevi Sreedevi was a courtesan who had as her clients the high and the mighty. But she was infatuated with Raman who was one of her many servants. Raman, a Pondan Nair (palanquin-bearer), was a fair, tall, well-built and handsome young man. She and her brother Govindan used to ride on Raman's back to nearby places. A predatory sadist, Sreedevi enjoyed torturing Raman physically and mentally. She did everything possible to separate him from his wife. In course of time, the unmarried Govindan and Raman became bosom friends. They often shared the same room. Sreedevi was not quite comfortable with the growing fondness of her brother for her lover. But she did not act. Sreedevi hatched a plot and liquidated Raman's wife. Once Govindan was travelling on Raman's back when the former revealed the details of the plot. Days later, Raman strangled Sreedevi to death when they were sharing a bed. Govindan winked at the crime and protected his beloved friend. Sreedevi was reborn as a vengeful Yakshi to a couple at Kanjiracode. She grew into a bewitching beauty within moments of her birth. Though she seduced many men and drank their blood, her heart was set on the handsome Raman. She told him that she was willing to pardon him if he married her. Raman flatly refused. The Yakshi channelised all her energies in tormenting him. Devastated, Raman sought the assistance of Govindan, who was a great upasaka of Lord Balarama, for a compromise. He said that the Yakshi could have Raman for a year provided she conformed to three conditions. One, she must agree to be installed at a temple after one year. Two, after many years the temple will be destroyed and she must then seek refuge (saranagati) in Lord Narasimha to attain moksham. Three, she must pray for Govindan and his relationship with Raman not only in their current birth but also in their subsequent births. The Yakshi swore upon 'ponnum vilakkum' that she would abide by all the three conditions. Thus the compromise worked.Nair, Balasankaran. 'Kanjirottu Yakshi'. Sastha Books, 2001. Kanjiracottu Valiaveedu Temple A year later, the Yakshi was installed at a Temple which later came to be owned by Kanjiracottu Valiaveedu. The members of Valiaveedu started worshipping this Yakshi besides their Guardian Deities, Lord Ramanuja (Sri Krishna accompanied by Sri Rukmini) and Lord Balarama.Nair, Balasankaran. 'Kanjirottu Yakshi'. Sastha Books, 2001. Devotees used to offer Pongala to Yakshi Amma on Pooram in the month of Meenom and on the first Fridays in every Malayalam month except Meenom.Nair, Balasankaran. 'Valiaveedu Charithrathil'. Sastha Books, 1999. The Temple does not exist any more. Kanjirottu Yakshi and Sri Padmanabhaswami Temple After taking refuge in Lord Narasimha of Thekkedom, the Yakshi is now believed to be residing in Kallara B of Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple. As Princess Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi observes, \\"Disturbing her peace would be a disaster especially if her current quiet temperament reverts to the menacing nature that was once hers.\\"Bayi, Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi. 'Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple' (Third Edition). Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 2013. The enchanting and ferocious forms of this Yakshi are painted on the south-west part of Sri Padmanabha's shrine.

Vallerand served in the National Assembly of Quebec from 1985 to 1994 and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Robert Bourassa and Daniel Johnson. Early life and career Vallerand was born in Quebec City. He holds a bachelor's degree (1967) and a master's degree (1970) in economic sciences from Concordia University and lectured in economics at several Quebec universities from 1970 to 1981. He was an economic consultant at A. Vallerand et Associ√©s Inc. from 1971 to 1977 and subsequently worked for the group SNC from 1977 to 1979. Between 1979 and 1985, he was president of the Montreal Chamber of Commerce and executive vice-president and director- general of the Montreal District Chamber of Commerce. In the latter capacity, he supported Montreal's candidacy to host the United Nations's international centre for genetics and biotechnology and lobbied for improvements to the city's telecommunications sector.Wendie Kerr, \\"Ottawa backs Montreal bid,\\" Globe and Mail, 7 October 1982, B3; Carole Treiser, \\"Chambre studies telecommunications centre for Montreal,\\" Montreal Gazette, 10 June 1985, A12. Vallerand offered qualified support for the Quebec government's white paper on taxation in January 1985, describing it as a \\"step in the right direction\\" but calling for further structural changes in favour of the corporate sector. He supported the government's proposal to eliminate family allowances.Fran Halter and Jan Ravensbergen, \\"Tax plan doesn't go far enough experts say,\\" Montreal Gazette, 11 January 1985. Later in the year, he announced the Chamber of Commerce's support for a large-scale hydro-electricity scheme proposed by Robert Bourassa, then the leader of Quebec's opposition Liberal Party.\\"Chambre de commerce backing Bourassa's power-sale scheme,\\" Montreal Gazette, 22 May 1985, A5. Legislator Vallerand was a star candidate for the Quebec Liberal Party in the 1985 Quebec provincial election and was narrowly elected in the northern Montreal division of Cr√©mazie over incumbent Parti Qu√©b√©cois cabinet minister Guy Tardif.Eloise Morin, \\"Tearful supporters greet loser Tardif,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 December 1985, C5. The Liberal Party won a majority government in this election, and Vallerand was appointed to Bourassa's cabinet on December 12, 1985, as minister responsible for small and medium-sized businesses.\\"Bourassa gets down to business with new team,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 December 1985, A4. Vallerand was the first person to hold this position. ;Minister responsible for small business Shortly after his appointment, Vallerand said that his priorities would include simplifying government regulations, ensuring easier access for Quebec businesses to capital markets, and increasing aid for export ventures.Benoit Aubin, \\"Ministers get down to business by seeking new staff for offices,\\" Montreal Gazette, 17 December 1985, A6. In February 1986, he estimated that small businesses were creating two-thirds of new jobs in Quebec City and Montreal, and called for an \\"enterprise zone\\" to be created in Montreal's east end to compensate for job losses in the industrial sector.David Wimhurst, \\"Montreal's industries: Where did we go wrong?; Experts say roots of our economic woes go deep,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 February 1986, B4; David Wimhurst, \\"Special enterprise zone would create regulatory 'oasis' in city's east end,\\" Montreal Gazette, 17 February 1986, B7. The idea of an enterprise zone was strongly supported by city councillor Robert Perrault. The following month, Premier Bourassa appointed Vallerand and fellow minister Daniel Johnson to draft a plan for an industrial zone in the region.\\"East end to have special industry zone,\\" Montreal Gazette, 11 March 1986, A5. Vallerand organized a conference in Quebec City in March 1987 that was designed to improve ties between the government and Quebec's small businesses.\\"Small businesses get chance to voice concerns,\\" Montreal Gazette, 20 May 1987, H3. Later in the year, he announced that Quebec would work toward streamlining some aspects of its existing business regulations.\\"Quebec scheme to help businesses cut red tape,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 October 1987, C1. Generally, he argued for changes in Quebec's labour laws to reflect a more pro-business position.Gregor Murray, \\"Liberals still silent on labor code reform,\\" Montreal Gazette, 25 March 1986, B3. ;Minister responsible for international affairs Following a cabinet shuffle on June 23, 1988, Vallerand was appointed as minister responsible for international affairs. This was a junior portfolio; Vallerand worked under Paul Gobeil, Quebec's minister of international relations.Sarah Scott, \\"Marx dumped as justice minister in 10-member cabinet shuffle,\\" Montreal Gazette, 24 June 1988, A1. He did not serve in this position for very long. In December 1988, several anglophone members of Bourassa's cabinet resigned to protest the government's handling of Quebec's language laws. Vallerand was promoted to a full cabinet portfolio to fill one of the resulting vacancies, becoming minister of supply and services on December 21, 1988.\\"Bourassa quickly fills cabinet gaps,\\" Vancouver Sun, 21 December 1988, A7; Sarah Scott, \\"Bourassa patches cabinet; Link to commune costs Dutil his family portfolio,\\" Montreal Gazette, 22 December 1988, A3. ;Minister of Supply and Services Vallerand held the supply and services portfolio for just under one year. In August 1989, he announced that Laval, Quebec's second-largest city, would finally receive its own courthouse by May 1991.\\"Laval to get courthouse,\\" 1 August 1989, A3. He later indicated that Montreal's Velodrome would be closed due to a poor economic performance and replaced by a natural museum.Sarah Scott, \\"Velodrome to become 'living science museum',\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 August 1989, A1. Shortly before the 1989 provincial election, he announced a three million dollar initiative for a new S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec building on Montreal's South Shore.\\"SQ's $3-million South Shore post gets green light,\\" Montreal Gazette, 7 September 1989, p. I1. Vallerand was re-elected in the 1989 election. On October 11, 1989, he was reassigned as Quebec's minister of tourism. ;Minister of Tourism Vallerand served as tourism minister during the economic downturn of the early 1990s, a time when tourism revenues were further weakened by a strong Canadian dollar and strong promotional efforts from Quebec's regional competitors. He secured one of the few funding increases in Quebec's 1990 austerity budget, increasing the province's funds for tourism advertising from fourteen to twenty million dollars. In the same period, he worked with other provincial ministers to request that the Canadian government exempt tourism packages from Canada's new Goods and Services Tax (GST), a tax that Vallerand opposed in principle.Robert Winters, \\"Targeting the tourists; Quebec spends more to attract visitors and stem the growing tourism deficit,\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 May 1990, G1; Elisabeth Kalbfuss, \\"Seguin is expected to call it quits today,\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 September 1990, A7. See also Francois Shalom, \\"Weak economy expected to boost Quebec tourism,\\" Montreal Gazette, 29 June 1990, D7, which notes the ironic effect of a weak economy boosting domestic tourism by Quebec residents. In September 1990, he announced that Quebec would issue a GST rebate on lodging for tourists travelling from outside the province.Philip Authier, \\"Tourists will get refund on GST minister says,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 September 1990, A5. Vallerand and federal minister Beno√Æt Bouchard agreed on a one hundred million dollar plan to boost the tourism sector in January 1992, though revenues remained low throughout the year.\\"Quebec tourism gets $100M boost,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 31 January 1992, A8; \\"Tourism outlook bleak; Travel budgets will remain tight until recovery takes hold, board says,\\" Montreal Gazette, 29 January 1993, D3. In late 1990, Vallerand was the Quebec cabinet's primary representative in discussions to keep the financially struggling Montreal Expos baseball team in the city. He initially said that he would prefer the private sector to invest in the team without direct government support, though he added that he would not rule out the latter possibility.Ann Gibbon, \\"Quebec holds firm on Expos Sale preferred to private sector,\\" Globe and Mail, 16 August 1990, C14. Ultimately, Quebec provided an eighteen million dollar low-interest loan to prevent the Expos from moving.Elisabeth Kalbfuss and Jeff Blair, \\"[The Quebec government has approved an $18-million,...],\\" Montreal Gazette, 9 November 1990, p. 1; \\"Province agrees to throw $18-million into Expo pot,\\" Globe and Mail, 10 November 1990, A16. Vallerand ordered the indefinite closure of Olympic Stadium in September 1991, after the collapse of a concrete beam in one of the building's public spaces (the building was almost empty at the time, and no one was injured).James Mennie, Mary Lamey, and Philip Authier, \\"Stadium to stay shut indefinitely; Quebec orders series of safety measures,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 September 1991, A1. He allowed the building to re-open in December, after the government had spent twenty-five million dollars on repairs and compensation for cancelled events.Irwin Block, \\"Big Owe will cost $25 million more: Vallerand; Officials say roof, beams must be fixed to protect $2-billion investment,\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 November 1991, A3; Philip Authier, \\"Cabinet gives Big O green light to reopen; Stadium roof poses no danger this winter, engineering consultants say,\\" Montreal Gazette, 28 November 1991, A3. Vallerand was a vocal proponent of public casinos during his tenure as tourism minister, and in April 1992 he helped convince a divided cabinet to approve the Casino de Montr√©al and another casino project at the Manoir Richelieu in Pointe-au-Pic.\\"Around the Nation,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 21 May 1991, A12; Andre Picard, \\"Report says plan for casinos approved by Quebec cabinet No alcohol would be allowed, Radio-Canada indicates,\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 April 1992, A5; Elizabeth Thompson and Philip Authier, \\"City okays deal to open casino on Ile Notre Dame; Quebec to announce plan for another in Charlevoix,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 December 1992, A1; Philip Authier and Elizabeth Thompson, \\"It's Quebec's turn to roll the dice; Casino operator wants mostly bilingual staff,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 December 1992, A1; Lynn Moore, \\"Manoir Richelieu gets go-ahead for casino,\\" Montreal Gazette, 17 December 1993, A6. Vallerand supported an initiative to re-launch a train line between Hull and Wakefield in January 1990.\\"Train funding decision likely within month,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 26 January 1990, B8; Francine Dube, \\"Wakefield steam train should know fate soon,\\" Ottawa Citizen, B5. The line was officially re-launched in November of the same year.\\"Funding approved for Wakefield train,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 8 November 1990, B1. ;Minister of Revenue Vallerand supported Daniel Johnson's successful bid to succeed Robert Bourassa as premier in 1993.Philip Authier, \\"Likely leadership candidates begin fighting over campaign; Bacon says she won't enter Liberal race,\\" Montreal Gazette, 30 September 1993, A7. When Johnson became premier on January 12, 1994, he appointed Vallerand as minister of revenue. Vallerand worked with the government of Canada to reduce tobacco taxes in early 1994, in a bid to target Quebec's contraband cigarette trade.Philip Authier, \\"Quebec City MNAs upset over exclusion from Johnson cabinet,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 January 1994, A5; Andy Riga and Mike King, \\"Minister says all smuggling will end -even of chickens; Province may disband its unarmed tobacco police,\\" Montreal Gazette, 11 February 1994, A8. He also sought to reform Revenu Qu√©bec's tax collection practices, which many critics had described as abusive.Tu Thanh Ha, \\"Premier wants Revenue Quebec to clean up act; Task force to find ways to change practices and \`remove irritants' for taxpayers,\\" Montreal Gazette, 20 January 1994, A5. In mid-1994, Vallerand imposed sanctions against service stations in the Mohawk communities of Kahnawake and Kanesatake and required that they pay almost four million dollars in back taxes. The communities refused to pay the taxes, and a standoff ensued.Elizabeth Thompson and Alexander Norris, \\"Quebec wants reserve Peacekeepers to help keep gas out of Kahnawake,\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 May 1994, A6. In June 1994, a Quebec Superior Court justice ordered the government to lift the sanctions, but also ruled that the communities were required to collect sales tax from non-native customers.\\"Court orders Quebec to fuel Mohawk stations,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 18 June 1994, H3. Some commentators criticized Vallerand's actions, accusing the Johnson government of exploiting ethnic divisions to increase their popular support.See for instance Don Macpherson, \\"How the media have inflamed anti- Indian fervor,\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 March 1994, B5. Vallerand rejected this accusation, saying that he was simply trying to prevent unfair competition and recover lost revenues.Elizabeth Thompson and Alexander Norris, \\"Quebec wants reserve Peacekeepers to help keep gas out of Kahnawake,\\" Montreal Gazette, 12 May 1994, A6; Andy Riga and Philip Authier, \\"Quebec getting tough with Mohawks to win votes: Norton,\\" Montreal Gazette, 1 June 1994, A3. He was not a candidate in the 1994 general election, which the Liberals lost, and formally resigned from cabinet with the rest of the Johnson ministry on September 26, 1994. Canadian politics Unlike some of his cabinet colleagues, Vallerand supported the Liberal Party of Canada at the federal level in the 1980s. In the 1988 Canadian federal election, he endorsed Liberal Party incumbent Marcel Prud'homme's bid for re-election.Robert McKenzie, \\"Bourassa-Mulroney compact is alive and well,\\" Montreal Gazette, 10 July 1988, B1. During the constitutional debates of the early 1990s, he supported greater autonomy for Quebec within Canadian federalism.Peggy Curran and Philip Authier, \\"Cool reception for PM's pitch; Consider cost of splitting up, Mulroney urges Quebec,\\" Montreal Gazette, 14 February 1991, A1; Robert McKenzie, \\"Quebec ministers hopeful of deal,\\" Toronto Star, 6 August 1992, A11. Since 1994 In late 1994, Vallerand became president of the EDI World Institute, which specialized in electronic data interchange.\\"EDI World Institute,\\" Globe and Mail, 29 November 1994, A8. In 1997, he was commissioned by the government of Canada to lead a task force studying taxation policy for online businesses. Vallerand's report recommended that Canada provide a clear regulatory framework and not impose additional taxes on electronic commerce.Shawn McCarthy, \\"Report charts Internet tax path,\\" Globe and Mail, 1 May 1998, B21. Vallerand later served as president of the Canadian Institute of Tourism and Electronic Commerce (CITEC), though he was ousted from this position after a fractious board meeting in January 2000. Shortly thereafter, Vallerand contacted the Prime Minister's Office to report allegations that some federal funds granted to CITEC via Human Resources Development Canada had been misappropriated by two other board members; he went public with the controversy later in the same month, saying that it had not been properly addressed by the government. Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien rejected this accusation, responding that his office had informed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) \\"within minutes\\" of receiving Vallerand's information.Daniel Leblanc, \\"More grants probed in Chr√©tien's riding,\\" Globe and Mail, 28 February 2000, A1; Juliet O'Neill, \\"PMO didn't hide from funds probe: Chretien,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 29 February 2000, A7. In July 2000, following an RCMP investigation, the two board members named by Vallerand were formally charged with theft and fraud.Kevin Dougherty, \\"CITEC directors charged,\\" Montreal Gazette, 26 July 2000, A1. This controversy received additional attention in the Canadian media because CITEC's headquarters were located in Chr√©tien's riding. Vallerand was appointed as chairman of the board for Advantage Link Inc., a publicly traded computer services company, in August 2001.\\"Vallerand named: Former Quebec cabinet minister new chairman of Advantage Link,\\" Montreal Gazette, 24 August 2001, C8.

It is formally derived from imidazole through replacement of the hydrogen in position 4 by a methyl group. It is a slightly yellowish solid. 4-MeI may be formed in the browning of certain foods through the Maillard reaction between carbohydrates and amino-containing compounds. In particular, it is found in roasted foods, grilled meats, coffee and in types of caramel coloring produced with ammonia-based processes. It may arise also by fermentation. Preparation and structure 4-MeI may be prepared using the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis, by reacting methylglyoxal with ammonia and formaldehyde. It may also be prepared by the reaction of hydroxyacetone and formamide in ammonia. Small energy difference separates 4-methylimidazole from its tautomer 5-methylimidazole.G.-S. Li, M. F. Ruiz-L√≥pez, B. Maigret \\"Ab Initio Study of 4(5)-Methylimidazole in Aqueous Solution\\" J. Phys. Chem. A, 1997, vol. 101, pp 7885‚Äì7892. Safety Carcinogenicity studies Concern has arisen about the presence of 4-MeI in caramel color (which is the most-used food and beverage coloring), typically at a concentration between 50 and 700 ppm.World Health Organization (1975) Toxicological evaluation of some food colours, enzymes, flavour enhancers, thickening agents, and certain food additives. Accessed on 2011-01-11. Dark beers and common brands of cola drinks may contain more than 100 Œºg of this compound per 12-ounce serving. At very high doses (360 mg/kg of body weight), 4-MeI is a convulsant for rabbits, mice and chicks, and was the likely cause of acute intoxication observed in cattle fed with ammoniated, sugar-containing cattle feed supplements in the 1960s. However, several studies found no ill effect in rats and dogs for the concentrations found in caramel coloring. For an average weighted person (68 kg) to receive a 360 mg/kg dose from consuming dark beer or cola drinks, they would have to consume approximately 244,800 12-oz drinks. A 2007 study by the United States National Toxicology Program (NTP) examined the potential carcinogenicity of 4-MeI in mice and rats. When mice were fed average daily doses of 40, 80, or 170 mg of 4-MeI per kilogram of body weight for two years, increased rates of benign lung tumors (alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas) were seen in females at all examined doses; malignant lung tumors (alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas) were seen in males administered the highest dose; and an increased combined rate of benign and malignant tumors was seen in males at the top dose and in females at the top two doses.National Toxicology Program (2007) Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of 4-Methylimidazole (CAS No. 822-36-6) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Feed Studies) . NTP report TR-535. Accessed on 2011-01-11. When rats were fed daily doses of 30, 55, or 115 mg of 4-MeI per kg of body weight for two years, the incidence of leukemia was increased in females at the highest dose only. 4-MeI was inactive in several in vitro and in vivo tests of genotoxicity. Regulatory response The United States Food and Drug Administration has stated that it has \\"no reason to believe that there is any immediate or short term danger presented by 4-MeI at levels expected in food from the use of caramel coloring\\". The Agency describes the NTP carcinogenicity study as having been conducted at doses that \\"far exceed\\" current estimates of human exposure from the consumption of caramel coloring in foods and soft drinks. The Agency has stated that it is reviewing current exposure levels but does not recommend consumers change their diets based on concerns about 4-MeI. In response to statements by the Center for Science in the Public Interest that levels of 4-MeI in soft drinks \\"needlessly expose consumers to a chemical that causes cancer\\", an FDA spokesperson stated \\"[a] person would have to drink more than a thousand cans of soda in a day to match the doses administered in studies that showed links to cancer in rodents.\\" The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed the safety of caramel colorings in 2011 and revised the previously established Acceptable Daily Intakes for these products for reasons unrelated to 4-MeI exposure. The Administration's review concluded that there is no evidence to show that caramel colors have any adverse effect on human reproduction. The review further concluded that the highest level of 4-MeI that could result from the consumption of foods containing caramel colors are not of concern. Health Canada has stated that 4-MeI levels found in foods do not represent a risk. The Hong Kong Centre for Food Safety has stated that based on levels of 4-MeI found in soft drinks, a person would have to consume over 300 cans of soda each day to reach the doses found to cause cancer in the NFT study, after adjusting for a 100-fold uncertainty factor. In January 2011, California added 4-MeI to its list of probable carcinogens and stipulated 29 Œºg per day as the \\"No Significant Risk Level\\" intake. Studies have found levels of up to 700 Œºg per liter in cola soft drinks, up to 2000 Œºg per liter in coffee, and up to 28,000 Œºg/liter in dark beer. The non-profit Center for Science in the Public Interest has petitioned the FDA to require the removal of methylimidazole containing caramel colors from soft drinks. In March 2012, both The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo announced they had their caramel color suppliers modify their manufacturing processes to meet the new California standard; as of the announcement, the changes had already been made for beverages sold in California.

Itiber√™ was the sibling of poet and critic (literary and musical) Jo√£o Itiber√™ da Cunha and uncle of composer Bras√≠lio Itiber√™ da Cunha Luz.  Biography  Bras√≠lio Itiber√™ was born in the coastal city of Paranagu√°, the son of John Manuel da Cunha and Maria Munoz Louren√ßo da Cunha. He attended primary school in his homeland and his musical initiation was at the piano, learning at his parents' home. Already renowned as a pianist in his youth he moved to S√£o Paulo to attend the Faculty of Law at the Largo of S√£o Francisco, performing several concerts in this city. After obtaining a BA in Law he joined the diplomatic service in the diplomatic corps serving in Italy, Peru, Belgium, Paraguay and Germany. Without leaving music aside, Bras√≠lio maintained friendly relations with some of the greatest pianists of his time such as Anton Rubinstein, Sgambati and Liszt. Considered to be one of the forerunners of Brazilian nationalistic music Itiber√™ drew early inspiration from popular motifs and his work and style are distinctly Brazilian. He composed chamber and choral music and works for piano solo. His rhapsody A Sertaneja was popularized by the famous song \\"Balaio, meu bem, Balaio.\\". His best-known composition is undoubtedly \\"A Sertaneja\\", (1869). Itiber√™ was appointed ambassador to Portugal but died before assuming the role. He died in Berlin on August 11, 1913, aged 67.

He, along with his mother Helen and sister Maura Concannon, owned a 50% stake in the team from 1965 until 1991. However, Tim Mara was much more involved with the team than his mother or his sister were. Biography Tim Mara was the son of Jack Mara, one of the two owners of the Giants with his brother Wellington. His grandfather, also named Tim, was the founder of the franchise having started it in 1925. Tim's father was named co-owner with brother Wellington beginning in 1930, but once Jack died in 1965 Tim, along with mother Helen and sister Maura, took over his father's stake in the team and Tim took the active role in day-to-day operations that his father had. At the time the younger Tim Mara took over, the Giants were in a state of decline, having just come off a two-win season that followed a trip to the NFL Championship game. Tim and his uncle Wellington had a somewhat frosty relationship, mainly due to a clash in styles. Whereas Wellington Mara was more of a laid-back owner, his nephew was very outspoken and would not hold back from criticizing the team. Tim was also notorious for running the Giants in odd ways, such as changing parking arrangements one hour before a game. The personality conflict took an ugly turn by 1968. Things had come to such a head by 1979, Wellington and Tim were not speaking to each other at all. In that year, Mara upset his uncle by pushing to have former Washington Redskins coach George Allen, who Wellington Mara was not fond of, hired to replace John McVay as the Giants' coach. (Ray Perkins was eventually hired). To make matters worse, Mara and his uncle were dealing with a revolting fanbase who was tired of seeing year after year of losing teams. The Giants had tallied only two winning seasons since their last title game appearance in 1963. Both men endured criticism for what was perceived as a lack of ability to see that or more of a concern over their personal squabbles than over the football teams. The Giants had actually bottomed out a year earlier, when a sure win over the Philadelphia Eagles turned into a shocking loss when Herman Edwards recovered a fumbled handoff and took it all the way back for a touchdown. Eventually, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle stepped in to mediate the feud and convince the Maras to do something to improve the team. This was accomplished by hiring George Young, the director of personnel for the Miami Dolphins, to be the team's general manager, with full authority over football matters. Although Mara's job was made easier by this move, the feud between uncle and nephew continued to fester. However, things slowly began to improve for the Giants and by 1981, the team returned to the playoffs. In 1984, the Giants hit their stride and made the playoffs three consecutive years which culminated in a Super Bowl victory at the end of the 1986 season. Although Tim and Wellington Mara would still be at odds, the use of Young as a go-between enabled the Giants to run more effectively and for better hires to be made than had been made over the previous two decades of co-ownership. This was mentioned during the Super Bowl XXI postgame show, where CBS' Brent Musburger brought up the schism between the Maras but how things were now better in spite of it.CBS Television, \\"The Super Bowl Today\\", January 25, 1987 (This did not stop the owners from appearing separately during the program -- the initial trophy presentation was made by Commissioner Rozelle to Wellington Mara while Tim was interviewed later and was not standing on the podium until after the trophy presentation; later, when the trophy from Super Bowl XXV was presented, Tim stood on the opposite side of Wellington with Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, Musburger (who was now working for ABC), and Young in between them and was not interviewed until his uncle left the stage.) Shortly after the Giants' victory in Super Bowl XXV, in February 1991, Mara announced he was selling the 50% stake his family controlled to Bob Tisch, president of Loews Corporation and former Postmaster General of the United States, saying \\"the time was right\\" and revealing he had tried to sell his stake twice before but decided not to. He spent the next three years still continuing the feud with his uncle until former Giant and broadcaster Frank Gifford stepped in and brought the two together, where they seemed to come to more common ground. On June 1, 1995, Tim Mara died of Hodgkin's disease in Jupiter, Florida at the age of 59. He was survived by an ex-wife and his mother and sister.

Edward Davies was born in Fremantle in 1855. In 1875 his father died, and in December that year Davies married Kate Murray. In July 1876, Davies appeared in court on a charge of seduction brought against him by William Thorpe, a farmer, on behalf of his daughter Rosina. In the early 1880s Davies became a pawnbroker. At the same time, he was working to improve his social position in Fremantle: he joined local lodges, institutes and societies and was active on their committees, and in 1887 became rate collector to the Fremantle Municipal Council. He eventually resigned as rate collector in August 1888 after protesting that \\"from the very illiberal manner his demands had received in many quarters since starting in July, in consequence no doubt of the general depression, he felt that his talents were not equal to the occasion.\\" Despite this, Davies took up the position again in early 1890. With the onset of a gold rush in Western Australia 1893, Davies‚Äô property investments paid dividends and he was elected to Fremantle Municipal Council. In July 1894 he was also elected to the colony's Legislative Council, and in 1897 his profile appeared in W. B. Kimberly's History of West Australia: A narrative of her past, together with biographies of its leading men. The piece noted that ‚Äòthere is a happy disposition suggested in his face, which on personal acquaintance is established most emphatically.‚Äô Election as mayor and removal from office In April 1900, Davies was also appointed a Justice of the Peace, and on 17 April 1901, he was elected unopposed by the Council as mayor of Fremantle. He was to serve the balance of retiring mayor Edward Solomon's term, and was installed on 26 April 1901. Davies carried out his initial public duties without attracting comment, but on the night of 17 May 1901, he delivered a furious outburst to a Fremantle Municipal Council meeting. The majority of councillors held a special meeting the following Monday evening to ask for his resignation. Davies attended a football match on 25 May and exhibited ‚Äòerratic behaviour‚Äô, and then at a boxing match on 28 May he lavishly distributed money around him.The Mayor of Fremantle. Kalgoorlie Western Argus 4 June 1901: 36. See also Anon. They say. West Australian Sunday Times 26 May 1901: 1. That evening, Davies was examined by local Fremantle physicians Drs Thomas Davy and William Birmingham and certified as insane. He was removed to the nearby Grosvenor Private Hospital, and Davy told the West Australian newspaper that Davies had ‚Äòbeen afflicted with a brain disorder for some time past, and the excitement which he had experienced since he became Mayor of the Port, on April 21 [sic] last, had done him so much injury that he had become insane.‚ÄôThe Fremantle mayorship ‚Äì a startling development ‚Äì Mr Davies declared insane. West Australian 29 May 1901: 5. Davies was discharged by court order from the Grosvenor Hospital on around 8 or 9 June 1901.

West Australian Sunday Times 7 July 1901: 4. The situation was eventually resolved and Davies was replaced, but in September 1901 Dr Thomas Davy sued another local newspaper, the Daily News, for publishing a letter which suggested that he had falsely certified Davies. The newspaper admitted the libel, printed a public apology, and paid ¬£50 damages and costs. Increasing illness Davies was able to travel to England in August 1901 and stayed away for four months. When he returned at the end of 1901, he began spending most of his time indoors in a darkened room, and suffered another attack of gout. Davies‚Äô erratic behaviour also now involved his estate: he ‚Äòpurchased a lot of land ‚Ä¶ [and] raised money by selling the Terminus Hotel, and by mortgaging some other land.‚ÄôRemarkable lunacy case ‚Äì Is Mr E W Davies insane? ‚Äì second day's proceedings.

In July 1902 Davies told Dr Henry Lotz that he was actually the long-lost son of the Duke of York (who later became King George V), and in August 1902 he complained to Lotz about the influence of X-rays on his mind. Then in May 1903, Davies tried to send a long telegram to Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies in London, explaining his Royal origins and claiming the throne of England and a multi-million-pound fortune. He also called the police to investigate his neighbour Mr Allen, who he believed was trying to harm him with an X-ray machine. When the police failed to take him seriously, he accused them of being bribed and eventually ordered them off his premises while ‚Äòshouting out at the top of his voice‚Äô.Remarkable lunacy case ‚Äì Is Mr E W Davies insane? ‚Äì third day's proceedings.

The Supreme Court case over Davies‚Äô estate Davies‚Äô wife Kate went to the Supreme Court in Lunacy as plaintiff to try to protect the family's estate. The case was heard from 9 to 18 July 1903, and Davies‚Äô defence counsel E A Harney took the line that Davies had been suffering from a temporary aberration caused by alcoholism, that he was not a danger to others, and was capable of managing his affairs. However, J D Moss (representing Kate Davies) was able to show through a string of medical and other witnesses that Davies was not only insane but was unlikely to recover, was dangerous to others, and was legally incapable. The acting Master in Lunacy (Charles Allen Sherard) cleared the court on 15 July when Davies was placed on the stand for examination. Moss objected, claiming that he had a special direction that the case was to be heard in an open court, but the Master solved this neatly by adjourning the court while he examined Davies privately with the jury. Moss threatened to walk out; the Master remained unmoved, indicating that he would examine Davies and ‚Äòhad no objection to counsel being present‚Äô.A remarkable lunacy case ‚Äì is Mr E W Davies insane? ‚Äì fourth day's proceedings ‚Äì Mr Davies examined in camera.

Sherard then summed up on 18 July 1903 by instructing the jury that Davies‚Äô 1901 certification was not to be considered valid, as he was then suffering from alcoholism and was found later not to be insane. Sherard also told the jury that the case really began with Davies‚Äô behaviour after his return from England in 1901. The jury, however, were unanimous in finding Davies of unsound mind, but in deference to Sherard's instructions they gave the date of his first insanity as 14 June 1903. The foreman explained to the Master after they presented their finding that ‚Äòhe and others of the jury were among Mr Davies‚Äô old friends‚Äô, and that they were anxious that he be treated in a private hospital, not the lunatic asylum.The extraordinary lunacy case ‚Äì Mr E W Davies declared insane ‚Äì the procedure of the court.

John reigned from 1308 to 1311 as Landgrave in Lower Hesse.  Inheritance dispute  From 1292, there was an inheritance dispute in the House of Hesse, between Henry's sons from his two marriages, as his second wife demanded a share for her own children. This led to armed clashes which lasted until Henry's death. Henry the Younger, Henry's oldest son from his first marriage to Adelaide of Brunswick, had been co-ruler from 1284. At Mechtild's insistence, John was made co-ruler in 1296. Henry the Younger died in 1298 and his brother Otto I took his place. The inheritance was eventually divided after Henry died in 1308. John received Lower Hesse with the capital Kassel and the imperial fiefs. His half-brother Otto I received the Land of the Lahn, the later Upper Hesse, with the capital Marburg. Otto's part did not include imperial fiefs.  Reign  Hesse had mortgaged Gudensberg to the Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. In 1309, John conquered the city and forced Duke Albert II of Brunswick-G√∂ttingen to accept his repayment.

Background On March 18, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine reported that it had been unable to arrange a truce and recommended a temporary trusteeship for Palestine in order to restore peace. The following day, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Warren Austin announced that the United States believes that the partition of Palestine was no longer a viable option. On March 20, United States Secretary of State George Marshall confirmed the United States' view that the proposal for a temporary United Nations trusteeship for Palestine is the only idea presently being considered that will allow the United Nations to address the difficult situation in Palestine.

Biography  He was the son of Girolamo Colonna, a philologist and antique dealer who was also editor of the fragments of the Latin poet Ennius. As a youngster he became proficient in Latin and Greek before attending the University of Naples, where he graduated in law in 1589. He suffered from epilepsy, which prevented him from practicing law, so he turned to studying the ancient authors of medicine, botany and natural history. He noticed numerous errors and omissions in Dioscorides' Materia medica, but his commentary on that work is now lost. In the period between 1606 and 1616, Colonna studied fossils, finding evidence for their organic origins. The publication of his first works on botany, such as De purpura made him a celebrity among naturalists and one of the first members of the Accademia dei Lincei in Naples, which had been founded by Federico Cesi in 1612. In the following years, his academic activity at the Lincei was intense, including the writing of the Apiario and the Tesoro Messicano that the Lincei published in 1625 and 1628. Colonna became interested in the recently invented telescope and microscope, corresponding with Galileo Galilei and other Lincean academics on astronomy.Fabio Colonna ‚Äì Accademia dei Lincei In 1625 he published two drawings, Apiarium and Melissographia, regarding bees. Colonna was also interested in music, inventing a stringed, meantone temperament instrument, the pentecontachordon, having 50 strings in which the octave is divided into 31 parts and the tone into 5 parts.

He was the defensive coordinator for the California Golden Bears. He had been employed as the defensive coordinator for the North Carolina Tar Heels and the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Career Kaufman graduated from the University of Arkansas at Monticello, playing at the linebacker position for the Boll Weevils. During his playing career, he was named an All-American twice. After graduating in 1980, he served as a graduate assistant for Delta State University. In 1983, he received his first full-time coaching position as outside linebackers coach for Northwestern State. He held the position until 1987, when he was promoted to defensive coordinator in addition to his linebacker coaching duties. In 1988, Kaufman accepted a position as outside linebackers and defensive ends coach at Ole Miss. During his tenure as linebacker/defensive ends coach, the Rebels made appearances in the 1989 Liberty Bowl and the 1991 Gator Bowl. Kaufman remained at Ole Miss for several seasons, before becoming the defensive coordinator and linebacker coach for the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs for the 1992-1994 seasons. In 1995, he returned to Ole Miss as the new defensive coordinator under then first-time head coach Tommy Tuberville. Kaufman remained at the position for two years after Tuberville's departure to Auburn. From 1997 to 2000, under his tenure, Ole Miss appeared in four straight bowl games: the 1997 Motor City Bowl, the 1998 Independence Bowl, the 1999 Independence Bowl, and the 2000 Music City Bowl. Additionally, in 1999 Kaufman's defense ranked fourth nationally in rushing defense. For the 2001 and 2002 seasons, Kaufman was the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach for Arkansas Tech. He coached the 2003-04 seasons as linebackers coach for the East Carolina Pirates, and spent the 2005-07 seasons as the linebackers coach at Middle Tennessee. He then coached the 2008 season as the defensive line and special teams coach for Southern Miss, before accepting a position once again as linebackers coach for the North Carolina Tar Heels. Kaufman was promoted to defensive coordinator of the Tar Heels by interim head coach Everett Withers, filling the spot Withers had vacated upon the firing of head coach Butch Davis. In the 2009 season, Kaufman was named to the list of finalists for the Broyles Award given to the top assistant in college football. Texas Tech On January 10, 2012, Kaufman was announced as the new defensive coordinator for the Texas Tech Red Raiders and former employer Tommy Tuberville, replacing Chad Glasgow. He is the fourth defensive coordinator in four years for Texas Tech, and the first with three years or more of experience at the position since Greg McMackin in 2000. Kaufman inherited a Red Raider defense ranked 114 out of 120 in total defense, and last in the country in rushing defense. In the opening game of the 2012 season against the Northwestern State Demons, Kaufman's defense set a school record of only 84 yards allowed. After the third game versus the New Mexico Lobos, the Red Raiders were 2nd in total defense in the country. Following a bye the week of September 22, the Red Raiders rose to number 1 in total defense. The Red Raiders maintained their number 1 ranking after a Week 5 defeat of their first Big 12 conference opponent, the Iowa State Cyclones. Kaufman's defense held the Cyclones to 189 yards of total offense. Following this performance, Kaufman was named by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram as the frontrunner for the Broyles Award. After a loss at home to the 14th ranked Oklahoma Sooners and an upset victory over 5th ranked West Virginia Mountaineers, Kaufman's defense ranked 4th in total yards allowed. In the upset victory over West Virginia, the Red Raiders held Heisman Trophy-frontrunner Geno Smith to 275 yards, a passing efficiency rating of 100.71, and one touchdown pass. The win marked the most lopsided victory over a top-5 opponent in school history, and marked the debut of the Red Raiders in the BCS rankings at number 17. Kaufman was again praised for the performance of the defense, with Bruce Feldman of CBS Sports also naming him as the frontrunner for the Broyles Award. Cincinnati Following head coach Tommy Tuberville's departure to Cincinnati, Kaufman remained a member of the Texas Tech staff through the 2012 Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas. Following the game, it was announced on January 4, 2013 that Kaufman would be following Tuberville to Cincinnati to accept the defensive coordinator position.

Background Released during the same month that The Loved Ones had officially broken-up, their label W&G; Records compiled an album that consisted of previous songs from the Blueberry Hill EP (omitting 'This Is Love'), the first three singles recorded and released in 1966-67, new songs recorded in 1967 for the album and some warm-up rehearsals of rock n roll standards. Released in October 1967, it was one of the first Australian rock albums to be released in stereo and has never been out of print since its first release. Reception The album received mixed contemporary reviews criticising the production and that the selection of songs did not representing the band's sound: \\"...50 percent of it harks back to the jazz scene of the 30s, and through it runs a silver thread of genius. Pity.\\" Since its release the album has acquired a cult following. Though Allmusic gave the album a 4.5 star, writer Richie Unterberger said: \\"The rest of the material is usually less fearsome and innovative, though much of it still carries an air of subdued menace.\\".

The album appeared in this configuration on both the mono and stereo releases on W & G Records and the stereo release in 1972 on Astor Records. It was later reissued again with this original track listing as a limited Record Store Day Australia release in 2019 on pink vinyl by Universal Music Australia. However the masters used were neither the original mono or stereo ones, but the left channel only masters used for the Raven Records vinyl and CD reissues. Side A Side B CD Reissues The album was reissued in 1985 on Glenn A. Baker's label Raven Records with a different track order and bouns tracks. However, when the album was remastered only the left hand channel of the stereo master was used. This means some instruments and an intro to 'Sad Dark Eyes' (an electric piano in the right hand channel) are missing on the Raven Records release. The 1995 Karussell compact disc uses the Raven Records master as its source, meaning the true stereo or mono version of Magic Box has never been released on compact disc or reissued to vinyl since 1972.

Such a marriage may occur between biological (consanguine) relatives or between persons related by marriage (affinity). In some countries, avunculate marriages are prohibited by law, while in others marriages between such biological relatives are both legal and common, though now far less common. If the partners in an avunculate marriage are biologically related, they normally have the same genetic relationship as half-siblings, or a grandparent and grandchild‚Äîthat is they share approximately 25% of their genetic material. (They are therefore more closely related than partners in a marriage between first cousins, in which on average the members share 12.5% of inherited genetic material, but less than that of a marriage between, for instance, cousin-siblings, in which the partners share 37.5% of their inherited genetic material.)

In societies adhering to Jewish or Christian faiths, such marriages were sometimes allowed. The Talmud and Maimonides encourage marriages between uncles and nieces, though some early Jewish religious communities, such as the Sadducees, believed that such unions were prohibited by the Torah.Avunculate Marriage in the Bible Among medieval and especially early-modern Christians, a marriage between a woman and the sibling of a parent was not always interpreted as violating Leviticus 18; this was especially so among the royal houses of Europe, and in Catholic countries a papal dispensation could be obtained to allow such a marriage. Such marriages have traditionally been illegal in Islamic societies and are regarded as prohibited by Islam.Al-Quran [4:23] Avunculate marriages were prominent in the House of Habsburg. For example, Charles II of Spain was the son of an uncle and niece, Philip IV and Mariana of Austria; in turn, both of Philip's parents (and therefore both of Mariana's maternal grandparents) were the children of uncle-niece marriages, one of which also produced Mariana's paternal grandfather. As a result, instead of Charles' parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, and great- great-grandparents adding up to 30 different individuals, they numbered only 23.

His mother, Mariya Sergeyevna Kurginyan (Bekman) (1922‚Äì1989), was a senior research fellow at the Gorky Institute of World Literature, an expert on Thomas Mann and the author of several monographs. His maternal grandfather was a White officer who went over to the Red side in the Civil War; he was executed on 2 November 1938. Kurginyan graduated from the Moscow Institute of Geological Exploration with the specialty of geophysics (1972). He finished at Shchukin's Theatre School (1983), specializing in \\"directing the drama.\\" He gained his Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences, Fellow Institute of Oceanology, USSR Academy of Sciences (1974‚Äì1980). Up to 1986, he was a senior research fellow at the Laboratory of Applied Cybernetics, Moscow Institute of Geological Exploration. Soviet period Kurginyan was a member of the commission on new theatrical forms of the Theatre Union of the RSFSR and the initiator of the socio- economic experiment \\"Studio Theatre at the collective work contract.\\" In 1967, while a student, Kurginyan created his own Theatre Studio which in 1986, together with the studios of M. Rozovsky, \\"the South-West\\", \\"Man\\" and others took part in the experiment \\"Theatre in the collective work contract.\\" According to the results of the experiment Kurginyan's theatre \\"On the boards\\" got the status of a state theatre. The theatre of Sergey Kurginyan confesses Philosophy and metaphysical approach to the phenomena of our time. From the 1980s, Kurginyan in parallel to his theatre activities was engaged in the analysis of the political process. In November 1987, the executive committee of the Moscow City Council by the decision N 2622 created the \\"Experimental Creative Center\\" which was based on the theatre-studio \\"On the boards\\" and gave him the set of premises on the Vspolny Lane in Moscow. In January 1989, Kurginyan became the boss of the organization of a new type - \\"Experimental Creative Center\\", which was established by the Moscow City Authority on the base of his theater. He repeatedly went to the \\"hot spots\\" on behalf of the Central Committee (then - leadership of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR) for independent examination. After unsuccessful attempts to offer his services to the Secretary Central Committee Alexander Yakovlev (1987), chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme RSFSR Vitaly Vorotnikov and the chairman of the KGB Victor Cherbrikov (1988) Kurginyan was close to the second (later the first) Secretary of the CPSU MGK Yuri Prokofiev and was introduced into groups of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee. In September 1990, at the brainstorm in the Council of Ministers Kurginyan proposed rigid confiscatory measures and mass repressions against \\"speculators informal economy\\", calling the remark Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin \\"we already went through it in 1937\\". He supported in this period close contact with the \\"Union\\". Sergei Kurginyan (in the background) at the forum 'The Caucasus today and tomorrow: an open dialogue of young people.\\" In 1990, Kurginyan ran for the deputies of the RSFSR (on Chertanovskaya territorial district N 58, Moscow). The election program of the candidate S. Kurginyan proposed the strategy for national salvation of Russia which was developed to prevent the disintegration of the Russian economy, society and state. In response to the question of where to get the money to implement this program, a candidate's campaign materials stated that Russia annually loses huge sums of money due to unequal distribution between the constituent republics of the USSR, the unfinished objects, the Union's \\"projects of the century\\" and so on.

Since 2004 this community has associated nongovernmental status in the United Nations. In 1991, Kurginyan refused to become a counselor of Gorbachev because of differences in attitudes towards the withdrawal of the Communist Party and the country out of the impasse. Kurginyan's idea of relying on an intelligent layer (mainly scientific and technical intelligentsia) for guiding the country through the modernization was supported by Yuri Prokofiev, the secretary of the CPSU MGK. A number of houses in the center of Moscow have been granted to S. Kurginyan who united in the Experimental Creative Center a number of organizations and laboratories with the development breakthroughs. Post-Soviet period In 1993, Kurginyan became an advisor of Ruslan Khasbulatov. During events of October 1993 he was in the building of the Supreme Council. He was the developer of the script of the behavior of the opposition forces, an alternative to that which was implemented on 3 October (\\"march to the Ostankino\\"). According to him, a campaign plan to Ostankino was provocative. Several times he thwarted provocations, organized among the \\"White House's Citizens\\" (so-called \\"Sokolov's rebellion,\\" etc.), strongly objected to the incorporation in \\"White House's Citizens\\" the Barkashov's fellows and other provocative elements. He led political dialogue and the information campaign in favor of the Supreme Council. September 30 the \\"party\\" supporters of the march to the Ostankino, existing inside the building, achieved expulsion of S. Kurginyan as a dangerous enemy. The same day, S. Kurginyan addressed to all the supporters of the Supreme Council with a cautionary note of the impending provocation. The warning was passed through the channels that existed at the time: the information system \\"The Ring\\". It also appeared on the tapes of official news (full text in \\"Russia-XXI¬ª, ‚Ññ 8, 1993). In 1996 he invited the representatives of big business (among them Boris Berezovsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Fridman and others) to unite and embark on a constructive public attitude.

Donbass insurgent Pavel Gubarev whacked Kurginyan in the face, and another Donbass insurgent Alexander Borodai promised to shoot Kurginyan to death.

The origin of the name is in dispute, but probably derives from an advertisement for \\"Heinz 57\\" food products that was created on the hillside in the early 20th century. Hill 57 was home to a small and poverty-stricken community of Cree, M√©tis, and Ojibwe (also known as Chippewa) Native Americans from about the 1880s to the 1960s. Although much reduced in number, some of these landless Native Americans continue to reside on Hill 57. The extreme economic deprivation of Native Americans in the area led to the term \\"Hill 57\\" becoming a symbol and \\"a byword for urban Indian poverty\\". This community subsequently became the most widely cited example of \\"landless Indians\\" in Montana. Geology Hill 57 is a low-rise plateau located adjacent to the city limits of Great Falls, Montana, about north of 9th Avenue North/Northwest Bypass on Stuckey Road and abutting to the Valley View neighborhood. Hill 57 consists of rock belonging to the Colorado Group, a stratigraphic unit consisting largely of shale. Within this group is a subunit known as the Blackleaf Formation (or the Albian Formation), a shale with a small proportion of fine-to-medium grain sandstone. At the bottom of the Blackleaf Formation is another geologic subunit, the Flood Member, a sandstone consisting of layers (from top to bottom) of very hard calcareous sandstone, fissile sandstone with concretions of ironstone or stained limestone, and medium-hard light-colored sandstone. Flood Member rock makes up the majority of the rock beneath Hill 57. A very hard, undefined sandstone structure, described by geologists as \\"massive\\" in size, sits atop the hill. About 65,000 years ago, before the Iowa Period of the Wisconsin glaciation, the Missouri River flowed north rather than east. The river laid down a fluvial terrace consisting of quartzite gravel. A layer of this gravel, about deep, now covers the top and sides of Hill 57. About 15,000 years ago, the Laurentide Ice Sheet blocked the north-flowing Missouri River, creating Lake Great Falls. Lake silt in turn covered this gravel, creating the current topsoil of Hill 57. About 13,000 years ago, the ice sheet retreated and Lake Great Falls drained. This exposed Hill 57, which has retained this form into the current period. Hill 57 is distinguished from Mount Royal, a somewhat taller adjacent hill/plateau to the north and northwest. Name Sources vary widely as to the origin of the name \\"Hill 57\\". The most complete version of the name's original was reported by Ralph Pomnichowski in the Great Falls Tribune in 2009, who wrote that, in 1926, Heinz 57 salesman Art Hinck (or Henck) arranged rocks on the hill into the form of a gigantic \\"57\\" and then painted them white. Historian Don Peterson relates substantially the same story, although he says the advertisement was created about 1900. Historian Jeanne Eder has written that the advertisement went up during administration of President Theodore Roosevelt, which puts its creation between September 1901 and March 1909. Attorney Ellen Thompson, who has written about the landless Native Americans living at the site, also says that a Heinz 57 salesman arranged rocks on the hill in the form of a giant \\"57\\", although she does not say whether they were painted white or not. Others sources agree that the \\"57\\" was an advertisement (although they are not specific as to the form it took), while some say that it was \\"painted\\" but do not specify whether it was on the grass, on rocks, or took some other form. Historian Matthew Basso does not identify Art Hinck as the creator of the advertisement, but merely says the individual was a \\"pickle salesman\\". Sources agree that the advertisement could be seen for miles. Two alternative origins for the name \\"Hill 57\\" have also been suggested. Historian Ken Robison says that, in addition to the Heinz advertisement, Hill 57 was named for James J. Hill, chief executive officer of the Great Northern Railway and a close friend of Great Falls founder Paris Gibson. In 1969, Representative John Melcher cited \\"legend\\" that the hill's name came from the large number of \\"Heinz 57\\" cans strewn over the landscape there. As of 2009, the \\"57\\" advertisement could no longer be seen on the hill. Great Falls High School logo Since the 1920s, students from Great Falls High School have maintain a giant \\"GF\\" logo on the side of Hill 57. The logo is composed of whitewashed stones, which GFHS students regularly repaint and keep in place. Native American presence Hill 57 camp Just when the Hill 57 area was occupied by Native Americans is not clear. Some sources put the date at about 1900. A major drought which hit Montana in 1917 (and lasted until 1920) drove many landless Native Americans off the plains and into these settlements near Great Falls. Initially, landless Native Americans settled on the west bank of the Missouri River south of the Fox Farm neighborhood. But the most permanent settlements were on Hill 57, Mount Royal, along Wire Mill Road in Black Eagle (an unincorporated village on the north bank of the river where the Anaconda Copper smelter was located), near the Great Falls Meat Packing Plant (now demolished, but then located several hundred feet north of 5700 18th Avenue N.), and on the bank of the Missouri River near what is now Sacajawea Island. White residents of Great Falls derided these areas by calling them \\"moccasin flats\\". Winters at the Hill 57 camp were incredibly harsh. While many Native American families survived during the summer by picking food, clothing, and firewood out of the town garbage dump, snow and ice precluded such scavenging during the winter. Many families turned to the county government during the winter, and received minimal assistance that enabled them to survive. In 1917, at the start of World War I, Anaconda Copper began hiring large numbers of local landless Indians for work in their smelter. The Great Depression, which began in October 1929, caused copper prices to plunge and the plant closed on May 7, 1932. Angry white workers blamed the Native Americans for taking their jobs and stealing equipment from the plant, and burned the Indian camps around Great Falls to the ground. The vast majority of Native Americans then removed to Hill 57, which at that time was owned by a woman of Native American descent. By 1937, a number of Native American families had moved from Hill 57 to the unused land north of Wire Mill Road. Hill 57 was occupied by several hundred Native Americans into the 1970s. As of 2013, however, it was largely deserted. Nevertheless, the landless Native American presence remains strong in Great Falls, with about 3,000 Little Shell Chippewa living in the city. In popular culture The Native Americans of Hill 57 and their desperate poverty were the subject of The American Stranger, an hour-long NBC News special report which aired in November 1958. The broadcast harshly condemned the U.S. government's Indian termination policy, and used the Hill 57 community as an example of what the policy would entail. Historian Pamela Wilson has called the broadcast \\"the most significant interpretation of the termination crisis\\" ever to air on American television.

It is currently classified as an endangered species. Distribution It is endemic to the Atlantic Forest ecoregion of eastern Brazil, native to the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro. Most of its habitat has been erased by urbanisation and city spread. It is a component of lowland rainforest up to altitude, where it grows to be a part of the canopy. Description Chrysophyllum imperiale has large firm roundish cuneate- oblanceolate leaves, which measure long and wide. They are smooth above and finely furred on the undersurface, and have a prominent midrib. The leaf margins are serrated, which is an unusual characteristic for the subfamily to which it belongs. Taxonomy This species was first described in 1859 as Theophrastia imperialis, before being given its current name by Joseph Dalton Hooker and George Bentham. It was also classified as Martusiella imperialis by French botanist J.B. Louis Pierre in 1891. It is known locally in Brazil as Marmelleiro do matto. In 1991 it was placed in section Aneuchrysophyllum of the genus Chrysophyllum, along with C. bangweolense and C. venezuelanense. However a combined DNA and morphological study of the subfamily Chrysophylloideae found the two main genera, Chrysophyllum and Pouteria, to be highly polyphyletic, and that C. imperiale is not closely related to other members of the genus but instead the genus Elaeoluma. The study authors recommend resurrecting the binomial name Martusiella imperialis pending further resolution of relationships within the subfamily. Cultivation An imposing specimen tree in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney was planted by Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh in 1868. Seeds from this plant have been sent to Rio de Janeiro to facilitate recovery of the species there. Three specimens are growing in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne. It can be grown as a container plant.

It was discovered in 2000 near Hallaton, Leicestershire after Ken Wallace, a member of the Hallaton Fieldwork Group, found coins in the area. Further investigation by professional archaeologists from the University of Leicester Archaeological Services discovered that the site appeared to have been used as a large-scale Iron Age shrine. Nine years of conservation and restoration have been undertaken by experts from the British Museum, supported by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of ¬£650,000. The helmet is now on permanent display at the Harborough Museum in Market Harborough alongside other artefacts from the Hallaton Treasure hoard. Although it was found shattered into thousands of pieces and is now heavily corroded, the helmet still bears evidence of its original finely decorated design. It was plated with silver-gilt and decorated with images of goddesses and equestrian scenes. It would have been used by a Roman auxiliary cavalryman for displays and possibly in battle. The identity of the owner is not known but the helmet was discovered on a native British ceremonial site, buried alongside thousands of Iron Age British and Roman coins. It is possible that the helmet was owned by a Briton who fought alongside the Romans during the Roman conquest of Britain. Description and interpretation The helmet is an example of a three-piece Roman ceremonial cavalry helmet, made of sheet iron covered with silver sheet and partly decorated with gold leaf. Such helmets were worn by Roman auxiliary cavalrymen in displays known as hippika gymnasia and may also have been worn in battle, despite their relative thinness and lavish decoration. Horses and riders wore lavishly decorated clothes, armour and plumes while performing feats of horsemanship and re-enacting historical and legendary battles, such as the wars of the Greeks and Trojans. It is the only Roman helmet ever found in Britain that still has most of its silver-gilt plating attached. The helmet would originally have had two cheekpieces attached via holes in front of its ear guards. It has a prominent browguard, the shape of which is similar to that of the 3rd-century Guisborough Helmet, discovered in 1864 near Guisborough in Redcar and Cleveland. The rear of the helmet bowl descended to form a neckguard. The \\"Emperor\\" cheekpiece (no. 1), depicting a Roman emperor being crowned by Victory while trampling a barbarian under his horse's hooves As is the case with other Roman cavalry helmets, the Hallaton Helmet was very ornately decorated. The closest parallel to the Hallaton Helmet in terms of overall appearance is a helmet found in Xanten-Wardt in Germany which, like the Hallaton example, is made of silver-gilded iron with a wreath on the crown, a central figure on the browguard and a garland of flowers on the neckguard. A number of similar features have survived on the Hallaton Helmet. Its bowl is decorated with laurel wreaths while the scalloped browguard is edged with elaborate cabling. In the centre of the browguard is the (now heavily damaged) bust of a woman flanked by repouss√© lions. Her identity is unclear, but she may have been an empress or goddess. The iconography is reminiscent of depictions of Cybele, the Magna Mater or \\"Great Mother\\" whose image was used to promote the values of the Augustan period a few decades after the helmet was deposited. However, the depiction has a number of features that are more in common with funerary art. The earguards are in the shape of silver ears, and the neckguard is decorated with a scrolling leaf pattern. Six detached cheekpieces were found within the helmet bowl along with the disintegrated remains of a seventh, although only two would have been needed. Hinges were also found, as was the pin of one cheekpiece, which had been bent. It may have been forcibly removed or possibly sustained damage at a later date, perhaps from a plough. It is unclear why there were so many cheekpieces accompanying the helmet; it is possible that they may all have been used on the same helmet to customise its appearance on different occasions, or alternatively they may have been intended as spares in the event of damage. The surviving cheekpieces are very elaborate. Five of the cheekpieces show equestrian scenes; one depicts the triumph of a Roman emperor on horseback, holding his arm in the air as he is crowned with a laurel wreath by the goddess Victoria (Victory). A cowering barbarian is depicted below being trampled by the hooves of the emperor's horse. Another less well- preserved cheekpiece depicts a possibly Middle Eastern figure holding a large cornucopia, and a Roman helmet and shield below. The helmet was found along with some 5,296 Iron Age and Roman coins mostly dating to AD 20/30‚Äì50, the largest assemblage of Iron Age coins ever found in Britain. They had been buried at what appears to have been a pre-Roman shrine where large-scale animal slaughtering had taken place; nearly 7,000 bone fragments were also found at the site, 97 per cent of which were from pigs. Many appear to have been buried without the meat being eaten, suggesting that they had been used as offerings. The site is located on a hilltop which appears to have been encircled by a boundary ditch and palisade, with a possible processional way leading up to it. In Roman times it would have been located in the territory of the Corieltauvi, who inhabited an area of the East Midlands stretching from Northamptonshire to Lincolnshire. It is very unusual to find a helmet of this type on a native ceremonial site. It was probably made between 25 and 50 AD, close to the date of the conquest of Britain in 43 AD; this makes it one of the earliest Roman helmets ever found in Britain. Other British examples of later date were found in isolation away from settlements, as in the cases of the Guisborough Helmet and Crosby Garrett Helmet, or on Roman sites, as with the Newstead Helmet. Various suggestions have been put forward as to why the helmet ended up at Hallaton; it may have been owned by a Briton who served in the Roman cavalry, it may have been a diplomatic gift from the Romans or it may have been captured in war. According to Dr Jeremy Hill of the British Museum, the first explanation is the most likely: \\"Here you probably have a situation where local Britons are fighting on the Roman side.\\" The Roman cavalry at this time was mostly recruited from native allies, not Italians, suggesting that Britons fought alongside the Romans as they carried out their conquest of Britain. Discovery and restoration The Hallaton Helmet and cheekpieces on display at the Harborough Museum, Market Harborough The helmet was discovered by 71-year-old Ken Wallace, a retired teacher and amateur archaeologist. He and other members of the Hallaton Fieldwork Group had found fragments of Roman pottery on a hill near Hallaton in 2000. He visited the site with a second-hand metal detector late one afternoon and found about 200 coins, which had been buried in a series of small pits dug into the clay. He also found another artifact, which he left in the ground overnight. The following day he returned to examine his discovery and found it that it was a silver ear. He reported the find to Leicestershire's county archaeologist, who called in the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) to excavate the site. The dig took place in the spring of 2003. The helmet was too fragile to be excavated in situ so it was removed within a block of earth held together with plaster of Paris. It was taken to the British Museum in London for conservation, which took nine years of work by conservator Marilyn Hockey and her colleagues Fleur Shearman and Duygu √áamurcuoƒülu. Corrosion and the effects of time had shattered the helmet into thousands of pieces, most of which were smaller than the nail on a person's little finger. The reconstructed and conserved helmet was unveiled in January 2012. Leicester County Council was able to raise ¬£1 million to buy the entire hoard and pay for the conservation of the helmet, with the assistance of donations from the Heritage Lottery Fund (which gave a ¬£650,000 grant), the Art Fund and other trusts and charities. The helmet was valued at ¬£300,000; under the terms of the Treasure Act, Ken Wallace and the landowner were each awarded ¬£150,000. The helmet was put on permanent public display at the end of January 2012 at the Harborough Museum in Market Harborough, nine miles from the site where the hoard was found, alongside other objects found at Hallaton.

She published four volumes of poetry between 1842 and 1871. Early life Ann Hawkshaw (n√©e Jackson) was born on 14 October 1812, third child of the Reverend James Jackson, dissenting Protestant minister of the Green Hammerton Independent Chapel in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and his wife Mary (n√©e Clarke). There were fourteen children in total, with only seven surviving into early adulthood. The Clarke family had worked the land in Green Hammerton (North Yorkshire) for over three hundred years and Ann lived here until she turned fourteen when she left to board at the Moravian School in Little Gomersal, about forty miles from the family home. Family and connections During the 1820s Ann met John Hawkshaw. They were married on 20 March 1835 in Whixley, moving to Salford shortly after. Whilst in Manchester the Hawkshaws mixed socially with the Unitarian community, including John Relly Beard, William and Elizabeth Gaskell and their close friends the Dukinfield Darbishires, and Catherine Winkworth. John's election to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society in 1839 brought the Hawkshaws into contact with many of Manchester's prominent thinkers including Richard Cobden and John Dalton. Ann and John had six children: Mary Jane Jackson (1838), Ada (1840), John Clarke (1841), Henry Paul (1843), Editha (1845), and Oliver (1846). Ada died of hydrocephalus in 1845. Oliver died in 1856 having contracted typhoid fever whilst the family were holidaying in Pitlochry, Scotland. In 1850 John Hawkshaw set up as a consulting engineer in Great George Street, Westminster, and the family moved to London. From the early 1850s the Hawkshaws employed a governess, Mary Pugh, who was later employed by Charles Darwin at Down House. On 24 June 1862 the eldest of Hawkshaws' children, Mary, married Godfrey Wedgwood, with her brother John Clarke marrying Godfrey's sister Cecily in 1865. Mary and Godfrey's first child, Cecil Wedgwood, was born on 28 March 1863 and fifteen days later Mary died from puerperal mania. Three of the Hawkshaws' six children had now died. In 1865 the Hawkshaws purchased the four thousand acre Hollycombe estate near Liphook, Hampshire and spent their time between here and London. Visitors to their country home included Charles and Emma Darwin, Joseph Dalton Hooker, Henry James, Anne Thackeray and Alfred Tennyson. The Hawkshaws built a school at nearby Wardley Green in memory of their three dead children and commissioned a stained-glass window depicting a mother and three children with the motif '‚ÄòFides, Spes et Caritas'‚Äô (Faith, Hope and Charity). The window has since been replaced with a commemorative stone 'To the Memory of Ada, Oliver and Mary'. Writing career Hawkshaw's first volume of poetry 'Dionysius the Areopagite' with other poems was published in London and Manchester in November 1842. The collection of twenty- two poems includes the long narrative title poem which retells the biblical story of Dionysius the Areopagite, an elected member of the Areopagus in Athens who is briefly mentioned in the New Testament (). Hawkshaw's poem offers an imaginative reconstruction of Dionysius's personal journey towards Christianity and his decision to choose Christian faith over romantic love. The collection was favourably received by Manchester's poetic community, most notably by Samuel Bamford who mentions Hawkshaw's work in the preface to his Poems in 1843.Samuel Bamford, preface to Poems (Manchester: published by the author, 1843). In January 1844 John Hawkshaw forwarded a copy of the volume to Thomas Carlyle who in turn forwarded the book to his mother for her perusal.From The Carlyle Letters Online, TC TO MARGARET A. CARLYLE ; 24 January 1844; ; CL 17: 248‚Äì249. Two of the collections short lyric poems 'Why am I a Slave?' and 'The Mother to her Starving Child' are included in Nineteenth-Century Women Poets: An Oxford Anthology (1996).Nineteenth-Century Women Poets: an Oxford Anthology, ed. by Isobel Armstrong, Joseph Bristow, and Cath Sharrock (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996), pp.346‚Äì8. Poems for My Children was published in London and Manchester in July 1847. Six of the collection‚Äôs twenty-seven poems are addressed to the Hawkshaw children ‚Äì including Ada, who had died in 1845. Several of the poems in the collection celebrate nature, whilst others are set firmly in Manchester‚Äôs urban landscape. The series of five poems in the collection retelling aspects of British history anticipate Hawkshaw‚Äôs ambitious retelling of Anglo-Saxon history which was published seven years later. Sonnets on Anglo-Saxon History was published in London by John Chapman in November 1854. The sequence of one hundred sonnets retells the history of Britain up to the Norman Conquest with each sonnet faced on the page by a short prose extract. The extracts include quotations from the work of prominent contemporary Anglo-Saxon historians, such as Sharon Turner (The History of the Anglo-Saxons from the Earliest Period to the Norman Conquest (1799‚Äì1805)), Francis Palgrave (History of the Anglo-Saxons (1831)) and J.M. Kemble (The Saxons in England (1849)), and from translations of The Anglo- Saxon Chronicle and Bede's Ecclesiastical History. In her sonnet response Hawkshaw interacts with the historians and presents alternative perspectives on aspects of Anglo-Saxon history, challenging the traditions of historiography by noting its limitations and filling in the gaps. Hawkshaw's final collection, Cecil's Own Book, was published for private circulation in 1871. The collection of three short stories and ten poems was written to amuse her young grandson Cecil Wedgwood, the surviving son of Ann's daughter Mary who had died shortly after childbirth in 1863. The collection is dedicated to her memory. Of particular note is the collection's final poem, 'In Memoriam', a touching elegy on childhood death which traces the loss of the Hawkshaws' three children. Several twentieth-century anthologies of children's poetry connect Hawkshaw with the pseudonym 'Aunt Effie', author of Aunt Effie's Rhymes for Little Children (1852) and Aunt Effie's Gift to the Nursery (1854). These collections were written by Jane Euphemia Saxby (n√©e Browne), who also wrote a volume of sacred poetry, The Dove on the Cross (1849). Death Hawkshaw died on 29 April 1885 at her London home at the age of seventy-two. The cause of death was a stroke. The Manchester Guardian published an obituary on 1 May 1885.Manchester Guardian, 1 May 1885, p.8. The now Lady Hawkshaw was buried at St Mary-the-Virgin Church, Bramshott, a few miles from the family estate of Hollycombe. Sir John Hawkshaw commissioned a stained glass window set in the nave of Bramshott church to commemorate the life of his wife.

The line was originally built as a narrow-gauge line between Alamosa, Colorado, and Durango, Colorado. Portions of the route survive to this day: the now standard-gauged segment from Alamosa to Antonito, Colorado, and a narrow-gauge portion from Antonito to Chama, New Mexico. History The 200 mile rail line was built in the early 1880s to access the various mineral resources in south- western Colorado. In 1881, the line reached Durango and a short time later, a branch was built up the Animas river valley to the mining town of Silverton. In addition to the ore traffic, lumber and various agricultural commodities were also hauled along the route.  The 20th century  When the D&RGW; began the process of converting most of their mainlines to standard gauge in the early 1900s, the railroad had also planned to convert the San Juan extension. As a result, the section from Alamosa to Antonito was converted to dual gauge in 1901 with the addition of a standard gauge only branch from Durango south to Farmington, New Mexico a few years later. The D&RGW; had also considered building a tunnel under Cumbres Pass which would have alleviated the steep 4% grade over the pass. However, with the decline in ore traffic during the early 20th century, the railroad scrapped these plans and the Farmington branch was converted to narrow-gauge in 1923. After World War II, many of the surrounding Narrow gauge lines closed due to lack of Traffic. However the San Juan Extension experienced an unexpected \\"boom\\" in freight traffic due to growth in the oil industry around Farmington. This increase provided the necessary revenue to keep the line operating into the 1960s.  Abandonment and preservation  By the mid-1960s, traffic had once again dwindled and in 1968, the D&RGW; sought to abandon the entire route. As the D&RGW; never introduced mainline diesel traction on their narrow-gauge lines, the Alamosa‚ÄìDurango line eventually became of the last locations in the United States where steam locomotives were still in regular use. This brought recognition that all, if not, some portion of the line should be preserved as a museum or heritage railway. In 1970, a 64-mile segment between Antonito and Chama was purchased by the states of Colorado and New Mexico, and subsequently began operating excursion trains under the name of Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. Meanwhile, the rest of the route from Chama to Durango, including the Farmington branch, was abandoned and the dual-gauge Alamosa‚ÄìAntonito section was converted to a traditional 2-rail standard-gauge line, becoming the last 3-rail portion of the D&RGW; system to be eliminated.  The San Juan extension today  Portions of the Alamosa‚ÄìDurango line survive to this day. The now standard-gauged section from Alamosa to Antonito remained under ownership by the D&RGW; and its successor railroads until the line was sold to RailAmerica in 2003. Today, the line is part of the San Luis and Rio Grande Railroad, a class III railroad which also operates a seasonal excursion service. The narrow-gauge portion between Antontio and Chama continues to operate as the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad with two trains (one in each direction) traversing the route each day during summer months. At the ghost town of Pagosa Junction, also known as Gato, a small portion of narrow-gauge track along with a steel truss bridge are still in place.  Tracks Across Borders  Since the mid-2010s, the area along the now abandoned narrow-gauge portion between Chama and Durango has been in the process of being promoted as a scenic byway known as Tracks Across Borders. The byway, approved on April 16, 2015, follows a series of US, State, and County highways through the communities in Colorado and New Mexico that the railroad once served.  Operations  During the early years, freight trains over the Alamosa‚ÄìDurango line were handled by the D&RGW;'s fleet of 2-8-0 steam locomotives while passenger services were worked by the railroad's 4-4-0 and 4-6-0 locomotives. In later years, these were gradually superseded when more powerful 2-8-2 type engines were introduced.  Cumbres turn  Because of the 4% grade on the west side of Cumbres Pass, most eastbound freight trains performed what was known as the \\"Cumbres turn\\". After arriving at Chama, a train would be broken up and hauled in sections up to Cumbres where it was then reassembled before continuing its journey. On other portions of the route, freights were operated either by double heading or with a helper engine (US) or bank engine (Brit).  Branch lines  The Alamosa‚ÄìDurango line was host to several branch lines which diverted from various points along the route to connect nearby towns and industries. Among these were:  Silverton branch  Opened in 1882, the 45-mile route from Durango to Silverton was built by the D&RGW; to serve the mining industries in the San Juans. Almost abandoned in the 1960s, the branch was retained by the D&RGW; to serve the tourist industry and the railroad operated a seasonal passenger service during summer months. In 1981, the route was sold to Charles E. Bradshaw Jr. who then operated the branch as the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad. The line is currently owned by American Heritage Railways.  Santa Fe branch  The Santa Fe branch, also known as the Chili line or Espa√±ola branch, ran southwards for 125 miles from Antonito to Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was built by the D&RGW; during the 1880s as part of a planned rail link with El Paso, Texas. However, construction didn't go beyond Espa√±ola due to a dispute with the nearby Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. In 1887, the last 35 miles from Espa√±ola to Santa Fe was opened by the Texas, Santa Fe & Northern Railroad, a subsidiary of the D&RGW.; The entire route was closed in 1941 and subsequently abandoned.  Farmington branch  When completed in 1905, the 47 mile Farmington branch was unusual in that it was built as a standard gauge line which resulted in Durango having dual gauge facilities. It was converted to 3 ft gauge in the 1920s after plans to standard gauge the Alamosa‚ÄìDurango line fell through. This branch lasted until the late 1960s when the D&RGW; ended its narrow gauge freight operations from Alamosa to Durango.  Pagosa branch  This branch was constructed in the late 1890s to serve the logging industry around Pagosa Springs.
