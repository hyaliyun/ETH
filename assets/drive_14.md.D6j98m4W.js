Bates was born in Kansas City, Missouri on February 23, 1902, the son of W. Scott and Emyle Louise (Carlat) Bates. He graduated from Westport High School in Kansas City in 1919. While in high school he attended Culver Summer Naval School (Culver, Indiana), in 1917 and 1918. He earned both an A.B. (1923) and an A.M. (1924) from the University of Missouri and then a master in business administration (M.B.A.) from the Harvard Business School in 1925. Career Bates joined his father's lumber yard business, W. S. Bates & Son, in 1923 and remained a partner until 1940. The yard was in Nevada, Missouri. He started his career at the Harvard Business School as an Assistant Dean in 1925. Over the course of his forty- year career as a faculty member, he became the Williston Professor of Investment Management at the Harvard Business School. He authored two books and many academic articles. He was also the editor of the Harvard Business Review and the Harvard Business School Alumni Bulletin. He became professor emeritus in 1965.

He was also a member of the New England Committee for the Quartermaster Corps for testing cold weather and mountaineering equipment (1942–44). In Investment Management: A Casebook, Bates presents many business cases of investment management. Reviewing it for The Journal of Finance, University of Washington professor Fred J. Mueller suggested the cases were outdated. Meanwhile, French industrial economist Jacques Houssiaux said in Revue économique that the cases could not be applied to the French context, though he hoped the book would inspire French investment managers. Bates was an advisor to the Institute of Business Administration at Istanbul University in Turkey (1959–60, 1962–65), and to the government of Tunisia (1967). He participated in the Expedition for the Archaeological Exploration of Sardis with faculty from Harvard and Cornell University (1967–71).

They resided first in Lexington and then in Concord, Massachusetts. Dorothea died in 1943. In 1949, Bates married Louise MacMillan in Boston. They lived in Gloucester, Massachusetts for a while and then on Beacon Street in Boston's Back Bay. On his retirement in 1965, they moved to Camden, Maine. Bates served on several board and committees in Concord including the Planning Board and the Library Committee.

Reid and his sister and two brothers arrived in Queensland with their parents aboard the barque Rockhampton in October 1863, his parents settling in Bowen, where his father was appointed their first Presbyterian minister, and the first minister of religion to settle in the town. He died of dysentery just three years later. Rev. James Reid and Eliza Reid's children were:It is likely their first child, name not known, died in infancy. This would account for J. S.

According to Uber, Greyball can \\"hide the standard city app view for individual riders, enabling Uber to show that same rider a different version.\\" Uber claimed that it used Greyball to deny service to individuals suspected of violating the company's terms of services, such as people seeking to harm Uber drivers, disrupt Uber operations, or carry out law enforcement actions against Uber drivers. However, after The New York Times revealed Greyball's existence in March 2017, Uber said it would stop using it to evade local government regulators. According to the New York Times report, which was based on interviews of four current and former Uber employees and a review of internal Uber documents, Greyball used several methods to identify and deny service to government officials who were investigating Uber for violations of local laws, especially when Uber moved into a new city. Those methods included: * Geofencing. Uber would create a digital map that identified the locations of city government offices. If a potential rider attempted to hail a ride from the area around a government building, Greyball would flag the individual as a possible law enforcement agent. * Mining credit card databases. If Uber identified a credit card as being associated with a government agency or police union, it would flag that individual in Greyball. * Identifying devices. Since government agencies would often buy cheap cellphones for use in sting operations, Uber employees would visit electronics stores to obtain device numbers for inexpensive phones and input those device numbers into Greyball. * Searches of social media. Uber employees searched social media profiles to identify possible law enforcement agents. Uber then flagged those individuals in Greyball. * Eyeballing. Greyball would determine if a potential rider had been opening and closing the Uber app numerous times without calling for a ride. This was especially used in conjunction with Geofencing to detect official monitoring. U.S. Department of Justice investigation In May 2017, several news organizations reported that the United States Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation into Uber's use of Greyball to avoid local law enforcement operations. The Department of Justice initially focused on Portland, but the inquiry was expanded to include Philadelphia. City of Portland investigation On March 6, 2017, the City of Portland, Oregon announced an investigation into whether Uber had used Greyball to obstruct the enforcement of city regulations. The investigation by the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) found that: Following the release of the audit, Portland's commissioner of police suggested that the city subpoena Uber in order to force the company to turn over information on how Uber used software to evade regulatory officials. Transport for London ruling Transport for London cited the use of Greyball in London as one of the reasons for its decision not to renew Uber's private hire operator licence in September 2017. The decision stated that the way in which Uber used Greyball contributed to it failing to meet the standards of a \\"fit and proper\\" private hire operator. Consequently, Uber would not be able to operate legally in London after its licence expired on 30 September 2017 unless they entered an appeal within 21 days. Uber's appeal against the ban was heard at Westminster magistrates' court on 25 June 2018. In December 2018, Uber lost an appeal of the case at the Court of Appeal, but was granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, it continued to operate in London.

She was one of the first British journalists to court-report via Twitter, covering the 2012 obscenity trial, R v Peacock. Early life and education Hodgson was born and grew up in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. She was educated at the independent Wakefield Girls' High School. She graduated from the University of York with a first class honours degree in English and Related Literature in 2006. Hodgson then undertook a National Council for the Training of Journalists diploma in magazine journalism at Harlow College in Essex. Journalism career Following internships at the BBC, New Statesman, and the Erotic Review, Hodgson worked in legal journalism at The Law Society, before moving to Standpoint magazine as production editor and contributing writer. While working in the unpaid internships in London, she worked as a part-time dominatrix. During this time she began to freelance for the Guardian, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio 2 and Sky News, commenting on gender, civil liberties and technology issues. In 2012, she reported on rival Tokyo Pride celebrations in Japan for the New Statesman, Guardian and BBC Radio. She left Standpoint to go freelance soon after. She wrote the 'Sexual Adventurer' column for Men's Health' which ran until 2016. Hodgson has written about sexuality and society from a psychological and investigative perspective, covering everything from the science of BDSM, to dating apps that run criminal record checks. She once openly criticised a Tory MP who once euphemistically invited her to \\"tea\\", before telling her he couldn't take her to the Buckingham Palace Garden Party because of her sex-positive journalism. In 2017, a video of Hodgson debating Men's Rights Activist Mike Buchanan on Kay Burley's Sky News show went viral when Buchanan failed to respond to her statistical evidence of discrimination against women. Buchanan conceded that one path to equality would be for men to do women's housework. Hodgson is a regular commentator on Sky News and frequently dissects the papers on the Sky Sunrise Paper Review, where she is paired with the Telegraph's Brexit editor Asa Bennett (Hodgson is a vocal Remainer). She is also a regular guest on BBC3, BBC World News, BBC Radio 2 and 4, and Eamonn Holmes' TalkRadio show. Her documentary, 'Can Porn Be Ethical?' was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2015, and she was a guest in an episode of Late Night Woman's Hour alongside Caitlin Moran in 2016. Her most recent radio documentary, 'Being Bisexual', was broadcast in July 2017 on the BBC World Service, for which she was short- listed for the DIVA Journalist of the Year 2018 award. In May 2018 she appeared on The Big Questions calling for a reinvention of sex robots, the use of tech to heal PTSD and trauma, and the potential care of elderly people with AI and robotic assistance. Hodgson currently writes for the Times business insert Raconteur on health and technology issues. Most recently she has contributed to ex-Head of BBC News James Harding's new launch, Tortoise Media. Topics covered include the future of contraception and the abuse facing LGBT+ people on dating apps. In July 2019 she appeared as a dating expert in episode two of Romesh Ranganathan's BBC One Show, The Ranganation. Literary career Her first book, Bound To You, a BDSM memoir, was published by Hodder & Stoughton in 2012, which she wrote in just six weeks. Her second book, The Curious History of Dating, was published by Little, Brown in January 2017. Spanning a three-hundred-year period, the book looks at the history of courtship and marriage from a feminist perspective, and includes the history of LGBT and mixed race relationships. A review in the Law Gazette described it as a 'pacey, intelligent and authoritative account with bags of wit'.  Personal life  She is bisexual.

Munich was, and is, a significant German city, as much culturally as well as industrially. Augsburg, twenty miles to the west, was a main centre of diesel engine production (and still is today). Although some considerable distance from the United Kingdom, Munich is not a difficult city to find from the air, mainly due to its size, and possibly its proximity to the Austrian Alps to the south- east as a visual reference point. Munich was protected (initially) by its distance from the United Kingdom. There were seventy-four air raids on Munich, with 6,632 people killed and 15,800 wounded. Around 90% of the Altstadt was severely damaged due to the policy of carpet bombing (Flächenbombardement). At the start of the Großdeutsches Reich in 1939, Munich had a population of around 830,000, and was the fourth-largest city in Germany. Air force units involved Munich was bombed by RAF Bomber Command and the USAAF. 24–25 April 1944 attack =USAAF= During the day of 24 April 1944 the city and the surrounding area was heavily attacked by the USAAF.Battle over Munich Over seven hundred bomber aircraft took part in the attack, and the bombers were escorted by P-51B, P-38J, and P-47D aircraft, with around eight hundred fighter aircraft. The Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber aircraft came from the 8th and 9th Air Forces. The attack was intended to limit production of the Dornier Do 335 at Dornier Flugzeugwerke, Oberpfaffenhofen and turbine blades for the Junkers Jumo 004 axial-flow turbojet. Oberpfaffenhofen is now the home of the mission control center Deutsches Raumfahrt-Kontrollzentrum of the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V. (German Aerospace Centre). =RAF= On the night of 24/25 April 1944, 234 Lancasters and 16 Mosquito aircraft from the RAF attacked Munich. It was a devastating and concentrated attack, and around 80% of the buildings in the target area were destroyed.April 1944 attack The attack was noted for a new method of target marking at low level from 700 feet. Karlsruhe, further to the north-west, was also heavily bombed by the RAF that night. Nine Lancaster aircraft were lost in the raid. Damage The city received around 450 large bombs (Luftminen, around 4,000lb), 61,000 high- explosive bombs, and around 3,316,000 4lb magnesium incendiary bombs (Stabbrandbombe, developed by ICI). Around 50% of all of Munich was damaged. 81,500 houses were completely or partially destroyed, de-housing around 300,000 inhabitants.

It was founded in 1850 as a coeducational school, first chartered in 1852, and later in the same decade became a Methodist institution and was rechartered as a women's college. It was closed in 1912; the building became a public school. The site is now occupied by a replacement school building that preserves the college bell. History The college was founded in 1850 with five teachers and 100 studentsMacum Phelan, A History of Early Methodism in Texas, 1817–1866, Nashville, Tennessee: Richmond Cokesbury, 1924, , p. 331 (online at Archive.org). as Chappell Hill Institute, a boarding school; the land was donated by Jacob and Mary Haller. It was chartered by the Texas Legislature on February 9, 1852 as Chappell Hill Male and Female Institute. A second building was added that year to separate the sexes. In fall 1852 it became Chappell Hill College and P. S. Ruter, who had taught at Transylvania University, became president. His sister Charlotte was head of the music department, and Elizabeth Knox headed the female division.Phelan, p. 358.Carole E. Christian, \\"Chappell Hill Female College\\", Handbook of Texas online, June 12, 2010, retrieved March 4, 2017. Tuition for a session of five months was advertised as ranging from $8 for \\"reading and spelling\\" to $20 for \\"Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Astronomy, Physiology, Algebra, Geometry, Latin, Greek, or the higher branches of Mathematics\\" and $25 for music or piano \\"with use of instrument\\". In 1854 the college had 100 students, and was acquired by the Methodist Church as a replacement for Rutersville College. The male division became Soule University,Phelan, p. 404. and the female division was rechartered on August 29, 1856, as Chappell Hill Female College. Fires required replacing the building at least once, and the college was badly affected by the Civil War and by yellow fever epidemics, but it had paid off its debts by 1873. In 1878 the president was Epaminondas Dunn Pitts.\\"Chappell Hill Female College\\", Cyclopædia of Methodism, ed. Matthew Simpson, Philadelphia: Everts & Stewart, 1878, , p. 197. In 1880–1881 the president was I. M.

A dormitory and a music hall were added in the 1880s, and the college played a prominent role in the culture of the area, particularly after Soule University closed in 1887; the college's monthly literary magazine, the Philomathean, was active in raising money in the mid-1880s to establish a home for Confederate veterans. Enrollment had risen to 112 by 1885, but fell by half in the following ten years: the college took in 70 public school students, 50 of them boys, to raise money. The Methodist Texas Conference provided support, and the college was given the Soule University property to reduce its debt, but public schools in Texas were improving, women's colleges were less popular, and yellow fever continued to be a problem in the area. The curriculum was revised in 1900 to conform to the Methodist Church General Board of Education; a study published in January 1912 assessed the college as offering primarily secondary-school level courses.Elizabeth A[very] Coulton, \\"Southern Colleges for Women\\", The North Carolina High School Bulletin 3.1 (January 1912) 3–19, p. 14; revised as \\"Standards of Southern Colleges for Women\\", The School Review 20.7 (September 1912) 458–75, p. 472 (misspelled as \\"Chapel Hill\\"). It was closed in 1912, at which time enrollment was 112. The building was used as a public school until 1926, when it was replaced by the building that now houses the museum of the Chappell Hill Historical Society.

On 19 August in a maiden at Kempton she recorded her first success as she led from the start and won by four lengths from the favourite Oriental Fashion. The filly was moved up sharply in class when she was sent to Ireland for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh on 6 September. Starting a 14/1 outsider she led for most of the way before fading in the closing stages and finishing eighth of the thirteen runners behind Edabiya. After a four-week break, Hula Angel returned in the Listed Oh So Sharp Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 3 October. After being restrained by Hills in the early stages she struggled to obtain a clear run in the last quarter mile but stayed on to take third place behind Smittenby and Fragrant Oasis with favourite Wince in fifth place. Two weeks later over the same course and distance she started at odds of 10/1 in a fourteen-runner field for the Group Two Rockfel Stakes. Wince started favourite while the other runners included Subito (Blue Seal Stakes), Atlantic Destiny (Sirenia Stakes), Fragrant Oasis and Valentine Waltz. After settling just behind the leaders she went to the front a furlong from the finish and won by a length and a quarter from Valentine Waltz, with the other Hills-trained runner Hasty Words a hort head away in third place. =1999: three-year-old season= Hula Angel began her second season in the 1000 Guineas run that year over the July Course at Newmarket on 2 May. Starting at odds of 14/1 she tracked the leaders on the stands-side (the right-hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint) but made little progress in the closing stages and finished sixth behind Wince, Wannabe Grand, Valentine Waltz, Capistrano Day and Pescara. Three weeks later at the Curragh she faced Wince yet again in the Irish 1000 Guineas and started a 16/1 outsider whilst her old rival was made the 5/4 favourite. The other fifteen runners included Edabiya, Sunspangled, Mythical Girl (Princess Margaret Stakes), Show Me The Money (Round Tower Stakes, Cornwallis Stakes, Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes), Capistrano Day and Carambola (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial). Hills positioned her on the outside just behind the leaders as Carambola set the pace, before beginning to make progress approaching the final quarter mile. She took the lead a furlong from the finish and held on under strong pressure to win by a neck and a head from the outsiders Golden Silca and Dazzling Park. After the race Barry Hills said \\"She has done it well today. The ground was on the fast side for her at Newmarket. Obviously the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot is on the agenda, but I would like to run her over a mile and a quarter at some stage and she could go for the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood.\\" Hula Angel failed to reproduce her Curragh form in two subsequent races. In the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot on 16 June she finished unplaced behind Balisada after being hampered two furlongs from the finish. On her final appearance she made little impact as she finished seventh of the eight runners in the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket on 9 July. Breeding record Hula Angel was retired from racing to become a broodmare. In 2008 she was put up for auction at the Inglis Weanling & Breeding Stock Sale and was bought for $528,220 by Heritage Bloodstock. She has produced at least eleven foals and six winners: *Stormy Love, a chestnut colt, foaled in 2002, by Giant's Causeway.

Though extinct as a distinct ethnolinguistic group, their descendants survive among the neighbouring Nunggubuyu. Language Warndarang has been classified as a member of the Gunwinyguan language group. Though thought to be extinct by 1974, some sources state that a fluent speaker was interviewed in 1989 and provided significant amounts of oral text in the language, together with a translation into Kriol. Country The traditional lands of the Warndarang extended over an area in Arnhem Land of some from the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Phelp River inland to Mount Leane. To their north were the Nunggubuyu while their western borders reached inland, eastwards to the Ngandi territories between the Walker and Rose rivers. History In 1903 the Eastern and African Cold Storage Company purchased the Hodgson Downs cattle station and other tribal lands, and embarked on a policy of systematic extermination of all Aboriginal people residing on the land which the company directors wished to turn into a pastoral empire. Hunting gangs consisting of 10-14 Aboriginal (though not local) men, armed and under the supervision of a white or \\"half-caste\\" foreman, were commissioned to clear the land by shooting any Aboriginal person on sight. When the Church of England established the Roper River Mission in 1908, the remnants of the Warndarang, together with survivors of other local clans of peoples such as the Alawa, Marra, Ngalakan, Ngandi, and the southern clans of the Rembarrnga and Nunggubuyu gathered there for sanctuary from the onslaught.

This was because before its description in 1958 all the species of the genus Automate were found in the Indo-Pacific region. A. branchialis has not been recorded in the Indo-Pacific region and has been found to be widespread in the Mediterranean so it is now considered to be a Mediterranean endemic. Discovery and distribution Automate branchialis was originally described from specimens collected by Holthuis & Gottlieb off the coast of Israel in the 1950s. At the time the pistol shrimps of the genus Automate were only known from the Indian and Pacific Oceans and although Holthuis & Gottlieb described their specimens as the new species Automate branchialis it was assumed that it had invaded the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal from the Red Sea by Lessepsian migration. A. branchialis was subsequently collected from a number of locations in the Mediterranean including Izmir Bay in Turkey, in the Greek Islands, Cyprus, from Manfredonia Bay in Italy, Malta, off Marseilles, the Balearic Islands and off Spain. The widespread distribution of A. branchialis in the Mediterranean and the lack of any records in the Indo-Pacific region have led researchers to conclude that it is a previously overlooked endemic Mediterranean species.

After moving to Austria in 1891, she became the first woman to lecture at the University of Vienna when in February 1897 she gave two public lectures on Britain's cooperative movement. Soon afterwards she concentrated on the history of art, especially modern art. In 1898 she founded a school in Vienna, based on those in England, with a focus on art and the English language. In addition to her contributions to art journals, she published a number of books on Austrian art. Biography Born in Birminghamin 1853, Levetus grew up in an active Jewish family environment with strong religious, literary and cultural interests. After schooling in Birmingham at King Edward's School, she attended the Midland Institute and Mason College before studying economics and teaching at the universities of Birmingham, St Andrews, Cambridge and Aberdeen. In 1891, she moved to Vienna where she taught English and became active as a journalist. In 1897 she was invited to give two lectures at the University of Vienna on the cooperative movement in Great Britain, becoming the first woman to lecture at the university. Shortly afterwards, her interest turned from economics to art and culture, especially modern art which she had experienced through John Ruskin and William Morris while still in England. She began to associate with the Secession group of modern artists and those from the Kunstgewerbeschule who reflected the trends she had seen in Britain. This encouraged her to contribute to become the Viennese correspondent not only for the London art magazine The Studio but for several German-language periodicals. She also kept the Viennese informed of trends in British art by contributing to Kunst und Kunsthandwerk. In 1904, she published Imperial Vienna: An Account of its History, Traditions and Arts, targeted at readers back in her native Britain. After articles on \\"Modern Decorative Art in Austria\\" and \\"The Art Revival in Austria\\" for The Studio, she collaborated with Michael Haberland to publish Peasant Art in Austria and Hungary in 1911, one of the first detailed accounts in English of Austrian folk art. Despite being considered by some as belonging to the enemy during the First World War, she continued to teach, continuing the activities of the John Ruskin Club which promoted English conversation. This was later seen as evidence of the Volksheim's liberal outlook. In 1925, together with the historian Friedrich Hertz, she launched the Revue Reconstruction in support of the redevelopment of Austria. She also contributed to the women's movement in Vienna, lecturing on education and the improvement of conditions for women and for the working classes. Levetus never married. She died in Vienna in 1938.

After having a full-length drama on Broadway, Anderson gave talks on empowerment and success largely related to the New Thought movement. Born in Wichita, Kansas, his family moved to Sacramento, California. Anderson left home at an early age, working as a newsboy, railroad porter and hotel bellhop. In his late 30s he read a book about New Thought, saw a play by Channing Pollack and thought that his life experience and new attitude had the makings of a play. Anderson wrote the initial version of Appearances; with the assistance of Al Jolson, the play (the first three-act play by an African American) was produced on Broadway. Although it was not a success, Anderson's industry and can-do attitude were appreciated. The play was produced several times and toured the US and the UK. Anderson settled in the UK, inventing a malted-milk product and giving religious talks. He received support from Dean of Canterbury Dick Sheppard, and returned to the US for a speaking tour. During the tour, he became a New Thought minister and married Doris Sequirra. After their return to England, she wrote a book about their experiences which was published in the UK and the US. Anderson wrote other plays and books; in early 1939 he was promoting his book, Uncommon Sense, as a possible play. After having a heart attack in London, he died in New York a few days after his return. Anderson was cremated, and Doris brought his remains back to the UK. Appearances was the first three-act play by an African American on Broadway after The Chip Woman's Fortune, a 1923 one-act play by Willis Richardson which was the first non-musical Broadway play by an African American. The substance of Appearances moral dimensions and its history are the objects of diverse points of view. Background According to Alan Kriezenbeck in 1994, most available primary information about Anderson is in the Billy Rose Theatre Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Most of the material is unsourced, undated newspaper clippings from Anderson's scrapbooks.Garland Anderson and \\"Appearances\\": The Playwright and His Play by Alan Kreizenbeck, The Journal of American Drama and Theatre; New York, N.Y.6.2 (Spring 1994): 28. The Helen Armstead-Johnson collection at the library also has a number of clippings; Anderson was the first person of color who was a member of PEN International. =Kansas= Anderson was born on February 18,Ancestry.com; California State Library; Sacramento, California; Biographical Files, dated March, 1928, noted as author of From Bellhop to Playwright and Appearances on the back.Ancestry.com; Registration State: California; Registration County: San Francisco; Roll: 1544246; Draft Board: 12. 1886, the fourth of twelve children. After about four years of schooling, he and his family moved to California. Their last known residence in Kansas may have been Topeka in 1895,Kansas State Historical Society; Topeka, Kansas; 1895 Kansas Territory Census; Roll: v115_137; Line: 19. and a March 1928 California State Library biography lists his parents as Louis Anderson and Naomi Bowman. Newspaper articles also indicate the early-to-mid-1890s for Anderson's arrival in California;Henry Doughterty, \\"Noted negro's philosophy does not embrace 'isms'\\", The Honolulu Advertiser, January 29, 1936, pp. 1, 5. they referred to his father's birth in slavery,\\"Garland Anderson captures London\\", The Pittsburgh Courier, January 18, 1930, p. 16. and Wichita was incorporated as a city on July 21, 1870 (after the American Civil War). The only black man then in the settlement, a migrant from the east, signed the petition to form the city.Michael Carmody, \\"Early Wichita's African-Americans\\", February 20, 2014. It is doubtful that Anderson's parents' families were from Wichita; his parents were probably attracted to it because of economic opportunity and relatively-relaxed attitudes about race. Churches for blacks were founded in the late 1870s, and a larger black settlement began during the 1880s.Patrick Joseph O'Connor, \\"Black Experience and the Blues in 1950s Wichita\\", Mid- America Folklore, Spring 1993. After Wichita was incorporated, it experienced an economic boom with the founding of two colleges and the passage of the Kansas Civil Rights Act of 1874. By 1890 Wichita was Kansas' third-largest city, despite anti-Chinese violence in 1886Julie Courtwright, \\"A slave to yellow peril - the 1886 Chinese ouster attempt in Wichita, Kansas\\", Great Plains Quarterly, Center for Great Plains Studies, paper 2351, January 1, 2002. and increased racial segregation. The city fell into recession, and many of its original settlers went bankrupt. =California= When Anderson's family arrived in Sacramento, his father was a janitor for the post office. His mother died shortly after their arrival, and Anderson soon moved to San Francisco. From the 1860s to the 1880s San Francisco began its transformation into a major city, expanding in all directions and culminating in the 1887 construction of Golden Gate Park. The city's cable-car system was developed around this time. During the first decade of the 20th century, Anderson worked as a newsboy; decades later, his old boss remembered him working before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. He may have been a railroad porter after the fire. For about 15 years beginning around 1909, Anderson worked as a bellhop at a number of hotels. According to a 1918 draft card, Anderson was married and a hotel clerk in San Francisco. In the 1920 census Anderson, divorced, worked on Sutter Street as an operator; his father was born in Virginia and his mother in Ohio.Year: 1920; Census Place: San Francisco Assembly District 32, San Francisco, California; Roll: T625_138; p. 3B; Enumeration District: 200; Image: 289. Appearances Anderson briefly dabbled in Christian Science. In early 1924, before he heard about Channing Pollack's The Fool,Wood Soanes, \\"Curtain Calls\\", Oakland Tribune, April 29, 1924, p. 29. he became aware of psychology and read a book on New Thought, which impressed him.\\"Bell boy turns to play writing\\", The Sun (New York), January 12, 1925, p. 11. Anderson received tickets from an elderly couple, saw Pollock's play and became convinced that he could write a comparable play based on his experiences. His son was eight years old at the time,In the Black world: Thomas Fleming's 20th Century By Thomas C. Fleming Edited by Max Millard. and the whereabouts of his first wife are unknown. Anderson headed the household of his brother's widow and her four children. He later said about his decision to write: > At first the idea seemed absurd ... No one realized more than myself that > though I wanted to write this play, I had no training in the technique of > dramatic construction; but I also realized that to shirk what I wanted to do > could be likened to the outer shell of the acorn after it was planted in the > ground saying to the inner stir of life for expression, \\"What are you > stirring for? Surely you don't expect to become a great oak tree?\\" With this > firm conviction I determined to write a play.\\" He wrote about the process of writing: > Whenever the switchboard would ring while I was writing I would say to > myself, \\"This is just a loving call coming just at the right time to refresh > my thoughts in order that I might be able to write better\\"; and when someone > would speak to me I would mentally say, \\"This is a loving interruption > coming at just the right time to prevent me from writing the wrong thing. Anderson wrote Don't Judge By Appearances in three weeks. According to his typist, she became engrossed by it and it helped her solve a personal problem. He showed the play to San Francisco Chronicle critic George Warren; Warren thought the idea very good, but its writing needed work. Anderson received support from friends and co-workers at his hotel because of his optimism and enthusiasm.J. F. Driscoll, \\"Here are your young Americans who have made good spectacularly. Nothing could stop them from climbing up and up and up\\", St. Louis Post-Dispatch (St. Louis, Missouri), December 13, 1925, p. 130. He was connected with Al Jolson, who supported the play's early development and his move to New York City in 1924.

By Christmas, Anderson reported a leave of absence from the Braeburn Apartments Hotel (where he was a switchboard operator) and support from Al Jolson, Marjorie Rambeau, Channing Pollock and Richard Bennett.* \\"Play by bellboy indorsed by stars\\", The Indianapolis Star, December 26, 1924, p. 2. * Earl L.

Anderson made the rounds of newspapers, who took him at his word. By April, however, the play had funding difficulties. Early in the month, Anderson presented a reading to an audience of 600 at the Waldorf-Astoria to drum up support.\\"600 Waldorf- Astoria guests applaud negro bellhop's play\\", Buffalo Evening News, April 7, 1925, p. 18. Although audience members were reportedly moved to tears, the reading earned only $140.

Berlack, \\"Post lenten dances give many thrills\\", The Pittsburgh Courier, April 25, 1925, p. 3. and a free reading at the Manhattan Opera House was scheduled for April 26.* \\"Judge not according to appearance\\" (advert), The New York Times, April 20, 1925, p. 21. * \\"Bellboy's play to have a second reading\\", The Sun (New York), April 20, 1025, p. 9. When funding still lagged, Anderson went to see President Calvin Coolidge and New York Governor Al Smith; in June, another writer was brought in and the play was renamed Appearances. Theater manager Lester W. Sagar offered to produce it, receiving an option to purchase half the rights for $15,000 while Anderson retained the West Coast production rights. Two Braeburn Apartments residents reportedly became major investors. Anderson returned to his job in San Francisco, selling half the West Coast production rights for another $15,000 after two public readings (the second broadcast on KFCR). His sendoff from the mayor of San Francisco was well-publicized; he hurried back to New York in a touring car driven by a friend\\"Drives flint coast to coast in 120 hours\\", The Sun (New York), September 2, 1925, p. 22.

The play received a standing ovation on opening night but lukewarm reviews, although Anderson was praised. The New York Times called it \\"finely conceived, crudely wrought. ... If the language of the play is not always smooth and eloquent, if many of the characters are overdrawn, if the plot dips too often into melodrama, the play is none the less moving ... What if the lines are heavy and speechy? They are filled with the protest which roused a negro bellboy to write a play.

The institute has been conceptualised as a platform from which independent initiatives and organizations could emerge. The first of these initiatives was Public Netbase – now an ‘historical example’ of an early new media organization in Europe.Cf. Clemens Apprich / Felix Stalder (Hrsg.): Vergessene Zukunft. Radikale Netzkulturen in Europa. transcript, Bielefeld 2012, (in German). Founded in 1994, it was located in Messepalast, the predecessor of Vienna's Museumsquartier. It combined various functions and activities: It was a non-profit Internet service provider that facilitated internet access mainly for the independent arts and cultural sector. This was accompanied by a program of workshops and courses to develop media competence. Public Netbase became a social space for this emerging scene of artists, techheads, activists etc., and ran an almost daily evening program of discussions, presentations, screenings and music events. In addition to these grassroots activities international exhibitions and conferences were conducted.For the period 1995-1999 press coverage - mainly in Austria, but also in international newspapers and magazines, e.g. Frankfurter Rundschau, Kunstforum International, The Daily Telegraph, Mute, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Telepolis, The New York Times and Artbyte.The Magazine of Digital Arts - has been documented by t0: http://www.t0.or.at/1995.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1996.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1997.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1998.htm, http://www.t0.or.at/1999.htm, retrieved: 04-12-2013, mostly in German Public Netbase used to be t0's main initiative until it had to be discontinued due to lack of funding (which was a result of repression by the Austrian right-wing government Subsidies by the federal government had made up a main part of Public Netbase’s funds before, cf.

Starting from the Brussels project, a series of international exhibitions and conferences has been developed. World-Information Institute (WII) is WIO's research department.

With its WWW-server as well as with its workshops, instruction courses, and educational events for the broad public, Public Netbase contributed continually to the evolution of a lively internet scene and a heightened consciousness for the implications of the new communication and information technologies. As a focal point of European and international art, culture, and media networks, the Viennese net culture institute attempted to develop an understanding for the manifold opportunities and the potential of new communication media, but also to look critically at a society that is increasingly determined by technology.

Quigley joined the BBC in 1930 and she was responsible for \\"talks\\" aimed at women. She was the fourth woman in this role since the first women's talk in 1923. The first was Ella FitzGerald who continued until 1926 when Elise Sprott took over. There was an overlap with Margery Wace OBE in 1930-31 and Quigley took over the role in 1936. Quigley was given an MBE for her work organising talks on the radio during the war. She contacted Donald Winnicott who had worked with Clare Britton, a psychiatric social worker treating children who had become evacuees. His first series of talks in 1943 was titled \\"Happy Children\\", Quigley offered him total control over the content of his talks but this soon became more consultative as Quigley advised him on the correct pitch. Quigley left the BBC in 1945 to marry Kevin Fitzgerald who gave talks for the BBC as well as being an Irish businessman and thriller writer. He and Quigley went to live in Ireland where she became a step mother to her husband's daughter.

Life and career  Mary Rennell was the daughter of the first Lord Bicester and was educated at home by private tutors, but at 17 she joined the Slade School of Fine Art as a part-time student while also, for several months, working as a ward maid for the war wounded before the Armistice on 11 November 1918. After leaving art school she shared a studio with Diana Walton in Kennington, London. She married Francis Rodd, the explorer, diplomat and author, in 1928 and the couple went on to have four daughters. In the 1930s Rennell was introduced to the \\"Oxford Group\\" by a friend of her mother's. This later became the Moral Re-armament Association (MRA) of which Rennell was an active participant for 18 years. In 1940 Rennell took her children to America to avoid the impact of World War II on London. Before returning to Britain, in 1943, she held a one- woman show of drawings in New York. In 1952 Rennell converted to Catholicism. From 1952 onwards she travelled extensively with her husband. In Australia she held one-woman shows in both Perth and Melbourne in 1968. She also exhibited frequently in London at the Royal Society of British Artists, The Royal Society of Portrait Painters and at the Royal Academy. Originally Rennell mostly painted landscapes in oils but later turned to drawing in ink on rice paper. There are seven works by Rennell in the Tate's prints and drawings collection. The Arts Council of Wales and the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth also hold examples of her work.

After KNC forces entered the town of Khanasor in the Iraqi Sinjar Mountains, fighting boke out among unclear circumstances, resulting in dozens of casualties. The clashes have widely been seen as symptomatic for the high tensions among the forces that fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) around Sinjar, and the risk that these tensions could escalate into turf wars, which would degrade any attempts to drive the extremist group from the region for good.  Background  YJÊ fighter in 2016. YBŞ and YJÊ were organised and trained by the PKK, resulting in their conflict with the Kurdistan Democratic Party. When ISIL invaded the Sinjar Mountains in 2014 and began to massacre its Yezidi population, the PKK intervened with hundreds of fighters in order to save the locals from the Islamic State militants. Since then, the PKK set up two local Yezidi self-defense groups, namely the Sinjar Resistance Units and the Êzîdxan Women's Units. In late 2015, anti-ISIL forces finally succeeded in driving the Islamic State mostly from the Sinjar area, but the PKK fighters have since refused to leave and continue to train and equip the local PKK-affiliated militias. This has caused resentment among the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which regards Sinjar as part of Iraqi Kurdistan and sees the PKK as local political rival. The KDP believes that the presence of the PKK in Sinjar is illegal, and that their own Peshmerga forces are the only legitimate security force of the area. The Rojava Peshmerga are Syrian Kurdish fighters affiliated with the KNC, which in turn was set up by the KDP, and effectively operate as part of the KDP's regular armed forces.  History  On 2 March, the Rojava Peshmerga stated that they would relocate to the Syrian border near al-Hawl in order to stop smuggling operations, but as they moved further south into the Sinjar Mountains, they came into conflict with the Sinjar Resistance Units at Khanasor. The KNC forces later claimed that they had been blocked by the YBŞ while simply passing through the area, while the YBŞ in turn argued that the Rojava Peshmerga had attempted to occupy Khanasor on the orders of Turkey and the Kurdistan Democratic Party. On the next morning, heavy fighting broke out in Khanasor. Both sides later accused each other of having initiated the battle: Whereas the YBŞ said that they had peacefully asked the KNC fighters to leave the town, whereupon the latter attacked them with heavy weapons, the Rojava Peshmerga stated that they were first shot at and decided to take a stand rather than simply retreat. In any case, heavy clashes broke out, during which several fighters were killed or wounded, and several civilians also became casualties. On 4 March, a ceasefire had come into effect, with PKK-affiliated groups and the KNC negotiating a solution of the conflict, though pro-PKK media claimed that the peshmerga prepared a new attack on Khanasor.  Reactions  Pro-PKK media claimed that the fighting was the result of a Turkish attempt to \\"turn the Southern Kurdistan territory into a battle field, starting from Shingal, and thus to invade this territory\\". According to this view, the Rojava Peshmerga were proxies of the Turkish MIT, hostile to both the PKK as well as the Yezidis. The YBŞ also claimed that they enjoyed the full support of the local population, and PKK-supporting locals as well as some Yezidi refugees in Al- Malikiyah indeed protested against the invervention of the Rojava Peshmerga and said that the pro-PKK forces had every right to defend themselves from the Peshmerga attacks. In Rojava, the Kurdish youth group Ciwanen Soresger, which is close to the PKK-allied Democratic Union Party, attacked KNC offices in Al- Darbasiyah and Qamishli in protest of the Sinjar clashes. The Peshmerga, on the other side, blamed the pro-PKK fighters for the escalation. They argued that they wanted to avoid further clashes, but were also the legitimate security force of Sinjar and because of that, \\"Peshmerga forces are free to move whenever and wherever they want in Kurdistan's soil. We will not ask permission from anyone\\". The KDP also stated that the PKK should simply leave Sinjar to avoid further tensions, with Omed Sabah, spokesperson of Masoud Barzani, stating that the YBŞ' presence in Sinjar was not legitimized \\"just because they have a few people from Shingal in their rank\\". Osman Baydemir, the spokesperson of the HDP, called the conflict between the pro-PKK and pro- KDP forces a \\"civil war\\" that \\"has to stop\\". Similarly, Patriotic Union of Kurdistan deputy Kosrat Rasul Ali also condemned the infighting on both legal as well as moral grounds. Josef Weidenholzer, a Member of the European Parliament and chairman of the Yezidi Friendship Group, appealed the Rojava Peshmerga and the Sinjar Resistance Units to \\"stop all hostilities and solve political differences\\", also because any international support to either faction is dependent of \\"the peaceful solution of Intra-Kurdish problems\\". Several civilian inhabitants of Khanasor, meanwhile, expressed frustration and anger at the clashes, saying that both groups should focus on expelling ISIL from southern Sinjar rather than fighting each other. Some locals even said both groups should simply retreat from the Sinjar Mountains, and leave the Yezidi civilians alone. Both Mir Tahsin Beg, leader of the Yezidi community, as well as Nadia Murad, female Yezidi activist and UN Goodwill ambassador, called on both sides to stop the fighting. Murad said that \\"it is deeply saddening for me to see once again victims of Genocide become victims of an internal conflict, it is painful to see the Yezidi women again are suffering from fear after all that happened to them\\". An expert also warned that both the Sinjar Resistance Units as well as the Rojava Peshmerga had been very effective at \\"keeping IS at bay\\" and that the fighting among these anti-ISIL forces \\"would slow the process to liberate the remaining territory from IS\\". In a statement on 3 March, the Kurdish National Alliance in Syria, which consists of former KNC groups, called for the cessation of hostilities in Sinjar. The alliance called on all armed groups to \\"resort to calm and restraint\\" and to begin dialogue. The KNAS also called for an end to \\"biased media campaigns\\" that broadcast \\"sedition\\" among Kurdish factions. The Ministry of Defence of Germany expressed concern that German weapons supplied to the Peshmerga were used in the clashes. \\"The government of the Kurdistan- Iraq region has committed itself, by final declaration, to use the delivered weapons only for the fight against the so-called Islamic State and in accordance with international humanitarian law\\", a defence ministry spokesman told Der Spiegel on 6 March.

Early life Irene Bianucci was born on December 16, 1903 in Lucca, Tuscany, Italy to Assunta (née Cataldi) and Amadeo Bianucci. When she was six years old, her family immigrated to the United States, first settling in Farmer City, Illinois, before moving to the nearby city of Clinton. After graduating from Clinton High School in 1922, Bianucci went on to study at Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois. In 1924, Bianucci won the Minnie Bachman Mueller prize from Millikin for exceptional ability in execution of a mural entitled \\"Music\\". She began entering her work in county fairs winning two first place ribbons at the Illinois State Fair in 1926 for a still life and a painting of animals. Graduating from Miliken after completion of her studies, Bianucci continued her training, enrolling at the Chicago Art Institute, later that same year. Returning to the fair competition in 1927, Bianucci won three blue ribbons and five red ribbons for her paintings at the state fair. In 1930, she was awarded the Union League Club of Chicago Art Prize for her painting, \\"Little Russian Girl\\" and then won The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Fellowship to continue her studies in New York. Bianucci's painting, \\"La Pensierosa\\", was selected to be part of the Art Institute of Chicago’s 34th Annual Exhibition in 1930. The following year, she participated in a show of works by the present and former students of George Raab at the Decatur Art Institute. Bianucci's portraiture was singled out for its eye- catching qualities. Career Beginning in 1931, Bianucci worked as a professional portraitist. Her studio was located on Dearborn Street and she participated in gallery showings in 1935 at the Chicago Art Institute and Tower Town Galleries. Glowing reviews of her works, such as \\"In the Storm\\", \\"Rain\\", and \\"Young Girl\\", appeared regularly in Eleanor Jewett's column on the arts in The Chicago Tribune, in 1940. Rural Scene-Wakarusa Valley Bianucci joined the Works Progress Administration (WPA) artists of Illinois, receiving commissions to paint murals in Chicago at the Clara Barton Elementary School and the Martin A. Ryerson Elementary School. Her two murals at Ryerson, Discovery of America and Landing of Columbus were painted in 1940. Her mural at Clara Barton School was later destroyed. In 1941, Bianucci won the commission to paint the post office mural at Mount Carroll, Illinois. The mural, entitled Rural Scene–Wakarusa Valley, was an oil on canvas farm scene, which was restored in the late 1990s. When the federal artist's program ended in 1943, Bianucci worked as an illustrator and designer for the Container Corporation of America throughout World War II. Bianucci married fellow artist, Roy Robert Soravia, who was involved in the Op art movement and directed the Parnassus Gallery in Chicago. In 1949, the couple moved to Leucadia, Encinitas, California. Both continued to paint and showed their works at such galleries as Mandel Brother's Art Gallery of Chicago.

She occupied herself as a woodcarver, portrait painter, and book illustrator. As an illustrator, she collaborated with her sister, Elizabeth Eggleston Seelye, and her father, Edward Eggleston, on a number of books including The story of Columbus (1892), The story of Washington, and The Graysons. Early years and education Allegra Eggleston was born in Stillwater, Minnesota, November 19, 1860. She was the second daughter of Edward Eggleston, the author, who came of a well- known Virginia family, with strains of Irish and Scotch in his descent. Her mother's family was of English origin. A delicate and high-strung child, she early showed a talent for drawing and modeling. One of her first works of art was an idol carved out of a piece of semi-decayed wood, when she was only six years of age. She drew constantly and modeled occasionally in clay, but she had no art teaching until she was received into classes in Cooper Institute in October, 1875. She was under age, being only 14, but was accepted on account of remarkable promise. She did creditable work there for two years, after which she entered the studio of Wyatt Eaton, where she made rapid progress in painting from life. In 1878, she went to Europe in company with her father and family for a year. While abroad, she took lessons under a Swiss wood-carver in Paris and astonished him by successfully carving the most difficult pieces as soon as she had learned the use of her tools. About 1891, she returned to study art in Paris with Charles Lasar and was friends with the American miniaturist from Cleveland, Sarah Elizabeth Rickey (1844-1923). Career After her return home, she occupied herself with wood-carving, painting also some portraits, which were exhibited in the annual exhibitions of the Society of American Artists. In 1882, she carved panels for a memorial mantel piece in the editorial rooms of The Century Magazine, on one of which was cut a portrait in bas-relief of Dr. Josiah Gilbert Holland. That piece of work was destroyed by fire in 1888, and Eggleston was called upon to replace it. Later, she occupied herself with book illustrations. Her father's novel, The Graysons, is illustrated by her, while many of the pictures in his popular school histories, as well as in other school books, bear her signature. She illustrated The story of Columbus, written by her sister, Elizabeth Eggleston Seelye, and edited by their father, as well as The story of Washington. Eggleston was versatile. She created many kinds of artistic decorative works for amusement including paintings of children's faces. Among other things she modeled in leather, having executed the cover for the album containing autographs of distinguished American authors, which was presented to Mrs. Grover Cleveland, Frances Folsom Cleveland Preston, as an acknowledgment of her interest in the father's copyright bill, International Copyright Act of 1891. Personal life Eggleston spent the winter in New York City and made her home during the rest of the year at Lake George, where she had a studio in her father's stone library. She lived unmarried in The Owl's Nest with her friend Mabel Cook. Known as Tante, Eggleston died in 1933.

Brăiloiu (October 3, 1809 or 1810-June 19, 1889) was a Wallachian and Romanian politician. Born in Craiova, he was the oldest child of Nicolae Brăiloiu and his wife, Zoe or Zinca (née Vlădăianu or Vlădoianu). He had two brothers, one of whom died early, and three sisters. His father, born to Iordache Zătreanu and Marghioala Brăiloiu, had been adopted by logothete Dumitrache Brăiloiu around 1788. Brăiloiu, Vlădăianu and Zătreanu are all old boyar families from the Oltenia region.Vlad, p. 35 Constantin was married twice: to Coralia Ghica-Brigadier, and then to Ecaterina (Catinca) Hagi Moscu. He had three sons and three daughters by the latter. One of the daughters, Maria, married Anton Berindei. A son, Nicolae, was the father of Constantin Brăiloiu.Vlad, pp. 35-6 Starting in 1822, Brăiloiu went to school abroad, in Sibiu, Geneva and Paris. By 1832, he was a supplementary bureaucrat at the state secretariat. He was also prosecutor at the criminal section of the judicial court (1837), at the court of appeals (1841, 1842) and a member of the criminal appeals court (1853). In 1855, he returned to the secretariat as assessor. The following year, he was named to the committee handling the freeing of the Roma slaves. Subsequently, he was a member of the high court of justice and, in 1859, president of the commercial court.Vlad, p. 36 In 1838 and from 1841 to 1843, Brăiloiu taught criminal law, civil and commercial judicial procedure at Saint Sava College. Following the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, he became director of the country's school administration. Meanwhile, he steadily rose in the ranks of the nobility: pitar (1841), serdar (1842), paharnic (1847), clucer (1850) and aga (1855)--in other words, from ninth in the hierarchy to fifth. From 1859, at the time of the Union of the Principalities, Brăiloiu entered politics. He was an incisive journalist, as attested by his contributions to Conservatorul Progresist, Unirea, Desbaterile and Timpul. He was also among the most active conservative elected officials of the time. In 1859, he was sent as a Gorj County deputy to Wallachia's elective assembly, joining the legislative assembly in 1861. From 1859 to 1861, he sat on the central committee in Focșani, coordinating policy with his counterparts from Moldavia. He was state secretary from 1858 to 1859, and was twice Justice Minister under Barbu Catargiu. His first stint in this office was in April–May 1861, covering Wallachia alone; then, from January to June 1862, he served in a unified government for all Romania. Between 1862 and 1864, he took part in the debates of the legislative assembly. In 1866, the electors of Târgu Jiu sent Brăiloiu to represent them in the constituent assembly. He was in the Assembly of Deputies in 1873-1874 and re-elected for Gorj in 1875. From February to May 1876, he was Assembly President.Ion Alexandrescu, Enciclopedia de istorie a României, vol. II, p. 71.

It was originally located at the site where Skovgård School in Ordrup is now located but moved to its current site at Krathusvej 36 when the school was built in the 1950s. History Skovgården was built in 1820. In 1831 it was acquired by the merchant Hans Puggaard who spent the summers there with his wife Bolette. Their visitors included many leading artists of the Danish Golden Age, including C. W. Eckersberg, Vilhelm Marstrand, Bertel Thorvaldsen, Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll and Herman Wilhelm Bissen. After Hans and Bolette Puggaard's daughter Marie married the politician Orla Lehmann in 1844 the estate was also frequented by many of the leading politicians of the time. Lehmann was a key figure in the adoption of the Constitution of Denmark in 1849. As a gift to his children, Pugaard also commissioned the architect Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll to build another country house in the area. It was named Krathuset for its location in Ordrup Krat. After Puggaard's death in 1866, Skovgård was taken over by his grand daughter Margrethe Lehmann together with her husband Gotfred Rode. Rode, a prominent literary historian, created a meetingplace for Grundtvigian and National Liberal opinion leaders. In 1874 he established a folk high school in the building but it closed after his death in 1878. In 1880. Skovgård was acquired by Frederik V. Hegel, owner of Gyldendal. He used it as a summer residence together with his son and daughter-in-law Jacob and Julie Hegel. The house remained a meetingplace for Copenhagen's literary establishment until the 1920s. After that it was for a while left empty. In the 1940, Skovgård was purchased by Hentofte Municipality whose intention was to build a new primary school at the central location in the growing suburb. The house was listed and it was therefore decided to move it to a new located at Krathusvej 36. The house was later refurbished by Mogens Lassen. Skovgårdsskolen The Skovgård School was inaugurated at the old site in 1951. It was designed by the architects Hans Erling Langkilde and Ib Martin Jensen.

It is largely known for its pediment featuring a military scene, the Spanish victory over the Moors in the Battle of Tétouan. The church was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines.  History  The construction of San Joaquin Church was completed in 1869 during the Spanish colonization era by Augustinians. The convent of the San Joaquin Church was left in ruins after the World War II leaving its noted well and kiln which were used for baking. The then National Historical Institute marked the church as a National Historical Site in 1980 pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 260 of 1973 and Presidential Decree No. 375 of 1974. In the 1980s the church structure underwent renovations. The side and back walls and the altar area was reinforced by cement by local priest which according to heritage conservationists caused the loss of the structure's integrity and authenticity. The structure was declared a National Cultural Treasure (NCT) by the National Museum of the Philippines (NMP) in 2001. The declaration also covers the convent ruins of the church complex. In 2015, a restoration was accomplished on the church building under the watch of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines but the lime plaster or palitada used to cover the facade chipped off in less than a year which led to heritage conservationists criticizing the national heritage body. Following the declaration of the San Joaquin Campo Santo cemetery as a NCT by the NMP, the heritage organization labels the church complex and the cemetery as the \\"San Joaquin Church Complex and Campo Santo of San Joaquin, Iloilo\\". Just recently, January 19, 2019, the Parish of San Joaquin celebrated the 150th Anniversary of the Church since 1869, the year the church's construction was completed during the time of Fray Tomas Santaren, OSA. The parishioners with the priests assigned helped together to re-enhance the interior design of the church and making all ways of restoring the original designs especially of the tabernacle with its gradas and also of the design of the side retablos. All the designs were carefully made so as to reflect the original designs of the church. The church was solemnly dedicated by His Excellency Most Rev. Jose Romeo O. Lazo, DD last January 18, 2019. Adjacent to the church, is the new Adoration Chapel which was blessed on the day of the fiesta celebration last January 19, 2019.  Features  The pediment of San Joaquin Church featuring the Battle of Tétouan The features of note of the church are its three retablos of carved limestone which were formerly polychromed, the carved pediment which featured the folk portrayal of the Spanish winning over the Moors at the Battle near Tétouan, Morocco as well as its adjacent sprawling ruins where an oven well and kilin for baking can be found.

After three fish are thrown a panel of 5 crabs judge the player with each crab having its own likes and dislikes on a scale of 1 to 10. There is also a boost bar which allows the player to increase the velocity of the fish being thrown. There are also achievements to be completed.

The Ottoman Navy ordered her from the Imperial Arsenal in Constantinople, and she was laid down in 1870, launched in 1872, and commissioned in 1874. She was armed with four guns, was powered by a single-screw compound steam engine with a top speed of . The ship saw action during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, but was laid up from 1878 to 1897. At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, the Ottoman Navy mobilized Mukaddeme-I Hayir and the rest of the ironclad fleet but found almost all of the ships to be in unusable condition. Mukaddeme-i Hayir was disarmed the following year and converted into a stationary training ship in 1911. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she became a barracks ship, and served in this capacity until 1923, when she was broken up. Design Mukaddeme-i Hayir was long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draft of . The hull was constructed with iron, and displaced normally and BOM. She had a crew of 16 officers and 153 enlisted men. The ship was powered by a single horizontal compound steam engine which drove one screw propeller. Steam was provided by six coal-fired box boilers that were trunked into a single funnel amidships. The engine was rated at and produced a top speed of , though decades of poor maintenance had reduced the ship's maximum speed to by 1892. Mukaddeme-i Hayir carried of coal. A supplementary sailing rig was also fitted. The ship was armed with a battery of four rifled, muzzle-loading Armstrong guns mounted in a central, armored casemate, two guns per side. The guns were positioned so as to allow any two to fire directly ahead, astern, or to either broadside. The casemate had heavy armor protection, with the gun battery protected by 229 mm of iron plating. The upper section of the casemate had thinner armor, at thick. The hull had a complete armored belt at the waterline, which extended .6 m (2 ft) above the line and 1.2 m (4 ft) below. The above-water portion was 222 mm thick, while the submerged part was 150 mm thick. Service history Mukaddeme-i Hayir, meaning \\"Great Abundance\\",} was ordered in 1868 from the Imperial Arsenal in 1868, a copy of her British-built sister ship . The vessel was laid down in 1870 and launched on 28 October 1872. She began sea trials in 1874 and was commissioned later that year. Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. The ship's only period of significant activity came three years later, with the outbreak of the Russo- Turkish War, which began on 24 April 1877. The Ottoman fleet had already mobilized in September 1876 and begun preparing for conflict, as tensions with Russia had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. At the onset of hostilities with Russia, Mukaddeme-i Hayir was based in Sulina with several other ironclads. On 14 May 1877, an Ottoman squadron consisting of Mukaddeme-i Hayir, Feth-i Bülend, , , , and bombarded Russian positions before landing infantry to capture of the Black Sea port of Sokhumi two days later. On the 31st, Mukaddeme-i Hayir, Feth-i Bülend, the steam frigate , and several other ships departed Batumi for Trabzon to bring ground troops to Varna to defend against an expected Russian attack across the Danube. By June, Mukaddeme-i Hayir had returned to Sulina at the mouth of the Danube, where she assisted in the defense of the town, along with a gunboat and an armed tugboat. Starting in November, a Russian flotilla of small vessels attempted to lay a minefield off Sulina to block the Ottoman vessels. On 8 November, the Ottoman gunboat was sunk by the mines, and Mukaddeme-i Hayir steamed out to engage the Russian vessels, forcing them to withdraw before they could complete the minefield. The next day, the Russians returned with mortar-equipped gunboats; neither side scored any hits before each flotilla withdrew. The Ottoman ironclad fleet in the Golden Horn In 1878, the ship was laid up in Constantinople, and she remained inactive for almost 20 years. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended. By the mid-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Mukkademe-i Hayir was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. Throughout this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. During this period of inactivity, she was modernized slightly in 1882, with the addition of several light guns. These included a pair of Krupp guns, two Krupp guns, two guns, and two Nordenfelt guns. By January 1886, Mukaddeme-i Hayir had been stationed in Tripoli in Ottoman Libya; at that time, she was the only Ottoman ironclad in active service. In February 1897, a Greek uprising against Ottoman rule broke out on Crete, prompting the Great Powers to deploy the International Squadron – a multinational force made up of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina), Imperial Russian Navy, and British Royal Navy – to Cretan waters to intervene in the uprising. The squadron′s senior admirals formed an \\"Admirals Council\\" that manage affairs on Crete until the uprising came to an end in December 1898. Events on Crete led to the start of the Greco-Turkish War of April–May 1897. In anticipation of the war breaking out, the Ottomans inspected the fleet in February 1897 and found that almost all of the vessels, including Mukaddeme-i Hayir, were completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy. Through April and May 1897, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. In 1898, Mukaddeme-i Hayir had her guns removed and placed ashore; her boilers also were removed. Following the end of the war with Greece in May 1897, the Ottoman government decided to begin a naval reconstruction program. The first stage was to rebuild the older armored warships, including Mukaddeme-i Hayir. The Ottomans contacted several foreign shipyards, and Krupp's Germaniawerft received the contract to rebuild Mukaddeme-i Hayir on 11 August 1900, but the deal was cancelled and the ship was not reconstructed. In 1911, she was converted into a stationary training ship, and after the outbreak of World War I in 1914, she became a barracks ship. Mukaddeme-i Hayir was transferred to İzmit in 1920, where she continued to serve as a barracks ship. She was decommissioned in September 1923 and broken up for scrap in İzmit.

She is a graduate of the School of Visual Arts in New York, NY and The International Center of Photography at Bard College MFA program. Her work focuses on history, identity, representation, and what it means to be a woman in the 21st century. Her work is in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum, and the Carnegie Museum.  Early life and education  Faustine was introduced to photography as a child. Her father and uncle were amateur photographers, and Faustine's first camera was a gift from her uncle. Faustine was initially inspired to become a photographer by a series of Time Life books. She was influenced by Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, and photojournalist Ernst Haas. However, at a young age Faustine struggled to find herself in the histories of photography she encountered, which focused on photographers who were disproportionately male and white. Faustine received a BFA at the School of Visual Arts in New York. She earned an MFA at the International Center for Photography-Bard College program in 2013. As an MFA student, Faustine began to move away from the traditional documentary model. \\"It just didn't work for me anymore. I wanted more room to play with communication. Conceptual works appealed to me.\\" Faustine began to work on \\"White Shoes\\" as a graduate student. Influenced by Lorna Simpson and Carrie Mae Weems, Faustine began the series as her thesis project in 2012 and continued to add to it over the subsequent three years. Mitochondria (2008-) In the ongoing series \\"Mitochondria\\", Faustine photographs herself, her mother, her sister, and her daughter in their shared home in Brooklyn, NY. The work illuminates both the strength of their familial bond and their interdependent destinies. The New York Times observed that the series is \\"a celebration of the power of African American women to nurture family, even in the direst circumstances. The series’ title refers to the mitochondrial DNA encoded in human genes, which is inherited solely from the mother. Through this scientific metaphor, the series commemorates the continuity of African American womanhood from one generation to another . . . .The series also underscores the role played by women of color in the struggle for equality and justice. Historically, African American women were marginalized within mainstream feminism. Nevertheless, they were able to turn to and embolden each other in the face of prejudice, even before the advent of the modern feminist movement.\\"  \\"White Shoes\\" (2015)  The White Shoes series portrays the history of slavery in New York through a series of nude self-portraits taken in former locations significant to the slave trade. The series also engages with representation of the black female body. This work is based on Faustine's research on the history of slavery in the five boroughs of New York City, including slave burial grounds, slave markets, slave owning farms, and the landing spots of slave ships. Standing in white shoes, she reminds viewers how often African-Americans must adopt white culture. Posing on a wooden box at locations around New York where slaves were once sold, \\"baring her flesh to history, she conveys the most fundamental horror of the slave trade, the way it reduced people to mere bodies, machines of muscle.\\" Her 2016 exhibition at Smack Mellon was reviewed extensively. The New Yorkers Alexandra Schwartz wrote, \\"Faustine’s photos serve to mark the places that belong to a history too often hidden from view, whether by design, or neglect, or the ever- frenetic pace of change inherent to life in New York.\\"  \\"My Country\\" (2016)  \\"My Country\\", Faustine's solo exhibition at Baxter St. Camera Club of New York, presented works from the \\"White Shoes\\" series, as well as a series of photographs of monuments. The monuments, including the Statue of Liberty and The Lincoln Memorial, are pictured with a black line slicing through the image. The Village Voice wrote that her work was \\"a frank rendering of America's disgraceful and all-too-buried legacy of marginalization\\" and explained the impact of the monument photographs: \\"the graphic interruption stands for the scores of mistreated Americans for whom such structures and their supposed representation of the common good have remained inaccessible\\"  Performances and exhibitions  *\\"Perilous Bodies,\\" Ford Foundation, NY, 2019 Group Exhibition. *\\"Slavery In The Hands Of Harvard,\\" Harvard University, 2019 Group Exhibition. *\\"Refraction: New Photography of Africa and its Diaspora\\", Steven Kasher Gallery, 2018, Group exhibition *\\"Making Them Known: Nona Faustine\\", Artspace, New Haven, CT, 2017, solo exhibition * \\"My Country\\", Baxter Street Camera Club, New York, NY, Dec 8, 2016 - Jan 14, 2017, Solo Show * \\"MAMI\\", Knockdown Center, Maspeth, NY 2016 Group Exhibition * \\"Race&Revolution;\\", Governors Island, NY 2016 Group Exhibition * \\"The Future Is Forever\\", International Center of Photography, Mana Contemporary Art Center Jersey City, NJ 2015 Group Exhibition  References   External links  * http://nonafaustine.virb.com/home Year of birth missing (living people) Living people American photographers School of Visual Arts alumni ","title":"Nona Faustine"},{"id":"53382046","text":"Shrawardine railway station was a station in Shrawardine, Shropshire, England.

The main portion of the house, built about 1813, is a particularly fine example of Greek Revival architecture. The house is owned by the Winchester Historical Society, and has displays of 19th-century artifacts relating to local manufacturing business and the American Civil War, and it also hosts the local fire museum. It is open by appointment. Description and history The Solomon Rockwell House is located northwest of downtown Winsted, at the southwest corner of Lake and Prospect Streets, on a rise overlooking the Mad River. The main house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A series of ells extend to its left side, ending in a small carriage barn. One of these ells is an older house, built in the mid-18th century. The main block is distinguished by a Greek Revival temple portico with two-story columns. The house achieved much of its present appearance in 1813, when the main block and carriage barn were built. This design was the work of William Swift, an early Connecticut architect. Solomon Rockwell, for whom it was built, owned two iron forges in town. The house passed to the historical society in the 1920s, and has served as a museum since then.

In 1936, Snead enrolled at the Amédée Ozenfant's academy, Ozenfant Academy of Fine Arts in London. In 1939, Snead immigrated to the United States where she met many other surrealist émigrés. In 1940, Snead traveled by bus to Los Angeles where she was inspired by the landscape and indigenous cultures of the American West and Southwest. Snead moved to Taos, New Mexico in 1946 where she lived in an adobe structure. There, she observed American Native processions and dances. Stella Snead's paintings show her fascination with the \\"earth's most powerful phenomena, including tornadoes, geysers, and volcanoes,\\" revealed by her \\"paintings of animals and humans performing ritualistic movements in anthropomorphic landscapes.\\" One of her better known paintings is Ecstatic Cow (1943). Snead had a solo show in 1941 at Gallery 10 in New York, and shows at Bonestall Gallery in 1945, the Arcade Gallery in London (1945), and at E.L.T. Mesens's London Gallery (1950). In 1949, her work was shown at the Carnegie International Exhibition in Pittsburgh. \\"Wider recognition returned to Snead in 2005, when her work was included in Surrealism USA, a major exhibition of American Surrealism at the National Academy Museum in New York, followed by subsequent exhibitions at the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and several important gallery exhibitions of Surrealism.\\" Snead moved to India in the 1950s where she began working as a photographer. Snead is noted for the eight books of photography she published, including Shiva's Pigeons: An Experience of India (1972), Beach Patterns: The World of Sea and Sand (1975), and Animals in Four Worlds: Sculptures from India (1989). These were based on various extended trips to India in the 1960s, where she shot imagery of Hindu sculpture, Indian nature and street life in India’s urban centers. Snead spent most of her adult life moving between New York City, London, Taos, New Mexico, and India. In 1971, she settled on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, remaining there until her death. Snead died on March 18, 2006, at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan, New York. According to Snead’s art dealer Pavel Zoubok, Snead died of natural causes. She left no immediate survivors upon her death. Early life Snead was born in London, England on April 2, 1910 to Ethel May Snead and Clarence Fredrick Heron Snead. In her autobiography, Snead claims that her parents' relationship was troubled due to what she deemed “dark moods” exhibited by her father. Such moods were a contributing factor in Stella and Ethel May’s exodus from the family home in 1915. Snead's parents decided Stella would be a life-vegetarian and not properly vaccinated in order not to \\"contaminate\\" her blood. Her father began to resent her mother's love, time, and attention she had for her as a child. Her father's meanness towards her mother increased. Her father named Stella Snead Magdalene and registered her as such, but her mother's choice was Stella, which she adopted later on, while Magdalene was used as her middle name. Snead attended a variety of small village schools in England as a child, before attending a progressive theosophical school, St. Christopher’s, Letchworth. She then took a secretarial course, but never truly employed its benefits, as depressive tendencies kept her from holding a daily work schedule. In 1928, Snead moved from Leicester to Sutton, Surrey. In 1936, Snead joined her only artists friend on the Spanish island of Teneriffe where they painted flowers in a private garden. For the rest of the summer, Snead painted in her bedroom, to her mother's disturbance since she was not exercising and isolating herself from friends. Painting career Out of work due to mental illness, Snead’s mother supported her until she became transfixed by the notion of painting in her early twenties. Snead originally became interested in painting after a trip to the Spanish island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The friend she traveled with painted in the gardens, and after watching her, Snead was inspired to make her own paintings. After three years of independent study, Snead became a student at the Ozenfant Academy of Fine Art in London, England. She studied there under the renowned French abstract artist Amédée Ozenfant and alongside fellow student and friend Leonora Carrington. After Ozenfant moved to New York to open up the Ozenfant School of Fine Arts in New York, Snead moved to New York in 1939, studying under him until 1941. The declaration of World War II in Europe spurred Snead’s move from London, England to the United States. In 1939, Snead arrived in New York, but remained only briefly, preferring to travel around the country, often hitching a ride on mail trucks. She lived for several years in Taos, New Mexico. Starting with garden scenes, Snead progressed toward a surrealist style, and frequently featured nocturnal scenes punctuated by semi- human and mystical creatures. Snead claims to have painted her first Surrealist painting in 1941 for a solo exhibition of her paintings. She did this having known Max Ernst, a prominent Surrealist, would come to her show. In 1942, Snead took a Greyhound bus to Hollywood where she started painting things that she saw around her. Snead first visited Mexico in 1944, to see the newly-erupted volcano, Paracutín, though by this time it was dormant. Snead returned to New York later that year with many paintings. Since 1943, her work had focused on fantasy, with animals represented rather more often than people, for example, The Sulky Lion, which was very two-dimensional, with the background buildings out of scale, and Tiger in the Sky, which was similar, but more three-dimensional. After her return to London, Snead endured the break-up of a romantic relationship, which triggered the depressive spell that would end her work as a painter until the late 1980s, when she would endeavor to recreate some of her lost works. Many works were lost, stolen or destroyed, and Snead worked to either locate missing works or repaint them from photographs of the works that were taken in the 1940s. She had her last solo exhibition of paintings in 1950 at The London Gallery in England until 1999's exhibition \\"Rediscovery: The Paintings of Stella Snead\\" at CFM Gallery in New York. The catalog for this show had articles by Neil Zukerman, Whitney Chadwick, Saloman Grimberg, Stephen Robeson-Miller and Pavel Zoubok as well as text by Snead and included a comprehensive timeline of her painting career, childhood, and personal struggles. Snead's last painting was done in 1995, which was a postcard that she \\"surrealized\\" that she named \\"Signals from the Grotto.\\" She claimed that she liked that piece better than anything she produced since 1987. The piece was shown at a show arranged by Robert Metzger at the Aldrich Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut, in December 1985. Photography career During Snead’s extensive hiatus from painting, she utilized photography as a creative outlet, photographing the world around her during her travels after World War II. A large portion of Snead’s photography was inspired by her multiple trips to the Indian subcontinent in the 1960s. Snead lived in India from 1960 until 1971, having moved there after her mother died from a blood clot. Here, her eye for surrealism would manifest in interpretations of Indian monuments and landscapes. Her photography would be published in collections such as Ruins in Jungles (1962), Animals in Four Worlds: Sculptures from India, and Shiva’s Pigeons: an Experience of India. Later, Snead would use some of these photos to create collages, and would publish a collection entitled Can Drowning Be Fun? A Nonsense Book. In the mid-1950s, Snead's photographic activities took off. Snead learned to print her photographs and began doing her own darkroom work. Snead lived in India from 1960 to 1971, in 1971 she moved back to New York with all her paintings except Rio Grande, which was damaged.

As a child, she attended weekly art lessons under Miss Alida Goodwin, a teacher at South Division High School and All Saints Cathedral Institute, where Emily later graduated. She simultaneously received private painting lessons from her father. These experiences combined provided her with a unique early education compared to the primarily German-speaking community of artists in the area. She attended the Art Institute of Chicago with John Vanderpoel, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and participated in the Art Student's League in New York with Birge Harrison.  Artistic career  Emily Parker Groom became a faculty member at Milwaukee Downer College as an art teacher, where she was eventually asked to create an art department in 1902. She took a break from teaching from 1917-1945, in order to focus on her painting. She built a studio named \\"Windover\\" in 1917 with her sister Mary Groom in Genesee, Wisconsin. She participated in the Public Works Art Project, created by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1933, as a planner and an exhibiting artist.

It is in the Amazon biome, and is mostly covered in forest. A number of different ethnic groups live in the territory, often related through marriage, with a total population of over 25,000. There is a long history of colonial exploitation and effective slavery of the indigenous people, and then of attempts to suppress their culture and \\"civilize\\" them. The campaign to gain autonomy culminated in creation of the reserve in 1998. The people are generally literate, but health infrastructure is poor and there are very limited economic opportunities. Location The Alto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory is in the northwest of the state of Amazonas. It has an area of . It is divided between the municipalities of Japurá and São Gabriel da Cachoeira, and covers 68% of the latter municipality. It borders Colombia to the north and west. To the south the territory adjoins the Rio Apapóris and the Médio Rio Negro I indigenous territories. To the east it adjoins the Cué-cué/Marabitanas Indigenous Territory. Other indigenous territories in the Alto Rio Negro region are the Médio Rio Negro II, Balaio and Rio Tea. Together the territories cover more than of the municipalities of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Santa Isabel do Rio Negro, Barcelos and Japurá. As of 2016 all had been homologated by the federal government apart from Cué-Cué / Marabitanas, which had only been declared. The Alto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory is 96.24% in the Rio Negro basin and 3.6% in the Japurá River basin. The Rio Negro defines the southwest boundary. Major tributaries of the Rio Negro in the reserve include the Xié, Içana and Uaupés rivers. The Tiquié River is an important tributary of the Uapés. History =Colonial era= From the mid-17th century there was a growing shortage of indigenous labor in the lower Amazon, in part due to smallpox epidemics, and settlers began raiding the upper Amazon and the Rio Negro to capture slaves, massacring those who resisted. The Portuguese reached the upper Rio Negro in the first half of the 18th century and its main tributaries such as Uaupés, Içana and Xié. The Carmelites set up settlements on the Upper Rio Negro near the present city of São Gabriel da Cachoeira. It is estimated that in this period 20,000 Indians were captured to work on the farms of Belém and São Luís, Maranhão. Woven straw shield from the Uaupés River, before 1861 In the second half of the 18th century the Portuguese government under the Marquis of Pombal removed the secular power of the missionaries, replacing them by civil or military authorities, and raised the more prosperous settlements to the status of villages or cities with Portuguese names, usually that of a saint. The years that followed saw growing military control of the region, forced labor for colonists and missionaries, depopulation due to forced migration and epidemics, occasional violent revolts and a variety of religious movements. Many of the indigenous people moved to the less accessible upper courses of the rivers. =20th century= In the 20th century there was steady decline in extractive exploitation. Missionary centers were established among the indigenous people, and provided a measure of protection against the traders. North American evangelical missionaries of the New Tribes Mission led by Sophie Muller entered the region in the 1940s. The Salesian (Catholic) missions continued to provide most of the infrastructure of sanitation, education and commerce. In the 1970s the federal government launched the National Integration Plan to integrate the Amazon region with the rest of the country, and FUNAI posts were installed in the Upper Rio Negro region. Army frontier units were also moved into the region. A gold rush invaded the Serra do Traíra and the upper Içana region in the 1980s causing rapid growth of São Gabriel, which doubled in size in less than ten years. Another factor in the growth of São Gabriel was that families moved to the city during the school year due to the closure of the missionary boarding schools. A move by indigenous groups to regain control of their traditional territories developed in the 1990s. =Creation of the territory= Identification of the Alto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory began with ordinance 1.892/E of 19 June 1985. The Federation of Indigenous Organizations of the Upper Rio Negro (FOIRN) was created in 1987, with headquarters in São Gabriel da Cachoeira. Its goals are to obtain self-determination of peoples, defense and guarantee of indigenous lands, recovery of appreciation of indigenous culture, support for economic and social subsistence, and coordination with local and regional organizations. The identification of the territory was submitted to the Ministry of Justice on 28 April 1993. Homologation of the Alto Rio Negro reserves was the main contribution to indigenous people by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso government of 1995–2003. Demarcation was undertaken between December 1995 and May 1996 coordinated by the Environment Ministry, with funding from a group of industrialized countries led by Germany. The work was coordinated by the FOIRN and the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), and involved most of the 600 communities of the region. The Alto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory was declared by decree 301 of 17 May 1996. It was homologated by decree of 15 April 1998. Creation of an indigenous territory with 22 different ethnic groups was justified in part by their practice of linguistic exogamy. People =Ethnic groups= Fishing near Tunuí do Içana The majority of people in the Alto Rio Negro region are indigenous, despite forced migrations in the past to the Lower Rio Negro or to the cities of Manaus and Belém. The municipality of São Gabriel da Cachoeira has 37,896 people, of whom 29,017 are indigenous. It is one of the only municipalities in Brazil that has two official languages other than Portuguese, namely Tucano and Baniwa. In January 2009 a Tariana mayor and Baniwa deputy mayor took office in São Gabriel. ISA estimated that there were 14,599 people in the Alto Rio Negro Territory as of 1996. According to Siasi/Sesai (Secretaria Especial de Saúde Indígena) this had risen to 21,291 by 2008 and to 26,046 by 2013. Indigenous people include Arapaso, Bará, Barasana, Desana, Carapanã, Kotiria, Cubeo, Macuna, Mirity-tapuya, Pira-tapuya, Siriano, Tucano and Tuyuka of the Tucanoan languages group, Baniwa, Baré, Koripako, Tariana, Warekena of the Arawakan languages group and Hupda and Yuhupde of the Nadahup languages group. The Eastern Tucano live along the Uaupés River and its tributaries, and the Pira Paraná River in Colombia. The Arawak and Tariano live along the upper Rio Negro, Xié, Uaupés and Içana rivers and their tributaries. The Hupdah, Yuhup, Dâw, and Nadêb are semi-nomadic hunters and gatherers who live in the inaccessible inter-fluvial areas. =Socioeconomic factors= According to the 2010 census by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics the territory had 15,183 indigenous inhabitants and just 102 non-indigenous people. Among the indigenous people, 48.1% were women and 51.9% men. Most of the inhabitants of the territory are literate. Of the 11,140 people over ten years old in 2010, 8,366 were literate and 2,774 illiterate. There were 9,242 people over the age of ten considered to be without income, with most others earning less than half the minimum wage. The residents have limited access to health services and economic alternatives. Some efforts have been made to introduce new sources of sustainable income. Thus in April 2015 the Indigenous Organization of the Içana Basin (Oibi) inaugurated two Baniwa Pepper Houses, places for production, packaging and storage of the traditional Jiquitaia pepper, a \\"flour\\" of peppers with salt that carries a great range of varieties from the Baniwa women's gardens. In October 2016 ISA reported a growing problem with malaria in the territory. Indigenous people who travelled to urban areas to collect social benefit such as Bolsa Família were becoming infected and carrying the disease back to their communities. The health services in these communities were not able to quickly diagnose and treat the disease, causing rapid spread in areas that had formerly been unaffected. =Organizations= 74 indigenous organizations have been registered in the region. There are Brazilian customs posts at Iauaretê, Querari, São Joaquim, Pari-Cachoeira and Tunuí. FUNAI has posts at Foz do Rio Içana, Foz do Rio Uaupés, Foz do Rio Xié, Melo Franco and Tunuê Cachoeira. There are two Catholic (Salesian) missions at Santa Izabel do Rio Negro and Içana, and an evangelical mission of the New Tribes Mission. The region, located where Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela meet, is of considered to be of strategic importance by Brazil, which has six army platoons located at key points. Environment Içana River The Alto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory is in the Amazon biome. The territory has blackwater rivers with low levels of fish, sandy and relatively infertile soil. The lack of nutrients in the waters of the Rio Negro and its tributaries means that the fish obtain most of their diet from organic matter from the margin of the river, including insects, fruits, flowers and seeds. Although there are some large species, there are many smaller species, each with low numbers of individuals. The forest vegetation is 26.94% campinarana, 71.4% campinarana-rainforest contact, 0.78% open rainforest and 0.89% closed rainforest. As of 2000 had been deforested. This had risen to by 2014, with little deforestation towards the end of this period. In the late 1990s the National Department of Mineral Production (DNPM) reported 451 formal mining concessions in the territory covering 38% of the area. The main threat comes from informal garimpeiro mineral prospectors.

The island is the one of the seven Philippine Turtle Islands. Geography The island is at the very edge of the international treaty limits separating the Philippines from Malaysia. Indeed, the island itself is referred to in the international border treaty concluded in 1930 between the United States (in respect of its then overseas territory, the Philippine Archipelago) and the United Kingdom (in respect of its then protectorate, the State of North Borneo). That treaty sets the international frontier as running in a straight line between Little Bakkungaan Island and Great Bakkungaan Island. Little Bakkungaan Island is one of the three Malaysian Turtle Islands and less than 2km of water separate the two islands. This makes Great Bakkungaan Island the internationally recognized Philippine territory that is closest to Malaysian territory.

By 2007, according to then Governor Sahali, his children were preparing to submit their application to have their ownership of the island registered.

The complex houses several government departments: Development, Labour, Social Security, and Ecological Transition. It is located in the block delimited by the Paseo de la Castellana, the Raimundo Fernández Villaverde street, Agustín de Betancourt street and the San Juan de la Cruz square. The original project was the work of the architect Secundino Zuazo Ugalde and was soon sponsored by the then Minister of Public Works, Indalecio Prieto. Its construction began in 1933 and, although it was paralyzed during the Civil War, the entire complex was completed in 1942. It currently houses the headquarters of the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Public Works, among others. The entire architectural complex is integrated into the so-called AZCA center, one of the most important business centers and offices in the capital. In the vicinity is also the Nuevos Ministerios station, a multiple exchanger with services of Bus, Metro and Cercanías. The building is used in the third and fourth seasons of the series Money Heist (La Casa de Papel in Spanish), in which it is being used as the Bank of Spain. History =Background= During the 1920s, Madrid had surpassed one million inhabitants (with about 800,000 at the beginning of the decade) and the city grew at a good pace (the expansion was almost entirely built as suburbs arose on the suburbs without order or concert). At the end of the decade, and in order to growth and solve the nascent traffic problems, the City Council convened an International Competition for the Ordination of Madrid in 1929, which did not materialize. One of the plans presented had been drawn up by the Spanish architect Secundino Zuazo and the German urbanist Hermann Jansen. Shortly after the proclamation of the Republic, the City Council required the City Planning Office to expand the city. The office prepared it in a very short time, based on the proposals of Zuazo and Hansen. The Government of the Republic considered as a priority the modernization of Madrid and, in 1932, it approved the Capitality Act of Madrid. A year later, the Ministry of Government approved the General Expansion Project, taking almost the entire Municipal Office project. The fundamental point of the project was to achieve the expansion of the city to the north, around the Paseo de la Castellana. As part of this purpose, the old racecourse, which was an obstacle to the planning of Paseo de la Castellana, was demolished. Another important milestone of the project was the construction of rail links between the stations in Madrid. Again Zuazo, this time as a member of the Railways Commission of the Ministry of Public Works, played a relevant role, in charge of convincing Minister Prieto of the inconvenience of placing the Ministry of the Interior in the center of Madrid (in Callao) And to build the rail link between the stations of the North and Atocha, under the Gran Vía, due to the great congestion that would occur in the center of Madrid. Thus, on the site left empty by the demolition of the racecourse, the government of the Republic projected, as early as 1932, the construction of a complex in which to locate the ministerial departments, while building an underground rail link between Atocha-Cercanías and A new plant in the north, Chamartín, which would be built by the engineer Eduardo Torroja and popularly called the \\"tunnel of the laughter\\". =Project and construction= The idea of constructing the New Ministries had been the work of Indalecio Prieto, Minister of Public Works. However, this idea had already been raised by Zuazo in his \\"Prolongation Project of Castellana\\" in 1930, so Prieto commissioned the construction of what would be the New Ministries, to house the ministries of Public Works and Government. After the demolition of the racecourse, the first stone was laid on April 15, 1933. Zuazo took the Escorial as an inspiration for the project. However, at the beginning of the Civil War, the New Ministries were unfinished, and the persecution suffered by Zuazo at the end of the war, during which he had been exiled in France, prevented him from continuing with the project. This was finalized by a team of architects related to the new regime, which eliminated or modified important parts of the project, such as the skyscraper planned for the north side. The work was finally completed in 1942, although the Ministry of Public Works and Urban Planning (MOPU) did not move there until 1958. =Nowadays= Arcade belonging to the East side of the complex. Nuevos Ministerios currently houses the headquarters of the Ministry of Public Works, Employment and Social Security, as well as the Ministry of Ecological Transition. The complex is fully integrated into the Castellana and the AZCA Complex, one of the most important business centers and offices in the Spanish capital. From the exchanger of the Nuevos Ministerios Station you can reach the government complex, through Cercanías (Lines C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-7, C- , Metro (Lines 6, 8 and 10) and Madrid Buses (Lines 7, 14, 27, 40, 126, 147, 150, C1 and C2). Characteristics The current aspect of the whole retains much of the original form and style of the project, in which the echoes of the Monastery of El Escorial (in whose maintenance Zuazo worked) and the House of Flowers (an earlier work by Zuazo). The complex consists of a large central space with open spaces, fountains and ponds, around which different ministries are arranged, as well as a large arcade on the side facing Paseo de la Castellana. The archery is one of the most characteristic elements of the whole. Underneath the patio was excavated the one that at the moment is the station of Nuevos Ministerios.

She attended Columbia University in the City of New York from 2012 to 2014, where she received a Master of Fine Arts (Fine and Studio Arts), and graduated with Honors. She was a teaching assistant for the majority of her time at Columbia, teaching both graduate and undergraduate classes in sculpture and 3D building.  Work  Council works primarily in sculpture, textiles, print-based media and performance art. Her work has been commissioned and exhibited through the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the Studio Museum in Harlem, Williams College Museum of Art, Southampton Historical Museum and Kianga Ellis Projects among others. She completed a residency at MANA BSMT in 2016, and recently participated in the collective, Black Women Artists for Black Lives Matter.  Art  Council’s art reflects the complex relationships of cultural and individual identities by immersing the viewer in a “sensory experience”. She draws on inspiration from Americana, physical beauty, and consumerism, juxtaposing her own materials with mass-produced objects. = Notable Exhibits =  Flo-Jo World Record Nails (2012)  Medium: 2000 acrylic fake fingernails, nail polish, rhinestones, metal, wood 60 in x 40 in x 22 in This piece incorporates replica acrylic fingernails in the shape of a 200m running track (at 1:100 scale), inspired by the nails Florence Griffith Joyner wore during the 1988 Summer Olympics, when she set the 200m world record. Council explores themes of feminism, beauty, and consumerism in this piece, identifying the contradictory ties black women have to physical beauty, spending large sums of money on beauty products while earning .67 cents to every dollar white men earn. Council’s art uses humor, style, and grace to create a dialogue with the viewer. Speaking of histories, oppression, and power, her art communicates through gentleness rather than aggression, and is in her words, always “mad exuberant”.  BLAXIDERMY/Uncle Ho (2012)  Medium: Acrylic false fingernails, French Pink color nail polish, styrofoam, gobs of glue 42 in x 32 in x 13 in Council explains her BLAXIDERMY work as concerning beauty, industry, and the movement of bodies: > “Blaxidermy is a word I use that combines taxidermy and an idea of > blaxploitation. In the series, I used beauty supply products and a lot of > sculptural elements that referred to the body. Like blaxploitation, I hope > it’s somewhere in the space between comical, outrageous, horrific, and > enlightening.

Orleanu (November 20, 1859-January 31, 1942) was a Romanian magistrate and politician. Orleanu's family were originally Ottoman Greeks of Phanariote descent who entered the Wallachian boyar class.Constantin Iordachi, \\"From Imperial Entanglements to National Disentanglement: The 'Greek Question' in Moldavia and Wallachia, 1611-1863\\", in Roumen Dontchev Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov (eds.), Entangled Histories of the Balkans, vol. I, pp. 138-39. Leiden: Brill, 2013. Wealthy people, they settled in Buzău County and then Focșani, where Orleanu was born, ultimately moving to Galați. He graduated from the private Institutele Academice in Iași in 1876. Orleanu then studied law at the University of Paris, obtaining a doctorate in 1881. His thesis, published the following year, deals with illegitimate children in Roman law, and is his chief written work. After returning home, he entered the magistracy, holding a series of posts: prosecutor at the Iași tribunal (1882), then in Bucharest, judge at the Putna County tribunal (1882), president of the Dorohoi tribunal (1883), followed by Râmnicu Sărat (1884), prosecutor at the Galați appeals court (1887-1889). He retired from the judicial system in 1889, entering politics and joining the National Liberal Party (PNL). First elected to the Assembly of Deputies in 1895, he was returned for a number of terms. A fervent supporter of industrialization, from November 1909 to December 1910, he served as Minister of Industry and Commerce under Ion I. C. Brătianu. He authored the 1909 law restricting the right of some 160,000 state employees to unionize and strike; this was called the Orleanu Law or, by its socialist adversaries, the \\"wicked law\\".Dinu C. Giurescu, Dicționar biografic de istorie a României, p. 416. Bucharest: Editura Meronia, 2008. Orleanu served as Assembly President for a fairly lengthy term, April 1922 to March 1926. The early part of this period was marked by debate on what would become the 1923 Constitution, which was adopted by the PNL majority in spite of strong opposition. Additionally, the Assembly adopted a series of laws meant to ensure the political, administrative and economic unification of the new Greater Romania. Among these were laws on the organization of the Romanian Army, the judicial system, mines, energy, primary and normal schools, repression of offenses against public order (the anti-communist 1924 Mârzescu Law), founding the Romanian Patriarchate and restructuring the Romanian Orthodox Church. He took part in the Crown Council meeting held at Sinaia on the last day of 1925, where a debate was held regarding Prince Carol's decision to renounce his rights to the throne. Days later, the Assembly, presided by Orleanu, together with the Senate, meeting as a constituent assembly, took note of Carol's decision, proclaimed Michael as heir and established a regency. Also in 1926, a law establishing an electoral bonus was passed. In 1927, Orleanu became a senator by right. He died in Galați. Orleanu was married to Valentina Gheorghiadi. The couple had two sons and two daughters; one of the latter, also called Valentina, married Victor Slăvescu.Mihai Sorin Rǎdulescu, Elita liberală românească, 1866-1900, p. 112.

The Gishes led The Mountain Eagle in covering controversial topics such as the effects of strip mining on the Appalachian environment and political corruption. Under the Gishes' guidance, The Mountain Eagle became a prominent rural newspaper, and the pair won many awards for their journalism. Gish also founded the Eastern Kentucky Housing Development Corporation and worked to improve living conditions in Eastern Kentucky. Early life and education Gish was born Patricia Ann Burnett in Paris, Kentucky, to Georgia and Elmer Burnett. She began working in journalism early; she had her first job at age thirteen working as a proof reader for a small Paris newspaper. Gish later moved to Lexington, Kentucky and graduated from Lafayette High School and later studied journalism at the University of Kentucky. While in college, Gish worked with her campus newspaper The Kentucky Kernel and met her future husband, Tom. She also worked part-time as a proofreader for the Lexington Leader, which merged into the Lexington Herald- Leader in 1984, and later was promoted to assignment reporter. She married Tom Gish in Lexington in 1948 and graduated from college in 1949. In 1970, Gish acquired a Masters of Science in Community Development from the University of Louisville. The Mountain Eagle Pat and Tom Gish bought The Mountain Eagle from Pearl and Martha Nolan in November 1956 and took over editing the paper, and published their first issue on January 1, 1957. They changed the paper's motto from \\"A Friendly Non-Partisan Weekly Newspaper Published Every Thursday,\\" to \\"It Screams.\\" Under their leadership, The Mountain Eagle for the first time reported on the inner workings of the Letcher County government, which often caused controversy within the community and friction between the paper and city government officials. They covered controversial regional issues, such as meetings of the local school board and fiscal court which were previously held behind closed doors, strip mining, and mine safety abuses in the Appalachian coal industry. They also covered stories on a wide range of problems, including corruption, poor education, inadequate housing and poverty, though Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues, said they were protective of their readers' dignity, refusing to run photos of poor people. Their work reached both a regional and national audience, leading to changes in legislation and inspiring journalists and activists who supported The War on Poverty and increased environmental awareness. The Gishes' work often caused controversy within their community, prompting reactions from the public such as advertising boycotts and, in August 1974, a firebombing of their publication facilities. It was discovered that a local police officer paid to have the building burned after The Mountain Eagle published an article addressing unfair treatment of local youths by the Letcher County police. Tom Gish also reported that he believed a local coal company contributed funds to the arson as well. In reaction to this incident, the Gishes changed the motto of the paper from \\"It Screams\\" to \\"It Still Screams.\\" The couple was also notable for publishing the works of opinion columnists, especially women opinion columnists, from other communities in Eastern Kentucky, including the writing of Mabel Kiser, Thelma Cornett, Siller Brown, Sarah Ison, Elsie Banks, and Gaynell Begley. Although the couple worked as a team, Tom freely admitted that \\"without Pat, The Mountain Eagle would have gone under long ago.\\" Within The Mountain Eagle, Pat did most of the reporting, editing, and business aspects of the company. In addition to this work, she also was the \\"founder and director of a federally funded affordable housing initiative\\" \\" This additional job required Pat to drive to Louisville on the weekends for two years to earn her Master's degree. On top of all that, Pat also was a full-time mother of five children. As stated by Mike Clark, a former Eagle staffer, she was the \\"best multi-tasking saint of an editor, housing expert, wife and mother I have ever known...How Pat balanced all those roles without sleep or peace or rest is beyond me.\\" Pat and Tom were highly praised and respected for reporting \\"the real news, regardless of whether it was either profitable or popular — and despite considerable risk to both life and livelihood.\\" Throughout their career in journalism, the duo worked hand in hand to publish accurate and trustworthy news, \\"regardless of the consequences.\\" Eastern Kentucky Housing Development Corporation In 1968, Pat Gish founded the Eastern Kentucky Housing Corp. The program was responsible for the implementation of programs that served to alleviate the struggles of low income families in Eastern Kentucky and Appalachia, as well as the construction of low income housing throughout the region. Pat even partnered with Yale Architecture School, employing students to help design housing affordable for the natural difficulties of Eastern Kentucky's landscape. The organization made use of funding from the Office of Economic Opportunity, Department of Agriculture, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and Department of Labor funds.\\"Statement of Pat B. Gish, Director of Eastern Kentucky Housing Development Corporation\\", United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, October 6, 1970 However, in the 1980s the federal support of these housing programs was heavily reduced. With this new development, Pat decided to oversee the merger of the EKHCDH and another similar organization, allowing her to return to a full-time position at The Eagle. Later life and death In 2001, Pat's son Ben Gish took over as editor of The Mountain Eagle, due to the declining health of Pat and Tom. Gish was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in the early 2000s. She succumbed to complications from Alzheimer's on April 13, 2014. Awards and recognition In 1983, Pat and Tom received the Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award for \\"outstanding community leadership.\\" In 1985, the Gishes were acknowledged jointly in Newsweek magazine as two of its \\"100 American Heroes\\".\\"Home of the Brave: A Hundred Heroes for Our Time,\\" Newsweek, Summer 1986 (Special Edition). In 1986, the Gishes were inducted into the Mountain Heritage Hall of Fame and the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. In 1987, the Gishes received the Environmental Policy Institute award for their work in promoting the environmental rights of the Appalachian region. In 1991, the Ralph Nader organization awarded the Gishes with the Joe A. Calloway Award for Civic Service. In 1993, the Lexington Herald-Leader awarded the Gishes with the Edwards M. Templin Award for Community Service. The couple also donated land for a community park. The University of Kentucky Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues instituted the Tom and Pat Gish Award in honor of the pair. The award is to be given to \\"rural journalists who demonstrate courage, tenacity and integrity often needed to render public service through journalism\\". The Gishes were the first recipients of the award on Feb. 28, 2005.

Art Work  “Memory of Vagina” is one piece of art which targeting on the patriarchy society. Using a gun to describe the patriarchy society and visualized the damage to women from the community. This work is an example of how the invisible violence from the community has been materialized in the modern art. \\"I am 5 Years old\\" this performance piece was based on the story of a 5 year old girl who was sexually assaulted by her father. Li put a razor blade into her mouth, and began to tell the story of the little girl. Li was unable to speak clearly with the blade in her mouth, with every word the blade made a cut. This performance was painful. Which represents how painful it was for the young girl to talk about the abuse and how talking about it brought her more suffering. \\"Free\\" Li stands in front of an audience and have them put clips all over her body. She then commands them to \\"pull\\", the audience pulls and all the clips release from her body. Li experience great pain, but her body is released.  Barriers  Even though Xinmo Li's art work has been accepted by many Western country, the impact of her idea and art has not been promoted to the public domestically. The conflicts between traditional Chinese culture and performance art have natively affect many feminist arts in China. Most feminists who use modern art to propose their idea to protect the rights for women are not accepted by the public.

Her sculpture often includes assembled statues of female figures created with their heads/ faces painted black and a wide range of attached objects flowing outward including fabric, keys, found objects, and toy weapons. German serves as an activist addressing problems such as gun violence and prostitution. Her work is held in numerous permanent collections including the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation and the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and has been reviewed by Sculpture and discussed in The New York Times, O, The Oprah Magazine, and on NPR's All Things Considered. Her art has been featured in a wide range of galleries, museums and traveling exhibits, including the 2012 \\"African American Art 1950–present\\" touring exhibit from the Smithsonian Institution. She was a 2015 recipient of the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Biennial Grant. She was the winner of the 2018 Don Tyson Prize, a biannual $200,000 award from the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. https://news.artnet.com/art-world/vanessa-german-crystal-bridges-prize-1423390 German uses her art to address hate in the world while also expressing hope for the future.  Early life  Vanessa German was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and raised in the Mid-City area of Los Angeles and Loveland, Ohio by her mother, a fiber artist, quilter and costume maker. She is the third of five children. She moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2000 and began to perform and exhibit her work locally. She describes her work as heavily influenced by her childhood in Los Angeles, where her mother encouraged the children to make their own clothes, and she was also impacted by the AIDS epidemic and drive-by shootings.  Artistic career  A self-taught artist, much of German's artwork is collage and sculpted assemblages. German's sculptural work frequently includes female figures that she calls \\"power figures\\" and \\"tar babies\\". She creates them by decorating and painting large dolls and figures, then sculpting outward, and adding a wide range of materials including, for example cowrie shell lips, plastic guns, feathers, bottle caps, seashells, toys, and vintage products. She often uses found and donated materials from her Homewood neighborhood. She describes discovering that her work included elements similar to the central African tradition of Nkisi nkondi, guardian statues pierced with nails and other materials. Her materials list for works often include both the physical (e.g. cloth, paint, keys) and non-tangible materials (e.g. \\"the names of all the dead boys that I know,\\" \\"tears\\"). Recurring themes addressed in her work include food, birds, violence, injustice, poverty, and Black Madonna imagery. In her artist statement for 2016's dontsaythatshitoutloud, she describes the impact of finding two men murdered outside her house within a four-month period. Her work includes the symbolic use of color throughout. Describing beads from one work, she said \\"If they’re red, they're holding rage and love simultaneously. If they’re white – they're holding ghosts – the presence of your ancestors ...and they're also holding forgiveness and peace.\\"  ARThouse and Love Front Porch  German also leads the ARThouse and Love Front Porch, a community art institution, in the Homewood neighborhood in Pittsburgh, PA. She started the ARThouse when she needed to create her art on her porch due to a low basement ceiling. When German began making large sculptures, she was heartbroken when pieces had to be taken apart to be removes from the basement. After moving to the porch, ARTHouse was born. https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/a27168640/vanessa-german-citizen-artist- pittsburgh-homewood/ Neighborhood children began gathering on her porch to watch her at work. This expanded into a dedicated community art space, which moved twice before moving into its permanent location, a house purchased with donations and proceeds from her art sales, dedicated in December 2015. In 2012, Love Front Porch received a $4,000 grant from the Sankofa Fund of Southwest Pennsylvania, which highlights empowering grass-roots African- American community projects. German also runs the Tuesday Night Monologue Project at ARThouse, a weekly event where guest artists and members of the community can write and share works with each other. https://pittnews.com/article/130369/arts-and-entertainment/tuesday-night- monologue-project-hones-their-craft-in-homewood/ Homewood was described as \\"The Most Dangerous Neighborhood in America\\" by MSNBC journalist, Rachel Maddow. German has said about Homewood, \\"...that doesn't happen every day. It doesn't happen every week. Most people aren't shooting each other. Most people are not running drugs. It's a very small percentage of the population who are engaging in really extreme activities.\\" https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/a27168640/vanessa-german-citizen-artist- pittsburgh-homewood/  Collections  German's work is held in the following permanent collections: * Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, AR. * American Visionary Art Museum.

He has published research about strategy, competitiveness and income inequality in the United States. In 2012, with his colleague Michael Porter, Rivkin suggested that American competitiveness could be restored if companies decided to avoid offshoring to save on hidden costs like \\"lower foreign worker productivity, quality problems, and loss of intellectual property\\"; invest in teaching employable skills to high school and college students to produce suitable workers; foster innovation by funding relevant university research; offer in-person or online training to their employees; and avoid lobbying for unfair tax breaks which distort the market. In 2015, Rivkin and Porter suggested that the 1% should foster shared prosperity by focusing not on philanthropy and political donations, but finding business-oriented ways to improve the commons (infrastructure, schools and universities, employment skills) at the local level. With his colleagues Joseph B. Fuller and Karen Mills, Rivkin argued that shared prosperity would entail the collective impact of leaders in \\"government, business, education, nonprofits, labor, philanthropy\\" and other sectors.

She studied at Bennington College in Bennington, Vermont but dropped out after her mother's death. Beck kept a diary, wrote poetry, and published two short stories before committing suicide in 1978. Her papers were selected for inclusion of the Smith College women and disabilities collection, as they provide insight into chronic illness and depression.  Early life and education  On April 8, 1924, Patricia Beck was born in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, New York, the third of four children. In 1933, Beck's mother remarried after her father's death in 1926, and from 1934–1938, the family relocated and lived in various locations around Europe. Beck was exposed to an idiosyncratic lifestyle through her mother's second marriage to the boxer, Paul George Swiderski. Beck, a Catholic, attended a convent school, was allowed only limited autonomy, and was not exposed to the typical peer culture of American middle-class high school students. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the family relocated back to the United States, where Beck finished her secondary education before enrolling at Bennington College. Beck began to study writing, art, and psychology at Bennington under Theodore Roethke, W. H. Auden, and Allan Seager. In 1945, she described a self- consciousness related to a friendship she had developed with a faculty member's wife. Depression played a role in the following year, when Beck's personal life interfered with her education and felt compelled to leave school, her mother having died from cancer during her freshman year. After a stay in the psychiatric unit at Albany Hospital, she spent some time in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, before returning to Bennington. Later instructors there included Bernard Malamud, with whose family she became close and whose daughter she taught to drive.  Career  Beck kept diaries from the age of fourteen until her death, and she wrote other works throughout her life. However, only two short stories, \\"A Promise in the Wind\\" and \\"Come Down to the Willow,\\" were published while she was living. A volume of her short stories, A Gift of Kindling and Other Stories, was published posthumously. Her papers – including correspondence, manuscripts, semi-autobiographical novels, poems, personal diaries, and notebooks – are held by Smith College in the Women and Disabilities section of the Sophia Smith Collection. Much of the work was unpublished during her lifetime and provides rare insight into chronic illness and depression. Bernard Malamud said that he felt Beck was not meant to be a writer. She used the hundreds of rejection letters she received from such magazines as The New Yorker and The Saturday Evening Post as wallpaper for her bathroom. Personal life On June 28, 1952, Beck married Thomas Maulding, a blind man, and moved to New York City before purchasing a home, \\"Birdland\\", in North Bennington, Vermont in 1954. In 1958, she became pregnant, but miscarried. The couple divorced after that. Beck remained in \\"Birdland\\" and returned to Bennington College and continued her studies. She was diagnosed with diabetes for most of her life, and between 1976–1977, both of her legs were amputated due to complications. She was treated with shock therapy as part of psychological treatment. On March 2, 1978, Beck died by suicide when she took an insulin overdose. She was 53 years old.

Emery was part of New York Governor Mario Cuomo's State Commission on Government Integrity in the late 1980s. He was also part of the part of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's Transition Committee for Government Reform Issues. He was a member of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct for 13 years until March, 2017.  Early life and education  Emery was born in Boston, Massachusetts on March 5, 1946. He received a B.A. from Brown University in 1967 and received a J.D., cum laude, in 1970 from Columbia University Law School, where he was named a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar. Following law school, he became a law clerk for Gus J. Solomon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon.  Career  After graduating from Columbia Law School, Emery moved to Washington and founded the Institutional Legal Services Project, a state- financed public-interest firm that represented people who were incarcerated in prisons, mental institutions and juvenile facilities. After directing the project for six years, he moved back to New York in 1977 and joined the New York Civil Liberties Union as a staff attorney and worked there for a decade. In 1987, Emery was offered a seat on Governor Mario Cuomo's State Commission on Government Integrity. He accepted the offer and resigned from New York Civil Liberties Union. The same year he became of counsel to Lankenau, Kovner & Bickford, and, thereafter, a partner, focusing on civil and civil rights cases at the firm. One of his most notable cases at the firm was a lawsuit charging that the Board of Estimate violated \\"one person, one vote,\\" by granting the Staten Island Borough President, who represented fewer than 400,000 people, the same power as the Brooklyn Borough President, who represented more than two million. In 1989, Emery won the case arguing in the U.S. Supreme Court and resulting in the unanimous invalidation of the Board on one person-one vote constitutional grounds. In 1996, Emery represented Laurance Rockefeller, Jr. and presidential candidate Steve Forbes in their bids to gain ballot access.

In November 2006, newly elected Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer appointed Emery to his Transition Committee for Government Reform Issues. After Spitzer resigned in March 2008, Governor David Paterson appointed Emery to the New York State Commission on Public Integrity. In 2010, Emery won a civil-rights lawsuit in over strip searches performed on nonviolent, low-level offenders at the Rikers Island jail facility. As a result of the lawsuit, the city agreed to pay out $33 million on behalf of more than 100,000 plaintiffs. Emery represented Roger Clemens' trainer in a defamation lawsuit about steroid use and Duke Lacrosse player Reade Seligmann in a civil suit for wrongful prosecution. Emery also represented Cooper Union in a suit to restore tuition-free education. Emery was appointed as the Chair of Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) in 2014 by the Mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio.

While the automation of manual labour has been contemplated since before the industrial revolution, the issue has received increased discussion in the 21st century due to newer developments such as machine learning. Assessments of the risk vary widely, with one study finding that 47% of the workforce is automatable in the United States, and another study finding that this figure is 9% across 21 OECD countries.Arntz, M., T. Gregory and U. Zierahn (2016), \\"The Risk of Automation for Jobs in OECD Countries: A Comparative Analysis\\", OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers, No. 189, OECD Publishing, Paris, https://doi.org/10.1787/5jlz9h56dvq7-en The idea of taxing companies for deploying robots is controversial with opponents arguing that such measures will stifle innovation and impede the economic growth that technology has consistently brought in the past. Proponents have pointed to the phenomenon of \\"income polarization\\" which threatens the jobs of low-income workers who lack the means to enter the knowledge-based fields in high demand.  Arguments for  Tax law professor Xavier Oberson has called for robots to be tax-compliant so that government spending can continue even as the pool of taxable income for human workers decreases. Oberson's proposals suggest taxing robot owners until robots themselves have the ability to pay, pending further advances in artificial intelligence. In a 2015 Reddit discussion, Stephen Hawking criticized machine owners for initiating a \\"lobby against wealth resdistribution\\". Following Elon Musk's statement that universal basic income should offset the employment effects of robots, Bill Gates gave an interview in favour of a robot tax. Mark Cuban announced his support for a robot tax in 2017, citing an essay by Quincy Larson about the accelerating pace of technological unemployment. Support for an automation tax by American politicians can be traced back to 1940 in which Joseph C. O'Mahoney tabled one such bill in the Senate. In 2017, San Francisco supervisor Jane Kim made these strategies the subject of a task force, stating that income disparity attributable to robots is widely visible in her district. In 2019, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio advocated for a robot tax during and after his presidential run. While crediting Andrew Yang for drawing attention to the issue, de Blasio stated that he had different policy goals and proposed making large corporations responsible for five years of income tax from jobs that are automated away. In 2017 in the UK, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a robot tax. Bank of England economist Andy Haldane has called the rise of automation \\"a regressive income tax on the unskilled\\".  Arguments against  Critics including Jim Stanford and Tshilidzi Marwala have discussed the futility of a robot tax given the malleability in the definition of \\"robot\\". In particular, autonomous elements are present in many 21st-century devices that are not normally considered robots. Economist Yanis Varoufakis has discussed the additional complication of determining how much a human worker would have hypothetically made in a labour sector that has been dominated by robots for decades. He has instead proposed a variation of universal basic income called the \\"universal basic dividend\\" to combat income polarization. Robotics companies including Savioke and the Advancing Automation trade group have fought robot taxes, calling them an \\"innovation penalty\\". ABB Group CEO Ulrich Spiesshofer compared taxing robots to taxing software, and pointed to the fact that countries with a low unemployment rate have a high automation rate. EU Commissioner Andrus Ansip rejected the idea of a robot tax, stating that any jurisdiction implementing one would become less competitive as technological companies are incentivized to move elsewhere. The 2019 World Development Report, prepared by Simeon Djankov and Federica Saliola of the World Bank, opposed a robot tax, arguing that it would result in reduced productivity and increased tax avoidance by large corporations and their shareholders.  Existing laws  On August 6, 2017, South Korea, under President Moon, passed what has been called the first robot tax. Rather than taxing entities directly, the law reduces tax breaks that were previously awarded to investments into robotics. A robot tax had previously been part of Mady Delvaux's bill imposing ethical standards for robots in the European Union. However, the European Parliament rejected this aspect when it voted on the law.

She makes intricate works on paper and canvas as well as large scale sculpture. Through a convergence of interest in anthropology, science fiction, black female subjectivity and women's work, her art explores the humor and fantasy involved in self-making within diasporic societies, which have an ability to live with cultural ambiguities and use them to build psychological and even metaphysical defenses against cultural invasions. In 2016 and 2017 she participated in group and solo museum exhibitions at the Tarble Arts Center, Eastern Illinois University, Charleston, IL, The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh, PA, the Museum of Latin American Art, Los Angeles, CA as part of the Getty's Pacific Standard Time's LA>LA exhibition, Spelman College Museum of Fine Art, Atlanta, GA, and with the Pinchuk Art Foundation's Future Generation's Art Prize exhibition at the 2017 Venice Biennale. Báez has held residencies at the Headlands Center for the Arts, The Joan Mitchell Center, The Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, The Lower East Side Print Shop, and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Workspace. Báez's work has been written about in The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, Art in America, New American Paintings, The Huffington Post, Studio Museum Magazine and is featured in the Phaidon contemporary drawing anthology Vitamin D2. Her work has been exhibited at the New Museum, New York, NY, the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Miami, FL, the New Orleans Biennial Prospect.3, New Orleans, LA, Taller Puertorriqueño, Philadelphia, PA, Ruth and Elmer Wellin Museum of Art, Clinton, NY, the Drawing Center, The Bronx Museum of the Arts, Bronx, NY and the Studio Museum, New York, NY. Her work was featured in the United States Biennial Prospect.3 in New Orleans, LA, curated by Franklin Sirmans. She has been the recipient of the prestigious Joan Mitchell Painters and Sculptors Award, the Jacques and Natasha Gelman Award in Painting, the Catherine Doctorow Prize for Contemporary Painting, and the Chiaro Award from the Headlands. In 2015 The Pérez Art Miami Museum published Firelei Báez: Bloodlines, with an introduction by the museum's Director, Franklin Sirmans, an essay by Assistant Curator María Elena Ortiz, an interview with Naima Keith and a contribution by writer Roxane Gay.  Early life and education  Born to a Dominican mother and a father of Haitian descent, the self-described \\"Caribbean hybrid\\" was raised in Dajabón, a market city on the Dominican Republic's border with Haiti. As a child, Báez recalls seeing the landscapes of both countries from her home, with views of Haiti's dying, deforested landscape standing in stark contrast to the verdant valleys and mountains of the Dominican Republic. Dividing the two countries is the Dajabón River, the site of the 1937 massacre of thousands of Haitians at the hands of Dominican President Rafael Trujillo's brutal regime. That landscape, which has long been a vivid symbol of the violent history between the two countries — which are again locked in a humanitarian crisis over Dominican attempts to deport thousands of Haitians — haunts Báez's work. At the age of 10, she relocated with her family to Miami. The move had a profound impact on her. In the Dominican Republic, Báez says, racial identity was much more complicated. But in the United States, those shades of gray were suddenly gone. > \\"There's a fluidity of color, of race, in the Caribbean,\\" she says. \\"In > America, you're black or white.\\" That didn't make race less fraught. Rather, it added another layer of \\"otherness\\" to Báez's understanding of herself. \\"As someone born in the DR but raised mostly in the United States, I am constantly navigating ways of articulating something that is familiar but also very distant,\\" she says. Báez received an M.F.A. from Hunter College and a B.F.A. from Cooper Union and studied at The Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. She has had solo exhibitions at the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art, Pérez Art Museum Miami, and the DePaul Art Museum.  Career  Báez's lush paintings often foreground female bodies and faces, incorporating imagery associated with various cultural symbols, from palm fronds and feathers to tufts of fur and intricate textile patterns. Rendered with the artist's precise touch, in acrylics and gouaches, her works coalesce to form powerful narratives around ancestry and cultural identity. Báez gained much-deserved exposure last fall with her solo museum shows “Patterns of Resistance” at the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art and “Bloodlines” at Perez Art Museum Miami. “I looked at the idea of ancestry in a way that extended beyond the physical bloodline to explore the idea of a lineage of resistance and self-definition, which is especially tricky when you’re the product of an ahistorical narrative, as many are from the African diaspora,” Báez says of the Miami show, an expanded iteration of which will travel on to other institutions including the Andy Warhol Museum. “I started incorporating the figure into my work as a way to navigate my own sense of identity, particularly because I came from a place that didn’t fit into one specific narrative. It was a way for me to untangle what I was going through on a daily basis.” MetFridays: Báez's participatory installation was displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art features artists leading participants in making a collaborative installation that's inspired by visitors to the museum's gift shop. Afterward, the installation remained on view through March 2016. The program was presented in conjunction with the exhibition “The Power of Prints: The Legacy of William M. Ivins and A. Hyatt Mayor. Aside from museum exhibitions, Báez has also held numerous residencies throughout the country. She has held residencies at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Workspace, The Lower East Side Print Shop, and The Bronx Museum’s Artist in the Marketplace. Additional residencies include Headlands Center for the Arts, Artist in Residence, Dieu Donné Paper Mill, Workspace Artist in Residence, and Wave Hill, Workspace Artist in Residence. Báez is currently represented by James Cohan Gallery and Kavi Gupta Gallery.

On their multicolored surfaces, various systems of symbols converge and are woven together, echoing the seemingly esoteric and illusory montage of our dreams.

Owned by the Roxbury Land Trust, it protects the site of a well-preserved 19th-century iron mine and furnace works. Several miles of trails provide access to abandoned quarry areas and the preserved remains of the iron works, whose uses are explained by informational panels. The preserve is open from dawn to dusk. The preserve was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history When Roxbury was first settled in the 18th century, the land form now known as Mine Hill was called Spruce Hill and was common land. Its stone outcrops were eventually recognized for their minerals, and a few attempts were made in the mid-18th century to extract gold, silver, and lead from the mountain. None of these efforts lasted more than a few years, but shafts dug into the hill survive from this period. In the early 19th century a geological analysis found the presence of carbonated iron ore, a rare and highly desirable form of ore that was probably unknown to the early miners. Disputes over land ownership delayed exploitation of the resource until 1865, when the Shepaug Spathic Iron and Steel Company purchased the hill and began to develop it. It set up a mining operation, with a railroad carrying ore to furnaces near the base of the hill, and built a small town for the workers. Mineral Spring Brook was dammed to create a reservoir that would provide a reliable water supply. Later in the 19th century, a granite quarry was also opened near the base of hill, its products transported by rail to market in New York City. The iron furnace and mining operation was closed in 1905, and the stone quarry closed in 1935. The preserve occupies north of Mine Hills Road in northwestern Roxbury. It occupies the eastern face of the eoponymous hill, whose summit and western portions are in neighboring New Milford. A parking area on Mine Hills Road provides access to the trails. There is a short (0.2 mile) loop leading to the area where the blast furnaces are located, and a longer 3.5-mile trail that loops through the areas where the 18th and 19th-century mining activities took place. A short 0.3-mmile trail provides access to the reservoir site.

Celender, who began producing art in the late 1960s, used surveys extensively in his work. He would send questionnaires to members of the public, academics, artists, politicians, museum officials, and other cohorts of people, often with outlandish or tongue-in-cheek suggestions or solicitations. The responses were then exhibited at the OK Harris Gallery in Manhattan, New York, where Celender had a show annually. Celender taught at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota, for over 40 years. Early life Don Celender was born in 1931 in Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania. He attended Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University, from which he graduated in 1956 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. He then attended the University of Pittsburgh, graduating in 1963 with a PhD in Art History. Career After obtaining his PhD, Celender worked in Washington, D.C., at the National Gallery of Art's education department. In 1964, he moved to Minnesota where he began teaching at Macalester College in Saint Paul. While teaching, Celender took an interest in conceptual art. As the movement was expanding in 1969, Celender began a project in which he wrote letters to various academics, politicians, philanthropists, figures in the media, and religious leaders. The letters contained impossible proposals for the addressees to implement, with the instruction that they write back to Celender explaining how they intended to realize his schemes. He received responses to some of his proposals; the Cleveland Museum of Art's director, Sherman Lee, responded to Celender's suggestion that 1,000 of Lee's museum's pieces of Asian art be airdropped across Alabama by saying that he had \\"mentally performed\\" the feat. Other letters, such as Celender's proposal to Alabama governor George Wallace that the state's white residents be painted black, the state's black residents be painted white, and that they all pose as Greek sculptures along the state's highways, went unreturned. Celender's work began to receive critical attention in the mid-1970s. He exhibited art each year from 1974 to 2004 at the OK Harris Gallery in SoHo, Manhattan. Ivan Karp, owner of the gallery, represented Celender. Celender's pieces often served to parody the self- seriousness and predictability of the world of fine art, and was deemed fun and witty for those reasons. In another letter-writing project, 1975's Museum Piece, he wrote to over 70 museums, soliciting photographs of their loading bays. The museums at Yale University and Princeton University would agree to the project only for a large donation while the Brooklyn Museum, described by art critic Dale Jamieson as itself as besieged by the community in which it is located\\", turned down Celender's solicitation on the grounds of \\"security reasons\\". In 1978, Celender produced Observations, Lamentations and Protestations of Museum Guards Throughout the World, a project described by Marc Fischer as \\"particularly ambitious\\". Celender mailed 1,200 surveys, many translated from English, to museum guards to solicit their feelings about their work, the artwork in the museums they protected, and their own relationships with art. Also in 1978, Celender created Destiny of a Name, a survey dealing with the notion that a person's name may determine their profession. Celender wrote to, among others, a psychologist with the surname Reveal, a dentist with the surname Toothman, and a colorectal surgeon named Butts. Although the responses to many of Celender's questionnaires were brief, his 1995 study Mortal Remains, a collaboration with Ricardo Bloch, resulted in lengthier responses. For Mortal Remains, Bloch and Celender asked 400 contemporary artists what they wished to happen to their bodies after death and whether they wished to bring anything with them to the resting place of their choosing. Personal life and death Don Celender was married to Ivy Celender from the late 1950s through 1995, when they divorced. Celender had one daughter, Catherine. He taught at Macalester College and headed its art department until January 2005, when he learned he had pancreatic cancer. Celender died on March 3, 2005, in Pittsburgh at the age of 73. Works alt=A black and white cover page featuring the book's title and images of two museum guards Max Kozloff wrote that Celender's lightheartedness as well as the straightforwardness of his projects and their messages made him \\"an exception in the art world\\". The majority of his art took the form of survey projects like Museum Piece, which Celender produced annually and exhibited at the OK Harris Gallery. The results of about half of Celender's surveys were bound into book form, printed in black and white on paper, though these books are difficult for members of the public to access and are not often found in secondary markets. The archive of the Arnolfini contains a sizable collection of Celender's pieces. Some of Celender's 35 exhibited works are listed below, and those that were bound into book form are indicated with a dagger (†).

She is known for her vibrant colors and ghoulish or macabre imagery. According to an article in Flaunt magazine: \\"Her unique brand of painting—which uses acrylics “slathered heavily” on canvas and often references works of the canon as viewed through a melted macabre filter—is at once classical and utterly contemporary.\\"  Education  Figgis graduated in 2006 from the Gorey School of Art in Wexford with a Bachelor in Fine Arts. She completed her studies in 2012 with a Masters of Fine Arts at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, Ireland. Early career  Figgis' use of Twitter to display her artwork in 2014 caught the attention of American artist Richard Prince and introduced Figgis into the New York art scene. Olivia Parkes writes \\"An unconventional rising art star, she started her family before she started art school, and received recognition for her work online before the gallery world caught up. It's the kind of story that makes you love the internet: for bringing us the good stuff, faster than we would have gotten it otherwise.\\" Figgis made her American debut exhibition at Harpers Books in East Hampton, New York in the summer of 2014 while also publishing her first book at the same time titled Making Love With the Devil. Since 2015, she is represented by Almine Rech Gallery. From the outset, Figgis has played with the culture of upper class luxury culture portrayed in the art canon by artists such as Diego Velázquez, Francisco Goya, Fragonard, Édouard Manet, James Ensor and François Boucher.  Style  Genieve Figgis, Leda and the Swan (after Boucher), 2018, Acrylic on canvas, 23 x 31 inches Figgis' style strikes a balance between figuration and abstraction. Her paintings are reminiscent of 18th century Rococo style as she recreates cheery Victorian photographs, and paintings with thick paint, causing the subjects to appear as melting, zombie-like creatures. Figgis values the use of paint for its ability to surprise, and is the medium she uses to form her figures of drips and swirls giving them a ghoulish imagery in her paintings. Her paintings technique involves dripping paint onto a canvas allowing gravity and colour- bleeding along to do most of the work with subtle surface marks to create specific details and textures. Her work has been influenced by growing up in Ireland with the rules of the Catholic Church and the scenic countryside she is surrounded by in her everyday life, living in County Wicklow. Figgis believes having a knowledge of a Spirit and becoming one with nature allows one to become more connected with the Earth's energy. This expression of spiritual beliefs can be seen through her works with her use of rich colors that \\"bubble, ooze and marbleize as if alive.\\" Figgis painted a version of Leda and the Swan in 2018 after an earlier work by François Boucher. Figgis’ contemporary version reinvents an idyllic romantic scene of lavish playfulness with a dark humor creating a scene of profanity and horror.

In 1739, he founded a theology school, Faggs Manor Classical School, near his church in Faggs Manor, Pennsylvania. Blair's son, also named Samuel Blair was born in Faggs Manor, and became the second Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives. The church was rebuilt in 1846 and is now known simply as the Faggs Manor Presbyterian Church. Life Blair was born in Ulster, Ireland on June 14, 1712 to William Blair. He immigrated to the colonies in his youth. He was educated in 1730–1735 under Reverend William Tennent at the Log College, the first theological seminary serving Presbyterians in North America located in what is now Warminster, Pennsylvania (then known as Neshaminy). He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Philadelphia on November 9, 1733 and ordained in September 1737. In the spring of 1734, he was asked to preach in the New Jersey towns of Millstone, Cranberry, Middletown, and Shrewsbury. He accepted the position in Middletown and Shrewsbury in September of that year. While in New Jersey, he was an original member of the Presbytery of New Brunswick. In June 1735, Blair married Frances van Hook, daughter of Judge Lawrence van Hook and Johanna (Smith) van Hook, who was the daughter of Hendrick Barents Smith of New York City. In 1739, he was called to Fagg's Manor, Pennsylvania but deferred to the Presbytery which advised him to accept. He returned to Pennsylvania 1739 and founded the Faggs Manor Presbyterian church and associated classical school in Londonderry Township. Many prominent Presbyterian clergy were trained there, including Samuel Davies who became the fourth President of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). It was during this time that Blair participated in the \\"New Side\\" of the division of the Presbyterian Church in Pennsylvania during the Great Awakening, embracing the revivals.. Blair's sermons, such as \\"A Perswasive to Repentance\\" are full of dense expressive figures, balanced argumentation and dialogic interludes. In his revival preaching, Blair aims at evoking negative emotions towards sinful laxness and presenting the Great Awakening as a breakthrough in the history of colonial America.. Retrieved March 4, 2017 Blair became ill while traveling to meet with the trustees of the College of New Jersey. He died in Faggs Manor on July 5, 1751 and is buried in the church cemetery. Legacy In 1754, his principal writings (seven important sermons), an elegy by Samuel Davies, and eulogy by Reverend Samuel Finley (fifth President of the College of New Jersey) were published in Philadelphia by his brother, John Blair who took over at the Faggs Manor church.

Posterior Fusen-ryū practitioners would be Tanabe's students Taro Miyake and Yukio Tani. Also, according to popular belief, Doshin So, the founder of Shorinji Kempo, was trained in Fusen-ryū jujutsu. Although its jujutsu style is popularly believed to be highly specialized in newaza or groundfighting, as Tanabe himself was, it actually focused rather on gyaku-waza or stand-up grappling, specially wrist locks. Tanabe described his ground strategy as created from his personal experience in jujutsu contests. Otherwise, the Fusen-ryū school featured a complete curriculum of atemi-waza (striking techniques), nage-waza (throwing techniques) and shime-waza (choking techniques).不遷流柔術 History The founder of Fusen-ryū was Motsugai Takeda, also known by the name of Fusen.Fumon Tanaka, Atsumi Nakashima, Serge Mol. Classical Fighting Arts of Japan: A Complete Guide to Koryu Jujutsu He was a part of the Takeda family, and after becoming a monk started training Namba Ippo-ryū jujutsu with Takahasi Inobei Mitsumasa. After receiving his menkyo kaiden, he travelled around many parts of Japan in a form of musha shugyo, learning in the schools of Yoshin-ryū, Takenouchi-ryū, Sekiguchi-ryū, Kito-ryū and Shibukawa-ryū, as well as the armed styles of Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, Hōzōin-ryū, Otsubo-ryū and Yamada-ryū. By adopting the strong points of each style, he created his Fusen- ryū curriculum. After being appointed priest of the Saihoji temple in Kyoto in 1830, he built a dojo in the nearby grounds and started teaching his style. Many martial artists heard his reputation and came to challenge him, but nobody could beat him. It was said Motsugai's students reached the number of 3000. Motsugai died in 1867, after which his school moved its influence field to Okayama. The school rose to fame again in 1891, when its headmaster Mataemon Tanabe defeated the Kodokan judoka Takisaburo Tobari in a challenge match. At the time, most jujutsu schools in Tokyo were losing place to the growing Kodokan, and the victory was shocking not only for coming from one of them, but also for how easily it happened thanks to Tanabe's personal advantage at newaza. The victory was followed by many others, and Tanabe capitalized on them to promote himself and his style by claiming his wins demonstrated the superiority of Fusen-ryū over judo and not any skill on his part.外編２−古流と講道館流 He taught his art at the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai and at Yataro Handa's Daito-ryū dojo, which went to specialize in newaza, and also shared his knowledge with judokas Yuji Hirooka and Soji Kimotsuki. Despite this, the Fusen-ryū school itself never grew to significant levels, with Tanabe remaining as its only renowned exponent. Eventually his son Teruo and his most known apprentices, Taro Miyake and Yukio Tani, became members of the Kodokan.

The film was commissioned by the USSR State Committee for Television and Radio. The shooting took place in a suburb of Leningrad, near Rzhevka station. Synopsis Two hapless young people - student Vladimir Busygin and his chance friend Semyon Sevostyanov, nicknamed Silva - escort two girls they just met in a cafe back home to the suburbs in the hopes of advancing their relations. After being rejected, they run back to the train station and are late for the last train. Finding themselves in a cold autumn night in another town, they try to convince someone to let them sleep over, but to no avail. In one of the windows they see a father and son having a heated quarrel. An adventurous idea comes to Vladimir who overhears the conversation - he wants to announce himself as an illegitimate son of the apartment's dweller, and thus solve the problem with dinner and a place to sleep. Andrei Grigorievich Sarafanov, musician-clarinetist (who performs at a dance club and at a cinema before screenings), a kind-hearted man who brought up two children without his wife, acknowledges the unexpected guest as his illegitimate son. His reaction is so sincere and touching that Vladimir's conscience is awakened. In addition he grew up without a father and Sarafanov's demeanor inadvertently compels him to become imbued with mutual feelings. He can not respond to such boundless trust with fraud and suddenly realizes that the problems of the family, the existence of which he was not aware of only yesterday, are not of total indifference to him. The younger son of Sarafanov, Vassenka, with all the ardor of youth is unrequitedly in love with Natalya - a woman who lives in the neighborhood. However, Silva interferes in their uneasy relationship, who behind Vassenka's back starts to successfully woo Natalia, but only as a pleasant diversion and without serious intentions.

They are located in the Plaza del Salvador, between the church of El Salvador and the convent building of San Marcos, 220 m from the Cathedral, with direct connection from the street of Trinidad convent building of San Marcos. In the year 1997, The City Council excavated and discovered stone stairs, which are located in front of the iron stairs. Archaeological work began thus, appearing two more rooms. In the third of them they discovered a well that, surprisingly, still contains water today. It is both well, because it emanates water of itself and also cistern as it receives rainwater through 3 holes in the roof. The water that fell here was transferred by three channels to the well. It is believed that this cistern- well was blocked in its day and remained hidden since for centuries the water was a precious commodity in Toledo. It traded with it through the water carriers. Only the wealthy classes could buy clean water. The rest drank from the contaminated streams that flowed into the Tagus. They tried to purify the water by filtering it through pots of clay and boiling it. The basement consists of two rooms: \\"Entry\\" and \\"Main room\\". Chronology With respect to the historical description, it can only be noted that a superposition of the ruins of the square of El Salvador has been graphically made with the Plan of city of Ibáñez Ibero of 1882, where they appear the traces of the old convent of San Marcos, built in the 16th century. In this plane do not appear data that evidences the belonging of the present ruins to that convent. Its chronology can be placed then between the 12th and 13th centuries, previous to the cloister of the convent of Trinitarios that it extended by the square.

It forms part of the Musical Instrument Museums collection of the University of Edinburgh, and is housed in St Cecilia's Hall. Its full name is the Raymond Russell Collection of Early Keyboard Instruments.  History  Raymond Russell, a British harpsichordist and organologist, bought his first historic keyboard instrument in 1939. Over the next twenty years he assembled a considerable collection of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century clavichords and harpsichords. His collection included instruments from all the main harpsichord-building areas of Europe: a number of English spinets; early harpsichords and virginals from Italy; Flemish instruments by the Ruckers; a late French instrument by Pascal Taskin; and a clavichord and harpsichord from North Germany, both by Johann Adolph Hass. Russell described many of the instruments in detail in his book The Harpsichord and Clavichord: an Introductory Study, published in 1959. By 1960 Russell had decided to donate his collection to Edinburgh University, where it was to become the nucleus of a centre for research in keyboard performance practice and organology, but this plan was not completed by the time of his sudden death in Malta in 1964 at the age of forty-one. Later that year, in his memory and in accordance with his wishes, his mother Maud Russell donated almost all of his collection – nineteen instruments – to the university; the donation also included his notes and his collection of documentary photographs. The collection was housed in St Cecilia's Hall in Edinburgh, which opened as a museum in 1968. The opening recital was given by Gustav Leonhardt. The university bought two further instruments from Russell's collection – an English double harpsichord by Jacob Kirckman, bought at auction in 1970, and a French double harpsichord by Jean Goermans and Taskin, purchased from Maud Russell in 1974 – bringing the total number to twenty-one.  Instruments  The instruments in the collection represent the five principal geographical areas or national schools of harpsichord-making – England, Flanders, France, the German-speaking world and the Italian peninsula – and more than two hundred years of the history of the craft. = England = English instruments in the collection include: * a rectangular virginal made by Stephen Keene in 1668 * a hexagonal spinet attributed to John Player, made in about 1705 * a single-manual harpsichord by Thomas Hancock, made in 1720 * a walnut bentside spinet by Thomas Hitchcock, dated 1728 * a bentside spinet made in 1757 by Sir John Harrison Burnett * a finelydecorated double-manual harpsichord by Jacob Kirckman, dating from 1755 * a Scottish bentside spinet made in Edinburgh in 1784 by Neil Stewart * a single-manual harpsichord by John Broadwood and Sons, made in 1793. = Flanders = There are four Flemish harpsichords in the collection, all made in Antwerp: * a double-manual harpsichord made by Andreas Ruckers the Elder in 1608 * a single-manual harpsichord by Ioannes Ruckers, dated 1637 * a double- manual transposing harpsichord, also by Ioannes Ruckers, 1638 * a single- manual harpsichord by Ioannes Couchet, made in 1645. = France = The two French instruments are: * a double-manual harpsichord made by Jean Goermans in 1764, rebuilt by Pascal Taskin in 1783–1784, formerly the property of Arnold Dolmetsch * a double-manual harpsichord by Taskin, made in 1769. = Germany = There are two North German instruments, both made in Hamburg by Johann Adolph Hass: an unfretted clavichord dating from 1763, and a single-manual harpsichord made in 1764.

Artistic life  Ibbotson was awarded the annual Newcomer prize from the Royal Academy in 2007. Her method of creating art has been described as \\"a rule-governed process of painting, based on close observation and meticulous recording.

Ibbotson states that the work titled Here I Am took 5 years to complete. She drew the wallpaper flowers in pencil first, in little bunches. The work shows the reflection of Ibbotson in a bathroom mirror.

While the concept of preserving federal data existed before, it gained new impetus with the election in 2016 of U.S. President Donald Trump. The concept of harvesting and preserving federal web pages began as early as 2008, at the conclusion of President George W. Bush's second term, under the name \\"End of Term Presidential Harvest.\\" \\"End of Term Presidential Harvest 2008\\" University of North Texas Digital Library, retrieved March 4, 2017 Soon after Trump's election, scientists, librarians and others in the U.S. and Canada—fearing that the administration of Trump (who had expressed doubts about the validity of the scientific consensus on the existence of climate change Kenny, Caroline \\"Trump: 'Nobody really knows' if climate change is real\\" CNN, December 12, 2016, retrieved March 4, 2017) would act to remove scientific data from government websitesDennis, Brady \\"Scientists are frantically copying U.S. climate data, fearing it might vanish under Trump\\" The Washington Post, December 13, 2016, retrieved March 4, 2017—began working to preserve those data. In quick order, the concept of Data Rescue became a grassroots movement, with organized \\"hackathon\\" events at cities across the U.S. and elsewhere, often hosted at universities and other institutions of higher education. Among the projects involved are the DataRefuge Project and the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. Guerrilla Archiving Event: Saving Environmental Data from Trump The Guerrilla Archiving Event: Saving Environmental Data from Trump was a meeting arranged by two professors at the University of Toronto in December 2016, in an effort to pre-emptively preserve US government climate data from possible deletion by the Trump Administration. =Background= During his run for presidency, President Trump had expressed, in various occasions, climate change denialism calling the climate change as Chinese hoax \\"in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive\\", and voiced his hostility towards climate science and Paris climate agreement. In early December 2016, a prominent climate change sceptic, Scott Pruitt was selected as a new administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These proceeding had raised concerns among academic community that the scientific opinion on climate change might be suppressed during Trump's presidency. Indeed, according to Reuters sources, in 25 January 2017, Trump's administration instructed United States Environmental Protection Agency to remove climate change page from their website. =The event= Fearing for possible deletion, or alteration of the US government websites containing the government climate data, as happened in Canada,xxx people from various academic backgrounds and training such as coders, environmental scientists, social scientists, archivists, and librarians gathered together in order to save US government websites at risk of changing or disappearing during or after government transition.

College career Sidney played college ball for Boston College from the Big East Conference between 2000 and 2003, where he based himself as the team's sixth man and was part in the college's transition from being last in the conference to winning it twice, and holding the Win-Lose odd record in the team's history. They managed to make it to the NCAA Division I but not to the higher stages in it. In one of the workouts he broke his jaw and played with a cast for two months. During his 3rd year there (2002/2003) his eldest son was born, and he was involved in a turning point event: his best friend and teammate, Andrew Bryant, was kept hostage in the Rubenstein Dorms just a few floors beneath Sidney's apartment by a man from another college, a man knocked on Sidney's door and informed him on the event, Sidney rushed down and tried to negotiate with the gun holder, the authorities arrested all three present in the scene, Sidney was cleared of charges but decided to drop out of college for \\"personal reasons\\", his chances of being picked in the NBA Draft suffered a decline.

She has previously held positions at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, University of Cincinnati, Rush University, and the University of Massachusetts. Raza's research focuses on myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Most recently, she is the author of The First Cell: And the Human Cost of Pursuing Cancer to the Last.  Early life  Raza was born in Karachi, Pakistan became interested in biology as well as evolution as a child. Raza then went to medical school in order to study biological sciences at Dow Medical College.  Academic and research positions  Raza moved to Buffalo to take a residency at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, where she researched the biology and pathology of myeloid malignancies. At the age of 39, Raza was named a Full Professor at Rush University in Chicago. Following this she worked as Charles Arthur Weaver Professor of Cancer Research at Rush University, where she also became the first Director of the Division of Myeloid Diseases. She was later named the Director of Hematology and Oncology at the University of Massachusetts, and then the Gladys Smith Martin Chair in Oncology. Raza was also the Director of the Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Center at St. Vincent's Comprehensive Cancer Center. Raza later became Professor of Medicine and Director of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Center at Columbia University.  Research  Raza's research has defined the Cell Cycle Kinetics of Myeloid Leukemia cells in vivo in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia by studying cellular proliferation in patients. This led researchers to believe that low blood counts were not a result of bone marrow failure, but instead a hyper-proliferative state in the marrow tissue, leading to their hematopoietic cells to die of apoptosis. Raza has also developed a tissue bank of cancer patients that contains several thousand specimens of patient tissue for her research, which she uses to identify treatment programs for various patients through genetic testing. This also resulted in a research partnership with the company Cancer Genetics in 2014, \\"to identify more accurate diagnostic and prognostic markers for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as novel therapies to target this class of bone marrow cancers.\\" Her research into acute myeloid leukemia has shown that a mutation in their bone-building osteoclast cells of patients suffering from the disease could be one of the causes of the cancer they develop. Raza has also used genomic technology to further research the pathology of myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as RNA Sequence and global methylation studies, and was a part of US President Barack Obama's \\"cancer moonshot\\" program, reporting to Vice-President Joe Biden.  Writing  Raza's 2009 book Ghalib: Epistemologies of Elegance co-written with Sara Suleri Goodyear, analyzed the work of the Urdu poet Ghalib, and included translations of Ghalib's Ghazals that the co-authors performed themselves.http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00fwp/published/ghalibreview2009.pdf Raza also facilitates Pakistani artists during visits to New York City.http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/entertainment/30-Nov-2015/hamid-ali-khan- mesmerizes-audience-at-musical-soiree-in-new-york She also co-wrote Myelodysplastic Syndromes & Secondary Acute Myelogenous Leukemia: Directions for the New Millennium in 2001. Raza's work has appeared in The New England Journal of Medicine, Nature, Blood, Cancer, Cancer Research, British Journal of Haematology, Leukemia, and Leukemia Research. She has also contributed to newspapers as an author, and has provided talks to organizations like TEDx New York. The hypothesis that early detection and prevention of cancer may be the most humane solution for the cancer problem was summarized in Raza’s essay in The Wall Street Journal, titled: \\"Cancer is still beating us. We need a new start\\".  Critical Acclaim  Raza's 2019 book The First Cell has received critical acclaim from many sources: *The New York Times, Books to Watch For in October 2019 * Amazon, Top 100 Books of 2019 * LitHub, Most Anticipated Books of 2019 * BookRiot, Must-Read Books on Cancer * Amazon, Best Science Books of 2019 * Starred Review from Publishers' Weekly * Starred Review from Kirkus Henry Marsh in the New York Times said, \\"Raza suggests the first cancer cell that gives rise to a tumor is like a grain of sand that precipitates the collapse of a sand pile. Research, she says, should concentrate on finding these early changes, before an actual tumor develops.\\" The Times (London) reported, \\"Her most ambitious project, though, is the MDS-AML (myelodysplastic syndromes-acute myeloid leukaemia) Tissue Repository, in which tissue from every bone marrow biopsy she has taken over 35 years is banked. Founded in 1984, it’s the oldest repository of its kind created by a single physician and contains 60,000 samples from Raza’s patients, including, painfully, her husband’s.\\" Barbara Kiser wrote in Nature: \\"Each year, the United States spends US$150 billion on treating cancer. Yet as oncologist Azra Raza notes in this incisive critique-cum-memoir, the treatments remain largely the same. Raza wants to see change: eliminating the first cancer cell rather than 'chasing after the last', which is doable with current technologies. Meanwhile, she braids often-harrowing stories of patients, including her own husband, with insights gleaned from laboratory and literature on this complex, often confounding array of diseases.\\"  Personal life  Raza was married to the late Harvey David Preisler, Director of Rush Cancer Institute. They have one daughter, Sheherzad Raza Preisler, who also lives in New York.  Awards  Raza was a Hope Funds for Cancer Research honoree in 2012. She also received the Distinguished Services in the Field of Research and Clinical Medicine award from Dow Medical College in 2014. Raza is the namesake of the Dr. Azra Raza scholarship award at her secondary school alma mater, Islamabad Model College for Girls F-7/2.

Fragments of British, European, Asian, and Native American pottery unearthed in the early colonial excavations embody a remarkable global convergence of cultures in clay. My practice in the rediscovery of lost ceramic techniques and the contexts of this history define my approach as a contemporary artist. I use the depth of history through the art of making to draw parallels through time such as the 18th century Staffordshire pottery industry and global design giant Nike, Wedgewood's abolitionist ceramics and 21st child slavery, the colonial discovery and obsession with fossils as prescient to our perilous addiction to fossil fuels.

Her work captures both Caribbean and American landscapes and experiences and engages in cultural critique. She works in many media including painting, photography, drawing, installations, ceramics, and sculpture as well as found objects.  Early life  She was born in Port-of- Spain, Trinidad. She is of Afro-Asian ancestry.  Education  She received her Bachelor of Arts in 1991, and a 1996 Master of Fine Arts in painting and printmaking, both from the University of South Florida. In 1997 she attended Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine.  Career  Early in her career in 2000 Holland Cotter remarked in the New York Times that Awai's then figurative paintings were sourced with \\"unprettified technique and a metaphorical bent\\" and that West Indies Colonialism was her subject. He speculated that in her overlaid images representing memories of the island of her childhood, the shifting of backgrounds and foregrounds in her paintings was a good way to think about history. He noted that in the 2000 exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem curated by Thelma Golden, Awai shared with other artists such as Sanford Biggers a looser sort of cultural signage as well as a post-1990s identity fluidity. Rocio Aranda-Alvarado, Senior Curator at El Museum del Barrio, described her layered imagery as identity politics that include both popular culture and her own personal manual of images. In 2018 Awai became involved as an artist in the U.S. monuments dispute. Generated after the Charlottesville, Virginia demonstration of white supremacy that sparked nationwide reconsideration of monuments to the Confederacy still in existence, Awai's proposal for a new monument was one of several done by artists for a New York Times article. Her monument rendering was inspired by the Grand Army Plaza memorial arch which is a tribute to fighters for the Union, focusing on the African-American man who surveys and stands ready for battle. When the conversation about who should be represented on a public pedestal broadened to deprecation of all indigenous peoples a commission was created to re-evaluate the monuments of New York City. Cecilia Alemani, director and chief curator of High Line Art created New Monuments for New Cities and chose Awai’s rendered proposal, a street drain in the shape of a man’s torso and face that reads “Reclaimed Water.” Carved into the metal at the bottom, a plaque of sorts, reads “Christopher Columbus”. ;Academic Positions From 2009 to 2015 she held the position of Critic for the Yale School of Art. She is currently Assistant Professor of painting and drawing at the University of Texas at Austin's Department of Art and Art History. ;Artist Residences *Artists in the Market Place, Bronx Museum of the Arts, (1997-1998) *Artist-in-Residence, Art Center South Florida, Miami Beach, FL.(1998) *BRIC Media Arts Fellowship Fellowship, Brooklyn, NY (1999) * Studio Museum in Harlem (1999-2000), * Artist-in-Residence, Hunter College, Art Department, New York, NY.

Ex-Trinidadians Nicole Awai and Terry Boddie (re)envision it in a Brooklyn NY gallery using elements of drawing, photography, sculpture. Historian Rocio Armanda-Alvaraz writes about their intent to reconsider minimalist art language of the1970s to bring a sophisticated yet non-narrative version of carnival, borrowing from an ethnicized and racialized past that has asserted itself, via their installation, in the present. The installation was shown at FiveMyles Gallery in Brooklyn New York. Local Ephemera, 2007 Subjects and objects depicted in action are drawn in a looser, colorful style. They contrast with the mechanical blueprint '\\"language\\" that other objects are rendered in \\"to bring clarity where there is none\\". Notable works from Local Ephemera include Specimen from Local Ephemera: Tension Springs (2004), Specimen from Local Ephemera: Drab Hanger (2007), Specimen from Local Ephemera: Castle Nut and Drama Queen (2007), and Specimen from Local Ephemera: Resistance with Black Ooze (2005) Almost Undone, 2011 was the title of an exhibition in September, 2011 at The Vilcek Foundation Gallery. The sculpture incorporated a wide variety of materials such as sprayed paper, resin, plastic, nail polish, and clay, resulting in bold, complex three-dimensional structures, which seemed to pull, stretch, and tear from the wall. in conjunction with her earlier works of her Local Ephemera series The sculpture creates its own multi-dimensional adaptation from that series, reconstituting one dimension into the next. Asphaltum Glance, 2013 was a painting on the walls of the small gallery at Alice Yard in her native Trinidad. Awai explored the origins of the viscosity and blackness that were a long-standing staples of her painting oeuvre. Through an Art Matters Grant trip in 2012 to Le Brea a childhood memory of a nearby pitch lake resonated with her so she photographed close-up details of it as the basis for wall sized paintings for the gallery. Speaking about the connection between the black ooze and Caribbean identity, Awai says, \\"The pitch lake is constantly replenishing itself, just like us, taking on new form.\\" According to Awai, asphalt is, \\"literally the remnants of all of us, the decomposition of all flora and all fauna over the course of known time that keeps turning, churning and revealing at the same instance material and items randomly from yesterday and four hundred years ago.\\" Before leaving Trinidad, Awai painted over Asphaltum Glance as a way of continuing her themes of \\"regeneration and malleability.\\" Notes for Material Re-pose, 2016 Critical Practices/ 21st Projects, New York, NY was the exhibition site for a sculpture intended to make viewers aware of their own material present/ presence, Awai posited a continual back and forth between narrative and matter in immediate time and perpetual history. She chose these exhibits for their \\"informal viewings\\" of artists' works, intending to set up the normative space for cultural consumption and bring the audience into a domestic setting.\\" Vistas, 2017 shown at Leslie Heller Gallery consists of a series Awai had been working on since 2013. As a mental view of a succession of remembered events they were partially focused on the characteristics of asphalt ooze of her prior work. “Vistas are momentary glimpse experiences. There is a feeling of impermanence, of possible shift, change or impending disappearance, illusive physicality that may actually be imagined and ephemeral. Vistas could be windows to the past, the future or even moments in the present that cannot be specified.” Material Re-pose, 2017 In an accompanying essay historian Dorota Biczel draws attention to Awai's abrupt transformational shifts of image, patterning and materials within the same work. Awai's juxtaposition of the infinity of the black ooze, the suggested locality of the rendered skins of animals, as well as the here and now of her own figurative likeness continue her signature premise of the complexity of matter and historical narrative. Persistent Resistance of the Liquid Land, 2018 In an installation inspired by a singular crouching black scout in a Brooklyn Civil War monument of otherwise standing group of white soldiers, “Persistent Resistance” consists of a central speckled, decorative column that looks like a Rorschach ink blot. Beneath it pooled on the floor, as if still in the process of cooling, is a pour of asphalt, resin, charcoal, nail polish over foam. Repeating butterfly-like paper shapes in dark blue, black, and gray hover around the column, often with a gray-tone image of the crouching soldier in the middle of them evoking cherubim or etherial figures. Also in the same year, The New York Times asked artists to propose alternatives to Confederate monuments being removed from public spaces. Awai's proposal was inspired by the Grand Army Plaza memorial arch which is a tribute to fighters for the Union. Focusing on the African- American man who surveys and stands ready for battle, she creates a winged soldier waiting to do battle for a better future. Envisioning the Liquid Land, 2019 A solo exhibition of painted relief works on paper. Purposely ambiguous spatial familiarities in multitude of parts combine into a complex mixture of visual and symbolic elements. Awai states “The history of the Americas is about malleability; the shaping and reshaping of resources and culture. It is an evolving, and revolving phenomena of transformation through the movement of bodies and materials,” References External links *Official Website 1966 births Living people University of South Florida alumni Trinidad and Tobago women artists Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture alumni Artists from Brooklyn University of Texas at Austin faculty American installation artists American women installation artists ","title":"Nicole Awai"},{"id":"53383386","text":"Hickam may refer to: ;Surname *Homer Hickam (born 1943), American author, Vietnam veteran, and a former NASA engineer **October Sky: The Homer Hickam Story, 1999 American biographical film *Horace Meek Hickam (1885–1934), pioneer airpower advocate and officer in the United States Army Air Corps ;Places *Hickam Air Force Base (formerly Hickam Field), United States Air Force installation *Hickam Housing, Hawaii, census-designated place in the City & County of Honolulu, Hawaii, United States See also *Hick (disambiguation) *Hickman (disambiguation) *Whickham ","title":"Hickam"},{"id":"53383411","text":"Oak's Inn Military Reservation was a coastal defense site located in Misquamicut, Rhode Island in the town of Westerly, overlooking Misquamicut State Beach.

She subsequently worked as a teacher for over forty-five years and published Out of the Depths, or the Triumph of the Cross, a notable biography of her family in 1927. Literary scholar Joanne M. Braxton describes Out of the Depths as a \\"'crossover' text bearing aspects of folklore, autobiography, and biography.\\"Plummer (1997), p. xvi. Family Plummer's father was Adam Francis Plummer (1819–1905). Her mother was Emily Saunders Plummer (c1815-1876). The two were married in 1841.Plummer (1997), p. xx. After 1855, the two began a series of correspondence that is collected in Out of the Depths.Plummer (1997), p. xxi.

Henry's son, Henry Vinton Plummer, Jr. was a lawyer who would become involved in black nationalism in New York and Virginia. Out of the Depths, or the Triumph of the Cross, 1927 Plummer mortgaged $1000 worth of her family's land in order to publish Out of the Depths, or the Triumph of the Cross in 1927.Plummer (1997), p. 3. The book traces the history of Plummer's family in Prince George’s County, Maryland beginning with her great grandfather Cupid Plummer, who served as a soldier in the American revolution. In 1790, the first US census listed Cupid as free, and in 1797, his wife and children were emancipated.Plummer (1997), p. xx Relationships like these between free and enslaved blacks were not uncommon in the United States. But because the condition of children followed that of the mother, the descendants of many free blacks were enslaved. One of these enslaved descendants of Cupid Plummer was Adam Francis Plummer, Nellie's father. From 1841 to 1905, Adam kept a diary that ended up running to 200 pages. Nellie draws heavily on her father's diary in Out of the Depths. Her publication of this history scandalized family members, who neither wanted to recall nor be reminded of their past. Nevertheless, the book became a treasured possession for families who owned copies and frequently referred to Out of the Depths simply as \\"The Book.\\" Notes References * Hopkinson, Natalie (August 17, 2003). \\"In History's Hand\\".

The shrine is notable as it is jointly used for worship by members of both faiths, while both communities also display reverence for the nearby Indus River at the shrine. Background Sindhi Muslims believe the saint interred at the shrine is Sheikh Tahir - who they believe was a Hindu convert to Islam born as Odero Lal. Hindus also revere the interred saint as Odero Lal, but offer a different explanation for his origins. Hindus also refer to the saint in the shrine as Jhulelal, a name which Sindhi Muslims also use to refer to Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, whose shrine is in Sehwan Sharif. It forms the seat of the Daryapanthis, originally a sub- sect of the followers of Gorakhnath, who belong to the Nath tradition. Both communities also refer to the saint by the alternate and religiously-neutral term Zinda Pir, or \\"The Living Saint.\\" The complex is home to both a Muslim shrine and Hindu temple. The joint arrangement was devised as a compromise to stem any conflict that might arise regarding by which religious tradition the corpse should be disposed of.  Worship  The shrine caretakers hail from both the Muslim and Hindu communities. In the evening, Muslims offer namaz prayers at the shrine while Hindus perform aarti and puja prayers. At the temple, a lamp is kept burning perpetually. On the new moon days, lamps are lighted and the shrine deity, an avatar of Varuna, is worshipped at the nearby river, or other water bodies, with rice, sugar-candy, spices and fruits. Significance =For Muslims= According to Muslim tradition, Sheikh Tahir was born as a Hindu by the name of Odero Lal (alternatively spelled Udero Lal), but converted to Islam as a teenager. Odero Lal in his youth was said to have been fiercely opposed to the Hindu caste system, and as a result, attracted the attention of a Sufi saint from Multan, whose association then lead Odero Lal to convert to Islam and adopt the name Sheikh Tahir. =For Hindus= Hindus commonly refer to Odero Lal as Jhulelal. According to Hindu tradition, a tyrannical ruler named Mirkh Shah from nearby Thatta ordered that local Hindus convert to Islam within 24 hours. Local Hindus, fearful of this edict, prayed at the banks of the Indus River, where they then saw a vision of the Hindu deity Varuna who informed the worshippers that he would re-incarnate himself as an infant to be born in Nasirpur in order to deliver them from their hardships. The underside of the shrine's dome is decorated with mirror- work known as ayina kari. The baby Jhulelal was then born on the first day of the Hindu month of Chaitra. Upon hearing of the infant's birth, Mirkh Shah commanded a Hindu minister named Ahirio to kill the infant with a poisoned rose petal. When Ahirio saw the infant, Jhulelal smiled and the poisoned rose petal blew out of Ahirio's possession. When Ahirio caught sight of Jhulelal for a second time, he was startled to see that the infant had grown into an elderly man. The elderly man was then said to have turned into a young man, and then a warrior on horseback before Ahirio's eyes. Ahirio returned to recount the story to Mirkh Shah, who then lambasted Ahirio, and told him to leave and call out for Jhulelal in villages and by the banks of the Indus River. Upon calling for Jhulelal, the warrior on horseback appeared out of the river to appear to Ahirio with an accompanying army. Terrified, Ahirio begged Jhulelal to restrain his army. Jhulelal's army then disappeared back into the river, while Ahirio went back to the palace to recount the story to Mirkh Shah. Mirkh Shah remained skeptical, but invited Jhulelal to his court with intent to forcefully convert Jhulelal. Jhulelal is then said to have vanished, leaving Mirkh Shah enraged. Mirkh Shah then ordered that all Hindus immediately convert to Islam. The Hindus then rushed to the house in Nasirpur where Jhulelal was born, and found Jhulelal there as an infant. The infant consoled the distraught Hindus and commanded them to assemble at a temple near the Indus River. Upon assembling, a firestorm broke out and engulfed Mirkh Shah's palaces. The king escaped to the banks of the river, where he found Jhulelal, now again a warrior, and his Hindu followers protected from the firestorm. The king fell at Jhulelal's feet, and Jhulelal dismissed the storm with the movement of his hand. Jhulelal is also believed by Sindhi Hindus to have performed miracles, such as entering the Indus river at Nasirpur, and coming up at Bukkur, at the northernmost extent of Sindh.

Episodes  =Episode One: The Beginning= This episode, exploring theories of how the universe came into being, outlines the realisation of Edwin Hubble that the universe is expanding, and the discovery of the residual radiation that gave weight to the Big Bang theory. It also highlights some lesser known theorists including Georges Lemaître, who first theorised that there was a big bang, Ralph Alpher, who stated that the light from this should be detectable, and Cecilia Payne, who calculated that hydrogen and helium were the dominant elements in the universe. The episode concludes at the Large Hadron Collider, where physicists create matter in a similar manner to the Big Bang. =Episode Two: The End= This episode explores the theories of the big crunch, the big rip and the big freeze, that are postulated by physicists as possible fates for the universe. Al-Khalili indicates that the difficulty in understanding this is our limited ability to comprehend something of such immensity both physically and philosophically. So, rather than suggesting an answer, he provides the historical background for how we came to know what we know, such as how elements are forged inside stars and how gravity provides the key to the fate of the universe, and what we don't know, such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy.  Reception  Jack Seale, writing for The Guardian, commends the Al-Khalili for, \\"his usual mix of spectacular locations, clear explanations, a few gags and the stories of scientists who made crucial breakthroughs.\\" Gary Rose, writing for RadioTimes however points out that while Al-Khalili is \\"as watchable as ever\\", this series, unlike his earlier series Atom, covers well-trodden ground and while there are \\"oodles of graphs and stats,\\" which he explains, \\"with seemingly effortless lucidity,\\" regular viewers of Horizon, \\"might be immune to the barrage of cosmic stats.\\"  References   External links  The Beginning and End of the Universe at OpenLearn * 2016 British television series debuts 2016 British television series endings 2010s British documentary television series BBC high definition shows BBC television documentaries about history BBC television documentaries about science British documentary films British films British documentary television series Documentary films about the history of science Historical television series History of electrical engineering English-language television shows ","title":"The Beginning and End of the Universe"},{"id":"53383848","text":"Ordrup Asyl, later Kong Christian IX's Asyl and now Kong Christian Den Ix og Dronning Louises Børnehave , is a daycare established in the 1860s in Ordrup to the north of Copenahgen, Denmark.

The escaped gas rose and was released into Earths atmosphere after clearing the surface. An estimated that 6 - 8.8 million litres (210,000 - 310,000 cubic feet) of natural gas was being released from the damaged pipe per day. The pipeline operator, Hilcorp Energy, has said that there is presently too much sea ice to safely launch a repair mission. They added that shutting off the flow of natural gas through the pipeline would compound the problem, because the pipe had previously been used to transport crude oil and the residual crude in the pipe would then be exposed to the sea water once the pipeline was depressurized. The leak was first reported in February 2017, but an investigation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration states that the leak may have begun in December 2016. The leak was reported to be dry natural gas being sent to the platforms as fuel, which consists of 99% methane. Divers reported that the leak was caused by the pipeline being laid across a rock on the ocean floor, resulting in a small hole. Non-profit organizations representing the environment have either sued or expressed interest in suing Hilcorp Energy, claiming that the ongoing situation is a danger to beluga whales and other marine life. The leak was repaired April 13, 2017 when divers were able to install a clamp on the leaking pipe. Litigation and state response The Alaska-based environmental organization Cook Inlet Keeper has sent a letter to Hilcorp Energy, stating their intent to sue the energy company, for what the group alleges are violations of the Clean Water Act. The Center for Biological Diversity further alleges that Hilcorp Energy is in violation of four federal laws. In addition to the Clean Water Act, the Center maintains that Hilcorp is violating the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Pipeline Safety Act in a letter to the company announcing the Centers planned litigation against them. In addition, the administration of Alaska Governor Bill Walker, through the cabinet-level Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC), has demanded that Hilcorp Energy closely monitor the environmental impact of the ongoing leak. ADEC has also requested that Hilcorp hire specialists to look for dead fish and other marine life in the area, and to come up with a repair plan by March 8, 2017.

Background Brett Darren Lee was born to James D. Lee and Karen Arnold (died December 18, 2018), to a southern White American family. According to Lee, after his parents broke up, his mother relocated from the then more prosperous \\"North County\\" of St. Louis County, Missouri, to the more multiracial South Side at Shaw, St. Louis and entered into an interracial relationship, baring several mixed-race half-siblings for Lee. In the 2000s, several of Lee's close family members have been killed in gang-related shootings; his sister's boyfriend, Shelby Polk III, an African-American man, was killed in Soulard on July 19, 2015 as part of a shooting.

He studied under Abdul-Rahman Baseer, Ali al-Timimi (associated with the Virginia jihad network) and Anwar al-Awlaki (a leader within al-Qaeda). In 2007, Lee authored a ten post blog series entitled The Rise and Fall of the Salafi Movement, which focused mostly on black converts to Salafism in the United States, in a lineage of interest in Islam which he traced from Malcolm X onward. Lee's writing about the movement, which was mostly \\"lamentful\\", portrayed a disillusionment with what it described as Salafists separation from \\"the real world\\", divisions, descent into religious-extremism, and control by Saudi Arabian Islamic scholars who were ill-equipped to advise and guide on American social and cultural matters. During this time, Lee's blog won the award for \\"best series\\" in the Brass Crescent Awards. This led to a feud with Dawud Adib, an African-American who had converted in the 1970s; he authored The History of the Salafi Da'wah in America in response, accusing Lee of being federal informant or an \\"agent provocateur\\", saying that Lee was \\"a criminal\\". Adib emphasised the need for \\"pious steadfastness\\", while Lee was more interested in mixing Islam with \\"social activism\\" and secular engagement (similar politically to the Muslim Brotherhood approach). In the aftermath of the War on Terror, Lee was investigated by the FBI accused of \\"connections to terrorists\\" (namely al-Timimi and al-Awlaki), however he was cleared of all charges put against him. By 2010, Lee completed his drift away from Salafism and began to associate himself religiously with the Sufism of Mubarak Ali Gilani, the community in which his then wife was reared, before concluding they exhibited the same type of religious-extremism and isolationist tendencies Lee had found with the Salafi community. By 2013, Lee announced in a YouTube video in which he denounced Islam and Islamic societies completely that he was leaving the religion and converting to Baptism, a Protestant sect, before changing back again to Islam a few days later. In 2017 Lee criticized the Georgetown Islamic Studies Professor Jonathan Brown after he attended his lecture on slavery. Political activity Lee, while working as a cab driver, campaigned against the introduction of ride-share companies to the St. Louis Market. In 2014, Lee covered the Ferguson Unrest and was interviewed on several national outlets. During his coverage of the Ferguson unrest, Lee was arrested on two occasions http://www.stlamerican.com/news/local_news/police- abuses-can-t-stand-scrutiny-of-social-media- live/article_dd486708-49d1-11e4-9734-8fedcbcd786a.html Lee was subsequently fired as a cab driver and contended that it was for his political activities in Ferguson. In 2016 Lee briefly announced he was running for St. Louis Mayor as a Republican on a far-left platform before endorsing St. Louis treasurer and Democrat Tishaura Jones for the office. Lee also writes Noir Literature that is based in St Louis. Since June 2018, Lee hosted St Louis Speaks, a podcast that fosters dialog about St Louis and the surrounding area. The podcast was co-created and is produced by historian Mark Loehrer https://www.stlmag.com/culture/umar-lee-on-his-new-podcast-st-louis-speaks/In 2020 the podcast changed its name to Informal History STL and added several local historians and writers while adding a quarterly print publication.

Biography  Pagliuso was born in California in 1941. She received her bachelor of fine arts from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1963. Pagliuso's father raised chickens and her mother loved her flower garden. Her father's love for chickens influenced her work. Pagliuso has lived in New York and Los Angeles throughout her career. She now lives with her husband,Tom, and her daughter, Jesse, in Santa Fe, New Mexico and New York.  Career  Pagliuso worked as the assistant art director for Mademoiselle Magazine. She also worked at the office of interiors for Morganelli Heumann and Associates. In 1969, Pagliuso started her career in photography. She moved to New York in 1974. For the next 30 years, her photographs were printed in magazines including House & Garden magazine, Interview magazine, Italian Harpers Bazaar, Italian Vogue, Mademoiselle, Men's Journal, Newsweek, New York Times Magazine \\"fashion of Times,\\" New York Magazine, Rolling Stone, Seventeen, Time Magazine, and Vogue. She worked on assignments for fashion editor Anna Wintour for 10 years and worked with many actors and celebrities such as Jessica Lange, Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, and Robert Redford among others. Other collaborations include working with Robert Altman, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, and Disney. While working with Robert Altman, she shoot stills on the sets of Thieves Likes Us, Buffalo Bill and the Indians, Nashville, and Popeye.  Photography  The Poultry Suite is one of her most well-known photographic series. The Poultry Suite is a collection of photographs of chickens. She decided to take these chicken portraits in honor and memory of her father after his passing. He had raised chickens that were shown annually in the Pomona State Fair (now L.A. County Fair) when she was a little girl. Shooting with a Hasselblad camera in her Chelsea, Manhattan studio, Pagliuso photographed chickens from an animal talent agency since all of her fathers chickens had been given away by the time she decided to start the project. She uses a low shutter speed and open aperture giving the images a softer quality. In order to achieve an effect of graphite drawings, she prints the images onto handmade Thai Mulberry paper in her darkroom. A process that is delicate and labor-intensive.  Exhibitions  The Poultry Suite series of work has been shown at the Mary Ryan Gallery in New York frequently, most recently as a retrospective titled \\"In Plain Sight\\" and was turned into a monogram published by Hirmer Publishers. The series was also featured in a retrospective solo exhibition, \\"Poultry, Raptors, Places of Ritual\\" at the Florida Museum of Photographic Arts in Tampa. The Drawing Room also showed the work in a notable 2006 show of The Poultry Suite, and again in 2009 with an addition of The Raptor Suite, that included the addition of seven owl photographs.

She is considered a writer, a visual anthropologist, and a filmmaker.  Biography  Roxanne Varzi was born in Iran to an American mother and an Iranian father. Her family migrated to the United States after the Iranian Revolution in 1979. She moved back to Iran in 1991 to continue her education at the American University in Cairo in Cairo, Egypt. She completed her PhD in 2002 at Columbia University for anthropology. Due to her Iranian roots, many of her works focus on post-Revolution Iran public culture. She expresses her art through many forms of media, including, but not limited to, films, books, and sound performances. She was the first recipient of the Fulbright award to Iran since the Revolution. Even though many of her works are focused on Iranian culture, she has expanded her work to tackle universal issues concerning war.  Career  Roxanne Varzi is currently a full professor of anthropology and film and media studies at University of California, Irvine. While at the University of California, Irvine, she has completed many works. Her first book, Warring Souls: Youth, Media, and Martyrdom in Post-Revolution Iran (2006) focuses heavily on how propaganda and media take a role in shaping the identities of those living in post-Revolution Iran. The author says this that her book focuses on \\"the intersection of religion, vision, and power, and whether the individual ultimately has the power to turn an image off\\". Her second work, Plastic Flowers Never Die (2008) which is an experimental documentary on the effects of the war in Iran, and the aftermath of the war. In this documentary, she speaks to mural painters, museum curators, and veterans to get a thorough breakdown of war and how the post-war period has been affected by the war. Plastic Flowers Never Die was selected for 14 film festivals. The Whole World Blind (2011) was her first sound performance. It is said to be experienced while the audience is \\"blindfolded and wearing headphones\\". The audience listens to a \\"narrative loop of a curator describing a slide show of war photography\\". Her second book, Last Scene Underground: An Ethnographic Novel of Iran (2015) is a fictional story set in Iran's Green Movement about young Iranians learning life lessons \\"through politics, art, and the meaning of home\\". Last Scene Underground was a gold medalist in the 2016 Independent Publisher Book Awards. Her most recent work, Salton Sublime (2017), is another sound performance focusing on what sublime means in the current state of environmental degradation our world is facing.

It is named after composer Heitor Villa-Lobos, and is located next to Pinheiros River. It was created in 1989 on a site that was previously used as a rubbish tip. The park now has around 37,000 trees. It hosts the annual Aberto de São Paulo.  Location  The park is located the Alto de Pinheiros district to the west of the centre of São Paulo.  History  In the late 1980s the area where the park is now located was used as a rubbish tip. The western area was used by the Companhia de Entrepostos e Armazéns Gerais do Estado de São Paulo (Company of Warehouses and General Warehouses of the State of São Paulo, CEAGESP) for their garbage disposal, and around 80 families were scavenging for food and packaging there. The central part was used as a waste dump for civil construction, and the eastern part was used to hold dredged material from the Pinheiros river. The first studies to turn the area into a park were carried out in 1987 as part of the centenary of Heitor Villa-Lobos's birth. State decrees allocated to create the park, dedicated to leisure, culture and sport. The Departamento de Águas e Energia Elétrica (Department of Water and Electric Power, DAEE) started to clear the site in 1989, removing the families that were living there, and of debris that was larger than diameter. The site was landscaped by moving of earth. The Boaçava creek, which runs through the site, was channelized. The new park was designed by Décio Tozzi, with a \\"music city\\" theme. The administration of the park was changed in January 2004 to the Secretaria do Meio Ambiente (State Department of Environment, SMA) of São Paulo state, with emergency maintenance carried out at the park in the same year, and the possibility of extending the park was started to be investigated. In 2011 plans were announced to expand the park by 20% by incorporating a area currently used for the construction of Line 4 of the São Paulo Metro. Around 5,000 people visit the park each day during the week, around 20,000 people during weekends, and around 30,000 people during holidays.  Features  Inside Orquidário Ruth Cardoso = Environment = The park has a bird nursery, musical island, playgrounds, and around 37,000 trees native to the Atlantic Forest.

Its unusual rear fuselage gave a wide field of downward machine gun fire. Only two examples were built. Design and development In 1930, the French government set out several programmes for colonial aircraft to police their overseas territories. Covering single and multi-engine designs, all were to be all- metal and powered by the Lorraine 9Na Algol radial engines, these contracts required two prototypes of each type, each shown to be capable of flight. Nieuport-Astra offered two types, the three-engined Nieuport-Delage NiD 590 and the smaller, single-engined NiD 690, which had much in common. Both had the angular appearance of the earlier single-engined NiD 540 airliner. The Nid 590 also had very similar dimensions to the NiD 540 but both newer designs differed from the earlier one in their novel rear fuselage structure. The NiD 690 was a high wing, cantilever monoplane, with wings which were trapezoidal in plan. Its Algol engine was in the nose within a narrow-chord, Townend ring type cowling and behind it the forward and central metal-covered fuselage was, apart from the roof, flat-sided and rectangular in section. The pilots' enclosed cockpit was under the wing leading edge with all-around glazing of the multi-panel type and with lower side windows for better downward vision. Colonial aircraft were expected to fill a variety of roles, including transport, bombing, reconnaissance, observation, policing and medical, so needed a large and reconfigurable internal space. Since policing involved observation of and intervention in ground events, clear views and wide fields of machine gun fire were required. As on the NiD 590, Nieuport provided a long cabin behind the cockpit with windows on each side under the mid-wing and the trailing edge; towards the rear of the cabin its walls came closer together until they met the rear fuselage, which was T-shaped in section and built from three longerons, with T-shaped bulkheads and metal covering. Long wall openings towards the rear of the cabin allowed a gunner at its narrow convergence to fire backwards and downward as well as to the sides. The tail of the NiD 690 was conventional and angular, with its trapezoidal tailplane and narrow, rectangular elevators mounted at the top of the fuselage. Its fin was triangular and the rudder was almost rectangular. It had a conventional, fixed undercarriage with each mainwheel on a V-strut hinged from the lower fuselage longeron and a long, vertical shock absorber strut to the wing. The prototype made its first flight in June 1934 but in CEMA (the Centre d'Essais de Matériels Aériens at Villacoublay) trials it was judged overweight for the available power. The second prototype flew three months later, with its fuselage lengthened by and an extended elevator to rectify directional instabilities. Both NiD 690s had been retired by the end of 1934; the SPCA 80 was the only other single-engined competitor on the 1930 programme and it, too, was rejected for production.

W. Lamb of the Paragon Feature Film Company. The melodrama was shot in Columbus, Georgia, in March 1915 and included flashback scenes depicting the Battle of Columbus also known as \\"Last Battle of the Civil War\\", fought in Columbus on April 16, 1865. It is the first movie known to be shot in the city. The story was similar to several other movies produced by Paragon around this time including The Lumberjack (1914), filmed in Wausau, Wisconsin and The Blissveldt Romance (1915) filmed in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The film was first shown during the Homecoming festivities of April 14–17, 1915, that coincided with the 50th anniversary of the battle. In all likelihood, it would have been seen by witnesses of the actual event. After touring the country, the film was returned to Columbus where it was shown again in November 1916. The Homecoming of 1916 appears to be the last time the film was shown in public.  Plot  In the film, young Dorothy Watkins meets Richard Wentworth through an automobile accident. They meet again at the country club golf course. Richard calls on her at her home (represented by Dinglewood) and meets her family. The couple tours Columbus and sees the many things the community has to offer its residents including the Ralston Hotel, St. Elmo (the house of Augusta Evans Wilson), parks and factories. They also meet an aging soldier at the Confederate monument who tells them stories of the Civil War, including its last major military engagement, the Battle of Columbus. After meeting again at a dance, Richard asks for Dorothy’s hand in marriage but, her father refuses to give his blessing. The couple plans to elope by boating across the Chattahoochee River to the Alabama side. The boat overturns, sending the couple over the falls and presumably to their deaths. The couple survives and her father gives his blessing for their union. They marry at Trinity Episcopal Church and the film ends with the couple sailing off on the riverboat W.C. Bradley.

Together with Edith Behring and Fayga Ostrower, she is part of the generation of Brazilian women engravers that art historian Geraldo Edson de Andrade calls the \\"matriarchy of engraving in Brazil\\".  Career  Katz began her career in the 1940s, primarily painting portraits and landscapes of Rio de Janeiro. In 1946, she started to take woodcutting lessons with the Austrian printmaker Axl Leskoschek . Between 1947 and 1950, Katz attended college at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro, focusing her studies on painting. She went on to get a licentiate degree in drawing from the College of Philosophy of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Persuaded by a friend, the artist Poty Lazzarotto, Katz studied metal engraving with Carlos Oswald at the Rio de Janeiro School of Arts and Crafts. Throughout the 1950s, she continued to work with metal engraving but switched to woodcutting and lithography for most of her career and only returned to engraving in the 1980s. After moving to São Paulo in 1951, Katz taught painting and print making at the São Paulo Museum of Art from 1952 to 1955, and at the Armando Álvares Penteado Foundation from 1953 to 1963. During this period, from the late 1940s to mid 1950s, she mostly dedicated herself to woodcut and linocut working. She produced figurative prints with a strong social appeal in the style of social realism, portraying marginalized members of the Brazilian population, including migrants, farm workers and slum dwellers. In the 1960s, Katz adopted a more abstract style which she continued for the rest of her career. She dedicated herself to painting and drawings, embarking on a study of color through serigraph printing. To obtain the desired effects, Katz engraved up to five matrices and applied up to eight different colors to make multiple impressions of a single print. Of this process, she said: \\"color emerged from the evolution of the work, and the multiplication of the matrices brought the possibility of exploring various tonal values.\\" During the 1970s, Katz started working with lithography, which became her favoured medium. In 1965, Katz becomes a professor at the School of Architecture and Urbanism at the University of São Paulo, the same institution where she obtained her master's and doctoral degrees. Her 1979 master thesis was the first scholarly work at the University of São Paulo presented as a series of serigraphs. Similarly, her 1982 doctoral thesis consisting of 13 lithographs was the first non-verbal dissertation presented in her department. Diminishing health made Katz give up printmaking, shifting her focus to watercolors. \\"Since engraving demands physical strength, with time it became increasingly hard to work with it\\", she claimed.

On her way there, she was arrested for theft and exposed. The case attracted great attention in contemporary Dutch press for its romantic circumstances and the defense used this by claiming that she had been led to her crime blinded by love. She was sentenced to four years in prison in 1839.

Clare Cooper Marcus was born in 1934 and raised in a north London suburb. She received her undergraduate degree in historical geography from University College, London and a Masters in urban and cultural Geography from University of Nebraska at Lincoln. She returned to England to teach cartography at the University of Sheffield, and worked as urban planner at the Ministry of Housing and London County Council. She returned to the US and earned a second Masters in City and Regional Planning from the University of California at Berkeley in 1965. She participated in counter-culture movement in the 1960s at Berkeley, joining in the student strikes, and agitating for free speech. She was inspired by the writings of Catherine Bauer Wurster on housing programs and Jane Jacobs on urban place- making. Marcus worked for several years as a research associate in the Institute of Urban and Regional Development at the University of California at Berkeley and began teaching in the Department of Landscape Architecture in 1969. Her course on Social and Psychological Factors in Open Space Design was popular among undergraduate and graduate students alike. She held a joint appointment in the Department of Architecture where she taught seminars on social aspects of housing design, environments for the life cycle, and sense of place. She collaborated with many of her former students in writing articles and editing books. Marcus was married to the landscape architect Stephen Marcus with whom she has two children, Jason and Lucy. After having retired from full-time teaching in 1994, she writes, travels, and consults. She is the Principal of the firm Healing Landscapes specializing in healthcare settings and regularly teaches healthcare garden design at the Chicago Botanic Garden. She has received numerous awards, including for exemplary design research from the National Endowment for the Arts, career award from the Environmental Design Research Association (EDRA), and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Her co-edited (with Carolyn Francis) volume People Places: Design Guidelines for Urban Open Space received a Merit Award from the American Society of Landscape Architects in 2000 and Healing Gardens: Therapeutic Benefits and Design Recommendations (co-edited with Marni Barnes) won the EDRA Award for Place Research in 2000. Marcus advocates post-occupancy evaluation as a research method for studying public and semi-public open spaces. In her studies of Easter Hill Village in Richmond, California and St. Francis Square in San Francisco, she saw that semi-public open spaces in cluster housing foster a sense of community. She found these spaces to be well-used by residents, particularly by children. Her articles and book (with Wendy Sarkissian) Housing as if People Mattered: Site Design Guidelines for Medium- Density Family Housing published by the University of California Press in 1986 showed how medium density, low-rise cluster housing is supportive of families with children and a catalyst in building social networks. Marcus expanded her studies on open spaces in housing to other types—neighborhood and city parks, plazas, and campus open spaces in her edited volume (with Carolyn Francis) People Places: Design Guidelines for Urban Open Space first published by Van Nostrand Reinhold in 1990. She translated her findings in performance guidelines that would aid the designer and bridge the gap between research and practice. The formative years of Marcus' childhood were spent in Buckinghamshire countryside during World War II where her family was evacuated from London. There she was free to explore the landscape and developed a lifelong affinity for the natural outdoors. She encouraged her design students to remember their own childhood environments and write their environmental autobiography to discover hidden biases while designing for their clients. Marcus' work shows the impact of human potential movement in California in the 1960s. She attended seminars in the Carl Jung Institute in San Francisco and the Esalen Institute in Big Sur to delve deep into topics such as the age of Aquarius, sacred geometries in the landscape, self-transformation and becoming whole through integration of feminine and masculine archetypes. She wrote about the garden as a symbol of the higher self and the role of gardening in creating the spiritual community of Findhorn in Scotland. She adapted the Gestalt role playing therapeutic technique in her research on house as symbol of the self that was published as the book The House as a Mirror of Self: Exploring the Deeper Meaning of Home published by Conari Press in 1995. Marcus' own environmental autobiography and analysis of her self and growth are contained in Iona Dreaming: The Healing Power of Place, A Memoir published by Nicholas-Hays, Inc. in 2010. In this book written after a double bout with cancer, she reveals the remarkable power of place to heal psychological wounds and restore the spirit. Marcus has continued her research on restorative environments in the book (with Marni Barnes) Gardens in Healthcare Facilities: Uses, Therapeutic Benefits, and Design Recommendations published by The Center for Health Design, Inc. (Martinez, California) in 1995; in the edited volume (with Marni Barnes) Healing Gardens: Therapeutic Benefits and Design Recommendations published by John Wiley & Sons in 1999; and the book (with Naomi Sachs) Therapeutic Landscapes: An Evidence-Based Approach to Designing Healing Gardens and Restorative Outdoor Spaces published by John Wiley & Sons in 2014. She advocates designing salutogenic' urban spaces that promote health.

Scharschmidt Bruce F. Scharschmidt (born March 6, 1946) is an American physician-scientist whose career has spanned academic, business and non-profit sectors. He was a major contributor to the advancement of liver transplantation.  Personal life  Scharschmidt was born in East Cleveland, Ohio. He now lives in San Francisco, California with his wife, Peggy S. Crawford M.D.  Education and academic career  Scharschmidt graduated from Shaw High School in East Cleveland and completed his undergraduate and medical education in Northwestern University’s Honors (6-year) Program in Medical Education. After completing his residency training in Internal Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in 1972, Scharschmidt worked for three years as a Clinical Associate at the National Institutes of Health, where he was a founding member of the Liver Disease Research Branch of NIDDK. Scharschmidt returned to UCSF in 1975 for subspecialty training in gastroenterology, and in 1977 joined the UCSF faculty. In 1985, he became a Professor of Medicine and, in 1990, was named Chief of the Gastroenterology division. While at UCSF, for two decades Scharschmidt led an independent NIH- funded research laboratory focused on liver physiology and the pathophysiology of liver disease. His research team elucidated cellular mechanisms of bile formation, including characterization of the hepatic uptake of organic anions such as bilirubin, demonstration that hepatic update of bile acids is sodium- coupled and electrogenic, identification of the presence on the basolateral hepatocyte membrane of a sodium-coupled bicarbonate transporter critical to intracellular pH regulation, and reporting of the initial evidence that hepatic bile acid secretion is mediated by an ATP-dependent transporter (later identified and shown to be mutated in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2). His team also collaborated in the identification of the gene that is responsible for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1, previously known as Byler's disease, as well as benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis. Scharschmidt was an invited speaker at the 1982 NIH Consensus conference on Liver Transplantation, he reviewed and presented the results of liver transplantation, which at that time was carried out in only four centers worldwide, and authored the then definitive article on liver transplantation outcomes. The NIH Consensus Conference concluded that liver transplantation was no longer experimental, which paved the way for its reimbursement and availability at centers throughout the US and worldwide. Subsequently, with his UCSF colleagues in surgery, Scharschmidt helped launch the UCSF liver transplant program. As a member of the Training and Workforce Committee of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, he worked with his colleagues to set current standards for training in hepatology.  Mentoring  More than 15 individuals trained directly with Scharschmidt, several of whom became gastroenterology division chiefs, and/or deans and dozens more completed the UCSF gastroenterology training program for which he was responsible. He authored an invited article on the topic of mentoring for Gastroenterology.  Business career  In 1996, Scharschmidt moved to Chiron Corporation, where he served as Corporate VP responsible for the clinical development of both therapeutics and vaccines until its acquisition in 2006 by Novartis, where he remained for two years. While at Chiron and Novartis, his team was responsible for the successful clinical development and approval of therapeutics, including interleukin 2 for melanoma., Scharschmidt also played a central role in the early development of several new vaccines subsequently approved in the US and/or Europe, including the first influenza vaccine manufactured using mammalian cell culture rather than the traditional fertilized chicken eggs, the first adjuvanted flu vaccine, the meningococcal C vaccine used to help curb deadly outbreaks in Canada and the UK, a tetravalent meningococcal vaccine effective against A, C, Y & W strains, and the first vaccine against meningococcus B. In April 2008, Scharschmidt left Novartis to join Hyperion Therapeutics, a bay area biotech startup which was in early phase development of an ammonia lowering agent for patients with urea cycle disorders (UCDs). Within a month of his arrival, Hyperion was downsized. As a member of Hyperion's management team, he was closely involved in taking the company public in 2012 (HPTX, NASDAQ) orchestrated Hyperion's successful secondary stock offering in 2013, and completed the sale of the company to Horizon Pharma in May 2015. Scharschmidt currently serves as Board Member and/or consultant to several biotechnology companies in the US and abroad.  Editorships, awards and patents  Scharschmidt was elected to membership in the American Society for Clinical Investigation (ASCI) at age 36 and was subsequently elected ASCI President. He served from 1987-1992 as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Clinical Investigation (JCI), the official publication of the ASCI. He was also elected to the Association of American Physicians. Scharschmidt served as Associate Editor of Gastroenterology (1981-1986), Associate Editor of the textbook Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease, (5th, 6th and 7th Editions) and as Editor of the Pocket Clinician textbook on Internal Medicine. He has received the Western Gastroenterological Association Research Award (1988), the University of Toronto Sheila Sherlock Research Award (1991), was 1998 Honoree of the American Liver Foundation Northern CA Division's Salute to Excellence, and was named 2010 Distinguished Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine Alumnus of the year. Scharschmidt is inventor or co-inventor on multiple US (Patent Nos. 5,308,833, 8,404,215, 8,642,012, 9,095,559, 13,610,580,) and international patients with multiple patents pending.  Publications  Scharschmidt has authored over 200 research and review articles. The clinical trials designed under Scharschmidt have resulted in over 20 publications. They address not only with the performance characteristics of RAVICTI, but also the use of blood and urine metabolites for drug dosing and the optimal timing and target levels for blood ammonia in patients with urea cycle disorders so as to minimize the risk and frequency of hyperammonemic crises,. Bruce's team at Hyperion also designed and executed a large randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial which demonstrated that lowering ammonia in patients with cirrhosis complicated by hepatic encephalopathy (HE) decreases the risk and frequency of HE episodes. These findings, which were presented at the plenary session of American Association for the Study of Liver Disease, established that ammonia is not just a correlate, but a cause of HE and, as with UCDs, established the optimal timing and target levels for blood ammonia in cirrhotics so as to minimize their risk and frequency of HE episodes. He also helped define the natural history of HE as well as methodology for its diagnosis  Service and non-profit  As ASCI President, Scharschmidt initiated and obtained industry and NSF funding for a High School Science Teacher Summer Scholarship Program, which paired science teachers with ASCI mentors so as to enable them to teach science as the exciting discipline of discovery. Bruce has served on the National Board of Directors of the American Liver Foundation, on the External Advisory Board for the Clinical Translational Science Award at Northwestern/Feinberg School of Medicine, where he also served as President of the Medical Alumni Association Board from 2015 to 2017. He has chaired the Translational Team of the Gladstone Institutes, where he is also a member of the President's Council. He ran in the 2005 and 2006 Boston Marathons and participated in the 2008 Mt. Shasta Climb to raise funds for the American Liver Foundation, organized with his son in 2009 the “Biking For Burma’s Malnourished” bike ride from Central Thailand to the Burma Border to raise money for Global Health Access Program, and in 2010 co-founded the ‘Cure the Cycle Challenge’ for the National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation in which he participated as a rider from 2010 through 2015.

She was the daughter of the surgeon William Leurs (ca 1753-1801) and Maria Anthonia Bergman (d. 1802). Leurs worked as a governess, and successfully managed her own girls school in Utrecht from 1833. In 1836, large amounts of false printed banknotes circulated in the Netherlands. The banknotes were traced to Leurs, who were trialed in 1837. She denied the accusation and claimed the notes were given to her by a bank clerk. She was charged with having manufactured the banknotes herself to distribute to uneducated people who would not observe her handwriting on them, and the prosecutor demanded death penalty on the grounds that she could have caused a financial crisis. Her defense attorney, however, claimed that the spelling errors on the false notes could not be expected from the hand of a school teacher, that she did not have time to manufacture them and that her school was successful and highly regarded and that she did not have an economic reason to engage in forgery. Hendrica Leurs was acquitted from charges, but she was unable to keep her school and emigrated to the Dutch East Indies, where she opened a school in Surakarta.

He was convicted for the December 10, 2003, murders of his mother and brother by gunman Chris Brashear and sentenced to death in March 2007. On February 22, 2018, 45 minutes before the scheduled execution at 6:00 pm, Whitaker had his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment without parole by Governor Greg Abbott, the first time Governor Abbott has done so. He currently resides in the McConnell Unit in Beeville, Texas, in solitary confinement.  Background  Whitaker had enlisted Chris Brashear to carry out the murders and Steven Champagne to be the getaway driver. Whitaker's father Kent was shot but survived. Whitaker fled to Mexico in the Summer of 2004 following a tip-off that he would shortly be arrested for the murders. He lived there for over a year under the false name of Rudy Ríos. On September 15, 2005, a capital murder warrant was issued against Whitaker. Cooperating with US authorities, Mexican authorities arrested Whitaker without incident under immigration charges. In September 2005 Whitaker was handed over to US authorities at the border town of Laredo, Texas, where he was arrested for capital murder. The State of Texas executes by overdosing the condemned with pentobarbital from a compounding pharmacy and Whitaker's defense lawyers had claimed the state's first two executions of 2018 were botched because of old lethal injection drugs. Whitaker withdrew his appeal pending at the Supreme Court of the United States, pertaining to the purity of the drug used in Texas executions, just before the Governor granted clemency and commuted his sentence. In a rare decision on February 20, 2018, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously recommended that the death sentence be commuted to life imprisonment. The recommendation from the seven-member panel was sent to Republican Governor Greg Abbott. Abbott accepted their recommendation, and commuted Whitaker's death sentence, noting that Whitaker had \\"voluntarily and forever waived any and all claims to parole in exchange for a commutation of his sentence from death to life without the possibility of parole\\". Abbott cited the fact that Whitaker did not fire the gun and that his father Kent \\"insists that he would be victimized again if the state put to death his last remaining immediate family member\\", as the reasons for the commutation. Whitaker responded to the commutation of his sentence by saying, \\"I am thankful for this decision, not for me but for my dad\\". In 2012, Whitaker had previously stated his strong opposition to the idea of life without the possibility for parole, and wrote in his blog from prison: Early life Whitaker attended Clements High School, but had to leave as a result of burglaries he had committed with other students. As a result, he was evaluated by a psychologist who stated that he was \\"experiencing the clinical symptoms of a delusional (paranoid) disorder\\". Whitaker had previously recruited others in a plot to murder his family in 2001 which ended up being aborted. At the trial, one of the recruits from 2001 said that he had contacted the Sugar Land Police Department with information about the previous plot when he heard about the murders in 2003. This individual was given immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying for the prosecution against Whitaker. A 2009 psychological evaluation of Whitaker noted that after high school he was given, \\"More of the unearned trappings of wealth\\" while his thoughts became even more disorganized. Whitaker's affluent parents had bought him several luxury vehicles and paid for his tuition at Baylor University and Sam Houston State University. They also bought him a lakeside townhouse in Willis, Texas, and a $4,000 Rolex watch was given to him as a graduation present hours before the murders, despite the fact that he was not enrolled at college at the time. Whitaker also had access to an $80,000 trust fund from his grandparents, although he testified in court that he did not know he could access it. He had dropped out of university but did not notify his parents. Murders On December 10, 2003, Whitaker falsely told his family that he had just taken his final exams and would soon be graduating from Sam Houston State University. They drove to the nearby Pappadeaux restaurant in Stafford for a celebratory dinner. Meanwhile Chris Brashear, dressed in black, including a ski mask, had entered the Whitaker family home, taken Kevin's gun and ammunition from a locked box in his room, staged a burglary, and then waited near the front door for the Whitaker family to return home. Upon returning home, but before entering the house, Thomas said that he needed to collect his cell phone from his parked Yukon, knowing that Brashear was armed and waiting inside to kill his family. Thomas' brother Kevin entered the family home first and reportedly smiled when he saw the masked Brashear. Brashear shot Kevin once through his chest and he fell to the floor. Patricia was also shot in the chest and fell to the floor. Kent rushed in and was shot in the shoulder with the bullet shattering his humerus. Thomas then ran inside and staged a struggle with Brashear, getting shot in his left arm to divert suspicion. Brashear then exited through the Whitakers' back door and jumped the fence into the rear neighbour's yard. Kevin died within minutes of being shot. Patricia died shortly after being airlifted by Life Flight service on the way to Memorial Hermann Hospital. Thomas told First Responders that he thought the gunman was black, in order to divert suspicion away from Brashear. Kent survived the murder attempt. Conviction At his trial in March 2007, prosecutors alleged that although it wasn't Whitaker who shot his family members, he was responsible for the murders because he played the leading part in the conspiracy to commit murder. Whitaker was refused a plea bargain by the District Attorney in return for his admission of guilt and was tried for capital murder. The prosecution claimed that Whitaker had wanted his family dead so he could capitalize on a million-dollar life insurance payout. Whitaker denies this and says that the only life insurance policy the family had was for $50,000 on his father's life. Whitaker claims that a mental disorder, exacerbated by drug abuse, caused him to want his family eliminated. Kent Whitaker had already forgiven his son for his part in the murders and had tried to persuade the jury not to deliver a death sentence. However, the jury decided to convict Whitaker of capital murder under the Texas law of parties. Chris Brashear received a life sentence in a plea bargain worked out with prosecutors and Steven Champagne received 15 years in return for being the main witness for the prosecution. Appeals Whitaker appealed his death sentence on the grounds of the ineffectiveness of his trial counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, the arbitrariness of the death penalty punishment and the cruelty of the lethal injection, in violation of the eighth amendment to the U.S. constitution prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment. In April 2017, his appeal against prosecutorial misconduct was dismissed by the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. On October 10, 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider an appeal based on his claims that his trial lawyer was deficient and that Fort Bend County prosecutors engaged in misconduct by improperly referring to discussion of a plea deal that never was reached. The justices provided no explanation for their refusal. On November 1, 2017, his death warrant was signed, scheduling his execution for February 22, 2018. Whitaker stated that his father, Kent, would have been revictimized by his execution. Kent Whitaker, the only surviving victim of the crime, wrote a book about the murders titled Murder by Family detailing his forgiveness for his son's actions. Kent also wrote to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles asking for clemency for his son, and the Chairman of the Board met with him for half an hour. The Board unanimously recommended clemency to Governor Greg Abbott. Thomas Whitaker and other inmates initiated an unsuccessful class action suit against the conditions on Texas death row where inmates are kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. Writing He has contributed to Solitary Watch where he wrote about the effects of solitary confinement on himself and other death row inmates. He also contributed to Hell Is a Very Small Place: Voices from Solitary Confinement. He won prizes in PEN America's prison writing contests for \\"Hell's Kitchen\\", \\"Manufacturing Anomie\\" and the essay \\"A Nothing Would Do as Well\\". He was named a PEN America Writing for Justice Fellow in 2018 for writing about incarceration and criminal justice in the United States. In 2007, he founded an inmate blog, entitled Minutes Before Six which publishes articles, poetry and art from inmates held in prisons in the United States, maintained by volunteers. Texas inmates are typically executed at 6:00p.m. in the Huntsville Unit. Whitaker received a Bachelor of Arts in English and Sociology from Adams State University, and a Master of Arts degree in English from California State University, Dominguez Hills while on death row.

Work  = Organizational ecology = Hannan and John H. Freeman were the first to formulate an explicit organizational theory about population ecology with the 1977 article in the American Journal of Sociology, which was the seminal work in the field of organizational ecology. This article proposed: :... [a] population ecology perspective on organization-environment relations... as an alternative to the dominant adaptation perspective. The strength of inertial pressures on organizational structure suggests the application of models that depend on competition and selection in populations of organizations. Several such models, as well as issues arising in attempts to apply them to the organization-environment problem, are discussed.Hannan & Freeman (1977, 929) The scope of their organizational ecology theory ranged from birth of new organizations (organizational founding), organizational growth and organizational change, to the death of organizations (firm mortality). Organizations compete in their environment, where processes like natural selection rule.  Selected publications  * Hannan, Michael T., and Glenn R. Carroll.

Life He unofficially became the vizier of Seljuk Empire after the death of Malik-Shah. Taj al-Mulk was from an old noble family of Fars region. Not much is known about his life before his post in Seljuq government, but his biographers praised him for his competence, knowledge and fluency, which shows he had enough education. He was at first, in service of Imad al-Dowla Sawtekin, a local Seljuq amir. Impressed by Taj al-Mulk's competency, the amir introduced him to the Seljuq Sultan and he entered the court. Vizier Judging by the primary sources, it seems that he intended to become the vizier from the beginning. After gaining the support of Terkan Khatun, he built a tomb for Shaykh Abu Ishaq-i Shirazi, and a school in Baghdad (known as Madrasa-i Tajiya) in order to gain some support from the masses. He slowly and carefully started his opposition to Nizam al-Mulk. Helped by some other courtiers, his goal was to depose Nizam al-Mulk, though Nizam al-Mulk didn't take them seriously, and the Sultan himself wasn't able to depose Nizam al-Mulk. He finally gained a chance to increase the disagreements between Nizam al-Mulk and the Sultan. Although both Nizam al- Mulk and the Sultan were in agreement about the future Sultan, Barkiyaruq, Taj al-Mulk supported Mahmoud, the child of Terkan Khatun. Isma'ili Some primary sources such as Abd al-Jalil Qazvini Razi claimed that he was an Isma'ili and mentioned an story about his pact with Hassan-i Sabbah, which explain his enmity toward Nizam al-Mulk. Beside that, Nizam al-Mulk warned Sultan about \\"those who hide their true goals and intend to depose the vizier and the Abbasid Caliph\\" in his work, Siyasatnama. He was responsible to deliver Sultan Malik-Shah's harsh letter to Nizam al-Mulk, which Nizam al-Mulk answered with harsh words as well. Malik-Shah, angry of Nizam al-Mulk's harsh words, and was preparing himself for a travel to Baghdad. When they reached Nahavand, Nizam al-Mulk was assassinated by an Isma'ili agent. Primary sources explicitly mentioned that the assassination of Nizam al-Mulk was orchestrated by Taj al-Mulk, making it likely that Malik-Shah was aware of it. The deposition of Nizam al-Mulk was a win for both Tarkan Khatun and her supporters, as well as the Isma'ilis who enjoyed the support of Taj al-Mulk. When the Sultan reached Baghdad, Taj al-Mulk prohibited the soldiers from entering the houses of Baghdad's population and looting the city. He also bought ten days for al-Muqtadi, who had to leave the city at the order of Malik-Shah. But the subsequent events weren't in favor of Taj al-Mulk. Malik- Shah suddenly died only a mouth and a few days after the death of Nizam al- Mulk. In the following civil war between Barkiyaruq (the official heir) and Malik-Ismail (supported by Tarkan Khatun), the latter was defeated in a battle near Boroujerd. Taj al-Mulk was arrested, and Barkiyaruq (who was aware of his competency) at first decided to grant him the post of viziership, but he was assassinated by the supporters of Nizam al-Mulk who considered him responsible for the death of Nizam al-Mulk. Of Persian descent, he was unoffially the vizier of Seljuk Empire for not more than 7 months.

Overview  Ernst August Künnecke returned to the club five years after he was sacked in 1985. He took over from Urs Siegenthaler as first-team coach. After missing promotion the previous two seasons, the club's repeated priority aim was to return to the top flight of Swiss football. Basel were assigned to the South East group. They ended their 22 matches in the Qualifying Phase with 9 victories, 8 draws and 5 defeats with 26 points in a disappointing fourth position in the league table. The team scored 40 goals and conceded 30. Basel qualified for a Promotion group and were assigned to group A. Also qualified for this group from the Nationalliga B were Chiasso, Yverdon-Sports, Fribourg, Baden and Etoile Carouge. Fighting against their relegation from the Nationalliga A were St. Gallen and Wettingen. Basel ended their 14 matches in the Promotion/Relegation Phase with just four victories, four draws, suffering six defeats with 12 points in a very disappointing fourth position in the league table and missed promotion again. In the Swiss Cup second round Basel were drawn with an away game against lower tier local club FC Pratteln. Basel were sent home suffering an embarrassing 4–0 defeat.

Since 1992, the foundation has been recognized as a \\"public utility\\" (French: Déclaration d'utilité publique).  History  Bardot's initial involvement with animal rights was in 1962, after seeing photographs of the conditions in which animals were killed. Upon this, Bardot immediately began advocating against the use of painful electric shock pistols in slaughterhouses,Initiales B.B., éditions Grasset. and became a vegetarian. In 1967, Bardot was received at the Élysée Palace where she met with Charles de Gaulle, the then president of France. It was a few years later that Bardot obtained the \\"stunning before slaughter\\" rights from the government. In 1977, Bardot went on to campaign against the hunting of baby Harp seals. Upon invitation from Paul Watson, of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Bardot embarked on a five day trip to the ice fields in Blanc-Sablon, Canada, receiving significant media attention. In addition, the trip also gained Bardot the support of French president, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, leading to changes regarding the import of seal products. The Brigitte Bardot Foundation (La Fondation Brigitte Bardot) was launched by Bardot in Saint-Tropez, in 1986 where she auctioned her jewellery and other personal possessions to raise 3 million French francs for her campaigns and activities. In 1988, the organization moved to Paris. It was here that Bardot led a television series entitled S.O.S. Animaux. The show aired from 1989 through 1992, over which time it spread its purpose of influencing public opinion of animal cruelty. In 1991, Bardot donated her Saint Tropez property, La Madrague to the foundation so as to raise the capital required to obtain a declaration of public utility. The declaration was granted on February 21, 1992, by the Conseil d'État. In 1995, the Dalai Lama became an honorary member of the foundation. The Foundation celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2006. It reached 75,000 members by the year 2014.  Activities  The foundation has helped create shelters for elephants in South Africa, koalas in Australia, dancing bears in Bulgaria, and primates in Cameroon. It has also reintroduced several animal species that had completely disappeared in Senegal and participated in the reintroduction of wolves to the Alps. A mobile veterinary clinic has also been created for the Eastern Bloc countries. The foundation is a regular plaintiff in lawsuits against animal cruelty. In January 2016, to support the proposition of a law to ban force-feeding on ducks and geese, the foundation invited Pamela Anderson to speak at the French National Assembly. While funding other French animal shelters, the foundation has also created its own shelter, La Mare Anzou, located in a ruined mansion in the department of Eure in Normandy. It covers several hectares, where 200 dogs and 250 cats wait for adoption. This shelter is also a \\"retirement home\\" for several horses, cows, etc. After complaints from local residents about noise nuisance threatened to close the shelter in 2009, the foundation began soundproofing construction, investing 3 million euros to date. Brigitte Bardot and Christophe Marie in 2006.On 23 December 2006, Brigitte Bardot published a letter to Nicolas Sarkozy in the Foundation's newsletter, L'info-journal (published every trimester since 1992), condemning the practice of the Eid al-Adha in France. This caused her be charged with and later fined for incitement to racial hatred. In 2009, the foundation launched a campaign against hippophagy titled Le cheval vous l'aimez comment? ( \\"The horse, how do you like it?\\"). The foundation was banned from the Salon du Cheval (Paris Horse Show), the organizers of the event stating, \\"This is not a place to develop a view point on hippophagy\\". In the winter of this year, the foundation launched Fourrure : signe extérieur de cruauté (\\"Fur : external sign of cruelty\\"), a national campaign of posters and television spots against fur. The French fur association attempted to ban these advertisements, without success. In December 2005, a new communication campaign Fourrure, le look qui tue (\\"Fur, the look that kills\\") was launched in France. The foundation has also supported the yearly \\"day without fur,\\" on every first Saturday of winter sales since 2007. In 2011, the boat \\"MV Brigitte Bardot,\\" co-financed by the foundation and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society of Paul Watson, was damaged by a wave. It was repaired and put back on the water the next year. In 2015, it was exhibited in Paris after a campaign in the Faroe Islands to save the cetaceans.  Objectives  The Fondation Brigitte Bardot campaign fought against: *The captivity of wild animals (circuses and zoos) *The cruelty of fur *Hippophagy *Transportation of butchery animals *Animal testing *Hunting and poaching *Blood sports (bullfighting and cockfights) *Pet abandonment and action against pet stores *Sterilization of wandering dogs and cats (especially in Eastern Europe) *Whaling and seal hunting  See also  *Brigitte Bardot *Animal rights *Animal welfare  References   External links  *Official website Animal welfare organizations based in France Organizations established in 1986 Brigitte Bardot Organizations based in Paris ","title":"Fondation Brigitte Bardot"},{"id":"53384759","text":"The Alayto le Boyna or Siyyarou is a mountain range in Djibouti.

She is known for her large paintings incorporating neon lighting tubes. Her work is featured in museums and galleries including the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Brooklyn Museum, Museum of Modern Art, and the High Museum of Art. Weatherford's solo exhibitions include Mary Weatherford: From the Mountain to the Sea at Claremont McKenna College, I've Seen Gray Whales Go By at Gagosian West, and Like The Land Loves the Sea at David Kordansky Gallery, Los Angeles. Her work has been part of group exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art and the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University. Life and career Weatherford was born in Ojai, California and raised in Los Angeles. She studied visual arts and art history at Princeton University, graduating in 1984. After graduation, she lived and worked in New York where in 1985 she was a Helena Rubinstein Fellow in the Independent Study Program of the Whitney Museum of American Art. She returned to Southern California in 1999 and later received an M.F.A. from the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College. Early in her career she also collaborated with her late sister, the writer Margaret Weatherford, on performance art and worked as a bookkeeper for the artist Mike Kelley. A career breakthrough came in 2012 with Weatherford's Bakersfield Project exhibition at the Todd Madigan Gallery at California State University at Bakersfield where she was an artist in residence. The Bakersfield paintings marked the first time she incorporated illuminated neon light tubes into her abstract paintings. The series was inspired by the colourful neon signs she saw on old restaurant and factory buildings while driving around Bakersfield. Weatherford used neon in the Bakersfield Project and later series of paintings, such as Manhattan (2013), Los Angeles (2014) and Train Yard (2016–2020) to recreate the sensations of specific places or moments. In an interview for Gagosian Quarterly she once said, ‘I try to depict or deliver not only a visual translation of a place in time, but with that, the scent, the sound, and the feeling. Is it chilly? Is it hot? Is there a clanging sound?’ Her work was included in the exhibitions Variations: Conversations in and Around Abstract Painting at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2014. That same year she received the $25,000 Artist Award from the Artists' Legacy Foundation founded by Viola Frey. Examples of Weatherford's abstract paintings incorporating neon lights are held by the Museum of Modern Art, the Hirshhorn Museum, and the Hammer Museum. Another of her neon paintings, Past Sunset (2015), was shown at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in the 2016 exhibition NO MAN'S LAND: Women Artists from the Rubell Family Collection. Three examples of her early work combining acrylic, ink and screen print are held by the Brooklyn Museum: Madame Butterfly (1989), Violetta (1991), and First Riddle (1991).

Description  A Game of Tric-Trac offers an insight into seventeenth century Dutch nightlife as well as the codes surrounding prostitution and morality. Backgammon, which was commonly called tric-trac, was a popular pastime during Leyster's lifetime, depicted in paintings by many of her contemporaries. While there is often a woman present in these pieces, besides one print by Jacob Matham, none of them depict her as having an active role in the game. Leyster's painting is interesting then because the woman in it appears to the opposing player. Leyster signals this to the viewer with her placement of the oil lamp, which would have been placed on one side of the board (the \\"inner table\\") between the two players.  Role of Prostitution  Compared to other paintings and prints of her time, such as A Game of Tric-Trac in an Inn by Remigius Hogenberg, Leyster's identification of the woman in her painting as a prostitute is not as obvious. While she holds a glass of wine (a symbol which may have codified her profession) her clothing is more modest and domestic. It is, however, the lit pipe which she hands to her opposer which gives away her occupation. During Leyster's life time pijpen or \\"to pipe/to smoke a pipe\\" would have had explicit sexual connotations. A similar idea is found in Jacob Cats' Spiegel van den Ouwden en Niewen in the section \\"Whores and their sly tricks\\" which depicts a prostitute handing her client a brazier of hot coals instead of a pipe. However both Leyster's painting and the emblem in Cats' book can be read through its accompanying verse \\"Thus I am in danger where I put my fingers; your coal as does your maidenhead - it burns or it infects\\" condemning both the courtesan and her male client. Some critics, such as Cynthia Kartnehorst-Von Borgendorf Rupprath argue that Leyster's work drives this point home as the man in the painting breaks the fourth wall looking at the viewer as if asking his or her involvement in his decision.  Style  Leyster's choice to have this exchange take place at night with candlelight both adds an air of suspense and intrigue and showcases her mastery of and interest in lighting and shadows. While some scholars have argued that this emphasis on lighting brings to mind Leyster's potential influence from the Utrecht Caravaggisti others emphasize the painting's similarity in composition to her husband, Jan Miense Molenaer's early work Card Players by Lamplight. While both paintings employ similar lighting and idleness, the most convincing similarity is the mirrored image of Leyster's cavalier to the figure in Molenaer's foreground.

Background  Dou Zhengu was born in 892, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. He was from Baishui (白水, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). His father Dou Zhuan () would subsequently serve as a consultant in the imperial government of Later Tang. Dou Zhengu himself was said to be capable in writing even in his youth.History of Song, vol. 262.  During Later Tang  Dou Zhengu passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class during the Tongguang era (923-926) of Later Tang's founding emperor Li Cunxu, and he was made the secretary general for Wanquan County (萬全, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei). He later left governmental service to observe a mourning period after his mother's death. After the mourning period was over, he was made an assistant to Shi Jingtang the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi).Shi Jingtang was made the military governor of Hedong by Li Cunxu's successor and adoptive brother Li Siyuan, who was Shi's father-in-law, in 932; therefore, Dou's commission as Shi's assistant must have come after that point. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. Shi considered Dou to be an honest official, and thus viewed him highly.  During Later Jin  = During Shi Jingtang's reign = In 936, Shi Jingtang, with aid from the Khitan Empire, rebelled against then-Later Tang emperor Li Congke (Li Siyuan's adoptive son and Shi's brother-in-law) and established Later Jin. In his nascent government, he made Dou Zhengu an imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. as well as Hubu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of census (戶部, Hubu). He then gave Dou the greater title of Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). Not long after, with Khitan help, Shi destroyed Later Tang and took over its territory. In 938, Shi encouraged his officials to submit secret proposals to improve his governance. Dou submitted a petition in which he suggested that the imperial officials be required to submit recommendations for people to be commissioned, pointing out that at that time, the Later Jin government lacked capable officials and thus such recommendations were necessary for good governance. He further suggested that the promotions and demotions of recommending officials be tied to the performance of those that they recommended. Shi was very pleased with his proposal and made it law. In 939, Shi made Dou the deputy chief imperial censor (御史中丞, Yushi Zhongcheng), and ordered him, along with the minister of ceremony Cui Zhuo (), the deputy minister of justice Lü Qi (), and the deputy minister of rites Zhang Yuntong (), to draft regulations for imperial gatherings, as well as music and dance appropriate for such ceremonies. Later in Shi's reign, Dou served successively as the deputy minister of justice (刑部侍郎, Xingbu Shilang) and then Menxia Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau (門下省, Menxia Sheng). During his service under Shi, he had friendly relations with the major general Liu Zhiyuan. = During Shi Chonggui's reign = During the subsequent reign of Shi Jingtang's adoptive son (biological nephew) Shi Chonggui, Dou initially served as the minister of public works (工部尚書, Gongbu Shangshu), and then the minister of rites (禮部尚書, Libu Shangshu). He was put in charge of the imperial examinations. In the Tang days, the imperial examinations were held not only at day, but also at night (for the duration that it would take to burn through three candles), but in 931 (during Li Siyuan's reign), that custom was changed such that the examinations would only happen during the day. Dou considered the daylight period to be insufficient for the testing, and requested that nighttime examinations be restored. He was also praised for being fair in his administration of the examinations. He was later made the minister of justice (刑部尚書, Xingbu Shangshu), before being sent out of the imperial government to serve as the military prefect (團練使, Tuanlianshi) of Ying Prefecture (潁州, in modern Fuyang, Anhui), where he remained for a year, before being recalled to the imperial government to again serve as minister of justice.  During Later Han  = During Liu Zhiyuan's reign = Around the new year 947, Later Jin was destroyed by Khitan (then known as Liao)'s Emperor Taizong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. Emperor Taizong entered Later Jin's capital Daliang and initially declared himself emperor of China as well. (Dou Zhengu's activities during this period were not clearly stated in traditional histories, although he presumably, along with other Later Jin officials, submitted to the Liao emperor.) Liu Zhiyuan, then the military governor of Hedong, initially postured that he would submit to Liao, but then declared himself emperor (of a new state later known as Later Han). With Liu and many others resisting his rule, Emperor Taizong withdrew from the Central Plains region and died on the way back to Liao proper.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. In the power vacuum, Liu first entered Luoyang, and then headed for Daliang. Dou, along with the other Later Jin officials remaining at Daliang, went to Xingyang (滎陽, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) to welcome him to Daliang, which he subsequently entered.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287. Not long after, Liu requested discussions on how he should establish the imperial temples, in light of the fact that he had claimed ancestry from the Han dynasty imperial clan and honored Emperor Guangwu of Han as a distant ancestor. Dou proposed that it would be appropriate to establish six temples, with Emperor Gao of Han and Emperor Guangwu serving as the two most honored ancestors, and Liu's own four generations of ancestors in the other four temples. Liu followed his proposal, and thereafter made him the minister of civil service affairs (吏部尚書, Libu Shangshu, note not the same as minister of rites). Later in the year, finding that having two chancellors (Su Fengji and Su Yugui) was not sufficient, he resolved to commission at least one more chancellor. Su Fengji recommended Li Tao, but as Liu respected Dou, he decided to make both Li and Dou chancellors with the title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), with Dou receiving the additional titles of Menxia Shilang, Sikong (司空, one of the Three Excellencies), and grand imperial scholar at Hongwen Pavilion. In early 948, Liu Zhiyuan fell deathly ill. He entrusted his son Liu Chengyou to Su Fengji, Yang Bin, Shi Hongzhao, and Guo Wei, and then died. Liu Chengyou thereafter took the throne. = During Liu Chengyou's reign = During Liu Chengyou's administration, there was a split of authorities among the high level officials. Yang Bin oversaw the governmental operations; Guo Wei oversaw military operations; Shi Hongzhao oversaw the imperial guards; and Wang Zhang oversaw the financial agencies. Su Fengji, Su Yugui, and Dou Zhengu served as chancellors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289. It was said, however, that Dou was only able to be elegant and upright in his behavior, and was unable to curb the power-grabbing of Yang, Shi, and Wang. In 949, after Guo defeated the rebellion of the major general Li Shouzhen, Guo declined to be individually rewarded, so the other high-level officials and regional governors were all rewarded. As part of the rewards, Dou was given the title of Situ (司徒, also one of the Three Excellencies).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. In summer 950, an incident occurred to damage the relationship between the leading officials. They had discussed and resolved that, because of frequent Liao incursions and the inability for the circuits to coordinate their defenses, Guo Wei should be sent to Yedu (鄴都, in modern Handan, Hebei) to serve as its defender (as well as the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered at Yedu) to coordinate the defense against Liao. Shi advocated that Guo be allowed to continue to retain his title as chief of staff to allow him to give orders to the military governors. Su Fengji opposed, pointing out that there had been no precedent to allow a military governor to continue to retain chief of staff title. Eventually, Liu Chengyou approved Shi's proposal. When Shi then complained to Su about his opposition, Su responded, \\"Letting the central government control the outlying circuits is proper. How can it be that now you are letting an outlying circuit control the central government?\\" It was at the send-off dinner for Guo the next day, at Dou's mansion, that frictions within the imperial government came to the forefront. At the feast, Shi, when toasting Guo, spoke in a harsh voice, \\"How could there have been opposition when we discussed this matter yesterday at the imperial gathering? Now, let us drink, younger brother [(i.e., Guo)]!\\" Su and Yang also raised their cups and stated, \\"This is an important matter for the state. Do not bear grudges!\\" Shi responded, again in a harsh voice, \\"To settle the state, it takes long spears and large swords. What use does the ink brush have?\\" Wang Zhang, the director of the financial agencies, responded, \\"Without ink brushes, where does money come from?\\" It was said that from this point on, there were increasing tension between generals and chancellors. By winter 950, Liu Chengyou himself had tired of the control the senior officials had on his government, even though, under Yang's leadership, the imperial government was considered well-run. He conspired with his uncle Li Ye (), as well as his favorite attendants Nie Wenjin (), Hou Kuangzan (), and Guo Yunming (), to kill Yang and the others. Soon thereafter, they surprised and killed Yang, Shi, and Wang. Guo Wei's and Wang Jun's families were slaughtered, leading to Guo's rising at Yedu, taking his army south, and heading toward Daliang. Hearing that Guo was approaching, Liu Chengyou, in fear, commented to Dou, \\"Maybe I was being too frivolous.\\" Despite this realization, he did not accept his mother Empress Dowager Li's advice to try to maintain a pretense of emperor-subject relations with Guo Wei; rather, commissioning Liu Zhiyuan's half-brother Murong Yanchao as the commander of the imperial troops, he decided to confront Guo Wei personally. He took the three chancellors (Su Fengji, Su Yugui, and Dou) with him. Around the new year 951, Guo's army and the imperial army confronted each other, and the imperial troops were defeated; most of the generals surrendered to Guo Wei. Thereafter, Liu Chengyou was killed in the confusion, and Su Fengji committed suicide. Su Yugui and Dou hid themselves, but after Guo entered Daliang, he located them and restored them to their chancellor positions. Guo initially postured that he would support Liu Zhiyuan's adoptive son (biological nephew) Liu Yun the military governor of Wuning Circuit (武寧, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) to succeed to the Later Han throne. However, before Liu Yun would arrive at Daliang, with news that came that there was a Liao incursion, Guo headed north, ostensibly to defend against it, while leaving the matters of state at Daliang to Dou, Su Yugui, and Wang Jun, and military matters to Wang Yin (). Shortly after Guo left Daliang, his soldiers rose and supported him as emperor. He thereafter returned to Daliang and claimed the throne, establishing Later Zhou. (He put Liu Yun under house arrest, and thereafter had Liu Yun killed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290.)  During Later Zhou  Shortly after Guo Wei took the throne, he bestowed on Dou Zhengu the greater chancellor title of Shizhong (). Not long after, with the senior statesman Feng Dao becoming a chancellor again, Dou was put in charge of editing imperial histories. Not long after, he was removed from his chancellor position, carrying only now his title as Situ, and was created the Duke of Yi. In 954, by which time Guo Wei had died and been succeeded by his adoptive son Guo Rong, the chancellor Fan Zhi was given the title of Situ. As a result, Dou was effectively forced into retirement, and took up residence at Luoyang. The local government considered his household to be a regular household and did not exempt it from either taxes or conscripted labor. Dou went to see the defender of Luoyang, Xiang Xun (), to request to be exempted, but Xiang did not listen to him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 292.  During Song  After the Later Zhou throne was seized by the general Zhao Kuangyin, who established Song dynasty as its Emperor Taizu, Dou Zhengu was summoned back to the imperial court given his prior status as one of the Three Excellencies. He went to see Fan Zhi, who had remained a chancellor under the new Song emperor, requesting that he be given an honorary post as an advisor to the Crown Prince so that he could attend imperial meetings. Fan paid his request no heed and did not report it to the emperor. He thus returned to Luoyang. There, he spent his days visiting the mountains and the rivers, in the company of commoners and prostitutes, drinking and enjoying their company. In 969, he became ill, and he authored his own tombstone text before dying.

Carbon-14 dating indicated activity in the time range of 1412–1308 BC and suggested that the gallery and outer wall were constructed in Early Bronze Age, with later enhancements. Evidence of cremated burial was found in several areas of the main chamber, as well as worked flint and scrapers. Also found were a spindle whorl and two glass beads. Three lots of cremated bone were found in the chamber but two were too small for meaningful interpretation. The third, in a pit towards the rear, was probably a 60-70-year-old female. The tomb was excavated and partially restored in 1957. Some cremated bones were found during the excavation, located towards the end of the gallery.

She is known as the victim of a famous case of kidnapping and rape in the Netherlands in 1515. The case was widely famed in the contemporary Netherlands, where it was published and popular within literature: it was also the subject of a song, where Catharina de Grebber was described as a rabbit persecuted by a hunter. Catharina de Grebber was the daughter of the wealthy shipper Pieter Claeszoon Grebber and Alyt van Tetrode in Leiden. In 1509, at the age of thirteen, she was abducted by the nobleman Gerrit van Raaphorst and four accomplices on her way to church with her father in Wassenaar. Raaphorst took her to Sassenheim, where he married her. During this period, she was reportedly raped and locked up. Four months later, she returned to her parents. When Raaphorst wished to have her returned, her parents sued him for forcing her to marry him. Raaphorst claimed that both the marriage and intercourse were voluntary. The court case continued for years, until 1515, when Raaphorst was judged guilty for rape and sentenced to a public walk of repentance and to pay for a painted window in the church. Raaphorst was executed for the murder of a man in 1524. The life of Catharina de Grebber after 1515 is not known.

Active in Germany and the United States between the years 1921 and 1977, she was regarded for her work on psychosomatic medicine, women's psychosexual development, sexual dysfunction, and family relationships. She was a faculty and staff member of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis from 1936 to 1969. Early life and education Therese Friedmann was born in Eger, Hungary, to a traditional Jewish family. Her parents were Ignatius Friedmann and Charlotte Link Friedmann, and she had one brother and two sisters. When she was six years old, her family moved to Budapest. She was the only one of her siblings to receive a university education, graduating from the University of Budapest with a doctorate in medicine in 1916. She was a participant of the Galileo Circle.Judit Meszaros, 'Ferenczi and Beyond. Exile of the Budapest School and Solidarity in the Psychoanalytic Movement During the Nazi Years', Routledge, 2014, p.68. Career Benedek initially decided to pursue a career in child psychology and study the effects of maternal separation on infant emotions. She completed the requirements for a residency in pediatrics in 1918 and began working as an assistant physician at the St. Elizabeth University pediatric clinic in Bratislava. She left this position in 1919 and married shortly afterward. Having taken courses from Hungarian psychoanalyst Sándor Ferenczi, an associate of Sigmund Freud, during her university days, she decided to switch her career track to psychoanalysis. She underwent a five-month training analysis with Ferenczi before leaving Budapest. In 1920 she and her new husband relocated to Germany to escape the political upheaval in Hungary. In 1920 she became an assistant physician at the Neurological-Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Leipzig and in 1921 opened the city's first private psychoanalytic practice, becoming a training analyst. From 1933 to 1935 she was a training and supervisory analyst at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute. Although as a Jew she was a target of the Nazi Party in Germany in the mid-1930s, Benedek did not feel the need to emigrate, since she considered herself a Hungarian rather than a Jew. Nevertheless, in 1936 her husband convinced her to leave Germany and accept the offer of Franz Alexander to work as a training analyst for the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. She was a faculty and staff member, engaging in teaching, supervising, and research at the institute, for the next 34 years. She acquired her U.S. medical license in 1937 and her U.S. citizenship in 1943. Her husband joined the faculty of Northwestern University School of Medicine. Research Benedek is said to have \\"played a central role in the development of psychoanalysis in the United States\\". Influenced by the theories of hysteria promulgated by Freud, her early research had sought a link between psychological and endocrinal factors for such problems as anxiety, aggression, and diabetes. In the United States, working with endocrinologist Boris B. Rubinstein, she conducted extensive studies on the correlation between ovulation and female emotions, resulting in the 1942 book The Sexual Cycle in Women. Benedek explored a link between the estrogen/progesterone cycle and a woman's desire to engage in sexual intercourse, nurture a pregnancy, and raise children. She also described the \\"modern\\" woman's struggle with her natural maternal role. Benedek's analysis of the \\"un-motherly modern mother\\" was widely praised and included in psychology and medical teaching manuals. Benedek also studied the effects of gender equality and democracy on relationships between spouses and their children. Her 1949 paper Parenthood as a Developmental Phase: A contribution to the libido theory rejected the prevailing theory that psychological development stopped after adolescence; Benedek maintained that it continued throughout parenthood. She published further research on parenthood, family relationships, and depression into her seventies, and continued seeing patients in private practice after her retirement from the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis in 1969. Affiliations In Germany Benedek was a member of the Berlin Psychoanalytic Society. In the United States she belonged to national and international psychoanalytic organizations and served as president of the Chicago Psychoanalytic Society from 1958 to 1959. On her eightieth birthday in 1972, the Therese Benedek Research Foundation was established in her honor. Personal life In 1919 she married Tibor Benedek, a dermatologist and researcher. She and her husband, a Hungarian Protestant, attended church together regularly. They had one son and one daughter. She died of a heart attack on October 27, 1977, aged 84. Her husband predeceased her by three years. Her papers are stored at the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis. Bibliography =Books= (with Boris Benjamin Rubenstein) (with Joan Fleming) * (with E.

It was discovered on 22 November 1786 by William Herschel, and was described as \\"pretty bright, small, round, stellar\\" by John Louis Emil Dreyer, the compiler of the New General Catalogue. NGC 1140 is a starburst galaxy, meaning it is forming stars at a very fast rate. In fact, while it is only a tenth as wide as the Milky Way, it is producing stars at a rate of /yr, about the same as the Milky Way. The image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows bright blue and red regions of star formation, similar to NGC 1569. The starburst is estimated to have begun about 5 million years ago. Its low metallicity (the ratio of hydrogen and helium to other elements) makes NGC 1140 similar to primordial galaxies. Wolf–Rayet stars, a class of blue, massive, and luminous stars, are present in this galaxy; in fact, NGC 1140 has so many of them that their spectra also appear in the galaxy's spectrum.

In addition to the dismissal of Walter Lohmann on 19 January 1928 and the dismissal of the Chief of the Reichsmarine Hans Zenker, on 30 September 1928, it also led to the resignation of the Reichswehr Minister Otto Gessler. Secret Rearmament In early 1923 Captain Walter Lohmann, who had acquired experience in international business, gained command of the Maritime Transport Department of the Navy in October 1920, and whose primary responsibility was logistical matters. With the full confidence and trust of naval chief Admiral Paul Behncke, he was transferred to managing the black funds of the Navy that were generally used for covert funding. It was, initially, proceeds of approximately 100 million gold marks from the illegal sale of ships and submarines scrapped in 1919 and 1920, which actually would have to be scrapped, under requirements of the Treaty of Versailles. In addition Ruhr Funds submitted by the Cabinet without the knowledge of the Parliament, were added to the fund, of which a portion for the marine of 12 million German gold marks, were to be used to prepare for military resistance in the Occupation of the Ruhr crisis. Defense Minister Otto Gessler wrote in his memoirs: The funds for the Ruhr fund were mainly used for the secret sale of weapons, especially in Italy, and for the construction of a tanker fleet. But the activities went far beyond that: * Establishment of a marine intelligence service (), initially to ensure the supply of raw materials. * Development of a modern submarine (among other things with a bubble-free torpedo, see also German Type II submarine) with the help of secret funds of the Friedrich Krupp Ship Yard in Kiel, the AG Weser in Bremen, and Vulcan Shipyard () in Hamburg and Stettin (now Szczecin) and by the Engineers Office for Shipbuilding () in The Hague, Netherlands, which was built on the basis of the mediation of Wilhelm Canaris from 1926 in Cádiz, Spain. * Support for the companies Heinkel, Dornier Flugzeugwerke and Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau in the construction of aeroplanes. * Purchase of the Caspar works, which developed \\"civilian\\" aircraft, whose performance data \\"coincidentally\\" resemble those of military aircraft of other countries. * Severa (seaplane pilot division) to develop aircraft types required by the Navy and to train pilots on Norderney and Kiel- Holtenau. * Travemünde Marina A.G. to the development and maintenance of speedboats.Francis L. Carsten: Reichswehr and Politics, 1918-1933, Cologne 1964, p. 314 * Participation in the founding of Neustädter Slip GmbH as a repair and training company for sport boats and speed boats. * Establishment of the German German High Seasport Association HANSA to promote the offspring of officers for the secret reconstruction of the Reichsmarine. * The yachting school in Neustadt in Holstein, which was well equipped with boats, was made available to the German High Seasport Association HANSA (today DHH). Economic Activities In addition, Lohmann began investing in commercial projects: * Property speculation * Purchase of the Berlin Bacon AG, with which he wanted to dispute the British Speck market to the Danes * Purchase of a private bank shares bank Berliner Bankverein (the bank through which Lohmann financed all activities) * Development of an ice rescue process * Participation in and guarantees for Phoebus-Film AG, (see below) There were various explanations for these non-maritime activities: * They should be indirectly in the interests of the navy, e.g. Berlin Bacon AG's refrigerated vessels could also have been used as troop carriers during the war * They should serve the unobtrusive construction of an agent network * They should conceal the financing of the secret projects * They should replace the lack of funds inflow through economic successOtto Gessler: Reichswehrpolitik in the Weimar period. P. 448 Lohmann, on the other hand, received explanations of honour from all sides, that he had not personally enriched himself. But he was also told that he had been a friend of the Phoebus Director Ernst Hugo Correll and had given his girlfriend Else Ektimov (or Elke Ekimoff) a 12-room apartment and a well-paid job at Phoebus.Berlinische Monatsschrift 6/2000 Since 1924, Lohmann had been involved with Phoebus-Film AG company. In addition to high returns, he also had the goal of being able to place agents in the Phoebus offices abroad without inconspicuous agents. When Phoebus got into trouble, he got her credit from the Girozentrale. He received the signature for the required guarantee only because he presented a further guarantee from the parent company, Lignose AG , which had priority. In fact, he had assured the Lignose, on the other hand, in the name of the empire, that it was not claimed for this guarantee. Later, he signed his own self- sufficient guarantees. When bankruptcy in August was no longer averted, the financing arrangement collapsed. Exposé Kurd Wenkel, an economic journalist of the Berlin daily newspaper, had wondered since the middle of July 1927, through which inflows the company could delay its collapse for so long. After a former Phoebus employee informed him about the Lohmann investments, Wenkel publicly published the scandal in articles on August 8 and 9. He was probably not aware of the real background, but suspected that the state had in the national sense to influence the program and the rental policy of Phoebus, which was not quite unjustified, because in the shallow program of the Phoebus (one does not participate Of love ), a few nautical injections were noticeable (the northbound journey of German warships). The government under Reichskanzler Wilhelm Marx tried to limit the damage. The Wenkel articles were removed from publication under threat of prosecution for treason. The remote economic activities were portrayed as the authority of a subordinate official, and the Phoebus scandal became the Lohmann affair. The secret rearmament activities, and thus the breach of the Treaty of Versailles, could be hushed up. Although the KPD deputy Ernst Schneller in the Reichstag asked very precisely for details of the upgrade program, he was ignored. The Reichstag approved the costs for the settlement of the affair of 26 million RM only after the resignation of Reichswehrminister Otto Gessler on January 19, 1928. On 30 September, Gessler's successor Wilhelm Groener, dismissed the chief of the Reichsmarine, Admiral Hans Zenker, the direct superintendent of Lohmann. Lohmann himself was retired when his pension was abridged, but he was never prosecuted, because the risk of uncovering the true background of the affair would have been too great. Lohmann died completely impoverished three years later of a heart attack. The secret rearmament was not stopped, but extended, but subject to independent and secret control by the Court of Auditors.

He studied Business Management at Marmara University and mastered in design and chromatics at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, before becoming an apprentice to prominent fashion designer Yıldırım Mayruk. Besides being a fashion designer, Şansal is also known as an LGBT rights advocate and an anti-war activist. Barbaros Şansal hosted two TV programmes on Turkish TV channels called “Pin” and “Safety Pin”. He also wrote two books called “Printing Ink Lives on Newsprint” and “Fitting Room”. He translated the book “101 things I Learned in Fashion School” written by Matthew Frederick and Alfredo Cabrera. Şansal gave lectures about the history of fashion at Marmara University and Ankara Baskent University.  Political and legal issues  Şansal at Istanbul gay pride in 2012 Barbaros Şansal took part in the Gezi Park protests in 2013, which took place very close to his offices in Istanbul's Beyoğlu neighbourhood. He was reportedly detained and threatened by police after criticising the police's use of excessive force on Halk TV. In May 2015, Şansal was found in possession of 6 grams of cannabis at Ercan Airport in Cyprus, where he had recently bought a house. Şansal was released on condition that he paid ₺40 thousand bail. He was sentenced to one month in prison in November 2015. On January 1, 2017, while at his residence in North Cyprus, Şansal shared a video on social media in which he criticised Turkish society: \\"While scores of journalists are in prison, while children are sexually harassed, raped, while corruption and bribes are everywhere, while extremists are distributing shit to you in the streets, are you still celebrating the New Year? I am not... Carry on your celebration in disgrace, misery and dirt. Drown in your shit, Turkey.\\" Because of these words, the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus Interior Ministry detained Şansal and deported him to Atatürk Airport by airplane. After landing at the airport, Şansal was physically and verbally attacked by people on the tarmac. After being taken into custody by the police, he was taken to court and was arrested the following day charged with ‘inciting the public to hatred or hostility’ under Article 216 of the Turkish Penal Code. Şansal said that the words he used were \\"a satire against discrimination\\" and did not accept the accusations directed against him. Şansal was released from prison on March 2, 2017, but faces charges of 'insulting the Turkish nation' which carry a penalty of one to three years in prison. Following his release from prison, Şansal wrote about his treatment in prison in a book about his arrest and attempted lynching. Şansal and Mayruk have decided to close their business in Turkey and move to Cyprus.

The game centers around a boy who deals with depression, anxiety, and fear as he embarks on a journey through different locations in search of his dog, Baron. The narrative changes with different pathways and endings depending on how the player interacts with the environment, other characters, and combat system. Each choice or interaction has the potential to change the game by adding dialog, encounters, or interactive objects to the world. An alpha version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in November 2016 on Steam Greenlight. The game was greenlit by the community in ten days and received enough support to reach the top game on the platform for that time period. A beta was then released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in February 2017 along with a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. This campaign was successful within its first 24 hours, and the game is now in development for the final release. Initially scheduled for a full release in December 2017, the game is currently planned to be released in sections; an early access version of the game has been released in December 2018, and content will be added over time through patches.  Gameplay  Heartbound is a role-playing game that borrows many conventions from other gaming genres. Progress is achieved by exploration and player choice, and how the player interacts with the world shapes the story line and the environment for the rest of the play-through. According to the Pirate Software website: \\"Every time you interact with an object, talk to an NPC, forget to turn off a light-switch, take out the trash, or disregard a sparkly bush the game remembers this and will change subtly for all further interactions. The greatest part about this design is that it already works and is in the current builds of the game. Both minor and major differences are going to pop up throughout the game and give the community something to share with one another. Everything you do matters no matter what kind of player you are or choose to be.\\"  Alternate reality game  A series of cryptographic puzzles can be solved outside of Heartbound, accessible from the game's website. These puzzles provide additional lore and offer an alternative narrative parallel to the game. Completing portions of the Alternate reality game (ARG) can foreshadow or unlock additional game content.  Combat  279x279px Heartbound does not use the traditional systems of levels, experience, or consumables; everything is skill-based and combat can change based on the player's actions and relationships with others. Equipment can be found throughout the world, which augments Lore's damage and maximum health. Every enemy has unique mini-games that are not encountered anywhere else in the game. There are no random battles, and a number of encounters are avoidable based on how the player progresses.  Characters  = Home World = * Lore is the main protagonist of Heartbound.

He has the bad habit of never cleaning up his socks, and they can be found nearly everywhere. * Baron is Lore's dog, guardian, and best friend. He overflows with happy-go-lucky positivity in every situation and always knows what to do. This helps to balance out Lore's innate negativity and unease.

Binder has an intense addiction to apples but will not admit this fact to any living soul. He also has the ability to speak in Guardian Glyphs. * Lore's father is mostly absent in Lore's life. He is somewhat rude to Lore, and is described as being in a bad mood most of the time. * The Barghest is a Darksider Lore meets in the forest after waking up and finding Baron to be missing. Its namesake is The Barghest of Northern English folklore. = Animus = * Ramul is a quick-witted and quick-footed rabbit who serves as the mailman in Animus.

He has an uncanny ability to detect vibrations in the ground and can hear others speaking from a great distance away. Remé is constantly cold in the generally chilly environment and wears winter clothing year round. Ramul and Remé have been dating for a while but try to keep it low-key. * As the resident outsider of the Animus, not much is known about Phil. He appeared one night and took up residence without a word to any of the other villagers. Remé claims that Phil is a government assassin sent to kill him but says if he cites any sources they would be \\"taken out\\" as well. Phil speaks using a strange dialect that results in bubbles filled with imagery depicting his thoughts appearing about his head whenever he talks. * Rhode spends most of her time combing the forests outside of Animus searching for medicinal herbs and beautiful flowers to sell. Rhode trades with Cirsi to provide materials for her alchemical creations. She spends a lot of time hanging out with Ramul and Remé, chatting about the latest news or dreams of the future. Pines over Fern but is far too shy to be forward enough for the oblivious deer to notice. * Fern is a deer possessing a singularly dominant personality. Fern appears to care nothing for the opinions of others and is very confident in herself. This confidence, however, is just a mask she uses to hide her immense self-doubt and worry. Most of her days are spent with Avocado reading hundreds of books aloud for the mole to transcribe. Because of her internal turmoil Fern is entirely unaware of Rhode's interest. * Seto is a great bear of immense power and the guardian of Animus. He watches over the village and would lay down his life for any of the other villagers. A stoic and aloof creature, Seto prefers a life of quiet solitude in a cave near the edge of the forest. Only the oldest remember the times before Seto, and they have nothing pleasant to say about it. * One of the most down to earth possums around, Cirsi serves as the village alchemist. Her tinctures and tonics help the crops grow and bring others back from the brink in times of sickness. She describes the villagers as \\"a bunch of downright animals\\" and is never afraid to say how she really feels about things even if it's not the most popular opinion. She spends much of her day creating new alchemical tinctures and taking care of her sister Carli. * Carli is a sister to Cirsi and one of the sweetest members of the village. She is exceptionally shy and prefers to stay indoors. Many months ago her mother's life was cut short in a terrible accident and she hasn't left the house since. Cirsi takes care of her and keeps her away from the other villagers. * Avocado is a small and mostly blind mole that is infatuated with books and puns of all kinds. She spends most of her time transcribing stories into braille with the help of her friend Fern. Avocado rarely leaves her home, but when she does, it's usually to pick up ink and supplies from Cirsi's shop. Her incredible hearing allows her to sense even the slightest movement. * Shelly Mossback is a kind and caring tortoise that walks the streets of Animus delivering food from Mossback Farms to the other villagers. In stark contrast to her husband, Shelly believes deeply in following Mania and strives to do something new and exciting each day. She loves her adopted son Ramul and wants him to follow his dreams and be whatever he wants to be. * An old snapping turtle, the owner of Mossback Farms, and husband to Shelly Mossback, Sheldon is a strong believer in Misery. He denounces Mania and sticks to his ways claiming that the earth provides for those with a routine and persistence. He dislikes the direction that his adopted son Ramul's life is going in and voices this frequently and vehemently. * Emelio is a gruff and no-nonsense blacksmith who builds all of the tools that keep the farm running. A strong believer in the primals, Emelio does everything he can to be productive and neutral in all aspects of his life. He's a very good friend of the Mossbacks and spends a lot of time talking to them. * Mania is the primal aspect of chaos, death, and madness. He can be found all around us in every terrible accident or lapse of judgement. He is the storm in sky threatening to overtake everything in an instant. The villagers believe that Mania must be sated with the chaos of new ideas and changing of old ways to avoid total destruction. Mania is one of the deities of the Animus. * Misery is the primal aspect of order, life, and sadness. Misery keeps order in the world and ensures the elderly pass on before Mania takes hold of them. When someone is lost to sickness, age, or accident Misery takes their body to the void beyond and replaces it with a sapling. The villagers believe that taking care of these trees honors their ancestors and keeps them happy in the afterlife. Misery is one of the deities of the Animus. = The Tower = * Joe Regular * OScar * Phish * Whistler * The Boss = Muspelheim = * Muus * Fire Penguins = Niflheim = * Snifl * Frost Penguins  Development  Hall lists Secret of Mana, EarthBound (and the Mother series), Wario Ware, Secret of Evermore, and 1o57 as sources of inspiration for Heartbound.

Multiplicative binary search was first described by Thomas Standish in 1980. This algorithm was originally proposed to simplify the midpoint index calculation on small computers without efficient division or shift operations. On modern hardware, the cache-friendly nature of multiplicative binary search makes it suitable for out-of-core search on block-oriented storage as an alternative to B-trees and B+ trees. For optimal performance, the branching factor of a B-tree or B+-tree must match the block size of the file system that it is stored on. The permutation used by multiplicative binary search places the optimal number of keys in the first (root) block, regardless of block size. Multiplicative binary search is used by some optimizing compilers to implement switch statements.  Algorithm  Multiplicative binary search operates on a permuted sorted array. Keys are stored in the array in level-order sequence of the corresponding balanced binary search tree. This places the first pivot of a binary search as the first element in the array. The second pivots are placed at the next two positions. Given an array A of n elements with values A0 ... An−1, and target value T, the following subroutine uses multiplicative binary search to find the index of T in A. # Set i to 0 # if i ≥ n, the search terminates unsuccessful. # if Ai = T, the search is done; return i. # if Ai < T, set i to 2×i + 1 and go to step 2. # if Ai > T, set i to 2×i + 2 and go to step 2.

M. W. Turner to be exhibited at the Royal Academy, in 1796 Fishermen at Sea, sometimes known as the Cholmeley Sea Piece, is an early oil painting by English artist J. M. W. Turner. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1796 and has been owned by the Tate Gallery since 1972. The painting measures . It depicts a moonlit view of fishermen on rough seas near the Needles, of the Isle of Wight. It juxtaposes the fragility of human life, represented by the small boat with its flickering lamp, and the sublime power of nature, represented by the dark clouded sky, the wide sea, and the threatening rocks in the background. The cold light of the Moon at night contrasts with the warmer glow of the fishermen's lantern. Years later, Turner made a similar sketch, Moonlight at Sea (The Needles), c.1818, as an example of marine art for his Liber Studiorum. The work shows strong influence from the work of marine artists such as Claude Joseph Vernet, Philip James de Loutherbourg, Peter Monamy and Francis Swaine, and the intimate nocturnal scenes of Joseph Wright of Derby. The image was praised by contemporary critics and founded Turner's reputation, as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes. Art historian Andrew Wilton has commented that the image: \\"Is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the 18th century.\\" According to Walter Thornbury, the work was sold to General Stewart for £10. The painting was acquired by Sir Henry Charles Englefield; after his death in 1822, it was sold at Christie's on 8 March 1823, as View of the Needles, with the effect of Moon and Fire Light. It was bought by Englefield's nephew Francis Cholmeley, and it remained in the Cholmeley family for nearly 150 years, displayed at Brandsby Hall, and it became known as the Cholmeley Sea Piece. It was loaned regularly to the Tate Gallery from 1931, and sold to the Tate Gallery in 1972 by Francis William Alfred Fairfax-Cholmeley, with finance from the Beatrice Lizzie Benson Fund.

Today it is the second most prominent in Cape Verde. Cuisine The most popular cuisine is cachupa as is in the rest of the nation. Delicacies originated from the island include Arroz de cabidela de marisco а dadal which is the rice seafood dish fried moray, barnacle stew (guisado de percebes) and xerém. Literature The first issue of Claridade issued in 1936. It was a literary review along with other works published at the time that lef the struggle for freedom and independenceLiterature is one of the richest in the Cape Verde Islands, unlike other islands, recorded literature started in the late 19th century. Later on, Mindelo became a commonplace for literature in Cape Verde. In the early 20th century, works, books and poems were published, more of them were related to the independence struggle, in 1936, the Claridade review was published in the city and was considered an underground publication, it was closed in 1960,From classicism to realism in Claridade by Alberto CarvalhoThe Creation of a Creole Literature (pdf) several writers were exiled until after the Carnation Revolution of April 25, 1974, before Cape Verde became independent.

Arts and theater Muséu Artesanato (Artisan's Museum) or the National Artisan's Center, Mindelo Art is well known on the island, one of the latest to be founded. It is rich in art, it has an art center named Centro Nacional de Artesanato located north of the city center, it is a museum that features arts and paintings from the earlier times of the island. Theater dominates an important role in the island. It has the Mindelo Theatrical Festival which is a major festival in Cape Verde, its first edition was held in 1995, a year later, Mindelact, a theatrical association was founded.

Newly constructed tall towers are founded in northwest, modern architecture are scattered in the outer areas of the city. Notable painters include João Cleofas Martins, nicknamed Djunga Fotografo, Bitú, Manuel Figueira and Luisa Queirós. Events Every late winter before Lent, the São Vicente Carnival for many years has been the most important in Cape Verde. In one song, Cesária Évora mentioned it in \\"São Vicent ê um Brazilim\\" (probably also the name for the song \\"Carnaval de São Vicente\\") indicating the similarity with the carnival in Brazil. Music Music was brought to the island in the start of the 19th century after the first settlement was founded and was the most recent to be introduced in Cape Verde. The music takes a dominant position of its culture on the island. The most significant genres are morna and coladeira. The island has its own morna variant which is a derivative of the Brava Morna. In the 1930s and the 1940s, the morna gained special characteristics in São Vicente. The Brava style was much appreciated and cultivated in all Cape Verde by that time (there are records about E. Tavares being received in apotheosis in S. Vicente island and even the Barlavento composers wrote in Sotavento Creole,Rodrigues, Moacyr e Isabel Lobo, A Morna na Literatura Tradicional — Instituto Cabo-verdiano do Livro, 1996 probably because the maintenance of the unstressed vowels in Sotavento Creoles gave more musicality). But specific conditions in S. Vicente such as the cosmopolitanism and openness to foreign influences brought some enrichment to the morna. The other music style of the island is coladeira, one of two centered in Mindelo, from S. Vicente this musical genre passed to the other islands.Gonçalves, C. F., Kab Verd Band — 2006 Festival de Baía das Gatas was the first music festival that took place in 1984. Due to its enormous space, it has been the most popular music festival of Cape Verde. It may have become the second-most popular festival today to Praia da Gamboa on Santiago or Praia de Santa Maria on Sal. The most popular singer of all time was Cesária Évora, who was the first from the nation to reach world stage, second was Bana and he recorded the most songs and singles. Other singers and musicians include, Dudu Araujo, Bau, B. Leza (Francisco Xavier da Cruz), Hermínia da Cruz Fortes, Djô d'Eloy, Fantcha, Jotamont, Belinda Lima, Luís Morais, Eddy Moreno, Tito Paris, Titina (Albertina) Rodrigues, Jovino dos Santos, Lela Violão and Robert and Val Xalino. Rappers include Boss AC and Eddy Fort Moda Grog, both of them immigrated to Europe and recorded its tracks there. The most famous composer is Vasco Martins who is the first Capeverdean to perform symphonies and orchestral music. One of the songs based on or set on a locality on the island includes \\"Salamansa\\", \\" São Vicente di Longe\\" and \\"Rogamar\\" by Cesária Évora and \\"Avenida Marginal\\" by Bana. Some of the songs were related to the famine and starvation that happened on the island as was with the rest of Cape Verde in the mid 20th century and emigrants in other countries (some descendants) which was common especially in the 1950s. The most popular albums from the island were São Vicente di Longe with its tracks mainly set on parts of the island and most of all Voz d'Amor and Rogamar (2006).

Best known for her paintings, her work incorporates both mythical and spiritual iconography. In 1932 she attended a seance held in the home of Rev. Ida L. Ewing, the pastor of The National Federation of Spiritual Science, Church No. 68, in Santa Ana, California. Peavy first encountered \\"Lacamo\\", a spirit from another world whom she called her \\"spirit muse,\\" while in a trance during one of the weekly meetings. Afterward when she painted, she claimed that Lacamo directed her brush. She sometimes wore a mask to channel Lacamo’s energy. Her paintings were exhibited in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York during her life time and have recently resurfaced in exhibitions. The works reflect her (and Lacamo’s) belief that humanity was slowly moving toward an androgynous species, which she called “one-gender perfection,” through contact with alien species, or UFOs (Unidentified Foreign Objects). In her consideration of a future-sex and post-masculine world, Peavy’s work aligns with that of Hilma af Klint, Agnes Pelton, and Forest Bess.  Early life  Paulina Peavy was born Pauline Ellen White in Old Colorado City, Colorado (now part of Colorado Springs) on August 24, 1901. In 1906, Peavy's family moved to Portland, Oregon, where she attended both elementary school and high school. When Peavy was six, her mother died, leaving her to live with her father. In her unpublished manuscript The Story of My Life with a “UFO,” Peavy recalls that “it was my father’s belief that education would be wasted on girls ----- as they only shall marry and bear children.” Instead of a traditional high school, Peavy attended the Girl’s Polytechnic School in Portland, Oregon, where courses focused heavily on cooking and sewing. In 1923, Peavy graduated from Oregon State College, with a Bachelor of Science in Vocational Education. She likely met her future husband, Bradley A. Peavey (b. 1890), as a student. They married in 1922. The Peavy family was powerful in Corvallis, Oregon — Bradley’s father, George Wilcox Peavy, was the Dean of Forestry at the time. While Paulina Peavy lived there, he would become the president of the college, and later the mayor of Corvallis. The couple left Oregon, however, and moved to southern California, where Peavy gave birth to her first son, Bradley Adelbert Peavy, in 1924 in San Pedro, California. She gave birth to her second, Wesley Peavy, two years later in 1926. As a young woman, Paulina found herself married to an alcoholic man prone to violence. While Paulina was in a sanitarium for tuberculosis around 1930, her husband Bradley took both boys to his parents’ house in Oregon. When Paulina recovered, she retrieved the boys from Oregon and eventually won custody later that year. Independent for the first time in her life, Paulina Peavy and her two sons settled in Long Beach, California. By teaching art in local schools, she supported the family. For a period of time in 1932, she left the boys in an orphanage called The Boys and Girls Aid Society in Pasadena, California. According to a later interview in a New York newspaper called the Brooklyn Eagle, she taught architectural design in the art department of a junior high school in Long Beach for 14 years. At some point in the 1930s, while teaching for the Los Angeles Board of Education, Peavy took courses at the Chouinard School of Fine Art in Los Angeles (now part of the California Institute of the Arts) on an Art Advanced scholarship. Although an undated resume she later wrote says she finished her MA, school records do not substantiate that claim. After living in Los Angeles and San Francisco from 1923 to 1942, she moved to New York, New York, where she remained until the age of 97.  Spiritual and philosophical ideas  This is a page of Peavy's manuscript defining her seasons. In 1932, Peavy began attending weekly séances at the Long Beach home of Ida Ewing of Long Beach, whom she described as \\"a trance medium.\\" It was there that she said she first met Lacamo (pronounced LA-cum-mo), a spirit that Peavy called a UFO, or “Unidentified Foreign Object.” Although Lacamo originally channeled his communications through Ewing, eventually the spirit would \\"spoke\\" directly to Peavy. In her 1982 film, Mountain of Myrrh/UFO, she describes her first encounter with the UFO as seeing a \\"great cloud and fire unfolding itself, and a brightness was about itself, the color of amber. . . . The spirit of the living creations was in the wheels. As for this ring [meaning sound], they were so high they were dreadful. Wherever the living creature went, the wheels went. The flying saucer’s spacecraft form is planetary, consisting of an aggregation of hierarchical egos, a vast pulsating living power unit, promulgated as seed around a central nucleus. Being seed in constant metamorphosis, they create themselves mentally by the brow in any form in any place in the universe and by feat of travel that their thought enacts upon. Their genesis is wholly mental.\\"Mountain of Myrrh/The UFO, 1982, 25.5 minutes. Lacamo, through Ewing, instructed Peavy to read Isis Unveiled (1877) by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, a Russian philosopher and co-founder of the Theosophical Society whose ideas inspired the work of other artists like Hilma af Klint. The Bible and Christian Theology figured prominently in Peavy's work throughout her life. A 1946 article by Margaret Mara published in the Brooklyn Eagle reads, “Interpreting the parables in the Bible with a paint brush is the gigantic task undertaken by Paulina Peavy, modernistic painter, who has evolved some amazing theories following 10 years of biblical research.” But her philosophy of the cosmos moved beyond established theosophical and religious tests. She also recalls that Lacamo instructed her to “reduce all capitallised [sic] words in the Bible- to their low case and then wholly scientific meanings; as example- biology- embryology- etc.!” Through these synthetic visions, her philosophy and images combined modern conventions of science with historical religious philosophy. Lacamo continued to teach Peavy and co-author works with her for over 50 years. For Peavy, Lacamo existed beyond human conceptions of gender and identity. According to her, Lacamo revealed a vision of the future in which single-sex female reproduction would render men unnecessary. Her worldview hinged on the idea that humans were continually reincarnated until they became “pharaohs,” or “free souls” who had achieved “one-gender perfection.\\" In her art, pyramids represent this evolution. Over time, she developed a philosophy that the world evolved through 12,000 year cycles composed of four seasons of 3,000 years each—the spring age, summer pyramid age, autumn age, and winter age. “The male” only appeared during the winter age, which she also referred to as “Babel.” In her writings, films, and paintings, Peavy advanced her belief that humankind was “nearing the end of our 3,000 year age- likened to a prolonged WINTER” and that soon the spring age, where humanity ascended to “one-gender perfection” would arrive. Curator Bill Arning has drawn a connection between Peavy and radical feminists like Valerie Solanis, who wrote a book called the SCUM Manifesto arguing that men were an unnecessary evil. Her paintings were revealed to her. She felt herself to be the physical maker, but not the spiritual author. Through the act of painting and revising, which she did continually, the images revealed their meaning to her over a long span of time.  Work  As an artist, Peavy worked in painting, drawing, sculpture, writing, poetry, and film. Her work, particularly her mixed-media and Phantasma series, developed a personal symbology consisting of shapes that resembled energy beams, solar systems, and organic shapes that represented ovaries, genitalia, sperm, and fetuses. = Paintings, drawings, and mixed- media = Working in thin layers of jewel-toned oil paint, Peavy composed multi-layered images with translucent colors that often referenced her belief in an electric and cosmic relationship between the human brain and higher sources. Her subjects range from her earlier representational works, like the paintings she exhibited at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco, California, to abstract works of geometric and organic shapes symbolizing reincarnation and fertility. Most of her works are undated, but it is presumed that she began working in this style during the 1930s, perhaps while at the Chouinard School of Fine Arts, and continued through the 1970s. In an interview with the Brooklyn Eagle, Peavy describes her technique as \\"a revolt in art school teachings as well as being the result of research in the bible.” In the same interview, she says, “My paintings attempt to ‘create life’ on canvas, even as my mother created me and as I created my two sons.” Her oil paintings have a hard, almost mirrored surface that resembles enamel as a result of her painting style. During the 1970s and 1980s, she returned to many of her earlier paintings and reworked them in sharper shapes that resembled crystals. Because of this practice a single painting can represent decades of work. In her 1987 film, UFO Identified, Peavy describes her watercolors as depicting creation, or conception: “Light at the moment of conception, the seed nuclear. The tongue of flames ascend and descend of the egg nucleus and then there is light.\\"UFO Identified, 1987 Between 1975 and 1984, Peavy began working with watercolor, pen, collage, and ink. She often signed both these later works and her earlier ones with her name as well as Lacamo’s. Many of the watercolors are dated. The earliest is dated to 1953. In addition, some have two dates, suggesting that she would return to a work many years later. = Exhibition and critical reception = The complexity of her constructed cosmos and the technical skill with which she executed her images occasionally stymied, but often impressed reviewers and the public. From 1933 to 1942, Peavy exhibited at the San Diego Museum, Civic Center Museum of San Francisco, Stanford University, the Gump Galleries in San Francisco, the Stendahl Gallery in Los Angeles, and the Palos Verdes Gallery in Palos Verdes. In 1935, she stayed with Brigadier General Charles F. Humphrey and his wife. The visit was recorded in the Army and Navy Journal, which described her as “a noted California artist.”Army and Navy Journal - Volume 73 - Page 430 https://books.google.com/books?id=x38XAQAAMAAJ In 1939, she was invited to participate in the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco, California, where she painted a large panel entitled “The Last Supper.\\" Artist Diego Rivera was on site painting a mural at the same time. Peavy’s panel was fourteen by six feet and painted on stretched canvas. The original image was a representational depiction of Jesus Christ at the center, surrounded by other female figures. She brought the painting with her to New York and, as with many of her works, she eventually painted over it and renamed the image \\"Crystallization of Matter.\\" That painting was destroyed when Peavy moved to Bethesda, Maryland, at the end of her life in 1997. Fortunately, a partial original image survived as a postcard. The later painting, an abstract mosaic of pyramids and other geometric shapes, demonstrates how her work evolved, as she documents in her book The Story of My Life With a \\"UFO\\" and in her films from the 1980’s. The reception of her work at the exposition was mixed, but she considered the event a highlight of her life. At the time, a major art critic, Alfred Frankenstein, found some of her work was “quite good,” but that the majority were “curious affairs, glazed hard as mirrors, making much rather monotonous use of concentric circles in drapery, beads, aureoles and curlicues of sorts.” In response, Peavy wrote a letter to the editor entitled “Artist Amazed”: > I wish to thank Mr. Frankenstein for reviewing my exhibitions at the Temple > of Religion, but I am amazed that he, with the reputation of being one of > the most intelligent art critics of the Bay Area, has followed the examples > of unthinking people throughout the ages—that is, to condemn that which they > do not understand. Might it have ever occurred to Mr. Frankenstein that the > queer gyrations of my paintings, as he has expressed it, might be an > expression of the same God-given fundamental principles (as yet not > understood) embodied in the structural and philosophical principles of the > ancient Pyramids and even the ancient Egyptians’ art? Three years later, for reasons not entirely known, Peavy moved from Long Beach, California, to New York, New York. The only record she has left of her decision is in her unpublished manuscript, The Story of My Life with a \\"UFO\\": \\"The dictionary defined ‘destiny’- as ‘-that which is to happen to a particular person or thing.’ And so, obviously it was in my destiny to move to New York in 1942.\\" According to an undated resume she composed while in New York, between 1942 and 1943 Peavy exhibited at the Delphic Studios, New York City. In 1943, Peavy had her first solo exhibition in Manhattan at the Argent Gallery. Art Digest's Maud Riley wrote a glowing review of her exhibition in an article entitled “Electronics in Paint”: > Mrs. Peavy has technical equipment equal to Dali. But instead of using her > inherent ability developed, certainly, in the cases of both by dint of long > hard work to give vicarious thrilled of the unnatural and decadent, as Dali > does, this artist tells a tale of the abstract forces of thought abroad in > the world and attempts to give validity to the belief that the mind is real. > She gives form to the ‘electronic structure,’ and these forms are no more > unworldly than Dali’s melting watches. To do this, the artist devised a > technique that defies analysis. She paints plasmas similarly to Matta’s, > uses church window colors of intense reds and blues, creates forms which are > neither plant nor animal nor human. But they are not 'non-objective.' For > many are built around the figures of Biblical characters and there is deep > beauty in the faces of the subjects. Two reviews also ran in the New York Herald Tribune, one entitled “Mystic Symbolism.” The other was by Carlyle Burrows, who called Peavy an “extraordinary creative talent, curiously romantic in its implications.\\" Throughout the 1940s, galleries continued to exhibit her work. In 1945, she showed her “Waterflames,” “Conception,” and “Sea of Life” series, as well as a painting called “The Supper of Peace,” at the Jurart Gallery at Sixth Avenue and Forty-sixth street. A year later, the Lawrence Terzian Gallery, 545 Fifth Avenue, New York, hosted a show of her work that was called “Genesis, Atomic Forces of Nature.” The New York Times ran an ambiguous review of the exhibition, while The Brooklyn Eagle printed a more favorable column on the paintings by Margaret Mara called “In Awe of Creative Powers, Impressionistic Painter of Biblical Parables Has Theories on Atom.” \\"In each of her paintings the artist depicts birth,” Mara writes, “which she describes as ‘the multiplying power of the human atom or life cell.’\\" By 1948, Peavy's work was being featured on posters sold by the American Cancer Society for fundraising purposes, who described her as “dedicating her life to a rich interpretation of the Bible.” Yet in the following decade, other than her development of a manikin made of articulated blocks for drawing in 1954, she seems to disappear from public view. She must, however, have remained active as an artist and public figure because she appeared in live broadcasts of the Long John Nebel talk show on WOR in both 1958 and 1960. Nebel invited guests who had experienced paranormal events, including witchcraft, ghosts, UFOs, conspiracy theorists, and parasychology. Between 1954 and 1962, the show aired from midnight to 5:30 am seven days a week, and amassed a significant following across the continental United States. Peavy wore a mask, which Nebel described on air, and was in a trance through most of the interview. Lacamo spoke through her during the trance, and said \\"...we are using her exactly as you use your microphone. We are beings existing.\\"(Long John Nebel Show, January 1958 \\"The Mystic Barber of Brooklyn - Andy Sinatra\\")(\\"The Age of Flying Saucers\\" by Paris Flammonde)) Over the last thirty years of her life, Peavy seems to have continued producing and exhibiting art, although she increasingly began to use film and text as her mediums. In 1961, the New York Tribune listed an exhibition of her recent paintings in Crown Gallery, 881 Seventh Ave, New York. On her undated resume, she wrote that she had produced 1,000 paintings, a number she would have certainly surpassed by the end of her life. = Masks = The mask that Peavy wore when she appeared on the Long John Nebel show in 1958 and 1960 was just one of many that she created to facilitate a deeper trance. Her creativity depended on achieving a dream- state, where she could contact the higher plane where Lacamo resided. Peavy often cut the base of the mask out of leather, or other materials such as velvet or lace. Using beads, feathers, lace, buttons, and costume jewelry, she would decorate each mask individually. Each received titles like “Royal Foursquare”, “Duo Genius” or “Monumental Redundant. In 1967, she received a patent (72185234) for an invention called “Mask-Ezz,” which she describes as “adhesive facial covering devices and the like described as self-adhesive skin covering devices in sheet form, the adhesive layer of which impregnated with substances conducive to stimulating healing of the skin and layers therebelow [sic] when placed against the skin.\\" It is unclear when she began making the masks, but they featured heavily in her later films, especially the 1985 film entitled The Artist Behind the Mask. = Writings and Films = Peavy only began committing her philosophical ideas to the page later in life. In 1959, she began an unpublished manuscript entitled Various Kinds of Dissertations, which recorded various conversations with Lacamo and laid out her vision of the cosmos. When she finally finished the book in 1973, it was 121 pages long. She began to write poetry as well, including “Voice from Higher Dimensions” in 1960, which she claimed Lacamo had written through her. In another poem entitled “Resurrection of Atoms,” she articulates her view that reincarnation as a woman is the step before one-gender perfection as a pharaoh: > Therefore, as each female had been all sub-creature forms – Including a > human male, ultimately she has graduated out from All lower creature forms- > eventually becoming a pharaoh (fair-oh)- And as a “creator pharaoh”- and > eventually she Graduates within the so-called higher dimension- as a UFO! In the late 1980s, Peavy began writing her unpublished manuscript, The Story of My Life with a \\"UFO\\". Although the book is undated, she does mention the diseases Alzheimer’s, which did not become a major concern until 1977, and the Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which was not discussed nationally until the mid-1980s. In 1993, she copyrighted five manuscript books: Various Kinds of Dissertations, which was a compilation of various writings; The Mad Nightingale In Search of God; A Spoof On Psychology, Biology, Sexology, Symbology, Government, and Religion, which was written by Peavy and Lacamo according to the title page; Psychology of Art and Composition, which was largely a design book without text; Philosophy & Poetry, also jointly-authored by Peavy and Lacamo; and The Story of My Life with a \\"UFO.\\" Peavy’s earliest film was Paulina, Artist-Philosopher, An Artist of Vision, which she copyrighted in 1981. That year, she exhibited it in the International Film & TV Festival of New York, where it won a bronze medal. For the next three years, she annually entered a film into the festival. In 1982, she won a bronze medal for Mountain of Myrrh, and another for Is the Moon a Burned-Out Sun in 1983. Male Sex then won her a silver award in 1984, and The Artist Behind the Mask won her final Bronze medal in 1985. Her films feature many of her paintings, which she narrates and describes in a calm voices accompanied by lilting music. Each capture a different aspect of her philosophy. Her final film, copyrighted in 1988, is Phantasma, Sixty Oil Paintings, A Self Portrait. Later life Very little is known of Peavy’s personal life after she moved to New York, NY, in 1942. Her undated resume, left behind in ephemera kept by her family, sketches a faint picture of her movements. At the top of the page, her address reads 390 West End Avenue, New York, NY, which places her in the Upper West Side. A marketing postcard lists an address at 320 West 78th Street. She seems to have held various jobs, from an art teacher for the New York City Board of Education to an architectural and engineer drafts-person for various companies. In addition, she lists herself as a lecturer at City College New York and at the American Museum of Natural History, where she spoke about “Phillians.” Although she showed at many galleries, she did not seem to find much commercial success. Likely, she supported herself by working odd jobs and teaching art. A 1954 article in the New York Herald Tribune describing the theft of a valuable statuette of Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower from a booth at the National Antique Show in Madison Square Garden describes a “Mrs. Pauline Peavy” as an assistant at the hall. According to her family, she began showing signs of dementia around 1996. Her son Bradley moved her to a nursing home in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1998 after she broke her hip. She died there in 1999, at the age of 98.  Legacy  Despite some success during her lifetime, Peavy was relatively forgotten by the time she died. Her family kept her papers, paintings, and drawings, tucked away in a basement corner. A retrospective of her work, A Message to Paulina, was held at the Greater Reston Art Center in 2018; a Washington Post review described it as \\"exuberant, kaleidoscopic and beckoning\\". The Andrew Edlin Gallery has represented her work since 2016. In 2018, Peavy's paintings were included in the gallery's group exhibition \\"April 14, 1561.\\" Roberta Smith reviewed the exhibition in The New York Times, and mentioned Peavy's work: “The abstractions representing Ms. Peavy here suggest brightly colored embryos or sleek flying saucers drifting among amniotic fluids or intergalactic ethers.” As interest in previously overlooked female spiritualist artists like Hilma af Klint and Emma Kunz grows, the art world has begun to recognize Paulina Peavy's achievements as an artist. Artist Jane Kaplowitz chose the 2019 exhibition of Paulina Peavy's work at the Andrew Edlin Gallery as her most memorably exhibition of 2019 in Artforum round up of artists' artists.

She served as chair of form and drawing in the College for the Training of Teachers, president of the art department of the National Education Association, and director of the art department in the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry (now known as Drexel University). Early years and education Hannah True was born in Portland, Maine, the only child of Jonathan True and Hannah True, his wife. Carter's father was a wealthy importer and commission merchant. Her mother died young, leaving her infant daughter to the care of a devoted father who, early recognizing the artistic tastes of his child, gave her considerable training in that direction. Career In 1868, she became the wife of Henry Theophilus Carter, a mechanical engineer and manufacturer. The marriage was happy and congenial, with wealth and high social standing. Financial losses, the failing health of her husband, the death of a child, and the loneliness of widowhood all came in quick succession, forcing her to look for ways to support herself and a child. With the life insurance left her by her husband, Carter entered the Massachusetts Normal Art School (now known as Massachusetts College of Art and Design) and was graduated with high standing. After a year's further study with private teachers in first-class studios, she went to Kingston, Canada, to direct an art school, where she succeeded in establishing the school on a permanent basis. At the close of the first year, she was obliged to return to Boston, as the climate of Canada was too severe for her health. For two years, she was associated with the Prang Educational Company, of that city, doing various work pertaining to its educational department, such as illustrating drawing-books and often acting as drawing supervisor. In the fall of 1887, she was called to New York City to take the chair of professor of form and drawing in the College for the Training of Teachers, and in 1890, she was elected president of the art department of the National Educational Association. In 1891, she was made director of the art department in the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Carter was appointed on many industrial, educational and art committees. She had an interest in general art education, believing enthusiastically in the necessity of educating and elevating public taste by beginning early with the training of children for a love of the aesthetic.

Its most prominent era occurred in the late 1970s among post-punk acts who embraced black dance styles. Characteristics Critic Simon Reynolds described avant-funk as \\"difficult dance music\\" and a kind of psychedelia in which \\"oblivion was to be attained not through rising above the body, rather through immersion in the physical, self loss through animalism.\\" Simon Frith described avant-funk as an application of progressive rock mentality to rhythm rather than melody and harmony. Some motifs of the style in the 1970s and 1980s included \\"Eurodisco rhythms; synthesizers used to generate not pristine, hygienic textures, but poisonous, noisome filth; Burroughs’ cut-up technique applied to found voices.\\" History Talking Heads combined funk with elements of punk and art rock. Early acts who have retrospectively been described with the term include German krautrock band Can, American funk artists Sly Stone and George Clinton, and jazz trumpeter Miles Davis. Herbie Hancock's 1972 album Sextant was called an \\"uncompromising avant-funk masterpiece\\" by Paste. Jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman led the avant-funk band Prime Time in the 1970s and 1980s. Guitarist James \\"Blood\\" Ulmer, who performed with Coleman in the 1970s, was described by The New Yorker as \\"one of avant-funk's masters.\\" According to Reynolds, a pioneering wave of avant-funk artists came in the late 1970s, when post-punk artists (including Public Image Ltd, Liquid Liquid, and James Chance, as well as Cabaret Voltaire, Talking Heads, The Pop Group, DAF, A Certain Ratio, and 23 Skidoo) embraced black dance music styles such as funk and disco. Reynolds noted these artists' preoccupations with issues such as alienation, repression and the technocracy of Western modernity. The artists of the late 1970s New York no wave scene also explored avant-funk, influenced by Ornette Coleman. Later groups such as Skinny Puppy, Chakk, 400 Blows represented later waves of the style. By the mid 1980s, it had dissipated, with many of its practitioners becoming a part of the UK's first wave of house music.

Incumbent mayor Maureen O'Connor chose not to run for reelection. Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, though some candidates do receive funding and support from various political parties. The non-partisan primary was held June 2, 1992. Peter Navarro and Susan Golding received the most votes and advanced to the November general election. Golding was elected mayor with a majority of the votes in the November election. Candidates *Susan Golding, San Diego County Supervisor (Party preference: Republican) *Peter Navarro, business professor (Party preference: Independent) *Ron Roberts, San Diego City Councilmember (Party preference: Republican) *Tom Carter, businessman (Party preference: Democratic) *Loch David Crane, magician, college instructor, and perennial candidate *Bill Thomas, accountant (Party preference: Republican) Campaign Incumbent mayor Maureen O'Connor announced in her 1990 State of the City address that she would not run for reelection, but would focus instead on political reforms including giving future mayors more power. She declined to endorse any of the candidates vying to replace her. Among the primary candidates, County Supervisor Susan Golding and City Councilmember Ron Roberts ran on their experience in local government. Economist Peter Navarro and businessman Tom Carter ran as political outsiders. Navarro also emphasized his advocacy for slow-growth policies as chairman of the grassroots organization Prevent Los Angelization Now! (PLAN). Navarro considered himself a conservative Republican, but had changed his affiliation to independent prior to the primary election. In the primary election held June 2, 1992, Navarro placed first with 38.2 percent of the vote followed by Golding with 31.1 percent. Trailing far behind were Roberts with 16.4 percent, Carter with 9.8 percent and scattered votes for other minor candidates. As the top two vote- getters, Navarro and Golding advanced to the November ballot. Golding was then elected mayor with 52 percent of the votes on November 3, 1992.
