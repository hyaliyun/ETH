The statue was deemed \\"scary\\" by residents, earning it nickname Scary Lucy. In 2016, the statue was replaced by one created by Carolyn Palmer. The new sculpture is known officially as New Lucy and colloquially as Lovely Lucy. First statue In 2009, a statue of Ball was displayed in her hometown of Celoron. The statue depicted the climactic scene from \\"Lucy Does a TV Commercial\\" in which Ball's character Lucy Ricardo hawks the alcohol-rich patent medicine Vitameatavegamin while under the effects of heavy dosage of the tonic. Residents noted the statue's deranged, androgynous expression, which bore little resemblance to Ball, earning it the nickname Scary Lucy. The statue garnered little outside attention until 2015, when images of the statue went viral and received international media coverage. The artist discussed fixing the statue with town officials, but claimed they wanted him to do it at his own expense. In 2015, Celoron's mayor said the town was looking to hire a different artist instead. Second statue On August 1, 2016, it was announced that a new statue of Ball would replace the original. Carolyn Palmer was unanimously chosen out of a national competition of more than 65 sculptors. She said in a statement, \\"I not only wanted to portray the playful, animated and spontaneous Lucy, but also the glamorous Hollywood icon\\" and \\"I just hope that all the Lucy fans are pleased and that Lucille Ball herself would have enjoyed this image of her.\\" On August 6, 2016, the day that would have been Ball's 105th birthday, the replacement statue was revealed. Since Scary Lucy became a local tourist attraction after receiving media attention, it was placed 75 yards from its original location so visitors could visit both statues.

They lived in Cloch√°in (beehive huts) around a wooden church The placename derives from the Irish for \\"field of apple trees.\\" The present church dates to c. 1100 and was in use by the Church of Ireland until 1716‚Äì17.http://www.countywicklowheritage.org/documents/Rathgall_and_Aghowle_Brochure_2008_2009.pdf Local legend tells of a \\"fugitive bell\\": apparently St Finnian erected a belfry at Aghowle, but later moved the bell to his other monastery at Clonard. One day it vanished and reappeared at Aghowle, and, despite several attempts at removing it, the bell kept on returning to Aghowle. Church Window detail The church is a long rectangular building with high gables of which the original north, east and west walls survive. The west doorway is lintelled on the outside and arched inside. It has Romanesque moulding on the outside and a draw-bar socket. Two round-headed windows in the east wall have hood mouldings on the outside supported by pillars. =St Finden's Cross= St Finden's Cross To the northeast of the church is a high imperforate ringed granite high cross, possibly unfinished, standing on a pyramidal base known as St Finden's Cross. There are sunken panels in the shaft and underneath the arms. It dates to approximately the 10th century. =Font= Located on the eastern side of the cross is a large granite baptismal font (130 √ó 73 cm; 4‚Ä≤3‚Ä≥ √ó 2‚Ä≤5‚Ä≥) which is believed to be pre-Norman. Local tradition claimed that water from the font could cure headaches. It is generally accepted that the use of fonts within churches became firmly established during the 12th century in Ireland, reflecting the move to a parochial and diocesan organisation of the church and the changes in liturgical conventions that this brought. It was required that the sacraments take place in a fixed baptistery inside a church. In the field to the southeast is a large bullaun stone.

It may have been meant as a message to his northern subjects and neighbours signifying the strength of English royal authority.Howard (2003) pp. 52‚Äì53. One possibility is that √Üthelr√¶d's invasion concerned Cumbrian support of Scandinavian predatory forces in the area,Clarkson (2010) ch. 9; Woolf (2007) pp. 222‚Äì223. and that the operation was aimed at Scandinavian outposts in the Irish Sea region.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 222; Oram (2000) p. 12; Strickland (1997) p. 377.

According to the twelfth-century Chronicon ex chronicis, the fleet vacated the north prior to √Üthelr√¶d's strike, which may well explain why the latter was free to undertake a foreign campaign.Howard (2003) p. 54; Anderson (1908) p. 78 n. 1; Forester (1854) p. 113; Stevenson (1853) p. 254; Thorpe (1848) p. 154. In fact, there is reason to suspect that the English had struck a deal with a Scandinavian army seated in England, and thereafter directed one part of this force to engage the Cumbrians and another to attack the Normans.Howard (2003) pp. 54‚Äì56.

Just the year before, M√°el Coluim mac Cin√°eda succeeded a kinsman to become King of Alba.Duffy (2013) ch. 3; Broun (2004a). The twelfth-century pseudo-prophetic Prophecy of Berch√°n describes this monarch an \\"enemy of Britons\\", and within the same passage seems to refer to military actions against the islands of Islay and Arran.Wadden (2016) p. 180; Duffy (2013) ch. 3; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9; Woolf (2007) pp. 225‚Äì226, 253; Hicks (2003) p. 43; Hudson, BT (1996) pp. 52 ¬ß 183, 90 ¬ß 183; Hudson, BT (1994) pp. 111, 117; Anderson (1930) p. 51 ¬ß 181; Anderson (1922) p. 574; Skene (1867) p. 99. This source, therefore, may refer to events related to Brian's apparent overseas operations. It could also be evidence of competition in the region between Brian and his Scottish counterpart. Also in 1006, the eleventh-century De obsessione Dunelmi records that the Scots penetrated into Northumbria, and besieged Durham before being beaten back by Uhtred, son of the northern English magnate Waltheof.Clarkson (2014) ch. 8; Walker (2013) ch. 5; Aird (2004) ch. 8; Anderson (1908) p. 80; Arnold (1882) pp. 215‚Äì216. The fact that there is no record of Cumbrian involvement in this Scottish enterprise could indicate that the devastation wrought by the English in 1000 had nullified Cumbrian military might. Another possibility is that the Cumbrians had adhered to the conditions of some sort of submission which √Üthelr√¶d had exacted from them as a result of his campaign. Death and the Cumbrian succession Penrith. The stones display significant Scandinavian influences, and are traditionally associated with a legendary king, variably known as Owain Caesarius. It is possible that this figure refers to Owain himself, or any of the tenth- and eleventh-century Cumbrian kings who bore the same name.Clarkson (2010) ch. 10; Proceedings (1947) pp. 221‚Äì225; Collingwood (1923).

Either Owain himself, or his like-named grandfather Owain ap Dyfnwal, King of Strathclyde, or else their ultimate royal successor Owain Foel may be identical to Owain Caesarius, a legendary figure associated with an assemblage of apparent tenth-century monuments at Penrith collectively known as The Giant's Grave.Edmonds (2015) p. 5, 55 n. 61; Clarkson (2010) ch. 10; Proceedings (1947) pp. 221‚Äì225; Collingwood (1923).

The devices which accomplish this are generically known as IMSI-catchers, but are commonly called Stingrays, a brand sold by the Harris Corporation. History The United States Federal government has access to stingray-type technology since at least 1995. The Baltimore Police Department began using the devices in 2007. The New York City Police Department has used the devices since 2008. Initially, the use of Stingray phone trackers was a secret, due to a number of non-disclosure agreements between individual police departments and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the FBI entered into agreements with at least 48 police departments in the United States. In these agreements, the FBI allowed police departments to use the stingrays, while requiring police departments provide no information to either the public or the courts regarding the devices' operation or existence. In December 2012, the Electronic Privacy Information Center released documents which show the United States Department of Justice discussing the use of cell phone tracking equipment, including addressing unlawful interference concerns. More info on Stingrays was obtained in March 2013, when the American Civil Liberties Union released documents it obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. Stingray devices have been used in a variety of criminal investigations, from murder and kidnapping to misdemeanor theft. The way law enforcement uses of stingrays has been criticized by a number of civil liberties groups, who have filed lawsuits against current practices. Compared to other large cities, like Boston, New York City and San Diego, Baltimore, Maryland has a much higher use of stingrays. According to a member of the Baltimore Police Department, the agency used stingrays 4,300 times since 2007. Legal issues =Federal government= The official position of the US Federal government is that the use of Stingrays does not require a probable cause warrant, because they claim Stingrays are a kind of pen register tap, which do not require a warrant, as decided in Smith v. Maryland. The government notes that they do not intercept the actual conversation, only tracking identity of the phone and its location. The devices do have the technical capability to record the content of calls, so the government requires these content-intercepting functions to be disabled in normal use. In September 2015, the US Justice Department issued new guidelines requiring federal agents to obtain warrants before using stingray devices, except in exigent circumstances. =State governments= In 2015, the state of Virginia passed a law requiring the use of a warrant when using a stingray, and Washington state proposed a similar law. In addition, California, Minnesota and Utah have also passed laws requiring warrants for stingray use. Legal cases In 2011, in the case of Daniel David Rigmaiden in the U.S. District Court of Arizona, the chief of the FBI Tracking Technology Unit wrote an affidavit defending the use of an unspecified pen register device. Information about the model or function was purposefully withheld, citing FBI policy; the letter assured the court that the device was legally compliant. A widely cited story released by the Wall Street Journal described the device as a \\"stingray\\", along with basic information about how it worked. Much of the info on Stingray devices was provided by Rigmaiden himself, who looked for how authorities had discovered he was committing tax fraud. In January 2016, in the case of United States v. Patrick, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, upheld the warrantless use of a Stingray to locate the suspect. On March 30, 2016, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals ruled in Maryland v. Andrews that a warrant is required for using a Stingray. This led to the suppression of evidence for alleged attempted murder by Andrews. On April 25, 2016, the Baltimore City Circuit Court suppressed evidence collected using a Stingray in the trial of alleged murder suspect Robert Copes. The police had obtained authorization to use a pen register, but the court ruled that it was insufficient and they needed a probable cause warrant. On July 12, 2016, the U.S. District Court of Southern New York ruled in United States v. Lambis that using a Stingray constitutes a search that requires a warrant and suppressed the evidence gathered from its use. On August 16, 2016, a complaint was filed to the Federal Communications Commission by the Center for Media Justice, Color of Change, and Open Technology Institute regarding the use of Stingrays by the Baltimore Police Department. The complaint alleged that the department had been operating Stingrays without proper licensing and asked the FCC to intervene. The complaint further claimed that use of the device, which can disrupt cell networks, disproportionately affected African-American neighborhoods in Baltimore. The Stingray had been used by Baltimore police thousands of times during investigations ranging from theft to violent crimes. On August 24, 2017, the U.S. District Court of Northern California ruled in United States v. Ellis that the use of a Stingray constituted a search that requires a warrant, but did not suppress the evidence based on exigent circumstances and good faith exception. On September 21, 2017, the D.C. Court of Appeals ruled in Prince Jones v. United States that using a Stingray requires a warrant. On November 3, 2017, the New York Supreme Court in Brooklyn ruled in People v. Gordon that using a Stingray constitutes a search, thus requiring a warrant separate from a pen register/trap and trace order. On July 18, 2018, the U.S. District Court of Northern California ruled in United States v. Artis that the evidence obtained from a stingray device must be suppressed due to deficiencies in the warrants obtained by the Federal agents. On September 5, 2018, the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal issued two rulings. In the first, Florida v. Sylvestre, it affirmed the lower court's suppression of evidence obtained from the warrantless use of a Stingray because it is unconstitutional. In the second case, Ferrari v. Florida, it reversed the lower court's refusal to suppress evidence obtained from warrantless cell-site location information. On October 1, 2020, the Solano County Superior Court tentatively ruled in Oakland Privacy, et. al v. City of Vallejo that the city and its law enforcement could not use Stingray or any \\"cellular communications technology,\\" because it bypassed city government code that requires public discussion, voting, and a city council ordinance or resolution on such technology usage and related privacy policy. The city had allowed its police department to create privacy policy on the use of Stingray. See also * United States v.

Connections to government In 2014, the Qatari government issued a decree of names of participating schools in Qatar that were eligible for an educational voucher system for the 2014/2015 academic year. The al-Furqan primary school was listed among the 71 schools announced by Dr. Mohammed bin Abdul Wahid al- Hamadi, the Qatari Minister of Higher Education and Secretary General of the Supreme Education Council. The voucher system is intended to promote a higher quality of education in Qatar, improve the academic achievement standards, and raise the level of competition between schools. According to the voucher system, the Qatari government offers government-funded vouchers to Qatari parents who wish to send their children to private schools committed to teaching religious values, the Arabic languages, sciences, and history in accordance with the standards of the Supreme Education Council. The al-Furqan school was selected by the Qatari government as an institution that meets the standards and sources of the Supreme Education Council. Connections to Eid Charity The al-Furqan Schools have connections to the Qatar-based Sheikh Eid bin Mohammad al-Thani Charitable Association, or Eid Charity. In January 2009, the al-Furqan Schools submitted a check for QR 1 million (approximately US$274,593) to Eid Charity for the purpose of aid efforts in Gaza. During the same month, Eid Charity undertook three programs in cooperation with the al- Furqan preparatory and secondary schools entitled \\"Gaza, a Code of Honor.\\" In 2013, the al-Furqan Schools donated QR 1 million (approximately US$274,593) to support Eid Charity's assistance to Syrian refugees. Later that year, the Eid Charity Cultural Center established the Furqan Summer Center under the supervision of the Qatari Ministry of Islamic Affairs. The following December, al-Furqan again donated QR 250,000 (approximately $68,648) to Eid Charity's aid efforts for Syrian refugees. In 2015, a delegation of al-Furqan School students visited refugee camps for Syrian refugees in Turkey. Eid Charity recognized the al-Furqan Schools for their close partnership and support. Evidence of humanitarian activities  =Eid Charity= The al-Furqan Schools have provided substantial funding to Eid Charity, an organization with ties to terrorist organizations. A founding member of Eid Charity, Abd al- Rahman bin Umayr al-Nuaymi, is a U.S. Department of the Treasury Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) accused of overseeing the transfer of over $2 million per month to ISIS‚Äô predecessor, al-Qaeda in Iraq. Eid Charity has also been widely accused of transferring money to \\"Hamas charities\\" in the Gaza Strip, a mission that was boosted by the al-Furqan Schools financial assistance. Described as \\"the biggest and most influential activist Salafi- controlled relief organization in the world\\" in a Carnegie Endowment report, Eid Charity also had close ties to the now defunct Madid Ahl al-Sham fundraising campaign.http://carnegieendowment.org/files/kuwaiti_salafists.pdf Shut down by Qatari authorities in 2014, Madid Ahl al-Sham was cited by the al-Nusra Front as \\"one of the preferred conduits for donations.\\" Leadership The Director General of the al-Furqan Schools, Khalifa bin Mohammed al-Rabban.

Al-Suri was believed to be assassinated by an ISIL suicide attack in 2014, however ISIL denied involvement in the attack.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle- east-29135922 Militant activity Born in Aleppo, Syria, in 1963 as Mohamed al-Bahaiya, al-Suri's jihadist career has its roots in the failed Islamist uprising in Syria between 1979 and 1982, following which he fled Syria. During the 1990s al-Suri coordinated closely with Abu-Musab al-Suri, a Spanish-Syrian jihadist. Together they worked to establish jihadi volunteer centers, training camps and various media groups in Afghanistan. While both men worked closely with Bin Laden and al-Qaeda, they denied being members of al-Qaeda in a statement made in 1999. Around the time of the statement, al-Suri had been operating mostly out of Turkey and fled to Afghanistan. In 2004, al-Suri and Abu-Musab were linked to the 2004 Madrid bombing through a series of money transfers and personal contacts. A Spanish court document went on to name al- Suri as Bin Laden's \\"courier\\" in Europe. Another report refers to him as \\"a 'mid-level' activist‚Ä¶and a 'member of Usama bin Ladin's structures in Europe\\". Al-Suri was financially aided partly by Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi, a Qatari national. Nuaimi is a purported human rights activist and co-founder of Alkarama. On December 18, 2013, Nuaimi was placed on the United States Treasury's Specially Designated Global Terror List (SDTG). Nuaimi is accused of transferring $600,000 dollars to al-Suri and the intent to transfer approximately $50,000 more. Involvement in the Syrian Civil War and Ahrar al-Sham In 2011, al-Suri co-founded Ahrar al-Sham, a Sunni Syrian Islamist group, opposing Bashar al-Assad's government forces as part of the Islamic Front. Despite helping to found al-Sham and serving in its most senior ranks, al-Suri's involvement in the organization and his ties to al-Qaeda were kept secret, and he adopted a new nom de guerre: Abu Omeir al-Shami. Al Suri continued to use both names separately in statements, but it was not until after his death that the two were linked as the same person. In early 2013 infighting began between al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front and ISIL (then known only as ISI). It began with a recorded announcement on April 8 by ISI's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announcing an unauthorized merger between the two groups.http://www.pri.org/dispatch/news/afp/130409/qaeda-iraq-confirms-syrias- nusra-part-network Disagreements and conflicts between the two escalated by the end of 2013. Hostilities continued to worsen, with al-Nusra's leader, Abu Mohammed al-Julani, claiming in a 2014 interview that he saw no end to the conflict. In May 2013, the leader of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, sent a secret letter to al-Baghdadi in the hopes of quelling tensions between their two groups. The letter, dated 23 May 2013, asserts al-Qaeda's dominance and names al-Suri as al-Zawahiri's representative and delegate in Syria. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Abu Musab al-Suri, Abdullah Azzam, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Osama bin Laden were cited by Abu Khalid when he addressed ISIL. Assassination On February 21, 2014 five men entered al-Suri's headquarter compound in Aleppo and opened fire, then one of the gunman detonated his explosive pack. The attack killed al-Suri and six of his men. Syrian rebels mourned al-Suri's death on social media accounts, posting his photo and praising his actions in support of jihad. Al-Qaeda published a eulogy for al-Suri and uploaded a video of him at the al-Farouq training camp in Afghanistan, along with photos of him with Bin Laden. A rebel source was quoted saying \\"Sheikh Abu Khalid was an important Jihadi figure, he fought the Americans in Iraq and in Afghanistan. They (ISIL) gave the Americans a present, a free gift, by killing him.\\" Abu Khalid received condolences from Nusra Front member Abu Sulayman al Muhajir. Abu Khalid was praised by the Mujahideen Shura Council in the Environs of Jerusalem's media branch Ibn Taymiyya Media Center. Abu Khalid received condolences from Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Abu Firas al-Suri and Abu Khalid were praised in an Al-Qaeda video released by al-Zawahiri called \\"Three Sheikhs of Jihad\\". Abu Khalid appeared in photos with Ahrar ash-Sham chief Hassan Abboud. A photo of Abu Khaled al-Suri, Hassan Abboud, and Abu Firas al- Suri was released. Abu Khaled al-Suri was mentioned by Abu Firas al-Suri in a Nusra video which released more information on Abu Firas, such as his previous Muslim Brotherhood affiliation and his association with bin Laden and Abdullah Azzam.

Building a Movement  Project South holds monthly BAM retreats in Atlanta to train and educate community members who wish to get involved with and learn about the organization and general movement building. In addition to the monthly retreats, Project South holds BAM Institutes, year- long programs consisting of multiple sessions designed around a curriculum meant to facilitate a more in depth knowledge of education and movement building strategies.  University Sin Fronteras  The University Sin Fronteras was formed in 2010 as a collaboration between Project South and the Southwest Workers Union. According to Project South, the University Sin Fronteras is \\"a public and accessible space for education that advances systemic social change.\\" The organization works to educate and connect youth interested in social activism with more experienced community organizers.

Paterae can have any origin (volcanic, impact or other), although majority of them were created by volcanism. The term comes from Latin language, where it refers to a shallow bowl used in antique culture. This term is used in planetary nomenclature: it is a part of the international names of such features. In such names, it is capitalized and stands after the proper given name (e.g., Pillan Patera). Besides that, it can be used as a description term and applied even to unnamed features. Nature of paterae The term \\"patera\\", like other terms of planetary nomenclature, describes only the external view of the feature, but not its origin or geological structure. Majority of paterae of Venus, Mars and Io are volcanic craters or calderas, but some others (like Orcus Patera on Mars), probably, are impact craters. At least some of paterae on Triton and the only (as for 2016) named patera of Titan, Sotra Patera, most probably, have cryovolcanic origin. Some authors include low depth in defining criteria of paterae. There is no clear boundary between paterae and usual craters. Peculiarities of usage of the term According to some authors, actual usage of the term \\"patera\\" had deviated from its definition, and it became not only nomenclatural, but to some extent geological, being used to indicate volcanic origin of the feature. After Venusian Cleopatra Patera turned out to be an impact crater (instead of a volcanic one, as previously suggested), it was renamed into crater Cleopatra. Usually volcanic crater gets a proper name if the volcano itself is low and inconspicuous. Otherwise the volcanic mountain is named, and the crater remains unnamed. In some cases, names of Martian volcanic craters with the term \\"patera\\" were previously applied to the whole volcano, and it was reflected in values of their sizes given in IAU nomenclatural database. But in 2007, these names were tied to the craters themselves, and the corresponding volcanic mountains obtained names with the terms \\"Mons\\" or \\"Tholus\\". An example of such mountains is Alba Mons, which obtained its name 34 years after its crater Alba Patera. The geological term \\"highland patera\\" (a kind of low Martian volcanoes with radially channeled flanks), unlike the nomenclatural term \\"patera\\", refers to the whole volcano. Names of paterae The term \\"patera\\" (together with 12 other nomenclatural terms) was introduced into planetary nomenclature in 1973, on XV General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, when 9 Martian paterae, imaged by Mariner 9 in 1972-1973, were named. As of August 2016, 249 paterae or their assemblages are named: 144 on Io, 73 on Venus, 20 on Mars, 6 on Ganymede, 5 on Triton and 1 on Titan. They are named differently on different celestial bodies: * on Venus ‚Äì after famous women; * on Mars ‚Äì after a nearby albedo feature on classical maps by Giovanni Schiaparelli or Eug√®ne Antoniadi; * on Io ‚Äì after gods or heroes associated with fire, sun, thunder, volcanoes; after mythical blacksmiths; after associated eruptive centers; * on Ganymede ‚Äì after wadis of the Fertile Crescent; * on Titan ‚Äì after deities of happiness, peace and harmony of various peoples. But actually the only named patera of Titan is named after Norwegian island Sotra, inherited from cancelled name of associated bright spot Sotra Facula; * on Triton ‚Äì with water-associated names, excluding Greek and Roman.

In 1828-33 and again in 1840-45, 1849‚Äì54 and 1858‚Äì63, he represented Bank of Denmark (from 1832 as chairman) and became a member of the commission in the so-called Twelfth Million Case in 1838. Landowner In 1828, he acquired Brahesborg on the island of Funen. In 1835, he also acquired the former countship of Laurvig in Norway with Fritz√∏e Ironworks. He modernized the management of the estate and founded the Vilhelmsborg estate in 1846‚Äì47 . In 1854, he ceded the two estates to his two sons. His adopted step son Frederik Wilhelm Treschow received Brahesborg while his son Michael Treschow received Friz√∏e where he already acted as manager. Politician Treschow participated in the work leading to the adoption of the Constitution of Denmark as a representative appointed by the king. He was a member of Landstinget from 1849 until 1863. Philanthropy Treschows Stiftelse The site was one of two homes for needy women which built by the politician and supreme court attorney Frederik Treschow. He administered numerous trusts, including Admiral Winterfeldts Stiftelse \\"Tr√∏stens Bolig\\" which provided affordable housing for needy women. This may have inspired him to build similar facilities at his own expense. The first was built in the courtyard behind the Admiral building in 1847. The next was built in Christianshavn and consisted of two buildings completed in 1853 and 1857 to designs by Christian Tybjerg. In 1859, Treschow founded Det Treschow'ske Fideikommis (The Treschow Foundation)).

Ellaville was located at the merging place of the Suwannee River and Withlacoochee River.  History  Ellaville was founded in 1861 by George Franklin Drew a successful businessmen and future governor of Florida. Franklin decided to build a mansion on the western banks of Suwannee River. The town was named Ellaville for honoring one of his slaves named Ella. He and Louis Bucki then built a mill that employed over 500 people and was one of the largest in Florida at the time. Soon the Florida Railroad built a line to the town that had direct access to the mill. Soon after that the town was booming. The town was in its heyday in the early 1870s and had a train station, two schools, two churches, a steamboat dock, masonic lodge, commissary and a sawmill. It was also involved in turpentine, railroad car building and logging. The town even had 1,000 residents in its peak. Later on in 1876, Franklin the town's founder went on to be governor. The town then soon started to decline near the turn of the century starting when its mill burned down in 1898 but was rebuilt quickly.

Both of the rivers soon had flooded and with the onset of the Great Depression showed there was no future for the town and the post office closed in 1942.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built in 1937. It was also known as Roma State School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 September 1998.  History  Roma Government Complex is a three storey rendered brick building, influenced by Inter War Mediterranean style, facing Bungil Street. It was constructed in 1937 as the main building of Roma State School, providing primary education to children of Roma and district. Roma was the principal town of the Mount Abundance district, which was established as a pastoral and agricultural region after exploration by Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor General of New South Wales in 1846. It was originally settled by squatters, who established it as primarily a sheep grazing area. The township of Roma was proclaimed in September 1862, the first town formed in Queensland after its separation from New South Wales in 1859. Roma was named after Lady Diamantina Bowen (n√©e di Roma), wife of the first Governor of Queensland, Sir George Ferguson Bowen. She was the daughter of a Governor of the Ionian Islands and her maiden name was Countess Diamantina Georgina di Roma. Surveyor McDowall laid out the town reserving a section for public buildings bounded by Bungil, Charles, McDowall and Gregory streets. The first land sales were held in September 1863. The town of Roma was declared a municipality in 1867. Roma flourished with the advent of the Western railway line in the 1880s, ensuring the efficient transportation of stock and produce to the coastal ports. The vast Great Artesian Basin was tapped in Queensland in the late 1880s and early 1890s, securing an alternative water supply for cattle and sheep. In 1870 Roma State School, comprising simple timber school building and teachers residence, opened with an enrolment of 133 pupils. The Reserve for a National School, a two-acre site bounded by Bungil, Wyndham and Arthur Streets and two residential allotments, was proclaimed in 1871. A second school building, facing Wyndham Street, was constructed in 1899, allowing the separation of male and female instruction. This school building was enlarged through addition and verandah enclosure, thereby creating a series of new classrooms. In 1912 a verandah was enclosed to create space for a high school, with a separate site established and opened on 2 August 1920. In 1939 the original school building was sold to the RSL and relocated to Queen Street. In 1934, the Health Inspector Chas Clark, began to agitate for a new school building. He referred to the existing building environment as problematic in respect to the physical and educational development of the children. The Roma School Committee pressed for a new building, alluding to the established use of the Unemployment Relief Scheme for the construction of school buildings and departmental preference for provision of buildings for coastal urban centres. The plans were prepared by Maurice Guthrie, of the Architectural Branch of the Department of Public Works, in January 1935, however it took the School Committee a further two years to obtain an undertaking from the government on the construction of a new building. Brick was used as it was thought to be more substantial and cost effective, but perhaps more importantly, it provided employment for greater numbers of tradesmen, during the years of economic depression. The building was occupied in July 1938 and officially opened on 25 February 1939, providing accommodation for 432 children. It comprised eleven classrooms; a head teacher, male and female teachers rooms; cloakrooms and play area facilities underneath at the basement level. Conforming to sectional design, covered verandahs were incorporated on both the ground and first floor, along all but the southern side of the building. Ten of the classrooms, five on each floor, were interconnected by the use of sliding partitions. A stage was created by the incorporation of a raised floor beneath the western class room on the ground floor, providing multi functional use of class room space. The design was comparable to other brick school buildings built during this period of economic depression and reflects educational methodology of the time. A combination of inadequate size of the site for outdoor facilities, burgeoning attendance and movement to open plan teaching methods in the late 1960s and early 1970s saw major changes to Roma State School. The addition of a new library behind the main school building, in 1972, prevented the early suggested relocation of the school. However, in 1974, the school was divided into Roma Infants School for years 1‚Äì3, on a separate site in Quinton Street, and Roma Junior School for years 4‚Äì7, at the Bungil Street site. In 1986 the Education Department piloted a new prototype of school in the Roma Middle School incorporating grades 4‚Äì10 on the one larger 14 acre site at Cottel Street. In 1987, the Bungil Street school buildings were remodelled as Roma Government Complex accommodating the regional offices of the Education Department, Water Resources, Boating and Fishing and Forestry. In 1997, the reserve was subdivided into three lots with buildings on the front section. The rear section of the land, comprising two lots, was sold to the Bungil Shire Council and the Uniting Church in 1997.  Description  Roma Government Complex (former Roma State School) is located on a rectangular block bounded by Wyndham, Bungil and Arthur Streets and two vacant allotments. It is a substantial stuccoed brickwork building, influenced by Interwar Mediterranean style. It faces north toward Bungil Street and is aligned with that street. Roma Government Complex is a three storeyed building with a centrally located main entrance in a range that breaks forward one bay. The main entrance door is recessed into an arched opening, enriched with an archivolt and keystone, and flanked by two wrought iron bracketed lanterns. The contrasting colour of the basement level accentuates openings and entrance features on the ground and first floor. The split symmetrical stairwell finished with an open porch at main entrance level has simple wrought iron balastrading. A large square opening provides the central entrance to the basement level and is located beneath the entrance porch. It has archivolt and keystone patterns to match the main entrance. All three storeys have simple openings along the verandahs, facing the street. The ground floor, carries semi circular arches in contrast to the squared openings on the basement and first floor levels. Stair halls at each end of the building maximise the size of the major elevation to Bungil Street. On the basement level, symmetrical projecting door cases crowned with plain shields provide entrance to the stair halls. The roof, clad with asbestos cement tiles, is pitched and hipped except for the central range which terminates in a gable/pediment at both south and north elevations. The front gable is marked ROMA STATE SCHOOL with the date of construction, 1937, in the gable of the rear of the building. The building has relatively understated decorative features and fenestration patterns The main entrance is flanked by two grouped banks of casement windows crowned with a semi circular fanlight window. The light gently textured surface contrasts with the dark coloured timber windows located in the central range, the stair halls and the southern elevation. At the rear of the building eleven banks of four casements with fanlights are symmetrically placed on the ground and first floor. Identical grouped casement windows are located on the east and western face of the building. The verandahs are floored with polished concrete and double hung sash windows line this space. Each floor has three entrance doors to the office spaces. The offices are open plan, with fluorescent lights and a centrally located air conditioning duct. At the western end of the ground floor office area, are two offices which these located on a raised platform, separating them from the main office area. Bottle trees with small cairns and plaques, part of the Roma Avenue of Heroes, are located on the Bungil and Wyndham Streets footpaths. The front lawn area has six mature palm trees which are sympathetic with the architectural style of the building.  Heritage listing  Roma Government Complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 September 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Roma Government Complex, formerly Roma State School, is significant as a substantial stuccoed brick building that reflects regional prosperity of Roma as a pastoral service town. The impressive form of the Roma Government Complex is indicative of the relevant importance of Roma in relation to other towns in south western Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Roma Government Complex is an excellent regional example of a late Interwar school building, built as a part of the state government's depression initiatives under the Unemployment Relief Scheme. It is a good example of Queensland Public Works school building design and as such demonstrates the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural place. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The influence of Interwar Mediterranean style architecture and detailing creates an important aesthetic landmark in the town of Roma. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As the former Roma State School, the building has a significant association with almost 50 years of primary school education for the Roma community since 1937.

History  Soon after Romania, under the leadership of Ion Antonescu, joined the war on the Axis side and took part in the invasion of the Soviet Union, its administration extended over the Dniester and areas up to then forming part of the Ukrainian SSR (see Romania during World War II). By that time, the 700 local Jewish inhabitants had fled or had been killed by the Nazi German or Romanian troops. In October 1941, the Romanians established a detention camp in Vapniarka. One thousand Jews were brought to the site that month, mostly from the city of Odessa. Some 200 died in a typhus epidemic; the others were taken out of the camp in two batches, guarded by soldiers of the Romanian Gendarmerie, and shot to death. In 1942, 150 Jews from Bukovina were brought to Vapniarka. On September 16 of that year, 1,046 Romanian Jews were also brought to the camp. About half had been banished from their homes on suspicion of being communists, but 554 had been included without any specific charges being brought against them. This was the last transport to arrive at the camp; its status was changed to that of a concentration camp for political prisoners, under the direct control of the Romanian Minister of the Interior, Dumitru I. Popescu. In practice, Vapniarka was a concentration camp for Jewish prisoners, since no other political suspects were held there‚Äîthe only other inmates were several Ukrainian convicts. Of the 1,179 Jews in the camp, 107 were women, who were housed in two huts surrounded by a triple-apron barbed-wire fence. Among the Jewish prisoners were 130 members of the Romanian Communist Party, 200 Social Democrats, as well as Trotskyists and Zionists. Most of the prisoners, however, had been arrested on purely arbitrary grounds. The inmates established a camp committee to help them survive despite starvation, disease, hard labor, and physical and mental torture. Apart from the official committee, the camp also had an underground leadership, and, together, the two bodies persuaded the prisoners to observe discipline voluntarily. The father of Costin Murgescu, Ion, had \\"strong pro-Nazi sympathies\\"Egon Balas, Will to Freedom: A Perilous Journey through Fascism and Communism, Syracuse University Press, Syracuse, 2000, pp. 336 and by September 1942 he was the camp commandant in Vapniarka. He introduced severe restrictions on the supply of water. By keeping the camp meticulously clean, the prisoners were able to overcome the typhus epidemic, but they suffered from the poor quality of the food, which included Lathyrus sativus, a species of pea that was normally used to feed livestock, and barley bread that had a 20% straw content. A team of doctors among the inmates, led by Dr. Arthur Kessler of CernƒÉu≈£i, reached the conclusion that the disease presented all the symptoms of lathyrism,\\"Dr. Arthur Kessler (1903-2000)\\", in Lathyrus Lathyrism Newsletter, Vol. 3, pp. 3‚Äì4Dennis Deletant Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and His Regime, Romania, 1940-1944. Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2006, , p. 197; Kornis, pp. 228‚Äì229 a spastic paralysis caused by the oxalyldiaminopropionic acid present in the pea fodder. Within a few weeks, the first symptoms of the disease appeared, affecting the bone marrow of prisoners and causing paralysis. By January 1943, hundreds of prisoners were suffering from lathyrism. The inmates declared a hunger strike and demanded medical assistance. As a result, the authorities allowed the Jewish Aid Committee in Bucharest to supply them with medicine, and the prisoners' relatives were allowed to send them parcels. It was only at the end of January that the prisoners were no longer fed with the animal fodder that had caused the disease, but 117 Jews were paralyzed for life. In March 1943, it was found that 427 Jews had been imprisoned for no reason whatsoever. They were moved to various ghettos in Transnistria, but were sent back to Romania and released only in December 1943‚ÄìJanuary 1944. In October 1943, when the Soviet Red Army was approaching the region, it was decided to liquidate the camp. 80 Jews were sent to ghettos in Transnistria. 54 Communists were taken to a prison in R√Æbni≈£a, Transnistria, where they were killed in their cells by SS men on March 19, 1944. A third group, which included most of the prisoners (565 persons), was moved to Romania in March 1944 and imprisoned in the camp for political prisoners in T√¢rgu Jiu, until after the fall of the Antonescu government in August (see King Michael Coup). Many of the former prisoners in Vapniarka were appointed to senior posts in Communist Romania, among them Simion Bughici (who became Foreign Minister).

However, John J.'s more noted (important) legal cases and/or counsel appearances were found with litigation that reached the New York Supreme Court. See Further Reading section below.  Legal text Though not technically a treatise like Wigmore's, McKelvey's key legal writings, especially his two most popular texts have been revised and re-released at several intervals: * Principles of Common Law Pleading * Handbook of the Law of Evidence Like his books, McKelvey's journal article \\"The Law School Review, 1887 ‚Äì 1937\\", which originally appeared in the Harvard Law Review, is available at libraries, in full text via on-line databases. In 1917, McKelvey explained in retrospect, the Columbia Jurist was his inspiration for establishing a law review at Harvard. McKelvey's April 1937 written assessment touched on the influence of the law review model and explained the founding purpose of the Harvard Law Review. Metaphorically, McKelvey described the law school review as a pebble innocently tossed upon immeasurable water, with an effect beyond the initial pulsating ripple, unclear. However, the organic quest for truth always yields fruit; thereby worthy of human effort toward fairness and justice, and as long as the law school review holds fast to honestly, genuinely, and thoughtfully pursuing truth, its purpose will be justified and fruitful and its existence sustained.  Community involvement and membership Mr. McKelvey practiced community building, finding clients, membership, and participation in numerous organizations, including those listed below: Academia * Oberlin College, Trustee Nominee * Barnard School for Boys, Inc., Trustee Arts * American Museum of Natural History * Metropolitan Museum of Art Church * Edgehill Church, Founder, Incorporator, Trustee, Spuyten Duyvil Civic * Hudson‚ÄìFulton Celebration Commission (Bronx, Contracts Committee) * Henry Hudson Monument Association (Secretary, Fundraiser) * Park District Protective League (Trustee) Legal * American Bar Association * New York State Bar Association * New York City Bar Association * Harvard Law Association Library * Oberlin College Library (Book Collection & Monetary Donations) Social * Ardsley City (now Country) Club * City Reform Club, New York City * Harvard Club of New York City * New York Oberlin Alumni Association  Politics and religion  In print and in person Mr. John Jay McKelvey may have been described as an independent DemocratChamberlain, Joshua Lawrence, William Roscoe Thayer, Charles Henry Smith, John DeWitt, Jesse Lynch Williams, John Howard Van Amringe, Charles E.

History The Pugu are recorded as existing during the Shang and were counted among the \\"Eastern Barbarians\\" or Dongyi of Qingzhou. They occupied the shore of the Bay of Bohai around present-day Binzhou and Boxing, an area which the silt deposition from the present course of the Yellow River has since made miles inland. In alliance with the Shang prince Wu Geng, Pugu joined the Dongyi of Yan (, near present-day Qufu) and Xu in the Huai valley in opposing Shang's replacement by the Zhou after the Battle of Muye. This insurrection joined with the Rebellion of the Three Guards within Zhou itself, opposing the regency of the Duke of Zhou . The Duke undertook a successful campaign across the North China Plain, defeating Wu Geng and forcing the submission of the opposing Yi. Pugu's area was granted to the minister Jiang Ziya as the fief of Qi. The Bamboo Annals record that during the Duke of Zhou's expedition the \\"royal troops... attacked Yan and destroyed Pugu\\". The word used () means \\"destroy\\" and even implies \\"extermination\\". This was, however, patently hyperbolic since \\"belligerents\\" required a combined response from Qi, Lu, and Zhou ten years later and the Pugu are again said to have been \\"destroyed\\" in the autumn three years after that.. During the reign of King Yi, Duke Hu moved the Qi capital to the former site of Pugu. This prompted the residents of the former capital Yingqiu to revolt under another member of his house, who defeated him in battle and restored the former capital. Legacy Its name survived as Putai and Putai County as late as the 20th century, although the former is now the subdistrict of Pucheng in Binzhou and the latter has merged with Boxing County.

The frame, Gothic Revival, Immanuel Lutheran Church (1904) is located on Second Street, and is individually listed on the National Register. Kimballton's growth was first spurred by a division in the Danish Lutheran Church in the United States. A Grundtvigian congregation was established in town and that drew people here. The residential area that is the subject of this historic district was platted after the Atlantic Northern Railroad came to town in 1907. The town itself was incorporated the following year. The first house was built in the district in 1895, but it has subsequently been torn down. The oldest extant house dates from 1907, and a total of 27 dwellings (77%) were built in the economic boom years after the railroad arrived (1907-1918). Five houses were built in the 1920s for Danish immigrants who retired here from their farms, and another house was moved in for a retiree. That trend continued after 1940 as well.

History In 1925 Samuel Beecher Hart, an African-American state legislator from Philadelphia,Samuel Beecher Hart, from Pennsylvania House of Representatives. introduced a bill in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to commission a monument honoring 150 years of service in the U.S. military by Pennsylvania African Americans.Ernst Jockers, J. Otto Schweizer: The Man and His Work, (Philadelphia: International Printing Company, 1953), pp. 62-65. The Sesquicentennial Exposition, a world's fair celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, was to open in Philadelphia the following year, and Hart's hope may have been that the monument would be one of the fair's attractions. His bill was defeated in 1925, but he resubmitted it in 1927, and it passed. It specified an appropriation of $100,000, but this was reduced to $60,000 in the state senate, then reduced to $50,000 by Governor John Stuchell Fisher. In 1921 Philadelphia had erected twin Civil War monuments - one for soldiers, one for sailors; both modeled by sculptor Hermon Atkins MacNeil and carved by the Piccirilli Brothers - on the newly completed Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The Parkway also was the intended site for the All Wars Memorial. =Site wars= Soldiers. The bill created a 7-person Colored Soldiers Statue Commission to oversee the monument's completion, and all five of the governor's appointees (which included Hart) were African Americans. Twelve sculptors participated in a design competition, and J. Otto Schweizer was judged the winner. A contract was signed with him in March 1929, but it took five years to agree on a site. Philadelphia's Art Jury ruled against placing the monument on the Parkway, arguing that it needed to \\"avoid turning the Parkway into an 'Avenue of War Memorials' since most are more or less mediocre, due either to lack of funds or misdirected efforts.\\" Instead, the Art Jury proposed that it be placed in Fitler Square, at 23rd & Pine Streets, a small park in a white, largely-Irish, working-class neighborhood. John Marquess, a prominent African-American leader, protested: \\"God forbid that we of the Negro group should stand by and permit our patriotism to be insulted.\\" He dismissed Fitler Square as \\"a wilderness in a God-forsaken section of this metropolitan city. ... Dirty children, drunken bums, pot hounds of sure mongrel strain--these were the lot which sported on the spot where was to be erected a monument to heroic Negro soldier dead.\\"\\"War Monument Site Attacked by Marquess,\\" The Philadelphia Tribune, September 25, 1930, p. 1; quoted in Lieberman, p. 24. The state commission refused to agree to the Fitler Square site, which left the project at a stalemate. In early March 1934, with the monument's dedication scheduled for May 30, the Fairmount Park Commission proposed a temporary site on the Parkway with the permanent site to be left undetermined. This compromise was rejected by the Art Jury. City Councilman Henry Trainer, a white Republican, introduced a resolution that the monument be permanently placed on the Parkway, which was approved by a majority in City Council and signed by the mayor. This was a cynical gesture by Trainer and the mayor, since legal authority for placement of Philadelphia monuments rested solely with the Art Jury, but the ploy improved their popularity with black voters and both politicians won re-election. Applying more pressure, W. E. Garrett Gilmore of the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, owner of an apartment house facing Fitler Square, appealed to the Art Jury in a March 15, 1934 letter: \\"At the present time we have some very desirable tenants living in these apartments, and we feel that such a statue opposite the apartments would cause us a loss of tenancy.\\"Ilene D. Lieberman, \\"Race and Remembrance: Philadelphia's All Wars Memorial to Colored Soldiers and Sailors and the Politics of Place,\\" The American Art Journal, vol. 29, no. 1/2 (1998), pp. 18-51. The City Council resolution also raised the ire of other groups whose monuments had been rejected for the Parkway: \\"The War Mothers and the World War Veterans objected that if their war memorials could not obtain a Parkway site, no one's should, least of all a monument to African American servicemen.\\" Under attack from all sides, in April the Art Jury tried to pressure the state commission into agreeing to the Fitler Square site. The commission refused, and threatened to erect the monument in another Pennsylvania city. The Art Jury backed down somewhat, and the parties agreed to a compromise site in West Fairmount Park, on Lansdowne Avenue behind Memorial Hall, the art gallery left over from the 1876 Centennial Exposition. The monument's dedication was postponed - its bronze plaque still reads \\"Dedicated May 30, 1934\\" - and took place on July 7, 1934. State Representative Hart gave an address at the ceremonies, and his 11-year-old granddaughter Doris was one of six children who pulled cords unveiling the monument. =Relocation= Over the decades, there were numerous proposals to relocate the monument to a more prominent site, but they were abandoned due to lack of funds. In 1994 the City's Art Commission (descendant of the Art Jury) recommended the relocation of the monument to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell endorsed this, and City Council appropriated $200,000 to make it possible. The intended relocation was announced at a May 9, 1994 press conference attended by State Representative Hart's granddaughter and two granddaughters of the sculptor, J. Otto Schweizer.David Bittan, \\"Black Veterans Statue Moving,\\" The Philadelphia Daily News, May 10, 1994. The monument underwent a thorough restoration, and was re-dedicated on Veterans Day, November 11, 1994. Hart's granddaughter, Doris Jones Holliday, one of the children who had unveiled the monument 60 years earlier, again did the honors.Daniel Rubin, \\"In Heart Of City, Basking In Glory Veterans Day Marchers Greet A Long-slighted African American Monument,\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer, November 12, 1994. Assessment All Wars Memorial to Colored Soldiers and Sailors (right of center) is dwarfed by the Franklin Institute behind it. Art historian Ilene D. Lieberman notes the great rarity of an early twentieth century civic monument that honors African Americans, or even one that features black figures on an equal or near-equal standing with white figures. She compares the All Wars Memorial to Boston's Robert Gould Shaw Memorial (1884), where sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens paid honor to the all-black 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment by individualizing the faces of the soldiers. There, the bas-relief black soldiers form a chorus in support of the near- freestanding equestrian statue of Shaw, the white officer on his horse. In the Philadelphia monument the black soldiers and sailors are not a chorus or even supporting players, they are on an equal standing with the white goddesses. Lieberman reminds us that the All Wars Memorial was conceived, executed and dedicated at a time when the U.S. military remained rigidly segregated, and black soldiers' ability and courage were constantly questioned (or dismissed). \\"Despite this persistent intimidation on and off the battlefield, African Americans continued to serve in the armed forces, thereby proving their loyalty to a country that still actively discriminated against them.\\" She sees problems with the relocated monument's siting: Its front, with Justice and the six black soldiers and sailors, faces the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and the busy traffic circle; but its reverse, with the four white goddesses, faces the Franklin Institute and the 20th Street sidewalk, and is much more likely to be viewed by pedestrians and motorists. Unfortunately, like the colossal statue of William Penn atop Philadelphia City Hall, the monument faces northeast, leaving the figures of Justice and the black servicemen in shadow for much of the day.

Her work is in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences, including philosophy of psychology and philosophy of psychiatry, as well as bioethics and medical ethics. She was educated at the University of Bologna, King's College London, University of Oxford and the Australian National University, and worked briefly at the University of Manchester before beginning at Birmingham, where she has been a lecturer, senior lecturer, reader and now professor. She has published four sole- authored books: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science (Polity Press, 2008); Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs (Oxford University Press, 2009); Irrationality (Polity, 2014).; an The Epistemic Innocence of Irrational Beliefs (Oxford University Press, 2020). Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs, in which Bortolotti challenges the argument that delusions cannot be beliefs due to their irrationality, was the winner of the 2011 American Philosophical Association book prize. In addition, she edited Philosophy and Happiness (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009) and Delusions in Context (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) and co-edited Psychiatry as Cognitive Neuroscience: Philosophical Perspectives (Oxford University Press, 2009). Education Bortolotti studied philosophy at the University of Bologna, spending several months at the University of Leeds, graduating in 1997. Her undergraduate dissertation, supervised by Eva Picardi, was on conceptual relativism. In 1998, she graduated with an MA in philosophy from King's College London. Here, she wrote on scientific revolutions under Donald Gillies. Next, she moved to the University of Oxford, where she read for a BPhil. Her thesis, supervised by Bill Newton-Smith, was on \\"the rationality debate in philosophy and the cognitive sciences\\". Bortolotti read for her PhD at the Australian National University. Her doctoral thesis, which was supervised by Martin Davies, challenged Donald Davidson's account of belief ascription. She completed her PhD in 2004. Career The ebook version of Bortolotti's 2018 edited collection Delusions in Context. Bortolotti worked as a research associate at the University of Manchester from 2004‚Äì2005.

While held to be beliefs in the medical literature, the status of delusions is disputed by philosophers, who have denied that delusions are beliefs on account of their deeply unusual content‚Äîsuch as the delusion that one is actually dead‚Äîand because they work differently from paradigmatic beliefs. For example, delusions are often maintained despite overwhelming counter-evidence, or are not reacted to in the way one would expect given their content. After setting out the background to the question, Bortolotti explores whether the procedural irrationality of delusions‚Äîthe fact that they do not rationally relate to the other intentional states of the agent‚Äîjustifies the denial that they are beliefs. She denies that it does, given that many paradigm beliefs display failures of procedural rationality. She then moves on to the epistemic irrationality of delusions, i.e., the fact that they are not supported by evidence. This can also not be used to challenge the status of delusions as beliefs, she argues, as many widespread ordinary beliefs are also epistemically irrational. She next addresses the idea that delusions are not beliefs as, first, they are not acted upon in the appropriate way, and, second, people with delusions cannot provide good reasons for their holding the content of the delusion. Though allowing that these characterisations of people with delusions can be correct, she argues that these failures of so- called agential rationality can also be found in people who do not have delusions. Bortolotti holds that the status of thoughts which subjects do not endorse (such as inserted thoughts) as beliefs is in question, but that beliefs that are both endorsed and self-ascribed contribute to one's conception of self as part of a self-narrative. She concludes her book by rejecting the rationality constraint on belief ascription. She challenges the idealisation of beliefs, but endorses the goal of separating beliefs and other intentional states. She argues that the difference between delusional and normal beliefs must concern more than their epistemic features. The difference between delusions and irrational (but non-delusional) beliefs is, she claims, one of degree, and not one of kind.

It enjoyed prosperous trade with merchants from all corners of Africa including Arabs towards the end of the 20th century. History The Karagwe kingdom was part of the many Great Lakes Kingdoms in East Africa. The kingdom reached its apex during the 19th century. The growth occurred during the early part of the 1800s with King Ndagara who came to power around 1820 and ruled until 1853 at which time he was replaced by King Rumanika.Israel.K.Katooke Economy During the height of the Karagwe kingdom agriculture played an important role in local economics. Many Karagwe were cattle herders and so cows were a measure of wealth and power. Iron production also played a key part in the economic balances within the kingdom. The location of Karagwe land in what is today north-western Tanzania allowed them to participate in regional trade routes that connected the Ugandan and Rwandan states and merchants from the Eastern coast and the rest of eastern Africa.

He is perhaps best known for his involvement with the murder of fellow American Indian Movement activist Anna Mae Aquash. Early life Looking Cloud is a Lakota Sioux who grew up on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Legal history =Murder of Anna Mae Aquash= Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash was a female activist within the ranks of the American Indian Movement. On 12 December 1975, Looking Cloud, along with Theda Nelson Clarke and John \\"John Boy Patton\\" Graham, forced Aquash into the back of a car and drove her to a remote part of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, where Aquash was shot execution style in the back of the head and left to die. Her body was discovered on 24 February 1976 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation at the bottom of a ravine located in close proximity to an isolated highway. Aquash was revealed to have been shot dead; the muzzle of the gun had been pressed into the back of her neck, as the autopsy revealed. The coroner's report indicated that in addition to the fatal gunshot wound, exposure contributed to the death of Aquash. =Arrest= On 27 March 2003, Looking Cloud, who was a 49-year-old homeless man, was seen walking down Colfax Avenue by Denver police detective, Abe Alonzo. Looking Cloud was subsequently arrested on a warrant issued by federal authorities in South Dakota, in which Looking Cloud and another man were accused of shooting Pictou-Aquash during a kidnapping in December 1975 near Wanblee, South Dakota. United States v. Looking Cloud Darlene Nichols testified that Leonard Peltier, an AIM activist who was convicted of killing two FBI agents in the Jumping Bull Compound Shootout (officially designated RESMURS by the FBI), told her and Aquash that he killed two FBI agents during a June 1975 shootout (known as the Jumping Bull Compound Shootout) at a Pine Ridge ranch. According to Ecoffey's testimony, \\"He said the (expletive) was begging for his life, but I shot him anyway.\\" According to Nichols-Ecoffey, she, along with Leonard Peltier, her sisters Bernie Nichols- Lafferty and Barbara Robideau, then-husband Dennis Banks and others were riding in a recreational vehicle lent to the American Indian Movement by the Hollywood actor Marlon Brando when Peltier recounted this event. Nichols also testified to how she had heard Peltier say he thought Aquash was a snitch. During the trial, Nichols testified as to several incidents of violence involving the American Indian Movement. Three of these incidents, The Custer Courthouse Riot Incident which involved several hundred people, the seventy- one day occupation of Wounded Knee, and a shoot-out near her home which killed two FBI agents. Nichol also discussed suspicions nearly twenty members of the American Indian Movement had of Aquash being an informant, or were at least acquainted with the rumor. Nichols also testified that several members, one of whom had already threatened Aquash's life because he suspected she was an informant, took Aquash away for weeks to \\"watch her,\\" explaining that was constantly under the surveillance of the American Indian Movement, was not allowed to go anywhere alone, and was not permitted to go home despite her requests to do so. Mathalene White Bear, another former member of the American Indian Movement who provided shelter to Aquash in 1975, testified that Aquash believed her life was in danger as early as September of that year. Darlene Nichols testified that Leonard Crow Dog and Leonard Peltier thought Aquash was an informant, and that Nichols, her daughter, and Dennis Banks, heard Peltier say he thought Aquash was an informant. For his involvement in the murder of Aquash, Looking Cloud confessed that he drove Aquash from Denver to Rapid City and then to the location where Aquash was murdered; however, he alleged that he knew nothing of the plan to execute Aquash, and that it was AIM member John Graham, alias John Boy Patton, who shot Aquash. Richard Two Elk would later provide testimony in the federal trial involving the murder of activist Annie Mae Pictou-Aquash. Two Elk provided testimony which indicated that Arlo Looking Cloud contacted him around the autumn of 1994, asking for advice on how to respond to authorities who were delving deeper into the mystery of Aquash's murder, in Two Elk stated that Looking Cloud admitted to being involved in the case. Two Elk stated that he believed his adopted brother was involved in the murder of Anna Mae and that over the years, Looking Cloud was only \\"acting on orders.\\" In February 2004, after a federal jury (consisting of 7 women and 5 men) deliberated for seven hours, they convicted Arlo Looking Cloud in the 1975 execution-style slaying of Anna Mae Aquash. Appeal In 2005, Looking Cloud appealed the verdict to the United States Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, but the appeal was struck down and his mandatory life prison term life-sentence was upheld and affirmed. Plea deal In August 2011, U.S. District Judge Lawrence Piersol signed an order which reduced Looking Cloud's original life-sentence term to 20 years in exchange for previous testimony given to state prosecutors during December 2010 against co-conspirator John Graham. Looking Cloud's testimony provided further insight into the murder of Aquash, with Looking Cloud alleging that he stood nearby while Graham shot Aquash. Looking Cloud is assigned BOP# 07609-073 currently at FTC Oklahoma City with a scheduled release date of November 10, 2020. Legacy The court proceedings against Looking Cloud have left lingering divisions. There are some factions who believe that Looking Cloud was innocent. According to Russell Means, American Indian Movement founder and member, racism was at the heart the federal jury conviction of Looking Cloud. He was quoted as saying, \\"Racism continues. Our culture is disregarded and not included, and one of the most pathetic men in the city of Denver is given the sole responsibility for the murder ordered by a leader of the American Indian Movement. I'm just thoroughly disgusted and supremely disappointed.\\" Looking Cloud alleges he was given alcohol and heroin prior to having a confession \\"coerced\\" out of him. On 28 April 2005, in a handwritten letter, Looking Cloud alleged that his trial attorney, Timothy Rensch, conspired with Bruce Ellison, an attorney for Leonard Peltier. According to Looking Cloud, \\"I received a letter informing me that Vernon B. Bellecourt provided all my legal material in my case to Laliberte [Graham's attorney] in Canada, apparently getting it from Gilbert Arlo's appeal attorney. And I read Vernon and Gilbert go way back. And how hard Rensch worked to make sure Candy Hamilton couldn't mention Bruce Ellison's name. Rensch, his former law partner Leech and Ellison go way back.\\" According to Barry Bacharach, an attorney for Peltier, the testimony used to convict Looking Cloud was not based on proof or evidence of Looking Cloud for wrongdoing, but based on testimony which focused primarily on leaders and prominent activists within the American Indian Movement, Peltier included. Similarly, Looking Cloud's court-appointed attorney, Timothy Rensch, was criticized for not putting a better defense together for Looking Cloud. In his appeal for a new trial, Looking Cloud also included in his appeal a new attorney, but it was also denied. And despite Looking Cloud's plea bargain which involved exchanging testimony against John Graham, the Graham Defense Committee indicated that it would help Looking Cloud form a legal appeals team. According to a representative from the Graham Defense Committee, in addition to Looking Cloud's conviction being based on a lack of forensic evidence, they also indicated that, \\"Yet the Graham Defense committee will help form a legal appeals team for Looking Cloud. Why help him with he implicated John? We don't believe he intended to implicate John.\\" References External links *Friends and Supporters of Arlo Looking Cloud 20th-century Native Americans Native American activists Members of the American Indian Movement People from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota Lakota people Sioux people Native American history of South Dakota 20th-century American criminals 1970s in South Dakota American kidnappers American people convicted of murder Murder in 1975 Crimes in South Dakota Kidnappings in the United States Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government People convicted of murder by United States jurisdictions Jackson County, South Dakota Living people 1954 births ","title":"Arlo Looking Cloud"},{"id":"51346074","text":"Marengo, Washington may refer to: *Marengo, Adams County, Washington *Marengo, Columbia County, Washington ","title":"Marengo, Washington"},{"id":"51346076","text":"Preethi Dubey is an Indian field hockey player.

It was designed by Cavanagh & Cavanagh and built from 1931 to 1932 by George Power Williams. It is also known as HACBS Hall. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 April 2001.  History  The Hibernian Hall in Roma is a large, timber-framed hall-cum-picture theatre erected in 1932 for the Roma branch of the Hibernian Australasian Catholic Benefit Society. It was designed by Perth and Brisbane architects Cavanagh & Cavanagh. Roma was the principal town of the Mount Abundance district, which was developed as a pastoral and agricultural region following exploration by Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor General of New South Wales in 1846. The township of Roma was proclaimed in September 1862, one of the earliest towns established in Queensland after separation from New South Wales in 1859, and was surveyed in 1863. It was named after Lady Bowen (the Countess Diamantina Georgina di Roma), daughter of a Governor of the Ionian Islands, and wife of the first Governor of Queensland, Sir George Ferguson Bowen. The town of Roma was declared a municipality in 1867 and grew slowly as a pastoral service centre and government administrative centre until the opening of the Western railway line in the 1880s, connecting the Maranoa to the coastal ports, after which the town flourished. In addition, the vast Great Artesian Basin was tapped in the late 1880s and early 1890s, securing an alternative water supply for cattle and sheep. With the expansion of Roma's population in the 1880s, a branch of the Hibernian Australasian Catholic Benefit Society was established in the town in April 1886. At its peak, the society attracted nearly 180 members. \\"Hibernian\\" is defined as of or belonging to Ireland, or Irish. From the 1860s Irish immigration to Queensland was encouraged by the Catholic Church in Queensland. Thousands of Catholic Irish working class emigrants were attracted to the colony, and although they settled widely, they tended to form enclaves within towns and districts, defined by their religion and their societies. Hibernian Associations flourished in late 19th/early 20th century Queensland, strongly supported by the Catholic Church, and attracted widespread Irish Catholic membership. They could be considered the voluntary social welfare extension of official Catholicism. Benefit societies were popular in 19th century Australia, where self-help was the dominant philosophy and liberalism a principal ideology, and where colonial governments made little provision for public welfare benefits. Modelled on similar mutual benefit societies established in Britain, the Australian societies provided contributing members with access to financial assistance such as sickness benefits, life insurance, provision of funeral costs, and benefits to members' widows and families. Some societies lent money to their members to finance home construction. Benefit societies also operated as social clubs, organising events such as dances and sports days which played an important role in the social life of the community, particularly in country districts. Roma Hibernians organised sports days, campdrafts and rodeos until 1946. The Roma HACBS acquired the site of the present hall late in 1899, and erected their first hall on this property in 1900. Later an open-air cinema was established beside the Hibernian Hall, on the south side, which was the venue for the first moving picture show exhibited at Roma. This first hall was enlarged in the mid-1920s, to plans prepared by popular Perth and Brisbane architects Cavanagh & Cavanagh, who had designed a number of churches, convents, schools and presbyteries for the Catholic Church in Queensland. The extensions had been completed by May 1926, at which time the hall was described as a two- storeyed timber building with a gallery; it could seat 750, and could be used for a variety of public entertainments. This building was destroyed by fire on 22 July 1931, but almost immediately the HACBS commissioned Cavanagh & Cavanagh to prepare plans for a replacement hall-cum-picture theatre (the present building) by GP Williams. The architects called tenders in October‚ÄìNovember 1931, with the contract let to Roma contractor GP Williams. The building was erected at a cost of , and was officially opened on 28 June 1932. The double-storeyed facade of the new Hibernian Hall, with its stepped parapet and curved pediment, oriel window to the projection room above an ungated opening to the foyer and ticket-box, read more as a picture theatre than a community hall. The building demonstrated many of the principal elements of \\"tropical\\" picture theatre design of this era, including: panels of open timber lattice high along each side wall, just under the roofline and sheltered by the eaves, for cross-ventilation purposes; a row of large bi-fold doors along each side of the hall which could be opened in hot weather, those on the southern side opening to a covered promenade along the side of the building; pressed metal and fretwork panels in the auditorium ceiling, accommodating ventilation and acoustic requirements with decorative effect; a decorative pressed metal proscenium arch; a stage area which could accommodate live performance as well as film screenings; and the projection booth (or bio- box) located above the foyer and ticket box. Elements more characteristic of a hall than a picture theatre were the flat, sprung timber floor, the lack of a dress circle, the inclusion of a supper room beneath the stage, and the lack of a theatre cafe. The Hibernian Hall screened films in competition with Roma's newly completed, 800 seat Capitol Theatre, likely designed by Brisbane cinema architect CE Humphreys. The Capitol, operated by RA Crawford, was erected and functioned as a cinema until destroyed by fire in 1989. That the town of Roma could support two picture theatres in the 1930s illustrates the popularity of film as family entertainment prior to the introduction of television. The Hibernian Hall functioned as much more than a picture theatre. The scale and facilities of the new building guaranteed its popularity as the premier venue for community and social events in Roma, including balls, dances, fetes, choral and school concerts, protest meetings, farewell functions, election meetings, political speeches, religious festivals, art shows, and touring entertainment (everything from ballet, opera and theatre to vaudeville and pantomime). The Hibernian Hall also served as a temporary venue for services when the new Catholic Church was being built, and as the venue for sittings of the Supreme Court. The hall was acquired by the Roma Town Council in 1976 and continues to be used for community and social activities, including regular roller-skating. It no longer functions as a picture theatre.  Description  The Hibernian Hall is a large, predominantly timber framed building, rectangular in form, roofed in short-length corrugated iron sheeting. It has an entrance area with a bio-box over a large auditorium and a stage area. There are later skillion-roofed extensions to the rear (east) end and a large shed structure attached via a covered walkway to the south-east corner of the building. The front (west) elevation comprises a two-storeyed decorative gable structure with asymmetric single-storeyed wing walls to the side. The ground floor and wing walls are of rendered masonry construction, while the first storey decorative gable is formed in pressed metal sheeting over timber. The ground floor has a centrally placed open entrance, over which is a cantilevered awning with pressed metal detailing. There are two symmetrically placed windows with decorative architraves. The window on the south side is a 6:9 pane timber vertical sliding sash, the window on the north side is a 6:1 pane timber vertical sliding sash. The side wing walls are terminated by a pilaster with a decorative cap. The north wall which has a pair of vertical timber doors, acts purely as a screen wall with no building behind. The south wall has a 6:4 pane timber vertical sliding sash window and a timber door giving access to a store room. The first storey facade, set between 2 pilasters with decorative caps, is based on the Dutch gable style. There is a centrally placed oriel window with a pressed metal base and corrugated iron hipped roof. The side lights are single 4:1 pane timber vertical sliding sashes and the front light is a pair of 6:1 pane timber vertical sliding sashes. There is a single 4:1 pane vertical sliding sash window placed symmetrically either side of the oriel. These windows have a hood supported on decorative brackets. Above the oriel there are the initials \\"H.A.C.B.S.\\" in raised lettering inside a curved border. There is a single shamrock on the face of the pilasters. The side elevations are of a similar design, with the south side having a single-storeyed skillion-roofed awning over a promenade or verandah. The walls comprise 9 bays, which reflect the internal layout of the building, with the bay at the western end for the 2 storey entrance/store/bio-box area, 7 bays to the auditorium, and 1 bay at the eastern end for the stage area. The walls are constructed of timber framing. There are 7 external concrete buttresses along each wall, between which there are 5 pairs of timber bi-fold doors with skylight over. On either side, beneath the roof line, there are 7 high level panels of later metal vertical louvres providing cross-ventilation to the auditorium, with remnant panels of timber lattice above, which have been sheeted from the inside of the auditorium. Above the doors on the north side there is horizontal boarding (chamfers). On the south side, beneath the verandah awning, there is exposed stud framing above the doors. The verandah has a store at the western end, is open for the length of the auditorium and has toilets at the eastern end. The walls to the stage area are clad in horizontal boarding. The rear (eastern) elevation is of timber framing clad in vertical sheets of corrugated iron. There are 2 windows at the northern end of this rear wall, one to the rear of the stage and another to a supper room located beneath the stage. There is also a fire-escape door to the sub-floor supper room. There is a modern lean- to extension at the southern end of the rear wall, clad in vertical metal sheeting, containing changing rooms. Internally, inside the entrance there is a centrally placed 3-sided ticket booth. To the south side is a store room, and to the north a staircase to the first floor bio-box. The auditorium is accessed through 2 pairs of bi-fold doors either side of the ticket booth. There are also 3 single doors in the western wall providing access to the ticket box, a store room and the staircase. The bio-box window has been in- filled. The auditorium has a seven bay canted ceiling comprising alternative bays of decorative pressed metal and open timber lattice. The floor is timber and level, suitable for dancing. The walls are of vertical timber with a dado rail running around. At the northern end is a raised stage area which projects into the auditorium. The proscenium arch is formed from decorative pressed metal sheeting. There are doors either side of the stage. The door at the south side is blocked by a single flight of metal stairs. The rear stage area has open stud timber framed walls and an exposed roof framing. There is no fly tower, but the roof over the stage is probably of sufficient height to accommodate some raised scenery. There is a supper room beneath the stage area. The southern verandah opens onto a large courtyard, the site of the former open-air cinema, which is used now as a basketball court. At the rear of the courtyard is a substantial canteen and shelter shed, clad in vertical metal sheeting.  Heritage listing  Hibernian Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 April 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Hibernian Hall, 38-44 Hawthorne Street, Roma is important in illustrating the pattern of Queensland's history, the scale of the hall illustrating the importance of Roma as a regional and recreational centre for the surrounding pastoral and agricultural district, and the importance of community groups in maintaining the social fabric of rural communities in the first half of the 20th century. The place has a strong association with the work of the Roma branch of the Hibernian Australasian Catholic Benefit Society from the turn of the 20th century through to the 1970s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Hibernian Hall remains highly intact, and is an excellent example of a large, purpose-designed hall-cum- picture theatre of the interwar period. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type, including the \\"picture theatre\\" facade; the projection booth above the foyer and ticket-box; the large auditorium with its use of decorative pressed metal and timber lattice in the ceiling; the use of timber lattice panelling high in the side walls for cross-ventilation purposes; the stage which could accommodate both live-performance and film screenings; the large, sprung timber dance floor opening onto an external verandah promenade; and the inclusion of a supper room. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has aesthetic value, engendered by the two-storeyed, shaped-pediment facade with its pressed metal finish and oriel window above a central foyer opening and awning; and by the interior detailing, including the use of pressed metal and timber latticing. The Hibernian Hall is a substantial structure with a decorative front facade designed to impress, is prominently located on a major street, and in form, materials, scale and design, makes a strong contribution to the townscape of Roma. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has social value, being the venue for a diversity of community, social and recreational events over many decades. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has a strong association with the work of the Roma branch of the Hibernian Australasian Catholic Benefit Society from the turn of the 20th century through to the 1970s.

The GNIS classifies it as a populated place; Stampede Pass is near to the west.  Name  The town was named Martin because of the nearby Martin Creek. The creek was originally named Pine-Marten Creek because an American marten was killed nearby.  History  Location sign for Martin Washington = Railroad =  Construction  Prior to the Stampede Tunnel, to reach the Puget Sound region from east of the Cascades, Northern Pacific Railroad trains had to pay for trackage rights on the Oregon Railway & Navigation Company tracks from Wallulla, Washington along the Columbia River to Portland. After that a car ferry across the Columbia returned trains to NP tracks north to Tacoma (1873) and eventually Seattle (1884). To avoid paying for trackage, NP decided a better path to the Puget Sound region was over the Cascades. NP engineers spent from 1873-1884 narrowing down the candidate passes for crossing the Cascades to three: Snoqualmie, Stampede, and Natchess . The NP railroad had left Lake Superior and arrived in Yakima in 1885. At risk of losing millions of acres of land grants for failure to build a direct line to the Puget Sound, NP put out bids to drill the Stampede Tunnel in just 28 months. They opened the bids on Jan 21, 1886 and the lowest bidder was Nelson Bennett at $837,250, nearly half the price of most bidders. They awarded him the contract on Jan 29th. On February 1st, the first wagonload of supplies left Yakima for the tunnel site. It took months to arrive as an army of men felled trees and built plank roads over which to haul the machines and supplies. Once the caravan arrived, they set up their sawmill and used the lumber to build bunkhouses, stables, a machine shop, warehouses, a hospital, a restaurant, a saloon, a steam plant, and the station house. The construction camp was called Tunnel City and from 1886 to 1888 it housed over 200 construction workers who were building switchbacks and drilling the tunnel. Up the hill towards the Stampede Pass summit, 1,000 Chinese laborers who were also working on the tunnel were encamped. In April 1886, under pressure from increasing OR&N; through rates, NP decided to also build a temporary switchback over Stampede Pass. The route left the main line at the Martin station and rejoined the main line at the west end of the tunnel. The switchback was completed June 1, 1887. Passenger service began a month later on July 3rd and Martin was station No. 1894. In the month of September, 1,900 cars were moved over the switchback line. During the winter months heavy snow up to 10' deep would cover the line. In July 1887 snowsheds were constructed along the line including at Martin. The snow sheds were built of 10\\"x12\\" posts and 10\\"x16\\" caps and covered with 4\\" planks. In January 1888, a pair of Leslie rotary steam snow shovels arrived to keep the switchback line cleared. On May 14, 1888 the tunnel bore was completed, just 7 days ahead of the contracts deadline. On May 28th the tunnel opened for traffic. The switchback route was used for a few tourist trains and then abandoned.  Decline  At the height of the steam era, NP employed operators 'round the clock at Martin. Martin was an important post in coordinating train movements through the single-track tunnel. Trains were authorized by the dispatcher and timetable. Over time, train engines switched to diesel and the number of men needed in Martin shrank. In 1921, Martin was at mile post 46.5 (0 was at Ellensburg) on the Seattle Main Line. In 1928, all that remained of Tunnel City was a station house labeled Martin and a few employee cottages. In 1947, Martin was station No. 7023 at milepost 82.5 on the Tacoma Main Line. In February 1949, Martin saw of snow fall the night of February 15th. The snow depth increased from to overnight. The crew of 124 men (100 more than usual) tasked with keeping the line open with two rotaries and a plow could not remember a worse time. In 1957 or 1958, NP installed a small CTC board at Easton to automate control traffic through the tunnel. In April of 1960, Northern Pacific Railway removed trains No. 5 and No. 6, discontinuing passenger service to Martin. In 1963 they automated the Martin station and in the summer of 1964 they demolished all their buildings at Martin. The railroad subsequently abandoned their telephone lines and telephone cabins.  Abandonment  After NP merged into Burlington Northern in 1970, BN had several parallel routes across the Cascades. The Stampede route was relegated to a secondary. In 1977 a storm swelled Stampede Creek and it washed out the railroad tracks. Trains did not run again until 1978. On August 13, 1983, BNSF Railway discontinued the 78-mile line through the Stampede Tunnel but did not abandon the right of way. In July 1988, vandals stealing the copper from power transmission lines dropped a line near the eastern portal of the tunnel at Martin and set the wooden structure ablaze. The fire was put out by volunteers but the tunnel and hundreds of feet of track were destroyed.  Restoration  In 1995 Burlington Northern purchased Sante Fe and became BNSF. In 1996 they announced plans to spend $125 million to restore the Stampede Pass route. Soon 500 workers fanned out to install 145,000 concrete ties, 158,000 wood ties, and 47 new miles of rail. A new concrete snowshed was constructed at the Martin portal of the tunnel and in December rail service once again passed through Martin. In 2019, BNSF added a signal tower at Martin that enables them to run double-length (230 cars) grain trains through the Stampede Tunnel. The longer trains have locomotives in the front, middle, and rear to prevent string-lining. = Amenities = A post office called Martin was established in 1892, and remained in operation until 1902. A fire lookout was located in Martin from at least 1934-1956. The lookout tower does not appear on the 1961 USGS map.  Access  The Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail crosses FS 54. Get off at FS 54 and head west. Follow FS 420 west to the end. = Winter = Access in the winter is from the Crystal Springs Sno-Park. Forest Service road 54 is split groomed for tracked snow machines on the north side and non-motorized (skiers, sled dogs, etc.) on the south side. = Summer = Vehicle access to Martin is via exit 62 off I-90. Take FS 54 to FS 420. Follow FS 420 road to the end.  Recreation  = Ski Touring = two skiers crossing a stream Starting in the early 1920s, skiers from Cle Elum and Puget Sound would ride the Northern Pacific Railroad to the Martin, Washington stop. The railroad supplied \\"cozy warm shelter\\" in a dozen specially equipped bunk-cars and meal cars on a side track at the Martin station. Skiers could stay overnight and the railroad provided heating stoves and free coal. = Meany Lodge = In 1928, The Mountaineers built the Meany Ski Hut on 54 acres of Tunnel City, a 5 minute walk from the Martin rail stop. The hut was subsequently expanded and still operates as Meany Lodge. = Martin Ski Dome = In 1939, the Northern Pacific Railway opened a ski area on the eastern portal of the Stampede Tunnel called Martin Ski Dome. It was located just across the railroad tracks from the Meany Ski Hut and closed in 1942 with the start of World War II. It was subsequently sold and operated as the Husky Chalet from 1944 thru the 1949 ski season. = Sno-Park = Overnight lot at Crystal Springs Sno-Park Snowmobiles in Crystal Springs Sno- Park The Crystal Springs Sno-Park is located just off Exit 62 on I-90. Managed by the Lake Easton State Park, it provides access to the snow sports trails around and through Martin. The Sno-Park has plowed parking lots for non- motorized (skiers, sled dogs) users, motorized (snowmobiles & other tracked vehicles) users, and overnight guests to Meany Lodge & Trollhaugen. = Erling Stordahl = The Erling Stordahl trailhead is just minutes away from the Crystal Springs Sno-Park. The flat easy trails are built and maintained in partnership by the Sons of Norway and the Ski for Light charity. They are specifically for the benefit of blind skiers but are open to all. = Trollhaugen = A few more minutes up the dual groomed (x-country on the South, snowmobile on the North) Stampede Pass road is the Cascade Sons of Norway lodge Trollhaugen. = John Wayne = Just over a half mile North of the Sno-Park, the Stampede Pass road crosses the Palouse to Cascades State Park Trail. Prior to 2018, the trail name was the John Wayne Pioneer Trail and was part of the Iron Horse State Park Trail. The trail is groomed in the winter and is well used by skiers. In the summer bikers, hikers, and horse riders use the trail. = Sled Dogs = About a mile up Stampede Pass road the non-motorized (skiers, sled dogs) trail follows Forest Road 420 on the left and motorized (snowmobile) traffic stays right. These x-country ski trails are groomed by a grooming machine named Hippo owned by the Mountaineers and operated by their volunteers. This area is also where the Northwest Sled Dog Association holds their annual Crystal Dog Challenge on the groomed trails that pass through the area. At the end of the 420 Road is the historic location of Martin and the Meany Lodge ski resort.

The company is known for its wireless learning camera technology that prevents false alarms. Butterfleye was founded in 2013 by an engineer named Ben Nader, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. On December 20, 2017, Butterfleye was acquired by Ooma.  History  After losing several bicycles in a series of break-ins at his apartment, Nader‚Äîthen an engineer at Texas Instruments‚Äîtried to install his own security alarm system. Dissatisfied with existing products that took him three days to install, Nader set out to create an alternative. Nader was initially funded by angel investing, raising $1.6 million. In August 2015, he sought backing through the crowdfunding site Indiegogo, setting a goal of $100,000. When the campaign finished in October, the company had raised more than six times its initial goal.  Cameras  Nader described Butterfleye as \\"Dropcam meets Nest,\\" a combination of streaming cameras and home automation technology. Butterfleye's cameras are wireless with an estimated two-week battery life, allowing them to continue functioning in case of power interruptions. Butterfleye's cameras are distinguished by their facial recognition technology, which prevents false alarms, and their ability to learn what not to record (for example, footage of the home's residents themselves). The camera also includes iBeacon technology, allowing it recognize certain smartphones, also avoiding false alarms; a thermal imaging sensor; and audio recognition technology, through which the camera can learn to recognize sounds such as children crying or glass breaking. The system sorts and labels archived footage on the basis of these audio and visual cues. Each camera uploads using AES 128bit encryption, and has 12 hours of internal storage in the event of wireless network or Internet connection failure. Owners can watch the camera feed live or archived through an app on Android (in development) or iOS, and can be notified through the app when a person or pet is detected by a given camera. Owners can also activate a camera remotely, in which case a light on the camera signals to those nearby that it is recording. The cameras also feature two-way audio that allows the owner to speak through the camera to communicate with family members or pets.

An ethnic Aromanian from the Macedonia region, he studied at Leipzig before teaching school at Thessaloniki. Following the creation of Greater Romania at the end of World War I, Capidan followed his friend Sextil Pu»ôcariu to the Transylvanian capital Cluj, where he spent nearly two decades, the most productive part of his career. He then taught in Bucharest for a further ten years and was marginalized late in life under the nascent communist regime. Capidan's major contributions involve studies of the Aromanians and the Megleno-Romanians, as well as their respective languages. His research extended to reciprocal influences between Romanian and the surrounding Slavic languages, the Eastern Romance substratum and the Balkan sprachbund, as well as toponymy. He made a significant contribution to projects for a Romanian-language dictionary and atlas. Biography =Origins and early career= He was born into an Aromanian family in Prilep, a town that formed part of the Ottoman Empire's Manastir Vilayet and is now in North Macedonia. His parents were the tailor Teohari Capidan and his wife Eugenia Vreta. After attending primary school in his native town, he followed his elder brother Pericle, a future painter, in emigrating to the Romanian Old Kingdom. Slated to become a Romanian Orthodox priest, he studied at the central seminary in Bucharest, but decided he had a different vocation and left in order to pursue a teaching career. Capidan returned to Macedonia, where he was hired at the Romanian high school in Bitola and displayed talent in teaching Romanian and German. With the help of the Romanian consul, he obtained a scholarship that allowed him to study Romance philology at Leipzig University from 1904 to 1908. His professors included Karl Brugmann, Gustav Weigand, August Leskien, Eduard Sievers and Wilhelm Wundt.Pop, p. 221 His thesis, awarded cum laude, dealt with Aromanian linguistics. While a student, Capidan published his first works on Aromanian dialectology and cultural history. After graduating and until 1909, he served as assistant at Weigand's Balkan Institute.Pop, p. 222 In 1907, he met and began a lifelong friendship with Sextil Pu»ôcariu, who, after putting him through a three-month trial period in Czernowitz, invited the student to help with his Romanian-language dictionary project.Tana»ôoca, p. 100Pop, pp. 221-22 In 1909, he was named Romanian language professor at the Romanian Higher School of Commerce in Thessaloniki. The following year, he became director of an institution he transformed into an exemplary place of learning, preparing not just economists but also students with an aptitude for science and literature. Capidan was at the school until 1919, and used this period for research. He gathered dialectal, linguistic and folkloric material for future studies, undertook fieldwork and also used as subjects his students, Aromanians and Megleno- Romanians who came from throughout the Balkan peninsula. He wrote studies of linguistics and ethnography, and collaborated on Pu»ôcariu's dictionary. In 1909, he penned a reply in French to those who questioned whether the Aromanian language is Romance in origin and character. Titled R√©ponse critique au Dictionnaire d'√©tymologie koutzovalaque de Constantin Nicola√Ødi, it features both an argument based on science and a satirical flourish. This paved the way for other polemical writings in which he Aromanians' Romance character.Tana»ôoca, p. 101 =Cluj years and move to Bucharest= During World War I, in common with the majority of Aromanian intellectuals in Macedonia, Capidan entered the Thessaloniki-headquartered Arm√©e d'Orient as a volunteer. After the war and the union of Transylvania with Romania, he was invited by Pu»ôcariu to help place the new Superior Dacia University in Cluj on a solid foundation. From 1919 to 1924, he was associate professor in the Romanian language and dialectology department, lecturing on Aromanian and Megleno- Romanian. From 1924 to 1937, he was full professor of sub-Danubian dialectology and general linguistics. The Cluj years were the most productive and happiest of his life. He was among the most important representatives within the school of linguistics that centered around Pu»ôcariu. He worked diligently at the Museum of the Romanian Language and was a consistent contributor to its journal, Dacoromania. He continued to provide input on the dictionary as well as on the Romanian Linguistic Atlas. His contribution to the dictionary involved an enormous sacrifice of time and energy; the work was exigent and tiresome. Pu»ôcariu recalled how his colleague, together with Constantin Lacea, would sit daily in front of files for three or four hours, more than once ripping apart an article on which they had worked for a week and restarting in a more logical fashion. Regarding the linguistic atlas, his assistance to Sever Pop involved material on the Aromanians and the Megleno- Romanians. The favorable intellectual climate in Cluj fostered his seminal works on the Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, establishing him as an authority in the field. Elected a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy in 1928, he was elevated to titular status in 1935. His maiden speech, on the Balkan Romance peoples, was followed by a warm welcome from Pu»ôcariu.Tana»ôoca, pp. 101-02 In 1937, Capidan was invited to the University of Bucharest, where he was made head of the comparative philology department heretofore led by the late Iuliu Valaori. He remained there until 1947, when he was obliged to retire. Extending his scientific interests into a wider field, he used his knowledge of linguistics and of the Balkan languages to emerge as a researcher with original views in the comparative study of the Indo-European languages. He also spurred development of the area among Romanian academics. He relaunched the Thracological studies of Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, employing more modern methods. He published a critical and historical study of Hasdeu, placing him in the context of the development of Romanian linguistics and philology and championing his merits as an Indo-Europeanist. For years, his laudatory view of Hasdeu retained a definitive status in regard to this sphere of his activity. Capidan held a special course on Thraco-Phrygian, later turning the material into a study on guttural occlusives in Thracian. He also published a series of etymological notes on the extinct language in the bulletin of the Academy's literary section, which he co-edited with his friend Dumitru Caracostea. He collaborated closely with Victor Papacostea at the latter's Institute of Balkan Studies, and in editing Balcania magazine.Tana»ôoca, pp. 102-03 Together with Papacostea and George Murnu, he published Revista macedo-rom√¢nƒÉ. In 1948, the new communist regime stripped him of Academy membership after Capidan refused to sign an adulatory telegram for Joseph Stalin. However, upon the intervention of Iorgu Iordan, he was allowed to continue working on the dictionary as an outside collaborator with the Linguistics Institute. Still involved with the project until his last months, when weakening vision forced him to abandon it, he died in 1953. In accordance with his wishes, was cremated in a simple ceremony.Tana»ôoca, p. 103 Capidan was married to Iulia George Dan, a housewife. The couple's only child, Emil, was born in 1912 and studied literature and philosophy at Cluj.NastasƒÉ, p. 187, 302, 492 Work =Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian language and society= Capidan's research interests focused on the realities of the sub- Danubian Romance peoples, the Aromanians and the Megleno-Romanians. He published numerous articles and studies on the subject, culminating in two valuable monographs that have been called classics of the field.Pop, pp. 222-23 His writing on linguistics combines a rich linguistic analysis with geographic, historical and socio-cultural facts about the peoples he studied, looking at their lifestyle and ethnographic profile.Pop, p. 223 He helped resolve the controversy over where their ethnogenesis took place. By looking at certain linguistic peculiarities, he concluded that the proto-Romanian language was divided into two zones. One was the northern, which developed into Daco-Romanian (from which Istro-Romanian later split); and the southern, which subsequently became differentiated into Aromanian and Megleno- Romanian.Pop, pp. 223-24 At the same time, he defended the notion of Megleno- Romanian as a separate dialect, noting the existence of nearly forty fundamental differences with Aromanian.Pop, p. 224 Employing findings drawn from fieldwork, Capidan made observations about the bilingualism or even multilingualism of the sub-Danubian Romance peoples, and was the first Romanian scholar to study this phenomenon systematically. He classified bilingualism into two types: natural or unconscious, and deliberate or scholarly. He discussed the causes, evolution and implications of bilingualism, discovering evidence of linguistic interference, the first step toward the dialects' convergence and ultimate disappearance.Pop, p. 227 =Balkan language theories= Fluent not only in these two Romance languages, but also in Bulgarian, Greek, Albanian and Turkish, he studied the relationship between Romanian and the Balkan languages. Within this context, he addressed the issue of the Eastern Romance substratum. Initially, he believed that only a small part of the common features displayed by Romanian and Albanian were due to a shared native element, attributing the great majority of links to a reciprocal influence. He later radically changed position, asserting that these commonalities were mainly due to a joint pre- Roman lineage. Capidan argued that the substrate's influence was visible not only at the lexical level, but also in phonetics and morphology. He noted that a part of the substrate elements extant in Daco-Romanian are absent south of the Danube. Capidan studied various issues relating to linguistic and cultural ties between Romanians and Slavs. He argued that Old Slavic influence on Romanian began at some point in the 8th or 9th century, and that most of this influence came from Bulgarian, while a part was Serbian. Analyzing the common Slavic lexicon of Daco-Romanian, Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian, he found 72 such terms. However, he noted that the latter two languages may have absorbed a part of these from Albanian or Greek at a later date, after splitting off from proto-Romanian.Pop, pp. 224-25 At the same time, Capidan was the first linguist who undertook a systematic study of Romanian's influence on the South Slavic languages. Although his comments on Serbian were limited to a few observations, he wrote an ample study with regard to Bulgarian.Pop, pp. 225-26 Although his original contributions regarding the Balkan sprachbund were few, he and Pu»ôcariu were among those who laid the foundation for strictly scientific research into cultural and linguistic relations among the Balkan peoples. Capidan believed that the region's languages shared certain words pertaining to a common civilization, remarkably similar in their semantic evolution, as well as common traits in phraseology and proverbs. However, he thought that their morphological construction was more divergent. Thus, while initially embracing the sprachbund idea, he eventually came to reject the idea of a linguistic union comparable to the Romance or Germanic languages, as well as an approach that studied the Balkan languages as being related.Pop, p. 226 =Toponymy= Capidan was interested in toponymy, particularly south of the Danube. During his Leipzig days, he delivered a report on the Slavic place names of Thessaly and Epirus. Over the years, he offered etymological explanations for a large number of place names. He used several of these to argue for the idea that certain Aromanians were native to Greece, basing the theory on their phonetic transformations found only in the Latin elements of Romanian. Other names helped determine their inhabitants' occupation, leading him to conclude that the Megleno-Romanians' involvement with sheepherding was as extensive as their agricultural work.Pop, pp. 227-28 In his later years, Capidan published the first book on Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian toponymy, as well as a Romanian toponymic dictionary. The latter work included an important finding on rural Geto-Dacian toponymy: that place names, usually four-syllabled, were composed of a variable determinant and an invariable determined element. The invariable portion was -dava in Geto-Dacian and -para in Thracian south of the Danube. Capidan was the first to attempt to explain why the two differed, somewhat anomalously since the Geto-Dacians and the Thracians spoke the same language. He proposed that the difference lay in the physical characteristics of the land occupied by the two groups. Drawing on Indo-European roots, he indicated that the suffix -para suggests a ford, crossing or path, and is suitable to Thracian settlements, typically found in valleys, along roads and paths.Pop, p. 229 On the other hand, -dava refers to settlements or villages. This arose out of the Geto-Dacians' main occupation as farmers, their villages scattered among fields. Capidan asserted that they felt the need to name these placed with a term meaning, simply, \\"settlement\\".Pop, pp. 228-29 Notes References * Lucian NastasƒÉ, Intimitatea amfiteatrelor.

Her other television credits included a multi-episode recurring role as Judge Susan Aandahl on NBC's Homicide: Life on the Street during the 1990s, as well as the television films Cocaine: One Man's Seduction (1983) and Full Ride. Lewis was born in Omaha, Nebraska and raised in Council Bluffs, Iowa. She received her Master of Fine Arts from the graduate acting program at the University of California, San Diego. Lewis began acting professionally during the late 1970s. She met her future husband, television producer and screenwriter Tom Fontana, in 1978 while auditioning at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts. Fontana was working as an assistant to the theatre festival's artistic director at the time of their meeting. In 1980, Lewis moved to Los Angeles when Fontana became a writer on the NBC drama, St. Elsewhere. She was soon co-starring on St. Elsewhere, when the showrunner, Bruce Paltrow, created the role of Dr. Jacqueline Wade specifically for her. She appeared in several television films throughout the 1980s, including Cocaine: One Man's Seduction (1983), which starred Dennis Weaver, Dan Aykroyd and Jeffrey Tambor. Lewis also appeared in the final half hour of the series finale of M*A*S*H, Goodbye, Farewell and Amen, in 1983. Lewis was cast in a multi-episode recurring role as Judge Susan Aandahl on Homicide: Life on the Street from 1995 to 1999.

Following the divorce, Lewis moved to Maui and then to Sedona, Arizona, where she taught at the Zaki Gordon Institute of Independent Film (now known as the Sedona Film School) and served as the program director of the Sedona International Film Festival for seven years. She also gave birth to her son, Jade Scott Lewis, about three years after her divorce. However, Lewis and Fontana later reconnected when her son went to graduate school in New York. Fontana proposed to her over the Christmas holiday in 2014. They remarried in July 2015 and remained together until her death from cancer in 2016. In an interview with the New York Times, published in the article \\"You Married Them Once, but What About Twice?\\" in March 2016, Lewis talked about her divorce and remarriage to Fontana, explaining, \\"I was sad when we split up. It was hard for both of us but we knew it was necessary. He understood that I needed to explore other worlds.\\" They held wedding parties in Tribeca (New York City), Los Angeles, Omaha (her hometown), and Buffalo, New York (Fontana's hometown). Lewis and Fontana wrote on their invitations, \\"After 22 years, the divorce didn't work out.\\" After a six-year battle with cancer, Lewis died at her home in Manhattan on August 7, 2016, at the age of 63.

Background  After attending a women's comedy festival in Sydney Kate JasonSmith founded Hens' Teeth in time to debut just before Christmas in 1988.Elliott, Matt. Kiwi Jokers: The Rise and Rise of New Zealand Comedy. Auckland: HarperCollins, 1997. . P109. It was a success breaking box-office records for Wellington's Circa Theatre. The company's name comes from the saying 'as rare as hens teeth' pointing to the scarcity of female comedians working professionally in New Zealand. Between 1988 and 2001 Kate JasonSmith produced regular performances of Hens Teeth mostly in Wellington featuring over 100 women. Performers included: Ginette McDonald, Rima te Wiata, Emily Perkins, Cathy Sheat, Michelle Scullion, Ann Pacey, Riwia Brown, Ann Jones, Alison Wall, Pam Corkery, Perry Piercy, Nancy Fulford, Stephanie Creed, Vicki Walker, Donna Akersten, Jane Waddell, TV personality Chloe (Chloe Perovic), and Phylli JasonSmith. The core cast included Lee Hatherly, Dame Kate Harcourt, Lorae Parry, Pinky Agnew, Helen Moulder, Carmel McGlone, Sue Dunlop, Sally Rodwell, Madeline McNamara, Rose Beauchamp, Prue Langbein, Bub Bridger, April Phillips, and Darien Takle.  Performance history and format  Each show was held together by a compere or M.C., with the most famous being \\"Mother Chook\\" (Lee Hatherly; full name, Leone Rosemary Lucille Hatherly). The usual format involved a comic line-up that changed nightly, with some regulars and some \\"tryouts.\\" It has been described as \\"a variety show consisting of a series of comedy sketches\\"\\"Flights of Imagination.\\" Regional News (Wellington, New Zealand); issue 70 (12 December 2018), p3. connected with the comediennes' identity as women. Hens' Teeth's success has been attributed to its focus on things that are part of the fabric of most women's lives: sex, politics, aging, cooking, ambition, breastfeeding, men, opera, housework, dieting, childcare, self- defense, love, money, contraception and creativity. The company's only major rule was that the performers' jokes should not come at the expense of men or other minorities. The second season was called Hen's Teeth: The Second Bite at Taki Rua The Depot Theatre (Wellington) early in 1989 and had similar success to the first season. In March 1990 Hens' Teeth was included in the biennial New Zealand International Festival of the Arts with the title Daughter of Hen's Teeth with design by Debra Bustin and choreography by Jamie Bull; the performances were in the Illott Concert Chamber of the Wellington Town Hall; music was by Michelle Scullion and performers included Sandra McKay, Madeline McNamara, Helen Moulder, Lorae Parry, and Sally Rodwell. The September 1991 Circa Theatre season, Hens‚Äô Teeth squawk this way: a season of women comedians included Lee Hatherly, Rose Beauchamp, Bub Bridger, Sue Dunlop, Madeline McNamara, Prue Langbein, Helen Moulder, Lorae Parry, and Dame Kate Harcourt. A group of performers may also have appeared on the night including Beryl Te Wiata, Sally Rodwell, Jane Waddell, and more. The March 1996 Circa Theatre season, Hen's Teeth: Raw eggs and old boilers, featured Lee Hatherly, with Rose Beauchamp, Bub Bridger, Kate Harcourt, Lorae Parry, Madeline McNamara, Lindy Hatherly (Lee Hatherly's daughter, performing a fire-eating act), Sally Rodwell, Prue Langbein, Sue Dunlop, Marg Layton, Cathie Sheat, Pinky Agnew, April Mardle, Carmel McGlone, Ann Pacey, and Dorothy McKegg. The group was largely dormant from 2001 until 2017 when it returned to Circa Theatre as part of WTF! (Women's Theatre Festival), which ran between 14‚Äì25 March that year. The company toured throughout New Zealand. In 1995 they made a Creative NZ- sponsored tour of South Island towns - 19 venues in 23 days. In 1992 they performed at the Adelaide Fringe Festival in Australia.Fringe Vault: fringevault.com.au/mini_sites/events/1992?page=3&sort;=ASC, accessdate: August 17, 2016 Significance in New Zealand culture Hens' Teeth began as a reaction to the absence of professional opportunities for women in entertainment in New Zealand. Its legacy continues in on-going work by former members of the company. The problem it addressed has remained a topic of discussion and research for New Zealand women. Marian Evans completed a PhD on women's involvement in film production in New Zealand at Victoria University. Producer Kate JasonSmith undertook similar research (supported by the New Horizons for Women Trust), on proportion of women's roles on New Zealand stage and screen as part of an honours degree program in 2002 at Victoria University of Wellington. Circa Theatre in Wellington has been running a Women's Theatre Festival (WTF!) that uses some of this research. Many of the women in Hens Teeth were recognizable figures before joining Hens' Teeth; for others, Hens' Teeth provided an opportunity to launch or develop their careers. Some examples of work that has come out of Hens Teeth includes The Legend Returns by Helen Moulder and Rose Beauchamp. This is a show based on characters and skits developed in Hens Teeth. The Legend Returns has toured extensively around NZ and also San Francisco. Moulder's part in the duo is an \\"aging diva\\" called Cynthia Fortitude; Beauchamp is Gertie, the long-suffering, generally mute, but piano-playing sidekick. In 2018 the pair developed a sequel to The Legend Returns, called Cynthia and Gertie Go Baroque. The Legend Returns is a popular audio available in the Radio New Zealand collection. Sally Rodwell published a book of monologues based on characters developed partly in Hens Teeth titled Gonne Strange Charity. Sally Rodwell and Madeline McNamara used Hens Teeth to explore characters of 'The Nobodies' which ended up being a show Crow Station that premiered in Wellington and then performed at the Magdalena Project women's festival in Cardiff in 1994. Rodwell and McNamara went on to form Magdalena Aotearoa, a New Zealand network of women performers. Also produced after Hens Teeth had paved the way was a women's performance cabaret Not Broadcast Quality, with a wider programme than comedy including for example dance, music, theatre and mask and Women Off The Planet a women's music cabaret both ran for more than one year in the 1990s and both at Taki Rua The Depot Theatre. Producer Kate JasonSmith wrote and performed in a solo show called I‚Äôll Tell You This for Nothing - My Mother the War Hero, that premiered at BATS Theatre in Wellington and then performed at the Edinburgh Festival in 2019.

He ruled the Sapadalaksha country in present-day Rajasthan. Ignoring Chahamana, the mythical founder of the dynasty, Vasudeva is the earliest known ruler of the dynasty. According to the Prabandha-Kosha of the 14th century Jain scholar Rajashekhara Suri, Vasudeva ascended the throne in 551 CE (608 Vikram Samvat). The historical accuracy of this statement is not certain. A mythical account in Prithviraja Vijaya states that Vasudeva received the Sambhar Salt Lake as a gift from a vidyadhara (a supernatural being). According to this legend, Vasudeva once found a vidyadhara sleeping in the royal bed. A magic pill which gave the vidyadhara the power to fly had fallen from his mouth. Vasudeva handed over this magic pill to the vidyadhara. The grateful vidyadhara introduced himself as the son of Shakambhara. He told Vasudeva that the goddess Parvati, pleased with Shakambhara's devotion, had been residing in the local forest under the name \\"Shakambhari\\". The vidyadhara decided to return the favour to Vasudeva. He asked the king to put his sword in the ground at sunset, and ride a horse back to his capital without looking back. The king did as told, and waves of water followed him. The resulting body of water became the salt lake of Sambhar. The vidyadhara appeared before the king, and told him that the lake would remain in the possession of his descendants. The Bijolia inscription of his descendant Someshvara states that the lake was born of Vasudeva. The next known Chahamana king is Samantaraja, whose relationship to Vasudeva is not clear from the available historical records.

In 1884, she debuted at the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires, next to Francesco Tamagno. At this time, her career focused on the soprano repertoire. In Europe, she performed in major Italian theaters, we well as in Lisbon, Madrid and London. She was equally comfortable in dramatic or lyrical roles, mezzo-soprano or contralto, thanks to the exceptional extension of her voice. Her stage presence was characterized by a passionate and dramatic temperament. In 1909, she founded a singing academy in Buenos Aires, while also teaching in Brazil.

Xie Hongjun would move into coaching with the Beijing Youth Team while Xie Feng would progress through the organisation into the senior team by 1988. Initially when Xie Feng started his career at Beijing FC (later renamed Beijing Guoan), he was a striker whose his ability to run 100 metres in 11 seconds was considered a great asset. His speed would be highlighted when he scored against both A.C. Milan and Arsenal in friendlies for Beijing Guoan in 1994 and 1995 respectively. Xie would be converted to a right-back by head coach Jin Zhiyang to accommodate the striker Gao Hongbo. The move would be a huge success for Xie and he would go on to win the 1996 and 1997 Chinese FA Cup with the club. After spending his whole career in Beijing, Xie joined another top tier club in Shenzhen Pingan where he remained until at the end of the 2001 league season where he spent the whole campaign recovering from injury before deciding to retire from playing and take the advice of the club's Head Zhu Guanghu and move into coaching.

It was built from to 1923. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This single storeyed timber homestead was built for Stephen Spencer, a squatter from New South Wales who arrived in Queensland in 1857. The Mount Abundance run was taken up in 1847 by Allan MacPherson, a young squatter from New South Wales. MacPherson had come to Queensland seeking new pastures, and had followed the route of Sir Thomas Mitchell into the Mount Abundance area. Mitchell had named Mount Abundance in 1846 during his expedition to find a route from New South Wales to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Following constant conflicts with local Aboriginies, MacPherson decided Mount Abundance was a dangerous place and in late 1849, MacPherson withdrew his sheep from Mount Abundance, leaving it as a cattle station, and returned to England. In 1856 MacPherson briefly visited Australia at which time he disposed of his pastoral interests, including the sale of Mount Abundance to Stephen Spencer. Spencer and his family are considered to have been the first European family to settle in the area. It is recorded that when they arrived at the station, it was found to be run down, and the buildings damaged by fire. Rough huts provided temporary quarters until Spencer built a new homestead, and Mount Abundance station is described as the focal point for the district during this period. Spencer ran a supply store, and the station formed a depot for European explorers heading into the western districts. A post office was opened at the homestead in September 1861. Augustus Charles Gregory arrived at Mount Abundance in 1862, and selected a locality for the township which become known as Roma, proclaimed in September that year. The post office at Mount Abundance homestead closed at the end of 1863 when the Roma post office opened. A stone causeway over Bungeworgorai Creek is believed to be contemporary with the development of Mount Abundance; however little is known about the stonework. The Spencers are recorded as being interested in agriculture and horticulture, growing the first wheat in the district, and experimenting with grape vines, fig, peach and apricot trees. By late 1868, Spencer was heavily in debt and in 1869 the Government auctioned the freehold of of land on which the Homestead and other associated buildings of Mount Abundance Station were erected. The land was purchased by Robert Morehead and Matthew Young of Sydney, who represented the Scottish Australian Investment Company. The stock was auctioned early in 1870, and was also bought by Morehead and Young. The Scottish Australian Investment Company was active in investing in pastoral property in Queensland between 1860-1890. The Company had been founded in Scotland, encouraged by reports from Scottish settlers in Australia, and was established with two main purposes: acquisition of land largely for grazing and agricultural pursuits; and granting loans or advances on property mortgages. Despite this two-fold purpose, in its first twenty years in Australia it was primarily a loan and mortgage company. During the early 1860s through the persistence of Robert Morehead as its Australian manager, the Company entered into pastoral activity and acquired property in Central/Western Queensland (Bowen Downs) and in the Gulf Country. During the 1860s, the Company made a number of loans to Queensland graziers, including Mount Abundance. An article in 1875 recounted that when the Company took possession of Mount Abundance, the \\"improvements\\" consisted of only a wretched homestead, and suggested that Spencer was contented to live in his bark- covered buildings till they were old, and dilapidated. It is possible therefore, although not actually stated in the same article, that the Company may have erected a new homestead on the property in the late 1860s. By the mid 1870s, Mount Abundance station was described as one of the largest establishments in the Maranoa and considered to be one of the best grazing properties in Western Queensland. The Head Station comprised a Homestead (occupied by the Manager), sub-Manager's residence, office, store, residences for the storekeeper and bookkeeper, men's quarters, workshops, two large receiving stores and of garden. Stock returns for 1875 indicate that Mount Abundance was run in conjunction with Nive Downs, a property north of Charleville which had also been acquired by the Company. The woolshed to the southwest of the homestead was reputed to be one of the largest in Queensland in the early 1880s. Photographic evidence indicates that the shingle roof of the homestead was clad with iron between 1890 and 1895. Mount Abundance station was resumed by the Queensland Government in 1923, being regarded as offering the best prospect for successful closer settlement. The main purpose of the resumption was the subdivision of land for the combined raising of wheat and sheep, and to extend agricultural settlement into the western districts. The land was made available for selection in 1927, and the Mount Abundance Homestead block comprising was selected by Ernest Martyn. Following the death of E Martyn, the property passed to his son PJ Martyn, who died in 1993. The property was further subdivided in the late 1970s, and presently comprises an area of just under . Of the former complex of buildings, only the homestead and quarters to the rear of the building are extant.  Description  Homestead and grounds, circa 1895 Mount Abundance Homestead, consisting of house and attached quarters, is located approximately west of Roma and south of the main road to Charleville. It is sited on high ground on the southern bank of Bungeworgorai Creek. The approach is via a stone causeway which crosses the creek. The main house is a single storey structure of three main rooms facing north with a wide verandah on three sides and services rooms on the south side. Part of the verandah has been closed in creating additional rooms. The north side and the portion of the west side which remain open feature a decorative timber valance. The main roof is a moderately pitched hip which reduces in pitch at the verandah line. The foundations are a system of load bearing bed logs that support floor joists and tongue and groove timber floors. Damage to the foundations has caused the western end of the house to subside. The wall construction is a timber frame with chamferboards to the external walls. The interior walls and ceilings are constructed from tongue and grooved boards which are finished in a dark stained varnish. Two of the main rooms have masonry fireplaces with brick and stone chimneys. Six sets of French doors open out from the main rooms onto the north side verandah. One of these has been altered to create a window. The roof is clad in corrugated galvanised iron laid over the original timber shingle roof and cantilevered beyond the earlier roof line. The cantilever section is supported by decorative brackets off the timber verandah posts. The main house connects via a covered way to a single storeyed structure set on low timber stumps which housed quarters and a kitchen. Located to the south of the house, this building has exposed timber frame construction, timber cladding and a steep corrugated galvanised iron gabled roof with skillion additions. Little remains of the original fencing but original steps and mounting stones can be seen. Forming the front entrance to the homestead are the original stone gate posts and iron gates. This entrance, which has been relocated, is flanked by large bottle trees.  Heritage listing  Mount Abundance Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Mount Abundance Homestead provides rare surviving evidence of the pastoral development of western Queensland from the 1850s. The resumption of Mount Abundance during the 1920s, and the subsequent division into smaller farming properties and re-settlement during the 1930s, is important in demonstrating the pattern of land use and occupancy in rural Queensland during the early 20th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Mount Abundance Homestead provides rare surviving evidence of the pastoral development of western Queensland from the 1850s. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The place has the potential to provide archaeological evidence of building construction techniques from the mid-19th century and of the formerly extensive pastoral station complex, of which only the homestead and attached quarters are known to be extant. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Scottish Australian Investment Company, which played an important role in the development of the pastoral industry in Queensland during the latter part of the 19th century, established the reputation of Mount Abundance as a fine grazing property and the association of this company with the property is of importance.

A. Bisson (New York City, 1900‚Äì1979) was an American political writer, journalist, and government official who specialized in East Asian politics and economics. In the 1920s and 1930s, he worked for the Foreign Policy Association and the Institute for Pacific Relations and wrote sympathetically about the Communist Party of China. He served in the American government during World War II and then was an officer in the Occupation of Japan. He taught at University of California, Berkeley in the early 1950s but was let go after he came under criticism for his support of the Chinese communists and because of accusations that he had been a wartime spy for the Soviet Union. In the 1930s and the 1940s, Bisson wrote prolifically on China, Japan, India, Mongolia, international relations, politics, and economics for the American public in a series of books and pamphlets for the Foreign Policy Association. His most prominent book is Zaibatsu Dissolution in Japan (University of California Press, 1954). Education and early career Bisson graduated from Rutgers University in 1923, then went as a Presbyterian missionary to teach English and Classics in Anhui province, China, and then taught at Yenching University in Beijing. He studied the Chinese language and developed a sympathy for the anti-imperalist program of the Chinese Nationalist Party, but was disheartened when Chiang Kai-shek gained control and crushed the left wing, including communists. Bisson left China in 1928 to enroll at Columbia University. He left Columbia before he could finish the doctoral program, however, to work for the Foreign Policy Association, which had been founded in 1918 to inform the American public about world affairs. He later explained that at that time he had a wife and two children: \\"I went into politics to make a living.\\" Between 1934 and 1937, Bisson, under the pseudonym \\"Frederick Spencer,\\" wrote dozens of articles supporting the communists in China in China Today, a magazine edited by Philip Jaffe, a left-wing businessman and frequent collaborator with the American Communist Party. Financed by the FPA and the Rockefeller Foundation, he traveled in China, including a 1937 automobile trip that he and several friends, including Owen Lattimore and Philip Jaffe, made from Beijing to Yan'an to interview Mao Zedong and other Communist Party leaders. His book Japan in China (1938) was a detailed account of the recent Japanese invasion, based on his own extensive travels in China. Although it drew on his trip, Bisson did not publish his detailed account of the Yan'an visit until 1973, immediately after US President Richard Nixon went to China. That book, Yenan in June 1937: Talks with the Communist Leaders, is his journal of a harrowing journey, complete with photographs of the communist leaders and the travelers' canvas-topped touring car being towed out of mud by oxen and by local villagers.Many of the photos are available online at T.A. Bisson Digital Commons, University of Maine World War II Bisson was recruited into government service in 1942, within a few weeks after Pearl Harbor. His assignment was the Board of Economic Warfare, charged with advising the government on how the mobilization and redirecting of economic resources could affect the war effort throughout the globe. The Board, chaired by Vice President Henry Wallace, competed for influence with other executive offices and was criticized as a refuge for left-wingers. Bisson worked on plans to disrupt the flow of war supplies to Japan, which called on the knowledge of East Asian economics that he had built up in his research at the Foreign Policy Association. In April 1943, Bisson was one of the officials called to testify before US Representative Martin Dies's committee. Then, Bisson's positive assessments of the Chinese Communists came under fire. Bisson defended himself, saying that the US army leaders now also saw the need for Soviet support against fascism and that he had come to Washington, DC, at a financial sacrifice because he was a \\"loyal American citizen.\\" The Board of Economic Welfare became controversial even within the Democratic Party, and Bisson left to become Research Associate of the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR) in New York and Associate Editor of its journal, Pacific Affairs. During his two years at IPR, Bisson published articles, book reviews, editorials, and books that criticized American policies and argued that they held back the hopes of Asian peoples for self-determination and that their claims were legitimate but had been thwarted by domestic militarists and western imperialists. His 1943 article in Far Eastern Survey attacked the Chinese Nationslists in China as \\"feudal\\" and asserted that the Communists were more effective. He wrote that the Communists were practicing something like \\"bourgeois democracy\\" in an agrarian setting and that it was \\"by no stretch of the imagination\\" that they could be regarded as genuine communists. T. A. Bisson, \\"China's Part in a Coalition War,\\" Far Eastern Survey (July 14, 1943). He revised American's Far Eastern Policy, a survey that he published at IPR in 1940.T. A. Bisson, America's Far Eastern Policy (New York, 1945). Occupation of Japan At the end of the war, policy circles debated what course the United States should pursue in the Occupation of Japan. The historian Howard Schonberger wrote that Bisson \\"recognized that the war had shattered the hold of the old order, fanned revolutionary fires, and left the United States alone as the dominant outside power in the region.\\" Bisson strongly opposed the group in the State Department known as the \\"Japan Crowd,\\" led by a former ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew. It urged the occupation to purge right-wing elements that had been responsible for the war but to allow the Emperor to remain on the throne to lead democratic forces, which would shorten the length of the occupation to be short. Grew's view assumed that militarists and extremists had derailed a viable Japanese democracy but that it could be put back on track after the war. Bisson drew on the arguments of his friend E.H. Norman, who had written that on the contrary, Japanese authoritarian rule and imperialist expansion had started with the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Bisson opposed keeping the emperor on the throne, unlike Grew, who thought that the emperor would maintain stability. Bisson and his friends proposed to eradicate the zaibatsu, the conglomerates that had dominated the economy and supported military rule. Instead, he argued in Pacific Affairs that the new leadership must include men and women who had led unions and farm organizations that had opposed the government; most of them had been imprisoned in 1941. After two years with IPR, Bisson moved back into government service and served from October 1945 to April 1947 in the occupation of Japan, which was led by General Douglas MacArthur. Bisson was first a member of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey and then an economic analyst for General Headquarters's Government Section. He was part of the teams working on the dissolution of the zaibatsu, passing the new Japanese Constitution, and enforcing the economic stabilization plan. He came to believe that the leaders of the postear Japanese governments were reactionaries who opposed both the democratic features of the constitution and the dissolution of the zaibatsu. Those beliefs brought him in conflict with MacArthur and Major General Charles A. Willoughby, the head of MacArthur's security investigation, who charged that Bisson had been part of the \\"leftist infiltration\\" of the occupation. Later life With backing from his associates at IPR, he received an appointment in Political Science at the University of California at Berkeley in 1948. However, because Bisson had never completed his doctorate, his faculty appointment was temporary, subject to periodic review. He soon came under attack from Republican politicians inside and outside California for his sympathy for the Chinese Communists. Bisson was called to testify in 1952 before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Patrick McCarran, who had investigated the Foreign Service officers known as the China Hands. Bisson used his experience in Japan for another book published by IPR, Prospects for Democracy in JapanT. A. Bisson, Prospects for Democracy in Japan (New York, 1949) and for the major work of his Berkeley years, Zaibatsu Dissolution in Japan.T. A. Bisson, Zaibatsu Dissolution in Japan (Berkeley, 1954). The review in American Political Science Review praised Bisson's ability to tell a technical story clearly and said the book was a \\"thorough piece of research based on English language sources.\\" However, the review continued that Bisson \\"enters a controversial field\\" when he argues that the zaibatsu should be nationalized. The review noted that the Bisson gave both the advantages and disadvantages of nationalization. However, objected to Bisson's argument that nationalization would be successful since it was based on Japanese collectivistic social patterns, as shown in the success of the railroad and communications systems, which had been nationalized for many years. Bisson remained at Berkeley through 1953-1954, but his appointment was not renewed, perhaps because the administration was defending only tenured faculty from political attack. He finally found employment at Western College for Women, a religious college in Oxford, Ohio, and he \\"never again,\\" in the words of historian Howard Schonberger, \\"had the time or the facilities for further major research.\\" Bisson spoke out politically from time to time and was an adamant opponent of the Vietnam War.T. A. Bisson, \\"Why the United States Should Not Be in Vietnam,\\" Public Affairs Pamphlet No. 391 (New York, 1966), 15-30. He then moved to Renison University College, the affiliated college of University of Waterloo that emphasises social and global engagement, where he taught from 1970 to 1973.Renison University College Bisson died in 1979. Espionage allegations The Venona Transcripts were a set of intercepts of Soviet communications made by American government intelligence services during World War II. The translated transcripts include a report to Soviet intelligence that Bisson shared four documents with Asia specialists at IPR, including Joseph Bernstein, who was an agent of the Soviet Union.\\"GRU Agent Bernstein Is Recruiting T. A. Bisson\\" To The Director (16 June 1943) Internet Archive The documents came from the Board of Economic Warfare. The scholar M. Stanton Evans, in his book Blacklisted by History: The Untold Story of Senator Joe McCarthy and His Fight against America's Enemies, cites Venona documents reading that a \\"Soviet espionage agent has established friendly relations with T.A. Bisson\\" and concluded that Bisson \\"not only touted the cause of the Red Chinese\\" but \\"passed confidential official data to a Soviet intelligence agent.\\" The historians John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr go farther. They conclude from the fact that Soviet intelligence mentioned Bisson by name and gave him the code name \\"Arthur\\" that he was a \\"spy.\\" John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, In Denial: Historians, Communism, and Espionage (New York, 2005), 108.

Construction and commissioning LST-21 was laid down on 25 September 1942, at Wilmington, Delaware, by the Dravo Corporation. She was launched on 18 February 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Lillian M. Lloyd; and commissioned on 14 April 1943, Lieutenant Charles M. Brookfiled, USCGR, in command. Service history During the war, LST-21 was manned by the United States Coast Guard. She served primarily in the Europe-Africa-Middle East Theater from August 1943 until January 1946, but also transported British forces from Calcutta, India and landed them as Regu Beach, Burma. =1943 convoy duty= On 27 July 1943, LST-21 set sail from Little Creek, Virginia, for foreign waters. On the evening of 13 August 1943, the ship passed through Gibraltar and early in the afternoon of 14 August 1943, landed in Oran, Algeria. The trip was made without incident although there were three general quarters during the passage: (1) Once when destroyers were seen dropping charges and lighted buoys to mark the point of contact; (2) when another escort dropped charges; and (3) when an escort fired her cannon.Personal Log of LTJG F.X.

Forming Convoy MKS 38G she rendezvoued with Convoy SL 147 and sailed for Liverpool on 2 February, arriving on 13 February 1944. On 28 January 1944, LST-21 got underway from Bizerte to join a convoy leaving the Mediterranean for England. They were noted to have air coverage as a protection against glider bombs. On January 31, an oceangoing tug out of Oran came alongside each ship in the group to deliver charts for the approaches to Plymouth, England, as they had left Bizerte without such charts. Later that day, LST-21 learned that its ultimate destination had been changed to Milford Haven, Wales.Personal Log of LTJG F.X. Moffitt On 1 February 1944, LST-21 sailed past Alboran Island and at 18:30 passed through the Straits of Gibraltar. The convoy continued heading west until they were over off the coast of Spain and then headed north. They sailed without incident until 5 February, when, at 09:30, one of the destroyer escorts let go with a white flare and started screening the starboard side of the convoy with a smokescreen. At 12:22, they sighted an unidentified aircraft dead ahead and high. An escort ahead opened fire and it soon disappeared into the clouds. The convoy presumed they were spotted.Personal Log of LTJG F.X. Moffitt On 7 February 1944, at 08:25, an escort off of the starboard beam hoisted the black pennant and dropped a depth charge. At 09:00, two British aircraft carriers and seven sloops as escorts rendezvoused with the convoy. At 12:55, an escort ahead indicated an underwater contact and, at 13:02, dropped five depth charges in quick succession. LST-21 went to General Quarters but the escort later gave up the search. At 13:23, an escort astern indicated contact but continued with the convoy after a brief delay. At 15;10 another escort on the starboard bow made a contact and ran alongside the starboard side of the convoy and, at 15:13 dropped one depth charge. Another escort joined the search, but a few minutes later they gave up the search and took station with the convoy. It was determined that they had run into a \\"wolf pack\\".Personal Log of LTJG F.X. Moffitt At daybreak on 8 February 1944, planes from the escort carriers were covering the convoy. At 13:00, the convoy changed course and started the last leg of the route toward the British Isles. At 19:30, fog set in and all ships were out of sight of LST-21 which turned on navigation lights and sounded whistle to avoid collision. At 8:45, the fog lifted and at 24:00 the convoy executed an emergency turn to starboard. On 9 February, at 00:35, the convoy resumed it course. At 01:13, they received a radio message that a submarine, , was sunk off the port side of the convoy. At 08:11, the convoy executed an emergency turn of 45 degrees to port, and at 08:40 resumed course. At 10:10, an escort on the starboard bow indicated a contact. LST-21s radioman tuned into an extra receiver on the escorts' and the planes' frequency and the officers and crew in LST-21s wheelhouse listened in on their communications. At approximately 11:00, a plane reported a sub on the surface bearing 150 degrees. The pilot kept repeating this to the Escort Commander, until the reply came back: \\"Stop telling us about it and get the 'bowstud.'\\" A few minutes later, the plane reported back: \\"One down. One down.\\" At 12:14, all ships received a message from the convoy commander confirming the sinking of the second submarine. The weather was thick and visibility only about a mile and a half. At 16:45, they received another message from the Commodore confirming the sinking of a third submarine. The escorts and planes were noted to be having a difficult time with communications due to all of the contacts, real or imagined.Personal Log of LTJG F.X. Moffitt On 10 February 1944, soon after daybreak, the Convoy Commodore sent out another message to all ships announcing that a fourth submarine had been sunk during the night. At 08:30, all LSTs were detached from the main convoy and they headed east to make land. LST-215, with Commander Owles, R.N., was flagship. On 11 February, LST-21 and the other LSTs of Commander William Blair's group (except LST-72 and LST-261 which remained in Oran for repairs) were detached off the southwest coast of Ireland and given one escort. Other LSTs proceeded up the west coast of Ireland for eventual destination of Scapa Flow.Personal Log of LTJG F.X. Moffitt Because of the change in destination from Plymouth to Milford Haven, and thus having no charts of the south coast of Ireland, LST-21s navigation officer took a plotting sheet and drew in the mineswept channel and the lights were plotted in by taking their position from the Admiralty list of lights. With that as a chart, they proceeded through the mineswept channel. At 14:55, the escort reported unidentified aircraft and fired its anti-aircraft guns. LST-21 went to General Quarters.Personal Log of LTJG F.X. Moffitt On 12 February 1944, at 09:00 LST-21 entered Milford Haven and at 09:40 moored off the town of Milford following what was described as a rough and tiring trip.Personal Log of LTJG F.X. Moffitt =Pre-Normandy Invasion Activity in Wales, England and Northern Ireland= LST-21 remained in Milford Haven, until 3 March 1944, when it sailed with other LSTs to Plymouth, England. LST-21 arrived in Plymouth, on 4 March, and remained moored there overnight. On 5 March, LST-21 sailed to Portland, and anchored off the harbor in Weymouth Bay. On 6 March,LST-21 moored in Portland Harbor. At 03:30 on 8 March, LST-21 loaded vehicles and then anchored in Weymouth Bay on 9 and 10 March. At 10:15 on 10 March, LST-21 joined a convoy as part of Operation \\"Fox\\", arriving at Slapton Sands at 6:15 on 11 March. LST-21 beached and discharging its vehicles there as part of that rehearsal for invasion. After anchoring of Slapton Sands for the night, LST-21 got underway on 12 March, for Plymouth, anchoring there briefly before sailing back to Milford Haven, arriving there on 14 March. On 15 March, LST-21 entered the tidal basin at Milford Haven with LST-17. On 16 March, LST-21 was moved to the drydock where it remained until 22 March, at which time it returned to the basin. On 28 March, LST-21 moved out of the basin and into the Haven.Personal Log of LTJG F.X. Moffitt On 31 March 1994, LST-21 sailed to Derry, Northern Ireland, with LST-17, LST-25, LST-72, LST-73, and LST-261. On 1 April, they reached Lough Foyle, and anchored off Moville, before proceeding toward Derry with a pilot, and to the naval base at Lisahally. On 3 April, LST-21 proceeded to the Derry docks where new guns were installed. On 10 April, LST-21 left the Derry docks and sailed out to sea, arriving at Rosneath naval base, Rosneath/Greenock, Scotland on 11 April. On 13 April, LST-21 set sail for Falmouth, England, and entered Falmouth Harbor on April 14. Thereafter, prior to 4 May, LST 21 sailed from Falmouth to Portland, then to Southampton and then to Solent.Personal Log of LTJG F.X. Moffitt =Normandy invasion= By February 1944, LST-21 was in England preparing for the invasion of Normandy. On 16 April 1944, she was transferred with other ships of LST Division 101, Group 51, Flotilla 17, from detached duty with the 11th Amphibious Force to British operational control. LST Division 101 consisted of LST-21 as the flagship, along with LST-17, LST-25, LST-72, LST-73, LST-176, and , all under the tactical command of Commander William S. Blair, USNR. The Division was assigned to Force G, Group \\"Able.\\" On 1 June 1944, she proceeded to Southampton, England, where she loaded 20 officers, 205 men and 73 vehicles of the British Army and after being sealed proceeded to anchorage off the Isle of Wight. Rhino ferry F-100 and a Rhino tug reported on 4 June 1944, and were secured by a stern cable to LST-21 to be towed to Normandy. On 5 June, she got underway at 16:18 in company with LST Group 33, Group 51 of Division 101 and ten craft of the Coast Guard's Rescue Flotilla One and escorts and proceeded to the Normandy coast of France near Le Hamel, Somme, and Arromanches-les- Bains. En route the Rhino tug broke loose and drifted off. At 12:10 on 6 June 1944, LST-21 arrived in the \\"Gold Beach\\" assault area and cast off the Rhino ferry. At 13:50 she discharged six DUKWs from her ramp. Considerable activity was observed on the beaches and the \\"Jig Green\\" beach area was under fire from a German gun situated west of Arromanches-les-Bains. British cruisers lying about off shore carried out a naval bombardment of that area. At 11:46 shells from another German 8.8 cm gun began falling near ships in the area and a British destroyer north of LST-21 engaged the shore battery. The first load was taken into the beach at 15:40 by Rhino ferry and at 19:15 LST-21 got underway toward the beach to meet the Rhino ferry which was laboring through tidal current setting due east. The seas were choppy and the wind freshening. The LST took on 13 casualties from a DUKW and the Rhino ferry returned at 21:45 and departed at 22:40 with the remaining vehicles disembarked from LST-21. The LST then got underway for her assigned anchorage. Ten minutes later ships began making smoke on a red alert, followed nine minutes later by a second red alert. Two minutes later, amidst anti-aircraft fire from the west three bombs successively hit the water on the port beam, a fourth hitting off the starboard bow. At 22:30 a stick of four bombs hit the water from broad on the port bow to dead ahead, and at 23:42 a stick of four bombs hit the water off the port bow. No damage to LST-21 resulted from any of these attacks. There were intermittent alerts and anti-aircraft fire during the morning of 7 June 1944, and in the dive-bombing attack that followed, , north of LST-21, received a bomb hit on the forecastle.

She took the British in tow at 07:10 and took station in an outbound convoy but the vibration cut her speed and she was unable to keep up with the convoy. She proceeded alone at best speed and arrived off Calshot, England, reporting damage and remained anchored from 16 to 18 June, awaiting availability at Southampton Repair Docks. After being repaired, she remained in service between England and Normandy, making shuttle runs back and forth. She departed Falmouth, Cornwall, on 30 June, arriving at Seine Bay, France, on 1 July 1944, with Convoy ECM 19. She left Seine Bay, on 2 July, with Convoy FCM 21 which arrived back in Falmouth, 3 July 1944.

The series debuted on July 28, 2017, on HBO. A twelve-episode second season aired between November 9 and December 15, 2018. On February 8, 2019, HBO revealed that a third season had been filmed and that the network were in talks for a fourth season renewal. The show's twelve-episode third season premiered on September 13, 2019. Filming for season 4 was completed by September 2019. In May 2020, HBO announced that the fourth season would be its last and it premiered on July 24, 2020, and concluded on October 9, 2020. Premise The series is set in a single room of an American hotel, exploring characters who pass through it in each episode. Each episode is a different genre from horror and thriller to comedy. Production The series received a 24-episode order and all the episodes were shot back-to-back as a cost-saving measure, and they were split into two 12-episode seasons. In a December 2018 interview, co-creator Mark Duplass revealed that the third season had already been filmed and edited, and he was writing season 4. According to Duplass, episodes of Room 104 are made for \\"a quarter\\" of the cost typically expected for HBO series. Episodes are conceived in a \\"think tank\\" by the writers where they come up with dozens of ideas, and then they reach out to filmmakers that they are interested in to direct the episodes. Episodes are filmed in a \\"fast and loose\\" manner; for example, Josephine Decker directed her episode in two days only using an iPhone. For the editing process, directors do not receive final cut, and Duplass screens the episodes to a group of 20 people who work at their company for feedback. Reception Room 104 has received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 65 out of 100 based on 22 reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an 87% approval rating with an average score of 6.85 out of 10 based on 39 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Room 104 uses its anthology structure to its advantage, telling a series of short, eclectic stories that hit their marks more often than they miss.\\" Reviewing the entire second season, Ben Travers of IndieWire gave it a positive review with a \\"B+\\" grade. He wrote, \\"the variety of storytelling on display builds such tingly anticipation, each new episode is worth it even when the narrative disappoints\\" and that it is \\"such remarkable, refreshing television that even when it's bad, it's good\\".

It was also later included on the band's 1968 album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers. The version of \\"Old John Robertson\\" featured on the single is a substantially different mix from the version that appeared on The Notorious Byrd Brothers. Writing and recording The song was inspired by the retired film director John S. Robertson who lived in the small town near San Diego where the Byrds' bassist Chris Hillman grew up. Robertson was an aberrant figure around the rural area, frequently being seen wearing a Stetson hat, and sporting a white handlebar mustache, which gave him the appearance of an American frontiersman out of the Wild West. In the song's lyrics, Hillman recalls how the town's children cruelly laughed at Robertson's appearance, and the combination of shock and awe that he provoked in the townspeople. Hillman attempted to capture the visual eccentricity of Robertson by having the band record the song as a country-western two-step. On the album version of the song, an unnamed session musician underscores the visual representation by playing a fiddle, mixed deep within the track. Writer Ric Menck has speculated that the fiddle player is Byron Berline, who had recently moved to Los Angeles and mingled with the Byrds' crowd, as well as appearing on various other country rock albums of the period. The country-tinged nature of \\"Old John Robertson\\", like a handful of other Byrds' songs from the period, foresaw the Byrds' later experimentation with country rock. During the recording of the song, Hillman switched instruments with band member David Crosby to play rhythm guitar, instead of his usual bass. In press conferences, Hillman explained that he was beginning to improve upon his guitar playing, and since he wrote \\"Old John Robertson\\" with the instrument, he wanted to carry it over to the recording, even though Crosby had not played bass since the early days of the group. The album version of the song makes broad use of the audio effects known as phasing and flanging, particularly during the orchestral middle section and third verse. Release The single version of \\"Old John Robertson\\", without the fiddle playing and phasing effects, was issued on the B-side of the Byrds' \\"Lady Friend\\" single in the United States on July 13, 1967. It was also released in this way in mainland Europe, but in the United Kingdom the B-side of \\"Lady Friend\\" was switched to \\"Don't Make Waves\\", another Hillman and McGuinn penned song. The album version of the song appeared in January 1968, on the band's The Notorious Byrd Brothers album. The single mix was first issued on an album in 1982, with the release of the compilation The Original Singles: 1967‚Äì1969, Volume 2. This version of the song was also added as a bonus track to the 1996 Columbia/Legacy reissue of the album Younger Than Yesterday. Additionally, \\"Old John Robertson\\" appears on several other Byrds compilations, including History of The Byrds, Nashville West, The Essential Byrds, and There Is a Season.

Biography =Early life= Wilhelm was the fifth of the eight children of Anne and music teacher Julius Winkler, a family situation that required him to work starting at age 13. He attended law school at Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague, practiced law briefly in 1908, did a stint in the Austrian army, then settled into a position at the Statistical Bureau of Bohemia as the sole German-speaking statistician. While working there, he attended many university classes and reached the conclusion that \\"the German statistical literature did not offer too many ideas. New life came into statistics from England and Russia where the importance of mathematical tools was recognized.\\" =War years= Winkler re-enlisted in the Austrian army at the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and was decorated twice for bravery before being wounded in November 1915. During a lengthy recovery, he worked for the War Economy committee; his talents were recognized and he was appointed Secretary of State for Military Affairs at the end of the war in 1918 and he was a delegate to the Versailles Peace Conference. That year, he also married a Jewish woman named Clara Deutch. He joined the Austrian Central Statistics Office in 1920, and was promoted to director of its department of population statistics in 1925. Concurrently, he became a Privat-Dozent (assistant professor) at the University of Vienna in 1921 and an Ausserordentlicher Professor in 1929. He founded an institute for the study of minority populations, which published a constant stream of progressive and influential papers that made him unpopular with colleagues in his government job. Despite his lack of formal education, he was elected a member of the International Statistical Institute in 1926 where he actively promoted applied and precise mathematical formulations in contrast to the wordy generalizations that he had criticized 20 years earlier. As both the husband of a Jew and an outspoken critic of the unfair treatment of European minorities, Winkler was promptly fired from both his government and academic positions following the 1938 Nazi annexation of Austria. Despite severe persecution from the Nazi party, he wrote the textbook Basic Course in Demography during the occupation. =Later years= At the end of the war, he was rehired by the University of Vienna as the first full professor of statistics since 1883, and became Dean of the School of Law and Statecraft from 1950 to 1955. He was also restored as Austria's lead government statistician from 1945 to 1955. Despite these influential positions and growing international recognition, Winkler spent many years defending the statistical department from opposition within the university. The regressive attitude of Austrian and German academics towards statistics as a truly independent discipline meant that his contributions to international developments became more difficult. He did not retire until age 71, and continued to publish and vigorously promote statistics thereafter. He died just after his 100th birthday, having published 20 textbooks and over 200 papers, founded two statistical societies, edited two statistical journals, been awarded two honorary degrees, and reshaped the development of German- speaking statistics through his progressive education initiatives.

It was built from 1925 to 1960s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 September 2002.  History  The Astor Picture Theatre was built in 1925 as an open-air picture theatre in Surat, which is situated on the Balonne River south of Roma and was the administrative centre of the Warroo Shire until its amalgamation into the Maranoa Region in 2008. The Surveyor-General of New South Wales, Thomas Mitchell, mapped the area in 1846 and the District of Maranoa was proclaimed in November 1848. The new Commissioner of Lands arrived with several police in 1849 and set up camp on Yambougal station, moving slightly up river a few months later. This was the site selected in 1849 by surveyor James Burrowes for a service township on the Balonne River. He called the township Surat, after his former home in Madras, India. The main street, on which the theatre is situated, carries this surveyor's name. A Court of Petty Sessions at Surat was gazetted in 1850 and a police building was erected. The Lands and Post Offices were soon represented and in 1859 a hotel was built. By the time that the town site was surveyed for land sales in 1863, a number of buildings had already been erected. Although Surat was superseded by St George as an administrative centre for the district in 1865, it continued to serve the surrounding area, which became Warroo Shire. Surat gained a school in 1874 and its first church in the late 1870s. In 1879 Cobb and Co set up a coach service from St George to Surat and on to Yuleba, constructing a staging post and store at Surat. This service was run until 1924, when it was the last coach route to be run in Australia. Surat Pictures Limited was formed in 1925 when W Kitson sought building approval for the construction of a picture theatre in the main street of Surat. This was an open-air picture theatre comprising an earth-floored enclosure, a canvas screen at the rear and a shallow building along the street frontage containing a foyer with a projection booth above it. This type of structure was the cheapest and simplest kind of purpose built film venue and was not uncommon at the time in the warmer parts of Australia, though many of them were later roofed over. The Lumiere Brothers had produced the first moving films in Paris in 1895, followed by Edison Studios in America in 1896, although these early films were very short and simply captured events without a narrative. The first feature movie \\"The Story of the Kelly Gang\\" was made in Australia in 1906 and it was the ability of film to tell a story that was the key to its popularity. At first, films were shown as part of variety shows in theatres or were screened in halls. In the 1900s purpose built picture theatres showing a program of films accompanied by music were built in America, Europe and Australia. Some of those catering to centres with large populations were huge and luxurious, though most were far more modest. Films were much less expensive to show than live theatre and the equipment was easily transported, making them well suited as an entertainment in country areas, some films being displayed by travelling \\"picture show men\\" in the early years. The growing popularity of films led to the construction of many open-air theatres or simple shed-like buildings as permanent venues for showing film. Although theatre chains usually owned the large \\"picture palaces\\" in cities, most small picture theatres in Queensland were independently owned and Queensland eventually had more independently owned theatres than any other state in Australia. These small ventures, frequently family owned, did not have the capital to build lavish premises, nor did they have a large client base in country areas and might screen movies only once or twice a week. Having invested in expensive projection equipment, particularly after the advent of talkies, extensions and improvements to picture theatres were often made piecemeal as demand grew and money became available. The Astor Theatre, extended in stages, provides a good illustration of this process. The first films shown at Surat were silent and had a piano accompaniment, a generator providing power for the projector. Bill McKay Senior was the first proprietor and ran the Astor until the 1930s, when it passed to Geoff Armstrong. Between 1938 and 1940 a Mrs. Crump leased it. It was operated during the Second World War by GO and RD Armstrong and was acquired in 1945 by E J and V M Aldridge who ran it as a family business, with their son acting as the projectionist. Country picture theatres provided an important service to people in the surrounding area. Coming into town for a night at the pictures provided good family entertainment, a venue for courtship and an opportunity for people of all ages to meet. Picture theatres showed feature films, newsreels, and cartoons and were often also used for live shows and special events. They provided a stimulus for the imagination and a relief from isolation and anxiety, particularly in the difficult years of the Depression and of World War II. They were a link with the wider community in Australia and with contemporary American culture as presented by Hollywood. For all these reasons, picture going enjoyed widespread popularity throughout rural Queensland between the 1920s and 1950s. Surat was connected to a reticulated water system in 1952 and electricity was laid on in 1953 when the Aldridge family sold the theatre to S Barry, who had run the Queen's Theatre in Toowoomba during World War II. During Barry's ownership the Astor underwent major changes. In the 1950s it was converted into an indoor theatre and roofed over, although it retained an earth floor. Such conversions were commonly made to shelter patrons and improve sound quality. The Royal Theatre at Winton is now the only example of this early open form to survive as a cinema. In the 1960s the Astor was extended substantially, toilets were added and a raked timber floor was installed. The theatre could become very cold in winter and gas heating replaced the chip heaters originally used. It is thought that the interior was also lined with fibrous cement sheeting during this period. Television came to Surat in the 1970s and reduced attendance, as it had elsewhere. Barry sold the theatre to Lawrence Cherry who owned a local service station. Between 1974 and 1981 Cherry, N & M Crain and L & D Waud ran the Astor, which was then purchased by Len and Doreen Waud. Mr Waud had been a projectionist in Sydney in 1936 and his wife an usherette at the Regent in Toowoomba. A new sound system was installed. In common with many rural centres, Surat lost population in the 1980s and 1990s as falling prices and severe drought reduced the town's income and businesses closed. In the mid 1990s a programme to revive the town was set in motion by the local shire council and community and the town is now experiencing an economic resurgence. The Cobb and Co staging station has been developed as a museum and tourist attraction. The Astor Theatre is still used and hosted the Movie Muster, a festival of Australian films, during the Centenary of Federation celebrations in 2001. Although extensions and additions took place in the mid 20th century, these were to improve function as a picture theatre rather than to create change and the building is still a good example of its type, which has become rare. It retains early carbon arc projectors.  Description  The Astor Theatre is situated in the commercial centre of Surat and is a simple rectangular timber building set on low stumps. The roof is gabled and clad in corrugated iron and is concealed from the front by a deep stepped parapet. There are louvred openings in the upper section of the parapet and a cantilevered awning over the entrance. There are exit doors in the side and rear of the building and well as the front entrance. The front section of the building is divided into three and comprises a central foyer with a confectionary bar to the left and the ladies toilets to the right. The projection box is above the foyer and is reached by narrow timber stairs on the left hand side. The auditorium is a simple rectangular space; the walls being lined with timber and fibrous plaster sheeting. The ceiling is unlined and laminated timber struts brace the walls. The floor is raked and there are several louvred timber windows along the walls to provide ventilation. Towards the rear of the building, there are sections of latticework under the eaves. The interior lining now covers this provision for ventilation. There is a speaker area behind the screen and the men's toilets are at this end of the building also. Canvas stretcher chairs provide seating. There is a small shed to the rear of the building and a modern brick footpath has been laid outside the front entrance.  Heritage listing  Astor Theatre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 September 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Astor Picture Theatre, Surat is important in demonstrating the development of picture theatres in Queensland and the part that picture going played in the life of Australia in the 20th century, before it began to be displaced by television. Picture theatres enjoyed widespread popularity, especially in rural areas, as they provided not only entertainment, but also a venue for social interaction and a means of reducing isolation by providing a window into the wider world. The Astor Theatre is evidence for the popularity of picture going throughout rural Queensland between the 1920s and 1950s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Astor is rare as one of the very few early picture theatres remaining in Queensland that have not been adapted for other uses. Alterations have been made over the years to improve its function as a picture theatre, rather than to accommodate changed use. It retains two early projectors in the bio box. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Astor Theatre is a good example of its type, illustrating the way in which many small picture theatres were developed from modest early beginnings and retains characteristics of its type such as long sight lines, a raked floor, foyer, projection box and confectionary counter. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Astor Theatre is centrally located in Surat and makes an important contribution to the built character of the town. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has important associations with the community of the town and the surrounding area, as a venue for social interaction and popular entertainment, and for many members of which it is a focus for memories.

Description The \\"peace\\" has been described as a state of relative non-violence. This is generated from an agreement between different competing organized crime groups to not compete in criminal activity and territory, leading to a stable peace. Governmental authorities may also agree to this peace for their citizens, by non-interference in drug trafficking and other criminal activities. Conversely, organized crime groups benefit from reduced competition and risk, and non-harassment of their members and families. There are allegations that notional capture and escapes of organized crime bosses might be ploys to maintain the peace. It has been felt that an increase in violence after a period of peace is due to a change in the status quo, for example, an increase in competition between groups or political interference. Etymology The name is usually used in reference to the Sicilian Mafia and other Italian organized crime groups. The name is modeled on the Latin Pax Romana (English: \\"Roman Peace\\"), which was a long period of relative peace in the Roman Empire due to its power and influence. Just as this term led to derivative terms, such as Pax Britannica and Pax Americana, the term Pax Mafiosa has also led to derivative usage. The phrase is sometimes written as Pax Mafioso, however Mafiosa is the grammatically correct and more common variant. =As applied to Mexico= The term Pax Sinaloa is used to describe the peace that occurred due to the power of the Sinaloa Cartel during the Mexican Drug War.

It was designed by Harry Marks and was built in 1929 by K O'Brien and C Turnbull. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 8 May 2007.  History  The Warroo Shire Hall was built in 1929 in Surat as an administrative and social centre. Surat is situated on the Balonne River some south of Roma and was the administrative hub of the Warroo Shire until 2008 when the shire was amalgamated into Maranoa Region. The Surveyor-General of New South Wales, Thomas Mitchell, mapped the area in 1846 and the District of Maranoa was proclaimed in November 1848.

In 1879 Cobb and Co set up a coach service from St George to Surat and on to Yuleba, constructing a staging post and store at Surat. This service was run until 1924, when it was the last coach route to be run in Australia. The site of the shire hall was acquired in 1882 by the Warroo Divisional Board. Tenders were called for the construction of a simple building, which was extended over the years. In 1903, the Divisional Board became Warroo Shire Council. In 1920 a second small building was constructed on the site as council offices. This building was later removed. The current hall was constructed in 1929 by builders K O'Brien and C Turnbull to the design of Harry Marks of the firm of Harry J Marks & Son of Toowoomba. James Marks, who arrived from England in 1866, founded the firm. He moved to Toowoomba in 1874, working as a contractor before setting up an architectural practice in 1880. In the late 1880s his eldest son, Henry James (Harry) joined the firm to train with his father. In 1892 the firm became James Marks & Son. The office designed a wide range of residential, institutional and commercial buildings. Harry's brother Reginald joined the practice in 1906 when James retired. Harry's son Charles also worked in the practice, though he joined the Defence Forces in 1915. In 1917 Reginald moved to Sydney. When Charles joined the practice in 1924, it became Harry J Marks and Son. Harry Marks was an innovative and idiosyncratic designer who introduced a number of his inventions into buildings he designed, including the patented Austral window. On a number of occasions Marks designed windows especially for a commissioned building and the windows in the Warroo hall are a distinctive feature of the design. They pivot to improve ventilation, a particular interest of Marks'. The building was officially opened on Friday 7 March 1930 by the Federal Member for Maranoa, James Hunter, having been funded by a ¬£4,000 loan from the Queensland Government, the first time the shire had borrowed funds. The new building combined offices and a meeting room for the Shire Council with a large open hall to be used for a variety of public and private functions and events and which contained a stage and projection booth. Surat was connected to a reticulated water system in 1952 and electricity was laid on in 1953. The three clock faces in the tower are a memorial to Alex J Simpson who was Chairman of Warroo Shire from 1925 to 1946 and who was killed in a car accident in 1947. On each clock face, the letters of his name replace the usual numerals. The clock was officially unveiled on Saturday 3 April 1954. It was decided to illuminate them in 1961. The original hall was retained on site as a supper room, at first alongside the new hall, then to its rear, before being destroyed by a storm in 1962. A new civic centre was constructed in 1963 and the Shire Council has since used this venue for its meetings and offices. The hall continues in community use and has a new supper room, constructed in 1961, to its southern side. This building has no heritage significance, nor does the modern toilet block constructed to the rear of the hall. The hall is very intact and appears to have been painted in a version of the existing colour scheme since at least 1955. Part of the northern verandah has been enclosed and fitted with a small kitchenette, probably in the 1960s. This may be the 'Gentlemen's Dressing Room' referred to as being fitted with casement windows in 1957. The former Council Meeting Room and Shire Offices are currently used for community craft activities.  Description  The Warroo Shire hall is located prominently on the corner of two major streets in the centre of Surat. It is a rectangular timber building with its long axis at right angles to the street. It is set on low stumps and has a gabled roof clad with corrugated iron sheeting and ventilators along the roof ridge. There is an awning supported on plain timber posts to the pavement and recessed verandahs along both sides. The front (eastern) elevation has a square central clock tower with clock faces to the north, south and eastern sides. Letters spelling out \\"Alex J Simpson\\" have replaced the numerals. Below the clock is a square window and a small balcony jutting out over the street awning. The windows form a distinctive decorative feature of the building, being square, circular or arched with unusual glazing patterns and decoratively placed glazing bars. A 1930 photograph of the shire offices shows the square windows opening on a central, horizontal pivot. They can no longer be opened, but the hall windows are still operational. The windows to the sides of the offices at the front have individual sun hoods. The front entrance is recessed and opens onto a short hallway between two large square rooms. The projection room is over the hall and is accessed by a staircase inside the hall. The large hall is lined with fibrous cement sheeting and triangular brackets between high-level windows support the roof. The windows have round arched tops and open on central pivots. The floor is timber and there is a stage flanked by dressing rooms to the rear. The separate supper room is a simple rectangular timber building with a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. It runs parallel to the hall and is linked to it by a covered way and a courtyard area. It contains a dining area, kitchenette and a small bar to the rear. There is a block of masonry toilets to the rear of the hall. A high fence of tubular metal posts and metal mesh surrounds the site.  Heritage listing  Warroo Shire Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 8 May 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Warroo Shire Hall demonstrates the way in which much of western Queensland was settled by means of small service towns on supply routes. They provided a scattered population with essential goods and services, administrative facilities and the social structure to develop a sense of community. The Warroo hall provided a meeting place for the Shire Council and a venue for formal and informal social events and still serves the community. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Warroo Shire Hall is a rare and intact surviving timber shire hall, of which many were constructed, but few now survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Warroo Shire Hall is a fine and intact example of a timber shire hall of its era, catering for both administrative and social functions in its design. It has rooms for shire offices, with a large hall, stage, projection booth and small kitchen to the rear. Its toilets and separate supper room are now modern structures. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Warroo Shire Hall is an important public building in a prominent location and in form, scale and materials makes a strong visual contribution to the townscape and character of Surat. Its central clock tower forms an important part of its landmark quality. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Warroo Shire Hall has a long connection with the people of Surat and the surrounding district as a focus for a range of important community services and social events. These have been as varied as wedding receptions and professional concerts by visiting performers. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Warroo Shire hall was designed by H J (Harry) Marks and is associated with his life and work as a member of the important Toowoomba architectural practice which encompassed the work of three generations of the Marks family.

He is among the first group of Internet entrepreneurs in China, and also the founder, former Chairman and CEO of HiChina Corporation (WWW.NET.CN) as well as the Chairman and CEO of Tixa Internet Technology Corporation. Zhang foresaw the potential of the Internet and provided domain name registration and web hosting services from the end of 1995, leading HiChina to earn the largest share of the Chinese market in this field. Later he started his second company, Tixa, and continued to innovate while holding positions in organizations like the All-China Youth Federation and the China Council for International Investment Promotion. Early life Zhang enrolled in Beijing Normal University at 16 years old. His paper on the Principle of Relativity written at 17 years old impressed a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but shortly afterwards, he willingly stopped schooling at 18 years old. Professional life Between 1990 and 1994, Zhang went on to experience the role of a normal staff member and the transition from failure to success in founding businesses. Helping Zhang gain operation experience and a deep understanding for company management, his work expanded through industries such as international trade, shipping, tourism, bid management, equipment development, computer exhibition, and more. At 22 years old, Zhang became one of the few Chinese youth entrepreneurs. In 1994, Zhang foresaw the potential of the Internet. Initially interested in the Bulletin Board System (BBS), he started to create one of his own. He eventually decided to suspend all of his other businesses and focus on the Internet industry. At the end of 1995, Zhang founded HiChina Co. (Chinese: ‰∏áÁΩë) (WWW.NET.CN), which was to become the largest domain name registration and web hosting service company in China. As the Chairman and CEO, Zhang led the startup company from a size of a few more than 10 staff members to a size of thousands. In January 2000, Zhang initiated the \\"Net.cn Plan\\", associating with Sina, Sohu, NetEase, Changhong, Kelon, Computer World, China Info World (CIW), China Internet Network Information Center, China Information Association, and 37 other notable companies and organizations, and created the \\"Zhong Guo Qi Ye Shang Wang Fu Wu Lian Meng\\" (Translated as: Internet Services for China Businesses Alliance). Zhang also announced that the year 2000 would be China's \\"Qi Ye Shang Wang Nian\\" (Translated as: Year of Internet Utilization for Businesses). During HiChina's development, Zhang led HiChina through two rounds of equity trades with major investors including IDG Ventures, TPG Newbridge, and more. In 1998, Zhang completed his Master's degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In November 2001, Zhang chose to abdicate his position, only remaining as a shareholder, and collaborated with his long-time friends to found a new company \\"VeryE.com\\". VeryE would create a brand new Internet business model, making the Internet more practical. In February 2004, VeryE obtained investment from Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Japan Asia Investment Co. (JAIC), MIH Investments, and became Tixa Co. (WWW.TIXA.COM).

Like many of her class, she was not named and is properly referred to by her hull designation. Construction LST-22 was laid down on 5 November 1942, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by the Dravo Corporation; launched on 29 March 1943; sponsored by Mrs. W. A. Barnes. She was floated down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers by a Navy ferry crew to the Naval Section Base, Algiers, Louisiana, in May 1943. Her first commanding officer, Lieutenant Lawrence N. Ditlefsen, USCG, took command on 29 May 1943, and LST-22 was formally commissioned on 16 June 1943. She then proceeded on her shakedown cruise to Panama City, Florida. Service history During the war, LST-22 served exclusively and extensively in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater from September 1943 until November 1945. LST-22 sailed from Galveston, Texas, on 19 July 1943, with Convoy HK 109 heading for Key West, Florida, where she arrived on 23 July. LST-22 joined a convoy to Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, and the Panama Canal, toward the end of July 1943, on the first leg of the cruise to the Southwest Pacific. Stopping at Bora Bora, Tutula, Viti Levu and Noumea the LST reached Brisbane, Australia, late in September 1943. LST-22 participated in the landing at Scarlet Beach during the Battle of Finschhafen from 22‚Äì24 September 1943. In November 1943, she sailed from Townsville, Australia to Milne Bay, Oro Bay, Lae, Buna, and back to Milne Bay. Early December saw the LST in Port Moresby, then to Lae, in Task Unit 76.3.6 with RAAF equipment and personnel aboard. At Goodenough Island, a Marine cargo was loaded consisting of combat vehicles and gear of the First Marine Division to be landed at Cape Cretin and on 13 December 1943, LST-22 completed loading Marine Corps personnel and joined Task Force 76.2.2 consisting of two Coast Guard-staffed and five Navy- staffed LSTs with three destroyers and for Cape Gloucester, New Britain. LST-22 participated in the Cape Gloucester landings, New Britain at the end of December 1943 and January 1944. After beaching at Cape Gloucester on 26 December 1943, the ship underwent its first enemy air raid. Returning to Goodenough Island, another combat load was taken to Saidor, New Guinea, beaching there on 2 January 1944. The next two months were occupied in resupply echelons. A second trip to Saidor on 8 January 1944, was followed by a second trip to Cape Gloucester on 14 January 1944. On 1 February 1944, a third trip was made to Cape Gloucester. On 4 February, a second trip to Saidor she underwent four \\"red\\" alerts during loading operations. On 25 February, she again departed Cape Sudest for Cape Gloucester, returning to Buna Roads to take an LCM in tow on 27 February, for Cape Cretin together with two other LSTs, departing on 29 February, for the Admiralty Islands with the LCM still in tow. She arrived at Hyane Harbor, Los Negros Island, on 2 March 1944, in a support of the Admiralty Islands landings during the initial phase of the operation. While on the assignment the ship came under enemy mortar fire and on orders of the Task Group Commander, opened fire with her /50 caliber gun on the mortar fire area. During the afternoon she underwent an enemy attack, no casualties resulting from enemy action but three men being injured from an exploding shell which hit the guard rail. Arriving at Cape Sudest on 4 March 1944, the LST commenced loading cargo for a resupply run to Seeadler Harbor on 9 March, and returned to Cape Sudest on 12 March. Trips to Buna Roads, Cape Cretin, Lae, Seeadler Harbor and Buna Roads with cargo consumed the rest of March 1944. After 14 days at Buna Roads for anchor upkeep and training, LST-22 proceeded to load cargo at Goodenough Island, and departing for Cape Cretin, on 18 April, formed Task Group 77.4 for Tanalmeral Bay, Dutch New Guinea, arriving there 23 April 1944. There they participated in the Hollandia operation on D-day plus one and underwent several 'red' alerts but no enemy action, departing next day for Cape Cretin. The first half of May 1944 was occupied with runs carrying cargo for Aitape, from Seeadler Harbor, and to Hollandia. On 18 May 1944, the ship was underway for Wakde, Dutch New Guinea, with an LCT in tow, beaching there under enemy fire on 19 May. One man was wounded from enemy fire, and cargo was discharged under sporadic fire from enemy emplacements on the beach. A second trip to Wake was made on 23 May. This was followed by a trip with cargo for the Biak Island invasion on 28 May, after which was taken in tow for Hollandia. June was taken up with two more trips to Biak and another to Arare, Wakde Island, where she beached on 6 July 1944. On 9 July, she proceeded to Noemfoor, four days after the surprise landing there on 2 July, and after unloading returned to Humboldt Bay. Trips to Maffin Bay, Cape Sansapor landings and Alexishafen, New Guinea, consumed the rest of July and August 1944. Following dry docking and overhaul at Alexishafen, preparations were made for the Morotai landings. With echelon of LSTs, LCIs, and LCTs in tow, she departed Hollandia, 11 September 1944, with cargo and personnel discharged at Morotai on 16 September 1944. Just before beaching at Morotai, an enemy plane was fired upon by LST-22 and was thought to be damaged by her guns. Returning to Hollandia, she moved again to Alexishafen, for overhaul and installation of more antiaircraft guns, returning to Hollandia, on 7 October 1944. From the Western New Guinea area the \\"Love 6\\" echelon with destination Leyte, Philippine Islands, was formed and departed Hollandia, on 23 October 1944, to participate in General Douglas MacArthur's promised liberation of the islands from the Japanese occupation. Unloading was carried out 30 October, \\"D\\" plus 10 day, following a typhoon which the ship rode out at anchor. Returning to Hollandia, on 5 November 1944, a trip to Milne Bay followed and on 19 December, she departed for Aitape, for practice exercises with elements of the 43rd Infantry. On 28 December 1944, \\"George 1\\" echelon of Task Group 78 was formed with the ultimate destination of Lingayen Gulf, Luzon. Various elements joined until the entire task group was formed before entering the Philippines. Several enemy planes were seen attacking en route but only one came within range and this was destroyed by the fire from several LSTs, with partial credit to the crew of LST-22. One casualty resulted when a strafing bullet from the plane went through the thigh of an Army photographer on board. On 9 January 1945, two hours before \\"H\\" hour, LVTs were launched to carry the first assault wave to San Fabian Beach. The ship discharged the balance of her cargo at \\"H\\" hour plus one, with the aid of the pontoons carried from Milne Bay. The balance of 9 January, and that night were spent at anchor with occasional air raids. Next day she departed for Leyte, the focal point for future movements replacing Hollandia, and remained there until 22 January 1945. On 27 January, she began a resupply run to Lingayen Gulf, discharging cargo and personnel and departing 8 February for Mindoro Island to take on a load for Leyte Gulf. From 15 February to 6 March 1945, was spent in the Leyte Gulf area, LST-22 departing for Manila, on 14 March, and returning to Leyte, on 26 March 1945. Two shuttle trips to Manila were made in April. LST-22 left Leyte, on 8 May 1945, with Convoy IG 21, for Hollandia, Dutch East Indies, where she arrive on 14 May 1945. From Hollandia, she went to Madang, New Guinea, to pick up an Australian Tank Company to be transported to Cape Torokina, Bougainville. From there she went to Green Island to load equipment for the Royal New Zealand Air and Ground Forces for Jacquinot Bay, New Britain, and reloaded there with Australian Ground Forces for Wide Bay, New Britain. From Wide Bay, she proceeded to Manus Island, for availability for cleaning and painting her bottom. Arriving at Subic Bay on 10 July 1945, she unloaded for a limited availability after which she departed for Manila. Here she loaded cargo for Palawan, where she unloaded early in August, 1945, and from there proceeded to Zamboanga City, Mindanao. Here she loaded a full cargo and personnel for Leyte. The war was now over. After unloading at Leyte, she departed for Manican Island, for a 30-day availability beginning on 20 August 1945. On 23 September 1945, she was ordered to Leyte, and departed for Wakde Island, to load, as part of operations of lifting troops from rear areas. Loading at Wakde, with cargo and personnel for Zamboanga, she reloaded there for Agusan, Mindanao, and from there proceeded to Bacolod, Negros, Philippine Islands, to pick up an amphibious truck company and Philippine Army personnel. Proceeding to Dumaguette, Negros, the Philippine Army personnel were debarked and she proceeded to Mactan Island, unloading the rest of her cargo and personnel at Cebu City, Cebu. Loading at Mactan, she departed for Guiuan, Samar, and after unloading proceeded to San Pedro Bay, Leyte.

The victims had consumed hooch (spurious liquor) and complained of nausea and stomach ache.  Background  Prohibition on country-made liquor was imposed in Bihar by the Nitish Kumar led state government on 1 April 2016.  Incident  On the night of 15 August 2016, some people in Khajur Vani locality in Gopalganj town consumed country-made liquor (hooch) and began suffering from stomach pain and vomiting. After being rushed to hospital for treatment, five people died by late evening and overnight eight more deaths took place, raising the death toll to 13. Three people are said to have lost their vision. Locals and family members claimed the deaths took place after these people consumed spurious liquor. However, the administration denied the deaths took place due to consuming spurious liquor with police claiming food poisoning as the cause of death.  Aftermath  The administration constituted a three-member committee to probe the deaths and suspended 25 policemen including the station house officer (SHO) for dereliction of their duties in strictly enforcing liquor ban. The Gopalganj police suspect Nagina Pasi to be the mastermind behind the hooch tragedy. Nagina and his brother Lal Babu Choudhary & six associates involved in the business of manufacturing illicit country made liquor were arrested on 20 August 2016. Soon after the incident, local police dug many parts of Khajur Vani locality and recovered about 1000 liters of illegal country made liquor which was hidden underground. Names of victims The names of the victims are Parma Mahto, Mantu Giri, Shashikant Mahto, Dinesh Mahto, Umesh, Ramji Sharma, Manoj Shah, Ramu Ram, Anil Ram, Jhamindra Mahto, Munna Kumar and Nasir Alam.  Political reactions  Janata Dal (United) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar denied the Gopalganj incident was a hooch tragedy saying, \\"Till medical reports and FSL reports prove that liquor was found in the body or blood, we cannot say its a hooch tragedy\\". BJP legislature party leader and former deputy chief minister of Bihar, Sushil Kumar Modi said ‚ÄúOverall, 30 people, including the 13 in Gopalganj, have died due to consumption of spurious liquor. But the administration fudges the report, blaming the deaths on contaminated food. Only Mahadalits and the poor are suffering due to Nitish‚Äôs Taliban-like ban on liquor.‚Äù Mangal Pandey, Bihar BJP president, called the tragedy a failure of Nitish Kumar and wondered how despite prohibition law in place, illegal country-made liquor was being manufactured and consumed by people. He accused the administration of covering up the case and trying to prepare fake medical reports to show that deaths were not due to liquor consumption. Another senior BJP leader Nand Kishore Yadav said, \\"This government has completely failed in curbing the consumption of liquor, despite imposing tough laws. The incident proves that law is just a tool to harass innocents, while others are simply defying the law. The chief minister must take moral responsibility‚Äù See also *Alcohol prohibition in India *Bihar Excise (Amendment) Act, 2016 *List of alcohol poisonings in India References Alcohol-related deaths in India 2016 disasters in India Crime in Bihar August 2016 events in India Gopalganj district, India ","title":"Bihar alcohol poisonings"},{"id":"51347796","text":"Carlos R√∫ben Navarro Valdez (born 8 May 1996) is a Mexican taekwondo athlete.

Pie won the gold medal in the 2014 Central American and Caribbean Games and silver in the 2013 Bolivarian Games, 2015 Pan American Games and bronze medalist in the 2015 Military World Games. He belongs to the Dominican Olympic program CRESO. Personal life Pie is tall , born on March 4, 1986 in Bayaguana, Monte Plata. He is the older son of Jos√© Beltr√°n, a Haitian, and Marisol Pi√© Desquile, who was born in the Dominican Republic to Haitian parents. Pi√©'s father, an agricultural labourer in the Dominican Republic, lacked care for him and did not give him his surname. He was raised by his Dominican step-father Euclides Reyes and his mother. He went to the Morayma Veloz de B√°ez High school and as of 2016, as of 2016, studies Physical education at Instituto Superior de Formaci√≥n Docente Salom√© Ure√±a in 2015, before switching to Universidad Nacional Evang√©lica in 2016. Pie joined the Centro de Iniciaci√≥n Deportiva Escolar (CIDE) led by Isaac Ogando, where he were signed after his participation in the 2012 National Elementary School Games, practicing track and field with the coach Francisca Tiburcio when he was ten but later the coach H√©ctor Rodr√≠guez helped him to switch to Taekwondo one year later. He is a member of the Dominican Navy since 2011 with the lowest rank. His brother Bernardo, is also a professional Taekwondo fighter, who competed together in the 2014 Central American and Caribbean Games. = Nationality controversy = Following his achievement of a Central American and Caribbean Games gold medal in Veracruz 2014, his Haitian origin sparked some discussion. His mother, Marisol Pie Desquile, appeared in TV news expressing her excitement for his son's victory, speaking with a heavy Haitian accent, which made many people doubt the Dominicanness of Pie. Two years later, after he won an Olympic bronze medal in Rio 2016, a controversy burst about Pie's nationality, especially in social media. On 19 August 2016 the Junta Central Electoral (), issued a press release congratulating Luisito Pie's for his Olympic medal and stating that Marisol Pie's father had a c√©dula, meaning that he was legal, and denied that she ‚Äîand thereby her children‚Äî had any problem with . Nevertheless, she appears indeed in the JCE official list of people that were unlawfully registered in the Dominican Civil Registry. Hence, Marisol and Luisito Pie were benefited of the special Dominican law for said people, law 169-14. Career =2013= Pie won the 2013 Bolivarian Games silver medal in the 58 kg category after 16-17 falling to the Colombia Luis Mu√±oz in the final contest. He later blame the lack of experience the reason of his loss. =2014= Pie fought against the Olympic medalist Gabriel Mercedes and C√©sar Mart√≠nez for the 58 kg category spot in the national team, both Mart√≠nez and Pie eliminating Mercedes in the process, and Martinez defeating Pie in the final contest. Pie later was changed to the 63 kg cat for the Central American and Caribbean Games qualifier, while Mart√≠nez defended the 58 category. While training for the Central American Caribbean Games with his coach H√©ctor Rodr√≠guez, he expressed that his dream was climb through the regional games then compete in the 2016 Summer Olympics, dream that he wanted to achieve with strong dedication, even though he had only been a member of the national team for one year. He thanked his teammates and coaches when he won the gold medal in the qualifier mixing different technics in front of every fighter of the 63 kg category. He defeated 10-0 to Rafael Mota Jr from Puerto Rico in the preliminary round, he then win 20-0 over Guayanese Jibreel Malik and 11-6 to the Cuban Ernesto Molina in the semifinals before defeating Venezuelan Gustavo Machado. Soon after that, Pie won the gold medal in the Santo Domingo Open, when he defeated the Mexican Abel Mendoza helping the Dominican Republic to reach the second place in the event. He later won the 58 kg category gold medal of the Pan American Championship held in Aguascalientes, Mexico, winning over the Argentinian Lucas Guzman in the championship contest. After this series of victories, Pie was said to be one of the main figures and biggest medal hopes for his home country by the Dominican Republic Taekwondo Federation president, Francisco Camacho. He won the 58 kg Central American and Caribbean Games gold medal recovering from a last minute tie kick from silver medalist the Venezuela Mario Leal. He considered this medal a step towards his Olympic medal dream and said that he only worked for the gold medal and would not settled with anything else, while considering that hard and teamwork were the secret for this success. =2015= The Dominican Republic Olympic Committee awarded Pie as 2014 Taekwondo Athlete of Year while being defined as one of the new talents of the Dominican Republic sport and the heir of the dynasty of national taekwondo. Pie was also awarded Most Valuable Fighter from the National University Taekwondo tournament held in April, when he won the gold medal by winning by superiority -margins of more than 12 points- all his combats, helping Instituto Superior de Formaci√≥n Docente Salom√© Ure√±a to reach the tournament's second place. He later went to the 2014‚Äì15 University Sports Gala with fellow athletes and his university sport director to pick up the top award for the second year in a row. The president of the Dominican Republic University Sports Commission, Vice Minister Marcos D√≠az regretted that the Pan American Games were taking place at the same time of the 2015 Summer Universiade, because the nation had to prioritize the first ones, not being able to count with Pie representing his home country. He then participated in the qualification tournament in Aguascalientes, Mexico, winning the berth for the 2015 Pan American Games. He was focus to give his home country and for himself a medal. And he started winning 8-6 to the Argetinian Lucas Guzm√°n, 13-14 to the Venezuelan Mario Leal in the quarterfinals and 3‚Äì4 in the semifinals to the Aruban veteran John Maduro before he lost by sudden death point to the Mexican Carlos Navarro 7‚Äì8, winning the 58 kg Pan American Games silver medal. He later confessed that lack of international warm ups before the games affected his level of fighting, because of the quality of rivals that he had to face in the preliminary rounds. After the regional games, Pie was invited for his ranking points, to take part in the WTF World Grand Prix Series held in Moscow, falling to the Portuguese Rui Bragan√ßa in the first contest 5‚Äì6 in the 58 kg Pie lost 11-13 once again to the Mexican Navarro in the Pan American Open WTF G1 in Aguascalientes, winning again the silver medal. and later in Samnsun, Turkey falling 4‚Äì5 in golden point to Nursultan Mamayev in the first round. He was selected to participate in the Military World Games along with Mois√©s Hern√°ndez and he won the 58 kg bronze medal. In the Dominican Republic Hall of Fame 2015 Ceremony, Pie was invited to carry one of the hall symbols, the Machete during the induction ceremony. His 2015 competition year ended by winning to the Tunisian Hedi Nefatti the Morocco Open G1 gold medal. =2016= In February he won the 63 kg category bronze medal in the U.S. Open held in Reno, Nevada. He won the qualifier tournament 58 kg gold medal and qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics and for the first time his country would have more than one representative, when two other fellow competitors also qualified. He considered this qualification revealed the country's new level as they test themselves at that high standard, they would fight for medals no matter what kind. After the qualifier, he won the 63 kg bronze medal in the Mexico Open, held in the same venue. The Guild of Sports Writers gave Pie the 2015 Taekwondo Athlete of the year award in its April Gala. Pie traveled to Benic√†ssim, Spain, there he won the 58 kg silver medal after losing 6-7 to the Mexican Carlos Navarro in the 14th Spanish Open and two weeks later, the Hamburg German Open 58 kg bronze medal. With the results from Spain and Germany, he was focus in his preparation for the Olympics and confessed that he felt not pressure but commitment to a medal result. He did not travel to the Pan American Championship to take time to treat an injury. With the guidance of his coach Miguel Camacho, he said that he felt himself in good shape and ready to face any of the best competitors. He advanced to the Olympic tournament quarterfinal round after his first opponent, the German Levent Tuncat was injured in training and unable to compete; Pie said that he was ready to pursuit his Olympic glory after the training base they spent in San Luis Potos√≠, Mexico. He defeated 4-1 to the Portuguese Rui Bragan√ßa in the quarterfinals and lost 7-11 to Tawin Hanprab from Thailand in the semifinal round but recovered to win 6-5 by sudden death to the Spanish Jes√∫s Tortosa to win the bronze medal, that was the country's only medal in the games. After he returned to his homeland, he proclaimed that he fought for all the 10 million of Dominicans, at the time he was welcome by the President of the Dominican Republic Olympic Committee and the Minister of Sports Danilo D√≠az, who revealed that Pie would be awarded with an apartment and an amount in cash that will be revealed in private. He received congratulatory letter from the Dominican president Danilo Medina, hoping that Pie keeps behaving himself as an example for the youth. The Universidad Nacional Evang√©lica took advantage of the 2015-16 University sport top award celebration to give Pie a recognition for his Olympic success.

Tiangong-2 is China's second Space Laboratory module which was launched on 15 Sep 2016. Tiangong-2 carries a total of 14 mission and experiment packages, including Space-Earth quantum key distribution () and laser communications experiment to facilitate space-to- ground quantum communication. A satellite, nicknamed Micius or Mozi () after the ancient Chinese philosopher and scientist, is operated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as ground stations in China. The University of Vienna and the Austrian Academy of Sciences are running the satellite's European receiving stations. QUESS is a proof-of-concept mission designed to facilitate quantum optics experiments over long distances to allow the development of quantum encryption and quantum teleportation technology. Quantum encryption uses the principle of entanglement to facilitate communication that is totally safe against eavesdropping, let alone decryption, by a third party. By producing pairs of entangled photons, QUESS will allow ground stations separated by many thousands of kilometres to establish secure quantum channels. QUESS itself has limited communication capabilities: it needs line-of-sight, and can only operate when not in sunlight. Further Micius satellites were planned, including a European‚ÄìAsian quantum-encrypted network by 2020, and a global network by 2030. The mission cost was around US$100 million in total.  Mission  The initial experiment demonstrated quantum key distribution (QKD) between Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory near √úr√ºmqi and Xinglong Observatory near Beijing ‚Äì a great-circle distance of approximately . In addition, QUESS tested Bell's inequality at a distance of ‚Äì further than any experiment to date ‚Äì and teleported a photon state between Shiquanhe Observatory in Ali, Tibet Autonomous Region, and the satellite. This requires very accurate orbital maneuvering and satellite tracking so the base stations can keep line-of-sight with the craft. Once experiments within China concluded, QUESS created an international QKD channel between China and the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, Vienna, Austria ‚àí a ground distance of , enabling the first intercontinental secure quantum video call in 2016. = Launch = The launch was initially scheduled for July 2016, but was rescheduled to August, with notification of the launch being sent just a few days in advance. The spacecraft was launched by a Long March 2D rocket from Jiuquan Launch Pad 603, Launch Area 4 on 17 August 2016, at 17:40 UTC (01:40 local time). = Multi-payload mission = The launch was a multi-payload mission shared with QUESS, LiXing-1 research satellite, and ¬≥Cat-2 Spanish science satellite. * LiXing-1: LiXing-1 is a Chinese satellite designed to measure upper atmospheric density by lowering its orbit to 100‚Äì150 km. Its mass is 110 kg. On 19 August 2016, the satellite reentered into the atmosphere, so the mission is closed. * ¬≥Cat-2: The 3Cat-2 (spelled \\"cube-cat-two\\") is the second satellite in the 3Cat series and the second satellite developed in Catalonia at Polytechnic University of Catalonia‚Äôs NanoSat Lab. It is a 6-Unit CubeSat flying a novel GNSS Reflectometer (GNSS-R) payload for Earth observation. Its mass is 7.1 kg.  Secure key distribution  The main instrument on board QUESS is a \\"Sagnac effect\\" interferometer. This is a device which generates pairs of entangled photons, allowing one of each to be transmitted to the ground. This will allow QUESS to perform Quantum key distribution (QKD) ‚Äì the transmission of a secure cryptographic key that can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages ‚Äì to two ground stations. QKD theoretically offers truly secure communication. In QKD, two parties who want to communicate share a random secret key transmitted using pairs of entangled photons sent with random polarization, with each party receiving one half of the pair. This secret key can then be used as a one-time pad, allowing the two parties to communicate securely through normal channels. Any attempt to eavesdrop on the key will disturb the entangled state in a detectable way. QKD has been attempted on Earth, both with direct line- of-sight between two observatories, and using fibre optic cables to transmit the photons. However, fibre optics and the atmosphere both cause scattering which destroys the entangled state, and this limits the distance over which QKD can be carried out. Sending the keys from an orbiting satellite results in less scattering, which allows QKD to be performed over much greater distances. In addition, QUESS tests some of the basic foundations of quantum mechanics. Bell's theorem says that no local hidden variable theory can ever reproduce the predictions of quantum physics, and QUESS will be able to test the principle of locality over .  Analysis  QUESS lead scientist Pan Jianwei told Reuters that the project has \\"enormous prospects\\" in the defence sphere. The satellite will provide secure communications between Beijing and √úr√ºmqi, capital of Xinjiang, the remote western region of China. The US Department of Defense believes China is aiming to achieve the capability to counter the use of enemy space technology. Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping has prioritised China's space program, which has included anti- satellite missile tests, and the New York Times noted that quantum technology was a focus of the thirteenth five-year plan, which the China government set out earlier that year. The Wall Street Journal said that the launch put China ahead of rivals, and brought them closer to \\"hack-proof communications\\". Several outlets identified Edward Snowden's leak of US surveillance documents as an impetus for the development of QUESS, with Popular Science calling it \\"a satellite for the post-Snowden age\\".  Similar projects  QUESS is the first spacecraft launched capable of generating entangled photons in space, although transmission of single photons via satellites has previously been demonstrated by reflecting photons generated at ground-based stations off orbiting satellites. While not generating fully entangled photons, correlated pairs of photons have been produced in space using a cubesat by the National University of Singapore and the University of Strathclyde. A German consortium has performed quantum measurements of optical signals from the geostationary Alphasat Laser Communication Terminal. The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched the Quiness macroscopic quantum communications project to catalyze the development of an end-to-end global quantum internet in 2012.

She is a Women's Rights activist fighting against the death penalty in general and specifically against the stoning of women and minors in Iran.  Early life  Amini grew up in the Mazandaran Province in northern Iran. She was the third of four sisters. Her family originated from the gentry of feudal times. They owned land and animals and employed gardeners and housekeepers. In Northern Iran women were allowed to own property and work with their pants and sleeves rolled up. But men did still commonly have multiple wives. Aminis father was a teacher. He was religious but practiced lightly. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979 Amini's family lost a lot of their wealth and became middle class. Amini and her sister's spent a lot of time reading, writing and painting. She started visiting an afternoon's poetry circle at a local library. Asieh wanted to become a painter or writer. Amini's life changed after the Iranian Revolution. She hated the mandatory black hijab all girls had to wear and cried when she put it on. Her mother explained to her that it was a rule no one could disobey. A lot of young men returned from the Iran‚ÄìIraq War without limbs or didn't return at all. Some of her family members were opposed to the regime and imprisoned, others were supportive of the regime.  Career  Amini started studying journalism at Tabataba'i University in Tehran in 1993. While still studying she started writing for newspapers. She began at the hard-line daily Kayhan. Then she moved on to the larger newspaper Iran. When a colleague was supposed to interview a poet that Amini liked he took her along. The poet invited her into his writer's circle. The newspaper Iran started a youth supplement and Amini became the cultural editor. For these times in Iran, a woman being in such a senior position was unusual. She was responsible for 28 pages, supervised men that were older than her and was frequently scrutinized by the paper's editor-in-chief. One day one of her colleagues pulled her aside. He was fighting back tears when he advised her to leave the job. When she asked why, he said that every day the colleagues were speaking ill of her, they didn't like a young single woman to be in such a position. \\"That's their problem, not mine.\\" Amini said. When Mohammad Khatami was elected president in 1997, the bans were lifted a little and more daring publications emerged. More women entered journalism. Amini took up a job at the newspaper Zan, which covered women's affairs. Although Amini opposed the idea of segregating news by gender, she took on the job. The newspaper Zan was unfortunately banned. Subsequently, Amini took on freelancer work. After giving birth Amini started working as the social editor of the newspaper Etemaad. She also ran a website called Women in Iran. After the situation in Iran became too dangerous for her Amini decided to leave the country. Through a friend she got the opportunity to become a guest writer within the ICORN network in Trondheim, Norway from 2010 until 2012. She stayed in Norway and completed a master's degree in Equality and diversity at NTNU. Amini is a member of the Norwegian PEN Board of Directors.  Activism  Amini founded the 'Stop Stoning Forever Campaign' in October 2006. She worked together with a well known feminist from Iran and two writers from outside the country who could publish without censorship. She is fighting gender- based injustices in Iran's judicial system and is advocating for an end of stoning as a form of execution. She started her activism when she met a 16-year-old girl named Atefeh Sahaaleh who had endured a lifetime of sexual abuse. As a result of that abuse she had turned to sex work and was eventually sentenced for extramarital sex to death by stoning. Amini felt compelled to write about and investigate the practice of stoning. During her investigations she found out that despite Iran's commitment to the international community to abolish the practice stoning were still going on in secret. In 2002, Iran's chief justice declared a moratorium on stoning. Amini tried to publish her story but was soon after fired from her newspaper. The editor-in-chief of her newspaper said that it was impossible for them to publish the story as she was fighting Sharia law and the Iranian judicial system. She sent the story to another newspaper but they declined. After a long search, a women's publication agreed to publish an edited version. Soon after the publishing of the story of Atefeh Amini heard of another similar story concerning the fate of Leyla, a nineteen- year old with mental age of an eight year old who was supposed to be hanged for chastity. Amini found out that the girl was still alive in a prison in Arak and decided to help her. The girl had first been put out for prostitution by her own mother at the age between five and eight. From then onward her mother prostituted her and lived from the money. Leyla gave birth to her first child at age nine and received a 100 lashes sentence for chastity for the first time. She was sentenced to death for incest among other things as her brothers had been among the townsmen who had raped her. Amini visited the judge who had sentenced Leyla and he said that the law is the law and that he was just applying it. He further stated, under Amini's account, that if the society was an apple Leyla was a worm. Amini wrote a story about Leyla in the magazine Zanan. The story echoed internationally. Even the Norwegian prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik wrote a letter to Iranian president Khatami. Eventually Leyla had a second trial. With the help of a friend of Shadi Sadr, her human rights attorney, Amini was able to have Leyla be removed from prison and put in a social organization that provided her with private lessons and helped her to learn to read and to write. In 2007 Amini was arrested and imprisoned. After this experience Amini founded the 'Stop Stoning Forever Campaign'. She fights to have to practice of stoning stopped, researches cases of women who have been sentenced to death by stoning and shares their stories with the public. After the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009 the situation of humans rights activists became dangerous in Iran. Amini's phone calls were wiretapped, her e-mail messaged were surveilled. Four months after the re-election Amini went to exile in Norway. In Norway she continued to be a contributor to a newspaper. She was also a guest writer in Trondheim City of Refuge from 2010 to 2012.  Family  At the newspaper Zan Amini met Javad Montazeri, a photographer who came from the Mazandaran region like her. After eight months they decided to get married. After giving birth to her daughter Ava her husband encouraged her to continue to work. When she became pregnant for a second time, she tried to take medicine that would induce a miscarriage, which would make it possible to go to an emergency room in a hospital and have the fetus removed. This was necessary because abortion is illegal in Iran. However, the medicine didn't work and Amini thought that she had damaged the fetus irreparably. So she proceeded to have an illegal abortion with complications but was able to return to work afterwards.

Like many of her class, she was not named and is properly referred to by her hull designation. Construction LST-23 was laid down on 27 October 1942, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by the Dravo Corporation; launched on 29 March 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Mary H. Miller. She was floated down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to the Naval Section Base, Algiers, Louisiana, in March 1943. She was commissioned on 22 May 1943 with Lieutenant John B. Swann Jr., USCGR, in command. Service history On 10 June 1943, she departed Algiers, in convoy for San Francisco, via the Panama Canal. She arrived at San Diego on 1 July 1943, and at Mare Island Navy Yard on 3 July 1943. She left San Francisco, on 17 July 1943, with the destroyer escorting her and five other LSTs for Alaskan waters. They arrived safely at the Naval Air Station, Woman's Bay, Kodiak, Alaska on 25 July 1943. The convoy and escort departed on 27 July, with an additional LST and two more escorts for Kuluk Harbor, Adak, Aleutian Islands, arriving there on 1 August 1943. Here she disembarked troops and equipment and beached to unload Army equipment. With two escorts and three other LSTs and a Navy tug she departed Kiska, on 27 August 1943, for Kuluk Harbor, Adak. On 31 August, LST-23 and five other LSTs departed Adak for San Francisco with two escorts, one of which left the group to escort LST-19, which was suffering engine trouble, back to Adak Island.

The morale of the personnel of this vessel is suffering considerable hardship and measures to remedy the situation have failed thus far. The men most affected are those aboard who have been on constant duty on this vessel since before it went into commission in May 1943. However, there are other men aboard who have been overseas up to twenty seven months and they likewise are suffering. 2\\\\. The present medical officer has been aboard in excess of four months and has been able to observe the various officers and members of the crew and to evaluate their mental condition. Some of these men have grown so irritable that they are easily excited and often are called before Captain's Mast for acts committed because of the irritability acquired from their prolonged service aboard this ship. One signalman in particular had his rate taken away from him for an act against a senior petty officer, the whole of which, it is believed, arose from the irritability and mental fatigue from their long tour of duty. 3\\\\. These men do not have opportunity for liberty for long periods of time and seeing the same faces month after month, being unable to move in more than the small confines of the ship, has made many of them tired of each other, even suspicious and afraid of one another. 4\\\\. The ship has participated in action with the enemy and has been in extreme danger on numerous occasions. Some of its personnel have been wounded by enemy action. Many of the original members of the crew as well as some of those more recently assigned have developed extreme nervousness under danger due to their repeated subjection to shellfire and nearness to explosions of bombs with no means of protection other than the projectiles from their own guns. 5\\\\. This vessel is a U.S. Navy ship staffed by U.S. Coast Guard personnel which seems to make it difficult to obtain replacement personnel. The morale of the ship falls even lower when in port for the men find that Navy ships of the same class are sending men back to the states for leave and reassignment after eighteen months, twelve months, and even shorter periods. 6\\\\. We are hopeful that the Force Surgeon may be able to take some action which will result in the relief of the immediate situation and also establish some means by which personnel may be replaced after the specified eighteen months of sea duty in order to prevent any more permanent damage to the minds and morale of these men. LT Sears letter did indeed stimulate some action. A 26 October 1944, memo to the Commandant (P), noted that 29 enlisted men were sent to LST-23 to relieve an equal number of her crew. Three officers were also sent as relief. On 5 December 1944, while returning from a supply trip, LST-23, while in North Surigao Straits, was hit a glancing blow by a plane causing a fire and extensive damage. After being repaired LST-23 moved to the Philippines to finish out her combat career participating in General Douglas MacArthur's promised liberation of the islands from the Japanese occupation in the Battle of Luzon Lingayen Gulf landings on 9 January 1945, after which she returned to San Diego, California. Departing San Diego on 17 February 1945, she proceeded to Guam via Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 2 April 1945, and returning to San Francisco on 6 May 1945. Postwar career Her next trip took her to Sasebo, Japan. Leaving Pearl Harbor on 3 September 1945, after the end of the war, she arrived in Sasebo. On 15 September 1945, she was redesignated Landing Ship, Tank (Hospital), LST(H). She departed Sasebo on 28 September for Lingayen and Manila. She left Manila on 10 October for Wakayama, Japan, via Lingayen, arriving there on 22 October. She returned to San Francisco on 2 February 1946, via Okinawa, Sasebo, Saipan, and Pearl Harbor. When she returned to the United States and was decommissioned on 24 May 1946. She was struck from the Navy list on 3 July 1946 and was sold to the Kaiser Company, Inc., Seattle, Washington, on 6 April 1948 for scrapping. Awards LST-23 earned six battle stars for her World War II service.

In a rural hill tribe in Northern Thailand, a villager smiles with stained teeth from her Betel Chew. Areca Catechu (Betel plant), Betel nut A kin mak basket The picture above shows a betel kit and the main ingredients needed for a traditional Thai chew.  Preparation  In order to chew maak the traditional Thai way, three main ingredients are needed: betel leaf, betel nut and red limestone paste. Before a betel chew, the betel nut is boiled, sliced and dried. A popular method is to cut the betel nut into four smaller sections before solar drying, since betel nut can be very strong. After the betel nuts have dried, they are normally laced on a string (usually as long as 50 cm) and hung around the house to use as needed; this is a popular method because the dried betel nut can be stored longer. Additionally, other ingredients can be added such as Plai (Zingiber Cassamunar) or Tobacco. Before chewing on betel most Thais mix all the ingredients together. Many elders (with no or weak teeth) mix and pound all the ingredients to use without it being wrapped by betel leaf.  Equipment  Chian maak is a betel kit, which consists of equipment essential for betel chewing. It comes in different shapes, sizes and material. In the past, it was a way of showing wealth and social class. Materials such as brass, silver, gold, and carved wood were popular among the rich, while peasants and common workers used baskets made from cheaper materials such as rattan. A full betel kit has the following equipment: * Mortar and pestle ‚Äì used for pounding and combining ingredients together. This is popular among older people, since their teeth are weaker. * Areca nut cutter * Storage for ingredients (betel leaf, betel quid, limestone paste, etc.) * Box for water residue‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤ ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏π ‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ï ‡∏ö‡∏π‡∏£‡∏û‡∏≤ ‡∏™‡∏ñ‡∏¥‡∏ï ‡∏†‡∏¥ ‡∏£‡∏° ‡∏à‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏£ ‡∏ú‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á.

Thai traditions and ceremonies  Maak is also plays a major role in Thai traditions and ceremonies such as: * Life prolonging ceremony: There is a belief amongst Thais that maak can prolong life; this is done by taking a small betel tree and casting spells on it before planting it at a temple or a public area. * ‡∏Ç‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏±‡πâ‡∏á/‡∏Ç‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏π (Kan Tung/ Kan Kru): Kan tung is a decorated tray that consists of maak and other offerings in a ceremony where students show respect and gratitude toward teachers from both past and present. * Buddhist rituals: Maak is used as an offering for spirit houses, and used during ordination of Buddhist monks. Only leaves from male betel palm are used in Buddhist offerings. * \\"Kan maak\\" (Wedding ceremony): According to Thai tradition, a couple becomes engaged during a ceremony called \\"Kan maak\\" which is held during a wedding.

Tradition  Maak chewing has been a part of Thai tradition since the kingdom of Sukhothai (1238‚Äì1583). During the Lanna kingdom (1292), maak chewing was used as a form of flirting among the younger men and women. The red/brown stains on the teeth of those who chewed maak were considered beautiful. Other uses of the maak tree include the following. A common use of a maak tree is to use the branch for children to play with. A popular game is called ‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏Å (chuk lark), meaning pull and drag. This is a game where one person pulls on one end while another sits down on the wide end of the branch. The branch of a maak tree is strong; therefore people would use it for a hand fan. Another important use of the maak tree is to wrap food‚Äîsuch as rice. The tree branch is also used as an insulator to keep the moisture and warmth within the food. Additionally, the soft layer of the branch is also used to roll tobacco. Finally, Maak is also used as natural medicine among Thais. It is used to cure coughing, a sore throat or a rash.  Declining trend  Plaek Phibunsongkhram, a former prime minister of Thailand promoted a campaign in 1940 to encourage citizens to quit the habit of chewing betel quid. He also ordered to cut down all the maak trees throughout the country. Maak chewing was also banned in government buildings. This started an anti-betel chewing trend; those who chewed Maak in government buildings were declined services from the government. This was to promote modern society and clean up the city because the people would spit red residue out onto the streets, which stained the cities and roads which was seen as dirty and unhygienic.‡∏ç‡∏≤ ‡πÄ‡∏£ ‡∏® ‡∏≠‡∏±‡∏Ñ‡∏£ ‡∏û‡∏±‡∏í‡∏ô‡∏≤ ‡∏ô‡∏∏ ‡∏Å‡∏π‡∏•.

A detailed case study by Reichard et al. was made in 1979-84 of several hill tribes in northern Thailand to study about habits of betel chewing in Thailand. The study suggested a preference ranging from 5-44% men and 9-46% women chewed maak. Very few villagers below the age of 35 participated in the chewing of betel quid, which was once a universal custom among Thais. This showed that betel quid chewing in Thailand was dramatically decreasing, which made it is the only country in Southeast Asia to record such a trend. Maak chewing in big cities like Bangkok and Chiang Mai has almost completely vanished, although in rural provinces, betel chewing is still popular amongst elders.

The board consists of 11 Board members. The Government reconstituted the Board in March 2000. The Board plays a pro-active role by encouraging enterprises to take up technology-oriented products. The board provides equity capital or loans to industrial concerns and financial assistance to research and development institutions. The loans carry a simple interest rate of 5% per annum.  GITA  In order to stimulate private sector's investment in R&D;, TDB established Global Innovation & Technology Alliance (GITA) as a Section 25 company in a joint venture between Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and TDB with an equity contribution of 51:49 respectively. The GITA will assist Department of Science & Technology (DST) in implementing industrial research and development programme with different countries under bilateral and multilateral science and technology cooperation agreements. In these country-specific programmes, if one industry from India and one industry from another country proposed jointly to do R&D; for developing a marketable product, both the governments will provide financial support up to 50% of project cost to their respective industries. The GITA has been envisaged as an industry-driven body for supporting competitive innovation clusters which in future can be entrusted with administering of Innovation Fund under a PPP model, IP acquisition by the government for non-exclusive licensing for public and social good, sectors of R&D; and promotion of innovation culture in centres of excellence.  Venture capital funds  In India, UTI was the first company to start venture scheme under the name of India Technology Venture Scheme in 1997. In 1999 UTI's executive trustee met the then chairperson, TDB and secretary, TDB and requested TDB's participation in venture capital fund. The board in its 13th meeting dated 19 November 1999 approved TDB's participation in UTI-India Technology Venture Unit Scheme (ITVUS) with a commitment of Rs. 25 Cr. This was the first commitment by TDB in any venture capital fund, and the agreement for this was signed on 6 July 2000. Thereafter on a case-by-case basis, TDB' board took the decision to participate in the different venture funds (as given in the list as annexure) as limited liability partner. So far TDB has been participating in venture funds which are mainly concentrated in technology orientation, early-stage projects and also on investment in state- level funds where TDB's presence was inadequate. The initiative of TDB has also given the confidence to venture capitalist/private equity funds to come up in a big way to support the technology-based projects with a pronounced emphasis on sectors witch which are growth drivers of Indian economy. The TDB has so far supported 12 venture capital funds with a total commitment of Rs. 310 Cr. leveraging total funds aggregating to Rs. 2713 Cr. from other investors.  National awards  The board instituted a national award for successful commercialization of indigenous technology by an industrial concern. The national award of Rs. 10 Lakhs is shared equally between the industrial concern that has successfully commercialized the indigenous technology and the developer/provider of such technology. In August 2000, TDB introduced a cash award of Rs. 2 lakh and a trophy to an SSI unit that has successfully commercialized a technology-based product. The first SSI award was given on 11 May 2001 and thereafter it has been decided to give the Award for SSI Unit every year on the Occasion of Technology Day, i.e. 11 May. The cash awards were later revised to Rs. 5 lakh in 2011‚Äì2012.

He was born at Belgaum in India and died at Hastings in Sussex. Late in life he added the name \\"Mackenzie\\" to his surname, as his father had also done. Shaw was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He matriculated at Cambridge University in the autumn of 1872 and appeared in trial matches for the university cricket team in both 1873 and 1874, without being selected for any first-class matches. In 1875, he fared better and was picked as a right-handed lower-order batsman and a left-arm fast bowler in the round-arm style for three Cambridge first-class matches, but with little success: he had been discarded from the Cambridge team long before the 1875 University Match, for which he was not selected. He had much greater success at the end of the 1875 season in a few games for Kent, however. Kent's game against Lancashire finished with Lancashire being set just 18 to win in their second innings; Shaw opened the bowling and took four wickets for 11 runs, the best bowling figures of his first-class career, so that Lancashire won, but only by a margin of five wickets. In the next game he hit 54 when opening the batting against the weak Hampshire side. The 1876 season saw Shaw as a regular member of the Cambridge University side, employed as a lower-order batsman and a change bowler used as economical relief to the main bowling attack. He played in the 1876 University Match against Oxford University, bowling in each Oxford innings, though failing to take a wicket, and scoring 0 in his only batting innings; Cambridge, however, won the match by nine wickets. Playing for Kent later in the same season and opening the batting once more, he made a score of 74 against Surrey which was his highest first-class score. Shaw graduated from Cambridge with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1876. He continued to play first-class cricket in occasional games for Kent in 1877 and 1878, but with little success. He became chief of the Clan Shaw of Tordarroch, sometimes called \\"Clan Ay\\", changed his name to \\"Shaw-Mackenzie\\" as his father had also done, and became a Justice of the Peace in Ross and Cromarty. He did not marry, and was succeeded as clan chief by his brother.

The episode was written by Michael Golamco, and was directed by John Behring. Plot Opening quote: \\"Du√©rmete ni√±o, du√©rmete ya... Que viene el Coco y te comer√°.\\" (\\"Sleep child, sleep now... Or else the Bogeyman will come and eat you.\\") Two weeks ago, a man named Andres Venegas (Garrett Hammond) is attacked in a gas station by two robbers, who severely wound him. In the hospital, his mother watches over him and makes a plea so the robbers don't get away and get punished for their actions. In a motel, a clawed creature watches the news reporting the attack and scratches the chair it‚Äôs sitting on. Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) has found out about the known \\"M\\" in Nick's (David Giuntoli) email and confronts him about it. He tells her it's his mother and then explains everything about her and although the email shows that she's in trouble, he can't do anything to help her. Juliette later tracks the call to Vi≈°nja Gora, Slovenia. In Vienna, Sebastien (Christian Lagadec) spies on Adalind (Claire Coffee) getting an ultrasound and sends Meisner (Damien Puckler) to get her medical records in secret and then sends the images to Renard (Sasha Roiz), shocking him. The same robbers attack a store and when trying to escape in a car, are killed by the clawed creature. Nick and Hank (Russell Hornsby) find that they robbed a store so they head there where a man named David Florez (Manny Montana) yells at them for not doing their job. The neighbourhood heard the attack but calls it a dog attack. Upon questioning witnesses, they find a man named Ray Bolton (Matt McTighe) who uses his dogs for fights. It's also revealed that the robbers were in collaboration with Bolton. Nick and Hank arrive at Bolton's house where he is restrained to let his dogs be taken. When he senses that Nick is a Grimm, Bolton attacks him, forcing Nick to arrest him while Florez again appears to state that it was time he got arrested. In the precinct, the samples reveal that the dogs were not related to the murders. While at dinner with Juliette, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner), Nick deduces that Bolton is a H√∂llentier, as he showed no fear of him. A woman, Ms. Ramos (Fernanda Stier) is then assaulted in the street by a man but the clawed creature kills the man and leaves. When questioning the woman, she states \\"El Cucuy\\" is the one who killed the men. That night, Juliette tells Nick that \\"El Cucuy\\" is a Mexican Boogeyman. Nick and Juliette then asks Pilar (Bertila Damas) about it. She explains it's a yellow-eyed creature that hears the cries of a woman but is not clear if it's a Wesen. New footage reveals that another person left with Ms. Ramos: Ms. Garcia (Gina Gallego), one of the witnesses. Bolton and his gang attack Florez and Florez returns to his house to grab his military uniform and a knife and leaves. Nick and Hank take Ms. Garcia but stop to halt the fight between Florez and Bolton. Nick and Hank take Florez but Ms. Garcia is missing. El Cucuy kills Bolton and shifts to its human form, revealing to be Ms. Garcia, who senses that Nick is a Grimm. They arrest her but due to the credibility of the story, she is released. She is later seen in Seattle where a man robs her purse and she begins to shift into El Cucuy to pursue him.

'El Cucuy' doesn't have much significance to the larger arc of the show ‚Äî except for the very brief interludes with Adalind's first ultrasound and Renard receiving video evidence of the baby ‚Äî but what makes it so fun is how differently the case plays out when compared to the regular structure.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.9 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"Justice comes in many different forms. For Grimm Season 3 Episode 5 justice is best served by El Cucuy, a nomadic, old lady roaming the world listening to the pleas of the disenfranchised. Serving out justice by brutally slashing some throats. So it's not quite the DC or Marvel origin story, but it's not lacking in flair.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"While 'El Cucuy' didn't quite continue the 'old world vs. new world' thing that Grimm has had going on this season, the episode did feature some nice line-blurring between right and wrong, justice and vengeance. You can't really deny that El Cucuy's victims were all raging dickbags who kind of deserved what they got, but at the same time, society tends to frown upon a vigilante. Unless, of course, you're Batman ‚Äî but even that's not guaranteed, depending on what flavor of Batman we're talking about.\\" References External links  Grimm (season 3) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"El Cucuy (Grimm)"},{"id":"51348199","title":"Dave Khodabux"},{"id":"51348201","text":"Hippolyte Auger, born Hippolyte Aug√©, 25 May 1796 in Auxerre and died 5 January 1881 in Menton, was a French writer, Russian translator, and editor of the Journal de Saint P√©tersbourg.  Biography  Born one of eleven children,Tolley, Bruce A Saint-Simonian writer: Hippolyte Auger (1797-1881), Australian Journal of French Studies, Vol 11, Issue 3 in 1810, at the age of fourteen, Hippolyte Auger left his Bourgogne home, with the consent of his parents, to work to Paris. He found employment in a fabric shop owned by the famous textile magnate Ternaux. His teenage charm was employed mostly on men, including Russian soldiers who were present in Paris following the abdication of Napoleon in 1814. Having struck up friendships with four, who like him were devotees of the theatre, at the age of eighteen Auger joined the army of Alexander I, and followed it back to Russia, virtually officer by officer. He served eighteen months. In St Petersburg, Auger befriended the aristocrat Filipp Vigel, a famous Russian memoirist and friend of Pushkin. Vigel supported Auger for most of his life and enabled him to get to know the imperial family and senior Russian nobility. With the return of Napoleon, Auger's position as a Frenchman in society became awkward, and following Vigel's advice he left St Petersburg. In VilnaBarratt,G. R. The Catholicism of Mikhail Sergeyevich Lunin, The Slavonic and East European Review, Vol. 49, No. 115 (Apr., 1971), pp. 255-271 he met a dashing, aristocratic but reckless 26 year old Chevalier Guard officer Michael Lunin (1787-1845), later famous as a political philosopher, revolutionary, and Decembrist. For Auger it was love at first sight. As he later wrote in his memoirs: \\"the soft look, playful mouth, quick animation, imperturable manner offered, depending on the case, whatever you were looking for.\\"M√©moires d'Auger (1810-1859, Paul Cottin, Aux Bureaux de la Revue R√©trospective, 1891, p76 Lunin wanted to distance himself from his father, and in 1816 they decided to head to South America to join Bolivar's Liberadores. They only got as far as Paris, where they shared a tiny garret, Lunin penning a novel about \\"False\\" Dmitri, a 17th-century pretender to the Russian throne who may have been gay, while Auger introduced him to Jesuits, Saint-Simonians, and theatre acquaintances. After more than a year in France, Lunin, returned to Russia to inherit the fortune of his father and a political role. Obliged to earn a living, and having taken his first steps as an author in Russia, Auger remained in Paris. As well as writing articles for the Paris journals, he tried his hand as a playwright, and achieved several successes. In 1820 he met a wealthy Scottish diplomat, William Drummond of Logiealmond, a former ambassador to the courts of Constantinople and Naples. He became his secretary, assisting him with literary and archeological work in both England and Italy. Back in France, in 1827 Auger befriended the Saint-Simonians Hippolyte Carnot and Philippe Buchez and took an active part in their conferences. He was also a friend and collaborator with, Ancelot, Balzac, Constant, Dumus, and other writers of the period. From 1837 wrote a number of novels, and in 1839 the three volume Physiologie du th√©√¢tre into which he poured his deep knowledge of the contemporary stage. In the 1840s Auger chose to return to Russia for a writing project supported by the Tsar, a refutation of the famous work of Marquis de Custine, Russia in 1839. After the scandal of Custine's book had subsided, the Tsar decided it was best not to remind the public of it, and the project was abandoned, but Auger remained some time in St. Petersburg. In 1844 he published a novel Fernande under the name of Alexandre Dumas, which went through seven editions. Auger passed the last years of his life in Paris, and on the French Riviera. In Toulon, he befriended the Justice of the Peace and bibliophile Alexandre Mouttet (1814-1901), who encouraged him to publish his memoirs. Published posthumously in 1891 as M√©moires d'Auger (1810-1859, they were of remarkable frankness; his exploits confirming the presence of his name on the register of homosexuals then maintained by the Paris police.Registre des p√©d√©rastes de la Pr√©fecture de police de Paris. BB4, f¬∞ 39. While Auger was a writer of some celebrity during his lifetime, he has fallen into almost complete obscurity.  Character  As his memoirs confirm, Auger had a talent for making friends everywhere, but he could also be tactless, and the majority of his friendships appear to have ended in quarrels and rupture. His life was one of constant movement as he seemed unable to settle anywhere, or form stable relationships. It has been suggested that his was just the type of personality to be attracted to Messianic all-embracing doctrines like Saint-Simonianism. No other follower wrote as much as he did or so enthusiastically applied its ideology to artistic questions.

The team came about after a collaboration between local clubs Tralee Imperials and St. Brendan's. Tralee's return to National League basketball, having previously hosted a team called Tralee Tigers, brought with it one of Ireland's best known basketball players, Kieran Donaghy. Donaghy, a dual Gaelic footballer and basketball player, played for St. Brendan's in 2015‚Äì16 and was a big part of Tralee Tigers in the early 2000s. Originally set up as Tralee Town BC, the club was officially named Tralee Warriors Basketball Club, with their crest and colours being launched in July 2016. On 23 September 2016, Tralee Warriors made their debut in the Super League with a 92‚Äì77 loss to UCC Demons. Croatian forward Dusan Bogdanovic led the way for Tralee with 16 points, while Kieran Donaghy managed 15 points in his first Super League game since 2009.

Biography  From 1966 to 1971 Smit was a researcher and later head of research at the Africa Institute of South Africa. At the request of the South African Government he and Prof G.M. Leistner conducted a feasibility study on moving Malawi's capital to Lilongwe. In 1972 he was appointed professor and head of the department of geography at University of South Africa. Smit served as senior deputy president at the Human Sciences Research Council before being appointed as Vice Chancellor and Principal of the University of Pretoria in 1992. After a term of five years he returned to his research in demography and retired in 2000. He is the author or co-author of six books and more than 120 articles published in scientific journals.  Education  Smit was awarded his Masters in Geography from the University of Stellenbosch in 1961, and his Ph.D. from the University of South Africa in 1965.  Research  Smit's most important research contributions were in the field of demographics. He worked on population migration, specifically on the urbanisation of the black population in South Africa. The research results served as guidelines for socio-political planning by the government and private institutions, but as far back as the early eighties, provided scientific proof that separate development (apartheid), as applied by the government of the day, was not sustainable. His knowledge of demographics also enabled Smit to play an important role in establishing the nine provinces of South Africa and the drawing of their boundaries in 1993. In addition to research in demography he also undertook research on higher education.  Awards and accolades  Among Smit's many accolades are the Percy Fox Foundation Award for outstanding contributions in the field of migration, urbanisation and housing; the Vice Chancellor's medal for outstanding contributions to the University of Pretoria and a medal as one of the University's 100 leading minds; and honorary doctorates from the University of Pretoria, the University of Stellenbosch and the Moscow Business University.

Both are described as the disciples of another mahasiddha, Kanhapa (Krishnacharya). They are said to have severed their heads and offered them to their guru, and then danced headless. Their legend is closely associated with the Buddhist severed-headed goddess Chinnamunda.  Legend  The Legends of the Eighty-four Mahasiddhas (, written by the Tibetan monk Mondup Sherab, which was narrated to him by Abhayadattashri c. 12th century) narrates the following tale: Mekhala and Kanakhala were daughters of a householder in Devƒ´ko·π≠·π≠a (now in Bengal), who married them to sons of a boatman. Their husbands taunted them and their neighbours gossiped about them. Finally, Kanakhala could not take the abuse any more and suggested Mekhala that they should flee from their house. However, the wise Mekhala told her younger sister that they deserved it and would have to face the same torment somewhere else if they run away; they stay and bear the agony. The mahasiddha guru Kanhapa passed by their house with his retinue of 700 dakas and dakinis. The sisters prostrated to the guru and explained their anguish. Kanhapa instructed them in the sƒÅdhanƒÅ (spiritual practice) of the goddess VajravƒÅrƒÅhƒ´, a ferocious form of Vajrayogini. The sisters practised the meditative techniques for 12 years and accomplished their goal. The sisters journeyed to meet their guru to seek further instruction. They bowed to him and circumambulated him in reverence, however the daka failed to recognize them. They introduced themselves as the married unhappy sisters he had initiated twelve years ago. He responded that if he was their guru, they should have brought him offerings. The sisters asked him his desired offerings. The guru promptly asked for their heads. The sisters unquestioningly decapitated themselves and offered their severed heads at his feet. Their bodies danced as their severed heads sang reverently. The guru rejoined their heads and torsos. They were known as the \\"Headless Yoginis\\" henceforth. By this act, they acquired mahamudra-siddhi (supernatural magical powers) and became mahasiddhas. After serving the beings of the world for several years, they bodily assumed Khechara, the Paradise of dakinis governed by Vajrayogini. = Association with Chinnamunda = The goddess Chinnamunda is associated with the legend of Mekhala and Kanakhala. The legend of the sisters is associated with Chinnamunda or Sarvabuddha-dakini, the severed headed form of the goddess Vajrayogini or her form Vajravarahi. The nude self- decapitated goddess, standing in a fighting posture, holds her own severed head in one hand, a knife in another. Three jets of blood spurt out of her bleeding neck and are drunk by her severed head and two dakini attendants, Vajravaironi and Vajravarnini. The attendants hold a skull and a knife. This form is almost identical to the Hindu goddess Chhinnamasta, who is standing on a copulating couple. Taranatha (1575‚Äì1634) in his Historical Works - Kahna pa 'i mam char (a biography of Kanhapa) describes the life of some of his disciples including Mekhala and Kanakhala. The sisters lived in south of Maharashtra. When Mekhala and Kanakhala when 10 and 8 years old respectively, they were betrothed to young Brahmin boys, however were not married to them after they reached puberty and finally their marriages broke. Their neighbours gossiped about the same. The sisters surrendered to Kanhapa, who had arrived in the region then. Kanhapa considered them fit disciples and trained them. They remained with his entourage for a few days. Kanhapa taught them the sadhana of Vajravarahi and sent them to a forest to practise in solitude. They attained many siddhis. Once, they encountered yogi disciples of Gorakhnath, who mocked them as disciples of Kanhapa and asked them to show a magic trick. The sisters with their powers moved the house of Gorakhnath's disciples to an arid desert from the picturesque setting it was at previously. Repentant, the yogis begged for forgiveness; the sisters relented and restored their dwelling to its former location. After 12 years, the sisters sought to meet their guru. They found Kanhapa in Bengal, however the guru failed to recollect his meeting with them. Upon his request, the sisters drew swords of wisdom from their mouths and severed their heads and offered them to Kanhapa. The headless sisters danced rising upward in the sky and disappeared in a rainbow light. The self-decapitation of Mekhala and Kanakhala started a dangerous trend of self-decapitation by dakinis. Ultimately, the goddess VajravƒÅrƒÅhƒ´ herself appeared in this form as Chinnamunda and danced with the dakinis to stop further head-chopping.  Iconography  Mekhala and Kanakhala are depicted with swords held above their heads or dancing with them. They may be also depicted in the act of decapitation. Mekhala and Kanakhala may be depicted nude or topless. In combined portrayals, Mekhala is on the left. Both wears various gold ornaments and a tiara-like headgear. Mekhala holds a skull-cup in her left hand, while she draws the sword from her mouth with her right hand or simply holds a sword or a kartika knife. A skull-staff is supported in the crook of her left arm. Kanakhala holds her own severed head in her left hand and a sword or a kartika in her right. Kanakhala's head may be intact over her neck or she may be beheaded. In combined portrayals of the dancing sisters, Kanhapa may be depicted with one of sisters' head by his side; the sisters may not be beheaded in the portrayal. In a painting, where Kanakala is depicted headless, three streams of blood gush from her neck. One stream of blood is drunk by Kanakhala's head in her hand; the others are collected in the skull- cups of Mekhala and Kanhapa. Combined images  Mekhala  * Kanakhala  *  Dating  Mekhala and Kanakhala are dated to the late ninth century based on the dating of their guru Krishnacharya, identified with Kanhapa.

He was North Korea's deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom, prior to defecting with his family to South Korea in 2016. Thae has been variously described as the highest-ranking North Korean official to defect, and the highest-ranking North Korean defector since the 1997 defection of juche ideologist Hwang Jang-yop.Lester Holt & Alexander Smith, North Korean Defector Tells Lester Holt 'World Should be Ready', NBC News (3 April 2017). In August 2016, the South Korean government confirmed that Thae and his family were under their protection. Thae was elected to the National Assembly in the 2020 South Korean legislative election as a member of the United Future Party. Biography =Pre defection= Thae studied abroad in China at a young age, learning English. He went on to study at the Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies. Thae began working in the 1980s. Thae is married to O Hye-son (), a relative of Kim Il-sung's comrade in arms during the 1930s, . They have two sons. Their older son is a graduate of a British university, and their younger son, who was born in Denmark, when Thae was serving as a diplomat there, was studying at a London school. The younger son had recently been offered a place to study computer science at Imperial College London. However, the family had been recalled to Pyongyang just before Thae's defection. Thae was able to escape with his wife and children, but his brother and sister were left behind in North Korea. Thae stated after his defection that \\"I'm sure that my relatives and my brothers and sisters are either sent to remote, closed areas or to prison camps, and that really breaks my heart.\\"People will rise against N Korean regime, says defector, BBC News (25 January 2017).Thae Yong-ho: Interview with a North Korean defector Al Jazeera, 101 East, 4 May 2017. According to BBC reports, Thae is convivial, and enjoys Indian food, playing golf and tennis. In addition to Korean and English, he speaks fluent Mandarin. In 2015, he escorted Kim Jong-chul, the older brother of Kim Jong-un, to an Eric Clapton concert in London. During his time in London, he lived in a two- bedroom flat in West London. Thae stated that he defected as he did not want his children who were used to a life of freedom in Britain to live a life of oppression in North Korea.The Incredible Guts of Thae Yong-ho, National Review, July 8, 2019 Thae was one of North Korea's elite, regarded by observers as a sophisticated diplomat who was one of the \\"best and brightest\\" in the country. Following Thae's defection, the North Korean government denounced him as \\"human scum,\\" accused him without evidence of crimes including embezzlement and child rape, and unsuccessfully petitioned Britain to extradite him to North Korea for trial. =Life after defection= Since his defection, Thae has given many talks and interviews about North Korea's secretive, authoritarian, and violent government. Citing the killings of Kim Jong-nam and Jang Song-thaek, Thae believes that he is likely a target for assassination by Kim Jong-un due to his defection and outspokenness. In an interview in January 2017, Thae stated that the United Nations sanctions on North Korea were hurting the Kim regime, and that it is under significant pressure. In another interview the same month, Thae said, \\"I am very determined to do everything possible to pull down the regime to save not only my family members but also the whole North Korean people from slavery.\\" Thae believes that \\"Kim Jong-un's regime one day will collapse by a people's uprising.\\"Thae Yong-ho: Interview with a North Korean defector Al Jazeera, 101 East, May 4, 2017 In an interview in April 2017, Thae stated that Kim was \\"desperate in maintaining his rule\\" and was relying heavily on its development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles to deter an external attack and preserve his grip on power. Thae worked as an adviser at the Institute for National Security Strategy since early 2017, an organization affiliated with the National Intelligence Service, and he resigned from the job out of personal will in May 2018. He makes videos for the website Daily NK. Thae testified before the US House Foreign Relations Committee in November 2017. Thae advised the use of soft power, such as disseminating outside information, to weaken Kim Jong-un's rule.Thae Yong-ho Prepared Testimony, U.S. House Committee on Foreign Relations (1 November 2017).North Korea defector urges US to use soft power. BBC New (2 November 2017). He stated that the North Korean regime wants nuclear weapons in order to intimidate the U.S. into withdrawing its military forces from South Korea, thus weakening South Korea. He also equated the North Korean regime to that of apartheid-era South Africa and Nazi Germany. In May 2018, Thae published Cryptography From the Third-Floor Secretariat (), a memoir of his life as a North Korean diplomat. The book became a bestseller in South Korea. 10,000 copies of the first print run were sold in four days. It is a rare example of a book written by a North Korean defector becoming a bestseller in South Korea. The memoir was described by Andrei Lankov as \\"a remarkably balanced and unbiased text\\" and it \\"writes about the North Korean system in a slightly detached way, describing how things are done but never going into a righteous frenzy of moralistic outrage\\". In February 2020, Thae ran for a seat representing the Gangnam District of Seoul in the National Assembly in South Korea's parliamentary elections in April 2020. During his campaign, Thae ran under the pseudonym Tae Ku-min (ÌÉúÍµ¨ÎØº), Ku-min meaning \\"saving the people [of North Korea]\\". Despite initially facing skepticism regarding his campaign and having no connection to the Gangnam District, Thae easily beat his opponent, becoming the first North Korean defector to win a National Assembly seat through a constituency vote. In May 2020, Thae apologised for claiming Kim Jong-un was probably so ill he could not stand during a three week period when Kim was not seen in public. The Democratic Party criticised Thae for carelessness, with some members urging that Thae should be excluded from the intelligence and defence committees.

Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1990 It was first proposed in an issue of Gorn, publication of Proletkult, during the First Congress of the Communist International, March 1919, but practical steps were only taken during the Second Congress of the Communist International.  Provisional International Bureau  This was set up on 12 August 1920 following the Comintern Congress. The president was Anatoly Lunacharsky and the General Secretary Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii. The Bureau included several international delegates: * Wilhelm Herzog and Max Barthel (Germany) * John Reed (USA) * Tom Quelch and William McLaine (Great Britain) * Karl Toman (Austria) * War Van Overstraeten (Belgium) * Raymond Lefebvre (France) * Nicola Bombacci (Italy) * Haavard Langseth (Norway) * Walther Bringolf and Jules Humbert-Droz (Switzerland).  Criticism  Leo Pasvolsky was one of the first people to criticise the formation of Kultintern. First he portrayed the movement as generally exhibiting a heavy monotony with poetry which was both facile and pretentious. However he further claimed that the foundation of Kultintern would reduce the Proletkult movement \\"not primarily, but exclusively\\" to a weapon to promote the Bolshevik view of communism.

The scandal precipitated the dramatic arrest of OCI president Pat Hickey, while in a hotel room assigned to his son. Hickey immediately resigned, as well as relinquishing his membership of the International Olympic Committee, his role as president of the European Olympic Committees and his role as vice-president of the Association of National Olympic Committees. Others implicated in the scandal include Football Association of Ireland (FAI) chief executive John Delaney, who is also OCI vice-president and a prominent figure in Irish sport, as well as Team Ireland Chef de Mission Kevin Kilty and Hickey's replacement as OCI president, Willie O'Brien. First arrests On 5 August, the day of the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, police in Rio de Janeiro arrested two people for attempted illegal resale of hundreds of tickets allocated to the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI). One of the two, Kevin Mallon, was an executive with THG Sports, which was the OCI's authorised ticket reseller (ATR) in 2012 but not 2016; the OCI denied any involvement. Pro 10 Sports Management, the OCI's 2016 ATR, said the man arrested was working as their agent to distribute tickets which had been paid for legitimately. Arrest of Hickey On 17 August, Pat Hickey, the OCI president, was arrested in Rio in connection with the investigation. A Brazilian judge remanded him in custody after concluding Hickey was a flight risk, and citing previous experience of then THG CEO James Sinton being investigated in relation to a 2014 FIFA World Cup ticket scam, being granted bail, leaving Brazil and never returning to face justice. Hickey was charged with three crimes. On 18 August, Hickey resigned as President of the OCI and that role passed to Willie O'Brien; Hickey also resigned his membership of the International Olympic Committee, his role as president of the European Olympic Committees and his role as vice- president of the Association of National Olympic Committees. At a news conference that afternoon, police presented Hickey's passport, Olympic credentials and air ticket to the world's media and explained that Rio's Civil Police Fraud Unit had arrested Hickey at about 6 a.m. (10 a.m. in Ireland). Having initially been told by his wife that her husband had returned to Ireland, Hickey was discovered in a separate hotel room assigned to his son and taken into custody. He was later photographed being wheeled from a hospital after complaining about his health and being given the all-clear by medical staff. On 20 August, Hickey and Mallon were reported to be sharing a prison cell. The same day, Brazilian police were reported to be investigating bank accounts linked to Hickey and others, stated their belief that a \\"relationship\\" exists between Hickey and English businessman Marcus Evans (owner of THG Sports) and told of an attempt being made to profit by millions of euro. Meanwhile, former Irish sports minister Leo Varadkar revealed Hickey tried to get financial assistance from Ireland's government for his son's corporate hospitality venue at London's 2012 Summer Olympics. On August 24, 2016, Rio Police presented details of emails between Marcus Evans of THG and Hickey discussing the sale of tickets for the 2016 Rio Olympics. {http://www.thejournal.ie/oci-tickets-rio-police-2942881-Aug2016/ Rio police publish emails between Pat Hickey and THG discussing sale of Ireland's Olympics tickets =Charges and suspension of case= Hickey was due to face trial in Brazil over his alleged role in the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI) ticketing affair after a Rio de Janeiro judge accepted the charges made by a public prosecutor against him and nine others. Public prosecutor Marcos Kac charged Hickey and nine others with ticket-touting, ambush marketing, theft, tax evasion, money-laundering and criminal association. Hickey was allowed his passport back in November 2016 for a bond payment of 410,000 Euros. The month after The Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) loaned the money to Hickey so he could go back to Ireland. But in November 2017, the Brazilian Supreme Court suspended the case against Hickey and the other accused, all of whom deny any wrongdoing, in order to examine the merits of the prosecution case and of the Habeas Corpus request by lawyers for one of his co-accused, Kevin Mallon of THG Sports, after the lawyers had argued that they could not mount a proper defence as the prosecution had presented no evidence, and \\"nor was there clarity on his alleged involvement in any crime\\". It was not known how long this would take, and this was still unclear in June 2019 when Olympic Federation of Ireland President Sarah Keane expressed the hope that the International Olympic Committee's Ethics Commission would conclude its own investigation of the case before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In the meantime Hickey and others had been criticised for lack of cooperation by the subsequent Moran inquiry into the matter. Role of Shane Ross Before Hickey's arrest, Irish Minister for Sport Shane Ross promised a \\"robust inquiry\\" of his own, after expressing concern at the lack of an independent investigation. On 14 August, Ross flew to Rio de Janeiro to meet with Hickey. He did so twice, \\"in tense circumstances\\" shortly before Hickey's arrest. Ross attempted to have Hickey permit an independent member be included on the OCI's inquiry. Following Hickey's arrest, Ross flew back in Dublin to meet Attorney General M√°ire Whelan. Meanwhile, Brazilian police revealed an email they found on Hickey's phone calling for Ross to be \\"put back into his box\\". John Delaney, et al. On 21 August, Brazilian police conducted an early morning raid at the Irish office in the Olympic village. They confiscated the passports of three OCI members; Team Ireland Chef de Mission Kevin Kilty, Dermot Henihen and OCI chief executive Stephen Martin. They also confiscated electronic equipment and unused Olympic tickets. The other names on the warrant included OCI officials Linda O'Reilly and Willie O'Brien, the man who had earlier replaced Hickey as president. Brazilian police were also given permission to seize a sixth passport, that of Football Association of Ireland (FAI) chief executive John Delaney, who is also OCI vice-president and a prominent figure in Irish sport.

History  Liberalization of the retail banking markets in the USA during the 1980s and early 1990s, resulted in depository institutions losing their monopoly on ATMs while independent ATM deployers were allowed to compete in the provision of after-hours access to cash. Growth in this market led Tom Harper and Alan Fryrear to establish the ATM Owners‚Äô Association (ATMOA) in late 1997 with no staff (except Harper), zero budget, and only a handful of members. The first official ATMOA planning meeting took place on October 9, 1998, at the end of the Faulkner & Gray Advanced ATM Conference in San Diego, CA. The group voted Lyle Elias as the new president, ratified a motion to change their name to the ATM Industry Association, formed several committees and took steps to launch their own industry conference. In 2000, Michael Lee joined ATMIA as their European executive director and in 2004, he was named chief executive officer and board member. Progress in bringing industry participants together resulted in the New York Times identifying ATMIA as \\"the leading trade group\\" in the global cash distribution industry in 2003. In 2016, ATMIA had over 8,000 members in 66 countries. The membership base included banks and other depository institutions, IADs, payment card companies, cash management service companies, interbank network companies, ATM design and manufacturing companies, and other related service providers.  Impact  Official Global Pictogram for the ATM, 2001 (Registered as international public sign in 2008) ATMIA provides a forum for common issues among members. These include technical matters such as coordinating the global adoption of operating systems, promoting industry specific networking tools, advising on security of transactions, setting common standards to give access to people with disabilities, and the future of the ATM. It also promoted a worldwide standard for ATM security and in collaboration with Accenture, a global ATM benchmarking service. It was responsible for designing a recognizable worldwide ‚ÄúATM here‚Äù sign, based on an international contest won by Andy Kitt, formerly of the NCR Corporation. The \\"Official Global Pictogram for the ATM\\", was then registered as an international public sign in 2008 (ISO 7001:PI CF 005).https://www.iso.org/obp/ui#iso:grs:7001:PI_CF_005 It has worked with James Shepherd-Barron in humanitarian efforts to facilitate the provision of cash and the extended use of mobile ATMs to victims of disasters and political conflict. ATMIA members and directors collaborate to address issues of global concern such as the ATM ram raids in Australia in 2010, and in 2012 around money laundering regulations, including a framework for non- bank ATMs in Canada. In the United States, ATMIA joined an industry coalition to eradicate external fee stickers on ATMs. ATMIA represents its membership in front of financial authorities and regulators . and also approaches legislators directly This includes the provision of cash services for those in the lower income brackets and other vulnerable consumers. These actions have included studies on worldwide use of banknotes and coins.

Built in 1840, it is an important local reminder of the town's industrial past, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. It presently houses a restaurant, a public market, a co-working space and four lodging units. Description and history The former Frog Hollow Stone Mill stands on the south bank of Otter Creek, at a point where the normally north-flowing river bends to the west. The mill is located a short way west of downtown Middlebury. The building is four stories in height, and is built out of locally quarried stone laid in irregular courses. It is covered by a gabled roof. The main facade, facing south toward Mill Street, is symmetrical, with recessed loading bay entrances at the center of each level, flanked on each side by sash windows. A loading boom projects above the top level in the gable. The interior of the building, including some of its internal structural elements, reflect alterations due primarily to a history of fires with which it was plagued. with Industrial use of the mill site began early in Middlebury's history, with a grist mill built there in 1789. In 1812, the mill was converted to cotton textile production, and in 1835 the Middlebury Manufacturing Company was founded. The present building was erected in 1840, and underwent a number of ownership changes, fires, and other alterations into the 20th century. It was acquired by the town in the early 1970s, and is now a student art space for Middlebury College.

The party campaigned satirically for election to the Imperial Council (Austria). Due to their dual nature as both a political \\"party\\" and a political-artistic \\"action group\\", it is often extremely difficult to differentiate the reality from the fiction of the SMPVMZ. alt=\\"Czech Election slogan reading: Every voter receives a free pocket aquarium!\\" History Party leader Jaroslav Ha≈°ek =Founding= According to the statements of the party leader Ha≈°ek, the party was founded in 1904 in the restaurant 'The Golden Liter' (Czech: Zlat√Ω litr) in Prague's Vinohrady quarter. Other participants were the writer Franti≈°ek Langer and the Prague Technikum official Eduard Drob√≠lek, who came up with the idea and served as treasurer. The party name referred to the controversial Imperial Rescript dated September 12, 1871, in which the Bohemian Landtag, as the representative organ of Czech political power, was asked to contribute to \\"the contemporary constitutional order, in the spirit of moderation and reconciliation.\\" The party was most likely founded as a direct response to the overly accommodating behavior of the Czech Social Democratic Party (\\"Evolution, not Revolution\\"), whose Prague representatives held events in Zlat√Ω litr. The party slogan abbreviation was \\"SRK\\", which officially stood for \\"Solidarity, Rights and Comradeship\\" () but in practice meant Slivovitz, Rum and Kontusovka. The party grew slowly. By its own account, there were only eight members as of December 14, 1904. As time went on the membership grew to include a few lawyers and doctors, as well as numerous figures from Prague's cultural scene: the anarchist journalist and publisher Anton√≠n Bouƒçek; satirist, painter, and anarchist Franti≈°ek Gellner, who served two stints as party secretary; writers and satirists including Karel Toman, Josef Mach, Gustav Roger Opoƒçensk√Ω, Louis K≈ôikava, and Josef Skru≈æn√Ω; the anarchist poet Josef Rosenzweig-Moir; the journalists Karel Pelant and Karel V. Ryp√°ƒçek; the illustrator Josef Lada; the ballet dancer Franz Wagner; \\"Hero of the Macedonian Uprising\\" and self- proclaimed Voivode Jan Klime≈°, For several years starting in 1904, Jan Klime≈° was a member of the Prague Bohemians. His book Life under the Macedonian Uprising was published in 1906. as well as the police commissioner Slab√Ω, who served as \\"Enforcers\\" at party meetings. There is no evidence the party engaged in any public activities until 1911. The only record is a political pamphlet by Ha≈°eks from 1904 referred to as \\"I am a member of a secondment from the country\\" that is possibly a description of the earliest form of the party's work. However, numerous researchers place the founding of the party with the activities of the 1911 elections. In contrast, numerous texts describe pre-1911 propaganda expeditions by party members to different regions of the K.u.K-Monarchy. The journeys were described by the party leader as figurative \\"apostolic missions\\" through Moravia, Lower Austria, Hungary, Croatia, the Carniola, Styria, Upper Austria, Bohemia and Vienna. Since these trips have a strong resemblance to the \\"Vagabond Wanderinsg\\" () Ha≈°ek regularly undertook starting in 1900, perhaps the party history is a case of an after-the-fact blurring and mystification on the part of the author, as evidence shows Ha≈°ek active as a journalist for an anarchist newspaper and an anarcho-syndicalist organizer during this time. For example, in 1907 he disturbed an electoral event of the Clerical Party as an agent provocateur, and in the same year was sentenced to a month in prison on charges of \\"assassination\\" and \\"incitement to assault\\". Therefore, some researchers consider the PMPWBL an \\"anarchist front-group\\". = 1911 election = alt= On April 8, 1911, after the dissolution of the old imperial council, the Austrian Interior Minister set a general election date of June 13, 1911, for the election of deputies to the 21st session of the Austrian House of Deputies that was to begin in mid-July.s.

A few days later at the new party headquarters, the Cow Stall () in the Vinohrady quarter, an executive committee of the reorganized \\"Party for Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law\\" announced they would participate in the election with their own candidate. At the same time, they published a manifesto to the Czech people, in which they introduced to party ideology of \\"Moderate Progress\\": :\\"The Svatopluk ƒåech Bridge was not built overnight.

The manifesto was even signed by leading Czech social democrats Emanuel ≈†katula und Bohum√≠r ≈†meral, later co-founders of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. However the two politicians stood in the election as candidates, and it is highly doubtful they were aware of their signatures in advance. The platform of the candidate for the Vinorhady election district, Jaroslav Ha≈°ek, consisted of seven points: # The reintroduction of slavery. # The nationalization of janitors.(\\"similar to how it is in Russia [...], where every janitor is simultaneously a police informer\\"). # The rehabilitation of animals. # The institutionalization of feeble-minded MPs. # The reintroduction of the Inquisition. # Judicial immunity for priests and the Church (\\"In cases where a schoolgirl is deflowered by a priest\\"). # The mandatory introduction of alcoholism.

Even on the day of the election, the leadership of the party tried to expand the size of the campaign team by hanging a notice: \\"Wanted: a respectable man to defame opposing candidates\\". All of this was in vain: after the around 3,000 votes cast in the Vinorhady district were totaled, only 38 were cast for the PMPWBL, or according to a contemporary periodical publication, as few as 16 votes.Radko Pytlik: Jaroslav Ha≈°ek in Briefen, Bildern und Erinnerungen.

The newspaper ƒåas reported in its \\"Daily Chronicle\\", on July 15, 1911, \\"Nothing is known about the fate of this candidacy, and the Imperial press office has not made any official statement regarding it. The candidate intends to protest.\\" The silence of the Imperial election commission was not unexpected, as the party had apparently not even officially registered its candidacy. As a result, the votes for Ha≈°ek were considered invalid. Later, on July 17, 1911, PMPWBL-member Franti≈°ek Gellner wrote a positive review of the campaign in the magazine Karikatury: :\\"Assuming that the enthusiastic agitation by the supporters of the Party for Moderate Progress within the Bounds of the Law increases their vote tally in the next election by a factor of ten, and the Austrian Parliament is dissolved a few more times in the foreseeable future, then in a few years the candidate for the Party for Moderate Progress within the Bounds of the Law will be seated in parliament.\\" = Further developments = The first party congress was held in 1913, in the restaurant Na Smetance in the Prague district of ≈Ωi≈ækov, but was only attended by a few party members. When the party leader inadvertently sat down on the service cap of the supervising police commissioner, the event was dissolved. Ha≈°ek reports on a subsequent \\"long-term persecution of the party\\", Jaroslav Ha≈°ek: Minutes of the II. a subsequent dramatic exaggeration. After the outbreak of the First World War Ha≈°ek was called up in February 1915 as a soldier, and was captured by Russians in September 1915. In 1916 he joined the Czechoslovak Legion, but deserted to the Red Army in 1918, where he held various functions, mainly serving as political commissar in the Political Department of the 5th Siberian Army. In December 1920 Ha≈°ek returned to Prague under false papers. During the year 1921 the second PMPWBL congress took place in Prague-≈Ωi≈ækov, in a large hall in the restaurant Yugoslavia, and was attended by about 300 people. The highlight of the congress was the unanimous adoption of a foreign policy resolution calling for the demolition of the globe due to the hopeless world situation. Jaroslav Ha≈°ek: Minutes of the II. Although it had been declared that a third, secret party congress would be announced by newspaper advertisements in the section \\"Where to Today?,\\" the activities of the PMPWBL ended in 1921. This was due to poor health of the party founder and chairman Jaroslav Ha≈°ek, who retired to Lipnice nad S√°zavou in August 1921, where he worked until his death in January 1923 on his novel The Good Soldier ≈†vejk.  Reality and literary treatment  The actual existence of the Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law is beyond dispute. Apart from the literary treatment by Jaroslav Ha≈°ek, there are numerous contemporary newspaper and magazine articles describing the activity of the party. Furthermore, it comes up repeatedly in the memoirs of participants and contemporary witnesses For example Arno≈°t Kolman: Die verirrte Generation. So h√§tten wir nicht leben sollen. Frankfurt a. M.: Fischer TB, √ºberarb. Ausg. 1982, S. 41f.; Franti≈°ek Langer: Byli a bylo. Praha: Akropolis 2003 (zuerst 1963). as well as in scientific works. According to Kindler's Neuem Literaturlexikon, Ha≈°ek's published speeches appear to have actually been delivered \\"in the same or similar form\\". Kindler's New Literature Lexicon. On the other hand, there is no realistic basis for the allegation that Ha≈°ek attended over 1,000 election campaign events during the campaign. Felix Kr√ºll: The Confessions of a German Stammtisch. In 1911-12, Jaroslav Ha≈°ek wrote almost 30 texts about the PMPWBL and its members. These are partly literary accounts, partly fictitious satire. The manuscript was bought in 1912 by the Prague publisher Karel Loƒç√°k, but not published because he feared problems due to the personality rights of the described persons. The next owner of the manuscript, Alois Hatina, only published ten of the texts in the magazine \\"Smƒõr\\" after Ha≈°ek's death in 1924/25. Nevertheless, the party was remembered. In 1928, when the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia wanted to distract from its failures with intensified populist propaganda campaigns, the Social Democratic newspaper Pr√°vo Lidu asked ironically: \\"Are the Communists the Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law?\\" Wolf Oschlies: The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918-1938). In 1937, the newspaper Rud√© pr√°vo published 23 of Ha≈°ek's works. They appeared in their entirety in book form for the first time in 1963 in Czech, and in 1971 in German translation. In the appendix to this edition (\\"Quellen und Materialien\\") there are two further texts obviously written by Ha≈°ek for the election campaign of 1911, as well as one of Ha≈°ek's election speeches as recorded by Franti≈°ek Langer and Josef Mach. Separately, in the early 1920s Ha≈°ek also wrote Minutes of the Second Party Convention, first published in German in 1957.  Legal status of the party  From today's perspective, the freedom Ha≈°ek and his colleagues exercised for their party activities seems amazing, given the Habsburg Monarchy's contempt for the party system and the monarchy's lack of a constitutional role for political parties. In legal practice at the time, the concept of \\"party\\" was used either in the sense of a political \\"club\\", an \\"association\\" or in the sense of \\"electoral list\\" as outlined in contemporaneous electoral regulations. A party law was not issued in Austria until 1975. Prior to this date, a party could be founded either by a simple statement of the participants (see. the later foundations of the √ñVP, SP√ñ and KP√ñ, known as \\"Declarations of Independence\\"), or by a \\"founding agreement\\" according to the rules of the Association Act. Starting in 1867, founding legally recognized associations with no longer required approval of the supervisory authority, and they were instead only subject to a four-week \\"prohibition period\\" (¬ß 6), which the PMPWBL effortlessly survived due to its \\"pro-state\\" demeanor. However, due to the presumed danger of parties in the Association Act, association activities were regulated in great detail. These regulations included the obligation to report all association activities to the government, and the right of the government to send officers to supervise the association. The election events of the PMPWBL were also subject to police supervision. While the supervising officer was allowed to dissolve meetings, he was explicitly forbidden to interfere in the debate or talk to anyone other than the club chairman, which severely curtailed his practical threat to PMPWBL public gatherings: : \\"Below an impromptu podium, the founders of this party, the Central Committee, sat at a long table with weighty faces. On the podium, at a small table with even more serious faces, the young chairman and a police commissioner were enthroned. Beside him stood Ha≈°ek, delivering his 'election speech. [...] The hall roared with laughter. And the police commissioner, who had absolutely no idea what was going on here, looked around lost and did not know whether he should intervene here.\\" Arno≈°t Kolman: The lost generation.  Scholarly assessment  There is wide academic agreement on the motivation for the founding of the PMPWBL. The author and publisher G√ºnther Jarosch argues social critique and ridiculing the contemporary opportunist party system through \\"hyper-loyalty\\" were the driving force behind the founding of the PMPWBL.G√ºnther Jarosch: Nachwort. In: Jaroslav Ha≈°ek: Die Beichte des Hochverr√§ters. Frankfurt a. M./Berlin: Ullstein 1990, S. 332‚Äì342, hier: S. 336. These forces were also the basis for the Prague Czech cultural elite's acceptance of the party's provocative activities, which can only understood in the context of the decades-long smoldering problem of nationalities in Bohemia. The political scientist Ekkehart Krippendorff emphasizes that in a \\"mixture of jests, and ultimate seriousness [...] the confusion and the morally pretentious rhetoric of party politics of the time was pointedly\\" brought into sharp relief. Ekkehart Krippendorff: The fatal comedy of the logic of state order: Jaroslav Ha≈°ek. Only the Ha≈°ek researcher Gustav Janouch considers the party a kind of drunken joke, which was only supposed to increase the beverage turnover in the Krav√≠n inn.Gustav Janouch: Jaroslav Hasek. Der Vater des braven Soldaten Schwejk. Bern: Francke 1966. This is contradicted by Jaroslav Ha≈°ek son Richard , \\"My father took his candidacy in the elections of 1911 very seriously and was operated from the assumption that he would get the number of necessary votes. After the election defeat, he was very disappointed and depressed.\\" According to Slavist Gisela Riff, the actions of Ha≈°ek and his party comrades reveal a merciless play on the \\"concepts\\" and \\"values\\" of political life. The philologist Walter Schamschula describes Ha≈°ek's goal as disillusioning spectators by breaking bourgeois taboos - not only in relation to Austro- Hungarian parliamentarism and its leading figures, but also in relation to individuals themselves. Therefore Ha≈°ek did not limit himself to criticism of himself and his party, but also anecdotally described accounts of their own willingness to lie deceive and deny their own political beliefs for personal gain. Gisela Riff also emphasizes the \\"impeccable\\" character of Ha≈°ek's performances. Ha≈°ek's main means of doing so was freely improvised speech, where he used long chains of association to combine the important with the trivial, fact with fiction. Ha≈°ek said in a campaign speech: : \\"Regulatory laws and security officials keep watch over us, and not so much as a single hair falls from our heads without their supervision. That's progress. If we look elsewhere, to China, for instance, where the security organs cut off people's heads, then must ourselves admit that here there is progress.\\" As events went on, however, the lines of argument would become more and more absurd: : \\"Friends, we are at a point where we did not want to be. Like the man who wanted to Budweis and got on a train in the opposite direction. He was caught by the conductor in second class, although he only had a third-class ticket and was thrown off the train in Bakov. And as one of the pioneers of our party, Mr Galileo Galilei, once said, 'And yet it moves,' I say now: Move, Miss Bo≈ºenka, and please bring a new round: three more beers for me, an allasch for Opoƒçensk√Ω, a quarter of white wine for Langer, a beer and a Magador for Divi≈° and a mineral water for Gottwald. This is proof of Galileo's words, 'And yet it moves' and clear evidence that the Party for Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law, knows how to assert itself and care about what its constituents want.\\" Czech in Franti≈°ek Langer: Byli a bylo . Riff and her pupil the linguist and translator Jana Halam√≠ƒçkov√° drew parallels to artistic forms and mediums such as happenings, Dada events, audience participation, and the play Offending the Audience. Jana Halam√≠ƒçkov√°: Afterword. Thus, the PMPWBL is one of the precursors of forms of political action that, since the 1968 movement and the formation of a new alternative culture, have questioned the established political institutions, forces and media. This type of political practice led to new practices of political expression emanating from average citizens. For example, see Sponti groups, revolutionary spontaneity or guerilla communication strategies. Umberto Eco : For a semiological guerrilla (1967).  Consequences  After the collapse of communism in November 1989, the party, which according to self-mystification continued to exist illegally since 1921, returned to the public under the leadership of the cartoonists Josef Kobra Kuƒçera and V√≠t Hrab√°nek and hosted the long-ago announced third Party Congress. Furthermore, from 1990 to 1992 the party published Skrt, a satirical magazine with an official circulation of 300,000. Strana m√≠rn√©ho pokroku v mez√≠ch z√°kona. In the following years, the party faced contemporary political problems: In 2000, it called for \\"moderate globalization within the bounds of the law\\" and suggested sending as many of its own children abroad as possible - and to have them demonstrate against globalization there. In January 2006, Richard Ha≈°ek, grandson of Jaroslav Ha≈°eks and a leading member of the party, concluded a \\"non-aggression pact\\" for the upcoming parliamentary elections with KDU-ƒåSL, the Christian Democratic Party of the Czech Republic. The contract, in which reciprocal attacks with beer and slivovitz continued to be expressly allowed, was signed by the then chairman of the KDU-ƒåSL Miroslav Kalousek in the presence of his deputy Jan Kasal, vice-president of the Czech House of Representatives. In 2003 a sister party was founded in Austria under the name of the Party of Reasonable Progress Within Moderate Limits. s. Since no activities of this party are detectable, it is assumed to be a mystification.

Starting from 1999, education in Kosovo was subject to reforms at all levels: from preschool education up to university level. These reforms aimed at adjusting the education in Kosovo according to European and global contemporary standards. As a first step of this new system is considered the establishment of the Department of Education and Science (DES), which is followed with the creation of legal and professional infrastructure, which should facilitate the fundamental reformation of the education (system 5 + 4 + 3-4 in the general and professional education as well as Bologna agreement for high education), and the establishment of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) in March 2002. During this period the private education system began to develop. The national institutions of education in Kosovo are governed by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.Elementary and secondary education in Kosovo Accessed 17.8.2016. History Among the first schools known in Kosovo were those opened during the Ottoman period‚Äîthat is before 1912.\\"The History, Culture and Identity of Albanians in Kosovo\\", Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, The History, Culture and Identity of Albanians in Kosovo, 1 May 1997, accessed 23 February 2014. Albanians were allowed to attend these schools, most of which were religious, with only few of them being secular. During 1913, in Prishtina, few Serbian-language primary schools and gymnasiums were opened.\\"Shifra dhe fakte per Arsimin e Kosoves\\" , KEC, p.54 The period that followed the Ottoman rule, between 1916 and 1918 was also important for the educational system in Kosovo. During this period, Prishtina, along with other municipalities such as Ferizaj and Prizren, was occupied by Bulgaria. Bulgarian occupier did not allow Albanian-language schools, however because of the positive impact of the Austro-Hungarians in the Bulgarian area, some religious catholic schools were allowed in Pristina and other municipalities occupied by them. In 1916, the Bulgarian National Gymnasium was opened in Pristina. The situation in terms of education was worse in the region under the rule of Bulgaria compared to the region occupied by Austro- Hungarian forces where 300 Albanian-language schools were allowed to be opened. During 1919‚Äì1939 in Yugoslavia, all Albanian-language schools were closed and education was allowed only in Serbo-Croatian. Around four (4) percent of Yugoslav people attended secondary education, with rural areas being the regions with the lowest numbers of participants since access to schools was almost nonexistent. During this period, the most marginalized group who was deprived from attending schools were girls coming from Muslim families. During the World War II Kosovo joined with Albania under Italian occupation. This marked a positive turn in the educational system in Kosovo since schools in Albanian language were allowed to be opened. Besides hundreds of primary schools opened in Pristina, the first high school in the Albanian language in this municipality, Sami Frasheri, was also founded.\\"Shifra dhe fakte per Arsimin e Kosoves\\" , KEC, p.57 After the World War II, Kosovo was again part of Yugoslavia. During this period, ethnic Albanians were recognized as a national minority and Albanian language was accepted and Albanian- language primary schools were allowed while higher levels of education were offered still only in Serbo-Croatian. In 1968, the constitution was amended to allow the opening of Albanian-language schools at all levels. After the WWII, education in Kosovo was provided in three languages: Serbian, Albanian, and Turkish, while after 1953 lessons in these three languages were offered in the same school. After 1968, the foundation of Albanian-language educational institutions continued. In 1969, the Albanian University of Pristina was opened. Texts and teaching materials were imported from Albania, as part of an agreement between the University of Tirana and that of Pristina in 1970. In 1981, the University of Pristina consisted of 75 per cent ethnic Albanians out of the 47,000 students attending it. During the late 70s and early 80s the economic situation in Kosovo and Yugoslavia was worsening. Furthermore, negative discrimination of students based on ethnicity led Albanian students of the University of Pristina to organize a massive protest on March 11, 1981, known as the Student Protests of 1981.\\"Shifra dhe fakte per Arsimin e Kosoves\\" , KEC, p.63 As a result of violent student riots, restrictions in the education of Albanians were imposed again. As a result of this protest, the previous agreement between Albania and Kosovo, to exchange educational materials, ended and Serbo-Croatian books started to be translated in Albanian to fulfil the needs of the university. Further, students, teachers and professors who participated in these protests were expelled, thus resulting in more than 260 students and more than 210 teachers/professors expelled. During the period of abolition of Kosovo's autonomy (1989‚Äì1990), education in Kosovo faced further changes. A new curriculum concentrated more in covering Serbian culture and history and that made Serbo-Croatian a compulsory subject in Kosovo high schools was adopted in 1990. Further, students who wanted to enter secondary schools had to pass a Serbian language test. As a result, after 1992, there were left only Albanian-language elementary schools while in secondary schools and Pristina University Serbian was the only language of instruction. In the 1990s, Kosovars established a parallel education system as a temporary solution to the situation created during that period. Around 300-450,000 students boycotted the state educational institutions and attended the parallel Albanian-language private schools. For a period of more than six years, Albanian-Kosovar students attended parallel primary and secondary schools and were unable to attend University as they were neither allowed to enter nor attend the University or Pristina. These private/parallel schools were located in mosques, private houses, garages, etc. On September 1, 1996, President of Serbia, Milo≈°eviƒá and Kosovar leader, Rugova signed the Milo≈°eviƒá-Rugova education agreement that would allow ethnic Albanian students and teachers to return to schools. However, this agreement was never implemented and this led to protest held between October 1997 and January 1998. Again, during these protests a number of the students were arrested and beaten by the police. On March 23, 1998, another agreement was signed that allowed Albanian students to return to schools and in the University of Pristina. However, this agreement did not allow the integration of Albanian students and pupils with the Serbian ones. To maintain this, a shift schedule was applied so that Serb students attended the lectures in the morning and Albanians in the afternoon. In response to this agreement and as a way to show their disagreement, Serb students and professors at the University of Pristina organized a protest where 10,000 people were gathered. Educational system in Kosovo =Preschool education= The preschool education system is divided into three levels: Kindergarten (for children of 1‚Äì2 years of age), Kindergarten (for children of 3‚Äì4 years of age) and Preprimary class (for children of 5 years of age). =Primary and low secondary education= Children studying in a primary school in Gjakova According to the law on primary and secondary education in Kosovo the primary education (1‚Äì5) and low secondary education is mandatory for everyone. The mandatory education begins when the child reaches 6 years of age (the minimal age of mandatory education). According to this law, the education in the publicly funded educational institutions is free of charge. The low secondary education is the second phase of mandatory education which includes classes 6‚Äì9, generations 12 to 15 years of age, respectively. The education in primary schools in Kosovo is held in five languages: Albanian, Serbian, Bosnian, Turkish, and Croatian. =High secondary education, gymnasiums, and professional schools= The high secondary education is organized in the general and professional education. The high secondary education lasts 3 or 4 years depending on the educational curricula designed by the MEST. All students are entitled to pursue this level on voluntary basis. The high secondary education is divided into two categories: the general and professional education. The main goal of the secondary professional education, which includes professional schools, is to prepare the students for labor market, but it also offers possibilities of applying for higher post-secondary or university studies. This type of education is organized in eight types of schools, where the classes are held in several profiles. =Special education= In accordance with the law on education, the rights to special education in Kosovo have those children that don't have or are not able to have normal education. In Kosovo there are total of 7 schools for special education and 64 adjoining classes. The classes are held in regular schools. =International Schools=  Finnish School of Kosovo  =Higher education= Higher education is available of attaining in various Universities and different educational institutions offering high professional education. Higher education is also available in public or private institutions where the students are offered associate degrees, bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and PhDs. Various schedules are additionally available where students can choose to pursue their studies full- time or part-time. Various alternations were brought by the network of high education institutions where a range of legal standards were adjusted for such institutions to develop. The standards and norms of higher education in Kosovo are supported by European standards as the platform on the development of the higher education system was based on the process of Bologna's objectives. The Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology has created the Kosovo Accreditation Agency (KAA) according to Kosovo's law on high education for the aim of assessing the appropriate quality in the higher education private and public institutions.Education in Kosovo Accessed 17.08.2016.

Career  ≈ölak started his career at Bank Przemys≈Çowo-Handlowy in Rybnik, where he was involved mainly in financing and restructuring energy, steel and mining-related companies. In 2002 he became the President of the Management Board of Rafineria Trzebinia. As the first person in Poland, he has \\"built\\" a facility for producing higher fatty acid methyl esters ('biofuels') and pharmaceutical glycerine, thus becoming \\"the pioneer of Polish biofuels\\". In 2005, he \\"built\\" the first plant for hydrorefining of purified paraffin in Central and Eastern Europe under license by Exxon Mobil. The plant allowed for use of petroleum processing products (paraffin) in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries. In 2005, he developed a new technology and started to produce a new fuel, trade name \\"ON BIO 10\\", consisting of diesel oil and 20% addition of higher fatty acid methyl esters. On this basis, the Minister of Economy adopted the quality standard for this fuel which is still in effect. For this product, Rafineria Trzebinia was awarded the Promotional Emblem ‚ÄúTeraz Polska‚Äù in 2006. In June 2006, ≈ölak was accused of reducing the payable excise duties for the unprecedented amount of PLN 760 million in connection with his duties as the President of the Management Board of Rafineria Trzebinia. After two years, tax authorities confirmed accuracy of the settlements, thus accepting correctness of the tax rate applied by ≈ölak. In 2006, he became the President of the Management Board of Skotan S.A., leading the company to one of its biggest stock increases on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. In 2008, he became the President of the Management Board of Bioeton S.A. In this company, he carried out a capital investment which allowed for the takeover of BDK Kyritz GmbH, a German renewable energy company. In 2009, he became the President of the Management Board of BDK Kyritz GmbH in Germany. ≈ölak restructured the company, which involved restoring its financial liquidity. At that time, the company was in the state of so-called \\"temporary bankruptcy\\". In July 2011 he took up the position of the President of the Management Board of Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A., a part of Bartimpex S.A capital group, which produces methyl esters and higher fatty acids (biodiesel), as well as raw and pharmaceutical glycerine. At the time of ≈ölak's taking up of the position, the company had not been operating due to a lack of contracts. As a result of his restructuring, Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A. generated a 7-digit net profit for the year 2012. At the same time, ≈ölak carried out an investment in bioethanol dehydrated spirit production plant, thus expanding the company's economic activity. The successful restructuring enabled the company to begin an application process for entering the stock market at the beginning of 2015. As the President of the Management Board and a shareholder of Wratislavia Biodiesel S.A., he has been carrying out works to build a plant for producing algae fuels (third- generation fuels). If successful, it will be the first plant of this sort in Europe. Since October 2011, ≈ölak has been simultaneously holding the post of the President of the Management Board of Akwawit-Polmos S.A. (also a part of Bartimpex S.A capital group) - a producer of spirits and vodkas. At the time of ≈ölak's taking up of the position, the company had fulfilled all the legal requirements to file for bankruptcy. In 2012, his actions resulted in signing agreements with world-scale alcohol producers: one with Brown-Forman (the owner of Jack Daniels and Finlandia brands) for the production of Maximus vodka and another with Diageo (the owner of Johnnie Walker and Baileys) for the production of Smirnoff vodka. As a result of the financial restructuring, the company is planning to enter the stock market in 2016. As part of the restructuring process, ≈ölak carried out an investment in Poland's most modern alcohol production line licensed by CFT Packaging S.A. The line is able to produce 100 million bottles a year, which increases the overall productivity of Akwawit-Polmos S.A. to 150 million bottles a year, thus placing the company among the biggest alcohol producers in Central-Eastern Europe. In 2013, he replaced the deceased Aleksander Gudzowaty as the President of the Management Board of Bartimpex S.A. ≈ölak is the President of the Management Board and a shareholder of HGBS Finanse S.A, a fund investing in new technology and \\"excise business\\" enterprises. In his career, he has been or is a member of the following supervisory boards (among others): Orlen Oil S.A, J.W. Construction S.A., Orlen Asfalt S.A, Polonia Warszawa S.A., Euronaft Sp. z o.o. = Dispute over the offset agreement = In April 2003, the Polish government signed an agreement with the U.S. for purchase of 48 F-16 jets for US$3.5 million. In exchange, the Americans agreed, among others, to invest in Poland's economy and help Polish enterprises to invest in the American market. They failed to fulfill the latter point. In 2014, carrying out the duties of the President of Bartimpex Management Board, Grzegorz ≈ölak led the company to reach a settlement with Lockheed Martin under which the Polish company was awarded several million dollars in damages. Bartimpex was the only legal entity in Poland to have been awarded damages for the unfulfilled offset agreement conditions. = The Yamal‚ÄìEurope gas pipeline = Grzegorz ≈ölak initiated the PGNiG takeover of the part of the Yamal‚ÄìEurope gas pipeline that goes through Poland. The transaction enabled PGNiG to take over 4% of the shares, which gave it advantage over Gazprom (52% to 48%) and guaranteed the Polish party the decisive vote on the most significant matters concerning EuropolGaz, the owner of the pipeline.  Awards  He was awarded the Silver Cross of Merit for contributions to the development of oil industry pursuant to the Polish President's Decree of 4 June 2003. He received \\"Man of the year 2005\\" Medal awarded by Gazeta Krakowska for \\"professionalism in company management, introducing innovative technologies, effectiveness in winning new markets and supporting culture and sport\\".  Community involvement  He funded two ultrasound devices which allow for earlier cancer detection for the Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases and Occupational Hypertension of University Teaching Hospital in Wroc≈Çaw. He funded a gamma camera used for an effective thyroid examination for the Department of Endocrinology in Zabrze. He funded a device which facilitates performing cancer surgery in children for the Department of Pediatric Surgery and Urology of Wroc≈Çaw Medical University.  Hobbies  ≈ölak is an avid enthusiast of football and motorcycle speedway. In 2004 and 2005, he led the speedway team Unia Tarn√≥w to its first in history title of the winner of Team Speedway Polish Championship. For many years, he has been connected with Polish speedway rider Tomasz Gollob, who officially handed the 2010 gold medal for winning Individual Speedway World Championship over to ≈ölak. In 2010, he also wrote a book, entitled Why only now?! Gollob as the world champion. A true story. In 2008, he carried out a capital transaction which led to the takeover of Groclin Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wlkp. by the shareholder of J.W. As a result, the club changed its name to Polonia Warszawa and the registered seat to the city of Warsaw. It was the first transaction of this sort and so far one of a kind on the top level of Polish football events. He acts as a speedway expert and Grand Prix commentator on Canal+.

With a history dating to the 1780s, the property is a fine example of the conversion of agricultural properties to summer and tourist-oriented uses in the 20th century. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history Saddlebow Farm is located in a rural upland area north of the village of Bridgewater. The property consists of about in an L-shaped parcel., of which about are in meadow and the balance is wooded. The high point of the property is on a ridge north of the house, which has been cleared to provide 360-degree views. The farm complex is located on the northwest side of Gold Coast Road, amid the meadows. Its central focus is the 1786 Cape style house, which has been enlarged for first tourist and later summer residential use, but retains original features and fixtures in its core. A particularly distinctive feature, found only locally in the Bridgewater area, is an \\"outdoor living room\\": this is a former woodshed attached to the south side of the house, with carriage door bays in the front that are open during warmer seasons and only enclosed in the winter. with The farm's documentary history begins in 1786, when the land was acquired by Joseph French, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. After 59 years of ownership by members of the French family, it underwent a number of ownership changes into the 20th century, the property varying in size from 140 to 190 acres. The farm was not really suitable for either subsistence or dairy farming, and it was sold in 1931 to Frances Weed of Summerville, South Carolina. Mrs. Weed converted the property to an inn, expanding the farmhouse to accommodate guests. The inn was not a financial success, probably due to the Great Depression, and the property was sold in 1937 into private hands. First used as a summer residence, it has been converted back into a year-round residence, with a series of farm buildings added during the 20th century.

Her specializations are the work of Piet Mondrian (Dutch: Piet Mondriaan) and the relationship between art and Western Esotericism, especially Modern Theosophy and Anthroposophy.  Biography  Bax was born on 10 November 1956 in Montreal (Quebec, Canada). Her parents were both journalists for the newspapers Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant and Algemeen Dagblad in Rotterdam Netherlands). In Canada her father Jack was a radio reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. After remigration to the Netherlands he became Chief of Public Relations of the City and Port of Rotterdam. He was the first in the Netherlands to implement a public information center for inhabitants, in which city developments were openly discussed. In the 1960s he was one of the first who envisioned local radio and television as public information channels. Bax is the sister of the human rights activist Robert van Voren and of Jacky Bax, Programme Manager and Deputy Director at NRPO SIA / Taskforce for Applied Research, formerly Programme Manager Innovation Universities at Ministry of Education, Culture and Science.  Profession  Bax studied art history at the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam. In 1987 she graduated on a thesis on the profound but still scholarly unrecognized influence of Japanese calligraphy on the work of the American Abstract Expressionist Franz Kline. In 2004 she received her PhD on the influence of Modern Theosophy on Dutch art between 1880 and 1920. Bax' scholarly approach to art is interdisciplinary, combining art history and art analysis with (socioeconomic) history, sociology, philosophy, history of religion and genealogy. She works as an independent (co-)curator of and scholarly adviser to many international institutions on modern art from 1850. She has published many books and essays and wrote entries on Dutch architects for the Oxford Art Online. She has been editor of the university art historical magazine Kunstlicht and founder of its foundation, and editor-in- chief of the scholarly magazine Jong Holland. As an art critic for Het Financieele Dagblad she has written approximately 500 articles on art, architecture, design, institutional and private collecting, and the art market. She organized various conferences, e.g. on Nazi plunder and cultural heritage.  Mondrian  Piet Mondrian. The Amsterdam years 1892-1912 (1994) contains the first extensive analysis of the extensive social and artistic network of Piet Mondrian, based on genealogy and research in primary archival sources. In 1996 she was appointed editor of Volume I of the Catalogue Raisonn√© of Mondrian's work. The book Mondrian Complete received the Choice Outstanding Academic Title Award in 2002. Ever since she publishes and lectures regularly on aspects of Mondrian's life and art and serves as an authentication expert of his work. In 2014 she launched the first 3D virtual multi-user Mondrian Museum together with ActiveWorlds Europe and DX Media.  Western Esotericism  Bax started her research into art and Western Esotericism after the exhibition The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting 1890-1985 (1986-1987), of which Bax was assistant-curator at the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag in The Hague. In 1991 she published Bauhaus Lecture Notes 1930-1933, in which she describes the continuing influence of Western Esotericism on the theory and practice of the Bauhaus, right until its closing in 1933. The exhibition Okkultismus und Avantgarde (1995), of which Bax was member of the scholarly board and organizer of the Dutch section, was the first exhibition to focus exclusively on the influence of Western Esotericism on European art, thus opening a new field of art historical research. In 1996 she joined the study group ARIES, founded by Wouter Hanegraaff and precursor of the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism. As a member of ESSWE she contributes to international conferences, lectures and scholarly discussion groups and sharing research data. In 2001 she was co-founder of the Stichting ter bevordering van wetenschappelijk Onderzoek naar de geschiedenis van de Vrijmetselarij en verwante stromingen in Nederland (OVN; Foundation for the advancement of academic research into the history of freemasonry and related currents in the Netherlands). Main focus points of this foundation are research funding, the preservation of archives, and architectural heritage. Her dissertation Het web der schepping. Theosofie en kunst in Nederland van Lauweriks tot Mondriaan (The Web of Creation. Theosophy and art in The Netherlands from Lauweriks to Mondrian, Vrije Universiteit 2004), published in 2006 by Uitgeverij SUN, is the first systematic and interdisciplinary analysis of the relationship between art and Modern Theosophy. It contains a prosopography of the members of the Dutch branch of the Theosophical Society, which gives insight into the social and religious structure of the Society. Although the book focuses on The Netherlands between 1880 and 1920, it has set an empirical-methodological standard for any research in this complex field of art history. The exhibition Holy Inspiration. Religion and Spirituality on Modern Art (2008) was the first exhibition in the history of the strictly modernist Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam to focus on the religious, spiritual and Western Esoteric sources of inspiration of modern artists in the collection, based on the views of J√ºrgen Habermas. Parallel she contributed to Traces du Sacr√© held at the Centre Pompidou. In 2010 Bax made the full membership list of the Theosophical Society available online as a primary source for scholarly and family research. In 2010 she became interested in the life of Grete Trakl, musical prodigy and sister of the Austrian poet Georg Trakl, because of her notes on lectures by Rudolf Steiner. Research resulted in the first comprehensive biography of Grete Trakl, published in 2014. This book contains several chapters on her brother's position within the tradition of Western Esotericism.

Mining started in 1632, and for some time the mines were owned by the family of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Bol√≠var leased the mines to an English company to help finance the wars of independence, and they continued to be operated by English companies, using Cornish and local miners, until 1936. Today the mines are closed and partially flooded. Their remains are preserved by the Parque Bolivariano Minas de Aroa and may be visited by the public. Location The Aroa copper deposits are located in the Bolivar Iron Quadrilateral mining district. They are east of the village of Aroa in the state of Yaracuy, about west of Caracas and from San Felipe, Yaracuy. The mines are in rugged country about above sea level on the northern side of the Andes, which run from east to west. The climate is warm and humid, and the area is covered in thick forest. Early years In the 16th century it was known that there was gold in the Yaracuy, Santa Cruz and Aroa rivers, and in 1605 gold deposits were found in a small valley leading to the Aroa River. The King of Spain gave the mines in perpetuity to Dr. Francisco Mar√≠n de Narv√°ez and his heirs in exchange for 40,000 pesos. Mining began in 1632, following gold veins, which led to discovery of large deposits of copper. The mines attracted the indigenous Gayones Indians of the Duaca region, to the southwest. They came in part for the wages, in part because at the mines they could practice their traditional religion without interference by Catholic priests. Around the end of the 17th century the \\"Cobre Caracas\\" mining company became the property of the family of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var (1783‚Äì1830). The largest of the mines, La Vizcaina, was worked by 60 to 70 slaves. There was a surge in copper production in the 1790s. Alexander von Humboldt said the mines held some of the finest copper in the world. According to an 1825 newspaper report, \\"The Aroa mines have been but partially and defectively worked by the old Spanish Govt., about 40 of the natives only being employed at one time and even then yielded 300 tons of refined copper annually.\\" English mining operation Bol√≠var leased the mines to a British mining company to help finance the struggle for independence from Spain. The fighting continued in Venezuela from 1810 to 1821. In 1824 Bolivar leased the mines to British entrepreneurs. Captain Joseph Malachy sailed from Plymouth in March 1825 to take up his position as agent and resident director of the Bolivar Mining Association at the Aroa copper mines. Malachy was given the huge salary of ¬£1,200, compared to the typical salary of about ¬£300 for a mine manager in Cornwall. The British employed about 1,200 workers in the mines, including British and Venezuelans. They used the Aroa River to carry the ore by barge to the coast, where it was loaded onto ships. In 1832 Bolivar's sisters Juana and Maria Antonia sold the mines to the Robert Dent, an Englishman who owned the Bol√≠var Mining Association. In the 1830s Cornishmen in the reduction department of the Aroa mines made significant advances in methods of calcinating the copper ore. However, the company closed the mines in 1836 due to high mortality among the European workers and tensions with the native workers. The Bol√≠var Mining Association was succeeded by companies such as the Quebrada Land Mining Company, Quebrada Railway Land and Copper Company Limited, Aroa Mines Limited and Bol√≠var Railway Company Limited. Engine from the Tucacas-Minas de Aroa railway The owners planned to build a railway to the coast in the 1830s under the supervision of the young English engineer, John, later Sir John Hawkshaw. However, the project was put off several times due to civil wars and problems at the mines. The mines were damaged during the Federal War (1859‚Äì1863). Finally a narrow gauge line from Aroa to the port of Tucacas was opened in 1877. The railway was built by the British-controlled New Quebrada Railway, Land, and Copper Company, which also established a shipping service from Tucacas to Puerto Cabello, the region's main import-export centre. The Ferrocarril Bol√≠var was the first railway in Venezuela. Also in 1877 the road from Barquisimeto to Aroa was upgraded so it could be used by wagons and carts. In 1891 the railway was extended from Aroa via Duaca to Barquisimeto. During the Venezuelan crisis of 1902‚Äì03 Britain, Germany and Italy imposed a naval blockade due to Venezuela's refusal to pay damages suffered during the Federal War. In 1903 the British-Venezuelan Commission made an arbitration decision in the Aroa Mines Case that damages would not be allowed for injury to people or property committed by the troops of unsuccessful rebels. The umpire quoted an 1868 judgement that \\"Damages done to property in consequence of battles being fought upon it between the belligerents is to be ascribed to the hazards of war and can not be made the foundation of a claim against the government of the country in which the engagement took place.\\" Aroa was the first town in the country to obtain electricity and telephone service. A cableway was built linking the mines to the town. In 1915 the mines were owned by the South American Copper Syndicate Ltd. In 1930 they were operated by the English-owned Bolivar Mining Association, which used coastal mangrove trees for lumber in the mines. There were six mines, the Aroa Norte, Titiara, Titiara Norte, San Antonio, Zaj√≥n Verde 1 and Zaj√≥n Verde 2. The longest was the Titiara Norte at , while the deepest was the Aroa Norte at . Later years The mines were abandoned in 1936. In 1957 the Venezuelan state acquired the mines and transferred them to the Venezuelan Petrochemical Institute, which extracted pyrite and copper carbonate from them for the production of sulfuric acid. In 1972 the Institute transferred its rights to Yaracuy state. The Parque Minas de Aroa (Aroa Mines Park) was created on 21 September 1974, containing the old mine workings. The park contains the remains of the mining camp, copper smelter, railway and English cemetery, and away the remains of the mine itself and the crushers. There is a small museum with records of the mine. The mines are now partially flooded.

After the war it was purchased by the South African government and became one of the biggest hospitals in the world. Today it is called Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital. Background At the beginning of the war the South African government, Parliament and electorate were divided on whether or not to join Great Britain in the war against Germany. When South Africa did declare war against Germany, her forces were committed to serve in Africa only.Van den Heever, C., Baragwanath Hospital ‚Äì the Beginning, Adler Museum Bulletin, Volume 19, no. 1, March 1993. In June 1940 Italy declared war on the Allies and in August that year it invaded British Somaliland. Meanwhile, South African forces had moved to Kenya, as the war had moved to Africa. In September 1940 the British government asked the South African government to provide health care facilities for Imperial troops of the Middle East Command. It suggested two hospitals of 1,200 beds each in the Cape and Natal. South Africa decided to rather build one of the hospitals near Johannesburg, Transvaal. There was already a university medical faculty, a nurses' training college, and facilities for rehabilitation. The site of the proposed hospital was to be on the farm Diepkloof, south-west of the centre of town. The ground was bought from The Corner House mining group and it was to be situated at the 8th milestone on the road from Johannesburg to Potchefstroom. It was decided to call the hospital the Imperial Military Hospital, Baragwanath. The name of the hospital Diepkloof was south-west of the centre of town, which was on Randjeslaagte Sometime after the discovery of gold in 1886, a young Cornishman, John Albert Baragwanath, arrived on the gold fields to make his fortune. He decided to open a refreshment station near the place where the roads from Cape Town and Kimberley met, about a day's journey by ox-cart south of Johannesburg. He called it The Wayside Inn, but transport riders simply called it Baragwanath's place.https://www.chrishanibaragwanathhospital.co.za/ After the First World War an aerodrome was built close by and it was called Baragwanath as well. When the Second World War started, the Baragwanath aerodrome was used by both RAF and SAAF air crews under the Joint Air Training Scheme. The building Baragwanath Hospital, 1942 The initial estimate of the cost of erecting the hospital was ¬£324,000, but it was then decided to make provision for 1,544 beds (instead of 1,200) because of the increase in hostilities in the Middle East. The layout of the hospital resembled a military camp with many huts containing the various wards. There were about 50 wards that could accommodate 40 beds each. The Johannesburg municipality provided electricity, water and drainage. Construction commenced on 3 November 1941 and the first patients were admitted on 28 May 1942. A section was reserved for the medical and surgical treatment of tuberculosis. There was also a workshop for occupational therapy. The final cost of the hospital was ¬£328,000. Prime Minister Jan Smuts officially opened the hospital on 23 September 1942.Walter Philips, Baragwanath Military Hospital, Adler Museum Bulletin, Volume 19 No. 3, December 1993, p. 17. The people of Johannesburg supported the hospital throughout the war by providing entertainment and gifts for the patients. In February 1943 bowling greens were donated by the local bowling associations. Further sporting facilities including tennis courts, a swimming pool, a short golf course, and pitches for cricket, football, and hockey were provided. Running of the hospital The first Officer Commanding Baragwanath was Lieutenant Colonel D.L. Ferguson. He was succeeded by Colonel L.I. Braun on 3 June 1943 and him by Colonel W.H. du Plessis in the same year. Initially most of the staff were Canadians, but they were gradually reduced and replaced by locals. Colonel Alley took over command of the hospital in 1944. In 1946 he was succeeded by Colonel D.C. Scott. As the war in the Far East expanded, so the number of soldiers contracting tuberculosis increased. Johannesburg with its warm climate and dry winters was an ideal location to treat such patients. By 1944 Baragwanath had predominantly become a hospital for the treatment and convalescence of tuberculotics. From 1945 onwards the hospital was known as \\"130 Military Hospital and Convalescent Depot, Baragwanath.\\" Even after the war ended there were still many soldiers convalescing in the Baragwanath Hospital. The Royal family visited the hospital on 5 April 1947. In the surgical section King George VI invested Flight Lieutenant E.R.H.Watson, Royal Air Force, with the Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom). On the lawn Colonel Scott was invested as Commander of the Order of the British Empire, while Principal Matron C. Hose became a Lady of the Royal Red Cross. Captains T.S. Protheroe and J. Devine became Members of the British Empire. Squadron Leader R.A. Hedderwich received a Distinguished Service Cross. Commonwealth War Graves in West Park Cemetery The servicemen who died at the hospital were buried in the West Park Cemetery in Johannesburg. The Transvaal Provincial Administration paid the British government ¬£1 million for the buildings, remaining equipment and stores. The military left on 1 September 1947. Dr J.D. Allen was the first civilian Superintendent. The first Matron was Joan MacLarty. They started converting the facilities at Baragwanath to accommodate the non-European section of the Johannesburg General Hospital. Initially the hospital was called the NEH, but later the name Baragwanath was used again. The hospital move to Baragwanath occurred in May 1948.

It is hosted by the Yukon River Marathon Paddlers Association. 2016 was the 18th Yukon River Quest. Teams from 14 countries competed in the event. The water levels for 2016 were the lowest they have ever been during the race, so no records were set. Team #57 \\"Perfect Storm\\", a tandem men's canoe team, won the race in 46 hours 14 minutes and 56 seconds. 77 of 93 teams completed the race in 2016 including 9 of 11 stand up paddle boards.

Born in the Landore area of Swansea, Squance found work as a cleaner for the Great Western Railway in 1894, and four years later became a fireman on the railway. He joined the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF), at which time he was based in Aberdare.[untitled article], Railway Gazette International, vol.89, p.249 In 1907, Squance became an engine driver. He moved to Goodwick to take up the post, and was elected as secretary of the local branch of ASLEF, and he maintained leading roles in local branches as he moved, first to Newport, then to Llanelli. There, he chaired a joint committee of unions during the railway strike of 1911. Increasingly radical, he supported two drivers who refused to move Irish freight during the 1913 Dublin lock-out, organising solidarity action which ultimately led to most of the South Wales railway workers going on strike.Robert Griffiths, \\"1911 When the State fired on civilians\\", Socialist History Society ASLEF set up a GWR Delegation Board in 1915, and Squance was chosen as its first secretary; he was elected to the union's executive the following year, then served as vice-president in 1919/20 and president in 1920/21. In 1920, he was appointed to the National Wages Board, serving for eight years.\\"Obituary: Mr W. J. R. Squance\\", Annual Report of the 1948 Trades Union Congress, p.316 Following Squance's presidency, he became the union's full-time organising secretary. Active during the UK general strike of 1926, he was imprisoned for his role, but this only increased his prestige in the union, and in 1927 he was promoted to Assistant General Secretary. Squance was a member of the Labour Party, and was selected as the Prospective Parliamentary Candidate (PPC) for Bassetlaw at the 1935 UK general election. However, ASLEF decided that, if he were elected, he would need to resign his union posts, and Squance decided instead to stand down as PPC.Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XIII, p.2 During the early 1930s, ASLEF's general secretary, John Bromley, suffered from increasingly poor health, and Squance frequently deputised for him. As such, when Bromley retired in 1936, Squance was the natural choice as his successor.Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XIII, p.55 He also served on the General Council of the Trades Union Congress from 1936, until his retirement in 1939. As general secretary, Squance was known as an outspoken anti-fascist, close to the Communist Party of Great Britain. He took a leading role in the People's Convention of 1940/41, and as a result was expelled by the Labour Party.

In sports administration \\"high performance sport\\", where the emphasis is on winning prestigious competitions, is distinguished from \\"mass sport\\" or \\"recreational sport\\", where the emphasis is on attracting the maximum number of participants. High performance sport overlaps with the upper tiers of professional sport; within the realm of professional sport, the elite tiers of the sport are known, particularly in North America, as major leagues. On the other hand, elite competitors at the Olympic Games or World Games in some minority sports may be part-time or rely on government grants. Likewise, student athletes, especially in college sports, are often high performance despite being nominally amateurs. Much research in sports psychology and sports medicine is motivated by the needs of elite rather than mass athletes. Doping in sport is more common at elite levels, and research into performance- enhancing substances has been fuelled by the drive for success, this despite the practice being firmly illegal at almost all levels of play. Separate state agencies may be responsible for high performance sport and for mass sport; national governing bodies for a particular sport often have separate administrative units for supporting √©lite athletes and the funding of athletes likely to win Olympic medals. In public policy, funding for high performance sport may be justified for reasons of national prestige or as a marketing tool for encouraging mass sport. Eastern bloc countries invested in elite sport during the Cold War; Western countries began establishing Institutes of Sport for a similar purpose from the 1980s, with sports academies for nurturing promising young athletes. Such institutes may set goals in terms of national ranking on the Olympic medal table.

It was released on November 22, 2016, by Post Hill Press. Background American singer Lady Gaga's aunt, Joanne Stefani Germanotta, died on December 18, 1974, when she was 19, due to complications arising from lupus. Although the singer was born almost 12 years after Joanne's death, the latter's influence was predominant on the Germanotta family and Gaga's work, including naming her fifth studio album as Joanne. Joanne Trattoria, an Italian restaurant located at West 68th Street in New York City, was opened in January 2012 by Gaga. The restaurant is co-owned by Gaga's parents, Joe and Cynthia Germanotta. Chef Art Chef had met Gaga during a taping of The Oprah Winfrey Show, and partnered with Gaga for working in the restaurant. The New York Times described the place as having a \\"well-stocked bar, a cozy back patio and seating for about 70 people\\". A long dream of Joe Germanotta, the restaurant serves Southern Italian cuisine. Decor of the jaunt consists of scenes of the Tuscan countryside, and near a fireplace at the entrance, diners can see the Germanotta family photos hanging by a front booth. Release In August 2016, Post Hill Press announced the release of a cookbook authored by Germanotta, titled Joanne Trattoria Cookbook: Classic Recipes and Scenes from an Italian American Restaurant. The book was released by the publishing house on November 22, 2016 in hardcover format. Germanotta said that he had no inkling of what the process of writing a book consisted of, and had to learn each step, including how to promote it. Joanne Trattoria Cookbook consists of recipes for the dishes served in the restaurant‚Äîlike Joanne's Meatballs, Papa G's Chicken Scarpariello, and Nutellasagna‚Äîalong with anecdotes and family stories about the Germanottas. Sixteen pages of color photographs are present along with black and white ones, including pictures of Gaga in her high school. Post Hill Press described the book's premise as \\"Family, food, and love are the foundation upon which Joe and his wife, Cynthia, raised their daughters, Natali and Stefani\\". According to Jeanette Settembre from New York Daily News, the title of the book referenced singer Billy Joel's 1977 song, \\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\\", from his fifth studio album The Stranger. Content The book begins with a foreword written by Gaga, and Wenonah Hoye as a guest contributor. New York Daily News published an excerpt from the foreword, with Gaga writing about having dinner as a family every night. \\"The smell of a pot of fresh ‚Äògravy‚Äô is one of the fondest memories I have from my childhood. We would say a prayer and then eat as a family. We ended each prayer in memory of Joanne, whose name has become the symbol of both of our family's majestic accomplishments and of our losses along the way,\\" Gaga's foreword explained. Germanotta then writes an introduction titled Where Everybody Knows Your Name; in the piece he reminisces about his dreams as a kid of setting up his own restaurant, how he set up his business ventures, how sad he was to see his old eateries in New York being shut down, as well as how Joanne Trattoria was set up. The book offers 30 recipes from the restaurants, divided into seven chapters titled Gravy, Antipasti, Entr√©es, Thanksgiving Dinner, Salads, Desserts and Cocktails. The recipes gives a description of the dish to be prepared, lists the number of people to be served, and has extra footnotes, explaining important points to be considered while cooking.

It grew up to serve the Aroa copper mines, now defunct. Location Aroa grew up to serve the Aroa mines, which are east of the village of Aroa in the state of Yaracuy, about west of Caracas and from San Felipe, Yaracuy. The country is rugged, about above sea level on the northern side of the Andes, which run from east to west,. The climate is warm and humid, and the area is covered in thick forest. History Mining began in 1632, following gold veins, which led to discovery of large deposits of copper. Around the end of the 17th century the \\"Cobre Caracas\\" mining company became the property of the family of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var (1783‚Äì1830). The largest of the mines, La Vizcaina, was worked by 60 to 70 slaves. In 1824 Bolivar leased the mines to British entrepreneurs. The British employed about 1,200 workers in the mines, including British and Venezuelans. They used the Aroa River to carry the ore by barge to the coast, where it was loaded onto ships. A narrow gauge line from Aroa to the port of Tucacas was opened in 1877. The Ferrocarril Bol√≠var was the first railway in Venezuela. Also in 1877 the road from Barquisimeto to Aroa was upgraded so it could be used by wagons and carts. In 1891 the railway was extended from Aroa via Duaca to Barquisimeto. Aroa was the first town in the country to obtain electricity and telephone service. A cableway was built linking the mines to the town. The mines were abandoned in 1936. The Parque Minas de Aroa (Aroa Mines Park) was created on 21 September 1974, containing the old mine workings.

It was built in 1913 to a design by a local architect, replacing the old Fairlee Opera House, which was destroyed by fire in 1912. It is a fine example of Colonial Revival architecture, and is a focal point of the village center and the town's civic life. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history Fairlee Town Hall is located on the north side of Town Common Road, a loop road on the north side of United States Route 5, the main road through Fairlee village. It is prominently sited between the community church and the local community store. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, clapboarded exterior, and a poured concrete foundation finished above grade with rusticated concrete blocks. The east-facing front facade is symmetrical, with paired sash windows in the upper bays, and large fixed windows flanking the centered entrance on the ground floor. The entrance is sheltered by a hip-roofed porch supported by paired round columns with Colonial Revival styling. On either side of the main block are small single-story additions, one housing a storage vault. The interior of the building has an entry area with stairs to the second-floor auditorium and a small ticket booth (now storage closet). The first floor houses town offices, which have taken over space originally occupied by the library, and a meeting space and dining hall. The auditorium features a pressed tin ceiling, raised stage, and balcony. The painted curtain, ordered in 1912 for the opera house, depicts nearby Lake Morey. The building interior has retained virtually all of its original Colonial Revival trim. On December 5, 1912, a fire raced through Fairlee's village center, destroying the Fairlee Opera House, church, library, and meetinghouse. The town acquired the opera house parcel and built the present structure in 1913. It was designed by John Donahue, a local architect with no other known commissions in the town. The side additions were added in the 1950s. Although the library has moved out, the building remains a focal point of community life, housing town offices and hosting events in the auditorium.

He first started to paint on the streets after the revolution of 2011, in a campaign he called \\"Color the Walls of Your Street\\". He became widely known as an activist after launching several street art campaigns that criticized the political situation in his country and the conflicts which broke out in 2015 in Yemen. He always paints in the light of day and invites people to join him paint openly in the streets. People from different backgrounds and ages have joined him in his campaigns to express their own views around the political scene in Yemen. The influence of these campaigns spread to other cities such as Sana'a, Taiz, Aden, Ibb and Alhudaydah where similar campaigns were launched soon after. Subay has been compared to fellow street artist Banksy.  Early life and education  Murad Subay was born in Dhamar, Yemen on July 3, 1987. He was raised there until the age of 6, before his family moved to live in the capital Sana'a. He lived in Sana'a with his mother and six siblings. Murad used to draw at school, but he only became interested in art in the age of 14 when he painted his first sketch and received encouragements from his family. He studied English literature from 2007 to 2011 at Sana'a University. In the spring of 2011, specifically with the start of the peaceful Yemeni revolution, Murad was one of earliest to join the protestors in their demand of a just, civil state. He used to spend most of his time inside the change square, inspecting the entrants for weapons and joining the peaceful rallies. When the political parties seized control of the course of the revolution, he left the change square disappointed. The campaigns = Color The Walls of Your Streets = Subay drew his inspiration to launch his first campaign \\"Color the Walls of Your Street\\" from the damaged walls of the streets. He went down alone to the streets with his tools on March 15, 2012 to paint contemporary murals on the walls. He then posted a public invitation for people through his Facebook page to join him in painting openly. A week later, many people showed up to paint with him on March 22, 2012. He then invited people every Thursday morning to join him in painting murals openly, and often painted alone in other days. This campaign lasted for three months of which artists, passers-by, elders, children, men, women and even soldiers painted alongside him in different areas in Sana'a city. The idea of this campaign spread between people and similar campaigns were launched soon after in other cities. = The Walls Remember Their Faces = Soon after finishing his first campaign, Subay launched his second campaign which marked the transition to political art. He called the campaign \\"The Walls Remember Their Faces\\" on September 8, 2012 to highlight the forcibly disappearance of political activists and journalists from the late 1960s and until 2011. He used stencil technique to paint the faces of the forcibly disappeared on the walls of the cities and invited their families and people in general to join him. For seven months, Subay asked people on different media to supplement him with information around the forcibly disappeared. Many families responded to him and provided him with pictures, stories and sometimes belongings of the victims. They also joined in painting their disappeared relatives and friends and they held several protests during the campaign. Some of the consequences of this campaign were the creation of a special committee to investigate the cases of enforced disappearance, the discussion over the elaboration of a transitional justice law and the UN pressure on the Yemeni government to sign a convention against enforced disappearance. Subay and his friends painted the pictures of 102 forcibly disappeared victims in many areas in the cities Sana'a, Taiz, Alhudayda and Ibb. Many of these murals were defaced by unidentified people; however, this act did not discourage Subay and his friends from making dozens of duplicates across the city. = 12 Hours = On July 4, 2013, Subay launched the third campaign \\"12 Hours\\" to discuss 12 political and social issues affecting the Yemeni society and led it off with a mural about spread of weapons. Fellow artists started to join him during the second activity of the campaign which was about sectarianism. For a whole year, Subay and fellow artists painted murals about a certain subject each month in the streets of Sana'a city. The 12 topics they discussed were spread of weapons, sectarianism, kidnappings, tempering with homeland, US drones, poverty, civil war, terrorism, children recruitment, treason, corruption and an open topic in the 12th activity of the campaign. Not long enough after \\"12 Hours\\" campaign ended, unknown actors vandalized some murals discussing different political issues by covering the original murals with white paint or slogans. The vandalized murals belonged to the tenth hour \\"treason\\" that mostly discussed USA, Saudi Arabia and Iran's influence and involvement in the mounting conflicts, and the eleventh hour \\"corruption\\" that discussed different forms of corruption in the country. = Dawn Sculptures = In early 2015, specifically on January 15, 2015, Subay launched a forth campaign that he called \\"Dawn Sculptures\\". He led it off with an installation about \\"Elmuqah\\", an ancient Yemeni symbol that represents the unity of Yemenis and their state 3000 years ago. Subay was meaning to continue working on this campaign, had it not for the power outages and lack of funding that forced him to postpone the activity. = Ruins = A mural by artist Murad Subay in the first activity of Ruins campaign, painted in Bani Hawat area, Sana'a, on May 18, 2015. After the regional and internal conflicts broke out in Yemen in 2015, Subay launched the fifth campaign \\"Ruins\\" on May 18, 2015, to commemorate the victims of the conflicts and to highlight the catastrophic situation of the country. He often paints in the areas ruined due to the conflicts. Subay painted his first mural in the campaign in an area called \\"Bani Hawat\\" located in the suburbs of Sana'a, where an airstrike killed almost 27 civilians, including 15 children. His friends began to join him during the second activity of the campaign, in an area called \\"Faj Attan\\", a heavily populated area inside the capital Sana'a where a heavy air strike on a weapons storage facility nearby left behind tens of killed and injured civilians and destroyed the homes of hundreds of people. In the third activity of the campaign, he painted a mural in Taiz city, a city that is witnessing a great losses due to the internal and regional conflicts in Yemen. He painted the mural in the outer parts of the city because he was banned to go further inside the city by one of the conflict parties. For The fourth activity of this campaign, he was planning to paint mural in Aden city, another city torn by the internal and regional conflicts in Yemen. However, because of the dangerous security situation, he could not travel there, so he and his friends painted their murals in Sawan area in Sana'a, yet another area that was targeted by an air strike, leaving tens of killed and injured civilians. The fifth activity discussed another important issue, and that is limiting the journalistic freedoms. Subay and his friends painted the murals inside the Syndicate of Yemeni Journalists, to highlight the systematic detention of journalists and the violations committed against the journalistic freedoms. After that, in the sixth activity of the campaign, they discussed the issue of the siege on Yemen, whether it was placed by the regional conflict parties or the internal ones, limiting the access of food, medicine, water and humanitarian assistance to those who need it. Subay painted the seventh mural in London, where he discussed the ignoring of international community and media of the conflicts in Yemen. In the eighth activity of \\"Ruins\\" campaign, Subay and fellow artists painted about the economy collapse in Yemen. They painted the murals in front of Yemen Central Bank after the value of Yemeni Rial against the US Dollar dropped significantly, adding another misfortune to the already impoverished nation.  Open Painting Days  Aside from painting in the streets through campaigns that each have a special theme, Subay invited people to paint openly in the streets on the third and forth anniversaries of his first street art campaign \\"Color the Wall of Your Street\\" on March 15. = March 15, 2015 = Through his Facebook page, Subay invited people to paint openly along with him in the streets on the third anniversary of his first street art campaign \\"Color the Walls of Your Streets\\" on March 15, 2015, an event which he called \\"Humans and Art Day\\". He invited people to the event to express their love for life, beauty, homeland, and their fear of an expected civil war. They painted on one of the walls of Hadda street in Central Sana'a city. = (March 15 ‚Äì March 17), 2016 = Due to the many requests Murad received from people next year, he extended the duration of the open painting day event to become three days instead of one, so that many people could have the chance to join in. Murad chose a wall in front of a police station, and from the first day of the event, soldiers and police officers joined them in painting the walls.

It is located upstream on the secondary tributary of the Gan River. The Fanchengdui site is located about 23 km east of another archaeological site, Shinianshan. The river Meng flows through the south part of the Shinianshan site roughly from northwest to southeast, before entering a primary tributary of Gan, Yuanshui. Near Fanchengdui the two rivers and Xiaojiang meet, and together they enter Gan river.

The site is a mound, 1~3 meters in height relative to the surrounding plain, 124 meters in length from north to south, 100 meters from east to west - an area of over 10 000 square meters.[3] In 2006 it was designated as the sixth protected national cultural heritage site.

The first layer is cultivated land, about 30 cm thick. The second layer belongs to Wucheng culture. The remaining layers from third were recently designated as belonging to Fanchengdui culture. The site is not dated yet, but by comparison with the Shinianshan site, relics in the Fanchengdui site are of the same period as the third cultural level of the Shinianshan site, which would put their age at 4300~3700 years before present. The second layer of Fanchengdui site should then be around 3700~3000 years old. Among the unearthed relics are pottery kilns, housing construction, pits and tombs. Tomb styles are typical of the Shinianshan and Fanchengdui cultures, but there was also discovered an urn tomb typical of the Shijiahe culture. Among the unearthed tools there are axes, shovels and other tools of production; also cups, bowls, pots, and other daily appliances. In the fourth and fifth levels, a small amount of hard pottery demonstrates that the site belongs to the Bronze Age. Inside the tombs, clay pottery with black surface predominates. A large amount of sand- tempered ding shaped like shallow plates was unearthed from the site. Several scholars believe those tools were used in production of salt.

The firm has seen some controversy, especially with respect to its leadership, environmental impact, and work-related accidents. Background QPMC was founded in 2006 by instruction of the Government of Qatar through an Emri decree to provide efficient port service at the gabbro berths, as well as developing them to increase their capacity and ability to manage larger quantities of raw materials imported to facilitate trade. Additionally, the Qatari government wanted to ensure domestic market supply of building materials, provide consistent reserves of primary materials, stabilize their prices (using the First in First Out (FIFO) method), secure the country's strategic stockpile, and ease the government's involvement in facilitating revitalization and building processes to encourage and support affordable conditions for the private sector to flourish and be competitive in the region. Market QPMC has aimed to create a competitive environment, limit monopolies and boost industry transparency by making sure the local market receives a consistent supply of building materials and improve the efficiency of port facilities that are used in the import of bulk construction materials. The company maintains reserves in dune sand, gabbro, washed sand, and limestone, and has supplied about 40,000 cubic meters of dune sand to the market. Furthermore, the company is involved in operations through its capacity to develop and operate jetties for Government projects, construct cement, develop sea logistics supply chain, and offering solutions for the transport, storage, and delivery of primary materials in Qatar. Leadership The founding chairman and managing director of the QPMC was Khalid bin Mohammed al-Rabban. Al-Rabban has been associated to terrorist organizations and terror financing. He was the President and board member of Alkarama foundation, a Swiss-based organization which poses as a human rights advocacy group. In actuality, Alkarama is a front for political Islamist networks. Two of the organization's founding members Abd al-Rahman bin Umayr al-Nuaymi and Abdul Wahab al- Humaiqani are on the U.S. Department of Treasury‚Äôs sanctions list for their work as a major al-Qaeda financiers and representatives in the Arabian Peninsula through their transferring of millions of dollars in funding, and are Specially Designated Global Terrorists. In addition, Alkarama has represented clients associated with Islamist militants operating in Syria. Al- Rabban is also a member of the Global Anti-Aggression Campaign led by a close mentor of Osama bin Laden, Safar bin Abdul Rahman al-Hawali. The campaign also features al-Nuyami as a member and has supported Hamas leadership and Hamas members‚Äô in their quest for jihad. Currently, General Engineer Abdul Aziz Abdullah Al-Ansari is QPMC's chairman after his work with Qatar's Ministry of Interior. Current standing QPMC has refocused its strategy to work with contractors and private sector firms. In its efforts to supply raw materials for the construction industry, the company has signed five agreements in 2015 with private firms to deliver primary construction materials, mainly gabbro and limestone, to the Qatari market. The Doha Quarry and Oryx Trading were instrumental in these agreements through its commitment to provide the materials in large quantities. As of end of year 2015, the company has been able to sign over 24 supply agreements with local contractors, supplying them with over 19 million tons of materials, thanks to its last 4 signed agreements. One of QPMC's biggest customers is Ashghal, the Public Works Authority, through an agreement to supply it with over 90 million tons of gabbro and limestone for 5 years. This agreement has created a framework for Qatar's infrastructural development. QPMC has also signed a 5-year $500 million Contract of Affreightment with Hyundi Glovis in 2015 in their South Korea headquarters to ship 50 million tons of aggregates to Qatar. This contract will require the shipments of aggregates from the United Arab Emirates and Oman to Qatar throughout the 5-year contract. These efforts have come at an instrumental time for Qatar in its efforts to prepare for the 2022 FIFA World Cup by building stadiums and developing infrastructure in the country. Challenges In addition to its tainted leadership, QPMC faces a number of environmental challenges. The company has struggled to keep its carbon footprint levels low. Additionally, the firm has faced a number of operational challenges in the aggregate supply chain, especially with regard to occupational hazards and harmful work-zone accidents that have occurred under its watch.

She is known for her path-breaking scholarship in US women's and gender history, and for her significant contributions to developing interdisciplinary programs and international scholarly networks addressing women's history, gender studies, the history of sexuality, and cultural and Atlantic studies. Her groundbreaking article, ‚ÄúThe Female World of Love and Ritual,‚Äù established the legitimacy of lesbian history as it helped move women's history from the margins to the mainstream of historical scholarship, creating ‚Äúa template for how feminists could literally make history‚Äù (Potter, 2015). Her first publication in this area, the article ‚ÄúDis- covering the Subject of the Great Constitutional Debate,‚Äù was awarded the Binkley-Stephenson Award by the Organization of American Historians in 1993. Her book, This Violent Empire: The Birth of an American National Identity, won a Choice Award for Distinguished Scholarly Book in 2011. Early life and education Smith-Rosenberg was born in Yonkers, New York, 15 March 1936 to Carroll Smith and Angela Haug Smith. She grew up near Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx neighborhood described by Tom Wolfe in Bonfire of the Vanities; her heritage included a Caribbean grandfather, two centuries of slave-holding ancestors, and ‚Äúon both sides, Irish grandmothers who didn‚Äôt speak to one another‚Äù (Smith-Rosenberg, 2007). She obtained a BA from the Connecticut College for Women (1957) and her MA (1958) and PhD (1968) from Columbia University, where she worked with Richard Hofstadter and Robert Cross (Smith- Rosenberg, 1971). From 1972 ‚Äì 1975 she held a Post-doctoral Fellowship in Psychiatry at the Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania, where she also taught. Scholarship Smith-Rosenberg has described her scholarly career trajectory as ‚Äúbuilt around forty years of university teaching, scholarly friends around the world, and‚Ä¶ an increasingly progressive political vision‚Äù (Smith-Rosenberg, 2007), all of which have informed her approach to scholarship. Though she was trained in the tools and assumptions of conventional history, the political feminism of the 1960s led her to reshape the questions she asked and to push the boundaries of both the methods and the conceptual frameworks of traditional history (Smith-Rosenberg, 1985, p. 11). A principal goal was ‚Äúto so redefine the canons of traditional history that the events and processes central to women‚Äôs experience assume historic centrality, and women are recognized as active agents of social change‚Äù (DuBois et al., 1980, pp. 56‚Äì57). She began by exploring women's voices as inscribed in their private letters and diaries and integrating them into ongoing conversations with larger social, political and ideological movements. Smith-Rosenberg's early scholarship focused on problems of urban poverty in Victorian America and the ways in which an emerging bourgeois elite attempted to understand and contain them Smith-Rosenberg, 1985, p. 20). This work, reflected in her first book, Religion and the Rise of the American City (1971), included study of the American Female Moral Reform Society. Intrigued by this ‚Äúuniquely female institution‚Äù (Smith-Rosenberg, 1985, p. 11), she began seeking new sources of research material addressing the socialization of female and male roles, which in turn led her to the discovery of a passionate 40-year correspondence between two women. Suddenly, Smith-Rosenberg has recalled, ‚Äúeverywhere I looked, the private papers of ordinary women beckoned‚Äù (Smith-Rosenberg, 1985, p. 27). The result was her groundbreaking article, ‚ÄúThe Female World of Love and Ritual: Relations between Women in Nineteenth-Century America.‚Äù Presented at the second Berkshire Conference on the History of Women (Melosh, 1990), and published as the lead article in the first-ever issue of Signs, the Journal of Women in Culture and Society (1975), the article is among those most frequently cited in the scholarship on women's history and is seen as one of the first and most influential explorations of the history of lesbianism, notable for placing female sexuality within the larger context of gender construction (Melosh, 1990). Until the article's publication, to the extent it was addressed at all, the separation of gender roles between women and men and resultant sexual patterns was generally described only in terms of subordination and victimization. Smith-Rosenberg's article, however, ‚Äúoffered a striking reinterpretation of the possibilities of separation‚Äù (Kerber, 1997, p. 166). As Smith-Rosenberg later noted, In hundreds of cultures around the world and across time, women have lived in highly sex-segregated communities; spending their time with other women; developing female rituals and networks; forming primary emotional, perhaps physical and sexual, ties with other women. Such women develop visions of the world, values, indeed, I would argue, even symbolic and cosmological systems different in highly significant ways from those of the men with whom they shared sex, food, and children (DuBois et al., 1980, p. 61). The article was so influential to the development of women's history that, more than 40 years after its publication, it continues to be widely cited and discussed in major scholarly forums. As historian Claire Bond Potter pointed out to the Organization of American Historians (2015), ‚Äúwhen feminist scholarship began to move definitively away from a movement context and women‚Äôs history became a multi-generational project, this article traveled in a way that few have‚Äù (see also Rupp, 2000). Smith-Rosenberg went on to publish numerous articles addressing sexuality and gender relations in nineteenth century America, many of which were collected in her second book, Disorderly Conduct: Visions of Gender in Victorian America (1985). Discussing the collection in the New York Times Book Review, Elizabeth Janeway (1985) wrote that ‚Äúfew historians have used the stream of myth and history so productively‚Äù; the book, she noted, ‚Äúsuggests a restructuring of the way we see history by presenting the reactions of men and women to the shock of industrial upheaval, and the interplay between their variant visions.‚Äù In the 1980s Smith-Rosenberg was one of the principal organizers of the New Family and New Woman Research Planning Group. The Group brought together feminist scholars from the U.S. and Europe at a time when feminism was just developing as a political movement and a scholarly endeavor in many European countries. Feminist scholars from Great Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy as well as the United States attended. The planning group ‚Äúbelieved we had a historical mandate to identify new domains, create new institutions, or try to carve out places for ourselves in areas that had previously excluded, devalued, and ignored us‚Äù (Friedlander et al., 1986). The group's activities resulted in the volume, Women in Culture and Politics: A Century of Change (1986), edited by Judith Friedlander, Blanche Wiesen Cook, Alice Kessler- Harris, and Smith-Rosenberg. In her subsequent scholarship Smith-Rosenberg has continued to explore the roles and relations of traditionally marginalized populations in U.S. history and has increasingly turned her attention to the ways political, racial and national identities take form, culminating in her recent book, This Violent Empire: The Birth of an American National Identity (2010). The book explores the question, ‚ÄúWhy did a nation of immigrants, a people who see themselves as a model for democracies around the world, embrace a culture of violence?‚Äù (Common-Place, 2011). Smith-Rosenberg traces this culture of violence ‚Äúto the very processes by which the founding generation struggled to create a coherent national identity in the face of deep-seated ethnic, racial, religious, and regional divisions‚Äù (Ibid.) She describes how the country's founders consolidated a national sense of self by describing a series of \\"Others,\\" including African Americans, Native Americans, women, and those without property, whose differences from the country's founders overshadowed the differences that divided the founders themselves (Smith- Rosenberg, 2011). The result, she argues, is an American national identity subject to xenophobia, racism and paranoia. Reviewers have noted that, although its focus is on early U.S. history, the book speaks powerfully to U.S. political and cultural issues in a post 9/11 world (see, for example, Hansen, 2011; Jeffers, 2011). Her latest book project both continues Smith- Rosenberg's interest in American ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù and reaches back to her own Caribbean heritage. The project explores the concept of modern citizenship as emerging from intense interactions among four violent events in the Atlantic world: the U.S., French, Haitian and Irish Revolutions. It ‚Äúfocuses on the complex triangulation of race, slavery, and gender, using them to examine the contradictions and ambivalence lying at the heart of both citizenship and, most especially, of liberal political thought‚Äù (Aspen Institute, n.d.). Teaching Smith-Rosenberg began her teaching career at the University of Pennsylvania, teaching initially, in the 1960s, when few women found positions in Ivy League Institutions, as an adjunct in the School of General Studies. In 1972 she became an assistant professor in both the Psychiatry and the History departments of the University. At Penn she founded and served as an early director of the University's Women's Studies Program (1982‚Äì1995). From 1996 until her retirement in 2008 she taught at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where she is the Mary Frances Berry Collegiate Professor of History, American Culture, and Women's Studies (emerita). At Michigan, she served as graduate chair of the American Culture Program and director of the Atlantic Studies Initiative, which she helped to establish. She has also been a visiting scholar at a number of academic institutions, including Columbia University, New York University, the City University of New York Graduate Center and the Ecole des Hautes Etudes des Sciences Sociales, Paris.

After their landing in 1937 the Four Ladies Bank in Prydz Bay was named after them. On an earlier voyage to Antarctica Rachlew took photographs which were published in 1934. Some sections from her diary were preserved and these are the earliest examples of a woman's writing about her travels in Antarctica.  Personal life  Ingebj√∏rg Lillemor Enger was born on 7 January 1902 to Eugenie Marie Mejdell and Ivar Enger, owner- director of an Oslo ammunition factoryHarald Gram and Bj√∏rn Steenstrup, Hvem er Hvem? (Norwegian Who‚Äôs Who), Oslo 1948 and brother of entrepreneur . In 1928 she married ex-naval officer Cato Rachlew (1883-1968), who had been on an Arctic expedition organised by the Duke of Orl√©ans in 1907. He was a Norwegian naval attach√© in London from 1917-1919, and stayed there some years as a representative of Norwegian paper and pulp companies. Lillemor Rachlew did charity work in London during the Great Depression before the couple moved back to Norway around 1932.Merkantilt Biografisk Leksikon (Mercantile Biographical Dictionary), Oslo 1935  Antarctica  She joined two expeditions undertaken by whaling fleet owner Lars Christensen and his wife Ingrid Christensen on the tanker Thorshavn, one in 1933 and one in 1936-7. Recent research suggests Rachlew was the second woman ever to land on the mainland of Antarctica, and the third to step onto the continent including islands. The four women had \\"travelled nearer to the South Pole than any woman had done before,\\" Christensen was reported to have said when he arrived in London from South Africa on his way back.Discoveries in Antarctic: Four women take part in Norwegian expedition, Aberdeen Journal, 9 March 1937, p6 = 1933 voyage = Rachlew seems to have been an energetic and lively presence on the 1933 expedition.Jesse Blackadder, Illuminations: Casting light upon the earliest female travellers to Antarctica, October 2013 Equipped with a cine- camera and a rifle, she took photographs, hunted seals and kept a diary of which only fragments remain.Jesse Blackadder,'Frozen voices: Women, silence and Antarctica', in Antarctica: Music, sounds and cultural connections, Australian National University 2015 > We crept and slipped along, closer and closer in... It was all very > exciting! But we had to give up when we were within 5 nautical miles of > land...Great blocks of ice as big as church towers lay higgledy-piggledy, 5 > miles deep, jammed tightly together, with only a few lanes intersecting > them. It was impossible to get through. Not even a dog could scramble over > those steep blocks. Her diary is now lost and the extracts quoted in Lars Christensen's book, Such is the Antarctic, are \\"the only remaining words from the women who went to Antarctica before World War II\\".Jesse Blackadder, Heroines of the Ice > At one time during the morning it became a little calmer and I made my way > along to the verandah ‚Äî as we called the built-in deck beneath the captain‚Äôs > bridge ‚Äî with my cine camera under my arm, to see if I could get any snaps > of what could be seen of the after-deck between the waves.

She would then go on a \\"short big-game hunting trip\\" with the Christensens and Mr. H. Bogen.New Expedition to Antarctic, The Times, 9 Jan 1933, p12 Hans S.I. Bogen was author of Main events in the history of Antarctic exploration and several books in Norwegian about whaling, the history of Sandefjord and Lars Christensen. In early 1934 some of Rachlew's photographs were published in a French magazine by a journalist with a special interest in polar exploration.Charles Rabot, ‚ÄòVoyage d‚Äôune femme dans L‚ÄôAntarctique‚Äô (Journey of a woman in the Antarctic), in l‚ÄôIllustration, 4741 (13 January 1934): pp52‚Äì53Charles Rabot = 1937 landing = It was in 1937 that conditions allowed Rachlew and others to land on Antarctica. Caroline Mikkelsen had been the first woman to do this: probably on the Tryne Islands in 1935. Then on 30 January 1937 Ingrid Christensen set foot on the mainland at Scullin Monolith, and records suggest that Rachlew was the next of the \\"four ladies\\" to do so. She was also the second woman to go up in a seaplane to view previously unknown Antarctic territory, where Ingrid Christensen had earlier dropped a Norwegian flag.Lars Christensen, My Last Expedition to the Antarctic, 1936-1937: With a Review of the Research Work Done on the Voyages in 1927-1937.

The Italian conquest of British Somaliland had taken place seven months previous in August 1940. The British had withdrawn from the protectorate after a delaying action at the Battle of Tug Argan. The British withdrawal, after the disastrous conclusion of the Battle of France and the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, had repercussions among British leaders and began the loss of confidence in General Archibald Wavell, the British commander in the Middle East by the Prime Minister Winston Churchill, which culminated in his sacking on 20 June 1941. British, Empire and Commonwealth forces from the United Kingdom, British India, Australia and South Africa in Aden trained for a prospective invasion of British Somaliland. The Far Eastern Fleet provided Force D, comprising two cruisers, two destroyers and a collection of adapted troop transports. To deceive the Italians in Ethiopia about British intentions in East Africa, Operation Camilla was leaked, suggesting that troop movements to Sudan were for an invasion of British Somaliland and that a diversionary operation would come from Kenya in the south. In Operation Canvas, the real invasion plan, Kenya was the base for the main invasion. Force D and the Aden Striking Force conducted a beach landing at Berbera on 16 March 1941, taking the port by The Italian garrison made a precipitate retreat back to Ethiopia and local troops deserted en masse. In a few days, Berbera was developed to receive troops and supplies for the operations against Ethiopia, reducing the supply distance to the fighting front by . A British military administration was imposed on the protectorate, the local police and the Somaliland Camel Corps were re-established, civilians were disarmed and the economy was revived. Background =Strategic situation, 1940= On 10 June 1940, when Italy declared war on Britain and France, Italian military forces commanded by the viceroy and governor general of (AOI, Italian East Africa), the Duke of Aosta became a threat to the British and French holds on their colonies in East Africa. Italian forces in Eritrea endangered British sea routes along the coast of East Africa, to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, French Somaliland, British Somaliland and Kenya Colony (British Kenya) were vulnerable to attacks from the AOI. The collapse in France and the Armistice of 22 June 1940 drastically weakened the British strategic position in the Middle East and East Africa. The closure of the Mediterranean to British sea traffic left only the voyage around Africa, to supply the British forces in the Middle East. On the eve of the Italian declaration of war, the Italian colonies in East Africa had members of the armed forces and police and Ethiopian and Somali . In July, the British had in British Kenya, Anglo- Egyptian Sudan and British Somaliland. =Italian invasion= On 3 August 1940, British reconnaissance aircraft discovered that about troops had crossed the Ethiopian‚ÄìBritish Somaliland frontier at Biyad, near Borama (Boorama). The Italian invasion force moved in three widely dispersed columns, co-ordinated by wireless and liaison aircraft. The main (central) Italian column advanced from the region of Harar in Italian Ethiopia, crossed the border south of Borama and reached Hargeisa on 5 August. The Somaliland Camel Corps skirmished with the Italians as they advanced and the central column attacked Hargeisa with infantry and light tanks covered by artillery and air attacks. A Rhodesian infantry company blocking the road retreated, after knocking out three light tanks, while the main British force slowly retired from the town. On the same day, the northern invasion column captured the port of Zeila (Saylac), not far from French Somaliland and then slowly advanced the down the coast road to Berbera, taking Bulhar (Bulaxaar), about from Berbera, on 17 August. The main Italian force advanced in the centre from Hargeisa along the road to Berbera, only slightly delayed by road demolitions and improvised land mines. British troops in advanced positions were withdrawn on 10 August and the Battle of Tug Argan took place from 11 to 15 August. The Italians had achieved air superiority by 6 August and the defenders held the gap against Italian attacks for 72 hours, eventually running out of ammunition. Italian artillery superiority led to the defenders gradually being overwhelmed. By the time that the northern Italian column reached Bulhar, the defence of the Tug Argan gap had begun to collapse. Major-General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen had been sent to command the forces in British Somaliland and on 14 August, judged that the situation at Tug Argan was irretrievable and was instructed by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Middle East Henry Maitland Wilson to withdraw from the protectorate (Wavell was in Britain). The garrison retreated to Berbera and by 18 August, most of the contingent had been evacuated to Aden, with the HQ sailing in on the morning of 19 August; Italian forces entered Berbera that evening. The British suffered killed and wounded; the Italians =Operation Camilla= After the retreat to Aden, the British established Military Mission No. 106 (Hamilton's Mission) to conduct sabotage and subversion operations in occupied British Somaliland. The former Senior Administrative Officer of the protectorate, Reginald Smith, made several secret journeys to the land to glean information. In Cairo, General Archibald Wavell, GOC-in-C Middle East Command concocted Operation Camilla, a deception to mislead the Italians about the transfer of troops to Sudan. The operation was intended to convince the Italians that the troops movements were part of a plan to invade British Somaliland in February 1941 and then advance on Harar. Wavell wrote in a document that, The document purported Operation Canvas, the invasion of Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia from Kenya, to be a diversion; it was sent to the local commanders in East Africa using means by which the British expected it to leak to the Italians. The main invasion from Kenya required a huge supply effort and the plan to re-capture British Somaliland was intended to create a much closer supply route from Berbera for the southern invasion force. The port was rudimentary but improvements could quickly be effected. Aosta, the Italian commander of the AOI was convinced by February that an invasion of the colony was imminent. Prelude =Plan= The British made use of such resources as were available to British Forces Aden (Air Vice-Marshal Ranald Reid) to re-capture Berbera and expand it into a bridgehead sufficient to supply About of the Aden Striking Force, comprising the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and 3/15th Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army (1895‚Äì1947), which had fought in the colony during the Italian invasion, a Somali commando detachment and the 1401/1402 (Aden) Companies, Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps Group and 150 motor transport (MT) would be transported across the Gulf of Aden. The East Indies Fleet, comprising ships of the Royal Navy and the Royal Indian Navy were to contribute Force D (Captain Harold Hickling), the cruisers and , the destroyers and , the auxiliary cruisers Chakdina and Chantala, Royal Indian Navy trawlers Netravati and Parvati (Lieutenant HMS Choudri, R.I.N.), the troop transports S.S. Beaconsfield and Tuna and Force D was to conduct the voyage in two parts, the advanced part comprising Kandahar, Chantala, Chakdina, Parvati, Netravati and the cargo ships Beaconsfield and Tuna, carrying troops and towing three tugs and six lighters. The second wave of Force D comprised Glasgow, Caledon, Kingston and M.L. 109, all transporting troops. =Preparations= Training began in January, ships were converted to carry troops, two of the lighters, designed by the Sea Transport Officer, Aden, Commander Vernon were to be used as floating piers, fitted with ramps to ease the unloading of the MT, including armoured cars. The RAF flew reconnaissance sorties to find suitable landing points, discover Italian defensive preparations and find potential landing grounds for their aircraft. With fire support from the cruisers and destroyers, the invasion force was to land on beaches between reefs to the east and west of Berbera, create a bridgehead and then re-occupy the protectorate. The air photographs obtained were an incomplete set and the Navy considered that towing vessels from Aden was risky because the tows could part and delay the voyage. In poor visibility finding Berbera could not be guaranteed and approaching an unsurveyed, hostile and dark shore at night, then finding gaps in the reefs wide enough to tow through the lighters was a gamble. The importance of Berbera to the British offensive against Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia was such that the risks were accepted. On the three nights before the landings, the RAF bombed the big Italian base at Dire Dawa in Ethiopia. =Voyage= On 14 March the first echelon departed Aden at but only out, tows parted, some wrapping around the ships' propellers. To keep to the schedule a quick change of plan was made; Kandahar left the tugs and lighters for Beaconsfield and Tuna to tow. The naval ships went ahead to make rendezvous north of the Berbera Light at on 16 March according to the plan. The sloop was sent from Aden to assist Beaconsfield and Tuna by on 15 March. The second echelon sailed an hour later and rendezvoused as planned. At on 16 March Glasgow, Caledon, Chantala, Chakdina, Netravati, Parvati and M.L. 109 were to land the 1/2 and 3/15 Punjab at Main Beach, west of Berbera Light covered by a bombardment from Glasgow, along with Kandahar and Kingston, which carried the (mostly Somali) 200-man Commando of Force G (R) who were to make the subsidiary landing east of Berbera, covered by Kandahar. The ships were to close on the coast at . Shoreham, Beaconsfield, Tuna with the three tugs and six lighters in tow, were about midway between Aden and Berbera, moving at . Invasion =Landings= At on 16 March Glasgow, Kandahar, Kingston and M.L. 109 moved forward at towards Berbera Light and to find the gaps in the reefs off the landing beaches. Caledon, Chantala, Chakdina, Netravati and Parvati were to arrive off the west beach at and drop anchor near Glasgow which would be showing a red light out to sea. During the approach lights were seen ashore from vehicles on the Hargeisa Road, bound for Berbera. At on 16 March, the Berbera Light was seen on a bearing 186¬∞ at distance. Kandahar and Kingston separated from the force and made for the eastern beach; Glasgow stopped and launched a motor boat and skiff for Commander Vernon to use to find the gap in the reef off the western beach. The gap was hard to find and there was a delay of 63 minutes in landing the first tows. Kandahar and Kingston found their gap in the reef off the eastern beach at although the reconnaissance photographs had shown this to be the harder of the two to find. The delay led to apprehension by Colonel Pollock and Captain Hickling (the captain of Glasgow) that the landing might occur in daylight. The landing at the eastern beach due at was also delayed; at a Somali fisherman in a canoe rowed up to Glasgow. The fisherman said that Italians still occupied the town but some had left by lorry that night; there were Italians near the Berbera Light. The Somali was sent to find the gap in the reefs but Vernon found it at At the signal \\"Land, follow Glasgow's boats\\" was given and four minutes later Glasgow began to bombarded the main beach with H.E. from its 4-inch guns and 2-pounder pom-poms. The fire from the 4-inch main armament was that used for E-boat attack, with half the shells bursting on impact and the other half bursting over the target, until when Kingston received the order to begin landing on the eastern beach. Kandahar bombarded the beach from Tows moved through the gaps to the eastern and western beaches, success signals coming from at the western beach was made at and at the eastern beach at During the disembarkations shells burst among the tows and ships offshore, thought to be from four to six 4-inch guns and some ineffectual machine-gun fire; the 6-inch, 4-inch and pom-poms of the bombardment ships silenced the Italian artillery. Glasgow mainly engaged trenches near the Berbera Light and west of the aerodrome. Kandahar concentrated on the defences to the east of the town. =Berbera= Anticipating a British landing, the Duke of Aosta, the Viceroy of the AOI, had agreed to the evacuation of the protectorate. On 14 March the Italian garrison began to evacuate the territory and the 17th Colonial Brigade retired to Dire Dawa. The 70th Colonial Brigade remained, except for its commander, Brigadier-General Arturo Bertello who passed through Dire Dawa just before it was captured. When the naval bombardment began, about troops in Italian service and their Italian officers and NCOs retreated from Berbera towards Hargeisa. The first wave, comprising the 15th Punjab Regiment, was carried by Parvati which towed a tug and barge for the landing. Parvati was bracketed by three 4-inch shells but the landing was carried out without loss against scant opposition. The 2nd Punjab Regiment landed and advanced through the 15th Punjab towards the town, as a party of the 15th Punjab moved inland to cut the coast road. All of the troops involved got ashore before dawn. Little opposition was met with ashore and the town was captured by on 16 March. The British and Indian troops suffered few casualties and over 100 prisoners were taken. Due to a mistake, the Aden Pioneers, who were unarmed, had been ordered to attack with the Punjabis and their commander, Captain S. J. H. Harrison wrote later, A diversion to the east of Berbera was engaged by sixty members of the garrison but the landing party suffered only one Somali soldier killed and a British officer wounded. A wireless message sent to London that \\"The British flag flies again over Berbera\\" but the invaders had forgotten to bring one and had to borrow it from a resident. RAF fighters provided a standing patrol on the day of the invasion and for the next four days. The second echelon ships had arrived by the time that Berbera fell and tugs checked the harbour for mines with Oropesa sweeps. By Force D was unloading; the special motor transport pier consisting of the two modified lighters was assembled at the spit and motor transport unloaded from Beaconsfield by The landing force was well established ashore with adequate stores and rations, local water being available. Air reconnaissance reported the hinterland to be deserted (naval protection ended on 18 March when Glasgow departed; air cover continued until 20 March). The Shaad and customs piers had been damaged but could be repaired with local materials; demolitions at the power station and refrigerating plant required assistance from Aden to make them operational. The water supply was about to be blown up but the occupation troops prevented it. Mining of the aerodrome had been carried out and the RAF was informed. The landing force sent 43 Italian prisoners of war to Aden in Parvati on the day of the landings, as the hospital ship Karapara which was not needed. About on 17 March some aircraft were heard and a barrage was fired; no further Italian aircraft were seen during the day. On 11 March the 1st South African Brigade Group and the 22nd East African Brigade Group had been placed under the command of the 11th (African) Division, joining the 3rd (Nigerian) Brigade Group. The division advanced from Barawa (Brava), south of Mogadishu in Italian Somaliland. On 25 February the division departed Mogadishu and on 17 March, patrols of the 3rd (Nigerian) Brigade reached Jijiga, cutting the road to Harar, the Italian line of retreat from the protectorate. On 19 March, Brigadier Buchanan and a staff officer arrived by air at Berbera to take command of Bucforce, a temporary name for the 2nd South African Infantry Brigade, most of which had sailed from Mombasa on 16 March and was due on 22 March. On 20 March, a party of Nigerian troops reached Tug Wajale, from whence two armoured cars drove to Berbera along the road from Hargeisa and joined with the Aden Striking Force. The Italian 70th Colonial Brigade became one of the many units of the Italian colonial forces in the AOI that had begun to desert en masse. When Bertello was captured in Western Abyssinia, he claimed that his brigade had \\"melted away\\". On 21 March, Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham, commander of the East African Force, visited to congratulate the victors, to make arrangements for the expansion of the port facilities and announce the establishment of a British military administration. Aftermath =Analysis= The Italian occupation had lasted seven months; in the British official history volume I (1954), I. S. O. Playfair wrote that the port was quickly prepared, despite a shortage of lighters, no electric lights, the heat and the Kharif (autumn wind) blowing sand and increasing the surf. Within the week, the 11th African Division was receiving supplies through Berbera, shortening by its supply line. In 2016, Andrew Stewart, in \\"The First Victory...\\" wrote that the British ascribed the success of Appearance to the extent of the preparations and training. He speculated that the use of ships as floating piers might have influenced the use of Mulberry harbours in the Normandy landings. =Subsequent events= After the Italian garrison fled, a prisoner of war camp was built, eventually big enough for to accommodate Italian prisoners taken in the region. Two battalions of the 2nd South African Brigade arrived by sea from Kenya, the third battalion arriving two weeks later, after making a road march with the brigade transport. On 8 April, Brigadier Arthur Chater, the former commander of the Somaliland Camel Corps was appointed Military Governor. The Italians had abandoned Zeila on 18 March and a retired Somali police inspector uncovered a hidden British flag, raised it and began to collect abandoned Italian arms and equipment. On 23 March a Somaliland police officer landed and recalled the local police. The Somaliland Camel Corps had been disbanded after the British evacuation and by the time British returned to the headquarters in Burao on 18 April, 80 percent of the former members had made their way to Berbera. On 4 May a company of the corps began a mission to suppress a Mijjertein raiding party, the rest of the corps conducting disarmament operations with a motley of captured Italian weapons and equipment. Many of the buildings in Berbera had been damaged, government stations demolished and the civilian wireless and telephone networks were out of action. Army signals units had to carry civilian administration messages until the infrastructure had been restored. The economy of the protectorate had been greatly harmed by the war, internal trade had stopped, there were no regular shipping services with Aden and only dhows were available. There was little food in the territory but the livestock herd had increased since 1939 and had suffered little from the Italians. The fall of Addis Ababa restored confidence, internal trade resumed and by the autumn the export trade had revived. Once Berbera replaced Mogadishu as an entrep√¥t, demand for labour increased; payment in wages and in food acted as an economic stimulus and local businessmen immediately made use of the sea traffic to and from Berbera; a return to normal conditions did not occur Zeila and Boramo, near the border with French Somaliland, due to the need to blockade the pro-Vichy regime.

A \\"digital first\\" decision occurs when a publisher chooses to distribute information online in preference to or at the expense of traditional media like print publishing. Many employers and employees find it challenging to imagine using digital first practices. Distributing content digital first introduces new practices, including a need to manage the data which tracks readership.

Patricia Crone describes Mansur as \\"a coarse soldier equally devoid of nobility and piety\\" who was \\"shunned by devout contemporaries\\" as he disregarded religion and was motivated solely by his desire to avenge the torture and murder of the Yaman champion, Khalid al-Qasri, by the ardently pro-Qays governor of Iraq, Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi, in 743. A member of the Amir branch of the Banu Kalb tribe, he began his career possibly in Iraq, where the tribe had settled, but appears for the first time in Syria as a member of the plot to overthrow Caliph al-Walid II in early 744. After Walid's murder, his successor Yazid III favoured the Yaman faction, and appointed Mansur as governor of Iraq in succession to Yusuf al-Thaqafi, perhaps as a deputy of al-Harith ibn al-Abbas ibn al-Walid. His tenure was brief, as he was soon replaced by the son of Caliph Umar II, Abdallah ibn Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz. During his governorship, Mansur tried to dismiss the governor of Khurasan, Nasr ibn Sayyar, nominating his own brother Manzur as replacement, but Nasr managed to hold out and maintain his post until Mansur's replacement. Mansur returned to Syria, but soon returned to Iraq, where he fought against the Kharijite rebels under al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Shaybani. As the Kharijites proved successful, he embraced their doctrine and converted to save his life. He continued fighting alongside the Kharijites until Marwan II's general Yazid ibn Hubayra defeated them in 747. Like many opponents of Marwan, he fled to Fars and joined the forces of the Alid rebel Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya. When Ibn Hubayra defeated Ibn Mu'awiya shortly after, Mansur fled to India, where he managed to become governor of Sind, and even obtained recognition of this post from the nascent Abbasid Caliphate. In 751, however, the Abbasids sent Musa ibn Ka'b al-Tamimi against him. Defeated in battle, Mansur fled to the desert, where he died.

It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2018. It is the first Metal Gear game to be developed following the series' creator Hideo Kojima's departure from Konami in late 2015, and the first since 1990's Snake's Revenge to be made without Kojima's input. The game takes place between the events of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and follows the Captain, an MSF soldier who enters a parallel dimension and establishes a local command center to unravel the mysteries of a strange virus that turns people into zombie-like creatures. Pre-release reception of the game was generally negative, in response to its design and recent business decisions from Konami. Upon release, Metal Gear Survive received a mixed reception from critics. Due to its low sales within the Metal Gear series, the game was considered to have underperformed commercially.  Gameplay  Metal Gear Survive is a survival action-adventure game with tower defense elements and minor stealth mechanics, played from a third-person perspective. It features a cooperative multiplayer mode, in which the player can be joined by up to three other players to complete missions. A large portion of the gameplay consists of the player exploring the world which is mostly covered by \\"The Dust\\", a mysterious toxic cloud that obstructs vision, disables the in-game map, and requires the player to monitor their oxygen level. Players venture out to gather resources such as food and crafting materials as well as to activate the various portal generators scattered throughout the map. These generators serve as the game's fast-travel system and are each unlocked by completing a tower-defence segment. Metal Gear Survive tasks players with managing thirst and hunger by scavenging for water and hunting animals for food. Players can then return to base camp in order to cook food and later purify water for safe drinking. There is also an injury system, which requires players to use different medical supplies to heal ailments such as bleeding or food poisoning. The main enemies of Survive are crystalline zombie-like creatures called \\"Wanderers\\", with many variants introduced as the story progresses. The enemies in Survive can be overcome using either stealth or a large variety of weapons and gadgets earned gradually through finding crafting recipes or broken weapons. Players begin with access to melee weapons such as spears, machetes and shock-batons. Eventually, bows with several kinds of arrows and firearms such as pistols, shotguns and sniper rifles are acquired. Due to the difficulty of attacking enemies head-on, players are encouraged to use a device that allows them to erect various fences, barricades and other structures. Available gadgets include grenades, Molotov cocktails, decoys, automated gun-turrets and a plethora of traps. Killing enemies earns players \\"Kuban Energy\\", the game's currency which can be used to level-up and acquire new skills. After completing the main story, four additional \\"sub-classes\\" are unlocked which have their own set of skills gained by levelling up. Class skills range from straight stat bonuses, special attacks, mobility skills and even stealth camouflage. Players are able to upgrade their base camp by building defences, advanced crafting stations, farms, animal cages and rainwater collectors. Other survivors can be rescued from The Dust to provide the base camp with support staff. Base staff can also be organized into an exploration team and sent out to automatically acquire resources. Eventually, players can initiate a tower defence segment at base camp, allowing them to defend against attacks and earn rewards.

Plot  Following the Ground Zeroes Incident, the surviving MSF members bury their dead, aided by the UN. A UN member takes the body of a soldier, who had avoided being sucked into a wormhole that had opened above Mother Base shortly after the incident, but had severed their arm when it closed. Months later, the soldier awakens in a Wardenclyffe Section facility, a government research group investigating organisms and wormholes. The UN member, Goodluck, a chief researcher, enlists the soldier to enter a wormhole to Dite, another dimension. The soldier was chosen due to the Mother Base wormhole infecting him with an organism from Dite, restoring their arm but putting them at risk of becoming a zombie-like Wanderer. Goodluck dubs the soldier \\"Captain\\", and instructs them to find a cure and to rescue others transported to Dite through wormholes. In Dite, the Captain makes their way to Base Camp, allying with Reeve, an XOF soldier sucked into the Mother Base wormhole. They find Base Camp abandoned except for Virgil AT-9, an artificial intelligence from the Charon Corps, an investigation team previously sent to Dite. Following an emergency shutdown upon their disappearance, Virgil remained dormant and its memory partially lost. The Captain rescues several human survivors, including a boy called Chris. Virgil eventually generates a wormhole to transport the group back to Earth, but cannot maintain it without Iris, a source of energy. They are contacted by Joseph Gruen, head of Wardenclyffe Section, claiming that Goodluck acted against orders in orchestrating the Captain's mission, before committing suicide. A black box within Virgil supports this, but Gruen vows to bring the group home. With enough Iris energy, the wormhole is opened but Gruen demands maximum energy output, attracting the Lord of Dust, a huge creature. The group is forced to enter and close the wormhole before it can follow. They are transported to a forested area of Dite instead of Earth, and deduce Gruen desired the Lord of Dust to use for its vast source of energy. Goodluck instructs them to find a weapon to destroy the creature. The Captain rescues an MSF soldier, Seth, from a Corps survivor, Dan. The group assumes Dan caused the Corps' disappearance. The Captain locates the weapon, a Metal Gear, but is confronted by Dan, who allies himself with the group. Seth betrays them, revealing that after being sucked into the Mother Base wormhole, he was taken in by the Charon Corps. He then allowed himself to become infected by the Dust, causing their dissolution. Seth transforms into a Wanderer, forcing the Captain to kill him. Virgil reveals that he had become infected whilst Seth was with the Corps and quarantined its programming with the emergency shutdown. However, contact with Seth reversed these countermeasures, giving Virgil access to its data. He reveals that Dite is Earth in the 22nd century, caused by the Lord of Dust. Formed from energy and self-replicating nanomachines, the Lord of Dust feeds off of Iris energy and creates wormholes to transport matter to consume. Once Dite is ravaged, the Lord of Dust transports itself back in time to start the process again, causing a time loop. Securing the Metal Gear, the group remain to destroy the Lord of Dust, but Chris is chosen to be the one to return to Earth. Attracting the Lord of Dust, the survivors use the Metal Gear to trap it, while Chris goes through the wormhole, promising to rescue them. From here, the story has two endings depending on the player's actions. If the player follows Chris, the Captain abandons the survivors and goes through the wormhole. The Lord of Dust escapes the trap and the remaining survivors are presumed dead. The Captain re-emerges in a desert dressed in their MSF uniform, picks up a photograph that appeared next to them, and wanders off. If the player stays, the Captain fires on the Lord of Dust using the Metal Gear, but only maims it before it reforms. A final message from Goodluck explains that he failed them; he is revealed to be Chris, having gone through the wormhole and ending up in 1943. Having worked his way into Wardenclyffe Section, he made his recordings for the Charon Corps and potential survivors to receive in the hope they could destroy the Lord of Dust. Having no notion of death, the Lord of Dust is unable to be killed. Virgil enters the creature and introduces it to the concept, having created its own understanding from experience. The Captain uses the Metal Gear to destroy the Lord of Dust. An after-credits scene shows a damaged Virgil launching from the Lord of Dust's body and returning to Base Camp, explaining to the Captain that it is still functional and will be able to continue assisting them in their mission. In an alternate timeline, Gruen reprimands Goodluck in his mistake that the next wormhole was predicted to open above Mother Base. Goodluck deduces that the survivors have destroyed the Lord of Dust and reaffirms his vows to bring them home.  Development  Metal Gear Survive was announced on 16 August 2016 during Gamescom 2016. It was not the first time the concept of a zombie game was toyed with, as Hideo Kojima said on 29 April 2013 that he always wanted to make one during Metal Gear Solid Vs development, and Kojima reportedly requested to Platinum Games that the sequel to Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance have Gray Fox fighting against nanomachine-empowered zombies. The game's development was hinted at on 17 December 2015, when Konami started recruiting for a new Metal Gear development staff. The game uses the Fox Engine. Konami Europe president Tomotada Tashiro described Metal Gear Survive as a \\"fresh take on the series' famed stealth elements\\", with a \\"unique co-op setting that is designed for a truly engrossing multiplayer experience.\\" In an interview with Dengeki PlayStation, the development staff stated that the player is able to customize their character, use several weapons, and develop their own equipment to suit their play style. They also stated that while it is possible to stealthily maneuver around enemies when playing solo, it is much more difficult taking on waves of them compared to co-op play. At Tokyo Game Show (TGS) in September 2016, a demo revealed that the Fulton Cannon would make an appearance. The player can optionally retrieve the creatures for resource building, acquire resource building, heal themselves on the main menu, and the player can develop various things from collected resources, from defensive measures to offensive measures. The players can also split up. During a stage presentation at TGS 2016, Hideo Kojima was asked if he had anything to do with Metal Gear Survive. He stated that the game had \\"nothing to do with [him],\\" the Metal Gear series is about \\"political fiction and espionage\\", and zombies do not fit into his vision of the series, despite his previous remarks concerning a sequel to Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance with zombies. Yoji Shinkawa also stated that he was not involved with the game. He jokingly said that Metal Gear Survive would even have mechs if he worked on it. The game was released on 20 February 2018 in North America, 21 February 2018 in Japan, and 22 February 2018 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.  Reception  Metal Gear Survive received a generally negative response following its announcement, in part due to the controversies surrounding Konami's recent business decisions and Kojima's departure from the company. Complaints focused on the game's genre and theme (being branded as \\"generic\\" as it revolved around fighting zombie-like enemies through co-op and multiplayer), recycled assets from Metal Gear Solid V, microtransactions, constant internet connection requirement and the departure from the general feel of previous Metal Gear games. Upon release, Metal Gear Survive received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw of Zero Punctuation ranked it as the third worst game of 2018, comparing it to the similarly criticized Fallout 76, stating: \\"for all [Fallout 76]s greedy corporate buggery, misuse of beloved established IP, and being just plain boring and shitty to play, there was another game that beat it on all three of those fronts. Look no further than Metal Gear Survive!\\" = Sales = In Japan, the PlayStation 4 version sold 31,359 copies within its first week on sale, placing it at number three on the all format sales chart, and number one on the digital sales charts.http://twinfinite.net/2018/03/metal-gear-survive-beats-monster-hunter- world-sales/ https://store.playstation.com/ja-jp/grid/PN.CH.JP-PN.CH.MIXED.JP- PS4RANKING/1 In the UK, Survive debuted at sixth place in the all format sales chart, selling 85% fewer copies than Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, and 95% fewer copies than Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. As of 2018, Konami's earnings report did not mention Survives total sales, unlike the previous entries in the series and other games made by the company.Makuch, Eddie Metal Gear Survive Sales Not Addressed In Konami's New Earnings Report, Gamespot, retrieved on 6 August 2018. \\"The Japanese publisher today reported earnings for its fiscal year ended March 31, and the report didn't say anything about the game's performance. The report marks the game's release as a notable event during the year but says nothing of how well it did in the market. Konami is of course under no obligation to share a unit sales figure--in fact, many publishers are shying away from announcing hard sales numbers these days. Still, the silence is notable given the size and stature of the Metal Gear franchise.\\"Boudreau, Ian Konami omits Metal Gear Survive sales from earnings call, PCGamesN, retrieved on 6 August 2018. \\"The fact that Metal Gear Survive, a spinoff of what has been one of the company‚Äôs tentpole franchises, isn‚Äôt mentioned in either the business performance or next year‚Äôs outlook sections doesn‚Äôt bode particularly well for the series..\\"Lanier, Liz Konami Reports Most Profitable Year Yet at Over $2 Billion, Mum on ‚ÄòMetal Gear Survive‚Äô, Variety (magazine), retrieved on 6 August 2018. \\"In the report, Konami credits the popularity of 'Pro Evolution Soccer: 2018' in North American markets for the increase in earnings this year. 'Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links,' the mobile game version of the trading card game, notably 'surpassed 65 million downloads worldwide.' Konami‚Äôs report briefly mentions the release of 'Metal Gear Survive,' but doesn‚Äôt linger on it. Konami also put an increased focus this past year on markets other than consumer, console game titles.\\" Critics ultimately deemed the game as having underperformed in sales.

Description and history The Continuity of Life Forms is a large mid-century modern mosaic and one of the earliest remaining works by local architect and artist Willard \\"Will\\" Martin, who also designed Pioneer Courthouse Square. It is made of 20 panels and measures approximately tall and wide. The work has been installed in two locations at the Oregon Zoo. According to the organization, The Continuity of Life Forms \\"[captures] a panoramic sense of history and being ‚Äî the forces of life ‚Äî out of footprints, seeds, leaves, shells, fossils and primitive life forms that might be found in the Earth's strata\\". The mosaic was originally installed at the zoo's entrance in 1959, when the zoo moved to its current location. In 1997, the zoo's entrance was relocated, and the mosaic became less visible, obstructed by a fence and out of the way for visitor access. In 2014, during construction of the zoo's conservation education center, the mosaic was removed and placed into storage. During its 2014‚Äì2015 fiscal year, the Oregon Cultural Trust granted $20,000 to the Oregon Zoo Foundation for the mosaic's conservation and restoration. The funds allowed the Oregon Zoo Foundation to hire an art conservator and restoration artist to \\"ensure the accurate restoration and conservation of this splendid artwork for future generations\\". Additional funding was provided by the Oregon Zoo Foundation's Education Campaign, which raised more than $1.5 million for the center and educational programming. The Continuity of Life Forms was re-installed at the conservation education center's entrance, near the zoo's former main entrance, in July 2016. One of the zoo's project managers said of the mosaic's current location, \\"We want the zoo to serve as a gateway experience to what may become a deeper relationship with the natural world. So bringing 'The Continuity of Life Forms' back at this same location is ideal.\\" The organization hopes the re- installation will introduce another generation to the artwork and Martin, who died in a plane crash in 1985.

However, as one player is allowed to be in motion before the snap, play is not technically stopped. If the defense relaxes, believing the quarterback is about to walk to the sidelines, the ball can be snapped to one of the other players and played against a defense that is unprepared. If the defense is not fooled, the quarterback can simply complete the fake task, and return to the center to call the snap. The Indianapolis Colts, New Orleans Saints, Pittsburgh Steelers, and St. Louis Rams have used variations of this play in the NFL, and it was also used in the movie The Longest Yard for a winning two-point conversion. Under some state high school rules, if the quarterback or coaches on the sideline say anything that may lead the defense to believe that a snap is not imminent, then the play is not legal under the Unfair Act section of Rule 9.

Early life  Dominic was born in 1937 in (Hollabrunn, Austria), where he was baptized Dominic Habsburg-Lothringen. Into the family he is named Niki. In 1942, after spending the first few years of his childhood at Sonnberg Castle, he moved with his parents, his brother, and his four sisters to Romania.

He was executed as a western spy on the guillotine in Dresden. Approximately ten minutes later his lover Elli Barczatis was also executed. Life =In Br√ºnn/Brno= Karl Anton Laurenz was born and grew up in Br√ºnn (since 1919 \\"Brno\\"), a large multi-cultural city, and at that time the principal city in the Austro-Hungarian territory of Moravia. His school career concluded successfully when he passed his school leaving exams (\\"Abitur\\"), which opened the way to university-level education. Remaining in Br√ºnn, he studied Jurisprudence at the city's recently opened Masaryk University. His studies included a dissertation which he wrote with the title \\"De poena capitali mutandis in temporibus\\" (\\"On the Death Penalty through the ages\\"). By this time, following frontier changes mandated at Versailles, Austro-Hungary had ceased to exist, and Brno had ended up in Czechoslovakia. Defined according to its 1918 city limits, the city was predominantly German speaking, but several neighbouring municipalities had subsequently been concatenated into a new enlarged city area, as a result of which German speakers in Brno, such as the Laurenz family, were now a minority, albeit a very substantial minority. In 1924 Laurenz took a job as a contributing editor with the publishers of \\"Tageboten\\", while also moonlighting as a translator (from Czech to German), and sometimes obtaining work as a simultaneous court translator. He also worked as a correspondent for the Vienna-based Neue Freie Presse (newspaper) and the Ostrava-based \\"Morgen-Zeitung\\" (\\"Morning Newspaper\\"). Until 1939 Laurenz was a member of the German Democratic Liberal Party (\\"Deutsche Demokratische Freiheitspartei\\"; DDFP), founded in Czechoslovakia to preserve liberal political traditions on behalf of the German speaking minority. The party lost support after 1933, following the establishment of the more overtly nationalistic Sudeten German Party, but there is no sign that Laurenz himself defected from the DDFP as the political mood across Europe became progressively more shrill. In 1934, in a lead article that he wrote for the Neue Freie Presse, he condemned an attack by Nazi party supporters on a barracks in Brno, but otherwise he was for the most part apolitical. Even after the German invasion of 1938 Laurenz was not among the ethnic Germans who joined the Nazi party, and according to his own later testimony was reprimanded by the security services for his \\"lack of political sensitivity\\" (wegen \\"fehlendem politischem Fingerspitzengef√ºhl\\") and then, despite his physical unsuitability, conscripted into the military in 1941. Laurenz himself later placed his political position during the 1930s firmly in the context of his work as a translator kn the courts, which gave him deep insights into the political situation. With positive beliefs forfeited, he identified himself as a \\"pacificst multiculturalist\\" (als \\"pazifistischen Kosmopoliten\\"), acknowledging \\"just three gods\\": the law, justice and common sense.Stasi records under reference: BStU, MfS, AOP 57/56, Bl. 54 Laurenz was a Roman Catholic. He married on 28 February 1929, which resulted in the birth, in around 1930, of two daughters who ended up, after the war, in Vienna and subsequently with Laurenz's brother at Kirrlach near Karlsruhe.The Stasi records on Laurenz include a report dated 8 December 1952 entitled \\"Alles √ºber die Person\\" (\\"Personal details\\"): \\"[the suspect] remains in contact with his brother. He lives in Kirlach (sic) and often sends parcels containing medicines, cigars etc. to him and his wife.\\" =After the Second World War in the Soviet occupation zone= Following his conscription Laurenz had the good fortune not to be sent to the front line for several years, instead being assigned to work on the training of new recruits. Towards the end of the war, however, in February 1945 he was posted as a soldier to the western front: in April 1945 he deserted, ending up at Profen (south of Leipzig), where he was captured and was held for a few weeks as a US prisoner of war. Immediately after that he took a job in the coal industry, initially in Profen, and ending up, by the end of 1947, at the national head office of the Coal Department (\\"Zentralverwaltung Kohle\\") in Berlin. Since the war had ended, formally in May 1945, the entire central portion of what had been Germany had been administered as the Soviet occupation zone. In the early summer the US army, in the south of the country, had advanced into a region of Thuringia that had already been designated, by the allied commanders, as part of the Soviet occupation zone, but they had withdrawn in June 1945, leaving Laurenz in the region controlled by the Soviet military. In October 1949 the entire Soviet zone underwent a relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In economic and political terms the new country was closely modeled on the institutions of the Soviet Union itself. Internationally it was a member of the Soviet military bloc. Early in 1948 Laurenz became a member of the recently constructed Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), by now well on its way to becoming the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. In the course of his work in the National Coal Administration Department (\\"Zentralverwaltung Kohle\\") Laurenz became friendly with several female colleagues, including Elli Barczatis who after 1949 was employed as a secretary to the head of the \\"Coal Department\\", a political appointee called Gustav Sobottka. Towards the end of 1949 Laurenz and Barczatis became lovers. Elli Barczatis was six years younger than Laurenz, and was building a successful career inside the SED (party) and, after 1949, in the German Democratic Republic. She was widely liked and trusted by colleagues who appreciated her friendly but always correct manner. On 6 April 1950 she was promoted to a prestigious and sensitive job as secretary to Otto Grotewohl, the prime minister. In contrast, Laurenz's career was going into reverse. Full details are hard to discern, although much later, following his arrest, hints emerged of inappropriate conduct towards female colleagues. At the start of 1950 his employers sent him to take up a post in Leipzig as a legal advisor to the central Germany Trading Centre for solid fuels (\\"feste Brennstoffe\\" coal and lignite). Not wishing to leave Berlin, Laurenz looked for work in journalism. In February 1950 he took a job with Berlin Radio, but was sacked after two weeks. He then took work with the Berliner Verlag publishing house, but was sacked from this in August 1950. In 1950 he was expelled from the party for \\"conduct damaging to the party\\" (\\"parteisch√§digenden Verhaltens\\") and \\"deficient vigilance and bourgeois deviations\\" (\\"mangelnder Wachsamkeit und kleinb√ºrgerlicher Abweichungen\\"). One mistake was speaking out against a new law cancelling weekend bonus payments for truck drivers. In January 1951 Laurenz obtained work with a Berlin lawyer called Dr. Greffin which, as matters turned out, landed him in more trouble. Sources indicate that he was placed under surveillance from June 1951. In October 1951 he was accused of \\"favouring prisoners\\" because of legal advice that he was providing. This led to a five month prison term followed by an instruction never again to set foot in the German Democratic Republic. During this time the political and economic divisions that had been implicit in the division of Berlin into military occupation zones back in 1945 were beginning to be matched by physical impediments to free movement between East and West Berlin: on his release Laurenz established that Dr.Greffin had moved to West Berlin. Laurenz sought out Greffin and resumed working for him, albeit on a casual basis and without any fixed employment contract. It appears that after this point Laurenz no longer had any full-time employment. Frustrated, Laurenz became increasingly ambivalent in his attitude to the Eastern version of Germany, quietly becoming more positive about the German Federal Republic (West Germany). He linked up with Clemens Laby, a former colleague from their time together at the National Coal Administration Department.The name of Clemens Laby (22 November 1900 - ?) had still not been found in searches of the East German intelligence archives at the end of 2011. His name nevertheless cropped up in several East German criminal trials during the 1950s, where he is identified as a contact man for western intelligence. See also BStU-records MfS HA IX/Tb/2166-2188, MfS AOP 77/53,MfS AU 406/55 Laby had already relocated from East to West Berlin a few years before. Through Laby, Laurenz met a man called Schubert. Schubert and Laby were both working for the US sponsored Gehlen Organization, the forerunner of the West German Intelligence Service. There is speculation that \\"Schubert\\" was a cover name used by West Germany's \\"chief spy\\", Reinhard Gehlen himself. According to Laurenz's later testimony, Laby introduced Schubert as the head of \\"some West German intelligence service\\", and explained that they wished to recruit Laurenz. In return for a monthly payment of 400 Marks Laurenz would report on economic matters, politics and culture in East Germany. Military matters would be expressly excluded. By 1952, at the latest, Laurenz was working as a spy for the service, but without knowing precisely which secret service he was working for. Elli Barczatis, as the trusted secretary of Otto Grotewohl, enjoyed access to secret documents which she showed Laurenz in the belief that he needed them for his work as a journalist. In the files of West German intelligence the operation is identified with the cover name \\"Daisy\\" (\\"G√§nsebl√ºmchen\\"). In the files of the East German Ministry for State Security (\\"Stasi\\") the code name \\"Sylvester\\" is used. Over the years Laurenz was paid several thousand Marks, while Elli Barczatis received from her lover a string of gifts large and small, ranging from chocolates to a radio receiver. =Leisurely investigation= The authorities were already investigating Laurenz in 1951. Informers were recruited to report on Barczatis and her social circle, following her not merely in East Berlin but also West Berlin where she sometimes accompanied Laurenz for his meetings with his old drinking buddy, Laby. In-coming and out-going mail was scrutinised. From 27 March 1953 the Stasi reports use a cover name for Laurenz, identifying him as \\"Knesel\\". The reports on their movements were sometimes formidably detailed and precise in terms of times and places, and a certain amount of suspicious activity was reported as early as 1951, but until late in 1954 the investigators came up with little usable evidence. In the end the authorities set a trap. In November 1954 a hair was carefully attached to on a letter from Otto Grotewohl to the Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov. When the letter was inspected the next day, after it had passed through the hands of Barczatis, the hair had disappeared, which caused the investigators to suspect that someone had handled the letter far more thoroughly than would have been necessary merely to file it away: the inference was that someone - Barczatis - had removed the letter without authorisation and taken it home, filing it back in the correct safe the next day. Stasi investigators now set a series of further traps. Under judicial pressure at her subsequent trial, Barczatis confirmed that she had taken papers home in order to show them to Laurenz, but this was never proven. =Arrest and questioning= His arrest was originally scheduled for 8 December 1954, but was deferred. Reasons for the deferral unclear. In the end Laurenz was arrested at around 11.30 on 4 March 1955, close to his home at Vinetastra√üe 49 in Berlin-Pankow. Elli Barczatis was arrested some six hours later as she left her work. They were taken initially to the police station at Berlin-Lichtenberg. The next six months were spent held under investigatory detention at the Berlin-Hohensch√∂nhausen prison. Laurenz was interrogated by a Stasi officer called . Records indicate that he confessed early on, towards the end of March 1955, but then retracted his confession, comparing the tactics employed by the Stasi with those that he had evidently experienced at the hands of the Nazi security services and the Gestapo. The long hours of nocturnal interrogation broke him down. A routine was evolved whereby he underwent twelve hour interrogation sessions through the night, and was then sleep deprived during the hours of daylight. =Trial and execution= On 17 June 1955 the investigation was finally completed, with a recommendation to the court that the ensuing trial should be conducted in closed court. The trial, thought to have taken place in Berlin, was held on 23 September 1955. It is believed to have lasted approximately 13 hours and was recorded. A version of the recording, reduced to approximately 320 minutes, was found among the Stasi archives following the demise of the East German regime. presided over the Nbr. 1 Criminal bench (\\"1. Strafsenat\\") of the Supreme Court. BStU, ZA, MfS AU 406/55, Bl. 92: Er√∂ffnungsbeschlu√ü ‚ÄûTermin zur Hauptverhandlung ist auf den 23. September 1955, vorm. 9.00 Uhr anberaumt worden. Bl. [f√ºr Berlin], d. 16.9.1955‚Äú. Neither Barczatis nor Laurenz had any legal representation. Apart from the two of them, the court officers and the prosecutors, only Stasi officers were present in court. The original recommendation had been for life sentences, but the court condemned both defendants to death for \\"Boycott Agitation\\" under article ¬ß6 of the constitution. These were the eighth and ninth death sentences handed out by this court in 1955. President Pieck rejected an appeal for clemency on 11 November 1955. At around 3 in the morning on 23 November 1955 Laurenz was taken from his cell to the execution room at the National Execution Facility in Dresden and guillotined. Elli Barczatis was guillotined approximately ten minutes later. Other sources indicate that Barczatis was the first to be guillotined. The bodies were cremated.Staadt, Jochen: G√§nsebl√ºmchens Tod, in: Frankfurter Allgemeine 11 April 2001, Berliner Section, p. 3. Laurenz was posthumously rehabilitated by the Berlin district court on 28 November 2006.Landgericht Berlin, Gesch√§ftsnummer (551 Rh), 3 Js 322/06 (331/06). Further context and evaluation The East German media were not able to report specifically on the trial which was held behind closed doors \\"in camera\\". But they did report in more general terms a massive unmasking and the successful arrest of more than 1,000 \\"Gehlen spies\\". Most of these were, of course, not spies but political detainees. Contrasting assessments exist concerning the importance of Laurenz and Barczatis to western intelligence. Those who identify them as important sources take their lead from the former western intelligence chief, Reinhard Gehlen, who published his memoirs in 1971, describing Barczatis as \\"the first important link in the other part of Germany\\" (\\"der ersten wichtigen Verbindungen im anderen Teil Deutschlands\\"). He thanked her, posthumously, for her \\"committed and successful work\\" (\\"hingebungsvolle und erfolgreiche T√§tigkeit\\").Reinhard Gehlen: Der Dienst. Erinnerungen 1942-1971, M√ºnchen 1971, p. 201. Much subsequent comment has concluded that Gehlen, whose intelligence career had been widely discredited by the time he wrote his memoirs thanks, above all, to Heinz Felfe, had reasons of his own to emphasize any available positive aspects of the role played by the West German intelligence service during the early 1950s. Since the trial records have become available, it has become evident that many of the facts which the court concluded Barczatis had passed to Laurenz for onward transmission to his western handlers involved agenda items that could be found in the newspapers in both East and West Germany, concerning matters such as the scheduling of formal visits by Prime Minister Grotewohl. Possibly of more interest to western intelligence would have been information on economic and industrial matters, such as supply shortages of certain raw materials, or challenges involved in feeding the population, but here again, the espionage alleged seems to have been strangely trivial. The court gave close attention to a problem in which Grotewohl's office became involved that had arisen in Dresden in December 1953, when bakers had been unable to produce traditional Christmas bread because the authorities, ignorant of the special characteristics of Christmas bread in Dresden, had failed to provide sufficient raisins. Judge Helene Kleine, one of the panel of judges who had condemned Barczatis to death, was still alive in 1995, and was charged with manslaughter, false imprisonment and legal violations. The court determined that Kleine and her fellow judges had knowingly imposed disproportionately heavy penalties, and she was sentenced to a five-year jail term. The sentence was suspended, however.Berliner Zeitung: 31 March 1995: Wissentlich zu hohe Strafen verh√§ngt References 1905 births 1955 deaths People from Brno People from the Margraviate of Moravia Moravian-German people Socialist Unity Party of Germany members Federal Intelligence Service informants Masaryk University alumni People executed by East Germany by guillotine Executed spies ","title":"Karl Laurenz"},{"id":"51350762","text":"The Small Axe Project is an integrated publication undertaking devoted to Caribbean intellectual and artistic work, exercised over four platforms‚ÄîSmall Axe; sx salon, sx visualities, and sx archipelagos‚Äîeach with a different structure, medium, and practice.Small Axe Project official website.

She is known for her leadership of several important libraries in post- revolutionary Cuba, including those of the Junta Central de Planificaci√≥n (JUCEPLAN), Casa de las Am√©ricas, and the National Library Jos√© Mart√≠, as well as her role in the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). In these roles, she worked with well-known Cuban revolutionaries such as Che Guevara and Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a. Early life As a child, Terry Gonz√°lez helped her grandmother collect cigar butts after curfew so that her great-grandmother could smoke them in a pipe. She was homeschooled as a child due to her poor health. Her mother had died when she was young, so she was taught at home by her grandmother and her aunts, who worked as teachers. Several books left a strong early impression on her, including Coraz√≥n de Edmundo de Amicis and works by Jos√© Mart√≠. Education In 1948, Terry Gonz√°lez entered the University of Havana to study philosophy and literature. Her thesis for her master's degree was on the impact of chattel slavery on White society. In 1953, she visited the United States, where she experienced racial segregation in a Maryland restaurant. She saw American racial discrimination as puzzling and different from the anti-Black discrimination in Cuba. Professional work In 1961, Terry Gonz√°lez was appointed to lead the library at JUCEPLAN, the body responsible for economic planning in Cuba. In 1980, she was one of the first two Cuban librarians to attend an IFLA conference. Gonzalez was appointed National Librarian of Cuba and director of the Jos√© Mart√≠ National Library in 1987, serving in that capacity for ten years.

She is the John H. Ware 3rd Professor in Alzheimer's Research in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and Director of the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research and Co-director of the Marian S. Ware Alzheimer Drug Discovery Program. She was awarded the 2020 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. Life and career Lee was born in 1945 in Chongqing, Republic of China, and moved to Hong Kong with her family at age five. She received a Chinese education before moving to a high school with English as its language of instruction. Lee studied piano at the Royal Academy of Music in London (1962‚Äì1964), and then obtained an MS in Biochemistry from the University of London in 1968 and a PhD in Biochemistry from the University of California at San Francisco in 1973. She was a postdoctoral fellow at the Rudolf Magnus Institute of the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands (1973‚Äì1974) and at Children's Hospital Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston (1974‚Äì1979) where she met her husband, John Trojanowski. She then was appointed Associate Senior Research Investigator at Smith-Kline & French, Inc. (now called GlaxoSmithKline) in Philadelphia from 1979-1980. After not being able to pursue her passion in neuroscience, she joined the faculty of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania in 1981, attaining the rank of Professor in 1989. Here, she teamed up with Trojanowski to study brain samples for signs of disease. She also received an MBA in 1984 from the Executive MBA program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania just in case her research career was not successful. Lee and her husband currently oversee a lab with about 50 employees, publishing 15 to 20 studies per year.  Research  Dr. Lee‚Äôs research focuses on proteins that form pathological inclusions in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD), frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related neurodegenerative disorders. Her work demonstrated that tau, alpha- synuclein and TDP-43 proteins form unique inclusions in neurodegenerative diseases and that aggregation of these proteins is a common mechanistic theme in AD, PD, FTLD, ALS and related disorders. Significantly, Dr. Lee‚Äôs studies implicated the abnormal aggregation of tau, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 in mechanisms that compromise neuronal viability. Major accomplishments include discovery of tau, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 as the diseases proteins in AD, PD and ALS/FTD, respectively, elucidating the roles of these proteins in neurodegeneration, pursuing pathological tau as a target for AD and FTD drug discovery, and how the transmission of pathological tau and alpha-synuclein explains the progression of AD and PD. Most importantly, this research has opened up new avenues of research to identify targets for drug discovery to develop better treatments for these disorders. Because of the broad impact of her research, Dr. Lee‚Äôs h-index is 150 and she is listed among the 10 most highly cited AD researchers from 1985-2008 (JAD, 16:451-465, 2009) as well as among the top 400 most highly influential biomedical researchers from 1996-2011 (Eur J Clin Invest, 43:1339-1365, 2014).

Some of the over 1,000 songs he composed have become classics of Israeli folk music. Biography Nachum (Nakhche) Heiman was born in Riga, Latvia in 1934 to a musical family that immigrated to Mandatory Palestine when he was five years old. As a child he began playing the piano. After becoming ill with polio at the age of nine, he switched to playing the accordion and the harmonica. He was hospitalized for three and a half years in an iron lung until he recovered. At age 14, following his parents' divorce, he moved to Kibbutz Na'an as a yeled hutz (child from outside the kibbutz), where he studied with kibbutz members Yehuda Oren and composer David Zahavi. After his mother remarried, he moved with her to Rehovot, where he composed his first song, \\"Nitzanim niru ba'aretz\\" (text from the Song of Songs) at 17 years of age. Since he did not get along with his stepfather, he moved to Kfar HaMaccabi, where he met Matityahu Shalem from nearby Kibbutz Ramat Yohanan. He worked with Shalem as a shepherd and studied with him and his colleagues. Under the influence of Gurit Kadman, one of the pioneers of Israeli folk dance, Heiman began to work as an accordionist for folk-dancing events. In the army, Heiman coordinated song and dance classes and played the accordion for the first Nahal troupe. He fought in three wars and was wounded in all of them. When he married Dalia Colton, the mother of his two daughters ‚Äì Billie and Si, a well-known singer ‚Äì they moved to Kibbutz Beit Alpha. Heiman died in Meir Hospital in Kfar Saba on August 17, 2016 of a severe infection following prolonged ill health. He was 82. Music career Heiman worked as a music teacher and established the Gevatron choir. He composed dozens of songs for the poet Natan Yonatan, took young singers and bands under his wing in the 1960s, and wrote music for 122 films and TV shows. From the late 1960s to the mid-1980s he lived in Paris and London, where he ran a record company.He worked with singers such as Nana Mouskouri, Marie Lafor√™t, Serge Lama, Rika Zarai, Mike Brant, and Hanny Livne. In 1999, Heiman declared bankruptcy, but eventually repaid all his debts. In 2002, he established the Hebrew Song Heritage Association, a non-profit organization devoted to Israel's musical heritage. He devoted his time to restoring early Hebrew recordings, and served as the association's artistic director until his retirement in 2011. In 2009 he won the Israel Prize in the field of Hebrew song. In his latter years, twice divorced and separated from his third wife, Heiman suffered from ill health and financial hardship. A television feature about him prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and then-Culture Minister Limor Livnat to employ him as a consultant for a project to preserve and document Hebrew songs. A documentary of his life, made by Anat Goren, was aired in 2015 on Israel's Yes Docu channel.

The band's lineup currently consists of Nick Hartkop on guitar and vocals and his wife Emily Hartkop on bass. The band's early releases feature Hartkop performing solo and producing an acoustic dance-punk sound. In later recordings, following the addition of Graham, and subsequently Joecken and Easterly, the band has evolved to encompass a pop-punk and emo sound. Hartkop's wife, Emily, later joined the group as a bassist when Joecken did not return after their 2018 breakup. The band has notoriously gone through several breakups and reformations, most recently in February of 2020 where all remaining members left the band aside from Nick and Emily. History McCafferty was formed in 2011 and at the time was mainly a solo acoustic effort from singer-songwriter Nick Hartkop. In the same year, Hartkop self-released the EP Moms+Dads (2011) under the name McCafferty. The following year he released Japan (2012) and DanceBeats To Hurt Girls (2012). In 2013, he released three EPs ‚Äì I Hate This Body (2013), It's a Bad Idea (2013), and Forest Life (2013), as well as a collaborative live album, This Will Mean Nothing (2013), which featured tracks from Sam Rockwell and Chris Joecken (who at the time had not yet joined McCafferty). In late 2013, the band signed with Monkey Boy Records and released its first full-length LP, Beachboy (2013). In 2015 the band released two further EPs: When The Lightning Hit (2015) and Happy Birthday, Dad (2015). In 2016 the band started working on its second full-length LP, which was expected to be named Beachboy 2, but ultimately abandoned the project when Hartkop decided to disband the group and return to full-time work as a special education teacher. In late 2016, the band reformed after a successful fan-led crowdfunding effort to support the production of another EP, with the working title DanceBeats to Hurt Girls. The band signed a single album deal with Take This To Heart Records and released Thanks. Sorry. Sure. (2017) on June 30, 2017. On July 22, 2017, Thanks. Sorry. Sure. charted 23rd on Billboards top Independent albums and 5th on Heatseekers Albums and remained there for a week. On February 2, 2018, the band released a split EP alongside Heart Attack Man. On February 13, 2018, the band announced they had signed to Triple Crown Records, and that their second full-length album, Yarn, would be released on March 23, 2018. It was announced on April 1, 2018 that they cancelled their upcoming shows on their tour with Moose Blood. On June 25, 2018, Hartkop announced via the official McCafferty Twitter that he would be releasing a compilation record titled ‚ÄúThe Sum of All Fears‚Äù that would include all of the tracks from DanceBeats to Hurt Girls, It's a Bad Idea, When the Lightning Hit, I Hate This Body and more. These songs had previously not officially been released onto streaming services. The record was released on Spotify on June 28, 2018. An EP, Clementine, was released on August 11, along with an official announcement from the band regarding their permanent breakup. The band later reformed, without Joecken; Hartkop‚Äôs wife Emily Hartkop replaced Joecken on bass. On December 29, 2018, the band released Yarn: Commentary. It contains input from Wes Easterly, Evan Graham, and Nick Harktop about the influences and ideas behind the album. The band released their third album, The House With No Doorbell, on October 20, 2019. They released a single, \\"Fentanyl,\\" on June 18 ahead of the release of the album.

It is a Government Aided College also known as Sai Baba College.The College, named after Sri Shiridi Sai Baba, was established in October 1981 under the aegis of the Anantapur District National Education (ADNE) Trust, Anantapur founded by late Sri Sirivaram Adinarayana Rao in the year 1942. It is a voluntary organization comprising eminent persons from all walks of life, irrespective of caste or creed, all united in the sacred task of service to society in this backward and perpetually drought- affected area. The foremost aim of the Trust is to make quality education available to one and all at a very reasonable and affordable fee in the District in general and poor, underprivileged classes in rural and suburbs in particular. This august motto has been well served by all the successive Managements over the past six decades. This co-educational Institution had the unique honour of being inaugurated by Sri Bhavanam Venkatarami Reddy, the then honourable Minister for Education, Government of A.P. In October 1981, this Institution was started under able stewardship of the Late Dr. B.Purnachandra Rao as the Special Officer and the Late Sri P.Konappa Sastry, an eminent advocate, as the Correspondent. S.V. University, Tirupati granted affiliation at the first instance for six years and approved the Courses offered in the Institution. To start with, there were 500 Students, limited Staff, and a few Courses spread over the different faculties of History, Economics, Commerce, Political science, Botany, Zoology, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. Under the leadership of the Correspondent and the Special Officer, the first All Association Day was celebrated in February 1983. In keeping with the motto of service to society, the first NSS unit was also started during this period and the Late Dr. G.L.N. Murthy, Reader in Commerce, was the first Programme Officer. In the year 1984, Dr. K.V.S. Prasad assumed the office of Principal- in-Charge and the Late Sri K.S.Jayaram was the pro tem Correspondent. Dr. K.V.S. Prasad was elevated to the position of Principal in 1992. Sri P.L.N. Reddy, who was, an experienced Correspondent for both the High School and Junior College for two decades, took of the charge from Sri K.S.Jayaram as the Correspondent of the Degree College in the year 1985. It is also worth mentioning the name of Sri Meda Subramanyam, an eminent Advocate and Tax Consultant of the town and the present Secretary and Ex-Correspondent of the College, who has always associated himself with the allround development of the Institution with great gusto and pleasure. He has been with Sri P.L.N.Reddy to make this Institution achieve laurels. Dr. K.V.S. Prasad, the first Principal of the Institution, served over a long period of two decades. There was a rapid expansion of buildings year by year with required infrastructure and increase in the intake of the students. Introduction of self-financing Courses and multidisciplinary Courses in B.Sc. (Microbiology, Biochemistry, Electronics and Computer Sciences) and B.Com. (Computer Applications) are the order of the day. A strong and sturdy foundation was laid for the training of leadership. Dr. K.V.S. Prasad's concern for the student community was deep and he was completely identified himself with the College. IGNOU Study Centre was started in 1988 with strength of 50. It provides opportunities for employees to acquire higher academic qualifications. The Study Centre has grown by leaps and bonds since then. Many Students are pursuing different Undergraduate and Postgraduate Courses and Diploma and Certificate Courses at SSBN College Study Centre through IGNOU. Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati, granted the College permanent affiliation in the year 1987. Later, in the year 1988, the affiliation of the College was changed from S.V. University, Tirupati to Sri Krishnadevaraya University, Anantapur. The Govt. of A.P. was pleased to admit this College to grant-in-aid in 1990 with munificent help of Sri N.Janardhana Reddy, the then Chief Minister of A.P with whom Sri P.L.N.Reddy, our Correspondent, is associated as a member of the syndicate Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati for over a decade. In January 1992, this Institution was admitted under Sec. 2(f), and Sec.12 (b) of the U.G.C Act, 1956. PG Diploma in Computer Applications and M.Sc. (IS) were introduced in 2001. Apart from the improvement and addition of new Courses, there was a distinct touch of moral purity and elevation given to the academic atmosphere during the regime of D.r.K.V.S.Prasad, who set an example of uprightness and gentleness. Dr.K.Nirmalamma, the first women Principal of this illustrious Institution assumed office in July 2002 The College has been a hallmark for quality education all these 25 years. The College offers diversified modern self- financing Courses suitable to changed circumstances. Yet, the traditional Courses are equally intact and doing excellent service. It has achieved a vertical quantum of leap with the introduction of PG Courses and a couple of Certificate Courses. It is planned that this College will have more modern PG Courses before the end of the present decade. The student strength has increased enormously. Yet, \\"quality is the key word\\".

He served in the Napoleonic Wars, although he is perhaps most noted for his archaeological work surrounding the Battle of Agincourt in 1818. Despite this, he played a large role in military reform before his retirement in 1841. Woodford is also said by some sources (Medieval Dead with Tim Sutherland) to have been the last living British officer to have served at the Battle of Waterloo upon his death. Life =Early life and family= Born the son of Lieutenant-Colonel John Woodford and Lady Susan Gordan (daughter of Cosmo Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon), Woodford was the younger brother of his fellow officer Field-Marshal Sir Alexander George Woodford. Woodford also had three half-sisters: Susan Drummond, Elizabeth Lowther, and Lady Mary Fludyer. He was educated at Harrow under Joseph Drury. The foundations of his military career started in 1800, when he was sent to Brunswick, which was at the time in a personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain, due to the accession of the Elector of Hanover as King George I in 1714. =Military career= William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensberry, who befriended Woodford Granted a commission as an ensign in the first regiment of the Grenadier Guards by the Duke of Gloucester in May 1800, Woodford finished his time training in Brunswick before his return to Great Britain to join his regiment in 1801. Upon his return, he was befriended by William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensberry, who presented him with a fine horse and led him to the King at Windsor. This friendship proved fortunate, as Douglas left him ¬£10,000 in 1810. Although Woodford joined the regiment in 1801, he did not see active service until 1807, when he was involved in the Battle of Copenhagen. Following this, in 1808, he was sent to the Peninsula under the command of Sir David Baird to join with the forces of Sir John Moore. Here, Woodford was appointed deputy-assistant quartermaster-general and aide-de-camp to Moore. Involved in the retreat to Corunna, it is said that Woodford's heel was injured by the last shot fired in the Battle of Corunna at dusk. As a result of this, Woodford was unfit for military service for eighteen months until he was able to join the Duke of Wellington's army, which had just crossed the Ebro. Woodford continued his previous roles and was a participant in numerous battles, including Nivelle, Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse. In 1813, Woodford had purchased a captaincy in the first regiment of the Grenadier Guards. Upon the return of Napoleon in 1815, Woodford served in the fourth division under Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Colville as a lieutenant-colonel in the 1st Foot Guards. This division was detailed to support Prince Frederick of the Netherlands on the road to Halle. However, Woodford was dispatched by Colville to Wellington for orders. Arriving in the early morning, Wellington ordered Woodford to remain by his side as an aide-de-camp due to the imminence of the battle. Some sources (Medieval Dead with Tim Sutherland) state that Woodford was the last living British officer to have fought at Waterloo. Following the battle, Woodford continued to serve under Colville and assisted in the occupation of Cambrai. In 1818, Woodford was appointed to the command of the Army of the Occupation in France until its withdrawal in October of that year. Woodford was made a C.B. in 1815. Archaeological work at Agincourt Map of the Battle of Agincourt During his time as the commander of the Army of the Occupation in France, Woodford engaged in archaeological excavations on the supposed site of the Battle of Agincourt. During these excavations, Woodford found numerous artifacts, and these finds were reported by newspapers at the times, including the Caledonian Mercury on 25 May 1818 and The Morning Chronicle on 20 April 1818. They included bones, arrow-heads and upwards of sixty coins. One such coin was in a high state of preservation,https://apps.warwickshire.gov.uk/api/documents/WCCC-863-398 on the one side the arms of France and the inscription Karolus Dei Gracia Francorum Rex (translated from Latin as Charles, by God's Grace, King of the French) and on the reverse PC Regnat, PC Imperat ('PC' standing for the Latin per Christum, 'regnat' for 'reign' or 'rule' and 'imperat' for 'command', 'rule' or 'impose'). Fragments of iron, two lance-heads (one six, the other eight inches long), a spur, buckles, 'other insignia of the fray' and several rings. These rings, some of which were gold, had inscriptions on them, and were thought to be pledges, which were 'given to the Knights by their fair Dames, on departing to the wars'. One ring is enamelled and on the outside has the words pleine amitie (roughly translated from French as 'solid friendship') and inside a flower like a rose, with 'belle' after it. It is thought this could create the name of a lady, Rosabelle. Another ring, made of brass, was found with a finger bone sticking in it. Unfortunately, the present-day locations of these finds are unknown. Records of the excavations and the finds exist in Woodford's letters to his brother, Alexander, which was preserved in the Nachla√ü of the English politician Roger Newdigate (1719‚Äì1806). These letters also include illustrations of certain finds, namely a coin and an arrow-head. Alongside the discoveries, there is also thought to have existed a diary, although it is suspected this may have been lost in a fire at an establishment on Belgrave Square called the Pantechnicon, which gave its name to the van, in 1874 or 1876. Whilst excavating, Woodford received considerable hostility from the local French, who considered Woodford to be desecrating the graves of the war-dead to conduct a celebration commemorating the English victory. This appears to have been little but spin, as the letters highlight Woodford's intention to re-bury any dead which he found in consecrated ground ‚Äì this he did, as there is reported to be several dead from Azincourt buried in the local church under an etching in the wall that reads '1838'. Military reform Derwent Water, the retirement destination of Woodford Following the Napoleonic Wars and the excavations at Azincourt, Woodford returned home and in 1821 was given command of the third battalion of the Grenadier Guards in Dublin. He became a colonel on 23 November 1823. Under his command, he forbade flogging in the battalion and on 26 May 1830, banned standing under arms as a punishment. In 1835, Woodford published a pamphlet entitled Remarks on Military Flogging: its Causes and Effects, with some Considerations on the Propriety of its entire Abolition. In this, he recommended recreation for soldiers in barracks, the establishment of carpenters' shops, et cetera, to teach the men useful trades in addition to the establishment of regimental libraries. These reforms met the disapproval of Wellington and the King, William IV, although they remained in place. In part due to Woodford's advocacy, the purchase of commissions and the stock were abolished in 1871 (Cardwell Reforms) and 1855 respectively. =Retirement and later life= In 1841, in the will of his aunt, Lady Frances Gordon, wife of Lord William Gordon and daughter of Charles Ingram, 9th Viscount of Irvine, Woodford received an estate on the western bank of Derwent Water, which included Waterend House. Issuing his last regimental order on 10 January 1837, he was promoted to the rank of major-general and retired from service in October 1841. Woodford was made a K.C.B. in 1838. Due to his belief that the purchase of commissions should be abolished, Woodford sold his commission to the government for ¬£4,500, half of its market value. Throughout the rest of his long retirement, Woodford surrounded himself with rare books and curiosities in addition to antiquarian research. He was said to have been a good linguist and lived life in retirement in a soldierly-manner as if still in camp. He died on 22 March 1879 in Keswick.

It has a mix of 2D and 3D CGI animation. It is a sequel of the original anime, whereas Tiger Mask II is only considered a parallel universe.  Plot  Over forty years since Naoto Date left forever Japan, the Global Wrestling Monopoly (GWM) challenged the Zipangu Pro-Wrestling team and single- handedly destroyed them along with their manager Daisuke Fuji who was brutally defeated by GWM's top fighter Yellow Devil. The incident drove two young members, Naoto Azuma, the main protagonist of the series, and his friend Takuma Fuji, son of Daisuke, to seek revenge on the GWM and the two parted ways without. While Naoto trained under Kentaro Takaoka, Naoto Date's former ally, Takuma trained under the Tiger's Den, under the leadership of Mister X, after being recruited by Yellow Devil under the pretense of giving him the chance for revenge. Three years later, Naoto has taken the identity of Tiger Mask and signing under the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) while Takuma has taken on the identity of Tiger the Dark under the Tiger's Den with none of them being aware of the other's identity but sharing the same goal. The GWM under the leadership of Miss X, sees the new Tiger Mask as a threat that must be eliminated to ensure their control over the Wrestling World and sends their fighters in several schemes to destroy him. Tiger Mask trains with the help of his current trainer and the aid of several pro wrestlers to become a stronger fighter with the ultimate goal to fight and defeat Yellow Devil. Both he and Takuma have their first chance at the Masked Tournament hosted in Miss X's new Max Dome, their first step on conquering Japan, and hosting none other than Yellow Devil as one of the participants. Tiger Mask with the advice of an Indian wrestler Mister Question, and an opponent in the tournament, decides to develop his own signature technique and trains with his co-workers at the NJPW to develop his technique. He eventually fights and defeats Takuma using an unperfected version of the move, and manages to face and defeat Yellow Devil but much to his surprise finds another man to have taken on its identity leaving Naoto's and Takuma's quest inconclusive but with the revelation to Takuma that Tiger Mask is also looking after Yellow Devil. Takuma is eventually demoted to undergo the Tiger's Execution which would make him a living punching bag, but decides to take the Hell in the Hole an illegal wrestling match with several bets carrying a special chance which can restore him as a main fighter but at the risk of losing his life if he fails. The Hell in the Hole begins with its participants being wrestlers defeated by Tiger Mask, including Odin, Billy the Kidman, Black Python, Death Red Mask, as well as Ricardo, Cox, Phantom, Takuma, and Kevin, Takuma's friend, the fight is a Battle Royale with no rules, wrestlers are given weapons after defeating contestants and alliances are possible too. Takuma and Kevin team up and eventually prevail over Odin, Billy the Kidman and Red Death Mask while the rest were eliminated. Takuma and Kevin are forced to fight a \\"gatekeeper\\" to gain their escape, but the wrestler is found to be a powerful robot. Odin regains conscience and aids the duo using a firebreath tool on the robot's face which causes it to malfunction and assault the nearby spectators. The strongest wrestler of the Tiger's Den, The Third, faces and easily defeats the robot with a piledriver. Takuma, Kevin and Odin thus succeed in the Hell in the Hole, but Odin quits the GWM. The GWM then prepares their next big tournament, Wrestle Max War Game, which will pit wrestlers from all around the world for the right to challenge The Third who is the World Heavyweight Champion for the belt and the title and a Million Dollar Prize. The Third will also participate on the event himself. Naoto decides to enter the tournament in order to become champion as it will allow him to select his opponents and as such be able to force the true Yellow Devil out of hiding. Thinking that the battle may not play out one-on-one Naoto decides to request Fukuwara Mask to partner with him to increase his odds at winning. The day of the War Game begins and the rules are explained, the wrestlers will fight in a pyramid- shaped ring with five stages and a ground level, they are divided in four blocks which are interconnected and when the ring sounds, they will be able to move between blocks. Once a wrestler defeats an opponent, he will be allowed to move to the next stage, where he fights his next opponent, and repeat the process until the first two fighters are standing at the top stage of the ring, at which point the battle is over. Following an interval the two combatants will fight and the winner earns the right to challenge The Third. The Champion, being one of the participants declares that whoever defeats him can take the belt. Surprisingly a man taking the name of Yellow Devil is also a participant, causing Naoto and Takuma to pursue him. The fights rage and Takuma finds and easily defeats Yellow Devil, unmasking him as an impostor. The Third faces Ryu Wakamatsu in his Dragon Young persona, Fukuwara Mask and Tetsuya Naito making him the first fighter to get to the top. Tiger Mask and Tiger the Dark face off once more with the fight being even grounded. Tiger Mask uses his Tiger Drive move, but Takuma is able to counter it at the last moment. Before Naoto and Takuma can resume their fight Kevin interferes and ambushes Naoto, allowing Takuma to defeat him, thus Tiger the Dark is able to challenge The Third for the championship. A recess takes place before the fight but Takuma is revealed to be greatly injured as a result of Naoto's knee strike. Before his match, Takuma is alerted that The Third is potentially the true Yellow Devil, in order to confirm it he bests his mask with The Third which he accepts. The match begins and Takuma seemingly gains the upper hand. The Third then confirms Takuma's suspicions that he's indeed Yellow Devil by using his old signature techniques. Takuma is able to counter his Devil's Crush and almost defeats The Third. However the injuries caused by Naoto take his toll and The Third uses his true finishing move Sacrifice, greatly injuring Takuma and causing his defeat. The Third then unmasks Takuma, revealing his identity to Naoto who rushes to his friend's side revealing his own identity as well as he's transported to the hospital. A mysterious band of wrestlers calling themselves the Miracles 1, 2 and 3 appear and sabotage several of NJPW matches by committing fouls, while promising to keep \\"multiplying\\". After Tiger Mask battles one of GWM's strongest fighters, King Tiger and defeats him in a deadly fight, Miss X agrees to let Tiger Mask challenge The Third bound by a contract that forces him to betray the NJPW and align himself with the Miracles. As the battles escalate, Tiger Mask desperate to get his match with The Third sinks to commit fouls along with the Miracles in the matches, which corrodes his reputation. During a final encounter between the Miracles and the NJPW in a 5-on-5 match, Tiger Mask is cruelly used as a tool in order to secure a victory against Okada, NJPW's strongest wrestler. Before the NJPW is able to win against the Miracles, The Third and Miss X interrupt the match. Tiger Mask attempts to attack The Third but is easily countered. Miss X then announces the Final Wars, the ultimate confrontation between the NJPW and the GWM, where the winner will take all the belts from the losers, effectively making it an all or nothing match. Nagata reluctantly accepts the challenge. Meanwhile, Tiger Mask is struggling as his recent actions have eroded his trust with the NJPW, leaving him alone and still bound to the GWM by contract, despite his assault against The Third. As a result, he is forced by Miss X to fight Miracle 4 in another match. Miracle 4 reveals himself to be Universal Mask, an expert in aerial combat while the two fight in a special ring elevated from the floor level and with pipes, giving Universal Mask a one-sided advantage, which is meant to punish Tiger Mask for his betrayal. Tiger Mask eventually defeats him thanks to Fukuwara Mask's advice, but has difficulties in developing a new killer move. Tiger Mask decides to go to Kyoto in order to gain inspiration for a killer move from the Arashi Dojo, just like Naoto Date did at one point. However he comes to find two Dojos with one being a fake. Tiger Mask helps unravel the impostor and gains useful advice from the true master, but is still not sufficient knowledge. The Final Wars begin between the NJPW and GWM. During the first fight NJPW gains an advantage but Miracle 3 interferes, causing Tiger Mask to intercept the Miracles' foul combo and rendering the match a no contest. Immediately after as per the contract with the GWM, Tiger Mask is forced to fight on final fight against Miracle 3 who is GWM's coach O'Connor in a Lumberjack match where, any fighter outside the ring must be returned by seconds. However the match becomes vicious quick as Miracle 3 continuously pushes Tiger outside the ring, to be mercilessly punished by GWM's seconds, effectively making it a 4 on 1 fight. Having regained their trust, the NJPW interferes on Tiger Mask's behalf allowing him to defeat Miracle 3 and reform their alliance. After losing two fights against NJPW, Tiger's Den sends on their strongest reinforcements, Big Tiger the Second or The Second, and Tiger the Black two wrestlers part of Tiger's Den Four Heavenly Kings, also called the Four Tigers along with the previously defeated King Tiger, whose strength is only surpassed by The Third. A tag match is scheduled with The Second and Tiger the Black against Tiger Mask and Nagata. The NJPW pair however is soundly defeated and Nagata is left injured by The Second. Takuma requests Naoto to allow him to use his training him to accelerate his recovery and Takaoka agrees. The Final Wars begin consisting of five different matches. The first one ends in a draw between Tiger the Black and Makabe as they are both counted out of the ring. The second match is a double tag-match with Tiger the Black and The Third vs Makabe and Okada. Makabe is able to leave Tiger the Black unconscious but is himself crippled by The Third's Devil Crush earning GWM a win. On the next round a triple tag-match, The Second, Miracle 1 and 2 face Tanahashi, Tiger Mask and Tiger the Dark who joins NJPW. During the fight Miracle 2 unmasks himself as Kevin and battles Takuma until he is left unconscious by Tiger Mask's new killer move Tiger Fang, however The Second defeats Tanahashi with his Skewer move, granting GWM a second win. The following round is a double tag-match of Tiger Mask and Tiger the Dark vs The Third and The Second. During the fight The Third unmasks Naoto by ripping his mask. Tiger the Dark with renewed strength from his father's encouragement assaults The Third and The Second with his new killer move, Crossbow, injuring them both and allowing Naoto to defeat The Second earning NJPW a win. For the fifth, single match Miracle 1 faces NJPW's champion Okada, however Miracle 1 blinds Okada by spitting a substance on his face. Okada defeats Miracle 1 but his arm is injured so Naoto fights with a new patched mask under the name Tiger Mask W to face The Third. The two fight with Naoto combining his own moves along Takuma's, although effective The Third severely injures Naoto with a chain of Devil's Tornadoes. Attempting to defeat him with the Devil's Crush, the move fails and Naoto counters and injures The Third. The two clash for a final time but The Third's arm begins to hurt causing him to be unable to counter Naoto's Tiger Fang. The Third is instantly defeated which causes the destruction of the Tiger's Den. Naoto and Takuma part ways deciding to fight abroad using new masks made of a combination of their former masks and calling themselves Tiger Mask W. They vowed to meet each other again in the ring either as a tag team or as opponents. Following Naoto and Takuma's depart, Miss X now founding and leading her own organization, Girls Wrestling Movement, recruits Haruna Takaoka to serve as her main fighter under her Spring Tiger, later Springer, alter ego, along with her friends Milk and Mint. Although Haruna is initially reluctant to pursue a wrestling career due to Yoko Takaoka's disapproval, who is against it because the truth about her older brother's tragedy made her mother despise the sport she had always revered as a child, after a month later fighting and defeating Japan's strongest female wrestler, Mother Devil, along with Miss X's encouragement, she builds up the courage needed to tell her family.

This program dubbed the ‚ÄúOTC NOX Budget Program‚Äù set a cap for NOX emissions from nine states and the District of Columbia, which was ratcheted down in three phases, starting in 1995, 1999, and 2003, respectively. During this process a larger group of states in the Eastern United States and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began meeting as the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG). Their work wound up being adopted by EPA as a trading program NOX trading program that covered a larger geography (22 states plus the District of Columbia) called the \\"NOX SIP Call\\" and the third phase of the OTC NOX Budget Program was incorporated into that larger trading program.

Influenced by Auguste Comte, Henri Bergson, and Francisco Romero, she addressed questions related to individual experience and its assimilation or transcendence. Education Marjorie Harris was born in 1890 in Wethersfield, Connecticut, to Elizabeth Mills Harris and George Wells Harris. She attended Mount Holyoke College, receiving her B.A. in 1913. She went on to complete a doctorate in philosophy at Cornell University (1921), where she was awarded the Susan Linn Sage Scholarship. Her dissertation was on the French philosopher Auguste Comte. Career Harris taught briefly at the University of Colorado (1921‚Äì22), but the bulk of her academic career was spent at Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Virginia (1922‚Äì58), where she rose to be a full professor and chair of the Philosophy Department. From 1934 onward, she was an emerita professor at the college. Harris wrote principally on the French philosophers Comte and Henri Bergson and the Latin-American philosopher Francisco Romero. A major theme of her writing is the role of philosophy in illuminating what is significant in an individual life, and here she shows the influence of Bergson's conception of 'life' as well as John Dewey's pragmatism. The title of one of her books, Sub Specie Aeternitatis (1937, 'from the perspective of eternity'), makes visible her concern to connect what is (or may be) universally true with the individual experiences that fall within our often narrow perceptions. She is much concerned with how the human quest for truth and meaning in a life are shaped by our notions of experience, transcendence (as developed by Romero), freedom, and will. One of her lines of argument holds that a satisfactory life requires a certain degree of detachment as well as the ability to resist trying to organize all experience through rigid and predetermined categories. Harris was a member of numerous professional organizations, including the American Philosophical Association. She died in 1976 in Rocky Hill, Connecticut.

He died at 81 years old in Houston, Texas.  Early life  Harrison was born to Lullelia Walker Harrison and Alexander Crystal Harrison in Gary, Indiana. Harrison was raised in Houston, Texas after his family moved there in 1933. He had one older brother, Alexander Crystal Harrison II. Harrison's father was a small business operator as well as the regional manager of General Foods, Inc. His mother was an educator, civil rights activist, author, and community servant to many volunteer organizations. Her civil rights efforts included her assistance in establishing the Texas State University of Negroes and the Thurgood Marshall School of Law.

It is a dome located in Rizal Park between the Japanese Garden and Chinese Garden on Padre Burgos Avenue in the central district of Ermita. It opened on October 8, 1975, and has been in operation since then. History The building of a space museum in Rizal Park was proposed by Philippine Weather Bureau chief and Philippine Astronomical Society founder Maximo Sacro Jr. to National Museum Director Godofredo Alcasid Sr. in 1970. It was presented to then National Parks and Development Committee chair and First Lady Imelda Marcos who approved the project and immediately instructed the Bureau of Public Works to prepare plans for the building. Construction of the building began in 1974 with help from Japanese engineers. The planetarium cost US$100,000 to build with funding provided by the Japanese government as part of its war reparation to the Philippines. Presidential Decree No. 804-A was signed by then President Ferdinand Marcos on September 30, 1975 which formally established the National Planetarium. The building was formally inaugurated on October 8, 1975 with Maximo Sacro Jr. as its first curator. Museum exhibits and facilities The National Planetarium is high and has a seating capacity of 310. It is equipped with a GM-15-S Goto starball projector acquired since 1975.

Biographical details Shumiatcher was born on October 21, 1896 in Gomel to parents Judah and Chasia as one of eleven siblings. (Katz gives her birth year as 1899.) She and her family emigrated to Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1911. All members of the family worked to support the household; they also had boarders in their house. Shumiatcher worked as a waitress and at a meat-packing plant until 1918, when she met and married Peretz Hirschbein, a New York Yiddish playwright, when he was on tour in Calgary. Shumiatcher had her son, Omus, in 1934 in New York. He would grow to become a prominent concert producer. Shumiatcher moved to Los Angeles in 1940 where her husband had an offer to write film scripts, of which one was produced. Her husband died in 1948 from lateral sclerosis, after which Shumiatcher primarily gave lectures. She eventually moved back to New York, where she died in 1985. Career Herschbein exposed Shumiatcher to the Yiddish literary community, which inspired her to start writing in Yiddish as well. The couple settled in New York, but traveled extensively around the world, going through places such as the South Pacific, Asia, and Eastern Europe. In the 1920s they lived in Warsaw, Poland, where Shumiatcher's poetry was well received and published in modernist journals of the time. One such journal based in Berlin took its name, Albatros, from one of her poems. Shumiatcher wrote groundbreaking poems addressing pregnancy and motherhood following the birth of Omus. She also wrote about widowhood and grief following her husband's death. Other themes reflected eros, nature, and politics. Although she did not write much after 1956, her later works are more highly regarded. Some of her poetry has been translated by Myra Mniewski. She appears in Ezra Kerman's anthology of Yiddish female poets and is included among a group of Litvak women poets whom Dovid Katz credits with \\"building\\" Yiddish poetry outside Eastern Europe.

The stone church was built in the 11th century, and the pre-Norman patrons were either the U√≠ Briuin Cualann or the √ì Ceallaigh of U√≠ Teigh. In the Norman period, Kilcroney is mentioned in records of 1280, 1285 and 1305. It later returned to Gaelic Irish possession when the √ì Tuathail (O'Tooles) took over the area. In 1533, it was mentioned that Kilcroney was a chapel of the larger local church at Stagonyll (Powerscourt). Other records claim it was a possession of St. Mary's Abbey, Dublin. The church was extended in the late medieval period, and in the modern period there has been some restoration, with the walls being propped up.

Considering its importance in historical, architectural and anthropological facets, the Archaeological Department has declared the Devalaya as an protected monument in the country. Nawagamuwa also inherits archeological sites that dates back to BC period as per archaeological research conducted in the area. The Devalaya is popular among the masses for its miracles and to receive the blessings of the goddess Pattini. Legends The legend has it that King Gajabahu I (114‚àí136) on his return from India victoriously with 12,000 men as prisoners, also brought with him the Pattini anklet. The king built the Devalaya enshrining the Pattini anklet at a place where he stopped to rest on his return to Anuradapuara. A different presentation of the legend says that the Goddess Pattini came from India with 12,000 devotees form 16 castes and settled in this area. History Verifiable historical evidence about the Devalaya emerge during the Kotte period. The area was then known as Hewagam Korale, according to Rajaveliya. Excavations around the Devale from time to time unearthed building materials, wells, Dutch coins and iron implements of the Middle Ages. North of the old Devalaya at what was known as the old landing place, coins used during the Dutch period in Ceylon, 1554‚Äì1765, have been found. Significant events took place during Kotte Period * Inauguration of Hewagam Korale by King Rajasinha I of Sitawaka as a gratitude to the soldiers of Hewagama who fought with him against the Portuguese in Battle of Mulleriyawa. * Godagama Sannasa mentions about the gift of oil presented to Nawagamuwa Pattini Perahera by the King Buwanekabahu V (1521‚Äì1580) * King Mayadunne of Sitawaka (1521‚Äì1580) had stopped at the Nawagamuwa Pattini Devale to make a vow before he went to war with the Portuguese in the Colombo Fort. * Portuguese records reveal that, in 1550, the king of Portugal sent 600 troops to help Bhuvanaikabahu VII of Kotte. They clashed with King Mayadunne at Nawagamuwa. * In 1576, the Portuguese records says that they made a military establishment on the place after destroying the Devalaya. * King Mayadunne recaptured the lost land and rebuilt the Devalaya. * The Captain of the Colombo Fort, again destroyed the Devalaya and leaving a pile of ruins. Festivals  The major festival of the Nawagamuwa Pattini devalaya is the ‚ÄòGonpita Perahera‚Äô held in the month of August every year. This traditional ceremony has been conducted for the past 1500 years in honour of Goddess Pattini, to invoke blessings on the village. The villages rear white bulls exclusively to take part in the annual Perahera Festival. Restorations Archeological research has revealed that there are buildings in Nawagamuwa Devalaya premises belonging to both the Kotte Period and the 19th century. The 19th-century restorations and buildings were done by Katuwawala Sri Sumanatissa Thero, the chief priest of the temple during 1813‚Äì1928. After constructing the Galkanu devale, Sri Sumanatissa Himi constructed the monks' abode or Sanghavasaya and the Vihare or Pilimage in 1894. After the restoration of the Devalaya in the 1813‚Äì1928 period, the Devalaya has not had any restoration until the New Millennium. In 2016, nearly 100 years later, the Devalaya went through a complete restoration, under the guidance of the Department of Archeology. The restoration includes, wood-work using the exact type of Jak trees (that yielded honey-sweet fruits) used by original builders, in addition to copper sheet roofing and granite flooring. The restoration cost 30 million rupees to complete. The project was funded by the Nandana Lokuwithana Foundation.http://srinews.lk/sinhala_news_page.php?id=63&type;=Art With the new renovation project, a life-size marble statue of Goddess Paththini was brought from India to Nawagamuwa.

His parents were Francis Oats (1794‚Äì1871) and Maria Rundle (1810‚Äì97). His father was a farmer. His younger sister Maria was born in 1850. The family moved to St Just in Penwith, a mining district, about 1854. Like most young men in the district Oats became a miner when he left school, but every week he would walk to Penzance, seven miles away, to attend evening classes so he could become a mining engineer. At the age of 17, Oats placed second in the mineralogy examination for the British Isles, and obtained a high grade in mining, a subject in which he had not been instructed. He was offered free tuition at the London School of Mines but would have to pay his expenses, and no scholarship was available. Francis Oats was first appointed Mine Agent in 1871. He was mining captain at Botallack Mine. For a while Oats also gave science classes in the Botallack district. He married Elizabeth Ann Olds on 17 August 1874, in St Just in Penwith, daughter of a butcher. Two of their children died in infancy. Their surviving children were Francis Freathey (b. 1879), Wilfred (b. 1883), Giles (b. 1885) and Marie Elise (b. 1887). South Africa =Government mines inspector= On 9 December 1874, Oats was appointed Cape Colony Government Mining Engineer at Kimberley, South Africa, at the age of 26. Oats left for South Africa on a 20-month mission in January 1875. The colony's government had recently passed ordinances in favour of small miners which prevented mine concession owners from imposing excessive rentals on the diggers and shopkeepers, and did not allow an individual or company to hold more than ten claims. The British government had overridden some of these measures. The proprietors continued to accumulate claims and raise rents, causing mounting unrest. Oats, as Provincial Engineer, gave the decisive opinion that \\"fostering a large number of individual holdings is most adverse to economy of working. Oats made it clear that the restriction on the number of claims would be an obstacle to obtaining foreign capital. He wrote of the 10 claim limit, Oats resumed his position at Botallack as soon as he returned. =Mining executive= The Big Hole (Kimberley Mine) in 1886 In May 1877 Oats was asked to take a position in Kimberley, which he accepted. The job was to run the Kimberley mines for Baring-Gould and Atkins Co. In 1883, he joined the Victoria Mine company. De Beers Mining, headed by Cecil Rhodes, obtained control of Victoria company in 1887 using financing from Stow and Jules Porges & Co., who began quiet purchases of Victoria shares early in 1887, and obtained most of its share capital for ¬£57,000. On learning this and that the Victoria claims were surrounded by De Beers mergers, Oats and R. Hinrichson, directors of Victoria, agreed to amalgamate in April 1887 in exchange for scrip and stock with nominal value of ¬£445,000 plus other assets. Both Oats and Hinrichson became directors of De Beers. By the start of 1890, De Beers had an effective monopoly on the South African diamond trade. The poorer mines had been closed and production reduced to push up the price of diamonds. The Wesselton Mine was discovered late in 1890. The De Beers directors were unwilling to buy the mine, but were reluctantly persuaded after Oats had investigated it and described the damage it could do to diamond prices. Searchlight at the Wesselton Mine during the Siege of Kimberley (1899) There were many Cornish miners at Kimberley, particularly as the mines became deeper and their skills in mining hard rock became more important. Oats did his best for these miners. He insisted that De Beers give each miner a yearly paid holiday in Cornwall. He also forced adoption of water hydrants to lay the dust created by mining drills, the main cause of silicosis. He became president of the Cornish Association at Kimberley. Oats was elected to represent Namaqualand in the South African parliament, holding office until 1907. During the Second Boer War in 1899, Oats was a member of the Civilian Defence Force. In 1901, Francis Oats and his son Francis Freathy Oats visited South America. Oats became known as an authority on diamonds. In December 1906 Oats visited Henri Lemoine in Paris with three others, and saw Lemoine (stark naked to show he had nothing hidden) mix substances in a crucible, heat it in a huge furnace, and produce tiny diamonds. Oats demanded repeats of the experiment, and remained sceptical of some trick, saying the diamonds were too close in colour and shape to those of the Jagersfontein Mine near Kimberley. Lemoine was arrested on charges of fraud on 11 December? 1907. In 1908, a Parisian jeweller said he had sold Lemoine some small, uncut diamonds from the Jagersfontein mine that matched the description of the diamonds Lemoine was supposed to have manufactured. Lemoine fled the country before receiving judgement. =Chairman of De Beers= In 1908, Oats was appointed chairman of De Beers. That year he told the company's annual general meeting, \\"Really, if one could believe all the stories which have been circulating about the discovery of new mines and methods for the artificial making of diamonds, it would be a marvel that people are willing to buy diamonds at all. ... There have been numerous discoveries of alleged mines in all parts of the world, but none of them have come to the serious production stage except German S.W. Africa where a discovery has been made of some superficial deposits of diamonds, but fortunately for our prices, these, singularly enough, are all small in size.\\" Oats was making a serious error in discounting the German discovery, which had large and high quality diamonds, and dismissing Ernest Oppenheimer's Premier Mine, which was producing more than the total output of De Beers. Memorial in St Just church to Francis Oats and to his three grandsons who died in World War II (1939‚Äì45) The Kimberley diamond mines were shut down on 8 August 1914, soon after the start of World War I (1914‚Äì18). Francis Oats said the 1,000 men employed at the mines would be given half pay until the end of January 1915, when the company would decide what to do next. He said of the closure, In May 1916, the Wesselton Mine and Bultfontein Mine were reopened, but the Big Hole had closed for good. Francis Oats died on 1 September 1918, in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, South Africa. He was survived by his widow, daughter and three sons. The Francis Oats House, a hostel for pupils at the Kimberley Boys' High School, was built in 1920 and was still in use in 2016. Porthledden House, which Oats built in Cape Cornwall Cornish investments On a visit back to Cornwall, Oats bought shares in the Levant Mine. He also took shareholdings in the Cape Cornwall and Kenidjack mines. At the time of his death he was chairman of Basset Mines of Redruth. He tried to modernise the tin mine at St Just by sinking a new vertical shaft so that ore could be raised direct from the lower levels to the surface, a project that seemed even then to be uneconomical. His large investments in mining in Cornwall were misguided, since the industry would collapse after his death. Oats arranged for construction of Porthledden, a 21-bedroom mansion in Cape Cornwall designed as a gentleman's residence that was completed in 1909. He does not seem to have spent much time there, perhaps due to the length of the journey from South Africa. The terraces of the garden are above the north side of Priest's Cove at Cape Cornwall. On the south side of the cove there are adits cut into the cliff for the St Just Mine. His son made Porthledden into a hotel, but it did not succeed. It was sold in the 1950s to pay off family debts, and later fell into disrepair.

It operates by Star One, a subsidiary of Embratel.Kreb's, Gunter Brasilsat B 1, 2, 3, 4. Gunter's Space Page. Retrieved 2016-12-09. Objectives The Brasilsat B3 was launched to meet the great demand of the Brazilian market and to bring satellite communication to some cities in the Amazon Region, which still did not have access to satellite services, these locations were for the first time connected to Brazil and the world. In addition, the B3 unveiled the Brasilsat B2, which has now been used in open or pay-TV broadcasts, telephony services and data transmission. History Brasilsat is the name of a group of Brazilian satellites destined to provide communications via satellites, mainly to Brazil. In February 1998, the Brasilsat B3 satellite was launched, currently located at 92 degrees west longitude, in an inclined orbit where it meets the growing demand for telephony from several operators, mainly in the interior of Brazil. The satellite is one of the pioneers to transmit digital signal, with 100% of the programming being displayed in the new system. Brasilsat B3 coverage is national and the channels that were broadcast by it were mostly open. Brasilsat B3 was the third satellite launched from Brazil's second generation of communications satellites, which are the result of joint engineering and manufacturing efforts in the U.S. and Brazil. The new series of satellites was called \\"Brasilsat B'. Embratel, a Brazilian telecommunications company, signed a contract in August 1990 for the construction of the first two satellites of the series, Brasilsat B1 and Brasilsat B2. In December 1995, with new satellites in orbit and unable to meet customer demand, Embratel decided to launch a third satellite, Brasilsat B3. The fourth and last satellite of the series, Brasilsat B4, was ordered in June 1998. Brasilsat B3 was operated directly by Embratel until the end of 2000, when Star One was created a subsidiary of that company, which was destined to the management of Former fleet of Embratel satellites. After the satellite was launched in February 1998, it was placed in the orbital position of 65 degrees west longitude for testing, where it remained until the month of April of the same year when it was moved to 84 degrees west, location that the same Remained until August 2008, when it was transferred to 75 degrees west, Brasilsat B3 remained in this position in normal geostationary orbit until April 2012, when it was placed in inclined orbit. The satellite was moved to 92 degrees west in January 2013, where it remains currently in inclined orbit. Its replacement in the orbital position of 75 degrees west to continue with the radio and TV broadcasts was the Star One C3 satellite, which was launched in late 2012, and is covering Brazil and neighboring countries in South America.

Model  The satellite had the shape of a cylinder, where on its top was a directional antenna that opened after the launching of the satellite, had the rotation stabilized of 50 to 55 rpm, its movers used like propellant 136 kilograms of hydrazine and was fed by solar cells that supplied 982 watts at the beginning of its operation phase, using two NiCd batteries as power reserves. It carried 24 C-band transmitters with 6 spare transmitters. They provided an Effective Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) effective incident radiation power> 34 dBW for most of the Brazilian territory.  History  In the 1980s, Brazil needed its own satellites to exempt foreigners. As a result of this effort, the Brazilian company Embratel contracted in August 1982 the Canadian Spar Aerospace, Ltd., in partnership with American Hughes, to build its series of \\"Brasilsat A\\" satellites, the series consisted of two satellites, the Brasilsat-A1 and the Brasilsat-A2. Built by Spar Aerospace, which received US$ 125 million to build under license from Hughes, the two Brazilian satellites model HS-376. The satellites initially received the name of Brasilsat 1 and 2 and formed the beginning of the Brazilian Telecommunications Satellite System - SBTS. Subsequently, with the launch of the second generation of satellites, they were renamed Brasilsat-A1 and A2, and were replaced by the satellites Brasilsat B1 and Brasilsat B2. The Brasilsat A2 satellite was the second Brazilian satellite owned by the former state-owned Embratel, which was privatized on March 28, 1986, by a 2/3 Ariane rocket at Kourou's launch base in French Guiana. This satellite was equal to Brasilsat A1. It had a mass at the launch of 1,243 kg, Perigee of 35,778 km, Apogee of 35,794 km and a slope of 0.0 degrees. During its commercial life, it was parked at 70 degrees west. Its contractual life span was 8 years, but the satellite continued to be controlled until the end of 2004, with almost 18 years of life. Brasilsat A2 was operated directly by Embratel until the end of 2000, when Star One was created a subsidiary of Embratel, which was used to manage Embratel's former fleet of satellites. After the satellite was launched in March 1986, it was placed in the orbital position of 70 degrees west longitude. In 1994 it was transferred to 65 degrees west, where it remained until the month of June 1995, it was moved in August 1995 to 92 degrees west, where it remained until January 2001, it was transferred in March 2001 to 63 degrees west in sloping orbit, the Brasilsat-A2 remained in this position until February 2004 when it left service and was sent to the graveyard orbit. Its replacement in the orbital position of 70 degrees west to continue with the telecommunications transmissions, was the satellite Brasilsat B1, that was released in 1994.  Release  The satellite was successfully launched into space on March 28, 1986, at 23:30 UTC, by means of an Ariane 3 vehicle launched from the Space launching base of the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana along with the Satellite GStar 2.
