Mojo in the Morning is currently hosted by Mojo, Spike and Shannon and is under contract to IHeartMedia through 2020. The show actively supports various charities and has launched two local charities: the \\"Breaking & Entering Christmas Wish\\" (where they show up on the recipient's doorstep with clothing, food, toys and Christmas trees) and \\"Time Team\\" (where they encourage listeners to donate their time for various community service projects). The show also donated proceeds from sales made for CDs of their \\"Phone Scam\\" segments.

She pretends to be a florist offering a dozen free roses to be sent to the person of his or her choosing, with the possibility for the potentially unfaithful partner to send the flowers to the wrong person. ; Phone Scams : This segment has the host Spike prank calling a victim selected via requests on the show's official website. It is held each morning and notable victims of the segment have included Donald Trump, Ludacris, Charlie Sheen and The Chainsmokers. On a November 2013 broadcast, the hosts noted that Spike had completed his 1,000th phone scam on the program. ; Senseless Survey : This segment airs each Tuesday and is similar to the Phone Scams and was initially created in 2009 in response to news that the U.S. Census Bureau was having difficulty with the official 2010 United States Census. In the segment Spike calls an unsuspecting person and poses as an official taking a national poll. ; Street Scams : Spike pranks people in person rather than on the phone and the results of the practical joke are shared live on the air and in online videos. ; Dirty on the Thirty : An hourly celebrity gossip segment hosted by Shannon. ; Throwback Throwdown : Every Friday show members compete in a contest similar to Name That Tune where they must identify songs from the 1980s, '90s and 2000s. If songs are identified correctly, listeners have the ability to win prizes. ; Second Date Update : Each week, the show attempts to find out why a listener isn't getting a call back after a first date. This usually results in the show calling the \\"date\\" on the air to ask direct, revealing questions. ; Break Up or Make Up : Romantic couples share details of their relationship struggles to determine if listeners believe the couple should remain together. ; Six on Sex : In this segment Mojo encourages a listener to call his or her parents and listen to Mojo ask the caller six personal questions about their sex life while the call is played on air. If the parent does not hang up before the questions are answered, the caller wins a prize. ; 5 @ 655 : Two listeners battle each morning in a quiz of recent pop culture headlines. The winner continues to play again the next morning while the loser gets a prize. After fifteen wins, the caller then challenges Shannon in a game called 'Smarter than Shannon' ; Five Lies to Tell Your Mom : Each week, the show airs a phone call between a listener and his or her mother. The listener volunteers to convincingly tell his or her mom all five lies created by the show to encourage a dramatic response from the shocked mom. The goal is for the listener to keep his or her mom on the phone throughout the entire call. ; Singles Mingle : The show hosts several parties throughout the year for single listeners to meet a mate. The parties are usually themed and are by invitation only. Entertainment for the party can include a live performance from a national recording artist and the parties have been attended by people such as Mike Posner, Paris Hilton and Jessica Simpson. ; Town Tour : Every summer the show's staff broadcasts live from various cities within their listening area, where they encourage listeners to attend the broadcast, which is usually outdoors.  Ratings, reception, and audience  Mojo in the Morning broadcasts in locations such as Arizona, Ohio, Florida, Virginia, Mississippi and Michigan, and the show has been frequently ranked as a \\"Top Five morning show\\" in Detroit's Arbitron/Nielsen PPM Radio Ratings. The show has also been voted as \\"Best Radio Morning Show\\" in many Detroit publications such as The Detroit News, Metro Times, and Real Detroit Weekly. In 2013, Mojo was named along with Howard Stern, Rush Limbaugh and Ryan Seacrest as one of the \\"Top 25 Radio Personalities of the Last 25 Years\\" according to Talentmaster, a talk radio industry publication.  Notable broadcasts and controversies  Several of the segments and broadcasts run by Mojo in the Morning have received attention from the national media, such as a 2013 segment where they had someone impersonate actor Ryan Gosling. In 2012 singer Justin Bieber left an interview early because he disliked comparisons to Justin Timberlake and jokes about Harry Styles being attracted to older women, including Bieber's mom. As a result, Mojo (who had been hosting the interview) was briefly suspended from the show. The show also received notice for a series of phone calls between Eminem and his ex-wife Kimberly Mathers, where each would reveal personal information about the other person on the radio broadcast for all to hear. Other show segments seen as controversial include the show hiring an airplane to fly a banner over downtown Detroit referencing the conviction of former Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick; Spike trespassing on the set of Glee; a faux funeral for the Detroit Lions NFL football team due to its poor playing;, an April Fool's Day joke in which Mojo shared that the Detroit Red Wings hockey team would be relocated across the Detroit River to Canada as a cost-cutting move. and photos of Miss USA winner Rima Fakih participating in a \\"Stripper 101\\" contest sponsored by the show. In 2012 the show was threatened with legal action by former staff member Rob Graham, who claimed that the show violated HIPAA laws by discussing his personal medical history on air and that he had been encouraged to post copyrighted information on the show's official website. A lawsuit was never filed. When Detroit's NHL team built a new arena in 2017, Spike \\"stole\\" the zamboni and drove it‚Äîwithout team permission‚Äîthrough rush hour traffic to the new arena.

Specializing in robust & inspired beers, southern-style barbeque, from-scratch cuisine, artisan meats & a DIY mentality, Greenbush is a haven for both beer and food enthusiasts alike. Currently, Greenbush distributes beer in Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky. In addition to the Sawyer locations, Greenbush plans to open a brewpub in South Bend, Indiana in late October 2019. History In late December 2007, Greenbush Brewing‚Äôs founder Scott Sullivan had an unfortunate altercation with a router (no, not the technological kind) in the midst of a woodworking project, which at the time happened to be his profession. This bit of misfortune nearly cost him a digit and put him on the sidelines for a good period of months, during which time he began homebrewing. When he cracked open batch four (the beer we now call Distorter), everyone he gave it to told him that he could sell it, which he decided was a novel idea and set about figuring out how to do. Next came more homebrewing, a business plan, and a search for a place to sell the beer for which he was rapidly becoming well known. By early 2010 he had secured a place to make and sell beer, with a very helpful landlord who decked out the first iteration of the taproom and brewery that you see today. In early 2011 the preliminary work was wrapped up and he was ready to open. Being back in the wood-working game, he built out the space with a small bar and a few tables - with the idea of handing out a little beer, selling some pints, and pouring growlers for people to take home. At this point, he had handed out over 9,000 bottles of beer and the word had spread pretty far and pretty wide. The remaining obstacle was the forthcoming state license, and an opening date was set for June 11, 2011. As fortune would have it, the license was delivered on the morning of June 10, and Greenbush opened the doors a day early. 350 people turned up. The next day was the grand opening, and 550 people were served. From there it only progressed. Three weeks later, on the 4th of July weekend, beer ran out due to the incredible demand. On July 2, Greenbush had to close the doors for nearly a week to regroup and get more beer ready to go. Unprecedented. At this point, Greenbush was well aware that they were onto something they had never anticipated. By the end of 2011, beer was being distributed to a portion of Michigan, Northwest Indiana, and the Chicago metro area. By 2012, distribution opened to the rest of Michigan. Food, once a small part of the operation, had grown to a mainstay ‚Äì founder Scott Sullivan‚Äôs backyard BBQ recipes for brisket and pulled pork were introduced to the menu. In May, Greenbush expanded the taproom to double its size and increased the size of the kitchen. In 2013, a 15 barrel brewing system was installed, more than doubling output. Additionally, a fermentation farm and bottling line eased production, and soon after, Greenbush put packaged beer into full distribution market for the first time. Distribution footprint had grown to all of Michigan, Northwest Indiana, and all of Illinois. In 2014, Greenbush leased the old filling station and its adjoining yard across the street from the taproom and began planning and building the Annex. The space was decked out with shelving for merchandise, a 14-tap tower, a deli case, a cold case for beer, a small pilot brewing system, and bocce ball lanes. In 2016, Greenbush took over the church down the street and turned half of it into a full-service commissary in order to keep up with food production needs. By early summer 2019, distribution included the rest of Indiana. By late summer 2019, Greenbush launched distribution in all of Kentucky. By the end of fall 2019, Greenbush plans on expanding distribution to Ohio and Wisconsin. On September 18, 2019, Greenbush announced plans to open a brewpub in Erskine Plaza on the south end of South Bend, Indiana during late October 2019. The neighboring Martin‚Äôs grocery store will be carrying some of Greenbush‚Äôs well- loved food items like bacon, bbq sauce, etc. Taproom Located at 5885 Sawyer Rd, The Greenbush Taproom houses 28 taps, a full menu (with infamous bbq and sandwich options), and a loyal Mug Club following. Popular beer choices include: Star Chicken Shotgun (IPA, 6.8% ABV), Sunspot (Hefeweizen, 6.0% ABV), Oro de Tontos (Vienna Lager, 4.5% ABV), Brother Benjamin (Imperial IPA, 10.10% ABV), Distorter (Porter, 7.2% ABV) etc. The Annex Located across the street from the taproom, The Annex offers beer lovers another place to enjoy Greenbush Beer. The Annex features a small pilot brewing system, 14 taps, a merchandise store, a shaded outdoor patio, occasional live music, and bocce ball courts. Food options at the Annex include sandwiches and charcuterie boards. Customers can also shop from deli options and Greenbush packaged food favorites including but not limited to Mustard Q (honey mustard), KC bbq sauce, bacon bleu dip, and Joique wing sauce.

It is located in the World Trade Center section of Manhattan, New York City and offers walking tours and galleries with 9/11 artifacts and history. __TOC__ Organization The 9/11 Tribute Museum provides educational experiences for visitors and a central place for the local community and victims' families and friends to gather and share their personal experiences with the public. Through walking tours, exhibitions and programs, the 9/11 Tribute Museum connects visitors with people who directly experienced the events of the February 26, 1993, bombing and the September 11, 2001, attacks. The Tribute Museum has hosted more than four million visitors from all over the world. The 9/11 Tribute Museum is a 501(c)3 non-profit, and is a project of the September 11th Families' Association. History The 9/11 Tribute Museum, formerly known as the 9/11 Tribute Center and Tribute WTC Visitor Center, is a project of the September 11th Families‚Äô Association. The September 11th Families‚Äô Association was created by widows and other family members of those killed in the 9/11 attacks. The Association established a mission to unite and support all victims of terrorism through communication, representation and peer support. The 9/11 Tribute Center opened on September 6, 2006, across the street from the World Trade Center site and next to the Engine 10/Ladder 10 Firehouse of the New York City Fire Department. It was located in the former Liberty Deli, where meals and supplies were given to rescue workers in the attacks' aftermath. The Association renovated the space to create an educational center with photos, artifacts, and stories shared by the community. In June 2017, the Museum was moved to 92 Greenwich Street, a location that provides it with more exhibit space. Tours 9/11 Tribute Museum volunteer giving a guided tour of the 9/11 Memorial The 9/11 Tribute Museum has trained volunteer guides who all have personal 9/11 experiences.

The Museum also offers tours for student groups, in addition to learning programming, professional development and workshops. Exhibits The museum has three floors. Exhibits emphasize the historical significance of 9/11 and the civic response in the aftermath, through a collection of oral histories and artifacts from Ground Zero. All galleries are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Huffington Post wrote that \\"walking through the museum is like being transported back to the turmoil, destruction and anguish of 9/11. Exhibits express the disbelief and heartache of New York and the nation.\\" Other 9/11 memorials The National September 11 Memorial & Museum is a partner of the 9/11 Tribute Museum and serves as the primary memorial to the events of September 11, 2001. Aside from the memorial constructed at Ground Zero, there are many other memorials built by various communities and municipalities throughout the United States. Many of these memorials are built around a remnant of steel from the destroyed towers. These remnants have been donated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey through a program that has distributed more than 1,000 pieces of World Trade Center steel.

The vessel was completed near the end of the war and saw brief service during the Battle of Okinawa. After the war, LCS(L)(3)-102 served in China before being decommissioned in 1946 and then transferred to Japan in mid-1953. Serving under the name JDS Himawari, the vessel remained in Japan until mid-1966 when she was transferred to Thailand, becoming the HTMS Nakha. In 2007, after being retired, the ship was returned to the United States to become a museum ship. Now the sole remaining vessel of her class, she remains docked at the site of the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard, in Vallejo, CA.  Design and construction  USS LCS(L)(3)-102 was laid down 13 January 1945 at Commercial Iron Works in Portland, Oregon. The vessel was launched on 3 February 1945 and commissioned on 17 February. As built, the vessel displaced 250-tons without load, and 387 tons at full load. She was long, with a beam of and a draft of . With a crew of six officers and 65 enlisted personnel, at maximum endurance she had a range of 5,500 nautical miles at a cruising speed of 12 knots; power was provided by two propellers that were driven by four General Motors 6-71 per-shaft 1,600 horse power diesel engines. =Armament= She was armed with an array of weapons, including: a single 3-inch gun mounted on her bow; two twin-mounted 40mm anti- aircraft guns; four single-mounted 20mm anti-aircraft guns; four .50 caliber machine-guns and ten rocket launchers. Armor included splinter shields which were placed on the gun mounts, the pilot house and the conning tower. Her ten Mk7 rocket launchers were removed sometime after decommissioning, presumably before transfer into the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force.  Operational history  After commissioning, the LCS(L)(3)-102 was assigned to the Asiatic- Pacific Theater under the command of Lt. Richard L. Jones. World War II was in its final stages at the time, but she arrived in time to participate in the Battle of Okinawa, participating in the Gunto operation between 18 and 30 June 1945. She was pulled off line to perform mine removal in the Philippines, before doing the same in the Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, and rivers in China. At the end the end of the war, USS LCS(L)(3)-102 served as part of the occupation forces in Japan until December 1945 when it was moved to China before being deemed surplus and decommissioned in April 1946 and laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet, Columbia River Group, in Astoria, Oregon. Redesignated Landing Ship Support Large, USS \\"LSSL-102\\", on 28 February 1949 she was soon transferred to Japan, 30 April 1953, and renamed JDS Himawari where she served until 18 April 1966 when she was brought to the US, re- transferred to Thailand and renamed HTMS Nakha (LSSL-751). She stayed in Thailand until 2007. USS LCS(L)(3)-102 earned one battle star for her service in World War II.  Museum ship (2007-present)  A transfer ceremony was held on May 22, 2007, to transfer custody of the ship from the Royal Thai Navy to the National Association of LCS(L) 1-130. In September 2007, she was loaded aboard a ship for transit from Thailand back to the United States to become a museum ship at Mare Island, California. The National Association of LCS(L) 1-130 is now officially known as the Landing Craft Support Museum, and continues to preserve and restore the 102. She is now located on Mare Island, at the site of the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The museum is open to the public from 9 to 3 Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, or by prior arrangements.

Laborers' International Union of North America, 648 F.3d 295 (6th Cir. 2011), is a Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals case that reinstated a Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\\"CFAA\\") claim brought by an employer against a labor union for \\"bombarding\\" the company's phone and computer systems with emails and voicemail, making it impossible for the company to communicate with customers. It held that causing a transmission that diminishes a plaintiff's ability to use its systems and data constitutes \\"causing damage\\" in violation of the CFAA.  Background  = CFAA = The Federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030, is a statute that both criminalizes certain computer-fraud crimes and creates a civil cause of action. Enacted in 1986, the CFAA makes it a crime to \\"knowingly cause the transmission of a program, information, code, or command, and as a result of that conduct, intentionally cause damage without authorization, to a protected computer.\\" 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030 Under the CFAA, \\"any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information\\" qualifies as \\"damage.\\" 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(e)(8)  Case  = Facts & Procedural Posture = In September 2009, Pulte, a home building company, fired a construction crew member for what they claimed was misconduct and poor performance. Soon afterward, the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA) initiated a national campaign against Pulte in order to damage its reputation because they thought union membership was the company's real reason. The union's tactics included bombarding Pulte's sales offices and three of its executives with thousands of phone calls and emails. Most of the communications concerned the company's purported unfair labor practices, though some included threats and obscene language. The volume of calls overloaded Pulte's system, interfering with employees' normal communications with customers and vendors and generally stalling normal business operations. Pulte filed suit, alleging violations of the CFAA. The district court denied the motion, holding that Pulte failed to show that LIUNA intentionally caused damage to Pulte's phone and computer systems. Pulte appealed. = Sixth Circuit Opinion = The Sixth Circuit held that Pulte had successfully stated a \\"transmission\\" claim. A transmission claim requires a showing that the defendant intentionally caused damage.18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(a)(5)(A) The court stated that \\"a transmission that weakens a sound computer system‚Äîor, similarly, one that diminishes a plaintiff's ability to use data or a system‚Äîcauses damage.\\" It reasoned that LIUNA's barrage of calls and emails diminished Pulte's ability to use its systems and data because they prevented Pulte from sending and receiving at least some emails and calls. The court further held that Pulte met its burden in showing that LIUNA acted with the intent to cause damage, holding that the district court had set too high of a standard as to this element. LIUNA did not need to know the actual consequences of its actions, the court reasoned; the sheer volume of calls and LIUNA's call to \\"fight back\\" indicated that the union intended to cause some harm to Pulte. The Sixth Circuit agreed with the lower court that Pulte failed to allege an \\"access\\" claim. To state an access claim, a plaintiff must show that the defendant \\"intentionally accesse[d] a protected computer without authorization.\\" 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030(a)(5)(B), (C) A person acting \\"without authorization\\" has \\"no rights, limited or otherwise, to access the computer in question.\\" The court reasoned that Pulte's phone and email systems were open to the public, so LIUNA was authorized to use them. Because Pulte did not allege that LIUNA possessed no right to contact Pulte's offices and its executives, it failed to satisfy this element of its claim.  Significance  This case reflects the recent trend of federal appeals courts expanding the CFAA beyond its original purpose of combating computer hacking.Sixth Circuit Rules that High-Volume Phone and Email Campaign Violates Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (Aug. 18, 2011) District courts have historically interpreted the CFAA narrowly, sometimes limiting it strictly to outside computer hacking.Can A Labor Union Be Sued Under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act for Spamming an Employer‚Äôs Voice and Email Systems? (Aug. 8, 2011) In contrast, appeals courts have continued to interpret the statute broadly as a true federal omnibus computer crime statute, capturing a wide range of activity directed at computers and computer systems. Critics of the decision have argued that in raising emails sent as part of a labor protest to the level of \\"computer hacking,\\" the court stretched too far.Court Says Sending Too Many Emails Is Computer Hacking (Aug. 9, 2011) Moreover, they have argued that the rule established in the case is overly broad. By holding that diminished ability to use a phone or email system constitutes damage, the Sixth Circuit has left open the possibility that coordinated phone or email campaigns ‚Äì common tools of civic action ‚Äì will be subject to liability under the CFAA.

The \\"second globalization\\" began in 1944 and ended in 1971. This led to the third era of globalization, which began in 1989 and continues today.  History  Globalization revolves around technological and social advances, which further leads to advances in trade and cultural relativism throughout the world. Some economists claim that globalization was first started by the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus. This assumption is considered false due to the mass discovery of gold and silver in mines. This discovery led to the decrease in value of silver and gold in Europe, causing inflation in the Spanish and Portuguese empires. However, the discovery of the Americas and the natives gave European traders a new source of labor between the continents, which also increased trade. This stage has not been officially deemed the \\"first era of globalization\\" because the world trade numbers were not increasing exponentially. World trade increased by 1% per year from 1500 to 1800, which further led to the first era of globalization. Entering the 18th century, due to new technological breakthroughs world trade started to increase rapidly. The first technological advancement that contributed to this was the steam engine, introduced in the 17th century. This led to major progress in international trade among the economic powers of the world. The invention of the steamship had a great impact on the first wave of globalization. Before its invention, trade routes were reliant on wind patterns, but steamships reduced shipping time and shipping cost. By 1850, nearly 129 countries used steamships for trade, and approximately 5,000 imports and exports were made to 5,000 cities, thus making a great impact on the world's global economy.

He is especially known for his role as Governor-General in making changes in the salt monopoly of the Qing dynasty.\\"T'ao Chu,\\" in Arthur Hummel, ed., Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1943) II:710-711. Career Tao was trained first by his father, a scholar and teacher, and then in the Yuelu Academy, in the city of Changsha in the conservative inland province of Hunan. The Academy inculcated an ascetic philosophy of self- examination and dedication to rescuing the world from the decadence of recent times. Graduates formed what one historian called a \\"network of messianic alumni.\\" Tao received his jinshi degree in 1802, and joined the Hanlin Academy in 1805. After posts in Sichuan, Shanxi, and Anhui, he was appointed governor of Anhui and then Jiangsu. When the Grand Canal was blocked by floods, in 1826, as governor of Jiangsu, he took the dangerous course of shipping tribute grain by sea, using some 1,562 junks on the route from Shanghai to Tianjin. The strategy was successful but roused the opposition of officials who profited from the use of the Canal. In the 1820s, reform officials under the Daoguang Emperor proposed restructuring and renewed oversight of the bureaucracy. The Qing government inherited a Salt Administration divided geographically into districts, the largest and most central of which was Liang-Huai, on the north coast of Jiangsu, with its headquarters in Yangzhou, which shipped salt to seven provinces: Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Guizhou. The rights to salt produced along the coast was controlled by some 200 private merchants who held hereditary franchises for distribution in specific inland areas. These merchants combined official status and private function, but by the early 19th century failed to deliver the massive amounts of salt they had contracted but instead raised prices. Smuggled and black market sales then outweighed official sales, and government revenues fell. In 1832, Tao was tasked by the Daoguang Emperor with fixing the problem, which was deemed especially acute in light of the outflow of silver in the years leading up to the First Opium War. Acting on the advice of his classmates Wei Yuan and Bao Shichen, two other officials in the reform group, Tao took immediate action to end the Ming franchise system in favor of a relatively open market. Any merchant of good standing could buy salt distribution tickets for the purchase of single shipments of large or small amounts which could be retailed anyplace the merchant wished. The tickets themselves could be bought and sold.William T. Rowe. China's Last Empire: The Great Qing. (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, History of Imperial China, 2009; ), p. 162-163 Tao's reforms opened the system up to small scale traders, depriving the hereditary merchants and the smugglers of their profits and lowering costs to the consumer. However, Tao could not meet the optimistic commitments he had made to the emperor.Thomas Metzger, \\"The Organizational Capabilities of the Ch'ing State in Commerce.\\" pp. 42-43 in William E Willmott, ed., Economic Organization in Chinese Society (Stanford University Press, 1972). Tao resigned in March 1839, giving illness as the reason, and died four months later. A temple was erected in his memory in Banpu (now Guanyun), Jiangsu, a city in the salt region.

Geography Mount Beevor is a rounded prominence forming part of a north-south trending ridge, about 30 km east of Mount Lofty and 18 km north east of Mount Barker. The western slopes are the steepest. The headwaters of the Bremer River collect beside the western base of Mount Beevor before flowing southward into Lake Alexandrina. Geologically, it is about mid-way along the north-south running Bremer Fault Scarp.Regolith-Landforms and Salt Stores in the Angas- Bremer Hills. (2004 CSIRO open report.) The junction of the boundaries of the following localities all coincide with its summit - Harrogate, Rockleigh and Tungkillo which are all located within the Rural City of Murray Bridge and the cadastral units of the County of Sturt and the Hundred of Monarto. Climate Rainfall is low. The district was noted among early pioneers for being somewhat waterless. The peak, often windy, can be bleak, foggy, and bitterly cold in winter, providing little shelter from the elements. Heavy snowstorms thickly blanketed Mount Beevor in July 1901. In contrast, summer thunderstorms can wash out nearby roads, turning watercourses into torrents. During such events very little water was captured in the landscape in its natural state, causing severe downstream flooding, particularly along the Bremer River. In between these extremes there are sometimes stretches of fine weather affording views over ridges and spurs strewn with wildflowers. History The Indigenous inhabitants of this district were the Peramangk people but their name for the mount is unknown. Because of the barren nature of the mount their nomadic visits were relatively brief and rare. The first Europeans to discover and visit the mount was the expedition of Dr George Imlay and John Hill on 25 January 1838.S.A. Register newspaper, 23 June 1838, p. 3. They were returning on horseback to Adelaide from Mannum after being the first to reach the Murray overland within South Australia and had initially mistaken the peak for Mount Barker. Despite having realised their mistake they did not name it. The present name originates from Captain Beevor, a former British Army soldier who in late 1839 was the first European settler in this district. He pioneered a sheep run there, with his head station near the southern base of the mount and his shepherds‚Äô huts scattered all round. In 1844 Beevor moved to pioneer a sheep run on Eyre Peninsula, being speared to death there in 1849.Adelaide Advertiser, 28 July 1877, p. 2. Subsequent pastoralists included the Murray family, whose Mount Beevor Estate became noted as one of the best wool producing properties in South Australia and an outstanding merino breeding establishment.Cockburn R : Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia, 1925, Vol. II, pp 180-181, . The family of Thomas Hope Murray (1854-1905) lived there in an up-to-date homestead comprising fifteen spacious rooms. From 1906 Norman Edward Brice (1864-1927) and family continued the high reputation of Mount Beevor Estate. Economy Mount Beevor is located in an agricultural district. The slopes of the mount, which are mostly rock-studded grassland with clusters of remnant eucalyptus woodland, are utilised for livestock grazing. In recent decades the summit has become important for communications. Transmission towers are located there to provide broadcast and relay capacities throughout the district for Telstra, mobile phone providers, Emergency Services, and C.B. Radio. A vehicular track allows servicing of these facilities but is closed to public vehicles. Bushwalking tourism is a more recent development. On clear days there are outstanding panoramic views from Mount Beevor summit. It has therefore become an important staging point along the Lavender Federation Trail, a recreational walking trail running between Murray Bridge and Truro.

Goldberger was a case out of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in which the court developed a reasoned framework to determine the proper exercise of personal jurisdiction in cases involving activity in cyberspace. The court determined that it lacked jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant whose website was accessible to New York residents.Hearst Corp. v. Goldberger, No. 1:96-cv-03620, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2065, 1997 WL 97097 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 1997). Background The rise of the Internet has posed difficulties for courts trying to determine the proper exercise of jurisdiction. In applying traditional doctrines, courts have arrived at inconsistent and sometimes contradictory results.PERSONAL JURISDICTION AND CYBERSPACE: ESTABLISHING PRECEDENT IN A BORDERLESS ERA, Nagy, 1998 The established test for determining personal jurisdiction over an out- of-state defendant asks a court to evaluate whether the activity in question was purposefully directed toward the forum state such that the exercise of jurisdiction would not violate the defendant's due process rights. The second prong of the test requires that the defendant have \\"minimum contacts\\" with the forum state such that he/she could reasonably anticipate being called into court there. Where the Internet is concerned, jurisdictional issues are more difficult. Most Internet users are unaware that they have transcended state borders and are subject to the jurisdiction of a different state. Thus, the exercise of personal jurisdiction over an Internet user may not comport with due process, since a user cannot purposefully avail himself of a particular jurisdiction if he has no indication of where is he in cyberspace. Facts Goldberger (defendant), a New Jersey resident and attorney, had developed a website to provide legal support services to solo attorneys.Goldberger Aff. ¬∂ 3; Goldberger Dep. at 10‚Äì11. At the time of the lawsuit, the website was not yet operational, consisting merely of a homepage describing the services he planned to offer. Hearst, the publisher of Esquire, filed an action alleging that Goldberger's domain name, Esqwire.com, infringed on its trademark.Lanham Act and New York State Law Hearst brought suit in New York, stating that the venue was proper because the website was accessible to New York residents. The New York long-arm statute allows a non-resident who does not transact business in New York to be sued if the non-resident has committed a tortious act within the state of New York, or if he commits such an act outside of the state with expected harm occurring within the state and he derives substantial revenue from interstate commerce. Holding and reasoning  The court held that the defendant's \\"out-of-state creation of an Internet web site that is accessible in New York, standing alone, does not provide personal jurisdiction over defendant in New York\\".1997 WL 97097, p. 16 New York's long-arm statute states that an out-of-state defendant must transact business within the state, and the cause of action must arise out of such a transaction, in order for jurisdiction to lie in New York. The court analogized to a previous case where advertisements directed toward consumers in New York were insufficient to satisfy the requirement of transacting business. It reasoned that Goldberger's website was not targeted at residents of New York or any other state in particular. His contacts were minimally intrusive, since he had not yet sold any products at the time the lawsuit was brought.11/25/96 Tr. at 15. On that basis, the court concluded that the website was \\"analogous to an advertisement in a national publication.\\" Because placing an advertisement does not constitute transacting business under New York law,Simplicity Machine & Mfg. Co. v. Stevens Co Goldenberg's activities did not constitute sufficient contacts with New York to justify the exercise of jurisdiction. The opinion also made the policy argument that allowing activity in cyberspace to establish sufficient minimum contacts would be too broad an extension of personal jurisdiction. This holding rejected Maritz, Inset, Heroes, Inc., etc., which held that the existence of a web site available to forum residents, combined with tortious injury in the forum state, was sufficient to sustain jurisdiction. Internet Library of Law and Court Decisions, Analysis of Hearst v. Goldberger, Samson Subsequent treatment Weber v. Jolly Hotels treated the Goldberger decision approvingly and also declined to grant general personal jurisdiction to the plaintiff in that case, as doing so would \\"violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\\"Emerging Technologies and the Law: Forms and Analysis, Volume 1, Raysman, 2002 See also *Personal jurisdiction *Personal jurisdiction in Internet cases in the United States References United States District Court for the Southern District of New York cases ","title":"Hearst Corp. v.

Humans One of the characteristics of the Williams syndrome has been described as \\"pointed ears\\". There are also cases of people being born with pointed ears not associated to William's syndrome. In one family a woman was born with two pointed ears, she later had a son with two less dramatically pointed ears, and she had a great uncle with one pointed ear. Some cases of pointed ears may be due to trauma to ears during labor, and the ear crease may unfold with time. Folklore and fiction Anime-style elvish archer with pointed ears Manga and anime-style character with pointed ears Pointy ears have been a characteristic of some creatures in folklore such as French croquemitaine, Brazilian curupira or Japanese earth spider. It has been a feature of characters on art as old as that of Ancient Greece and medieval Europe. Pointy ears are common characteristic of many creatures in the fantasy genre. It's a common characteristics of races such as, among others, elves, faeries, pixies, hobbits, or orcs. They are also a characteristic of creatures from the horror genre, such as vampires. This characteristic has been adopted into the Japanese anime and manga art style, where pointy ears are also a common trope of fantasy characters. Manga and anime elves in particular are distinguished by very prominently displayed pointed ears, often drawn larger and more distinctly visible, as well as more angled, than in the Western works. Pointy ears have become associated with elves in Victorian literature of the 19th century. Popularization of the pointed ears as an attribute of elves has been attributed to the works of J. R. R. Tolkien and their more recent big screen interpretation, though the status of elvish ears as canon is not universally accepted by the Tolkien fandom.

An additional soap connection is provided by another cast member, James Condon, who later played the title role in soap opera The Story of Peter Grey. Originally broadcast in Sydney, it was shown (via early video-tape) in Melbourne at a later date. It may also have been shown in Perth. Producer Brett Porter said, \\"this is a most imaginative TV production, calling for a high degree of creativeness in lighting, camera work and sound. It offers Muriel Steinbeck a real acting tour de force.\\" Porter said ATN-7 had searched for a script to star Steinbeck for some time. It was the fourth production of Shell Presents written by an Australian author with an Australian setting especially for the show (although Workman was born in Scotland he lived in Australia). Reception The TV critic for the Sydney Morning Herald called it a \\"cleverly-constructed psychological thriller... imaginatively acted and directed\\" in which Muriel Steinbeck \\"in a role tailor-made for Bette Davis or a Barbara Stanwyck... acted with great style and polish, moving smoothly through the moods of whimsy menace and slight madness which the part demanded.

Early Life and Education Natalie \\"Alabama\\" Chanin was born and raised in Florence, Alabama. At the age of ten, she and her mom moved to Chattanooga. She has a degree in Environmental Design with a focus on industrial and craft-based textiles from North Carolina State University.Natalie Chanin arts.gov After graduation, Chanin worked in the junior sportswear industry on New York's Seventh Avenue, before moving abroad. For the next decade, she worked as a stylist,costume designer, and filmmaker, all while traveling the globe. Inspiration Chanin draws inspiration from her academic studies, including ideas about color as espoused by Josef and Anni Albers,the Bauhaus artists who fled Nazi Germany for Asheville, North Carolina, in 1933 to teach at Black Mountain College. Southern literature and stories have always been a love of hers. Growing up, her grandmother sewed every garment her children wore as well as Chanin's, while also gardening and cooking fresh food. This led to her naturally to make a community of her own through Alabama Chanin. You Can Make It There Career =Project Alabama= Chanin came back to her hometown of Florence, Alabama in 2000 and developed an idea to create a small line of two-hundred unique t-shirts. Chanin decided her hometown was the only place able to envision her idea of reconstructing vintage shirts with detailed stitches, like that of a quilting stitch from the depression era. This started the development of Project Alabama, which consisted of a twenty-two-minute documentary called Stitch, the two-hundred limited hand-sewn and hand-mended t-shirts, and a hand-made catalogue. After taking the collection to New York City to showcase at the Hotel Chelsea, it was immediately recognized by buyers from department stores including Barneys New York.

Historical evidence reveals indigenous people, Egyptian kaftans, and Pre- industrial society consciously tried to make garments without any excess waste. In the past, textiles were treated preciously as they were known for being scarce, which lead to their consciousness with waste. Whereas, after the Industrial Revolution, technology developments were able to increase production and lower costs allowing for textile waste to be less of a concern. Precious Cut: Exploring Creative Pattern Cutting and Draping for Zero-Waste Design All the garments are made with either organic or recycled materials by the hand of local artisans. The company employs local women aged twenty to seventy, to help sew one-of-a-kind, handmade garments, preserving the region‚Äôs dwindling tradition of quilting. Any waste fabric is used as an embellishment, patchwork, or appliqu√© as a way of using the re-manufacturing process. From low-value waste garments the new products created here have value imbued through the skills of the workers and the story told through the label. Production Operations Chanin originally sourced materials solely from local thrift stores, but with increased orders the company began relying on bulk shipments from Salvation Army.

The name of the castle is probably derived from the castle well which stands under a large lime tree (German: Linde).  Geographical location  The ruins of Lindelbrunn lie about 2.3 km northeast of Vorderweidenthal, on whose territory they stand, and 1.7 km (both as the crow flies) south-southeast of Darstein. It is located at a height of on the conical summit of the Schlo√überg (\\"castle hill\\"). At its foot is a forester's lodge and a tourist caf√©, the Cramerhaus, formerly belonging to the Palatine Forest Club.  History  Lindelbrunn Castle was founded in the middle of the 12th century, presumably as an imperial castle to defend the Trifels. Prior to that, it may have been owned by the imperial church at Speyer. In 1268 the ministerialis, Dieter von Lindelbol, is mentioned for the first time in the records as a descendant of the imperial seneschal (Reichstruchse√ü), Markward von Annweiler (ca. 1140‚Äì1202). It is likely that the main construction phase of the castle with its palas and separate chapel dates to around 1190/1200. At that time, large halls and independent chapels were only built by relatively high-ranking lords; around 1200, not a single count had such facilities. In 1274 the castle was transferred by King Rudolph of Habsburg to Counts Emich IV and Frederick III of Leiningen. In the course of time, Lindelbrunn became a joint-inheritance or Ganerbenburg. As a result of the enfeoffment of various parts of the castle, there were so many co-owners that disputes arose. In 1381, St. Nicholas' Chapel was first mentioned in a deed. In 1441, troops of the Palatine prince-elector and the Bishop of Speyer, Reinhard von Helmstatt besieged the castle for seven weeks until a peaceful agreement ended the investment. Shortly after Easter 1450, as a result of a feud and the seizure of Hans von Helmstadt, troops from the town of Landau and Bishopric of Speyer advanced on the castle. After four days of unsuccessful siege, Holzapfel was ransomed. In June that year, Count Emich VI of Leiningen-Hardenburg and his son, Frederick of Zweibr√ºcken-Bitsch, besieged the castle, captured it and so ended the disputes. During the German Peasants' War of 1525, the castle was razed by rebellious peasants of the Kleeburg Kolbenhaufen band. Since then it has remained unoccupied and fallen into ruins. In 1963, the castle became the possession of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1979 to 1981 comprehensive remediation measures were carried out which saw the remains of the detached chapel being uncovered and partially restored.  Layout  As there are steep sandstone rock faces on all sides, the castle did not need a neck ditch or a Zwinger. The curtain walls, of what is largely a stately home, are also the castle walls and follow the line of the terrain. Of the outer entrance to the castle nothing visible remains. The surviving inner gate is in the northeast. An older castle entrance, south of it, can be seen as a shaft that was hewn in the rock. The foundations of the former St. Nicholas' Chapel (around 1190/1200) have been restored. The most important visible remains are the preserved parts of the palas (around 1190/1200) in the southwest of the castle. The outer wall on the valley side is made of rusticated ashlars and has three niches with adjacent windows and a fireplace, which has not quite been faithfully reconstructed. The interior probably contained a large hall. Although other outer walls and the remains of residential buildings have been partially reconstructed, it is still difficult to get a clear picture of what the castle looked like. At the highest point of the castle in the northeast, Lindelbrunn could have had a bergfried, but it has not yet been uncovered. Also unclear is the original purpose of the building remains on an overhanging rock outcrop in the southwest as well as the discovery of a well south of the outer wall of the palas and thus outside the curtain wall. Another well was located in the south of the castle near the chapel.  Access and views  From the forester's lodge, Forsthaus Lindelbrunn, it is a 15 to 20 minute walk to the ruins of Lindelbrunn Castle. In clear weather, there is an extensive 360-degree panoramic view which also takes in the imperial castle of Trifels.  Legends  = Derivation of the name = When the knight who ruled the castle called his followers together in the courtyard to announce the name of the newly built castle, an old gray-haired woman suddenly appeared and stood in the middle of his retinue. While the knight and his entourage looked on amazed, she planted a lime branch by the well. She then said to the knight that as long as the lime tree blossomed, his family would also flourish and not wither. Before disappearing, she also said that the castle was henceforth to be called Lindelbrunn. The lime tree thrived and flourished, and so did the knight's family; he was popular throughout the land. But one day, the old gray woman met Rothkopf, the brother of the knight, who had been outcast many years before, in the forest. She wanted the brothers to reconcile and took him to the castle. But the knight at Lindelbrunn did not want to see his brother nor the old gray woman in his castle and threatened that if they did not go away they would be hanged on the lime tree. Then the old gray woman rose and stuck a distaff in the lime tree. With a rustling of the leaves the lime tree fell down the well. The old woman had broken off a small branch before the lime tree disappeared. She then left the castle with Rothkopf. At the foot of the mountain, she planted the branch and said to Rothkopf, he should build a new castle at this spot using the stones of the old castle. She disappeared and Rothkopf looked up to see the castle disintegrate in a violent storm and the stones roll down to him in the valley. Rothkopf rushed back up the hill to save his brother, but found only the ruins and no survivors. Back in the valley he began to build a house with the stones of the castle, as the old gray woman had told him. Today there are just ruins at the top of the hill and the forester's lodge is at its foot. = How the castle was destroyed in the Peasants' War = When the peasant mobs had made several attempts to burn the castle down and cause a bloodbath but failed because the castle was well defended by the knight and his foot soldiers, the peasants withdrew with heavy losses and gave up. The knight of the castle was celebrating his victory in fine style when a commoner stood before the gate in order to report the withdrawal of the peasants. He was invited in and given a meal. He praised the lord of the castle and wished him happiness. Believing he was safe the knight allowed him to stay the night in the castle. But when almost all those in the castle had fallen into a drunken sleep, the commoner seized his chance. He let down the drawbridge and the peasant mob, which had been waiting outside the castle, stormed in. They caused a bloodbath, stole what they could and burned the castle to the ground. = Punker of Rohrbach = The squire, Punker of Rohrbach, once worked for the knight of the castle and served him well. So one day he asked his master to make him a junker. When the knight refused him contemptuously, he left the castle and joined the army of the Count Palatine, Louis the Bearded. He was welcomed; his skills as an archer were widely known. Punker told the Count Palatine of several raids by the robber knight at the Lindelbrunn, whereupon the Count Palatine sent his troops to the castle. But the castle was well defended and the attack went nowhere. Then Punker climbed a nearby rock, which was higher than the castle and managed to fire an arrow into the heart of the robber baron of Lindelbrunn. Punker continued to fire and hit all the defenders of the castle. The troops of the Count Palatine were able to break down the gate, but all their opponents in the castle were already dead or dying, struck down by the Punker's arrows. The Count Palatine could not believe what he saw, suspected Punker of a lust for revenge guided by a magic hand and had imprisoned him for life in the tower. Punker died within the damp walls and his lament is sung today even by the thrushes at Lindelbrunn. According to another legend, the Count Palatine was suspicious of Punker and wanted to test his accuracy as an archer. To do this Punker was asked to place a coin on the head of his son and shoot it off without injuring the boy. Punker refused out of fear that the devil could jog his hand and so his son would die. But the Count Palatine insisted on the trial on pain of death. Punker shot the coin from the head of his son without even grazing him and prepared another one even during the flight of the first. The Count Palatine was pleased but he asked Punker why he had prepared the second arrow. Punker replied that if his son had died, the second arrow would have been for him (the Count Palatine).

It originally aired on December 2, 2010. The episode was written by Caroline Dries and directed by Ralph Hemecker. Plot The episode starts with Elena (Nina Dobrev) hearing a noise in the middle of the night; she gets up to check what it is and runs into Alaric (Matt Davis) and Jenna (Sara Canning). The three of them start talking while Jonas (Randy J. Goodwin), who is in the house, gets into Elena's bedroom and steals some of Elena's personal items. Jonas manages to get out before Elena sees him. Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder) go to see Katherine at the tomb and ask for the moonstone. Katherine refuses to give it to them unless they get a witch to get her out of the tomb with the promise that she'll leave Mystic Falls and never come back. The brothers go to Elena's house to inform her about their plan: de-spell the moonstone so Klaus will not be able to use it to break the curse. They just need Bonnie (Kat Graham) to drop the spell for a few moments so they can get into the tomb and get the moonstone from Katherine. Elena does not agree with their plan because Klaus will get there and kill them all. Bonnie and Luka (Bryton James) talk and Bonnie tells him about the nosebleeds she has and he informs her that is because she is doing too much magic. He also introduces her to a new \\"trick\\" where witches can channel their energy to other witches and they switch personal items to show her how it's done. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) arrives and Luka goes, without returning Bonnie's bracelet to her and not taking his tags back. Elena gets to the Salvatore house to speak with Rose (Lauren Cohan) and she asks her to take her to Slater (Trevor Peterson) so she can find out more about the moonstone. Rose refuses to do it but she changes her mind when Elena promises her that she knows a witch that can make her a daylight ring. They arrive at Slater's apartment only to find him dead. Elena tries to get into his computer to find the info she needs but cannot gets past the security password. They hear a noise and discover that Slater's girlfriend Alice (Bree Condon) is hiding in the closet crying. Matt (Zach Roerig) approaches Tyler (Michael Trevino) to apologize for picking up a fight with him that led to Sara's death. Caroline (Candice Accola) joins them and when Matt leaves she tries to talk to Tyler about his first transformation and if he has any plans for it. Tyler does not want to tell her at first but he eventually takes her to the old Lockwood cellar where Mason (Taylor Kinney) chained himself up during the full moons. Tyler's plan is to chain himself up like Mason so he will not hurt anyone when he becomes a wolf. At the cellar, they find Mason's journal where he describes everything about his first transformation along with a USB stick. Back at the Salvatore house, Bonnie tells Damon, Stefan and Jeremy that she can lift the tomb spell for a while so they can take the moonstone. Jeremy worries about her after the nosebleeds and tries to change her mind but he cannot do it. Bonnie has something more in her mind and asks for something that belonged to Katherine. Stefan brings the photograph of Katherine from 1964 and Bonnie burns it while chanting a spell. Damon wonders what it is about and Bonnie explains that if they toss the ash to Katherine then she will not be able to do anything for a while. Jeremy is still worrying about Bonnie, so to spare her from doing the spell at the tomb, he steals some of the ashes and decides to go alone to the tomb and take the moonstone. Elena tries to console Alice and also asks her to help them get into Slater's files. Alice does not want to help but she changes her mind when Elena tells her that if she does, Rose will turn her into a vampire. With Alice's help, they find another contact of Slater's, Cody (James Harvey Ward), and Elena sends him a message to deliver to Klaus: that the doppelganger is alive and wants to surrender. Rose realizes that this was Elena's plan since the beginning and not to learn more about the moonstone. She tries to change her mind but Elena does not want to hear it, so Rose calls Damon. In the meantime, Elijah (Daniel Gillies) wants to find out where Elena is. Jonas uses Elena's things he took from her bedroom and with a spell, he can make Elijah see where Elena is. At Caroline's house, Caroline and Tyler continue to read Mason's journal and also see the footage off the USB. Mason taped his first transformation and described everything about it in his journal. Tyler freaks out with the video and the details and he does not want to go through it but Caroline tries to encourage him and lets him know that she will be there with him. The door bell rings and Matt is at the door. He tries to tell Caroline that he misses her when Tyler comes to the door and Matt feels awkward. Jeremy gets to the tomb alone to take the moonstone. He stakes Katherine and tosses the ashes to her and she collapses. He gets into the tomb and starts searching for the moonstone. Jeremy finds the moonstone but not before Katherine awakes. She attacks him and drinks his blood but Jeremy manages to throw the moonstone out of the tomb. Stefan and Bonnie arrive at the tomb, find the moonstone, and wonder what happened. Katherine appears with Jeremy and tells them that they will not get him back until they let her out. Bonnie starts the spell so Stefan can get into the tomb and get Jeremy out. At the same time, Luka gets back home from school and he starts to feel Bonnie channeling his powers. He tells his father that he let Bonnie channel with him earlier because he asked him to bond with her and now she is channeling him for some spell. Both Luka and Bonnie begin to nosebleed and Stefan tries to stop Bonnie while Luka collapses. Bonnie falls unconscious and when she gets back she realizes that she can't do the spell, even with help. Katherine gets the opportunity to torture Jeremy and Stefan rushes into the tomb to save him. He manages to get Jeremy out of the tomb but now he is trapped inside it with Katherine. Damon arrives at Slater's apartment to get Elena out of there but she refuses to go with him since she is determined to sacrifice herself to save everyone she loves. Cody arrives minutes later with two other vampires to take Elena and Damon gets ready to defend her. Elijah arrives and when he learns that no one else knows that Elena is there, he kills Cody and the two other vampires and then leaves, leaving Damon and Elena wondering why he did that. Elijah gets back to Jonas house and after he asks about Luka's health, he explains that he did not kill Damon because both Salvatore brothers would do anything to protect Elena and for now, this is exactly what he wants too. Elena gets back home with Damon to learn from Jeremy that Stefan is stuck in the tomb with Katherine. Elena runs to the tomb but Damon follows her and stops her before she gets in.

William Dool Killen Life Born at Church Street, Ballymena, County Antrim, on 16 April 1806, he was third of four sons and nine children of John Killen (1768‚Äì1828), a grocer and seedsman in Ballymena, by his wife Martha, daughter of Jesse Dool, a farmer in Duneane. His paternal grandfather, a farmer at Carnmoney, married Blanche Brice, a descendant of Edward Brice; a brother, James Miller Killen (1815‚Äì1879) was minister in Comber, County Down. Thomas Young Killen was his father's great- nephew. After attending local primary schools, Killen went around 1816 to Ballymena Academy, and in November 1821 entered the collegiate department of the Royal Academical Institution, Belfast, under James Thomson. He was in 1827 licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Ballymena, and on 11 November 1829 ordained minister at Raphoe, County Donegal. In July 1841 Killen was appointed, by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, its professor of church history, ecclesiastical government, and pastoral theology, in succession to James Seaton Reid. He concentrated on history. When Assembly's College, Belfast was set up in 1853, he became one of the professors there. In 1869 he was appointed president of the college, in succession to Henry Cooke, and undertook fundraising for professorial endowments and new buildings. In 1889 Killen resigned his chair, but continued as president. He died on 10 January 1902, and was buried in Balmoral Cemetery, Belfast, where a monument marked his resting place. He received the degrees of D.D. (1845) and of LL.D. (1901) from the University of Glasgow. His portrait, painted by Richard Hooke, hung in the Gamble Library of the Assembly's College. Works Killen wrote extensively on history. His major works were: * Continuation of James Seaton Reid's History of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland to 1841, Belfast, 1853. * The Ancient Church. Its History, Doctrine, Worship, and Constitution traced for the First Three Hundred Years, 1859. * Memoir of John Edgar, D.D., LL.D., Belfast, 1867. * The Old Catholic Church. The History, Doctrine, Worship, and Polity of the Christians traced from the Apostolic Age to the Establishment of the Pope as a Temporal Sovereign, A.D. 755, Edinburgh, 1871. * The Ecclesiastical History of Ireland from the Earliest Period to the Present Times, 2 vols. 1875. * The Ignatian Epistles entirely Spurious. A Reply to Bishop Lightfoot, Edinburgh, 1886. * The Framework of the Church. A Treatise on Church Government, Edinburgh, 1890. * Reminiscences of a Long Life, 1901. He edited, with introductions and notes: * The Siege of Derry, by John Mackenzie, Belfast, 1861. * The Rise and Progress of the Presbyterian Government in the North of Ireland, by Patrick Adair. * History of the Church of Ireland, by Andrew Stewart, Belfast, 1866. * History of Congregations of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, mainly by James Seaton Reid, Belfast, 1886. Killen took part in a bitter controversy concerning the relative merits of prelacy and presbyterianism, which was provoked by four sermons preached in 1837 in St. Columb's cathedral, Londonderry, by Archibald Boyd. Killen and three other Presbyterian ministers replied in four sermons preached in Londonderry and published in 1839 with the title: Presbyterianism Defended.... A reply from Boyd and counter-replies from the four ministers ensued. One of these, The Plea of Presbytery (1840), which reached a third edition, earned for its authors a vote of thanks from the Synod of Ulster. Family Killen married in 1830 Anne (d. 1886), third daughter of Thomas Young of Ballymena, by whom he had three sons and five daughters.

It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. At Cannes, it won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and the Fran√ßois Chalais Prize. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, and has been nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language at the 69th British Academy Film Awards. It won Best Film at the 11th Africa Movie Academy Awards. The film was named the twelfth \\"Best Film of the 21st Century So Far\\" in 2017 by The New York Times. The film looks at the brief occupation of Timbuktu, Mali by Ansar Dine. Parts of the film were influenced by a 2012 public stoning of an unmarried couple in Aguelhok. It was shot in Oualata, a town in south-east Mauritania. Plot The film explores the denizens of the city of Timbuktu, Mali, in West Africa, who are living under strict sharia law around the year 2012. The city is under the occupation of extremist Islamists bearing a jihadist black flag. The dignified Kidane is a cattle herder who lives outside of the city. One day, one of his cows accidentally damages the net of a fisherman. The enraged fisherman kills the cow. Having armed himself with a pistol, Kidane confronts the fisherman and accidentally shoots him dead. The jihadists arrest Kidane and, per sharia law, offer to spare his life if the victim's family forgive him and he pays diya (blood money) of 40 cattle. Kidane's daughter corrals the cattle but no forgiveness is forthcoming so he is sentenced to death. His wife shows up at his execution and as they run to each other the executioners gun them down. Kidane's daughter flees. Themes Throughout the film, there are subsidiary scenes showing the reaction of the population to the jihadists' rule, which are portrayed as absurd. A female fishmonger must wear gloves even when selling fish. Music is banned; a woman is sentenced to 40 lashes for singing, and 40 lashes for being in the same room as a man not of her family. A couple are buried up to their necks in sand and stoned to death for adultery. Young men play football with an imaginary ball as sports are banned. A local imam tries to curb the jihadists' excesses with sermons. A young woman is forced into marriage to a young jihadi with the blessing of the occupiers who cherrypick sharia in justification. The film also acknowledges the failure of the occupiers to live up to their own rules. One of their leaders, Abdelkerim, is seen smoking a cigarette. At another point, he and a group of jihadists from France discuss their favorite football players. Characters speak in Tamasheq, Bambara, Arabic, French, and on a few occasions English. The mobile phone is an important means of communication.

During the summer of 2012, the couple was taken to the center of their village, placed in two holes that had been dug in the ground, and stoned to death in front of hundreds of witnesses. . According to the journalist Nicolas Beau, Sissako wanted to shoot a film on the bondage in Mauritania, denying his president Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. Sissako then accepted the shooting of a film on the jihadists, with the support of the Mauritanian regime that supplied finances and actorsAbderrahmane Sissako, une imposture mauritanienne, Mondafrique, 20 f√©vrier 2015.. Shortly before the opening of the film in Cannes in 2014, Sissako set off again to Tombouctou with a small team to add some scenes at the last minute. Reception =Critical reception= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 98% approval rating and an average rating of 8.80/10 based on 122 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Gracefully assembled and ultimately disquieting, Timbuktu is a timely film with a powerful message.\\" It also received a score of 92 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". According to both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, Timbuktu is the best reviewed foreign-language film of 2015. Jay Weissberg of Variety writes, \\"In the hands of a master, indignation and tragedy can be rendered with clarity yet subtlety, setting hysteria aside for deeper, more richly shaded tones. Abderrahmane Sissako is just such a master.\\" In a review for The Daily Telegraph, Tim Robey suggested it was a \\"wrenching tragic fable, Aesop-like in its moral clarity.\\" He went on to say it was \\"full of life, irony, poetry and bitter unfairness.\\" In the Financial Times, Nigel Andrews called it \\"skilful, sardonic, honourably humane.\\" Reviewing it for The Guardian, Jonathan Romney called it, \\"witty, beautiful and even, sobering though it is, highly entertaining\\" as well as \\"mischievous and imaginative.\\" He concluded that it was \\"a formidable statement of resistance.\\" Sight & Sounds Nick Pinkerton says \\"The fact remains that there are few filmmakers alive today wearing a mantle of moral authority comparable to that which Sissako has taken upon himself, and if his film has been met with an extraordinary amount of acclaim, it is because he manages to wear this mantle lightly, and has not confused drubbing an audience with messages with profundity. I can‚Äôt imagine the film having been made any other way, by anyone else ‚Äì and this is one measure of greatness.\\" =Accolades= The film won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 2016, it was voted the 36th best film of the 21st century as picked by 177 film critics from around the world.

They are designated as ancient monuments. The barrows sit on crests of land at either end of a field in an area of the Mendip Hills with several Neolithic remains. They are assumed to be related to the Priddy Circles which lie to the north. Ashen Hill consists of six bowl barrows and two bell barrows aligned east to west while Priddy Nine Barrows divided into one group of seven round barrows and another pair slightly separated from the others. Excavations in 1815 uncovered cremation burials and grave goods. A geophysical magnetometry survey suggested that there may have been three further barrows. Location 400px The field where the monuments are located is south of the Priddy Circles, a linear arrangement of four circular earthwork enclosures described as 'probable Neolithic ritual or ceremonial monuments similar to a henge'. It is approximately east of the village of Priddy itself and west of Stock Hill a Forestry Commission plantation. Between the barrows and Stock Hill is the Priddy Mineries, a nature reserve of the Somerset Wildlife Trust, which is itself a part of the Priddy Pools Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which was worked for lead for many centuries. The cemeteries sit on the two highest ridges in the area with Priddy Nine Barrows being above sea level and Ashen Hill at . Description =Ashen Hill= Ashen Hill Barrow Cemetery is the most northerly of the sites and consists of six bowl barrows and two bell barrows aligned east to west, although :Lewes suggests that three may be bell barrows. Each of the mounds is between and in diameter and rising to between and high. Each is surrounded by a ditch which has become infilled over time. To the north and east of the barrows are further signs of excavations but these were related to lead extraction. =Priddy Nine Barrows= The southern area consists of the Priddy Nine Barrows which is divided into one group of seven round barrows and another pair. The group of seven are in a line on the crest of North Hill. Each is between and in diameter and rises to between and high. Each is surrounded by a shallow ditch which has become partly infilled. The tops of some of the barrows have indentations which are believed to have been caused by early 19th century excavations. The pair of bowl barrows are approximately north of the most westerly of the group of seven, with a between them. Similarly to the other seven they are around in diameter and rise to between and high. They have been known as Priddy Nine Barrows since 1296. Excavations and investigations In 1815 John Skinner carried out a partial excavation and identified cremation burials in an oval cyst which was covered by a flat stone just below where ground level would have been in the Bronze Age. He also uncovered bronze daggers and spear head, decorative amber beads, a bronze ring and a small incense cup. At least one of the Ashen Hill Barrows was excavated by a team led by Herbert E. Balch in 1894. They were scheduled as ancient monuments in 1933, possibly to stop excavation by the University of Bristol Spel√¶ological Society and local schools. A geophysical magnetometry survey investigated the area between the existing seven and the outliers which make up Priddy Nine Barrows suggesting that there may have been three further barrows, however the work was inconclusive. The result suggested a ring ditch and some other disturbances by any further barrows could have been disturbed by lead mining.

The decades of lynchings and long-term racial discrimination were first formally described as genocide by a now defunct organization, the Civil Rights Congress, in a petition which it submitted to the United Nations in 1951. In the 1960s, Malcolm X accused the US government of engaging in genocide against Black people, citing long-term injustice, cruelty, and violence against Blacks by Whites. Some accusations of genocide have been described as conspiracy theories. In response to the War on Poverty legislation proposed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the mid-1960s, which included public funding of the Pill for the poor, at the first Black Power Conference, which was held in July 1967, family planning (birth control) was said to be \\"Black genocide.\\" After abortion was more widely legalized in 1970, some Black militants named abortion specifically as part of the conspiracy theory. Most African-American women were not convinced of a conspiracy, and rhetoric about race genocide faded. However, 1973 media revelations about decades of government-sponsored compulsory sterilization led some to say that this was part of a plan for Black genocide. During the Vietnam War, the increasing use of Black soldiers in combat provided another basis for the accusation of a government supported \\"Black genocide.\\" In recent decades, the disproportionately high Black prison population has also been cited to support the claim of Black genocide. Slavery as genocide Throughout the existence of the enslavement of Africans in the US, instances demonstrative of genocide have arguably occurred countless times. Professor Walter Johnson at Harvard University depicts in his book, The Broken Heart of America, numerous accounts of violence displayed against Black Americans. One instance depicts how enslaved men would be separated from their wives. Such practices would inevitably serve as a method of population control by altering natural reproduction patterns. On another occasion, after not being able to find his keys, one slave owner brutally murdered his slave, and was later acquitted by a jury after a one-day trial. Johnson noted that this case was similar to the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, a Black teenager killed in Ferguson, Missouri. Johnson argues that the violence of the slavery era is still present in modern times. For a Black American living in the era of U.S. slavery, no rights were guaranteed, whether they were personally enslaved or not. Walt Whitman, a U.S. poet, stated that it was the law of history for the Black race to be eliminated.This image demonstrates segregations laws in practice in the Jim Crow era. Jim Crow as genocide =Petition to the United Nations= The United Nations (UN) was formed in 1945. The UN debated and adopted a Genocide Convention in late 1948, holding that genocide was the \\"intent to destroy, in whole or in part\\", a racial group. Based on the \\"in part\\" definition, the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), a group composed of African Americans with Communist affiliations, presented to the UN in 1951 a petition called \\"We Charge Genocide.\\" The petition listed 10,000 unjust deaths of African Americans in the nine decades since the American Civil War. It described lynching, mistreatment, murder and oppression by Whites against Blacks, concluding that the US government was refusing to address \\"the persistent, widespread, institutionalized commission of the crime of genocide\\". The petition was presented to the UN convention in Paris by CRC leader William L. Patterson, and in New York City by the singer and actor Paul Robeson who was a civil rights activist and a Communist member of CRC.After World War II and following many years of mistreatment of African Americans by White Americans, the US government's official policies regarding this mistreatment shifted significantly. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said in 1946 that negative international opinion about US racial policies helped to pressure the US into alleviating the mistreatment of ethnic minorities. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed an order desegregating the military, and Black citizens increasingly challenged other forms of racial discrimination. Paul Robeson signed the We Charge Genocide petition. The Cold War raised American concerns about Communist expansionism. The CRC petition was viewed by the US government as being against America's best interests with regard to fighting Communism. The petition was ignored by the UN; many of the charter countries looked to the US for guidance and were not willing to arm the enemies of the US with more propaganda about its failures in domestic racial policy. American responses to the petition were various: Radio journalist Drew Pearson spoke out against the supposed \\"Communist propaganda\\" before it was presented to the UN. Professor Raphael Lemkin, a Polish lawyer who had helped draft the UN Genocide Convention, said that the CRC petition was a misguided effort which drew attention away from the Soviet Union's genocide of Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) issued a statement saying that there was no Black genocide even though serious matters of racial discrimination certainly did exist in America. Walter Francis White, leader of the NAACP, wrote that the CRC petition contained \\"authentic\\" instances of discrimination, mostly taken from reliable sources. He said, \\"Whatever the sins of the nation against the Negro‚Äîand they are many and gruesome‚Äîgenocide is not among them.\\" UN Delegate Eleanor Roosevelt said that it was \\"ridiculous\\" to characterize long term discrimination as genocide. The \\"We Charge Genocide\\" petition received more notice in international news than in domestic US media. French and Czech media carried the story prominently, as did newspapers in India. In 1952, African-American author J. Saunders Redding traveling in India was repeatedly asked questions about specific instances of civil rights abuse in the US, and the CRC petition was used by Indians to rebut his assertions that US race relations were improving. In the US, the petition faded from public awareness by the late 1950s. In 1964, Malcolm X and his Organization of Afro- American Unity, citing the same lynchings and oppression described in the CRC petition, began to prepare their own petition to the UN asserting that the US government was engaging in genocide against Black people. The 1964 Malcolm X speech \\"The Ballot or the Bullet\\" also draws from \\"We Charge Genocide\\". =Lynching and other racial killings= Arguably the first lynching to occur in the United States was that of Francis McIntosh, a free man of Black and white ancestry. Walter Johnson argued that this lynching ignited a series of them, all with the goal of \\"ethnic cleansing.\\" Even Abraham Lincoln, who was not yet president, was more concerned by the vigilantism of the lynching than the murder itself, going so far as to refer to McIntosh as \\"obnoxious\\" in his 1838 speech later dubbed the Lyceum Address. According to the National Memorial for Peace and Justice 4,400 Black people had been slain in lynchings and other racial killings between 1877 and 1950. Brandy Marie Langley argued, \\"The physical killing of black people in America, at this time period, was consistent with Lemkin‚Äôs original idea of genocide.\\" Lynching was so ubiquitous within the US that famous literary and social activist figures such as Mark Twain and Ida B. Wells were compelled to speak out about these killings . Twain's essay describing these horrific murders was titled \\"The United States of Lyncherdom,\\" a remark on widespread nature of lynchings in 1800s and 1900s US. =Sterilization= Beginning in 1907, some US state legislatures passed laws allowing for the compulsory sterilization of criminals, mentally retarded people, and institutionalized mentally ill patients. At first, African Americans and white Americans suffered sterilization in roughly equal ratio. By 1945, some 70,000 Americans had been sterilized in these programs. In the 1950s, the federal welfare program Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) was criticized by some whites who did not want to subsidize poor black families. College course study guide States such as North and South Carolina performed sterilization procedures on low- income black mothers who were giving birth to their second child. The mothers were told that they would have to agree to have their tubes tied or their welfare benefits would be cancelled, along with the benefits of the families they were born into. Because of such policies, especially prevalent in Southern states, sterilization of African Americans increased from 23% of the total in the 1930s and 1940s to 59% at the end of the 1950s, and rose further to 64% in the mid-1960s. In mid-1973 news stories revealed the forced sterilization of poor black women and children, paid for by federal funds. Two girls of the Relf family in Mississippi, deemed mentally incompetent at ages 12 and 14, and also 18-year-old welfare recipient Nial Ruth Cox of North Carolina, were prominent cases of involuntary sterilization.Critchlow 1999, p. 144 Jet magazine presented the story under the headline \\"Genocide\\". Critics said these stories were publicized by activists against legal abortion. Systemic racism as genocide =Vietnam War= African Americans pushed for equal participation in US military service in the first part of the 20th century and especially during World War II. Finally, President Harry S. Truman signed legislation to integrate the US military in 1948. However, Selective Service System deferments, military assignments, and especially the recruits accepted through Project 100,000 resulted in a greater representation of blacks in combat in the Vietnam War in the second half of the 1960s.Self 2012, p. 79 African Americans represented 11% of the US population but 12.6% of troops sent to Vietnam. As published in The Oxford Companion to American Military History (1999). Cleveland Sellers said that the drafting of poor black men into war was \\"a plan to commit calculated genocide\\".Social History of the United States, 2008, p. 53. Former SNCC chairman Stokely Carmichael, black congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. and SNCC member Rap Brown agreed.Social History of the United States, 2008, p. 54. In October 1969, King's widow Coretta Scott King spoke at an anti-war protest held at the primarily black Morgan State College in Baltimore. Campus leaders published a statement against what they termed \\"black genocide\\" in Vietnam, blaming President Richard Nixon in the US as well as President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu and Vice President Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ from South Vietnam. =Prison= In 1969, H. Rap Brown wrote in his autobiography, Die Nigger Die!, that American courts \\"conspire to commit genocide\\" against blacks by putting a disproportionate number of them in prison. Political scientist Joy A. James wrote that \\"antiblack genocide\\" is the motivating force which explains the way that US prisons are filled largely with black prisoners. Originally published as \\"The Dead Zone: Stumbling at the Crossroads of Party Politics, Genocide and Postracial Racism\\" in South Atlantic Quarterly, vol. 108, no. 3, Summer 2009, pp. 459‚Äì481. Author and former prisoner Mansfield B. Frazier contends that the rumor in American ghettos \\"that whites are secretly engaged in a program of genocide against the black race\\" is given \\"a measure of validity\\" by the number of \\"black men of child-producing age who are imprisoned for crimes for which men of other races are not. Conspiracy theories =Birth control= A falling birth rate has been identified by some observers as harmful to a race of people; for instance, in 1905 Teddy Roosevelt said that it was \\"race suicide\\" for white Americans if educated white women continued to have fewer children. Certain African-American leaders also taught that political power came with greater population. In 1934, Marcus Garvey and his Universal Negro Improvement Association resolved that birth control constituted black genocide. The combined oral contraceptive pill, popularly known as \\"the Pill\\", was approved for US markets in 1957 as a medicine, and in 1961 for birth control. In 1962, civil rights activist Whitney Young told the National Urban League not to support birth control for blacks. Marvin Davies, leader of the Florida chapter of the NAACP, said that black women should reject birth control and produce more babies so that black political influence would increase in the future. Lyndon B. Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr., agreed that birth control was beneficial to poor black families. The Pill was considered expensive by working-class women; the first users were upper- and middle-class women. After President Lyndon B. Johnson, as part of his War on Poverty, obtained legislation in 1964 for government funding of birth control, Black militants became more concerned about a possible government-sponsored black genocide. Cecil B. Moore, head of the NAACP chapter in Philadelphia, spoke out against a Planned Parenthood program which was to establish a stronger presence in northern Philadelphia; the population in the targeted neighborhoods was 70% black. Moore said it would be \\"race suicide\\" for blacks to embrace birth control. H. Rap Brown said that black genocide was based on four factors, including birth control. From 1965 to 1970, black militant males, especially younger men from poverty-stricken areas, spoke out against birth control as black genocide. The Black Panther Party and the Nation of Islam were the strongest voices. The Black Panther Party identified a number of injustices as contributing to black genocide, including social ills that were more serious in black populations, such as drug abuse, prostitution and sexually transmitted disease. Other injustices included unsafe housing, malnutrition and the over-representation of young black men on the front lines of the Vietnam War. Influential black activists such as singer/author Julius Lester and comedian Dick Gregory said that blacks should increase in population and avoid genocidal family planning measures. H. Rap Brown of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) held that black genocide consisted of four elements: more blacks executed than whites, malnutrition in impoverished areas affected blacks more than whites, the Vietnam War killed more blacks than whites, and birth control programs in black neighborhoods were trying to end the black race. A birth control clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, was torched by black militants who said it contributed to black genocide. Black Muslims said that birth control was against the teachings of the Koran, and that the role of women in Muslim society was to produce children. In this context, the Black Muslims felt that birth control was a genocidal attack by whites. The Muslim weekly journal, Muhammad Speaks, carried many articles demonizing birth control. In Newark, New Jersey, in July 1967, the Black Power movement held its first convention: the National Conference on Black Power. The convention identified several means by which whites were attempting the annihilation of blacks. Injustices in housing practices, reductions in welfare benefits, and government-subsidized family planning were named as elements of \\"black genocide\\". Ebony magazine printed a story in March 1968 which revealed that black genocide was believed by poor blacks to be the impetus behind government-funded birth control. Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., was a strong proponent of birth control for blacks. In 1966, he was honored with the Margaret Sanger Award in Human Rights, an award based on the tireless birth control activism of Margaret Sanger, a co-founder of Planned Parenthood. King emphasized that birth control gave the black man better command over his personal economic situation, keeping the number of his children within his monetary means. In April 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr., was shot and killed. Charles V. Willie wrote in 1971 that this event marked the beginning of serious reflection among African Americans \\"about the possibility of [black] genocide in America. There were lynchings, murders, and manslaughters in the past. But the assassination of Dr. King was too much. Many blacks believed that Dr. King had represented their best... If America could not accept Dr. King, then many felt that no black person in America was safe.\\" Angela Davis said that equating birth control with black genocide appeared to be \\"an exaggerated‚Äîeven paranoiac‚Äîreaction.\\" Reprint of 1981 original. Black women were generally critical of the Black Power rejection of birth control. In 1968, a group of black radical feminists in Mt. Vernon, New York issued \\"The Sisters Reply\\"; a rebuttal which said that birth control gave black women the \\"freedom to fight the genocide of black women and children,\\" referring to the greater death rate among children and mothers in poor families. Frances M. Beal, co-founder of the Black Women's Liberation Committee of the SNCC, refused to believe that the black woman must be subservient to the black man's wishes. Angela Davis and Linda LaRue reacted against the Black Power limitations directing women to serve as mothers producing \\"warriors for the revolution.\\" Toni Cade said that indiscriminate births would not bring the liberation of blacks closer to realization; she advocated the Pill as a tool to help space out the births of black children, to make it easier for families to raise them. The Black Women's Liberation Group accused \\"poor black men\\" of failing to support the babies they helped produce, therefore supplying young black women with reason to use contraceptives. Dara Abubakari, a black separatist, wrote that \\"women should be free to decide if and when they want children\\". A 1970 study found that 80% of black women in Chicago approved of birth control, and that 75% of women in their child-bearing years were using it. A 1971 study found that a majority of black men and women were in favor of government-subsidized birth control. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a community struggle for and against a birth control clinic in the Homewood area of east Pittsburgh made national news. Women in Pittsburgh had lobbied for a birth control clinic in the 1920s and were relieved in 1931 when the American Birth Control League (ABCL) established one. The ABCL changed its name in 1942 to Planned Parenthood. The Pittsburgh clinic initiated an educational outreach program to poor families in the Lower Hill District in 1956. This program was twinned into the poverty-stricken Homewood-Brushton area in 1958. Planned Parenthood considered opening another clinic there, and conducted meetings with community leaders. In 1963 a mobile clinic was moved around the area. In December 1965, the Planned Parenthood Clinic of Pittsburgh (PPCP) applied for federal funding based on the War on Poverty legislation Johnson had promoted. In May 1966 the application was approved, and PPCP began to establish clinics throughout Pittsburgh, a total of 18 by 1967, 11 of these subsidized by the federal government and placed in poor districts. In mid-1966 the Pennsylvania state legislature held up family planning funds in committee. Catholic bishops gained media exposure for their assertion that Pittsburgh birth control efforts were a form of covert black genocide. In November 1966 the bishops said that the government was coercing poor people to have smaller families. Some black leaders such as local NAACP member Dr. Charles Greenlee agreed with the bishops that birth control was black genocide. Greenlee said Planned Parenthood was \\"an honorable and good organization\\" but that the federal Office of Economic Opportunity was sponsoring genocidal programs. Greenlee said \\"the Negro's birth rate is the only weapon he has. When he reaches 21 he can vote.\\" Greenlee targeted the Homewood clinic for closure; in doing so he allied with black militant William \\"Bouie\\" Haden and Catholic prelate Charles Owen Rice to speak out against black genocide, and against PPCP's educational outreach program. Planned Parenthood's Director of Community Relations Dr. Douglas Stewart said that the false charge of black genocide was harming the national advancement of blacks. In July 1968, Haden announced he was willing to blow up the clinic to keep it from operating. The Catholic church paid him a salary of $10,000, igniting an outcry in Pittsburgh media. Bishop John Wright was called a \\"puppet of Bouie Haden\\". The PPCP closed the Homewood clinic in July 1968 and stopped its educational program because of concerns about violence. The black congregation of the Bethesda United Presbyterian Church issued a statement saying that accusations of black genocide were \\"patently false\\". A meeting was scheduled for March 1969 to discuss the issue. About 200 women, mostly black, appeared in support of the clinic, and it was reopened. This was seen as a major defeat for the black militant notion that government-funded birth control was black genocide. Other prominent black advocates for birth control included Carl Rowan, James Farmer, Bayard Rustin, Jerome H. Holland, Ron Dellums and Barbara Jordan. In the US in the 21st century, black people are most likely to be at risk of unintended pregnancy: 84% of black women of reproductive age use birth control, in contrast to 91% of Caucasian and Hispanic women, and 92% of Asian Americans. This results in black women having the highest rate of unintended pregnancy‚Äîin 2001, almost 10% of black women giving birth between the ages of 15 to 44 had unintended pregnancies, which was more than twice the rate of white women. Poverty affects these statistics, as low-income women are more likely to experience disruption in their lives; disruption which affects the steady use of birth control. People in poor areas are more suspicious of the health care system, and they may refuse medical treatment and advice, especially for less-critical wellness treatments such as birth control. =Abortion= Slave women brought with them from Africa the knowledge of traditional folk birth control practices, and of abortion obtained through the use of herbs, blunt trauma, and other methods of killing the fetus or producing strong uterine cramps. Slave women were often expected to breed more slave children to enrich their owners, but some quietly rebelled. In 1856 a white doctor reported that a number of slave owners were upset that their slaves appeared to hold a \\"secret by which they destroy the foetus at an early age of gestation\\".Silliman 2004, p. 51 However, this folk knowledge was suppressed in the new American culture, especially by the nascent American Medical Association, and its practice fell away. After slavery ended, black women formed social groups and clubs in the 1890s to \\"uplift their race.\\" The revolutionary idea that a black woman might enjoy a full life without ever being a mother was presented in Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin's magazine The Woman's Era. Knowledge was secretly shared among clubwomen regarding how to find practitioners offering illegal medical or traditional abortion services. Working-class black women, who were more often forced into having sex with white men, continued to have a need for birth control and abortions. Black women who earned less than $10 per day paid $50 to $75 for an illegal and dangerous abortion. Throughout the 20th century, \\"backstreet\\" abortion providers in black neighborhoods were also sought out by poor white women who wanted to rid themselves of pregnancies. Abortion providers who were black were prosecuted much more often than white ones were. In the Tennessee General Assembly in 1967, Dorothy Lavinia Brown, MD, the first African-American woman surgeon and a state assemblywoman, was the first American to sponsor a proposed bill to fully legalize abortion. Though this early effort failed, abortion was made legal in various US states from 1967 to 1972. During this time the Black Panthers printed pamphlets which described abortion as black genocide, expanding on their earlier stance with regard to family planning. However, most minority groups stood in favor of the decriminalization of abortion; The New York Times reported in 1970 that more non-white women than white women died as a result of \\"crude, illegal abortions\\". Legalized abortion was expected to produce fewer deaths of the mother. A poll in Buffalo, New York, conducted by the National Organization for Women (NOW), found that 75% of blacks supported the decriminalization of abortion. In the 1970s, Jesse Jackson spoke out against abortion as a form of black genocide. After the January 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision made abortion legal in the US, Jet magazine publisher Robert E. Johnson authored an article titled \\"Legal Abortion: Is It Genocide Or Blessing In Disguise?\\" Johnson cast the issue as one which polarized the black community along gender lines: black women generally viewed abortion as a \\"blessing in disguise\\" but black men such as Reverend Jesse Jackson viewed it as black genocide. Jackson said he was in favor of birth control but not abortion. The next year, Senator Mark Hatfield, an activist against legal abortion, emphasized to Congress that Jackson \\"regards abortion as a form of genocide practiced against blacks.\\" In Jet, Johnson quoted Lu Palmer, a radio journalist in Chicago, who said that there was inequity between the sexes: a young black man who helped create an unwanted pregnancy could go his \\"merry way\\" while the young woman who had been involved in it was stigmatized by society and saddled with a financial and emotional burden, often without a safety net of caregivers to sustain her. Civil rights lawyer Florynce Kennedy criticized the idea that black women were needed to populate the Black Power revolution. She said that black majorities in the Deep South were not known to be hotbeds of revolution, and that limiting black women to the role of mothers was \\"not too far removed from a cultural past where Black women were encouraged to be breeding machines for their slave masters.\\" Tennessee Assemblywoman Dorothy Brown said black women \\"should dispense quickly the notion that abortion is genocide.‚Äù Rather, they should look to the earliest Atlantic slave traders as the root of genocide. Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm wrote in 1970 that the linking of abortion and genocide \\"is male rhetoric, for male ears.\\" However, a link between abortion and black genocide has been claimed by later observers. Mildred Fay Jefferson, a surgeon and an activist against legal abortion, wrote about black genocide in 1978, saying \\"abortionists have done more to get rid of generations and cripple others than all of the years of slavery and lynching.\\" In 2009, American pro-life activists in Georgia revived the idea that a black genocide was in progress. A strong response from this strategy was observed among blacks, and in 2010 more focus was placed on describing abortion as black genocide. White pro-life activist Mark Crutcher produced a documentary called Maafa 21 which criticizes Planned Parenthood and its founder Margaret Sanger, and describes various historic aspects of eugenics, birth control and abortion with the aim of convincing the viewer that abortion is black genocide. Pro- life activists showed the documentary to black audiences across the US. The film was criticized as propaganda and a false representation of Sanger's work. In March 2011, a series of abortion-as-genocide billboard advertisements were shown in South Chicago, an area with a large population of African Americans. From May to November 2011, presidential candidate Herman Cain criticized Planned Parenthood, calling abortion \\"planned genocide\\" and \\"black genocide\\". After Stacey Abrams lost the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election, anti- abortion activist Arthur A. Goldberg wrote that she lost in part because of her stance in favor of abortion rights, which he said ignored \\"the staggering number of abortions in the black community\\" which amounted to black genocide. In 2019, The New York Times wrote that \\"the abortion debate is inextricably tied to race\\" in the view of black American communities that are challenged with many other racial disparities which together constitute black genocide. Analysis In 1976, sociologist Irving Louis Horowitz published an analysis of black genocide and concluded that racist vigilantism and sporadic actions by individual whites were to blame for the various statistics which show that blacks experience higher death rates than whites do. Horowitz concluded that the US government could not be implicated as a conspirator and there was no conspiracy to engage in a concerted black genocide. Political scientist Joy A. James wrote in 2013 that the \\"logical conclusion\\" of American racism is genocide and members of the black elite are complicit, along with white Americans, in carrying out black genocide.James 2013, pp. 270, 277.

It is an important monument of Romanesque architecture and it is ranked among the most beautiful buildings of this style to be seen in Liguria. It is an Italian national monument since 1890.  Architecture and history of the church  The church has two phases of use: Paleochristian (5th‚Äì6th century) and Romanesque (11th century). It is dedicated to St. Paragorius, a saint who fled with his companions from Libia, to escape from persecution under Diocletian (end of the 3rd century), took refuge in Corsica, in the town of Calenzana, and there was martyred. In the 5th‚Äì6th century his relics were taken to Noli, as the island was threatened with invasions of Vandals. Presence of the remains of the saint resulted in development of the religious complex. It was restored by an architect Alfredo D'Andrade after the earthquake of 1887. The entrance is found on the left side of the church. The white and black coloring of the portal (from 13th century) matches the gothic protruding porch, made of stone and bricks, supported by two columns. To the left of the entrance located are two monumental arcosolium tombs (13th‚Äì14th century). Still can be seen some traces of frescos attributed to celebrated Lombardian artists. On the right of the protruding porch situated is the tomb of Gandolfo De Gasco (1272), as can be read from the Gothic inscription. Between the church and the surrounding wall can be seen four Paleochristian sarcophagi (5th‚Äì7th centuries), discovered during the archaeological excavations. It is worth noting that the central apse is decorated with eleven Islamic bowls, above the row of small blind arches. These decorative elements (recently taken for restoration, the present ones are copies) are among the most ancient walled bowls in Liguria (from about 1050 AD). Important archaeological excavations were carried in the 70's by Nino Lamboglia in the area around the church. Found were remains of a Paleochristan baptistery and late antique necropolis. Later excavations under the Ligurian Archaeological Superintendence showed also remains of a settlement of craftsmen and of the early church edifice (6th century). The church is subdivided into three naves with semi-circular apses. The central nave is separated by massive pillars, decorated with different forms, supporting large semi-circular arches. The roof above the central nave rests on decorative wooden trusses (an original piece is exposed on the back wall of the left nave). The presbytery can be reached along a ramp. It is decorated with fifteen tall niches resting on a bench running all along the central apse. In these niches visible are three 15th-century fresco paintings: in the rectangular central niche there is a crucifix, and in the two lateral niches there are the images of St. Peter and St. Paul. On the left wall of the presbytery we can see a marble Renaissance tabernacle carrying the donor's name, the bishop of Noli, Vincenzo Boverio (bishop of years 1506‚Äì1519, from family of pope Julian II). To the right of the altar there is a copy of the bishop's cathedra (throne, from 1239). On its wooden back engraved is the crest of the Genoese bishop of Noli, Paolo Giustiniani (bishop of years 1459‚Äì1485). The crypt can be reached by descending the stairs to either side of the presbytery. The place became a crypt only in the 11th century, during the erection of the Romanesque church. Previously, in these place stood two little chapels, built in the 4th‚Äì5th century directly on the sandy ground (that is three meters down from present ground level). Inside it is possible to see Roman monolithic columns, reused as support by Medieval builders. Coming back to the ground floor, in the right nave, can be seen an octagonal baptismal font for full immersion (rebuilt in 1889). Also on the right, closer to the presbytery, exposed is a beautifully painted wooden crucifix, namely \\"Holy Face\\", with a sculpture of martyred Jesus in characteristic long surplice (colobium) of oriental origin (dated to 12th century). Nearby stands the pulpit, also rebuild in 1889, from several remaining marble panels.

Life The second son of Thomas Manningham, he was born at Eversley, Hampshire. He was intended, like his elder brother Thomas, for the church, and educated at Cambridge, where he graduated LL.B. in 1717. He later (1725) was mandated to take the degree of M.D. Manningham took a house in Chancery Lane, London, and lived there till 1729, when he moved to the Haymarket, then in 1734 to Woodstock Street, and in the following year to Jermyn Street, where he resided for the rest of his life. On 10 March 1720 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and on 30 September in the same year was admitted a licentiate of the London College of Physicians. On 18 February 1721 he was knighted by George I. He was the leading man-midwife of his day, and was sometimes engaged in the summer to attend ladies in the country. In 1739 Manningham established a ward in the parochial infirmary of St. James's, Westminster, for parturient women, the first ward of the kind established in Great Britain; he lectured there on midwifery. He died 11 May 1759 at Chelsea and was buried there. Thomas Denman praised Manningham as \\"successful in practice and very humane in the exercise of his art\\". Works In 1726 Manningham published Exact Diary of what was observed during a close attendance upon Mary Toft the pretended Rabbit Breeder. Mary Toft of Godalming declared that she had given birth to several rabbits, and fragments of these were produced. Manningham, working with James Douglas, showed that these were pieces of adult and not of young rabbits, and that Toft was not parturient. They absolved the credulous Nathaniel St Andr√© of complicity. In the aftermath, William Hogarth drew Toft, London gossiped of the affair, and Manningham's name became more widely known. Manningham published in 1740 Artis Obstetricari√¶ Compendium; the parts of the subject of obstetrics are arranged in tabular forms, each tabulation being followed by a series of aphorisms. An English translation was published in 1744. In 1750 appeared his Treatise on the Symptoms, Nature, Causes, and Cure of the Febricula or Little Fever, which reached a third edition in 1755. The term \\"febricula\\" came into use; Manningham described under this one heading enteric fever, phlebitis, and the common cold. In 1756 he published in Latin Aphorismata Medica, an enlarged edition of his Compendium; and in 1758 A Discourse concerning the Plague and Pestilential Fevers, an enlargement of The Plague no Contagious Disorder, a pamphlet which he had issued anonymously in 1744. Family Thomas Manningham, his second son, graduated M.D. at the University of St Andrews, 24 May 1765, and became a licentiate of the London College of Physicians 25 June. He lived in his father's house in Jermyn Street, London, till 1780, when he went to Bath, Somerset, and died there 3 February 1794.

The collection ranges from the 15th to the 19th century. The Gruuthuse Presumably in the 13th century, a rich family from Bruges received the monopoly to levy taxes on gruit, and built a storage for it. The building was changed in the early fifteenth century by Jan IV van der Aa to a luxury house for his family, which subsequently changes its name to \\"Van Gruuthuse\\" (\\"From the Gruit house\\"). His son Louis de Gruuthuse adds a second wing to the house, and in 1472 a chapel. This connects the house to the adjacent Church of Our Lady, Bruges. In 1596, the house is bought by king Philip II of Spain and in 1623 given to Wenceslas Cobergher to house the Bruges mount of piety. The city of Bruges bought the house in 1875, and architect Louis Delacenserie completely restored it between 1883 and 1895. The exterior is partly original, partly a reconstruction; the interior is mostly a late 19th century Neogothical reconstruction of a medieval interior.

The museum displays both the interior of a house of a rich family as it would have been in the late Middle Ages, and a collection of everyday tools and utensils. On display are furniture, bobbin lace, objects in gold and silver, weapons, musical instruments, and ceramics. The most famous object in the collection is the painted terracotta bust of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor from 1520, attributed to Conrat Meit. Another highlight is the collection of Flemish tapestries from the 16th and 17th century.

He played on the right wing. He went on to play non-league football for Gateshead. Life and career Holbrook was born in Richmond, Yorkshire, where he attended Richmond Secondary Modern School. He was capped several times for England Schoolboys. He scored the winning goal against their Welsh counterparts, and the Times gave him a glowing report, albeit in a losing cause, against the German Schoolboys at Wembley in April 1968: He began his football career as an apprentice with Hull City, and made his first-team debut for the club on 7 November 1970, in a 2‚Äì0 home defeat to Luton Town in the Second Division. After playing just twice more over the next 18 months, he moved on to Fourth Division club Darlington. Over five seasons with Darlington, he played 131 matches in all competitions and scored 13 goals, all but one in the league. That goal came in the 1975‚Äì76 League Cup against Sheffield Wednesday, newly relegated from the Second Division. Darlington had lost the home leg 2‚Äì0, but in the second leg, at Wednesday's Hillsborough ground, Holbrook opened the scoring in the second half, the match ended 2‚Äì2, and Darlington won the replay and went on to reach the last 32 of the competition. Speaking 25 years later, he described the goal as \\"An absolute pearler. I wouldn't care, I was whinging to the referee because someone was pulling me back and he just said 'There's the ball' and I hit it. Afterwards we were running back and the ref asked me if I was satisfied. After winning at Hillsborough, I think I probably was.\\" Holbrook made a transfer request in 1977, left the club and signed with Gateshead, playing in the Northern Premier League. He scored 34 goals from 156 appearances in senior competition for Gateshead over six seasons, in the last of which they won the Northern Premier League title. Holbrook's employment after retiring from football included operating a car hire company in Darlington.

History The predecessor of Nash Sovremennik was the Maxim Gorky-founded Almanac that was coming out in 1933-1937 and in 1949-1955, 1 to 4 times a year. The Almanac's title was chronologically changing, from Year XVI (1933) to Year XXXVIII (1956), the point of reference being 1917, the year of the Socialist Revolution. In 1956 the Almanac changed its name to Nash Sovremennik and up until 1964 was coming out as a quarterly. Initially it belonged to the Union of Writers of the USSR, since 1958 it moved under the jurisdiction of the RSFSR Union of Writers. Nash Sovremenniks first editors-in-chief were Viktor Poltoratsky (1956-1958, an editorial staff member up until 1973) and Boris Zubavin (1958-1968). In its early years the magazine had as its main purpose seeking out new literary talents in the Russian province. In 1969 Nash Sovremenniks editor became Sergey Vikulov who gathered around him a strong team of contributors, including Fyodor Abramov, Viktor Astafyev, Valentin Rasputin, Vasily Belov, Yuri Bondarev, Sergey Zalygin, Yuri Kazakov, Viktor Likhonosov, Yevgeny Nosov, Vladimir Soloukhin, Valentin Sorokin and Vasily Shukshin. Vikulov departed in 1989, succeeded by Stanislav Kunyaev. By this time Nash Sovremennik has found itself in the center of the bitter faction struggle in the Soviet literature and journalism, representing (alongside Moskva and Molodaya Gvardia magazines) the conservative, neo-Slavophile flank, opposing the Western-style liberalism (associated in those years with Oktyabr and Znamya, with Novy Mir balancing in the center). In 1990 it reached its highest point of popularity with the circulation figures around 480 thousand. In 1990s Nash Sovremennik became the organ of the newly formed conservative Union of Writers of Russia, a bitter rival to the pro-liberal Union of Russian Writers. Among its consistent contributors were Vladimir Bogomolov, Sergey Kara-Murza, Vadim Kozhinov, Vladimir Krupin, Yuri Kuznetsov, Mikhail Lobanov, Alexander Prokhanov and later, in the 2000s, Zakhar Prilepin, Mikhail Popov, Irina Mamayeva, Yuri Kozlov among others. Still led by Kunyayev, the magazine remains true to its once declared 'patriotic' course, but its circulation has fallen to 9 thousand, as of 2008.

Stax Music Academy The Soulsville Foundation operates Stax Music Academy and the adjacent Stax Museum at 926 McLemore Avenue in the former location of Stax Records. The original building, a converted movie theatre where artists such as Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, Booker T. & the MGs, Sam & Dave, and many others recorded in the '60s and '70s, was torn down. It was reconstructed along with a reconstructed Satellite Record Shop and is the only museum in the United States to be devoted entirely to soul music.

The basic principle is that the court in the member state of the party that gets sued has jurisdiction, while other grounds exist, which are diverse in content and scope, and are often classified in descending order of exclusivity and specificity.See for example Briggs, A., The Conflict of Laws, Oxford, OUP, 2008, 65 and Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 51. The original Brussels regulation (44/2001) is with regard to jurisdiction rules very similar to the 2007 Lugano Convention (which applies when the dispute has links to more than one party the convention), containing the same provisions with the same numbering. Numbering -and certain substantial issues- will be different when a recast version of the Regulation applies from 1 January 2015 (1215/2012). General jurisdiction The general principle of the Regulation is that individuals should only be sued in their member state of domicile. Domicile under the Regulation is not equivalent to the common law doctrine of domicile, but rather refers to a person's habitual or ordinary residence. The Regulation sets out a finite number of exceptions from this general principle. Most of these exceptions are optional and enable plaintiffs to sue in a place other than the defendant's jurisdiction without requiring them to. However others are exclusive and preclude plaintiffs from suing in a place other than that of the member state conferred with the jurisdiction. The general principle reflects the maxim Actor sequitur forum rei, or, he who acts (the plaintiff) must follow the forum (or jurisdiction) of the thing involved (the subject of the lawsuit, meaning the defendant). This rule is presented in Article 2(1) (2012 recast: Article 4(1)) of the Regulation that ‚Äòpersons domiciled in a Member State shall, whatever their nationality, be sued in the courts of that Member State‚Äô. The law leans in favour of the defendant, since it is ‚Äúmore difficult, generally speaking, to defend oneself in the courts of a foreign country than in those of another town in the country where one is domiciled‚Äù.Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/18. Furthermore, Article 2(2) of the Regulation embodies the \\"principle of equality of treatment\\"Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/19. by stating that 'persons who are not nationals of the Member State in which they are domiciled shall be governed by the rules of jurisdiction applicable to nationals of that State'. Although this is the 'general' jurisdictional rule of the Regulation, it only comes after the other articles in hierarchy and allows for many exceptions, making its general character rather relative; however, the latter is still reflected throughout the Regulation in the way how all exceptions to this rule must be interpreted strictly.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 85‚Äì86. Exclusive jurisdiction Article 22 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 24) enumerates five specific cases in which the courts of a member state have jurisdiction regardless of the domicile of the parties to the action: plaintiff or defendant. These are: * In disputes concerning the ownership of and rights in land and tendencies in land, exclusive jurisdiction is held by courts where the land is situated. * In disputes concerning the validity of the constitution, the nullity or the dissolution of legal persons or their decisions, exclusive jurisdiction is held by courts where the legal person has its seat as determined by the rules of private international law. * In disputes concerning the validity of entries in public registers, exclusive jurisdiction is held by the courts of the member state in which the register is kept. * In disputes concerning the registration or validity of patents, trade marks, designs, or other registrable rights, the courts of the member state in which the registration has been applied for or registered. * In disputes concerning the enforcement of judgments, the courts of the member state in which the judgment has been or is to be enforced.Article 22(1) to (5) of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 24). The term ‚Äúregardless of domicile‚Äù implies on the one hand that only the subject-matter of the action is relevant for jurisdiction, but not to the residence of the defendant. More specifically, the principal subject-matter of the action must fall within the scope of Article 22.Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/34. On the other hand, parties do not have the choice of forum in this situation, and consequently, when a national court is seised that does not fall under the exclusive jurisdiction, it must decline jurisdiction.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 51. This exceptional case of exclusivity is justified in various ways; ranging from the presence of special legislation which, due to its complexity, \\"should preferably be applied only by the courts of the country in which it is in force\\" to interests of \\"legal certainty\\", with the goal to \\"avoid conflicting judgments\\".Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/35-36. Sometimes however it is plainly clear why exclusive jurisdiction is needed; take for example the validity of entries in public registers. Because exclusivity is an exception in the Brussels regime, it must interpreted as being such: strictly.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 59. For example, an action with regards to the first exception of immovable property must strictlyThe exception to this strictness are the tenancies in immovable property, which constitute personal jurisdiction. This is justified in the Hacker v Euro-Relais case, because they are \\"closely bound up\\". (¬ß8) be based on a right in rem,Case C-115/88 Mario Reichert et al v Dresdner Bank, [1990], ECR 1‚Äì27, ¬ß11. which consequently means that a preventive action geared solely towards halting the nuisance coming from an immovable property does not fall under the provision's scope.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 53. And with regards to the second exception; e.g. only challenging the validity of a decision of an organ of a company under the company law applicable or under the provisions governing the functions of its organs, as laid down in its Articles of Association, can warrant exclusivity, and not for example, the manner in which power is exercised by an organ of the company.Case C-372/07 Hassett, [2008] ECR 1‚Äì7403, ¬ß26‚Äì29. Or finally, take the final exception with regards to the enforcement of judgments; only judgments can fall under the scope of the provision, and not say, preparatory steps such as freezing injunctions.Case C-261/90 Reichert v Dresdner Bank, [1992] ECR 2149, ¬ß26. Jurisdiction by appearance Article 24 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 26(1)) defines another ground for a national court to stay or decline proceedings by setting forth that a court of a Member State before which a defendant enters an appearance shall have jurisdiction. This deals with the hypothesis of a plaintiff suing the defendant in a Member State that initially does not have jurisdiction; if the defendant shows up and does not plead that the court has no jurisdiction, the court will have jurisdiction from then on.Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/38. The main rationality behind this provision is legal certainty, for it acts as an implicit choice of forum clause: the plaintiff gives his consent to the choice of new forum by initiating the procedure, while the defendant consents by appearing and not pleading lack of jurisdiction.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 60. Apart from the situation in which the defendant explicitly contests jurisdiction, Article 24 furthermore states that the rule of jurisdiction by appearance is not applicable whenever the exclusivity of the above-mentioned Article 22 comes into picture. Insurance, consumer and employment contracts The Regulation provides special rules for insurance, consumer and employment contracts which may permit the \\"weaker party\\" to these contracts ‚Äì i.e. insurance policy holders, consumers and employees ‚Äì to sue in their state of domicile.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 61. The Regulation also provides that where a defendant to such an action is domiciled outside of the EU but has a \\"branch, agency or other establishment\\" in the EU, it shall be deemed to be domiciled where the \\"branch, agency or other establishment\\" is located. The underlying rationality for dealing with this matter under the Regulation is that failure to do so ‚Äúmight not only have caused recognition and enforcement to be refused in certain cases on grounds of public policy, (...) contrary to the principle of free movement, but also (...) a general re-examination of the jurisdiction of the court of the State of origin‚Äù.Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/28. Consequently, article 35 of the Regulation defines that no judgment will be recognised contrary to these special rules for protection.This only includes the insurance and consumer contracts, but not the newly inserted category of employment contracts. The special protection these articles provide has as a main effect the broadening of the domicile of the 'stronger' party, so that the 'weaker' party, be it the consumer, employer or insured individual, has an increased range of locations for suing the first, while at the same time not allowing this broadened sense of domicile the other way around.Articles 9, 16 and 19 of the Regulation. For example, Article 16 of the Regulation defines that a consumer may bring proceedings against the other party in both the Member State in which that party is domiciled as the Member State in which the consumer is domiciled, while at the same time providing that proceedings against a consumer may only be brought in the courts in the Member State in which the consumer is domiciled. Furthermore, when a 'stronger' party has no domicile in any Member State, but merely a \\"branch, agency or other establishment\\" in one of the Member States, it will be \\"deemed to be domiciled in that Member State\\".Articles 9, 15 and 18 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Articles 11, 17 and 20). Lastly, an additional safeguard is installed by providing further mandatory rules governing an agreement that would deviate from the previously mentioned rules.Articles 13, 17 and 21 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Articles 15, 19 and 23). To be regarded as consumer contracts, several requirements must be met. First, there has to be a contract between parties, implying that there are ‚Äúreciprocal and interdependent obligations between the two parties‚Äù.Case C-27/02 Engler [2005] ECR I-481, ¬ß34. Secondly, there has to be a consumer contract, referring to the conditions set forth in Article 15(1) of the Regulation (2012 recast: 17(1)). Third, the consumer contract must be concluded with a consumer, implying that the concerning party is a ‚Äúprivate final consumer not engaged in trade or professional activities‚Äù. As this protection is an exception to the general rule, it is the person invoking the protection to prove that he is a consumer, and if there is business and personal use to his purchase, to prove that ‚Äúthe business use is only negligible‚Äù.Case C-464/01 Gruber [2005] ECR I-439, ¬ß46. The court must not only take into consideration the \\"content, nature and purpose\\" of the contract, but also the \\"objective circumstances in which it was concluded\\".Case C-464/01 Gruber [2005] ECR I-439, ¬ß47. Agreements on jurisdiction ('choice of court' or 'prorogation of jurisdiction') The Article 23 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 25) regulates the right of parties to determine (within boundaries) the court which professional parties may choose (prorogation of jurisdiction or choice of forum).Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 78. The article stipulates that unless the parties have agreed otherwise, this jurisdiction is exclusive; however, unlike the exclusivity under Article 22 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 24), a judgment denying a choice of court agreement or its conditions cannot be refused recognition.Contrary to Article 35(1) of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 45(1e)). This provision, of which the Jenard Report states that it is ‚Äúunnecessary to stress the importance (...), especially in commercial relations‚Äù, tries to strike a balance between two interests.Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/38 On the one hand, it tries to \\"cancel out the effects of clauses in contracts which might go unread\\", implying that there must be safeguards to ensure that a party actually consented to the choice of forum, and on the other hand, \\"excessive formality which is incompatible with commercial practice\\" should be avoided, stressing the importance of not sacrificing too much of the swiftness of commercial practice. Keeping this in mind, there must be a \\"true agreement\\" between the parties in every manner of drafting the choice of forum clause, while at the same time, the court cannot \\"necessarily deduce from a document in writing\\" that there was in fact an oral agreement. As stated in the Colzani case, \\"the validity of the clauses conferring jurisdiction must be strictly construed\\" to ensure that \\"the consensus between the parties is in fact established\\".Case 24/76 Colzani, [1976] ECR (1832) 1835, ¬ß7. The article provides three different methods of reaching a choice of forum agreement, which can be both formal and less formal, consistent with commercial practice.Article 23(1) a-c of the Regulation (2012 recast: 25(1) a-c).Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 81. The first route to reach a choice of forum agreement, is through ‚Äòwriting or evidenced in writing‚Äô; consistent with the above-mentioned purpose however, the mere fact that for instance a clause conferring jurisdiction is printed among the general conditions on the reverse of the contract, is not sufficient on its own, since ‚Äúno guarantee is thereby given that the other party has really consented‚Äù.Case 24/76 Colzani, [1976] ECR (1832) 1835, ¬ß9. Second, one can reach a choice of forum agreement 'in a form which accords with practices which the parties have established between themselves'; in this situation, an oral agreement can for example be sufficient, if it \\"forms part of a continuing trading relationship\\" and that \\"the dealings taken as a whole are governed by the general conditions of the party giving the confirmation\\".Case 25/76 Segoura, [1976] ECR 1851; ¬ß11. Indeed, in that scenario, it would be \\"contrary to good faith\\" for the recipient of the confirmation to deny the existence of a jurisdiction conferred by consent, \\"even if he had given no acceptance in writing\\". The third way to prorogate jurisdiction is, in the hypothesis of international trade or commerce, through a 'form which accords with a usage of which parties are or ought to have been aware and which in such a trade or commerce is widely known'. Establishing whether or not a 'true agreement' has been reached between parties remains a factual question which has to be decided by the national courts; consequently, it is up to the Member States to decide how to address the substantive validity of choice of forum agreements, making the same agreement possibly valid in one country and invalid in another.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 83. Even when a clear choice of court agreement is in place (and thus only that court would have exclusive jurisdiction), that court must stay its proceedings if another court within the Brussels regime was seized earlier until that court has determined that it has no jurisdiction according to the lis pendens doctrine. The new Article 31(2) in the 2012 recast regulation allows courts to take jurisdiction in such cases even if it is not the court first seized. This clause is consistent with the 2005 Hague Choice of Court Agreements convention, which the Union has signed, and for which the approval regulation is currently evaluated by the European Parliament. Special jurisdiction The Articles 5 to 7 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Articles 7- 9) constitute a ‚Äúsupplement‚Äù to the general jurisdictional rule as laid down in Article 2 of the Regulation.Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/22. They provide the plaintiff with an extra option to sue the defendant in another Member State than that of his domicile. The justification for this broadening of the general jurisdictional rule, and at the same time the necessary condition for it, is the existence of a \\"close connecting factor between the dispute and the court with jurisdiction to resolve it\\", or simply a \\"close link\\".Case C-386/05 Color Drack, [2007] ECR I-3699, ¬ß22. Article 5 (2012 recast: Article 7) of the Regulation deals with several categories of special jurisdiction, of which the most common are probably torts and contracts. Article 5(1)a (2012 recast: Article 7(1)a) of the Regulation states that the plaintiff may sue the defendant, domiciled in another Member State, ‚Äòin matters relating to a contract, in the courts for the place of performance of the obligation in question‚Äô. This provision is slightly problematic on a theoretical level in two ways. First, ‚Äòmatters relating to a contract‚Äò lacks, although the European Court of Justice (ECJ) considers it as an \\"independent\\" and thus 'European' concept,Case 34/82 Martin Peters, [1983] ECR 987, ¬ß¬ß9‚Äì10. a clear or uniform definition. The only thing present are definitions given in ECJ case-law that are rather abstract, consequently leaving parties in unclear cases to wait until the ECJ decides the matter.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 87. Second, 'the place of performance' lacks an independent European concept as well.See Case 12/76 Tessili, [1976] ECR 1473, ¬ß14. However, unlike 'matters relating to a contract', the Regulation does contain a harmonisation of 'the place of performance' for two categories of (common) contracts in Article 5(1)b of the Regulation: sale of goods and the provision of services. However, Article 5(1)c (2012 recast: Article 7(1)c) of the Regulation defines that if the conditions for Article 5(1)b (2012 recast: Article 7(1)b) are not fulfilled,This is when there is no sale or provision of services, or if the parties have agreed otherwise, or when the sale or provision of services is situated outside of any Member State. the standard provision of Article 5(1)a is applicable again, making the national law for defining ‚Äòthe place for performance‚Äô, in the absence of a uniform concept, take over.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 91. Article 5(3) of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 7(2)) gives the plaintiff, in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict, the option to sue the defendant in the courts for the place where the ‚Äòharmful event occurred or may occur‚Äô, in other words, the forum delicti commissi.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 92. In the Bier or Mines de Potasse case, the ECJ specified that the expression ‚Äòplace where the harmful event occurred‚Äò can encompass both ‚Äúthe place where the damage occurred and the place of the event giving rise to it‚Äù.Case 21/76 Mines de Potasse d‚ÄôAlsace, [1976] ECR 1735, summary. Although this specification can be very helpful to the case, its implications, such as the possibility of a multitude of fora, have led to a rather extensive case-law governing the subject, making this provision a complex matter.See for example the Dumez France case, the Marinari case, the Shevill case and the eDate advertising case. Article 6 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 8) provides a legal basis for the plaintiff of a multipartite case or case with consolidated claims to sue defendants in another Member State than their domicile, for example where the original claim is pending in case of a counter-claim or in any Member State a group of defendants whose claims are closely connected.See Article 6(1) and 6(3) of the Regulation. The rationality behind this is to ‚Äúobviate the handing down in the Contracting States of judgments which are irreconcilable with one another‚Äù.Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/27. Residual jurisdiction Article 4 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 6) provides the rule of residual jurisdiction;Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 104. it allows the plaintiff to sue the defendant, who is not domiciled in any Member State, under the national jurisdictional rules of the Member State in which the plaintiff himself is domiciled, without affecting the application of the Articles 22 and 23 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Articles 24 and 25). This residual jurisdictional rule is justified on two grounds; first, to ‚Äúensure the free movement of judgments‚Äù, and second, to ‚Äúperform a function in the case of lis pendens‚Äù (infra).Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/20. Lis pendens and related actions Chapter II, Section 9 of the Regulation deals with the hypothesis of lis pendens and related actions. The common objective and background rationality of all these articles is to \\"avoid the risk of conflicting judgments and thus to facilitate the proper administration of justice in the Community\\" by preventing that the same or related actions be decided upon by courts in different Member States.Case C-406/92 The Tatry, [1994] ECR I-5439, ¬ß31. For the purposes of the articles under this section, Article 30 (2012 recast: Article 32(1)) defines what it constitutes for a court to be ‚Äòseised‚Äô. First, Article 27 (2012 recast: Article 29) of the Regulation contains the lis alibi pendens rule: proceedings involving the same cause and between the same parties brought in the courts of different Member States must be stayed until the jurisdiction of the court first seised has been established, after which it must decline jurisdiction.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 106. Second, Article 28 (2012 recast: Article 30) of the Regulation functions as a sort of ‚Äòsafety-net‚Äò for actions which do not meet the above-mentioned requirements, but where the actions are nonetheless ‚Äòrelated‚Äô: ‚Äúthey are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings‚Äù.Article 28(3) of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 30(3)). As a consequence, Article 28(2) of the Regulation defines that any court other than the court first seised may, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction in favour of the first court for actions pending at first instance. Fitting in the general objective of avoiding conflicting judgments and facilitating proper administration, ‚Äòrelated actions‚Äò must be interpreted broadly; therefore, all cases that carry a risk of conflicting judgments, even if the judgments can be separately enforced and have no mutually exclusive legal consequences, can be considered related cases for the purposes of this article.Case C 144/86 Gubisch Maschinenfabrik, [1987] ECR 4861, ¬ß51. Finally, Article 29 (2012 recast: Article 31(1)) of the Regulation states that when actions fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of more than one court, any other court than the first seised must decline jurisdiction in favour of that court. This can for example happen under the ancillary rule regarding holiday housing in Article 22(1) of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 24(1)) that gives both the Member State in which the holiday house is situated jurisdiction as the Member State in which the defendant is domiciled. Provisional, including protective, measures Finally, Article 31 of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 35) states that courts of one Member State may give provisional, including protective, measures although courts in another Member State have jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter. This is an expression of the fact that the jurisdictional rules of the Brussels I Regulation do not regulate provisional measures;Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 112. consequently, the competent court of any Member State may give such measures ‚Äúwithout regard to the rules of jurisdiction laid down in the Convention‚Äù.Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/42. However, importantly, the measures given must be provisional only: they must be ‚Äúintended to preserve a factual or legal situation so as to safeguard rights the recognition of which is sought elsewhere from the court having jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter‚Äù.Case C-115/88 Mario Reichert et al v Dresdner Bank, [1990], ECR 1‚Äì27, ¬ß34.

The raid on Cartagena was the successful counter-attack against vessels sent to defend the city of Cartagena de Indias (modern-day Colombia) and the subsequent blockade of the city by Laurens de Graaf and his pirate compatriots. Precursors In May 1683, de Graaf had successfully attacked Veracruz with the assistance of Nicholas van Hoorn. The two subsequently had a falling out and de Graaf wounded van Hoorn on the Isla de Sacrificios.The Buccaneer's Realm: Pirate Life on the Spanish Main, 1674-1688 by Benerson Little (Potomac Books, 2007) Van Hoorn later died when the wound became infected.

Marley (ABC-CLIO, 1998) 800 Spanish, led by a 26-year-old commander, set out to meet the pirates on Christmas Eve but immediately struggled against De Graaf's more experienced men. 90 Spaniards were killed compared to only 20 pirates. The San Francisco was grounded and the other two ships were captured. De Graaf re-floated the San Francisco as his new flagship and renamed it the Fortune, later the Neptune. Michiel Andrieszoon took the Paz and renamed it the Mutine (\\"Rascal\\") and Yankey Willems was given command of the Francesca.Pirates of the Americas, Volume 1 by David F. Marley (ABC- CLIO, 2010) The group released a large number of Spanish prisoners on Christmas Day and sent them ashore with a note for Governor Estrada thanking him for the Christmas presents. The pirates then proceeded to blockade the town and ransom their remaining hostages. Relief In January 1684 an English convoy, led by the 48-gun HMS Ruby, arrived carrying a note for de Graaf from his wife offering a Spanish pardon and letter of marque. De Graaf ignored the note, not trusting the Spanish to keep their promises, and instead invited English officers to board his vessels and trade with his men. The English were then allowed to continue to Cartagena's port without incident and soon after, de Graaf and his compatriots left for Petit-Go√¢ve.

In the years leading up to 1789, the territory today known as Belgium was divided into two states, called the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge, both of which were part of the Holy Roman Empire. The area was captured by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars and incorporated into the French First Republic from roughly 1794 to 1815. In the aftermath of Napoleon's final defeat in 1815, the Congress of Vienna added the territory of Belgium to the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. In 1830, with the Belgian Revolution the Belgian provinces declared their independence, but only finally gained it in 1839. From 1885 the creation of a personal colony by Leopold II, the Congo Free State caused an international outcry over human rights abuses, and forced the Belgian state to annex the region in 1908, forming the Belgian Congo. In 1909, after his uncle's death, Albert I began his reign, which lasted until 1934. Despite declaring neutrality, Belgium was invaded by the German Empire in August 1914, beginning the country's involvement in World War I. The \\"long 19th century\\" saw profound cultural and economic changes in Belgium. The Industrial Revolution, which began to take effect in Belgium during the period of French rule, transformed the region's economy over the course of the period. By 1914, Belgium was acknowledged as one of the most densely industrialized countries in Europe, with notable coal mining and manufacturing industries. At the start of the period, French was the dominant language, and was the only one approved for use in legal and government business, however Belgium become officially bilingual in 1870 and Dutch was officially recognized as an equal language to French in legal matters in 1898. General aspects =Geography and demographics= Map of Belgium in the 1850s The territory of Belgium varied little over the period. Belgium's border with the Netherlands was almost the same as that which had been created after the Dutch Revolt in the early 17th century, and its western border was almost the same as those of the 18th- century polities the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. It was only after the French annexation of 1795 that the territory became a single entity. In the 1830s, Belgian revolutionaries sought to create an independent state within the borders of the nine provinces that had been established under French occupation while ending the traditional roles of the small duchies, princedoms and counties which had traditionally been the basic territorial units. Aside from Zeelandic Flanders, part of Luxembourg, and Northern Limburg, which were ceded to the Dutch to compensate for the loss of the rest of the territory, the outline of Belgium in 1914 was virtually identical to that established by the French in 1795. The three ceded territories had a total of 300,000 inhabitants at the time. Market day in the Campine (1910) by Frans Van Leemputten depicts rural life in the Belgian Kempen region The northern half of Belgium, which would come to be known as Flanders, was a largely agricultural area containing the important port of Antwerp, the city of Ghent and the capital, Brussels. In the southern half, which would come to be known as Wallonia, a number of smaller towns and cities along the valley of the Sambre and Meuse rivers ‚Äì the sillon industriel (\\"industrial valley\\") ‚Äì became the focus of industrialization. In the west of the valley, around Charleroi, was the Pays Noir (\\"Black Country\\"), which held significant coal deposits. In southeast Belgium, along the border with Luxembourg and Prussia (later Germany), was the heavily forested and agricultural region known as the Ardennes. In 1784, Belgium's population was 2.6 million, with just 25 percent living in cities. During the 19th century, the population both expanded and urbanized. Between 1830 and 1875 the population of Brussels grew from 100,000 to 180,000, and by 1910 the population of the metropolitan area soared to 750,000. The population of Belgium was almost universally Roman Catholic, though free-thinking movements like Freemasonry were also popular among intellectuals and the urban middle classes. Throughout the \\"long 19th century,\\" as a common destination for political refugees, Belgium was home to important √©migr√© communities, particularly in Brussels. From 1871, many of the Paris Communards fled to Brussels, where they received political asylum. The far-right politician General Georges Boulanger arrived in 1889. Other notable exiles living in Belgium included the writer Victor Hugo and the theorist Karl Marx. =Language= Belgian holidaymakers at Ostend in Flanders, 1895 While in control of Belgium, France and the Netherlands each tried to force assimilation of their national languages, but in neither case did their rule last long enough for the language to become fully entrenched across the region or for local dialects to be displaced. In 1846, 57 percent of Belgians spoke dialects of Dutch or Flemish as their primary language while 42 percent spoke dialects of French, such as Walloon, Picard or Gaumais. Under one percent of the population spoke German. Across the country, the aristocracy and middle classes spoke French, often as a second language, and French was the language of the legal system and government. There was a huge variation in accents, spelling and grammar across the country, particularly in Flanders, where regional dialects were almost incomprehensible to those from other regions. In Brussels, situated in a predominantly Dutch-speaking area, 38 percent spoke French in 1842 while 61 percent spoke Dutch; many residents spoke dialects such as Marols instead of the standard languages. By the end of the period, social change and internal immigration from Wallonia contributed to the growing importance of French in Brussels. Periods =Austrian rule and the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge= Map of the region of modern-day Belgium at the start of the period. The Austrian Netherlands was not contiguous and was bisected by the independent Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge In 1789, the area of modern-day Belgium was divided into two independently-governed polities, both part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Austrian Netherlands, which included most of the territory of modern-day Belgium, had been in existence since the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714 when the Habsburg Monarchy annexed the section called the Spanish Netherlands from the Spanish branch of the house. The traditional principalities, duchies and counties surviving from the Middle Ages retained great regional autonomy. The economy of the Austrian Netherlands developed little, as its neighboring states imposed high export tariffs and the port of Antwerp remained blocked by the Dutch. Although Enlightenment ideals developed among the urban bourgeoisie, most of the population remained suspicious of education and extremely politically conservative. The Catholic church was particularly influential, despite the attempts of Emperor Joseph II to reduce its power. The Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge was a small ecclesiastical state that had been in existence since the 10th century. It was ruled by a line of prince-bishops. By the 1780s the state's capital, Li√®ge, was the largest city in Belgium. The prince-bishopric was not a single continuous country, but rather consisted of several islands of territory surrounded by the Austrian Netherlands. One of the foremost industrial regions of the time, the prince-bishopric was known for its successful wool, armaments and coal-mining industries, and traded widely. The state was notionally governed by agreement of the Three Estates (the clergy, the nobility, and commoners), but from 1684, officials were elected by 16 separate chambers, each composed of wealthy nobles and guild members elected for life. Many groups were unrepresented, including the bourgeoisie, industrialists and lower clergy. The spread of the Enlightenment, which became popular in Li√®ge in the 18th century, bred further discontent with the political system. Revolutions of 1789 Brabant revolutionaries mass in the town of Ghent in November 1789. On 18 August 1789, just months after the start of the French Revolution, a revolution broke out in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. In a meeting at the town hall, the democrat Jean-Nicolas Bassenge called for the reinstatement of two popular mayors who had been dismissed by the prince-bishop. The revolutionaries forced their way into the city's citadel and forced Prince-Bishop Constantin-Fran√ßois de Hoensbroeck to ratify the appointments. The prince-bishop acquiesced but fled the principality for Trier a few days later. With the prince-bishop gone, the revolutionaries declared Li√®ge a republic. Just twenty days after the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen had been approved in France, a nearly identical document was introduced in Li√®ge declaring all citizens equal before the law and proclaiming freedom of thought and expression. Despite the revolutionaries pleading their case, the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire condemned the revolution and ordered the restoration of the old regime. The army of Li√®ge was finally defeated by the Austrians, who re-occupied the city in January 1791. The Prince-Bishop was reinstated. In the Austrian Netherlands, a populist revolt called the Brabant Revolution broke out in 1789 as a result of the perceived injustices of the Austrian regime. Emperor Joseph II's liberal reforms particularly angered Catholics, who feared a further decline in church influence, while for some his policies had not been sufficiently radical or liberal. Fighting began in October 1789 as an √©migr√© patriot army in the neighboring Dutch Republic invaded the country and defeated the Austrians at Turnhout. The √©migr√© army succeeded in pushing the Austrian forces out of all the territory except Luxembourg. A loose confederation of states in the region was formed as the United Belgian States. The use of the word \\"Belgium\\" in 1789 was the first time that the term had been officially employed to denote the region since Roman times. The revolution was conservative in character, not seeking to create a radically different social or religious order. Once established, the revolutionaries divided into political factions. The liberal Vonckists, led by Jan Frans Vonck, were eventually denounced and forced into exile by their conservative rivals, the Statists, led by Henri Van der Noot. The Brabant revolutionaries were finally defeated by Holy Roman forces, who occupied Brussels in December 1790. Following the crushing of the two revolutions, a number of Brabant and Li√®ge revolutionaries regrouped in Paris, where they formed the joint Committee of United Belgians and Li√©geois (Comit√© des belges et li√©geois unis), which united revolutionaries from both territories for the first time. Three Belgian corps and a Li√®ge Legion were levied to continue the fight for the French against the Austrians. =French rule= Battle of Fleurus in 1794 pushed the Austrians out of the territory for the last time. In the aftermath of the execution of King Louis XVI, revolutionary France was attacked by Prussian and Holy Roman forces from the Austrian Netherlands. Though the French defeated the Austrian army in the Battle of Jemappes in 1792 and briefly occupied the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge, they were pushed out by an Austrian counterattack in the Battle of Neerwinden the following year. In June 1794, French revolutionary troops expelled Holy Roman forces from the region for the last time after the Battle of Fleurus. The French government voted to formally annex the territory in October 1795 and it was split into nine provincial d√©partements within France. French rule in the region was marked by the rapid implementation and extension of numerous reforms which had been passed in post-Revolution France since 1789. Administration was organized under the French model, with meritocratic selection. Legal equality and state secularism were also introduced. Napoleon attends the launch of the warship Friedland in Antwerp in 1810 The important University of Louvain was dissolved and re-founded without its religious status. In Li√®ge, Jacobin-inspired locals pulled down the medieval St. Lambert's Cathedral. Use of the French language was actively encouraged and publications in Dutch banned as the government tried to integrate the territory into France, leaving a lasting legacy. Contingents of Belgian revolutionaries had served in the French army since 1792, but after the occupation, compulsory military conscription was extended to Belgians, 160,000 of whom were forced into the French army by 1813. The policy was extremely unpopular, and an insurrection known as the Peasants' War broke out in East Flanders and the Ardennes in 1798 in response. The revolt, which spread rapidly, was quickly and violently suppressed by the French. Under Napoleon, the Code Napoleon, which would form the basis of all future Belgian legal codes, was implemented. The period of French rule coincided with the start of the Industrial Revolution in Belgium. Use of mechanical production techniques was encouraged by the French state. The government particularly encouraged industrialization of Belgian industries of military use, such as the cannon foundries at Li√®ge. As the course of the Napoleonic Wars turned, the territory was invaded by Russian and Prussian forces. After Napoleon's defeat and exile in 1814, the Southern Netherlands were occupied jointly by the Austrians, Prussians and Dutch. In an attempt to strengthen their position in Belgium, the Austrians began to recruit a Belgian Legion of infantry, cavalry and artillery, which was merged with the Dutch army. The Hundred Days' Campaign, launched by Napoleon after his escape from exile, was largely fought in Belgium in early 1815, and Napoleon's final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo occurred just miles from Brussels. =Dutch rule= After Napoleon's total defeat in 1815, the Congress of Vienna merged the French territory in Belgium with the Netherlands to form the United Kingdom of the Netherlands as a buffer state against the French. It was ruled by William I of Orange. The synergy of combining the manufacturing centers in Belgium with the important exporting ports in the Netherlands encouraged growth of the industrial cloth manufacturing and metallurgic centers in Wallonia. Keen to promote the economic development of the southern provinces as well, William I founded the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale des Pays-Bas in 1822 to provide businesses with capital to invest in machinery. The Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale served as a driving force behind Belgian industrialization in the 19th century, and at its height controlled large swathes of the national economy. William I also encouraged the creation of educational facilities in the Southern Provinces, founding the State University of Leuven, the University of Li√®ge and Ghent University in 1817. The period of Dutch rule saw growing hostility between the Catholic Belgian provinces and the predominantly Protestant Dutch. The Belgian provinces also complained that they were underrepresented by the Kingdom's system of government, where 55 Belgian deputies were allocated to represent 3.5 million people, while an equal number of Dutch deputies represented just two million. When the States-General voted against adopting the new unrepresentative constitution, William declared that the minority favorable vote outweighed the negative vote. Liberals in Belgium also accused William of attacking personal and religious freedoms. =Belgian Revolution= Parc de Bruxelles in 1830 The Belgian Revolution broke out on 25 August 1830, after the performance of a nationalist opera (La muette de Portici) in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, who sang patriotic songs and captured some public buildings in the city. This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers. The following day, the revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789. To maintain order, several bourgeois militia groups were formed. The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country. William I rejected his son's advice to negotiate with the rebels, forcing them towards a more radical, pro-independence stance, and sent a large military force to Brussels suppress the insurrection. Between 23 and 27 September 1830, heavy fighting took place between Dutch forces and Brussels revolutionaries, who were reinforced by small contingents from across the country. The Dutch were eventually forced to retreat. In the aftermath of the failed attack and concurrent mass desertions of Belgian soldiers from the Dutch army, the revolution spread around Belgium. Dutch garrisons were pushed out of the area, until only Antwerp and Luxembourg remained occupied. The Provisional Government of Belgium, led by Charles Rogier, was formed on 24 September and Belgian independence was officially proclaimed on 4 October while work began on creating a constitution. In December, international governments at the Conference of London recognized the independence of Belgium and guaranteed its neutrality. The Dutch, however, only recognized Belgium's independence and the terms of the Conference in 1839 and the Dutch-Belgian frontier was only fixed by the 1843 Treaty of Maastricht. Creation of the Belgian Constitution Belgian lion on a coin In November 1830, a National Congress was established to create a Belgian constitution. Fears of mob rule associated with republicanism after the French Revolution of 1789, as well as the example of the recent July Revolution in France, led the Congress to decide that Belgium would be a popular, constitutional monarchy. The Congress approached several candidates, but chose Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a minor but well-connected German noble, to be the first King of the Belgians. He was officially inaugurated on 21 July 1831, after taking an oath to abide by the Constitution. Leopold I was generally unsatisfied with the amount of power allocated to the monarch, and sought to extend it wherever the Constitution was ambiguous or unclear while generally avoiding involvement in routine politics. The Constitution developed by the National Congress was implemented in July 1831. It guaranteed individual liberty, property rights, freedom of religion and the press, and equality before the law. Because of its perceived balance between freedom and rule of law, it was praised by liberals around the world and promoted as a model for future constitutions. Under the new constitution, Belgium had two chambers, a Chamber of Representatives and Senate, both elected by a small number of wealthy citizens. The King was allowed substantial power in military affairs, but was given little independent power in any other sphere, which was instead given to the elected chambers. =Reign of Leopold I= first Belgian postage stamp, issued in 1849 Leopold I was crowned on 21 July 1831, replacing Baron Surlet de Chokier, who had served as regent since February. Before his selection by the National Congress, Leopold had been Duke of the minor German state of Saxe- Coburg and Gotha. He had pursued a distinguished military career fighting for the Russian Empire during the Napoleonic Wars and was well connected to other European monarchies. Despite the Congress of London's verdict in 1830, the Dutch continued to resist Belgian independence for much of Leopold I's early reign. On 2 August 1831, days after Leopold's coronation, the Dutch launched an invasion known as the Ten Days' Campaign. The 50,000-strong Dutch force crossed the border and rapidly pushed the small Belgian army back as far as Leuven. Faced with a military disaster, the Belgian government appealed to the French for support. Without international support of their own and faced with an entire French army under General √âtienne G√©rard, the Dutch withdrew on 12 August. In 1832 the French pushed the Dutch out of Antwerp, their final garrison in Belgium. Much of the city was destroyed in the fighting. Sporadic skirmishes along the border continued until 1839, when the Dutch signed the Treaty of London. The Ten Days' Campaign revealed the fragility of the Belgian position, and although the Dutch finally recognized the independence of Belgium, the Belgians were forced to give up some disputed territories, including Zeelandic Flanders and the Duchy of Limburg. Part of Luxembourg, equivalent to the modern state, remained as a semi-independent protectorate of the Dutch until 1890. Politics and the Crisis of the 1840s Opening of the first railway in Belgium in May 1835 Politics in Belgium under Leopold I were polarized between liberal and Catholic political factions, though before 1847 they collaborated in unionist governments. The liberals were opposed to the church and particularly opposed its influence in politics and society, while supporting free trade, personal liberties and secularization. The Catholics saw religious teachings as a fundamental basis for the state and society and opposed all attempts by the liberals to attack the church's official privileges. Initially, these factions existed only as informal groups with which prominent politicians were generally identified. The liberals held power over much of Leopold I's reign. An official Liberal Party was formed in 1846, although a formal Catholic Party was only established in 1869. Gradually, these political groups would also spread into Belgium's society, creating a process of social stratification known as pillarisation. Leopold, who was Protestant, tended to favor Liberals and shared their desire for reform, though he was not partisan. Leopold I's reign was marked by an economic crisis which lasted until the late 1850s. In the aftermath of the revolution, the Dutch had closed the Scheldt to Belgian shipping, making the port of Antwerp effectively useless. The Netherlands and the Dutch colonies, which had been profitable markets for Belgian manufacturers before 1830, were totally closed to Belgian goods. The years between 1845 and 1849, known as the Crisis of the 1840s, were particularly hard in Flanders where harvests failed and a third of the population became dependent on poor relief. The period has been described as the \\"worst years of Flemish history\\". The economic situation in Flanders increased the internal migration to Brussels and the industrial areas of Wallonia, which continued throughout the period. Upheaval of 1848 Fighting between revolutionaries and government troops at Risquons- Tout in 1848 By 1847, Belgium was suffering from economic destabilization as Belgian exporters faced increasing competition from new British firms. Radical parties like the Association D√©mocratique, founded in 1847 at the instigation of Karl Marx, who had briefly lived in Brussels in exile, actively agitated against the unpopular Liberal government under Charles Rogier. However, the success of the Liberals' economic reforms partially mitigated the effects of the economic downturn, which meant that Belgium was not as badly affected as its neighbors by the Revolutions of 1848. Nevertheless, in early 1848, a large number of radical publications appeared. The most serious threat of the 1848 revolutions in Belgium was posed by Belgian √©migr√© groups. Shortly after the revolution in France, Belgian migrant workers living in Paris were encouraged to return to Belgium to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic. Around 6,000 armed √©migr√©s of the Belgian Legion attempted to cross the Belgian frontier. The first group, travelling by train, was stopped and quickly disarmed at Qui√©vrain on 26 March 1848. The second group crossed the border on 29 March and headed for Brussels. They were confronted by Belgian troops at the hamlet of Risquons-Tout and, during fighting, seven √©migr√©s were killed and most of the rest were captured. The defeat at Risquons-Tout effectively ended the revolutionary threat to Belgium. The situation stabilized that summer after a good harvest, and fresh elections returned a strong Liberal majority. =Reign of Leopold II= Leopold II, depicted on a coin Leopold II was sworn in as king of the Belgians in 1865. His reign coincided with the Belle √âpoque and rapid economic expansion from the 1880s. It was characterized by the resurgence of the Catholic Party, political confrontation over military action, educational and franchise reform and his creation of a personal empire in Central Africa. One of Leopold's long-term preoccupations was increasing the international standing and influence of his country. Throughout much of his early reign, Leopold hoped to regain the territories which had been ceded to the Netherlands in 1839, particularly Luxembourg, which he viewed as an integral piece of Belgian territory. He also pushed for the implementation of conscription and reforms to the military, many of which would only be realized after his death. From the 1870s, he tried to persuade several Belgian prime ministers to support the creation of an overseas colony in the Far East or Africa to increase Belgian wealth and political influence. After being repeatedly turned down, he launched a personal venture to colonize the Congo river basin in central Africa, without the backing or support of the Belgian state. Some of the vast personal wealth he accumulated from the colony was spent on construction of grandiose public buildings across Belgium, earning him the nickname \\"Builder King\\" (roi batisseur). Cinquantenaire park and arch, started under Leopold II in 1880. It was only finished in 1905. Most of these projects were focused in Brussels, where he constructed two large palaces, and Ostende, where a vast colonnaded arcade was built along the seafront in an attempt to turn the town into a fashionable seaside resort. During Leopold's reign, Belgium hosted five prestigious World Exhibitions, in 1885, 1888, 1894, 1897 and 1905, as well as a major national exhibition in 1880 to mark the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence. Politically, Leopold disliked the Socialist party, preferring to negotiate with the Catholic Party, which held power for much of his reign. He was widely distrusted by politicians, who saw him as meddling in state business and seeking to expand the power of the monarchy. Towards the end of his reign, public awareness of the atrocities committed under his colonial regime, as well as his marital infidelity, led to a significant fall the monarchy's popularity. Following his death in December 1909, his funeral cortege was booed. Although Belgium was officially neutral throughout his reign, significant numbers of Belgians volunteered to fight for right-wing causes abroad. From 1860, large numbers of Belgian Catholic volunteers went to Italy in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to defend the independence of the Papal States against Giuseppe Garibaldi's revolutionaries. The Zouaves, as they were known, were ultimately unsuccessful and the Papal States fell in 1870. A volunteer Belgian Legion fought alongside French forces in the Mexican Adventure from 1864 on behalf of Mexican Emperor Maximilian I, whose wife was the daughter of Leopold I. The unit suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of Tac√°mbaro in 1865, and after heavy fighting was disbanded in December 1866. \\"Belgian Question\\" and Franco-Prussian War French and Belgian troops stand off at the border during the Franco-Prussian War When the Franco- Prussian War broke out in July 1870, Belgium was confronted with the greatest threat to its independence since 1848. Shortly before the conflict, a draft treaty from the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 between Napoleon III and German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck discussing the annexation of Belgium as the price for French neutrality was made public. Napoleon III had also attempted to annex Luxembourg into the French Empire in 1868, which seemed to contemporaries a parallel of Belgium. European powers worried that French encroachment into Belgium would destabilize the Concert of Europe. The issue became known as the \\"Belgian Question\\". As the conflict began, Leopold and his advisors believed that either France or Prussia might try to outflank their opponent by disregarding Belgian neutrality and launching an invasion. The Belgian army was mobilized on the same day that both French and Prussian reserves were called up. As French troops moved towards the border, panic ensued in Belgium. The national gold reserves were evacuated to the National Redoubt fortress at Antwerp. After a restatement of the British guarantee of Belgian neutrality by Prime Minister Gladstone, Belgium was able to remain neutral, though much of the fighting (including the pivotal battle of Sedan) occurred just south of the Belgian border. More crucially, the mobilization of the Belgian army, which was divided into a mobile Army of Observation to guard the frontier and the static Army of Antwerp to hold the National Redoubt, revealed key structural problems in the military, particularly with the system of conscription. Events also re-emphasized the importance of the Treaty of London to Belgium's survival. Military reform Leopold viewed a strong military as the key to maintaining Belgian independence against France and, after the Franco-Prussian War, an expansionist Germany. After cutting the defense budget in the 1860s, the government was advised by a military commission to increase the size of the army and to abolish the system of Remplacement, whereby rich Belgians selected for military service by lot could pay for a substitute to take their place. Leopold II personally lobbied successive governments to implement the findings of the report and institute a fundamental reform of the army. Reform was opposed by both the Liberal and Catholic Parties, which viewed the army with suspicion and Remplacement as a key civil right. In a move supported only by the socialists, Remplacement was abolished in 1909. This was the last legal document signed before Leopold's death. Under the new system, one son per family would be liable for military service regardless of social class but the total size of the military remained the same. Although military reform was delayed until the end of his reign, Leopold did succeed in convincing parliament of the need to extend Belgium's defenses. Construction of fortresses along the border by both the French and Germans in the mid-1880s worried the Belgian government that their country might be used as an invasion route. In 1887, a program of fortification construction began along the Sambre and Meuse rivers. Designed by the leading military architect Henri Alexis Brialmont, nine forts were built at Namur to guard against an offensive from France, while twelve were built around Li√®ge, near the German border. Completed in 1892, they supplemented the existing National Redoubt at Antwerp, which was later modernized and extended. The fortifications would play a major role in the opening stages of the First World War. School War The pro-Liberal magazine La Bombe depicts a priest watching children flock to secular schools. The political rivalry between Liberal and Catholic parties peaked between 1879 and 1884, when they clashed on the issue of religion in primary education. In June 1879, a Liberal majority government under Walth√®re Fr√®re-Orban succeeded in passing an Education Act secularizing primary education across the country, starting the so-called First School War. New \\"neutral\\" schools funded by the local communes with assistance from national government were to be established in all municipalities, while Catholic schools were to receive no support at all. Outraged at the perceived challenge to its authority, the Catholic church encouraged a boycott of the schools. Though 3,885 secular schools opened across the country by 1883, attendance in private Catholic schools rose from 13 percent to over 60 percent of eligible students. After elections in 1884, a Catholic government under Jules Malou passed a new Education Law providing public financial support for religious schools. Religious education became compulsory in all schools in 1895. The Catholic Party's triumph in the issue was another blow to the already-weakened Liberal Party, and ushered in a period of almost unbroken Catholic government until World War II. Colonialism Even before his accession to the throne in 1865, Leopold began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand Belgian prestige. Politically, however, colonization was extremely unpopular, as it was perceived as a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit to the country and his many attempts were rejected: Walth√®re Fr√®re-Orban, liberal prime minister from 1878‚Äì84, wrote that: Map of the Congo Free State in 1892 Determined to look for a colony for himself and inspired by recent reports from central Africa, Leopold began patronizing a number of leading explorers, including Henry Morton Stanley. Leopold established the International African Association, a charitable organization to oversee the exploration and surveying of a territory based around the Congo River, with the stated goal of bringing humanitarian assistance and civilization to the natives. In the Berlin Conference of 1884‚Äì85, European leaders officially recognized Leopold's control over the of the notionally-independent Congo Free State. Leopold, however, reneged on his humanitarian promises, and instead brutally exploited the locals and the land to gain what profit he could. Initially, the Congo Free State relied on exporting ivory to pay for its upkeep and to fund the Congo Arab war and Emin Pasha Relief Expedition in the Eastern Congo. As rubber became an important resource in the 1890s, it quickly surpassed ivory as a profitable export, which allowed the colony to become extremely profitable for the first time. Monopoly concessions to collect rubber in large areas of territory were sold to private companies, and the Force Publique, the state's private army, was used to force locals to collect it. In some cases, Congolese people who failed to meet their quota were killed or had one of their hands cut off. The system was immensely profitable, but the population of the Congo is thought to have been reduced by as many as ten million during the period that the colony was under Leopold's control. Eventually, growing scrutiny of Leopold's regime led to a popular campaign movement, centered in Britain and America, to force Leopold to renounce his ownership of the Congo. The \\"Belgian solution\\" they proposed was for Belgium to annex it in order to end the overexploitation without disrupting the delicate balance of power in colonial Africa. In 1908, as a direct result of this campaign, Belgium formally annexed the territory, creating the Belgian Congo. Rise of socialism and franchise extension At Dawn (1875) by Charles Hermans depicts 19th-century Belgium's class inequality The reign of Leopold II saw the rise of organized socialist political groups and parties, most notably among the industrial workers in Wallonia. The early socialist movement was characterized by a successful co-operative movement in Flanders. Trade unions were legalized in 1866, opening the way to organized labor politics. The International Workingmen's Association held its first conference outside Switzerland in Brussels in 1868 as Belgian socialism, under figures such as C√©sar De Paepe, expanded dramatically. The first real socialist political party in the country, the Belgian Workers' Party (POB-BWP), was founded in 1885. The small numbers of workers who were allowed to vote in general elections meant that it achieved little success via conventional political channels. In 1886, rioting and violence broke out among industrial workers in Li√®ge, then spread across Wallonia, and was only repressed by the military. Numerous politicians of the Workers' Party were arrested by the government in the subsequent backlash, but a wave of industrial legislation, including reforms to ban child labor and limit working hours, were introduced in the aftermath of the strike. The government reaction to the strikes and their bloody repression were criticized by contemporaries, including Karl Marx who wrote in The Belgian Massacres (1869) that: red banners during the huge general strike of 1893. Painting by Eug√®ne Laermans Despite making a rapid recovery, the Belgian Workers' Party was still penalized by the Belgian electoral system, which based suffrage on wealth, stopping most of the party's support base among industrial workers from voting. In August 1885, the party began its Antwerp Programme, which called for universal suffrage while confirming the party's intention to pursue its goals through parliamentary democracy rather than revolution. The culmination of this policy was the 1893 Belgian General Strike, involving some 250,000 workers. Fearing a revolution, the government adopted universal male suffrage in 1894, but only with plural voting, which allowed up to two additional votes for wealthy or educated citizens. Nevertheless, the percentage of the population eligible to vote rose from 3.9 to 37.3 percent, and in the 1894 elections the socialists won 28 of 152 seats. The Belgian Workers' Party called two further unsuccessful general strikes in 1902 and 1913 in an attempt to end the plural voting system. The new voting system increased the socialists' influence in parliament significantly, but its major beneficiaries were the Catholic Party. Partly as a result of the creation of a Catholic populist challenger, the Christian People's Party, the Catholic Party embraced the new ideology of Social Catholicism introduced following the papal Rerum novarum encyclical of 1891. This gained it considerable popular support, especially in Flanders. In 1894, the Belgian Workers' Party adopted the Charter of Quaregnon, which would form the basis of its ideology until 1979. By 1911, the party had 276,000 members, making it one of the most successful Socialist parties in Europe. As a result of lobbying by the Belgian Workers' Party, Belgium was one of the first countries in Europe to launch a comprehensive social insurance scheme, including sickness compensation (from 1894), voluntary old-age insurance (1900) and unemployment insurance (1907). The big losers from voting reform were the Liberals who lost almost all their parliamentary representation in the years between 1894 and 1900. =Reign of Albert I (to 1914)= Portrait of Albert I Albert I inherited the throne after the death of Leopold II in 1909. His rule ended with his death in 1934, encompassing the final half-decade of the long 19th century and continuing through the First World War and into the Interbellum. The period 1909 to 1913 was marked by continued economic confidence, and two World's fair were hosted in Belgium in 1910 and in 1913. In 1913, a huge general strike took place across the country at the instigation of the Belgian Workers' Party on the issue of voting rights. The system of plural voting, in force since 1893, was extremely unpopular because of its perceived unfairness, but also because the system tended to favor the Catholic Party. Although between 300,000 and 450,000 workers were involved, the strike was ultimately unsuccessful. The party voted in favor ending the strike and taking future action by parliamentary means, on 22 April 1913. The issue of military reform, which had been extremely contentious right up to the end of Leopold II's reign, continued to be important up to the outbreak of the First World War. Under the influence of pro-militarist lobbying, expansion and further reform of the army was discussed in parliament, and a new system of universal military conscription was adopted in 1913. Prelude to World War I \\"Germany Violates Belgian Neutrality.\\" Headline in Le Soir, 4 August 1914. From as early as 1904, Alfred von Schlieffen of the German General Staff began to draw up a military strategy, known as the Schlieffen Plan, which could be put into action if Germany found itself involved in a two-front war against France and Russia. The core of the plan was a rapid attack on France on the outbreak of war, forcing a quick victory in the west before the Russians had time to fully mobilize their forces. The Schlieffen Plan took advantage of the French military's concentration and fortifications along the Franco-German border by prescribing an invasion of neutral Belgium and Luxembourg. According to the plan, the German army would rapidly overwhelm the Belgian military and then move quickly through the country and then towards Paris. The general staff believed that none of the signatories would be willing to honor their commitments from the 1839 Treaty of London, which a German diplomat dismissed as a \\"scrap of paper\\". Belgian troops at the Battle of Li√®ge in August 1914 On 2 August 1914, following the events leading to the outbreak of World War I, the Germans presented an ultimatum to the Belgian government demanding permission to move German soldiers through the country. The ultimatum stated that Belgian independence would be reinstated upon German victory and that reparations would be made afterwards. Luxembourg was invaded and occupied by the Germans the same day. On 3 August, the Belgian government rejected the proposal and the German invasion began. Contrary to the Germans' expectations, Great Britain, along with the British Empire, declared war on Germany as the Treaty of London had demanded. The reorganization of the Belgian army that had begun in 1913 was only due to be completed in 1926. Consequently at the outbreak of war, the Belgian army was under-strength and largely unprepared. Albert I took personal command of the 265,000-strong Belgian army. However, they could do little against the 1.5 million-strong German invading force. Between August and October 1914, the Germans took the fortified cities of Li√®ge, Namur and Antwerp and occupied Brussels. The fortified positions proved little match for the greatly improved siege artillery available to the Germans at the time, although the greater-than- expected defence did buy some time for the French and British to react. By the end of October, the Belgian army had been forced into a small pocket along the Yser river in the far west. In a surprising victory, the Belgian army managed to halt the German advance at the Yser, paving the way for the static trench warfare that which would characterize the Western Front for the next four years. Most of Belgium, however, was occupied by Germany and would remain under German control until 1918. Themes =Industrialisation= View of mines in the Borinage region in the 1890s by Constantin Meunier Belgium was the first country in continental Europe to experience the Industrial Revolution, and was the most intensively industrialized country in the world throughout most of the period. Belgian industrialized rapidly over the 19th century, with a focus on iron, coal and textile production. By 1914, Belgium had extensive rail networks, mines and factories, and a productive export sector. The Industrial Revolution is usually considered to have been spread from Britain to Belgium by two British industrialists, William and John Cockerill, who moved to Li√®ge in 1807 and formed a company producing industrial machinery and iron. Industrial development was possible in Belgium because of large coal deposits located in the Sillon industriel along the Sambre-Meuse river valley. Although the town of Ghent, a centre of cotton production in Flanders, industrialised rapidly, the effects of the Industrial Revolution were most felt in Wallonia, particularly in the cities of Mons, Charleroi, Li√®ge and Verviers. By the 1840s, Cockerill was the world's largest manufacturer of steel. Belgium also rapidly developed a large railway system. From the outset, the Belgian state supported the construction of railways, envisaging a railway link between the industrial region of Mons and the port of Antwerp via Brussels. The first stretch of this line, one of the first railways in Europe, opened in 1835 between Brussels and Mechelen. Belgian firms initially copied and mass-produced British designs, but soon began specializing in railway materials, chemicals, weapons and raw materials. These items were all widely exported, making Belgium one of the foremost industrial powers in the world. One of the most successful exporters was √âdouard Empain, nicknamed the \\"Tramway King\\", whose company ran infrastructure projects across Europe, Asia and South America. Empain's projects included the Paris M√©tro system, completed in 1900, and the entire Egyptian suburb of Heliopolis, which was finished in 1905. =Language division= 1836 depiction of the Battle of the Golden Spurs by Nicaise de Keyser. Evoking Flemish history played a central role in the development of the Flemish Movement. As the independent state of Belgium consolidated after the Revolution, the issue of a consensus language in the country became an increasingly important political question. At the start of the period, French was the dominant language, and was the only language that was approved for use in legal and government business anywhere in the country. It was also the language of the economic and social elite, even in Flanders. By the 1860s, with Flemish dialects in decline, increasing numbers of Flemish people of all social classes were bilingual, paralleling a similar decline in northern France. However, partly inspired by a resurgence in Flemish literature and culture, the Flamingant political movement began to develop, with their first political parties formed in the 1860s and 70s. Political agitation by Flamingant groups, often directed by local priests, led to Belgium becoming officially bilingual in 1870. Teaching Dutch in all secondary schools in Flanders became compulsory, reinforcing the language's presence. By 1898, Dutch was officially recognized as an equal language to French in legal matters. During the first decades of the 20th century, the Flemish Movement became increasingly radicalized and began to develop as a mass political movement (although not a united one), fully emerging during the First World War. In the 1880s, a Walloon Movement began to emerge in parallel to the Flemish Movement. The early Walloon Movement developed in reaction to the perceived discrimination against French language as Dutch was progressively accorded equality. At the same time, the movement called on a \\"Walloon identity\\" rather than a Belgian one. In his famous Lettre au roi sur la s√©paration de la Wallonie et de la Flandre (\\"Letter to the King on the separation of Wallonia and Flanders\\") published in 1912, the Walloon socialist Jules Destr√©e argued that the language division in Belgium was irreconcilable, famously stating that \\"In Belgium, there are the Walloons and the Flemish. There are no Belgians.\\" =Literature= The 19th century saw a flourishing of Belgian literature in both French and Dutch languages. In Flanders, the Literary Romanticist movement, aided by a renewed interest in Belgium's medieval past, flourished under authors including Hendrik Conscience, who is credited as \\"father of the Flemish novel\\", and poets like Theodoor van Rijswijck. Conscience's most famous work, De Leeuw van Vlaanderen (\\"The Lion of Flanders\\", 1838), portrayed a romantic and heavily embellished account of the County of Flanders' fight against the French in the 14th century, with the Flemish victory at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302 as the centerpiece. De Leeuw van Vlaanderen became a source of inspiration for the Flemish Movement and remains one of the best examples of Flemish literature. From the 1860s, Flemish literature began to reflect the Realist style already popular in France, under writers such as Anton Bergmann and Virginie Loveling. The works feature detailed depictions of ordinary aspects of daily life and often have a pessimistic tone. Heavily influenced by Belgian dialects such as West Flemish, the poet and priest Guido Gezelle produced lyric poems in Dutch from the 1850s until his death in 1899. In 1893, the cultural magazine Van Nu en Straks (\\"Of Today and Tomorrow\\") was launched to bring Flemish literature to an audience outside Belgium. Flemish literature continued to flourish in the first decades of the 20th century under writers such as Stijn Streuvels. In Wallonia, literature in French began a revival in 1881 with the creation of the La Jeune Belgique (\\"The Young Belgium\\") movement, which supported the creation of distinctively Belgian literature and opposed romanticism. Among the members of the Jeune Belgique were the writer Camille Lemonnier, whose works were often set against the background of Belgian peasant life in the naturalist style, and the poet Charles Van Lerberghe. French language poetry flourished in Belgium in the early 20th century under √âmile Verhaeren and Maurice Maeterlinck; Maeterlinck was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1911.

It was released in 2013 exclusively for Windows Phone. The game was scheduled to be released for iOS and Android in 2014. It was originally planned to fund these versions with Kickstarter but the campaign was unsuccessful.  Gameplay  Dark Land is a Hack 'n slash infinity runner. The player has to jump over obstacles or slide under others, such as whirling blades. There are also enemies they have to fight. Players can also stop running.  Plot  The story is told through a slideshow without text. It is about a brave knight who faces evil powers that have invaded the land.  Development  Dark Lands is the third game by Mingle Games. It was preceded by Save the Birds and Dwarven Hammer. The former was a success while the latter was a failure. After Dwarven Hammer, the developers decided to stop making video games that they believed to be popular and instead to focus on games that they would play. Members of the team are all fans of fantasy and horror themes. They were influenced by works of Frank Miller (Sin City and 300). Another inspiration was Limbo with its black-silhouette graphics. To make more animations with lower memory requirements, they used skeletal animations instead of sprites. At that point, the only problem was budget. Mingle Games decided to participate in AppCampus and applied for funding from the AppCampus program, and in the end were selected. This required the game be released exclusively for Windows Phone for a period of three months. The game was developed with only core gameplay and a limited amount of bosses and enemies, and only two game worlds. The development took 6 months. The game was released in December 2013.

The film was produced by Siddharth Roy Kapur under UTV Motion Pictures. The film features Arya, Kreshna, Swati Reddy, and Deepa Sannidhi in the lead roles, while Adil Hussain, RJ Balaji, Thambi Ramaiah, and Ponvannan play supporting roles. The music was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja with cinematography by Om Prakash and editing by Sreekar Prasad. The film released on 11 September 2015 to extremely negative reviews and bombed at the box office.  Plot \\"Thoothukudi\\" Chinna (Arya) is a hooligan who is an ardent fan of Ajith Kumar and dreams to act with him one day. One day, he gets a call from Thangamani aka Sotta Mani (Thambi Ramaiah) to finish off Shwetha (Deepa Sannidhi), who can see the future after an incident when she was young. On the other hand, \\"Pazhani\\" Karthik (Krishna) wants to become an actor and loves Deepa (Swathi Reddy), who supports his idea. However, his father (Azhagam Perumal) does not want him to become one. Eventually, Chinna and Karthik swap places just by getting into the wrong car. Chinna gets to act in a movie directed by S. J. Surya, in which he had chose to introduce Karthik as a debutant. Now left with no choice, he chooses to introduce Chinna. The same happens to Karthik, who now has to do Chinna's job. Meanwhile, Shwetha comes across a politician named Vetri (Adil Hussain). She heard that rumours were going on that Vetri killed his brother Selvam (Adil Hussain). She did not suspect that was what happened until she touched his hand and realized that he actually did. One day, a few men come to attack Shwetha, but she is saved by Karthik. At that moment, a police officer (Ajay Rathnam) investigates. After realizing Shwetha's ability, Vetri kidnaps her, Karthik, and Chinna. Soon, Durai (Ponvannan) asks Vetri what is the difference between him and Selvam as he explains that Vetri is doing this just for an MLA post. Vetri says that there is no difference and reveals that he is Selvam and that it was Vetri that died. Selvam explains that he was unhappy with his popularity, and jealous of his brother's. The police officer also sided with him and covered the murder until Shwetha found out. Somehow, Chinna and Karthik fight with Selvam. They manage to defeat and then bury him. The movie ends with the two of them going back to their own ways and with Karthik having a conversation with director Vishnuvardhan about another film.

The foundations of an older barn, which was historically attached to the house, remain. Land that now makes up the farm was first occupied about 1783, when a log house was built by Joseph Parker. After passing through several owners, it was purchased by Silas Wheeler in 1806. He is credited with building the oldest portion of the farmhouse, on the site of the original log house. Lawrence Road, now fractured by unmaintained stream crossings, ran from the house to a mill Wheeler also owned. The Wheeler property was purchased in 1845 by George Lawrence. Lawrence expanded the landholdings of the farm, and also expanded the house, adding an ell to make room for his family, as well as his widowed mother and spinster sister. Lawrence was a successful farmer, and one of Troy's wealthiest residents at the time of his death. His descendants have continued to own the land, leasing the fields to local farmers.

He is the founder of The Brassica Chemoprotection Laboratory for the study of edible plants that induce protective enzyme activity in the body and may help prevent the development of cancer. Biography Paul Talalay was born to Russian Jewish parents in Berlin, Germany, but immigrated to England with his family in 1933, shortly after the Nazi Party came to power. His father Joseph was an engineer and inventor, and his mother Sophie was a homemaker. He was educated at Bedford School and, in 1940, he travelled to the United States to enter the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he majored in biology. In 1944, Talalay entered medical school at the University of Chicago and, in 1946, he transferred to Yale School of Medicine. He received his M.D. in 1948. In 1950, he received a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Fellowship and returned to the University of Chicago to begin research on steroid hormones. Between 1962 and 1974, Talalay was Director of the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. In 1974 he was appointed as John Jacob Abel Distinguished Service Professor of Pharmacology. Talalay's career was devoted to cancer research and the achievement of early protection against cell damage. A pioneer in the field of chemoprotective research strategies, Talalay and his colleagues devised simple cell culture methods for detecting phytochemicals which appear to boost enzymes that detoxify carcinogens in the body. This work led to the isolation of sulforaphane, found in broccoli, as a potent inducer of detoxifying phase two enzymes. These findings, published in 1992, attracted worldwide attention as a major breakthrough in understanding the potential link between cruciferous vegetable consumption and reduced cancer risk. Talalay was awarded one of the first lifetime professorships of the American Cancer Society. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

It follows the marital tension resulting from an avalanche during which the husband, named Tomas, prioritizes his own escape over the safety of his family. The title used for the film in some English-speaking countries comes from force majeure, a contractual clause freeing both parties from liability in the event of unexpected disasters. Force Majeure was acclaimed upon release, with critics praising its script and cinematography. It won the Best Film award at the 50th Guldbagge Awards, and was named one of the best films of 2014 by various publications. Plot A Swedish family consisting of a businessman named Tomas, his Norwegian wife Ebba, their young daughter Vera and preschooler Harry stays at a luxury resort in the French Alps. On their second day, they see a controlled avalanche as they are having lunch outdoors on the deck of a restaurant. The powder cloud of the avalanche gives the appearance that the snow is rising and will wipe out everyone on the deck. Tomas, who is filming the avalanche on his mobile phone, panics and runs as the deck quickly empties of patrons, leaving Ebba with their children encased in a dense fog. Patrons return to their tables as the fog dissipates, and no one is hurt. That evening they eat dinner with one of Ebba's friends, who has picked up an American man for the evening. Ebba tells the story of the avalanche in English, but Tomas insists he did not run away from the table, and in Swedish adds that one cannot run in ski boots. They argue in front of their embarrassed guests. Ebba is angry that he would not admit he ran away from the avalanche, abandoning them. He says he remembers it differently. Ebba decides she would like a day of skiing by herself. She has drinks with her friend they had dinner with the night before, as the woman says goodbye to another man. Ebba confronts her friend on her adultery, asking her if she loves her husband and children. Her friend says she is fine with having an open relationship with her husband, and that she is happy if he finds a woman to have great sex with, as he is with her. Ebba becomes more insistent, and the friend advises they not argue, and leaves. Mats, one of Tomas's old friends, joins them at the resort with his young girlfriend, Fanny. They join Tomas and Ebba for dinner in their suite. After dinner and much wine, Ebba again recounts the story of the avalanche, to the silent horror of Mats and Fanny. Tomas curls up with Harry to play a video game, and listens to Mats who insists that we are not ourselves in emergencies, naming the Estonia disaster as an example. Ebba says Tomas won't admit what he did. Tomas returns and again insists he has a different perspective. So Ebba fetches Tomas's phone and has the four of them watch the video of the incident. Tomas reluctantly agrees the footage showed someone running, but is silent when Mats speculates that Tomas was running away so that he could come back and dig out his family later. As Fanny and Mats leave, Fanny suggests that she would expect Mats to react in the same way as Tomas. Mats is irritated, and their relationship is changed for the rest of the trip. Tomas and Mats ride the ski lift in silence. They ski down fresh powder. Mats suggests Tomas try primal screaming, and Tomas does, screaming swear words into the Alps. Tomas later confesses to Ebba that he hates himself, his cowardice, his cheating in games with his kids, his unfaithfulness. He weeps as his children inside huddle and cry together, hearing their parents argue. On their final day, the family ascends in the ski lift silently. Ebba is concerned about the thick fog. Tomas says he will go first, then the children, then she can follow. Ebba gets lost in the fog, and Tomas briefly leaves the children alone to go rescue her, returning carrying her shortly after. He sets her down, grinning. As the family and their friends leave the resort by coach down the winding mountain road, Ebba decides the driver is incompetent and demands to be let off. Panic ensues, and Mats takes charge, insisting women and children get off first. Eventually, all exit the bus except for Ebba's friend, and the group descends the road on foot. Mats and Fanny are walking apart. Ebba asks Mats to carry Vera. A stranger offers Tomas a cigarette, and initially Tomas declines, but then accepts. Harry asks his father if he smokes ‚Äî he has not during the entire vacation ‚Äî and Tomas replies that he does.

Prior to entering film school, Ruben √ñstlund had created ski films, and wanted to use his knowledge and experience from that in a film concerned with existential issues. Ruben √ñstlund attributed the inspiration for the film's key scenes to a few viral YouTube videos which he felt corroborated the plausible situation and emotions of the characters. The director reasoned that \\"...if someone captured an event or action or pang of emotion on camera and uploaded to the Internet, then it happened in real life. And it could happen in Force Majeure.\\" The scene where Ebba demands to be let off the bus is based on the YouTube viral video titled \\"Idiot Spanish bus driver almost kills students\\". Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 94% approval rating, based on 156 reviews, with an average rating of 7.92/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Gleefully uncomfortable, Force Majeure is a relationship drama that's hard to watch ‚Äî and just as difficult to ignore.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 87 out of 100, based on 37 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Awards The film was selected to compete in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Jury Prize.

It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is oriented facing south, presenting a side gable to the street. Windows are placed irregularly, with a center entrance on the south facade. A single-story ell extends to the west, which is stylistically similar, and there is a modern garage about south of the house. The house was built about 1808 by Benjamin Learned Jr; he deeded the property to his brother Amos that year. Both of the Learneds eventually moved to Maine. The house stands near a discontinued road that went to the Upper Jaffrey Road, where their father's house also still stands.

It was created by Bad Guidance Productions. The first series aired on Vimeo but, following a relatively successful stint on the channel, was moved to YouTube where ratings began to soar. In 2013, Online Television Channel World TV One commissioned the series. First series The series began at the end of 2012 with a one off special entitled Rover Road. The show was then commissioned as a full series by Vimeo and then moved to YouTube as a result of overwhelming ratings. The first episode introduced main characters such as Glenda Battersby and Cruelette Farley. The first on-screen death that occurred on the show was that of William Daley who was killed after being hit by a car. Despite being originally written out after two episodes, the character returned as a ghost. Cruelette (Williams daughter) was aware that her favorite son Devan Farley was the one who accidentally ran over her father. The pair attempted to frame her other son (and Devans twin) D'Evon. Eventually, after spending weeks in prison, D'Evon was released and Devan convicted. He left the show in 2013. Second series In early 2014 a second series of the hit show was commissioned. It is understood that it will broadcast on YouTube and another as of yet unconfirmed Broadcaster. World TV One will not broadcast the second series due to disagreements with the shows producers over killing off major characters. It is understood that the second series will broadcast in January 2015, with a Christmas special airing on the 24th of December.

The Foster family were all set to make there on-screen debuts in December when all of a sudden the plug was pulled on the new characters.

A majority of the court held that countries joined to the European Convention on Human Rights may be required to permit minimal levels of campaign spending. The minority held that the United Kingdom's near total ban on election-related spending should be regarded as compatible with ECHR article 10. The principle in Bowman stands in contrast to the unlimited spending at elections that the US Supreme Court opened up by Buckley v Valeo, where a majority struck down parts of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, and the licence of corporations to donate money as a protected right of \\"free speech\\" in Citizens United v FEC, with or without authorisation by their stakeholders. Facts Phyllis Bowman, an anti-abortion campaigner, distributed 25,000 leaflets in Halifax before the 1992 general election on the positions of three candidates on abortion. She was prosecuted under the Representation of the People Act 1983 section 75 for the offence of spending more than ¬£5 on publications aiming to promote a candidate six weeks before an election, without authorisation. She was acquitted because the summons was issued out of time. However, Bowman contended at the European Court of Human Rights that her prosecution was an unjustifiable interference with her freedom of expression under the European Convention on Human Rights, article 10. Judgment The majority of fourteen out of twenty judges on the European Court of Human Rights held there was a violation of ECHR article 10. The Representation of the People Act 1983 section 75 was an indirect restriction freedom of expression. The restriction was prescribed by law, and pursued a legitimate aim of protecting others' rights: candidates and the electorate, by seeking to secure equality among candidates. Freedom of expression and the right to free elections were the foundation of a democratic system, but election spending could undermine equal elections. However, a ¬£5 spending limit was practically an absolute bar on distributing information to influence voters. Given the lack of restrictions on political parties, it was not a proportionate response to secure equality between the candidates. Consequences In response to this judgment, the spending limit of ¬£5 per individual was increased to ¬£500 (for Parliamentary elections) in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.

It had its premiere in Stuttgart, Germany in December 2010... It was screened and received numerous awards at international film-festivals,See list of awards and sources below. was additionally shown in various cinemas and screening events in Germany,.. and was officially released online in June 2013.. It is the first instalment of Tuschinski's informal Trilogy of Rebellion - three very different feature films connected by the same thoughts, ideas and main characters, although each tells an independent story: Menschenliebe, Timeless and an upcoming project called Revolution!. Additionally, the film Break-Up refers to some events of Menschenliebe..  Plot  The film is about a young physics-student, Arnold Richter, who loves classical music - especially Mozart's opera Don Giovanni. Being a shy introvert, he has no luck finding a girlfriend. One day, he meets a man reminiscent of Don Giovanni. His new mentor teaches him how to seduce any woman in two minutes - but the more Arnold follows his advice, the more surreal his world becomes..  Themes  = Classical Music = The protagonist of Menschenliebe, Arnold, is fond of classical music and mentions that Don Giovanni is his favorite opera and that he attended a performance the day before the film's story starts. Therefore, in Menschenliebe there are numerous references to classical music, and its score consists mostly of classical pieces. In the film's beginning, they are often orchestra- recordings, while towards the end they are often recorded on synthesizer as Arnold's world becomes more and more surrealistic.  Opera Music  Menschenliebe's soundtrack includes many pieces from operas by Mozart. The film opens with the overture to Nozze di Figaro. Tuschinski was inspired by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's film of that opera for his opening montage, and had planned to open a film that way since his early youth. The film's opening, set to the music, is also an \\"overture\\" as it already features many elements that appear later in the film: Arnold's writing, rejection-letters from girls, Konstantin kissing a woman, among other elements.Alexander Tuschinski: Audio commentary on DVD of Menschenliebe. Further into the film, when Arnold first encounters Konstantin, the opening of the aria voi che sapete from Nozze di Figaro is played. The aria deals with a young man's longing for women, which is thematically related to Arnold's and Konstantin's dialogue. While Konstantin seduces a woman in the bar to demonstrate Arnold his techniques, we hear an instrumental version of Das Klinget so Herrlich from The Magic Flute - an aria in which the opera's protagonists sing about the wonderful sound of a glockenspiel. The scene in the film is an ironic reference to the aria, as the girl in the bar is enchanted by Konstantin's words like the opera's protagonists by the glockenspiel. Towards the film's ending, its score incorporates more and more pieces from Don Giovanni, suggesting that Konstantin is Don Giovanni: When Konstantin demonstrates Arnold how to flirt successfully, the aria Deh Vieni Alla Finestra is played in an instrumental version. In the opera, Don Giovanni attempts to seduce a woman with that aria. In the film, Arnold seduces a girl with words that Konstantin tells him to use. As Konstantin later sits in the cafeteria playing the piano, he plays a menuet from Don Giovanni. He later starts singing a song set to the music of the aria Fin Ch'Han Dal Vino to invite bystanders to his party. In the opera the song is dealing with preparing Don Giovanni's big celebration. Before the party, Arnold and Konstantin joke around in Arnold's apartment and sing to the music of Gia La Mensa e Preparata, the beginning of the finale of Don Giovanni. Like Don Giovanni in the opera, Konstantin sits at a table and jokes around while eating and drinking. During the opening of Arnold's great party, an instrumental version of the aria Riposate, vezzose ragazze is played, which in the opera is also set during a big celebration.  Instrumental Music  As with Mozart's opera music, classical instrumental music - often by Beethoven - is used in the film's soundtrack, many times thematically linked to the scenes its played in: During Arnold's frustrating day in the idyllic park near a lake, the second movement of Beethoven's sixth symphony is played. That movement was labeled by Beethoven as an idyllic \\"scene by a stream\\". During Arnold's frustrating experience in the student's association, an electronic version of the Grand Fugue is played to show his emotional distress. Following the scene, as he walks through the park alone and takes brief rests, the second movement of Schubert's ninth symphony is played. The moments Arnold rests are always at the moments when the second theme of the movement plays. Right before and while Konstantin seduces the 18-year-old pupil, we hear the opening minutes of the finale of Niccol√≤ Paganini's first violin concerto. This could be seen as an ironic reference to rumors about Paganini being a womanizer. Beethoven's ninth symphony is used multiple times: As Konstantin shows Arnold how not to care about other people (by insulting and beating them), the happy march from the symphony's finale and the following chorus-section are played in an ironic way. At the end, when Arnold seduces two girls, the march is repeated. As Konstantin rewinds the film in the end to make its ending more upbeat, he is singing the first vocal part of the symphony's finale in an electronically distorted way, and the finale ends the film as the credits are rolling. =Multiple Personalities= In Menschenliebe, Konstantin is portrayed as Arnold's alter ego, which is hinted at many times in the film and is a theme addressed right in the beginning. Arnold mentions that the day before Menschenliebe's story starts, he attended a performance of Don Giovanni. In the opening of the film, while waiting for his metro, he observes a man kissing a woman: Konstantin. Starting immediately when Arnold arrives at University until Konstantin appears in person to talk to Arnold, editing foreshadows his appearance: Whenever Arnold faces a frustrating situation and remains calm on the outside, there are brief inserts of Konstantin reacting violently towards the surroundings. By editing it is suggested that Konstantin is Arnold's frustration personified. Alexander Tuschinski describes Konstantin as a \\"wild animal who doesn't adhere to social conventions and just takes what he wants - in a charming way\\". One possible interpretation could be that Arnold observes a man kissing a woman on his way to University after watching Don Giovanni the day before, and afterwards mixes the kissing person and Don Giovanni in his mind to create the image of a person he'd like to be. It could also be that the kissing man in the beginning is already Konstantin, created in Arnold's fantasy from the beginning.  Production  Source:. = Overview = The film is considered a Low-Budget- Film, as everybody involved participated without payment. The cast consists of 46 mostly first-time actors. Alexander Tuschinski produced the film parallel to and independent of studying at Hochschule der Medien, Stuttgart.. = Development = Alexander Tuschinski started writing first drafts of the screenplay in October 2009, as he was starting his studies at Hochschule der Medien. In the screenplay, he used a lot of inspiration from his everyday life as a student. The first two scenes he wrote were the dialogue between Arnold and Konstantin in the bar, and Arnold's computer science class. As Tuschinski had previously produced Killer-Squirrels, an absurdist comedy, he originally intended to follow up with a dramatic, philosophical post-apocalyptic film. Working on parallel on both screenplays, he decided that he preferred the lighter comedic tone of Menschenliebe. He wrote down the final draft of the Menschenliebe-script in the first two weeks of December 2008. Most scenes were written while listening to classical music, often those pieces that ended up being played as background music in the respective scenes. The scene in the student-society was based on one that Tuschinski had written for a (yet unproduced) screenplay about a young composer in 2007, and was re-written by him to fit Menschenliebe. Until filming started in March 2009, Tuschinski did a lot of location-scouting on the weekends and during breaks at university. He quotes O Lucky Man! as one of his key inspirations when writing Menschenliebe, as both films feature a young, almost naive protagonist who is dragged into many different situations - though their storylines are very different. = Casting = The search for the lead actor portraying the protagonist Arnold Richter was described as a great challenge by Tuschinski: The film's scenes were often absurdist and surrealist, and the main character was supposed to counter this by being \\"normal\\" and likeable in even the most outrageous scenarios. From multiple candidates, he finally chose Sebastian B. who had collaborated on multiple short videos that Tuschinski directed before Menschenliebe. The other major roles were mostly first-time actors. Some smaller parts were cast right before their respective days of filming. = Filming = Filming started in late March 2009, and the last day of filming was September 1, 2009. The first scene filmed was Arnold's sad walk through the park, and the last one Konstantin's seduction of the punk-girl. As most actors and participants were students at the time of filming, most filming was done on the weekends to accommodate their schedule. While writing, Tuschinski had already planned that very few characters would be present in all scenes, in order to make casting smaller parts easier and more spontaneous. Menschenliebe marks the first collaboration with cinematographer Matthias Kirste, who went on to do cinematography in almost all of Tuschinski's films afterwards. = Editing = Most scenes were edited by Tuschinski right the very night after filming them. For him, this working style is important, as he keeps a list of shots and possible edits in his head during filming, and prefers editing when all the shots and different takes are still fresh in his memory. Therefore, the first rough cut of the whole film was ready by October 15, 2009. For the next months, music rights were cleared. Originally, there were two original songs in the film, one explaining Arnold's online-dating experiences in a funny way. For pacing-reasons, Tuschinski removed the song after editing the first rough cut and replaced it with an experimental stream- of-consciousness montage. = Release = The private premiere for cast and crew with a preliminary edit was held at Dillmann-Gymnasium in Stuttgart in January 2010, and the official public premiere took place in December 2010. By the time the official premiere of Menschenliebe took place, Tuschinski had already started filming his next project Break-Up. In 2011 and 2012, the film was screened and awarded at numerous international festivals. In June 2013, Menschenliebe was released online.

It presents the history of the Priamar promontory and the town of Savona. On the exposition are old collections of objects from around the Mediterranean and artifacts from the 20th century excavations of the fortress and its surrounding (especially ceramic products of the region). The museum has two floors and inside it is possible to see original excavation pits. History of the museum The museum was opened on 7 April 1990. Before, the archaeological collection of Savona did not have a permanent seat, being stored in different places and mostly not exposed. The current seat of the museum came to be thanks to numerous seasons of archaeological excavations carried in the Priamar Fortress under the International Institute of Ligurian Studies (Instituto Internazionale di Studi Liguri) directed first by Nino Lamboglia, later by Carlo Varaldo and Rita Lavagna (current director of the museum). The idea of creating a permanent museum in Palazzo della Loggia was born after the temporary exhibition organized in 1979 presenting the results of so far executed excavations.Museo archeologico di Savona al Priamar, 1996, Instituto Internazionale di Studi Liguri, R.

As for institutional innovations in the local administrations since the Seven Year War of 1593 down to 1904, the 1908 Jeungbo Munheon Bigo, The Expanded Encyclopedia of the Eastern Nation, succinctly noted the redevelopment of Ulleung Island of 1883, its promotion to Uldo County of 1900, and the incorporation of Usan Island under Uldo County jurisdiction.  Geographical claims  Daehanjiji describes the domain of the Great Korean Empire as stretching from 33¬∞15‚Ä≤N to 42¬∞25‚Ä≤N and from 124¬∞30‚Ä≤E to 130¬∞35‚Ä≤E, which would exclude the Liancourt Rocks (located at 37¬∞14‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥N 131¬∞52‚Ä≤0‚Ä≥E), ownership of which is claimed by both Korea and Japan.Korea's MOFA(Â§ñ‰∫§ÈÉ®)(1977), „ÄåJapanese Memo. 2„Äç(1954. 2. 10), „ÄéDokdo Documents 1(Áç®Â≥∂Èóú‰øÇË≥áÊñôÈõÜ1)-Memoranda(ÂæÄÂæ©Â§ñ‰∫§ÊñáÊõ∏)(1952~1976) -„Äè, p. 57Shimojo Masao (‰∏ãÊ¢ùÊ≠£Áî∑)(1998. 8), „ÄåDokdo Issues„Äç, „ÄéHan'guk Nondan(ÈüìÂúãË´ñÂ£á)„Äè pp. 108, 132~152; (2007. 9), „ÄåBehold, ye historical revisionists of Japanese territory „ÄåTakeshima„Äç(Êó•Êú¨„ÅÆÈ†òÂúü„ÄåÁ´πÂ≥∂„Äç„ÅÆÊ≠∑Âè≤„ÇíÊîπÁ´Ñ„Åõ„ÅóËÄÖ„Åü„Å°„Çà)„Äç, „ÄéShokun!(Ë´∏Âêõ!)„Äè, Bungeishunj≈´-sha(ÊñáËóùÊò•ÁßãÁ§æ); \\"Takeshima(Korean„ÜçDokdo), whose is it, Korean or Japanese\\"(2004, Bungeishunj≈´- sha, p. 115)Muzuma Masanori(Ê∞¥ÈñìÊîøÊÜ≤, 2012) \\"1899 Korean textbook proving ‚ÄòNo Dokdo within Korea‚Äô found\\" („Äå1899Âπ¥Áô∫Ë°å„ÅÆÈüìÂõΩ„ÅÆÊïôÁßëÊõ∏„Å´„ÄéÁ´πÂ≥∂„ÅØÈüìÂõΩÈ†ò„Åß„Å™„ÅÑ„ÄèË®ºÊã†Áô∫Ë¶ã„ÄçJapanese news article) http://www.news-postseven.com/archives/20121015_149188.html Although Daehanjiji garnered praise as a pioneering Western-style textbook in late Joseon dynasty, it was criticized for its overt dependence on Japanese geographies. It had borrowed heavily from the Japanese sources in its overview, format, and content material, and its longitude-latitude co- ordinates were literally translated from the Japanese books rather than taking Korean measurements conducted by the Korean government.Ïú§ÏÜåÏòÅ(2013).

Both jaws and the roof of the mouth have bands of villiform teeth> It has an incomplete lateral line which has 43-47 tubed scales. There are large obvious open pores around each eye and along the upper part of head and along the jaws. The gill cover ends in a double spine. The dorsal fin contains 7 or 8 spines, spines 3 and 4 being the longest, and 16-17 soft rays, the spiny and soft-rated parts separated by a deep notch. The anal fin has 3 spines and 11-12 soft rays. The anal and caudal fins are rounded. It is normally deep olive purple to black or dark-brown but can be light-brown with a dark brown mottling when living in lighter environments. The maximum recorded standard length is , although most fish are around . Distribution The nightfish is endemic to the coastal wetlands of Southwest Australia. It is common and is found between the Hill River, near Jurien Bay and the Kalgan River near Albany. Habitat and biology The nightfish is found in coastal streams, lakes and ponds where they occur in both clear waters and in waters darkened by tannins. They prefer to be in the vicinity of the cover of rocks, macrophytes or submerged wood. It hides during the day, beneath stones or among vegetation. The adults remain hidden in the daylight hours and emerge to feed at night while the juveniles are more diurnal. Males attain sexual maturity after a year and females after two years, when the water levels rise in the winter rains in August and September they migrate upstream to headwaters and tributaries to breed. Each female can lay 230 to 1138 eggs. This is a carnivorous species which feeds on a variety benthic invertebrates, especially ostracods and fly larvae. They have a lifespan of 6 years.

Function and distribution CerS4 synthesizes ceramides containing C18-22 fatty acids in a fumonisin B1-independent manner. It is expressed at highest levels in skin, leukocytes, heart and liver, although at much lower levels than other ceramide synthases.  Tissue and cellular distribution  CerS4 (TRH1) mRNA was found in all tissues and is strongly expressed in skin and muscle Clinical significance In a 2009 study of breast cancer, total ceramide synthase levels were increased in malignant tissue, and CerS4 was one of three ceramide synthases to show an increase in mRNA levels. A significant correlation was found between CerS4 and CerS2/CerS6 expression. Unlike CerS1 and CerS5, CerS4 does not sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. CerS4 may also be involved in the control of body weight and food intake. Upon administration of leptin, a decrease in ceramide levels was observed in rat white adipose tissue, as were expression levels of a number of genes in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, including CerS2 and CerS4. CerS4 expression was also found to be elevated in the brain of an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.

The faithful of this eparchy, numbering 326,742, belong to the ancient St. Thomas Christian community. The seat of the bishop is the St. Thomas Cathedral based in the town of Palai. The current bishop is Mar Joseph Kallarangatt, serving since March 2004. Mar Jacob Muricken has been auxiliary bishop since 2012. Pope Pius XII, by the bull \\"Quo Ecclesiarum\\", issued on 1950 created the Eparchy of Palai. It's a suffragan eparchy of the Archeparchy of Changanassery.  Introduction  Pope Pius XII, by the Bull \\"Quo Ecclesiarum\\", issued on 25 July 1950, bifurcated the eparchy of Changanacherry and out of the territory covered by the then Foranes of Palai, Muttuchira, Kuravilangad, Anakkallu and Ramapuram erected the eparchy of Palai as a suffragan of the Archeparchy of Ernakulam. Most Rev. Dr. Leo P. Kierkels, the Apostolic Internuncio in India, published the Bull in the St. Thomas Cathedral Palai on 4 January 1951 and installed Mar Sebastian Vayalil as the first Bishop of the new eparchy. On 22 August 1956 when the Holy See by the Ap.Const. ‚ÄòRegnum Coelorum‚Äô raised the eparchy of Changanacherry to the status of an Archeparchy and constituted the new ecclesiastical province of Changanacherry, the eparchy of Palai became one of its suffragans. Mar Joseph Kallarangatt is the current Bishop of the eparchy. Mar Jacob Muricken was appointed as auxiliary bishop in 2012.  Saints and causes for canonisation  = St. Alphonsa = Sister Alphonsa was beatified along with Father Kuriakose Elias Chavara, T.O.C.D., at Kottayam, on 8 February 1986 by Pope John Paul II during his Apostolic Pilgrimage to India. During his speech at Nehru Stadium, the Pope said that: \\"From early in her life, Sister Alphonsa experienced great suffering. With the passing of the years, the heavenly Father gave her an ever fuller share in the Passion of his beloved Son. We recall how she experienced not only physical pain of great intensity, but also the spiritual suffering of being misunderstood and misjudged by others. But she constantly accepted all her sufferings with serenity and trust in God, ‚Ä¶ She wrote to her spiritual director: \\"Dear Father, as my good Lord Jesus loves me so very much, I sincerely desire to remain on this sick bed and suffer not only this, but anything else besides, even to the end of the world. I feel now that God has intended my life to be an oblation, a sacrifice of suffering\\" (20 November 1944). She came to love suffering because she loved the suffering Christ. She learned to love the Cross through her love of the crucified Lord.\\" On Sunday, 12 October 2008, Pope Benedict XVI announced her canonization at a ceremony at Saint Peter's Square. Indians from across the world, especially people from Kerala, gathered at the ceremony in Rome. Among them was a 10-year-old Kerala boy Jinil Joseph whose clubfoot ‚Äì a birth defect ‚Äì was, in the judgment of Vatican officials, miraculously healed after prayers to Alphonsa in 1999. In the homily, Pope Benedict XVI recalled Saint Alphonsa's life as one of \\"extreme physical and spiritual suffering.\\" \\"This exceptional woman ‚Ä¶ was convinced that her cross was the very means of reaching the heavenly banquet prepared for her by the Father\\", the pope stated. \\"By accepting the invitation to the wedding feast, and by adorning herself with the garment of God's grace through prayer and penance, she conformed her life to Christ's and now delights in the 'rich fare and choice wines' of the heavenly kingdom.\\" \\"(Her) heroic virtues of patience, fortitude and perseverance in the midst of deep suffering remind us that God always provides the strength we need to overcome every trial\\", the pope stated before the ceremony ended. The grave at St. Mary's Forane Church in Bharananganam where the Franciscan Clarist Sister was buried had a chapel built there, which houses her mortal remains. = Thevarparampil Kunjachan = Thevarparambil Kunjachan (born Augustine) was a priest who dedicated himself to the spiritual and temporal welfare of a marginalized set of people who were poor and exploited for generations. Augustine was born on 1 April 1891, at Ramapuram in Travancore (present-day Kerala, India). He was the son of Itty Iype and Eliswa of the Thevarparambil clan, which was a branch of the Kuzhumpil lineage. Augustine received his primary education at a school sponsored by the government of Travancore. He advanced to St. Ephrem's School in Mannanam where his religious faith intensified, compelling him to pursue a career as a priest. After completing in secondary education at St Ephrem's School, Augustine embarked on a jounery on foot from Ramapuram to Changanacherry in order to enroll in St Thomas Minor Seminary. After receiving his major seminary formation at Puthenpally Seminary in Varapuzha, Augustine was ordained as a priest on 16 July 1915. In Ramapuram, Kunjachan witnessed an entire caste of people deprived of dignity, respect, and the basic necessities of life. He would devote his entire life towards the upheaval of the downtrodden. After a brief period of serious illness Kunjachan died on 16 October 1973 at the age of 82. At his death the children and others told that \`a saint has passed away'. At his funeral the priest who preached the panegyric, spoke well of his holiness in life, apostolic zeal, kindness of heart, love for the poor and other outstanding virtues. And towards the end of the speech he said to the surprise of all, \\"we are participating in the funeral of a saint. We have one more mediator in heaven.\\" Kunjachan had the reputation of a holy man even while he was alive. People irrespective of caste and religion, used to approach him in their manifold needs and they got favours through his prayers and blessings. Within a few days after his death his tomb at Ramapuram became a centre of pilgrimage for people from far and wide. The process of Beatification and Canonization started on 11 August 1987 at Ramapuram, bestowing upon him the title, \`Servant of God'. The \`Positio super vita et virtutibus' was completed after ten years and was submitted at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 12 February 1997. The \`Positio' on the heroic practice of virtues of the saintly priest was approved by Pope John Paul II on 22 June 2004 and he was declared \`Venerable'. Meanwhile, the process of the miraculous cure of the clubfoot of a boy was undertaken, and the findings were sent to Rome for consideration. After a thorough investigation of the miraculous nature of the cure, made by competent personnel in Rome, Pope Benedict XVI approved it, opening the way for Beatification. Venerable Kunjachan was beatified by Card. Varkey Vithayathil, Major Arch bishop of the Syro-Malabar Church on 30 April 2006 at the very same village Ramapuram where he was born, worked, died and buried. The Papal Nuncio to India Archbishop Pedro Lopez Quintana, Cardinal Telesphore Toppo, President of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI), and other Bishops and priests participated in the ceremony. The Feast of Blessed Kunjachan is celebrated on 16 October every year. Kunjachan had his last times at family house Thervarparampil Ramapuram. = Venerable Fr. Mathew Kadalikkattil = Fr. Mathew Kadalikkattil, ardent devotee of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and a man of compassionate heart. He was born on 25 April 1872 as the second son of Cherian and Rosa of a Syrian Catholic family Kadalikkattil at Edappady belonging to the diocese of Pala. The family atmosphere of Fr. Mathew was so religious that it instilled in the boy the noblest qualities of compassion to the poor, selfless love, an inclination to prayer and other Christian virtues. Right from his younger days he had the opportunity to grow in the devotion to the most Sacred Heart of Jesus. As he wanted to dedicate himself fully to the service of the Church, he joined the seminary conducted in the Syrian Carmelite monastery at Mannanam and was ordained priest on 17 February 1901. He was a true follower of the good shepherd in search of the lost sheep very much like 'Cure De Ars'. He spent long hours in the confessional and brought about changes in the lives of many sinners. To experience and share the compassionate love of the Sacred Heart to the poor and the destitute he started a new religious community on January I, 1911 in a small house with four members and consecrated it to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. He had become an apostle of devotion to the Sacred Heart to the extent that he used to sign himself under the title 'The servant of Sacred Heart'. Many families were inspired by his devotion to the Sacred Heart to lead a fervent Christian life. Thirty four years of physical strain, continuous attention to difficult work, frequent rheumatic and diabetic complaints have been exhausting his energy. After a month of very painful illness he yielded his soul to the loving Heart of Jesus on 23 May 1935. The cause for the Beatification and Canonization of Fr. Mathew Kadalikkattil was started on 24 January 1989. After completing the process of study, Pope Benedict XVI signed the Decree promulgated by the Congregation for the cause of Saints concerning the Heroic Virtues of the Servant of God Fr. Mathew Kadalikkattil, raising him to the status of 'Venerable' on 27 June 2011.

Although common throughout the kingdom, the role was more common and important in the administration of the Azores. History The King of Portugal had by ordination, in the entire kingdom, the right to send important authorities, in his name, to correct the acts at all levels of the local administration and judiciary.Carlos Melo Bento (2008), p.62 To this end, since he was unable to participate directly, he established the post of Corregedor. The first Corregedor with jurisdiction over the Azores, Dr. Afonso de Matos, was nominated by King Manuel I of Portugal in 1503. Part of his obligation was that he was required to visit the Azores once per year, at the expense of the local authorities.Gaspar Frutuoso (Saudades da Terra), Book VI, Chapter XII, p.91 (1963) After 1535, King John established a time frame for corrections to be made in each island of the Azores, and by each Captaincy. In that statement, a four-month plan was established specifically for the islands of S√£o Jorge,On S√£o Jorge, a judge was appointed a non-permanent judicial appointee that only visited briefly to carry out his role on the island. Graciosa, Faial, Pico and Flores, the islands of Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel established a specific working division and, the island of Terceira alone. In special circumstances, the Corregedor could visit each island for longer stays. Role The Corregedor in the Azores was the most important judicial magistrate, judging at the second tier, providing appeals and conflicts between presiding judges and ouvidors (the counsels, of the Captains-General). The royal edict of 1767 established the predominance of the corregador, recognizing his power to judge appeals, something that the corregedors on the continent were not permitted to do. In this role, the Corregedor could suspend the jurisdiction or their powers to judge, during his visit. Similarly, the Corregedor was responsible for inspecting the functioning of the Municipal authorities () and audit the books of the public finances.

Participants film themselves performing a creative random act of kindness, then nominate friends and family to continue on the chain. The participant usually uploads a video or pictures of the kind act to Facebook, then will tag four or five friends in the post. The nominated person is generally told to complete the task within 24 hours. Since this initiative was started, over 10,000 #FeedtheDeed posts have been uploaded to various forms of social media. The trend is most popular in Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Mexico, but has since spread to over 30 countries. The act of kindness can be anything ‚Äì from donating food and clothes to the homeless, to giving blood.  History  Feed The Deed originated as a response to the Neknominate drinking game, in which participants film themselves drinking alcohol then nominate friends to do the same. Josh Stern, a medical student at the University of Ottawa, posted his original #FeedtheDeed video to his Facebook page. He was then contacted by his friend Russell Citron, who is president and founder of the non-profit organization Kindness Counts. The two decided to collaborate on the project by taking Stern's #FeedtheDeed moniker and running it through Citron's organization Kindness Counts. Stern says that the inspiration for #FeedtheDeed came from a YouTube video in which Brent Lindeque decided to use his neknomination to give food to a homeless man instead of drinking alcohol. Lindeque is currently running a similar campaign in South Africa called #ChangeOneThing. Feed the Deed has been run through the \\"Kindness Counts\\" Facebook page.

According to London's Daily Express, \\"Hayes was the 'Madonna' of her day; she was the 19th-century operatic equivalent of the world's most famous pop star.\\" Youth in Limerick and education in Dublin and Paris (1818‚Äì1845) Hayes was baptised on 8 November 1818, in St Mary's Cathedral, Limerick. She was born of humble Anglo- Irish parentage at 4 Patrick Street, Limerick. Her father was the musician Arthur Williamson Hayes; abandoned the family in 1823, and Catherine Hayes, aged 5, grew up very poor with her mother, Mary Carroll, and sister. Mary Carroll and Arthur Williamson Hayes were married on 18 January 1815, in St Michael's Church, Limerick. They had four children, Henrietta, Charles, Catherine, and William, who were all baptised in St Mary's Cathedral, Limerick. In 1838, her vocal talents attracted the notice of Edmund Knox, the Church of Ireland bishop of Limerick. Edmund Knox resided next door to the Earl of Limerick, and heard Hayes singing casually in the back garden, and he was greatly impressed by the tone of her voice. He organized funding for Hayes to have vocal training in Limerick. She then gave private performances for the local Protestant Ascendancy. Bishop Knox sought advice from the Pigott Family in Dublin, who recommended Hayes to study under Antonio Sapio in Dublin. Funds were procured to enable Hayes to study in Dublin under Antonio Sapio, from 1 April 1839 until August 1842. Hayes, at 20 years of age, set-out with her mother for Dublin on 1 April 1839 to commence her training. They stayed with her tutor, Antonio Sapio, in his residence - No.1 Percy Place, Dublin. Her first appearance took place on 1 May 1839 at Sapio's annual concert in the charitable fund-raising theatre at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin (now the Gate Theatre), in a duet with Antonio Sapio singing \\"O'er shepard pipe\\" from Michael Balfe's opera, \\"Joan of arc\\". On 15 January 1840, she sang in her native Limerick at Swinburn's great rooms under the patronage of Bishop Knox. On 5 February she had a second performance at Sinburns, assisted by George Frederick Handel Rogers. She performed frequently in Dublin, and soon raised her terms to ten guineas a concert. One of the most important events in Hayes' young career occurred early in 1841 when she was invited to sing at another concert in Dublin, sponsored by J.P. Knight at the Long Rooms in Rotunda. The star of the evening was the celebrated Hungarian virtuoso pianist, Franz Lizst, then only 29 years of age, on his first tour of the British Isles. Luigi Lablache, a bass singer in the 19th century, was visiting Dublin in August 1841. Hayes' tutor, Sapio, spoke to him about Hayes' talent and Lablache, not only agreed to hear her sing, but was highly impressed as well. Lablache recommended to Sapio that Hayes should study under the foremost singing teacher in Europe, Manual Garcia, in Paris. After hearing Grisi and Mario in Norma on 13 Sept. 1841, she decided to come out on the lyric stage. A concert took place in Limerick to help raise the extra funds required for her to study abroad. Hayes stitched the money she had earned into her petticoat before heading off to Paris with her mother on 12 Oct. 1842. On arrival in Paris to Osborne's apartment on Rue St. George in the 9th District where many artists, musicians and writers lived. Their stay here was organised by Bishop Knox who knew the Osborne family, and Osborne was a choir master in St. Mary's cathedral. Osborne welcomed Hayes to Paris and became a life long friend who would later participate in some of her concerts. Manuel Garcia had his studio at No.6 square D'Orleans just a short distance from Osborne's apartment. She studied with Garcia from Oct. 1842 until March 1844. She did extensive studies on vocal exercises and learned to speak French during this time. Further education and early performances in Milan, Marseilles, Vienna, and Venice (1845‚Äì1848) At Milan she became the pupil of Felice Ronconi, and through the intervention of Giuseppina Grassini was engaged for the Italian Opera House, Marseilles, where on 10 May 1846 she made her first appearance on the stage as Elvira in I puritani and was enthusiastically applauded. After her return to Milan she continued her studies under Ronconi, until Morelli, the director of La Scala at Milan, offered her an engagement. Here her first character was Linda, and she was recalled twelve times by the audience. Her voice had now become a soprano of the sweetest quality, and of good compass, ascending with ease to D in alt. The upper notes were limpid, and like a well-tuned silver bell up to A. Her lower tones were the most beautiful ever heard in a real soprano, and her trill was remarkably good. She was a touching actress in all her standard parts. She was tall, with a fine figure, and graceful in her movements. Shortly after Hayes' performance at La Scala, Giuseppe Verdi became interested in her for one of his new operas. She remained at Milan during the autumn of 1845 and the carnival of 1846, and took the characters of Lucia di Lammermoor (in which part she became the most sought-after performer of the age), Zora in Mos√® in Egitto, Desdemona, and Amina. Later on in 1846 she sang in Vienna, and on the first night of the carnival of 1847 appeared in Venice in a poor opera composed for her by Malespino, a nobleman, entitled Albergo di Romano. Returning to Vienna, she took part in Estella di Murcia, expressly written for her in 1846 by Federico Ricci. Mature performing career Catherine Hayes during her Australian tour =Performances in London, Dublin, and Rome (1849‚Äì1851)= After a tour of the Italian cities, Hayes returned to England in 1849, when Delafield engaged her for the season at a salary of ¬£1,300. On 10 April she made her d√©but at Covent Garden in Linda di Chamounix, and was received with much warmth. At the close of the season, in June 1849, she sang before Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace. \\"After an evening of Italian music, the Queen requested an encore. Catherine, with a mischievous grin it is reported, sang the beautiful Irish rebellion song, Kathleen Mavourneen.\\" On 5 Nov. 1849 she appeared at a concert given by the Dublin Philharmonic Society, and afterwards at the Theatre Royal, Dublin, in Lucia, when the Edgardo was so badly played that an uproar ensued, and Sims Reeves, one of the audience, took his place on the stage. Under Lumley's management Miss Hayes played Lucia at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, on 2 April 1850, but owing to ill health and other causes she was seldom seen during the remainder of the season. At the carnival in Rome in 1851 she was engaged at the Teatro d'Apollone, and performed in Maria de Rohan for twelve nights, and received the diploma of the Academia di Santa Cecilia. From Rome she returned to London, where during the season of 1851 she was the star of the concert-room and of the performances of the Sacred Harmonic Society, singing in the oratorios of Handel, Haydn, and Mendelssohn. =Performances in the Americas (1851‚Äì1853)= Leaving England in September 1851, and first singing in New York on the 23rd of that month, she there, by the advice of William Avery Bushnell of Connecticut, an electioneering agent and former manager for the \\"Swedish Nightingale,\\" Jenny Lind, forfeited ¬£3,000, and gave Bushnell the management of her tour. Hayes also performed in Boston, Toronto, Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Charleston, Savannah, New Orleans, and forty-five other locations including the river towns along the Mississippi. Hayes \\"met presidents, statesmen and business leaders along the way.\\" P.T. Barnum sponsored Hayes' tour of California, where she was billed as \\"The Swan of Erin\\", and \\"The Hibernian Prima Donna\\". She sang \\"at San Francisco from November 1852 to May 1853, where her fees averaged ¬£650 a month; the 'semi- civilised' gold miners bidding up to ¬£1150 to hear her sing.\\" The newspaper Far West News wrote of her debut at San Francisco's American Theater in 1852 that \\"[l]ong and loud were the cheers and applause, which greeted her entr√©e ... She acknowledged again and again the enthusiastic testimonial, and again and again the audience cheered and applauded ... It was while standing at the foot-lights, amid the storm of applause, that our citizens had the first view of Miss Catherine Hayes ... Miss Hayes is about thirty years of age. She is a graceful, queen-like person, of medium stature, with a fair oval face. Her features are regular, hair bright auburn, eyes blue, and her face wears an intellectual expression without much animation. She dresses with taste, and her manner is perfectly easy and self-possessed; her gesticulation appropriate and graceful.\\" During the spring of 1853, Hayes toured the California Gold Country. She \\"was a visitor to many mining camps, and even tried her hand at gold panning.\\" The Nevada Journal newspaper of Nevada County, California wrote of her performance at the Alta Theater in Grass Valley, California on 18 April 1853 that Hayes' voice \\"broke forth in notes of most bewitching sweetness and harmony. The excitement of the audience increased to a furious extent, no doubt with proud ratification that they had heard for once in their lives, the voice that had awakened the admiration of the western world.\\" Kate Hayes Street in Grass Valley is named for Hayes. Hayes departed California for South America, and after visiting the principal cities (including Lima, Valparaiso, and Santiago) embarked for Australia. =Performances in Oceania and Asia (1854‚Äì1856)= She gave concerts in the Sandwich Islands (present-day Hawaiian Islands), and arrived at Sydney in January 1854. Her arrival in Sydney caused \\"an excitement wholly unparalleled in the theatrical annals of this colony.\\" Her performance at the Victoria Theatre on 3 October 1854 was enthusiastically received; in addition to her operatic performance, Sydney audiences very much appreciated her performances of ballads like \\"Home, Sweet Home\\" and \\"Oh, Steer My Bark to Erin's Isle.\\" At a thronged 18 October 1854 sendoff for Hayes at Sydney's Circular Quay, Judge Sir Roger Therry declared that Hayes would be recalled by Sydneysiders with \\"admiration, respect, and esteem.\\". Hayes donated the proceeds of her final concert in Sydney to the Destitute Children's Asylum. The Age newspaper called Hayes' first concert in the Queen's Theatre, Melbourne, \\"a great event in our local history.\\" After a tour through Geelong and Adelaide, she departed for Calcutta, where she disembarked in January 1855 and performed for the British colonial military there. Due to the poor economic situation in Calcutta, she left for Batavia (present-day Jakarta) and Singapore before returning to Australia, where she performed again in Sydney and Melbourne. Later life (1856‚Äì1861) Catherine Hayes's grave at Kensal Green Cemetery, London, pictured in 2014 She returned to England in August 1856, after an absence of five years. That year, she lost $27,000 by the failure of Saunders & Brennon of San Francisco. On 8 October 1857, at St. George's, Hanover Square, she married William Avery Bushnell. He soon fell into ill-health, and died at Biarritz, France, on 2 July 1858, aged 35. She appeared at Jullien's promenade concerts at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1857, when her ballad singing, the branch of art in which lay her greatest power, was much applauded. After her husband's death she took part in concerts in London and the country towns. She died in the house of a friend, Henry Lee, at Roccles, Upper Sydenham, Kent, on 11 August 1861, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery on 17 August. Her will was proved on 26 August, the personalty being sworn under ¬£16,000.

Function CerS5 robustly synthesizes C16-ceramide, which is often considered to be an important pro-apoptotic ceramide. De novo ceramide synthesis is an essential trigger for Bax activation in hypoxia/reoxygenation. Following hypoxia/reoxygenation, CerS5 expression is elevated. Upon knocking down acid sphingomyelinase and CerS5 in NTERA-2 cells, Bax localization to mitochondria was reduced, indicating the importance of CerS5 activity in the apoptosis pathway. Tissue distribution CerS5 (TRH4) mRNA is found in all tissues and is strongly expressed in muscle and brain. CerS5 is the major ceramide synthase detected in lung epithelia. Knock-down research in respiratory epithelium using CerS5 siRNA or fumonisin B1 reduced total CerS activity by 45% or 78%, respectively, indicating that CerS5 indeed contributes significantly to ceramide synthesis in lung. In the brain, CerS5 mRNA is detected in most cells within the gray and white matter tissues. Clinical significance CerS5 sensitizes cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin and vincristine, but not to cisplatin or carboplatin. A splice variant of CerS5 is expressed in lymphoma and other tumor cells and contribute to tumor recognition by the immune system. In response to upregulation of tumor suppressor protein p53, C16-ceramide levels were increased in leukemia and colon cancer cells, as were levels of CerS5 mRNA in the leukemia cells, but not in the colon cancer cells. For this reason, CerS5 looks like a promising target for the regulation of cancer and of cell death pathways.

It is one of only 270 pubs on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors, was frequented by the poet and writer Dylan Thomas, and was a noteworthy live music venue for nearly 50 years, hosting three gigs by U2 in 1980. The Half Moon Public House is listed by Southwark Council as an Asset of Community Value, and is described by Nikolaus Pevsner as, \\"a cheerful corner pub of 1896\\". History An inn has stood on the site at the west end of Half Moon Lane, nearest Herne Hill, since the middle of the 17th century, but the first public house \\"known by the Sign of the Half Moon\\" was built by Joseph Miller in 1760. A letter to the Editor of the Monthly Magazine in March 1808, records the death of a boy chimney sweep at the Half Moon on 12 February of that same year, having been taken in suffering from fatigue and cold on \\"Dulwich Lane\\", after a great quantity of snow fell. In 1844, Edward Alleyn's original tombstone, removed many years before from Dulwich College Chapel, was 're- discovered' in the skittle ground of the Half Moon, where it was believed to be serving as a cover or break-water for a parish sewer. It is said that the tombstone had \\"doubtless proved advantageous to the landlord in drawing visitors to his house.\\" One contemporary source states that \\"Mr. Webb, of the Half Moon Inn, Dulwich, presented the college with the original gravestone of Edward Alleyn, which for many years had been preserved by himself and father in the tea gardens at the rear of the inn.\\" John Webb is shown to be the tenant of the Half Moon Public House, stable and paddock for 22 years from 1824. John Webb of the Half Moon Public House, Dulwich is also shown in Old Bailey records from 1833, providing a reference of good character for a prisoner named William Patten, aged 22, who was found guilty of stealing 2 live pigs and sentenced to be \\"Transported for Seven Years\\". The Census return for 1851 shows that Mr. Webb the proprietor of the Half Moon employed five staff. In 1853, William John Webb, is shown as giving evidence in the Old Bailey in the case of Daniel Allen, aged 32, feloniously uttering a forged ten shilling Bank of England note, with intent to defraud. He states in his evidence, \\"I keep the Half-moon, at Dulwich. On Sunday, 7th Nov., between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in my bar; the prisoner came in and asked me if I could change a 10/. note for Mrs. Goulding‚ÄîI told him I could‚Äîhe had a glass of ale and a cigar, and then left‚ÄîI paid the note into the Excise- office next day (Monday), and on the following Saturday it was returned to me stamped \\"Forged\\"‚ÄîI had not known the prisoner before‚Äîthis was on a Sunday‚Äîpeople dress differently on a Sunday in my neighbourhood.\\" The prisoner was found guilty and \\"Transported for Ten Years\\". The Half Moon is recorded as being up for sale in April 1868, where it is described as having been in the hands of the Webb family for, \\"the best part of a century\\". The pub at this time is said to have four rooms on the top floor; assembly room and six other rooms on the first floor; bar and six rooms on the ground floor, and large tea garden. It is said to be held from Dulwich College for twenty-eight years unexpired, at ¬£95 per annum, and ¬£1 in lieu of land tax. A range of stabling is also underlet at ¬£32 per annum. The Half Moon Tavern, 1880 In 1878, the area of Dulwich is described as being \\"a favourite resort for the working men of London, for the purpose of holding their annual gatherings at one or other of its taverns, the chief of which are the \\"Greyhound,\\" the \\"Half Moon,\\" and the \\"Crown.\\"\\" At this time, the Half Moon was particularly noted for its flower garden, lawns and tea gardens. A newspaper report in April of the same year, records the story of a smartly dressed gentleman asking the stableman at the Half Moon to clean his shoes, and the stableman receiving the princely payment of a half sovereign in return. While cleaning the shoes, the gentleman told the stableman that he had just lost ¬£1,800 on the Grand National, and was later seen in the act of committing suicide on the track near Herne Hill railway station. 19th century English author, poet and artist John Ruskin refers to walking \\"between the hostelry of the Half-moon at the bottom of Herne Hill, and the secluded college of Dulwich\\". Stanfords' 1864 map shows a tributary of the River Effra flowing north towards Half Moon Lane and running along it, past the Half Moon pub, to Herne Hill. Before the river was covered over in this area in 19th century, John Ruskin describes this tributary as a \\"tadpole-haunted ditch\\". During this period, the Half Moon Tavern was accessed by crossing a bridge over the Effra, which appears in an early sketch from 1810. The rural nature of the Half Moon‚Äôs environs in the early part of the 19th century, is demonstrated by the fact that in 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars, army manoeuvres took place in Dulwich, with troops stationed on the village green in Half Moon Lane and at the cross roads by the Half Moon Public House. The Half Moon is also mentioned as being the location of a strategic \\"line of defence\\" in William Le Queux's fictional account of an invasion led by France and Russia, The Great War in England in 1897, published in 1895. Between 1894 and 1896, the old Half Moon was rebuilt as a hotel by architect James William Brooker in Jacobethan Revival style. Brooker lived locally in East Dulwich. The size of the new hotel and richness of its fittings is partly explained by its location near the terminus of one of the horse-drawn omnibus services into London. The demolition of the former Half Moon Tavern by its owners The Dulwich Estate was clearly not universally popular at the time, with a subsequent poem appearing in Punch entitled \\"The Doom of Dulwich\\", including the lines, \\"Alas for the famous old inns! Ah! progress is all very well, But one of its shockingest sins, Is ringing antiquity's knell. The ‚ÄúCrown‚Äù and the ‚ÄúHalf Moon‚Äù are gone, And now they the Greyhound attack.\\" Writing in May 1896, Alfred Allison, describes the new development, \\"The picturesque old Half Moon at Herne Hill, with its low ceilings and quaint gables, was recently given over to the wreckers. Not a brick or a plank remains. In its place has grown up a gigantic modern structure quite in keeping with the new surroundings.\\" In August 1898, the International Brewers' Journal reports that the new owner of the Half Moon, Thomas Cason, appeared in court claiming that he was induced by misrepresentation as to the takings of the public house when entering into a contract of purchase to buy it for the agreed sum of ¬£64,000 in 1897. After appointing a manager, Mr. Davis, of considerable experience, he stated that he found that he could not take anything like the figures that had been represented to him. The jury without retiring returned a verdict for the defendant, Mr. Wm. Arthur Hine, who gave evidence that the plaintiff had nearly given up the cheap dinners to workmen, had changed the staff, and removed a Freemasons' Lodge from the house. Judgment was entered accordingly with costs. In December 1899, social reformer Charles Booth notes that the Half Moon pub had sold \\"a year or so ago\\" for ¬£64,000. This was a huge sum considering that houses in neighbouring Stradella Road cost less than ¬£1,000 at this time. In September 1907, a barman named Joseph Kemp, going upstairs to his bedroom at the Half Moon Public House, fell over the banisters, and died from his injuries a few seconds after being picked up. In 1908, Edith Smith, barmaid at the Half Moon Hotel, Herne Hill, gives evidence at the Old Bailey in a case of counterfeit coinage stating, \\"The \\"Half Moon\\" is a large house and was rebuilt some years ago. There are six bars ... the front bar, or public bar ... is quite open and there are no screens round it.\\" She states that the pub is never busy in the afternoon, that she usually serves in the saloon bar, and that \\"a glass of ale and a screw of tobacco\\" costs two pence. The pub at this time is also described as having a cash register. In 1921, Brixton Chess Club began convening in the Half Moon, and the club marked the change of venue by inviting the famous Russian chess player Eugene Znosko-Borovsky to give a simultaneous exhibition (simul) there on Thursday 21 April. In June 1930, police from all the surrounding stations were rushed by motor tenders to the Half Moon Hotel to help quell a disturbance involving 500 fighting Irishmen. The resulting police action involved baton charges, and seven arrests were made. The incident took place on Whit Monday, and involved fighting between rival supporters of Dublin and Cork hurling teams, who played each other at Herne Hill Velodrome. In the subsequent court case, Lambeth magistrates heard evidence from Detective- Sergeant Moyer, who said that when he arrived on the scene he saw a small body of police with their backs to the wall and truncheons drawn, surrounded by a mob of 500 hooligans. Tumblers were used as missiles, it was stated, and 200 glasses were broken. On 4 March 1935, shortly after shortly after the discovery of a burglary at the Half Moon Hotel, the landlord, William Nye Songhurst, died suddenly from shock. He was aged 47 years, and is reported to have suffered with a bad heart. Photo of the tiled entrance to the Half Moon Hotel in Herne Hill, London.The stained glass windows of the Half Moon Pub in Herne Hill still advertise its previous activities.Inside the Half Moon, Herne Hill The Historic England listing for the Half Moon Public House states that, \\"The proliferation of ornament across the surface of this building gives the whole a sense of vital unity through their sheer number.\\" The Half Moon is also listed by CAMRA as, \\"A pub with a nationally important historic interior.\\" Only 270 pubs meet CAMRA's exacting criteria and the Half Moon is one of them. The snug bar (referred to as a \\"Billiard Room\\" in CAMRA's 1988 South East London Pub Guide) contains six back-painted mirrors depicting birds and signed by the renowned ‚ÄòW. Gibbs & Sons glass decorators‚Äô of Blackfriars. The pub is also noteworthy for the rare survival of joinery and associated fabric at the public bar. The large, uncompartmented public bar at the Half Moon is a typical feature of pubs built during the 1890s pub boom. Photos of the pub from the first part of the 20th century, show it to be operated by the Southwark-based brewery Barclay Perkins & Co. The original entrance to the 'Hotel', is indicated by a portico, supported by columns, jutting out from the right-hand side of the pub. The Victorian mosaic tilework at this entrance mark out the words \\"The Half Moon Hotel\\". The rear of the Half Moon comprises both an original element forming a billiards room, and a later addition constructed during the 1930s to convert this area into a snooker room. These two activities are still advertised in the stained glasswork on the outside of the pub. The poet and writer Dylan Thomas lived locally on Milkwood Road and used to drink at The Half Moon. Writer A.F. Churchward-Tinsley, writing in a Welsh magazine in 1959, first drew the connection between Dylan Thomas and the Half Moon. He interviewed Dylan's friend, sculptor and London Welsh rugby player, Evan Samuel, who recounts how, \\"Dylan used to come to watch the London Welsh games, and when, after the match, the teams would gather, as rugger clubs do, for a few pints at the old Half Moon Hotel at Herne Hill, Dylan would be there adding lustre to the gathering. He was a great conversationalist\\". London Welsh Rugby Football Club had their home at the nearby Herne Hill Velodrome for over 40 years after World War I, where \\"alcohol was not permitted by the Dulwich College landlords\\". The club adopted the Half Moon pub, with player Vivian Jenkins recalling, \\"If I had been given a fiver for every time I sang Sospan Fach or Calon Lan at the old 'Half Moon' near Herne Hill Station in my playing days in the thirties I should be a millionaire!\\" On 5 May 1969, The Daily Mirror reports the story of builder Alec Graham, 40, who got into a fight with a drinking pal just before closing time at the Half Moon, which resulted in his ear being entirely severed. Alec's ear was handed to him by the pub landlord, Bert Hyland, whereupon he groaned, \\"I don't want it\\", before popping it into a dustbin. Alec later went to hospital to be treated, his ear was retrieved after doctors called for a police search, and successfully sewn back on. The landlord, Bert Hyland, was a former champion boxer, who won the Irish Middleweight title in June 1949. \\"It wasn't a serious fight\\" said Mr. Hyland, \\"Alec put the lock on this chap, who reached up and tore off his ear. I picked it up and handed it to Alec and told him to get it sewn back on\\". Alec is reported as saying afterwards, \\"I feel a bit groggy. Now I just want to forget about it. I've shaken hands with my friend\\". During the tenancy of Robert Harrison (2006-2013), listed building consent was granted in 2007 for the formation of a new opening in the existing tongue and groove boarding adjacent to the existing decorative glazed screen between the front Public Bar and Saloon Bar. Music venue Live Music Venue Sign ‚Äì Half Moon, Herne Hill The Half Moon was a live music venue for nearly 50 years, with bands having appeared early in their careers including The Police, Van Morrison and U2. Locals still refer to an impromptu Half Moon performance by Frank Sinatra, who dropped by to visit his old chauffeur. A press photo of Sinatra's ex-wife Mia Farrow meeting her former chauffeur Dennis Parker, on his first night as landlord of the Half Moon at Herne Hill, would also appear to substantiate this connection, and subsequently date any Sinatra visit to the pub to the 1970s. Farrow is recorded as having stayed in the Half Moon for twenty minutes. Sinatra is said to have introduced Dennis Parker to everyone as \\"my friend Dennis\\". In the early to mid 1960s, The Half Moon hosted one of the premier folk clubs in South London, drawing large numbers of people every Tuesday night. The club was run by Ed Parslow and Charles Pearce, both of whom were students at the Camberwell College of Arts. Pearce was the floor singer and guests included Dave and Toni Arthur, Bert Jansch, Cliff Aungier, Gerry Lockran, Diz Disley, Pete and Marian Gray, The Hickory Nuts, and The Bruce Turner Jump Band. The Half Moon was a significant South London venue on the 1970s pub rock circuit, hosting performances by Dr. Feelgood, Meal Ticket, 9 Below Zero, and Eddie and the Hot Rods. Around 1974, local musician Stevie Smith started the renowned Sunday jam sessions at the Half Moon. These sessions featured other Herne Hill musicians such as Steve Waller and Brendan Hoban, alongside an amazing array of musical talent from contemporary bands, including The Jeff Beck Group, the Rory Gallagher band, and Thin Lizzy. Steve Waller went on to join Manfred Mann's Earth Band after Manfred Mann was, \\"recommended to check out a popular South London circuit musician ‚Äì a singer and guitarist ‚Äì at the Half Moon pub, Herne Hill.\\" A barmaid at the Half Moon recalls that Steve Waller always ordered a 'triple gin and bitter lemon' at the Sunday lunchtime jam session. Two remarkable videos featuring a live set of Steve Waller's Overload from the summer of 1990 in the Half Moon exist. The Half Moon in Herne Hill also has a notable place in rock history as being the venue where Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records, first met the members of U2 and watched them perform. Island Records public-relations chief Rob Partridge described the encounter: \\"It just so happened that U2 were playing at the Half Moon in Herne Hill, a gig they'd repeatedly played through the course of coming to London. Chris had never seen the band and so went from the Bob (Marley) gig to Herne Hill and met up with the band. The dressing room is like a front room, and I just remember him taking an immediate delight in the band because they are bright, articulate, funny, all those kind of things.\\" Chris Blackwell describes the 8 June 1980 gig as having, \\"probably 12 people in the audience.\\" However, by their return gig at the Half Moon on 11 July 1980, U2 marked a milestone, as it was the first time they'd sold out a concert venue in the UK. A review of the gig by Bill Graham for Hot Press states, \\"for the encore Bono leaps off the stage to serenade the audience from the raised enclosure where the mixing desk and us flunkies are located.\\" Producer Steve Lillywhite is also recorded as being present at this show. Not everyone was impressed. Comedian Vic Reeves states that, \\"I saw U2 there. I wasn‚Äôt impressed ‚Äì they looked like they wanted to be punks but they weren‚Äôt. Bono‚Äôs haircut was atrocious.\\" Music writer, Michael Odell, recalls a conversation with Bono backstage at Madison Square Garden, where he mentions that he lives near to the Half Moon in Herne Hill where U2 played, but in answer to Bono's question, \\"Were you there?\\" has to admit that he didn't see them play. U2 played one further time at the Half Moon on the opening leg of their tour to promote their album Boy on 5 October 1980. Photos of U2 at Half Moon feature in a photozine by Andy Phillips, documenting the band's first and earliest visits to the UK in 1980. A drawing of Bono's 1980 haircut, rendered in stainless steel by the artist Caroline McCarthy, now adorns the inside of the pub. The Half Moon was the venue where The Alarm announced their new name to the world in January 1981, and performed a second gig in May 1982. It also hosted the first ever gig by Then Jerico in 1983, and the first gig by Gavin Rossdale of Bush. Rossdale says, \\"My first gig was in the Half Moon pub in Herne Hill - I was standing on the stage thinking, 'Why the f*** did I do this?' But after that, it all went pretty well.\\" The era of New wave music in the early 1980s was a particularly rich period in the Half Moon's music history, with a succession of bands and performers including The Stray Cats, The Comsat Angels, The Triffids, The Sound, The Go-Betweens, The Chameleons, Jason and the Scorchers, and Billy Bragg all appearing. The Billy Bragg gig on 12 December 1983 was reviewed in both Sounds and Melody Maker, \\"Pity (Billy Bragg's) doting followers, who arrived in their buzzing droves, didn't have the decency to stay for the main act.\\" By 5 January 1984, Bragg had graduated to performing at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), which he recalls saying, \\"None of this bollocking about playing the Half Moon and the Rock Garden, this was a proper gig that got proper reviews by everyone.\\" Writing in The Guardian in 1981, Robin Denselow states, \\"The Half Moon, Herne Hill, South London, is established as a testing ground for bands who often move on to greater things.\\" The Half Moon was also a venue for more well-known acts going back to their roots, hosting gigs by Steve Marriott in 1984, and Grammy Award winner Albert Lee in 1990. In 1998, \\"The Bard of Salford\\" John Cooper Clarke performed at the Half Moon. In 2003, punk rock band The Parkinsons played the pub. More recent acts at the Half Moon during the tenancy of Robert Harrison from 2006‚Äì13, include Paloma Faith, Kate Tempest (with her band Sound of Rum in 2009), Rumer, The Beat, The Handsome Family, The Wonderstuff, The Coal Porters, Wilko Johnson, and Turin Brakes. Chris Sievey's comic persona Frank Sidebottom appeared onstage in June 2007. The musician and founder of 2 Tone Records, Jerry Dammers, also used the Half Moon as a rehearsal space during this time. The beginning of the pub's relationship with 2 Tone Records dates back to the early 1980s, when bands from the label, such as The Swinging Cats and The Higsons played there. A poster for Clinic's show at the Half Moon in 2010, appears in the book \\"Classic Rock Posters ‚Äì Sixty Years of Posters and Flyers: 1952 to 2012\\". At the same 'secret show', support act Anna Calvi is said to have blown Clinic off the stage. Grammy Award winner La Roux launched her singing career at the pub when she was 17, after being encouraged by her parents to perform at an open mic night. She recalls, \\"I spent a couple of years going to my local pub in Herne Hill doing open mic nights there.\\" The pub is also particularly renowned as a long-standing venue for live blues music. DJ Food was the last act to perform at the Half Moon before it was closed due to a flood in 2013. As well as music, the Half Moon has hosted regular comedy, with acts including Mark Lamarr, Eddie Izzard and Omid Djalili. Comedian Jo Brand said, \\"I have lived in this area since 1978 and in Herne Hill for a few years as a student nurse. The Half Moon was always the centre of the universe for us, and when I started doing stand-up comedy, I performed there a few times.\\" The pub has also been a regular venue for theatre, and is listed in the London Theatre Report published in 2014. The play Botallack O'Clock premiered at the Half Moon in 2011, before transferring to the Edinburgh Festival in 2012, and New York City in 2013. The Inbetweeners Movie actress Lydia Rose Bewley performed in theatre productions at the pub in 2010. The Half Moon has also been a venue for Rollapaluza cycling. There has also been a boxing gym upstairs at the Half Moon. Danny Williams, who knocked out Mike Tyson in 2004, and went on to fight for the WBC heavyweight title, trained here as a child. The boxing gym was run for a number years by former British and European light welterweight champion Clinton McKenzie. The charity London Community Boxing (LCB) was founded by people who met at the Half Moon gym. Depictions English writer and poet Richard Church recalls stopping for lunch at The Half Moon Tavern to \\"rest the horses\\", when moving home from Battersea to Herne Hill as a child in Edwardian era London. \\"I sat on the tailboard, and the foreman treated me to a ginger beer and a meat pie.\\" In 1988, the public bar of the Half Moon featured in an advert for Red Rock Cider, directed by John Lloyd and starring Leslie Nielsen. The Half Moon is depicted in the graphic novel, From Hell, by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. In 2007, as part of the \\"Disappearing London\\" documentary television series that was broadcast on ITV London, Madness frontman Suggs visited the Half Moon to interview boxer Clinton McKenzie in his boxing gym above the pub. In April 2008, comedian Ronnie Corbett was interviewed with TV presenters Ant and Dec in the Half Moon for The Observer. Scenes from the 2011 British movie Treacle Jr., directed by Jamie Thraves and starring Aidan Gillen, were filmed in the Half Moon. Recent history The pub was flooded in August 2013, and was subsequently closed for a number of years. In 2014, The Dulwich Estate put forward proposals for the conversion of the upper floors of the Half Moon into five self-contained flats and a mews house at the rear, but these plans were subsequently withdrawn following pre-application planning advice received from Southwark Council. In December 2015, the pub was awarded Asset of Community Value (ACV) status by Southwark Council. The ACV status of the Half Moon was upheld by Southwark Council in April 2016, following an appeal by The Dulwich Estate against the listing. In January 2016, London's Fuller's Brewery acquired the lease from the freeholder, The Dulwich Estate. The pub reopened on 20 March 2017. In April 2016, the Half Moon made international news after a picture of its barred list became a viral hit on Twitter. A book of stories inspired by the barred list has successfully been crowd-funded, and is currently being designed and edited. The book hit its fundraising target of ¬£4,000 on crowdfunding publisher Unbound in October 2017, although a publication date is currently not known. A community campaign to save the music venue at the rear of the pub received backing from local celebrities including Jo Brand, La Roux, and even the Mayor of London, but suffered a setback in April 2016 when Southwark Council approved plans to remove the stage and replace it with a new kitchen and dining area. Whilst no longer a regular music venue, the Half Moon hosts live entertainment each year for Dylan Day on 14 May, celebrating the connection of Dylan Thomas with the pub. It is also used as a venue for the annual Herne Hill Music Festival and Herne Hill Free Film Festival. The new function room, called 'The Workshop', is located in a converted 1920s garage building at the back of the Half Moon. In 2018, the Half Moon was a finalist in The Publican Awards for 'Best New Pub/Bar'. In May 2018, the Half Moon was named the Regional Winner for London in the National Pub and Bar Awards. In November 2019, the pub was named winner of The Griffin Trophy, for Fuller's best pub.

Situated near Kocakara village in the northeast and Be≈üyol village of Bornova district in the southwest on the province border of Manisa and Izmir, the twin-tube tunnel is long carrying two lanes of traffic in each direction. In 2011, the Manisa- Izmir route had a daily traffic rate of 30,000 vehicles. The tunnel is being built to bypass the steep and twisty route at Sabuncubeli Pass, reducing the grade of highway from 7‚Äì8% to 1.5%. When completed, it will shorten the travel time between Manisa and Izmir from 45 minutes to 15 minutes, and will contribute to elimination of traffic congestion in the winter time. The contract for the building of the tunnel was awarded to Ko√ßoƒülu and Makimsan Consortium on the build-operate-transfer basis, and was signed on August 18, 2011. It was projected that the -long tunnel was to be finished within three years costing 110 million. The groundbreaking ceremony took place in presence of Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m on September 9, 2011. The construction works were suspended for seven months right after the groundbreaking in order to undertake a revision in the tunnel project. The new project featured the extension of the tunnel length from initially planned to , and a lesser road grade than of previously designed. The tunnel runs in average underground with a maximum depth of . Excavation works continue at a daily rate of with a total of 150 personnel. The estimated cost was revised to 150 million. A landslide, which occurred in the western tube on the northeast portal during the excavation works in 2013, caused the lengthening of the tunnel to now , and hence a delay in the construction's completion. The tunnel opening is postponed from 2015 to end 2016 but it did not open. The constructing company had the concession to operate the tunnel for a time span of 11 years 11 months and 11 days after its opening, and to collect the Turkish lira equivalent of US$2.50 as toll but it went bankrupt. The tunnel opened on 11th June 2018. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m was the first one who drove in the tunnel. Criticism Hasan S√∂zbilir, a professor at Dokuz Eyl√ºl University and member of the Izmir Branch of the Chamber of Engineering Geology, warned at a press conference in December 2012 that the Sabuncubeli Tunnel is situated entirely on one of the fault zones in the region.

When added to the column, small molecules have to travel through the extensive pores of the resin beads, while large macromolecules like proteins can't fit and therefore travel around them. This allows the larger molecules to flow through the column at a faster rate than smaller molecules that have to traverse through the resin. Thus, the desalted proteins can be separated and collected. Desalting and buffer exchange are methods to separate soluble macromolecules from smaller molecules (desalting) or replace the buffer system used for another one suitable for a downstream application (buffer exchange). These methods are based on gel filtration chromatography, also called molecular sieve chromatography, which is a form of size-exclusion chromatography. Desalting and buffer exchange are two of the most common gel filtration chromatography applications, and they can be performed using the same resin. Desalting and buffer exchange both entail recovering the components of a sample in whatever buffer is used to pre- equilibrate the small, porous polymer beads (resin). Desalting occurs when buffer salts and other small molecules are removed from a sample in exchange for water (with the resin being pre-equilibrated in water). Buffer exchange occurs when the buffer salts in a sample are exchanged for those in another buffer.  Applications  Desalting is used to remove salts from protein solutions, phenol or unincorporated nucleotides from nucleic acids or excess crosslinking or labeling reagents from conjugated proteins. Buffer exchange is used to transfer a protein solution into a buffer system appropriate for downstream applications such as ion exchange, electrophoresis or affinity chromatography.  Principles of Desalting and Buffer Exchange  Size exclusion chromatography applications for separating macromolecules based on subtle differences in size typically use resins with large and varied pore sizes in long chromatography columns. However, for buffer exchange and desalting applications, it is mainly the maximum effective pore size (exclusion limit or molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of the resin) that determines the size of molecules that can be separated. Molecules that are significantly smaller than the MWCO penetrate into the pores of the resin, while molecules larger than the MWCO are unable to enter the pores and remain together in the void volume of the column. By passing samples through a column resin bed with sufficient length and volume, macromolecules can be fully separated from small molecules that travel a greater distance though the pores of the resin bed. No significant separation of molecules larger than the exclusion limit occurs. In order for the desired macromolecules to remain in the void volume, resins with very small pores sizes must be utilized. For typical desalting and buffer exchange applications choosing a resin with a molecular weight cut off between 5 and 10KDa is usually best. For other applications, such as separating peptides from full-sized proteins, resins with larger exclusion limits may be necessary. The macromolecular components are recovered in the buffer used to pre-equilibrate the gel-filtration matrix, while the small molecules can be collected in a later fraction volume or be left trapped in the resin. One important feature to note when choosing a resin is that the small molecules targeted for removal must be several times smaller than the MWCO for proper separation.  Desalting and Buffer Exchange vs. Dialysis  Dialysis is useful for many of the same desalting and buffer exchange applications performed with gel filtration chromatography, as both methods are based on similar molecular weight cut-off limits. Gel filtration has the advantage of speed (a few minutes vs. hours for dialysis) along with the ability to remove contaminants from relatively small-volume samples compared to dialysis which is an important feature when working with toxic or radioactive substances. Dialysis, on the other hand, is much less dependent on sample size as related to device format. For dialysis applications, achieving a high percentage sample recovery and molecule removal is generally straight forward with little optimization. For gel filtration applications it is important to select a column size and format that is suitable for your sample.  Gel Filtration Formats for Small Sample Processing  There are a number of common formats for performing gel filtration for smaller (less than 4mL) volumes: * Chromatography columns * Gravity-flow columns * Chromatography cartridges * Centrifuge columns * Centrifuge plates Gravity-flow, or drip, columns use head-pressure from a buffer-chase to push the sample through the gel filtration matrix. Sample is loaded into the top of an upright column and allowed to flow into the resin bed. The sample is then chased through the column by adding additional buffer or water to the top of the column. During this process, small fractions are typically collected and each is tested for the macromolecules of interest. In some cases, several fractions might contain the protein and may have to be pooled to improve yield. In order to eliminate the time and monitoring assorted with drip columns, fractions often equal to the full exclusion volume of the column are collected regardless of sample volume resulting in significant dilution of sample. Sealed chromatography cartridges or columns work similarly except the sample and buffer is pumped into and through the resin by an external device such as a liquid chromatographic (LC) system, also requiring collection and monitoring of several fractions. Even though this method is often semi-automated, using chromatography cartridges is typically limited to processing one sample at a time and some sample dilution from the chase buffer is still likely to occur. To eliminate sample dilution and the collecting and monitoring of fractions, centrifuge column or plate -based gel filtration, also referred to as spin desalting, methods are commonly used. Spin desalting is unique in that a centrifuge is used to first clear the void volume of liquid in the resin, followed by sample addition and centrifugation. After centrifugation, the macromolecules in the sample have moved through the column in approximately the same initial volume, but the small molecules have been forced into the pores of the resin and replaced by the buffer that was used to pre-equilibrate the gel-filtration matrix. Spin columns and plates eliminate the need to wait for samples to emerge by gravity flow and require no chromatography system, allowing for multiple-sample processing simultaneously.

Dailey, originally known as the Claire B. Follette, is a wooden barge built by William H. Follette in 1915 at Tonawanda, New York, and rebuilt and renamed in 1928 by Brown Drydock on Staten Island, New York. It was used to transport materials from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It is the only known surviving Erie Canal boat and is one of a few remaining wooden-hulled canal boats. It sank in 1974 along with the Priscilla Dailey and the Berkshire No. 7 in the harbor of Bridgeport, Connecticut on the west side of the Pequonnock River. It has deteriorated to the point that a salvage operation could result in it breaking apart. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978. Description The barge is an Erie Canal boat that has two Fairbanks-Morse in-line six-cylinder diesel engines. It measures long with a beam. The depth of the hold is listed at and it had a listed capacity of 101 tons. Clouette describes the Elmer S. Dailey as having an \\"almost rectangular hull in section and plan, with bluntly rounded bow and stern...the bulwarks, perforated by scuppers, rise up to the stem which is slightly raked back. There are prominent strakes in the bow and topside along the sides of the vessel. A coaming about high frames the single large cargo opening which occupies about two-thirds of the boat's length\\". The cargo opening is covered by convex hatch covers. Towards the stern is a rectangular pilothouse and a low cabin with a companionway which has a protruding stack.  History  The Elmer S. Dailey was originally known as the Claire B. Follette when it was built by William H. Follette in 1915 at Tonawanda, New York. In 1928, the ship was rebuilt by Brown Drydock on Staten Island and acquired the name Elmer S. Dailey. Brown Drydock installed two Fairbanks-Morse in-line six-cylinder diesel engines and added the pilothouse and stack. At an unspecified later date, one engine was removed and a direct- drive engine, rated at 180 or 210 horsepower, operated on compressed air. In its final configuration, the vessel was manned by a three-man crew. The ship was owned by Stewart J. Dailey, a former mule driver on the Erie Canal who later became a partner in a Tonawanda shipbuilding company and afterwards opened his own business, S. J. Dailey Company. and The barge was used to transport materials between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, and after the diesel engines were added, it was able to push another barge. It was in service between 1941 and 1972, and afterwards was moored in Bridgeport Harbor together with the Berkshire No. 7 and Priscilla Dailey, two other barges. In the spring of 1974, one of the barges began to take on water, dragging down the other two. No part of the barge is visible above water. Elmer S. Dailey is listed in the U.S. Registry as #166315.  Importance  The Elmer S. Dailey is historically significant because it is the only known surviving Erie Canal boat and is one of a few remaining wooden-hulled canal boats. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978. It and the other two barges that sank with it are the only shipwrecks in Connecticut listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1998, the historic status of the barges was a concern for the Port Authority of Bridgeport Harbor, as the sunken ships interfered with a billion- dollar redevelopment project. Over the years, the barges had deteriorated so that an operation to salvage them would likely result in it breaking apart. No action had been taken by 2003, but a report noted that prior to any activity of the Elmer S. Dailey the Federal Transit Administration and/or the City of Bridgeport should document the barge with photos and a technical description. Specifics regarding the documentation based on the activity would be archived at the State Historic Preservation Office and the Mystic Seaport Museum. See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Bridgeport, Connecticut  Notes  The New York Times article notes that the barges sank in 1974, but inaccurately states that the ships were placed on the National Register of Historic Places \\"shortly before they went down\\". The Elmer S. Daileys nomination form was produced in February 1978 and it was added on December 21, 1978. Another document relating to the Intermodal Transportation Center erroneously states the Elmer S. Dailey National Register of Historic Places listing date and that it sank because of Hurricane Gloria in 1985.

J. Wilkes, 1992, , p. 86, \\"...including the names of Dardanian rulers, Longarus, Bato, Monunius and Etuta, and those on later epitaphs, Epicadus, Scerviaedus, Tuta, Times and Cinna.

She began the Siege of Issa the same year and sent a large fleet into the Adriatic, which attacked Epidamnus, Corcyra and Apollonia in spring 229 BC. The battle The Illyrians landed at the port of Epidamnus in spring 229 BC, with the pretext of collecting food and water. The Greeks were careless and allowed the Illyrians to enter, with the latter concealing swords to prepare for an assault. They killed the guards of the gate tower and quickly took part of much of the walls of Epidamnus. Eventually, the citizens formed a resistance and pushed the Illyrians outside of the city. The Illyrians then left Epidamnus and joined other Illyrians who were heading southwards towards Corcyra. Assistance Following this attack, the cities of Epidamnus, Apollonia and Corcyra requested assistance from the Acheaen and Aetolian leagues to protect them from Illyrian attacks. The leagues agreed to help, and sent a fleet of ten ships to lift the siege of Corcyra, which the Illyrians had already begun. However, the Greeks were defeated at sea off the coast of Paxus and the Illyrians shortly afterwards captured Corcyra. With this victory, the Illyrians sailed back north towards Epidamnus, and prepared for a second attack. The Siege Upon arriving from Corcyra, the Illyrians began the Siege of Epidamnus in 229 BC. However, following Roman intervention after the breakout of the First Illyrian War, a large Roman army and fleet approached Illyria. After several victories, resulting in the capture of Corcyra and territories of the southern Illyrian tribes, the Romans approached Epidamnus in 229 BC.

It includes songs, legends, jokes, rhymes, proverbs, weather lore, superstitions, and practices such as traditional food-making and craft-making. The largest bodies of folklore in Canada belong to the aboriginal and French- Canadian cultures. English-Canadian folklore and the folklore of recent immigrant groups have added to the country's folk. Indigenous folklore and mythology north of Mexico. The collection and study of Indigenous peoples mythology and folklore is done through language families. The classic definitions of folklore were created by Europeans such as William Thoms, who coined the term in 1846 to refer to \\"manners, customs [...] of the olden times\\". The study of folklore grew out of the European concept of folk, often understood to mean \\"common, uneducated people mostly in villages or rural communities\\". This definition falls short of capturing the formal aspect of many Indigenous traditions. Even 19th century folklorists collecting and attempting to translate Indigenous oral literature recognized the immense challenge of bridging the culture gap. Ethnographer Horatio Hale wrote in 1874 that creation myths and myths explaining the origin of sacred ceremonies, \\"were, in a certain sense, articles of religion and were handed down with scrupulous exactness.\\" As one Native chief explained, Among many Native cultures, \\"storytelling\\" was normally restricted to the long winter evenings. The Cree were one culture with a strict belief in this regard: \\"During the summer, no stories founded on fiction were ever told; the Indigenous peoples believing that if any 'fairy' tales were told during that season when they were supposed to use their time to best advantage, the narrator would have his life destroyed by the lizard, which would suck his blood.\\" Indigenous folklore and mythology are sometimes collected and studied according to language families, such as Algonquian, Athabaskan, Iroquoian, Kutenai, Salishan, Siouan, and others. Classification schemes for indigenous languages of the Americas can vary. Large language families can include Native cultures in geographically distant areas, for example, the Algonquian language family includes the M'igmaw of the modern-day Maritime provinces as well as the Odawa people of the Ottawa River region. =Themes and genres= Bill Reid's sculpture Raven and The First Men, showing part of a Haida creation myth. The Raven represents the Trickster figure common to many mythologies. The work is in the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia. Some broad themes can be identified in Indigenous Canadian mythology. Creation myths are among the most sacred to many Indigenous cultures. Haida myths of the Raven, a \\"celestial being\\", explain the creation of the sun. The Haida word for Raven means \\"the one who is going to order things\\", and it was Raven who established the laws of nature and was present when people were first created. One creation myth from the Northeastern Woodlands tribes describes the creation of North America, or Turtle Island, by Muskrat and Turtle. Myths about the origins of landscape features, such as mountains and rivers, are common in several Indigenous peoples oral traditions. Supernatural beings are prominent in many myths about the origin of places, animals, and other natural phenomena. Nanabozho is the \\"trickster\\" spirit and hero of Ojibwa mythology (part of the larger body of Anishinaabe traditional beliefs). Glooscap, a giant gifted with supernatural powers, is the hero and \\"transformer\\" of the mythology of the Wabanaki peoples. Supernatural experiences by ordinary mortals are found in other myths. For example, the Chippewa have myths explaining the first corn and the first robin, triggered by a boy's vision. Some myths explain the origins of sacred rituals or objects, such as sweat lodges, wampum, and the sun dance. Cryptids, or mythical beasts, exist in some Native folklore. Bigfoot, or Sasquatch, the Wendigo, and Ogopogo are popular examples. French-Canadian folklore French-Canadian folklore has its roots in the folklore of France, with some stock characters such as Ti-Jean, the everyman character. Other popular heroes of French-Canadian folklore were created in New France, such as the exploits of the hunter Dalbec, and the voyageur Jean Cadieux. The earliest French-Canadian folksong celebrates the adventures of Jean Cadieux. La chasse-galerie (The Flying Canoe), a popular French-Canadian folktale. The coureur des bois/voyageurs were featured in the folklore of Quebec. Loup-garou (werewolves) and shape-shifting sorcerers turning into animals such as owls or bears \\"to torture their enemies\\" are widespread in French-Canadian legends. The presence of demons and priests in many French-Canadian legends attests to the dominant presence of the Catholic church and its rituals in everyday life in New France and Acadia. The folklore of the coureur des bois and voyageurs has been much studied, particularly the chansons (songs) they created to help them paddle in unison when canoeing and to build morale. Folksongs and tall tales were part of the festivities at the veill√©es (evening gatherings) held in habitant communities. The folklore of French Canada includes some rituals associated with Church holidays. The Temps des f√™tes (Candlemas) was long celebrated at the end of the Christmas season in both Quebec and in Acadian communities. Food was central to the celebration. It was traditional to use up the remains of the year's wheat harvest by making crepes or donuts. The round, golden shapes alluded to the sun, the coming of Spring, and the full circle of the annual harvest cycle. A recent folk tradition that adapts a custom from France is the Tintamarre parade of Acadia, similar to France's Medieval Charivari festivities. English-Canadian folklore Early English-Canadian folklore has several points of origin, due to the various settler groups that came to the country from England, Scotland, Ireland, and as Loyalists following the American Revolutionary War. Each group brought their own traditions and created new folklore in their new homeland. In the generations since the early settlers, waves of immigrants have come to Canada from around the world, adding their own folklore to the country's mix. Oral traditions in Canada mainly have a regional or community-based identity. This has been influenced by Canada's vast geography and early settlement patterns. Folklorists have often focused on specific regional or ethnic communities, as with Helen Creighton's work recording and documenting Nova Scotia sea-songs and ballads, or the many studies of the folklore of Newfoundland. =Atlantic provinces= The Big Fiddle of the Ceilidh in Sydney, Nova Scotia. Canadian fiddle is a recognizable part of Maritime culture. The music and folklore of Newfoundland's people are influenced by their ancestors, settlers who mainly came from south east Ireland (County Wexford, County Cork) and England (Dorset, Devon). The folk stories of Newfoundland can sometimes be traced back to Ireland and Great Britain, as with the stock character Jack. The retelling of these stories over generations in the isolated Newfoundland outports of the island gave them a \\"distinctive Newfoundland flavour\\". As elsewhere where Jack stories are told, the Jack of Newfoundland lore is \\"lazy or mischievous, but he is nearly always resourceful when faced with adversity\\", as when he confronts giants or ghosts. Local folk music and Irish folk music remain popular in Newfoundland, as well as throughout the Maritime provinces, where Canadian fiddle music is a recognizable part of the regional culture. Ghost stories figure prominently in the folklore of the Atlantic provinces. One example is the story of the Dungarvon Whooper, a tale involving a logger from the Dungarvon River near Miramichi, New Brunswick in the 1860s. According to the legend, the logger murdered a camp cook for his money. It has been claimed that eerie screams and howls have been heard in the woods near the Dungarvon River ever since. =Central Canada= Some popular folklore in Canada involves lore connected with actual historical people, such as the \\"Black Donnellys\\", a family from Lucan, Ontario. The family was at the centre of allegations of a crime spree, that ended with a massacre at the hands of a mob. Thomas P. Kelly wrote a popular book on the Black Donnellys in the 1950s, and the story of the family has been retold and fictionalized ever since. A wooden statue of folk hero Big Joe Mufferaw in Mattawa, Ontario. Mufferaw was based on the exploits of lumberjack Joseph Montferrand. Lumberjack heroes are one genre of Canadian folklore that spread throughout the Great Lakes region. The lumberjack tall tales, some of which later became popular as Paul Bunyan tales, often had French-Canadian origins, but were hugely popular among the itinerant lumberjacks of Ontario and the northern United States as well. Ottawa Valley storytellers transformed a real historical figure, the Quebec lumberjack Joseph Montferrand, into \\"Joe Muffreau\\" or \\"Big Joe Mufferaw\\". Other lumberjack heroes include Julius Neville, Louis Cyr, and Napoleon La Rue. The influence of the lumber industry had also permeated into English- Canadian folk music, with the log driving being the focus of The Log Driver's Waltz. =Canadian Prairies= Among the later immigrant groups to Canada, the folklore of settlers in the western Canadian Prairies has been much studied. Folklore traditions brought from Central and Eastern Europe have survived in Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Doukhobor, Mennonite, and other communities of the region. =Northern Canada= Folk tales about the adventurers in northern Canada (particularly about the Yukon's Klondike Gold Rush era) provide more examples of folk heroes based on real historical people. These include the stories told about Sam Steele and \\"Klondike Kate\\" (Kathleen Rockwell). Verse ballads by poet Robert Service told tall tales about colourful Klondike characters, such as The Cremation of Sam McGee and The Shooting of Dan McGrew. The poems were partly based on real events and people, but through popular repetition grew into folklore.

Though today it is a land-based organization, the organization operated a succession of vessels which frequently cruised New York Harbor and nearby waterways, giving indigent children and their caregivers a respite from overcrowded tenements. While they were aboard, the Floating Hospital's staff of pediatricians, dentists, nurses, and social workers would provide healthcare services to children and health and nutrition education to their caregivers. Despite its name, the organization does not operate a hospital in the usual sense. It has functioned as an outpatient facility from its earliest days, though it was affiliated with an acute care hospital prior to World War II. Presently, it is not affiliated with any other organization. The Floating Hospital for Children in Boston, founded in 1894, was inspired by the Floating Hospital in New York but was always a separate organization. It became a land-based acute care hospital in the 1930s and later merged with Tufts Medical Center. History =Founding= The Floating Hospital traces its origins to October 1866 as a series of charitable excursions first conducted by steamboat tycoon John Starin for the benefit of newsboys, war veterans, and the needy. In the summer of 1872, George F. Williams, a managing editor of the New York Times, witnessed a policeman forcing a group of newsboys in City Hall Park off the grass and onto the concrete walkways, which burned their feet. When Williams returned to his office the next day, he wrote an appeal to the Times' readership for money to charter a boat trip for the city's newsboys and bootblacks, so that they could be turned loose on grassy shores of nearby waterways. The next year, Williams asked the St. John's Guild to take over the organization of the trips, which had become more regular. The Guild was founded in 1866 as a charitable affiliate of St. John's Chapel of the Episcopal parish of Trinity Church. In 1875, the guild purchased and outfitted its first vessel, which was named for Emma Abbott, a famous singer and early benefactor. Two years later the guild severed its connections with the Episcopal Church and became non-sectarian. The hospital was officially \\"The Floating Hospital of the St. John's Guild\\" until 1980, when the guild was dissolved and the hospital was reincorporated as a wholly independent entity. =Early years= In subsequent decades the Floating Hospital served over 5 million children and their caregivers, through their program of regular outings on their vessels (which were apparently daily, at least in warmer months). Besides a strong recreational component, these outings also were seen as being medically important, because children were exposed to clean air and salt water, which were seen as curative by many people in that era, and also because while on-board they would be examined and treated by medical professionals. At the same time, other staff members could instruct caregivers in good child-rearing practices. A 1903 article in a nursing journal provides a sketch of the activities aboard the ship during these outings: =Seaside Hospital= The Seaside Hospital mentioned in the quotation above was also run by the St. John's Guild and was a frequent destination of Floating Hospital trips. It was located on ten acres on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean in New Dorp, Staten Island, and was founded in 1881 and greatly expanded in 1899. The sickest children were transferred from the Floating Hospital to Seaside Hospital, where they were cared for by doctors and nurses and where their mothers were also accommodated. Seaside Hospital was converted into a military hospital during World War II and demolished in the 1960s. =Later years= The Floating Hospital continued the basic formula of attracting families with recreational opportunities on board their vessel and providing professional medical services to them while they were aboard through the late 20th century. By the 1970s, the hospital described itself as \\"basically a disease prevention and referral agency\\" that focused on education, though it also provided outpatient services on its vessel, both during outings in summer months and while moored at its regular berth in the South Street Seaport during the winter. The hospital's regular berth moved several times in its later years. After using a Hudson River pier near 44th Street in the 1980s, for much of the 1990s it bounced between two piers in the East River: Pier 11 at the foot of Wall Street and Pier 17 at the foot of Fulton Street. It was moored at Pier 11 in 2001 at the time of the September 11 attacks, which leveled the World Trade Center a short distance away. Though undamaged, the Floating Hospital would never again find a suitable mooring site. Pier 11 was needed for expanded ferry service to Lower Manhattan, and the management of Pier 17 was generally hostile to the presence of the vessel and its clients amid what they were promoting as an upscale retail venue. In 2002, a temporary move to Brooklyn became permanent when the Floating Hospital was barred from Pier 17 and could not find another suitable berth in New York City where their clients could safely board the ship. In 2003 the Hospital sold its vessel and became a land-based facility based in Chinatown. Finally, in 2006 it moved to its present headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, an area designated at the time by the Federal government as medically underserved. Vessels The Floating Hospital owned 5 vessels over the 130 years that it provided marine-based services. Most of these were in fact engineless barges that were pulled around New York's waterways by tugboats. These were: * Emma Abbott, barge, 1872‚Äì? * Helen C. Juillard I, riverboat, 1899‚Äì1916 * Helen C. Juillard II, barge, 1916‚Äì1935 The second Helen C. Juillard was a wooden, non self propelled barge built from designs by Tams, Lemoine & Crane by the American Car and Foundry Company. The length on deck was , breadth of with a draft. The craft had four decks, the lower running from bow to stern just above the hull, two decks above termed the main deck and upper deck that were set back from the bow atop which was the hurricane deck with pilot house, an isolation ward, boats, ventilators and such other necessary structures. There was a waiting room, examination rooms, operating room and four wards. The dining room could seat 400 people. There were living quarters and separate facilities for medical staff and crew. A boiler provided steam for powering auxiliary equipment and electrical generation. Refrigeration facilities for food and fresh milk were installed. Tanks provided storage for of fresh water and of salt water for showering. Life saving equipment, boats, rafts and life preservers were provided for a capacity of 1,600 people. A high capacity fire pump system with outlets throughout the vessel formed the fire fighting equipment. The barge was launched February 5, 1916, christened by the niece of the donor of the vessel, Mrs. A. D. Julliard. * Lloyd I.

It is mostly coterminous with the civil parishes of Inagh and Kilnamona that lie to the west of the county town of Ennis in the ancient barony of Inchiquin. The parish contains two churches and an oratory. Inagh-Kilnamona GAA club is situated in the eastern part of the parish. Location The parish covers an area of County Clare extending to the west of Ennis. Inagh is south-east of Ennistymon. An 1845 description said of the parish, \\"The surface is, for the most part, a series of moors, bogs, and poor uplands; and its aspect is almost everywhere bleak and repulsive. Slievecallan, on the western boundary, has an altitude of 1,282 feet; and some heights in the interior have altitudes of very nearly 500 feet. The chief stream is the Brockagh.\\" History and Antiquities Inagh and Kilnamona were originally separate parishes. By 1845 they were united, with chapels in both villages. =Inagh= The original church of Eidnach was said to have been built by Mac Creiche in his old age, around 580. The chapel at Inagh, called in Irish Teampul-duv-na-h‚ÄôEidhnighe, does not seem to have had a patron saint. A chapel dated from the 15th century. Fragments of the ‚ÄúTeampul na glas aighne‚Äù remained in 1839, but were later demolished. Before the present church of Inagh was built there was a long, low \\"mass house\\" in the townland of Knockahaurin. The floor was used for threshing during the harvest. The present church was built in 1842. Stones from the old mass house and slates from the Killaloe quarries were used for the walls, and the roof was thatched. The church was dedicated in 1869 by Bishop Power. The high altar was installed in 1895 and the Stations of the Cross in 1905. The stained glass window behind the altar dates to 1910. The church was renovated in 1932, with a new roof, floor and altar rails, and the holy water font taken from the ruins of the old chapel. =Kilnamona= The name \\"Kilnamona\\" means Church of the Bog. In the early Christian era, around 600 AD, the parish tribe was known as Cineal Baoith. Their patron saint was Saint Lachtain. He was from the Cork/Limerick area and it is assumed the tribe migrated from there. In 1603 the bronze arm of Saint Lachtain had to be removed to Kerry by a Franciscan for safe keeping. It is now preserved in the Royal Irish Academy. The old church of Kilnamona is now ruined, although as of 1839 its walls were well preserved. The church is . In the south wall, from the west gable, half of a pointed doorway remained. It was high and wide. The same wall held a semi-circular window with holes in the sides to hold cross iron bars. The east gable had a window about high and wide inside, tapering to high by wide on the outside. The walls are about feet high, thick and built of stones of different sizes in irregular courses. A large cemetery is attached to the old church of Kilnamona. There is a holy well named Tobar Lachtin a small distance to the south, which was believed to have the power to cure various ailments, The well is dedicated to Saint Lachtain, whose festival is held on 19 March. There is another holy well named Tobar-na-Taise (Well of the Relic) a little way to the southwest, coffin shaped. This was thought to have the power to restore the health of delicate children if they were laid on their back in the well. The present church of Kilnamona was built in the 19th century. Patrick Keane of Deniliquin, New South Wales, Australia, was born in Kilnamona in 1831. He donated the three paneled stained glass window depicting the Blessed Virgin, Sacred Heart and Saint Patrick, over the main altar in memory of his parents and siblings. In 2008 a sculpted bronze plaque was erected to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Brother Thomas Keane. Brother Keane was a native of Kilnamona who wrote (in his beloved Irish language) the first major textbook in Ireland for the new Higher Level Mathematics introduced into the Leaving Certificate Curriculum in the mid-1960s. Today The Catholic parish of Inagh and Kilnamona is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. The parish office is in the village of Inagh. Churches are the Immaculate Conception in Inagh, St Joseph's in Kilnamona and the Oratory of The Blessed Mary Ever Virgin in Cloonanaha. The parish is home to the Inagh Kilnamona GAA, a Gaelic Athletic Association club.

He is the first Eastern Catholic to hold the position. Biography Yoannis Lahzi Gaid was born in Cairo, Egypt, in 1975. He was one of seven siblings. He studied at the Coptic Catholic seminary in Cairo. He was ordained priest for Coptic Catholic Patriarchate of Alexandria, Egypt. He studied at the Pontifical Oriental Institute, earning a doctorate in the canon law of the Eastern Churches. He edited a volume of texts from the Code of Canon Law for the Eastern Churches. He worked for several years as associate pastor of the church of Santa Domitilla in Latina, south of Rome. He attended the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy and in 2007 joined the diplomatic service of the Holy See. His assignments included stints in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon, and as charge d‚Äôaffaires of the Apostolic Nunciatures to Jordan and Iraq. He also served as an Arabic translator for Pope Francis at his general audiences and in meetings with Arabic-speaking diplomats and government officials. On 1 July 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him a chaplain of His Holiness with the title monsignor. In April 2014 Pope Francis appointed him as his second personal secretary. He continues to work for the Secretariat of State as well. His appointment was interpreted as gesture of support for Eastern Catholic churches and dialog with the Arab and Muslim world. By the time he took on this position, he was already living in the same residence as Pope Francis, the Domus Sanctae Marthae. In rare public remarks for a papal secretary, he praised the development of dialog with Islam, saying that the meeting of Pope Francis and Ahmad al-Tayyib in Cairo in 2017 \\"gave proof that we can talk, we can talk, we can also love each other people of different religions. Before there was no dialogue, and therefore there was distance, there was also a bit of hostility towards one another. Now there is deep friendship.\\" After the same two leaders issued their Document on Human Fraternity in February 2019, Lahzi Gaid was named in September as one of the first members of a committee to promote its principles.

Here the grape is rarely used a varietal but, instead, is a permitted blending grape adding acidity to the wines of several Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) zones including the sparkling wine Prosecco and has also been used for vermouth production. The name Trevigiana is derived from the province of Treviso where the grape is believed to have originated from.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 102-103, 1130 Allen Lane 2012 While there are several grape varieties that variously share the synonym Bianchetta, most notably the Sicilian wine grape Albarola, DNA analysis has shown no direct genetic relationship between Bianchetta Trevigiana and any of the other Bianchetta varieties. Likewise, despite sharing the synonym Vernaccia (the root of which translate to \\"vernacular\\" or \\"local\\"Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 273 Harcourt Books 2001 ) with the notable Tuscan and Sardinian wine grapes, Biancheta Trevigiana appears to have no close relationship with any of those varieties. Instead, ampelographers believe that the grape is the result of a natural crossing between the white Veneto wine grape Durella and the nearly extinct red wine grape Brambana. History Durella, one of the probable parent varieties of Bianchetta Trevigiana. Ampelographers believe that first written account of Bianchetta Trevigiana was in the late 17th century under the synonym of Bianchetta Gentile. The name Bianchetta means \\"little white\\" with Gentile coming from the Latin term for \\"family\\" so this reference could be about several vines of \\"little white berries\\" that shared similar characteristics in the vineyard. The 1679 account from Italian writer Agostinetto di Cimadolmo described Bianchetta Gentile as growing in the Treviso region. The first detailed account of Bianchetta Trevigiana was in 1937 by grape-breeder Giovanni Dalmasso at the Istituto Sperimentale per la Viticoltura in Conegliano.Wein- Plus \\"Bianchetta Treviso\\" Glossary. Accessed: April 18th, 2014 In 2003, isoenzymatic analysis revealed that several grape varieties growing in northeast Italy under the synonyms of Senese, Vernanzina and Vernassina were, in fact, Bianchetta Trevigiana while other grape varieties variously known as Bianchetta, such as the Albarola grape of Sicily, were distinct and not closely related. In 2010, further DNA analysis suggested that Bianchetta Trevigiana was probably the result of a natural crossing between the white Durella grape of the Veneto region and the nearly extinct red-berried Brambana grape. Viticulture Bianchetta Trevigiana is a mid-ripening grape variety that is often harvested between late September and early October. Despite having very thick-skins, the grape is very susceptible to the viticultural hazard of powdery mildew and also has poor resistance to frost damage that may occur early in the growing season. Wine region Bianchetta Trevigiana is one of the grape varieties permitted to be used in the production of the sparkling wine Prosecco. In 2000, there were of Bianchetta Trevigiana, which represents a dramatic drop in cultivation from the 17th and 18th century when the grape was widely planted in the provinces of Belluno and Verona. Outside of the Veneto, the grape was also found in the Trentino-Alto Adige region where it was planted along the Adige river valley up to the city of Bolzano as well as in the Sugana Valley and Val Sacra. Bianchetta Trevigiana is permitted in several DOC regions including the Veneto DOCs of Colli di Conegliano, Montello e Colli Asolani and Prosecco in the province of Treviso, the Colli Euganei DOC in the province of Padova and the multi-regional Lugana DOC that includes parts of both Lombardy and the Veneto. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Bianchetta Trevigiana tends to produce \\"ordinary\\" and astringent wines which is why it is rarely seen as a varietal and is more often incorporated into blends. The grape also has a long history of being used in vermouth production. Synonyms Over the years, Bianchetta Trevigiana has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Bianca Gentile di Fonzaso, Bianchetta, Bianchetta Gentile, Bianchetta Semplice, Bianco Vernanzinaj, Cenese, Pavana bianca, Pignolo bianco, Senese (in Breganze), Uva Cinese, Vernaccia, Vernaccia di Verona, Vernaccia Trentina, Vernanzina (in the Berici Hills), Vernassina (in the Euganean Hills), Vernazza, Vernazza Trentina, Vernazzina, Weisser Vernatch and Weissvernatsch.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Bianchetta Trevigiana Accessed: April 18th, 2014 References White wine grape varieties ","title":"Bianchetta Trevigiana"},{"id":"42524364","text":"Ant√¥nio Moreira C√©sar (July 9, 1850 ‚Äì March 4, 1897) was a Brazilian army officer who fought on the side of the government forces in the Revolta da Armada, Federalist Riograndense Revolution and the War of Canudos.

C. Davar (24 April 1913 ‚Äì 9 November 1977) was a freedom fighter and associate of Jawaharlal Nehru who is remembered for his opposition to the partition of India, his work among the refugees from Pakistan and his championing the idea of a confederation of India and Pakistan.  Early life and education  Davar began his political career as a revolutionary during his school and college before joining the Indian National Congress. He was a successful homoeopathic doctor who gave up his medical career on the advice of Subhash Chandra Bose following in the paths of Motilal Nehru and C. R. Das who had renounced lucrative legal careers for their participation in the freedom struggle. Davar however treated many prominent participants in the freedom struggle including Madan Mohan Malaviya, Rajendra Prasad and Fazlul Haque. He played a key role in getting the Central Assembly to recognise homoeopathy, a resolution that was later adopted by the Government of India.  Role in the freedom struggle  Davar joined the Indian National Congress after witnessing its annual session at Lahore in 1929 where Jawaharlal Nehru succeeded his father Motilal to the presidency of the Congress. In April 1930 he was arrested for his participation in the Salt Satyagraha. Davar is remembered for his staunch opposition to the proposal for the Partition of India. To prevent this and to bridge the divide between the Congress and the Muslim League, he formed the United Party of India of which he served as secretary general and which had among its members the ex-Premier of Bengal A. K. Fazlal Haque, Sir Syed Sultan Ahmed and Mahatma Bhagwan Din. Despite his efforts, India was partitioned for which he blamed the British bureaucracy.  Life in independent India  Davar headed the All-India Refugee Convention and was a member of the High Power Committee on Refugee Rehabilitation in which roles he worked for the rehabilitation of refugees from Pakistan in Haryana and Delhi where refugee colonies such as Rajendra Nagar and Lajpat Nagar were established. Davar was an advocate of peace between India and Pakistan, leading a goodwill mission to Pakistan in 1955 and advocating a no war pact between the two nations as president of the council of Indo-Pakistan affairs. His proposal for a confederation with Pakistan, made in 1956, was endorsed by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Following the birth of Bangladesh in 1971, Davar expanded the proposal for the confederation to include that country as well. Although a supporter of close ties between India and China, he became a bitter critic of China after the Indo-China War of 1962 during which he made an appeal to every family to donate 'one man and one tola gold' to defeat the Chinese forces. Throughout his career Davar was a supporter of Jawaharlal Nehru, campaigning for him at Phulpur in the General elections of 1952, 1957 and 1962 and later campaigning for Vijayalakshmi Pandit in the by-election of 1964 necessitated by Nehru's demise. Following Nehru's death, Davar advocated the establishment of a Nehru Peace Foundation to promote disarmament and universal peace. He contested against Zakir Hussain in the Presidential Election of 1967 but failed to win any votes. Davar was President, Mandal Organisation in the All India Congress Committee. In 1954 he opposed the linguistic reorganisation of India and in the '60s, sided against Morarji Desai in the succession contests following the deaths of Prime Ministers Nehru and Shastri.  Death and commemoration  Davar died in 1977 at the age of 65. His death was condoled by several leaders including Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and I. K. Gujral. Dr. M. C.

He began his professional career with Birmingham, but never represented that club in competitive first-team football, and also played non- league football for Poole and Worcester City. Life and career Strang was born in Rutherglen. He was playing for a junior club in Glasgow when English First Division club Birmingham beat off competition to sign him in September 1923. He never appeared for Birmingham's first team, and was allowed to leave the club on a free transfer the following May for Third Division South team Crystal Palace. Described in the Derby Daily Telegraph as a \\"lean and lanky\\" centre-half with competence in both the defensive and the creative aspects of his role ‚Äì \\"a rare breaker-up and knows a thing or two about feeding his forwards\\" ‚Äì Strang had progressed well with Palace and become a regular in the team when, in October 1925, he and forward Bill Hand were charged with breach of contract in respect of training requirements and given two weeks' notice to leave the club. He initially signed for Poole of the Western League, then moved into the Birmingham & District League with Worcester City. He scored once in league competition, and also scored the winning goal in the semi-final of the 1927 Worcestershire Senior Cup against Stourbridge; Worcester lost to Cradley Heath in the final after a replay. Strang returned to the Football League with Halifax Town of the Third Division North in 1929. He played 99 league matches over three seasons, and his \\"heroic\\" performance in an FA Cup tie in 1931 made a major contribution to the struggling club's survival. In those days, progress in the FA Cup provided a significant income stream, and in 1931, the club was on the verge of financial failure. Drawn away to Newark Town in the first round, Halifax conceded an early goal, but after Newark lost a man to injury, they equalised by half- time. The second half was a rearguard action as Halifax clung on to the draw, and then won the replay and their second-round tie before losing in the third round: His services were not retained at the end of the 1931‚Äì32 season, and he and Halifax teammate John McFarlane moved on to Northampton Town. Strang was little used in Northampton's first team, and in the summer of 1933, he joined Darlington, for whom he played 171 matches in the Third Division North before finishing his senior career in 1938.

Newell, is a wooden canal boat constructed in 1929 in Whitehall, New York. The barge was used to transport bulk cargo in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut harbors. It sank in 1974 along with the Elmer S. Dailey and the Berkshire No. 7 in the harbor of Bridgeport, Connecticut on the west side of the Pequonnock River. The sunken boat has deteriorated to the point that a salvage operation could result in it breaking apart. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978. Description The barge measures long with a beam. The depth of the hold is listed at and it had a listed capacity of 311 tons. Clouette describes the Priscilla Dailey as having a \\"nearly rectangular hull in profile, section and plan, with squared-off stern and bluntly rounded bow. Low bulwarks with scuppers rise slightly to a peak where they join the prominently projecting stem. There are several raised strakes in the bow. The superstructure consists mainly of a single low coaming which extends nearly the length of the vessel\\". Toward the stern is a small cabin that has the same width and height of the coaming. In 1978, the National Register of Historic Places nomination noted that the convex hatch covers likely floated away and that the squarish hood over the companionway had washed away.  History  The wooden canal boat Priscilla Dailey was originally known as Elizabeth E. Newell until it was purchased by Stewart J. Dailey in 1941. It was constructed in 1929 in Whitehall, New York, by William J. Ryan for Anthony O. Boyle. The ship was built 24 years after the Champlain Canal's enlargement, but more closely resembles the specifications of the 19th-century canal boats. It was used to transport materials in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut harbors between 1941 and 1972, and afterward was moored in the harbor of Bridgeport, Connecticut together with the Elmer S. Dailey and Berkshire No. 7. In the spring of 1974, one of the barges began to take on water, dragging down the other two. At neap tide, one-third of the hull of the Priscilla Dailey is visible above water. Priscilla Dailey is listed in the U.S. Registry as #170368.  Importance  The Priscilla Dailey is historically significant because it is one of the few surviving wooden canal boats and is \\"a rare and representative artifact of canal transportation\\". Its design is characteristic of its 19th-century predecessors despite being a 20th-century vessel. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978. Its nomination and listing is unusual because it was not yet 50 years old at the time of its nomination, and it sunk in 1974. It and the other two barges that sank with it are the only shipwrecks in Connecticut listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1998, the historic status of the barges was a concern for the Port Authority of Bridgeport Harbor, as the sunken ships interfered with a billion-dollar redevelopment project. Over the years, the barges had deteriorated so that an operation to salvage them would likely result in them breaking apart. No action had been taken by 2003, but a report noted that prior to any activity of the Priscilla Dailey, the Federal Transit Administration and/or the City of Bridgeport would document the barge with photos and a technical description. Specifics regarding the documentation based on the activity would be archived at the State Historic Preservation Office and the Mystic Seaport Museum. See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Bridgeport, Connecticut  Notes  The New York Times article notes that the barges sank in 1974, but inaccurately says that the ships were placed on the National Register of Historic Places \\"shortly before they went down\\". The Berkshire No.7s nomination form was produced in May 1978 and it was added on December 21, 1978. Another document relating to the Intermodal Transportation Center erroneously states the Priscilla Dailey National Register of Historic Places listing date and that it sunk because of Hurricane Gloria in 1985.

Biography Fritz Kahn was born in Halle an der Saale, Germany, the son of Arthur Kahn, a physician and author, and Hedwig Kahn, n√©e Schmuhl. His father emigrated to the USA shortly after his birth, settling in Hoboken, New Jersey. Around 1893, after establishing his practise, he sent for his wife and son, and Fritz Kahn started school there. The family later moved to Manhattan, but in 1895 his mother returned to Germany with her three children. They spent time in Hamburg and again in Halle before moving to Bonn with Arthur Kahn after his return from the US, then finally in 1905 moved to Berlin, where Kahn took his Abitur at the Sophiengymnasium; he also served as an instructor in classes for workers. Kahn studied medicine at the University of Berlin beginning in 1907, passing the state examination to become an M.D. in 1912/13. His studies focused on microbiology, but he also studied a variety of scientific and philosophical subjects, worked at an institute of meteorology, and wrote articles for the popular science magazine Kosmos. Around 1930 he went on geological expeditions to Palestine and the Polar circle. In 1932, after suffering from pneumonia for a month, he traveled to the Sahara to study the desert. In 1933, antisemitic propaganda caused him to close his medical practice and his books were publicly burned. He immigrated to Palestine with his family, settling first in Haifa, then in Jerusalem. He wrote newspaper articles on contemporary issues and in 1934 exhibited in Jerusalem on The Hygiene of the School Child. He divorced his wife and in 1937 married Erna Schnabel, cousin of pianist Artur Schnabel and a singer and music teacher, after which he moved to Paris. After the outbreak of World War II, he fled to Bordeaux. In 1940 he was interned by the French as an enemy alien. His wife secured his release and the couple fled to Spain and Portugal. He was one of the Jewish refugees assisted by the US agent Varian Fry;\\"Dreaming the Industrial Body: Fritz Kahn's Modernist Physiology\\", History of Medicine Division, United States National Library of Medicine. in early 1941, with the help of Albert Einstein, they were able to emigrate to the USA,\\"Im Inneren der Menschmaschine\\", Einestages, Der Spiegel, 8 October 2010 where they settled in Manhattan. After the war, Kahn spent several long periods in Europe between 1948 and 1950, among other places in Ascona, but when it seemed unlikely he would soon be able to return there permanently, he once more settled in New York. He had a house in Atlantic Beach, Long IslandOn Erie Avenue and a studio in Manhattan. After his wife left him, he lived with Ellen Fussing, a Danish-American colleague, with whom he finally returned to Europe. Until 1960 they lived primarily in Switzerland, among other places in Lugano. In 1960, on vacation in Agadir, he survived a serious earthquake unharmed--in a sarcophagus. He was evacuated to Denmark with Fussing, settled in North Zealand, and in 1962 opened a studio in Copenhagen.Kahn traveled to Ascona in fall 1967 for health reasons; on 14 January 1968, he died in a clinic in Locarno. Medical career From 1914 to 1922 he worked as a surgeon, gynecologist, and obstetrical aide at a clinic. In World War I he served as a medic, among other postings in Alsace, the Vosges, and Northern Italy. In 1918 he was invalided out on grounds of undernourishment and overwork and was cared for by an Italian farming family. After the war ended, he went to Algeria to recuperate. After returning to Berlin and resuming practice as a physician, he married Irma Glogau in 1920. Around 1921 he traveled to Palestine, where he bought land on Mount Carmel and in Jerusalem. In 1922, he opened a private practise as a gynecologist. In 1926 he advised on Jewish health for the GeSoLei exhibition on health, social welfare, and exercise in D√ºsseldorf and was one of the organizers of the Berlin exhibition on nutrition. Literary career Comparison of force transmission in a car and the outer ear (from the Arthur and Fritz Kahn Collection) In late 1938, shortly after Kristallnacht, Kahn's books were placed on the list of \\"damaging and undesirable writing\\" and in addition his book on sexuality, Unser Geschlechtsleben, was banned by the police and all available copies destroyed. His illustrations were used in works by , a Nazi-endorsed medical writer. Through the use of often startling metaphors, both verbal and visual, Kahn succeeded in making complex principles of nature and technology comprehensible to a person of average education.Hans- Joachim M√ºller, \\"Die ganze Welt passt in ein Schaubild\\", Feuilleton, Die Welt, 8 October 2013 For example, he compared the ear to an automobile. Some of his images foretell the future: for example the \\"physician of the future\\" \\"remotely monitoring his patient's health from his desktop with the aid of various applets\\". Many are simply \\"arresting because [they are] drastically extreme visualizations\\": for example, \\"In 70 Jahren isst der Mensch 1400-mal sein Gewicht\\" (In 70 years a person will eat 1,400 times his weight) - which includes 40,000 cigars. Some of his drawings are inaccurate; when a friend pointed out one error, he responded: \\"Na ja, falsch ist es schon, aber verst√§ndlich!\\" (\\"Yup, it's wrong, but it's understandable!\\") His series Das Leben des Menschen (Human Life) was a best-seller. He continued to publish in exile and was included in Who's Who in the USA in the mid-1950s, but in Germany he was largely forgotten after the banning of his books. Kahn described the human body as \\"the most competent machine in the world\\", and his work reflects the technical and cultural state of development of Germany during the Weimar Republic. He himself did not draw well; the illustrations were made by others on his instructions. In Berlin, New York, and Copenhagen, he established studios for this purpose. His analogies between humans and machines have been interpreted by some artists, including Herbert Bayer and Eduardo Paolozzi. His graphics have also inspired some modern work, such as a trailer for the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and the ad for the music program Vamos Falar de M√∫sica on MTV Brasil. In 2009 the designer Henning Lederer animated Kahn's \\"Der Mensch als Industriepalast\\" (Man as Industrial Palace) as part of a final student project,\\"Der Mensch als Industriepalast\\".Henning M.

After seeing the success of other cotton mills in the Northeast and locally in Durham, entrepreneur Benjamin N. Duke incorporated the mill in 1892 and recruited William H. Erwin to manage the enterprise. The mill's success in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was the result of Erwin's and his successors‚Äô exceptional management tactics, even when the factory hit obstacles such as the Great Depression and the unionization of its workers. The mill grew quickly in the late 19th century and early 20th century, became one of North Carolina's largest cotton mills.Catherine Bishir and Michael Southern, A Guide to the Historic Architecture of Piedmont North Carolina (The University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 208. It originally produced muslin pouches for tobacco, but the mill would later expand its production to other fabrics, becoming one of the largest producers of denim in the world during the early 1900s. Workers at the mill enjoyed some of the best working conditions and highest wages in textile factories throughout the southern United States. Mill employees would later sign union-friendly labor agreements that were radical to the southern textile industry in the early to mid 20th century.‚ÄúA Statement by the Erwin Mills,‚Äù Erwin Mills Cotton Company, 1945. The establishment of homes, businesses and recreation areas in the mill village was a significant factor in the development of the West Durham, especially the Ninth Street business district and the Old West Durham Neighborhood. Erwin Mill No. 1 is on the National Register of Historic Places and the mill village of West Durham is a National Historic District. An apartment complex, office building and shopping center of the same name that are built on the original site also commemorate the factory.  Background  The idea of the Erwin Mill was rooted in the successful textile industry in New England and the Northeast. In the early 1800s, industrialists such as Samuel Slater brought the ideas behind cotton-spinning machines to the United States from England, which allowed the production of textiles on a mass scale.John Newman and John Schmalbach, United States History (Amsco School Publications Inc., 2010), 185. Even though northern cities such as Lowell, Massachusetts were home to the first large textile mills in the 1830s, industrialization and large textile mills reached Southern cities after the Civil War. In the post-war South, subsistence agriculture and the plantation system yielded to more commercialized agriculture, which required less manpower, freeing labor to work in the mills. Many subsistence and yeoman farming families who faced hard times flocked to urban centers in search of work.Jacquelyn Hall, James Leloudis, Robert Korstead, Mary Murphy, Lu Ann Jones, Christopher Daly, Like A Family: The Making of a Southern Cotton Mill World (The University of North Carolina Press, 1987), 31 The construction of complex railroad networks happened simultaneously to the growth of southern cities, making them prime candidates to become centers of industrialization.Jacquelyn Hall, James Leloudis, Robert Korstead, Mary Murphy, Lu Ann Jones, Christopher Daly, Like A Family: The Making of a Southern Cotton Mill World (The University of North Carolina Press, 1987), 24 The growth of cities and infrastructure in the South allowed entrepreneurs open large factories, which took advantage of cheap labor that was rarely under the influence of a union. Many opened textile factories to manufacture the cotton crop that the Southern states had produced for years. By the turn of the century, much of the textile industry had shifted from the Northeastern United States to the South. In 1900, there were 177 mills in North Carolina alone.Jacquelyn Hall, James Leloudis, Robert Korstead, Mary Murphy, Lu Ann Jones, Christopher Daly, Like A Family: The Making of a Southern Cotton Mill World (The University of North Carolina Press, 1987), 26 The industry reached Durham in the 1880s, when Durham businessman Julian Carr opened the Durham Cotton Manufacturing Company to manufacture cloth bags for tobacco.Catherine Bishir and Michael Southern, A Guide to the Historic Architecture of Piedmont North Carolina (The University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 201. The mill's early success confirmed that a textile mill located in Durham or the surrounding area could be successful.  Beginnings  The Duke family, which had been successful in starting the American Tobacco Company, looked to diversify their interests beyond the tobacco industry and raised $125,000 of start-up funds to build the factory. Benjamin Duke wanted to build the mill in North Carolina, offering that the central part of the state was ‚Äúthe most healthful locality in the South.‚ÄùRobert J Durden, The Dukes of Durham 1865-1929 (Duke University Press, 1975), 131. Duke elected to construct the mills in West Durham, North Carolina, at the modern intersection of Main and Ninth Streets. Duke was traveling when his lawyers inquired about a name for the mills, so without any way to immediately contact Duke, the lawyers declared the mills to be named after the manager Duke had appointed to be in charge of the plant, William H. Erwin.William Kenneth Boyd, The Story of Durham: City of the New South (Duke University Press, 1925), 122 In 1892, construction began on Mill No.1. Erwin Cotton Mills showcased its success when it made a profit soon after it opened, even during a recession in 1893. In fact, the mill was so successful in its first few years of operation that production expanded to include denims. In 1896, the mill became one of the state's largest textile mills, employing 1,000 workers and doubling its production in just four years.William Kenneth Boyd, The Story of Durham: City of the New South (Duke University Press, 1925), 123  Growth  = Early years = Erwin continued to diversify the mill's production and found new buyers across the world for the factory's finished products. The mill expanded its production to include sheets, muslins and denim, among other goods.Erwin Mills Cotton Co., The Erwin Story, (Erwin Cotton Mills Co., n.d.) Because the mill was producing more finished products, capital gains increased to more than seven million dollars of stock. With his operation and profits growing rapidly, Erwin decided to open additional mills, in Erwin, North Carolina and Cooleemee, North Carolina in 1902 and 1905. = Market expansion = At the beginning of the 20th century the mill faced growing pains and was forced to change its selling strategies and the way it handled its relations with employees to succeed. Although the market price of textiles rose in the early 1900s, demand was not as strong as it had been during the mill's infant years, but Duke and Erwin worked tirelessly to find buyers overseas, especially in Asia.Robert J Durden, The Dukes of Durham 1865-1929 (Duke University Press, 1975), 139-140. Erwin and Duke worked together with the British-American Tobacco Company to break into the Asian market, however Erwin reported that the mill still was having ‚Äústrenuous times.‚Äù It is possible that the denims the mill sent to China were the first to reach the country, which had practiced isolationism for much of the 1800s.Robert J Durden, The Dukes of Durham 1865-1929 (Duke University Press, 1975), 142. One of the reasons why the mill was so successful in its early years was because it employed poor workers in the post-war south who worked for extremely low wages in the recession years of the 1890s. Most men earned a maximum of $2.50 per day, while women and children earned even less. This helped the mill keep costs down and profits up, even while production increased. But, at the turn of the century, when the country emerged from the Panic of 1893, workers began to expect higher pay and fewer hours. Thus, Erwin and his management team decided to change conditions at the factory in order to create a better atmosphere for current and future employees. For example, Erwin Mills gave its employees a 40-hour workweek, which decreased the number of hours worked per week by almost 35 percent. Favorable economic conditions during the 1910s allowed the mill to have its most successful decade since its inception. Stock rose to more than $150 a share and Erwin wrote to Duke in 1913 that he was aspiring to reach a profit of $2,000,000 that year.Robert J Durden, The Dukes of Durham 1865-1929 (Duke University Press, 1975), 144-145. Duke was so pleased with Erwin's management that he authorized Erwin's salary to be increased by $5,000 the same year. Economists and entrepreneurs from all over the United States recognized the mill's renowned prosperity. Economist Frederick L. Baily said, ‚Äúof all the mills in the south, the Erwin Cotton Mills Company has a place entirely by itself.‚ÄùRobert J Durden, The Dukes of Durham 1865-1929 (Duke University Press, 1975), 144-145. Combined with the mills in Erwin and Coleemee, Erwin's Durham operation had become a major textile producer in North Carolina and the southern United States. = Physical expansion = A second mill was constructed at the West Durham plant in 1925, which expanded and deepened Erwin Mills‚Äô impact and presence in Durham. Durham leaders wanted to prevent West Durham from incorporating into its own city, to leave open the possibility expanding city limits to include prosperous mill town. However, Erwin wanted West Durham to maintain its hegemony as its own village, separate from the city of Durham. When Durham leaders and Erwin came to an agreement that allowed West Durham to remain an independent mill village, Erwin began construction of a second mill. The 35,000 square foot mill cost $2,500,000 to build and had 35,000 spindles and 1,200 looms.‚ÄúNew Cotton Mill,‚Äù The Wall Street Journal, October 6, 1923. The mill was named Mill No. 4 because two other mills were already operating outside of Durham County. = Great Depression and World War II = Although the plant's growth was staggered in the mid-20th century, the management of Erwin Mills continued profit and expand, even through the Great Depression. The mill was largely unaffected compared to other businesses in the country because of an established system that had produced a consistent profit prior to the Great Depression. The mill did not do particularly well when the country faced hard times from 1929-1938, but thousands of workers kept their jobs and were paid at least 25 cents an hour. Erwin became ill and died in 1932 and was succeeded by KP Lewis. Lewis steered the mill through the Depression and the looming threat of unionization, without damaging the mill's profitability. Some reports indicate that 1938 was the final year that the mills had an annual loss until 1975.Richard C. Franck, ‚ÄúOral History of West Durham,‚Äù Duke University Libraries, 1975 Lewis oversaw the acquisition of other mills in the south that were brought under the Erwin name, including mills in Stonewall, Mississippi and Wake County, North Carolina. World War II allowed the mill to fully emerge from the Depression, as it produced textiles in support of the war overseas and in return received government money for its products. However, the mill was losing control over the surrounding village. In the 1930s, it was incorporated into the city of Durham and in the early 1940s, Erwin Mills began selling the houses it had built north of the factory. This hinted at the mill's decline as other employers in the city grew, such as Watts Hospital and Duke University.  Effects on the development of West Durham  The mill did not only serve as a workplace for its employees, it also led the development of the surrounding land, which was used to house and entertain employees and their families. When textile mills opened in the South in the late 1800s and early 1900s, mill towns sprouted up around the growing textile mills. They were tight-knit communities made up of textile workers, their families and sometimes management.Drye, Willie, ‚ÄúIn U.S. South Textile Mills Gone, but Not Forgotten,‚Äù National Geographic, October 19, 2004. Mill village residents usually did not leave the area around the factory, because textile companies provided food, goods and other necessities. The village at Erwin Mill was no different. The company built houses alongside the mill in the early 1890s and by the end of the 19th century hundreds of workers lived in single-family homes around the mill. = Construction of the Mill Village = Erwin Mill No.1 and the mill village of West Durham in the 1910s. Historian William Kenneth Boyd attributes the rise of West Durham to the mill, as the village began to grow within the first few years of operation when there were 375 employees in late mid-1890s. This number grew proportionately when the number of employees at the plant rose in the 1900s. Erwin Mills constructed houses for its employees, which at one point included women and children. Housing needs continued to grow in the 20th century and additional houses were built in the area south of the mill that is now the Central Campus of Duke University.Ardash, Dave, ‚ÄúUncovering the Real Mill Village,‚Äù The Chronicle, April 16, 2013. E.K Powe, a manager of the mill, even purchased houses directly from Duke located along Yearby Avenue in the 1920s.E.K. Powe, Letter to A.C. Lee May 4, 1928, Rubenstein Library, Duke University Today, the neighborhoods to the west and north of the former mill are mainly residential, harboring the former homes of mill workers. = Company control of the mill = The mill village also provided entertainment, education and recreation to the workers and their families. The Erwin Auditorium was built in 1922 for performances and other events. A zoo and playground were built in the early 20th century to entertain the children of the mill workers after child labor was outlawed in 1913. A small library opened during the 1900s on the corner of Ninth and Main streets. Erwin also provided a limited education to mill employees and donated money a number of local charities. The company store, a staple of Southern cotton mills, provided residents with food, medicine and other basic goods. When mill workers died, most were buried in the nearby Cedar Hill Cemetery. Erwin's rule over the mill town earned him the name ‚ÄúPa Erwin,‚Äù as he was very involved in the lives of his workers. But, in addition to keeping a close eye on his workers, he encouraged them to follow his Christian views, supporting local churches to presumably increase their popularity among the mill's workers and banning alcohol in the mill village. Erwin and the mill's first employees formed the West Durham Episcopal Mission in 1894, but as the mill village grew, Erwin saw the need for an official Episcopalian church.Catherine Bishir and Michael Southern, A Guide to the Historic Architecture of Piedmont North Carolina (The University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 209. In 1908, Erwin funded the construction of a new church along Main Street that would become St. Joseph's Episcopal Church, which today is one of Durham's oldest Episcopalian congregations. He donated all proceeds that would have gone toward tobacco, alcohol and soft drinks to the church. Other area churches served workers who belonged to other denominations. Former worker Zeb Stone told Duke history student Richard C. Franck in 1975 that, ‚Äúeverything up here, just about, was run and controlled by the company.‚Äù The influx in population in West Durham led to the development of the Ninth Street business district, with stores such as McDonald's Drug store and lunch counter serving as a place of gathering for mill workers in the evenings. Eventually, the left side of the street opposite the mill was dotted with other shops and eateries. The addition of these services and amenities to the houses surrounding the mill transformed the village into a coherent community of workers and their families that was the foundation for what would become the Old West End neighborhood in Durham. When Erwin Mills began to sell houses to its workers and to the public, a new population of non-mill workers moved into the area, which diversified the Old West Durham neighborhood and allowed it to grow into its present state.  Working conditions  Working conditions at the mill improved with time, because of experienced management and federal worker's rights legislation. Erwin and Duke originally elected to operate the mill in the South even though most textile mills in the late 1800s were located in the Northeast, because labor in the post-war South was relatively cheap. Employees were originally paid 30 cents an hour, but that number fell to 25 cents shortly after, prompting the mill's first strike.‚ÄúWages Cut,‚Äù The Raleigh News and Observer, April 4, 1898. Child labor was also present, as boys as young as ten years old toiled at the mill until the practice was banned in 1913. In the early 20th century, O.C. Crabtree worked 66 hours a week at the age of 12. A 40-hour workweek was instated for all workers at the turn of the century and would remain a staple at the mill until its closure in the 1980s. Workers only worked limited hours at night and Federal legislation in 1913 limited night work to only two hours. Additionally, Erwin instituted a profit sharing and bonus program for all mill workers, something that was rare at a textile mill, especially in the South. Employees at the mill approved of Erwin's supervision and many knew him on a personal level, as he visited all areas of the factory on a daily or weekly basis. He also funded and threw huge celebrations for the workers on holidays, particularly on July 4.Richard C. Franck, ‚ÄúOral History of West Durham,‚Äù Duke University Libraries, 1975 The ability of mill's management to keep workers happy was a major factor in holding the community of West Durham together because it ensured that workers had long careers at the mill, with their families residing in the mill town for many years.  Unionization  New Deal legislation during the Great Depression not only improved worker's rights even further, but also gave mill workers the right to organize. The legislation set forth a 25-cent minimum wage and put the 40-hour workweek into law. While this federal legislation ‚Äúwas something new for the textile industry,‚Äù it had been a company policy for years. Even though conditions and pay at the factory were fairly better than other factories, the Great Depression inspired workers to fight for better wages and conditions. Erwin Mills‚Äô workers followed suit of other industries, which had organized during the past 15 years. But President KP Lewis, who had replaced Erwin in 1932, furiously refused to recognize the union. He was worried about the effects it would have on profits and shareholders. Tensions began to boil between management and employees. Erwin Mills workers participated in a large strike that took place throughout the south in September 1934, joining more than 5000 other Durham area factory workers to protest in the center of town. This strike was the first of a series of protests and walkouts that would at times paralyze the plant and pit management against thousands of workers. = The union movement grows = Eventually Lewis and the other management team members became open to the idea of a union at the mill, which was aided by the creation National Labor Relations Board and the passing of the Wagner Act. The Wagner Act prevented management at workplaces around the United States interfering with unions. The Textile Workers Organizing Committee was the most prominent union at the West Durham mills and had a presence at the other mill locations in North Carolina. This was the first union at mill in its more than 40 years of existence. The organization of workers led to friction between workers and management in the early 1940s. A new labor agreement was signed just prior to World War II on August 22, 1941 that officially recognized the union and stabilized wages for employees.‚ÄúAgreement between the Erwin Cotton Mills Co., Plants No. 1, 4 and 6, Durham N.C. and Textile Workers Union of America,‚Äù Erwin Cotton Mills Company, August 22, 1941. But, the agreement expired in 1943 and the two sides were unable to come to an agreement in 1945 after the union workers released a set of demands that ‚Äúno [other] southern cotton mill grant[ed]‚Äù at the time.‚Äú A Statement by the Erwin Mills,‚Äù Erwin Mills Cotton Company, 1945. Management originally refused to agree to the demands, which included paid holidays, a lunch break and having a person independent of the mill devise the labor agreement. It claimed that the mill could not maintain its profitability if it met the demands of workers and cited the fair treatment it had given them in the past, denying that they violated labor laws. Former Duke University economics professor Frank DeVyver joined management in 1943 specifically to deal with labor disputes and worked out a compromise that satisfied the workers, giving them benefits such as vacation time, lunch breaks and an hourly wage of 65 cents. This was a radical and new type of labor agreement, as few other southern textile mills granted these rights to their workers, especially a 40-minute lunch break. Conditions at the mill had come a long way from the handful of small children who were toiling in the mill 40 years prior.  Later years  The dynasty Erwin established in 1893 began to crumble in 1953 when Abney Mills acquired the Erwin Mill No. 1 and Erwin Mill No. 2 from the Duke family. Production and life at the mill remained the same as the city of Durham and Duke University sprouted up around aging factory. Employees continued to emerge victorious in the labor battle, signing new labor agreements in both 1956 and 1957, which prolonged the generous rights granted to workers in the prior decade. In 1962, the mill changed hands once again after Burlington Industries of Greensboro, North Carolina bought the mill and cut production in half. Working conditions, which had historically been above average, deteriorated during this period and were highlighted in a Duke Chronicle article that went as far as comparing the mill to a ‚Äúconcentration camp.‚ÄùDoug Hastings, ‚ÄúMill: like a concentration camp,‚Äù The Chronicle, December 12, 1969. Burlington Industries had done little to spur production at the mill, and there was little reason to, as modern factories in Asia and Central America were cheaper to operate and therefore stole business than traditional textile mills. Burlington did, however, spend millions of dollars to make improvements to both of the mills.Raunch, Henry E. Letter to Tom Campbell. December 16, 1969, Rubenstein Library, Duke University. The final year of textile production at the original Erwin Mill was in 1986, after 103 years of operation.

While en route from Torslanda Airport in Gothenburg to Stockholm Arlanda Airport, three armed members of the Croatian National Resistance (CNR) forcefully took control of the McDonnell Douglas DC-9-21 aircraft and redirected it to Bulltofta Airport in Malm√∂. There was a crew of four and eighty-six passengers on the Scandinavian Airlines System aircraft. Upon arriving at Bulltofta at 17:14, the hijackers demanded the release of seven members of their group, which had been sentenced for the 1971 occupation of the Consulate-General of Yugoslavia in Gothenburg and shooting at the Embassy of Yugoslavia in Stockholm, including Miro Bare≈°iƒá. They threatened to otherwise detonate a bomb. Negotiations followed throughout the evening, night and morning. Six of the seven prisoners agreed to the transfer and were boarded at 04:00. Only a third of the hostages were released and new negotiations followed. All passengers were eventually released in exchange for half a million Swedish krona. The aircraft then left for Madrid‚ÄìBarajas Airport in Spain. There the aircraft was surrounded by the police and the crew released. The hijackers surrendered at 14:47. They were arrested and spent a year in prison in Spain. The hijacking was decisive for the Parliament of Sweden passing the new Terrorism Act in 1973. Background Two Croatians occupied the Consulate- General of Yugoslavia in Gothenburg on 10 and 11 February 1971, demanding that a Croatian separatist be released from prison in Yugoslavia. After about twenty-four hours they surrendered, without their goals having been met. They were tried for Swedish courts and sentenced to prison. The ambassador of Yugoslavia stated inaccurately that they were part of the Usta≈°e, a prejudice term which has since stuck in the Swedish coverage and debate.Hans√©n: 49 The Embassy of Yugoslavia was compromised by two Croatians on 7 April 1971, whereby two Croatians shot Ambassador Rolovic and wounded a secretary. They were caught and, along with three others who had participated in the planning, were sentenced to prison. The two who broke in were sentenced to life imprisonment for murder. The various participants were sentenced in different prisons. The Government of Yugoslavia demanded that the murderers be sent to Yugoslavia where they could be executed. The issue spurred a political debate concerning terrorism, but it remained at a calm level and was mostly concerned with increased penalties for illegal possession of arms and the possibility of deporting terrorists after their prison sentences were concluded.Hans√©n: 54 Already before the attacks on the diplomatic mission, the hijacking was planned by the group as a resort should they be arrested. The three hijackers, aged 35, 40 and 29, lived off welfare in Gothenburg. They supplemented their income through extorting money from fellow Croatians in Gothenburg, claiming that anyone not paying them was an enemy of Croatia. The 29-year-old was previously sentenced for a robbery and several other violent crimes against both Swedes and Serbs. Hijacking =Bulltofta= Flight 130 was a domestic scheduled service from Torslanda Airport in Gothenburg to Stockholm Arlanda Airport. On board were a crew of 4 and 86 passengers. A few minutes after the aircraft departed at 16:30, two of the hijackers made their way to the cockpit. They pointed their guns at a flight attendant and demanded that the aircraft divert to Bulltofta Airport in Malm√∂. The pilots followed the orders.Hans√©n: 50 The pilot released the hijacking alert at 16:51 and the aircraft landed at Bulltofta at 17:10. The incident was largely met with disbelief and laughter from the passengers and some of the flight attendants, as they thought it was an exercise. Passengers described two of the hijackers as calm and with a good comprehension of Swedish, while one was clearly nervous and did not understand Swedish. The hijackers calmly answered questions regarding the action and stated that they intended to have the ambassador's murderer released. They then started making references to the Munich massacre ten days earlier and hinted that a similar situation could arise in the aircraft. Passengers described the hijackers as generally friendly. Once at Bulltofta the Croatians demanded the release of the seven Croatians sentenced after the attacks on the diplomatic missions. In addition, they required that they be allowed free passage out of Sweden for themselves and the prisoners. They made it clear that their intention was to detonate a bomb they had with them if the authorities did not meet their demands within eight hours. At 17:30 one passenger was permitted to leave for medical reasons. At 17:45 the hijackers threatened to detonate their bomb as there were photographers on the runway. Another three passengers were released for medical reasons at 19:00. The passengers were starved until about 20:00, when supplies of food and drink were provided to the aircraft. Lennart Geijer served as Minister of Justice during the incident The police were informed of the hijacking at 16:55 and immediately scrambled troops to Bulltofta to deal with the situation. Organised by the police superintendent on duty in Malm√∂, a low-profile police action was ordered, where no police officer should attempt any offensive action without prior orders. Minister of Justice Lennart Geijer was alerted at 18:20. He was vacationing at his cabin in Ystad Municipality, located only kilometers from the airport, and was able to quickly arrive at the scene. Once briefed, he called a cabinet conference by alerting Prime Minister Olof Palme. Meanwhile, the National Police Board dispatched several of its members to the airport. Its leader, Carl Persson, joined the crisis cabinet. They decided to avoid the use of force and instead attempt to tire out the hijackers through extending negotiations. Bulltofta was partially evacuated and the international departure area was converted to an emergency ward. Ten busloads of stretchers and medical equipment were brought in and set up in case of a detonation. At 21:00 a SAS Douglas DC-9 departed Bromma with the SAS executive management along with a reserve crew for a DC-9. Half an hour later Lund University Hospital was put in full emergency preparedness. Additional food supplies were handed over at 22:00. The first major decision for the authorities was whether the prisoners should be released. Palme gave the orders for preliminary release at 21:00. The cabinet met at 22:00 and by 23:00 it had concluded that the prisoners were to be transported to Bulltofta as an intermediate measure. There were at the time rumors that the terrorists were Serbs who had the intention of murdering the Croatians once they were on board the aircraft. The cabinet therefore decided that the prisoners would only be let on board if they agreed to themselves, after consulting with the hijackers. However, the issue was complicated around midnight when the Bulltofta base of operations received a threat by telefax which threatened to kill Palme, Geijer and two other ministers if the prisoners were handed over.Hans√©n: 51 There were several instances of photographers and other making their way onto the runway. This irritated the hijackers and the runway was cleared. New attempts were made to reach the runway and new clearings were carried out. All other aviation activity at Bulltofta ceased at 23:55. Fifteen minutes later two more passengers were let off due to heart problems. One recovered quickly after receiving medication, while the other was sent to hospital. The prisoners arrived at the airport between 01:35 and 02:10, having been transported by a Douglas DC-3 and two helicopters from their respective prisons. The prisoners were informed of the situation and the demands. At this time it was still not evident whether the two groups were friends or foes. As the only prisoner, Bare≈°iƒá stated at 02:12 that he was interested in letting the transaction take place without talking to the hijackers. Others talked to the hijackers, but they did not agree to the transfer. Bare≈°iƒá thereafter convinced all but one of them to accept the deal. Planning the practical aspects of the transaction was forcing the issue past the deadline. This was finalised at 03:02 when it was decided that the dissident would not be exchanged. Under command of Superintendent Lewijn, 30 passengers would be released after which two prisoners would be sent by police escort to the aircraft and let on board. This would be done three times until all passengers were safe and all willing prisoners aboard, with the cabin crew being let off in the last wave. The hijackers responded to the offer by demanding that all passengers be on board until all the prisoners were; otherwise the aircraft would be blown up. The police management was of the opinion that this was a valid threat. The cabinet was informed, and after considerations the police offered that half the hostages be released, then half the prisoners would be let on board and then the procedure repeated once more. The hijackers responded that they would accept that half the passengers be released when three prisoners were on board. After consultations this was accepted by the police.Hans√©n: 52 The first transaction took place at the agreed-upon time of 04:00. Three prisoners were let aboard the aircraft and 30 passengers were let out. The final three prisoners were let aboard at 04:05. However, the remaining passengers were kept on board and instead the hijackers demanded that the aircraft be fueled before any more releases. This was accepted by Geijer at 04:08. The situation was not well received by the cabinet. Also, the six new prisoners were able to take over command of the situation on the aircraft, replacing the weary hijackers. Refueling took place at 04:48. They then demanded one million Swedish krona to release further hostages. Negotiations followed, whereby the police argued that acquiring such amounts of cash would be difficult in the middle of the night, and the hijackers reduced their demand to half a million. The police further argued that a rested flight crew would be at the advantage of the hijackers. The county governor requested from the bank director of Kreditbanken for the money at 05:45, who responded that the money could be delivered at the earliest at 07:30. This was relayed to the hijackers at 06:56, who stated that they would continue to wait for the money. It arrived at 07:29 and negotiations started concerning how the money be handed over. The police demanded release of hostages first, which the hijackers refused. At the time the police were mostly concerned about the threat of the aircraft flying to a foreign location rather than it being blown up in Malm√∂. The engines were started up and departure procedures commenced. A new offer came from the hijackers and between 08:28 and 08:35 the exchange of passengers and money took place. None of the crew were released.Hans√©n: 52 =Barajas= The aircraft departed Sweden and headed for Spain. At 11:30 the pilot ask to land at Madrid‚ÄìBarajas Airport. The aircraft landed and was surrounded by 200 police officers. An English-speaking technician, a Norwegian SAS employee and the airport's director were let aboard the aircraft, where they negotiated the release of the crew. After it was made clear that the Spanish authorities would not allow the plane to take off, the hijackers surrendered at 14:47. When the aircraft was stormed and the hijackers arrested, the Spanish military police took care of the two bags of money. However, by the end of the action some of the money was not accounted for. Aftermath The overall handling of the incident was regarded as a success by the Swedish cabinet members. With the Munich massacre having taken place ten days earlier, there was a relief that the hijacking had ended without casualties. However, the Swedish authorities received harsh criticism from the Government of Yugoslavia for having met the demands of the hijackers. Flight 130 remains the only aircraft to be successfully hijacked in Sweden. A parliamentary commission, led by Carl Lidbom, was subsequently appointed to look into Swedish terror legislation. It concluded on 8 December 1972 that new legislation was indeed needed, cited the increase in terrorism both domestically and abroad. It proposed the need for easing deportation of people suspected of belonging to terrorist groups or partaking in politically motivated violence. A preliminary debate took place in Parliament on 11 December, and a proposal for legislation was presented by the cabinet on 19 January 1973. It was initially limited in duration from 15 April 1973 to 14 April 1974. The main debate in Parliament took place on 6 April, where it was passed with a large majority. The Terrorism Act gave increased rights for the police and the Swedish Security Service to deport foreigners and undercover surveillance of suspects. However, it was met with criticism that it reduced the civil rights of innocent foreigners. The law was permanently prolonged the following year.Hans√©n: 55 The hijackers and the prisoners were arrested by Spanish police and sentenced to one year of prison. After that they were permitted to move to Paraguay. Upon the breakup of Yugoslavia and the break- out of the Croatian War of Independence, they returned to their native land to fight for Croatian independence, where they were welcomed as heroes. Bare≈°iƒá was amongst the highest profiles amongst Croatian soldiers. His death in 1991 was kept a secret for a year to not break moral and he was posthumously appointed a general.

In 2012 the company was sued by Specialized Bicycle Components, for theft of trade secrets and breach of employment contract, as well as other charges. Of Specialized's nine claims, eight were thrown out of court, and the jury awarded Specialized one dollar in damages on the remaining count (breach of employment contract) that went to trial. It was estimated by Choi and Forsman's attorney, Tyler Paetkau, that Specialized incurred more than $2M in legal fees to practice \\"competition by litigation.\\" In September 2016, Volagi announced that it would close its doors after a founding member was injured in a bicycle accident involving an automobile. Volagi sponsored athletes such as Chris Ragsdale, compete in ultra-cycling events such as Race Across America.

It competed in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival where it won the FIPRESCI Prize. Plot In the 1880s, Danish Captain Gunnar Dinesen (Viggo Mortensen) is in Argentina with his teenage daughter Ingeborg (Viilbj√∏rk Malling Agger) who asks him if she can have a dog‚Äîone that will follow her wherever she goes. Dinesen is propositioned by the rutting Lieutenant Pittaluga (Adri√°n Fondari) who asks him for permission to take Inge to a dance in exchange for one of his horses. In clumsy Spanish Dinesen refuses, stating that Inge is his daughter. When Dinesen warns Inge that Pittaluga is too fond of young girls and she should not go near him, she asks why she ever would. Unbeknownst to her father, Inge is already involved with a young soldier named Corto. Corto tells Pittaluga and Dinesen about the rumors that Zuluaga, an officer who inexplicably disappeared into the desert, is leading a group of bandits and wearing a woman's dress. The men tell Corto to go into the desert and bring them something tangible as proof that Zuluaga is still alive. During the night Inge and Corto run off together. Though Pittaluga offers to retrieve Inge, Dinesen insists on going alone. Heading out into the desert he eventually encounters a mortally wounded man whispering the name Zuluaga. He later finds the dying Corto, with his throat cut, and demands of him the whereabouts of his daughter. Laying aside his rifle and hat, Dinesen with revolver in hand goes to investigate a suspicious sound. While the distraught Dinesen investigates the area near the helpless Corto, his hat and rifle are stolen by one of the natives. Dinesen comes back to Corto's body and finishes the job of killing Corto with his sword. The native fires a shot at Dinesen with the rifle and then rides his horse away, and Dinesen is forced to continue on foot through the inhospitable desert. Driven onward in the search for his daughter, he continues on in the direction the indigenous man went. As Dinesen wanders through the desert, he sees a dog who leads him first to a toy soldier that Corto had given to Inge and then to a Danish-speaking elderly woman who lives in a cave. She tells him her husband died of a snake bite. Captain Dinesen tells the woman that he is looking for his daughter and, as the conversation unfolds, it is gradually revealed that the woman is his daughter. She tells him to come back whenever he likes and he wanders out into the desert again. In the present day, a young girl (also played by Viilbj√∏rk Malling Agger) wakes up in a mansion in Denmark and goes to see her dogs. She is distressed by the fact that one dog has been scratching his fur off and the hound-keeper tells her it is because he is nervous and perplexed by her long absences. The girl takes the dog for a walk in the woods around her home and finds a toy soldier on the ground. She picks it up, and then hearing a sound from her dog, she goes to look for him. Finding only ripples spreading on a pond and no sign of the dog, Ingeborg casts the toy soldier into the pond.

It portrays the works of Salgado's father, the Brazilian photographer Sebasti√£o Salgado. The film was selected to compete in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Special Prize. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 87th Academy Awards. It won the 2014 Audience Award at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival and the 2015 Audience Award at the Troms√∏ International Film Festival.sansebastianfestival.com Other awards of the 62nd editiontiff.no Award Winners 2015 It also won the C√©sar Award for Best Documentary Film at the 40th C√©sar Awards. Overview Salgado's work explored natural environments and the humans who inhabit them. His black and white photographs illuminated how the environment and humans are exploited to maximize profit for the global economic market. The film follows Salgado as he began a career as an economist with his wife, L√©lia, at his side. During a stint in Paris, L√©lia bought a camera, and Salgado discovered his love of photography. Following the timeline of his life, the film uses his own photos and videos to illustrate Salgado's life and work beginning with his exile from Brazil and his subsequent transition from economist to artist and explorer. Salgado began working full-time as a photographer in 1973, first news photography then documentary style, with Lelia supporting him. The film follows him as he travels around South America, including the countries neighboring his native Brazil, spending time among and photographing native tribes like the Zo'√©, living lives not much touched by the modern world. Co-directed by Salgado's son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado, the film contains recollections from childhood of a father who was absent much of the time and the times he accompanied his father on trips to discover who Salgado was beyond his childhood conception. Next, Salgado traveled to the Sahel region of Africa, shown in unflinching and heartbreaking video and photographs. Salgado referred to the famine in Ethiopia as a problem of distribution, not just a natural disaster. He documented the largest ever refugee camps and the innumerable deaths that occurred there, from hunger, cholera, and cold. His work covering famine in Africa brought worldwide attention to the region and the underlying causes. After photographing the Yugoslavian war and Rwanda after the genocide and one year later, Salgado lost hope for humanity. Going back to his natal Minas Gerais, he founds Instituto Terra and re-forests his family land. Then he is inspired to photograph the wildlife. The film follows 40 years of Salgado's work from South America, to Africa, Europe, the Arctic, and back home to Brazil focusing on international conflicts, starvation and exodus, and natural landscapes in decline. Reception The Salt of the Earth received largely positive reviews from critics. According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of critics have given the film a positive review with an average rating of 8.00/10, based on 94 reviews. The site's critics consensus states: \\"While the work it honors may pose thorny ethical questions that Salt of the Earth neglects to answer, it remains a shattering, thought-provoking testament to Sebasti√£o Salgado's career.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 83 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".

It is found in shallow water in the Bahamas, the Caribbean, and Brazil. It lives in fissures in corals and rocks. Description Lebrunia coralligens has a broad basal disc and a smooth column, the upper part of which has several long outgrowths known as pseudotentacles as well as feeding tentacles on the oral disc. The pseudotentacles are photosynthetic organs; they are lobed and may branch slightly but they are much less branched than the pseudotentacles of the closely related Lebrunia danae. The tips may be darker in colour than the rest of the pseudotentacles and are slightly swollen and sometimes double-lobed, and the stalks have white rings and dark lines. The pseudotentacles are armed with small vesicles containing nematocysts and these are mostly concentrated near the tips. The colour of Lebrunia coralligens varies but the pseudotentacles are often the only parts visible and are usually tan or dark grey, or sometimes bluish-green. With the pseudotentacles extended, this species may measure . The upper part of the column bears spirocysts and nematocysts (armed cells). The spirocysts are non-venomous and are used to entangle prey, while the nematocysts inject venom into it. At night the long, feeding tentacles are extended. Distribution and habitat Lebrunia coralligens is known from the Caribbean Sea, the Bahamas and Brazil at depths down to about . It inhabits crevices in coral heads and fissures in rocks, and often the only parts of the animal that are visible are the tips of the pseudotentacles. Biology Sea anemones of this species have a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, photosynthetic single-celled algae residing within the tissues of the host. There are between twenty and thirty times more algal cells in the pseudotentacles than there are in the true tentacles. There is a daily rhythm by which the pseudotentacles spread out to expose themselves to light by day and close up at night, at which time the feeding tentacles expand. When the anemone is in a low nutritional state, the pseudotentacles expand fully during the day, but a well-fed anemone only partially expands them. The expansion of the true tentacles is a feeding response and is increased when the animal is in a high nutritional state. In Barbados, breeding takes place in May and June. Up to fifty planula larvae are released from an adult, each one being approximately long and half that width, with zooxanthellae already present in their tissues. The larvae usually settle on the seabed, often in groups, within 24 hours and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile sea anemones. These have eight tentacles at first but further whorls of tentacles arise as they grow. The pseudotentacles do not emerge until about six weeks after settlement.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic, mainly in the Battle of the St. Lawrence. She was named for Springhill, Nova Scotia. Springhill was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 5 May 1943 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt and launched 7 September later that year. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 21 March 1944 at Victoria, British Columbia. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River-class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After transiting to Halifax, Springhill was sent to Bermuda in June 1944 to work up. Upon her return she was assigned to escort group EG 16 as a local escort based out of Halifax. She was made Senior Officer's Ship upon joining the group in August 1944. With this unit she fought in the Battle of the St. Lawrence. She remained with the group until March 1945, when she was ordered to Derry, but quickly returned in April to undergo a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant installing water-cooling and refrigeration abilities and changing the camouflage pattern. The refit began in May 1945 at Pictou, Nova Scotia and completed in October. However, by that point Japan had surrendered and Springhill was paid off at Halifax on 1 December 1945 and laid up in Bedford Basin. In 1947 she was sold and taken to Sydney, Nova Scotia for breaking up. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

It is commonly seen in copper porphyry ore deposits in calc-alkaline rocks. Phyllic alteration is characterised by the assemblage of quartz + sericite + pyrite, and occurs at high temperatures and moderately acidic (low pH) conditions. Hydrogen-ion metasomatism is the process that causes phyllic alteration. While the mineralogy of the rock is altered throughout, texture is preserved and primary porphyry structure (including position of original veins) may still be visible. If a rock undergoes phyllic alteration, then orthoclase feldspar, biotite and various silicates are altered in addition to plagioclase. Plagioclase will be altered to sericite (a fine-grained white mica) by sericitic alteration, and mafic minerals are replaced by quartz. Tourmaline may appear as radiating aggregate or prismatic crystals between the quartz- sericite assemblage. Phyllic alteration is often closely associated with argillic alteration, which occurs at lower temperatures and dominantly affects plagioclase.  Variation with depth  Phyllic alteration typically forms in the base-metal zone of a porphyry system. Alteration assemblages vary with depth and with degree of fluid interaction. In deep environments, the most highly altered areas are veins and thin selvages, or halos, that surround them. The selvages are generally <10 cm in diameter and composed of major sericite and minor quartz. Vein orientation is preserved from original rock, but minerals within are mostly replaced by pyrite. With decreasing depth, selvages widen (10 cm - 1m) and contain more quartz and pyrite. Outside of selvages, most alteration occurs in replacement of mafic minerals by chlorite and of plagioclase by sericite.

Constructed around 1808-1811 (by dendrochronological dating in 2014) by Nathaniel Jones, it is one of the few remaining large scale plantation homes in Wake County, and one of the oldest private residences in Raleigh. The home has received several additions since its initial construction, but is mainly known for its Federal-style front. Owned by the Jones family for more than 150 years, the house has fallen into disrepair in more recent decades. Following the purchase of the land the house sat upon by developers in 2012, Preservation North Carolina acquired the house and had it moved to a nearby residential neighborhood, where it sits today. The Crabtree Jones house was greatly influenced by the historical events it stood through while in turn influencing the way the Raleigh community developed around it, through both its people and through its land. History =18th century= The land on which the Crabtree Jones house sat has been owned by the Jones family for over two hundred years. The family first acquired a parcel of land through a 1740s land grant by the Earl of Granville to Francis Jones. A Jones house was supposedly built close to Crabtree Creek, but is thought to have been destroyed by the floods that frequent the creek's watershed.National Register of Historic Places, Crabtree Jones House, Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina, National Register #73001376. This necessitated the creation of a home further away from the Creek, and the Crabtree Jones house is that home. In order to counter the threat of flooding, the house sat upon one of the larger and steeper hills in the area, around 40 ft higher than the surrounding landscape and over 100 ft above the creek, overlooking Crabtree creek from about 900 yards away.Raleigh Map 2014 (Raleigh, NC) ,.

Nathaniel Jones eventually became known as Crabtree Jones, supposedly in order to differentiate him from his father, Nathaniel Jones Sr., who lived in the region.National Register of Historic Places, Crabtree Jones House. The former's nickname reflects the landscape in which his house was built. =Antebellum= Crabtree Jones passed the house on to his son, Kimbrough Jones, along with a large estate. Kimbrough was able to significantly expand this inheritance. The 1850 census records that the Jones family's property was worth $18,619; at the 1860 census its value was given as $50,000.U.S. Census, 1850 and 1860: Heads of Families. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1908. It is likely that the estate's main crop in the antebellum period was tobacco. Like his father, Kimbrough was involved in state politics, serving several terms in the North Carolina general assembly. At the start of the American Civil War Kimbrough was an old man, having been 76 by the time of the 1860 census.U.S. Census, 1860 The Jones's land was used by both sides during the war, and Camp Crabtree, one of a few large Confederate training camps around Raleigh, was located there. The house appears to have been badly affected by the presence of Sherman's troops, who destroyed or stole most of the furniture and personal property within the house. Kimbrough wrote in 1865 that, ‚ÄúI cannot describe nor you imagine the utter destruction of everything in the house and out of doors; everything in the house except the beds, bureaus, wardrobes and a few chairs is destroyed‚Äù.Letter from Kimbrough Jones to Family member, (Raleigh, NC) 1867. In 1866, a year after the war's end, Kimbrough Jones died, leaving the house to his son, Kimbrough Jones Jr. =Postbellum= Throughout the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, the family continued to be an active part of the community. Although it does not appear anyone from the family served in World War I, a few of the sons of Kimbrough joined soon afterwards in order to receive money for their college education.Letter from Col.

The house and surrounding grounds continued to be owned by the Jones family until being sold to a developer in 1973. =Decline= By the latter half of the 20th century, the Crabtree Jones house had fallen into disrepair. As the area surrounding the house and its now only 30-acre property began to be developed, the first efforts to save the home were made. In 1969 the house was designated a historic site by the city of Raleigh, and in 1973 it was placed in the National Register of Historic Places. (The house was originally listed under the name \\"Crabtree Jones House\\"; this was altered in 2016 to \\"Nathaniel Jones Jr. House\\".) With the support of the Raleigh Historic Sites commission, the new owner of the house, Charles Gaddy, promised to preserve the house and prevent its demolition, thus preserving the house for the short term.Letter from William Dodge to Charles Gaddy, (Raleigh, NC 1973) This did not, however, guarantee its restoration, something it was in dire need of. As the home continued to fall into disrepair several nonprofits attempted to purchase the Crabtree Jones house, but to no avail. As early as 1974 the Junior League was considering putting money into the house as part of a greater bicentennial project; the cost of restoration at that time was estimated at $40,000 to $45,000.Letter from Lucie Hunter to the General Membership of the Junior League of Raleigh (Raleigh, NC 1974) By the 1990s much of the surrounding land had been bought up by developers, so that by the early 2000s only the house and a one-acre tract of land of the former Jones estate remained.

Architecture An example of the painted motifs that decorate many of the mantels in the Crabtree Jones House, this one is located on the mantel in the main dining room. The Crabtree Jones House's architectural history is as significant as the history of those who lived in it. Dendrochronology performed in 2014 dated the front of the house to 1808-09 and the stairwell to 1811. The floor beams of all sections of the house are made with wood, and are in varying states of decay due to centuries of termite damage. The house's main section is exemplary of early Federal architecture. This part of the Crabtree Jones House consists of a central two story section that is 5 bays wide and flanked by two one story extensions on either end, both one bay wide. The interior is laid out in a traditional hall and parlor house floor plan, with the front door, a single 6 paneled wood one, opening into the main dining room. However, the original set of stairs leading up to the second floor had been removed some time since the construction of the additions, so that the main stairwell is now housed in the hallway of the first addition. Although the house is thought to originally have no porch, its front has been graced by them during different periods in time, including a highly decorated Italianate one thought to have been put in around the mid-19th century and a plainer one believed to be put in around the early 20th century. For the 2014 relocation this second porch was removed. The house features two additions, one believed to have been constructed in the early 19th century and the second around the middle of that century. These feature some unique architectural elements as well, such as Greek revival moldings and an enclosed second story slanted porch. The house contains three brick chimneys, one in the back extension and two in the main section. The mantels in the front of the house are unique in the fact that they are ornately painted with pastoral scenes and motifs. Hinges on doors are of the traditional H and L bolt fashion. Screen doors windows were added in several places starting in 1925. The house itself is covered by wood weatherboards on both the main section and the addition, and the exterior is currently painted white. Before its removal the Crabtree Jones house contained a large English basement. Once Preservation North Carolina was able to examine the house in detail it was found that the basement had been used as a family trash dump for several generations.\\"The Crabtree Jones House: ESI Working With Preservation North Carolina.\\" Environmental Services, Inc.(ESI) . N.p., 13 Feb. 2014. Web. 6 Apr. 2014. . Numerous artifacts were uncovered, including broken glass, pottery, etc. All of what could be was removed for safekeeping and the English Basement demolished in order to make way for the oncoming apartments. Archeological digs were also conducted at the site the house was moved to, but those uncovered nothing of significance.Terri Russ, CRABTREE JONES HOUSE: NEW LOCATION ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT (Raleigh, Wake County, NC) 2014. Move The Crabtree Jones House about to be moved In 2005, Charles Gaddy died, and the land transferred to another development group in 2009. The Crabtree Jones House was scheduled for demolition in 2012.Campbell, Collin. \\"Historic Crabtree Jones House gets a high-tech move.\\" The property, including that on which the house sat, are to be turned into a set of apartment buildings similar to those that have been built recently in other sections of the city. Much of the forest that had covered the remaining one acre property was removed. Fortunately, the nonprofit Preservation North Carolina, with the cooperation of the developer and the local community, was able to move the house off its hill to a nearby 1960s suburban neighborhood that also houses the Jones family cemetery. A key challenge concerning the move was just how exactly the 200-ton house would be transported down a hill of such a steep grade. This was accomplished via the use of computer-controlled hydraulic pumps that kept the house level during its transfer. The move itself had a budget of $632,000, which included placing the house on the steel moving array, transportation, and the purchase and demolition of the existing 1960s ranch home on whose site the Crabtree Jones house was to be placed. The house successfully completed its move on February 4, 2014. Effect on community In April 2014 the Crabtree Jones House was still garnering media interest, particularly in the news. To some extent it had reopened a debate over the preservation of historic buildings, particularly in downtown Raleigh's Historic Oakwood District. This section of town offers a wide variety of housing styles and ages, ranging from 19th century Victorian to 1920s bungalows. However, in recent decades the neighborhood has strongly opposed constructing any new houses in the area or adding additions onto any of the existing houses. One example that has gained notoriety in recent months is the construction of a particular home in the district that strongly features modernist design.Campbell, Collin. \\" In Raleigh's historical Oakwood, a modern house divides neighbors.\\" North Raleigh News (News & Observer), 31 Mar. 2014. Web. 6 Apr. 2014. While some neighbors have supported the construction, many others have condemned it, and the opposing sides have taken their debate all the way to the county superior courts. The Crabtree Jones House has been used as an arguing point for the side supporting the approval of the modernist house. One of the many reasons the house was preserved is because of its significant variety of architectural styles. Throughout the 19th century the house went through varying degrees of renovation so that it now showcases many different architectural styles. Those groups who support the construction of the modernist house in the Oakwood neighborhood, such as Preservation North Carolina (the nonprofit largely responsible for preventing the destruction of the Crabtree Jones House), argue that such a diversity of architecture will, in the long run, add to the historical uniqueness of Oakwood.Letter from Myrick Howard to the Editor of the News & Observer, (Raleigh NC) 2014 Issues with modern construction in the neighborhood have usually been dealt with quickly in the past and in favor of those who wish the neighborhood to remain unchanged; the relocation of the Crabtree Jones House and its prevalence in the news can be labeled as partially to blame for the prolonged argument. The preservation of the Crabtree Jones House has also acted as community unifying event, and has brought historic preservation back into the limelight. Its unique architectural features have inspired new debate in the field of historic preservation and the construction of modern houses in historic neighborhoods. The house itself has been affected by nearly every event that effected the state since its creation. Through the contributions of the Jones family to the local community through service and economics the house has helped to shape the local landscape.

It was built in 1949 as an Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) demonstrator locomotive, numbered 7001. Soo Line bought 7001 and the other demonstrator locomotives 7002 and 7003 for its subsidiary Wisconsin Central Railway. Number 7001 was renumbered 2500A, and 7002 and 7003 were renumbered 2500B and 2501B respectively. It is now owned by the Lake Superior Railroad Museum for use on their North Shore Scenic Railroad.  History  With steam operations on North American Railroads being converted to diesel operations, EMD, along with other locomotive builders, began building demonstrator units to be tested by various railroads. They built a set of three FP7 units, 7001 (A unit) and 7002 and 7003 (B units). In November 1949, the Canadian Pacific Railway tested these units. Canadian Pacific owned most of the Soo Line, and after testing the three demonstrator units, they were sent to the Soo Line. In April 1950, Soo Line ran the set from Minneapolis to Portal, North Dakota then Duluth, Minnesota to Winnipeg. 7001 hosted the United Kingdom's Duke of Windsor, the former King Edward VIII, in its cab through North Dakota. Soo Line was so impressed with the set, that it purchased them for use on the Wisconsin Central Railway. In May 1950, they were delivered as WC 2500A, 2500B, and 2501B. WC 2500A often pulled Soo Line's Laker from Chicago to Duluth. Although numbered as Wisconsin Central, 2500 was painted in Soo Line's maroon and gold scheme. In 1961, Wisconsin Central became part of the Soo Line, and 2500 was repainted into the red and gray Soo Line scheme. When passenger service was discontinued in the 1960s, 2500 was used to pull freight trains. In 1980, 2500 was converted to provide compressed air and electrical power to snowplows in the winter months. In August 1986, 2500 was donated to the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth. It then went through a lengthy and complete overhaul. Much of its interior was repaired or replaced. Its exterior was repainted back into Soo Line's old maroon and gold scheme. In 1995, Soo Line 2500 pulled passenger trains, this time for the North Shore Scenic Railroad.  Present-day operations  Soo Line 2500 often pulls special excursions on the North Shore Scenic Railroad, and operates a minimum of a few times each year. Much of its time, however, is spent inside the Lake Superior Railroad Museum on static display. SOO 2500 is one of four Soo Line locomotives in the Lake Superior Railroad Museum's collection, the others being Soo 320 (SW1, the first diesel purchased by the Soo Line), Soo Line 700 and Soo Line 2719. In March 2014, it pulled an empty coal hopper train along the North Shore Scenic Railroad's \\"Lakefront Line.\\" In April 2014, a new radiator was installed in 2500, allowing it to operate a longer schedule on the NSSR. In January 2014, it was announced that the SOO 2500 would be one of 26 locomotives participating in the Streamliners at Spencer event, held May 29-June 1 in Spencer, North Carolina. On May 11, it departed for and participated in the Streamliners event. On June 18, it returned from the Streamliners event, having been transported by BNSF Railway and Norfolk Southern Railway freight trains both ways. On June 21, 2014, Soo Line 2500 pulled a special round-trip train from Duluth to Two Harbors, Minnesota for \\"Grandma's Marathon\\". On July 11, it pulled the NSSR's Music & Pizza train with Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway 193. On July 12, it pulled the \\"Streamliner to Two Harbors\\" special with Erie Mining Company 4211 to honor the 130th anniversary of the first ore train in Two Harbors. Since then, SOO 2500 has been on numerous excursions, averaging about one per week, much more than it had in the past several years at the Lake Superior Railroad Museum. The locomotive is also occasionally featured in photo charters for \\"railfan weekend.\\" In 2015, SOO 2500 was featured with Northern Pacific 3617 in a photo charter. In 2016, the locomotive was brought down to Saint Paul Union Depot for \\"Depot Days\\" celebrating the station's 90th anniversary on April 30 and May 1. It was featured in a night photo shoot at the depot with Milwaukee Road 261. It was then ferried by the Minnesota Transportation Museum, in cooperation with the Lake Superior Railroad Museum with Great Northern Railway 325 to Osceola, Wisconsin. It was featured in a one-day photographer special on May 2 on the Osceola and St. Croix Valley Railway, which is part of the original Soo Line mainline. It co-starred with former Duluth bunk-mate Great Northern 400. On May 3, 2500 departed Osceola and was ferried back to Duluth and was returned to the Lake Superior Railroad Museum, where it returned to Excursion service for the 2016 season.

Established in 1876 by Mahendra Lal Sarkar, a private medical practitioner, it focuses on fundamental research in basic sciences. It is India's oldest research institute Located at Jadavpur, South Kolkata beside Jadavpur University, Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute and Indian Institute of Chemical Biology it is spread over a limited area of 9.5 acres.. In May 2018, the Ministry of Human Resource Development announced that IACS had been granted the status of Deemed University under De- novo Category under section 3 of the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act 1956. Academic programme The institute is engaged in fundamental research in various fields of physics, chemistry and chemical biology. It is one of the most active research institutes in India and publishes on an average ~ 500 research articles in peer reviewed journals including top journals like Physical Review Letters, Journal of American Chemical Society and Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Recent interests include research in energy, fuel cells, nano materials like graphene and carbon nanotubes. The institute emphasizes PhD programmes, the degree being provided by IACS itself . There is also full- fledged Integrated PhD programme for post-Bachelor's students. From academic year 2005-2006 it started an integrated PhD programme in chemistry. There are 8 departments in IACS, 4 units and 3 centres namely Materials Science, Solid state physics, Theoretical physics, Spectroscopy, Physical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Biological Chemistry, Polymer Science unit, Energy research unit, Raman centre for atomic and molecular sciences, Centre for advanced materials, Center for Mathematical, Computational and Data Sciences, MLS Professor's unit and Director's Research Unit. After getting Deemed to be University status by UGC, the department structure has been replaced by School Structure. At present there are six schools namely School of Applied & Interdisciplinary Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, School of Chemical Sciences, School of Materials Sciences, School of Mathematical & Computational Sciences and School of Physical Sciences. There are about 70 working scientists in IACS. One important distinctive aspect of IACS is the presence of a majority of young scientist who are bringing new research areas and directions to IACS. Starting 2018 , IACS has introduced a 5 year Integrated BS-MS course for highly motivated students who have passed their 12th standard examinations . The cutoff for admission to the course remains extremely high , given the very limited number of seats (usually not more than 60) and the students have to undergo an online test followed by an interview. Students with high ranks in JEE Main and Advanced /NEET UG and KVPY are eligible for direct interview. The 5 year integrated course is purely research oriented and aimed at producing world class scientists. The course is one of the most exhaustive of its kind and is suited only for the highly meritorious students.Given the vast number of applications received from all over the country and the very limited seat availability ,the selection rate for this programme is lower even than that of prestigious JEE. Nobel laureate Sir C. V. Raman did his groundbreaking work in Raman effect in this institute. His work was first published in the Indian Journal of Physics, which is published by IACS. Apart from the works of C. V. Raman and K. S. Krishnan in Optics, IACS has produced several important paradigms in modern science. IACS has a very strong group in theoretical chemistry and quantum chemistry. Debashis Mukherjee developed the Mk-MRCC method to account for electron correlations in molecular systems which is considered as a \\"gold-standard\\" in computational chemistry. Another important discovery has been in the area of solvation dynamics of molecules and particular the dynamics of water molecules around the surfaces of membranes. These experiments performed by Professor Kankan Bhattacharyya have provided a fundamental insights into the behavior of water near biological surfaces and led to the coining of the word \\"biological water\\" in the physical chemistry community.

Administration At its inception, the IACS was headed by a President, with the Honorary Secretary responsible for the day-to-day running of the Society. Until 1911, the office of President was de facto held by the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, when the Lieutenant-Governor (Governor from 1912) became the co-patron of the Society alongside the Viceroy of India, whose office-holders were automatically Patrons of the Society until 1947.With the exceptions of Sir (later Lord) Antony MacDonnell (Lieutenant- Governor 1893-1895), Sir Charles Cecil Stevens (Lieutenant-Governor 1897-1898), James Bourdillon (Lieutenant-Governor 1902-1903), Sir Lancelot Hare (Lieutenant-Governor 1906) and Francis Slacke (Lieutenant-Governor 1906-1908). Following India's independence in 1947, the administration of the IACS was reconstituted, with the designation of \\"Honorary Director\\" substituted for \\"Honorary Secretary.\\" The Director's prefix of \\"Honorary\\" was dropped in 1953. =Presidents of the IACS (1876-present)= *Sir Richard Temple, 1st Baronet FRS (1876-1877) *The Hon.

The Ladies Rest Room was built by the Marshall County court in 1924 as a place for rural women to relax, rest, and eat during their visits to Lewisburg, the county seat. During the 1910s and 1920s, there was widespread encouragement in the United States for the establishment of ladies' lounges and rest rooms to accommodate rural women who traveled into county seats and market towns to conduct business. It was suggested that if country women had comfortable in-town accommodations for themselves and their young children, they would visit town more frequently and would buy more consumer products from local stores. Also, agricultural reformers perceived that ladies' rest rooms would provide increased opportunities for agricultural extension workers and home demonstration agents to reach farm women. By 1917, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that there were about 200 rest rooms for rural women around the country, largely in the West and Midwest; it was not until the 1920s that the concept was widely adopted in Tennessee. Most ladies' rest room facilities were rooms inside stores, courthouses, or other civic buildings; the Ladies Rest Room in Lewisburg is unusual for being housed in its own separate building. It is thought to be the first and possibly the only stand-alone ladies' rest room in Tennessee. The building is a one-story rectangular red brick structure with a basement, built in the Colonial Revival style. It was designed by A. C. Colley, a Nashville architect, and constructed by local builder J. L. Sanders. Exterior features include a covered porch that wraps around the front of the building and part of one side, wooden columns on brick pilasters, a parapet roof with a wooden cornice, and wooden trellises. The building interior includes a large reception room in the front, a bathroom and hall in the building's midsection, and a private bedroom in the rear (provided for the live-in matron who was hired by the county to maintain the facility and supervise its operation). The basement houses a kitchen and dining area. The Ladies Rest Room proved popular. Shortly after it opened in 1924, the county's home demonstration agent reported that \\"constant use is being made of it by the country people.\\" It became customary for farm families to travel into Lewisburg on Saturdays and important court days, with the men gathering in the county courthouse and their wives congregating in the Ladies Rest Room. The Ladies Rest Room building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. At the time of its listing, it was still being used for its original purpose.

It featured Hollywood stars in dramatized versions of then-current movies and \\"helped to make Hollywood an origination point for major radio programs.\\"Buxton, Frank and Owen, Bill (1972). The Big Broadcast: 1920-1950. The Viking Press. SBN 670-16240-x. P. 113. Radio historian John Dunning called the program, sponsored by Campbell Soup Company, \\"the most glamorous show of its time.\\" The program was the inspiration for the 1937 Warner Brothers movie of the same title, which featured Louella Parsons as herself. The instigator of the program was gossip columnist Louella Parsons, whose column was distributed by the Hearst Syndicate. Dunning wrote that she \\"promoted the concept and became the driving force behind the success of Hollywood Hotel.\\"Dunning, John. (1976). Tune in Yesterday: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, 1925-1976. Prentice-Hall, Inc. . P.282-283. At the time Hollywood Hotel was launched, Parsons had no peers in Hollywood. In 1937, columnist Jimmy Fidler wrote, \\"Louella Parsons has broadened her domination of filmland to include radio, and woe be to those who dare to flout her authority.\\" Hollywood Hotel's popularity even spread beyond the United States. On January 28, 1938, all stations of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation began carrying it. It was also broadcast in Australia. A June 11, 1938, ad in a Sydney newspaper said, \\"In America, 'Hollywood Hotel' entertains millions of listeners, and now, from 2UE, it is winning a big audience who appreciate smart, snappy entertainment. Hear it every Thursday night at 8:15.\\" Format Dunning described the hour-long program as being \\"built around the illusion of a glamorous hotel.\\" Although it was broadcast from a studio, an episode would begin with \\"a lot of talk and film babble as the stars supposedly made their way in and out of the theater.\\" Next came a musical segment featuring an orchestral number, a solo by a member of the cast and a performance by a guest singer. Then Parsons interviewed a celebrity. A station break ensued, followed by a 20-minute sketch based on a new movie and featuring several of the movie's stars. That abridged version of a movie apparently whetted listeners' appetites for the real thing. One writer reported, \\"Lolly [Parsons] could sometimes double a picture's earnings by admitting it to the program.\\" In a sense, Hollywood Hotel may have marked a transition in the relationship between the movie industry and radio. Edward D. Berkowitz wrote that, although the movie industry considered radio a threat in the latter's early years, \\"In time, however, Hollywood came to accept the permanent presence of radio and to use the new medium to its advantage.\\" He went on to cite the role Parsons' program played: > The conceit behind the program was that it was taking place in a glamorous > Hollywood hotel -- not a utilitarian radio studio, as it actually was. Stars > dropped in for drinks or dinner and caught up with Louella Parsons, who > interviewed them on their latest doings. Dick Powell sang a song, > replicating the variety format popular on radio, and then the stars re- > created scenes from their latest pictures. It was radio in the service of > Hollywood in the service of radio, and everyone made out.Berkowitz, Edward > D. (2010). Mass Appeal: The Formative Age of the Movies, Radio and TV. > Cambridge University Press. . Pp. 40-41 Star Power Much of Hollywood Hotel's attraction was the caliber of Hollywood stars that appeared on it. In the first five episodes alone, listeners heard Claudette Colbert, Ronald Colman, Loretta Young, Jean Harlow, Dolores del R√≠o, Reginald Owen, Victor Jory and Gloria Swanson. A January 23, 1937, article in Motion Picture Daily reported that Hollywood Hotel had 83 \\"film guests\\" from July 1, 1936, to January 1, 1937. Listeners might have been surprised to learn that those big-name Hollywood stars appeared for free‚Äîor, more precisely, that they received one case of the sponsor's soup for their appearances. Such was Parsons' power in Hollywood that, as an article in Life magazine summarized, she \\"could -- and did -- bully the biggest stars in the business into appearing without pay on her radio program.\\" Another article in Life in 1965 summarized Parson's broadcasting success after an earlier failure: > When she flopped with a local radio program on which she interviewed \\"guest\\" > stars, she simply essayed a grander scheme; instead of kidnaping screen > personalities one by one, she corralled them by whole companies to do > synopsized versions of current movies, and in so doing, she hit it rich. Even Parsons' power, however, had its limits. Movie stars who normally received $1,000 for appearing on a radio program resented receiving only a case of soup. Life magazine reported, \\"when the Screen Actors' Guild, led by Jimmy Cagney, insisted they be paid with money instead, the sponsor recoiled in horror and the program was speedily abandoned.\\" Cast Initially, Parsons was the hostess and star. After the soup-for-performance system was abandoned, the program was brought back in 1938 with William Powell as host and star. Herbert Marshall filled in for Powell at times. Other cast members were as follows: * MC: Dick Powell, Fred MacMurray, Jerry Cooper, Ken Murray and Frank Parker * Telephone operator (opening each show with \\"Hello, Hollywood Hotel\\"): Duane Thompson\\"Watts in the Air: Hollywood Hotel Begins Third Year.\\" Harrisburg [PA] Telegraph.

Church of St James the Great, Kilkhampton, Cornwall. Historic seats of the Grenville family in Normandy (Granville, Manche), Glamorgan (Neath Castle), Devon (Bideford) & Cornwall (Stowe, Kilkhampton) Sir Richard de Grenville (died after 1142) (alias de Grainvilla, de Greinvill, etc.) was one of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan who served under Robert FitzHamon (died 1107),the tradition that he was brother of Robert FitzHamon was dismissed as myth by Round, p.156 in the conquest of Glamorgan in Wales. He obtained from FitzHamon the lordship of Neath in which he built Neath Castle and in 1129 founded Neath Abbey. He is by tradition the founder and ancestor of the prominent Westcountry Grenville family of Stowe in the parish of Kilkhampton in Cornwall and of Bideford in Devon, the later head of which family was John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628‚Äì1701). The surname of his supposed descendants the Westcountry Grenville family was spelled by tradition \\"Grenville\\" until 1661 when it was altered to \\"Granville\\".Round, p.130 Lord of Neath River Neath at Neath Castle, looking upstream As his reward for his services during the conquest of Glamorgan his brother Robert FitzHamon allotted him the lordship of Neath, where Richard built Neath Castle. He is styled in one Glamorgan charter as \\"Constable of the Earl of Gloucester\\",Round, p.136 thus of Robert Fitzroy, 1st Earl of Gloucester (died 1147), his brother's son-in-law and heir. Founds Neath Abbey In 1129 Richard de Grenville founded Neath Abbey within his lordship as a daughter-house of the Benedictine Savigny Abbey near the village of Savigny-le-Vieux in western Normandy. Following the assumption of the Savigniac order into the Cistercian order in 1147 Neath Abbey also became a Cistercian house. To it he donated many of his lands, both in Wales and in Devon which he held from the Honour of Gloucester, including Littleham, near Bideford in North Devon.Round, p.137 A later confirmation charter granted in 1207 by King John (1199‚Äì1216) to Neath Abbey confirmed to the monks the former grants of Richard de Grenville:Clark, G.T.

Firstly, according to Ordericus Vitalis (died c. 1142), to Isabel Giffard, the only daughter of Walter Giffard, 1st Earl of Buckingham (died 1102) and Lord of Longueville in Normandy, co-heiress with her aunt Rohesia (wife of Richard FitzGilbert, Lord of Clare) of the great possessions and lordships of the Giffard family.Granville, 1895, p.26 Grenville's second wife was a certain \\"Constance\\", mentioned as his wife in his foundation charter of Neath Abbey. She acted jointly with him in the founding of that Abbey, which suggested to Round that she may have been a native-born Welsh lady and the heiress of Neath. Granville (1895) suggested she was the daughter of Caradoc ap Arthur, Lord of Glyn Nedd. No surviving charter of his mentions any children and the fact that the lordship and castle of Neath escheated to the overlord the Earl of Gloucester and Lord of Glamorgan, the son-in-law and heir of Robert FitzHamon, suggested to Round that he left no children to inherit his possessions.Round, p.138 Likewise, he held a few manors in Devon from the feudal barony of Gloucester, one of these being Naissa (Ash Reigny) which was re-granted after his death by the overlord to the de Reigny family. This evidence that the lands of Richard de Grenville did not descend to the later Westcountry Grenville family suggested to Round that though the latter family claimed to descend from the lord of Neath, this was not the case. Supposed titles According to tradition and as confirmed retrospectively by the 1661 warrant of King Charles II, Richard de Grenville was claimed to have been the brother and heir male of Robert FitzHamon, who was supposed to have been Earl of Corboile and Lord of Thorigny and Granville in Normandy. Although FitzHamon's lands passed via his daughter Mabel FitzHamon (1090‚Äì1157) to her husband Robert Fitzroy, 1st Earl of Gloucester (died 1147) and to their descendants, FitzHamon's Norman titles were inexplicably claimed to have passed to his brother Richard de Grenville as his heir male; Round points out that in fact, under ancient Norman law, titles could indeed be inherited via female lines.Round, p.153, note 71 It was from the 1661 royal warrant that the Granville family of Stowe and Bideford, who claimed to be descended from Richard, were granted licence to use these titles, even retrospectively on monuments they later erected to their ancestors. The titles were mere historical curiosities and carried no rights in the Peerage of Great Britain. Retirement and death According to Round, Richard de Grenville died after June 1142. This deduction follows from his last being recorded as having signed (as Richard de Greinvill) a charter dated \\"probably June 1142\\" as a sworn pledge giver to Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester in his treaty of alliance with Miles Earl of Hereford. By tradition Richard de Grenville is said by Prince (died 1723),Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, p.440, biography of Sir Theobald Grenvil (apparently following Fuller's Worthies)) after he had founded Neath Abbey and bestowed upon it all his military acquisitions for its maintenance, to have \\"returned to his patrimony at Bideford where he lived in great honour and reputation the rest of his days\\". However, according to Round no proof exists that Richard de Grenville ever held the manor of Bideford, which was later one of the principal seats of the Westcountry Grenville family. It was however certainly one of the constituent manors of the Honour of Gloucester granted by King William Rufus to Robert FitzHamon.\\"Round, p.139 Richard de Grenville is known to have held seven knight's fees from the Honour of Gloucester, either granted to him by his brother FitzHamon or the latter's son-in-law and heir Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (1100‚Äì1147). Round supposes instead that the Grenvilles of Bideford and Stowe were descended from a certain \\"Robert de Grenville\\" (alias de Grainville, de Grainavilla, etc.) who was a junior witness to Richard's foundation charter of Neath Abbey and who in the 1166 Cartae Baronum return was listed as holding one knight's fee from the Earl of Gloucester, feudal baron of Gloucester. Robert's familial relationship, if any, to Richard is unknown. A Grenville family pedigree dated 1639 stated that in his old age Richard undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, in which city he died. This story appears to derive from the Gwentian Chronicle or Aberporgwm Brut, which adds that he brought back from the land of Canaan a man named Lalys who was \\"well- versed in the science of architecture, who erected monasteries, castles and churches\\" and who afterwards went to London as architect to King Henry I.Round, p.137, note 23 1860 depiction at Kilkhampton 1860 imaginary depiction of Richard de Grenville (right) and his elder brother Robert FitzHamon (died 1107) (left), Kilkhampton church An imaginary depiction of Richard de Grenville and his elder brother Robert FitzHamon (died 1107)Round, pp. 130‚Äì169, 137) is contained within one of the two Granville windows by Clayton and BellChurch Guidebook, St James the Great Kilkhampton, 2012, p.11 erected in 1860 by supposed descendants of the former within the Granville Chapel of the Church of St James the Great, Kilkhampton, Cornwall.

The show travels to multiple churches across the country looking for single members of congregations looking for a partner. The congregation of the church is primarily in charge of looking at potential daters and judging which one would be the best match. The first season, sponsored by Christian Mingle, began airing on June 5, 2014. The series was later renewed for a second season, which began airing March 26, 2015. The series received mixed reviews; one critic gave the series an \\"Amen!\\" while another argued the viewers should \\"pass\\" on watching it. Ratings for the first season provided six million total viewers for the eight episodes, while the second season saw a decline in the ratings. Gameplay Natalie Grant, host of It Takes a Church The series travels to various churches and congregations to have a single, unsuspecting member of the church presented with potential suitors. Each episode begins at the setting of a church service, with host Natalie Grant appearing to introduce the show. A single member of the congregation is introduced to his or her surprise, while members of the congregation then nominate other single members of the congregation as suitors. The number of suitors is immediately narrowed down to four; they are the top three as voted by the congregation and a fourth chosen by the pastor or minister. In the first round, the single member spends time in the community (usually at a charitable event) with two suitors at a time. During this time, a group of matchmakers watches the events as they are recorded on camera. Once all four suitors have interacted with the single member, the matchmakers provide their input before the single member eliminates a suitor of his or her choice. The church's pastor moderates the second round, setting up the suitors on their own dates with the single member before spending time one-on-one with each of the suitors. The pastor then makes recommendations to the single member, who in turn eliminates another suitor. The final round consists of actual one-on-one dates between the single member and each of the suitors. After the dates, the congregation gathers to see who the single member has deemed the \\"winner,\\" while the matchmaker who originally suggested the winner at the start of the episode earns the church a $10,000 donation in his or her name. Additionally, the suitors who are not selected receive a free, one-year membership to the online dating website Christian Mingle. Production GSN first announced the show in their upfront presentation on April 9, 2013. The network then ordered eight episodes on December 17, the first of which premiered on June 5, 2014. During the first season, the series was sponsored by Christian Mingle. On August 21, 2014, the series was renewed for a second season, which premiered March 26, 2015. Reception It Takes a Church has received mixed reviews from critics. Tom Conroy of Media Life enjoyed the premiere episode, arguing that it may even attract a secular audience: \\"Even secular viewers will be curious to see which one Angela picks, and they‚Äôll get a glimpse into a subculture that is largely invisible on TV. Members of that subculture, on the other hand, will watch It Takes a Church and say, 'Amen!'\\". Contrastly, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called the series \\"utterly frivolous,\\" and called into question the \\"state of America's spiritual health\\" after watching an episode. Genzlinger also argued that the show was a not much more than a \\"desperate\\" effort to find something the conservative Christian audience will watch. Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment added that viewers should \\"pass\\" on the series, calling GSN's The American Bible Challenge a better \\"solid game format.\\" =Ratings= The series garnered over six million total viewers for its first season, posting significant gains in multiple demographics (including women ages 18‚àí49 and 25‚àí54) versus the time period the previous year. Ratings during the second season dropped significantly; the April 23, 2015 airing earned only 207,000 viewers and a 0.03 rating among adults 18‚àí49.

Early life Dube was born on 28 November 1958 in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India to a family of physicians. She completed her B. A. with honors in History from the University of Delhi in 1979. She completed her M. F. A. in Art Criticism from Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda in 1982, during a particularly productive and influential period in that university's storied Faculty of Fine Arts. Career Dube's training as an art historian at Baroda continues to influence her practice as a visual artist, as do her ties to the short-lived but extremely influential Indian Radical Painters' and Sculptors' Association, a group of predominantly Malayali contemporary artists (with Dube a rare exception) formed by K. P. Krishnakumar in Baroda in 1987 that forged an explicitly radical, socially and politically conscious approach to art making in contrast with the more figurative style of painting associated with an earlier generation of artists and faculty at Baroda. These latter were part of the so-called \\"Baroda School\\" also sometimes called the \\"narrative painters,\\" a group that came to prominence in the mid to late 1970s, and included figures such as Bhupen Khakhar, Nalini Malani, Vivan Sundaram, Jogen Chowdhury, Sudhir Patwardhan, Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh and critic Geeta Kapur. In 1987, the Indian Radical Painters and Sculptors Association, led by Krishnakumar, held an exhibition \\"Questions and Dialogue\\" at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Baroda, which was accompanied by posters around campus and a manifesto, written by Dube, denouncing the commodification of art in general, and what they saw as the lack of sincere, effective political and social engagement on the part of the \\"narrative painters.\\" Dube and her peers at Baroda were committed to a radical project of challenging a retrogressive, bourgeois-centered art industry. This entailed, among other things, a conscious shift in medium: Dube and others focused on inexpensive, industrial materials and found objects in an effort to create works that resisted commodification, connected with working-class audiences, and directed a militant critique at bourgeois notions of art making, display and consumption. Following the exhibition, the group shifted its activities to Kerala, where another exhibition was held at Kozhikode in February, 1989. Also in 1989, the group staged a demonstration and published a pamphlet excoriating a Sotheby's auction held in Mumbai that year with support from the Times of India ‚Äî still a novel concept for India's relatively quiet 1980s art market. \\"The Times of India‚Äôs sudden interest in Indian Art and Culture now shows that the Imperialists want to completely poison the people‚Äôs mind and life through antihuman projects for artists,\\" it read, adding that the exhibition's invocation of \\"Timeless\\" India was the legacy of a \\"colonialist strategy to see everything as ‚Äòtimeless‚Äô, and now the Indian ruling classes see their country with the same eyes.\\" Later work When the Indian Radical Painters and Sculptors Association disbanded in 1989, following the death of KP Krishnakumar, Dube shifted her focus from writing and criticism to making visual art, developing an aesthetic idiom that utilizes found objects and industrial materials, word play and photography in order to offer a sustained analysis and critique of existing social and political conditions in India and beyond. Philippe Vergne, in a 2003 essay, writes that Dube's work \\"privileges sculptural fragment as a cultural bearer of personal and social memories, history, mythologies and phenomenological experiences.\\" Dube's language-based sculptural work is particularly notable. She has said that she is ‚Äúinterested in how a word can become architecture‚Äù. This interest is evident in a work titled 5 Words (2007), which was included in a 2007-2008 exhibition at the Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh. Consisting of five separate pieces, 5 Words explores the fraught cross-cultural semantics and sculptural possibilities of five value-laden words that begin with the letter W. Another body of work that Dube is known for involves the use of the adhesive-backed, industrially produced ceramic eyes typically affixed to Hindu religious images. An example of this type of work is The Sleep of Reason Creates Monsters (2001), first installed at the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki, Finland, makes reference to Francisco Goya‚Äôs famous set of aquatint prints, Los Caprichos, produced between 1797 and 1798. Internationally, her work has been shown at the Mattress Factory, Pittsburgh; the Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), Contemporary Arts Museum (Houston), Museo Rufino Tamayo (Mexico City) and the Havana biennial, among others. Recent solo exhibitions have included shows at Nature Morte (Berlin; 2013); Lakeeren Gallery (Mumbai; 2013); Galerie Dominique Fiat (Paris; 2011); Bose Pacia (New York; 2008), Galerie Almine Rech (Paris; 2007), and Gallery Nature Morte (New Delhi; 2000, 2005). Her work has been included in recent group exhibitions, including shows at the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (2013), and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (2011). In 1997, Dube cofounded KHOJ, an International Artists' Association in New Delhi. What started as a relatively modest annual workshop has become a major platform for South Asian art within a global context, organizing international workshops, residencies and exhibitions.

Most notably he was the General Manager of W√§rtsil√§ and co- founder of Suomen Autoteollisuus (SAT).  Early years  Lars Wilhelm √Öberg was born in Hausj√§rvi to Senior Master Builder, Depot Manager Lars Erik √Öberg and Mathilda Maria n√©e Rosvall. He graduated in 1898 in Swedish speaking Helsingfors reallyceum in Helsinki, after which he studied engineering in Helsinki Polytechnical Institute. He graduated in 1902 after which he studied for one year in Dresden.  Career  After his graduation √Öberg worked for a number of companies. He became the manager of Helsinki City Electricity Works where he worked until 1918, when he was appointed General Manager of W√§rtsil√§ iron works. Simultaneously, he managed Ab H√§mekoski and Ab Karelia Wood. W√§rtsil√§ dived into financial trouble during √Öberg's leadership. The annual result of 1925 showed losses of 1.6 million marks; the company debt reached 46 million marks when the sales were just 16 million. In March 1926 √Öberg announced resignation, which came into force in 15. April. He was replaced by Wilhelm Wahlforss. Later it turned out that √Öberg had also hidden a remarkable gap in the inventory.Zilliacus: H√§nen Kovuutensa. p. 324‚Äì339. Already starting from 13 March √Öberg was appointed the Board Chairman of automobile coach builder Autokoritehdas. Despite of its relatively good order book, the company was continuously in lack of cash reserves. The creditors pushed the company to join its operations with its competitor Autoteollisuus-Bilindustri. This took place on 20 March 1931, when √Öberg together with Karl Arthur Nordgren and Emil Anton Winckelmann left to Ministry of Trade and Industry an application for starting a new company. This was the beginning of lorry and bus producer Suomen Autoteollisuus. √Öberg became a minority shareholder in the new company.  Personal life  √Öberg was married to Sylvi Helena n√©e Antman. The couple remained childless, and when √Öberg died in 1942, he bequeathed a large sum of money to Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences in Finland. The academy wrote a glowing obituary about him. When √Öberg's successor in W√§rtsil√§, Wilhelm Wahlforss heard about this, he tried to prevent its publishing fiercely, referring to √Öberg's neglectful leadership of the company. The obituary was eventually published, but it took place as late as in 1946.

It is part of the World Weather Research Programme and is a key component of the WMO Natural Disaster Reduction and Mitigation Programme. History THORPEX was started in 2003 with the intention of being a ten-year programme, but it continues to be active as of 2014. The 12th annual session was held at the WMO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland in March 2014. =Creation and International Science Plan (2003-04)= THORPEX was created in 2003 at the Fourteenth World Meteorological Congress under the auspices of the WMO Commission for Atmospheric Sciences (CAS) as a ten-year international research and development programme to accelerate improvements in the accuracy and the social, economic, and environmental benefits of 1-day to 2-week high-impact weather forecasts. At the time of creation, the following sub-programmes were listed in the THORPEX International Science Plan: # Global-to-regional influences on the evolution and predictability of weather systems. # Global observing-system design and demonstration. # Targeting and assimilation of observations. # Societal, economic, and environmental benefits of improved forecasts. =International Research Implementation Plan (TIP) and the creation of TIGGE= In February 2005, the THORPEX International Research Implementation Plan (TIP) was published. This plan proposed the creation of the THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE), an implementation of ensemble forecasting, and the Global Interactive Forecasting System (GIFS). In early March 2005, the first workshop devoted to TIGGE was held. The final report of the workshop laid out a plan for setting up the THORPEX TIGGE-GIFS working group as soon as possible and for setting up the infrastructure for TIGGE over the next few years, in time to contribute to proposed real-time THORPEX support for the International Polar Year field campaigns in 2007-08 and the 2008 Beijing Olympics WWRP Research and Development Project. =Further progress= TIGGE was developed and made operational over the coming years, and data from TIGGE was used in many meteorology papers. A 2010 review by Bougeault et al. surveyed the past work and future plans of TIGGE, and concluded: \\"We are convinced that the TIGGE databases will constitute a key resource for reaching the objective of THORPEX: the acceleration of the progress of the forecast skill for severe weather events from 1 day to 2 weeks ahead. This will be reached by a robust combination of research on the scientific basis of ensemble prediction, experimentation with new products, and development of new protocols and policies for data exchange across WMO Member States and across the science and application communities.\\" Another 2010 paper provided a timeline with 2008-2012 as the development phase for the Global Interactive Forecasting System (GIFS) and 2012 onward as the implementation period. In March 2014, the TIGGE-LAM (limited area model) was launched to improve on regional ensemble forecasts. Components =TIGGE= The THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble, also known as TIGGE, was envisaged in the February 2005 THORPEX International Research Implementation Plan and the groundwork for it was laid in a 2005 workshop. Its goal is to improve ensemble forecasting for the weather worldwide. Currently, the TIGGE data is available from these sources: * The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) * The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in the United States * The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) is also supposed to host a copy of TIGGE but the link is dead as of April 2014. A review of TIGGE was published in 2010. In March 2014, the TIGGE-LAM (limited area model) was launched to improve on regional ensemble forecasts. =GIFS= The Global Interactive Forecasting System (GIFS) was first described in the THORPEX International Research Implementation Plan (TIP) published in February 2005 and has since been mentioned in discussions of TIGGE as part of the next step in the evolution of ensemble forecasting after TIGGE.

Following an early access release in December 2014, the full game was released in October 2015. The game is a remake of Gollop's 1985 game Chaos: The Battle of Wizards. The remake includes a number of improvements over the original version including a role-playing meta game and the ability to buy equipment such as armour, staves, and talismans which give players a number of enhancements, such as extra spells and abilities. Gameplay A Chaos Reborn multiplayer battle The game features online and offline single player and multiplayer modes in the form of both player versus player and player versus environment experiences. Players take turns to manipulate units on a battle map with the objective of eliminating their rivals' most important unit, the wizard. If a player loses their wizard, they lose the match and all of their units are removed from the battle map. By casting spells the wizard can create new units, equip themselves with weapons, or directly attack another unit. The single-player campaign and Realm Quest mode are a narrative game world map overlay linking together a series of battles culminating in a boss battle with the player(s) pitted against a wizard king unit and a wizard unit. The mode introduces both strategy game and role-playing game elements such as capturing infrastructure, sending units to a target, hiring mercenary units to accompany the wizard unit, and resolving story driven elements. Each match can involve the player controlling a number of creature units based upon mythical and real-life animals and supernatural beings. The player may start with these creature units by using mercenaries or villagers, or add creature units per turn by casting a spell to summon them. Many of these creature units also have abilities to distinguish them from others in a more tangible way than merely by differing values such as attack rating. =Duel Mode and Forge Crystals expansion= On 25 July 2016, Snapshot Games released version 1.10 adding the new features Duel Mode and Forge Crystals. The Duel Mode of play created a single one-button click method of starting a battle against either a human or AI opponent, depending upon which was available. Winning unbroken Duels resulted in the player receiving escalating rewards in the form of Gold and Forge Crystals plus, once per day, a Talisman. The Forge Crystals could then be spent in the now unlocked to all players Equipment Forge allowing many for the first time to personalise their game character's appearance and create custom Bodygear and Staffs. = Chaos Reborn: Adventures = On September 12, 2018, mobile game developer Big Blue Bubble released a mobile port of Chaos Reborn entitled Chaos Reborn: Adventures. The game was praised by critics, receiving a gold rating by Pocket Gamer and a 5 star rating by Pocket Tactics.

Like much of the Mackinaw State Forest the region around the lake was cut over in the late 1800s for timber; exhausted land parcels were allowed to return to the public sector. The French Farm Lake State Flooding Wildlife Management Area, a unit within the State Forest that is owned and managed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (M-DNR), is a parcel of land of 2,948 acres in extent. M-DNR maintains an earthen boat ramp close to the northern end of the lake, from which boaters can launch vessels and fish for bass and pike. The surrounding wetlands are breeding grounds for mallards and wood ducks. The lake's name may be derived from a frontier farm cultivated on the lakeshore in the 18th century. The farmstead, which supplied food to Fort Michilimackinac, was excavated by archaeologists in 1981-1982. A monograph was published.

He often employs found photography and archival resources to create new photographic images, objects, installations, and videos. His work has been shown in Vienna, Berlin, Rome, London, Lisbon, and New York City, and written about in Art in America, Artforum, and The New Yorker. Background Huey was born in Traverse City, Michigan. He graduated from Amherst College in 1987 with a degree in German Studies. He has lived in Vienna since 1989, and received a master's degree in art history at the University of Vienna in 1999. He is married to the Viennese art historian Christian Witt-D√∂rring. Alongside his artistic practice, Huey has also published extensively, first as a staff member of The Christian Science Monitor, and more recently as a memoirist writing at length about his family's roots in Chicago and Leelanau County, Michigan. He is a regular and longtime contributor to the London-based magazine The World of Interiors and has written frequently about art and design for exhibition catalogues, newspapers, and magazines in both Europe and the United States. Work Huey's artistic practice has been closely tied by critics to his interest in family history and inventories. A common technique of his is to re-photograph and re-use existing, vintage photos and papers. The arts magazine EIKON has written that Huey's works \\"are like news that reaches us from the past and are kept as poetry in time.\\" According to Artforum magazine, \\"Huey's process defamiliarizes...objects to the extent that they become alien, worthy of scrutiny.\\" Huey's images have been likened by The New Yorker to the work of early photography pioneer William Henry Fox Talbot. Individual works by Huey have been displayed at the Kunsthalle Wien, the Sigmund Freud Museum in Vienna, the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, the Mead Art Museum in Amherst, Massachusetts, and the Cleveland Museum of Art. In 2014 he joined the Secession, the Viennese artists‚Äô association founded in 1897 by Gustav Klimt, Koloman Moser, Josef Hoffmann, and Joseph Maria Olbrich, among others.

Preceded by the Emirate of Kano the council was formed in 1903 after the British pacification of the Sokoto Caliphate. Ado Bayero became the emir in 1963, reigning for 50 years until his death in 2014; he oversaw the transformation of the Emirate under Nigeria's federal constitution that subjects Northern Nigeria's Emirates to political leaders. The emir of Kano serves as the leader of the Tijaniyya sufi order in Nigeria, historically the second most important Muslim position in Nigeria after the Sultan of Sokoto who is the leader of the more populous Qadiriyya sufi order in Nigeria.The Nigerian Voice: \\"ROAD TO AZARE\\" By Ajiroba Yemi Kotun 23 May 2013All Africa: \\"Nigeria: Updated - Kano Blasts Claim Over 60\\" By Ismail Mudashir 28 November 2014 History British forces captured Kano in 1903. The 7th emir of Kano, who was in Sokoto when Kano was occupied, was captured and exiled to Lokoja where he died in 1926. The British immediately made Kano an important administrative centre in Northern Nigeria. The role of the Kano Emirate steadily grew in the new Northern Nigeria. In the 1940s administrative re-organisation restored the consultative status of the ancient Taran Kano or council of Nine, this receded the status of the Emir as the Sole Native Administrator and instead made him the head of a Native Authority. Also in the 1940s Northern Nigerian agitation for independence from the South led to a national re-organisation that made Nigeria a Federation of Independent and autonomous regions Kano became the fulcrum of a new Northern political class that emerged to fight against perceived southern influence/ In 1950 the Northern Elements Progressive Union emerged in Kano as the first political party in Northern Nigeria, it was swiftly followed by the emergence of the Northern People's Congress and other smaller political parties. People paying their respects to the Emir of Kano In 1963, allegations of fraud and misappropriation were laid against the Emir of Kano Sanusi Bayero. A panel headed by D M Muffet later found evidence of misappropriation and recommended the resignation of Sanusi. Immediately afterwards, Emir Sanusi abdicated and was replaced by his uncle Inuwa Abbas who reigned for only nine months before his death. The abdication of Sanusi led to agitation of Kanoan Independence and led to the emergence of the Kano People's Party. Inuwa was succeeded by his nephew Ado Bayero who reigned for 50 years before his death on 6 June 2014. Various administrative re-organisations in Bayero's reign saw a gradual weaning of the Emir's powers. Although the Emir has limited formal powers, he continues to exert considerable authority and provides leadership on issues such as the tension between Christians and Muslims in Northern Nigeria. On 8 June 2014, former Nigerian central banker Muhammadu Sanusi II was selected to succeed Bayero as Emir of Kano. In 2019 the emirate was split into five by the Kano state government, calving off Emirates of Bichi, Karaye, Gaya and Rano, in addition to the substantially reduced Kano Emirate. Government Under the British indirect administrative structure the Emir was the sole Native Authority subordinate to the supervision of the British Colonial Resident. Hakimai (Chiefs) assisted the Emir in the administration of the Emirate and under a re-organization by Dr. Cargill the Resident of Kano province the Hakimai were posted out of the capital to the Districts as District Heads. The Cargill re-organization made each Hakimi to have a contiguous territory where he resided at the headquarters and administered on behalf of the Emir and the Jakadu were eliminated. The powerful slave officials were also not given any territories and their previous possessions were given to the free born Hakimai most of whom belonged to the Sullubawa ruling clan with one each from the Yolawa, Jobawa, Danbazawa, Sullubawan Tuta who became the Kingmakers that appoint the Emir. Commerce The British encouraged the production of commodities for export as raw materials for British industries. In Kano groundnut and cotton were encouraged. Kano Province became the largest producer of groundnut in Nigeria and by the 1960s during good harvest it was producing about half million tons of the commodity. The export of cotton was not as high as groundnut because the local textile craftsmen used it until later when their products became less competitive compared to imported items. The railway was a great facilitator of colonial economic transformation. It reached Kano in 1912 and it helped the province to maintain its economic edge over other provinces. Apart from the ease of transportation it also brought many migrant laborers and semi-skilled people from other parts of Nigeria and they formed the nucleus of Sabon Gari a new district created for them outside the city of Kano.

It is the last named tributary to join the creek and is long. The stream's watershed has an area of approximately 4.7 square miles and is located in Montour Township, Columbia County and Cooper Township, Montour County. The annual load of sediment in the watershed is , most of which comes from agricultural lands. Minnows live in the stream. A. Joseph Armstrong called the stream \\"undistinguished\\" and \\"not an impressive stream\\" in his book Trout Unlimited's Guide to Pennsylvania Limestone Streams. Course Montour Run looking downstream near its mouth (close to the village of Rupert) Montour Run begins in the western reaches of Montour Township, near the western edge of Columbia County. The headwaters are slightly south of U.S. Route 11 and near the community of Grovania. The stream flows east for a short distance and passes a landing strip, roughly following U.S. Route 11, before turning east- southeast and receiving an unnamed tributary from a quarry. Shortly after receiving the tributary, it turns east-northeast and then east. After a short distance, it turns northeast, continuing to follow U.S. Route 11. The stream passes through a pond and crosses under Pennsylvania Route 42 before turning east-southeast and reaching its confluence with Fishing Creek near Rupert. Hydrology The daily sediment load in Montour Run is . This equates to per year. A 28.2% reduction in the load would be required for the stream to meet the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's standards. Of the of sediment that flows through Montour Run per year, per year comes from croplands. comes from hay and pastures, comes from stream banks, and comes from land classified as \\"transition\\" by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Annually, of sediment in the stream comes from land classified as \\"low-intensity development\\" by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and per year comes from forests. No sediment in the watershed comes from wetlands. Most of the streams in the watershed of Montour Run do not meet the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's water quality standards, but a tributary in the northwestern reaches of the watershed do meet the standards. The average annual rainfall in the Montour Run watershed between 1976 and 1992 was . The average annual runoff during this time period was . The stream has a high water temperature. Geography and geology Montour Run looking downstream in its middle reaches, from Duessen Road The watershed of Montour Run is located in the ridge and valley physiographic region of the Appalachian Mountains. The elevation in the watershed ranges from less than to more than above sea level. 50 percent of the rock in the watershed of Montour Run is shale 25 percent is sandstone, 20 percent is interbedded sedimentary rock. The remaining 5 percent is carbonate rock. The Mahantango Formation is found in the lower reaches of the Montour Run watershed, as is the Marcellus Formation. Both of these formations are from the Middle Devonian. 95 percent of the soil in the Montour Run watershed is in the hydrologic soil group B, while 5 percent is in the hydrologic soil group C. Montour Run is wide. The banks of the stream experience erosion. Watershed Montour Run looking upstream in its middle reaches, from Duessen Road The watershed of Montour Run has an area of approximately 4.7 square miles. The watershed is in Montour Township, as well as Cooper Township, in Montour County. Agricultural land, including cropland, hay, and pastures, makes up 45.7% of the land in the watershed and forests make up 40.5% of the land. 13.1% of the land is classified as \\"low-intensity development\\" by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and 0.7% of the watershed is wetland. Hay and pastures occupy 800.6 acres of the watershed of Montour Run and 538.7 acres of the watershed are occupied by cropland. There are NWI wetlands and steep slopes on the lower reaches of Montour Run. There are of streams in the Montour Run watershed. History Montour Run is named after Madame Montour.

The drives were defined by their fusion of the fight for worker‚Äôs rights with the battle for racial equality. The first drive in 1974 was characterized by unity amongst the workers involved, including members of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Local 77, and a strong spirit of activism, but failed due to political infighting and resistance by the University.Tony Dunbar. \\"The Old South Triumphs at Duke.\\" Southern Changes, 1, no. 9 (1979): 5. The second drive, organized by a representative of the national American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) in 1978, was formed on the ideals of inclusion and keeping the union free of politics. The 1978 drive failed as well, in part due to the management company that Duke hired to instill fear in its workers, and partly due to the overall lack of spirit for organizing. Despite the failure of these drives, they offer a revealing example of the convergence of civil rights and workers rights, highlighting both the status of the civil rights movement in Durham and the difficulty of instigating grassroots-level change in a corporation the size of Duke Hospital, not to mention larger Duke University community.  Historical context  Labor militancy in hospitals throughout the United States witnessed significant increases in the 1950s through the mid-1970s.Karen Brodkin, Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 13.Ruth Milkman. Women, Work, and Protest: A Century of US Women‚Äôs Labor History. (Boston, MA: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1985), 287. This was largely the result of the contradiction between the expansion of clerical and technical jobs and the exclusion of black and unskilled workers from those jobs. Beginning in the North in the late 1950s and 1960s, the movement was characterized by the refusal of black, Hispanic, and women workers to settle for wages below the national minimum.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 14. Because these employees were centered at urban medical complexes, this dissatisfaction sparked a nationwide movement in the unionization of hospital and public workers. Southern workers expanded upon this sentiment, intentionally melding issues of class and economic justice with those of workers‚Äô rights.Tony Dunbar, \\"The Old South Triumphs at Duke,\\" Southern Changes, 1, no. 9 (1979): 5-8. Southern racism and anti-union leanings characterized Durham in the 1950s-1970s. Espousing the views of a traditional Southern community at the time, Durham, North Carolina held the sentiment that a \\"Negro must be kept in his place.\\"Robert Creamer. \\"Duke Employees Local 77: Confrontation over Impartial Arbitration of Grievances.\\" (Master‚Äôs Thesis, Duke University, 1967), 3. Of all industries, the textile industry was most opposed to unions, and Durham was home to numerous textile mills. In fact, many of the key supporters of Duke University, one of Durham‚Äôs major employers, had close ties to this industry. In combination with the weak position of labor in Southern communities, the prevalence of textile mills served as a basis for Durham‚Äôs quiet, yet prevalent anti-unionist attitude. Duke University demonstrated both the anti-union and racist attitudes of Durham while holding the power of a large corporation. Historically, blacks were confined to non- or semi-skilled jobs. While this can be partially attributed to lack of proper qualifications, Duke‚Äôs Vice President in charge of Business and Finance, Charles B. Huestis, openly admitted that Duke \\"practice[d] wholesale racial discrimination in its hiring policies.\\" The salaries of these non-skilled workers reflected additional inequality, as maids and janitors, all who were black, received wages between $1.15-1.50 per hour‚Äî well below the minimum wage of $1.60.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 50-52. Workers were also disadvantaged in other regards, as the University had no grievance procedure, policy for summer layoffs, or job classification system. Furthermore, the University ignored the seniority system in terms of job advancement and firing procedures. Suppressing workers‚Äô voices in the formation of workplace policies, Duke encouraged unskilled employees to simply make complaints, which their superiors then ignored.Robert Creamer. \\"Duke Employees Local 77: Confrontation over Impartial Arbitration of Grievances.\\" (Master‚Äôs Thesis, Duke University, 1967), 4-7. Thus, the poor working conditions, low wages, racism, and desire to secure more authority and control in the workplace provided sufficient fuel for Duke workers to consider forming a union.  Immediate context  The unionization movement at the University began with a single night janitor, Oliver Harvey, who aligned the fight for unionization with the fight for civil rights from the start. Harvey, a veteran supporter of civil rights, spent a significant portion of his life striving to improve working conditions at Duke.Robert Creamer. \\"Duke Employees Local 77: Confrontation over Impartial Arbitration of Grievances.\\" (Master‚Äôs Thesis, Duke University, 1967), 7. Given his history of working to secure rights for blacks in the workplace, Harvey added a new sense of urgency to the fight for representation in the workplace.Greene, Christina. Our separate ways: women and the Black Freedom Movement in Durham, North Carolina. (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2005), 106. Prior to Harvey‚Äôs leadership, workers primarily utilized petitions to pressure Duke administration. After actively recruiting signatures for a petition campaign to increase wages in 1964 and receiving no response from the University administration, Harvey realized that new tactics would be necessary.Robert Creamer. \\"Duke Employees Local 77: Confrontation over Impartial Arbitration of Grievances.\\" (Master‚Äôs Thesis, Duke University, 1967), 8. Aiming to receive acknowledgement from the University, he organized the Duke Employees Benevolent Society in February 1965 and initiated a shift in the way his coworkers thought about unionizing. Considering issues in more collective terms under Harvey‚Äôs leadership, the Society affiliated with the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) on September 1, 1965 as the Local 77. While the organization grew in membership, it struggled unsuccessfully for two years to win benefits from the University and failed to gain full recognition by Duke until 1972.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 56. In hopes of preventing the unionization of all medical center workers, Duke allowed some hospital workers to vote in the election for the union recognition of Local 77.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 55-56. As demonstrated by the later unionization drives of 1974 and 1978, these efforts to stifle collective action in the hospital were futile. Duke began to pay attention to the complaints of its workers after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Inspired by King‚Äôs support of worker‚Äôs rights, students launched a demonstration supporting wage increases and collective bargaining rights for Duke‚Äôs nonacademic employees, most of whom were maids, janitors, and cafeteria workers.Carter, Luther. \\"Duke University: Students Demand New Deal for Negro Workers.\\" Science, May 3, 1968: 513-517. The demonstration involved a four-day \\"silent vigil\\" by over 2000 students on the main quad of the University. The Local 77 then decided to strike, and all members left their jobs except for hospital workers. After two weeks of employee strikes and student boycotts of classes and on-campus dining, Duke Trustees finally agreed to address the grievances of the unskilled workers, but did not grant any wage increases or implement any policy changes in the end. Despite the slow progress at Duke, labor unions in Durham made more tangible progress towards improved working conditions. Within a year or two of initial efforts, the starting pay for housekeepers rose.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 59. Split shifts ended as a result of collective bargaining, and when campus dining halls closed for summer, workers were no longer automatically fired. In many industries, employees gained health insurance, credit unions, overtime pay, paid sick days, and regular paid holidays. These advancements in the rights and wages of many workers were significant, but hospital workers had little hope until the amendment of the National Labor Relations Act in 1974.  Unionization drive of 1974  The unionization drive of 1974 marked the first instance of collective action amongst large numbers of service workers in Duke Medical Center. Energized with the spirit of activism and strong desire to gain influence in the workplace, employees worked vigorously against University resistance towards unionization.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 105-109. In the fall of 1974, an amendment to the National Labor Relations Act permitted the employees of nonprofit hospitals to unionize.\\"1974 Health Care Amendments.\\" National Labor Relations Board, accessed April 4, 2014, http://www.nlrb.gov/75th/index.html . In addition to activist initiatives from individuals, the amendment inspired a Local 77 drive to unionize all service workers in the Duke Medical Center.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 70-74. The drive eventually failed due to political divisions amongst organizers coupled with Duke‚Äôs desire to strike down unionization efforts, but the level of activism in the drive allowed Duke medical center workers to glimpse the strength of united action.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 108-116. A significant walkout in early 1974 by data terminal operators (DTOs) exemplified the power of collective action and provided motivation for the drive. DTOs fulfilled a position that was the rough equivalent of a black secretary, and the workforce was composed exclusively of women.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 78-81. The DTOs at Duke felt as though their wages were unreasonably low and that this implied a lack of respect for their skills. Furthermore, they were fed up with the prevalent racism they encountered on a daily basis in the hospital. After several meetings, the DTOs successfully organized a walkout that not only demonstrated to the hospital their necessity, but also allowed the women to realize their own power. In response, the administration raised their wages, gave them days off, and increased the size of the DTO workforce.Article on Hospital Workers Walkout. The Herald Sun (Durham, NC), April 14, 1974. Duke University Archives, Duke University.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 100. The walkout proved extremely effective and marked the first instance of collective action supporting the rights of hospital workers at Duke Medical Center. Upon this clear victory, Local 77 recruited Howard Fuller as an organizer, which reflected the inextricable ties between the civil rights movement and the drive to unionize. Howard Fuller became a symbol of the fight for civil rights as he dedicated his life towards integrating schools, supporting nonviolence, and creating opportunity for blacks.Sarah Barber. \\"Never stop working: Examining the life and activism of Howard Fuller.\\" Master‚Äôs Thesis, The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 2012. Thus, his participation in the hospital unionization gave the drive a political undertone. Under his leadership, the drive to unionize made its first public appearance. In late 1974, Duke began working to shift paydays so that workers would receive compensation for only 25.5 paychecks instead of 26.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 104. In a university- and community-wide response, Local 77, 465 (the maintenance worker‚Äôs union), the DTO Association, the New American Movement, and the Duke Workers Alliance united in protest. Bringing together employees from a vast array of departments and disciplines, the coalition, aided by the effective leadership of Fuller, shocked the University into halting pay schedule adjustment plans immediately.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 104-105. This event signified a vital turning point in hospital-worker relations as Duke finally recognized the power and authority of the workers. The drive to unionize the medical center relied heavily on developing initial strength and unity between members. One-on-one interactions ensured personalization in the process and created solidarity between the organizers and members of the drive.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 105-106. The primary factor that drew many individuals to the union was the fact that it represented the synthesis of inequalities in the workplace with those of race and class, as it was one of the few non-segregated unions in the area.Robert Creamer. ‚ÄúDuke Employees Local 77: Confrontation over Impartial Arbitration of Grievances.‚Äù (Master‚Äôs Thesis, Duke University, 1967), 8-9. To garner initial support, the drive relied on publicly showcasing the advantages of unionization through addressing the complaints of individuals, leaflet campaigns, publicizing grievances, rallies, and wearing buttons.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 105-107. The workers‚Äô success depended mostly on their agreement on the methods of achieving that success, especially through personal contact and maintaining a tight-knit network. While these efforts effectively mobilized support, the union had no affiliation with any international organization. The lack of international support caused funding to be a constant issue, and required careful planning on the part of the union to make the most of their budget. Although the growing union provided a source of excitement and hope for many hospital workers, Duke Hospital did not respond favorably. By promoting an anti-union stance amongst supervisors and administrative personnel and creating leaflets depicting the evils of unionism, Duke made its views regarding the union clear. The hospital argued that a union vote proved harmful to the workers as it implied their \\"ingratitude\\" and \\"lack of faith.\\"Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 107. Duke did not intimidate the grassroots-level drive, however, as by June 1975, Local 77 generated a substantial number of show-of- interest cards and petitioned the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for a union election.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 108-109. Their petition listed approximately 1000 employees from disciplines across all service sectors in the hospital, from DTOs to EKG technicians, revealing the growing specialization within the medical field.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 109-111. By excluding office clerical workers, notably secretaries, the union-proposed bargaining unit included mostly black employees. Duke, acting consistently with their anti-union stance, wanted the NLRB to dismiss the petition on the grounds that it excluded a multitude of clerical and technical workers, suggesting that if any petition were to pass, it should include these employees in addition to those in the service sector. As those workers outside of the service sector were less concerned with unionization, the addition of clerical and technical staff to the bargaining unit would grant Duke more control over the unionization drive. Although the NLRB did not rule in Duke‚Äôs favor, the board gave the medical center the upper hand, quashing the unionizing spirit of the drive. In November 1975, the regional hearing concluded that, while the bargaining unit proposed by the union was valid, Duke was correct in that 900-1000 clerical workers should be added. The addition of approximately 1000 white, clerical workers (who had no interest in unionization) to the bargaining unit diluted the strength of the union. As a result, the union submitted a request for national review of the decision, preparing arguments regarding skill level, education, the function of secretaries as private employees rather than hospital clericals, and the commonality of interest among the original members of the union. The review process caused a delay in the determination of the composition of the bargaining unit for another year, hampering union activity in a time when it had reached its apex.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 111-113. The unforeseen halt in organization activities caused by the pending NLRB decision allowed ample time for political factions to begin causing cracks in the foundation of what was once a strong union. Despite the fact that union organizers initially agreed to keep politics removed from efforts to unionize, the increased presence of political differences proved divisive and ultimately detrimental to the unionization drive. In the political sphere, the local branches of the Communist Workers Collective (CWC) and Revolutionary Workers League (RWL) held different views on how cultural and class differences and racism in organizing should be handled. The CWC was accused of using the drive for the sole purpose of gathering political support, while the RWL faced allegations of propagating the false idea that unionization would solve all of the workers‚Äô problems. Thus, when the NLRB held the union election on November 16, 1976, the union faced a loss by a margin of 59 votes (743-684).Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 114. The political infighting amongst activists contributed to destabilizing union support, but the failure of the drive cannot be attributed solely to politics. The inclusion of a majority or near-majority of white workers in the bargaining unit overwhelmed the votes of the mostly black service workers who had spent many years organizing.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 115-116. Furthermore, the multiple postponements of the NLRB decision allowed organization efforts to slow and lose energy. The loss did not simply affect the union as a whole, as many individuals avoided involvement in future unionization drives, as they were tired of \\"being pulled in two different directions.\\"Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 116. This diminished momentum had extreme implications for the unionization drive of 1978.  Unionization drive of 1978  The efforts to begin another unionization drive began between 1974-1976, soon after the previous drive ended. While the issues involved in the second drive paralleled those of the last‚Äîlow wages, lack of benefits, unfair grievance procedures, racism against a workforce that was nearly 60% black‚Äîthis drive prioritized a depoliticized atmosphere to avoid the infighting of the last drive.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 143. The second drive was organized in a more bureaucratic manner than the first as a representative from the international AFSCME led the organization efforts.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 146-147. Thus, the context in which the second drive was coordinated contributed to the use of new tactics. Like the drive of 1974, the second drive failed, but this time as a result of employees‚Äô fear of Duke and a lack of fervor in unionization efforts.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 145-149. Rose Gattis, a notable organizer from the previous drive, worked to revitalize the unionization spirit and mobilize workers in the summer of 1977.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 144-146. Gattis secured over 300 show-of-interest cards and then gained the support of the International AFSCME in the form of a representative. After several months, the AFSCME withdrew upon deciding it was too early to petition the NLRB again. Yet, by August 1978, Gattis had gathered over 900 show-of-interest cards, the AFSCME sent organizer Harold Sloan to Durham to aid the campaign, and the NLRB agreed to hold an election for a union vote on February 16, 1979. As Sloan worked with local organizers to create a powerful campaign, Duke wielded its corporate power and began secretly working with a consulting firm, Modern Management Methods (3M). 3M aimed to maximize efficiency and improve overall management within the hospital, claiming to save Duke a significant sum of money while charging $500‚Äì$700 a day per consultant.Tony Dunbar, ‚ÄúThe Old South Triumphs at Duke,‚Äù Southern Changes, 1, no. 9 (1979): 6. In truth, 3M worked to instill fear within the minds of hospital employees and stressed that they, as Management, expected anti-union support from the workers.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 147-148. Additionally, Duke distributed volumes of intimidating leaflets and exposed the high salaries of AFSCME workers. 3M also managed to convince many workers that if the union went on strike, they would face terminal unemployment.Tony Dunbar, ‚ÄúThe Old South Triumphs at Duke,‚Äù Southern Changes, 1, no. 9 (1979): 8. Duke was, at the time, in the process of building a new hospital wing priced at $92 million‚Äîan addition that the corporation prioritized over improving working conditions for its employees. For the University, unionization meant higher costs to employ unskilled workers, which the corporation could not afford if they hoped to achieve their goal of expansion. Even President Terry Sanford, who usually acted as a friend to unions, took a stance against the drive, as he \\"urg[ed] [faculty] to oppose AFSCME on the grounds that wage increases for hospital workers might compete with faculty salaries and that a hospital union would inevitably result in a strike to the detriment of patient care.\\"Tony Dunbar, \\"The Old South Triumphs at Duke,\\" Southern Changes, 1, no. 9 (1979): 7. Although Duke previously tolerated some unions like Local 77, the hospital drive threatened the hospital‚Äôs monetary interests, and, as a result, Duke was strongly opposed. As Duke worked against the drive, Sloan aimed to organize a union free of political influence and focused on the inclusion of a wide variety of employees. He believed that winning the election required involving all individuals in the \\"collective struggle.\\"Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 152. Although the focus on unity clouded the racially charged, anti-segregation sentiments of the first drive, workers believed it might eventually give them union representation. Depoliticizing the drive meant refraining from methods that could offend white technical or clerical workers as well as including some secretaries and many white workers in unionization efforts.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 150-151. Prevented from publicizing individual grievances because they were centered on race, the second drive failed to generate as much support as the first. As a result, while Sloan was able to gather support from a wide variety of individuals and avoid divisive politics, the urgency and motivation that characterized the 1974-1976 drive was absent in the second.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 149-154. In the end, Duke‚Äôs intimidation schemes and the general lack of spirit undermined the drive. By February 16, 1979, workers rejected the union in a 995-761 vote, resulting in a margin four times the size of that in 1976.  Short-term impact  Entering the 1980s, the spirit of activism that characterized the hospital unionization drives had died down, marking a twenty-year low in organizing.Karen Brodkin. Caring By The Hour (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 161-163. The hospital had wielded its power and showed that grassroots movements, regardless of organization strategy, lacked authority in the face of corporations such as Duke. Workers were dejected, and as time passed, black workers were continually pushed to lower positions within the workplace. Furthermore, women filled a proportionally higher number of positions with low-wages and worsening conditions in the medical center. While some workers, namely nurses, became particularly militant, they did not work to organize for quite some time. Although unskilled workers gained a voice during the unionization drives of the prior decade, they resigned to Duke‚Äôs stifling power and did not again attempt large-scale drives within the medical center. While Duke permitted the formation of Local 77 and tolerated other unionization efforts, the medical center drives threatened the University economically. Consequently, Duke favored its own needs over those of its workers.  Long-term significance  As recent as 1997, Duke Hospital has continued to employ a disproportionate concentration of black workers at the bottom of the workforce ladder.Jeff Zimmerman. ‚ÄúDuke, Durham Regional face race card - Pending alliance brings employee issue to forefront.‚Äù The Herald- Sun (Durham, NC), May 18, 1997. While the representation of black workers within the entirety of Duke hospital mirrored that of blacks within the Durham County (approximately 40%), \\"black employees made up 11-15% percent of the hospitals‚Äô top job category\\" and 79-89% of service jobs. While numbers regarding the racial composition of Duke Hospital‚Äôs service sector are publicly unavailable, it is clear that, as of 1997, the representation of minorities in management positions could be improved. Over the years, Duke has maintained its anti-union stance, especially within the medical center. North Carolina‚Äôs status as a right-to-work state renders unionization difficult, and Duke makes unionization even more challenging. In 2000, the International Union of Operating Engineers held a union drive for nurses in Duke hospital. During this campaign, many nurses claimed that Duke supported the voting rights of nurses who were \\"initially not included in the vote,\\" may not \\"understand related grievances [of bedside professionals],\\" and would \\"likely vote no.\\"Tessa Lyons. ‚ÄúRally champions nurses' union.‚Äù The Chronicle (Durham, NC), Sept. 16, 2000. Just as in the drive of 1974, the inclusion of these less involved nurses in the vote weakened union support. The NLRB held mixed opinions on whether the hospital was involved in unfair labor practices, but Duke was found guilty of trying to convince nurses that unionization would lead to a reduction of benefits. As history would predict, the union lost the vote. Similarly, in 2002, Constance Donahue, a registered nurse, was fired from Duke Hospital. While the hospital claimed she was fired for negligence, she argues that she was fired because she tried to initiate unionization efforts amongst nurses.Alex Garinger. ‚ÄúDurham judge allows suit by nurse, not link to union.‚Äù The Chronicle (Durham, NC), Feb. 16, 2003. While a Durham judge reached a split decision regarding Donahue‚Äôs case, the incident raises questions about Duke‚Äôs approach to dealing with unions.

While at R.P.I., he, along with seven other men, founded the Theta Xi fraternity. As a civil engineer, Brainerd worked for the then-City of Brooklyn in the position of Deputy Water Purveyor ‚Äî a position he held for 17 years (1869 to 1886). During this time, Brainerd published the 48-page book The Water Works of Brooklyn (1873). George Brainerd died on April 13, 1887, at 12:00 pm in Brooklyn. He is buried in an unknown plot in Old Rock Landing Cemetery in Haddam, Connecticut.Ricardo, Alex (2004). \\"George Bradford Brainerd\\", Find a Grave online memorial (9537170) with biographical profile and related photographs created September 30, 2004. Retrieved May 1, 2017. He suffered from an acute throat infection in the mid-1880s and had a brain tumor, which led to a stroke and paralysis. Smoking and frequent exposure to toxic photography chemicals likely contributed to the development of his tumor. Works Brainerd's work as an amateur photographer began when he was just 13 years old. He began by making his own cameras and developing ambrotypes from them. While working as a civil engineer, Brainerd photographed public work projects, as well as street scenes in Brooklyn. He also took extensive photographs of areas in New York State, including on Long Island and along the Hudson River. His subjects included houses, churches, mills, railroad stations, gate houses, reservoirs, harbors, beaches, and ponds, among others. Over the years, Brainerd continued to design his own cameras and photographic techniques. Through his inventions he was able to photograph the human vocal organs, thus contributing to the perfection of this type of medical photography. As an amateur natural historian, he amassed a large collection of bird skins, shells, and minerals, as well as maintained his own herbarium, and collected moss and lichens. Brainerd, a lifelong Brooklynite, produced a total of 2,500 photographs before his death at age 41 in 1887. The majority of his surviving images are of Brooklyn, a vast documentation of the urban landscape‚Äîdams and mills, bridges and train depots, engine houses and pumping stations‚Äîbut also, especially after 1880, images of city dwellers and street scenes. Independently wealthy and the Deputy Water Purveyor for the City of Brooklyn, Brainerd was an advanced amateur photographer adept at exploring new techniques. His legacy remains in the Brooklyn Museum, with about 1,900 of his glass-plate negatives making up a large portion of the museum's huge collection of Brooklyn- and New York-themed glass-plate negatives.

Launched in October 2013, AUP is built on the legacy of the defunct printing firm and publishing house of the same name, which existed from 1900-1996. Unlike the defunct AUP, which worked closely with the University of Aberdeen while remaining a legally separate entity, the new AUP is directly affiliated with the University. AUP's earliest progenitor was established in 1840 in Aberdeen, Scotland. It existed as a private firm, Arthur King and Co. until 1900 when the public company, Aberdeen University Press was created to acquire it. AUP's business history stayed local until 1970; then from 1970 until AUP's liquidation in 1996, the company was tossed between a number of corporate giants. For most of its existence AUP operated primarily as a printing firm; up until the 1980s, its publications list consisted of only the occasional commissioned title. Predecessors The origins of AUP can be sought in a small short-lived printing firm founded by brothers George and Robert King, which operated between 1840-1850 in the city of Aberdeen. Shortly after the brothers' printing business ceased and their Diamond Street storefront became a bookstore, a third King brother, Arthur, set up his own printing venture in the city: Arthur King and Co. \\"Statements concerning the machinery held by King & Co. in the 1860s and later are somewhat inconsistent, but it appears that from the middle of that decade, it owned a large, double- quad platen, and two (later, three) Wharfedale machines (cylinder presses) of varying sizes.\\" The firm was a well-established printing house by the time Arthur's son sold Arthur King and Co. in 1872. The firm \\"did much jobbing work, and for many years had printed the Aberdeen Free Press and produced a great many papers, announcements and notices relating to the expansion of the railway system into the North and North-East of Scotland.\\" The new owners were: John Thomson, former compositor and later foreman in the case room of the Aberdeen Journal, Alexander Troup, a wholesale bookseller and stationer, and a Mr. Mackenzie. Over the next fifteen years, Thomson bought out his partners, becoming sole owner of the profitable enterprise. Arthur King and Co. grew at strong clip throughout the period; the number of employees increased from 21 in 1872, to 66 in 1887, to 118 by 1894. The firm was sufficiently competitive to undertake work for metropolitan publishers, despite the distance from Aberdeen to the centers of the British publishing world: Glasgow, Edinburgh, and London. Emergence as AUP Aberdeen University Press sprung into being in 1900, \\"fully formed, fully functional, and capitalised to the tune of ¬£54,000.\\" AUP was formed as a public company to acquire Arthur King and Co. In an illustration of the close relations between AUP and the University of Aberdeen, (Sir) William Ramsay, Professor of Humanity at the university was installed as the first chairman of the board of the company. Cross-pollination between the two entities continued when James Trail, Professor of Botany joined the board in 1907, and the University Librarian, P. J. Anderson, in 1921. John Thomson continued as a member of the corporate board until his death in 1911. According to an 1899 internal review of Arthur King and Co. conducted to prepare the firm for its new existence as AUP, the firm's equipment holdings included 1,300 iron chasses, 10 American- built Miehle 2-revolution presses, 6 Wharfedale, and 2 jobbing machines. Besides printing equipment, AUP also inherited 3 type-casting machines and a vast collection of type; over 600 tons worth, including Russian, German, Bengali, Greek, and Hebrew. Rather than purchasing typesets as many other printers did, John Thomson had preferred the firm to maintain its own type foundry. This arrangement was beneficial for the company, as Thomson explained in an article in the British Printer in 1904: \\"We can cast nearly all the type we want, and at much less than the typefounders can sell it to us. Why, we gain close on 50% on the type account.\\" World War I critically impacted this arrangement. With wartime scarcity, the price of metals increased to the point that AUP could not afford the required lead and antimony. The resultant drop in quality of AUP's type metal and increase in printing prices began to impact their customer base, as in 1917 when John Long Ltd. informed the AUP board that they could no longer place printing orders with the company. The period between 1914 and 1920 was difficult for AUP. This was the result of two sets of factors: general industry conditions caused by World War I, increased commodity prices and the overall depression in the trade, as well as factors unique to AUP. A 1916 valuation of the company's type and machinery revealed that they had previously been vastly overstated, and much of the equipment needed to be replaced. This put the board in the embarrassing position of having to obtain agreement from the shareholding to devalue the company's shares. At the same time, AUP was also dealing with issues on the labor front. Firstly, there was the simple shortage of able-bodied men. Due to this labor shortage, though AUP was a defiantly non-union shop, the company \\"had got itself into an ultimately unsustainable and unsympathetic position, in that every time there was a wage increase ‚Äì either a general increase, or a War Bonus ‚Äì agreed between union shops, the unions themselves, and employers‚Äô federations, the firm was obliged to match it, for fear of losing valuable and skilled staff to other printers.\\" Post-WWI Period Though there was optimism in the initial postwar period, for most of the 1920s business was erratic for AUP. The company had a handful of dutiful customers and seemed to have a close relationship with the John Rylands Library and the Manchester University Press, but periods of steady productivity were few and far between. AUP was not the only struggling Aberdeen-based printing company. Negotiations between AUP and the Rosemount Press ended with the decision to merge. \\"AUP was predominately a book and journal printer, whilst the Rosemount Press carried out considerably more jobbing and general commercial work. Complementarity, therefore, was seen as the best way to business survival.\\" World War II brought to AUP a cautious market and a labor vacuum. However, these conditions‚Äîthe fragility of the market, scarcity of qualified labor, and the rationing of paper and metals‚Äîwere felt across the entire British printing industry. Due to these conditions, profits dipped during the early years of the war. However, in 1941, the company noted that the volume of work had increased, \\"a considerable number of reprint orders having come in as a result of the destruction of printed stocks by recent enemy action in London.\\" From the postwar period until 1970, AUP maintained a pattern of comfortable growth and small-scale absorptions: William Jackson Ltd. in 1950; John Avery & Co. (the Greyfriars Press), a firm of general printers, in 1953; Edmond & Spark, stationers and bookbinders, in 1966. Later existence AUP's post-1970 existence can be read as a tale of the consolidation of the British printing industry. From 1970 until its demise, AUP was passed from corporate giant to corporate giant. Riding the wave of consolidation, the British Bank of Commerce acquired AUP in 1970. The bank's small acquisition spree continued with Central Press Ltd. and George Cornwall and Sons Ltd. between 1970 and 1972, fully integrating each new firm with AUP. Between 1970 and 1978, AUP was acquired and sold by three investment groups: Brandt Ltd., Grindlays Holdings, and Spey Investments, before landing with Pergamon Press in January 1978. Significantly different from earlier corporate deals, AUP's acquisition by Pergamon Press meant that rather than being anonymous object within an investment company's curio cabinet, AUP was now among family, an important piece of a conglomerate rooted in the printing and publishing industries. Iain Beavan, in his recently published history of AUP noted that \\"Harold Watt, as Managing Director of AUP is reliably reported to have admitted that, against a background of adverse trading conditions and rapid technological advances, AUP would not have survived had it not have been for the support of Pergamon Press and Robert Maxwell.\\" This support was made clear in Pergamon Press's bold plan to rehabilitate the firm: AUP's printing shop was to be vastly modernized, transferring the majority of work from hot metal typesetting and letterpress printing to photo-composition and lithographic printing, and AUP's publishing side was to be developed, with the goal of making AUP the conglomerate's signature Scottish academic and educational imprint. The modernization of AUP's printing shop meant that, while some employees were re-trained on the new machines, many more employees were laid off as their jobs were made redundant. The painfulness of this process inevitably slowed the pace of Pergamon's modernization scheme. Unlike the modernization of AUP's printing shop, the other half of Pergamon's rehabilitation plan‚Äìthe development of AUP's publishing side‚Äìproved swift and successful. In 1979 AUP published 1 title; in 1980, 3; by 1988, 38 titles. AUP's publishing arm benefited from its narrow focus on Scottish academic and scholarly titles. The publication of the Concise Scots Dictionary after its rejection by three other publishers was a point of pride for AUP; it became a best-seller at the Edinburgh International Book Festival that year. While its acquisition by Pergamon enabled AUP to modernize and rehabilitate, these boons did not come without drawbacks. The success of AUP's publishing arm overwhelmed AUP's printing arm, to the extent that the corporate board questioned in 1989 whether AUP Publishing should look elsewhere for its own printing needs. AUP's printing arm was wracked with instability throughout the 1980s. AUP's initial acquisition by Pergamon caused discomfort among many among the Aberdeen firm's long-time customer base. AUP's neutrality and independence was in question, as it was now owned by a very real competitor to many of AUP's former clients. With local publishing houses shifting away and local artisans being laid off, AUP's links to the local Aberdeen community were becoming increasingly fraught. Though the printing business was unstable and AUP's relationship with the Aberdeen community fraught, these were not the ultimate factors behind AUP's demise. Death was a top-down affair. In 1982, at the command of Robert Maxwell Pergamon Press was integrated into the British Printing and Communication Corporation, creating the Pergamon-BPCC Group, with the ultimate parent company being Maxwell Communications Corporation. In 1986 AUP was sold to another Maxwell company, before being re-sold back to Pergamon-BPCC. In 1991, the Pergamon Group, minus AUP, was sold to Elsevier This left AUP tethered to the fortunes of Robert Maxwell and his publishing empire. After the death of Maxwell in November 1991, the extent of his corporation's debt was discovered. In the ensuing legal mess, AUP was liquidated in 1996. Resurrection In October 2013, the University of Aberdeen announced the re-launch of Aberdeen University Press, as a traditional university press directly affiliated with the University. Though the new AUP is positioned by the University as the successor to the defunct printing firm and publishing house of the same name liquidated in 1996, the two publishing houses are distinct and legally separate entities; only the thread of historical narrative connects the two entities. It is unclear who owns the copyrights to the defunct AUP's backlist titles. With the launch of the University of Aberdeen's first official university press, the administration hopes to communicate the University's research output to a wider audience while increasing institutional prestige on the global stage. The first title published was Taking Part in Music: Case Studies in Ethnomusicology, released in 2013 by the Elphinstone Institute. The next volume will be Vita Mea, the autobiography of Scottish literary scholar and Aberdeen alumnus, Sir Herbert Grierson.

She served primarily as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named for Kirkland Lake, Ontario. Originally named St. Jerome, she was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River-class building program. She was laid down on 16 November 1943 by Morton Engineering & Dry Dock Co. at Quebec City and launched 27 April 1944. Her name was changed to Kirkland Lake and she was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 21 August 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. War service After working up in Bermuda in November 1944, Kirkland Lake was assigned to escort group EG 16 based out of Derry. She spent various periods based out of Portsmouth and Derry, escorting convoys to Gibraltar in May 1945. She returned to Canada in June 1945 to undergo a tropicalization refit in preparation for service in the southern Pacific Ocean. This meant installing water-cooling and refrigeration abilities and changing the camouflage pattern. The refit was done at Quebec City and completed 5 November 1945. By this time, Japan had surrendered and the war was over. Kirkland Lake was paid off 14 December 1945 at Halifax and laid up in Bedford Basin. She was sold in 1947 for disposal and taken to Sydney, Nova Scotia to be broken up. References ;Notes ;References *Macpherson, Ken; Burgess, John.

This theory postulates that the receiver takes an active role in persuading himself or herself to change his or her attitude or behavior. Unlike the direct technique of Persuasion, Self-persuasion is indirect and entails placing people in situations where they are motivated to persuade themselves to change. More specifically what characterizes a self-persuasion situation is that no direct attempt is made to convince anyone of anything. Thus, with self-persuasion, people are convinced that the motivation for change has come from within, so the persuasion factors of another person's influence is irrelevant. Therefore, Self-persuasion is almost always a more powerful form of persuasion (deeper, longer lasting) than the more traditional persuasion techniques. Self- Persuasion, also has an important influence in Social judgment theory, Elaboration Likelihood Model, Cognitive Dissonance and Narrative paradigm. History Self-Persuasion came about based on the more traditional or direct strategies of persuasion, which have been around for at least 2,300 years and studied by eminent social psychologists from Aristotle to Carl Hovland, that focused their attention on these three principal factors: the nature of the message, the characteristics of the communicator, and the characteristics of the audience. It wasn't until later that the theory of self-persuasion was developed by Dr. Carl Hovland, of Psychology, who had conducted studies during his time at Yale University during the 1940s and '50s. His argument in creating the concept of self-persuasion was that the factors within us determine our decision making; for example, one's own personality, self- esteem, education, or interest.Persuasion: Theoretical and practical concerns, Available: http://www.uky.edu/CommInfoStudies/JAT/Telecommunications/hertog/520/lectures/Persuasion2.ppt Motivation How can motivation and self-persuasion be connected? Webster defines motivation as the act or process of giving someone a reason for doing something: the act or process of motivating someone. Motivation involving self-persuasion pertains to the ability to motivate oneself for a higher reason or rewards. Convincing a person to believe in your belief can be a challenge, however, trying to convince yourself is all together another effort and challenge. Persuasion allows the mind the ability to be persuaded for reasons that exist for beneficial factors. Consider this: if you conquer your fears, would you consider this a giant feat or success? Through self- persuasion along with motivation, many people are able to tackle their fears, which in turn allow them to move to the next level or simply a higher level within society. Self-persuasion permits a person's mind the ability to be influenced or persuaded if they choose so. The mind through persuasion can also deny or resist if it so chooses, regardless of self-persuasion. Self- persuasion is directly related to processes of a person's own mind and the influence of motivation the mind perceives. People would rather listen to themselves than to other people normally, except for those people that are indecisive. When people are trying to convince themselves or be persuaded into changing their mind, it can sometimes involves motivation or the act of motivation. People will listen to themselves and will automatically generate arguments that have personal relevance for them.T. Millon & M. J. Lerner (Eds.), Comprehensive handbook of psychology (2nd ed). New York: John Wiley & Sons. It might sound crazy to some people, but people are being encouraged to persuade themselves all the time and many of these times are through motivation intensity. As people know, motivation can be a driving ambition that can easily sway people based on reward, self-persuasion through motivation can achieve great results. Encouraging a person to change their mind through motivation can be attributed to levels of acceptance through a variety of levels of motivation. A good example would be if a parent informs their child to do well in school and if levels of success are achieved, then rewards will follow. This is an example of self-persuasion; the child is utilizing self-persuasion to achieve the goal of pleasing the mom and dad as well as receiving a reward. The child is convinced to improve their grades while being motivated by money. Think of it like this: when a child goes to the dentist, it is usually persuaded by a parent that the dentist is not bad and if they do well while at the dentist, they will receive a reward. This is self-persuasion brought on by rewards. When we want to change our behavior, say, to healthier eating, we might try to convince ourselves we don't like the forbidden foods as much as we do, knowing that forbidden food attract weight gain and health issues, therefore self-persuasion decreases the need for the forbidden food. Role Playing The experiment below discusses the effects that role-playing can have on self-persuasion. Subjects first expressed their own positions on whether college education should be general (liberal arts) or specialized (career preparatory), then were led to accept that they would write essays supporting one or the other of these positions. Next, they judged the validity of a standard set of statements representing both views and again expressed their opinions on the same issue. Validity judgments indicated that subjects tended strongly to accept arguments supporting their own positions and reject opposing ones when expecting to defend their own positions, but accepted nearly equal numbers of arguments on both sides when expecting to advocate the opposing position. Final opinion judgments were influenced in the direction of the assigned position even though the role-playing task was not performed. It was concluded that the effectiveness of role-playing in inducing opinion change may be due in large to its success in getting subjects to evaluate.Anthony G. Greenwald, Ohio State University. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 1969. Open Mindedness of Counterattitudinal Role Player As time moves forward, role-playing and self-persuasion have amassed. It has become established as a very effective tool for education, management, forecasting choices in conflicts and negotiations. The understanding of role- playing also allows us opportunities to understand the situations that we may not have seen prior to involving a number of things from social economics, environmental situations, and political viewpoints. Role-playing is also a way for people to develop certain skills such as listening, conflict resolution and management effectiveness. Through recent studies involving role-playing and the ability role-playing has on changing a person's mind is producing information that indicates passive affects role-playing once had are less now and communication through role-playing is more accepted. The base for the effectiveness of role-playing procedures in persuasion is poorly understood, although a number of hypotheses have been advanced. The five hypotheses below, although not directly tested in present research, must be regarded as promising. :‚Ä¢Selective learning: Playing the role of an advocate of a given position may facilitate opinion change by prompting selective attention to or retention of arguments supporting that position.Greenwald and Albert, 1968; Watts 1967 :‚Ä¢Biased scanning: When the role-playing assignment is accepted, the subject may become temporally motivated to seek arguments that support his assigned position.Elms and Janis, 1965 Janis and Gilmore 1965 :‚Ä¢Self as source: Arguments perceived as self-originated may be more readily accepted than ones perceived as externally originated.Greenwald 1968, King and Janis 1956 :‚Ä¢Hand tailoring: An individual may be able to construct a communication that is uniquely effective for his own belief structure. :‚Ä¢Dissonance: Acceptance of the role-played position may be in the service of reducing dissonance aroused by counterattitidinal performance.Festinger 1957 Issue Importance Issue importance, within self-persuasion, is to be treated in terms of the priority of a self-interest that is at stake for individuals as members of a significant group. Individuals who become emotionally involved with an issue will be influenced the most. Thus, issues of high importance would produce a higher need of opinion change, which would then cause a maximal attitude change. Low issue importance would therefore create a minimal attitude change. Attitude Change Role playing and issue importance can cause attitude change. The degree of involvement is based on the extent to which an attitudinal position is derived from and upheld by the individual and to the importance of the attitude to the individuals self. ‚ÄúCounterattitudinal role playing has generally come to be accepted as a more efficacious technique of attitude change; while issue importance has generally pertained to the social significance and personal value of an attitudinal object.‚Äù(p. 191). For Example, if you wish to play the role of a person who has a lot of courage and this particular issue is of high importance to you, you may through self- persuasion change your attitude in order to portray that attitude to others. Theorists have identified ways in which people might be able to change their own attitudes simply by thinking differently about an attitude object. These cognitive strategies used in self-persuasion are known as: Epistemic and Teleologic. ‚ÄúEpistemic strategies involve re-conceptualizing the attitude objects known shortcomings in a more positive light. Teleologic strategies involve altering the accessibility of thoughts about those shortcomings‚Äù (p. 615). These strategies for deliberate self-persuasion presumably take some cognitive effort; that is why individuals high in need for cognition, who find effortful reasoning and problem solving less stressful than individuals low in need for cognition, would be more inclined to use these two types of self- persuasion. As seen in persuasion, an attitude may be adopted simply because it is associated with a highly credible, likeable, or powerful communicator; but this form of attitude change will only persist as long as the cues that elicited it remain of high importance to the individual. However, individuals who utilize self persuasion prior to a speech or a social gathering, can alter their attitudes before they receive a message. This way allows the individual to persuade themselves of its merits and avoid appearing gullible or easily influenced(p. 530). Therefore, the self-persuasion processes could become an important mediator of anticipatory attitude change. Anticipatory shifts occur when individuals merely expecting to hear a counterattitudinal communication, will then change their attitudes in the direction of the anticipated message. =Directional Changes in Attitudes (pro and counter)= Pro and Counter Attitude: the majority of people are aware that pro anything means you are for the issue. On the other hand, the majority of people are also aware that the term counter is against. For the most part, people also tend to collaborate with the idea that people with high self-esteem, seem to demonstrate their ability is a more than pro way when dealing with topics. Attitude affects nearly everything a person does, from success to defeat. A pro attitude in a person can be a confidence booster as well as a mechanism to allow persuasion into a discussion with the attempts to persuade change within the discussion. Attitude persuasion can affect the end result of a debate as related to powerful self-esteem. Distractions can weigh heavily on the ability of a person involved in persuasion change with regards to counter attitude. As in many types of communication efforts, there have been a multitude of theories. During 1950 and 1960 theories were raised to focus on motives and functions have on individuals and their attitudes. Based on theory, the research identified that attitudes served a multitude of purposes and needs involving the importance to psychological function. During the research, different function labels were used within each theory. The grouping of the functions provided information that attitudes serve a knowledge function assisting to organize a persons environment and this will provide consistency in a person's ability to shift attitude for pro or counter needs? All attitudes likely serve this basic function to some extent. In addition, attitudes likely serve any of a number of other motives. Many attitudes serve a utilitarian function,Katz, 1960; see also Smith et al., 1956 helping to maximize the rewards and minimize the punishments obtained from objects in the environment. Such utilitarian attitudes serve to summarize the outcomes intrinsically associated with objects and to guide behavioral responses that maximize one's interests. For example, one's attitude toward ice cream may serve a utilitarian function because it is likely to be based on the rewards, such as a craving and punishments such as the idea that ice cream will increase the chances of weight gain associated with ice cream. In the pro and counter approach, self- persuasion relates directly to the ice cream and whether or not to take part with it.The Role of Attitude Functions in Persuasion and Social Judgment, SHARON SHAVITT MICHELLE R. NELSON, 2002 This type of attitude change would blossom into a counter attitude involving self-persuasion. In theory, when trying to self persuade, the counter attitude affects one's mind can have on self-persuasion, could be related to the counter affects within the body. Four Theories That Utilize Self-Persuasion =Social Judgement Theory= Social judgment theory (SJT) is a persuasion theory proposed by Carolyn Sherif, Muzafer Sherif, and Carl HovlandMallard, Jessica. \\"Engaging Students In Social Judgment Theory.\\" Communication Teacher 24.4 (2010): 197-202. Print. in 1961, and was defined by Sherif and Sherif as the perception and evaluation of an idea by comparing it with current attitudes. The social judgment theory aims to explain how audiences process messages. The receiver of a message processes the information as a comparison to existing ideas or beliefs on the issue, a sort of lens use of accepting or rejecting the message. A fundamental of the social judgment theory surrounds two internal elements present with every individual, the first being the anchor point or more commonly referred to as attitudes. This lens is always present, and is a major component in decision-making. Some of the important characteristics of individual attitudes are: ‚Ä¢ Stronger attitudes have more influence on any decision to accept or not accept a message. ‚Ä¢ Not all attitudes or opinions carry equal weight, and attitudes can be negative or positive. ‚Ä¢ Attitudes are extremely hard to predict since they are unique to any individual. ‚Ä¢ Behavior does not always indicate a person's attitude. The second element in the social judgment theory is ego involvement. Someone expressing high ego involvement in a topic usually has personal involvement in that topic. This level of ego involvement will help shape an individual's stand on a particular issue. If a message does not conform to the ego involvement of the receiver, that message will likely not be received well, if at all. Falling in this category are politics or religion, or any other controversial topics. It is for this reason that like- minded individuals tend to associate with each other and accept the same ideas. The combination of beliefs and attitudes regarding any topic come to be known as individual latitudes. Latitudes are generally grouped into three different categories, either the latitude of acceptance, the latitude of rejection, or the latitude of non-commitment. In the latitude of acceptance category, messages and ideas get stored if the listener agrees with the message. Likewise, unacceptable messages get stored in the latitude of rejection category. Messages with no agreement or disagreement, so school he followed the latitude of non-commitment category. Many times, messages cross these categories, especially when judging one's self or judging others. For example, a political stance one finds unacceptable may be acceptable to a friend. While that position is unacceptable to an individual, they do not necessarily find the other person unacceptable. The aim of the social judgment is to explain how likely a person might be change their opinion, the likely direction the change of opinion will head, the ability to tolerate the opinions of other people, and the extent to which a person is committed to the position.Social judgment theory = Elaboration Likelihood Model = The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), developed in 1986 by Richard E. Petty and John Cacioppo, is based on the idea that any one variable can influence attitudes in a number of different ways and can serve to either increase or decrease persuasion through several different mechanisms (Petty et al., 2002). ELM assumes that there are two routes of persuasive influence: central and peripheral. The key factor in selecting the routes in ELM is involvement; how much a person thinks and invests in a subject in order to form an opinion. When a person is actively thinking and internally processing the content of a subject, elaboration is high and will most likely follow the central persuasive route. However, when a person is not interested in a subject elaboration is low, which will result in information processed through the peripheral route. This model proposes that when people are motivated to process information and are cognitively able to engage in the subject, they make decisions through the central route. This type of decision making results in a permanent attitude shift and the person will begin to elaborate on the arguments presented, further strengthening the argument. When the person is not actively processing the information, the person is subject to making decisions based on periphery issues‚Äîlike or dislike of speaker, music in commercials. Petty et al. note that a person's motivation to engage in a subject is not static. For example, a person who suffers from lung cancer may be more motivated to actively consume information on smoking cessation programs. The same person may not be as interested in consuming information about gardening and will therefore process the information on a peripheral level. ELM also assumes that there are two variables that effect how people think: situational and personality. Other factors that influence how a person chooses to process information received include intelligence, time available, how much the person already knows about the topic, communication distractions, and how often the message is repeated (Rucker & Petty, 2006; Wagner & Petty, 2011Wagner, B. C., & Petty, R. E. (2011). The elaboration likelihood model of persuasion: Thoughtful and non-thougful social influence. In D. Chadee (Ed.), Theories in social psychology (pp. 96-116). Oxford: Blackwell.). =Cognitive Dissonance= Cognitive Dissonance expresses an individuals desire consistency between what they expect and the reality of any situation; however with the lack of this agreement, comes cognitive dissonance, according to many theorists, the first of which being Leon Festinger. When developing his Cognitive Dissonance Theory, Festinger concluded: ‚ÄúThere are two major sources of cognition, namely, own experience and communication from others.‚ÄùFestinger, L. (1954). Social Communication and Cognition: A Very Preliminary and Highly Tentative Draft. Wash. DC: American Psychological Press. Pp. 381-386. (p. 382). Festinger asserted that individuals understand that different inputs are not necessarily psychologically consistent with one another. When given the option between inconsistent inputs, the person suffering the dissonance will, in one way or another, try to make the option more consistent; or, in other words, strive for internal consistency(p. 93). Whenever presented with two bits of information that do not seem to fit together psychologically, the result is a dissonant relationship between the two. Understanding that cognitive dissonance works as a motivator towards states of affairs, the individual suffering the dissonance can often change their attitude, thus making the two competing ideas least dissonant. Festinger theorized the key to relationships between various cognitions fall into one of three categories: :Consonant relationship ‚Äì Cognitions or actions consistent with one another :Irrelevant relationship ‚Äì Cognitions or actions unrelated to one another :Dissonant relationship ‚Äì Cognitions or actions that are inconsistent with one another The amount of dissonance, and the corresponding mental distress relies on two basic factors: 1) the importance of the cognitions, where the greater the personal value of the elements is, the greater the resulting level of dissonance. For example, a matter involving cutting funding for schools in order to cut taxes will have wide-ranging amounts of dissonance between a parent and a nonparent.; 2) the ratio of the cognitions, where the relationship between dissonant and consonant elements vary in proportion. In the school example, a parent, a potential parent, and a person who has decided to never have children will view the scenario differently, since the weight of what is desirable (consonant) and what is undesirable (dissonant) differs between those affected by the decision. Other Work on the Theory While Festinger first conceptualized the theory, there have been others with different or will you like it to the nicer encouragement slightly different views regarding what causes dissonance. In one interpretation, drive is a key factor, ‚ÄúDissonance theory, in general, concerns the relationship between various cognitions. The theory posits the existence of a drive-like motivation to maintain consistency among relevant cognitions‚Äù(p. 465). One of Festinger's rivals, as referred by many - Daryl J. Bem offers his alternative to the theory and calls it self-perception. Bem emphasizes the following ideas of social input, and socialization. ‚ÄúSelf-awareness, one‚Äôs ability to respond differently to his own behavior and its controlling variables, is a product of social interaction‚Äù(p. 199). And, ‚Äúagain, it is evident that self-awareness is a set of behaviors which must be learned from a socializing community that sets up the necessary contingencies of reinforcement for establishing the discriminations‚Äù(p. 217). Arguably, when examining Festinger's and Bem's theories, Miller (1995) addresses a few curious questions: ‚ÄúHow closely and accurately do people actually examine their own behaviors? Are both theories comparable in the degree, accuracy or level of self-awareness they require? How necessary is self-evaluation on a conscious level for either or both theories?‚Äù(p. 8).Miller C., (1995). A reflection paper on the theories of cognitive dissonance and self-perception. Motivation vs. Self-Perception. University of Arizona =The Narrative Paradigm= Walter Fisher‚Äôs Narrative Paradigm Theory posits that all meaningful communication is a form of storytelling or giving a report of events, and that human beings experience and comprehend life as a series of ongoing narratives, each with its own conflicts, characters, beginning, middle, and end. Fisher believes that all forms of communication that appeal to our reason are best viewed as stories shaped by history, culture, and character, and all forms of human communication are to be seen fundamentally as storiesNarrative paradigm The main points of the Narrative Paradigm are: 1\\\\. People are essentially storytellers. 2\\\\. People make decisions because they feel they had a good reason to do so rather than because of evidence. 3\\\\. What people do and how people think is swayed by history, biography, culture, and character. 4\\\\. People are continually choosing personal stories and these stories are constantly changing. 5\\\\. Narrative rationality is determined by the coherence and fidelity of the story, which measure a story's truthfulness and humanity. This paradigm suggests that people choose what they want to believe, and that the beliefs are influenced by external factors. Communicating in the narrative enables people to share their understandings of how the world works and allows them to identify with one another, particularly if people share similar beliefs. Fisher's original theory was published in 1984 under The Narrative Paradigm: In the Beginning, however he clarifies his position in 1985 in The Narrative Paradigm: The Elaboration. Fisher writes that the narrative paradigm is a paradigm in the sense of a philosophical view of human communication; it is not a model of discourse as such. The primary function of the paradigm is to offer a way of interpreting and assessing human communication that leads to critique, a determination of whether or not a given instance of discourse provides a reliable, trustworthy, and desirable guide to thought and action in the world. It predicts that all normal human discourse is meaningful and is subject to the tests of narrative rationality (p 351.

They played a blend of groove metal, thrash metal and metalcore and their music also has melodic and progressive elements. History =Origins (2007-2011)= Trials was originally formed by vocalist/guitarist Mark Sugar and former Novembers Doom drummer Sasha Horn, sometime in late 2007. In an interview with About.com, Mark Sugar stated, \\"We formed...with only two members and the sole intention of recording a demo. The demo got more attention than we bargained for, and we gradually became a full band.\\"http://heavymetal.about.com/b/2013/05/04/5-questions-with-trials.htm As the band's demo gained notoriety in Chicago and beyond, the band recruited bassist Usha Rajbhandari and guitarist Remy Walle, and gradually began writing what would become their first album, Witness to the Downfall. =Witness To The Downfall (2011)= After several delays, Trials' first album, \\"Witness to the Downfall\\", was released independently on August 1, 2011. Produced by the band, the record was mixed and mastered by German engineer Lasse Lammert. Artwork duties were handled by Seth Siro Anton, of the band Septicflesh. During the lengthy recording process, the band parted ways with drummer Sasha Horn. Adam Kopecky joined as the new drummer in 2010, handling all live dates in support of Witness To The Downfall. The album met with mixed reviews, most notably a 7 out of 10 in Metal Hammer UK magazine. =In The Shadow of Swords (2013)= In 2012, the band began work on what would become their 2nd record, In The Shadow of Swords. In the early stages of recording, guitarist Remy Walle parted ways with Trials. The band had little to say about his departure, other than that he was \\"relieved of his duties.\\"http://rockinchicago.org/post/32439568157/q-a-with-trials Guitarist Ryan Bruchert, formerly of Chicago grindcore band HeWhoCorrupts, joined the band in July 2012.http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=91098 In The Shadow Of Swords would be the first Trials record to feature contributions from Bruchert and Kopecky. When asked about the band's musical direction, Sugar stated \\"I think we got a little more progressive since the debut, more complex. The new music is so much darker and more aggressive, and that's really not due to any choice in direction -- it's just the result of our attitudes as people.\\" http://heavymetal.about.com/b/2013/05/04/5-questions- with-trials.htm The band once again enlisted Lasse Lammert to engineer and mix the record. The cover artwork was created by Sugar, Rajbhandari, and Chris Angelucci of Encrust. The CD version of the album contains a bonus track, \\"Spirit Leaves,\\" while the digital version contains a cover of Judas Priest's \\"Jawbreaker.\\" In The Shadow of Swords was released independently on May 1, 2013. Reviews were generally positive, and markedly improved from the reaction to Witness To The Downfall.http://www.rocknreelreviews.com/review/trials-in- the-shadows-of-swords/http://www.metal- temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/reviews/cd_3/t_2/trials-in-the- shadow.htmhttp://www.metalstorm.net/pub/review.php?review_id=11803 The band embarked on a short Midwestern tour in the fall of 2013 in support of the album. Trials is expected to begin work on their third record in spring of 2014. A new song entitled \\"Don't Believe The Word\\" was performed at the 2013 live shows, and other new material has been previewed live on occasion. =This Ruined World (2015)= In early 2015, the band completed work on their third record, \\"This Ruined World.\\" Recording was handled by Pete Grossmann at Bricktop Recording, while the album was mixed by Quentin Poynter at Gunpoint Studios. The album's official release date is July 24, 2015. As a preview of the new material, the band released a digital EP in June 2015. The EP features new song \\"Don't Believe The Word,\\" as well as a cover of Strapping Young Lad's \\"Far Beyond Metal\\" as the b-side. Artwork for the EP was drawn by the band's drummer, Adam Kopecky. In 2016, Trials announced on Facebook that they were no longer an active band.

The Burgess rifle was Colt's only entrance into the lever-action rifle market, produced to compete with Winchester Repeating Arms Company's line of popular rifles. The 1883 Burgess rifle was designed and patented by Andrew Burgess, an American firearms designer and photographer, who sold the design to Colt. Overview The Colt-Burgess rifle is similar in design to Winchester's lever-action rifles, such as the Winchester Model 1873. It was produced in two versions chambered for the .44-40 Winchester cartridge: a rifle version with a barrel, and a carbine with a barrel. The rifle features either a full octagon, half- octagon, or round barrel, with the full octagon barrels being the most numerously produced among rifle variants. A tubular magazine is located under the barrel in similar fashion to other lever-action rifles with a capacity of 15 rounds in the rifle version or 12 rounds in the carbine version. The receiver on the Burgess rifle is smaller than the Winchester 1873's, providing for a lighter firearm. The rifle's action, though similar to the Winchester 1873's, is considered to be a stronger design. The action utilizes a toggle- joint system to lock the breechblock. The extension of the loading lever is the lower part of the toggle-joint; the upper part of the toggle-joint is linked to the breechblock. Located on the receiver is a sliding loading gate from which cartridges are fed into the magazine; the sliding gate design is in contrast to Winchester's tilting gate. Burgess rifles were finished with either a blued or browned barrel, blued receiver, casehardened hammer and lever, and walnut stock. Current reproduction Burgess rifles are also available with casehardened frames. Colt Burgess toggle-joint Production Although Colt predominately was a manufacturer of popular revolvers, such as the Colt Single Action Army, the company began in the 1880s to seek to compete against Winchester in the rifle market. In 1882, Colt contacted Andrew Burgess to design a lever-action rifle and by July 1883, production of the new rifle had begun. The Colt-Burgess was produced for sixteen months thereafter, with a total of 6,403 guns manufactured. Approximately 60% of these were of the rifle variation. When compared to production figures of Winchester's 1873 rifle, the Colt-Burgess failed as a serious competitor to Winchester. From 1873 to 1919, Winchester manufactured 720,610 Model 1873 rifles, or an average of over 15,000 per year. The short production history of the Colt-Burgess has led to much speculation as to the reason of its demise. According to legend, upon hearing of Colt's entrance into the lever-action rifle market, Winchester began to develop a prototype revolver to compete with Colt's market. A \\"gentleman's agreement\\" then followed between Colt and Winchester, with Colt agreeing to drop production of the Burgess and Winchester abandoning its plans to develop a revolver. The truth of this story has never been fully verified, and as such, the reason for the Burgess rifle's short production history is unknown. Replicas of the Burgess rifle and carbine are currently produced by the Italian manufacturer Uberti chambered for the .45 Colt cartridge.

Overview and History BC School Sports was created in 1965, and was originally known as the British Columbia Federation of School Athletic Associations (BCFSAA). The group was founded by a group of teachers and administrators who were interested in creating an organisation that would assist in organising school sport functions. The first constitution of the group was adopted in 1966. The provincial government provided assistance to the group, and the organisation was able to open the doors of its first office in January 1970. The name changed from BCFSAA into British Columbia School Sports (BCSS or BC School Sports) in 1980-81.http://www.bcschoolsports.ca/about-us Governing of the Group The BCSS is self-governed by an assembly of the Member Schools. While the group is self-governed, they continue to accept input from several groups, including School Districts, the Ministry of Education, et al. The combined force of all the Member Schools is known as the Legislative Assembly. Together, they make decisions over BC School Sports' rules and regulation, policies of operation, fees, association advocacy programs, position statements, and membership programs and services.http://www.bcschoolsports.ca/about-us Mission, Vision, and Values =Mission= BCSS fulfills its mission by promoting all students to take part in extracurricular activities, assisting schools in the development and delivery of its programs, and providing governance for inter-school competition.http://www.bcschoolsports.ca/member-services/mission-vision-and- values =Vision= The vision of BCSS is, \\"Students in British Columbia schools will benefit from participation in physical activity and sport.\\"http://www.bcschoolsports.ca/member-services/mission-vision-and-values =Values= BCSS has three main values, it: *Encourages participation in physical activity and interschool athletics to foster lifelong physical and emotional well-being *Supports the equity of opportunity for students and coaches to participate in athletics *Promotes quality interschool sports programs as a means of ensuring fair play and ethicshttp://www.bcschoolsports.ca/member-services/mission-vision-and-values Leaders =Association Presidents= BCSS has 22 different Association Presidents, as well as a number of different members of the Board of Directors, the list following includes contact information.http://www.bcschoolsports.ca/staff/3 (All information for the to- be-mentioned Association Presidents comes from the reference to the left of this sentence).

It can be observed in many situations around the world, and is associated with high-grade metamorphism and extensive lateral displacement of strata along oblique strike-slip faults  Model  The concept of indenter tectonics was first introduced by Molnar and Tapponnier in 1975, with reference to the Himalayan orogeny. Various experiments have illustrated the process by which deformation occurs. A continent-continent collision can be visualized as a 'die-and-metal' model, with a rigid die (the 'indenter') moving into a softer, rigid-plastic metal (the 'host'). In a tectonic setting, the terms ‚Äòrigid‚Äô and ‚Äòsoft‚Äô refer to the strength of the lithosphere. The strong lithosphere of the indenter remains relatively undeformed and its boundaries are preserved, while the host allows deformation by lateral movement of crust both along the contact with the indenter and within the host. The indenter block is too buoyant to subduct, so crustal accommodation is achieved by either shallow underthrusting and crustal thickening, or formation and later lateral displacement of several microplates. It is possible to have a combination of the two models.  Examples  Real-world examples differ by the rigidity of the indenter, the size and rheology of both the host and the indenter, and the extent of lateral confinement. The best known active example is the system of strike-slip structures observed in the Eurasian plate as it responds to collision with the Indian plate, but similar events can be found all over the Earth. = Asia = * Indian and Eurasian plates (Himalayan orogeny) * Palawan microcontinental block and Philippine Mobile Belt = North America = * Slave craton and Churchill province = Europe = * African and Eurasian plates (Alpine orogeny)  References  Tectonics ","title":"Indenter tectonics"},{"id":"42526382","title":"Nandha Periyasamy"},{"id":"42526391","text":"Kyrkbron is a bridge in Ume√• that takes √ñstra Kyrkogatan over Ume River to Teg on the south side. The construction of Kyrkbron started in 1973 and it was opened on 26 September 1975 becoming Ume√•'s third bridge over the Ume river. A discussion about whether or not the bridge should be located next to the church lasted from the early 1960s and continued into the 1970s. During the construction an unknown burial ground was encountered (an older part of the cemetery), leading to archaeological excavations. The bridge consists of two parallel girders in concrete with vertical straight supports. It is actually two separate bridges, each with their lane with on and exit ramps that extend out over the river on the north side. The purpose of building Kyrkbron was to relieve Tegsbron from some of the traffic and Kyrkbron was designed with the expectation that there would be a drastic increase in car traffic in the city center, which proved to be highly optimistic.  History  Aerial photo of Ume river in central Ume√•. The nearest bridge is the Kyrkbron. = Background = Already in the 1930s it was clear that the only bridge over the river in Ume√•, Gamla bron, no longer would be able to cope with the increasing traffic. The County Board in V√§sterbotten commissioned the highway engineer O H Grahn√©n to create a work plan and drawings for a new bridge or a reconstruction of the existing bridge. Grahn√©n's proposal, dated 16 July 1936, showed a number of different solutions. Among other suggestions, there was a proposal to place the bridge as an extension to √ñstra Kyrkogatan, next to Ume√• City Church. One problem with this solution was that the bridge then would end up downstream from the port and therefore the bridge would need to have vertical clearance or have movable bridge components, so that ships could pass. Such solutions was however considered to be too costly. Grahn√©n's main proposal was instead that the old bridge was closed to motor traffic and that a new bridge was to be built at the extension of V√§stra Esplanaden. Tegs municipal society then requested a report regarding the possibility of a bridge in the extension of √ñstra Kyrkogatan. The provincial government appointed O. H. Grahn√©n to investigate it and Grahn√©n's investigation showed that a swing bridge with a swing span was the only realistic solution, but also that the additional costs were considered too high. This led Grahn√©n to object to building a bridge at √ñstra kyrkogatan. Despite Grahn√©n's advise the provincial government in 1939 decided that a swing bridge should be built. The case was revised by the King in Council who sent the matter back to the provincial government for reconsideration. This led the provincial government to change their minds and it was decided that the bridge should be built at the extension of V√§stra Esplanaden. This bridge, Tegsbron, was inaugurated in 1949. = Investigations, plans and decisions = thumb|300px|A map from 2013, with the 1965 eastern alternatives drawn on it. |class=mw-halign-upright Tegs municipal society in 1960 merged with Ume√• landskommun (Ume√• rural municipality) and there was a need to create a zoning plan for central Teg. A few years later in 1965, when Ume√• landskommun was to merge with Ume√• city, there was a need for a land use plan for the entire urban area. In the land use plan an area was allocated for a bridge at the church and a highway from Tegsbron through central Teg. A strong minority in the Municipal council was against Kyrkbron and the highway, as they wanted to keep Teg as a unit. The land use plan, with the bridge situated next to the church, was created by V√§sterbottenskommunernas Arkitekt- och Byggnadskontor (VAB), with √Öke Lundberg as the chief architect. The proposal was sent out to submission for comment to, among other things, the parish council in Ume√• city parish, which endorsed the bridge's placement next to the church. The engineering company Orrje & Co was hired in 1963 to develop a plan for Ume√•'s traffic route. Also the municipality's Public Works Department did an investigation of the bridge's position. In October 1964, Orrje & Co presented a plan for the traffic route that took into consideration what traffic capacity the bridge would need to have in 1980, which was estimated at more than 40,000 cars per day. The plan also stated that the bridge should be located at the church in the extension of √ñstra Kyrkogatan. In February 1965 the city council adopted Orrje & Co's proposals on the plan for the traffic route. The same year the parish council requested a new examination of the placement of the bridge as the church services would be disturbed by traffic noise and that the fragile environment around the church would be destroyed if the bridge was built there. The parish council's objections were addressed in a motion to the city council. The city council commissioned Orrje & Co to do a study of an additional placement for the bridge. In November 1965 Orrje & Co presented two proposals: the original one with the bridge at the church and one with the brige placed more to the east in the extension of J√§rnv√§gsgatan. The placement next to the church was considered most appropriate. However, √Öke Lundberg, who became the county architect in 1964, suggested that Orrje & Co's eastern alternative should be used as he argued that the technical and economic advantages of the placement next to the church did not outweigh the infringing of the aesthetic and historical values. In April and May 1966 two studies were presented in print, Orrje & Co's: \\"Ny bro √∂ver Ume √§lv: tv√• principf√∂rslag\\" and the architect Erik Thelaus' \\"Bro √∂ver Ume√§lven. Synpunkter p√• milj√∂fr√•gor m m\\". The architect firm Klemming och Thelaus was awarded a contract from Ume√• city to study the environmental impacts of a bridge placed next to the church, and to propose a design of the bridge and its abutment. The findings were, amongst other things, reported with a model in scale 1:400, with floor plans and a memorandum. The memorandum emphasized that the bridge should be parallel to Tegsbron, to fit into the orthogonal and regular structure of the land use in the city. It was also concluded that it was important that the bridge would be given a visual connection or relationship with Tegsbron. Therefore, the firm proposed a bridge with a straight box girder with straight vertical support. In June 1966 the motion for a new examination of the placement of the bridge was discussed in the city council. Dr√§tselkammaren, responsible for the city's economy, agreed with the Public Works Department's line, and argued that the placement next to the church took precedence over other options. The city council approved dr√§tselkammaren's proposal without a vote. In August 1966, Orrje & Co's report \\"F√∂rslag till ny bro √∂ver Ume √§lv i str√§ckning Idrottsv√§gen-√ñstra Kyrkogatan\\" (\\"Proposal for a new bridge over the Ume River in the direction Idrottsv√§gen-√ñstra Kyrkogatan\\") that showed the traffic engineering principles that should form the basis of Kyrkbron. It was meant to serve as a basis for land use plans for parts of the city. The land use plan was revised according to Orrje & Co's report, and the projection of the bridge was done in collaboration with the Swedish Road Administration. Different stakeholders were called in, including the Log driving association whose views on the span's design was important, so that log driving would not be affected. After a suggestion from the roadworks department the bicycle lane was placed in between the bridge's two driving lanes. The new town plan was adopted by the city council in 1968. The County Administrative Board objected to the city's land use plan in 1969 and wanted an investigation into a more eastern location for the bridge. The reason given was that the expansions of Ume√• University and Norrland's University Hospital changed the conditions, as both lies east of downtown Ume√•. Also the Swedish National Heritage Board appealed based on infringement of inalienable values. The King in Council referred the matter to the Statens planverk (the national planning department) which, in turn, requested the opinion of the Swedish Road Administration, which finally endorsed the plan. The reasoning was that the goal with new bridge would be to reduce traffic on Tegsbron, hence, the new bridge could not be too far away from Tegsbron. The land use plan was finally approved in September 1969. Two months later Kyrkbron was added to Swedish Road Administration's budget for 1970‚Äì74. Building started in 1972. It was calculated that Kyrkbron would take 54.5 percent of the traffic from Tegsbron. At the time Tegsbron had around 25,000 vehicles/day, which was the maximum capacity for the bridge. The prognosis for year 1990 was 60,000 vehicles per day. At the city council's handling of the annual budget, on 28 October 1971, the municipal government proposed that the plan for \\"bro √∂ver Ume √§lv\\" (\\"bridge over Ume River\\") should be adopted. This was followed by a heated debate that lasted six hours before the city council decided to allocate funding for the bridge. The number of votes was 25 against to 26 in favor, where the president had the casting vote. Thus the bridge's position at the church was settled. The decision to build the bridge led to the provincial government received 43 complaints letters against the decision. In May 1972 an agreement was signed between Ume√• Municipality and the Swedish Road Administration that the Swedish Road Administration would build the bridge starting on 16 June 1972. AB V√§gf√∂rb√§ttringar was commissioned to build the bridge for 18.6 million kronor. This also included other works related to the bridge. = The opposition against Kyrkbron = Kyrkbron from underneath. The east bridge to the left and the west bridge to the right. The debate on the bridge started in 1965 when the church council sent a letter to the city council stating that the church services would be disrupted by the traffic on the bridge. In June 1971 the county architect √Öke Lundberg once again brought up the placement of the bridge during an information session on municipal issues in Holmsund. In the local media the discussion continued and various experts at the national level commented about the bridge. On 2 October 1971 the peak of the resistance was reached when a demonstration against the bridge was held in Ume√•. The demonstration was initiated because a reader poll in the newspaper V√§sterbottens-Kuriren the previous day had shown that 84 percent were against the construction of Kyrkbron. Also the newly appointed governor Karl Georg Samuelson became involved in the opposition towards Kyrkbron. A few members of the Centre Party tried to stop the construction in 1973, on the grounds that the cost had risen to 45 million kronor. The motion was rejected on the ground that it would be more costly for the municipality to rework the city's land use plan and cancel existing contracts than to continue the construction. Also, there would be implications of reduced employment in the municipality if the construction did not take place as planned. The opposition towards Kyrkbron was from then on reduced. = An unknown graveyard and cannon balls = During the summer of 1972 an unknown graveyard was found when workers were digging for the bridge next to Ume√• City Church. The old boundaries of the cemetery was unknown and a tomb map was missing.Ros√©n, pp. 142‚Äì146 The discovery made the county custodian of antiquities Sune Zachrisson and the Swedish National Heritage Board to put the construction of the bridge to a halt as the area would undergo archaeological excavations. Under the leadership of Sibylla Haasum 22 shafts were dug between 1 July and 17 August. The result was forty casket graves with about sixty skeletons and also remains of coffins, coffin handles, fittings, nails, ornaments, grave plates, etc. were found. In an excavation seventeen cannonballs were found. The cannonballs probably came from the Finnish War of 1808‚Äì1809. Either the cannonballs ended up there when Lieutenant General Johan Adam Cronstedt defended Ume√• in March 1809 or when the Russian general Nikolai Kamensky in the summer of 1809 defended the bridge that the Russians built across Ume River. In the last grave, a 3.3 by 3.8-meter large tomb south-southeast of the church, legible name plates were found that showed that it was governor Pehr Adam Stromberg's family grave. No headstone was found but it was probably destroyed when the church burned in 1887, along with all archival material about the graves. = The construction of the bridge and the inauguration = During the construction of the bridge a few technical novelties were used such as a desktop computer when surveying and the distance was measured with a laser. Kyrkbron was inaugurated 26 September 1975 by the Swedish Communication Minister Bengt Norling. In connection with the construction of the bridge an extensive rerouting of the traffic in central Ume√• and Teg was also carried out. Teg became the first district in Ume√• to get a pedestrian and cycle path all the way downtown. = After the construction of the bridge = When the construction of Kolb√§cksbron began in 1998, Kyrkbron had approximately 16,600 and Tegsbron approximately 21,600 vehicles per mean annual day. In 2010 Kyrkbron had about 15,100, Tegsbron about 27,300 and Kolb√§cksbron about 12,000 vehicles per mean annual day. Because of Kolb√§cksbron, a reduced amount of traffic in the center and the transformation of Strandgatan from a transit route to a city street. Kyrkbron's importance have been reduced and the bridge is now over-dimensioned.  References  = Printed sources =   * Ume√• kommuns ritningsarkiv.

It aired in the United States on NBC on January 27, 2011. In the episode, the group stages a play to discourage drug use, but Pierce's attempts to give himself a larger role derail the performance.  Plot  The study group is putting on an anti-drug play for a group of middle school students at Annie's (Alison Brie) behest. The other group members complain about their parts, particularly Pierce (Chevy Chase), who is dressed as marijuana and playing the role of \\"Drugs\\". After their rehearsal, Chang (Ken Jeong) tries talking to Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) about her pregnancy and the possibility he could be the baby's father, but she pointedly ignores him. Britta (Gillian Jacobs) receives multiple texts from someone named Marcus; when she leaves, Jeff (Joel McHale) uses her phone to text Marcus flirtatiously. Pierce notices Annie collecting cans for recycling and follows her to her apartment. There, she explains she's trying to make money after being cut off by her parents in response to her past problems with drugs. Pierce writes Annie a cheque to help her pay rent, which she reluctantly accepts. Annie then agrees to let Pierce use a line he improvised for the play. In private, Pierce watches old Hawthorne Wipes commercials, where his father Cornelius replaced him with a new actor to be his \\"son\\". The next day, Pierce arrives with new scripts; when Annie resists, he hints at the cheque he wrote, and she allows the changes. Britta tells Jeff that Marcus is her nephew who will be attending the play. Jeff tries to talk Marcus down via texts, but Marcus responds with more flirting. When the play starts, Pierce's improvisation greatly amuses the children. Despite Annie's worries that the play's message is getting lost, Pierce returns to the stage after having been \\"flushed\\", to the audience's delight. In response, Annie fires Pierce. Pierce lets slip that he wrote Annie a cheque, and the rest of the group turn on her for selling out on her own play. Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) tells the group the students are restless and want to see \\"Drugs\\" again. Jeff convinces the group to salvage the play, and Chang volunteers to be \\"Drugs\\". He delivers a performance intended to terrify the students; they respond by angrily pelting him with baseballs. Dean Pelton compliments Annie for her play, and Shirley apologizes to Chang for her earlier behavior. Jeff talks to Marcus (Justin Marco) in person and explains the situation; Marcus agrees to not tell Britta what happened \\"for a price\\" (implied to be Jeff stealing Britta's bra). Annie tells Pierce she won't take his money, as she does not want to be dependent on others; she assures him they are still friends.  Reception  = Ratings = This episode received 4.585 million viewers and a 2.2/6 rating in the 18-49 demographic. = Reviews = The episode received mixed to positive reviews. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, noting that the episode felt \\"sort of clich√©\\" with many ideas that were \\"undercooked and over-obvious.\\" However, she liked the character dynamics in the episode, particularly Pierce and his struggle for attention, and complemented the two subplots in the episode. Alan Sepinwall of Uproxx remarked that the episode \\"felt very meta\\", with Pierce behaving similarly to Chevy Chase and his attempts to get attention in real life. He also commented that the revelations about Annie were \\"a nice way to push her character into adulthood\\" and that while \\"Pierce wasn‚Äôt really redeemed, his behavior gave the writers an opportunity to redeem Chang a bit\\". In his review, Joshua Kurp of Vulture likened Pierce to Michael Scott, with both characters wanting to be loved and willing to \\"do just about anything to be cheered on\\". He called Jeff's subplot \\"a little too convenient\\" but enjoyed the scene where he asks Abed (Danny Pudi) for advice while Abed stares back silently. Emma Matthews of Den of Geek praised the episode for being \\"beautifully written\\" and \\"a pitch perfect recreation of hundreds of after school specials, but with sincerity and more than a little heart\\". She drew attention to Ken Jeong's performance and called the insight into Pierce's backstory \\"incredibly telling.\\"  Notes   References   External links  * 2011 American television episodes Community (season 2) episodes Television episodes about drugs ","title":"Celebrity Pharmacology"},{"id":"42526404","text":"Tanzhou may refer to: *Tanzhou Town (), town in and subdivision of Zhongshan, Guangdong *Changsha, formerly known as Tanzhou Historical prefectures *Tan Prefecture (Hunan) (), which existed between the 6th and 14th centuries in modern Hunan *Tan Prefecture (Beijing) (), which existed between the 6th and 14th centuries in modern Beijing See also *Tan (disambiguation) ","title":"Tanzhou"},{"id":"42526415","text":"Dalbec is a folk hero from traditional Quebec folklore.

(Societ√† Piemontese Automobili) company that had been founded by Giovanni Battista's brother Matteo Ceirano, and which, in 1925, was taken over by Fiat. Ceirano family background The Ceirano brothers, Giovanni Battista, Giovanni, Ernesto and Matteo, were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for : Ceirano; Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.); Fratelli Ceirano; S.T.A.R. / Rapid (Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid); SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino); Itala and S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili). Giovanni's son Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" was also influential, co-founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal.Lancia, the essentials In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co-founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. which in 1903 became Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB & C to create his own brand - Itala. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili) with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco.

In 1904 Giovanni Batista Ceirano transformed Fratelli Ceirano & C. into Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid, using the name Rapid as a trademark. Production moved to a 50,000 square meters plant in Barriera di Nizza, Turin, where 500 people worked. The initial share capital was 2,000,000 lire, which in 1905 amounted to 5,000,000. Annual production was 600 units per year. Around 1905 Giovanni Battista suffered poor health and retired to Bordighera on the coast of Liguria, so Rodolfo Chio Maggi was appointed chief designer while Giovani Battista Maggi and Alfonso Scott took over the management.Auto Passion - Profile and images of RAPID (Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid) (STAR) - (1.904 - 1.921) During World War I the factory produced both trucks and armaments, up to 4,000 artillery shells per day.

Between 1905 and 1907 there was a two-cylinder model and the two four-cylinder models 16/24 HP with 4562 cc engine capacity and 24/40 HP with 7432 cc capacity. A common feature of both models was the shaft transmission and the radiator front section with a flat oval profile. In 1907 they introduced a range of 4-cylinder models with engines ranging from 1750 to 10560 cc, including the 50/70 HP. In approximately 1913 they introduced three four-cylinder models with 1600 cc, 2000 cc and 3100 cc capacity. These also had a 4 speed gearbox and sophisticated rear suspension.

His voice is described as similar to Bruce Springsteen, Joe Cocker, Peter Gabriel, as well as a more refined projection of his former hardcore roots. Northcote has shared the stage with Frank Turner, The Gaslight Anthem, Tim Barry, Wintersleep, Aidan Knight, Hannah Georgas, John K Samson (Weakerthans, Propaghandi), Corb Lund, The Wooden Sky, Library Voices, Lindi Ortega and others. Northcote has released four studio albums to date. In 2009, shortly after signing to Blackbox Music, Northcote recorded his debut EP, ‚ÄúBorrowed Chords, Tired Eyes‚Äù in the back of a yoga studio in Regina, Saskatchewan. In 2011, Northcote went on to record his first full-length album, \\"Gather No Dust\\", at Jukasa Studios in Caledonia, Ontario. The album was co-produced by Dan Weston (Attack in Black, Shad, City and Color, Daniel Romano). In late 2012, Goud entered Hive Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, to record the self-titled album, \\"Northcote\\", with Juno-winning producer, Colin Stewart (Dan Mangan, Yukon Blonde, Cave Singers, Black Mountain). The record was written in Goud‚Äôs van along the Victoria British Columbia waterfront. Their most recent record, \\"Hope Is Made of Steel\\", was released in 2015. Early career (2000-2008) Goud (pronounced ‚ÄúGood‚Äù) began his career as guitarist and second-vocalist of post-hardcore, Christian band, Means. Means was regarded as an important contributor to the Canadian underground post-hardcore scene. Touring extensively through Canada and the United States for 8 years, the group eventually signed to California- based record label, Facedown Records in 2006. Jason Dunn, founder of Facedown Records, explained his decision to sign the band was based on Goud‚Äôs ‚Äúquality of the songwriting and the 'real' sounding vocals [sic] sung with passion.\\" The group parted ways in 2008 following a cross-Canada farewell tour. Means shared the stage with such bands as Comeback Kid, Moneen, Shai Hulud, Misery Signals and As I Lay Dying. Between tours, Goud began performing acoustic-solo shows in smaller venues in his home province of Saskatchewan. While Northcote acknowledges his conservative Christian roots, he is clear that he has distanced himself from organized religion. He shares candidly both on stage and in interviews about a time in his life when he believed his calling was ministry and how he eventually became a non-believer. What is less clear is how this transition has influenced his music. Northcote expressly distinguishes himself from such artists as David Bazan who have also walked away from religious piety but communicate this transition more overtly in their writing. Tours Northcote at Rock Camp 2014, Germany =Canada= In 2009, Northcote began touring extensively across Canada. Northcote performs in a variety of formats ranging from solo to full band, complete with a horn section. In May 2013, after the release of self-titled album, \\"Northcote\\", Goud headed out on a cross-country tour with a full band. Unfortunately, mid- way, the group suffered a car accident forcing them to cancel several shows. Northcote returned later in Summer 2013 to make up the remainder of most of the shows that were cancelled. =Europe= In 2013, Northcote signed with European-based record label, Xtra Mile Recordings. Since that time, Northcote continues to tour Europe with such artists as Dave Hause, Chuck Ragan and Billy The Kid. In May 2013, Northcote made his European debut in Germany with Nashville artists Austin Lucas, and Glossary. During this tour, he performed at the Pirate Satellite Festival in Stuttgart, Germany where he shared the stage with Turbonegro plus ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead. In 2014, he had his first headlining tour through Europe. He played these concerts with the full band. =United States= In January 2014, Northcote made his American debut supporting Dave Hause on what has been his longest and most extensive tour to date. During this tour, \\"Northcote\\" was released digitally and on vinyl by the American record label, The Black Numbers (imprint of No Sleep Records) While on tour, Northcote appeared on Daytrotter, a website which hosts live, off-the-floor recording sessions of popular and up-and-coming indie artists. =Revival tour= In 2012, Northcote was invited by Chuck Ragan (of Hot Water Music) to play the Revival Tour in Montreal and Toronto. Prior to this, Northcote could frequently be heard covering \\"Trusty Chords\\" by Hot Water Music. Since that time, former lead-singer, Chuck Ragan, has been heard covering Northcote‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorry‚Äù alongside Dave Hause. Northcote contributed the track ‚ÄúWildcard‚Äù to the Revival Tour- 2012 Collections. Coincidentally, Northcote is also known for covering Gaslight Anthem‚Äôs 59‚Äô Sound. The band was quoted giving praise to \\"Burn Right Past them All\\" in an interview at the popular European Music Festival, Download. Musical projects On November 19, 2013 Northcote released a self-titled, one-off project, called Teenland in collaboration with Leif Thorseth (Rah Rah), Graham Jones (Yukon Blonde) and Michael Dawson (Library Voices). The project was written and recorded over the span of two weekends. Teenland never toured and has no plans to do so. =Other projects= In 2014, Northcote released the first of a six-part live performance EPK series titled Lowville Sessions. The series was named after the town it was filmed in: Lowville, Ontario. In December 2013, Vice Magazine released a digital-only selection of live recordings titled Live at the Upstairs Cabaret on their music channel, Noisey. In February, 2013, Northcote released a subsequent web-series titled Painting an Album, which features interviews with Goud and various collaborators against the backdrop of the creation of a 12x12' mural replica of the album art for the newly released \\"Burn Right Past Them All\\" In 2011, Northcote released a mini-documentary web-series titled Only You Can See Me, with the release of his first full-length record, \\"Gather No Dust\\". Released in four parts, the project includes music and interview footage coupled with downloadable tracks of acoustic takes of the album‚Äôs recordings.

It is a congregation of the Church of Scotland (in the Presbytery of Edinburgh) and is located in the Blackford area on the south side of the city. History After growing resentment within the Church of Scotland about the appointment of ministers by the patron of a church, the Disruption of 1843 led to the Free Church of Scotland. Among the ministers seceding was Dr. Robert Gordon, formerly of St Giles', and he became the first minister of the \\"Free High\\" congregation. After he died in 1853, he was succeeded by Robert Rainy, who was minister until 1862, and then followed by other eminent preachers and scholars. The United Free Church of Scotland was formed in 1900 when the Free Church combined with the United Presbyterian Church, which rejoined the Church of Scotland in 1929. William Reid was a successful Edinburgh businessman during the 19th century, and when he died in 1889 he left his wealth to his four sons. The last son, William Crambe Reid, died without heirs in 1921 after inheriting the wealth of his brothers, and bequeathed his estate to the United Free Church to build a church in memory of his father, but the reunion of the churches had taken place before construction started. There already being an abundance of churches in the south side of Edinburgh, the Presbytery of Edinburgh moved the congregation of the Free High Church attached to the New College at the top of The Mound into the new building, as their building was to be used for the expansion of the activities of the College. It was dedicated on 3 January 1935, and the first Sunday service, on 6 January, was officiated by Rev. J Marshall Robertson. On June 11, 2019, the Rev. Alex McAspurren was inducted as minister of both Craigmillar Park Church and Reid Memorial Church, the two churches having been linked by the Presbytery of Edinburgh the previous year. Details The tower to the south-east, with the cloister area below The church was designed by Leslie Grahame Thomson and built between 1929 and 1933. It is in an Arts and Crafts Gothic style, replicating mediaeval churches with cathedral-like proportions and layout. It consists of a cruciform with side aisles and a square tower to the south-east. To the east of this main section is a cloister court, around which are arranged vestries, the session house, a hall and the church officer's house. The windows along the side are decorated with tracery and there are flanking buttresses that travel above the height of the windows. The three windows of the chancery are decorated with stained glass by James Ballantine, depicting the Nativity, Crucifixion and Ascension. The Church is located in a triangular area between West Savile Terrace to the north, and Blackford Avenue to the south, a steep hill that rises above it. It was protected as a category A listed building on 12 December 1974. Organ The organ was built by Rushworth and Dreaper.

Her birth name is not mentioned in the chronicles. (, ; 1536 ‚Äì June 1606) was the chief queen consort of King Nanda of Toungoo Dynasty of Burma (Myanmar) from 1581 to 1599. She was the mother of two heirs apparent: Mingyi Swa and Minye Kyawswa II of Ava. Brief The queen was one of King Tabinshwehti's two children listed in the Burmese chronicles.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 102‚Äì103 Her mother may have been Dhamma Dewi.Though chronicles do not explicitly mention her mother's name, it is probable that the mother was Dhamma Dewi, one of the two chief queens of Tabinshwehti in the 1530s, based on the fact that the daughter achieved the chief queen status. Typically, daughters of senior queens were favored to become chief queens. The princess married her cousin Nanda, the heir-apparent, in 1551. They were at least half- cousins since her father Tabinshwehti and Nanda's mother Atula Thiri were half-siblings, and may have been double cousins if her mother was Dhamma Dewi since Nanda's father Bayinnaung and Dhamma Dewi were siblings. The couple had seven children (four daughters and three sons) from the 1550s to c. 1569.Since the third child Mingyi Swa was born on 27 November 1558 per (Ohn Shwe 1966: xxviii), they must have had the first child by 1556, if not earlier. The sixth child Minye Kyawswa II of Ava was born in Nadaw 929 ME (1 November to 30 November 1567) per (Zata 1960: 47). Their seventh and final child must have been born in late 1568 or early 1569 at the earliest. She became the chief queen in 1581 when Nanda ascended to the throne. Nanda presided over the collapse of the Toungoo Empire over the next 18 years. In 1599, her husband lost power, and the royal couple was sent to Toungoo (Taungoo) by the victor Minye Thihathu II of Toungoo. The victor kept the royal couple well at the palace but his son Natshinnaung assassinated the fallen king a year later. Minye Thihathu was dismayed, and protected the queen. He moved her to stay with her eldest daughter, who was married to his younger brother, Minye Kyawhtin (later known as Thado Dhamma Yaza), with a full retinue of attendants. The queen spent her last years there, and died in June 1606.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 130): 1st Waso 968 ME = 5 June 1606 to 4 July 1606 NS; 26 May 1606 to 24 June 1606 OS.

The documentary is about a family of monkeys living in ancient ruins founded in the jungles of Polonnaruwa in Sri Lanka. The film was released by Disneynature on April 17, 2015, the eighth nature documentary released under that label. Plot Maya is a toque macaque who was born at the bottom of the tree of her home. Even though she is a lowborn, the troupe's Alpha male, Rajah keeps a close eye on her, and considers Maya to be his property. One day, after escaping from a Leopard attack, a handsome male monkey named Kumar catches Maya's gaze from just outside of the troupe's territory. As Maya is in estrus, she and Kumar discretely mate, but are caught by Rajah, who knows that he has been duped. Kumar is chased away by Rajah and his sub-alpha male guards. Five months later, Maya gives birth to her son, Kip. With Kumar gone, Maya is left to raise, feed and care for her new son alone. As Monsoon season arrives, Maya and Kip are left outside in the rain, while the higher born enjoy shelter in the more preferable locations. Maya, however, is nothing if not scrappy. During a time of food scarcity after termite season ends, Maya takes Kip and leads the other lowborn Macaques to a lily pond, where they forage and even dive to procure the nutritious seed pods of the lotus lily. The narrator points out that the higher born would not even recognize the lotus lily pond as a possible food source. As Maya and her fellow lowborn submerge and emerge with seed pods, they are unknowingly being stalked by a monitor lizard. Maya, Kip and the lowborn watch in horror as one of their own is captured and eaten by the monitor lizard. Maya, with Kip clinging to her, then finds a catapillar patch and begins gorging on the highly nutritious caterpillars. When the trio of highborn, known as The Sisterhood, discover that Maya has not given them priority over this high protein, high value food source, the punishment from The Sisterhood is swift and severe. Maya is beaten mercilessly by the trio, who then kidnap her son, Kip, and take him far from Maya. After some time, The Sisterhood lose interest in Kip and abandon him, leaving him vulnerable, scared and alone in the woods. Toque macaque mothers and their infants bond and learn to recognize each other's voices at birth. Maya searches for hours for her lost child, frequently calling out to him vocally, until finally, the two are reunited, bringing the traumatic separation to a happy end. The next day, Maya leads the Lowborn far from their home into a neighboring city, where they find copious food. They raid a home full of food intended for a birthday party that's to occur later that afternoon. With the humans away and oblivious to the macaque's break-in, Maya and her cohorts gorge on birthday cake, bread, fruit and all other manner of food. During the actual raid, Kip remains safe with another lowborn, just outside of the home that his mother has raided. The lowborn return to their home in the forest at Castle Rock, and they fall asleep with an unfamiliar sensation; full stomachs. As the sun rises the next day, Maya awakens to what must at first seem like a dream. She rubs her eyes and does a double take as she sees Kip's father, Kumar, lurking just outside of the troupe's territory boundary. Having met with such a hasty exit with his last visit, Kumar is much wiser and more careful this time. He pays his dues, so to speak, gently and gradually introducing himself into the troupe. He first befriends the young macaques, playing and wrestling with them. He next befriends Rajah's body guards, and puts in lots of time grooming and building social bonds. Kumar is showing sure signs of being a natural born leader. His acceptance into the troupe is made certain when, during Jackfruit season, the troupe's Alpha, Rajah, shares Jackfruit with Kumar. Kumar is given an opportunity to further ingratiate himself with the troupe and prove his loyalty to Rajah when an outside troupe, led by Lex, comes to invade Castle Rock and take it as their own territory. Despite putting up a good fight, Rajah, Kumar, The Sisterhood, Maya, Kip and the entire troupe lose the battle and are displaced and homeless. Now homeless and in very unfamiliar circumstances, it is the highborn who follow and wait their turn as Maya leads the homeless troupe back to the city, where abundant food, shelter and opportunity await. Our troupe spends quite a bit of time in the city, rebuilding their strength, filling their bellies, and sleeping high on utility poles, but they never lose their desire to return to their home, Castle Rock, and reclaim it as their own. After they've regathered their strength, the troupe begins the long journey back through the forest toward Castle Rock. On this trip, however, it is Maya who leads, with Kumar right by her side and Kip close-by. The Sisterhood and the former Alpha, Rajah bring up the rear, having been dealt a healthy dose of humility during the last many days. As the troupe approaches Castle Rock, it is Kumar who leads the attack, supported by Rajah and crew. The \\"home team\\" manages to take back their home, chasing Lex and the invaders far into the forest. As the dust settles, however, we see that it is Maya, and not the Sisterhood, who now sits high in the tree. With Kip clinging to her chest and Kumar by her side, Maya has managed to do the seemingly impossible; she's changed her ranking in a hierarchy that had once predestined her to live at the bottom of the tree, surviving only on the scraps of those higher up the tree. In so doing, she has secured a bright future for herself, her son, Kip, and her soon to be born baby daughter. With Kumar now the Alpha of the troupe, Rajah assumes his place as one of Kumar's militia. He still attends diligently to The Sisterhood, but he seems to have lost their support and affection. Cast Monkey Kingdoms major toque macaque characters consist of lead female Maya, her newborn son Kip, the troupe's alpha male Raja, a trio of high status females called The Sisterhood, Grandpa, an elderly but once-fierce male, and Kumar, a newcomer wishing entrance to the monkey tribe. The film is narrated by Tina Fey.

This Day in Network Radio: A Daily Calendar of Births, Debuts, Cancellations and Other Events in Broadcasting History. McFarland & Company, Inc. . was an American tobacco auctioneer in Durham, North Carolina, United States. For more than three decades, Riggs appeared on the radio show Your Lucky Strike Hit Parade for the American Tobacco Company as the voice of Lucky Strike cigarettes. Riggs' career came to an end in 1969, when the United States Federal Trade Commission banned tobacco advertising over all forms of broadcast media. Later in life, Riggs moved to California and started ‚ÄúYour Community Fund,‚Äù a nonprofit with the mission to teach handicapped children various labor skills. Riggs is remembered today as a public figure and star performer of the 1940s and 1950s, having gained fame as part of the last generation of mass media tobacco advertisers. Biography =Early years= Lee Aubrey Riggs was born on February 18, 1907 in Silverdale, North Carolina ‚Äî a small community in rural Onslow County. His father, Mark, worked as a tobacco farmer, and in 1921 the entire family moved to Goldsboro, North Carolina, where Mark planted his own tobacco patch and established a truck farming business. Riggs attended school until the sixth grade, when assisting his father in the fields forced him to drop out. Riggs, however, never gained the same satisfaction growing crops as his father. Riggs discovered his passion while visiting the Faison Produce Auction in Sampson County, North Carolina, where he was awed by the antics and rapid-fire chants of the auctioneers. At just 14 years old, Riggs remembered mimicking the ‚Äústaccato style‚Ä¶humming Yankee Doodle.‚Äù By practicing at such a young age, he trained himself to speak at the staggering pace of 469 words per minute, which was thought to be a world record at the time. Riggs fondly recalled his years between the ages of fourteen and eighteen, when he would practice his chant daily, slowly edging toward mastery of the craft: > \\"I would walk up and down fences and sell the fence posts. I would sell > mailboxes and trees as we rode by. Sometimes my daddy would threaten me with > a beating to get me to stop 'that bunch of noise' I was making. But I > wouldn‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôd just get out of earshot and keep going. Sometimes when > I‚Äôd get into bed at night, I‚Äôd put my head under the cover and hum a chant. > Nothing in my life, before or since, captivated me any more than an > auctioneer‚Äôs chant. I knew one day somebody was going to hire me to sell > produce for them.\\" At age eighteen, Riggs‚Äô dream was finally realized as he began working at the Faison Market as a produce auctioneer. Although he loved the ability to practice his craft, Riggs craved the pace and excitement he saw in the eyes of tobacco auctioneers. For the next few years, however, Riggs was forced to continue to practice and build his reputation at the produce markets until afforded the opportunity for promotion. =Liberty Tobacco Warehouse= In the late 1800s, the loose-leaf auction system of selling tobacco spread throughout Virginia and The Carolinas. The system eliminated previous methods that allowed swindlers to falsely market barrels of tobacco, coined ‚Äúhogsheads‚Äù and sell them to tobacco companies. With the new system, farmers first brought their crop to warehouses where it was arranged into piles so that potential buyers could inspect the product. The warehousemen would then hire auctioneers to sell the farmers‚Äô tobacco to the buyers, typically men representing large corporations, such as American Tobacco Company. Auctions grew to be grand events, circus-like in both size and splendor. Many even held beauty pageants after the auctions, naming one lucky young woman the ‚ÄúTobacco Queen.‚Äù As these events became more prevalent, high demand required more skilled auctioneers in order to keep up with the buyers. Between 1870 and 1929, sales per auction went from 75 piles of tobacco per hour to a staggering 400. Because of the need for quick-tongued auctioneers, Riggs was hired while still in his early twenties by Liberty Warehouse in Durham, North Carolina as a tobacco auctioneer. The warehouse was one of the largest in the area, spanning the area of the 2.5-acre lot. A wooden placard on the wall indicated each row, and quick-hand calculations from buyers covered the walls. Riggs, however, handled the auction floor with grace and splendor. He understood that auctioneering was an art rather than a science, and gained popularity due to his ability to sell quickly, and at the highest prices. Later in life, he recounted an old trick, where he would get bidders to go higher by ignoring them for one round while looking them dead in the eye, and allowing the sale to go to another bidder. While Riggs certainly mastered the tricks of the trade, what truly separated him from the rest was his speed, hence the nickname ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù Riggs. In his prime, Riggs was able to rhythmically chant his auctioneer's call at 469 words per minute: ‚Äú31 dollar, 31, 1, ah 1, 32, 2, 2, toodle, toodle, toodle 2,‚Äù and so on. Rumors quickly spread throughout the South of the ‚Äútall, lanky auctioneer, with big ears and a protruding Adam‚Äôs apple, selling in Durham, North Carolina.‚Äù =Your Lucky Strike Hit Parade= Lucky Strike cigarettes targeted much of its advertising to women from the 1930s onwards, exemplified by this 1936 advertising image. After being purchased by the American Tobacco Company in 1905, Lucky Strike cigarettes grew immensely in popularity due to aggressive advertising campaigns ‚Äî an essential practice in the tobacco industry. The rebranding of Lucky Strike Cigarettes began in 1917 when the slogan ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Toasted‚Äù was created ‚Äî referring to the tobacco being toasted during manufacturing rather than sun dried to produce a more desirable taste. During the 1920s, Lucky Strike advertising was targeted primarily toward female audiences. A popular advertisement of the time read, ‚Äúreach for a Lucky instead of a sweet,‚Äù encouraging women to smoke one of their cigarettes instead of eating a sweet to aid in weight-loss. These ads had such a large impact that confectioner companies began running competing advertisements claiming that it was still possible to become thin while consuming sweets. By the late 1920s, George Washington Hill, president of the American Tobacco Company, was spending $7 million per year on advertisements, a number second only to General Motors. Unafraid of competitor's threats, Hill sought to expand his advertisement base beyond women, and began to sponsor a radio show entitled Your Hit Parade in 1935, later changed to Your Lucky Strike Hit Parade. The show was successful, but lacked the necessary talents to push it to the top of the charts. Thus, Hill began a search for the new face of the show to further increase viewership; the man he discovered was Lee Aubrey ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù Riggs. In 1937, news of Riggs‚Äô talent hit Hill's office. Days later, Hill chartered a private train and made his way to Durham from New York City to see Riggs perform his craft. George Washington Hill's interest in watching Riggs auction stemmed from his desire to further the rebranding for Lucky Strike Cigarettes. The main selling product of the American Tobacco Company, Lucky Strikes were regaining popularity and were now close to finally outselling the traditionally more popular Camel brand. Old marketing gimmicks seemed to have lost their appeal with consumers, as coupons and collectable cards no longer drove greater sales. After seeing Riggs for only a single day, Hill knew that he found the man that would be the new face of his organization. After the day's auctions were done, Riggs poignantly remembered Hill sitting him down, and saying to him, ‚ÄúI like what you got. How‚Äôd you like to go to New York with me and be on the radio?‚Äù Riggs was initially hesitant, but after receiving another letter from Hill on November 21, 1937, pleading him to come to the city and guest appear on Your Lucky Strike Hit Parade, Riggs agreed. Riggs debuted on the air December 27 of that same year, imitating his famous auctions, ending each one with the premium brightleaf tobacco being ‚ÄúSold to American!‚Äù Three months later in February, 1938, Riggs‚Äô popularity had grown to the point that he was named the ‚ÄúVoice of Lucky Strike,‚Äù and given a twenty-two year $550 per week contract. Within three years, Riggs‚Äô presence helped to catapult Lucky Strike Cigarettes ahead of all other brands by a three to one margin. Throughout his thirty-three year tenure with Lucky Strike, Riggs co-hosted shows with many of the most famous men on radio and television of the era, including Jack Benny, Fred Allen, Kay Kyser, and Jack Paar. Most notably, Riggs‚Äô appeared many times on television advertising Lucky Strike Cigarettes with singer Frank Sinatra. With the aid of Riggs, Lucky Strike was able to broaden their marketing basis and become the industry leader in cigarette sales. Riggs was also known for using his fame to support charitable causes. For instance, during World War II, Riggs helped raise more than $17 million in war bonds for the United States government, and throughout his career it has been reported that he raised $220 million for various philanthropic organizations. =Later life= Riggs‚Äô career lasted thirty-three years but was cut short due to government regulation, specifically the passing of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1970, banning all tobacco advertising on radio and television. While Riggs never publicly aired frustration over the show being cancelled, his later actions suggest that he was not pleased with the regulation. In 1981, Riggs began helping industry promotion aimed at winning back smokers, and he outwardly opposed legislation attempting to ban smoking in public areas. Riggs also came out and stated that he did not believe smoking tobacco caused lung cancer, but rather he claimed that \\"anybody can have cancer of the lungs.\\" That said, it is not absurd to see Riggs‚Äô emotional attachment to the plant that brought him everything: \\"Tobacco has been good to me. Tobacco helped me climb out of poverty. All my success I owe to tobacco.\\" After Congress outlawed the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio, Riggs decided to dedicate the remainder of his life, and a good deal of his accumulated wealth, to helping those less fortunate than he. Riggs moved to Fullerton, California, where he established ‚ÄúYour Community Fund‚Äù ‚Äî a nonprofit organization that provides youths with learning handicaps training in skilled labor, particularly furniture-making. For his work in both revitalizing the tobacco industry and contributing his life's earnings to charity, North Carolina honored Riggs in 1982 by having ‚ÄúSpeed Riggs Day.‚Äù =Death= On February 1, 1987, Riggs died of congestive heart failure in Goldsboro, North Carolina. He was 79. =Legacy= While his fame no longer matched that of the 1940s and 1950s, the tobacco industry still hailed him for his many contributions, and on February 27, 2003, Riggs was inducted into the North Carolina Agricultural Hall of Fame. While today, Riggs no longer remains a household name, it is said that whenever an auctioneer throws a bit of zest and style into their chant, it is quite likely mimicking Speed Riggs.

His reign coincided with a period of upheavals in Sudanic History that saw a series of religious Jihads waged by the Fula People. In 1807, after a protracted struggle with Fula clans, Muhammad Alwali was ambushed and assassinated at Burum-Burum in modern Kano. His death marked the end of the Kutumbawa line of Hausa aristocrats in Kano and the fall of the 800 plus year old Bagauda Dynasty.  Ascension  Muhammad Alwali was the son of Sultan Yaji II and Baiwa. In 1781 he succeeded his brother, Dauda Abasama to become the third successive son of Yaji II to ascend the throne of Kano. = Reign = The Kano Sultanate was consistently at war to maintain hold of trade routes and his reign came at a time when famine was a regular occurrence. These factors coupled with increased taxation by the aristocracy saw dwindling fortunes for the Sultanate. Traders were abandoning the state for more favorable conditions in the Sahel. When Alwali became Sultan, he immediately collected grains of sorghum and millet to prepare for war and famine. However, a famine devastated the city soon after. = Dirki = Dirki was a fetish object that was held sacred in Kano. It was made of a Quran covered in multiple layers of goat skin or cow hide introduced around the 16th century in the reign of Muhammad Zaki. Alwali was asked to provide forty cows as a sacrifice to Dunki but he refused. He went as far as attacking the object with an axe and exposing its contents. The people then murmured that he will be expelled from Kano just as he as expelled the Quran from Dunki. = Ciroma Dan Mama = Over time, the Kano royal family had been divided into multiple factions. Since the first civil war in 1565, internal strife had ravaged the Kano royal house. A second civil war broke out after El Kutumbi's death in 1648. Alwali's father Yaji, endured a bitter relationship with his brother, the then Sultan Muhammad Sharefa and his sons who succeeded him. Yaji was exiled to a desolate life of penury. During this time, he heavily relied on a local farmer and tobacco seller from Katagum. When Yaji ascended the throne after the death of Alhaji Kabe, he adopted this figure as his son and gave him the prestigious title of Ciroma (Crown Prince), and entrusted the resources needed for the ascension of his sons in his hands. It is believed that this figure or his son, called Dan Mama was stripped of the title of Ciroma during Alwali's reign who instead gave the title to his son. The deposed Ciroma, though scorned, continued to play a role in the Sultan's court and would later play a pivotal role in his downfall. Tradition relates that his treachery sealed Alwali's fate.  War with the Fula  = Background = Alwali was already facing a struggle in securing his throne and the ascension of his son against the faction loyal to the lineage of his uncle Muhammad Sharefa and another faction that contained the remnants of the Rumfawa in Kano. Unbeknownst to him, a more serious threat was looming. When Shehu Usman Dan Fodio's Jihad began in Gobir, he sent a letter to all Hausa Kings who had already sworn to support the King of Gobir. It is related that Muhammad Alwali was on the verge of accepting the Shehu's message when he was dissuaded by Ciroma Dan Mama who then wrote to the Shehu offering his support in exchange for a hundred towns. Kano was home to a number of Fula clans who had began settling since the 14th century including the Jobawa, Sullubawa, Danejawa, Yolawa, Yerimawa, Modibawa, Gyanawa, Zarawa, Toronkawa, Mundubawa, and Dambazawa. Many Fula chiefs had assumed various powerful titles in Kano, including the leadership of various towns. The Kutumbawa Kings had alienated themselves from their masses through their heavy taxation and open syncreticisms and the Fula also found allies in hausa muslims and aggrieved peasants in Kano, led by Alkali Mallam Usman. These Hausas according to WF Gowers may have been just as many as the Fula. Muhammad Bakatsine, the leader of the Jobawa, who were one of the most established Fula clans in Kano, had been with Dan Fodio in Gobir but returned to Kano after the Fulas defeat by Gobir at Tsuntua. The Shehu soon sent a letter to his supporters in Kano after which they withdrew from their communities and assembled in preparation for Jihad. = Early Encounters = A group of the Shehu's followers made for Kwazzazabo where they frightened the villagers and seized their grains and in the ensuing scuffle slew one of the farmers who had refused them access to his stock of grains. The Sarkin Bebeji immediately alerted Sultan Alwali who was then situated at the newly reinforced Takai. The Sultan in trying to assess the situation sent a small force led by Gainaku and instructed him to burn the Fula compounds and seize whatever he pleased from them. Gainaku though succeeding in killing some of the fula was forced to retreat. Alwali then sent for Muhammad Bakatsine and accused him of treachery. The clan leader however denied any involvement and swore his innocence on a Quran but on his way back proceeded to seize the town of Gogel. After consultation with his advisers, Alwali who still underestimated the severity of his situation then sent a military general, Barde Bakori with a force he deemed sufficient to disband the rebels but was also turned back. When the Barde returned to Alwali who had at that point left Takai and returned to Kano, the Sultan faced different opinions from his advisers with one faction calling for a declaration of war and the other faction seeking a more diplomatic approach. The Sultan had initially wanted to accept the Shehu's call and he opted for the latter view. He put together a delegation which included Arab and local scholars who were granted an audience by the rebels but publicly humiliated and turned back. One of the delegates was said to have died of fright shortly after returning to Kano. = Kano's First Assault = After rejecting his offer for peace, Alwali and his advisers decided to summon a faction of his troops led by the Sarkin Dawaki Ali and ordered them to capture the fula leaders and women but to slay everyone else. Before they got to the Fula stronghold in Kwazzazabo, the rebels had already shored up their defenses while their leaders had withdrawn to Kogo in anticipation. When the Sarkin Dawaki and his troops broke initial resistance and made it into the fula settlement, he instructed the Barde to set their huts on fire but the Barde insisted that they had to collect the Shehus flag first. This hesitation proved costly; As soon as the Barde collected the flag, he was greeted by a hoard of Fula warriors and even women. The hausa horses were spooked by the pandemonium and in their retreat, the cavalry was confined to a narrow space due to trenches built by the Fula and were chased by a rain of arrows and spears. A lot of their soldiers fell off their horses and lost their lives, the Sarkin Dawaki barely escaped. The Fula gained horses, muskets, coats of mail, armors, swords, quilted armors, and many other weapons. = Expansion of the Jihad = In the wake of the Fula victory against the Sarkin Dawaki, Sarkin Fulanin Dambarta, Malam Maiyaki, also known as Dan Tunku, who later founded the Kazaure Emirate switched his allegiance from Alwali to the Shehu. Alwali did not learn of this perfidy until it was too late. The Fula now also had the confidence and firepower to move across Kano. They soon made for the town of Godiya but were repelled with many losses by Dan Tama, the ancestral ruler of Godiya. They eventually broke their defenses and burnt the city to the ground and neighboring towns submitted to avoid the same fate. During their expeditions, they also pillaged Fula herders who wouldn't join their Jihad. They then took Karaye after a small resistance but immediately saw an army led by the Dan Tama of Godiya and Barde Bakori. Neither side expected to encounter the other. The Dan Tama and Barde attacked nonetheless but the Fula had taken up strong positions around the river bed and repelled their attackers. Karaye was the first major town to fall to the Fula. While in Karaye, Mallam Musa arrived and was given the Flag for the Jihad against Zazzau after which he proceeded to his destination. In order to use their superior mobility and field knowledge, as well as to avoid the possibility of facing the combined forces of Kano, Katsina, and Daura, the fula dispersed their armies to force Alwali to do the same. They soon converged near Tofa and were promptly attacked by a small Hausa force from Tatarawa and Damargu which they repelled and captured many horses from. The Fula captured Tofa, Bichi and then Tatarawa. = Enlisting of Tuaregs = Alwali decided to acquire the services of the Tuaregs of Adar led by Tambari Agumbil who had experience fighting against the Fula in Gobir. Agumbil received the handsome sum of four million cowries to come into Alwalii's service. Agumbil's forces were strengthened by a band of hausa warriors with whom he attacked the Fula at Tatarawa. Their attack sent the Fula to flight but they soon retaliated with a flurry of arrows aimed at the Hausa wing and Agumbil came to their aid, immediately losing his life in the process. His forces were in disarray and a massacre ensued. They followed the retreating forces to Tomas and collected prisoners and booty. = Successes = The Sultan decided to change his tactic. He reinforced his experienced soldiers and directed them to engage in minor assaults but to avoid open battles, hoping that attrition would wear the rebels out. His new strategy yielded positive results and afforded the hausa army the time to regroup. The Sultan then sent out raiders as a decoy to fool the rebels and in the resulting battle, the Fula lost many soldiers and were forced to retreat. The Fula then proceeded to take Madaci and Jalli but lost Malam Dan Zabuwa in the process. = The Battle of Dan Yaya = After Madaci and Jalli fell, the Sultan himself set out of Kano with a large force which included a heavy cavalry of seven hundred horsemen. He soon took and razed Dawaki which was situated between Madaci and Jalli. His army then occupied the town but were subject to constant harassment by a concentrated force of rebels using arrows and guerrilla tactics, trying to draw his cavalry out to open field. It was here that Alwali learned of his betrayal by Ciroma Dan Mama and Sarkin Fulanin Danbarta who both reinforced Fula forces. The Ciroma's forces would account for a significant portion of Kano's army. Alwali proceeded to Dan Yaya and while reinforcements from Bornu were impeded by a Fula blockade, he welcomed the Sultans of Katsina and Daura and their armies. The Fula were however further reinforced by their kin from Ringim, Jahun and other areas. At Dan Yaya, three to four months of fighting took place and it is said that up to ninety three fights took place within this period. The Sultan however did not fully commit his army until the last three days. It is possible he was waiting for further reinforcements from Daura, Katsina, Bornu and other placers but this did not materialize. Alwali then took to the battlefield himself and launched a heavy attack on the rebel stronghold in Sabon Ruwa and many houses were burnt. However, the rebels were soon reinforced by their allies in neighboring areas. Alwali was then pushed back from Sabon Ruwa with both sides recording heavy losses. The Sultans army attacked again in the evening and more reinforcements came to Alwalis aid from Daura. Kano forces launched a less intense attack in the morning. During this time, the Fula camp was running short of supplies and contemplated retreating to Gaya to instead aid Muhammad Bakatsine who had so far been unable to capture what would be perhaps the most important town in Kano. They argued against this retreat believing it would reinvigorate the Sultan and his army's morale, instead deciding to roll the dice on one last major attack. The Fula came out in the open field and the Sultans army immediately charged. The battle started from Maghrib prayers (around 7:00PM) until Subhi Prayers (around 5:00AM) when the Fula were able to stealthily set fire to the Hausa camp which contained their women and supplies. On seeing this, the Hausa retreated towards their tents and the battle soon became a slaughter in favor of the Fula. As the fire razed through their bivouacs, Alwali fled for Kano with his sons and other officials. The Sultans of Katsina and Daura also fled home with what was left of their armies while the remaining soldiers fought a losing battle against the rampaging rebels. The Fula took most of Kano soon after. = Fall of Kano and Exile to Zazzau = After his crushing defeat at Dan Yaya, Alwali reviewed his situation with his advisors and clerics. He once again sent another delegation to the rebels, agreeing to surrender to their demands while remaining in office as a tributary. His offer was rejected and was told that dialogue was not an option and that they would attack Kano on the 12th of Rabi' al-awwal. He fled Kano for Zazzau forty days before the due date. = Last Stand = While the Kano Chronicle suggests he was immediately turned out of Zazzau, it is widely accepted that he stayed in Zazzau for a few months. During this time, Gaya, which was ruled by the lineage of Alwali's grandmother resisted the forces of Muhammad Bakatsine and remained loyal to the Sultan. This inspired Alwali to make one last stand. He ordered Sarkin Gaya Gujabu to launch an attack on Muhammad Bakatsine who had moved and assembled a force at Wudil. Gujabu was defeated with heavy losses. Gaya was soon overrun by the forces of Muhammad Bakatsine and Gujabu was slain. Meanwhile, Alwali had already left Zazzau for Burum-Burum which was led by his relative Wambai Tagwai when he learnt of Gaya's fall. The Fula soon assembled a heavy force led by Muhammad Bakatsine and launched a relentless attack on Burum-Burum.  Death  Burum-Burum withstood the Fula onslaught for several weeks but eventually succumbed to the unabated assault. While the Sultans son Umaru escaped, Alwali lost his life in the clash that ensued. His death signaled the end of the Kutumbawa and the fall of a dynasty that according to the Kano Chronicle trace their lineage to Bayajidda. = Aftermath = After the Sultan's death, and with no leader to rally behind, the rest of Kano submitted. Alwali's son Umaru fled towards Damagaram where he met the ousted Sultans of Katsina and Daura. The Sultan of Katsina would establish a kingdom in Maradi where his descendants use the title of \\"Sarkin Katsina\\" and that of Alwali use \\"Sarkin Kano\\". A descendant of the Sultan of Daura was reinstated as the Emir of Daura by the British in 1904. After a few months, Dan Fodio appointed Suleiman Abahama, a modest young Imam as the first Fula Emir of Kano, subject to the Sokoto Caliphate. The Fula leaders of the Jihad soon assumed various titles. Alkali Usman who led the initial Hausa supporters of the Jihad though receiving much respect did not gain much status or power. His faction were dubbed as \\"Hausawa\\". Ciroma Dan Mama would receive his one hundred towns of mostly hamlets. Him and his hausa followers were dubbed as \\"Kutumbawa\\". Later on when the affairs of Kano became difficult to administer for the Fula kings, Ciroma Dan Mama helped acquaint them with the Hausa administrative system and practices. The rest of the people of Kano were characterized by the pejorative term \\"Habe\\" by the new royal house and subject to grating conditions. Hausa resistance would continue through erratic raids by Ningi which came under muslim Hausa scholars led by Malam Hamza who opposed the discriminatory practices of the Fula emirs against the Habe, Maradi which became the new home of the deposed hausa aristocracy, and the Sultanate of Damagaram. The latter, under Ahmadu Kuran Daga (Maje Rinji) gathered a formidable arsenal of thousands of locally manufactured canons and muskets and was on the verge of taking the Kano capital after sending the Emirs forces into retreat when an illness and news of a French invasion sent him racing back home but not before collecting a great haul of booty from Kano.The Emir at the time, Aliyu Babba, had paid 30 million cowries for intensive prayers and it was believed these prayers were why Rinji's assault seized. = Yaji's Sermon = \\"Yau Yaji, Gobe Yaji, Jibi Yaji, Gata Yaji, Bayan wannan, Oho?\\" When Alwali's father, Yaji became Sultan, he made a cryptic statement which translates to \\"Today Yaji, tomorrow Yaji, the day after tomorrow Yaji, the Day after that Yaji, after that, Who knows?\\". This statement is believed to have foreshadowed the events that transpired after his death. Yaji's vision was to at least have his three sons ascend after him and enjoined the Ciroma to that purpose. Yaji ruled, and next after him was his son, and next after was another one of his sons and next after him was Alwali who was the last ruler under the House of Kutumbi.

Early life and education Lindgren was born in Lanyon, Iowa, in 1939. He received a B.S. in 1960 from Iowa State University and his Ph.D. from the University of Missouri in 1968. Jon Lindgren was Chair of the Economics Department at North Dakota State University. Mayor of Fargo Lindgren served as mayor of Fargo, North Dakota from 1978 until 1994 and was the second longest serving mayor; he was succeeded by Bruce Furness. Lindgren was staunchly opposed to the 12th Avenue bridge connecting Fargo, North Dakota and Moorhead, Minnesota, before he was elected mayor of Fargo. He did not agree with the findings of the Bridge Company and other organizations. Lindgren did not feel a bridge was necessary and he focused on the impact the bridge would have on residential neighborhoods, the environment, the structure of the bridge, who would pay for its construction, and how feasible the bridge would be economically. Lindgren held some liberal views on LGBT rights and abortion, which caused some controversy within the city. Political positions =LGBT issues= Lindgren was possibly the first elected official in North Dakota to express support for gay rights in North Dakota. The Fargo LGBT community had several popular hangouts in the 1970s, i.e. \\"The Flame\\" bar, Roger's Sandwich Shop on Broadway and a Chinese restaurant that became a disco at night. However, no business existed that primarily catered to the gay community. It was in the early 1980s that a business owner named Lenny Tweeden sought to open a gay bar named \\"My Place\\", in the face of significant local opposition. As mayor, Lindgren was supportive of the right for this establishment to exist. Years later, Tweeden said that \\"My Place\\" survived for as long as it did, thanks in no small part to Lindgren. While Lindgren was unable to pass any citywide LGBT civil right bill as mayor, he did issued several official pride proclamations in the 1980s, which were opposed by a majority of the city council, and publicly expressed his support for LGBT rights. (audio) =Abortion= Lindgren was instrumental in helping to keep violence to a minimum during the 1980s - early 1990s, when some advocates were willing to use violence to advance their cause. There were no instances of violence nor any threats of violence. At its height, the Lambs of Christ pro- life group, were arrested for what most term civil disobedience for blocking access to the abortion facility by passive means. Many in the group were convicted for the misdemeanors of criminal trespass and preventing arrest as reported in the New York Times. Other work Jon is a former president of the Red River Free Thinkers and publishes frequently on their website. Lindgren's blog, Views of a Freethinker is a Featured Areal Voices in Forum Communications Company's newspapers. Since the blog's inception in 2011 it has had over half a million visits. The blog has evolved into a virulent anti- theist diatribe, evidenced by such blog titles as \\"Trump Is The Death Rattle Of White Evangelical America\\", \\"The No-Priests-Alone-With-Children Project\\", \\"Religions Love Rape\\", \\"Jesus Killed a Fig tree\\", and \\"An Anti Abortion Weapon: Monitoring Miscarrages\\".
