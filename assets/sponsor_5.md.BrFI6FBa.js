He has created a range of works from furniture and product through to restaurants and bars, to residential properties both in the United Kingdom and internationally. He is known for his use of light and dark space, natural light and playfulness with materials. He also lectures extensively on architecture and design, regularly serves as university studio critic, and is a board member for civic institutions and jury awards programs.  Biography  Andy Martin was born in Sydney. He studied architecture at the University of Technology, and completed his training at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London. Whilst practising architecture, Martin continued to develop his skills as a furniture designer, being the first to integrate his experience of surfboard design with furniture and sculptural forms. Martin moved to Paris in 1992 where he began working with Marc Newson on several interior projects. It was through this partnership and collaborations on Coast restaurant London, and Mash & Air Manchester, that Martin developed his interest in restaurant design. Martin's client on these projects was the restaurateur Oliver Peyton. Striking up a relationship with Peyton, Martin was appointed as Concept Architect for the flagship Mash 02 restaurant in London. Mash 02 itself responded to a more refined view of the concept started with Mash & Air, with the design becoming more iconic, more essential, and hence, easily transposable to future Mash sites. In 1999, Martin was asked to design Isola restaurant after beating off the likes of Zaha Hadid. This next major project undertaken showed the practice actively shape and change the UK‚Äôs bar and restaurant culture, through its refined, mature and yet still playful style. After the success of this restaurant Martin formed a new practice, Andy Martin Architects, in which he took on Director Tom Davies who came to the company as a Project Manager. Since AMA was set up, Martin has moved on to design many residential properties, including the Olga Polizzi and William Shawcross residence in West London. AMA continues to design restaurants and bars around London and have been working on projects in Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, California and Greece.

Winter is long and cold, but dry and sunny.\\"http://www.chinci.com/travel/pax/w/1793692/Taigu/CN/China/0/#\\" Government Downtown Taigu contains the local government institutions and buildings supporting the needs of the district. Significant buildings include the Taigu People's Government Building, Taigu People's Court Building, and Taigu People's Procuratorate Building. Industry While economic activity in the Taigu area is primarily agricultural, major non-agricultural industries in Taigu include production of malleable cast iron, cast steel, insulator fittings, radiator piping, and other small industrial components. Education Notable academic institutions include: Shanxi Agricultural University, on the former site of the Ming Hsien schools established by the Oberlin Shansi Memorial Association, founded in 1907, and located on the eastern side of downtown Taigu, is one of the few remaining Chinese agricultural universities situated in a farming area, (Simplified Chinese) and Taigu Normal University.

The accident, also known as the Hopkinstown rail disaster or the Coke Ovens collision, occurred at 9:48 am, when the 09:10 passenger train from Treherbert to Cardiff, heading towards Pontypridd and carrying about 100 people, rounded the bend at Gyfeillion Lower signal box with a clear signal ahead. The train collided with a stationary coal train that was using the same line. The impact caused the underframe of the front carriage to rise up and pierce the carriage directly behind it.Hopkinstown rail disaster Rhondda Cynon Taf, library service On 24 January a preliminary hearing was conducted at the New Inn Hotel in Pontypridd, where interviews were held and witness statements were taken. On the following Thursday a coroner's inquest was opened at Pontypridd Police Court. The inquest heard conflicting reports from signalmen Hutchings of the Gyfeillion Lower and Quick of the Rhondda Cutting Junction, the other signal box in control of the stretch of line where the accident took place. Due to lack of definite evidence an open verdict was returned; though the fireman of the coal train was censured for not alerting the signal box of the stationary train's position as he was required to do under Rule 55. The Board of Trade enquiry, subsequent to the inquest, concluded that Hutchings had not, in fact, given the \\"Train Entering Section\\" signal for the coal train after Quick had accepted it, and Quick had subsequently accepted the passenger train, having forgotten that he had accepted the coal train earlier. Hutchings was also criticised for not replacing his signals to \\"Danger\\" as soon as he was aware of the conflict ‚Äì if he had done so, the driver of the passenger train would have had about 30 seconds to observe the danger signal, and, even if he had been unable to stop the train, its speed would have been greatly reduced and the collision much less severe. A contributory factor was the use of two-position block instruments, which did not have distinct \\"Line Blocked\\" and \\"Line Clear\\" indications. If a three-position instrument had been used, Hutchings would not have offered the passenger train forward (and Quick would not have accepted it) while the instrument was still showing \\"Line Clear\\" for the coal train.

Surratt Boarding House in Washington, D.C. was the site of meetings of conspirators to kidnap and subsequently to assassinate U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. It was operated as a boarding house by Mary Surratt from September 1864 to April 1865. About the house The building in 1890 The building, at 604 H Street NW, standing three-and-one-half stories tall, was constructed by Jonathan T. Walker in 1843.Kauffmann, p. 412. It has been described as being in the Early Republic or Federal style or in \\"vernacular Greek Revival\\" style. It stands on a lot measuring . The building is wide, facing directly onto the sidewalk on south side of the street, and has a depth of . The building was altered in 1925 so that the first floor could be used as a commercial space. John Surratt purchased the house from Augustus A. Gibson on December 6, 1853, and operated it as a boarding house. After her husband died in 1862, Mary Surratt chose to rent her tavern/residence in nearby Surrattsville, Maryland, to John M. Lloyd, a former Washington, D.C., policeman and Confederate sympathizer, and moved into the Washington boarding house. In 1865, the military tribunal trying the conspirators of Lincoln's assassination heard testimony from residents at the boarding house that Surratt had regularly met with John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln conspirators at the house. Lloyd told the tribunal that he had been told by Surratt to provide field glasses and guns to Booth and co-conspirator David Herold. It was on the basis of this evidence that Surratt was convicted and sentenced to death. For her role as a member of the Abraham Lincoln assassination conspiracy plot, she became the first woman to be executed by the United States federal government. She was executed by hanging.Farquhar, Michael. \\"The Haunting Tale of Mary Surratt; They Hanged Her in 1865. Did Her Ghost Escape the Gallows?\\", The Washington Post, October 31, 1991.

He supported the Parliamentary cause during the English Civil War, but fell out with Oliver Cromwell during the Interregnum. At the Restoration he was exempted from the general pardon. Life Pyne was the son of Thomas Pyne and his wife Amey Hanham, daughter of Thomas Hanham, serjeant-at-law, of Wimbome Minster, Dorset.Burke, p. 1242 In 1625, Pyne was elected Member of Parliament for Poole. He was re-elected in 1626 and 1628 and sat until 1628 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In 1629, his father already dead, he succeeded to the estates of his grandfather in several counties including the manors of Crewkerne and Little Windsor. In April 1640, Pyne was re-elected MP for Poole in the Short Parliament, and he was elected again for Poole in the Long Parliament in November 1640. In 1643 he was listed as a colonel of the militia raised for the —Åounty of Somerset, a commissioner for levying taxes for the parliament. Though a strong republican, and an opponent of the Church and churchmen, he withdrew from taking any part as soon as he saw what he thought were the ultimate designs of Oliver Cromwell, and he strongly disapproved of the trial and death of King Charles I. Pyne refused also to join any of the plots and conspiracies from the death of the Protector to the restoration of the monarchy under King Charles II. However he was one of the twenty persons excepted out of the Act of Oblivion. Pyne succeeded at last in obtaining the pardon of himself and eldest son (then 27 years of age), which was signed at Breda in 1660. His circumstances appear to have been much reduced as a result of the civil wars, and he seems to have sold and encumbered his property to pay off debts, and perhaps to meet fines and penalties, the consequence of his part in it. Pyne died in 1679 at a \\"very advanced age\\". Family Pyne married Eleanor Hanham, daughter of Sir John Hanham, of the City of London, and of Wimborne, Dorset. She was possessed of a good fortune and various estates and died 1662, aged 53, leaving him with four sons and two daughters. In 1668, Pyne married for the second time, to Amey, daughter of John White, of Tharnhull, who died in 1692, leaving no children. Pyne disinherited his eldest son, John Pyne, who died unmarried, at Pitney, in 1696 and lost his second son Arthur at Aleppo. His estates therefore went to his third son Charles.

Biography An avid speed skater in his youth, Maihofer was a member of the German national team at the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Maihofer served in the Wehrmacht in World War II. He studied law at the University of Freiburg, and received his Doctor of Laws degree in 1950. Maihofer gained his habilitation in 1953 and eventually obtained a professorship at the University of Saarbr√ºcken. Maihofer did not join the Free Democratic Party until 1969.

In 1974, he succeeded Hans- Dietrich Genscher as Federal Ministry of the Interior, and‚Äîduring the German Autumn‚Äîhad to back several restraints of civil liberty. Illegal wiretapping During the German Autumn the Red Army Fraction increased their activities. Suspected contacts were monitored in the hope of gaining information that might lead to the capture of the militants. Klaus Traube, a nuclear industrialist, was sympathetic to groups opposed to nuclear power. He was suspected of passing secret information to left-wing radicals. In 1975, in a covert operation called \\"Operation M√ºll\\" (\\"operation trash\\"), the BND, under the supervision of Maihofer planted a number of wiretaps in Traube's home. They also later informed his employer who, as a result, dismissed him. This illegal operation was uncovered in 1977 by the magazine Der Spiegel. Maihofer resigned from his office in 1978, after taking responsibility for the illegal wiretapping. Maihofer returned to his chair at the University of Bielefeld which he held since 1970.

The 8.5 magnitude earthquake occurred at 19:32 (local time) on June 15, 1896, approximately off the coast of Iwate Prefecture, Honshu. It resulted in two tsunamis which destroyed about 9,000 homes and caused at least 22,000 deaths. The waves reached a then-record height of ; this would remain the highest on record until waves from the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake exceeded that height by more than . Seismologists have discovered the tsunami's magnitude (Mt = 8.2) was much greater than expected for the estimated seismic magnitude. This earthquake is now regarded as being part of a distinct class of seismic events, the tsunami earthquake. Geology Houses heavily damaged by the earthquake The epicenter lies just to the west of the Japan Trench, the surface expression of the west-dipping subduction zone. The trench forms part of the convergent boundary between the Pacific and Eurasian plates. Magnitude The unusual disparity between the magnitude of the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami may be due to a combination of forces: # the tsunami was caused by a slope failure triggered by the earthquake # the rupture velocity was unusually low Scientists believe the effect of subducted sediment beneath the accretionary wedge was responsible for a slow rupture velocity. The effects of a 20¬∞ dipping fault along the top of the subducting plate was found to match both the observed seismic response and tsunami, but required a displacement of 10.4 m. The displacement was reduced to a more reasonable value after the extra uplift caused by the deformation of sediments in the wedge and a shallower fault dip of 10¬∞ was considered. This revised fault model gave a magnitude of =8.0‚Äì8.1. A figure much closer to the estimated actual tsunami magnitude. A magnitude of 8.5 on the moment magnitude scale has also been estimated for this event. Tsunami On the evening of June 15, 1896, communities along the Sanriku coast in northern Japan were celebrating a Shinto holiday and the return of soldiers from the First Sino- Japanese War. After a small earthquake, there was little concern because it was so weak and many small tremors had also been felt in the previous few months. However, 35 minutes later the first tsunami wave struck the coast, followed by a second a few minutes later.Corkill, Edan, \\"Heights of survival\\", Japan Times, 12 June 2011, pp. 9‚Äì10. The damage was particularly severe because the tsunamis coincided with high tides. Most deaths occurred in Iwate and Miyagi although casualties were also recorded from Aomori and Hokkaido. The power of the tsunami was great: large numbers of victims were found with broken bodies or missing limbs. As was their normal practise each evening, the local fishing fleets were all at sea when the tsunamis struck. In the deepwater, the wave went unnoticed. Only when they returned the next morning did they discover the debris and bodies. Wave heights of up to were also measured in Hawaii. They destroyed wharves and swept several houses away. Legacy Preventive coastal measures were not implemented until after another tsunami struck in 1933. Due to higher levels of tsunami awareness, fewer casualties were recorded following the Sanriku earthquake. Nevertheless, the earthquake of 11 March 2011 caused a huge tsunami that resulted in thousands of deaths across the same region and the nuclear disaster at Fukushima.

L.S. Chang as he was commonly known, played a key role in Republic of China (ROC)‚Äôs political, economic, financial, and foreign affairs as well as in Kuomintang affairs from the 1920s until his death in Taiwan in 1971. Throughout his political life over four decades, Chang served in numerous important posts within both the KMT and the ROC‚Äôs local and central governments. He was a rare example of Chinese political virtues, noted for his integrity and honesty. He is remembered for numerous achievements and deeds, including his role in assisting Chen Cheng (1897-1965), former Taiwan provincial governor, Premier, and Vice President, to launch Taiwan‚Äôs local autonomy, economic and land reforms. Early life and political career Chang was born into a poor family in Leting, Hebei. Having studied in Nankai Middle School in Tianjin and Chaoyang University in Peking with impressive records, Chang was selected and sent to study in France under the work-study program. In 1922, he was enrolled in University of Paris and majored in political science. In Paris, he became associated with Zhou Enlai, who also joined the same work-study program in France and who later tried to enlist Chang to serve under Mao Zedong. In 1924, Chang returned to China and became a member of the KMT. In 1927, in the midst of Northern Expedition and of the split between the rightists and the leftists within the KMT, Chang served in the Political Department of the 10th Army of the National Revolutionary Army then based in Wuhan and under the influence of the KMT left-wingers. Shortly after Chiang Kai-shek purged the leftists and stood out as the new strongman within the KMT, Chang was sent to North China to handle local party affairs. In 1928, Chiang completed the Northern Expedition and unified China. By this time, Chang had joined the ‚ÄúCentral Club‚Äù (C.C. Clique) and became a close associate with Chen Lifu and Chen Guofu, leaders of the Clique. In 1929, he served as secretary of the KMT Department of Organization headed by Chen Guofu. Political rise In 1931, Chang was elected the first standing member of the KMT central executive committee, marking his rise within the KMT party hierarchy. Between 1932 and 1935, he was in charge of KMT's party affairs in North China. He played a crucial role in bringing together local Chinese military leaders at the moment when the KMT was facing growing Japanese military encroachments. As KMT's special representative in Tianjin and a member of the Hebei Provincial Government, Chang brokered a military pact with several heavyweight North Chinese military leaders, including Song Zheyuan (ÂÆãÂì≤ÂÖÉ), Qin Dechun (Áß¶Âæ∑Á¥î), Shang Zhen (ÂïÜÈúá), and Yu Xuezhong (‰∫éÂ≠∏Âø†). This pact assured the military support from the North Chinese regional leaders to the Nanjing-based Nationalist central government under Chiang Kai-shek, who was having difficulties maintaining the Nationalist position in North China. In 1936, Chiang appointed Chang to head the KMT Department of Organization. After the all-out Japanese invasion of China in July 1937, Chang was further appointed to several key positions within the party and the government. It was at the initial stage of the war against Japan that Chang gradually distanced himself from the powerful C.C. Clique and instead began working closely with General Chen Cheng, then Governor of Hubei Province, in launching anti- Communist campaigns in the KMT-controlled areas. In spring 1944, Chiang Kai- shek asked Chang for a strategy as to how to prepare for the retrocession of Taiwan after the defeat of Japan. In December 1944, Chang was made Minister of Interior. After the Japanese surrendered in August 1945, he became a member of the KMT delegation to participate in the Political Consultative Conference to discuss with the Chinese Communist counterparts about China's postwar reconstruction. In 1948, in the heat of the Chinese civil war, Chang became Vice Premier of the ROC government, burdened with such challenging and difficult tasks as national resources relocations, currency reforms, anti- inflations, and anti-corruptions. The Taiwan years In 1949, the KMT was on the losing side of the Chinese Civil War in Mainland China and Taiwan became the KMT's last hope. In August, Chang flew to Taiwan to join General Chen Cheng, then the provincial governor, in defending the KMT's last territorial base. In addition to assisting Chen Cheng's land and economic reform programs on the island, Chang also began studying the possible implementation of Taiwan's local autonomy and election. In March 1950, when Chen Cheng became Premier, Chang was made, again, Vice Premier. He served the post until 1954, when Chiang Kai-shek appointed him Secretary-General of the KMT Central Executive Committee. In 1959, Chang was appointed ROC's ambassador to Japan. During Chang's tenure, however, Taiwan's relations with Japan declined considerably. Japan Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda was determined to improve Tokyo's relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC). He became the first Japanese Prime Minister in post-World War II to support and approve of a direct commercial relation between Japan and the PRC. He openly disagreed with Chiang Kai-shek's national policy of the military recovery of the Chinese mainland, calling it unrealistic and illusory. In late 1963, when a member of the PRC delegation of mechanists named Zhou Hongqing sought political asylum in Tokyo, the Ikeda Hayato administration insisted on repatriating Zhou to China regardless of diplomatic pressure from Taiwan. When Japanese Minister of Economy Tanzan Ishibashi broke his promise about Japan not entering into industrial relations with the PRC which he had given ambassador Chang the day before at a dinner which Chang had given at the ROC embassy, Chang said, \\"When there is no longer trust between countries, then there is no need for me to remain in Japan.\\" He packed and left the embassy and returned to Taiwan in 1964. Chang Li-sheng's belief in straight living gave him difficult years before he died from lung malfunctioning in April 1971. He refused government funds for special care after retiring from official post. Chang was born into a poor family. By the time of his death, Chang remained a relatively poor man; his dentist friend brought him an electric heater to make his last days somewhat more comfortable. He left his wife and eight children and an impeccable reputation as one of China's outstanding statesmen. References *de Groot, Hsiao-yuen. Who Was L.S.

It is characterised by lyrical content about trucks (i.e. commercial vehicles, not pick-up trucks), truck drivers or truckers, and the trucking industry experience. This would include, for example, references to truck stops, CB (Citizens Band) radio, geography, drugs, teamsters, roads, weather, fuel, law enforcement, loads, traffic, ICC (Interstate Commerce Commission), contraband, DOT (Department of Transportation), accidents, etc.Stern, Jane Trucker, A Portrait of the Last American Cowboy (1975) In truck-driving country, references to ‚Äútruck‚Äù include the following truck types: 10 wheeler, straight truck, 18 wheeler, tractor (bobtail), semi, tractor-trailer, semi tractor trailer, big rig, and some others. It is often confused with road music (e.g. Willie Nelson \\"On the Road Again\\", Roger Miller \\"King of the Road\\"), pick-up truck music (e.g. Toby Keith \\"Big Ol' Truck), and/or truck driving music. The last category would be the preferred choice of most truck drivers for eclectic listening while driving/operating all types, makes, and styles of trucks. Influences It is, at least partly, an oral history of trucking. A range of social and economic factors in the United States have strongly influenced the evolution of truck-driving country as a subgenre of \\"country\\" music. These factors include wars, civil rights struggles, the demographic shift from rural to urban areas, the feminist movement, economic recessions, changes in the railroads, and the oil embargo. Their impacts have diversified the folklore of truck songs.Roach, Joyce Gibson \\"Diesel Smoke & Dangerous Curves: Folklore of the Trucking Industry\\" Hunters and Healers (1977) pp. 45‚Äì53 Technological developments and changes related to both the music business and the trucking industry, however, have brought about the greatest changes to truck-driving country. Variously, these include the jukebox, 33‚Öì rpm vinyl record albums, 8-track tape, cassette tape, the transistor to digital revolution, the Internet, CB radio, all-night radio broadcasts targeting truckers, Interstate highways, and multiple truck components (sleeper cabs, air suspension, power steering, synchronized transmissions, air conditioning, air seats, and electronics).American Truck Historical Society, <www.ATHS.org> Collectively, there are more than 500 truck-driving country songs, all of which more or less originate from the oral tradition of truck folklore. Occupations, of course, have traditionally provided the raw material and inspiration for folk music in the United States (e.g. riverboat, mining, Great Lakes water commerce, logging, cowboy, railroad, agricultural field work and others), influenced by regional culture as well.Danker, Frederick E. \\"Trucking Songs: A comparison with Traditional Occupational Song\\" Journal of Country Music (Jan 1978) pp78-89 Folk songs adopt, adapt, and incorporate colloquialisms, slang, and occupational terms into verbal snapshots. In truck-driving country, such specialized words and terms as truck rodeo, dog house, twin screw, Georgia overdrive, saddle tanks, jake brake, binder and others borrowed from the lingo of truckers are commonly utilized.Roach, Joyce Gibson Hunters & Healers CB vocabulary - which is different from truck driver lingoPorter, Bernard H. \\"Truck Driver Lingo\\" American Speech (Apr 1942) pp102-105 \\\\- is used by both truckers and the general public. Some of that vocabulary has evolved into popular culture and subsequently incorporated into truck-driving country (e.g. ‚Äúhammer down,‚Äù ‚Äúshakey town,‚Äù ‚Äúsmokey,‚Äù and ‚Äúpedal to the metal‚Äù).Seese, Gwyneth E.

Just as truck drivers in the 1970s and 1980s no longer had to rely on AM radio or pre-recorded 8-track tape to listen to the music they wanted to hear by making-up their own playlists on cassette tape, today the portable computer, wireless wi-fi, and the Internet allows singer/songwriters to produce and distribute their own truckmusic (Dale Watson, Sonny George, Bill Kirchen).Johnson, Jon \\"Watson, George, Holiday\\" Country Standard Time (Aug/Sept 2000) pp7-9 See also References Category:Country music genres Country ","title":"Truck-driving country"},{"id":"24749929","text":"Promptuarii Iconum Insigniorum The gens Lollia was a plebeian family at Rome.

History The monastery was founded by Friedrich II von Sommerschenburg ( ‚Äì 1162), Count palatine (Pfalzgraf) of Saxony. It then was a daughter house of Altenberg Abbey of the filiation of Morimond. The initial complement consisted of twelve monks from Altenberg under an abbot (Bodo) from Amelungsborn Abbey. Hereinafter, the Augustinian nunnery of Marienberg in nearby Helmstedt was established in 1176. When the Sommerschenburg family became extinct in 1179, Mariental Abbey with its possessions were seized by the Welf duke Henry the Lion. The abbey soon achieved great prosperity: its estates extended as far as Magdeburg, J√ºterbog and Braunschweig. In 1232 it established a daughter house of its own, Hude Abbey. However, at the end of the 14th century it entered upon a steady decline. The monastery was dissolved in 1569 as a consequence of the Protestant Reformation. A Lutheran school had been set up in the premises in 1542, and this lasted until 1745. A seminary for the training of teachers was also established here, and this continued until 1773, when it was transferred to Helmstedt. The buildings today belong to the Braunschweigische Vereinigte Kloster- und Studienfonds, while the church has become the Protestant parish church of Mariental.

Dubner, released in early October 2009 in Europe and on October 20, 2009 in the United States.SuperFreakonomics Is Out Today, 2009-10-20 It is a sequel to Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything. Synopsis The explanatory note states that the theme of the book explores the concept that we all work for a particular reward. The introduction states we should look at problems economically. The examples given include the preference for sons in India and the hardships Indian women face, as well as the horse manure issue at the turn of the 20th century. The first chapter explores prostitution and pimps in South Chicago, one high class escort, and real estate brokers. The pimps and brokers are compared based on the idea that they are helping to sell one's services to the larger market. Inequalities in pay grades for men and women are also covered in the chapter. The second chapter is about patterns and details. Patterns in the ages of soccer players, health issues of children in the womb during Ramadan, and the upbringings of terrorists are observed. Next, the book discusses the skills of hospital doctors and how Azyxxi was created, and draws parallels to how terrorists in the UK were tracked down by banks. Altruism is discussed in the third chapter, and uses examples of the murder of Kitty Genovese, crime rates as affected by television, and economic experimental games such as prisoner's dilemma, ultimatum, and the work of John A. List. The fourth chapter is about unintended consequences and simple fixes. It goes into detail about Ignaz Semmelweis' work in hospitals, use of seatbelts and child seats, and the possibility of reducing hurricanes. The fifth chapter discusses externalities and global warming. It discusses how economics does not necessarily take environmental issues into account. While interviewing Nathan Myhrvold and Ken Caldeira from Intellectual Ventures, the authors posit an alternative way of solving global warming by stratospheric aerosol injection. The epilogue is about microeconomics, and discusses a study by Laurie Santos and Keith Chen as to whether capuchin monkeys can be trained to use money.  Reception  SuperFreakonomics has been praised for its entertainment value, but has drawn criticism for taking unconventional approaches to its subject matter, particularly global warming. In the Financial Times, Tim Harford, author of The Undercover Economist, said that SuperFreakonomics \\"is a lot like Freakonomics, but better.\\" In the New York Post, critic and novelist Kyle Smith described the book as \\"brave, bracing and beautifully contrarian\\". BusinessWeek gave the book three and a half stars out of five, saying that the book is \\"[a]n inventive and even useful application of economics to unusual subjects\\". Global warming section In the book's fifth chapter, the author proposes that the climate system can be intentionally regulated by construction of a stratoshield. The chapter has been criticized by economists and climate science experts who say it contains numerous misleading statements and discredited arguments. Among the critics are Paul Krugman, Brad DeLong, Raymond Pierrehumbert, The Guardian, Bloomberg News, and The Economist. Elizabeth Kolbert, a science writer for The New Yorker who has written extensively on global warming, contends that \\"just about everything they [Levitt and Dubner] have to say on the topic is, factually speaking, wrong.\\" Joseph Romm said that SuperFreakonomics had seriously misrepresented the position of climate scientist Ken Caldeira; the book says among other things, that Caldeira's research tells him is \\"not the right villain\\", an assertion Caldeira strongly disputes. Caldeira has commented Dubner responded that with hindsight the line describing Ken Caldeira overstated his position, but noted that Caldeira had been sent a preview of the text and had approved it. Caldeira has acknowledged that he did receive the preview, but disagreed that the errors were his responsibility: \\"I feel no need to read, fact check, or make detailed comments on documents that arrive in my in-box. I have lots of other things to do, like trying to get my science out the door.\\" As it transpired, Dubner had been apprised of Caldeira's objection to the \\"right villain\\" assertion, but did not delete the line as Caldeira expected, although Caldeira believes this was due to a good faith misunderstanding. Regarding their own views on global warming, Levitt and Dubner have stated on their Freakonomics blog that global warming is \\"a man-made phenomenon\\" and \\"an important issue to solve\\".

History The cemetery was discovered in the 1920s, but had not been used since the 9th century AD. The cemetery includes many important burials over a period of 600 to 700 years. The start of the interments was in about 200 AD. It is important as a source of archaeology to Nazca culture. The cemetery has been extensively plundered by huaqueros (grave robbers) who have left human bones and pottery scattered around the area. Similar local cemeteries have been damaged to a greater extent. The site has been protected by Peruvian law since 1997 and tourists pay around seven U.S. dollars to take the two-hour tour of this ancient necropolis. The site is by the Poroma riverbed and can be accessed via a dirt road from the Panamerican Highway. In 1997, the majority of the scattered bones and plundered pottery were restored to the tombs. The tombs were built for family groups Preservation of the bodies The bodies are so remarkably preserved due mainly to the dry climate in the Peruvian Desert but the funeral rites were also a contributing factor. The bodies were clothed in embroidered cotton and then painted with a resin and kept in purpose-built tombs made from mud bricks. The resin is thought to have kept out insects and slowed bacteria trying to feed on the bodies. The nearby site of Estaquer√≠a may provide clues to the remarkable preservation of the numerous bodies in these cemeteries. At that site, archeologists found wooden pillars initially thought to have been used for astronomical sightings. However, it is now believed that the posts were used to dry bodies in a mummification process. This may account for the high degree of preservation seen in thousand-year-old bodies which still have hair and the remains of soft tissue, such as skin. In popular culture Chauchilla Cemetery is a prominent setting in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Though not called by name in the film, the cemetery is explicitly identified in the screenplay, promotional materials, and merchandise. This fictionalized version of the cemetery features a number of embellishments, including mask- wearing Nazcan guards and a hidden, underground burial chamber accessible through the barrows. The cemetery is depicted as being built on a promontory overlooking the Nazca Valley, offering the characters a view of the famous Nazca Lines.

Polymake has been cited in over 100 recent articles indexed by Zentralblatt MATH as can be seen from its entry in the swMATH database.  Special Features   modular  Polymake was originally designed as a research tool for studying aspects of polytopes. As such, polymake uses many third party software packages for specialized computations, thereby providing a common interface and bridge between different tools. A user can easily (and unknowingly) switch between using different software packages in the process of computing properties of a polytope.  rule based computation  Polymake internally uses a server- client model where the server holds information about each object (e.g., a polytope) and the clients sends requests to compute properties. The server has the job of determining how to complete each request from information already known about each object using a rule based system. For example, there are many rules on how to compute the facets of a polytope. Facets can be computed from a vertex description of the polytope, and from a (possibly redundant) inequality description. Polymake builds a dependency graph outlining the steps to process each request and selects the best path via a Dijkstra type algorithm.  scripting  Polymake can be used within a perl script. Moreover, users can extend polymake and define new objects, properties, rules for computing properties, and algorithms.  Polymake applications  Polymake divides its collection of functions and objects into 10 different groups called applications. They behave like C++ namespaces. The polytope application was the first one developed and it is the largest.  Common application  This application contains many \\"helper\\" functions used in other applications.  Fan application  The Fan application contains functions for polyhedral complexes (which generalize simplicial complexes), planar drawings of 3-polytopes, polyhedral fans, and subdivisions of points or vectors.  Fulton application  This application deals with normal toric varieties. The name of this application is from the book \\"Introduction to Toric Varieties\\" by William Fulton.  Graph application  The graph application is for manipulating directed and undirected graphs. Some the standard graph functions exist (like for adjacency and cliques) together with combinatorial functions like computing the lattice represented by a directed acyclic graph.  Group application  The group application focuses on finite permutation groups. Basic properties of a group can be calculated like characters and conjugacy classes. Combined with a polytope, this application can compute properties associated with a group acting on a polytope by permuting the polytope's vertices, facets, or coordinates.  Ideal application  The ideal application computes a few properties of polynomial ideals: Gr√∂bner basis, Hilbert polynomial, and radicals.  Matroid application  The matroid class can compute all the standard properties of a matroid like bases and circuits. This application can also compute more advanced properties like the Tutte polynomial of a matroid and realizing the matroid with a polytope.  Polytope application  Within the polytope application, there are over 230 functions or calculations that can be done with a polytope. These functions range in complexity from simply calculating basic information about a polytope (e.g., number of vertices, number of facets, tests for simplicial polytopes, and converting a vertex description to an inequality description) to combinatorial or algebraic properties (e.g., H-vector, Ehrhart polynomial, Hilbert basis, and Schlegel diagrams). There are also many visualization options.  Topaz application  The Topaz application contains all the functions relating to abstract simplicial complexes. Many advance topological calculations over simplicial complexes can be performed like homology groups, orientation, fundamental group. There is also a combinatorial collection of properties that can be computed like a shelling and Hasse diagrams.  Tropical application  The tropical application contains functions for exploring tropical geometry; in particular, tropical hypersurfaces and tropical cones.  Development History  Polymake version 1.0 first appeared in the proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1989 in a new section on mathematical software. Version 1.0 only contained the polytope application, but the system of \\"applications\\" was not yet developed. Version 2.0 was released sometime in 2003, and version 3.0 was released in 2016.  Software packages   Used within polymake  Below is a list of third party software packages that polymake can interface with as of version 3.0. Users are also able to write new rule files for interfacing with any software package. Note that there is some redundancy in this list (e.g., a few different packages can be used for finding the convex hull of a polytope). Because polymake uses rule files and a dependency graph for computing properties, most of these software packages are optional. However, some become necessary for specialized computations. * 4ti2: software package for algebraic, geometric and combinatorial problems on linear spaces * a-tint: tropical intersection theory * azove: enumeration of 0/1 vertices * cdd: double description method for converting between an inequality and vertex description of a polytope * Geomview: interactive 3D viewing program * Gfan: Gr√∂bner fans and tropical varieties * GraphViz: graph visualization software * LattE (Lattice point Enumeration): counting lattice points inside polytopes and integration over polytopes * libnormaliz: affine monoids, vector configurations, lattice polytopes, and rational cones * lrs: implementation of the reverse search algorithm for vertex enumeration and convex hull problems * nauty: automorphism groups of graphs * permlib: set stabilizer and in-orbit computations * PORTA: enumerate lattice points of a polytope * ppl: Parma Polyhedra Library * qhull: Quickhull algorithm for convex hulls * singular: computer algebra system for polynomial computations, with special emphasis on commutative and non-commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and singularity theory * sketch: for making line drawings of two- or three-dimensional solid objects * SplitsTree4: phylogenetic networks * sympol: tool to work with symmetric polyhedra * threejs: JavaScript library for animated 3D computer graphics * tikz: TeX packages for creating graphics programmatically * TOPCOM: triangulations of point configurations and matroids * TropLi: for computing tropical linear spaces of matroids * tosimplex: Dual simplex algorithm implemented by Thomas Opfer * Vinci: volumes of polytopes  Used in conjunction with polymake  * jupyter-polymake: allows polymake within Jupyter notebooks. * PolymakeInterface: package for using polymake in GAP. * PolyViewer: GUI viewer for polymake fies.

He works at Saint Joseph Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California and the French-Vietnam Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. He graduated from medical school at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. He completed his general surgery residency at Harvard University and his plastic surgery residency at the University of Miami. He completed plastic surgery fellowships at Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, University of Miami, and in Paris, France. He formerly served on the faculty at the University of Chicago Medical Center and worked at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.  Tumor Removal and Craniofacial Surgeries  In 1999, McKinnon treated a Michigan woman with a large tumor disorder, neurofibroma, at the University of Chicago. He successfully removed her 200-pound tumor in an 18-hour operation that drew worldwide attention, according to USA Today. Dr. McKinnon was subsequently featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show for successfully removing the world‚Äôs biggest solid tumor. In 2004, McKinnon was invited on a special mission to Romania to treat a similar patient with a giant neurofibroma tumor. With a team of doctors, he performed a 10-hour operation and successfully removed an 80-pound tumor from a 47-year-old woman that suffers from a genetic disorder causing tumors to grow on her body, according to BBC News. Dr. McKinnon and his team waived all fees for their service. From 1985-2014 he led missions to Choluteca, Honduras where he performed cleft lip and palate and other reconstructive surgery. During that time, more than 500 children received treatment at no cost. In 2011, on request of US 501(c) Tree of Life International, Sam-Ottawa of Canada-based Virtual Medical Miracle Network (VM2N) connected Dr McKinnon to Nguyen Duy Hai of Dalat Lam Dong, Vietnam, who suffered from a non-cancerous tumor weighing 198-pound (90 kg), which was growing on the right side of his abdomen. A successful 12-hour operation was performed at French Vietnam Hospital in Saigon on January 5, 2012. McKinnon waived his fee, and other costs were funded through donations. Two other tumor cases were also operated on at Saigon Cho Ray Hospital on January 6 and 7, 2012. Since then, Dr. McKinnon has been back to Vietnam 14 times, to perform many other difficult tumor and craniofacial cases. Over the course of his career, Dr. McKinnon has also provided specialty care and teaching in Belize, Honduras, India, Peru, Vietnam, Thailand, Romania, Mexico, and Portugal. In October 2012, McKinnon was featured in the television program My Giant Face Tumor on the TLC Network. In the program, he successfully removed large facial tumors from two patients, one in Ohio and the other in Thailand, who suffer from neurofibromatosis. In 2017 Dr. McKinnon started a 501(c)(3) certified charitable organization called SurgerySOS. The mission of SurgerySOS is to provide complex tumor and craniofacial surgery to patients without local access to such specialized care. Many of these patients have life-threatening conditions. McKinnon currently conducts surgical and teaching missions at the French Vietnam Hospital, Cho Ray Hospital, Children's Hospital II (Saigon), Hue General Hospital, and Viet Duc University Hospital in Vietnam. During his career, McKinnon has introduced new plastic surgery techniques in nasal reconstruction, craniosynostosis, bilateral cleft lip, vascular malformations, aesthetic craniofacial surgery, orbital tumors and neurofibromatosis. He continues to lecture about aesthetic and reconstructive surgery all over the world.

Its seat is located at Dalaihob Town (). To the west, it shares a border with Subei Mongol Autonomous County of Jiuquan, Gansu. History The area has historically been the hunting grounds of the Huns before it was acquired by Han Dynasty in BC 121. The area was incorporated into the Mongol empire under Genghis Khan in 1226. During the Yuan Dynasty the area was home to nomadic Mongol populations. It was later incorporated into the Qing Dynasty (1644‚Äì1912). Under the Republic of China, the area was under the jurisdiction of Ningxia province. The area fell under the control of the Communist Party in September 1949. Subsequently it was placed successively under government commissions in Jiuquan, Zhangye, and Ningxia province. On June 1, 1956, Ejin became part of the Bayannur League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center was constructed at around the same time. On May 1, 1980, it became part of the Alxa League. Since Chinese economic reforms in the 1980s, Ejin rapidly developed its economy.

H.S. Rakovs‚Ä≤koho); , Bolgradska gimnazia ‚ÄûGeorgi Sava Rakovski‚Äú) is a gymnasium (high school) in Bolhrad, Odessa Oblast, southwestern Ukraine. Founded in 1858 at the request of Bolhrad's Bessarabian Bulgarian population, the Bolhrad Gymnasium is regarded as the oldest high school of the Bulgarian National Revival. Bolgrad Glacier in Sentinel Range, Antarctica is named after the Bulgarian High School of Bolhrad. History The Russo-Turkish Wars of the late 18th and early 19th century prompted many Bulgarians to leave the Ottoman Empire and settle in the southern domains of the Russian Empire and specifically in the Governorate of Bessarabia. These Bessarabian Bulgarians, together with Gagauz people founded 43 villages in Bessarabia, as well as the cities of Bolhrad and Comrat. As early as 1832, Ukrainian Slavist Yuriy Venelin had suggested that Bolhrad become a centre of Bulgarian culture and education in the Russian Empire; however, the idea was not put into practice at the time. the monument to Georgi Rakovski in the garden near the school After the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856), southern Bessarabia (including Bolhrad) came back under the rule of the autonomous Principality of Moldavia. In 1857, Nicolae Vogoride, a Moldavian statesman of Bulgarian origin, became caimacam (temporary replacement of prince) of Moldavia. Bulgarian revolutionary Georgi Sava Rakovski, the school's modern patron, personally lobbied in front of Vogoride for the high school's opening. On 10 June 1858 in Ia≈üi, the caimacam granted trust committee members Nikola Parushev and Panayot Grekov a charter permitting the establishment of the high school. The charter outlined the goals which the school's establishment set, as well as some basic rules. The high school was open to all colonists, so long as they were of Eastern Orthodox confession. Graduating from the Bolhrad High School would require a total of seven years of education, the first three of which were regarded as progymnasium, or junior high school. Latin, Bulgarian, Romanian and Church Slavonic were part of the curriculum. The school's own edifice was completed in 1873. The gymnasium was financially independent from state and church, as it relied on income from rents. The first director of the Bolhrad High School was Sava Radulov of Panagyurishte. Between 1858 and 1879, 685 people enrolled at the gymnasium and 214 graduated; of these 214, 203 were ethnic Bulgarians. Notable students included Aleksandar Malinov, Angel Kanchev, Danail Nikolaev, Dimitar Agura, Dimitar Grekov, Ivan Kolev and Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan. In 1879, after southern Bessarabia reverted once again to the Russian Empire, the school gradually lost its entirely Bulgarian character. A significant part of the students, however, remained Bulgarians, and the Bulgarian language, history and geography have been part of the gymnasium's curriculum for most of its later existence, including today.

The first known mention of a church at Tranent came in 1145 when it was established by the archdeacon, Thor, son of a local landowner. The church was granted by Richard, Archbishop of St Andrews and later confirmed by Saer de Quincy, the local baron. Tranent parish came under the jurisdiction of the canons of Holyrood Abbey and the building was described as being of a higher standard than the normal country church. Although a settlement grew around the church by 1251, it remained in the hands of Holyrood.http://eastlothianmuseums.org/exhibitions/tranent/churches/Ai1988.htm East Lothian, Tranent Parish Church There are also canonical records of a chapel, dedicated to St. Peter, situated on a ridge overlooking a coal-bearing ravine at Travernant. The church was badly damaged in 1544 and 1547, each time by the forces of the Earl of Hertford during the Rough Wooing. Tranent Parish Church joined the Scottish Reformation when Thomas Cranstoun, the first minister took over from the evicted canons and the last Roman Catholic priest, Thomas Moffat; the church of St. Peter was now a reformed Protestant church. The church remained a ruinous condition, after Somerset's attack, into the 17th century and, though it was refurbished, it is not known when. The church was said to have been restored, extended and improved throughout, but in 1799 the decision was made to build a new church which was opened in 1800, a church which still stands high above the ravine overlooking the Firth of Forth. At a total cost of over 10,000 pounds, the church was extensively refurbished and refurnished in 1954. The congregation had to meet in the town hall during the work, but the church they returned to is much the same as it is today.http://www.tranentparishchurch.co.uk/.

As part of the arrangements for the independence and partition of British India the brigade was allocated to India and became the 161st Infantry Brigade in the army of the newly independent India. History The brigade was formed in late November 1941 from the reformed British 161st Infantry Brigade which had been assigned to the 5th Indian Infantry Division earlier in the month. The brigade was then sent to garrison Cyprus in case of a German invasion. In April 1942, it moved to Egypt to take part in the Western Desert Campaign having been re organised as a motor brigade. Attached to the British 10th Armoured Division for the First Battle of El Alamein between June and July 1942, the brigade returned to the 5th Division for action in Burma. In Burma it was attached successively to a number of divisions: British 2nd Infantry Division between April and May 1944, then 7th Indian Infantry Division between May and June 1944, during the Battle of Kohima, following which it returned to the 5th Division. In March 1945 there was a further brief attachment to 7th Division returning once more at the end of that month to the 5th Division until the end of the war. The brigade ended the war at sea as part of the force assembled to invade Malaya. At the end of the war the brigade formed part of the force sent to the Dutch East Indies to restore order for the colonial government facing hostile opposition from the local independence movement. The brigade returned to India in 1946. Post independence succession After India's independence the brigade, under the arrangements of the partition of British India, was allocated to India and became part of the Indian Army, dropping the epithet \\"Indian\\" to be 161st Infantry brigade and moving to Ranchi with the 5th Infantry Division. Elements of 5th Infantry Division, including 161st Infantry Brigade, were called to Punjab to help curb the violence being inflicted on refugees during partition. The brigade was urgently airlifted in an ad hoc manner to Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir to halt the tribal invasion during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947. The brigade successfully prevented the fall of Srinagar, fought the battles of Badgam and Shalateng, reinforced Poonch garrison, distinguished itself in recapture of Uri and the successful ejection of tribals from the Jhelum valley..

History  Sumapaz P√°ramo was considered a sacred place for the Muisca indigenous people. It was associated with the divine forces of creation and the origin of mankind, a domain where humans were not supposed to enter. During the 16th century, German adventurer and conquistador Nikolaus Federmann conducted an expedition crossing the Sumapaz, searching for El Dorado mythic treasure, with heavy casualties. The place was named by the Spaniards \\"Pa√≠s de la Niebla\\" (\\"Country of Fog\\")http://www.sogeocol.com.co/documentos/Paramos.pdf because of the dense clouds at ground level, with great decrease in visibility. In 1783, Jos√© Celestino Mutis led the Botanic Expedition, with the purpose of studying the flora and fauna of the region. However, the p√°ramo was not visited because of its harsh climatic conditions. The German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt made the first description of the p√°ramo and the local plants in 1799. He also described the presence of glacier valleys and associated the geologic features of the region, comparing them with those seen in the geomorphology of the Alps. During the early 20th century, the Spanish naturalist Jos√© Cuatrecasas made important research of the p√°ramo and the tree line. Other scientists that described and studied Sumapaz p√°ramo were Ernesto Guhl, who conducted a long- term 3-decade research of the vegetal communities, and Thomas van der Hammen.  Climate and geography  Sumapaz P√°ramo has an inhospitable, cold climate with temperatures averaging below 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F).(ranging from ‚àí10 ¬∞C to 17 ¬∞C) with quick changes from short periods of warm climate to freezing cold. The average altitude oscillates between 3500 and 4000 m.http://paramo.org/portal/node/460 AMSL. The highest point is the Nevado del Sumapaz peak (4306 m AMSL). The precipitation is about 700‚Äì1000 mm/year. The rainy season lasts almost the entire year, except from December to February, when the sunlight reaches a peak, with intense ultraviolet radiation (adaptations such as white, glassy coloration help the local plants to survive). The humidity is usually high, (from 50 to 90%), and the ground remains soaked, and covered by shallow bodies of water and sticky mud, often covered with dense, flat vegetation difficult to spot by the inexperienced visitor, with danger of falling into them, and risk of drowning or other injuries. These places are called \\"Chupaderos\\" or \\"Chucuas\\" (\\"Drainages\\"). Sumapaz lies between the Orinoco River basin and the Magdalena River basin, the two main fluvial systems of Colombia, and provides tributaries to both. All but one of the tributaries of the Sumapaz River originate in the p√°ramo. Its location on the Thermal equator generates high rates of precipitation, which together with its endemic flora that regulate the soil moisture acting like sponges for the rain waters, contribute to the high amount of surface water and its role as source of water reservoirs.  Geology  The eastern part of Sumapaz consists of Devonian metamorphic rock formations, with fault scarped configuration, and alpine landscapes. Its western part consists of Oligocene sedimentary rocks, with softer landscapes. The different stages of the Quaternary glaciation left plenty of glacier debris, and glacier lakes such as Chisaca lake. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the glacier motion of the ice sheets through the Tunjuelo valley reached as far as Usme (today part of Bogot√°).  Soil  The soil of this region is acidic, with high levels of sodium and potassium. This is a coarse-grained soil, with high permeability favoring the formation of groundwater in aquifers. The composition of the soil and the low temperatures contribute to the low amount of humus and poor decomposing of the organic matter making this soil largely unsuitable for agriculture.  Flora  Over 200 species of vascular plants are native to the area with substantial amount of endemisms. The most representative plants of the area are the Espeletias. Several species have been described here, the most common being Espeletia grandiflora Humb. & Bonpl. The largest one is Espeletia uribei Cuatrec., with specimens up to 12 meters of height, other species are: Espeletia algodonosa Aristeg. Espeletia banksiifolia Sch.Bip. & Ettingsh. ex Wedd. Espeletia cuatrecasasii Ru√≠z-Ter√°n & L√≥pez-Fig. Espeletia formosa S.D√≠az & Rodr.-Cabeza Espeletia glossophylla Mattf. Espeletia killipii Cuatrec. Espeletia picnophyla Cuatrec. Espeletia schultzii (Benth.) W.M.Curtis and Espeletia curialensis Cuatrec. The Sphagnum moss covers wide areas of Sumapaz, which increases the soil's capacity to hold water and nutrients by increasing capillary forces and cation exchange capacity. In the canyons areas, encenillo tree and tibouchina are the dominant species. The European plant Digitalis purpurea is an introduced species, the way of its introduction is not known, either deliberate or accidental.Luteyn, J. L., 1999. P√°ramos: A Checklist of Plant Diversity, Geographical Distribution, and Botanical Literature. The New York Botanical Garden Press, New York, 278 pp.  Fauna  The endangered spectacled bear lives in Sumapaz, its main source of food being the Puya boyacana fruits and the Espeletia plant stems, (known as caulirosule). Other animals described are: Little Red Brocket Deer, tapir, coati, golden eagle, torrent duck, P√°ramo duck (Anas georgica). An introduced species in the waterbodies is the rainbow trout.  Socio-economic issues  Although the soil and climate are adverse for agriculture and other economic activities, human settlements do exist in the Sumapaz P√°ramo, including the villages of San Juan de Sumapaz, Nazareth, Santa Rosa and El Hato (only the first two have road access) with an estimated 1200 families, most of them under the poverty threshold, living on less than $1.25 per day, without schools or sanitation. In consequence, the peasants often invade the protected area to grow potato crops. The natural forest line is severely altered by human activity (logging, intensive grazing), which makes the difference between natural and artificial grasslands difficult to distinguish. An estimated 10,000 heads of cattle live or feed within the protected area. In 1950, president Mariano Ospina P√©rez ordered the Colombian banks not to approve loans destined to establishment of crops or cattle at altitudes higher than as an attempt to discourage such activities. Illegal armed groups such as FARC and ELN guerrillas used the area in recent years as a corridor for the transportation of kidnapping victims, weapon trafficking and drug trafficking. The Colombian government, in accordance with democratic security policies, established a center of military operations in 2002: the General Antonio Arredondo Military base, achieving the withdrawal of the illegal forces. However, the presence of the Colombian army has generated controversy over the environmental impact, with alleged destruction of the frailejones, whose leaves are supposedly collected by the soldiers for making rudimentary mattresses to sleep on.

It is located in the Cameroon volcanic chain, and is the largest volcanic lake in this region. It is one of the oldest radiocarbon- dated lakes in Africa,Past climate variability through Europe and Africa with the youngest lava flow in it being about one million years old. On old colonial maps the area was known as Elefanten Sea (Elephant Lake), but the elephants living in the area were extirpated due to ivory trading.Elephants and Their Interactions with People and Vegetation in the Waza-Logone Region, Cameroon, Part I Introduction and General Background, 1.1 The Problem, pg 3. Biology Until now, 15 species of fishes have been recorded from the lake.Freshwater Ecoregions of the World (2008). Western Equatorial Crater Lakes. Among others, this includes Labeobarbus batesii, a member of the Fundulopanchax mirabilis group, and the endemic catfish Clarias maclareni. Perhaps most noteworthy are the 11 species of cichlids that are endemic to the lake (Konia spp., Stomatepia spp., Myaka myaka, Pungu maclareni, Sarotherodon caroli, S. linnellii, S. lohbergeri, and S. steinbachi).Schliewen, U.K., Tautz, D., and P√§√§bo, S. (1994). Sympatric speciation suggested by monophyly of crater lake cichlids. Nature 368(6472): 629‚Äì632. These cichlids are commonly recognized as a prime example of sympatric speciation, but studies indicate that they were not the result of a single founding event.Martin; Cutler; Friel; Touokong; Coop; and Wainwright (2015). Complex histories of repeated gene flow in Cameroon crater lake cichlids cast doubt on one of the clearest examples of sympatric speciation. Evolution 69-6: 1406‚Äì1422. The lake is strongly stratified with essentially no oxygen deeper than , meaning that fish are restricted to the upper parts closer to the surface. However, one of the cichlid species, Konia dikume, has an unusually high level of hemoglobin in its blood, allowing it to briefly enter low-oxygen water to feed on glassworms (Chaoborus). Other cichlid species in the lake include both generalist and specialist feeders. A highly unusual specialist is Pungu maclareni, which mainly feeds on the endemic sponge Corvospongilla thysi.Steeves, G. (2010). Insight on Barombi Mbo, Cameroon. Cichlid-forum Retrieved 3 June 2018. All the Barombi Mbo cichlids are mouth brooders. In addition to the sponge, the lake is home to an endemic species of Caridina shrimp. All the endemic fish are seriously threatened by pollution and sedimentation from human activities. They are potentially also threatened by large emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the lake's bottom (compare Lake Nyos), although studies indicate that Barombo Mbo lacks excess amounts of this gas.Freeth, S.J.; C.O. Ofoegbu; and K.M. Onuoha (1992). Natural Hazards in West and Central Africa, pp. 50‚Äì51. Commercial fishing is forbidden in the lake. Nevertheless, extensive subsistence fishing has caused declines in the Barombi Mbo cichlids, but it is shifting to more sustainable practices.

The purpose of the solar simulator is to provide a controllable indoor test facility under laboratory conditions, used for the testing of solar cells, sun screen, plastics, and other materials and devices. Classification The IEC 60904-9 Edition2 and ASTM E927-10 standards are a common specification for solar simulators used for photovoltaic testing. The light from a solar simulator is controlled in three dimensions: # spectral content # spatial uniformity # temporal stability Each dimension is classified in one of three classes: A, B, or C. The specifications required for each class are defined in Table 1 below. A solar simulator meeting class A specifications in all three dimensions is referred to as a Class A solar simulator, or sometimes a Class AAA (referring to each of the dimensions in the order listed above). {border=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" |+Table 1: Only for ASTM class specifications |- !width=\\"100\\"Classification !width=\\"125\\"|Spectral Match (each interval) !width=\\"125\\"|Irradiance Spatial Non-Uniformity !width=\\"150\\"|Temporal Instability |-align=\\"center\\" Class A |0.75‚Äì1.25 |2% |2% |-align=\\"center\\" Class B |0.6‚Äì1.4 |5% |5% |-align=\\"center\\" Class C |0.4‚Äì2.0 |10% |10% |} The solar simulation spectrum is further specified via the integrated irradiance across several wavelength intervals. The percentage of total irradiance is shown below in Table 2 for the standard terrestrial spectra of AM1.5G and AM1.5D, and the extraterrestrial spectrum, AM0. {border=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" |+Table 2: ASTM spectral irradiance for three standard spectra |- !width=\\"125\\"Wavelength Interval [nm] !width=\\"100\\"AM1.5D !width=\\"100\\"AM1.5G !width=\\"100\\"AM0 |-align=\\"center\\" 300‚Äì400 |no spec |no spec |8.0% |-align=\\"center\\" 400‚Äì500 |16.9% |18.4% |16.4% |-align=\\"center\\" 500‚Äì600 |19.7% |19.9% |16.3% |-align=\\"center\\" 600‚Äì700 |18.5% |18.4% |13.9% |-align=\\"center\\" 700‚Äì800 |15.2% |14.9% |11.2% |-align=\\"center\\" 800‚Äì900 |12.9% |12.5% |9.0% |-align=\\"center\\" 900‚Äì1100 |16.8% |15.9% |13.1% |-align=\\"center\\" 1100‚Äì1400 |no spec |no spec |12.2% |} These specifications were primarily intended for silicon photovoltaics, and hence the spectral range over which the intervals were defined was limited mainly to the absorption region of silicon. While this definition is also adequate for several other photovoltaic technologies, including thin film solar cells constructed from CdTe or CIGS, it is not sufficient for the emerging sub-field of concentrated photovoltaics using high-efficiency III-V semiconductor multi-junction solar cells due to their wider absorption bandwidth of 300‚Äì1800 nm. Types of solar simulators Flash-type solar simulator for testing full modules Solar simulators can be divided into three broad categories: continuous, flashed, and pulsed. The first type is a familiar form of light source in which illumination is continuous in time. The specifications discussed in the previous section most directly relate to this type of solar simulator. This category is most often used for low intensity testing, from less than 1 sun up to several suns. In this context, 1 sun is typically defined as the nominal full sunlight intensity on a bright clear day on Earth, which measures 1000 W/m2. Continuous light solar simulators may have several different lamp types combined (e.g. an arc source and one or more halogen lamps) to extend the spectrum far into the infrared. Examples of low-intensity and high-intensity continuous solar simulators are available from Solar Light Company, Inc. (inventor of the original solar simulator in 1967,) Atonometrics, Eternal Sun, TS-Space Systems, WACOM, Newport Oriel, Sciencetech, Spectrolab, Photo Emission Tech, Abet Technologies, infinityPV working principle of a 1 Lamp Solar Simulator, typically are used a Xenon short arc lamp The second type of solar simulator is the flashed simulator which is qualitatively similar to flash photography and use flash tubes. With typical durations of several milliseconds, very high intensities of up to several thousand suns are possible. This type of equipment is often used to prevent unnecessary heat build-up in the device under test. However, due to the rapid heating and cooling of the lamp, the intensity and light spectrum are inherently transient, making repeated reliable testing more technically challenging. The temporal stability dimension of the standard does not directly apply to this category of solar simulators, although it can be replaced by an analogous shot-to-shot repeatability specification. The third type of solar simulator is the pulsed simulator, which uses a shutter to quickly block or unblock the light from a continuous source. This category is a compromise between the continuous and flash, having the disadvantage of the high power usage and relatively low intensities of the continuous simulators, but advantage of stable output intensity and spectrum. The short illumination duration also provides the benefit of the low thermal loads of flashed simulators. Pulses are typically on the order of 100 milliseconds up to 800 milliseconds for special Xe Long Pulse Systems. Types of lamps Several types of lamps have been used as the light sources within solar simulators. Spectrum information from a Class AAA 1 Lamp Solar Simulator by using a Xenon Lamp. Xenon arc lamp: this is the most common type of lamp both for continuous and flashed solar simulators. These lamps offer high intensities and an unfiltered spectrum which matches reasonably well to sunlight. However, the Xe spectrum is also characterized by many undesirable sharp atomic transitional peaks, making the spectrum less desirable for some spectrally sensitive applications. Metal Halide arc lamp: Primarily developed for use in film and television lighting where a high temporal stability and daylight colour match are required, metal halide arc lamps are also used in solar simulation. QTH: quartz tungsten halogen lamps offer spectra which very closely match black body radiation, although typically with a lower color temperature than the sun. LED: light- emitting diodes have recently been used in research laboratories to construct solar simulators, and may offer promise in the future for energy-efficient production of spectrally tailored artificial sunlight.

Dallas, 'Enderby, Samuel (1756-1829)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 1, Melbourne University Press, 1966, p. 357. The company was significant in the history of whaling in the United Kingdom, not least for encouraging their captains to combine exploration with their business activities, and sponsored several of the earliest expeditions to the subantarctic, Southern Ocean and Antarctica itself. History of the company: 1773‚Äì1800 Whaler William 1796 owned by Enderby's, with notes on rigging etc Enderby had acquired at least one ship, Almsbury, c. 1768, renamed Rockingham, that he used as a trader. In 1773 Enderby began the Southern Fishery, a whaling firm with ships registered in London and Boston. All of the captains and harpooners were American Loyalists. The vessels transported finished goods to the American colonies, and brought whale oil ‚Ä≤from New England to England. Some of Enderby's ships were reportedly chartered for the tea cargoes that were ultimately dumped into Boston Harbor during the Boston Tea Party incident. An embargo was placed on whale oil exports from New England in 1775, as a result of the American War of Independence. Enderby therefore elected to pursue the whaling trade in the South Atlantic. Rockingham embarked on her first whale fishing voyage on 11 November 1775 when Captain Elihu L. Clark sailed her from Britain for the Brazil Banks. Samuel Enderby founded the Samuel Enderby & Sons company the following year. He and his business associates Alexander Champion and John St Barbe assembled a fleet of twelve whaling vessels on the Greenwich Peninsula, on the RIver Thames just downstream from the City of London.Green A, 150 Years Of Industry & Enterprise At Enderby's WharfJackson, Gordon (1978, page 92. The British Whaling Trade. Archon. . By 1785, Samuel Enderby & Sons controlled seventeen ships engaged in this business. All were commanded by American Loyalists. That year, whales in the South Atlantic had become nearly extinct due to pressure from the whaling industry. The Enderby family therefore shifted its focus to the seas around New Zealand, with the Bay of Islands as its main base of operations. In early 1786, the Enderby family lobbied the government for the right to go into the South Pacific (an area in which the East India Company had historically enjoyed a monopoly).Dan Byrnes, Outlooks for England's South Whale Fishery, 1784-1800, and the Great Botany Debate The lobbying efforts were eventually successful, and on 1 September 1788, the 270 ton whaling vessel Amelia, owned by Samuel Enderby & Sons and commanded by Captain James Shields, departed London. The ship went west around Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean to become the first ship of any nation to conduct whaling operations in the Southern Ocean. A crewman, Archelus Hammond of Nantucket, killed the first sperm whale there off the coast of Chile on 3 March 1789. Amelia returned to London on 12 March 1790 with a cargo of 139 tons of sperm oil.The Quarterly Review, Volume 63, London:John Murray, 1839, page 321. The Amelia voyage marked the beginning of a new era for the company‚Äîone in which many great voyages of oceanographic and geographic exploration were accomplished, but which would ultimately prove to be a drain on company profits. By 1791, the company owned or leased 68 whaling ships operating in the subantarctic region and the Southern Ocean. Whaling vessels owned by Samuel Enderby & Sons were part of the Third Fleet taking convicts to New South Wales in 1791. These vessels included , William and Ann, , , and . Captain Eber Bunker, the enterprising American captain of William and Ann, not wanting to return to England with an empty vessel, became the first to hunt whales in New Zealand waters in December 1791. From this time forward, Enderby's ships Speedy, Britannia, and Ocean made frequent whaling voyages from Port Jackson. Over the next decade the area became more attractive as the East India Company‚Äôs monopoly on fishing in South Pacific waters was progressively lifted, and Governor Phillip Parker King of New South Wales (Phillip Parker King's father Philip Gidley King was governor of NSW) worked to attract the whaling industry. From January 1793 to November 1794, Enderby sent Rattler to survey whaling grounds in the southeastern Pacific, under the command of Lieutenant James Colnett, Royal Navy. Colnett surveyed the Galapagos Islands on this expedition. Samuel Enderby died in 1797, leaving the company to his three sons, Charles, Samuel, and George. History of the company: 1800‚Äì1854 By 1801, Governor Phillip King of New South Wales reported six ships engaging in the whaling industry off the northeast coast of New Zealand, and in 1802 he declared that whaling was established in that area. On 18 August 1806, Captain Abraham Bristow, commander of Ocean, a whaling ship owned by Samuel Enderby & Sons, discovered the Auckland Islands archipelago in the Southern Ocean, south of New Zealand. Finding them uninhabited, he named them \\"Lord Auckland's\\" after his father's friend William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland.F.B. McLaren, The Auckland Islands: Their Eventful History, Wellington:A.H and A.W Reed, 1948 Bristow returned on in 1807 in order to claim the archipelago for England. On 3 August 1819, the whaling vessel Syren, owned by Samuel Enderby & Sons and commanded by Captain Frederick Coffin of Nantucket, Massachusetts, visited the whaling grounds off Japan. The ship returned to London on 21 April 1822 with a cargo of 346 tons of sperm oil.Granville Mawar, Ahab's Trade: The Saga of South Seas Whaling, New York:St. Martin's Press, 1999, page 126. In 1830, after the death of their father, Samuel Enderby Junior (1756‚Äì1829), Samuel Enderby's grandsons, Charles and George Enderby, bought a site on the Thames River which became known as Enderby's Wharf. This site became the new headquarters of the Messrs Enderby company. There they built a ropewalk and a factory, known as Enderby's Hemp Rope Works, for the production of sail canvas and rope from hemp and flax. From 1830-1833, Samuel Enderby & Sons sponsored the Southern Ocean Expedition as part of an effort to locate new sealing grounds in the Southern Ocean. This expedition, involved two company-owned vessels: the whaling brig Tula, and the cutter Lively. The expedition, led by Captain John Biscoe of the Tula, was the third ever to circumnavigate the Antarctic continent. (Captain James Cook being the first, and Fabian von Bellingshausen being the second.) The expedition discovered and charted a large coastal land mass in East Antarctica which Biscoe named Enderby Land. Biscoe also charted many other terrain features, including Cape Ann, Mount Biscoe, Adelaide Island, the Biscoe Islands, and Graham Land. Despite the loss of several men to scurvy and the wreck of the Lively at the Falkland Islands in July 1832, the expedition successfully returned to London in early 1833. The Samuel Enderby - leaving Cowes Roads for London, September 1834 From 1838-1839, Captain John Balleny led another expedition to the Southern Ocean. Commanding the Eliza Scott, another whaling schooner, this expedition led to the discovery of the Balleny Islands. In 1846, Samuel Enderby's grandson Charles Enderby founded the Southern Whale Fishery Company in England. In December 1849, he established the Enderby Settlement in Erebus Cove, Port Ross, at the north-eastern end of Auckland Island, close to Enderby Island.Historical Timeline of the Auckland Islands Paul Dingwall & Kevin Jones, Archaeological reconstruction of a mid-19th century colonial settlement at the Auckland Islands, Wellington:Department of Conservation Te Papa Atawhai This was the beginning of the community named Hardwicke. The Hardwicke settlement was based on agriculture, resupply and minor repair of ships, and whaling. Ultimately unsuccessful, the colony was abandoned in August 1852. Charles Enderby returned to London in 1853. The ill-fated Enderby Settlement finally bankrupted the Enderby family business, which was liquidated in 1854.Charles Enderby Charles Enderby died in poverty in London on 31 August 1876.

World War I William Thomas Ponder joined the French air service in the fall of 1917. He was originally assigned to Escadrille SPA 67, then Escadrille SPA 163. While with this unit, he used a Spad to down three German planes between 28 May and 11 August 1918; one of these victories was shared with Thomas Cassady. While serving with the French, Ponder was a Corporal. When he transferred to an American unit, the 103rd Aero Squadron, he was commissioned as an officer. He scored three more times in the month of October to become a flying ace; four of these victories were shared, including one with Frank O'Driscoll Hunter. In May 1918, while in Paris, Ponder took a French war bride. A year later, on 14 May 1919, he was promoted to Captain before returning to America. Between the World Wars Upon his return to Mangum, he became city manager for a couple of years. Mangum's first municipal airfield was named Ponder Field in his honor. After departing this job, Ponder would work at a variety of jobs over the ensuing years. He delivered aircraft for Lockheed, worked in a news agency, and dealt in petroleum contracts. During the Prohibition era, Ponder was caught smuggling alcohol into the United States from Mexico. On 25 May 1932, he was chased about 200 miles as he flew into the U.S. He landed at San Angelo, Texas; his pursuer promptly landed in front of him, blocking him on the runway. Caught with either 627 or 1,500 bottles of illicit Mexican beer--accounts differ--he was held on $1,500 bond.

It is developed from J-11B as well as from studying of a prototype of Su-33. An unfinished Su-33 prototype, the T-10K-3, was acquired from Ukraine in 2001 and is said to have been studied extensively, reverse engineered, with development on the J-15 beginning immediately afterward. While the J-15 appears to be structurally based on the prototype of Su-33, the indigenous fighter features Chinese technologies as well as avionics from the J-11B program. In February 2018, discussions about replacing the aircraft appeared in several Chinese media outlets including Xinhua and China's main military newspaper, discussing that it belongs to the 4th or 4.5 generation fighters. Thus, the J-15 is viewed as an interim carrier-based fighter until a 5th generation successor enters service, one that may be based on the J-20 or J-31.  Development  China has sought to purchase Su-33s from Russia on several occasions‚Äîan unsuccessful offer was made as late as March 2009‚Äîbut negotiations collapsed in 2006 after it was discovered that China had developed a modified version of the Sukhoi Su-27SK designated the Shenyang J-11B,Chinese version of Russian jet endangers bilateral relations in violation of intellectual property agreements. However, according to Chinese sources, the reason China withdrew from talks is that Russia wanted large amounts to re-open Su-33 production lines, insisting on a Chinese purchase of at least 50 Su-33s, towards which China was reluctant as it believed the aircraft would become outdated in a few years. China hence decided on an indigenous variant instead of continuing to assemble the licensed Su-27, or J-11. http://3g.163.com/dy/article/D5MP38EJ0515J2UF.htmlhttps://k.sina.cn/article_6424351127_17eebd197001009y5t.html?from=ent J-15 program was officially started in 2006. The deputy general designer of J-15 is Wang Yongqing (ÁéãÊ∞∏Â∫Ü). The first J-15 prototype made its maiden flight on 31 August 2009, believed to be powered by Russian-supplied AL-31 turbofan engines. Video and still images of the flight were released in July 2010, showing the same basic airframe design as the Su-33. On 6 May 2010 the aircraft conducted its first takeoff from a simulated ski-jump. On 25 November 2012, the aircraft successfully performed its first takeoff and landing on China's first aircraft carrier Liaoning. A twin-seat variant made its maiden flight on 4 November 2012. The initial WS-10 engines proved to be unreliable under oceanic conditions, and the early J-15s were fitted with Russian-made AL-31F. Several years later, WS-10 entered mass-production and late J-15 variants were gradually replacing their engines with modified WS-10.  Design  An article in the China Signpost believes the J-15 \\"likely exceeds or matches the aerodynamic capabilities of virtually all fighter aircraft currently operated by regional militaries, with the exception of the U.S. F-22 Raptor\\", alleging that the J-15 likely possesses a 10% superior thrust-to- weight ratio and a 25% lower wing loading than the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. However, one of the authors of that same article described the J-15 in another as no game changer; the reliance on ski-jump launches and lack of Chinese carrier based refueling capabilities are believed to greatly reduce its effective range. Hu Siyuan of the National Defense University PLA China has said that \\"the current weak point of the J-15 is its Russia-made Al-31 engines which are less powerful than that of the American F-35 fighter\\".Jian, Yang. \\"J-15 jets on deck as carrier sets off on longest sea trials.\\" Shanghai Daily, 12 July 2012. In September 2013, the Beijing-based Sina Military Network (SMN) criticized the capabilities of the J-15 as nothing more than a \\"flopping fish\\" incapable of flying from the Liaoning with heavy weapons, ‚Äúeffectively crippling its attack range and firepower,‚Äù an unusual move as it contradicted state-owned media reports praising the fighter. SMN reported the J-15 could operate from the carrier equipped with two YJ-83K anti-ship missiles, two short-range PL-8 air-to-air missiles, and four bombs, but a weapons load exceeding 12 tons would not get it off the ski jump, prohibiting it from carrying heavier munitions such as PL-12 medium-range air-to-air missiles, making it an unlikely match if hostile fighters are encountered when flying strike missions; furthermore, it can only carry two tons of weapons while fully fueled, limiting it to no more than two YJ-83Ks and two PL-8s.Chinese Media Takes Aim at J-15 Fighter - Defensenews.com, 28 September 2013 The J-15's chief designer, Sun Cong of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, has said that the J-15 could match the F/A-18 in bomb load, combat radius and mobility. However, in a similar statement, he said more work was required in its electronics and combat systems. He also indicated the lack of mature domestically produced engines as a current weak spot. Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo stated that the aircraft's air combat capabilities were better than that of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. However, he also stated that its ability to attack land and sea targets was slightly inferior to the F/A-18E/F; it is also stated that its electronic equipment meets the standards of those on a fifth generation fighter. Operational history On 25 November 2012, Chinese media announced that two J-15s had made successful arrested landings on the aircraft carrier . The first pilot to land on Liaoning was named as Dai Mingmeng (Êà¥ÊòéÁõü). Luo Yang, the aircraft's head of production and designer, died the same day. PLA Daily newspaper indicated the first five naval pilots including Dai conducted J-15 fighter landing and taking off. Test and training program officials confirmed the carrier-borne aircraft and special equipment for the landing flight had gone through strict tests, and fighter jets can be deployed on the carrier. In December 2013 Chinese media reported that mass production of J-15s in full operational condition with combat markings had begun. In January 2017, the carrier Liaoning, having returned to the South China Sea after its first deployment into the western Pacific, conducted a series of take-off and landing drills with its force of embarked J-15 fighters. In July 2018, Lieutenant General Zhang Honghe of the PLAAF stated that China is developing a new carrier-based aircraft that will replace the J-15 due to four crashes and numerous technical problems. One problem with the aircraft is that it is the heaviest carrier-borne fighter in current operation with an empty weight of 17,500 kg compared to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet's 14,600 kg (though it is less than the F-14 Tomcat's weight of 19,800 kg). Weight problems are compounded when operating off Liaoning, as its STOBAR launch and recovery method further limits payload capacity.Beijing keen to develop J-15 successor - report .

He then made the Royal Air Force his career, finally retiring in 1946 after serving in Bomber Command's B5 Group. World War I Pope was born in Dublin, the third son of William Pope, of Waterford, Ireland. He joined the Inns of Court Officers' Training Corps as a cadet, having been promoted to lance corporal by the time he was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 3 June 1916 to serve in the Royal Flying Corps. He was appointed a flying officer on the General List on 29 August, and served as an instructor at RAF Ternhill until assigned to No. 60 Squadron in April 1917, where he originally flew a Nieuport 17 fighter. Pope scored twice with a Nieuport, on 8 and 20 June. He then upgraded to a SE.5 and destroyed an Albatros D.III on 16 September. Switching to a slightly improved SE.5a, he destroyed two reconnaissance aircraft on 8 November, and another D.III on the 11th. A week later, he was wounded and forced to land near Saint Julien. Pope then served as a flying instructor, commanding the Fighter Flight at the Central Flying School at Upavon. and was promoted to lieutenant on 3 December 1917. He was promoted to the temporary rank of captain on 10 August 1918, to serve as a flight commander in No. 208 Squadron until the Armistice. Inter- war service Pope was again appointed a temporary captain on 1 May 1919, to serve as a flight commander at the headquarters of the Army of Occupation in Germany, relinquishing the rank on 4 August. On 24 October 1919 he was granted a short service commission with the rank of flying officer, serving as an instructor at the RAF (Cadet) College, and then in No. 8 Squadron from 21 April 1922. Soon afterwards, on 2 May, his commission was made permanent. Pope was promoted to flight lieutenant on 30 June 1923, and was posted to No. 55 Squadron, based in Iraq, on 24 September. On 27 December 1924 he was posted to the staff of RAF Middle East in Egypt. On 28 May 1926 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, \\"in recognition of gallant and distinguished service in connection with the operations in Iraq during the period September to November 1924\\". He returned to the Home Establishment on 27 September, posted to the Depot at RAF Uxbridge. On 1 February 1927 he was assigned to No. 22 Squadron, attached to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Martlesham Heath, and on the 15th received his DFC from the King at Buckingham Palace. As well as his duties as a test pilot, Pope found the time to take part in several sporting events. On 15 April he attended the Bournemouth Easter Meeting, taking part in the Branksome \\"Cirrus\\" Handicap Stakes flying de Havilland DH.60 Moth (G-EBPG), and in June attended the Bournemouth Whitsun Meeting, taking part in the Medium-Power Handicap Stakes. On 1 March 1929 Pope was test flying the second prototype of the Parnall Pipit single-seat fighter over the Parnall airfield at Yate, Gloucestershire. During the flight test the tail and rudder broke off. Pope parachuted out the aircraft at a height of , making a successful landing despite standing over tall and weighing about 15 stone (), and thus becoming a member of the Caterpillar Club. The same day he was awarded the Air Force Cross, receiving his medal from the Prince of Wales at St. James's Palace on 28 March. On 13 July 1929 he was appointed to the Directorate of Scientific Research at the Air Ministry. A year later, in July 1930, Pope flew the Avro 618 Five (G-AASO) owned by Sir Philip Sassoon, in the King's Cup Air Race, but did not complete the course, being forced to retire at Manchester. On 17 November 1931 he took part in a Squash competition representing the RAF against the Royal Aero Club. Pope was promoted to squadron leader on 1 February 1932, and on 7 March was appointed Officer Commanding, No. 54 (Fighter) Squadron, based at RAF Hornchurch. In early July he led his squadron in a demonstration attack on an \\"enemy\\" airfield during the thirteenth annual RAF Display at Hendon Aerodrome, with his squadron's Bristol Bulldog's also taking part in the annual RAF Air Exercise, as part on the \\"Northland\\" Air Forces, later in the same month.

He remained in the Royal Air Force post-war, serving until 1927, then returned to military service during the Second World War. Early life Powell was born in Patricroft, Manchester, in 1895, but by 1901 was living in Great Crosby, Lancashire. His 1915 Aviators' Certificate lists his address as The Vicarage, South Shore, Blackpool. First World War Powell began his military service in August 1913, when he joined the Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry, a unit of the Territorial Force. On 21 September 1914, soon after the outbreak of the war, he transferred to the 18th (Service) Battalion (3rd City) of the Manchester Regiment, part of the New Army, as a second lieutenant. He then promptly volunteered for service in the Royal Flying Corps, and was transferred in November. Powell trained as a pilot at Farnborough, and was promoted to lieutenant on 2 February 1915. He was granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 1130 on 2 March, after soloing a Maurice Farman biplane, and then completed his training at Netheravon. Powell was appointed a flying officer on 25 May, and transferred to the General List. Powell was posted to No. 5 Squadron, based at Abele, Belgium, serving in \\"B\\" Flight. He staked his first two claims for aerial victories on 19 September 1915 while flying a Vickers Gunbus, one claim being confirmed. He had a string of four unconfirmed claims during October and November, and on 15 December he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain. He gained his second confirmed victory on 19 December. He had one more unconfirmed claim while flying the Gunbus, on 2 January 1916, and was awarded the Military Cross, on 14 January. As the commander of \\"B\\" Flight, he then flew the first FE.8 to go into action in France, No. 7457. He was rather proprietorial about it, supposedly refusing leave to monopolize flying it on a daily basis. He scored his first win with the new aircraft on 17 January 1916; by 12 March, he had three unconfirmed wins, and three more triumphs credited to him, including one with Gilbert W. M. Green serving as his gunner/observer. Powell returned to England in April 1916, and was based at Cambridge, but in May returned to France when posted to No. 40 Squadron as a flight commander. The squadron was the first unit to be equipped with the FE.8. In February 1917 Powell was appointed chief fighting instructor in the RFC's Northern Group, based at York, and from April he commanded No. 43 Training Squadron at Ternhill, being appointed squadron commander with the temporary rank of major on 16 May 1917. Powell returned to France on 2 August 1917 when appointed commander of No. 41 Squadron. On 2 February 1918, during an offensive patrol over the Douai sector, Powell was wounded and his engine disabled during a dogfight with Max K√ºhn of Jasta 10. He made a forced landing on a German airfield, and was captured, spending the remainder of the war as a POW. He was repatriated after the Armistice, and eventually left the RAF on 17 May 1919. Inter-war service On 12 December 1919 Powell was granted a short service commission in the RAF, with the rank of flight lieutenant, but this was cancelled a week later. However, he was granted a short service commission as a flight lieutenant again, on 5 June 1920. After serving at the Boys' Wing at RAF Cranwell, he was posted to No. 28 Squadron in India on 17 September 1921. He returned to the RAF Depot as a supernumerary officer on 31 November 1922, and served under the Superintendent of Reserve at RAF Northolt from 9 July 1925. On 5 June 1927 Powell was transferred to the RAF Reserve as a \\"Class A\\" officer, finally relinquishing his commission after completing his period of service on 5 June 1931. Second World War On 19 September 1939, soon after the outbreak of the Second World War, Powell was granted a commission \\"for the duration of hostilities\\" as a pilot officer on probation in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. He was promoted to the war substantive rank of flying officer on 6 February 1940, and from flight lieutenant to temporary squadron leader on 1 June 1942, which was made war substantive on 2 December 1942. Shortly afterwards he was promoted to acting wing commander, and subsequently received three mentions in despatches, on 1 January 1943, 8 June 1944, and 1 January 1945. Finally, on 14 June 1945, in the King's Birthday Honours Powell was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. In his later years, Powell lived in Dorset. He died in Cambridge in May 1992.

The book is a semi-autobiographical account detailing 50 Cent's rise as both a young urban hustler and as an up-and-coming musician with lessons and anecdotes from historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Sun Tzu, Socrates, Napoleon, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin. Origins The 50th Law grew out of the friendship and mutual admiration between 50 Cent and Robert Greene. Greene's book The 48 Laws of Power, which has long been a staple in the hip hop world, came to the attention of 50 Cent, who asked his manager to arrange a meeting. Greene said that he was surprised by 50 Cent's persona and was impressed by his \\"Zen-like calmness\\" and eye for strategy.The 50th Law. Power Seduction and War. June 11, 2009. The two began to work on a book project that would combine their two worlds. According to Greene, 50 Cent is an example of what Machiavelli called a New Prince, a leader who emerges in a time of chaos or turmoil and rewrites the rules. According to 50 Cent, Greene's books describe the laws and strategies used by hustlers on the street, even if they might not know the \\"technical terms\\" for what they were doing.50 Cent Presents \\"The 50th Law\\" - Book with Robert Greene.

He was admitted scholar of his college, 4 July 1549, and fellow 25 March 1553; being, however, ejected in the following year, he did not commence M.A. until 1558. In 1561 he was elected a minor fellow of Trinity College; in 1562 he was elected a senior fellow, and successively filled the offices of senior bursar (1562-3) and vice-master (1564-8) on the same foundation. On 14 November 1561 he was appointed one of the university preachers. He proceeded B.D. in 1568, and was admitted Master of St John's 17 December 1569. He was admitted archdeacon of Northampton in 1571; but his tenure of the mastership was cut short, for reasons that remain partly obscure, and he left the position in 1574. Subsequent proceedings and articles preferred against him appear to point to non-residence as the only charge that was actually substantiated; there was a later college tradition that he had tried to enrich himself by college business; and there may also have been religious tensions, since according to John Strype he was brought into the mastership by the party which supported John Whitgift, and Thomas Baker points to the discontinuation of the Genevan psalters during his tenure. But Strype adduces evidence suggesting at a later time his views were more Calvinist or puritan.

Early life Nomi Fernandes (1985), born and raised in Zurich, Switzerland, is nothing less than a Swiss success story. With Venezuelan and Portuguese genes from her mother and Swiss-South African genes from her father, it is no wonder that this exotic beauty possesses an excitement for life and hard working ethics. Career Trained as a professional classical dancer in Europe, Nomi's modeling career began in 2006 when she landed her very first photo-shoot for the cover of a popular American fitness magazine. By 2007 she had already become the first Swiss centerfold for Playboy magazine. In 2008, Playboy called again and asked Nomi to be their Playmate of the Month, Nomi agreed and made not only centerfold in April but also a celebrated cover girl throughout Europe. In July 2009, she was invited to appear on her second Playboy cover, this time for the Romania edition. In 2010 Nomi was the March Girl in the Playboy Calendar. In 2011 Nomi appeared for the fourth time on the Playboy Cover for the Hungarian edition. In March 2015, Nomi appeared in Playboy-Europe again. In total, since 2008, Nomi has appeared on the cover of Playboy magazine four times or in a Playboy editorial, a record five times, as a Swiss model! In 2010, with her modeling career booming, Nomi started her own agency for glamour models, Babes Management. Babes Management represents and offers professional glamour models for editorials, advertising, Internet, conventions, commercials, TV and films and VIP events. After years of unprecedented success in the European market, Babes Management was ready to expand worldwide with www.babesanddolls.com, a fashion label for women. In 2013 A-list director Michael Bay needed Russian-Israeli model Bar Paly to convincingly portray a stripper girl in \\"Pain & Gain\\", a thriller movie (based on the real life activities of a trio of bodybuilders involved in extortion and kidnapping that made headlines in the nineties) starring Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson, Mark Wahlberg, and Anthony Mackie. Having been impressed by Nomi‚Äôs trained dancing background when the two had met at a prior casting, Michael immediately contacted Nomi to instruct Bar Paly the art of striptease and pole-dancing. Nomi confirmed that the task was a challenge: \\"Bar had no dance background, so it was hard work to prepare her for the role. But the work has turned us into good friends. Bar is a wonderful, down to earth girl\\". Bar has returned the compliment:\\" Nomi is a great dancer; I will never be able to move like her. We have become inevitably closer, because she saw me in rather awkward poses. ‚ÄùThe two trained together for three weeks, 6 hours a day.

Born is an American novelist who used a career in law enforcement to add realistic details and dialogue to his crime thrillers. His first novel, Walking Money, released in 2004, received rave reviews and was shortlisted for the Barry Award (for crime novels). His third novel, Escape Clause, won the gold medal in the inaugural Florida Book Award. He currently co-writes many of his novels with best-selling author James Patterson. Early life and education Born was raised in West Palm Beach, Florida, and attended Florida State University. Born went to graduate school at the University of Southern Mississippi. After graduation, Born became interested in law enforcement. Law enforcement career He started his career with the US Marshals Service and transferred within the US Department of Justice to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He worked as a Special Agent for the DEA in South Florida until 1990. Born then accepted a job with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) as a Special Agent. This job gave him access to a much wider variety of investigations. In addition to working on interesting investigations involving organized crime, serial killers, public corruption, and narcotics, Born joined the FDLE Special Operations team. While working for the DEA, Born was assigned to the Miami Field Division and worked out of the West Palm Beach field office. He worked cases all across the state, as well as in Central America. Born worked undercover, helping in the investigation of several large smuggled loads of cocaine. Born also worked for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in South Florida. His time with the FDLE included an undercover assignment at a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan, buying unlawful weapons undercover, working on several serial killer investigations, and work on the Special Operations team. Born is a recipient of the US Attorney's Officer of the Year award, the Florida Distinguished Service award, the Medal of Valor, and a number of other commendations. In 2011, Born was awarded the Lifesaving Medal directly from the Governor of Florida after he jumped into a canal at night to rescue a little girl who had been thrown from a wrecked vehicle. Transition to writing In late 1980s, Born met crime writer Elmore Leonard through a mutual friend. Leonard asked if Born could provide him with some technical advice, and their friendship lasted until Leonard's death in 2013. Born acted as a technical advisor to the short-lived ABC series Karen Sisco, starring Carla Gugino. It was with Elmore Leonard's encouragement that Born first started plotting out a novel. After reading so many police novels that had no relation to reality, Born thought it was important to write a book about which even a cop would think, \\"I could see that happening.\\" Born wrote two novels that were never published. It was his third novel, Walking Money, that attracted the attention of literary agents and quickly led to a multi-book deal with Putnam books (G. P. Putnam's Sons). Writing career After the publication of his first novel, Born has made every effort to stay on schedule to publish one novel a year. He followed Walking Money with two sequels called Shock Wave and Escape Clause. Published in 2006, Escape Clause won the inaugural Florida Book Award for Best Novel, which he received directly from the Governor of Florida. His next two novels, Field of Fire and Burn Zone, feature an ambitious ATF agent who still lives with his parents. Born wrote two science fiction novels next. They were published by Macmillan, under the pseudonym James O'Neal. The name change was designed to avoid confusion among his crime fiction fans. The Human Disguise and the Double Human were released to positive reviews. Publishers Weekly called the Human Disguise \\"wildly entertaining.\\" The novels, set in the near future, follow a flawed detective through a ravaged landscape of Florida, investigating what appears to be a gang war. Born went to great lengths to make sure everything he talked about had some basis in scientific fact. Both of the novels were optioned by CBS Studios. An editor from his publisher contacted Born about co-writing with television commentator Lou Dobbs. Their collaboration resulted in two novels. The first was Border War, which is about a drug cartel in Juarez, Mexico, and the federal task force trying to battle them in El Paso, Texas. The second book, Putin's Gambit, is a story about Russia hacking the US and Great Britain's financial computers to spark a financial meltdown. The Russians' motivation is to distract the West as Russia moves into Estonia. In 2015, Born was contacted by best-selling author James Patterson about collaborating on projects. Born wrote several novellas or \\"book shots\\" with Patterson before taking over the Michael Bennett series with the novel Haunted. Born continues to work with Patterson on Bennett novels as well as other projects. He also provides technical advice and is a commentator on different crime shows. Most notably, Born appeared on the Discovery Channel's A Crime to Remember, regarding a famous murder from the 1950s of a judge in Palm Beach County. In 2018, Born traveled to Afghanistan to do research on a novel and work on a documentary. He spent time at Bagram Air Base and the Fenty Forward Operating Base near the Pakistani border. The documentary, Send Me, detailed the US military's effort to provide medical evacuation to allied soldiers wounded in combat. The documentary aired on PBS in October 2018. Personal life Born lives with his wife in South Florida where he now writes full-time. He continues to provide technical advice, and speaks publicly about his books and other issues.

Shanghai's efforts were in vain as the hotel eventually failed and the county seat remained in Wharton.

The game is for 2 to 4 players of ages 8 and above, and takes about 20 to 30 minutes. Ubongo is an abstract puzzle game, based on a pentamino variant, reminiscent of a combination of Tangram and Tetris. The game includes a simplified version with fewer pieces, for children and beginners. Ubongo is well suited for a game for the whole family, because its mechanics entertain both children and adults. Solving puzzles is entertaining by itself and provides excitement when combined with competition with other players. The word \\"ubongo\\" means \\"brain\\" in Swahili, a language currently spoken in Eastern and Central Africa. Theme The cardboard player boards and the main board with the jewels are coloured in strong earthy colours, on a black and red background, with the simple, clear motives themed after African or Australian Aborigine culture, featuring animals found in the jungle and on the savanna. Jewels made of translucent, colourful plastic are used as prizes. File:Ubongo-board.svg|An example of a player board File:Ubongo-tiles.jpg|Playing pieces File:Ubongo- diamonds.jpg|Jewels Rules The game includes 36 cardboard pieces, of which four have to be used to completely cover the shape on the player board. On the other side of the player board is a simpler version, which has only to be covered with three pieces. Each player receives a player board, and a throw of a die decides which four pieces have to be used to cover the shape. The player must then use the pieces to completely cover up the shape without overlapping the pieces. An hourglass is used to limit the time to cover the shape. Each player to manage to cover up the shape in time receives the right to take jewels from the main board. Where the player can take jewels from depends on his/her rank among the players to complete their shape. Then the player cards are redistributed for the next turn. At the end of the game, the player who has the most jewels of a specific single colour wins the game.

He was Manfred von Richthofen's penultimate victim. Family background and education Richard Raymond-Barker was the third son, one of nine children, born to Edward Raymond-Barker and his wife Rose Mary (n√©e Crawford) of Bisley, Gloucestershire. He was born in Forest Gate, London, lived in Bisley, Gloucestershire, and was educated at Wimbledon College. Early service Raymond-Barker was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 30 November 1914, serving in the 12th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers. In mid-1915 he learned to fly at the Hall Flying School at Hendon Aerodrome, and was granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 1460 on 18 July. Raymond-Barker transferred to the Royal Flying Corps on 6 August 1915, completing his pilot training, and being appointed a flying officer on 19 October. He was posted to France on 22 November. On 1 April 1916, he was appointed a lieutenant in the RFC, and on 17 June was appointed a flight commander, with the temporary rank of captain. During this time, he served with No. 6 Squadron RFC and No. 16 Squadron RFC, transferring on 29 December 1916. Victories On 12 May 1917, Raymond-Barker was posted to No. 48 Squadron RFC as a flight commander, flying the Bristol F.2b two-seater heavy fighter. He gained his first victories on 20 May, driving down a pair of Albatros D.IIIs out of control over Brebi√®res. On 26 May he destroyed another D.III, and on 5 June drove down an enemy reconnaissance aircraft near Bullecourt. On 1 July 1917, he was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant. He scored his final two triumphs soon after, on the 8th (with Sergeant Jack Mason as his observer) and 17th, bringing his total to two Albatros D.IIIs destroyed and four enemy aircraft driven down out of control. He was subsequently awarded the Military Cross, which was gazetted on 14 September 1917. Command and death On 17 September 1917, Raymond-Barker was appointed a squadron commander, with the temporary rank of major. He took command of No. 3 Squadron, flying Sopwith Camels. On 20 April 1918, it ran into a patrol of Fokker Triplanes of the Flying Circus, and Raymond-Barker was shot down and killed by Manfred von Richthofen. As Richthofen reported it: \\"With six planes of Jasta 11, I attacked a large enemy squadron. During the fight I observed that a Triplane was attacked and shot at from below by a Camel. I put myself behind the adversary and brought him down, burning, with only a few shots. The enemy plane crashed down near the forest of Hamel where it burned further on the ground.\\" Three minutes later Richthofen shot down the aircraft of 2nd Lieutenant David Lewis, who survived. These were Richthofen's 79th and 80th aerial victories. The following day he was shot down and killed. Raymond-Barker's body was never recovered, and so he is commemorated at the Arras Flying Services Memorial. Honours and awards ;Military Cross :2nd Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) Richard Raymond-Barker, General List and RFC. ::For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty when leading a fighting patrol. He attacked a large hostile formation, destroying two of them. He has also done excellent work in leading distant photographic reconnaissances, notably upon two occasions when his skilful leadership enabled photographs to be taken of all the required hostile area in spite of repeated attacks from enemy aircraft. He has helped to destroy seven hostile machines, and has at all times displayed conspicuous skill and gallantry.

It is the second collaboration between Jonze and West, since they co-directed the music video for West's single \\"Flashing Lights\\" in 2008. Synopsis Kanye West plays himself drunk at a nightclub embarrassing himself and his friends while being belligerent. West becomes excited when \\"See You in My Nightmares\\" starts playing in the club and he begins to wander around the club reminding everyone that it is his song, even though everyone already knows that. He also tries to flirt with many of the women there, who are at first starstruck, but then quickly repulsed by his drunken behavior and lewd advances. West embarrasses himself further when he tries to hit on a woman who is there with her boyfriend. He later runs into Fonzworth Bentley, who he has a brief conversation with until another drunk man comes up to West and mistakes him for Lil Wayne. After Bentley corrects the man, the man continues interrupting the conversation while attempting to talk to West until Bentley grabs the man and a fight breaks out. West simply walks away. On the dance floor, West tries to dance but ends up leaning on a stranger, barely conscious. He then wanders into an empty side room where he begins to feel depressed, but a beautiful woman in a leopard print dress appears. She comforts him and tells him \\"It's OK\\" while he cries on her shoulder. They begin to have sex on a sofa but he passes out on top of her. When West wakes up a short time later, he finds himself with his pants down, lying on a sofa covered with leopard print pillows ‚Äî he was hallucinating. Startled and nauseated, he rushes to the bathroom and vomits what appear to be rose petals. West finds a bowie knife in the bathroom and cuts into his stomach, spilling a torrent of petals from his stomach. He pushes the knife in deeper and, with his hands, digs out of himself a small rodent-like creature, named in the credits as \\"Henry\\". When Kanye realizes it is connected to him by an umbilical cord, he cuts the cord with the knife. He then places the creature on a sink counter in front of him and hands it a miniature version of the bowie knife. The creature grabs the tiny knife and eyes it apprehensively before shaking its head at West, who slowly nods his head in response. West watches as the creature commits suicide, falls over, and slowly dies while gasping for air. The film cuts to black with West still looking at its corpse lying on the counter. Production The plot is based on an idea developed by Jonze, who then approached West whom Jonze thought would be great for the role. Jonze and West spoke about working together on a music video for West's song \\"See You in My Nightmares\\" from his fourth studio album 808s & Heartbreak. They later agreed that the new video should be expanded into an experimental film. Jonze said the film was meant to illustrate the themes of loss and isolation on 808s & Heartbreak. The short film was shot near the end of January 2009 within two days in the Foxtail nightclub in West Hollywood, California. Fonzworth Bentley, Mike Carroll, and members of the GIRL skateboard team make cameos as West's friends and other guests at the nightclub. The soundtrack to the short prominently features West's \\"See You in My Nightmares\\", \\"When I Said Goodbye\\" by Mayer Hawthorne, and Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, which plays over the final moments of the film. Release The film premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 24, 2009, was intended for public release through the iTunes Store on September 8, 2009, but did not premiere online until October 18, 2009 through West's blog. On October 18, We Were Once a Fairytale was leaked to the Internet and posted on West's official website, kanyeuniversecity.com. Jonze said the film was accidentally leaked from the post-production studio of a friend, and that West did not realize that it was not meant to be circulated yet. \\"I think he was like: 'Oh, it's out. I'll link to it,'\\" Jonze said. On October 19, the video was removed from the West's blog, with only a message left from West saying \\"SORRY I HAD TO TAKE IT DOWN : (\\". The video, however, can still be found on various video sharing websites and is now available through iTunes.

This fungus only grows on limestone in northern Sicily in association with Cachrys ferulacea (family Apiaceae). The characteristics of the mushroom are its creamy white to yellow colour, its diameter of between , its extremely angled gills, and the breaking apart of the cap surface at maturity.  Taxonomy  The first record of the mushroom was in 1866 by Italian botanist Giuseppe Inzenga, who named it Agaricus nembrodensis; it was described as \\"the most delicious mushroom of the Sicilian mycological flora\\". This was widely agreed upon, which has led to widespread cultivation, by professionals and amateurs. In 1886, French mycologist Lucien Qu√©let transferred the species to the genus Pleurotus. Recent research has shown that P. nebrodensis is closely related to, but unique from, Pleurotus eryngii, which also occurs in the Mediterranean Basin and is associated with plants in the family Apiaceae.  Decline  P. nebrodensis was classified as critically endangered is because it is found in an area of less than , and the population has become fractured. In addition, there are not as many mature fungi, and it is losing its natural habitat. An additional reason for the decline is that collectors are now picking unripe specimens. It is currently estimated that fewer than 250 Pleurotus nebrodensis reach maturity every year.  Conservation  Currently there are no laws to protect Pleurotus nebrodensis. Even in protected areas there has not been a ban on picking of unripe specimens. However, a draft of rules has been created, and could be approved. This draft proposes protecting all ages of the Pleurotus nebrodensis in one part of Madonie Park, a sanctuary, while in another section of the park it will protect any non-mature mushroom. In addition to this, this fungus is being grown, like a crop, to reduce the strain on the wild population. These fungi that are cultivated for conservation are produced in tunnels that are covered by black nets. These cultivated fungi have the same flavor and aroma as the wild specimens.

The two types of oropharyngeal cancers are HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, which is caused by an oral human papillomavirus infection; and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer, which is linked to use of alcohol, tobacco, or both. OPC is diagnosed by biopsy of observed abnormal tissue in the throat. OPC is staged according to the appearance of the abnormal cells on the biopsy coupled with the dimensions and the extent of the abnormal cells found. Treatment is with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy; or some combination of those treatments. Signs and symptoms 3D illustration showing oropharyngeal cancer The signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal cancer may include: *A sore throat that persists for over 2 weeks *Throat pain or difficulty swallowing *Unexplained rapid weight loss *Voice changes (more hoarse) *Ear pain *A lump in the back of the throat or mouth *A lump in the neck *A dull pain behind the sternum *Persistent Cough *Breathing problems *Hoarseness or other changes in the voice Risk factors The risk factors that can increase the risk of developing oropharyngeal cancer are: Major *Performing oral/mouth- genital sex on a person(s) with a human papillomavirus (HPV) genital infection. *Smoking and chewing tobacco *Heavy alcohol use Minor *A diet low in fruits and vegetables *Chewing betel quid, a stimulant commonly used in parts of Asia *Plummer‚ÄìVinson syndrome *Poor nutrition *Asbestos exposure *Certain genetic changes including: P53 mutation and CDKN2A (p16) mutations. Precancerous lesions High-risk * Erythroplakia * Speckled erythroplakia * Chronic hyperplastic candidiasis Medium-risk * Oral submucosal fibrosis * Syphilitic glossitis * Sideropenic dysphagia (Paterson- Kelly-Brown syndrome) Low-risk * Oral lichen planus * Discoid lupus erythematosus * Discoid keratosis congenita Pathophysiology The cancer can spread three ways: *Cancer invades the surrounding normal tissues. *Cancer invades the lymph system and travels through the lymph vessels to other places in the body. *Cancer invades the veins and capillaries and travels through the blood to other places in the body. Diagnosis Oropharyngeal cancer (from right tonsil, HPV-negative), T4a N2c, 48 year old man. Diagnosis is by biopsy of observed abnormal tissue in the oropharynx. Stages The National Cancer Institute (2016) provides the following definition: Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ) Abnormal cells are found in the lining of the oropharynx. These may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 1 Cancer has formed and is 20 mm or smaller and has not spread outside the oropharynx. Stage 2 Cancer has formed and is larger than 20 mm, but not larger than 40 mm. Also, it has not yet spread outside the oropharynx. Stage 3 *Cancer is larger than 40 mm and has not spread outside the oropharynx. *Any size and has spread to only one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the cancer. The lymph node with cancer is 30 mm or smaller. Stage 4A *Cancer has spread to tissues near the oropharynx, including the larynx (voice box), roof of the mouth, lower jaw, muscle of the tongue, or central muscles of the jaw, and may have spread to one or more nearby lymph nodes; none is larger than 60 mm. *Cancer is any size and has spread to one lymph node that is larger than 30 mm, but not larger than 60 mm on the same side of the neck as the cancer or to more than one lymph node, none larger than 60 mm, on one of both sides of the neck. Stage 4B *Cancer surrounds the main artery in the neck or has spread to bones in the jaw or skull, to muscle in the side of the jaw, or to the upper part of the throat behind the nose, and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. *Cancer has spread to a lymph node that is larger than 60 mm and may have spread to tissues around the oropharynx. Stage 4C Cancer has spread to other parts of the body; the tumor may be any size and may have spread to lymph nodes. Prognosis People with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer tend to have higher survival rates. The prognosis for people with oropharyngeal cancer depends on the age and health of the person and the stage of the disease. It is important for people with oropharyngeal cancer to have follow-up exams for the rest of their lives, as cancer can occur in nearby areas. In addition, it is important to eliminate risk factors such as smoking and drinking alcohol, which increase the risk for second cancers. Society and culture * In 1989, Monty Python member Graham Chapman died of oropharyngeal cancer, on the eve of Monty Python's 20th anniversary. *In 1995, actress Lana Turner died from oropharyngeal cancer three years after diagnosis. * In 2010, American actor Michael Douglas reported that he was diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer. * In 2014, Japanese musician and composer Ryuichi Sakamoto released a statement indicating that he had been diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer in late June of the same year. * In 2014, American musician and rhythm guitar player of Green Day, Jason White, was diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer on December 3. * In 2015, British musician Bruce Dickinson was diagnosed, and took a one-year break from Iron Maiden while undergoing treatment. * In 2017, Rob Derhak, bassist of the jam band moe, was diagnosed, prompting the band to go on indefinite hiatus.

He served in the French infantry from September 1914 until early June 1917, suffering two serious wounds in the process. On 28 June 1917, he transferred into aviation as a corporal. He joined Escadrille 89 as a fighter pilot on 8 January 1918. He would serve through war's end, sharing in six confirmed victories scored in conjunction with other pilots. Postwar, he would be granted the L√©gion d'honneur to add to his M√©daille militaire and Croix de Guerre. He became successively an agent for De Havilland beginning in 1932, then an air racing participant, and finally an aircraft engine designer and builder beginning in 1934. He died at Pozzi, Valeggio sul Mincio, Italy, aged 46. R√©gnier's death did not close down his aircraft engine company, which subsequently was captured and used by the Nazis during World War II. Biography See also Aerial victory standards of World War I Early life and infantry service √âmile Julien Mathurin R√©gnier was born on 29 July 1894 in Pl√©my, France. In the early days of World War I, on 1 September 1914, he joined the 115th Infantry Regiment of the French Army. On 26 February 1915, he was promoted to caporal. Shortly thereafter, on 16 March, he was wounded seriously enough to be evacuated to hospital. He would not be fit for duty until the end of the year; on 12 December, he was posted to the 112th Infantry Regiment. He was severely wounded once again, on 22 July 1916, not returning to duty until 14 November. Aviation service On 28 June 1917, √âmile R√©gnier began aviation training. After a normal progression of training, he was awarded Military Pilot's Brevet 8557 on 12 September. After advanced training, on 8 January 1918, he joined SPAD Escadrille 89 as a fighter pilot. On 12 April, he was promoted to sergent. He scored his first aerial victory on 17 June. He became an adjutant on 1 August. By 27 September, he had shared in six confirmed victories; he also had three unconfirmed claims. On 13 October 1918, he was awarded the M√©daille militaire for his valor. By war's end, he also had the Croix de Guerre to his credit, with six palmes and an √©toile de vermeile, and was a Sous lieutenant. By war's end, R√©gnier flew 615 combat hours, fought in 26 dogfights, and carried out 82 special missions. Post World War I R√©gnier received a belated appointment as a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur on 11 July 1920. Engine manufacturing Then there is a gap in the record of his life, though it seems likely he stayed in aviation. At the 1932 Paris Air Show, R√©gnier was the French agent for de Havilland, displaying a Gypsy III and a Gypsy Major.Flight, 24 November 1932, pp. 1103, 1105. By mid-1933, R√©gnier was edging into air racing; he supplied a Gypsy Major engine to power a Potez 43 in the Angers 12 hours air trial.Flight, 20 July 1933, p. 734. By 1934, he had gone into business for himself as R√©gnier Motor Company.Flight, 9 November 1933, p. 1134. R√©gnier designed an inverted air-cooled six-cylinder engine for use in a privately entered Caudron C.366 to compete in the Coupe Deutsch de Meurthe air race in 1934. The 217 brake horsepower motor was supposedly developed from a de Havilland inverted four-cylinder engine.Flight, 24 May 1934, pp. 510-511. On 6 January 1934, one of his engines, mounted in a Caudron C.362, set a new 1,000-kilometer speed record of 332.8 km/h for light aircraft; this was six days too late to claim a 50,000-franc prize from the French air ministry.Flight, 18 January 1934, p. 61. On 27 May 1934, it took second place in the 2,000 km Coupe Deutsch de Meurthe at virtually the same speed.Flight, 31 May 1934, p. 531. The R√©gnier engine powered a Percival Mew Gull to victory in the Coupe Armand Esders in July 1935 at 302 km/h.Flight, 5 September 1935, pp. 238-239. By 1936, the R√©gnier R-6 engine was being supercharged by a Rootes blower; six different engine types were shown at the Paris Air Show.Flight, 26 November 1936, pp. 561, 576, 578.

It is a melodrama set around the 5th Century and is based on Arthurian legend. Despite being written in the 1800s, its premiere was not until 2009, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. This delay was due to the play's once provocative nature. Due to his political beliefs, Thelwall was persecuted and subsequently exiled from England to Wales, where he wrote The Fairy of the Lake. Thelwall was later able to return to England after a taking up a new career as an elocutionist and practitioner of speech therapy.

In Act I, Rowenna, a Saxon sorceress who is married to the King of Britain (Vortigern), plots to overthrow her husband and win Arthur's love. She conjures the Fates and requests information about her passion and Arthur's future. Rowenna is cryptically told by the Fates that \\"Arthur's hand shall light the flame in which thy sorrows all expire.\\" Rowenna takes this as good news and summons a frost-demon, Incubus, to help her. She is then notified that Arthur and his knights have initiated a coup against Vortigern in retaliation for his treacherous relationship with the Saxons. In a fierce battle, Arthur slays Rowenna's father, Hengist, King of the Saxons. Rowenna learns that Vortigern has taken his daughter, Guenever, after fleeing the battle and plans to molest her. Instead of being distraught by her father's death, Rowenna is instead glad that he died by Arthur's hand and that Arthur's love for Guenever is soon to be tainted by her \\"rifled beauties.\\" Rowenna sets a plan in motion to win Arthur's heart. In Act II, the summoned Incubus aids Rowenna by freezing all of Arthur's men. Rowenna takes advantage of Arthur's distraught state and instructs her demons to tie him up after he sets down his enchanted sword. She attempts to charm him, but is thwarted when the Lady of the Lake appears and saves Arthur and his men. In Act III, Rowenna poisons Vortigern believing that she will fulfil her fate and be free to marry Arthur after her husband's death. However, Arthur storms the castle to rescue Guenever, and in doing so, he scorns the sorceress. Enraged, Rowenna orders the tower where Guenever is held to be set aflame. Guenever and Tristram, one of Arthur's trusted soldiers, are burned to death. A furious Arthur retaliates by burning down the rest of the castle. Rowenna is killed in the blaze, and the castle sinks into the moat, which magically becomes a lake. From its waters, the Lady of the Lake emerges in a chariot pulled by swans. She has rescued Tristram and Guenever. Arthur is reunited with Guenever and crowned as the true and virtuous King of Britain.  First performance  The play's first performance was held in October 2009 by The Dalhousie University Theatre Department and directed by the local Halifax theatre company, Zuppa.

He was one of the founders of the School Mathematics Project to reform O level and A level teaching. Through this he had a big effect on maths teaching in Britain and especially in Africa. Education and career Cundy attended Monkton Combe School and then read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he earned a PhD in quantum theory in 1938. In 1937, Cundy was awarded the Cambridge University Rayleigh Prize for Mathematical Physics (now known as the Rayleigh-Knight Prize) for an essay entitled \\"Motion in a Tetrahedral Field\\". Others awarded the Rayleigh Prize include Royal Society Fellows Alan Turing and Fred Hoyle; instead of acquiring a University position, Cundy initially chose work at the secondary school level. He taught at the Sherborne School from 1938 to 1966 and became prominently involved in the reform of school mathematics teaching in Great Britain. Secondary school Mathematics teachers became aware of Cundy after the appearance of his and his co-author A.P. Rollett's Mathematical Models, in continuous publication since 1952. A book focusing on the model construction of many of the regular polyhedra and other mathematical objects, Mathematical Models has remained \\"an inspiration for generations of mathematics teachers\\". Cundy was Deputy Director of the School Mathematics Project between 1967 and 1968. In 1968 he became Chair of Mathematics at the University of Malawi, and held the post until 1975. Cundy spent many years publishing dozens of articles in The Mathematical Gazette, including at age 89 the \\"Article of the Year\\" for 2003, entitled \\"A Journey round the Triangle: Lester's Circle, Kiepert's Hyperbola and a Configuration from Morley\\". Personal life He married Kathleen Ethel (\\"Kittie\\") Hemmings in 1939 and had three children, including Ian Cundy, successively Bishop of Lewes and of Peterborough. Martyn Cundy was a devout Christian and especially notable for his ecumenical views toward worship. In 1932 he was secretary of the Cambridge University Prayer Fellowship. Subsequently he served as a Methodist lay preacher and after taking up his position at the University of Malawi, an elder in the Malawi Presbyterian Church. In Malawi Cundy learned to speak the Chewa language and he and his wife Kittie were active members of the university community there. The Cundys were enthusiastic trekkers and together they contributed a walking guide to the Zomba Massif. On returning to the U.K. in 1975, the Cundys settled in Kendal and became active in the church community there. Martyn Cundy continued with his contributions to mathematics, religion and pedagogy for the remainder of his life.

Farber (born c. 1938) is an American newspaper reporter for The New York Times, whose investigations into the deaths of several patients at an Oradell, New Jersey, hospital led to the murder trial of Dr. Mario Jascalevich, a physician at the hospital who was alleged to have used a powerful muscle relaxant in what became known as the \\"Dr. X\\" case. After refusing to turn over notes from his investigation in response to a subpoena from the defense attorney in the case, Farber was jailed for contempt and the newspaper fined, ending up spending 40 days in jail with fines of $285,000 assessed. Appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, the case set a precedent for the limitations of shield laws in the United States. \\"Dr. X\\" case Initial investigation Farber's initial involvement in what would become known as the Dr. X case began in June 1975 when the paper received a letter from a woman claiming that as many as 40 patients had been murdered at a hospital by its chief surgeon. The letter handed to him offered no information as to where the alleged murders had occurred or who the murderer was- if there was anything at all to the letter.Farber, Myron. \\"On Not Naming Names \\", Smithsonian, September 2005. Accessed October 19, 2009. Farber pursued the case by speaking with someone in the forensic toxicology field who was able to recall a case at Riverdell Hospital, a private medical facility that had since closed. Further investigation led to the identification of Dr. Mario Jascalevich as the hospital's chief surgeon. While Jascalevich's surgical patients routinely survived, those of a new surgeon were dying at a significantly high rate. This new surgeon, together with directors of the hospital, opened Jascalevich's locker on October 31, 1966, and found 18 near empty vials of curare, a powerful muscle relaxant that could cause death if not administered in conjunction with artificial respiration. Trial and jail Attorney Raymond A. Brown blamed other doctors at the hospital of framing Jascalevich to cover up their own ineptitude and charged that Farber had conspired with prosecutors to advance their respective careers by pointing the finger of blame at Jascalevich.Berger, Joseph. \\"Raymond A. Brown, Civil Rights Lawyer, Dies at 94\\", The New York Times, October 11, 2009. Accessed October 12, 2009. After Brown subpoenaed the reporter, Farber testified in the case but cited the First Amendment of the United States Constitution when he refused to turn over thousands of pages of the reporter's notes that the defense had requested, citing a compelling right to protect the identity of the sources used in the articles from individuals who had spoken to him with the expectation that their confidence would be maintained.Corcoran, David. \\"Theodore Trautwein, Judge in Landmark Press Case, Dies at 80\\", The New York Times, September 2, 2000.

Accessed October 14, 2009. Trial judge William J. Arnold had Judge Theodore Trautwein address the issues related to the release of the papers in his role as assignment judge for all Bergen County courts. In July 1978, Trautwein sentenced Farber to six months in jail and assessed fines of $5,000 each day to The Times, saying that Farber had chosen placing \\"your privilege and your concept of your constitutional rights above the rights of the people of this state and this defendant\\" When Farber was about to be jailed, his attorneys filed for an emergency stay on a weekend and New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Morris Pashman arrived in his golfing attire to grant the stay. When the full court heard the case the next day, Pashman was the only dissenter as the court upheld the lower court ruling and ordered that Farber serve time in jail. When the court reaffirmed the lower court action in a decision in September 1978, Pashman and fellow Justice Alan B. Handler were the only dissenters.Honan, William H. \\"Morris Pashman, 87, Champion of Free Speech on New Jersey's Highest Court\\", The New York Times, October 10, 1999. Accessed October 19, 2009. With several breaks for appeals, Farber ended up spending a total 40 days in the Bergen County Jail and was not released until October 24 after Jascalevich was acquitted. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld Trautwein's decision and stripped reporters of shield law protections, though the New Jersey Legislature responded by passing even stronger shield laws to protect reporters. Trautwein's actions in regard to Farber have been used as a case study in both law schools and schools of journalism. Jane E. Kirtley of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press cited how \\"Farber's case roused journalists out of their complacency\\", noting that \\"Going to jail for more than a month is significant in anyone's eyes.\\" In November 1978, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to take the case, citing the fact that neither the United States Constitution nor existing state shield laws provide journalists with an absolute privilege to refuse to provide information demanded in a criminal case by a defendant.Greenhouse, Linda. \\"HIGH COURT REFUSES FARBER CASE REVIEW; Action Lets Jersey's Ruling Stand on First Amendment Privilege Supreme Court Refuses to Review Press Freedom Case A Delicate Balance Lack of a Hearing Deplored\\", The New York Times, November 28, 1978.

Early life Harrington knew early the rigors and fascinations of academic life. The son of Rose Martha Smith Harrington and Mark Walrod Harrington, a professor of astronomy at the University of Michigan who also held appointments in botany, zoology and geology, he spent his childhood roaming the area around Ann Arbor, Mich., his hometown, learning tribal languages from Indian friends and, when his family moved to Mount Vernon, New York, excavating and collecting local artifacts, thus feeding an early and lifelong interest in Native American culture. Education and archaeological career When his father's poor health and mental illness forced him to drop out of school, Harrington took some of his finds to Frederic Ward Putnam, then the curator in anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua15003 Putnam hired Harrington as an apprentice field archaeologist, a post that eventually allowed him to attend Columbia University, where he studied under the celebrated anthropologist Franz Boas. He earned a bachelor of science degree in 1907 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1908. That same year, he went to work for George Gustav Heye, the collector of Native American artifacts who later established the Museum of the American Indian in New York City. Harrington spent three years collecting artifacts and documenting tribes in the East and Midwest for Heye. He was assistant curator at the University of Pennsylvania museum 1911-1915. In 1912, Harrington met Mabel Dodge Luhan and introduced her and a group of friends to peyote during an impromptu \\"ceremony\\" at her apartment in Greenwich Village. Among the participants were anarchist Hutchins Hapgood and his wife, Harrington's cousin, author Neith Boyce Hapgood.Luhan, Mabel Dodge (1936) Movers and Shakers New York: Harcourt, Brace & Company. This incident became legendary in counterculture circles. In 1915, Harrington found native Ta√≠no villagers on eastern Cuba while conducting fieldwork. Later in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, he brought anthropologists to record the skeletal structure, blood type, and other physical attributes of the villagers.http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/What-Became-of-the- Taino.html?c=y&story;=fullstory In 1917, Harrington married Anna Alexander Johns, with whom he had a son, Johns Heye Harrington. He was born on September 5, 1918 and was named after his mother's maiden name and Gustav Heye. Harrington spent the next 13 years working for Heye as an archaeologist, ethnologist, field collector and curator in Arkansas, Tennessee, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nevada, Texas, Cuba, and Ecuador. Beginning in 1925, Harrington made some of his most significant discoveries, of ancient dwellings of Pueblo Indians and their precursors, known as ‚Äúthe Basketmakers,‚Äù in Nevada. One find was a set of 46 structures, the largest of which contained 100 rooms. Harrington estimated the earliest occupiers to have been there around 1500 BC. More recent studies have determined the artifacts from the site to be much more recent, from between 500 BC to 300 BC. Some of the stone and adobe dwellings appeared to have been made by Pueblo Indians, whose antiquity he also overestimated. Later study showed them to be from 700 to 1150 AD. Anna died on August 13, 1927 of an unspecified \\"brief illness.\\" In December of that year, Harrington married Edna L. Parker, a descendant of the famous Seneca religious leader of the Iroquois, Handsome Lake. She was also the sister of Arthur C. Parker, an archaeologist, folklorist and expert on Native Americans whose Iroquois name was Gawaso Wanneh. Friends knew Edna as Nandaka or Endeka and she often assisted Harrington on excavations. Southwest Museum In 1928, Harrington came to Los Angeles to be curator of archaeology at the Southwest Museum, beginning an association that would last until his retirement. During this time, he earned an honorary doctorate from Occidental College. He conducted excavations in Los Angeles, Nevada and other sites on behalf of the museum. He returned to the site, along the Muddy River, where he had made his earlier discoveries, to conduct a complete survey. In 1930, Harrington bought the dilapidated Andr√©s Pico Adobe, also known as the R√≥mulo Pico Adobe or Ranchito R√≥mulo, near the San Fernando Rey Mission in the San Fernando Valley. It is one of the oldest residences in Los Angeles. Partial walls still stood, but the floor, roof, a staircase, window and door frames required rebuilding. Harrington also built an addition to the north wing of the house, put a fireplace in the living room, rebuilt patio walls and added a garage. The couple lived there 15 years. At the time he undertook the Pico Adobe project, Harrington and a colleague also began to dig in Gypsum Cave in the Frenchman Range in Nevada, where they found Basketmaker artifacts. His niece, the archaeologist and ethnologist Bertha Parker, served as expedition secretary and discovered the skull of an extinct ground sloth. Excavators also found dung along with other parts of the skeleton. Harrington came to the controversial conclusion that humans and the ground sloth had existed at the same time and dated them to 8500 BC. Later studies showed he was in the correct range for the animal bones, but badly mistaken about the human artifacts, which were dated to 900-400 BC. His dating for another site at Tule Springs, near Las Vegas, has equally been called into question. Harrington found a spear point in an apparent fire pit alongside the bones of several ancient animals, which led him to assert in a published article that they were contemporaries and that the site was between 10,000 and 25,000 years old. More recent scrutiny has put his dating in doubt, however. In 1933, on loan from the museum, Harrington went to work for the National Park Service under the Civilian Conservation Corps. He directed a project to salvage as much as possible of the Pueblo Grande de Nevada archaeological site, also known as Nevada's \\"Lost City,\\" near Overton, Nevada. The site was about to be destroyed by the new Lake Mead, born of the construction of Hoover Dam. They found 17 new sites and dug until ‚Äúthere was literally water lapping at their boots.‚Äù In 1947, Harrington learned from a friend of an ancient site located about 160 miles northeast of Los Angeles that contained artifacts attributed to the Pinto Culture, believed to have existed in the area as early as 3000 BC. Harrington excavated the location‚Äîdubbed the Stahl site for the composer Willy Stahl, its discoverer‚Äîfor at least the next two years. During this time, on September 20, 1948, Edna died.

The Kingdom of Serbia occupied most of the Albanian-inhabited lands including Albania's Adriatic coast. Serbian Gen. Bo≈æidar Jankoviƒá was the Commander of the Serbian Third Army during the military campaign in Albania. The Serbian army met with strong Albanian guerrilla resistance, led by Isa Boletini, Azem Galica and other military leaders. During the Serbian occupation, Gen. Jankovic forced notables and local tribal leaders to sign a declaration of gratitude to King Petar I Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá for their \\"liberation by the Serbian army\\". The army of the Kingdom of Serbia captured Durr√´s on 29 November 1912 without any resistance. Right after their arrival in Durr√´s, on 29 November 1912, the Kingdom of Serbia established Draƒç County, its district offices and appointed the governor of the county, mayor of the city and commander of the military garrison. During the occupation, the Serbian army committed numerous crimes against the Albanian population \\"with a view to the entire transformation of the ethnic character of these regions.\\" The Serbian government denied reports of war crimes.Leo Freundlich: Albania's Golgotha Following the signing of the Treaty of London in May 1913 which awarded new lands to Serbia, including most of the former Vilayet of Kosovo, the Serbian government agreed to withdraw its troops from outside of its newly expanded territory. This allowed an Albanian state to exist peacefully. The final withdrawal of Serb personnel from Albania was in October 1913. Montenegrin campaign Montenegrin flag on Shkoder fortress. Shkod√´r and its surrounding had long been desired by Montenegro, although its inhabitants were overwhelmingly ethnic Albanians. The Siege of Scutari took place on 23 April 1913 between the allied forces of Montenegro and Serbia against the forces of the Ottoman Empire and the Provisional Government of Albania. Montenegro took Shkod√´r on 23 April 1913, but when the war was over the Great Powers didn't give the city to the Kingdom of Montenegro, which was compelled to evacuate it in May 1913, in accordance with the London Conference of Ambassadors. The army's withdrawal was hastened by a small naval flotilla of British and Italian gunboats that moved up the Bojana River and across the Adriatic coastline.Edith Durham, The Struggle for Scutari (Turk, Slav, and Albanian), (Edward Arnold, 1914) Greek campaign Caricature shows Albania defending itself from neighboring countries.

The role of d'Aramon was widely criticized by Charles V and Julius III on suspicion that he had encouraged the Ottomans to take the city. It appeared that d'Aramon had participated in the victory banquet of the Ottomans, raising further suspicions about his role in the siege, and leading to claims by Charles V that France participated in the siege. In any instance, d'Aramon had a special relationship with the Ottomans, and was clearly aware that the fall of Tripoli represented a major setback for Charles V.

After the independence of the Republic of Macedonia from Yugoslavia, the lion was proposed as a coat of arms of the new independent state several times. Background Between the 16th and the 18th centuries, the region of Macedonia was commonly represented in foreign armorials with a coat of arms depicting a golden lion on red field, or red lion on golden field.

The Belgrade Museum of Contemporary Art displays a 1620 version of the symbol with a three-pointed crown, while the Berlin Library displays a 17th-century version with the five-pointed crown. The use of the lion to represent Macedonia was continued in foreign heraldic collections throughout the 16th to 18th centuries During the late 19th century the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization arose, which aim was the autonomy for Macedonia and Adrianople regions. The organization modeled itself after the earlier Bulgarian revolutionary traditions and adopted their symbols as the lion, motto, etc.Duncan M.

Pettifer as ed., The New Macedonian Question, Springer, 1999 , p. 236.Georgi Rakovski described for the first time the lion and this motto in the poem \\"–ì–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏ –ø—ä—Ç–Ω–∏–∫\\", written in 1854 and issued in 1857. The plot of this poem concerns a Bulgarian who recruits a rebel cheta to mutiny against the Turks. It was used for the first time during the 1860s from the Bulgarian Legions in Serbia. Then Georgi Rakovski ordered a flag and a seal with the inscriptions \\"–°–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∞ –∏–ª–∏ —Å–º—ä—Ä—Ç—å\\". Rakovski summoned his fellow countrymen to go to the battle fields under the banners of the Bulgarian lion depicted dismembering the Islamic symbols. Veselin Nikolov Traƒ≠kov, G. Mukherjee, Georgi Stoikov Rakovski, a Great Son of Bulgaria and a Great Friend of India, Northern Book Centre, , p. 127.Per the memoirs of one of the founders of the IMARO - Hristo Tatarchev, at the beginning of 1894, they attempted to work out the Statute of the new organization. The founders had near at hand a volume of the Notes on the Bulgarian uprisings written by the Bulgarian revolutionary Zahari Stoyanov and an exemplar of the Statute of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee, and used them as a models. Petar Poparsov worked out a draft-Statute on the basis of this documents. For more see: Mercia MacDermott, Freedom Or Death: The Life of Gotse Delchev, Pluto Press, 1978, , p. 99.On the cover of the first statute of the Organization, which at the time was called Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees, is depicted a woman holding a flag with her right hand, on which is written \\"Svoboda ili smart\\". She is leaning on a pedestal on which a standing Bulgarian lion with a crown is depicted. With her left hand she holds a shield on which \\"Macedonia\\" is written. At the woman's feet lies a broken Ottoman flag with a half-moon and a torn chains. As described by the Bulgarian historian Tsotsho Bilyarski per –¶–î–ê, —Ñ. 1932 –∫, –æ–ø. 3, –∞. –µ. 1, –ª. 23. It was disbanded in 1934 by the Bulgarian army after a military coup. Several Macedonian parties have claimed after 1990 a line descent from the old IMARO.As organization's initial name shows (\\"Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees\\"), it had a Bulgarian national character: the revolutionary leaders were quite often teachers from the Bulgarian schools in Macedonia. This was the case of founders of the organization... Their organization was popularly seen in the local context as \\"the Bulgarian committee(s).

Proposed introduction The Republic of Macedonia had no heraldic emblem when the country gained independence from Yugoslavia, but since then this emblem has often been proposed as a replacement for the non-heraldic national emblem of the republic, a remnant of socialistic symbolism.Matkovski, Aleksandar, Grbovite na Makedonija, Skopje, 1970–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä –ú–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏ (1990) –ì—Ä–±–æ–≤–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞, –ú–∏—Å–ª–∞, Skopje, Macedonia - Such efforts have so far failed, due to political and national disputes over possible replacements. A proposal by architect and graphic designer Miroslav Grƒçev was put forward in 1992 to replace it with a revised version of the historical gold lion on a red shield. However, this was rejected on three main grounds: * several political parties, notably VMRO- DPMNE, already use that emblem as their party symbols * the Albanian political parties of Macedonia considered the proposal to be only representative for the ethnic Macedonians, but not also for ethnic Albanians * the state coat of arms of Bulgaria is somewhat similar (but not identical) Because of these reasons, the political parties agreed to continue to use the current device until a solution is found. The emblem did not appear on the country's first passports, however, in 2007 the device was put on the front and the inside of the new biometric Macedonian passports, while the parliamentary debate about acceptance of a new national emblem still continues. According to the provisions of the Article 5, Section 2 of the Constitution of Macedonia, the two-thirds majority is required to pass a law on the new symbols of the Republic. The usage of the Coat of arms has been defined by a law.Zakon za upotreba na grbot, znameto i himnata na Republika Makedonija (\\"Slu≈æben vesnik na Republika Makedonija\\", No. 32/97 , 1997-07-09) In 2009 Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization‚ÄìPeople's Party proposed the golden lion on red background as a new coat of arms of Macedonia, based on the traditional logo of the historical MRO, but it was not accepted. On the 5 December 2014 the VMRO-DPMNE government of the Republic of Macedonia, in accordance with the then policy of Antiquization, proposed a coat of arms which would replace the old national emblem. According to the president of the Macedonian Heraldry Society Jovan Jonovski, the new coat of arms is based on an illustration from Jerome de Bara (1581). The illustration from de Bara's book \\"Le blason des armoiries\\" depicts attributed arms of Alexander the Great. It is blazoned as \\"Or, a lion gules\\" (on a golden background, a red lion) and topped with a golden mural crown to represent the republican form of government. The parliament did not vote on this design. Present usage The coat of arms with a golden lion on a red shield is used to represent several Macedonian political parties, including the largest one; Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization ‚Äì Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity and Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization‚ÄìPeople's Party. At the same time, the lion as a symbol of these parties is inherited from the original organization VMRO, where it was borrowed from the Bulgarian coat of arms.–¢–æ–¥–æ—Ä –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤, –ù–µ–ª–µ–≥–∞–ª–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –∞—Ä–º–∏—è –Ω–∞ –í–ú–û–†–û –≤ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è –∏ –û–¥—Ä–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ: 1899 - 1908, –∏–∑–¥. \\"–°–≤–µ—Ç–∏ –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏ –ø–æ–±–µ–¥–æ–Ω–æ—Å–µ—Ü\\", 1993, —Å—Ç—Ä. 133.Liubomir Panaƒ≠otov, Ilindensko- Preobrazhenskoto v≈≠stanie ot 1903 g: voenna podgotovka i provezhdane, Institut za voenna istoria, 1992, str. 167.

The film was written and directed by P. Vasu and is a sequel to the 2004 blockbuster film Apthamitra also directed by Vasu and starring Vishnuvardhan. The film was released on 19 February 2010 to highly positive reviews. The movie was remade in Telugu as Nagavalli with Venkatesh Daggubati. The movie was dubbed in Telugu as Raja Vijaya Rajendra Bahadur (Nagavalli - Return of Chandramukhi), in Hindi as Sab Ka Rakhwala under the production of Sumeet Arts and in Bengali as Amar Rakshak.  Plot  The story starts off with an ancient painting of Nagavalli (Vimala Raman) floating away to distant places, where it finally comes into the hands of a village painter. The painter brings it home so as to restore it back to its original look. However, when his wife asks him to sell the painting, he becomes furious, saying that he wouldn't sell it off even at the cost of his life. The next day, the painter is shown to be dead under mysterious circumstances, possibly being a suicide. The painting is then sold off to a dance competition, which was distributed as a prize to Bharata Natyam dancer Saraswathi (Lakshmi Gopalaswamy), her husband and her family. On the Engagement day of Gowri (Sandhya), one of her friends had fainted by encountering a huge thirty-feet Snake, and the bridegroom had run away from the family house fearing of something. All strange incidents happen as the family called for a snake charmer to the house, but the snake charmer had died when he attempted to make the serpent appear. The members of the family are psychologically affected by the presence of Nagavalli's painting and things have not been going well in the house. So they decide to contact Acharya Ramchandra Shastry (Avinash), an astrologer cum sage. The father of the three daughters tells the Acharya that Saraswathi and her husband met with a fatal accident and died, after the bharathanatyam competition. The Acharya takes the help of Dr Vijay (Vishnuvardhan), a psychiatrist, to solve the problem. All directions point to the huge portrait of Nagavalli, and is observed that the portrait is the cause for this. Everyone is warned to not go to the outhouse or to the room where Nagavalli's painting is. One night, Dr. Vijay goes to the outhouse as he heard anklet sounds, and he sees another smaller portrait of Nagavalli in the outhouse. It is then revealed that Saraswathi is still alive, but became mad after the truck accident in which her husband died while he was carrying the painting of Nagavalli, and that she said that no one accepted to marry the second daughter Geetha because Saraswathi was mad and so Geetha vowed that she wouldn't marry, and since they didn't want Gowri's situation to be like this, they lied saying Saraswathi was dead, and locked her up in the outhouse. In a few occasions, someone attempted to murder the Acharya twice. Suspecting Saraswathi, the acharya asks the family members to bring Saraswathi to the temple and that he will show everyone that Nagavalli is in Saraswathi's body, but as Saraswathi steps the temple, all the animals run out of the temple. Suspecting each and every person in the family, Dr. Vijay starts to investigate everything so he goes to the library to read a book based on Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur's life and further information on Nagavalli too. The investigation also takes back to around 125 years when Raja Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur (Vishnuvardhan) used to live and how his enmity with Nagavalli has been going on since centuries. Dr. Vijay becomes very shocked to see the Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur for two reasons: 1. The portrait he saw in the old palace 5 years ago, was in fact the portrait of Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur's elder brother, Vinaya Rajendra Bahaddur, who was killed by Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur himself for the sake of ruling the kingdom. 2. Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur resembles Dr. Vijay. It is revealed in the book that he had attempted to escape as one of his men had spread a dirty rumour about him, which caused the whole Ramnagara Dominion and the people to go and slaughter and assassinate him... but the book doesn't say if he got assassinated, or if he really committed suicide or if he is alive. Dr. Vijay finishes reading the book and whilst signing the ledger, he reads the name above him: Nagavalli... and he understands that she had read the book before he had. To further investigate about Nagavalli, Dr. Vijay goes to Nagavalli's place in Peddapuram, Andhra Pradhesh and an old man told the Doctor that Nagavalli's family died back at around a hundred years and told him that he was the second person to enquire about Nagavalli's family, and as the Doctor asked who that person was, the old man told him that a girl came and inquired about Nagavalli, and he also says that she was fine whilst asking the questions, but when she returned from Nagavalli's place, she was holding a portrait of Nagavalli and ran away like a mad girl, so the Doctor goes to Nagavalli's house and realizes that the portrait in the outhouse was the portrait of Nagavalli which had been taken, as he glanced at an empty wall with a rectangular marking outline. Dr. Vijay also investigates about Saraswathi's husband's death and the snake charmer's death, and he comes with information that the snake charmer's death and Saraswathi's husband's death had nothing to do with Nagavalli. Dr. Vijay reveals that Raja Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur is still alive when he printed out an astrological profile and showed the astrologer, who revealed it. So Dr. Vijay goes to the Fort where the Raja is, and at the time, the Acharya performs a pooja to try to bring Nagavalli out of Saraswathi's body. The Doctor luckily escapes from the invincible Raja, and when the Acharya asks for Saraswathi's name, she says her name as Nagavalli Saraswathi, but is revealed that she is still mad, but not affected by Nagavalli. Dr. Vijay comes back to cure Saraswathi from her madness, and he succeeds, but the problem of Nagavalli is not finished yet, and he knows who is affected by Nagavalli. Later the Doctor reveals to everyone that Gowri is affected by Nagavalli as he makes her angry and change personality from Gowri to Nagavalli in front of everyone, then she swoons after she returns to normal. Then later, he explains to everyone that Gowri had written both the names while she signed the ledger: Gowri in English when she was borrowing the book, Nagavalli in Telugu when she was returning the book, and that it was also her who scared the bridegroom away on the Engagement day and sat downstairs like as if she didn't know anything. In order to know more about Nagavalli's lover Ramanatha (Vineeth), she went to Nagavalli's house as Gowri, and returned with Nagavalli's photo, completely as Nagavalli. Gowri later goes to the fort where Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur is, to kill him. Dr. Vijay, knowing Gowri would have definitely sought revenge goes to the fort where the Raja almost gets burnt to death, but he survives when it starts to rain, then Dr. Vijay has a battle with him, and the Raja almosts decapitates Gowri/Nagavalli, but before he does so, the Raja gets struck by a lightning; thus, throwing his sword above and as it comes down, it stabs the Raja in the neck, who then dies. Gowri is no more affected by Nagavalli anymore and is going to marry the bridegroom she scared away, and Geetha is going to marry too and it all comes to a happy ending.  Cast  Production Casting Initially there were speculations on the role of lead actress, after Soundarya, who starred in the original Apthamitra, died in a helicopter crash in 2004. It was later proposed that South Indian actress Sneha would play the lead role. But due to her busy schedule, Sneha was unable to join the sets and then she was replaced by Sandhya. Later Bharatha Natyam dancer actress Vimala Raman was selected for the role of Nagavalli, a dancer in the film. Vishnuvardhan died following a cardiac arrest on 30 December 2009. Vishnuvardhan had completed the voice dubbing before his death. Filming The film started filming in March 2009 in Palani, Tamil Nadu. The majority of shooting was done in Mysore. The fort, where the villain Vijayarajendra Bahaddur resides, is based on the real fort located in Gingee. Soundtrack The soundtrack of the film is popular. Television Rights Kannada Version Rights are acquired by Star Suvarna and Star Suvarna Plus. Telugu dubbed version rights are acquired by Star Maa. Hindi dubbed version rights are acquired by UTV (TV channel). Bengali dubbed Version rights are acquired by Zee Bangla Cinema. Reception Critics The film got almost good reviews from critics.

Background Algiers had been under the control of the Ottoman Emperor Suleiman the Magnificent since its capture in 1529 by Barbarossa. Barbarossa had left Algiers in 1535 to be named High Admiral of the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople, and was replaced as governor by Hassan Agha, a eunuch and Sardinian renegade.

He lived in the jungle, without contact with civilization, until the age of 17, when he became cacique.

He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil by the Democratic Labour Party from 1983‚Äì1987, representing Rio de Janeiro. His election had strong repercussions in Brazil and the world. He was responsible for the creation of a permanent commission for Indians, which brought formal recognition to issues related to Indians. In 1984, he denounced the businessman Calim Eid for having attempted to bribe him to vote for Paulo Maluf, the presidential candidate supported by the military regime then in power. He voted for Tancredo Neves, the democratic opposition candidate. He was not reelected in 1986, but he remained active in politics for several years.

In contrast to squalene, due to the complete saturation of squalane, it is not subject to auto-oxidation. This fact, coupled with lower costs associated with squalane, make it desirable in cosmetics manufacturing, where it is used as an emollient and moisturizer. The hydrogenation of squalene to produce squalane was first reported in 1916. In basic research, squalane is used as a reference liquid in tribology. Source and production Squalene was traditionally sourced from the livers of sharks, with approximately 3000 required to produce one ton of squalane. Due to environmental concerns, other sources such as olive oil, rice and sugar cane have been commercialized, and as of 2014 have been supplying about 40% of the industry total. In manufacturing, farnesene is produced from fermentation of sugarcane sugars using genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains. Farnesene is then dimerized to isosqualene and then hydrogenated to squalane. Cosmetics use Squalane was introduced as an emollient in the 1950s. While squalane can be found in small quantities in sebaceous secretions (sebum), it is squalene that is most commonly found in nature, most notably in human sebum and the livers of sharks.

Geography Stratford is NNW of the Cairns CBD. It is bounded to the north by the Barron River. It is bounded to the east by the Captain Cook Highway. The northern part of the suburb is situated on the lower slopes (10‚Äì40 metres above sea level) of Mount Whitfield and Lumley Hill and is used for residential housing. The southern part of the suburb is undeveloped dense bushland on the higher slopes rising to about 160 metres. History Stratford is in the traditional lands of the Yidiny people. European occupation along the banks of the Barron River began in late 1876 when the Douglas Track and Smith's Track were established around Lumley Hill and Mount Whitfield, linking the new port of Cairns to the Hodgkinson goldfields. In early 1877 John Oldham built the Halfway House (also known as the Half-Way Hotel) on the bank of the Barron River. On 19 July 1877 Constable Michael Dwyer of the Special Division of Escort, which guarded the transportation of gold from the Hodgkinson to Trinity Bay, was shooting scrub turkeys with a packer, William Guilfoyle, near the hotel, when Dwyer tripped and accidentally shot himself in the side. Badly wounded he was taken to the Hotel and Guilfoyle rode off to Old Smithfield township town to get help. He returned with George Rutherford, the local chemist, and shortly afterwards Dr Myers arrived from Cairns. Despite their best efforts, Dwyer died that evening and was buried built near the hotel. A headstone was erected, making this the first marked European grave in the Cairns area. In 1878 Samuel Cochrane became the first farmer in the area when he purchased 'Lot 160', 110 acres on the southern bank of the Barron. He built a homestead which he named 'Lily Bank' and grew maize, English potatoes, sweet potatoes and pumpkins. In 1885 Parliament approved plans for the first section of the Cairns-Herberton railway from Cairns to Redlynch, and this led to increased interest in the area. Surveyor Thomas Behan purchased a 13-acre lease with water frontage on the Barron, where he built a steam-powered rice mill (now the site of the Stratford Bowls Club) and a house, Cochrane opened the Lilybank Hotel, Alexander Finlayson opened the Range Hotel and store nearby, and Martin & Sons built the Union Sawmill on the river-bank. The land adjacent to Lily Bank farm was subdivided into 50 five- and ten-acre blocks and auctioned off as the 'River-View Estate'. Construction of the railway began in April 1886, with the lines laid to the Five-mile Siding by June 1887, and passenger services commencing on 8 October 1887. In December 1887, William Henry Boden rented Behan's house at the Five-mile and applied for a publican's license to run the premises as the 'Stratford Hotel'. Around this time the Five-Mile siding was renamed Stratford station. Another station was opened further along the line at Lilybank. The Cairns Regional Council website incorrectly attributes the suburb's name to an unidentified Australian Imperial Force veteran, 'Harry Stratford', whose alleged exploits at Gallipoli occurred several decades after the opening of Boden's Stratford Hotel and the Stratford railway siding. Heritage listings Stratford has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Magazine Street: former Explosives Magazine and Detonator Store In 2009 for the Q150 commemorations, the Stratford and Freshwater Community Association built a heritage trail, with 29 signposted sites in Stratford and 22 signposted sites in the neighbouring suburb of Freshwater, Queensland.  Amenities  There are several restaurants, a pub, The Barron River Hotel, a service station, a newsagent, convenience store, launderette, a pizza shop, medical center, pharmacy, veterinary clinic and deli. Cairns Regional Council operate a public library at 11 Kamerunga Road. The Library opened in 1956 and underwent a major refurbishment in 2008. In the 2006 census, Stratford had a population of 1,178 people. In the 2011 census, Stratford had a population of 1,109 people.

The school's methods prompted criticism in the media and disputes with the London County Council (LCC). The school was closed down in 1965.Risinghall Revisited - Michael Duane (1915 ‚Äì 1997)Risinghill: Death of a Comprehensive School, Leila Berg, Penguin Books The school buildings in Risinghill Street, London N1, were subsequently utilised by Starcross School which later amalgamated with Barnsbury School to become Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School. Pupils received religious education through Saint Silas Church, which was part of Risinghill. Lessons included technical and craft skills, taught through dual or multi-purpose creative methods. Risinghill was a new, purpose built co-educational secondary school that opened in Islington, north London on 3 May 1960, and was closed four and a half years later, ostensibly because it had become unpopular with parents. A book chronicling its demise made publishing history in 1968 by becoming the UK's first non-fiction best-seller. Risinghill: death of a Comprehensive School catapulted the author, Leila Berg, to fame, along with Risinghill's progressive headmaster, Michael Duane. Over the years, the school has been described widely as a rogue school with a maverick head, who did not command the respect of his staff or the respect of his pupils. These assertions, some of which came from individuals claiming to be well acquainted with the school, and the events leading up to and including its closure, was the impetus for establishing the Risinghill Research Group (RRG). This was formed in 2004 to establish: (1) the truth of the Risinghill affair; and (2) the effects of the school on the children. Although forty years had passed, in educational circles Risinghill was still being talked about, and remained, very much, an enigma. The RRG comprises former pupils of the school, one of whom, Alan, was a pupil from 1960 through to 1965 when Risinghill closed. He appears in Berg's book under the pseudonym ‚ÄòRoger‚Äô and remembers Berg visiting his home to interview his mother. In the course of its research, the RRG not only found Berg, but others whom she had interviewed for her book. This included some of the teaching staff and others involved with the school, thus confirming the authenticity of her interviews which, at the time, were contested, strongly, along with her account of what had happened to Duane and to his school. While some of Berg's descriptions of Islington, and of the pupils‚Äô homes and family backgrounds were somewhat flamboyant, causing offence to some, including many of the Risinghill pupils, the events that she described were far from mythical. Insofar as Duane's back-story was concerned, the RRG was fortunate to meet and interview Margaret Duane (Duane's widow), who supported Berg's account of what happened to Duane pre and post Risinghill. The RRG's project took longer to complete than expected, but Risinghill Revisited (RR), which comprises two books, was eventually published in September 2019*, almost 15 years after the Group had been established. The first book (Risinghill Revisited: The Killing of a Comprehensive School) provides a detailed account of the events leading up to and including the birth and death of the school, which includes the testimonies of over two hundred pupils, seventy of whom completed a detailed pupil questionnaire, and eight former teachers of the school, who also completed a questionnaire for the teachers. The second book Risinghill Revisited: The Waste Clay focuses more on the research with the teachers and the pupils, giving them all a voice for the first time. The book also looks at Duane's career post Risinghill, and includes a piece by Berg, entitled ‚ÄòThe Next Room‚Äô, which is a moving tribute to Duane. The research with the pupils is of particular interest as many have prospered in life, despite all the meddling with their education, and despite them being written off as failures - on account of their association with a school that has been dubbed a ‚ÄòBlackboard Jungle‚Äô and worse. Their contribution(s) to the Risinghill story, and thereby the wider debate(s) about the education of disadvantaged children is crucial to understanding not just what happened at Risinghill, but what is still happening in many of our state secondary schools today. The gap between the privileged and under-privileged child remains as wide as it has ever been, despite the fact that every child is supposed to matter, and that every child, supposedly, is be given equal opportunity to succeed. The latter principle was enshrined in the 1944 Education Act, but has still not been achieved. Duane was an embarrassment to the establishment in this regard as he firmly believed that every child did matter, and tried to do something about this. This belief shines through Berg's story of Risinghill, as it does the two Risinghill Revisited books, and in this sense the Risinghill story is as relevant today as it was 50+ years ago - when Berg had the temerity to challenge the status quo.

He was president of both the International Astronomical Union and the American Astronomical Society. His research focused on solar physics and the application of atomic physics to astronomy, and he led many of the early efforts to study the Sun from space telescopes. Early life Goldberg was born in the Brooklyn section of New York City to Jewish immigrant parents, Harry and Rose Goldberg n√©e Ambush, from eastern Poland, (then part of the Russian Empire). He lived in a tenement building in Brooklyn with his parents and two brothers, two sisters, one brother two years older and the other some eight years younger until a fire destroyed the tenement in 1922. The fire killed his mother and infant brother and hospitalized the nine-year-old Leo and his older brother. Goldberg was in a hospital for some months and his brother for over a year. In 1924 Goldberg's father remarried to Bertha Sherer, and they had two children together, Lilian and Harold. A year later the family moved to New Bedford, Massachusetts. His father, a milliner, set up a store there and Goldberg worked there on his evenings and weekends during his high school years.Interview with Weart, Session 1 Goldberg was encouraged by career guidance councilors at the school to pursue a career in engineering since he did well in science and math classes. He originally decided to apply to MIT, but since this would have put him and his brother‚Äîwho had been placed in the same year as him because of his extended hospital stay‚Äîin competition for a single scholarship, supposedly because of their religion, he decided to withdraw and work in his father's store for another year. In 1930 he enrolled in the Harvard Engineering School on a tuition scholarship from the New Bedford Harvard Club. While there he took an introductory astronomy course and decided to change his major to astronomy at the start of his fourth year. Personal life On July 9, 1943, Goldberg married Charlotte Belle Wyman, and they married in a Jewish Ceremony in Pontiac, Michigan. In 1944, they had a daughter, Suzanne, in Pontiac, Michigan. They then had David in 1946 (David's namesake was Leo's paternal grandfather, David Yevreiski of GoniƒÖdz) and had Edward in 1951. The family lived in Michigan, and then in Massachusetts in the 1960s, and eventually to Tucson, Arizona where both Leopold and Charlotte died, although divorced at the times of their deaths. Academic career Goldberg received his Ph.D. in astronomy in 1938, also from Harvard. He remained there for three years after graduating on a special research fellowship, before being appointed to the staff of the McMath-Hulbert Observatory in Lake Angelus, Michigan in 1941. While there he worked on an anti-submarine project during World War II.Biographical Memoirs, p. 117 In 1946 he was given the job of department chairman and observatory director at Michigan, where he began filling gaps left by a series of recent retirements, deaths, and resignations. He procured several new telescopes for the university, including an 85-foot radio dish to exploit the new and growing field of radio astronomy.Biographical Memoirs, p. 119 He also began espousing the possibilities of space-based observations of astronomical objects and particularly the Sun, but received little support in this idea‚Äîwhich would have necessitated significant investment in infrastructure‚Äîfrom the university administration. He remained at Michigan until 1960, when he returned to Harvard to take up a professorship. Six years later he was made chair of Harvard's astronomy department and directory of its observatory.Obituary 3 November 1987. New York Times. Research Goldberg worked extensively in the fields of Solar physics and spectroscopy. Much of his work was carried out using observations from satellites, including the fourth and sixth Orbiting Solar Observatories and the space station Skylab.Biographical Memoirs, p. 128 International Astronomical Union Goldberg began to play an active role in the IAU while at Michigan, acting as chair of the U.S. delegations to the 10th and 11th general assemblies in 1958 and 1961.Biographical Memoirs, p. 128-129 The 1958 meeting was held in Moscow, and despite the ongoing Cold War the Russians had allowed delegates from all member countries to attend. The Americans wished to host the next meeting, in 1961, on the same terms.Biographical Memoirs, p. 129 This would require clearing the offer with the State Department under Secretary John Foster Dulles, and in particular his science adviser Wallace Brode. Brode, a strong anti-Communist, objected to the fact that the Communist People's Republic of China was a member of the IAU while the democratic Republic of China was not. He wanted Goldberg to present the U.S.'s invitation at the 1958 meeting, but with the condition that the ROC would be admitted immediately. Goldberg refused this demand on the grounds that the ROC‚Äîwhich at the time had no practicing research astronomers‚Äîwould have to apply and be considered in the usual way. He also objected to the idea that the invitation to the 1961 meeting should be contingent on the ROC's acceptance.Interview with Weart, Session 2 He offered to resign his position as delegate, but the National Academy of Sciences gave him their support and the ROC's application was allowed to proceed normally. The country was admitted in 1959 and the 11th assembly went ahead as planned, with Goldberg chairing the U.S. delegation.Biographical Memoirs, p. 129-130 Goldberg was elected one of the six Vice-Presidents of the IAU in 1958 and served two consecutive three-year terms, ending in 1964.Past Executive Committee, 1958-1961 and 1961-1964.

Cinematic production in Ecuador began in the 1920s, with the production of the first Ecuadorian dramatic feature film, El Tesoro de Atahualpa, directed by the Ecuadorian Augusto San Miguel in 1924.Enciclopedia del Ecuador, p. 605. Moreover, in the same decade, the Italian Carlos Crespi directed the major documentary Los Invisibles Shuaras del Alto Amazonas. Between 1930 and 1931, the advent of talkies stopped the development of Ecuadorian film, which tried to cope with the new films using \\"live sound\\" (\\"sonorizaci√≥n en vivo\\"), that is, the interpretation of texts and songs simultaneously with the projection, though without success. Because of this, for around two decades Ecuadorian cinema revolved around documentaries, news programs, and promotional tourist films, with the exception of dramatic feature films in 1950.Enciclopedia del Ecuador, p. 606. However, Ecuadorian cinema was promoted by intellectuals in the 1960s, including Ulises Estrella, director of the Cinemateca Nacional. During this period, Mexican-Ecuadorian co-productions proliferated.Enciclopedia del Ecuador, p. 607. During the next decade, the documentary genre was strengthened, and in 1977 the Asociaci√≥n de Autores Cinematogr√°ficos del Ecuador was legalized. Between the 1980s and the present, Ecuadorian cinema returned to the production of feature films. One example of this trend was the 1989 cinematic adaptation of Jos√© de la Cuadra's La Tigra, directed by Camilo Luzuriaga. Luzuriaga also directed Entre Marx y una Mujer Desnuda, a cinematic adaptation of 1809-1810: Mientras llega el d√≠a by Jorge Enrique Adoum, which related the story of Quite√±o independence. Other major films in the rebirth of Ecuadorian cinema were Ratas, ratones y rateros (1999) and Cr√≥nicas (2004) by director Sebasti√°n Cordero. As of 2008, Cordero was filming his third feature film in Spain, an adaptation of the novel Rabia by the Argentine writer Sergio Bizzio. Recently the film Qu√© tan lejos by Cuenca's Tania Hermida was highly acclaimed, receiving the Silver Zenith Award Montreal World Film Festival for the best directorial debut. Other recent productions that are making their way through festivals include the documentary El Comit√© by Mateo Herrera and Cuando me toque a m√≠ by V√≠ctor Arregui. When Cuando me toque a m√≠ was presented at the Biarritz Festival of Film and Culture of Latin America, the lead actor, Manuel Calisto, won the prize for best actor. During the 1980s, Ecuador would typically produce one film a year, with this rising to around twelve a year by the mid-2010s.

The book is a sequel to The Pigman following the lives of John and Lorraine shortly after The Pigman's death at the end of the first story and how they quickly make up for it. Plot summary Just like the first book, the story is divided into chapters narrated by either John or Lorraine. Taking place four months after The Pigman, this book involves the main characters, John and Lorraine once again. The beginning deals with the lives of the two after the Pigman's death and how it has affected them. John and Lorraine are walking by the former residence of Mr. Pignati and discover an elderly gentleman apparently on the run from the IRS. He rejects their advances and chases them away. Feeling that the Pigman has given them a chance to make things right once and for all, they befriend the senior, named Gus. Gus tells the pair that he was a good friend of Colonel Parker Glenville, who was knighted by the King of Sweden for the subway system he designed for Stockholm. They lived in a townhouse in Stuyvesant. The Colonel was later run over by the train, according to Gus, and was apparently evicted. Gus asks the duo to help him retrieve a vital trunk he has left at the town-house. John and Lorraine later find a photo of Gus, who is revealed to be the bankrupt Colonel, Gus being the name of his German Shepherd who finds them at the townhouse and joins the trio. The Colonel later gets abdominal pains on the way back home and is rushed to the hospital. There, the duo learn that the Colonel has diverticulosis, which was aggravated by the fudge John and Lorraine gave him. John and Lorraine try to help him again and introduce him to Dolly Racinski, the school cafeteria cleaning lady. Soon, the two senior citizens fall in love. One day, the teens and the seniors take a trip to Atlantic City, where John gambles away all of the Colonel's money. On the way back, the Colonel suffers another diverticulosis attack. He asks for Dolly's hand in marriage on his deathbed, and John and Lorraine travel to the convent across the street from the Pigman's house and get a priest to come to the hospital quickly and marry the senior sweethearts, which he does. After the wedding, the teens get Gus from the car, and run back up to the Colonel's room, only to find that he has died, leaving Dolly a bride and a widow all in the same day. It is revealed that the Colonel has undergone surgery a few times to correct his diverticulosis, but in vain. He ran away because he did not wish to die in a poorhouse. After his death, John and Lorraine reflect on the Pigman's legacy: love.

In addition a reprocessing facility referred to as New Labs also exists for nuclear weapons research and production. The first nuclear reactor was supplied and financially constructed by the Government of United States of America in the mid 1960s. The other reactor and reprocessing facility are built and supplied by Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. Supervised by the United States and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the first two reactors are subject to IAEA safeguards and its inspections.  History of PARR-Reactors  The PARR-I Reactor was supplied by the United States government in 1965 under the Atoms for Peace program. The PINSTECH institute was designed by American architect Edward Durrell Stone, when noted Pakistani scientists, Abdus Salam and Ishrat Hussain Usmani travelled to the United States of America in the early 1960s. The first reactor was supplied by the American Machine and Foundry as its contractors, and the first reactor was built by the American nuclear engineer Peter Karter.Mastermind of the MRF Logsdon, Gene. BioCycle. Emmaus: April 1993. Vol. 34, Iss. 4; pg. 49, ff. In the first stage, reactor building and ancillary facilities were completed with the reactor becoming critical on 21 December 1965. The second stage, consisting of various laboratories, workshop, library and auditorium, became operational in 1974. The facility was last upgraded by PAEC chairman and noted nuclear scientist, Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan in 1989.  PARR-I Reactor  The PARR-I Reactor was the first reactor that was supplied by American Machine and Foundry. Peter Karter had personally supervised the construction of the reactor. The PARR-I is a swimming pool-type and Materials Test Reactor (MTR) type research reactor. Originally based on a designed to use the Highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel, the HEU fuel use the ~93% enriched in 235U at a power level of 5 MW. The first reactor went critical on 21 December 1965 under the supervision of Hafeez Qureshi, Dr. M. N. Qazi, Naeem Ahmad Khan and Saleem Rana. The PARR-I Reactor attained its full power on 22 June 1966. In PARR-I, it is virtually impossible to adopt secure the fresh supplies of the HEU fuel. However, to ensure the continuity of the nuclear fuel, PARR-I was converted to use the ~20% Low-enriched uranium (LEU) from the 235U in October 1991 The nuclear fuel conversion program was led by the PAEC chairman Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan. The reactor was also upgraded from the power level of 5 MW to 10 MW. The program was carried out to meet demands of higher neutron fluxes for experimental research purposes and the isotope production. The upgraded reactor was also made available to compensate for the decrease in neutron flux due to higher concentration of 238U in the LEU fuel as compared to the HEU fuel. The reactor was made critical on 31 October 1991 under the supervision of Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad and Dr. Iqbal Hussain Qureshi, and attained power level of 10 MW on 7 May 1992. The core configuration attained its equilibrium configuration in February 1995.  PARR-II Reactor  The PARR-II Reactor is an indigenously designed and constructed reactor owned by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. The PARR-II Reactor's design is similar to Miniature neutron source reactor (MNSR) and SLOWPOKE reactor. The reactor was indigenously designed by the PAEC as the chairman Munir Ahmad Khan and his team of engineers and scientists also led the construction of the reactor. The PARR-II Reactor had gone critical and began operating on 21 January 1974. The PARR-II Reactor is a tank-in-pool reactor with a rated power of 27‚Äì30 kW. Same as the first reactor, the reactor is designed to use the High Enrich Uranium (HEU) fuel. The HEU fuel use the ~90% 235U at a power level of 30 kW. The demineralised light water is used as a coolant moderator and the reactor core is reflected by metallic Be4. A PARR-II consists of a core reactor, control rod, and nuclear reflectors, and it is enclosed in a water-tight cylindrical Al13 alloy vessel. The nuclear reactor core is an under-moderated array with 1H to 235U ratio of temperature of 20 ¬∞C and provides a strong Negative temperature coefficient and thermal volume coefficients of reactivity. The PAEC scientists and engineers also built and constructed the nuclear accelerator on 9 April 1989. The particle accelerator is heavily used to conduct research in nuclear technology.  New Labs  Unlike the PARR-I and PARR-II the New Labs is not subject to IAEA inspections. and is completely different from its parent reactors. It is a plutonium-fuel reprocessing plant and works as a pilot 94Pu reprocessing facility with a capability to use the ~7% 239Pu, to handle the isotopes and use the 86Kr emissions and radiation. It is also a reprocessing plant to change <~7% 239Pu into <~7% weapon-grade 240Pu fuel. New Labs were designed and constructed indigenously by Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) under its chairman Munir Ahmad Khan whereas it project-director was a mechanical engineer, Chaudhry Abdul Majeed. The construction of the facility was led by NESPAK. In the 1960s PAEC contracted the project with British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL), and Saint-Gobain Techniques Nouvelles (SGN). PAEC engineers and scientists led the initial design for a large-scale reprocessing plant with a capacity to re-process 100 tons of fuel per year, while BNFL and SGN provided funds, technical assistance, and nuclear fuel. However, after the India's Operation Smiling Buddha nuclear test, both British and French consumer companies immediately cancelled their contracts with PAEC. The plant was completed in 1981 and cold reprocessing tests for producing plutonium took place at New Labs in 1986. The New Labs came into limelight when Pakistan had secretly tested its plutonium weapon-based nuclear device in Kirana Hills.How Pakistan Made Nuclear Fuel\\" by Munir Ahmad Khan, former chairperson of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission: Islamabad The Nation 7 February 1998, page 7 On 30 May 1999, the PAEC scientists, under renowned nuclear physicist Dr. Samar Mubarakmand, had tested a miniaturised nuclear device that is believed to be a Plutonium devices for which plutonium was most likely reprocessed by the Pakistani scientists into weapon-grade at the New Labs. The test yield of a nuclear devices was reported to be 12‚Äì40 kt.  Charged Particle Accelerator  In early 1983, Pakistani nuclear physicist dr. Samar Mubarakmand developed and established a neutron particle and nuclear accelerator to conduct the research of explosions of nuclear elements and isotopes in a nuclear device. Known as a Charged Particle Accelerator (CPA), the nuclear accelerator is a 250 keV Ion accelerator which can deliver all Gaseous ions such as +H, +N, +O, +He, +Ne, +Ar, +Kr, +Xe or molecular ions. The accelerator's energy range is highly flexible and ions between 50 and 250 keV can be delivered to a target of dimensions ranging from few mm to many cm. The particle facility is designed to implantation of 42+Mo,51+Sn, and46+Pb ions into steel, friction can be reduced by up to ~50%. During the process of ion implantation, the oxidation is inhibited by suitable ions such as 5+B,20+Ca into metals. The PINSTECH accelerator can be used by mutual arrangement between PINSTECH and industry or any other organisations.  Fast- Neutron Generator  In 1961, the United States Government led the establishment of ICF-based Fusion power experimental source near at Nilore, before the establishment of PINSTECH Institute. The neutron generator was bought by the PAEC from Texas A&M; Nuclear Science Center. The facility is capable of producing mono-energetic neutrons at 3.5‚Äì14.7MeV from deuterium- tritium reaction generated by the Fusion power. This fusion experimental devices has capability to capture the low neutron flux on the order of 105 to 108 neutrons per cm2 per second, resulting in nucleosynthesis by the s-process (slow-neutron-capture-process). It is designed and planned to do fast neutron activation for elements such as oxygen and nitrogen as well as some rare earth isotopes.

On 15 October 1789, he was promoted again, to general of infantry, or Feldzeugmeister, and appointed as Commanding General in Transylvania, in the so-called Siebenb√ºrgen. French Revolutionary Wars In 1792, he was initially placed in command of the 50,000 Austrian forces in the Upper Rhine Valley. In August, his forces crossed the Rhine by Mannheim, and participated in the bombardment of Thionville, on the Moselle, in early September. Although the invading forces of the allies readily captured Longwy on 23 August and slowly marched on to Verdun, which was even less defensible than Longwy. The Duke of Brunswick now began his march on Paris and approached the defiles of the Argonne. In combination with the Army of Cond√© and Hessian troops, a portion of his force, 15,000, covered the left (southern) flank of the Prussian advance on Valmy.

Speculative Fiction Group (SFG) is composed of a group of writers, researchers, translators and fans of science-fiction, fantasy, horror fiction, and detective literary genres. The group is the governing body of the Persian Speculative Fiction Art and Literature Award, Shegetzar online magazine, Persian Speculative Encyclopedia, and Persian SF&F; Fanzine. The group has an English portal for its main site and has established a MediaWiki-based encyclopedia of science fiction and fantasy. History SFG started as a fanzine club named Zirabious in early 2004, and in 2005, after renaming itself to Fantasy Academy, changed its approach to a more academic path and became the sole reference for Persian speculative fiction, specially science fiction, since there was no group or organization working in this area. In 2010, the group reformed again to separate the fan base from academic activities, and all fan activities moved to a new website called Fanzine (Persian: ŸÅŸÜÿ≤€åŸÜ). Officially established in 2004, the group was founded on an earlier local private group called Seventh Dimension. Fantasy Academy has developed in several aspects. Primarily, the main focus of the group was to introduce and localize the two main subgenres of speculative fiction: fantasy and science fiction. However, other subgenres, including horror fiction, have since been added. Group structure SFG is a combination of several subgroups, each of them devoted to specific activities. All groups work independently in their area. thumb|right|Persian Fantasy Academy meeting bench at Laleh Park Main aim The official aim of the group is to maintain effective support to the speculative genre developed and published in the Persian language.

It is the story of Anna Solden, a visually impaired child who moves from Germany to Canada with her family, on the eve of Hitler's rise to power in Germany. The book is one of Jean Little's most popular works. Characters * Anna Elisabeth Solden ‚ÄìThe title character. The youngest of five siblings and always the odd one out, Anna feels misunderstood by her family. While her siblings are beautiful and athletic, she is slow and clumsy. She bumps into things, cannot sew or dust, and earns the nickname \\"Awkward Anna\\" from her siblings. * Ernst Solden, \\"Papa\\" ‚Äì Anna's father, who works as an English teacher at a private school in Frankfurt. Loves all his children, but has a special place in his heart for Anna, called \\"Papa's Pet\\" by the other children. He distrusts the new regime in Germany and seeks to take his family to a place where his children can grow up with free thoughts. * Klara Solden, \\"Mama\\" ‚Äì Anna's mother. Unable to understand Anna's inability to do what she sees as simple and basic tasks, she frequently becomes exasperated with her youngest daughter. When one of her children has done something extra special, she calls them \\"The Dearest Child\\", a practice which irritates Anna, as she never seems to earn the title the same way her siblings do. Her mother never seems to see what her daughter does to please her. * Rudolf \\"Rudi\\" Solden ‚Äì The eldest child. He is often mean to Anna, teasing her. While reading through an English dictionary he comes up with the nickname \\"Awkward Anna\\". * Gretchen \\"Gretel\\" Solden ‚Äì Second child, her mother's helper, she is often exasperated with her sister's inability to do the chores she has been doing for years. * Fritz and Elfrieda \\"Frieda\\" Solden ‚Äì The twins. Younger than Rudi and Gretchen, they are nevertheless included in their older siblings' games. * Dr. Schumacher ‚Äì Friend of the late Uncle Karl. He examines the children when they come to Canada, discovers Anna's inability to see, and becomes one of Anna's staunchest allies. * Miss Williams ‚Äì Anna's first teacher in Canada. She sees something special in Anna. Plot summary In the mid 1930s in Germany, things are changing, people are moving away or disappearing. The new headmaster at the Solden's school forbids the singing of a song titled \\"My thoughts are free\\" (Die Gedanken sind frei) during an assembly, instead making the school sing the national anthem. Anna's father, disturbed by the changes in his country, promises Anna that she will be able to grow up in a place where her thoughts are free. When his brother Karl in Canada dies, leaving him his shop and the home he had purchased there, Ernst sees an opportunity to move to Canada. He announces to his family that they will be moving to Canada. The rest of the family comes on board slowly, but Anna, terrified, resists. In Germany she is nearly failing school, how will she manage in a new country and a new language? When they arrive in Toronto, they are greeted by a friend of their uncle's, Dr. Schumacher, who helps them move in, and gives the children check-ups before they start school. Anna is terrified to learn she will be starting school soon, but during her examination, a startling discovery is made; Anna can barely see. A prescription for glasses helps immensely; however, even with the glasses, she has less than normal vision, and is put in a special multi-grade class for students with similar vision. Her teacher here is Miss Williams. Seeing the potential in Anna she sets out to slowly coach the girl out of her shell. She gives Anna A Child's Garden of Verses, and Anna discovers a love of reading. Her English improves with leaps and bounds, and soon she speaks only English at school and with the friends she has found there. However, she continues to present her old prickly side to her family, remembering all the years when they didn't understand her. As the Soldens' first Christmas in Canada approaches, the children are becoming more and more aware of the effects of the depression on their lives. Instead of keeping with tradition in getting money from their parents to buy presents, the older children decide to come up with presents for their parents themselves. They struggle to include Anna, but in the end, decide she is \\"only a kid\\" and that their parents will not expect anything from her. Anna is hurt and infuriated by this, and she cannot keep her mood from her classmates the next day. When she describes her problem to Miss Williams, a flood of similar stories comes from her classmates. They all express a desire to give their parents a present that truly shows how much they are capable of. Miss Williams returns the next day with a plan. With money for supplies provided by herself and Dr. Schumacher, the children are going to weave wastepaper baskets. Some children are dubious, but Anna takes to it right away, weaving a beautiful basket. On Christmas Eve, after her siblings have presented their gifts for Mama and Papa, Anna brings hers out. Her parents are amazed and her siblings surprised, wondering how she could have made something so beautiful. Miss Williams and Dr. Schumacher, invited by Anna to share in the family's celebrations, arrive. The novel closes with the whole group singing \\"Silent Night\\", the children in English, and the adults (minus Miss Williams) in German. References Little, Jean. From Anna. Harper Collins.

During his tenure he interviewed presidents Bill Clinton, Jacques Chirac, Francois Hollande, Kersti Kaljulaid and Ilham Aliyev; German chancellor Angela Merkel; US Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice; Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan and many other prominent political leaders. From 2002 until 2010 Venediktov also served as president of Echo TV Russia. On December 6, 1994 Venediktov traveled to Grozny as a correspondent for Echo to cover talks between Dzhokhar Dudayev and Russian parliamentarians who came to rescue Russian officers captured during an unsuccessful tank assault on Grozny. The meeting didn't happen, as Dudayev left to meet with general Pavel Grachev. The parliamentarians tried to persuade the captured officers to go home with them, but they were afraid, likely threatened that they'd be killed if they agreed. Venediktov took out a tape recorder and told the officers to say on record that they won't go anywhere, so that their families could know. The meeting was immediately stopped, and Dudaev's guards escorted him outside, made him face the wall and staged a mock execution. Ten minutes of clicking the bolts, and Venediktov was brought back. The delegation was allowed to take 7 out of 14 prisoners back to Moscow. In 2006 he co-hosted a short-lived TV show In the Circle of Light with Svetlana Sorokina at Domashny TV channel.

But in 2015 the Russian State Duma passed a new law forbidding foreign citizens from owning more than 20% of all shares in a national media company. In order to bypass it, a Russian-based company named Echo of Moscow Holding Company was registered. As of 2016, it owned 13.10% of total shares (49.5% of them belonged to Venediktov alone), while the American company controlled 19.92% of shares.

He was executed in 196 BC at Alexandria for conspiring to seize the power of the realm for himself. Service in the Social War At the period of the outbreak of the Social War (220‚Äì217 BC), he held a leading position among his countrymen. He was a kinsman of Ariston, who at this time held the office of strategos in the Aetolian League, and the latter confided to him the chief conduct of affairs. On this account it was to Scopas that Dorimachus applied for assistance after the ill success of his predatory expedition against Messenia, and although no pretext had been given for involving the Aetolians in war, these two generals were bold enough to undertake the enterprise on their own account. Accordingly, in the spring of 220 BC they led an expedition against the Messenians, and not only ravaged the territories of the latter, but when Aratus himself at the head of the Achaean army had come to their support, totally defeated him at Caphyae and effected their retreat unmolested (Polybius IV. 5, 6, 9, 10‚Äî13.) This daring outrage having naturally led to a public declaration of war by the Achaean League and their ally Philip V of Macedon against the Aetolians, the latter chose Scopas for their strategos during the ensuing year, and entrusted to him the conduct of the war which he had himself brought upon them. In the spring of 219 he invaded Macedonia with a large force, laid waste the open country of Pieria without opposition, and having made himself master of Dion, not only destroyed the town, but even plundered and burnt the celebrated temple which gave name to the city. Meanwhile, however, he neglected the defence of Aetolia itself, leaving it open to Philip to obtain important advantages on the side of Acarnanians (Polybius IV. 27, 62; V.11). The next year (218 BC) he was sent by Dorimachus (who had succeeded him in the supreme command) with a mercenary force to the assistance of the Eleans (Polybius, IV.3), but we have no farther account of his operations in that year, or for the remainder of the Social War. His name does not again occur until the year 211 BC, when we find him again holding the office of general, and in that capacity presiding in the assembly of the Aetolians, which concluded the alliance with the Roman praetor, Marcus Valerius Laevinus. The conquest of Acarnania was the bait held out to allure the Aetolians into this league, and Scopas immediately assembled his forces for the invasion of that country. But the determined resistance of the Acarnanians themselves, and the advance of Philip to their relief, rendered his efforts null. The next year (210 BC) we find him co-operating with Laevinus in the siege of Anticyra in Phocis. After its capture, the city was given up to the Aetolians (Livy, XXVI.24‚Äî26). Service in Egypt After the end of the war with Philip, we are told that the Aetolians were distracted with civil dissensions, and in order to appease these disorders and so as to provide some remedy against the burden of debts with which the chief persons in the country were oppressed, Scopas and Dorimachus were appointed to reform the constitution, in 204 BC. They were certainly not well qualified for legislators, and Scopas had only undertaken the charge from motives of personal ambition; on finding himself disappointed, he withdrew to Alexandria. Here he was received with the utmost favour by the ministers who ruled during the minority of the young Ptolemy V Epiphanes, and appointed to the chief command of the army in Coele-Syria, where he had to make head against the ambitious designs of Antiochus the Great. At first he was completely successful, and reduced the whole province of Judaea into subjection to Ptolemy, but was afterwards defeated by Antiochus at the battle of Panium. Shutting himself up within the walls of Sidon, after an ineffectual attempt by Ptolemy to relieve him he was ultimately compelled by famine to surrender (Polybius XIII.1-2, XVI.18-19, 39; Josephus, Antiguities XII.3.3; St. Jerome, ad Daniel, XI.15-16). Notwithstanding this ill success he appears to have continued in high favour at the Ptolemaic court, and in 200 BC he was sent to Greece with a large sum of money to raise a mercenary force for the service of Ptolemy, a task which he performed so successfully as to carry back with him to Alexandria a body of above 6000 of the flower of the Aetolian youth (Livy XXXI.43). His confidence in the support of so large a force, united to his own abilities, and the vast wealth which he had accumulated in the service of the Egyptian king, appears to have inflamed his ambition, and led him to conceive the design of seizing by force on the chief administration of the kingdom. But his projects were discovered before they were ripe for execution, and a force was sent by Aristomenes, the chief minister of Ptolemy, to arrest him. Scopas was taken by surprise, and unable to offer any resistance. He was at once led before the council of the young king, condemned to death, and executed in prison the next night, in 196 BC. According to Polybius he had well deserved his fate by the reckless and insatiable rapacity which he had displayed during the whole period of his residence in Egypt.

However, Wheeler's cavalry was moved to a position between Bell's Ferry and Canton Road.Cracker cavaliers: the 2nd Georgia cavalry under Wheeler and Forrest On June 10, the 17th Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry pushed the enemy across Noonday Creek after heavy fighting.Seventeenth Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment On June 15, a division of Union Cavalry attacked and was repelled. On June 17, the Federals pushed Wheeler down Bell's Ferry Road, where he retired to Robert McAffee's house located at the intersection of today‚Äôs Barret Parkway and Bells Ferry Roads. This location is often confused with the house of Doctor John McAfee, which was located at the intersection of the Canton and Marietta Road, and the Old Alabama Road in Woodstock. On June 10 Colonel Minty‚Äôs First Cavalry Brigade(U.S.) consisting of the 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry, the 4th Michigan Cavalry, the 4th U.S. Cavalry, and a battery of the Chicago Board of Trade Artillery crossed Noonday Creek on the Old Alabama Road, and proceeded to McAfee‚Äôs Crossroads, where Doctor McAfee‚Äôs Home was located. Upon approaching the Crossroads the 7th Pennsylvania became heavily engaged, but drove in the Rebel pickets, and occupied the Crossroads. While Minty was deploying his line he was attacked by a brigade of Martin‚Äôs, and the entire Division of Ferguson‚Äôs cavalry. After fighting for about an hour the 7th Pennsylvania made a saber charge, and drove the Confederates south on the Canton and Marietta Road for a mile, until they entrenched on the crest of a hill. After an unsuccessful assault on that position, Minty withdrew back across Noonday Creek on the Old Alabama Road. Minty‚Äôs Brigade remained in position near McAfee‚Äôs Crossroads skirmishing daily with Wheeler‚Äôs Confederate Cavalry until June 20. On June 19, the Union Army attacked but was driven off with heavy losses.Cracker cavaliers: the 2nd Georgia cavalry under Wheeler and Forrest On June 23, Colonel Eli Long, USA, crossed Noonday Creek with his brigade.

A group of 320 passengers were on board a train of mixed Cambrian Railways (CR) and Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) stock of 15 carriages, pulled by two locomotives. Earlier in the day a CR guard had complained of the rough-riding of a small 4-wheeled L&YR; brake van, which on the return journey was at the front of the train. The train left at 18:00. At about 22:20 one of the engines and 13 of the coaches left the rails of the CR's Oswestry, Ellesmere and Whitchurch Railway, east of Welshampton station. Nine passengers were killed in what was the first fatal accident on the line since it was built, two other passengers and a railway employee died later from injuries. Although the initial investigation centred on the first carriage to leave the rails, an L&YR; third-class brake coach, the enquiry concluded though that the speed of the train was too high considering the state of the track which had many sleepers in need of replacement, also too light a rail for high speed running. The CR disputed the findings and maintained that the L&Y; vehicle was to blame. A memorial on the front of the Town Hall in Royton, Greater Manchester names, those killed in the accident.

In 2000, North America's first hybrid taxi was put into service in Vancouver, British Columbia, operating a 2001 Toyota Prius which traveled over before being retired. In 2015, taxi driver in Austria claims to have covered in his Toyota Prius with the original battery pack. Several major cities in the world are adding hybrid taxis to their taxicab fleets, led by San Francisco where hybrid represent almost 50% of its taxicab fleet by March 2010, and New York City where hybrids taxis represent 45% of the city's total fleet by September 2012. Unlike conventional gasoline cars, hybrids get better fuel economy, do well at slow speeds or idling, and have cleaner emissions. Hybrid taxis by city Arlington, Virginia hybrid taxis at Arlington, Virginia from several taxi cab companies. The Arlington County Board authorized in September 2007 a new taxi company, EnviroCAB, to operate with an all-hybrid fleet of 50 vehicles. In addition, the Board authorized existing companies permission to add 35 hybrid taxis. The introduction of green taxis is part of a county campaign known as Fresh AIRE, or Arlington Initiative to Reduce Emissions. AIRE aims to cut production of greenhouse gases from county buildings and vehicles by 10% by 2012. The hybrid taxis began operating in February 2008, allowing EnviroCAB to become the first all-hybrid taxicab fleet in the United States. EnviroCAB fleet consist of Toyota Priuses, Toyota Camry Hybrids, Toyota Highlander Hybrids, and Ford Escape Hybrids. The company claims to be the first carbon-negative taxicab company in the world, as it will completely offset its own emissions by purchasing \\"clean-source\\" offset credits. Also, EnviroCAB expects to offset the emissions of 100 of the approximately 685 non- hybrid taxis operating in Arlington by March 2008. Boston, Massachusetts Several CleanAir Cabs program hybrid taxis in Boston. Program participants are identified by the green strip livery toward the back of the vehicle The city of Boston launched the CleanAir Cabs program in April 2007. The program promotes replacing older fuel-inefficient cabs with hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles as the existing fleet ages out. The main benefit of the CleanAir Cabs program for cab drivers is the operating savings, as hybrid taxi cabs can get up to three times as many miles per gallon of fuel as the old Crown Victoria cabs. In addition, hybrid taxi drivers get two \\"front of the line\\" passes per shift at Logan Airport, allowing them to make two extra trips daily. Hybrid taxi owners who lease vehicles to drivers are allowed to charge drivers more per shift to lease a taxi, enabling medallion owners to earn more than annually. By early 2009 this voluntary program had translated into about 50 hybrid operating on Boston's streets. In August 2008 Boston mandated that all its 1,825 taxi fleet must be converted to hybrids by 2015. As of March 2009 about 10% of the taxicab fleet were already hybrids as owner voluntarily began introducing HEVs since 2002, mainly Toyota Camry Hybrids plus those introduced by the incentives of the CleanAir Cabs. However, in March 2009 a group of taxi drivers and medallion owners sued in federal court the City of Boston to block the requirement and requested the city to delay the changeover for two or three years. They also complained that the new rule is unreasonable because it forbids taxi owners from buying used hybrids. In July 2009 a federal judge granted the request for a temporary injunction and ordered the city to stop enforcing the rule requiring medallion owners to buy new hybrid cars by 2015. Among others, the taxi owners argued that the requirements infringe on federal authority to set fuel-economy and emissions standards, an argument successfully used by New York cab owners to block a similar requirement. In April 2012, the City of Boston awarded the Boston Cab Association with the 2012 Green Business Award for its fleet conversion to hybrid vehicles. Boston Cab has more than 400 hybrid taxis out of its 500 vehicle fleet, and has plans to convert the entire fleet. Cambridge, Massachusetts Cambridge's Clear Air Cab hybrid taxis display a green livery to identify the vehicles participating in the program. In April 2008, the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, in partnership with Whole Foods Market, began its Clear Air Cab program to promote the introduction of hybrid taxis with the objective to reduce the environmental impact of the city's taxicabs by encouraging a switch to hybrid vehicles. Whole Foods made a gift to sponsor the purchase of first six new Toyota Camry Hybrid taxis. In exchange, the company obtained exclusive three-year rights to display advertisements on these taxis. The city of Cambridge provided an additional grant per vehicle, using funds from the auction of two taxi medallions. As of March 2009, the program resulted in 15 hybrid taxis operating in the city. Whole Foods is no longer providing grants but the city continues to do so. The taxis participating in the Clean Air Cab program display a distinctive green stripe According to the Cambridge License Commission (CLC), and based on a study conducted by John Moore, along with Boston Cab and the Boston Public Health Commission, the average Cambridge cab driver travels about per shift. Assuming a gasoline price of per gallon ($0.79 per liter), the cab drivers would save an average of $18 to $21 per shift. During an average shift a Cambridge hybrid taxi will use between three and four gallons of gasoline as opposed to 10 gallons or more burnt by an outdated Crown Victoria taxicab. Chicago, Illinois Chicago has a fleet of 6,700 to 6,800 active taxicabs on any given day. In 2011, green taxis were added to the fleet as a result of the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection's Green Taxi Program. As part of Mayor Rahm Emanuel action agenda ‚ÄúSustainable Chicago 2015,‚Äù the city has the goal to achieve a taxi fleet which is 75% to 80% hybrid or compressed natural gas vehicles. , Chicago's fleet was 40% green, including hybrid and natural gas vehicles. As part of a 12-month pilot program to encourage alternative-fuel vehicle use, green taxis move to the front of the passenger line at Chicago's airports. A new rate structure was introduced in 2012 to encourage fleet owners to buy more fuel efficient taxis. pp. 18-19 Hamburg, Germany In November 2008 Hamburg became the first city in Germany to deploy a fleet of 130 environmentally friendly taxis that run on a hybrid electric or natural gas motor. Under the program, taxicabs that meet the low-emissions standards are allowed to be branded with an \\"Eco Taxis\\" logo. Tehran, Iran IranPakroTaxi From 2016 through the Pakro Company the first Iran‚Äôs Hybrid Taxicabs were added to the countries taxi system, they started first to work in the Capital Tehran and after they spread to other big cities like Tabriz and Mashhad . The person who choose to drive with a Hybrid Taxi in Iran is not only doing something good for the environment, but also something good for itself because in the quiet Car till Destination they offer free Wi-Fi for the passengers. The three most common Hybrid Taxicabs in Iran are Toyota Camry, Toyota Prius and Hyundai Sonata. London, England The first hybrid taxicab in London entered operations in 2004. It was a diesel- electric hybrid black cab. The hybrid taxicab was developed by engine designer Azure Dynamics and London Taxis International with support from the Energy Saving Trust and the Department for Transport. The LEVC TX black taxi manufactured by the London EV Company commenced service on the streets of London in 2018. It is a plug-in hybrid range-extender electric vehicle designed to comply with new regulations, which ban new diesel engined taxis and require a zero-emissions capability.https://arstechnica.co.uk/cars/2017/03/electric-tx5-black-cabs- start-rolling-off-the-production-line/http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car- news/98450/new-tx-electric-london-taxi-priced-at-55599 New York City, New York The City Council passed a bill in 2003 requiring the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission to set aside a proportion of new taxi medallions to be granted to vehicles that use cleaner fuels. The Commission cleared the first six hybrid models to be used as taxicabs by mid-2005 as there were concerns about which hybrids on the market had enough leg room. The models authorized were the Ford Escape Hybrid, Toyota Highlander Hybrid, Lexus RX 400h, Toyota Prius, Honda Accord Hybrid, and Honda Civic Hybrid. The first 27 hybrid taxis entered service in November 2005. As an incentive for fleet owners to buy hybrids, the Commission auctioned in 2004 the first taxi medallions for hybrids at discounted price of around US$170,000 less than the regular medallion price of US$400,000. In 2006 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced that 254 of the 308 medallions to be auctioned by mid-2006 would be designated for hybrid and alternative-fuel cabs. The remaining 54 were for handicapped-accessible taxis. Ford C-Max Hybrid taxi in New York City As integral part of the 2007 PlaNYC, Mayor Bloomberg set the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030. For this purpose, its component GreeNYC plan established that all new taxi vehicles entering the fleet beginning in October 2008 should have a fuel economy of , rising to for cars entering the fleet in October 2009. Since hybrid cars were at that time the only vehicles that could meet those fuel standards, it was expected that most of New York's 13,000 taxis would be hybrids by 2012. Toyota Camry Hybrid taxi in New York City In September 2008 a group of taxi operators sued the city under the allegation that hybrids are not suitable for city taxis and partly based on a report that claimed that \\"hybrids could not handle 24-hour operation and that air bags might not deploy in taxis that have safety partitions between the driver and passengers.\\" In October 2008 a federal judge blocked New York City from implementing the fuel economy requirement. The ruling established that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their key legal argument, \\"that the new regulations were pre-empted under federal law, which reserve regulation of fuel economy and emissions standards to federal agencies.\\" At the time of the ruling NYC already had nearly 1,500 hybrids as a result of voluntary efforts, and only a fraction as a result of the medallion incentives. Ford Escape Hybrid taxi in New York City. In March 2009 the Bloomberg administration attempted a different policy for replacing the taxicab fleet with hybrid or other low-emission vehicles. The Taxi and Limousine Commission enacted a set of incentives to allow taxi fleet owners to charge drivers more to drive hybrid or clean diesel cabs, and penalize fleet owners by lowering the amount they could charge to lease cabs that use more fuel and pollute more. The city argued that drivers would not be hurt by the higher hybrid leasing fees because those cars use less gasoline. This approach was also blocked after some taxi groups sued and obtained a preliminary court injunction. In July 2010 the city's appeal was rejected by a federal appeals court. The court upheld the initial ruling on the grounds that \\"the city's rules amounted to an effort to mandate fuel economy and emissions standards, something that only the federal government is allowed to do.\\" On February 28, 2011, the United States Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal by the city. As of mid-2009 New York City had reached 2,019 hybrid taxis and 12 clean diesel vehicles, representing 15% of New York's 13,237 taxis in service, the most in any city in North America, and by this time owners began retiring its original hybrid fleet after per vehicle. The Taxi and Limousine Commission's list of 12 vehicle models that can be used as yellow taxis includes nine models are hybrids. As of July 2011, New York City had 4,980 hybrid taxis, representing almost 38% of the city's overall fleet, and about 6,000 by September 2012, representing 45% of the taxis in service. The deployment of the city's Taxi of Tomorrow, scheduled to begin in 2013, would result in almost all the existing fleet to be replaced within 3 years with the non hybrid Nissan NV200 passenger van. Only about 1,000 taxis will not be phase out and exempted for various reasons, such as 273 taxis whose medallions require that they be high-mileage vehicles. However, in early 2013 the Greater New York Taxi Association filed suit against the city arguing that the Taxi of Tomorrow plan violates a section of the city's administrative code because the Nissan NV200 is not a hybrid. In May 2013 a State Supreme Court judge blocked the Bloomberg administration's plan for introducing the Taxi of Tomorrow, ruling that it violated a New York City provision requiring a hybrid option for taxi operators. City officials did not challenge the judge's ruling. In June 2013, the Taxi and Limousine Commission on Thursday approved an adjusted set of rules in an effort to introduce the Taxi of Tomorrow as scheduled by October 2013. According to the adjusted rules, only hybrids with a large interior, at least , will be permitted. Taxi operators complained that the only compliant hybrids are prohibitively expensive. A spokesman for the commission noted that the Prius V is available for , about less than the NV200. Two other hybrids comply with the rule are the Lexus RX 450h () and the Toyota Highlander Hybrid (). Paris, France Hybrid taxi from G7 Green Cab in Paris The taxi company Verture began operations in Paris in September 2007 with a hybrid only fleet made of Toyota Prius. The company Taxis G7 introduced in October 2007 its first hybrid taxis in Paris, and by early 2012 G7 had 500 hybrid taxis in operation in the city. Taxis Bleus introduced 30 hybrid taxis in September 2008. Phoenix, Arizona Phoenix's Clean Air Cab that donated part of the fares to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure between 2009 and 2010. In October 2009, a fleet of 26 Toyota Prius began operating in Phoenix, Arizona, becoming the country's second all-hybrid taxicab fleet after Arlington, Virginia. The new company, Clean Air Cab, plans to expand its fleet to more than 200 hybrids. Clean Air Cab claims to be a carbon-neutral taxi service. In addition to lowering emissions with its hybrid fleet, the company purchases carbon offsets and supports global reforestation by subsidizing the planting of 10 Brazilian rainforest trees monthly for each cab in service. San Antonio, Texas Through an ordinance, the city of San Antonio, Texas introduced a voluntary program in 2007 that allows taxi owners to swap the permit of one non-hybrid car for two permits valid only for hybrid electric vehicles. To prevent one fleet from obtaining all the permits, the largest company is allowed to replace only 1% of its fleet each year (six vehicles), while smaller companies can replace up to two vehicles. The statewide Texas Green & Go Clean Taxi Partnership was built based on the San Antonio program's success. As of July 2010, more than 100 of the city's 843 taxis were hybrids. San Francisco, California Ford Escape Hybrid taxi in San Francisco. San Francisco became in 2005 one of the first cities to introduce hybrids for taxi service, with a fleet of 15 Ford Escape Hybrids, and by 2009 the original Escape Hybrids were retired after per vehicle. In 2007 the city approved the Clean Air Taxi Grant Program in order to encourage cab companies to purchase alternative fuel vehicles, by providing incentives of US$2,000 per new alternative fuel vehicle on a first-come, first-served basis. Out of a total of 1,378 taxis eligible for the incentive (96 wheelchair accessible taxi-vans are excluded) 788 are alternative fuel vehicles, representing 57% of the San Francisco's taxicab fleet by March 2010. Gasoline-electric hybrids accounted for 657 green taxis and compressed natural gas vehicles for the remaining 131. Vancouver, British Columbia Toyota Prius taxi in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Since 2007 all new taxi companies or additions to existing company fleets in British Columbia's two major urban areas must be highly energy efficient vehicles, such hybrids or high fuel economy vehicles. This policy was implemented as part of the BC government pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 33 per cent by 2020. By mid-2010 hybrid taxis accounted for nearly 50% of Vancouver's taxicab fleet. Other U.S. cities Denver and Seattle introduced their first hybrid taxis in 2007. In Southern California, the city of Burbank approved by mid-2008 a request by United Independent and City Cabs to add hybrids to their fleets, and as of May 2009 hybrids represent 20% of the city's 120 taxi fleet. Long Beach Yellow Cab introduced its first hybrid in September 2008 and the city now has five Ford Escape Hybrids and five Toyota Prius. The first two hybrid cabs in Los Angeles were roll out in May 2009 by Bell Cab, and both are Toyota Prius, out of a citywide fleet of 2,303 taxicabs. As a result of the legal difficulties faced by several cities to implement policies to replace existing taxi fleets with hybrids and other clean fuel vehicles, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Jerrold Nadler, both from New York, introduced the Green Taxis Act in September 2009. The proposed Green Taxi Act would modified federal law to allow local governments to improve the emission control and fuel economy standards of their taxi cabs. Senator Gillibran is planning to reintroduce the legislation in 2011. Other cities around the world Toyota Camry Hybrid in Perth, Australia Calgary introduced its first hybrid taxis in 2006 and the city's had 50 hybrid taxicabs by August 2010 roll out by Checker Yellow Cabs, Associated Cabs, and Mayfair Taxi. Other cities where taxi service is available with hybrid vehicles include Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, Rome, Madrid, Barcelona and Singapore. Seoul introduced the first LPI hybrid taxi in December 2009. The internal combustion engine runs on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a fuel. Between 2012 and 2013, the city of S√£o Paulo, Brazil, put in operation 20 Toyota Prius as part of a demonstration program, together with 10 Nissan Leafs. In Newcastle, England, Phoenix Taxis introduced Toyota Prius hybrids to its fleet in 2009, and began using Nissan LEAFs thereafter, with a stated aim to have 50 LEAFs operating as taxis by 2016.

La Audiencia de Quito: aspectos econ√≥micos y sociales (siglos XVI-XVIII). Editorial Abya Yala (1998). , Such was the prestige of the movement even in Europe that it was said that King Carlos III of Spain (1716‚Äì1788), referring to one of its sculptors in particular, opined: \\"I am not concerned that Italy has Michelangelo; in my colonies of America I have the master Caspicara\\".Rivas, Julio (2012), Un sitio llamado San Francisco; Revista Clave!, Nov-Dec issue. [No me preocupa que Italia tenga a Miguel √Ångel, en mis colonias de Am√©rica yo tengo al maestro Caspicara.] Origins The Quito School originated in the school of Artes y Oficios, founded in 1552 by the Franciscan priest Jodoco Ricke, who together with Friar Pedro Bedon transformed the San Andr√©s seminary, where the first indigenous artists were trained. As a cultural expression, it is the result of a long process of acculturation between indigenous peoples and Europeans, and it is one of the richest expressions of miscegenation (mestizaje) and of syncretism, in which the participation of the vanquished Indian is seemingly of minor importance as compared to the dominant European contribution.Ximena Escudero Albornoz and Jos√© Mar√≠a Vargas Ar√©valo. Historia y cr√≠tica del Arte Hispanoamericano, Real Audiencia de Quito: (siglos XVI, XVII y XVIII). Editorial Abya Yala (2000). , Characteristics As a product of cultural syncretism and miscegenation, the works of the Quito School are characterized by the combination and adaptation of European and Indigenous features. In its development, it reflected the styles prevailing in each period of Spain and thus contains renaissance and mannerist elements. During its height, it was eminently baroque, concluding with a short rococo period leading to an incipient neoclassicism until the transition to the republican period. The Quito School also incorporated Flemish, Italian, and Moorish influences. One of the common characteristics of the school is the technique of encarnado (\\"flesh-colored\\") ‚Äî the simulation of the color of the flesh of the (European) human body ‚Äî that makes the skin of sculptures appear more natural. Once the piece was perfectly cut and sanded, an artisan covered the wood with several layers of gesso with glue. Each layer was highly polished to achieve a perfectly smooth finish. Next, color was applied in various transparent layers, allowing an optical mix of overlapping colors. This began with the colors of shadows (blue, green, ocher), then light colors were applied (white, pink, yellow). and finally highlight colors were added (orange and red to cheeks, knees, and elbows of children; and dark blue, green, and violet for wounds and bruises of Christ or for stubble on a beardless figure). Other typical characteristics include: *Serpentine representation of the movement of bodies, especially in sculpture *Application of aguada (watercolor) on top of gold leaf or silver paint, giving a special metallic sheen The features indicating its indigenous roots include: * \\"Quite√±ization\\" of characters, with mixed traits and local costumes * Frequent appearance of ancestral indigenous customs * Location of the scenes within the Andean countryside or cities * Presence of local flora and fauna, and the substitution of local plants for traditional European iconography Notable artists Painters *Vicente Alb√°n *Friar Pedro Bed√≥n *Nicol√°s Javier Gor√≠bar *Hernando de la Cruz *Miguel de Santiago (ca. 1620s-1706) *Manuel de Samaniego *Isabel de Santiago *Friar Pedro Gosseal Sculptors *Bernardo de Legarda (ca. 1700‚Äî1 June 1773) *Manuel Chili (Caspicara) *Miguel Angel Tejada Zambrano *Mar√≠a Estefan√≠a D√°valos y Maldonado References See also *Virgin of Quito *Baroque External links *The colonial Andes: tapestries and silverwork, 1530-1830, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on the Quito School Category:Ecuadorian art Category:Baroque painting Category:Rococo art Category:Spanish art Category:Spanish Baroque Category:Viceroyalty of Peru ","title":"Quito School"},{"id":"24753144","text":"The Old Statehouse Historic District is an area in downtown Frankfort, Kentucky near the old State Capitol and the Old Governors Mansion.

She was born into slavery in Fort Valley, Georgia and moved New York City with her family after emancipation. There, she briefly attended school and worked as a domestic servant to help her family. As a married woman, Matthews became involved in women's clubs and social work, at a time when the settlement movement started in Great Britain in 1884 was influencing American social work in major cities. In 1897, Matthews founded the White Rose Industrial Home for Working Class Negro Girls, also known as the White Rose Mission, a settlement house for young Black Women, to provide them with safe housing, education, and life and job skills. Early life and education Victoria Earle was born into slavery in 1861 in Fort Valley, GeorgiaBrown, 1988, a month before the start of the Civil War. Shortly after she was born, her mother, Caroline Smith, escaped from their master, leaving behind Victoria and her eight siblings. The Smith family‚Äôs racial ambiguity, and the fact that the children lived in the master's house, conforms to the belief that their owner was their father. When her mother reached New York, she planned to earn enough money to purchase her freedom and that of her children. In 1869,Caroline Smith \\"reportedly was forced to wage a legal battle to regain custody of her two daughters\\" and she was the first black woman to be recognized in Georgia's court system. Matthews, her mother, and her sister, Anna, traveled from Georgia to Richmond and Norfolk, Virginia, and eventually, ended up in New York City in 1873. In New York, Matthews attended public school for only four years, until family difficulties forced Matthews to withdraw from public school and work as a domestic servant, where she took advantage of her employer‚Äôs full home library. The owner discovered Earle reading and gave her permission to do so when she had time. In order to read and learn, Earle worked harder to finish tasks early. Brown (1988) describes the young Victoria Earle as ‚Äúgentle, respectful to elders, affectionate and most helpful to all who seemed to need her services.‚Äù (p. 208). Marriage and family In New York City, On October 22, 1879,Marriage License no. 156232 for New York County, Municipal Archives of the City of New York, 32 Chambers street, New York City at the age of eighteen, Victoria Smith married William E. Matthews, a coachman from Petersburg, Virginia. They had one son, Lamartine, who died on September 19, 1895 \\"Race Gleanings,\\" Indianapolis Freeman October 10, 1895at the age of sixteen. Journalism Matthews started writing and working to establish a career as a journalist and fiction writer. Simultaneously, she became increasingly interested in politics and issues affecting blacks, such as lynchings and barriers to education. She focused on promoting a consciousness of the Black struggle, specifically Black Women. She wrote short stories, such as \\"Aunt Lindy,\\" \\"Eugenie's Mistake: A Story,\\" and ‚ÄúZelika‚ÄîA Story.\\" All of these works feature benevolent, black, female protagonists that represent the conflicts of colorism and learn to develop dignity in their blackness. \\"Aunt Lindy\\" told of forgiveness and reconciliation during the Post-Civil War years. She also produced a stage play that explored the idea of miscegenation.Kramer, 2006 Political activism Matthews featured in The Woman's Era, a newspaper edited by Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, May 1, 1894 In the early 1890s, Matthews became more involved in the African-American political and social circles. On October 5, 1892, Victoria Earle Matthews and educator and activist, Maritcha Remond Lyons, organized a testimonial dinner in New York‚Äôs Lyric Hall for Ida B. Wells and her anti-lynching campaign which led to the founding of the Woman‚Äôs Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn. It was a time of the rise of fraternal and women's organizations, and Matthews served as the first president of the Woman's Loyal Union (WLU) and .Lerner, 1974 The WLU was a civil rights organization that worked against racial discrimination and supported the anti- lynching crusade of the journalist Ida B. Wells . Matthews served as the Chairman of the Executive Board in 1896 of the National Association of Colored Women. She frequently spoke on the issues of the times. Matthews was best known for her speeches ‚ÄúThe Value of Race Literature,\\" ‚ÄúThe Role of Afro- American Women,‚Äù and \\"The Awakening of the Afro-American Woman\\" (1897). \\"The Value of Race Literature was delivered at the First National Congress of Colored Women in Boston, Massachusetts on July 30th, 1895. Her speeches were rooted in the philosophy of race pride and self-worth. After the death of her 16-year-old son, Lamartine, Matthews channeled her grief and began to concentrate on helping young people of his age. She returned to the South, having read about the continuing need for education for blacks. In the state of Alabama, she began looking into what was being done for people of color. Eventually, she became involved in settlement work, started by Progressive women in industrial cities such as Chicago and New York, which were accepting tens of thousands of European immigrants, as well as many migrants from the rural South. A minister persuaded her to return to New York. Matthews began to visit individuals and families where the need seemed great. She went from house to house providing practical services, such as helping an over-burdened mother prepare a meal, or do laundry. Kramer (2006) quoted her as saying, ‚Äúyou cannot do anything with these people unless you talk plainly to them and are practical.‚Äù (p. 249). Matthews learned that life for African Americans was difficult and plagued with ‚Äúlimited economic opportunities, inadequate housing, poverty, prejudice, and racially motivated violence.‚ÄùKramer, 2006, p. 246 At this time, thousands of young blacks were arriving in New York as part of the Great Migration, in hopes of finding better work and opportunities than in the Jim Crow South. Matthews thought that young women needed a safe place to stay while they learned job skills to allow them to work. Of mixed race, she had considerable European heritage; her fair skin and appearance, combined with her education, this enabled her to gain preferential treatment. She investigated business practices among both whites and blacks during this time period. With the initial help of Winthrop Phelps, a white philanthropist who offered a flat in an apartment house he owned, on February 11, 1897, they opened a place where colored girls could go for training in domestic work. Matthews arranged for them to learn to sew, to make dresses and to prepare for service in society. According to Kramer (2006), Matthews also ‚Äúenvisioned daily kindergarten and manual training for boys with lectures in regard to domestic services‚Äù (p. 248). Matthews valued education and made it part of the programs she offered. Kramer (2006) wrote the ‚ÄúWhite Rose Mission stressed the training of African American girls in the principles of practical self-help and right-living.‚Äù (p. 248). In addition to life skills in math, reading and writing, Matthews educated her students in race history and literature. She maintained a collection of books on black history that was an available resource to all. Realizing that young women were at risk when they arrived in the city, Matthews and her supporters decided to set up a place that would offer housing, as well as to have volunteers meet new migrants at train stations, to offer their safe housing. They purchased a house on 217 East 86th street, which was called the White Rose Home for Working Class Negro Girls, or the White Rose Mission. Matthews encouraged the girls to live with purity, goodness and virtue. To support the mission, she gained the support of prominent black ministers and major congregations, such as Adam Clayton Powell, Sr., pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, who became a trustee of the mission.Mather, Frank Lincoln. Who's Who of the Colored Race: A General Biographical Dictionary of Men and Women of African Descent, Vol. 1, Chicago: Memento Edition, 1915, p. 222 Matthews took pride in her race; she also sought to inspire individuals by equipping them with practical skills. She believed that with self-sufficiency, they could have noble thoughts, and great ideas. Matthews and her volunteers taught young women the skills needed at the time: sewing, millinery, and cooking. The young women had the chance to get decent, if low paid work. The White Rose Industrial Home allowed for students to be around their teachers, learning from them and each other in daily life, as well as to have some protection for a time. The White Rose Home also provided specific education and a range of social activities. Lerner (1974) explained how the mission offered recreation, literary and cultural events, and classes on Negro history. Settlement houses such as Matthews', and those founded by other women for immigrants in Chicago and New York, influenced the later development of YMCAs and summer camps as well.

It was produced by RAI from 1984-1987 and broadcast by Rai Uno in 1987. The series was created by Luciano Perugia, and was inspired by the Brazilian sitcom Carga Pesada (1979). Stelvio Massi directed most of the episodes, which were written by Tonino Valerii; the score was composed by Detto Mariani. Plot The plot revolves around two truckers, Franco (Renato D'Amore) and Vanni (Christian Fremon) and their rig, an Iveco 190-42 Turbostar named Gambero Rosso (Red Prawn in English). Recurring characters are Orazio (Philippe Leroy and Gi√≤ (Alba Mottura). The series featured some notable guest stars like Adolfo Celi, Giulio Scarpati and William Berger. Production Most of the scenes were shot in South Tyrol, in Sterzing and near Bolzano, but the series was one of the first produced for the Italian television to use many foreign locations, ranging from Moscow, Tunisia, Poland and Spain. Some of the car chases were staged by the famous stunt driver R√©my Julienne. The first and only season was made of two different short seasons: the first, episodes 1 to 3, was shot as a pilot, and featured a different truck (an earlier model, the Iveco 190-38 Special), later changed to the titular TurboStar for the official production. The two short seasons were later joined and sold as one. The name of the series was to be T.I.R., and was changed after the shooting of the first three episodes. (In Hungary, it remained so.) FIAT was heavily involved in the production, using the serial as a product placement for the brands of the group (mostly Iveco, Fiat Auto and Alfa Romeo). AGIP made product placement in some episodes, too. Reception The show was very well received, and a second season was in pre-production but was ultimately cancelled. Some of the episodes are now occasionally transmitted in RAI TV channels or at late night. Title The show title is based on a pun: in Italian language assi means both a couple of skilled and brave men (aces) and the axles of a vehicle. The turbo of the title is the Turbostar truck, at the time a very popular and common model made by the Italian manufacturer Iveco.

In addition to being an author on several subjects related to the history of Oklahoma, he was known as a civic leader and proponent of various municipal development projects within central Oklahoma. Early life and military experience George Shirk was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on May 1, 1913, son of John Henry Shirk and Carrie (Hinderer) Shirk. Having earned an LL.B. degree from the University of Oklahoma (OU) Law School, George Shirk passed the Oklahoma bar exam in 1936 and entered practice at his father's Oklahoma City law firm of Shirk and Danner. While attending OU he enrolled in Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) and eventually saw active duty in a field artillery command in the European theater of World War II. He attained the rank of colonel in the U.S. Army in 1945. Professional career and amateur historian After service in World War II, Shirk practiced law in Oklahoma City, in partnership with lawyers W.R. Withington and James E. Work - first in the law firm of Withington, Shirk, Nichols & Work, and later with the firm of Shirk, Withington, Work & Robinson. Lucrative financial settlements in his legal profession allowed Shirk to pursue his passion, namely writing and publishing on unique topics in Oklahoma history. In 1949, he worked on the committee that selected sites to be designated as historical markers within the state, and wrote the text for many of these markers. Shirk also wrote and published 29 articles for the Oklahoma Historical Society (OHS) from 1948‚Äì1977, focusing mostly on Oklahoma-related Civil War history and philately/postal service history. He also wrote extensively for The American Philatelist. Shirk became administratively involved with the OHS, serving as President of its board of directors from 1958 to 1975. During this tenure he was successful in obtaining matching grants for the OHS after being appointed as State Historical Preservation Officer. For his efforts, Shirk earned the nickname \\"Mr. Oklahoma History.\\" Civic leadership and mayoral tenure In 1953, Shirk joined the Committee of 100, a group of concerned citizens who advocated changes in the Oklahoma City charter. The next year, he joined the City Safety Council, which advocated better police and fire protection. He was then asked to join the Committee of 19, a group searching for a solution to the water needs of Oklahoma City. In this capacity, Shirk was a proponent of the public works project which connected Oklahoma City's water supply to Lake Atoka Reservoir in southeastern Oklahoma via Lake Stanley Draper. Shirk was appointed acting Mayor of Oklahoma City on June 16, 1964 to complete the remainder of the term of Jack S. Wilkes. Shirk was then elected to a two-year term in his own right in April 1965. In addition to completing the Lake Atoka project that he advocated in the 1950s, Shirk also obtained the adoption of a comprehensive downtown re-development plan envisioned by architect I.M. Pei in September 1965. The Pei Plan included the construction of the Myriad Botanical Gardens and the creation of parking structures in downtown Oklahoma City, at the expense of the demolition of a significant amount of older buildings in the downtown area. In 1969, Shirk and three other persons lead a small expedition to explore a section of catacombs associated with an old Chinese-American neighborhood in downtown Oklahoma City, located underneath the construction site of the Myriad Convention Center which was a part of Shirk's downtown redevelopment plan. Awards and recognition On November 14, 1976, the George H. Shirk Oklahoma History Center at Oklahoma City University was dedicated. The center houses his collection of rare books, stamps, and maps. Before his death on March 23, 1977, Shirk was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1969. He was also inducted into the Oklahoma Historians Hall of Fame. He is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Oklahoma City. Bibliography Articles               * Books  References Further reading * Meredith, Howard L. and Meredith, Mary Ellen.

frequencies (radio and microwaves). Description of the project The GEM Radio Telescope measures the radio emission of our galaxy in five frequencies, between 408 MHz and 10 GHz, from different places of the earth. This data will be used to calibrate other telescopes, more specifically the Planck Surveyor, and will give the means to filter the Cyclotron Radiation and the free free radiation from other maps in a way that the only radiation left on the map is the Cosmic Microwave Background. The telescope is in construction at Pampilhosa da Serra, Portugal,Fonseca, R. et al. Site evaluation and RFI spectrum measurements in Portugal at the frequency range 0.408‚Äì10 GHz for a GEM polarized galactic radio emission experiment. New Astronomy, 11(8):551-556, 2006. but the receptor has already made measurements in Cachoeira Paulista, (Brasil), in Ant√°rtica, in Bishop (U.S.), Villa de Leyva (Colombia) and in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The main reflector has a parabolic form of 5,5m of diameter.Tello, C. et al. Spillover and diffraction sidelobe contamination in a double-shielded experiment for mapping Galactic synchrotron emission. Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement Series, 145:495-508, 2000. The telescope was projected and is operated by an international collaboration coordinated by the University of California, Berkeley and by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, under the guidance of George Smoot, awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2006. In Brasil, the radio telescope is under the responsibility of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais ( National Institute of Space Research) and counts with the participation of the Astrophysics group of the Universidade Federal de Itajub√° (Itajub√° Federal University). Portugal joined the project in 2005 through the Instituto de Telecomunica√ß√µes of Aveiro (Telecommunications institute of Aveiro), who is responsible for the planning and construction of the radio telescope. GEM in Portugal Scanning Process In Portugal the radio telescope will perform scans by rotating on its base at a speed greater than one rotation per minute, therefore avoiding the error fluctuations caused by water vapour in the atmosphere. This scanning process will provide an important contribution to the data processing. Telescope A Ground Shield will be built to avoid signal contamination with thermal radiation that may come from below the horizon, to reflect side lobes to the sky and to reduce the noise originating from diffraction from the edges of the reflector to the receiver. This will be made possible by an aluminium grid surrounding the radio telescope, which is 10 meters wide but only 8 meters high because it will be inclined towards the exterior. The edges will be curved with a radius larger than ¬º of the wavelength so that diffraction is reduced. Localization The antenna is located at Pampilhosa da Serra at an altitude of 800m above sea level. This location was chosen because it is surrounded by a mountain range which peaks at about 1000m above sea level, which give a natural \\"shielding\\" from the electromagnetic noise of the neighboring cities. The same reason that made this location a good choice also created additional problems, since many of the necessary infrastructures had to be prepared and installed. The Telescope foundations were studied by the D√©partement of Civil Engineering of the Universidade de Aveiro and the city hall of Pampilhosa da Serra offered 120 tons of concrete. A new connection to the electric grid was made taking into account the size of the transformer to avoid noise in the observed frequencies. This was necessary because the wavelength of the emitted radiation is close to size of the transformer. A small meteorologic station was also installed to measure the wind intensity and help prevent against wind damages on the telescope. A second telescope is planned on the same site, to study solar phenomena.

Background History A fan of the television series Lost, and inspired by Leo Laporte and his this Week in Tech podcast, Cliff Ravenscraft began with a Lost-discussion podcast after only finding one other on the subject in 2005. Ravenscraft began the podcast as a hobby with no experience in broadcasting, radio, or television; in a June 2007 interview with Podcast User Magazine, Ravenscraft confessed that \\"he didn't put a lot [of] preparation into the show at first, and that his audio was poor, but [...] the content was in high demand.\\" Ravenscraft gathered thousands of listeners in only a few weeks, and quickly added his wife Stephanie to the podcast. Soon thereafter, they launched a second Lost podcast, followed by podcasts discussing faith and family issues, and one about Cliff's life (originally titled My Crazy Life). In December 2008, Cliff Ravenscraft had worked in the insurance industry for eleven years when he left his job to begin podcasting full-time. In 2008, he claimed that, since October 2009, GSPN was producing \\"more money every month that [he'd] ever made in [his] life.\\" Personnel Stephanie and Cliff Ravenscraft Cliff Ravenscraft (born c. 1972/1973) grew up in Erlanger, Kentucky and graduated Conner High School in 1992. In 2001, Ravenscraft was an associate pastor of a Highland Heights, Kentucky church for which he blogged about his faith in his \\"Almost Daily Devotional\\". Building upon a childhood interest in CB radio, and after he began the Weekly LOST Podcast, Ravenscraft switched from blogging to podcasting. Cliff and his wife Stephanie have three children, Meagan, Matthew, and McKenna. The elder two Ravenscraft children have produced their own GSPN podcasts, The World According To Meagan and Gaming With Matt respectively. Products Podcasts GSPN only advertises on two of its podcasts, and has strict requirements as to where and how advertisements will be implemented. GSPN previously offered a subscription service for US$10 a month which removed ads for subscribers, and gave them access to additional podcast material and a daily blog. GSPN scrapped the Plus Member program on January 17, 2011, and has since produced all content with no advertising. The PodcastAnswerMan podcast however sells products where the product itself is a video tutorial. Cliff Ravenscraft also offers a 4-week online podcasting course for a fee. , GSPN currently lists 24 separate podcasts, divided by subject matter: ;Balanced Living podcasts * Biggest Loser * Family From the Heart, Authentic Life Radio, Pursuing A Balanced Life (previously My Crazy life), and Watermark Church ;Business & Technology podcasts *Business Tech Weekly (cancelled) *Facebook 101 *Help I Got a Mac (cancelled) *Podcast Answer Man *Social Media Serenity (cancelled) *Virtual Assistant Podcast ;Entertainment podcasts *Desperate Housewives *Doctor Who *Gaming With Matt *Grey's Anatomy *Heroes *Musically Challenged *Private Practice *The World According To Meagan *TV Talk *Twilight Saga Podcast *Hunger Games Fan Podcast *Weekly LOST Podcast Weekly LOST Podcast Cliff Ravenscraft began GSPN and his podcasting career with his Lost podcast. Stephanie Ravenscraft introduced her husband to the series and, after watching the first season finale in May 2005, he was hooked.

The series was produced by Herb Klynn and Jules Engel of Format Films, Hollywood, and designed and made at the Halas and Batchelor Cartoon Film studios in London, England & Artransa Park Studios in Australia. In 1980, Filmation produced another Lone Ranger cartoon series. Overview The adventures in this Lone Ranger series were similar in tone and nature to CBS' prime-time Weird Western, The Wild Wild West, in that some of the plots were bizarre and had elements of science fiction and steampunk technology included in the story. One of the Lone Ranger's archenemies in the animated series was a dwarf named Terrible Tiny Tom; an analogue to The Wild Wild West's Dr. Miguelito Loveless. Other supervillain-style foes in the series included the Fly, Frogman, Black Widow, Iron Giant, Mephisto, Mr. Happy and the Puppetmaster. Cast *Michael Rye ‚Äî Lone Ranger *Shepard Menken ‚Äî Tonto *Dick Beals ‚Äî Tiny Tom *Agnes Moorehead ‚Äî Black Widow *Hans Conried ‚Äî Mephisto *Paul Winchell ‚Äî The Rain Maker Production The Lone Ranger's voice was provided by Michael Rye {r.n. John Michael Riorden Billsbury}, and Shepard Menken provided that of Tonto. The narrator in the opening titles was Marvin Miller, whose narration ran: Other guest voices were provided by Paul Winchell, Agnes Moorehead, and Hans Conried. The animation was limited. But the backgrounds had a dark style, with blocks of color elided from the line, which visually set the show apart from many other cartoon TV series of the time. The distinct atmospheric music was composed by Vic Schoen, who also provided the powerful arrangement of Gioachino Rossini's William Tell Overture for the show's memorable opening sequence. Along with the Halas and Batchelor animators, the background department, led by Tom Bailey, Ted Petengel and designer Chris Miles, were responsible for setting the graphic style. The drawings were produced by chinagraph pencil on cell. Colored papers were cut or torn under or against the lines of the background, producing a dramatic and rich textural effect.

This was partially explainable as a result of confusion over the ownership of the copyright to it. However, Universal Television, which had been partially responsible for the show's production in the sense of having commissioned Format Films and Halas and Batchelor Animation to work on it with the permission of Jack Wrather Productions, then owners of the Lone Ranger copyright, could be said to have a legitimate copyright-ownership claim.

It is part of Belleville Township High School District. History Prior to 1966, Belleville Township School District operated only one school, Belleville Township High School, which was the old Belleville West campus (a new campus has since been built). The growth of the district prompted the local board of education to construct a new campus and divide the student body between the two schools. The new campus was built in a college format with many different buildings. The newly commissioned Belleville Area College (now Southwestern Illinois College) occupied half of the campus while the new high school occupied the other. Enrollment in the school increased rapidly and the college was forced to move to a new location. Major renovations were completed in 2009. These included new landscaping, more classrooms, remodeled classrooms and buildings, new lockers, and a new cafeteria.

Through direct litigation and advocacy, NCLR works to change discriminatory laws and to create new laws and policies protecting the LGBT community. Career Kendell served with NCLR beginning in 1994, when she joined the organization as its Legal Director. Two years later, she was named Executive Director, serving in that role until stepping down in 2018. Kendell grew up as a Latter- day Saint in Utah.

J. Phillips\\", Daughters of Africa, Ballantine Books, 1994, p. 667. Her best known work is the novel Mojo Hand, first published in 1966, the story of a light-skinned upper-class young woman from San Francisco, California, who after hearing a record by bluesman Blacksnake Brown seeks him out and becomes embroiled in an ultimately tragic relationship with him. Biography J. J. Phillips grew up in Los Angeles, California, in a progressive African-American family; her mother was a school teacher for 60 years, her father was Pasadena's first African-American attorney and real-estate developer. Phillips has said, \\"My immediate family was assimilated, atheist, and were for all intents and purposes indistinguishable from Caucasians in visage and speech.\\" Phillips studied at Immaculate Heart College, where as a freshman in 1962 she became interested in black roots music and travelled to Raleigh, North Carolina, to join the civil rights movement. She worked on a National Student Association voter-registration campaign and later joined a Congress of Racial Equality-sit-in at a Howard Johnson's restaurant, where she was arrested, spending 30 days in the county jail before returning to California.Govenar, 2010, pp. 156‚Äì157. After reading The Country Blues by Samuel Charters, she listened to the music of Lightnin' Hopkins and determined to meet him, going with a roommate to Houston, Texas, to hear him play.Govenar, 2010, p. 157. She was expelled from Immaculate Heart College in January 1963,Govenar, 2010, p. 159. and has recalled: \\"I was extremely distraught. I wanted to be in school, but clearly the nuns didn't want me there. And soon after that I cam up with the idea to write a book that combined my fascination with Lightnin' with my abiding interest in herpetology, especially the blacksnake, which became the first name of the blues singer in Mojo Hand.\\" That debut novel, published in 1966, and reissued 20 years later as Mojo Hand: An Orphic Tale, has been characterised as a \\"blues lament in literary form\\". The Los Angeles Times reviewer wrote in 1986: \\"Mojo Hand anticipates the lessons of much recent black women's fiction--here, the women hold things together, often literally tying random moments of humor and beauty into an at least tolerable daily tapestry. Phillips' novel is true to its African and Greek antecedents, showing the uncanny links between musical, mystical and sexual intoxication. The moral ambiguities of these ties have rarely been so economically, knowingly, or eloquently portrayed as here.\\"James A. Snead, \\"Mojo Hand: An Orphic Tale by J. J. Phillips\\" (review), Los Angeles Times, April 20, 1986.

In 2015 the novel was described by Nat Hentoff as the \\"most neglected book I know of\\".Stephanie Bastek, \\"Neglected Books Revisited, Part 2\\", The American Scholar, July 20, 2015. Influences Phillips was interviewed by Alan Govenar for his 2010 book Lightnin' Hopkins: His Life and Blues, in which he discusses the fallacy that Mojo Hand is \\"thinly disguised autobiography\\" based on her affair with Lightnin' Hopkins.Alan Govenar, \\"Mojo Hand:An Orphic Tale\\", chapter 7 in Lightnin' Hopkins: His Life and Blues, Chicago Review Press, 2010, pp. 155‚Äì172. In speaking about the origins of Mojo Hand, and setting out to tell \\"a story of one person's journey from a non-racialized state to the racialized real world\\", as was happening to her, Phillips said: > \\"I realized that the perfect vehicle for effecting this was my own bluesy > Orphic quest, which I developed after I had seen Marcel Camus's classic film > Black Orpheus several times, and which led me to Lightnin'. The movie is a > version of the story of Orpheus and Eurydice set in the black favelas of Rio > during Mardi Gras.

It has been used as common land since the medieval period and is best known for the discovery of the preserved bog body of Lindow Man in 1984. The peat bog was formed in a collection of hollows left by melting ice at the end of the last ice age. The first written record of Lindow Moss was in 1421 when the lord of Mobberley and Wilmslow allowed people to dig peat from the mossland for use as fuel. It originally covered over 600 hectares (1,500 acres), but has since shrunk to a tenth of its original size. The bog can be a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there. For centuries, peat from the bog was used as fuel. It continues to be extracted but now for mixing within compost products. The process is now mechanised with a mechanical digger. The site is known for its flora and fauna such as hare's-tail cottongrass, common cottongrass and green hairstreak butterfly. It also has been a habitat for water voles although their continued existence is threatened by sinking water levels. The Saltersley Common Preservation Society promotes the preservation of the moss. In November 2011, they teamed up with a local amateur filmmaker to produce a short video detailing the history of the bog and some of the threats it faces.

At the end of the first year, students are interviewed to check their commitment to this particular program as well as their will to choose a clear career path. Sophomores are expected to have at least some months of work experience in any business. Every new student will at some time of his curriculum, usually at the beginning, pass this admission interview so as to receive clearance to continue their studies at the ILIS. Programmes The first two years, a sound scientific background is required from students if they are to succeed. During their graduation year they will concentrate on quality management and audits. The fourth and fifth year is more marketing and management oriented with teamwork becoming even more important. The placements, the duration of which increases each year, allow students to integrate the reality of the working world progressively: 2 x 6 weeks full- time in the 2nd year, 2 x 2 months full-time in the 3rd year and 5 and 6 months full-time in the fourth and fifth year respectively . The objectives of these placements have been clearly defined : * development of direct relationships with industry and the working world * involvement and accountability of students, leading to real autonomy and competence thanks to analytic tools, synthetic techniques, capacity to draw up and carry out a plan of action or a project from A to Z.

IPM 0462012Cliche, Andre: Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide 8th Edition, page B-23 Cybair Limited Publishing, 2001. Development The FP-404 was designed by Fisher Aircraft in the United States in 1984 and was the company's first design that was too heavy for the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, with the category's maximum empty weight. The 404's standard empty weight is when equipped with a two-stroke Rotax 503 engine, putting it into the US experimental-amateur-built category, although it qualifies as an ultralight in other countries, such as Canada. The design goal was to provide a nostalgic aircraft reminiscent of the biplanes of the 1930s, as the company explains \\"The FP-404 represents a reborn era in airborne adventure. This bi-plane aircraft is a throw-back to seat-of-the-pants flying, complete with minimal instruments and bare-necessity controls.\\" The construction of the FP-404 is similar to the Fisher FP-202 Koala. The aircraft's structure is entirely made from wood, with the wooden fuselage built from wood strips arranged in a geodesic form, resulting in a very strong and light aircraft with redundant load paths. Both the wings and fuselage are covered with doped aircraft fabric. The wings are strut-braced with both interplane struts and cabane struts. The aircraft has no flaps. The company claims it takes an amateur builder 500 hours to build the FP-404, \\"using normal household tools\\". Early versions of the FP-404 were equipped with the Rotax 277 in an attempt to keep the aircraft under the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles weight limit but the aircraft was found to be under-powered due to its short wing span and high- drag configuration. Heavier engines, like the Rotax 447 and Rotax 503 engines provided adequate power but put the 404 over the category weight limit. These models were designated as the Fisher 404 EXP to show that they would not qualify for the FAR 103 weight limit. By late 2004 over 350 FP-404s were flying. Reviewer Andre Cliche said about the design: Variants ;FP-404 :Single-seat, single-engined biplane, initial version equipped with a Rotax 277 powerplant for the FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category ;FP-404 EXP :Single-seat, single-engined biplane, later version equipped with a Rotax 447 or Rotax 503 powerplant for the US experimental-amateur-built category Specifications (FP-404 EXP)  See also References External links *Official website *Photo of FP-404 Category:1980s Canadian ultralight aircraft ","title":"Fisher FP-404"},{"id":"24754060","text":"Roseland University Prep is a public college preparatory high school located in Santa Rosa, California, USA.

On the state's highest court, he ruled the book Fanny Hill obscene and banned its publishing in the state, issued rulings in two major murder cases, advocated for the equal citizenship rights of the mentally handicapped and was one of the few dissenting votes objecting to the jailing of a reporter who refused to turn over his notes in a murder case. Early life and career Pashman was born in Passaic on September 27, 1912.Honan, William H. \\"Morris Pashman, 87, Champion of Free Speech on New Jersey's Highest Court\\", The New York Times, October 10, 1999.

Cases.\\", The Record (Bergen County), October 4, 1999. Accessed October 19, 2009. After spending time in private practice, Pashman was named in 1946 to serve in Passaic on its police court, and later on its municipal court. Elected Mayor of Passaic in 1951, he served until 1955 and then served as city commissioner and director of revenue and finance. Superior Court After two years on Passaic County Court, Governor of New Jersey Robert B. Meyner appointed him to New Jersey Superior Court in 1961. He became the assignment judge for Passaic County in 1965 and for Bergen County in 1966. In a 1964 decision, Pashman upheld Bergen County prosecutor Guy W. Calissi's decision to ban the sale of the John Cleland book Fanny Hill in New Jersey, calling the book \\"sufficiently obscene to forfeit the protection of the First Amendment of the Constitution.\\" In addition to failing tests of \\"social value,\\" \\"prurient interest\\" and \\"patently offensive,\\" Pashman ruled that Fanny Hill failed the \\"hard-core pornography test,\\" noting that the \\"book may be well-written but still obscene.\\"Waggoner, Walter H. \\"Fanny Hill' Sale Banned in Jersey; Judge Rules Its Obscenity 'Forfeits' Protection\\", The New York Times, December 8, 1964. Accessed October 20, 2009. The decision was overturned, and Pashman would later call his actions in the case an \\"aberration,\\" saying that \\"I think every judge or justice is entitled to one.\\" In a 1966 ruling in a case filed by the Passaic County Bar Association, Pashman's decision stated that the Passaic County Board of Chosen Freeholders was obligated to replace the county courthouse due to inadequate conditions in the building. A new building was constructed within four years of the order. In a 1971 case, Pashman agreed to a plea bargain that would allow Edgar Smith to go free based on time served. Smith had been convicted of the 1957 murder of a 15-year-old cheerleader and assessed the death sentence, but the prosecutor later disclosed that critical evidence in the case was no longer available and agreed to allow Smith to plead guilty to second-degree murder, fearing that Smith would be able to claim false imprisonment. New Jersey Supreme Court Governor William T. Cahill named Pashman to serve as a Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court in April 1973 to replace Justice Haydn Proctor.Sullivan, Ronald. \\"Cahill Names Two Justices And Supreme Court Chief; Nominees Praised 2 Meyner Nominees\\", The New York Times, April 19, 1973. In the 1978 \\"Dr. X\\" murder trial of Mario Jascalevich, Judge Theodore Trautwein had ordered that reporter M. A. Farber of The New York Times be sent to jail for refusing to turn over notes to the defense attorney. When Farber was about to be jailed, his attorneys filed for an emergency stay on a weekend and Pashman arrived in his golfing attire to grant the stay. When the full court heard the case the next day, Pashman was the only dissenter as the court upheld the lower court ruling and ordered that Farber serve time in jail. When the court reaffirmed the lower court action in a decision in September 1978, Pashman and fellow Justice Alan B. Handler were the only dissenters. In another 1978 case, this on challenging New Jersey's Blue Laws, the court ruled 5-2 to uphold the laws then in effect in 10 of the state's 21 counties restricting sales of certain products on Sundays. Handler and Pashman were the only dissenters, with Pashman saying that the law fails the too-frequently ignored \\"test of common sense\\" and that it improperly grants government the right to tell people what to do \\"for their own good.\\"Waldron, Martin. \\"Jersey's High Court Upholds Blue Law; Prohibition on Some Sunday Sales in Effect in 10 of 21 Counties.\\", The New York Times, July 19, 1978.

They catered to big game hunters, cowboy action shooters and specialty gun builders. History In 1996 Marc Jamison, founder of Jamison International, believed that there was a definite need for a producer of custom and obsolete cartridge cases. By November of that year he started his company, Rocky Mountain Tool and Armory (RMTA) in Huntington Beach, California, after purchasing equipment from MAST Technology, Inc of Las Vegas, NV. In August 2001 Jamison moved his business and machinery from California to the Black Hills in Sturgis, South Dakota.

The FBI found no evidence that any classified materials were actually released to anyone outside the US Government.  Personal life and education  Nozette was born in Chicago, Illinois, on May 20, 1957, to Helen and Morris Nozette. He grew up in Chicago‚Äôs West Rogers Park neighborhood and earned a B.S. in geosciences with honors and distinction (University of Arizona, 1979), and a Ph.D. in Planetary sciences (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1983).Nozette (2008). He worked a couple of summers in the 1970's as a guide-lecturer at the Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago) while he was home from the University of Arizona. Career In 1983-1984 Nozette was co-director of the California Space Institute, affiliated with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. From there he went to the University of Texas as an Assistant Professor of Aerospace Engineering Austin, Texas. In the early 1990s, Nozette, as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative's 'Brilliant Pebbles', conceived the idea (and then led the mission) of the Clementine spacecraft as a means to both provide a test bed for the development of lighter, more cost effective advanced space technology, as well as to obtain data for the Moon.Stewart Nozette, \\"The Clementine Mission\\" Abstracts of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Vol 26, 1995, p. 1061, doi:1995LPI....26.1061N (web version) Nozette and colleagues' bistatic radar results from Clementine claimed to support the discovery of water on the south pole of the moon. Although the significance of the result was questioned, measurements made by subsequent Lunar missions have supported the hypothesis that the Moon holds substantially greater reserves of water than had been thought based on Apollo program results and confirmed Nozette's original findings. The engineering model of the Clementine spacecraft, which Nozette created and led the design of, hangs in the Air & Space Museum in Washington DC. Over the course of his career, Nozette held high level security clearances and worked on sensitive United States nuclear and satellite programs.Margasak (2009). He held a Q clearance, top secret clearance, and was read into multiple special access programs. He held Top Secret security clearances to study nuclear material with the United States Department of Energy, and was on the National Space Council under President George H. W. Bush. From 1989 to 2006, Nozette held a security clearance as high as top secret and handled documents relating to national security. He left the employ of the U.S. government in 2006. Nozette worked as a technical consultant for Israel Aerospace Industries between 1998 and 2008. After he left the government job, Nozette was heavily involved in India's extraterrestrial Moon probe, Chandrayaan-1. He was a principal investigator of the Mini-RF instrument on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and a co- investigator on Chandrayaan-1.

Perineal tears mainly occur in women as a result of vaginal childbirth, which strains the perineum. It is the most common form of obstetric injury. Tears vary widely in severity. The majority are superficial and may require no treatment, but severe tears can cause significant bleeding, long-term pain or dysfunction. A perineal tear is distinct from an episiotomy, in which the perineum is intentionally incised to facilitate delivery. Episiotomy, a very rapid birth, or large fetal size can lead to more severe tears which may require surgical intervention. Anatomy In women, an anatomical area known as the perineum separates the opening of the vagina from that of the anus. Each opening is surrounded by a wall, and the anal wall is separated from the vaginal wall by a mass of soft tissue including: * The muscles of the anus (corrugator cutis ani, the internal anal sphincter and the external anal sphincter) * The medial muscles of the urogenital region (the superficial transverse perineal muscle, the deep transverse perineal muscle and bulbocavernosus) * The medial levator ani muscles (puborectalis and pubococcygeus) * The fascia of perineum, which covers these muscles * The overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue A perineal tear may involve some or all of these structures, which normally aid in supporting the pelvic organs and maintaining faecal continence. Classification Tears are classified into four categories:Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary tabers.com *First-degree tear: laceration is limited to the fourchette and superficial perineal skin or vaginal mucosa *Second-degree tear: laceration extends beyond fourchette, perineal skin and vaginal mucosa to perineal muscles and fascia, but not the anal sphincter *Third-degree tear: fourchette, perineal skin, vaginal mucosa, muscles, and anal sphincter are torn; third-degree tears may be further subdivided into three subcategories:MDConsult mdconsult.com **3a: partial tear of the external anal sphincter involving less than 50% thickness **3b: greater than 50% tear of the external anal sphincter **3c: internal sphincter is torn *Fourth-degree tear: fourchette, perineal skin, vaginal mucosa, muscles, anal sphincter, and rectal mucosa are torn *Button-hole tear: the tear involves rectal mucosa with an intact anal sphincter complex Cause In humans and some other primates, the head of the term fetus is so large in comparison to the size of the birth canal that delivery may result in some degree of trauma. As the head passes through the pelvis, the soft tissues are stretched and compressed. The risk of severe tear is greatly increased if the fetal head is oriented occiput posterior (face forward), if the mother has not given birth before or if the fetus is large. A surgical incision on the perineum skin called an episiotomy was historically used routinely in order to reduce perineal tears. However, its routine use has declined as there is some evidence it increases the severity of tears when it is not indicated. A Cochrane review found that routine use of epsiotomy increased the incidence of severe perineal tears by 30%. Several other techniques are used to reduce the risk of tearing, but with little evidence for efficacy. Antenatal digital perineal massage is often advocated, and may reduce the risk of trauma only in nulliparous women. ‚ÄòHands on‚Äô techniques employed by midwives, in which the foetal head is guided through the vagina at a controlled rate have been widely advocated, but their efficacy is unclear. Waterbirth and labouring in water are popular for several reasons, and it has been suggested that by softening the perineum they might reduce the rate of tearing. However, this effect has never been clearly demonstrated. Another popular method of perineal tearing prevention are childbirth exercisers such as Aniball or Epi-No. There are currently ongoing studies supporting their effectiveness. Treatment Treatment is to either let the tear heal naturally or to surgically repair it. Third and fourth degree tears generally require surgical repair. A Cochrane review of comparing surgical treatment with natural healing of first and second degree tears found no to little difference between the two treatment options. The review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend either treatment option over the other for first and second degree tears. Prevalence A 2008 study found that over 85% of women having a vaginal birth sustain some form of perineal trauma.Kettle, C., & Tohill, S. (2008). Perineal care. Clinical evidence, 2008. A retrospective study of 8,603 vaginal deliveries in 1994 found a third degree tear had been clinically diagnosed in only 50 women (0.6%). However, when the same authors used anal endosonography in a consecutive group of 202 deliveries, there was evidence of third degree tears in 35% of first-time mothers and 44% of mothers with previous children. These numbers are confirmed by other researchers in 1999. A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that in 2011, first- and second- degree perineal tear was the most common complicating condition for vaginal deliveries in the U.S. among women covered by either private insurance or Medicaid. Second-degree perineal laceration rates were higher for women covered by private insurance than for women covered by Medicaid. Complications First and second degree tears rarely cause long-term problems. Among women who experience a third or fourth degree tear, 60-80% are asymptomatic after 12 months. Faecal incontinence, faecal urgency, chronic perineal pain, pain with sex, and fistula formation occur in a minority of people, but may be permanent. The symptoms associated with perineal tear are not always due to the tear itself, since there are often other injuries, such as avulsion of pelvic floor muscles, that are not evident on examination. There are claims that sometimes the perineum is excessively repaired after childbirth, using a so-called \\"husband stitch\\" and that this can increase vaginal tightness or result in pain during intercourse.

He painted primarily scenes of daily life, such as people interacting in markets and villages. Life Ferg was born in Vienna on 2 May 1689, the son of the history painter Adam Pancraz Ferg, from whom he received his initial artistic education. His father then placed him under a painter called Baschueber, with whom he remained for four years. He returned to his father's house, and studied the engravings of Callot and Le Clerc, whose peculiarities proved a great influence on his style. He then studied at Vienna under Hans Graaf, a painter of small landscapes with figures, fairs, etc., but more permanently under Joseph Orient, a well-known landscape painter, in whose house he lived for three years, often painting the figures in his landscapes. In 1718 Ferg he left for Vienna and settled for some years at Bamberg. Meeting with the landscape-painter Alexander Thiele at Leipzig, he went with him to Dresden, and worked with him there for some time. He soon gained a great reputation for small landscapes and sea-pieces with figures, and for fairs and peasant scenes in the style of Ostade, Berchem, and Poelenburg. These were executed, often on copper, with great care and industry, well-coloured and exquisitely finished. He eventually settled in London. Although he found plenty of employment there, he drifted into depressed circumstances. According to some sources this was due to his own irresponsibility and an ill-advised marriage. This version of events was, however, disputed by Noel Desenfans, who attributed Ferg's difficulties to a head injury caused by a blow from falling roof-tile, which rendered him unable to paint. One night in 1740 he was found dead in the street, not far from his lodgings, in a condition of great destitution. His pictures are frequently met with in private collections in England and in public galleries abroad, notably Brunswick, Dresden, and Vienna. A set of the Four Seasons was engraved by T. Major, and others by Fran√ßois Vivares, J. Wagner, C. G. Geyser, and others, including two pictures engraved in the Galerie Lebrun. Ferg also executed some etchings, mostly landscapes of a small size with figures and ruins; also a larger plate of Boors Carousing, in the style of Ostade. These are among works from the Sheepshanks collection now in the British Museum. A portrait of him was engraved by J. F. Bause. John Thomas Smith and some later sources refer to Ferg working as a decorator at the Chelsea porcelain factory: this cannot however be true, as it was not in production until after his death.

He served as an officer with the British Army in the First World War and later in the National Army. In the Civil War he was second in overall command of the National Army from January to May 1923. He was first Irish Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police and the last Commissioner of the force before its merger with the Garda S√≠och√°na in 1925. Thereafter he was the Deputy Commissioner of the Garda√≠ until his retirement in 1955. British Army Murphy was born in Wexford in 1890. He joined the British Army in Belfast in 1915 as an officer cadet in the South Staffordshire Regiment.Michael Harrington, The Munster Republic p58 He served in the Battle of Loos in 1915 and was wounded, but returned to action for the start of the Battle of the Somme in July 1916. He became commanding officer of the 1st Battalion; the South Staffordshire Regiment in August 1918, reaching the rank of temporary lieutenant colonel. In 1918, his regiment were posted to the Italian Front, at the Piave River, where they were when the armistice was declared on 4 November 1918. He was granted the rank of substantive lieutenant colonel on the retired list on 16 May 1922. After he returned to Ireland he resumed his career as a teacher. At some point he joined the Irish Republican Army ‚Äì a guerrilla organisation fighting to end British rule in Ireland.Niall C Harrington, Kerry Landing, p37 Civil War In December 1921, the Anglo- Irish Treaty was signed between British and Irish leaders, resulting in the setting up of the Irish Free State. Conflict over the Treaty among Irish nationalists ultimately led to the outbreak of Civil War in June 1922. In 1922 Murphy enlisted as a general in the new National Army of the Irish Free State. After the start of the Civil War, he was put in command of troops charged with taking posts held by the anti-Treaty IRA in Limerick. At the Battle of Killmallock in July‚ÄìAugust 1922, he was second in command to Eoin O'Duffy.Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p151 His troops successfully dislodged the anti-Treaty IRA from positions around Killmallock in Limerick but Murphy was criticised for his tendency to 'dig in' and resort to trench warfare rather than rapid offensive action.Michael Harrington, p58 Afterwards, he was put in overall command of Free State forces in County Kerry until January 1923. He lobbied Richard Mulcahy, commander in chief, for 250 extra troops, to bring his command up to 1,500 and help to put down the guerrilla resistance there. In the early stages of the guerrilla war he organised large scale 'sweeps' to break up republican concentrations in west Cork and east Kerry. These met with little success, however.Hopkinson p 204 Murphy exercised overall command in the county but day-to-day operations were largely run by Brigadier Paddy Daly, of the Dublin Guard.Tom Doyle, the Civil War in Kerry, p188 In October, in response to continuing guerrilla attacks on his troops, Murphy ordered a curfew to be put into place in Tralee from 10:30 until 5:39 every night.Doyle, p201 In December, Murphy wrote to Mulcahy that the, \\"Irregular [Anti-Treaty] organisation here is well nigh broken up\\", and suggested the end of the war in the county was in sight. His optimistic prediction proved premature, however.Doyle p232 On 20 December, Murphy sentenced four captured republican fighters to death under the Public Safety Act for possession of arms and ammunition. However, the sentences were to be called off if local guerrilla activity ceased. Humphrey Murphy, the local IRA Brigade commander, threatened to shoot eight named government supporters in reprisal if the men were executed. Eventually their sentence was commuted to penal servitude.Doyle, p235-236, 240 In January 1923, Murphy was promoted from his command in Kerry to \\"responsibility for operations and organisation at the national level\\" in the army. Paddy Daly took over as commanding officer in Kerry. Murphy later voiced the opinion that Daly had been a bad choice, given his implication in the Ballyseedy Massacre and other events of March 1923, in which up to 30 anti-Treaty prisoners were killed in the county.Doyle p240-241 Police career Murphy left the National Army after the end of the Civil War in May 1923 and became first Irish commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. He later became deputy commissioner of the Garda S√≠och√°na, when DMP was merged with the new national police force in 1925. He held this post until his retirement in 1955.Doyle p240 Murphy was to the forefront of efforts to close down Dublin's red light district the Monto in the early 1920s. Between 1923 and 1925, religious missions led by Frank Duff of the Legion of Mary, a Roman Catholic organisation, and Fr. R.S. Devane worked to close down the brothels. They received the co-operation of Murphy in his role as Dublin Police Commissioner, and the campaign ended with 120 arrests and the closure of the brothels following a police raid on 12 March 1925. Murphy also held the post for a time of president of the Irish Amateur Boxing Association. He died in 1975.

In major epidemics, the attack rate range is 100 to 800 people per 100,000. However, communities can have attack rates as high as 1000 per 100,000. During these epidemics, young children have the highest attack rates.

(1962‚Äì1968), succeeding Bishop Charles Harrison Mason, who was the founder. The Church of God in Christ (COGIC) is the fourth largest denomination in the United States. Early life Ozro Thurston (O.T.) Jones was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas, the son of Baptist parents, Marion and Mary Jones. As a young man, in 1912, he experienced and confessed salvation and \\"spirit baptism\\" or \\"infilling\\" as a second work of grace. He answered a call to the ministry under the guidance of Elder Justus Bowe, a COGIC pioneer. Soon afterwards, he, his older sister and a brother developed into an evangelistic team in North Arkansas and the surrounding states. Over the next few years 18 congregations were established as a direct result of their evangelistic endeavors. In 1914 Elder Jones organized the youth department of the Church of God in Christ and served as its first president. Two years later he founded and edited the Y.P.W.W. Quarterly Topics, an education-oriented journal. In 1920 he was appointed assistant to the state overseer in Oklahoma. Pastorship In 1925, Jones' career took a decisive turn when he became pastor of a small congregation of Holiness believers in Philadelphia. He moved to Philadelphia where he would reside for the rest of his life. The congregation grew into the historic Holy Temple Church of God in Christ. In 1926 he became the state overseer for Pennsylvania. Not forgetting his work with the youth of the church, in 1928 he founded the International Youth Congress of the Church of God in Christ. In 1933 Bishop Charles Harrison Mason, the founder of the Church of God in Christ, selected Jones as one of the five men to be consecrated as the denomination's first \\"founding\\" bishops. He was later selected to serve on the executive commission created by Mason to assist him during his last years in office. Following Mason's death in November 1961, the commission then headed by Bishop A.B. McEwen, administered the affairs of the church for one year. Then in late 1962, the board of bishops moved to nominate a new senior bishop. They chose Jones and placed his name before the church's general assembly, which approved the motion. Jones retained authorship of the Y.P.W.W. Topics and he remained Jurisdictional Bishop of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. At no time did Bishop Jones Sr. give up any of his offices. Senior Bishop of the Church of God in Christ Events moved smoothly for the first few years of Jones' tenure, but opposition began to appear in 1965. Voices rose demanding regular elections for the office of a presiding bishop. The situation threatened to split the denomination, and a number of lawsuits answered with counter-lawsuits were filed. The courts finally ordered an election, and in 1968 a constitutional convention held its first session on January 30, 1968. The convention established clear guidelines for the election of church leaders, and later that year the elections were held. Eventually, James Oglethorpe Patterson was elected presiding bishop. This effectively removed Bishop O. T. Jones Sr. from office. He remained Jurisdictional Bishop in Pennsylvania. Personal life and death In 1921, Jones married Neanza Williams in St. Louis, Missouri. To this union were born six children. Dr. O. T. Jones Jr., Walter B. Jones, Dr. William V. Jones Sr., Mrs. Jean Anderson, Mrs. Elma Harriet Freeman and Mrs. Marian Ellison. Bishop Jones died on September 23, 1972 in Wynnewood, PA after a protracted illness. He was 81. His son, Dr. O. T. Jones Jr., then assumed the pastorship of Holy Temple and became Jurisdictional Bishop of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Jurisdiction.

Little response in Pacific floor.\\" The America's Intelligence Wire 22 June 2009: n. pag. Web. 17 Oct. 2009. The center of the South Pacific Gyre is the oceanic pole of inaccessibility, the site on Earth farthest from any continents and productive ocean regions and is regarded as Earth‚Äôs largest oceanic desert. The gyre, as with Earth's other four gyres, contains an area with elevated concentrations of pelagic plastics, chemical sludge, and other debris known as the South Pacific garbage patch.  Sediment flux and accumulation  The South Pacific Gyre. Earth‚Äôs trade winds and Coriolis force cause the ocean currents in South Pacific Ocean to circulate counter clockwise. The currents act to isolate the center of the gyre from nutrient upwelling and few nutrients are transported there by the wind (eolian processes) because there is relatively little land in the Southern Hemisphere to supply dust to the prevailing winds. The low levels of nutrients in the region result in extremely low primary productivity in the ocean surface and subsequently very low flux of organic material settling to the ocean floor as marine snow. The low levels of biogenic and eolian deposition cause sediments to accumulate on the ocean floor very slowly. In the center of the South Pacific Gyre, the sedimentation rate is per million years. The sediment thickness (from basement basalts to the seafloor) ranges from 1 to 70m, with thinner sediments occurring closer to the center of the Gyre. The low flux of particles to the South Pacific Gyre cause the water there to be the clearest seawater in the world.  Subseafloor biosphere  Beneath the seafloor, the marine sediments and surrounding porewaters contain an unusual subseafloor biosphere. Despite extremely low amounts of buried organic material, microbes live throughout the entire sediment column. Average cell abundances and net rates of respiration are a few orders of magnitude lower than any other subseafloor biosphere previously studied. The South Pacific Gyre subseafloor community is also unusual because it contains oxygen throughout the entire sediment column. In other subseafloor biospheres, microbial respiration will break down organic material and consume all the oxygen near the seafloor leaving the deeper portions of the sediment column anoxic. However, in the South Pacific Gyre the low levels of organic material, the low rates of respiration, and the thin sediments allow the porewater to be oxygenated throughout the entire sediment column.Fischer, J.P., et al. \\"Oxygen Penetration deep into the sediment of the South Pacific Gyre\\" Biogeoscience (Aug. 2009): 1467(6). http://www.biogeosciences.net/6/1467/2009/bg-6-1467-2009.pdf In July 2020, marine biologists reported that aerobic microorganisms (mainly), in \\"quasi- suspended animation\\", were found in organically-poor sediments, up to 101.5 million years old, 250 feet below the seafloor in the South Pacific Gyre (SPG) (\\"the deadest spot in the ocean\\"), and could be the longest-living life forms ever found.  Radiolytic H2: a benthic energy source  Benthic microbes in organic-poor sediments in oligotrophic oceanic regions, such as the South Pacific Gyre, are hypothesized to metabolize radiolytic hydrogen (H2) as a primary energy source. The oceanic regions within the South Pacific Gyre (SPG), and other subtropical gyres, are characterized by low primary productivity in the surface ocean; i.e. they are oligotrophic. The center of the SPG is the furthest oceanic province from a continent and contains the clearest ocean water on Earth with ‚â• 0.14 mg chlorophyll per m3. Carbon exported to the underlying deep ocean sediments via the biological pump is limited in the SPG, resulting in sedimentation rates that are orders of magnitude lower than in productive zones, e.g. continental margins. Typically, deep-ocean benthic microbial life utilizes the organic carbon exported from surface waters. In oligotrophic regions where sediments are poor in organic material, subsurface benthic life exploits other primary energy sources, such as molecular hydrogen (H2).  Radiolysis of interstitial water  Radioactive decay of naturally occurring uranium (238U and 235U), thorium (232Th), and potassium (40K) in seafloor sediments collectively bombard the interstitial water with Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ radiation. The irradiation ionizes and breaks apart water molecules, eventually yielding H2. The products of this reaction are aqueous electrons (e‚àíaq), hydrogen radicals (H¬∑), protons (H+), and hydroxyl radicals (OH¬∑). The radicals are highly reactive, therefore short-lived, and recombine to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2), and molecular hydrogen (H2). The amount of radiolytic H2 production in seafloor sediments is dependent on the quantities of radioactive isotopes present, sediment porosity, and grain size. These criteria indicate that certain sediment types, such as abyssal clays and siliceous oozes, may have higher radiolytic H2 production relative to other seafloor strata. Also, radiolytic H2 production has been measured in seawater intrusions into subseafloor basement basalts.  Microbial activity  The microbes best suited to utilize radiolytic H2 are the knallgas bacteria, lithoautotrophes, that obtain energy by oxidizing molecular hydrogen via the knallgas reaction: H2 (aq) + 0.5O2 (aq) H2O (l) In the surface layer of sediment cores from oligotrophic regions of the SPG, O2 is the primary electron acceptor used in microbial metabolisms. The O2 concentrations decline slightly in surface sediment (initial few decimeters) and are unchanged to depth. Meanwhile, nitrate concentrations slightly increase downward or remain constant in sediment column at approximately the same concentrations as the deep water above the seafloor. Measured negative fluxes of O2 in the surface layer demonstrate that a relatively low abundance of aerobic microbes that are oxidizing the minimally deposited organic matter from the ocean above. Extremely low cell counts corroborate that microbes exist in small quantities in these surface sediments. In contrast, a sediment cores outside of the SPG show rapid elimination of O2 and nitrate at 1 meter below sea floor (mbsf) and 2.5 mbsf, respectively. This is evidence of much higher microbial activity, both aerobic and anaerobic. The production of radiolytic H2 (electron donor) is stoichiometrically balanced with production of 0.5 O2 (electron acceptor), therefore a measurable flux in O2 is not expected in the substrate if both radiolysis of water and knallgas bacteria co-occur. So, despite the known occurrence of radiolytic H2 production, molecular hydrogen is below the detectable limit in the SPG cores, leading to the hypothesis that H2 is the primary energy source in low-organic seafloor sediments below the surface layer.  Water color  Satellite data images show that some areas in the gyre are greener than the surrounding clear blue water, which is frequently interpreted as areas with higher concentrations of living phytoplankton. However, the assumption that greener ocean water always contains more phytoplankton is not always true. Even though the South Pacific Gyre contains these patches of green water, it has very little organism growth. Instead, some studies hypothesize that these green patches are a result of the accumulated waste of marine life. The optical properties of the South Pacific Gyre remain largely unexplored.

After completing her formal education in the public school system, she relocated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1909. In 1912, she married William Lampkin, a restaurateur in the Pittsburgh suburbs. It was during this time that she developed her passion for social justice and civic engagement. Those issues that initially resonated with her were connected to her life as an African-American housewife. Motivated by the suffragette movement of the early 20th century, Lampkin began hosting local suffragist meetings at her home in 1912. After relocating within the city limits of Pittsburgh, Lampkin became increasingly involved in the local leadership of the suffragist movement. She joined the New Negro Women's Equal Franchise Federation, which would later be renamed the Lucy Stone League. Lampkin's early career as a suffragist included assembling street- corner speeches and organizing other black housewives to actively engage in consumer groups. In 1915, her leadership and oratorical ability earned her the position of president of the Lucy Stone League, a post she maintained until 1955. It was also during this time that Lampkin became intimately involved with the national framework of the black women's club movement. Her leadership within the women's club movement introduced her to the leadership circles within the federation of women's clubs, particularly the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), where she would eventually serve as National Board Chairwoman. During this period she developed collegial friendships with black women's movement leaders such as Addie Waites Hunton, Mary Church Terrell and Charlotte Hawkins Brown. Still her most noted partnership would come through her association and friendship with Mary McLeod Bethune, with whom she would later assist in founding the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) in 1935. Civil Rights Movement Upon securing the right to vote, Lampkin became increasingly involved in civic engagement and civil rights advocacy effort on both the local and national level. She served as Chairwoman of the Allegheny County Negro Women's Republican League, vice-Chairwoman of the Negro Voters League of Pennsylvania and vice-Chairwoman of the Colored Voters Division of the Republican National Committee. She established the first Red Cross chapter among black women and organized local chapters of both the Urban League and NAACP in Pittsburgh. Most notably, she was made a stockholder and subsequently vice-president of the Pittsburgh Courier, which she used to raise funds for social justice causes and events. In her role as writer, editor, and executive, the paper became the top African-American-run circulating paper in the world during the 1950s. Lampkin's influence in national politics would eventually take her to the White House to meet with then President Calvin Coolidge and other noted black leaders regarding racial equality in 1924. Reflective of both the period and Lampkin's position, she was the only woman in attendance at the meeting. Field Secretary of the NAACP These efforts would eventually lead to then national secretary of the NAACP, Walter White recruiting Lampkin as the first field secretary for the organization in 1930. Here Lampkin's efforts to organize and bolster the image of the NAACP nationally have become legendary. In 1931, Lampkin single-handedly organized the NAACP's 1931 National Convention in Pittsburgh. Her fundraising and organizing skills so impressed NAACP leadership that in 1935, she was moved from regional to National Field Secretary of the organization. That same year, while continuing to establish local NAACP chapters and participating in fundraising efforts, Lampkin along with White, spearheaded the organization‚Äôs drive to pass a federal anti-lynching bill in the United States Congress. Lampkin's direct involvement within the lobbying efforts on behalf of the bill far surpassed her collection of the $9,378 that she grossed through the button campaign during the Great Depression. In her description of opposition to the federal bill by white southern anti-lynching activist, Jessie Daniel Ames, because of its anti-states‚Äô rights stance,Giddings 1984. notes: \\"Black women thoroughly disgusted by Ames's stance, called a meeting with her and some of her supporters, in Atlanta in 1935. Daisy Lampkin who had been involved with the confrontation with the National Woman's Party and who was now a field secretary for the NAACP, began the discussion. The silence of the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching (ASWPL), she said, was strengthening the position of congressional opponents of the bill. They \\"[would] take new courage and they [would] use it to their advantage when they can stand on the floor and say that the‚Ä¶southern white women did not endorse the Costigan-Wagner Bill.\\"Giddings 1984, p. 209. While other black leaders such as Nannie Helen Burroughs and Mary Bethune proved to be more conciliatory in their understanding of southern white women's opposition to the anti- lynching law, Lampkin continued to decry the lack of support amongst her supposed white peers. Such insistence garnered Lampkin the image of the no- nonsense community activist that she was most known for during the era. Legacy In addition to her lobbying, organizing and fundraising efforts, Lampkin has also been credited with recruiting a young Baltimore attorney and future Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall to become a member of the NAACP's Legal Defense Committee in 1938. Marshall would go on to lead the organization in its successful litigation in Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka before the U.S. Supreme Court. She was credited with having the most substantial gains in membership among any of the organization's executive leadership. During her last year as National Field Secretary she raised over $1 million for the organizations. So dedicated was she to the NAACP and community organizing that has been said she to have crossed the country conducting 40 NAACP chapter meetings in one month. Lampkin would eventually take on a renewed interest in black women's organizing; assisting the Delta Sigma Theta sorority with internal fundraising and the centralizing of its finances and records. She has been credited with advancing the organization's ability to have a presence in the policy-making center of the nation. She was inducted as an Honorary Member in 1947. Death While she resigned as national field secretary in 1947, Lampkin continued to serve on the organization's executive board. She suffered a stroke while at a NAACP membership drive in Camden, New Jersey, and died on March 10, 1965. A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker is Placed at 2519 Webster Ave., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania commemorating her accomplishments. Her grave is at Homewood Cemetery, Pittsburgh.

He was born in Arvada, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, and lives part-time in a cave near Moab, Utah when he is not wandering the country. Suelo gained fame in October 2009 when his profile appeared in the US men's style print magazine Details. This story was picked up by websites such as The Guardian in the UK, The Huffington Post, and Matador Change. He was also interviewed for the BBC in September 2009, by The Denver Post in November 2009, and the Brazilian INFO in November 2009. His story has since been repeated by many websites and news agencies around the world. Suelo was the subject of a 2006 video profile entitled Moneyless in Moab (2006), by Gordon Stevenson and a 2009 video profile entitled Zero Currency (2009), by Brad Barber as well as being featured on KBYU's Beehive Stories (2010), also by Brad Barber. Penguin approached Suelo about writing an autobiography, but he said that he would not accept payment for telling his story and he would be interested to do so only if the book was given away for free. Penguin was not interested in this approach, but asked a friend of his, Mark Sundeen, about writing a biography. Sundeen wrote The Man Who Quit Money, which was published by Riverhead/Penguin in 2012, and Suelo did not accept any money from his book but requested that the publishers give away a number of copies to people for free, which they did at promotional book tours. A short film about Suelo, narrated by Mark Sundeen, is on BBC News Online. In 2016 Suelo moved back to his hometown to care for his aging parents,TEDxGrandJunction \\"The Gift Economy\\" and has been using money in this capacity while still caring for his mother, who is in her nineties as of 2017.

Prout (October 25, 1880 - April 27, 1969) was an American and Irish soldier. He served in the United States Army in the First World War, a training officer in the guerrilla Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1921) and held one of the senior commands in the National Army during the Irish Civil War (1922‚Äì23). First World War Prout was born in County Tipperary in 1880, but emigrated to the United States while still young. After the United States entry into the First World War in 1917, he enlisted with the United States 69th Infantry Regiment. He spent five months attached to the French command staff and was awarded the Croix de Guerre.Terence O'Reilly: Rebel Heart: George Lennon: Flying Column Commander Mercier 2009, p174  Irish War of Independence  After the war he returned to Ireland, where he became involved in the agitation for Irish independence and joined the Irish Republican Army. He served as a training and intelligence officer to the Third Tipperary Brigade, based at Galtee Castle.  Irish Civil War  When the IRA split over the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922, he sided with the Treaty. He subsequently joined the new National Army, where he was given the rank of Commandant General and given command of the southeast, based in Kilkenny.Niall C Harrington, Kerry Landing, p36 The Civil War, between pro- and anti-Treaty factions, broke out in June 1922. In July 1922, with a command of 450 men, and an 18 pounder field gun, Prout re-took the city of Waterford from anti-treaty forces after a three-day battle (see Irish Free State offensive).O'Reilly, p177-185 There he recruited 200 more soldiers into the National Army, and received a large shipment of arms by sea from Dublin. His troops also had to keep order in the city in the absence of any other civil power.O'Reilly, p190 Moving on from Waterford, his command proceeded to take the republican held town of Carrick on Suir, after more fighting on August 2, 1922. He went on to take Cashel and Clonmel. After a final stand at Redmondstown, the Anti-Treaty IRA in the south east gave up their fixed positions and took up guerrilla warfare.Michael Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p168-169 The guerrilla war was not as intense in Prout's south-eastern command as elsewhere but his troops came in for considerable criticism for indiscipline and inefficiency. A National Army report of October 1922 stated, \\"Prout is too weak as well as too guilless to handle traitorous or semi- mutinous incompetents\\". In December a number of posts under Prout's command, including Carrick on Suir, surrendered to an anti-Treaty column under Tom Barry, giving up their arms and equipment. Commandant General Eamon Price, sent to investigate the incident, backed Prout's plea for more arms and transport for his command and blamed Prout's subordinate officers for the reverse.Hopkinson p209-210 In 1923 Prout organised a number of successful operations, which helped to bring the war to an end. In February 1923 he launched a sweep of the Glen of Aherlow, killing republican commander Dinny Lacey and capturing several of his column. In March and April another sweep, of the Knockmealdown Mountains, arrested more anti-Treaty fighters, including several of the general staff, and killed their Commander-in-Chief, Liam Lynch,Hopkinson p235, 244 effectively ending the Civil War, as after Lynch's death the anti-Treaty forces laid down their arms. Nevertheless, his command was criticised by National Army GHQ until after the end of the war for its performance ‚Äì particularly for its failure to stamp out guerrilla activity in County Wexford.Hopkinson p246 Though the Civil War was marked by executions and killings of prisoners, in Prout's command there were only two judicial executions and no 'summary executions'. Republican Mick Sheehan commented, \\"We may thank Prout that there are so few.\\" O'Reilly, p205 Later life Prout was demobilised from the National Army in June 1924, at a time when he held the rank of Major General. General Richard Mulcahy, Commander in Chief of the Army, criticised the decision: \\"I think that is a very regrettable matter. Major-General Prout has been made the butt of an attack by a none too sober and none too industrious section here in the country and it is a most disconcerting matter that an officer of Major-General Prout's record and service during the last 18 months or two years finds himself now demobilised.\\" Tipperary IRB centre Eamon O'Dwyer's witness statement to the Irish Bureau of Military History stated: \\"The civil war disgusted him and he has been back in the USA for many years.\\" Prout returned to America and settled in New York. In 1940, he was technical advisor on the film The Fighting 69th, credited as \\"Captain John T Prout\\". Prout died in 1969 and is buried in Vermont.

He was known after he drew up plans for University of Santo Tomas (UST) Main Building, the first earthquake-shock resistant building in Asia, which was constructed at the Sulucan property of the Dominican order in city of Manila. Early life Born on August 16, 1877 in Palencia, Spain, Fr. Roque Rua√±o submitted himself in faith to the Dominican Order in 1894. He first arrived in the Philippines in July 21, 1904. Upon arrival to the country, he served his first few years in the Colegio de San Juan de Letran as Father Rector. He transferred to the University of Santo Tomas and was able to obtain a Doctorate in Civil Engineering.Hall of Fame: \\"Thomasian Engineer Journal\\", p 31.

As a proof, he was the builder of the Dominican Residences in Baguio and Lingayen, Pangasinan. His most precious project and the same time UST's pride, the UST Main Building, the first earthquake-shock resistant building in the Philippines. It is with no doubt the infrastructure was well made, it has withstood the challenges of time, from the World War II, Marcos regime to the revival of democracy and until now, history is still being made. Present studies show, the design of the Main Building is consistent with modern building code and regulation. Life at the University of Santo Tomas Fr. Rua√±o was also a professor in the then-School of Civil Engineering of the University of Santo Tomas. The subjects he handled were mineralogy, geology, and harbors and lighthouses. He also became the Dean of the College and Regent from 1930 to 1935. He was also a representative in various international conventions in Tokyo (1926), Ravenna (1931) and London (1932). Death and honor The good prelate engineer died on March 1, 1935, due to heart failure. In honor of his achievements, an edifice was named after him. It was in the corner of Espa√±a Boulevard and A. H. Lacson Avenue (formerly Gov. Forbes), at first it was called Architecture and Engineering Building. In its inauguration in 1950, the site was named after him, the Roque Rua√±o Building which houses the students and faculty members of the Faculty of Engineering and the Institute of Information and Computing Sciences.

As soon as I saw we were sixth I knew we were in. I was sitting with my parents. Then I jumped out of my seat and ran over to hug my teammates. I mean, we're making history. That is so cool. There are twenty thousand people in here. That's a lot of people. That can be intimidating. I just looked around and took it all in. I had shivers. I think everyone handled it tremendously. It could've gone a lot worse. We all have strengths and weaknesses and I think we put those aside and did it for the team. We have nothing to lose now. The worst we can be is eighth and that's still an accomplishment in itself. I know we can only go up from here because we had our struggles on beam so now we know what we need to improve on. We're just going to come out and rock (on Tuesday). This is just so amazing. I really don't have words to describe the feeling.\\" In the team final, she contributed scores of 14.866 on vault and 14.466 on uneven bars toward the Canadian team's fifth-place finish. In the vault final, Rogers placed seventh with a score of 14.483. She said, \\"I didn't get a gold medal, but it was so much fun out there.\\" 2015 In September 2015, Gymnastics Canada named Rogers to their World Championships Team. She represented Canada at the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Glasgow as a part of the Canadian team that finished in 6th place. In the team final Rogers contributed on every event except floor scoring 15.000 on vault, 13.200 on uneven bars and 13.700 on the balance beam. As of 2015 Rogers trains at the Calgary Gymnastics Centre under David Kenwright and Janna Ball. 2016 In June, Rogers continued her stellar performances throughout the Canadian Olympics team selection process to cinch her spot on a second Olympic Team.https://gymnasticscoaching.com/2016/06/29/isabela-onyshko-ellie-black- brittany-rogers/ 2016 Rio Olympics On August 7, 2016 Canada began their competition at the Rio Olympics with qualifications. Canada competed in the last (5th) subdivision starting on the balance beam. Rogers competed on beam, vault and uneven bars. Rogers hit both her beam routine and vaults. Rogers was last up for Canada on uneven bars with a spot in team finals on the line. Unfortunately she fell on her van leeuwen and Canada missed team finals by 0.168. Rogers did not qualify to any event finals. Despite a tough Olympic experience, Rogers said that she will continue competing as long as her body will allow her, and will try to make the Canadian team for the 2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, as Canada will host these Championships. She and Rio Olympic teammate Rose Woo ended up being named the alternates to these championships, with Olympians Ellie Black, Shallon Olsen and Isabela Onyshko along with first year senior Brooklyn Moors comprising the main team.

A close ally of Francisco Franco before and during the Spanish Civil War, their relationship would later become strained as Kindel√°n emerged as a leading advocate for a swift restoration of the monarchy. He belonged to the Kindel√°n family, a noted Spanish family of Irish origin. Early career Kindel√°n was a prominent figure within the Spanish Armed Forces and was founder and head of the Spanish Air Force.Paul Preston, Franco, London 1995, p. 73 A staunch supporter of the monarchy, he took voluntary exile in April 1931 rather than live in a republic.Preston, Franco, p. 73 Kindel√°n was one of the earliest collaborators of Francisco Franco, along with Jos√© Mill√°n Astray, Luis Orgaz Yoldi and the leader's brother Nicol√°s.Antony Beevor, The Battle for Spain, London, 2006, p. 379 Spanish Civil War Kindel√°n was central to the conspiracies amongst the nationalist generals and took command of the right wing of the Air Force upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.Beevor, The Battle for Spain, p. 159 In the early stages of the war he directed his operations from his place of exile in Gibraltar before returning to Spain.Beevor, The Battle for Spain, p. 151 His importance to the actual war effort in the field, as well as that of the Air Force as a whole, declined after the arrival of the Aviazione Legionaria from Fascist Italy which soon became the main air combat unit.Beevor, The Battle for Spain, p. 223 Nonetheless he remained an influential figure and an important strategist. One of Franco's most trusted aides, it was Kindel√°n who initially raised the prospect of Franco as overall commander of the Nationalist forces.Preston, Franco, p. 176 He also helped to ensure that the role came with the promise of Franco ultimately assuming the role of head of state, largely because he trusted that Franco would restore the monarchy at the earliest possible opportunity.Preston, Franco, p. 180 In terms of the conduct of the war he was central to the planning of Emilio Mola's assault on the north in March 1937, having been convinced by Juan Vig√≥n of the need for a swift resolution to the war.Preston, Franco, pp. 236-9 Franco's failure to follow this course became a bone of contention in the relationship between the two, with Kindel√°n regularly writing to Franco to plead with him to abandon his attacks on Valencia in favour of all-out war in the north.Preston, Franco, pp. 304-5 He further criticised Franco's involvement in the long-running Battle of the Ebro and suggested that his decision to commit to this rather than an attack on Barcelona added four months to the war.Preston, Franco, p. 311 Fall from grace Following the nationalist victory, Kindel√°n made it clear that he viewed Franco's regime as a regency and sought a restoration of the Alphonsine line as soon as possible.Beevor, The Battle for Spain, p. 446 Prone to criticism of Franco, whom he considered an equal rather than a superior, he was sidelined in August 1939 when he was given the role of military commander of the Balearic Islands, an effective demotion.Preston, Franco, p. 340 He was also replaced as Air Force chief in 1939 by Juan Yag√ºe in a move Franco later claimed had been done at the instigation of the Axis powers.Preston, Franco, p. 339 Kindel√°n was personally close to the United Kingdom, to such an extent that the British authorities attempted to use him to force Franco to restore the monarchy in 1942 in order to push Spain away from the Axis powers. Nothing came of the scheme however.Beevor, The Battle for Spain, p. 463 Kindel√°n enjoyed a return to favour of sorts in 1941 when he became Captain General of Catalonia, a promotion designed by Franco to improve the standing of the military as a buffer against the power of Ram√≥n Serrano S√∫√±er and the Falange.Preston, Franco, p. 432 In November 1942, when Minister of the Army Carlos Asensio Cabanillas was pushing for Spain to finally enter the war, Kindel√°n privately informed Franco that were this to happen he would personally overthrow Franco and restore the monarchy. Given that Kindel√°n enjoyed the support of a number of leading generals Franco initially did not react but after three months he removed Kindel√°n from his new position.Preston, Franco, p. 478-9 Kindel√°n then served as head of the Escuela Superior del Ej√©rcito although he was sacked from this position in August 1945 after a stinging attack on Franco in a fiercely pro-monarchist speech.Preston, Franco, p. 543 Meanwhile, his memoirs were delayed until 1945 and even then were censored due to a passage of fairly restrained criticism dealing with Franco's conduct of the war in the north.Preston, Franco, p. 281 Later years Removed from influence, Kindel√°n was free to devote his time to the various upper class conspiracies designed to ensure the restoration of Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona to the Spanish throne. When in 1946 the so-called 'Lausanne manifesto' was published calling for immediate restoration, Franco identified Kindel√°n as being the ringleader of those who had signed the document and ordered his imprisonment. Following an appeal to Franco by Fidel D√°vila Arrondo on the grounds of Kindel√°n's strong service record and his advancing age El Caudillo relented and instead sent Kindel√°n into exile in the Canary Islands.Preston, Franco, p. 551 In 1961, Kindel√°n was ennobled as a Marqu√©s, although the gesture was interpreted as an ironic joke on the part of Franco, mocking the fact that, despite all his efforts, Kindel√°n was still not living in the monarchy that he so desired.Preston, Franco, p. 573 He died the following year with Spain still under Franco.

Islands account for nearly 1/6 of earth‚Äôs total land area,Paulay, G. 1994. Biodiversity on Oceanic Islands: Its Origin and Extinction. American Zoology 34: 134-144. yet the ecology of island ecosystems is vastly different from that of mainland communities. Their isolation and high availability of empty niches lead to increased speciation. As a result, island ecosystems comprise 30% of the world‚Äôs biodiversity hotspots, 50% of marine tropical diversity, and some of the most unusual and rare species.Gerlach, Justin. 2008. Island biodiversity - issues and opportunities . World Conservation Congress Many species still remain unknown. The diversity of species on islands is highly impacted by human activities such as deforestation and introduction of the exotic species. In response, ecologists and managers are directing attention towards conservation and restoration of island species. Because they are simple systems, islands provide an opportunity to study processes of extinction that can be extrapolated to larger ecosystems.  Ecological processes on islands  Islands are attractive sites for ecological research because they provide clear examples of evolution in action. They show interesting patterns of colonization, adaptation, and speciation. Colonization and establishment Islands are surrounded by water, and may or may not exist as part of a continental land mass. Oceanic islands arise due to volcanic activity or reef growth, and usually subside over time due to erosion and changing sea levels. When islands emerge, they undergo the process of ecological succession as species colonize the island (see theory of island biogeography). New species cannot immigrate via land, and instead must arrive via air, water, or wind. As a result, organisms with high dispersal capabilities, such as plants and birds, are much more common on islands than are poorly dispersing taxa like mammals. However, some mammals are present on islands, presumably from swimming or riding on natural ‚Äúrafts‚Äù that are washed away from the mainland. Of the species that arrive, only some will be able to survive and establish populations. As a result, islands have fewer species than mainland habitats. Island populations are small and exhibit low genetic variability (see founder effect), but are isolated from the predators and competitors that they initially evolved with. This can lead to a process called ecological release, where a species is released from its ancestral community interactions and then colonizes new niches. Adaptation In response to these changing ecological pressures, island species can become much more docile than their mainland counterparts, and may grow larger (see island gigantism) or smaller (see island dwarfism). Some of these unique adaptations are reflected in charismatic island species such as the giant tortoise, Komodo dragon, or pygmy mammoths. The Komodo dragon is an example of island gigantism. After immigration, birds, and some reptiles or mammals, tend to become larger and predatory,Alcover, J. A. and M. McMinn. 1994. Predators of Vertebrates on Islands. BioScience 44(1): 12-18. showing relaxed intraspecific competition.Stamps, J.A. and M. Buechner. 1985. The Territorial Defense Hypothesis and the Ecology of Insular Vertebrates. The Quarterly Review of Biology 60(2): 155-181. For mammals, small species will increase in size and large species will decrease in size.Van Valen, L.M. 1973. Pattern and the Balance of Nature. Evolutionary Theory 1: 31‚àí49. This is referred to as the ‚Äúisland rule,‚Äù and is suggested to minimize energy expenditure.McNab, B.K. 2002. Minimizing energy expenditure facilitates vertebrate persistence on oceanic islands. Ecology Letters 5(5): 693-704. Other adaptations to life on islands include increased poikilothermy, relaxed anti-predator behavior,Blumstein, D.T. 2002.

Speciation The formation of new islands and their isolation from the mainland provides many unoccupied niches for species to adapt to. Since immigration of predators and competitors is limited, many organisms are able to persist in these new niches. This results in a high occurrence of endemism, where species are unique to a localized area. For example, 50% of endemic bird areas are found on islands. Endemism is often the result of adaptive radiation. Adaptive radiation is when a single specie colonizes an area and rapidly diversifies to fill all of the available niches. A common example is the assemblage of finch species documented by Charles Darwin in the Galapagos Islands. Darwin‚Äôs finches exhibited adaptive radiation by evolving different beak sizes to exploit the diversity of seeds present on the different islands. The palila, one of several endangered honeycreepers that evolved through adaptive radiation and are endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. Because the distributions of these populations are limited by their island habitats, they tend to have fewer individuals than their mainland counterparts and lower genetic variation. This, along with the behavioral and ecological factors mentioned above, makes island species more vulnerable to extinction. Survival The continued survival of species on islands depends on factors such as natural selection, genetic variation, natural disturbances (hurricanes, volcanic eruptions) and human-caused disturbances (introduced species, habitat loss). Human-caused disturbances tend to be the greatest cause of mortality, and understanding the causes of extinction facilitates conservation efforts.  Human impacts on island ecosystems  The movement of humans to islands has led to rapid extinction of native island species either from hunting, habitat destruction, or introduced species. Hunting Many large animals on islands have been hunted to extinction by humans. A well-known example is the dodo, once found on the island of Mauritius. It evolved to become large, flightless and docile, and was subsequently driven to extinction by humans and introduced predators. Habitat destruction The depletion of natural resources can have dramatic effects on island ecology. On Easter Island, the depletion of the forest by humans not only resulted in widespread loss of species, but also the collapse of the island civilization.Bahn, P and J. Flenley. 1992. Easter Island, Earth Island. Thames and Hudson, London. Easter Island has been a site of dramatic ecological change. Today there are over 500 million people on islands, all dependent on local resources either directly (traditional use) or indirectly (ecotourism revenue). Population growth and development result in heavy deforestation, pollution, and over-exploitation. Overharvesting of ocean fauna is particularly troubling as yields of coral reef fish species are an important food source for island populations. Introduced species Humans have contributed to globalization and decreased effective isolation of island communities, allowing for invasion of exotic species. This can have a profound effect on the native species. In Guam, the introduced brown tree snake ate nearly all of the native vertebrate species to extinction. Feral cats and dogs have also greatly diminished native vertebrate populations on islands, through both predation and disease. Introduced ungulates are another major threat, as they graze on native vegetation and can destroy entire forests.Towns, D.R. and W.J. Ballantine. 1993. Conservation and Restoration of New Zealand Island Ecosystems. Trends in Evolution and Ecology 8(12): 452-457. Exotic grasses can out-compete native understory species and increase the risk of fire.D‚ÄôAntonio, C.M. and P.M. Vitousek. 1992. Biological Invasions by Exotic Grasses, the Grass/Fire Cycle, and Global Change. Annual Review of Ecological Systematics 23: 63-87. Lastly, social insects such as ants also cause major problems.Cole, F. R., A.C. Medeiros, L.L. Loope, and W.W. Zuehlke. 1992. Effects of the Argentine ant on arthropod fauna of Hawaiian high-elevation shrubland. Ecology 73: 1313-1322. Global warming Global warming is emerging as a strong cause of species loss on islands. This can be due to sea level rise, the intrusion of salt water into freshwater habitats, or species inability to adapt to increasing temperatures and extreme weather events. Plant species are particularly susceptible.Kreft, H., W. Jetz, J. Mutke, G. Kier, and W. Barthlott. 2008. Global diversity of island floras from a macroecological perspective. Ecology Letters 11(2): 116-127. In more isolated areas, such as the Southern Ocean Islands, indirect effects such as invasive species and global warming can play a greater role in influencing populations than overexploitation, pollution and habitat loss.Chown, S.L., J.E. Lee, and J.D. Shaw. 2008. Conservation of Southern Ocean Islands: Invertebrates as exemplars. Journal of Insect Conservation 12(4): 277-291.Sea level rise is a pressing concern for many island people. Trophic cascades Human activities and the introduction of non-native species often cause trophic cascades, where direct effects on one species result in indirect effects on other species in the food web. An example is on Santa Cruz Island of the California Channel Islands, where DDT poisoning reduced bald eagle populations. This, along with an abundance of introduced feral pigs for prey, allowed golden eagles to colonize the island and replace bald eagles. However, the golden eagles also ate native island foxes. Fox population levels decreased to near extinction, while skunk populations increased due to relaxed competition with foxes.  Island conservation   Conservation on islands  Since island ecosystems are self-contained, it should be possible to mitigate many of the threats to species. Ecologists and managers are working together to prioritize areas for conservation and to quickly design and implement action plans. Not everything can be put into a reserve, so it is important to first compile pertinent information and prioritize areas of concern.Kepler, C.B. and J.M. Scott. 1985. Conservation of Island Ecosystems. ICBP Technical Publication Number 3: 255-271. Once an area has been chosen, managers must then acquire ownership and gain support. Local experts and indigenous populations should also be involved in this process. Having clearly defined goals will facilitate the many necessary interactions between people and agencies. Once a reserve is in place, managers can then practice adaptive management and do continued community education. On land, island conservation focuses on the protection of species and their habitat. In some cases, conservation can be integrated with agricultural production. For example, the Acacia koa plantations and wooded pastures in Hawaii are anthropogenically altered ecosystems, yet allow connectivity between forest fragments and thus maintain higher diversity than would open pasture.Goldman, R.L., L.P. Goldstein, and G.C. Daily. 2008. Assessing the conservation value of a human- dominated island landscape: Plant diversity in Hawaii. Biodiversity and Conservation 17(7): 1765-1781. Other directions include habitat restoration, and eradication of introduced predators, ungulates, and exotic plants (via hunting, removal or biological control). In marine ecosystems, there has been an increasing establishment of ‚Äúno-take‚Äù reserves. This allows for the reestablishment of native species, and also the augmentation of commercially harvested species.Towns, D.R. and W.J. Ballantine. 1993. Conservation and Restoration of New Zealand Island Ecosystems. Trends in Evolution and Ecology 8(12): 452-457. However, in both terrestrial and marine systems, these actions are expensive and do not always result in the desired outcomes. For example, some non-natives become keystone species and their removal can cause more harm than good to the ecosystem. To be more effective, managers of island ecosystems should share information and learn from each other‚Äôs mistakes.Cronk, Q.C.B. 1997. Islands: stability, diversity, conservation. Biodiversity and Conservation 6: 477-493. Lobster benefit greatly from the establishment of no-take zones on islands such as Great Britain, New Zealand, and Tonga.  Island restoration  Island conservation tends to focus on preservation of individual species and their habitats. However, many ecologists caution that ecological and evolutionary processes should be conserved as well. The conservation of island communities as a whole is closely linked to restoration. Active restoration on islands can be done for both animal species (translocations, induced breeding) and plant species (reforestation). Creating goals for restoration can be challenging because it is often impossible to restore the ecosystem to its ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù or ‚Äúnormal‚Äù state, if that state can even be clearly defined. Restoration is never complete, as ecological communities are always in a state of change.  Sustainable use  As resource depletion is a major issue on islands, the needs of human populations must also be taken into account. On many islands, scientists and managers are studying traditional practices of indigenous populations as potential conservation solutions. In some cases, limited-take systems that serve the community may provide a better alternative to fully closed protected areas, if there are not enough resources for proper enforcement.Cinner, J.E., M.J. Marnane, and T.R. McClanahan. 2005. Conservation and community benefits from traditional coral reef management at Ahus Island, Papua New Guinea. Conservation Biology 19(6): 1714-1723. Public education plays an important role.

Founded in the city of Guayaquil, it went bankrupt in 2001 following the banking crisis of 1998.El Universo. Temas pendientes, pese a sentencia en el caso Filanbanco. Retrieved 6 October 2013. Beginnings Old Filanbanco building in Quito. The bank was originally called La Filantr√≥pica (The Philanthropist). Under the leadership of Pedro Isa√≠as Barquet, La Filantr√≥pica promoted the development of small industry, commerce, and agriculture, and became established as a strong and solvent financial institution. At the time of Isa√≠as Barquet's death in 1960, the family decided to save the bank and inject it with capital. It was acquired in 1960 by the Isa√≠as Group (Grupo Isa√≠as), who decided to change its name to Filanbanco. They injected capital into the bank, aiming to provide Guayaquil with a bank that would further the expansion of the commercial and agricultural sector of the Littoral Region, whose trade in products like bananas and cacao was booming. The bank belonged to the Isa√≠as family for three generations. Crisis During the 1998-1999 economic crisis, over 20 banks in Ecuador became insolvent. The government, however, focused all its blame for the crisis on the Isaias brothers and Filanbanco, which had close political ties to the opposition party. Due to changes made to regulations, Filanbanco was converted into a \\"central bank\\" after the government took over ownership. As such, Filanbanco had to absorb all other failing banks and that was the main reason for its closure in 2001, over three years under ownership and management by the Ecuadorian government. At the end of the financial crisis, the Ecuadorian government assumed control of Filanbanco, which it eventually closed down in 2001. The bank crisis (‚ÄúCrisis Bancaria‚Äù) started after the government of Ecuador took over and became the sole owner of Filanbanco. None of the Isaias brothers had any control over bank operation after that date.  Beginning of the 1998-1999 economic crisis  At the end of the nineties, Ecuador went through external and internal problems with its economy. The loss of the manufacturing sector in general had a severe impact on the financial system. Ecuadorian banking suffered a serious crisis from 1998 to 1999, when nearly all banks requested liquidity credits from the Central Bank of Ecuador (ECB). These loans were granted by the ECB in 1998 and were based on solvency. ECB certified the solvency of Filanbanco and approved the bank for access to stabilization loans.\\"Pacto Internacional de Derechos Civiles y Pol√≠ticos.\\" (in Spanish) United Nations Committee on Human Rights. 2016-06-03. (UN publication number CCPR/C/116/D/2244/2013). Only three years after assuming control of Filanbanco, the government shut it down. In 2002, the government took steps to liquidate the bank, but the process was extremely slow. At the time of its closure, the bank had a $950 million loan portfolio.  Controversial \\"bank embezzlement\\" charges  As the bank began to rapidly lose money while it was under government control (a report issued during the time that the state owned and ran Filanbanco revealed that the bank had lost 814 million dollars during the period in which it was managed by the government), the government blamed the Isaias brothers, and began to scapegoat the two men. In June 2000, the Ecuadorian Attorney General Falconi Puig charged the Isaias brothers with \\"bank embezzlement.\\" Up until the charges were filed, such a crime didn't exist in the country. The government quickly and quietly added it to the penal code and then filed the charges. The bank embezzlement charges were controversial. For example, the manager of the Central Bank of Ecuador told the Attorney General that there had been no misuse of funds while Filanbanco was under control of the Isaias Group, and charges were filed anyway. By 2004, the issue had reached the country's Supreme Court. However, then-president Lucio Gutierrez, hearing rumors that the Supreme Court might rule in favor of the Isaias brothers, dismissed every judge on the Supreme Court. (Gutierrez was ‚Äúpolitically crippled and on the brink of removal from office‚Äù before he dismissed the court). Three years after the government began investigating the Isaias for the alleged bank embezzlement, the Chief Prosecutor of Ecuador declared that there was no bank embezzlement. His conclusion was ignored by the government.  President Rafael Correa and the seizures of over 150 companies  The issue was quiet for several years until 2007, when Rafael Correa began as president of Ecuador after winning as a left-wing economist. As soon as he took office, he formed a new committee, which he highly publicized, to investigate the Filanbanco ‚Äúbank robbery‚Äù of 1998-1999. Even before the investigation began, Correa repeatedly used the term ‚Äúcorrupt bankers‚Äù when referring to Filanbanco‚Äôs owners, the Isaias‚Äô. In 2008, on Correa's orders, the Ecuadorian government seized over 150 Isaias Group companies \\"under false pretenses.\\" The stated purpose that the government gave was that it was attempting to compensate account holders of the bank Filanbanco. Among the companies seized were media companies owned by the Isaias brothers, including prominent media outlets TC Television, Gamavision, and Cablevision. The Isaias Group‚Äôs TV channels captured 40 percent of the nation‚Äôs evening news audience. After seizing the companies, Correa appointed close friends and political allies to run the businesses. El Telegrafo, a prominent newspaper that the state had seized, was seized for the official reason of selling it off and using the money to pay back Filanbanco account holders who had lost money. Instead, the government kept the newspaper and made it an official government public newspaper. Although the stated purpose of the seizures was the liquidate the companies and use the proceeds to pay back Filanbanco account holders, the government kept ownership of the companies. Within years, the performance of the companies rapidly deteriorated and most were heavily devalued.

The former dockland area used to house heavy industry. While some industry activities remain in the area, but since most industry left the area, starting in the 1970s, it has undergone massive redevelopment, though some industrial activities remain, most notably MAN B&W; Diesel's motor development plant. Today the area houses both a considerable number of Danish and regional headquarters of multinational companies and residential developments. Teglholmen is home to Aalborg University's AAU Cph Campus as well as TV 2's activities in Copenhagen. History Teglholmen takes its name from a tile works which established in the area in 1871, for many years supplying particularly Vesterbro with tiles. Around World War I, the tile works closed and the extensive clay pit was turned into a new harbour basin by connecting it to the main harbour, forming what is today known as Teglv√¶rkshavnen, separating Teglholmen from Sluseholmen. The next generation of companies to establish in the area were shipyards, foundries and a car assembly plant. In the 1970s, the industrial activities in the Teglholmen area started to close and from the end of the 1990s, a number of multinational companies started to establish Danish or Regional headquarters at Teglv√¶rkshavnen.

She was instrumental in helping to register many African-American voters in Selma, Alabama, and was one of the primary local organizers of the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965. She was called \\"the mother of the voting rights movement\\" and was nicknamed Mother Foster. Early life and work Marie Martin was born in 1917 in Wilcox County, Alabama. She was a dental assistant when she became involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  Civil Rights Movement  Voter registration Foster became interested in the Civil Rights Movement in the early 1960s because she felt \\"the race relations were so bad in Selma\\". She was part of the revival of the Dallas County Voters League, a group of African Americans that pushed for improvements in the system for voter registration and belonged to its eight-member steering committee, known as the \\"Courageous Eight\\". She tried to register to vote eight times before succeeding. Following her successful registration, Foster began teaching other African Americans how to pass the tests used to bar them. One person showed up to her first class, in which she taught the 70-year-old man how to write his own name. Gradually, the classes drew more and more people. Marches As the Civil Rights Movement grew, Foster became an organizer for the Dallas County area. She participated in the march on March 7, 1965, that became known as Bloody Sunday. As the march approached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, a combined state trooper and police force stopped the march, violently beating many of the participants. Foster was at the front of one of the lines along with Amelia Boynton, and was clubbed by a state trooper, leaving her with swollen knees. Despite her injuries, two weeks later Foster participated in the march that eventually made it all the way to Montgomery, Alabama, successfully walking fifty miles over five days. She was one of the two women to complete it. Martin Luther King, Jr. learned that Lyndon B. Johnson would sign the Voting Rights Act when he was at Foster's house. He is said to have cried at the news while with Foster. Later life and legacy After the Voting Rights Act was passed, Foster continued to work as a dental assistant. In 1984, Foster worked on Rev. Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign. In her free time, she taught children how to read. She carried on campaigning, fighting for public housing of the poor in Selma, conduct of white bus drivers or asking for the statue of the Klan founder to be taken away from a public park. She helped to found the National Voting Rights Museum and Institute. She fought many mayoral elections to replace the major of Selma Joseph Smitherman who was in office during the Selma to Montgomery marches. She died on September 6, 2003. She is buried at Serenity Memorial Gardens in Selma, Alabama. Foster was posthumously named an honoree by the National Women's History Alliance in 2020.

His research and publications have been funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Associated Medical Services. In 2011, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. He is the brother of Canadian sports broadcaster and author Bruce Dowbiggin. Euthanasia Dowbiggin has written on the history of the euthanasia movement, including A Merciful End: The Euthanasia Movement in Modern America (2003) and A Concise History of Euthanasia: Life, Death, God, and Medicine (2005). He links the rise of euthanasia to an intellectual shift that took place in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, away from the moral precepts of the Judeo-Christian tradition. One important cause of this shift was social Darwinism, which had questioned the right of the \\"unfit\\" ‚Äì such as the mentally handicapped ‚Äì to live. Along with other intellectual currents such as social progressivism and Unitarianism, this led physicians and people like the founder of the Euthanasia Society of America, Charles Francis Potter, to accept the practice of euthanasia. Dowbiggin, a Catholic, points out that the Catholic Church \\"unequivocally opposed\\" sterilization and euthanasia programs, even before the advent of the Nazi euthanasia program, and that the Church is not given credit for that stance. According to a review of A Concise History of Euthanasia by Sandra Woien in the American Journal of Bioethics, Dowbiggin sees euthanasia and eugenics as the inevitable results of abandoning the moral guidance of religion in medicine. Woien found that the book overemphasised the relationship between eugenics and euthanasia, and muddied \\"important conceptual and practical distinctions\\", but allowed that it may be \\"useful in understanding the historical context of euthanasia.\\" The Canadian Historical Association awarded Dowbiggin the Wallace K. Ferguson Prize for A Merciful End, stating that the book \\"gives a clear and evenly-balanced study of the history of euthanasia in the United States since the latter part of the nineteenth century\\", and concluded that it overall is a \\"masterful explanation of the way in which changing social, economic and disease-related factors have affected public interest in euthanasia.\\" Dowbiggin has spoken against euthanasia legislation and said that the Netherlands exists as a \\"cautionary lesson\\" for Canada in particular, showing that those places that \\"take a permissive attitude to assisted suicide keep pushing the boundaries.\\" Sterilization Dowbiggin published the book The Sterilization Movement and Global Fertility in the Twentieth Century in 2008. Drawing on scholarly sources, the book is primarily an account of sterilization as used for the purposes of eugenics and population control, examples including the use of sterilization by European fascists and the Indian mass sterilization program carried out during the 1975‚Äì1977 Emergency in India, which contributed to the downfall of Indira Gandhi's government. Ulf H√∂gberg, guest researcher of Public Health and Clinical Medicine at Ume√• University, argued in the European Journal of Public Health that, \\"The book is most impressive, finely tuning the history between choice and compulsion of sterilization policy; sometimes it has been a fine line in between, sometimes an abyss of abuse of human rights.\\" A review in The New England Journal of Medicine, by Carolyn Westhoff, an official of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, summed up by agreeing with the book's conclusion that \\"advocacy of sterilization as a solution to population growth leads to serious problems when that agenda overrides individual values and individual autonomy\\", but differed from it in stating that \\"Voluntary sterilization, however, deserves its great popularity and will remain valuable as one part of a broader menu of options for family planning.\\" Partial bibliography * The Quest for Mental Health: A Tale of Science, Medicine, Scandal, Sorrow, and Mass Society (2011) * A Concise History of Euthanasia: Life, Death, God, and Medicine (2005) * A Merciful End: The Euthanasia Movement in Modern America (2003) * Suspicious Minds: The Triumph of Paranoia in Everyday Life (1999) * Keeping America Sane: Psychiatry and Eugenics in the United States and Canada, 1880-1940 (1997) * Inheriting Madness: Professionalization and Psychiatric Knowledge in 19th Century France (1991) Personal life Dowbiggin is one of five sons born to Mary and Bill Dowbiggin in Montreal.

Severe inflation and devaluation of the Ecuadorian sucre lead to President Jamil Mahuad announcing on January 9, 2000 that the US dollar would be adopted as the national currency. Poor economic conditions and subsequent protests against the government resulted in the 2000 Ecuadoran coup d‚Äô√©tat in which Jamil Mahuad was forced to resign and was replaced by his Vice President, Gustavo Noboa.  Background  Throughout the 20th century, Ecuador was one of the poorer countries in Latin America, and had high rates of poverty and income inequality compared to other countries in the region. By the late 1990s around 45% of the population lived below the national poverty line, making them especially vulnerable. The discovery of oil in the 1960s lead to rapid economic growth, but created an economy that was dependent on exports of oil and agricultural products such as bananas, coffee, and shrimp. Lower oil prices resulted in economic stagnation throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, as oil exports alone accounted for half of the country's total exports and about a third of all government revenue in the late 1990s. Ecuador's population and economy can be geographically divided into three general regions: the Pacific coastal region in the west, the central Andean highlands, and the eastern Amazonian regions. 95% of the population lives on the coast or the central highlands, and accounts for the majority of Ecuador's economic activity. The Amazonian regions are mostly populated by indigenous people who are generally poorer, despite the fact that the Amazon contains Ecuador's significant oil reserves. Across all three regions, poverty is much worse in rural areas than in urban areas. Ecuador's social and economic inequalities have contributed to internal tensions and political divides on a national level, which became evident during the government's response to the financial crisis.  Causes  In 2010, author and professor Alberto Valencia Granada published a book called When Success is a Crime: Filanbanco: A Case of Violation of Human Rights in Ecuador. His book summarizes the causes of the financial crisis: > In the late 1990s, Ecuador (and the entire region) experienced capital > flight following the East Asian and Russian crises. Ecuador then experienced > a political-economic crisis that was aggravated by many factors: military > confrontation with Peru, lack of sufficient hydroelectric energy production > (due to low water levels), and difficulties in the agricultural sector > because of the El Ni√±o weather phenomenon. These factors together deepened > the political crisis in the country ‚Äî a time period that saw four presidents > within eight years. The biggest victims of the economic crisis were the > agricultural export industry located along the coasts, which were > Filanbanco‚Äôs principle credit recipients. Lack of payments from these > customers, combined with restrictions on opening new lines of international > credit, squeezed the bank. Thus, the bank turned to other companies within > the Isaias Group for cash along with liquidity loans from the Central > Bank.https://www.amazon.com/When-Success-Crime-Violation- > Ecuador/dp/1514220741 Structural weaknesses in Ecuador  Economic conditions in Ecuador allowed the development of a weak financial system which was more vulnerable to disruptions. The financial sector was also affected by the regional fragmentation between policy makers in the capital, Quito, and banks based in the port city of Guayaquil, the most populous city and economic centre of the country in 1999. Financial liberalization policies had been adopted in the early 1990s by conservative president Sixto Dur√°n-Ball√©n and his vice president Alberto Dahik (widely considered the economic tsar of the government and mastermind of neoliberal policies),https://books.google.com.ec/books?id=16U5HjdGYjsC&pg;=PA229&lpg;=PA229&dq;=dahik+ecuador+neoliberalism&source;=bl&ots;=tEqmXsATab&sig;=XKwndrl2qdC70YV2CLIRh76Uru8&hl;=es&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjikZ_UlP3aAhWEzVkKHecdCUg4FBDoATAHegQIBhAB#v=onepage&q;=dahik%20ecuador%20neoliberalism&f;=false P. 229 allowing easier access to international markets and investors, but they also created a largely deregulated domestic financial sector. Many Ecuadoran banks were well connected to prominent business groups and politicians, and financial supervision and regulation was not strongly enforced. As a result, Ecuadoran banks experienced a credit boom in the 1990s, providing high-risk loans to well-connected customers, assuming that the government and Central Bank would bail them out if needed. Lack of oversight also allowed many banks to engage in lucrative but risky offshore banking in U.S. dollar denominations, creating an informal dollarization of the financial sector, and a vulnerability to fluctuations in the exchange rate.  Shocks and vulnerability  Ecuador's public finances in the 1990s were heavily dependent on oil revenue, and public spending was high. In the short term, the financial crisis was triggered by a series of external shocks. A severe El Ni√±o in 1997-1998 caused heavy rains and flooding that caused widespread crop failures and damaged infrastructure costing approximately 13% of its GDP. These shocks occurred soon after several financial crises in Asia (1997), Russia (1998), and Brazil (1998), which were damaging to the world economy. In this context, global financial institutions were more reluctant to offer credit lines to Ecuador and other developing countries. Oil prices plunged in 1998, partly in response to global economic slowdown following the Asian financial crisis, which significantly reduced the government's revenues. These shocks created a situation where the public deficit grew uncontrollably, as the government had to recover from El Ni√±o damage, but had restricted access to oil revenues and international financing. For example, the public sector deficit increased from 2.6% of GDP in 1997 to 6.2% in 1998. Ecuador was also undergoing a period of political vulnerability in the 1990s. The fragmentation and divided politics of the country resulted in a relatively weak state throughout the 1990s, which never gained widespread support. Populist president Abdal√° Bucaram, known as \\"El Loco\\", was declared mentally unfit by Congress and fled after nation-wide protests in 1997, and an interim government under Fabi√°n Alarc√≥n was in power until Jamil Mahuad was elected in 1998, just as the banking crisis was developing.  Crisis and government response  The financial crisis began in the context of increasing public debt and poor economic performance on a national level. In the private financial sector, banks had given out excessively risky loans, and were struggling to maintain liquidity. The banking crisis started in April 1998 with the failure of a small bank, but the ensuing atmosphere of uncertainty caused excessive withdrawals and triggered more bank failures throughout 1998. By August, important bank failures had reached the point where the government could no longer intervene by bailing out and supporting struggling banks. By December, the \\"AGD law\\" (Agencia de Garant√≠a de Dep√≥sitos) set up deposit insurance, in an attempt to discourage further withdrawals. Another law starting in January 1999 established a 1% tax on any financial transactions, which would discourage withdrawals and raise revenue for the struggling government. However, this tax proved devastating for both the financial system and ordinary people as it discouraged all financial activity and did not prevent deposit withdrawals. Other proposed government policies included increases in general sales taxes and gasoline taxes. By early 1999, major banks were failing and being taken over and closed by the AGD, while still providing a deposit guarantee. Increasing consumer prices and the depreciation of the Sucre raised fears of hyperinflation, and in March 1999 the government declared a national bank holiday, which ended up lasting a full week from March 8‚Äì12. At the end of the holiday, the government announced a widespread deposit freeze in which deposits would be frozen for a full year. This did temporarily slow inflation, but it caused the collapse of trust in the banking system and poor economic conditions. Throughout 1999, the government did gradually unfreeze deposits, but this was followed by widespread withdrawals and more bank failure, due to a lack of confidence in the banks. By September, the government itself had defaulted on external debts as it had spent significant resources supporting the central bank and its deposit guarantees.  Economic effects   Dollarization  Despite the government's efforts to curb inflation, the Sucre depreciated rapidly at the end of 1999, resulting in widespread informal use of U.S. dollars in the financial system. As a last resort to prevent hyperinflation, the government formally adopted the U.S. dollar in January 2000. The stability of the new currency was a necessary first step towards economic recovery, but the exchange rate was fixed at 25,000:1, which resulted in great losses of wealth.  Poverty and living conditions  The severe effects of the financial crisis were especially visible in Ecuador because of the preexisting problems of poverty and national inequality. The general economic uncertainty resulted in loss of jobs and wealth, which had the most significant effect on people who were already vulnerable. The government was financially limited due to its debt defaults, and had to focus on macroeconomic solutions rather than the social problems that developed during the financial crisis. Measures of poverty, including extreme poverty and the poverty gap, all increased during the crisis and peaked in 1999. Rural areas were especially affected, and metrics such as worse child nutrition, reduced educational spending, and poor health outcomes all showed that the financial crisis had severe effects. An estimated 200,000 Ecuadorans also left the country between 1998 and 2000, representing 2% of the labor force.  Political effects  President Jamil Mahuad suffered declining popularity ratings throughout the financial crisis, decreasing from 60% in 1998 to 6% in early 2000. The dollarization policy proved to be particularly unpopular even if it was implemented successfully. Protests led by a coalition of indigenous peoples (CONAIE) and supported by the military occupied congress and forced President Mahuad to resign.  Social effects   Migration to the United States  The Ecuadoran financial crisis caused massive migrations, primarily to the United States and Spain. Between the years 1999 and 2000, approximately 400,000 Ecuadorans migrated to the United States. This was not the first wave of Ecuadoran migration to the U.S., and so this wave of migrants joined roughly half a million other Ecuadorans who had already paved the way for migration. Most Ecuadorans who migrated to the U.S. as a result of the Ecuadoran financial crisis were from the regions of Azuay and Ca√±ar. The largest community of Ecuadorans in the U.S. resides in the New York metropolitan area. Half of the Ecuadoran diaspora is within the United States. Ecuadoran migration to the US has become increasingly transnational in nature. This is due in part to remittances sent back to communities in Ecuador by migrant communities in the US. The sending of these remittances facilitates a continuous connection between migrants and those at home, which in turn facilitates further migration. Remittances to Ecuador were at around $643 million in 1997, and increased $1.41 billion in 2001 which highlights the sudden impact emigration had on Ecuador.  Migration to Spain  The majority of Ecuadorians migrated to Spain in search of financial opportunity, as Spain's economy had been flourishing. Around 7,000 Ecuadorians arrived to Spain each month in 2000. This early wave left Ecuador during the hardest part of the economic crisis and was composed of young people eager to work. By 2005, the Ecuadorian community in Spain was around 500,000 people. During the period until 2004, the migrants were mainly composed family members joining those who had first migrated. The Ecuadorian diaspora in Spain differs from the U.S. one in that Ecuadorians experienced greater economic prosperity in Spain. They sent up to 46% of their salary, 16% invested in improving living conditions for their families back in Ecuador.

It is an unaccredited remake of Jacques Deval's novel \\"Marie Galante\\", produced by 20th Century Fox in 1934, directed by Henry King. Plot Charlie Chan must stop a spy from destroying the Panama Canal, trapping a Navy fleet on its way to the Pacific after maneuvers in the Atlantic. As the U.S. fleet prepares to navigate the waters of the Panama Canal, Panama City becomes rife with spies. A new group of suspects appears with the arrival of a sea plane bound for Balboa. Among the suspects are novelist Clivedon Compton, matronly school teacher Miss Jennie Finch, sinister scientist Dr. Rudolph Grosser, caf√© proprietor Manolo, singer Kathi Lenesch (real name Kathi von Tzardas), cigarette salesman Achmed Halide, government engineer Richard Cabot and government agent Godley. Upon landing, Godley goes to a hat shop owned by Fu Yuen, alias Charlie Chan, to enlist the sleuth's help in unmasking the deadly spy known only as Reiner. Just as Godley is about to divulge Reiner's real identity, he falls to the ground, dead, leaving Chan to expose Reiner before the spy can sabotage the canal. As the other suspects are murdered, one by one, first Compton, then Manolo, Chan learns that the canal's Miraflores locks are to be blown up at ten that night. Chan then sequesters the suspects at the plant, forcing Miss Finch to expose herself as Reiner in order to escape death. With Reiner under arrest, the fleet sails safely through the locks to protect democracy.

The device was announced in the United States in October 2009 and was released the next month. The Nook includes Wi-Fi and AT&T; 3G wireless connectivity, a six-inch E Ink display, and a separate, smaller color touchscreen that serves as the primary input device. In June 2010 Barnes & Noble announced a Wi-Fi-only model of the Nook. On June 5, 2018 Barnes and Noble announced support for logging in to BN.com and adding new content to the device will end on June 29, 2018. The second-generation Nook, the Nook Simple Touch, was announced May 25, 2011 with a June 10 release date. History  3G + Wi-Fi version  This version made its debut on November 22, 2009, at a retail price of $259 and comes with built-in 3G + Wi-Fi connectivity for free access to the Barnes and Noble online store. The price was reduced to $199 on June 21, 2010, upon the release of the new Nook Wi-Fi. The final price drop was made on May 25, 2011, to a closeout price of $169 at the same time of the announcement of the new Nook, named the Nook Simple Touch.  Wi-Fi version  This version made its debut on June 21, 2010, at a retail price of $149. It is a version of the Nook 1st Edition that supports Wi-Fi only and not 3G Wireless, and it was launched with firmware version 1.4 preinstalled. It is physically easily distinguishable from the 3G + Wi-fi gray-backed version, due to its white back color. A price reduction was made on May 25, 2011, dropping to a closeout price of $119 in accord with the announcement of the new Nook, named the Nook Simple Touch Reader. Features The original Nook provides a black-and-white electronic ink (e ink) display for viewing digital content with most navigation and additional content provided through a color touchscreen. Pages are turned using arrow buttons on each side of the Nook or by making swipe gesture on touch screen. The original Nook connects to Barnes and Noble's digital store through a free connection to AT&T;'s 3G network or through available Wi-Fi connections. Users can read books without a wireless connection; disconnecting the wireless connection can extend the battery's charge to up to ten days. The device has a MicroSD expansion slot for extra storage and a user-replaceable rechargeable battery. The battery can be charged through either an AC adapter or a micro-USB 2.0 cable, both included with new Nooks. The device also includes a web browser, a built-in dictionary, Chess and Sudoku, an audio player, speakers, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Supported ebook file-formats with DRM include: * eReader PDB with Barnes & Noble's eReader DRM, sometimes called Secure eReader format (original Nook only) * EPUB with Barnes & Noble's eReader DRM, used for ebooks downloaded wirelessly to the Nook * EPUB with Adobe ADEPT DRM, sometimes called Adobe EPUB or Adobe Digital Editions format * PDF with Adobe ADEPT DRM (however, figures and equations will not appear) The EPUB with eReader DRM combination is a new format created for the Nook. Adobe has undertaken to include support for that combination in future releases of Adobe Acrobat mobile software, to allow other reader devices to support that format. Supported ebook file formats without DRM include: * EPUB * eReader PDB (original Nook only) * PDF, including password-protected PDF but not Vitrium-protected PDF Supported sound file formats for music and audiobooks include MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, but not WMA. Only the original Nook and the Nook Color support sound files. Nook supports image file formats JPG, GIF, PNG, and BMP, used for book cover thumbnails, wallpapers, and screen savers. The Nook provides a \\"LendMe\\" feature allowing users to share some books with other people, depending on licensing by the book's publisher. The buyer is permitted to share a book once with one other user for up to two weeks. Users will be able to share purchased books with others who are using Barnes & Noble's reader application software for Android, BlackBerry, iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, Mac OS X, and Windows and others. The Nook system recognizes physical Barnes & Noble stores. Customers using the Nook in Barnes & Noble stores receive access to special content and offers while the device is connected to the store's Wi-Fi. Further, most e-Books in the catalog can be read for up to an hour while connected to the store Wi-Fi network with the 1.3 software update. Because Barnes & Noble does not make the Nook available outside the United States, if it is taken overseas it will neither be possible to access a 3G connection nor capable of buying books on the Barnes & Noble Nook Book Store. The Nook is still capable of accessing the same Book Store through Wi-Fi and downloading free books from it outside of the U.S. Software versions Barnes and Noble distributes software updates automatically \\"over the air\\" or through a manual download. Version 1.0 *Launch version on the Nook and made its debut on November 22, 2009. Version 1.1 *Released in December 2009, consists mostly of minor bug fixes. Version 1.2 *Released in February 2010, improved the device's responsiveness, bookmarking, in-store connectivity, and battery optimization. The update also included interface changes intended to improve navigation of daily subscriptions, clarify LendMe features, and allow sorting of personal files on the device. Version 1.3 *Released in April 2010, added a web browser (in beta), the games Chess and Sudoku, and more options for Wi-Fi connectivity. Other new features included the ability to read complete ebooks for free in Barnes and Noble stores for an hour at a time, the option to pre-order ebooks that are yet unreleased, minor modifications to the user interface, and improved performance when opening ebooks and turning pages.

Other improvements include faster page turning and improved search options.Software Update 1.5 Version 1.6 *Released on June 6, 2011 and included \\"minor system updates\\". Version 1.7 *Released on June 20, 2011 and included \\"minor system updates\\". Nook apps Free Nook eReader applications are available to allow reading of eBooks purchases to be read on the iPhone, iPad, Android, and Blackberry devices, without the need for a Nook eReader. Originally, there were also desktop versions for Mac and PC; these were quietly withdrawn in mid-2013. Users were pointed to a web-based version instead. A virtual bookmark can be synced across the devices a reader uses. Hacking Some Nook users have loaded Android applications on the Nook, such as Pandora, a web browser, a Twitter client called Tweet, Google Reader and a Facebook application. Many general Android applications running on the Nook present interactive areas of their interface on the E Ink display, making such applications difficult to manipulate on the device. However, Android applications optimized for the Nook screen are also available, including app launchers, browsers, library managers, and an online book catalog browser and feed reader. Although gaining superuser (root) access to install software on the Nook initially required physical disassembly of the device, users can gain root access using software alone. A new hardware revision introduced in August 2010, identifiable by a serial number starting with 1003, running firmware 1.4.1, requires different software than the older models. Attempting to gain root access using software designed for older models renders the unit unusable.New nook says: no root for you! ‚Äì Hackaday.com Retrieved August 2010. As of October 2010, a new method involving spoofing a DNS entry has been found to root 1.4.1 Nooks. Availability Barnes & Noble made the Nook available for pre-order in the United States for following its launch on October 20, 2009 and began shipping on November 30, 2009. The device was available for demonstration and display in Barnes and Noble retail stores in early December. Barnes & Noble began selling the Nook in-store in February 2010. Due to the large number of pre-orders, the initial launch of the product involved multiple shipment dates depending on when customers ordered the Nook. The first shipment occurred as planned on November 30, but delays occurred with subsequent shipments as demand for the product exceeded production. Further shipments occurred between December and February. Barnes & Noble sent a $100 gift certificate via email to customers who had been promised delivery by December 24, 2009, but whose shipment was delayed past December 25.Marco Tabini, Barnes & Noble offers $100 gift certificates for Nook delays, Macworld.com Assessed December 21, 2009 Reception The Nook initially received mixed reviews, ranging from favorable reviews from Time, Money, and PC Magazine to more critical reviews in Engadget and The New York Times. PC Magazine noted the color touchscreen, Wi-Fi and 3G connectivity, and large ebook library as advantages over the Nook's competitors, with a lack of support for HTML and Microsoft's .doc file format seen as negatives. Money compared the Nook favorably to the Amazon Kindle and the Sony Reader Touch Edition. ZDNet blogger Matthew Miller called the Nook \\"the king of connectivity and content\\" and wrote favorably about the lending feature and support for PDF and ePub files. Time listed the Nook as one of its \\"Top 10 Gadgets of 2009\\". Critics pointed to the Nook's \\"sluggish\\" performance and user interface design, with The New York Times reviewer David Pogue writing that the Nook suffered from \\"half-baked software.\\" Pogue later demonstrated using a postal scale that the Nook's weight differed from the product specifications advertised by Barnes & Noble (12.1 ounces rather than 11.2 ounces as the company had advertised). Engadget reviewer Joshua Topolsky argued that menu responsiveness and organization was not optimal but commented that \\"many of the problems seem like they could be fixed with firmware tweaks.\\" PC Magazine wrote that the 1.3 firmware update, released after most reviews of the Nook, improved the device's responsiveness: \\"On the original Nook, page turning took twice as long as page turning on the Kindle ‚Äì two seconds compared to one second. With the 1.3 firmware update, it's about a tenth of a second slower than the Kindle, but the difference is negligible.\\" In early January 2010, the Nook was presented with the TechCrunch Best New Gadget Crunchie award for 2009.

The chimpanzee‚Äìhuman last common ancestor (CHLCA) is the last common ancestor shared by the extant Homo (human) and Pan (chimpanzee and bonobo) genera of Hominini. Due to complex hybrid speciation, it is not possible to give a precise estimate on the age of this ancestral population. While \\"original divergence\\" between populations may have occurred as early as 13 million years ago (Miocene), hybridization may have been ongoing until as recently as 4 million years ago (Pliocene). In human genetic studies, the CHLCA is useful as an anchor point for calculating single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rates in human populations where chimpanzees are used as an outgroup, that is, as the extant species most genetically similar to Homo sapiens. Taxonomy The taxon tribe Hominini was proposed on basis of the idea that, regarding speciation into three species from one, the least similar species should be separated from the other two. Originally, this produced a separated genus Homo, which, predictably, was deemed \\"most different\\" from the other two genera, Pan and Gorilla. However, later discoveries and analyses revealed that Pan and Homo are closer genetically than are Pan and Gorilla; thus, Pan was referred to the tribe Hominini with Homo. Gorilla now became the separated genus and was referred to the new taxon 'tribe Gorillini'. Mann and Weiss (1996), proposed that the tribe Hominini should encompass Pan as well as Homo, but grouped within separate subtribes. They would classify Homo and all bipedal apes to the subtribe Hominina and Pan to the subtribe Panina. (Wood (2010) discusses the different views of this taxonomy.) Richard Wrangham (2001) argued that the CHLCA species was very similar to the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) ‚Äî so much so that it should be classified as a member of the genus Pan and be given the taxonomic name Pan prior.\\"Out of the Pan, Into the Fire\\" in: The human-side descendants of CHLCA are specified as members of the tribe Hominina, that is to the inclusion of the genus Homo and its closely related genus Australopithecus, but to the exclusion of the genus Pan ‚Äî meaning all those human-related genera of tribe Hominini that arose after speciation from the line with Pan. Such grouping represents \\"the human clade\\" and its members are called \\"hominins\\". A \\"chimpanzee clade\\" was posited by Wood and Richmond, who referred it to a tribe Panini, which was envisioned from the family Hominidae being composed of a trifurcation of subfamilies. Fossil evidence No fossil has yet conclusively been identified as the CHLCA. A possible candidate is Graecopithecus. This would put the CHLCA split in Europe instead of Africa. Sahelanthropus tchadensis is an extinct hominine with some morphology proposed (and disputed) to be as expected of the CHLCA; and it lived some 7 million years ago ‚Äî close to the time of the chimpanzee‚Äìhuman divergence. But it is unclear whether it should be classified as a member of the tribe Hominini, that is, a hominin, as a direct ancestor of Homo and Pan and a potential candidate for the CHLCA species itself, or simply a Miocene ape with some convergent anatomical similarity to much later hominins. Ardipithecus most likely appeared after the human-chimpanzee split, some 5.5 million years ago, at a time when hybridization may still have been ongoing. It has several shared characteristics with chimpanzees, but due to its fossil incompleteness and the proximity to the human-chimpanzee split, the exact position of Ardipithecus in the fossil record is unclear. It is most likely derived from the chimpanzee lineage and thus not directly ancestral to humans. However, Sarmiento (2010), noting that Ardipithecus does not share any characteristics exclusive to humans and some of its characteristics (those in the wrist and basicranium), suggested that it may have diverged from the common human/African ape stock prior to the human, chimpanzee and gorilla divergence. The earliest fossils which clearly belong to the human but not the chimpanzee lineage appear between about 4.5 to 4 million years ago, with Australopithecus anamensis. Few fossil specimens on the \\"chimpanzee-side\\" of the split have been found; the first fossil chimpanzee, dating between 545 and 284 kyr (thousand years, radiometric), was discovered in Kenya's East African Rift Valley (McBrearty, 2005). All extinct genera listed in the taxobox are ancestral to Homo, or are offshoots of such. However, both Orrorin and Sahelanthropus existed around the time of the divergence, and so either one or both may be ancestral to both genera Homo and Pan. Due to the scarcity of fossil evidence for CHLCA candidates, Mounier (2016) presented a project to create a \\"virtual fossil\\" by applying digital \\"morphometrics\\" and statistical algorithms to fossils from across the evolutionary history of both Homo and Pan, having previously used this technique to visualize a skull of the last common ancestor of Neanderthal and Homo sapiens. Age estimates An estimate of TCHLCA at 10 to 13 million years was proposed in 1998, and a range of 7 to 10 million years ago is assumed by White et al. (2009): Some researchers tried to estimate the age of the CHLCA (TCHLCA) using biopolymer structures that differ slightly between closely related animals. Among these researchers, Allan C. Wilson and Vincent Sarich were pioneers in the development of the molecular clock for humans. Working on protein sequences, they eventually (1971) determined that apes were closer to humans than some paleontologists perceived based on the fossil record. Later, Vincent Sarich concluded that the TCHLCA was no older than 8 million years in age, with a favored range between 4 and 6 million years before present. This paradigmatic age has stuck with molecular anthropology until the late 1990s. Since the 1990s, the estimate has again been pushed towards more-remote times, because studies have found evidence for a slowing of the molecular clock as apes evolved from a common monkey-like ancestor with monkeys, and humans evolved from a common ape-like ancestor with non-human apes. A 2016 study was looking at transitions at CpG sites in genome sequences, which exhibit a more clocklike behavior than other substitutions, arriving at an estimate for human and chimpanzee divergence time of 12.1 million years. Hybrid speciation A source of confusion in determining the exact age of the Pan‚ÄìHomo split is evidence of a more complex speciation process rather than a clean split between the two lineages. Different chromosomes appear to have split at different times, possibly over as much as a 4-million-year period, indicating a long and drawn out speciation process with large-scale hybridization events between the two emerging lineages as recently as 6.3 to 5.4 million years ago according to Patterson et al. (2006). Speciation between Pan and Homo occurred over the last 9 million years. Ardipithecus probably branched off of the Pan lineage in the middle Miocene Messinian. After the original divergences, there were, according to Patterson (2006), periods of hybridization between population groups and a process of alternating divergence and hybridization that lasted several million years. Some time during the late Miocene or early Pliocene, the earliest members of the human clade completed a final separation from the lineage of Pan ‚Äî with date estimates ranging from 13 million to as recent as 4 million years ago. The latter date and the argument for hybridization events are rejected by Wakeley. The assumption of late hybridization was in particular based on the similarity of the X chromosome in humans and chimpanzees, suggesting a divergence as late as some 4 million years ago. This conclusion was rejected as unwarranted by Wakeley (2008), who suggested alternative explanations, including selection pressure on the X chromosome in the populations ancestral to the CHLCA. Complex speciation and incomplete lineage sorting of genetic sequences seem to also have happened in the split between the human lineage and that of the gorilla, indicating \\"messy\\" speciation is the rule rather than the exception in large primates. Such a scenario would explain why the divergence age between the Homo and Pan has varied with the chosen method and why a single point has so far been hard to track down.

He has previously played for Milwall, Cheltenham Town, Tooting & Mitcham United, Chelmsford City, Kettering Town, Grimsby Town, Welling United, Hayes & Yeading United, Maidstone United, Leatherhead, Walton Casuals and Hastings United.  Career   Youth career  Hughes-Mason started his career at the age of seven, playing alongside Jack Wilshere and Emmanuel Frimpong in the youth ranks at Arsenal. At the age of 14, he was deemed too small by the club and released. He then joined local rivals Tottenham Hotspur for a season, but failed to earn a scholarship at the club. Following his release, Hughes-Mason was offered a scholarship with Millwall.  Professional career  After two years in the youth section, Hughes-Mason made his professional debut for Millwall in August 2009 and the age of 17. Named on the bench the following game, he struggled to break into the team and joined Cheltenham Town in April 2010. However, he failed to make an appearance for the League Two club, where he remained until the end of the season. In July 2010, Hughes-Mason went on trial with Swindon Town alongside PSG forward Yoann Arquin but was unable to impress and later returned to Millwall. In August 2010, he joined Tooting & Mitcham United on a one-month loan, before returning for a second spell in November 2010. In February 2011, Hughes-Mason joined Conference South outfit Chelmsford City on loan and made six appearances in the latter stages of the season. At the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, he was released by Millwall. Hughes-Mason trialed with Burton Albion in July 2011, and Grimsby Town two weeks later, but was unable to earn a contract with either club.  Semi-professional career  In August 2011, Hughes-Mason re-joined Tooting & Mitcham United on non-contract terms, before earning a move to Kettering Town in October 2011. Despite his previously unsuccessful trial, he returned to Conference Premier club Grimsby Town in January 2012, and remained with the club until the end of the season. In May 2012, the striker completed a move to Conference South side Welling United, where he earned promotion back to the Premier division in his inaugural season with the club. Scoring 11 league goals and making 49 appearances in all competitions during the season, he couldn't have the same impact in his second campaign. Hughes-Mason made 15 league appearances during the 2013-14 season, and joined Concord Rangers on loan in December 2013. He also had a brief loan at Hayes & Yeading United, scoring once in three appearances. Following his departure from Welling United late into the season, Hughes-Mason joined Maidstone United for the remainder of the campaign, making nine league appearances. In July 2014, he joined league Isthmian Premier Division rivals Leatherhead. A successful first season saw Hughes-Mason feature regularly for the recently promoted club with 21 goals in all competitions. He remained in the first team set-up the following season with 14 goals, and added another two to his tally during the 2016‚Äì17 season. Continuing to feature regularly under newly appointed manager Jimmy Bullard, he recorded 14 appearances in all competitions prior to his departure. In October 2016, Hughes-Mason joined Isthmian Division One South side Walton Casuals. He scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance, netting in a 3‚Äì2 win over Hastings United. In November 2016, he was snapped up by league rivals Hastings United. Hughes- Mason scored on his debut with a 90th-minute goal in a 7‚Äì0 victory at Chatham Town, and opened the scoring three days later when making his home debut in a 3‚Äì0 win over Greenwich Borough. After a season with Barking, where he scored ten goals, Hughes-Mason left the club to move to New Zealand and join North Wellington. He then joined New Zealand Premiership side Tasman United ahead of the new campaign. He returned to England in 2019 to re-sign for Barking, before signing for Hythe Town in September 2019. In 2020 he became the manager for the newly formed Hashtag United F.C. Reserve Team. On 19 October 2020 Keirnan came on as a substitute for the Hashtag first team against Clapton FC in the 75th minute, scoring a goal.https://twitter.com/hashtagutd/status/1318289412074196993 International career Hughes-Mason was born in the London Borough of Hackney, and is of Antigua and Barbudan, Dominican and Grenadian descent. In August 2012, he was called up to the Antigua and Barbuda Under-20 squad, who he qualifies for through his mother, for the 2013 CONCACAF U-20 Championship qualifiers against Dominica, Grenada and Cura√ßao. However, when Hughes-Mason reported to the games, he was unable to play due to a mix-up regarding eligibility as he did not meet the age criteria. Personal life During his spell with Welling United, Hughes-Mason divided his time studying sports coaching at the University of East London and coaching football at St. Francis' Catholic Primary School in Stratford, London.

The genus was described in 1992 to accommodate the species formerly known as Tilletia ayresii, first described by British naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1899. The species C. verruculosus (formerly Ustilago verruculosa) was described in 1993. Species in the genus are plant pathogens that affect various grasses. Description The fruiting structures (technically called sori) of Conidiosporomyces species grow in the ovaries of various grass species. They are swollen masses of spores with an apical opening, surrounded by a sac-like membrane comprising tissue of both host and fungal origin. The structure supports a central semi-powdery mass made of spores, sterile cells and balls of conidia. The fruiting structure lack a sterile central axis known as a columella. The spores are thick-walled, spherical or broadly elliptical, buff colored, with surface ornamentations, and dimensions of 13‚Äì16 or 12‚Äì13 by 16 ¬µm. They germinate by means of a basidia that bears an apical cluster of elongate basidiospores. The sterile (non spore-producing) cells are pale, nearly colorless, ornamented, and frequently collapsed. The conidia are thin- walled, mostly Y-shaped, translucent, and arranged in roughly like a loose ball. When the conidia germinate, they make hyphae that can form both blastic conidia and ballistospores. Habitat and distribution The type species C. ayresii has been collected from various locales in Africa (e.g. Cameroon, Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe), Asia (Sri Lanka), Central America (Costa Rica), and South America (Brazil, Colombia). C. ayresii grows on various species of the genera Hyparrhenia, Panicum, and Setaria, all in the family Poaceae.

They live in Tumed Left Banner, district of Hohhot and Tumed Right Banner, district of Baotou in China. Most engage in sedentary agriculture, living in mixed communities in the suburbs of Huhhot. Part of them live along Hulun Buir, Inner Mongolia. There are the Tumeds in the soums of Mandal-Ovoo, Bulgan, Tsogt-Ovoo, Tsogttsetsii, Manlai, Khurmen, Bayandalai and Sevrei of Umnugovi Aimag, Mongolia. At the beginning of the 9th ‚Äì 13th Centuries, the Khori-Tumed lived near the western side of Lake Baikal. They lived southern Irkutsk Oblast, some part of Tuva and southwestern Buryatia.History of Mongolia, Volume II, 2003 In 1207, Genghis Khan, after conquering the Khori-Tumed, decided to move some of these groups south and these people eventually settled in the southern parts of the Great Gobi. But it seems that the Tumed people had no strong connection with those forest people in Siberia. The Tumeds first appeared as the tribe of the Mongolian warlord Dogolon taishi in the mid-15th century. In Mongolian chronicles, they were called seven Tumeds or twelve Tumeds. Because the Kharchin and other Mongol clans joined their league, they were probably called 12 Tumeds later. Under Dayan Khan (1464-1517/1543) and his successors, the Tumeds formed right wing of the eastern Mongols. The Tumeds reached their peak under the rule of Altan Khan (1507‚Äì1582) in the mid-16th century. They raided the Ming dynasty and attacked the Four Oirats. The Tumeds under Altan Khan recaptured Karakorum from the hands of the Oirats but the outcome of the war was not decisive in the 16th century. They are also famous for being the first of the Mongol tribes converted to Buddhism. They submitted to the Qing dynasty and allied against the Chahar Mongols in the early 17th century. They were included in Josotu league of the Qing. The Tumed were Sinicized linguistically in the late 19th century, and by the early 20th century. Many of their leaders rose to the very top government, party, and military positions in the newly rounded IMAR, and some attained leading national posts in Beijing and elsewhere. Ulanhu (1906‚Äì1988), a Tumed Mongol born near Huhhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia, who dominated the politics of the region until his death in 1989, and was the highest-ranking Mongol in the Communist Party of China. After the 1920s, as the Tumed began to interact with other Mongols, they began to feel an acute sense of inadequacy regarding their Mongolian language skills.Huhehaote 2000 In the 1950s, they set up many nationality (minzu) primary schools and middle schools that recruited only Mongolian students. In these schools, Mongolian was taught as a subject, one considered of equal importance to Chinese, though all other subjects were taught in Chinese. During the Cultural Revolution years, 1966‚Äì76, Mongolian instruction was largely abolished. A new attempt to provide a Mongol education began in September 1979. The Tumed banner built a \\"Mongolian Nationality Primary School\\" in October 1982 in the banner center. The school then had eight classes divided into three grades, with 201 boarding pupils, all taught in Mongolian. Chinese was taught only from grade 5,Tumote 1987:634-659 the students were not allowed to leave the compound without permission, and, during vacations, they were often sent to the grassland to learn directly from pure Mongol-speaking herders, lest they be contaminated by their Chinese-speaking parents and relatives or Chinese neighbors.

Robert C. Newton Camp # 197 of Little Rock was named for him and was the oldest continually run camp of the Arkansas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, as well as the oldest continually active camp west of the Mississippi River.  Early life and education  Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, son of Thomas W. And Eliza Allen Newton. His father had been a state legislator and a representative in the 28th Congress. Newton was also the grandson of Col. John Allen, who was killed leading his regiment at the Battle of River Rasin, January 22, 1813. Newton was educated at the Western Military Institute in White House, Tennessee. He studied Literature at the University of Nashville, in Nashville, Tennessee, and studied mathematics and languages with a private tutor. He was admitted to the bar in 1860 and practiced law in Little Rock.  American Civil War  Newton is mentioned as the first commander of the Pulaski Light Artillery in an article published in the Arkansas State Gazette, on Saturday, December 22, 1860, announcing that, The young men of this city favorably disposed toward a Military organization which may do the ‚ÄòState some service,‚Äô have formed under the title of the ‚ÄòPulaski Artillery,‚Äô and have elected Rob‚Äôt C. Newton, Captain; Wm. E. Woodruff, Jr., 1st Lieut.; L. B. Brown, 2d Lieut. and Wm. H. Causin, 3d Lieut. He resigned in early 1861 and went into the cavalry service. He joined the Confederate army as a private in 1861 and was promoted lieutenant and assistant adjutant-general on the staff of Thomas C. Hindman. He took part in the battles of Woodsonville, Shiloh, Siege of Corinth, Prairie Grove, Helana, Little Rock, and Jenkin's Ferry. He was regularly promoted, becoming colonel of the 5th Arkansas Cavalry Regiment, and was acting brigadier general in command of the Arkansas state troops at the close of the war. He was a commissioner from Arkansas to authorities at Washington in 1866 to secure representation for the state in congress.  Brooks‚ÄìBaxter War  Newton arrested Elisha Baxter for treason during the American Civil War and brought him to Little Rock, the state capital. After the war, when Baxter was governor, he appointed Newton Major General in charge of the state militia. During the coup by Joseph Brooks known as the Brooks-Baxter War, Newton was the commander of the Baxter militia. After the war, Baxter appointed Newton as state treasurer.

Kaltag‚ÄìTintina fault (north of YTT) and Fairwell‚ÄìDenali Fault (south of YTT) in white. The Yukon‚ÄìTanana Terrane (YTT) is a tectonic terrane that extends from central Alaska through central Yukon and into northern British Columbia, Canada and Southeast Alaska, USA. Extending over 2000 km, the YTT is the largest tectonostratigraphic terrane in the northern North American Cordillera. The Yukon‚ÄìTanana Upland is a physiographic province mostly underlain by rocks of the Yukon‚ÄìTanana Terrane. Understanding and definition of the YTT is constantly progressing, the term \\"Yukon Tanana composite terrane,\\" or \\"YTCT\\" is used by some workers, reflecting the disparate depositional and tectonic histories being recognized in rock units within the YTT. Since 2010, some work dispenses altogether with the term Yukon‚ÄìTanana Terrane, in favor of more detailed subdivisions. Tectonic history The YTT consists of polymetamorphosed and polydeformed metasedimentary, metavolcanic, and metaplutonic rocks of Upper Paleozoic and older ages that were deposited or emplaced near the edge of the North American continental margin. Rocks in the terrane record a variety of tectonic settings and have experienced varying amounts of tectonic transport, both before and after amalgamation of the YTT with North America. Sequences of mainly parautochthonous quartz-rich sedimentary rocks derived from the North American continent also include meta-igneous rocks with mostly continental geochemical and isotopic signatures. Structurally higher sequences contain meta-igneous rocks with arc and back-arc characteristics. The Slide Mountain/Seventymile Terrane, composed of volcanic rocks typical of seafloor and of typical seafloor sediments, is recognized as an ocean basin that divided parts of the YTT before amalgamation of the Yukon‚ÄìTanana Terrane with the continental margin. The right-lateral strike slip Tintina Fault occurs along the suture zone between the YTT (on the south and west) and ancestral North America to the east; it forms a significant boundary between North America cratonic rocks and rocks of the YTT and associated terranes, although displaced continental rocks are found south of the Tintina Fault and pieces of the YTT occur north of the Tintina Fault. Parts of the YTT have been offset by at least along the Tintina Fault. In most of the Alaskan part of the YTT the Denali Fault forms the modern day southern boundary of the terrane. In Yukon the ocean-basin rocks of the Windy‚ÄìMcKinley terrane (in western Yukon), and the Coast Plutonic Complex (CPC) form the southern boundary of the YTT. Units assigned to the YTT also occur within the CPC; and the YTT partially encloses and is complexly related to the Intermontane Superterrane (together with the Stikine, Cache Creek, and Quesnel terranes). Metal mineralization In Alaska (Delta district) and Yukon (Finlayson Lake belt) the YTT contains a number of Devonian volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits with significant copper, zinc, lead, silver and gold mineralization. Sulfide minerals include massive to disseminated pyrite and pyrrhotite with lesser amounts of chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and arsenopyrite. The deposits show evidence of an Early Cretaceous, amphibolite facies event and a younger, mid-Cretaceous lower greenschist facies event which resulted from the accretion of the Yukon‚ÄìTanana Terrane. A belt of significant Late Triassic to Early Jurassic Cu‚ÄìAu and Cu‚ÄìMo porphyry deposits, such as Highland Valley Copper and Galore, of the Stikine Terrane and Quesnel Terrane extends into the Yukon‚ÄìTanana Terrane in Yukon; the Minto mine is an example. Gold mineralization associated with post- amalgamation emplacement of Cretaceous and Tertiary plutonic rocks is widespread in the YTT.

The Gran-Colombian era The Battle of Camino Real, 1820, was the first battle between royalists and rebel forces in the Ecuadorian War of Independence. Ecuador's military history dates back to its first attempt to secure freedom from Spain in 1811. The rebel forces of the newly declared independent state of Quito attempted to extend their control to other parts of the territory but proved little match against the royalist army dispatched by the Viceroy of Peru. In December 1812, during the Battle of Ibarra, Spanish forces easily reasserted control over the contested areas. A new independence movement began in 1820, Ecuadorian forces assembled in Guayaquil, forming contingents with revolutionary soldiers from Colombia commanded by Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, a close collaborator of the Venezuelan liberator, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Palacios. In 1822 after a successful invasion in the Andean highlands, the rebels scored a decisive victory over the royalist army at the Battle of Pichincha. In 1828, as a member of the Confederation of Gran Colombia, Ecuador fought together with Colombia, Panama and Venezuela against Peru to annex the territories of Tumbes, Ja√©n and Maynas to the territory of Gran Colombia. Peruvian naval forces won the victory and blocked Guayaquil, experienced setbacks in the Battle of Tarqui on February 26 and February 27, 1829 but this battle did not define war. The Treaty of Gual- Larrea was signed on September 22, 1829 ending the war. This treaty, better known as the Treaty of Guayaquil, specified that the border between Gran Colombia and Peru would be the same border that had existed between the Spanish colonial viceroyalty of Nueva Granada and Lima. Months later, the Gran Colombia dissolves. Separation and early republic At the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, most of Ecuador's senior army officers and many of its troops were Venezuelans, as was the country's first president, Juan Jos√© Flores. The army of 2,000 men consisted of three infantry battalions and one cavalry regiment. Even as late as 1845, when Juan Jos√© Flores was forced from his second term of office, only four of fifteen general officers were Ecuadorian. Non-Ecuadorians comprised most of the officers and non- commissioned officers (NCOs) in the elite cavalry units as well. Upon taking office as president in 1851, General Jos√© Mar√≠a Urbina freed the black slaves and recruited many of them into the military; Gen. Azarye was the first African-Ecuadorian senior General. Civil war Depiction of the Battle of Guayaquil, the final battle of the Ecuadorian Civil War. By 1859 the nation was on the brink of anarchy and was marked by the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian territorial dispute of 1857‚Äì1860 Guayaquil's Guillermo Franco, had declared several regions autonomous and signed the Treaty of Mapasingue, ceding the southern provinces of Ecuador to an occupying. The Peruvian army led by General Ram√≥n Castilla arrived in Guayaquil and forced Ecuador to sign the Mapsingue Treaty that declares the allocation of Peruvian lands null and obliges the suspension of the Ecuadorian-English business. This action was scandalous enough to join previously disparate elements. Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno, leaving aside his differences with General Juan Jos√© Flores, met with the former dictator to quell the various local rebellions. The ultimate goal of this effort was the defeat of Franco's forces in the Battle of Guayaquil, which led to the revocation of the Mapasingue Treaty. This opened the last chapter of Flores's long career and marked the entry into power of Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno. Struggle and emancipation In the 1860s, successive governments attempted to professionalize the Ecuadorian Armed Forces. Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno, who dominated the political scene from 1860 until 1875, reduced the army in size and depoliticized it. Further improvements occurred during the relatively prosperous period of the 1880s and 1890s under the military dictator Gen. Ignacio de Veintemilla, and successor civilian governments. French officers arrived to provide training on a newly acquired arsenal of weapons. By 1900 the army was able to repel an attack from Colombia which was organised by Ecuadorian political opponents of the government in power. In 1905 the government established military education and training institutions and divided the country into four defense zones. Immediately preceding World War I, the army had nine infantry battalions, three cavalry regiments, three artillery regiments, and three engineering battalions. It was in the years of 1913 to 1916 that all the work done since the beginning of the century was tested. Following the assassination of Gen. Eloy Alfaro, Crnl. Carlos Concha, a famed and revered field commander started a revolution in the northern province of Esmeraldas. The civil war had started and the army was slowly destroyed by the insurgency forces. By the year of 1914 Gen. Leonidas Plaza who was the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and acting President had to take personal control of operations and it would take another two years to end the conflict. In these times both, the army and Navy started the development of joined tasks such as amphibious landing operations, earning much experience in this field. By the mid-1920s, it had expanded to fifteen infantry battalions. Later, under the influence of an Italian military mission, the infantry was reduced to ten battalions, although each battalion now consisted of four rather than the previous two or three rifle companies. In 1930 the army had a total strength of about 5,500 men of all ranks. Ecuador remained neutral in World War I. Politics, war and defeat A Peruvian naval ship in Ecuadorian waters during the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War, 1941. Continual political unrest made the forces become more deliberant regarding constitutional issues. Rebellions, uprisings and lack of loyalty of both senior Generals and medium ranking officers made the Ecuadorian forces weak and disorganized. A long territorial dispute between Ecuador and Peru, which traces its roots back to the Gran Colombia‚ÄìPeru War, escalated on January 11, 1941. Peru, alleging that the Ecuadorian troops had been staging incursions and even occupations of Peruvian territory, began to mobilize its troops to the disputed zone in Zarumilla. This escalated into a major conflict, called Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War of 1941. The accounts as to which side fired the first shot vary considerably to this day. Regardless, the much larger and better equipped Peruvian force of 13,000 men quickly overwhelmed the approximately 1,800 Ecuadorian forces, driving them back from Zarumilla and invading the Ecuadorian province of El Oro. As a result, the government of Ecuador, saw itself forced to accept Perus territorial claims and signed the Rio Protocol on 29 January 1942. Subsequently, Peruvian troops withdrew from the invaded El Oro province. Regaining strength Ecuador declared war on Japan late during World War II and began to receive military aid from the United States in 1942. This aid consisted at first of light weapons, mortars, light tanks, and armored scout cars. Under a military assistance agreement with the United States in 1952, the Ecuadorian Armed Forces, which now totaled approximately 15,000 troops, received additional equipment, including howitzers, tanks, and armoured personnel carriers. Revenue coming from the oil discovered in the late 1960s financed the purchase of considerable additional ground forces weaponry as well as fighters for the small Air Force. Paquisha War The Rio Protocol of 1942 failed to settle the border dispute with Peru and occasional clashes occurred in a then still non-demarcated border area between both nations. These clashes flared into another outbreak of serious fighting in January 1981 called the Paquisha War, for the control of three watchposts which the Ecuadorian Army setup inside the disputed border area. The Fuerza A√©rea del Peru (FAP) flew many sorties with modern aircraft such as the A-37B, Mirage 5P and Su-22 to support these operations. The FAE flew a total of 179 combat missions with A-37B and Mirage F-1 aircraft to counter these attacks. The conflict ceased with the control of the Peruvian army of the disputed area evicting the Ecuadorian troops. In 1983 and again in 1984, shooting incidents occurred when patrols of both countries met yet again on disputed land. It would eventually become the longest-running source of armed international conflict in the Western Hemisphere. Cenepa War A 1995 photo of Ecuadorian Special Forces during a troop relief by helicopter, near the Tiwintza area where fighting was particularly intense during the Cenepa War. The final major military operation involving Ecuadorian forces was the Cenepa War in which both sides, yet again, claimed to be fighting inside their own territory. One of the outposts causing the dispute, called Tiwintza by the Ecuadorians and Tiwinza or Tihuintsa by the Peruvians, came to symbolize the war because of the bitter clashes that took place around it and the emotional importance that both sides attached to its possession. In contrast to a similar but shorter clash that had occurred in 1981, also within the undemarcated border area, the focus of all the struggles would become the advanced posts called South Base, Cave of the Tayos, Tiwintza by the Ecuadorians (and Tiwinza or Tihuintsa by the Peruvians) until the signing of a ceasefire. This was supervised by a multinational mission of military observers from the \\"guarantor\\" countries of the Rio Protocol of 1942: Argentina, Brazil, Chile and the United States. On October 26, 1998, the Brasilia Law Peace Treaty was signed, based on the previous Rio Protocol. The disputed territory (Tiwinza) is delivered to Peru as a result of this, Ecuador had to renounce the Tumbes, Ja√©n and Maynas territories. Past and present Until recently the Ecuadorian Army was a reflection of its past conflicts with Peru. Its troop deployment with emphasis on the southern area and personnel strength, reflected a large scale force ready to fend off an invasion. Today the Ecuadorian forces maintain a smaller but more efficient force, the focus is on defending its sovereignty, by controlling its borders and executing anti-guerilla and anti-narcotic operations.

The story is about African Americans working in white households in Jackson, Mississippi, during the early 1960s. A USA Today article called it one of the \\"summer sleeper hits\\". An early review in The New York Times notes Stockett's \\"affection and intimacy buried beneath even the most seemingly impersonal household connections\\" and says the book is a \\"button-pushing, soon to be wildly popular novel\\". The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said of the book: \\"This heartbreaking story is a stunning d√©but from a gifted talent.\\" Stockett began writing the novel ‚Äî her first ‚Äî after the September 11th attacks. It took her five years to complete and was rejected by 60 literary agents, over a period of three years, before agent Susan Ramer agreed to represent Stockett. The Help has since been published in 35 countries and three languages. As of August 2011, it had sold seven million copies in print and audiobook editions, and spent more than 100 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list. The Help's audiobook version is narrated by Jenna Lamia, Bahni Turpin, Octavia Spencer, and Cassandra Campbell. Spencer was Stockett's original inspiration for the character of Minny, and also plays her in the film adaptation. Plot summary The Help is set in the early 1960s in Jackson, Mississippi, and told primarily from the first-person perspectives of three women: Aibileen Clark, Minny Jackson, and Eugenia \\"Skeeter\\" Phelan. Aibileen is a maid who takes care of children and cleans. Her own 24-year-old son, Treelore, died from an accident on his job. In the story, she is tending the Leefolt household and caring for their toddler, Mae Mobley. Minny is Aibileen's friend who frequently tells her employers what she thinks of them, resulting in her having been fired from nineteen jobs. Minny's most recent employer was Mrs. Walters, mother of Hilly Holbrook. Skeeter is the daughter of a wealthy white family who owns Longleaf, a cotton farm and formerly a plantation, outside Jackson. Many of the field hands and household help are African Americans. Skeeter has just returned home after graduating from the University of Mississippi and wants to become a writer. Skeeter's mother wants her to get married and thinks her degree is just a pretty piece of paper. Skeeter is curious about the disappearance of Constantine, her maid who brought her up and cared for her. Constantine had written to Skeeter while she was away from home in college saying what a great surprise she had awaiting her when she came home. Skeeter's mother tells her that Constantine quit and went to live with relatives in Chicago. Skeeter does not believe that Constantine would leave her like this; she knows something is wrong and believes that information will eventually come out. Everyone Skeeter asks about the unexpected disappearance of Constantine pretends it never happened and avoids giving her any real answers. The life Constantine led while being the help to the Phelan family leads Skeeter to the realization that her friends' maids are treated very differently from the way the white employees are treated. She decides (with the assistance of a publisher) that she wants to reveal the truth about being a colored maid in Mississippi. Skeeter struggles to communicate with the maids and gain their trust. The dangers of writing a book about African Americans speaking out in the South during the early 1960s hover constantly over the three women. Eventually, Skeeter wins Aibileen's trust through a friendship which develops while Aibileen helps Skeeter write a household tips column for the local newspaper. Skeeter accepted the job to write the column as a stepping stone to becoming a writer/editor, as was suggested by Elaine Stein, editor at Harper & Row, even though she knows nothing about cleaning or taking care of a household, since that is the exclusive domain of 'the help.' The irony of this is not lost on Skeeter, and she eventually offers to pay Aibileen for the time and expertise she received from her. Elaine Stein had also suggested to Skeeter that she find a subject to write about which she can be dedicated to and passionate about. Skeeter realizes that she wants to expose to the world in the form of a book the deplorable conditions the maids in the South endure in order to barely survive. Unfortunately, such an expos√© is a dangerous proposition, not just for Skeeter, but for any maids who agree to help her. Aibileen finally agrees to tell her story. Minny, despite her distrust of whites, eventually agrees as well, and she and Aibileen are unable to convince others to tell their stories. Skeeter researches several laws governing what blacks still can and cannot do in Mississippi, and her growing opposition to the racial order results in her being shunned by her social circle. Yule May, Hilly's maid, is arrested for stealing one of Hilly's rings to pay her twin sons' college tuition after Hilly refused to lend the money. The other maids decide that they are willing to take a chance with their jobs, and their safety, and join the book project. Thus the thrust of the book is the collaborative project between the white Skeeter and the struggling, exploited \\"colored\\" help, who together are writing a book of true stories about their experiences as the 'help' to the white women of Jackson. Not all the stories are negative, and some describe beautiful and generous, loving and kind events; while others are cruel and even brutal. The book, entitled \\"Help\\" is finally published, and the final chapters of \\"The Help\\" describes the aftermath of the book's success. Film adaptation A film adaptation of The Help was released on August 10, 2011. Stockett's childhood friend Tate Taylor wrote and directed the film. Parts of The Help were shot in Jackson, MS, but the film was primarily shot in and around Greenwood, MS, representing Jackson in 1963. At the 84th Academy Awards, Octavia Spencer won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in this film. The film also received three other Academy Award nominations: Academy Award for Best Picture, Academy Award for Best Actress for Viola Davis, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Jessica Chastain. Lawsuit Ablene Cooper, a housekeeper who once worked for Stockett's brother, criticized the author for stealing her life story without her knowledge and basing the character Aibileen on her likeness. Cooper sued Stockett for $75,000 in damages. Cooper also criticized her for making the negative comparison of her character's skin color to that of a cockroach, which to many would be interpreted as racist. A Hinds County, Mississippi judge dismissed the case, citing the statute of limitations. Stockett denied her claim of stealing her likeness, stating that she only met her briefly.https://acriticalreviewofthehelp.wordpress.com/2011/02/26/thankyou- ablene-cooper/ Awards and honors *Orange Prize Longlist (2010) *Indies Choice Book Award (Adult Debut, 2010) *Townsend Prize for Fiction (2010) *Exclusive Books Boeke Prize (2009) *SIBA Book Award (Fiction, 2010) *International Dublin Literary Award Longlist (2011) *Christian Science Monitor Best Book (Fiction, 2009) *Goodreads Choice Awards (Best Fiction, 2009)  See also  * List of best-selling books References Category:2009 American novels Category:Culture of Jackson, Mississippi Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Novels about racism Category:Fiction set in 1962 Category:Novels set in Mississippi Category:Civil rights movement in popular culture Category:2009 debut novels ","title":"The Help"},{"id":"24756168","text":"The Charomskiy ACh-30 was a Soviet aircraft diesel engine developed during World War II. The initial version was not very satisfactory and it was cancelled when its factory was forced to evacuate in the autumn of 1941. Production was reinitiated in the summer of 1942 and continued until September 1945 to meet the need for an economical engine to power the Soviet long-range bombers like the Petlyakov Pe-8 and the Yermolayev Yer-2. Development The ACh-30 was a development of the experimental AN-1RTK turbo-supercharged diesel engine that had begun development in the early 1930s. It was initially designated as the AD-5 when development began in the sharashka attached to Factory (Zavod) No. 82 at Tushino Airport in 1939. Construction of the first five prototypes began at the end of that year and it passed its tests in early 1940. Preparations to begin series manufacture at Factory No. 82 began in May 1940, but actual production was delayed until 1941 when forty-four were built as the M-30. Production was planned to be transferred to the Kharkov Tractor Factory, but this was cancelled before any engines were built. The M-30 had proven to be unsatisfactory in service, as it was unreliable and troublesome at high altitudes and in cold conditions. Specific problems were its failure to deliver full rpm and it suffered from oil blowouts and failures of the oil pumps. Therefore, production was cancelled when Factory No. 82 was forced to evacuate in the fall of 1941 because of the German advance on Moscow.Kotelnilov, p. 176 Production was reinitiated in the evacuated workshops of Factory No. 82 by Factory No. 500 in June 1942, thirty-two engines being completed during the year. Development of supercharged versions began about the same time, using geared, centrifugal type superchargers adapted from the Mikulin AM-38 and the Klimov M-105 engines with intercoolers. That from the AM-38 was more successful and was put into production as the M-30B. Thirty-five incomplete M-30 engines were modified beginning in August into M-30Bs and then thirty-four M-30Bs were produced during the rest of 1942. Oddly the ACh-30B, as the engine was now known, was not formally accepted for series production until 19 June 1943, but production had begun quite a bit earlier than that. Factory No. 45 began production in the fourth quarter of 1943. Some 1450 ACh-30Bs were built before production ended at both factories in September 1945.Kotelnikov, pp. 176‚Äì77 The ACh-30B was tested as a motorjet where the jet engine's compressor was driven by an incorporated piston engine (as opposed to being driven by a turbine extracting power from the jet's exhaust as in a normal turbojet). It was bench tested from June 1944 through May 1945, but was never installed in any aircraft. The jet engine's thrust was and the equivalent horsepower of the combination was . The combination weighed .Kotelnikov, p. 178 Versions of the ACh-30 were evaluated on the Ilyushin Il-6 and the ANT-67, a long-range version of the Tupolev Tu-2, but neither aircraft was put into production. It was also proposed for use on the Tupolev Tu-8S and the MN executive transport, but neither of those projects progressed past design proposal stage.

Rising temperatures could bring a higher risk of heat related deaths from heat waves and increased concentrations of ground-level ozone (potentially causing asthma and other health concerns). The New York Times has identified climate change as a contributing factor in the city's increasing level of rat infestation, stating that \\"[m]ilder winters ‚Äî the result of climate change ‚Äî make it easier for rats to survive and reproduce\\". In June 2019 NYC made a climate emergency declaration.  Mitigation  The NYC Mayor's Office Climate Policy and Programs team, who also manages the OneNYC program, said in 2018 that it is pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by the year 2050 and align with the 1.5 degree Celsius target put into place under the Paris Agreement. Inroads have already begun, as the city's emissions have decreased 15% since 2005. The aim is to develop low-carbon transportation options and mandate retrofits to city buildings. In 2018 the team has sued five companies (BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell) for being responsible for climate change, and divesting the City's pension funds from fossil fuels, the first major US city to do so. Mayor Bill de Blasio stated in support of the decision, \\"As climate change continues to worsen, it's up to the fossil fuel companies whose greed put us in this position to shoulder the costs of making New York City safer and more resilient.\\" The OneNYC program as of 2018 made progress towards renewable energy reliance; for instance, solar installations have increased six-fold since 2014, $500 million was invested to improve building energy efficiency, and an additional $1 billion allocated to preserving NYC's drinking water.  Coastal Flooding  Population density and elevation above sea level in Greater NYC, U.S. (2010) Flooding was the second highest cause of weather related fatalities in the United States in 2018. The projected 11-21 inches of sea level rise in New York City by 2050 and 4.17-9 feet by 2100 will compound the impacts of coastal flooding. The damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 served as an impetus for policymakers and residents to more seriously consider coastal resiliency efforts. Since then, regulations have been strengthened to better protect the 400,000 New Yorkers in the one percent annual chance floodplain.NYC Planning. (2016). Info Brief - Flood Risk in NYC.

When completed, the seawall will reduce damages by approximately $30 million.US Army Corps of Engineers - New York District, & New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. (2016).

N.p., n.d. Web. 17 October 2009. . The New York City water supply system has been built to provide for its water needs.McGowan, Alan H. \\"Time for a 'Climate' Change in New York.\\" Environment 43.3 (April 2001) The NYC Mayor's Office Climate Policy and Programs team is investing $20 billion to adapt the city's neighborhoods to climate change threats like flooding, heat, and sea level rise. In 2019, the city allocated $615 million for a 5.1 mile combined seawall and walkway on Staten Island, officially called the Staten Island Multi-Use Elevated Promenade.Staten Island seawall: Designing for climate change  Influences on New York City climate change  The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to- Know Act of 1986 is intended to protect citizens against industrial toxic pollution. This information is available in order to keep track of increasing toxin releases and identify high toxic-releasing companies. Once these records are publicly released, individuals have the freedom to respond to that information however they please. If a shareholder of a specific facility is discouraged by the facility's amount of toxin releases, that person may choose to remove themselves as a shareholder. This is why is it important to minimize underreporting or overreporting of toxic emissions. Although this information is available to the public, New York seems to continue to struggle with keeping carbon emissions low. According to the NYC Mayor's Office of Sustainability, New York City generates 14 million tons of waste and recyclables annually at a cost of $300 million for residential waste alone.\\"PlaNYC 2030.\\" PlaNYC. NYC Mayor's Office of Sustainability, 201. Web. 13 August 2015. Scorecard has documented that the risk of cancer from New York County hazardous air pollutants in each category was almost always the same for each side of the spectrum (kids below poverty and kids above poverty, for example). The information also shows that the lower-income and minority groups emit a greater percentage of toxins and pollutants than others. Toxic disposal and storage facilities (TDSF) are built in low-income areas with lower-valued homes because those residing there are less likely to have the purchasing and political power to fight against it, unlike those living in high-income communities.Boyce, James K. \\"Is Inequality Bad for the Environment?\\" Political Economy Research Institute. University of Massachusetts Amherst, April 2007. Web. 11 August 2015. This means that they will not have the means to make a change against this, so TSDF's are often built in low-income communities with lower-valued houses. Even so, the 2010 New York State Hazardous Waste Facility Siting Plan states that the number of commercial TSD facilities in New York have declined over time with 30 commercial TSD facilities in 1988 and 13 commercial TSD facilities in 2008.\\"New York State Hazardous Waste Facility Siting Plan.\\" New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, October 2010. Web. 9 August 2015. This is a positive and negative accomplishment, because there are fewer TSDF's in general, but there are increased usage and pollution emission levels at the few TSDF's that are available. The 2010 New York State Hazardous Waste Facility Siting Plan also presents important information when evaluating the TSDF's in each county. Chapter 1 of the siting plan states that ten-day transfer stations, generators that store for less than 90 days, facilities or locations for collecting household hazardous wastes, facilities for collecting non-manifested waste such as universal waste, sanitary landfills, and trucks are not included as TSD facilities in the detailed analyses included in the plan. This shows that not all hazardous waste facilities are taken into consideration when examining the eligibility of a county for building more facilities. Omitting such facilities from the analyses presents inaccurate calculations and assumptions. Those facilities still emit pollution and wastes, regardless of the size of facility or time- length of the waste transfer. Someone who lives in a single-family houses emits more toxic chemicals into the environment than someone who lives in multifamily buildings, since detached houses use more energy. Many people rely on public transit in New York City because it is cheaper and easier than using a car. This intense use of the public transit system decreases those people's carbon emissions. The Scorecard analysis states that New York experiences only 45% of days with good air quality in a year and 1% of days with unhealthful air quality. Because of this, New York ranked among the 10% dirtiest/worst of all counties in the United States in 2003.\\"Summary Report: NEW YORK County.\\" Scorecard.com. GoodGuide, 2011. Web. 10 August 2015. In regards to air quality management, the Mayor's Office of Sustainability states that ‚Äúthe City has implemented a policy to reduce, replace, retrofit and refuel City vehicles. In 2014, the City reduced its fleet by at least 5 percent and expanded the use of biodiesel. Additionally, 400 vehicles were upgraded through the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) and other funding sources, and Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) were installed on 685 buses in 2014‚Äù.

It means ‚ÄúLittle Norway,‚Äù and refers to the Scandinavian pioneers who settled the area southeast of present- day Fairfield, California. History In 1852, three Norwegian seafarers ‚Äì Carl H. Thompson and his brother Dan, and Steve Larsen ‚Äì purchased a small sailboat in San Francisco and headed up the Sacramento River. Apparently their destination was the gold fields of the Mother Lode region; however, they missed the main channel of the river and found themselves in Montezuma Slough (see Suisun Marsh) which is located a few miles south of present-day Travis Air Force Base. They abandoned their boat there and walked inland to Calaveras County. After two years of work, and finding little gold, the three Norwegians returned to Montezuma Slough, built a small house, and raised sheep and cattle. ‚ÄúGradually other Scandinavians took up farming in the area, and ‚ÄòLittle Norway‚Äô [Scandia] became the accepted name of the area east and south of Denverton‚Äù. Today, the Western Railway Museum is located near Denverton, California (Highway 12 southeast of Travis AFB). When construction began on the Army airfield that would become Travis AFB, and area was still referred to as Scandia as can be seen in an article in the Solano Republican. The first article on construction was on July 2, 1942, four days before bulldozers broke ground for the new airstrip. The following week, the Republican reported that ‚Äúthe great 1,600 acre area six miles east of Fairfield in the Scandia Section is today teaming with activity as men and machines move in to prepare the foundations for a great flying field‚Äù. Scandia Elementary School Scandia Elementary School is located on Travis Air Force Base. The name of the school \\"was selected in commemoration of those gallant pioneers who envisioned this local site as a possible creation of the American dream\\". The school was officially dedicated April 21, 1970, and was open for a short time at the end of that school year. Its first full school year was 1970-1971. The site originally housed first- through third-graders in 12 classrooms. Vanden High School Vanden High School is located next to Travis AFB and was built to accommodate children from the base. It was named because the location of the school is in the same vicinity in which a town called Vanden was to be built. A Scandinavian family by the name of Vanden settled in this area in the mid-1880s. They started a store and made plans for the town and a railroad station. These plans never materialized, although a post office operated from 1897 to 1899. The school board wished to pay tribute to this early pioneer family by selecting its name as one of historical importance for the high school. The Class of 1965 was Vanden's first graduating class. The school mascot is the Vikings, another reference to Scandinavian heritage.

His father, a favourite of Edward II of England, was executed in 1326. Through his mother, he was a great-grandson of Edward I of England. Early life Although his exact whereabouts before the execution of his father are unknown, it is believed that he was among the children living with their mother Eleanor during her imprisonment in the Tower of London (November 1326 - February 1328).

She stood out in the political arena and was one of the first activists of Ecuadorian feminism, between the third and sixth decade of the 20th century. She founded the Federaci√≥n Ecuatoriana de Indios (FEI) in 1944 with the help of Ecuador's Communist Party.Becker, Mark. \\"Cast of Characters.\\" Indians and Leftists in the Making of Ecuador‚Äôs Modern Indigenous Movements. (retrieved 10 Aug 2011) Biography Dolores Cacuango was born in 1881 in San Pablourco on the Pesillo Hacienda near Cayambe, Ecuador. Her parents were indigenous called \\"peones concierto\\", who worked in the hacienda without being paid. She grew up with her parents, she had no access to education due to her lack of resources. When she was fifteen years old, she worked for the owner of the hacienda as a domestic servant and was struck by the disparity between the living conditions between the landlords and the peons. Dolores never learnt how to read or write, which was one of the first reasons to motivate her to improve indigenous education. She learned Spanish in Quito, where she worked as a housemaid at a young age. One of the political influences of Caucango was Juan Albamocho, an indigene who used to dress up as a beggar and ask for charity. He used to sit near the lawyer's office and heard what they discussed. One evening, Albamocho returned to his community in Cayambe and told his people there was a law for indigenous. Then, indigenes started using the law to defend themselves from the abuses of landowners and the church. In 1927, she married Luis Catacuamba, they lived on Yanahuayco, near Cayambe. They worked on the land and had nine children, eight died at a young age because of bowel disease due to the lack of hygiene and sanitation in the zone. The only living child was Luis Catacuamba, who became an indigenous teacher in his homeland in 1946. In 1971, Dolores died and her last years were difficult. She lost strength, became paraplegic, lost weight and couldn't visit communities and organizations anymore. As she closed her eyes her sole company were her husband, son, daughter-in-law and inseparable friend Mar√≠a Luisa. Activism In 1930, Cacuango was among the leaders of the historic workers' strike at the Pesillo hacienda in Cayambe. The strike was a milestone for indigenous and peasant rights, and was later the subject of Jorge Icaza's novel Huasipungo (1934). During the May 1944 Revolution in Ecuador, Cacuango personally led an assault on a government military base. Along with fellow activist Tr√°nsito Amagua√±a, she founded the Indigenous Federation of Ecuador (FEI), one of the first primary organisations to position, demand and fight for indigenous rights. While Cacuango never received a formal education, she helped establish the first bilingual Indian schools. Aware of the terrible conditions that the children of indigenous peoples suffered in the schools, she ultimately founded bilingual schools, taught in both Spanish and Quechua, the indigenous language. She established these schools in the Cayambe zone in 1945. Cacuango proposed that these schools teach the pupils to read in both languages. Her schools functioned for 18 years, but the military junta closed them in 1963, considering them as communist focos.Dolores Cacuango. Tributo a una l√≠der ind√≠gena, El Universo, March 15, 2009 Cacuango was an outspoken Communist and was imprisoned for her activism. Death and legacy Dolores Cacuango, or Mama Dulu, as she was known, died in 1971. Her son, Catucuamba Cacuango, Luis (b. 1924) taught at the Yanahuaico Indian school from 1945 to 1963, until the schools were shut down by the junta. In 1988, the Ministry of Education recognized the necessity of bettering the education of the indigenous people of Ecuador. The National Direction of Bilingual Intercultural Education was also created. The Aleiodes cacuangoi species of wasp is named after her.

In 2011 the national census of India found the total number of child labourers, aged 5‚Äì14, to be at 10.1 million, out of the total of 259.64 million children in that age group.Age Data C13 Table (India/States/UTs ), Final Population - 2011 Census of India The child labour problem is not unique to India; worldwide, about 217 million children work, many full-time. As per the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, amended in 2016 (\\"CLPR Act\\"), a \\"Child\\" is defined as any person below the age of 14, and the CLPR Act prohibits employment of a Child in any employment including as a domestic help. It is a cognizable criminal offence to employ a Child for any work. Children between age of 14 and 18 are defined as \\"Adolescent\\" and the law allows Adolescent to be employed except in the listed hazardous occupation and processes which include mining, inflammable substance and explosives related work and any other hazardous process as per the Factories Act, 1948. In 2001, an estimated 1% of all child workers, or about 120,000 children in India were in a hazardous job. Notably, the Constitution of India prohibits child labour in hazardous industries (but not in non-hazardous industries) as a Fundamental Right under Article 24. UNICEF estimates that India with its larger population, has the highest number of labourers in the world under 14 years of age, while sub- Saharan African countries have the highest percentage of children who are deployed as child labourers. The International Labour Organization estimates that agriculture, at 60 percent, is the largest employer of child labour in the world, while the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates 70% of child labour is deployed in agriculture and related activities. Outside of agriculture, child labour is observed in almost all informal sectors of the Indian economy. Companies including Gap, Primark, Monsanto have been criticised for child labour in their products. The companies claim they have strict policies against selling products made by underage children for their own profit, but there are many links in a supply chain making it difficult to oversee them all. In 2011, after three years of Primark's effort, BBC acknowledged that its award-winning investigative journalism report of Indian child labour use by Primark was a fake. The BBC apologised to Primark, to Indian suppliers and all its viewers. Another company that has come under much scrutiny was Nike. Nike was under pressure to speak up about alleged sweatshops that harbored children that the company was exploiting to make their sneakers. Since then Nike has come out with a separate web page that specifically points out where they get their products from and where their products are manufactured. In December 2014, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor and India figured among 74 countries where a significant incidence of critical working conditions has been observed. Unlike any other country, 23 goods were attributed to India, the majority of which are produced by child labour in the manufacturing sector. In addition to the constitutional prohibition of hazardous child labour, various laws in India, such as the Juvenile Justice (care and protection) of Children Act-2000, and the Child Labour (Prohibition and Abolition) Act-1986 provide a basis in law to identify, prosecute and stop child labour in India. Definition of child labour The term 'child labour', suggests ILO, is best defined as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development. Interferes with their schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to attend school; obliging them to leave school prematurely; or requiring them to attempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work. UNICEF defines child labour differently. A child, suggests UNICEF, is involved in child labour activities if between 5 and 11 years of age, he or she did at least one hour of economic activity or at least 28 hours of domestic work in a week, and in case of children between 12 and 14 years of age, he or she did at least 14 hours of economic activity or at least 42 hours of economic activity and domestic work per week. UNICEF in another report suggests, \\"Children‚Äôs work needs to be seen as happening along a continuum, with destructive or exploitative work at one end and beneficial work promoting or enhancing children‚Äôs development without interfering with their schooling, recreation and rest at the other. And between these two poles are vast areas of work that need not negatively affect a child‚Äôs development.\\" India's Census 2001 office, defines child labour as participation of a child less than 17 years of age in any economically productive activity with or without compensation, wages or profit. Such participation could be physical or mental or both. This work includes part- time help or unpaid work on the farm, family enterprise or in any other economic activity such as cultivation and milk production for sale or domestic consumption. Indian government classifies child labourers into two groups: Main workers are those who work 6 months or more per year. And marginal child workers are those who work at any time during the year but less than 6 months in a year. Some child rights activists argue that child labour must include every child who is not in school because he or she is a hidden child worker. UNICEF, however, points out that India faces major shortages of schools, classrooms and teachers particularly in rural areas where 90 percent of child labour problem is observed. About 1 in 5 primary schools have just one teacher to teach students across all grades. After its independence from colonial rule, India has passed a number of constitutional protections and laws on child labour. The Constitution of India in the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy prohibits child labour below the age of 14 years in any factory or mine or castle or engaged in any other hazardous employment (Article 24). The constitution also envisioned that India shall, by 1960, provide infrastructure and resources for free and compulsory education to all children of the age six to 14 years. (Article 21-A and Article 45). India has a federal form of government, and labour being a subject in the Concurrent List, both the central and state governments can and have legislated on child labour. The major national legislative developments include the following: The Factories Act of 1948: The Act prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in any factory. The law also placed rules on who, when and how long can pre-adults aged 15‚Äì18 years be employed in any factory. The Mines Act of 1952: The Act prohibits the employment of children below 18 years of age in a mine. The Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986: A \\"Child\\" is defined as any person below the age of 14 and the CLPR Act prohibits employment of a Child in any employment including as a domestic help (except helping own family in non-hazardous occupations). It is a cognizable criminal offence to employ a Child for any work. Children between age of 14 and 18 are defined as \\"Adolescent\\" and the law allows Adolescent to be employed except in the listed hazardous occupation and processes which include mining, inflammable substance and explosives related work and any other hazardous process as per the Factories Act, 1948. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) of Children Act of 2015: This law made it a crime, punishable with a prison term, for anyone to keep a child in bondage for the purpose of employment. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2009: The law mandates free and compulsory education to all children aged 6 to 14 years. This legislation also mandated that 25 per cent of seats in every private school must be allocated for children from economically disadvantaged groups (implementation gaps remain). India formulated a National Policy on Child Labour in 1987. This Policy seeks to adopt a gradual & sequential approach with a focus on rehabilitation of children working in hazardous occupations. It envisioned strict enforcement of Indian laws on child labour combined with development programs to address the root causes of child labour such as poverty. In 1988, this led to the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) initiative. This legal and development initiative continues, with a current central government funding of Rs. 6 billion, targeted solely to eliminate child labour in India. Despite these efforts, child labour remains a major challenge for India. No, child below age of 14 years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any hazardous employment Causes Children around an oil press, 1916 For much of human history and across different cultures, children less than 18 years old have contributed to family welfare in a variety of ways. UNICEF suggests that poverty is the biggest cause of child labour. The report also notes that in rural and impoverished parts of developing and undeveloped parts of the world, children have no real and meaningful alternative. Schools and also teachers are unavailable. Child labour is the unnatural result. A BBC report, similarly, concludes poverty and inadequate public education infrastructure are some of the causes of child labour in India. Between boys and girls, UNICEF finds girls are two times more likely to be out of school and working in a domestic role. Parents with limited resources, claims UNICEF, have to choose whose school costs and fees they can afford when a school is available. Educating girls tends to be a lower priority across the world, including India. Girls are also harassed or bullied at schools, sidelined by prejudice or poor curricula, according to UNICEF. Solely by virtue of their gender, therefore, many girls are kept from school or drop out, then provide child labour. The international labour organisation (ILO) and Spreading Smiles Through Education Organisation (OSSE) suggests poverty is the greatest single force driving children into the workplace. Income from a child's work is felt to be crucial for his/her own survival or for that of the household. For some families, income from their children's labour is between 25 and 40% of the household income. According to a 2008 study by ILO, among the most important factors driving children to harmful labour is the lack of availability and quality of schooling. Many communities, particularly rural areas do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or the quality of education is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worthwhile. In government-run primary schools, even when children show up, government-paid teachers do not show up 25% of the time. The 2008 ILO study suggests that illiteracy resulting from a child going to work, rather than a quality primary and secondary school, limits the child's ability to get a basic educational grounding which would in normal situations enable them to acquire skills and to improve their prospects for a decent adult working life. An albeit older report published by UNICEF outlines the issues summarized by the ILO report. The UNICEF report claimed that while 90% of child labour in India is in its rural areas, the availability and quality of schools is decrepit; in rural areas of India, claims the old UNICEF report, about 50% of government funded primary schools that exist do not have a building, 40% lack a blackboard, few have books, and 97% of funds for these publicly funded school have been budgeted by the government as salaries for the teacher and administrators. A 2012 Wall Street Journal article, reports while the enrollment in India's school has dramatically increased in recent years to over 96% of all children in the 6‚Äì14-year age group, the infrastructure in schools, aimed in part to reduce child labour, remains poor over 81,000 schools do not have a blackboard and about 42,000 government schools operate without a building with makeshift arrangements during monsoons and inclement weather. Biggeri and Mehrotra have studied the macroeconomic factors that encourage child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest that child labour is a serious problem in all five, but it is not a new problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy called organised economy in India is amongst the causes of the demand side. India has rigid labour laws and numerous regulations that prevent growth of organised sector where work protections are easier to monitor, and work more productive and higher paying. The unintended effect of Indian complex labour laws is the work has shifted to the unorganised, informal sector. As a result, after the unorganised agriculture sector which employs 60% of child labour, it is the unorganised trade, unorganised assembly and unorganised retail work that is the largest employer of child labour. If macroeconomic factors and laws prevent growth of formal sector, the family owned informal sector grows, deploying low cost, easy to hire, easy to dismiss labour in form of child labour. Even in situations where children are going to school, claim Biggeri and Mehrotra, children engage in routine after-school home-based manufacturing and economic activity. Other scholars too suggest that inflexibility and structure of India's labour market, size of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour. Cigno et al. suggest the government planned and implemented land redistribution programs in India, where poor families were given small plots of land with the idea of enabling economic independence, have had the unintended effect of increased child labour. They find that smallholder plots of land are labour-intensively farmed since small plots cannot productively afford expensive farming equipment. In these cases, a means to increase output from the small plot has been to apply more labour, including child labour. Bonded child labour in India Bonded child labour is a system of forced, or partly forced, labour under which the child, or child's parent enter into an agreement, oral or written, with a creditor. The child performs work as in-kind repayment of credit. In the 2005 ILO report, debt-bondage in India emerged during the colonial period, as a means of obtaining reliable cheap labour, with loan and land-lease relationships implemented during that era of Indian history. These were regionally called Hali, or Halwaha, or Jeura systems; and was named by the colonial administration as the indentured labour system. These systems included bonded child labour. Over time, claims the ILO report, this traditional forms of long-duration relationships have declined. In 1977, India passed legislation that prohibits solicitation or use of bonded labour by anyone, of anyone including children. Evidence of continuing bonded child labour continue. A report by the Special Rapporteur to India's National Human Rights Commission, reported the discovery of 53 child labourers in 1996 in the state of Tamil Nadu during a surprise inspection. Each child or the parent had taken an advance of Rs. 1,00,000 to 2,50,000. The children were made to work for 12 to 14 hours a day and received only Rs. 2 to 3 per day as wages. According to an ILO report, the extent of bonded child labour is difficult to determine, but estimates from various social activist groups range up to 350,000 in 2001. Despite its legislation, prosecutors in India rarely use the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act of 1976 to prosecute those responsible. According to one report, the prosecutors have no direction from the central government that if a child is found to be underpaid, the case should be prosecuted not only under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986, the case should include charges under the Bonded Labour Act of India. The few enforcement actions have had some unintended effects. While there has been a decrease in children working in factories because of enforcement and community vigilance committees, the report claims poverty still compels children and poor families to work. The factory lends money to whoever needs it, puts a loom in the person's home, and then the family with children works out of their homes, bring finished product to pay interest and get some wages. The bonded child and family labour operations were moving out of small urban factories into rural homes. Consequences of child labour A young fruit seller in the streets of Kolkata The presence of a large number of child labourers is regarded as a serious issue in terms of economic welfare. Children who work fail to get necessary education. They do not get the opportunity to develop physically, intellectually, emotionally and psychologically. In terms of the physical condition of children, children are not ready for long monotonous work because they become exhausted more quickly than adults. This reduces their physical conditions and makes the children more vulnerable to disease.Lieten, G. K. (2004). Child labour and poverty. In G. K. Lieten (Ed.), Working children around the world: Child rights and child reality, 63-80. New Delhi: Institute For Human Development. Children in hazardous working conditions are even in worse condition. Children who work, instead of going to school, will remain illiterate which limits their ability to contribute to their own well being as well as to community they live in. Child labour has long term adverse effects for India. To keep an economy prospering, a vital criterion is to have an educated workforce equipped with relevant skills for the needs of the industries. The young labourers today, will be part of India's human capital tomorrow. Child labour undoubtedly results in a trade-off with human capital accumulation. Child labour in India are employed with the majority (70%) in agriculture some in low-skilled labour-intensive sectors such as sari weaving or as domestic helpers, which require neither formal education nor training, but some in heavy industry such as coal mining. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), there are tremendous economic benefits for developing nations by sending children to school instead of work. Without education, children do not gain the necessary skills such as English literacy and technical aptitude that will increase their productivity to enable them to secure higher-skilled jobs in future with higher wages that will lift them out of poverty. Diamond industry In the year 1999, the International Labour Organization co-published a report with Universal Alliance of Diamond Workers, a trade union. The ILO report claimed that child labour is prevalent in the Indian diamond industry. International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) in a separate 1997 press release observed that child labour continued to flourish in India's diamond industry. Not everyone agreed with these claims. The South Gujarat Diamond Workers Association, another trade union, acknowledged child labour is present but it is not systematic, is less than 1% and against local industry norms. Local diamond industry businessmen too downplayed these charges. According to the 1999 ILO paper, India annually cuts and polishes 70 percent of the world's diamonds by weight, or 40 percent by value. Additionally, India contributes 95 percent of the emeralds, 85 percent of the rubies, and 65 percent of the sapphires worldwide. India processes these diamonds and gems using traditional labour-intensive methods. About 1.5 million people are employed in the diamond industry, mostly in the unorganised sector. The industry is fragmented into small units, each employing a few workers. The industry has not scaled up, organised, and big operators absent. The ILO paper claims that this is to avoid the complex labour laws of India. The export order is split, work is subcontracted through many middlemen, and most workers do not know the name of enterprise with the export order. In this environment, claims the ILO report, exact number of child labourers in India's diamond and gem industry is unknown; they estimate that child labourers in 1997 were between 10,000 and 20,000 out of 1.5 million total workers (about 1 in 100). The ILO report claims the causes for child labour include parents who send their children to work because they see education as expensive, education quality offering no real value, while artisan work in diamond and gem industry to be more remunerative as the child grows up. A more recent study from 2005, conducted at 663 manufacturing units at 21 different locations in India's diamond and gem industry, claims incidence rates of child labour have dropped to 0.31%. Fireworks manufacture The town of Sivakasi in South India, known for its fireworks and matchsticks industries, has been reported to employ child labour in the production of fireworks. In 2011, Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu was home to over 9,500 firecracker factories and produced almost 100 percent of total fireworks output in India. The fireworks industry employed about 150,000 people at an average of 15 employees per factory. Most of these were in unorganized sector, with a few registered and organized companies. In 1989, Shubh Bhardwaj reported that child labour is present in India's fireworks industry, and safety practices poor. Child labour is common in small shed operation in the unorganized sector. Only 4 companies scaled up and were in the organized sector with over 500 employees; the larger companies did not employ children and had superior safety practices and resources. The child labour in small, unorganized sector operations suffered long working hours, low wages, unsafe conditions and tiring schedules. A more recent 2002 report by international labour organization (ILO), claims that child labour is significant in Tamil Nadu's fireworks, matches or incense sticks industries. However, these children do not work in the formal economy and corporate establishments that produce for export. The child labourers in manufacturing typically toil in supply chains producing for the domestic market of fireworks, matches or incense sticks. The ILO report claims that as the demand for these products has grown, the formal economy and corporate establishments have not expanded to meet the demand, rather home-based production operations have mushroomed. This has increased the potential of child labour. Such hidden operations make research and effective action difficult, suggests ILO. Silk manufacture A 2003 Human Rights Watch report, claims children as young as five years old are employed and work for up to 12 hours a day and six to seven days a week in silk industry. These children, claims, are bonded labour; even though the government of India denies existence of bonded child labour, these silk industries children are easy to find in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, claims Children are forced to dip their hands in scalding water to palpate the cocoons and are often paid less than Rs 10 per day. In 2012, a German news investigative report claimed that in states like Karnataka, non-governmental organisations had found up to 15,000 children working in the 1,100 silk factories in 1998. In other places, thousands of bonded child labourers were present in 1995. But today, after UNICEF and NGOs got involved, child labour figure is drastically lower, with the total estimated to be fewer than a thousand child labourers. The released children were back in school, claims the report. Carpet weaving Siddartha Kara finds about 20% of carpets manufactured in India could involve child labour. He notes, \\"determining the extent to which the hand-made carpet supply chain from India to the U.S.A. is tainted by slavery and child labour requires an additional exercise in supply chain tracing.\\"Tainted Carpets: Slavery and Child Labor in India's Hand-Made Carpet Sector , Health and Human Rights (journal)|Health and Human Rights, Harvard University, page 48 Kara's study also finds variation in child labour practices between ethnic and religious groups.

The Government of India expanded the coverage of The Child Labour Prohibition and Regulation Act and banned the employment of children as domestic workers and as workers in restaurants, dhabas, hotels, spas and resorts effective from 10 October 2006. Mining Despite laws enacted in 1952 which prohibited employment of people under the age of 18, primitive coal mines in Meghalaya were caught employing children under the age of 18. This caught the attention of international media in 2013. A related area identified as problematic are the granite quarries. Initiatives against child labour in India In 1979, the Indian government formed the Gurupadswamy Committee to find about child labour and means to tackle it. The Child Labour Prohibition and Regulation Act was enacted based on the recommendations of the committee in 1986. A National Policy on Child Labour was formulated in 1987 to focus on rehabilitating children working in hazardous occupations. The Ministry of Labour and Employment had implemented around 100 industry-specific National Child Labour Projects to rehabilitate the child workers since 1988. The Indian government has enacted a plethora of acts, laws, organizations, and institutions to combat the overwhelming prominence of child labour. Some of the initiatives include the Child Labour Prohibition and Regulation Act which is a piece of legislation that prohibits the engagement of children in certain employment (mostly in dangerous conditions) and regulates the conditions of work of children; the National Policy on Child Labour seeks to adopt a sequential approach with focus on rehabilitation of children working in hazardous occupations & processes in the first instance; and the Ministry of Labour and employment functions to provide and supervise a range of policies concerning child labor in India. Furthermore, as reported by Osment, NGOs such as Care India, Child Rights and You, Global March against Child Labour have been implemented to combat child labour through education and accessibility to resources. However, these efforts have been largely unsuccessful. Non- governmental organisations Many NGOs like Bachpan Bachao Andolan, ChildFund, CARE India, Talaash Association, Child Rights and You, Global march against child labour, Bundelkhand matra bhumi samaj sevi sansthan project stop working with child labour in India, GoodWeave India, RIDE India, Childline etc. have been working to eradicate child labour in India. Child labour has also been a subject of public interest litigations in Indian courts. Demography of child labour In India, millions of children are forced into child labour due to poverty, high illiteracy rates due to lack of education, unemployment, overpopulation, etc. As reported by Save the Children, children between the ages of 14‚Äì17 years engage in hazardous work and account for 62.8% of India's child labour workforce in which more boys than girls (38.7 million vs. 8.8 million) are forced into doing more hazardous work. Child labour used to be most ubiquitous in rural India in which 80% of working children found work. Recently, however, child labour has relocated from rural areas to urbanized areas where the big cities are located. Larger cities provide more opportunity for work compared to smaller, rural areas. As reported by UNICEF, there has been a 54% increase in child labor in urbanized areas for children between the ages of 5-14. In addition, according to a Campaign Against Child Labour study, India has approximately 12 666 377 child laborers total. Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern India, has 19,27,997 child labourers. Delhi, the capital of India, has over 1 million child labourers. Other leading states with similar figures include Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. According to 2005 Government of India NSSO (National Sample Survey Org.), child labour incidence rates in India is highest among Muslim Indians, about 40% higher than Hindu Indians. Child labour was found to be present in other minority religions of India but at significantly lower rates. Across caste classification, the children had child labour incidence rates of 2.8%, statistically similar to the nationwide average of 2.74%. Tribal populations, however, had higher child labour rates at 3.8%.Magnitude of Child Labour in India Table 12, Section 8.12, Government of India India has the highest number of children stunted because of malnutrition (48.2 million) equivalent to Colombia's population, according to Save the Children's 'Stolen Childhoods' report.31 million of children are part of India's workforce, the highest in the world.

Located in the mouth of the Savannah River, the refuge began as a oyster shoal, Oysterbed Island, used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a spoil disposal site to support their mandated harbor dredging activity. As a result, the majority of the refuge is now covered with sand deposits. The more stable portions of the island are densely covered with such woody species as eastern red cedar, wax myrtle, and groundsel. saltwater marsh borders parts of the island. The refuge is an important resting and feeding area for migratory birds including gulls, terns, neotropical migratory songbirds, and shorebirds. Least terns, black skimmers, Wilson's plovers, and several other shorebird species have nested on the spoil deposits on Tybee. During all seasons, the refuge's shoreline and open spoil deposits are used as resting sites for brown pelicans, gulls, and terns. Endangered species, including piping plovers and wood storks, have been observed on the refuge land, while shortnose sturgeon and manatees have been found in the waters bordering Tybee.

Hill located at Dorchester Square in downtown Montreal, in Quebec, Canada.  Overview  The Boer War Memorial, sculpted by George W. Hill (1862‚Äì1934), was unveiled in Dominion Square (now known as Dorchester Square) on May 24, 1907. Its inscriptions say: 'In grateful recognition of the patriotism and public spirit shown by Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal in raising and equipping a regiment of horse for service in South Africa as evidence of his sympathy with the cause of imperial unity.'; and on the opposite side, 'To commemorate the heroic devotion of the Canadians who fell in the South African War and the valour of their comrades.' It is the only equestrian statue in Montreal, and atypically, is not mounted, but restrained. The Boer War Memorial faces north, towards Mount Royal Cross, which would have been visible from the square until 1929. Around the base of the statue are copper reliefs and the names of each battle. The memorial faces south-east. Montreal's First World War cenotaph is in Place du Canada to the south. The Boer War was widely unpopular in Quebec society, viewed as an imperial war. Prime Minister of Canada Wilfrid Laurier opposed the war, but ultimately compromised with the proposal for militia and volunteers en lieu of conscription. For two decades after the war, Canadians would gather on February 27 (known in Canada as \\"Paardeberg Day\\") around memorials to the South African War to say prayers and honour veterans. This continued until the end of the First World War, when Armistice Day (later called Remembrance Day) began to observed on November 11. The four principal monuments ‚Äì the others being the Robert Burns Memorial, Wilfrid Laurier Memorial, and Queen Victoria Diamond Jubilee Fountain ‚Äì in the square are arranged to form a five equilateral cross with the kiosk towards the Dominion Square Building. On July 8, 2009, the official first shovelful of dirt was lifted in the $23-million project to restore Dorchester Square and Place du Canada near the Boer War memorial monument.

The species lives on one atoll in the Seychelles Islands, Indian Ocean, and is easily recognizable for its purplish-blue banded shell. The species was thought to have died out because of climate change, but was rediscovered in 2014. The original 1898 type description of Rhachistia aldabrae in German language by Eduard von Martens. Description The shell of this snail is very unusual in its coloring: purple, indigo blue, and orange, and this makes the snail very easy to recognize and identify. The Aldabra snail grazes on algae, and thus it is very low on the food chain. The shell of this species is oblong, ovate-conical, rather thick, slightly striated, glossy, in the upper part is pale, in the lower part it is black brown. The shell has seven slightly curved and regularly increasing whorls. The upper 3-4 whorls are blackish, the following are dim bluish.  Distribution  The Aldabra banded snail is endemic to Aldabra Atoll in the Indian Ocean. In 1906 it was the most common snail species on the atoll.Smith M. (October 1909) \\"The land Mollusca on Aldabra\\". The Nautilus 23(5): 69-70.van Brugge A. C. (17 September 1975) \\"Streptaxidae from Aldabra Island, Western Indian Ocean\\". Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History), 28(5): 157-175. page 171. After 1976 however, only adult snails were found on Aldabra, and no live individuals had been found at all between 1997 and August 2014. Researchers had believed that this species became extinct during the late 1990s, after a series of unusually long, hot, and dry summers caused by climate change. These summers appear to have killed off a large number of the younger snails.  Cause of apparent extinction  The habitat of this snail suffered a sudden decline in rainfall in the 1990s, which was essential to the survival of this species, and this dryness appeared to have caused its extinction. Living snails were discovered on 23 August 2014. Rediscovery A number of specimens of the snail were discovered on August 23, 2014. A team of Seychelles Islands Foundation (SIF) staff were exploring infrequently visited parts of Malabar Island, the second largest island of Aldabra, when the snails were found.

By the early seventeenth century, vessels were sufficiently well built and their navigators competent enough to travel to virtually anywhere on the planet by sea. In the 17th century Dutch explorers such as Willem Jansz and Abel Tasman explored the coasts of Australia. Spanish expeditions from Peru explored the South Pacific and discovered archipelagos such as Vanuatu and the Pitcairn Islands. Luis Vaez de Torres chartered the coasts of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and discovered the strait that bears his name. European naval exploration mapped the western and northern coasts of Australia, but the east coast had to wait for over a century. Eighteenth-century British explorer James Cook mapped much of Polynesia and traveled as far north as Alaska and as far south as the Antarctic Circle. In the later 18th century the Pacific became a focus of renewed interest, with Spanish expeditions, followed by Northern European ones, reaching the coasts of northern British Columbia and Alaska. Voyages into the continents took longer. The centers of the Americas had been reached by the mid-16th century, although there were unexplored areas until the 18th and 19th centuries. Australia's and Africa's deep interiors were not explored by Europeans until the mid- to late 19th and early 20th centuries, due to a lack of trade potential, and to serious problems with contagious tropical diseases in sub-Saharan Africa's case. Finally, Antarctica's interior was explored, with the North and South Poles reached in the 20th century. James Cook's Pacific Ocean exploration (1768‚Äì1779) The routes of Captain James Cook's voyages. The first voyage is shown in red, second voyage in green, and third voyage in blue. The route of Cook's crew following his death is shown as a dashed blue line. British explorer James Cook, who had been the first to map the North Atlantic island of Newfoundland, spent a dozen years in the Pacific Ocean. He made great contributions to European knowledge of the area, and his more accurate navigational charting of large areas of the ocean was a major achievement. Cook made three voyages to the Pacific, including the first European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands (although oral tradition seems to point towards a far earlier Spanish expedition having achieved the latter), as well as the first recorded circumnavigation of New Zealand. Cook was the first European to have extensive contact with various people of the Pacific. He correctly concluded there was a relationship among all the people in the Pacific, despite their being separated by thousands of miles of ocean (see Malayo-Polynesian languages). In New Zealand the coming of Cook is often used to signify the onset of colonization.per Collingridge (2002)per Horwitz (2003) He also theorised that Polynesians originated from Asia, which was later proved to be correct by scientist Bryan Sykes. Cook was accompanied by many scientists, whose observations and discoveries added to the importance of the voyages. Two botanists went on the first voyage, Englishman Joseph Banks and Swedish Daniel Solander, between them collecting over 3,000 plant species. Banks became one of the strongest promoters of the settlement of Australia by the British, based on his own personal observations. Cook was also accompanied by artists. Sydney Parkinson completed 264 drawings before his death near the end of the first voyage; these were of immense scientific value to British botanists. Cook's second expedition included the artist William Hodges, who produced notable landscape paintings of Tahiti, Easter Island, and other locations. Mapping and measuring To create accurate maps, latitude and longitude need to be known. Navigators had been able to work out latitude accurately for centuries by measuring the angle of the sun or a star above the horizon with an instrument such as a backstaff or quadrant. Longitude was more difficult to measure accurately because it requires precise knowledge of the time difference between points on the surface of the earth. Earth turns a full 360 degrees relative to the sun each day. Thus longitude corresponds to time: 15 degrees every hour, or 1 degree every 4 minutes. Cook gathered accurate longitude measurements during his first voyage with the help of astronomer Charles Green and by using the newly published Nautical Almanac tables, via the lunar distance method ‚Äî measuring the angular distance from the moon to either the sun during daytime or one of eight bright stars during night-time to determine the time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and comparing that to his local time determined via the altitude of the sun, moon, or stars. On his second voyage Cook used the K1 chronometer made by Larcum Kendall. It was a copy of the H4 clock made by John Harrison, which proved to be the first to keep accurate time at sea when used on the ship Deptford's journey to Jamaica, 1761‚Äì1762.  Scientific Surveys in Central America and the Pacific  Alexander von Humboldt (1799‚Äì1804)  Alexander von Humboldt's Latin American expedition Between 1799 and 1804, Alexander von Humboldt a German naturalist and explorer, traveled extensively in Latin America, under the protection of king Charles IV of Spain. Humboldt intended to investigate how the forces of nature interact with one another and find out about the unity of nature. His expedition may be regarded as having laid the foundation of the sciences of physical geography and meteorology, exploring and describing for the first time in a manner generally considered to be a modern scientific point of view. As a consequence of his explorations, von Humboldt described many geographical features and species of life that were hitherto unknown to Europeans and his quantitative work on botanical geography was foundational to the field of biogeography. By his delineation of \\"isothermal lines\\", in 1817 he devised the means of comparing the climatic conditions of various countries, and to the detection of the more complicated law governing atmospheric disturbances in higher latitudes; he discovered the decrease in intensity of Earth's magnetic field from the poles to the equator. His attentive study of the volcanoes of the New World, showed that they fell naturally into linear groups, presumably corresponding with vast subterranean fissures, and he demonstrated the igneous origin of rocks. He was one of the first to propose that the lands bordering the Atlantic Ocean were once joined (South America and Africa in particular). The details and findings of Humboldt‚Äôs journey were published in a set of 30 volumes over 21 years, his Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equatorial Regions of the New Continent. Later, his five-volume work, Cosmos: A Sketch for a Physical Description of the Universe (1845), attempted to unify the various branches of scientific knowledge.  Darwin and the second voyage of HMS Beagle (1831‚Äì1836)  Beagle. In December 1831 a British expedition departed under captain Robert FitzRoy, on board HMS Beagle, with the main purpose of making a hydrographic survey of the coasts of South America using calibrated chronometers and astronomical observations, producing charts for naval war or commerce. The longitude of Rio de Janeiro was to be found and also a geological survey made of a circular coral atoll in the Pacific ocean. FitzRoy thought of the advantages of having an expert in geology on board, and sought a gentleman naturalist who could be his companion. The young graduate, Charles Darwin, had hoped to see the tropics before becoming a parson, and took this opportunity. The Beagle sailed across the Atlantic Ocean then carried out detailed hydrographic surveys, returning via Tahiti and Australia, having circumnavigated the Earth. Originally planned to last two years, the expedition lasted almost five. Darwin spent most of this time exploring on land. Early in the voyage he decided that he could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. By the end of the expedition he had already made his name as a geologist and fossil collector, and the publication of his journal, known as The Voyage of the Beagle, gave him wide renown as a writer. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed, and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, leading to his theory of evolution by natural selection.

Alfred Russel Wallace Amazon and Malay explorations (1848‚Äì1862) In 1848, inspired by the chronicles of earlier traveling naturalistsSlotten The Heretic in Darwin's Court pp. 34‚Äì37. British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace and Henry Bates left for Brazil with the intention of collecting insects and other animal specimens in the Amazon rainforest. Wallace charted the Rio Negro for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on peoples, geography, flora, and fauna.Raby Bright Paradise pp. 89‚Äì95. In July 1852, while returning to the UK, the ship's cargo caught fire and all the specimens he had collected were lost.Wilson pp. 42‚Äì43.Slotten pp. 87-88 From 1854 to 1862, Wallace traveled again through Maritime Southeast Asia to collect specimens for sale and study nature. He collected more than 125,000 specimens, more than a thousand of them representing species new to science.Shermer In Darwin's Shadow pp. 14. His observations of the marked differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the Wallace line, that divides Indonesia into two distinct parts: one with animals closely related to those of Australia, and one in which the species are largely of Asian origin. He became an expert on biogeography, creating the basis for the zoogeographic regions still in use today. While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection. His interest resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity, like deforestation and invasive species. In 1878, he warned about the dangers of deforestation and soil erosion in tropical climates, like the extensive clearing of rainforest for coffee cultivation in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and India.Slotten pp. 352‚Äì353. Accounts of his travels were published in The Malay Archipelago in 1869, one of the most popular and influential journals of scientific exploration published during the 19th century. Interior Africa exploration Africa's deep interiors were not explored by Europeans until the mid to late 19th and early 20th centuries; this being due to a lack of trade potential in this region, and to serious problems with contagious tropical diseases in sub- Saharan Africa's case. David Livingstone (1849‚Äì1855) In the mid-19th century, Protestant missions were carrying on active missionary work on the Guinea coast, in South Africa and in Zanzibar. Missionaries in many instances became explorers and pioneers. David Livingstone, a Scottish missionary, had been engaged since 1840 in work north of the Orange River. In 1849, Livingstone crossed the Kalahari Desert from south to north and reached Lake Ngami. Between 1851 and 1856, he traversed the continent from west to east, discovering the great waterways of the upper Zambezi River. In November 1855, Livingstone became the first European to see the famous Victoria Falls, named after the Queen of the United Kingdom. From 1858 to 1864, the lower Zambezi, the Shire River and Lake Nyasa were explored by Livingstone. Nyasa had been first reached by the confidential slave of Ant√≥nio da Silva Porto, a Portuguese trader established at Bi√© in Angola, who crossed Africa during 1853‚Äì1856 from Benguella to the mouth of the Rovuma. A prime goal for explorers was to locate the source of the River Nile. Expeditions by Burton and Speke (1857‚Äì1858) and Speke and Grant (1863) located Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria. It was eventually proved to be the latter from which the Nile flowed. Explorers were also active in other parts of the continent. Southern Morocco, the Sahara and the Sudan were traversed in many directions between 1860 and 1875 by Georg Schweinfurth and Gustav Nachtigal. These travellers not only added considerably to geographical knowledge, but obtained invaluable information concerning the people, languages and natural history of the countries in which they sojourned. Among the discoveries of Schweinfurth was one that confirmed Greek legends of the existence beyond Egypt of a \\"pygmy race\\". But the first western discoverer of the pygmies of Central Africa was Paul Du Chaillu, who found them in the Ogowe district of the west coast in 1865, five years before Schweinfurth's first meeting with them. Du Chaillu had previously, through journeys in the Gabon region between 1855 and 1859, made popular in Europe the knowledge of the existence of the gorilla, whose existence was thought to be legendary. Henry Morton Stanley, who had in 1871 succeeded in finding and rescuing Livingstone (originating the famous line \\"Dr. Livingstone, I presume\\"), started again for Zanzibar in 1874. In one of the most memorable of all exploring expeditions in Africa, Stanley circumnavigated Victoria Nyanza and Tanganyika. Striking farther inland to the Lualaba, he followed that river down to the Atlantic Ocean‚Äîwhich he reached in August 1877‚Äîand proved it to be the Congo. Serpa Pinto, Capelo and Ivens (1877‚Äì1886) Portuguese Serpa Pinto was the fourth explorer to cross Africa from west to east and the first to lay down a reasonably accurate route between Bi√© (in present-day Angola) and Lealui. In 1877, Serpa Pinto and Portuguese naval captains Capelo and Ivens explored the southern African interior starting from Benguela. Capello and Ivens turning northward whilst Serpa Pinto continued eastward. He crossed the Cuando (Kwando) river in June 1878 and in August reached Lealui, the Barotse capital on the Zambezi. From 1884 to 1886 Hermenegildo Capelo and Roberto Ivens crossed Southern Africa between Angola and Mozambique to map the unknown territory of the Portuguese colonies. The choice of two marine officials for this achievement certainly appealed to the principles of maritime navigation. Between 1884 and 1885, Capelo and Ivens explored Africa interior, first between the coastline and Huila plain and later through the interior of Quelimane in Mozambique, continuing their hydrographic studies, updating registers, but also taking notes on the ethnographic and the linguistic characters they encountered. They established thus the so desired land route between the coasts of Angola and Mozambique, exploring vast regions of the interior located between these two territories. Their achievements were recorded in a two volume book titled: De Angola √† Contra-Costa (From Angola to the Other Coast).  Exploring the Arctic and Antarctic  Arctic and Antarctic seas were not explored until the 19th century. Once the North Pole had been reached in 1909, several expeditions attempted to reach the South Pole. Many resulted in injury and death. The Norwegian Roald Amundsen finally reached the Pole in December 1911, following a dramatic race with the Englishman Robert Falcon Scott. The Northwest Passage Northwest Passage routes The Northwest Passage is a sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Arctic Ocean. Interest kindled in 1564 after Jacques Cartier's discovery of the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, Martin Frobisher had formed a resolution to undertake the challenge of forging a trade route from England westward to India. In 1576 - 1578, he took three trips to what is now the Canadian Arctic in order to find the passage. Frobisher Bay, which he discovered, is named after him. On August 8, 1585, under the employ of Elizabeth I the English explorer John Davis entered Cumberland Sound, Baffin Island. Davis rounded Greenland before dividing his four ships into separate expeditions to search for a passage westward. Though he was unable to pass through the icy Arctic waters, he reported to his sponsors that the passage they sought is \\"a matter nothing doubtfull ,\\" and secured support for two additional expeditions, reaching as far as Hudson Bay. Though England's efforts were interrupted in 1587 because of Anglo-Spanish War, Davis's favorable reports on the region and its people would inspire explorers in the coming century. In the first half of the 19th century, parts of the Northwest Passage were explored separately by a number of different expeditions, including those by John Ross, William Edward Parry, James Clark Ross; and overland expeditions led by John Franklin, George Back, Peter Warren Dease, Thomas Simpson, and John Rae. Sir Robert McClure was credited with the discovery of the Northwest Passage by sea in 1851 when he looked across McClure Strait from Banks Island and viewed Melville Island. However, the strait was blocked by young ice at this point in the season, and not navigable to ships.Burton, p. 219. The only usable route, linking the entrances of Lancaster Sound and Dolphin and Union Strait was first used by John Rae in 1851. Rae used a pragmatic approach of traveling by land on foot and dogsled, and typically employed less than ten people in his exploration parties. The Northwest Passage was not completely conquered by sea until 1906, when the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had sailed just in time to escape creditors seeking to stop the expedition, completed a three-year voyage in the converted 47-ton herring boat Gj√∏a. At the end of this trip, he walked into the city of Eagle, Alaska, and sent a telegram announcing his success. His route was not commercially practical; in addition to the time taken, some of the waterways were extremely shallow. The Northwest Passage, however, had been navigable in earlier centuries, too. The native peoples could navigate their kayaks through the canals, which would not have penetrable by large sail ships.CITATION: Dr. Aron Crowell. ‚ÄúImagining Alaska in North Pacific America: Native Peoples and their Material Culture‚Äù Oral Presentation in Imagining Anchorage Conference, Anchorage Alaska 18‚Äì20 June 2015  The North Pole (1909‚Äì1952) Robert Peary and sledge party with flags at North Pole. Peary has been claimed to be the first person to reach the north pole. While the South Pole lies on a continental land mass, the North Pole is located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean amidst waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting sea ice. A number of expeditions set out with the intention of reaching the North Pole but did not succeed; that of British naval officer William Edward Parry, in 1827, the American Polaris expedition in 1871, and Norwegian Fridtjof Nansen in 1895. American Frederick Albert Cook claimed to have reached the North Pole in 1908, but this has not been widely accepted.See references on Frederick Cook for more information. The conquest of the North Pole was for many years credited to American Navy engineer Robert Peary, who claimed to have reached the Pole on April 6, 1909, accompanied by American Matthew Henson and four Inuit men named Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah. However, Peary's claim remains controversial. The party that accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey included no one who was trained in navigation and could independently confirm his own navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole. He traveled with the aid of dogsleds and three separate support crews who turned back at successive intervals before reaching the Pole. Many modern explorers, contend that Peary could not have reached the pole on foot in the time he claimed. The first undisputed sighting of the Pole was on May 12, 1926 by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen and his American sponsor Lincoln Ellsworth from the airship Norge. Norge, though Norwegian owned, was designed and piloted by the Italian Umberto Nobile. The flight started from Svalbard and crossed the icecap to Alaska. Nobile, along with several scientists and crew from the Norge, overflew the Pole a second time on May 24, 1928 in the airship Italia. The Italia crashed on its return from the Pole, with the loss of half the crew. U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Joseph O. Fletcher and Lieutenant William P. Benedict finally landed a plane at the Pole on May 3, 1952, accompanied by the scientist Albert P. Crary.  Antarctica exploration  Expeditions in Antarctica before the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, 1897 Early Western theories believed that in the far south of the globe existed a vast continent, known as Terra Australis. The rounding of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn in the 15th and 16th centuries proved that Terra Australis Incognita (\\"Unknown Southern Land\\"), if it existed, was a continent in its own right. The basic geography of the Antarctic coastline was not understood until the mid-to-late 19th century. It may safely be said that all the navigators who fell in with the southern ice up to 1750 did so by being driven off their course and not of set purpose. An exception may perhaps be made in favor of Edmond Halley's voyage in HMS Paramour for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic when he met the ice in 52¬∞ S in January 1700, but that latitude was his farthest south. A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer Pierre Bouvet to discover the South Land described by a half legendary sieur de Gonneville resulted only in the discovery of Bouvet Island in 54¬∞10‚Ä≤ S, and in the navigation of 48¬∞ of longitude of ice-cumbered sea nearly in 55¬∞ S in 1739. In 1771, Yves Joseph Kerguelen sailed from France with instructions to proceed south from Mauritius in search of \\"a very large continent.\\" He lighted upon a land in 50¬∞ S which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent. He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed in disgust the Isle of Desolation, but in which posterity has recognized his courageous efforts by naming it Kerguelen Land. The obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of Alexander Dalrymple, a hydrographer who was nominated by the Royal Society to command the Transit of Venus expedition to Tahiti in 1769. The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain James Cook. Sailing in 1772 with the Resolution and the Adventure under Captain Tobias Furneaux, Cook first searched in vain for Bouvet Island, then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in latitude 58¬∞ S, and then 30¬∞ eastward for the most part south of 60¬∞ S, a higher southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel. On 17 January 1773 the Antarctic Circle was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached by , where their course was stopped by ice. The first land south of the parallel 60¬∞ south latitude was discovered by the Englishman William Smith, who sighted Livingston Island on 19 February 1819. In 1820, several expeditions claimed to have been the first to have sighted Antarctica. The first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various sources, three men all sighted Antarctica within days or months of each other: Fabian von Bellingshausen, a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy; Edward Bransfield, a captain in the British navy; and Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut. It is certain that on 28 January 1820 (New Style), the expedition led by Fabian von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev on two ships reached a point within 20 miles (40 km) of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice-fields there. On 30 January 1820, Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula, the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland, while Palmer sighted the mainland in the area south of Trinity Peninsula in November 1820. Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered Peter I Island and Alexander I Island, the first islands to be discovered south of the circle. Only slightly more than a year later, the first landing on the Antarctic mainland was arguably by the American Captain John Davis, a sealer, who claimed to have set foot there on 7 February 1821, though this is not accepted by all historians.  The South Pole (1911) Amundsen, Hanssen, Hassel and Wisting (photo by fifth member Bjaaland) After the North Magnetic Pole was located in 1831, explorers and scientists began looking for the South Magnetic Pole. James Clark Ross, a British naval officer, identified its approximate location, but was unable to reach it on his trip in 1841. Commanding the British ships Erebus and Terror, he braved the pack ice and approached what is now known as the Ross Ice Shelf, a massive floating ice shelf over high. His expedition sailed eastward along the southern Antarctic coast discovering mountains which were since named after his ships: Mount Erebus, the most active volcano on Antarctica, and Mount Terror. Once the North Pole had been reached in 1909, several expeditions attempted to reach the South Pole. Many resulted in injury and death. The Norwegian Roald Amundsen reached the Pole in December 1911, following a race with the Englishman Robert Falcon Scott. The first attempt to find a route to the South Pole was made by British explorer Robert Falcon Scott on the Discovery Expedition of 1901‚Äì04. Scott, accompanied by Ernest Shackleton and Edward Wilson, set out with the aim of traveling as far south as possible, and on 31 December 1902, reached .Science into Policy: Global Lessons from Antarctica, p. 37, Paul Arthur Berkman, 2002 Shackleton later returned to Antarctica as leader of the Nimrod Expedition in a bid to reach the Pole. On 9 January 1909, with three companions, he reached ‚Äì 112 statute miles from the Pole ‚Äì before being forced to turn back.Antarctica, p. 24, Paul Simpson- Housley, 1992 The first humans to reach the South Pole were Norwegian Roald Amundsen and his party on December 14, 1911. Amundsen named his camp Polheim and the entire plateau surrounding the Pole King Haakon VII Vidde in honour of King Haakon VII of Norway. Robert Falcon Scott had also returned to Antarctica with his second expedition, the Terra Nova Expedition, in a race against Amundsen to the Pole. Scott and four other men reached the South Pole on January 17, 1912, thirty-four days after Amundsen. On the return trip, Scott and his four companions all died of starvation and extreme cold. In 1914 Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition set out with the goal of crossing Antarctica via the South Pole, but his ship, the Endurance, was frozen in pack-ice and sank 11 months later. The overland journey was never made.

Yngwin then moved to Denmark, and ruled the kingdom for a while, until he was slain by a competitor to the throne, by the name Ragnald. Yngwin had a son named Siwald, who became king in Denmark after him. Then Siwald's son, Sigar, took the throne after him. Sigar had three sons. One of his sons was Alf, who went aviking.

In a war fought against a revolting Danish Viking clan, Sigar, Alf and Alf's brothers were killed, while defending their Danish subjects. At the end of the war, Alf's comrade, Borgar, arrived with fresh cavalry from Scania, and slew all the enemies. But without a king, the country fell apart, and chieftains took control of the different parts. Only Alf's daughter, Gurid, had survived, of the royal family.

The two principal death gods count among the many were-animals and spooks (wayob) inhabiting the Underworld, with the God A way in particular manifesting himself as a head hunter and a deer hunter. Ah Puch was banished after he broke his promise with the Maya king and was sent to the storm that would bring him to earth forever. Post-Classic names Kisin is the name of the death god among the Lacandons as well as the early colonial Choles,Tozzer 1941: 132 note 617 kis being a root with meanings like \\"flatulence\\" and \\"stench.\\" Landa uses another name and calls the lord of the Underworld and \\"prince of the devils\\" Hunhau,Tozzer 1941: 132 a name that, recurring in early Yucatec dictionaries as Humhau and Cumhau, is not to be confused with Hun-Ahau; hau, or haw, means 'to end' and 'to lay on its back (mouth up)'.Cordemex Dictionary Other names include Yum Kimil, \\"Lord of Death\\" in Yucat√°n and (Ah) Pukuh in Chiapas. The name Hun Ahau (\\"One Lord\\") appears frequently in the Ritual of the Bacabs, but is never specified as a death god. Ah Puch, though often mentioned in books about the Mayas, does not appear to be an authentic Maya name for the death god. (An Ah Puch is mentioned in the opening of the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel in passing as a ruler of the North, and one of the Xibalba attendants in the Popol Vuh is called Ahal Puh.)Thompson 1970: 303 Mythology way as a hunter, Classic period K ºiche º In the Popol Vuh, the Hero Twins descend to the \\"Place of Fright\\" (Xibalba), where a pair of Death Gods, Hun- Came (\\"One-Death\\") and Vucub-Came (\\"Seven-Death\\"), rule over a series of disease-bringing deities. They defeat the Death Gods and put restrictions on their cult. Yucatec According to one of the earliest sources on Maya religion (Francisco Hern√°ndez 1545), Eopuco (i.e., Ah Pukuh) mistreated and killed the Bacab, who was resurrected three days later.Tozzer 1941: 207 note 1154 Lacandon The skeletal death god Kisin plays a prominent role in Lacandon mythology, chiefly in the following tales:Boremanse 1986: (i)39-44; (ii)30-38; (iii)78-96; (iv)73-77 *(i) The creation of the underworld by the upper god, involving the upper god's death at the hands of Kisin, his resurrection, and Kisin's confinement to the underworld; in his anger, Kisin sometimes kicks the pillars of the earth, thus causing earthquakes; *(ii) A failed attempt at the creation of human beings in emulation of the upper god, leading to the creation of the \\"totemic\\" animals of certain kin groups (onen); *(iii) The descent of the ancestor Nuxi º into the underworld to woo Kisin's daughter; *(iv) The description of the destiny of the souls in the underworld, where Kisin (a) burns the souls of evildoers, (b) transforms the souls of certain evildoers into his \\"domestic animals,\\" (c) hunts for the spider monkey doubles of men destined to die. Classic Period: God A During the Classic period, his abdomen is sometimes replaced with out-pouring swirls of blood or rotting matter. He is usually accompanied by spiders, centipedes, scorpions, a vulture, an owl, and a bat. He is pictured with jewelry usually on his wrists and ankles. On his lower extremity, he has around ‚Äúmolo‚Äù sign that putrid smells of death. Over his head is a floating object shaped like an ‚ÄúS‚Äù probably an insect carrying a torch. On his forehead like other deities of the underworld he wears an ‚Äúaqabal‚Äù also known as an emblem of ‚Äúdarkness.‚Äù His head in Mayan culture was used to represent the number 10, the lower jawbone meant the numeral ten that was inscribed within all other head variants of the numbers thirteen to nineteen. He was often pictured as dancing and holding a smoking cigarette.The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica. Maya: Cizin Mayan God. Encyclopedia Britannica (Nov. 14, 2019). Available at:https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cizin On his neck is a death collar which consists of embodied eyes hanging by their nerve cords. The black spots on his body represent the decay of the flesh. Since he is a rotting corpse in some images of himself he is shown with a bloated stomach as a rotting corpse does.Vincent James Stanzione. Angelika Bauer. Mayan Gods And Goddesses pg 32-33. LITOPRINT, Guatemala City (2003). Ritual Both God A and God A' figure prominently in the New Year rites depicted in the Dresden Codex. God A' probably corresponds to the death god Uacmitun Ahau in Landa's description of the New year rites. He presides over a year of great mortality. To ward off evil during this year, men would walk over a bed of glowing embers that possibly represented the fires of the Underworld.Tozzer 1941: 147-149 Temple priests would get in costumes of God A' and performed rites of bloodletting and human sacrifice. Those who impersonated this deity would dance out the steps of ritual sacrifice, putting terror in the soul of ritual participants and the spectators who witnessed these sacred events.Vincent James Stanzione. Angelika Bauer. Mayan Gods And Goddesses pg. 34-35. LITOPRINT, Guatemala City (2003).God A in the lunar eclipse tables of the Dresden Codex Man Hunt and Deer hunt With varying hieroglyphic names and attributes, God A figures in processions and random arrays of were-animals and spooks (wayob).Grube and Nahm 1994: 705-707 In connection with these apparitions, he tends to be depicted either as a headhunter or as deer hunter (see figure). On the grandiose Tonina stucco wall, the severed head is that of an enemy king. The death god's deer hunt has two sides. On the one hand, this deer hunt may metaphorically refer to a hunt for human victims. On the other hand, there also seems to be a connection with certain wayob shaped like deer but with the tail of a spider monkey. On the famous peccary skull from Copan, for example, such a deer way appears to be welcoming the death god returning from a hunt. Jaguar baby transformation Together with the Rain Deity Chaac, God A is present at the jaguar transformation of a man (possibly a hero) who is usually shown as a baby, and who seems to disappear into the underworld.-- Apart from these contexts, on a Copan bench, the earth-carrying Bacabs are paired off with death gods A. This may relate to the fact that in Yucat√°n, one of the four Bacabs was called \\"White Death\\" (Zaccimi). Classic Period: God A' The other codical death god is God A', corresponding to Landa's Uac Mitun Ahau, and characterized by a black stripe over the eyes and a \\"darkness\\" infix in the forehead. Just like death god A, he figures among the Classic wayob.Grube and Nahm 1994: 707‚Äì709 Instead of being a head hunter, however, God A' is a demonic apparition repeatedly shown in the illusionistic act of self- decapitation. He is presented with very pale flesh similar to a dead corpse. Over his eyes are black bands. Like all deities in the underworld, he wears the ‚Äúaq‚Äôab‚Äôal‚Äù which is the sign of underworld darkness and divination. The god is shown wearing a large headdress with a femur bone going through the center of it. In most images, he‚Äôs shown holding either a stalve, pipe, or orb. Like most deities in the Mayan religion, he wears jewelry around the neck, wrist, and ankles. He wears a gown or cloth that covers his pelvis area in the front and his backside. Vincent James Stanzione. Angelika Bauer. Mayan Gods And Goddesses pg. 34-35. LITOPRINT, Guatemala City (2003). His iconography shows considerable overlap with that of an anthropomorphic way (labeled Mokochih) and of a demonic flying insect sometimes carrying a torch (possibly a blowfly, firefly, or wasp). In spite of the above, it has been suggested that the hieroglyphic name of God A' should be read as Akan, a name otherwise only known as that of a 16th-century deity of alcoholic beverages.Grube 2004: 59-63; cf. Stone and Zender 2011: 38‚Äì39 Calendrical and astrological functions A text from the early colonial songbook of Dzitbalche states the Underworld (Miitnal) to be opened and Kisin (Cizin) to be liberated during the concluding twenty days of the year (Uayah- yaab).Barrera Vazquez 1965: 34 In the Classic period, the head of the skeletal God A serves as (i) the hieroglyph for the day Kimi, \\"Death,\\" corresponding to Kame' in Quich√©, also the name of the paired rulers of Xibalba in the Popol Vuh; (ii) the hieroglyph for the number ten (lajun), perhaps because the verbal stem laj- means \\"to end;\\" (iii) a variable element in glyph C of the Lunar Series, registering one to six completed lunations, probably for the prediction of lunar eclipses. Apparently connected to this, God A can be depicted with the attribute of a crescent that seems to mark him as a lunar patron deity.e.g., research.mayavase.com: Kerr 5166 A vignette of God A (or perhaps his female counterpart) illustrates the lunar eclipse tables of the Dresden Codex (see figure).

Prior to her NOAA service, she was in commission from 1967 to 1970 in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey as USC&GS; Heck (ASV 91). Construction and commissioning Heck was built as an \\"auxiliary survey vessel\\" (ASV) for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey at the Jackobson Shipyard in Oyster Bay, New York. She was launched on 1 November 1966Polmar, Norman, The Naval Institute Guide to the Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet, Seventeenth Edition, Naval Institute Press: Annapolis, Maryland, 2001, , p. 617. and delivered to the Coast and Geodetic Survey on 11 March 1967. She was commissioned on 29 March 1967 as USC&GS; Heck (ASV 91).Silverstone, Paul H., The Navy of the Nuclear Age 1947-2007, New York: Routledge, 2009, , p. 303. When the Coast and Geodetic Survey merged with other United States Government organizations to form NOAA on 3 October 1970, Heck became part of the NOAA fleet as NOAAS Heck (S 591). Capabilities and characteristics A United States Coast and Geodetic Survey diagram of ca. 1920 of wire-drag hydrographic survey operations as carried out by Rude and her sister ship Heck. The basic principle is to drag a wire attached to two vessels; if the wire encounters an obstruction it will come taut and form a \\"V\\".Heck and her sister ship USC&GS; Rude (ASV 90), later NOAAS Rude (S 590), were designed to conduct wire-drag survey operations together, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey acquired them to replace the survey ships USC&GS; Hilgard (ASV 82) and USC&GS; Wainwright (ASV 83) in that role. Like Hilgard and Wainright before them, Rude and Heck worked together under a single command conducting wire-drag surveys, clearing large swaths between them with a submerged wire. During their careers, however, electronic and acoustic technologies arrived that allowed a single ship to do the same work as two wire-drag vessels, using side-scan sonar or multibeam sonar. As a result, Heck and Rude began to operate independently in 1989, employing the improved technology. Hecks deck equipment featured one winch and one telescoping boom crane, giving her a lifting capacity of up to 7,500 pounds (3,400 kilograms), as well 500 feet (150 meters) of cable that could pull up to 250 pounds (113 kilograms). She had 11 bunk spaces, and her mess room could seat seven. She was equipped for diving operations to allow human investigation of submerged obstacles. She had a 19-foot (5.7 meter) fiberglass launch for utility or rescue operations. Operational history Heck spent her career operating along the United States East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1978, Heck and Rude came to the assistance of the burning research vessel Midnight Sun, rescuing Midnight Suns crew and scientists and saving the vessel from total loss. Rudes crew took aboard all 20 of Midnight Suns crew members and scientists, who were afloat in life rafts near Midnight Sun, administered first aid to them, and transported them to shore. Hecks crew, meanwhile, fought the fire aboard Midnight Sun for 20 consecutive hours and saved Midnight Sun from sinking. For their efforts in saving Midnight Sun and her crew, the crews of Rude and Heck received the Department of Commerce Silver Medal in 1978. Heck was decommissioned on 25 October 1995, stricken in 1996, and sold in 2001.

Jessie Wallace Hughan (December 25, 1875 ‚Äì April 10, 1955) was an American educator, a socialist activist, and a radical pacifist. During her college days she was one of four co-founders of Alpha Omicron Pi, a national fraternity for university women. She also was a founder and the first Secretary of the War Resisters League, established in 1923. For over two decades, she was a perennial candidate for political office on the ticket of the Socialist Party of America in her home state of New York. Biography Early years Jessie Wallace Hughan was born December 25, 1875 in Brooklyn, New York. She was the third of four children born to Margaret and Samuel Hughan, who were of Scottish, English, and French ancestry.\\"Jessie Wallace Hughan,\\" Political Graveyard.com. Her father was an accountant.Solon DeLeon (ed.) in collaboration with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole, The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 113.

Santa Barbara, CA: Abc-Clio, 2006; pp. 293-294. Hughan enrolled at Barnard College in New York City in 1894. In January 1897 she co-founded there with three other students the international sorority Alpha Omicron Pi.\\"About ŒëŒüŒ†: Founding,\\" ŒëŒüŒ† official website. Retrieved October 20, 2009. In 1898 she graduated, earning her A.B. degree, for which she authored an unpublished senior thesis on \\"Recent Theories of Profits.\\"\\"Jessie Wallace Hughan,\\" A Woman A Week. An excellent student, Hughan was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, a national honorary society. After graduation from Barnard, Hughan enrolled in Columbia University, also located in New York City. There Hughan earned her Masters of Arts degree in 1899, writing a thesis entitled \\"The Place of Henry George in Economics,\\" and her Ph.D. in 1910. Her dissertation was adapted by Columbia University Press and published in book form as The Present Status of Socialism in America, for which the prominent British-born socialist John Spargo wrote the introduction. The book was later reissued by a commercial publisher under a slightly revised title. Hughan made her professional career as an educator, teaching in a series of public and private schools following her graduation from Columbia with her A.M. degree in 1899. She first taught in schools in Naugatuck, Connecticut and White Plains, New York before returning to New York City in the early 1900s to complete her doctorate. Following her graduate work, she taught in a number of high schools throughout New York City, primarily in Brooklyn. In the 1920s, Hughan was in charge of the English Department at Textile High School, a position which she retained until her retirement from the profession in 1945. Socialist activism Jessie Wallace Hughan joined the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in 1907.Mari Jo Buhle, \\"Jessie Wallace Hughan (1875-1955),\\" in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, Dan Georgakas (eds.), Encyclopedia of the American Left. New York: Garland Publishers, 1990; pg. 339. Hughan's primary place in the socialist movement was as an officer of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society (ISS), an independent organization established by author Upton Sinclair in 1905 to provide a venue of topics related to socialism, pro and con, by university students across America.Max Horn, The Intercollegiate Socialist Society, 1905-1921: Origins of the Modern American Student Movement. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, pp. 2-3. Hughan was elected to the Executive Committee of the ISS in 1907 and served continuously in that capacity until the end of the organization in 1921, continuing in a similar capacity in its successor organization, the League for Industrial Democracy (LID) through 1925.Horn, The Intercollegiate Socialist Society, 1905-1921, pg. 235. She also served as Vice President of the ISS from 1920 to 1921. Other so-called adult leaders of the ISS during this interval included Morris Hillquit, J.G. Phelps Stokes, Harry W. Laidler, as well as founding father Upton Sinclair. In 1913, the ISS commissioned Hughan to write a book on the principles of socialism to serve as a text for study and discussion by the various chapters of the organization.Horn, The Intercollegiate Socialist Society, 1905-1921, pg. 50. The resulting publication, a tome called Facts of Socialism, was an influential text among the young intellectuals who participated in the Intercollegiate Socialist Society's activities, a group which included peace activist Devere Allen, journalist Heywood Broun, researcher and American Civil Liberties Union official Robert W. Dunn, historian Herbert Feis, and publicist Walter Lippmann.Horn, The Intercollegiate Socialist Society, 1905-1921, pp. 228-230. Campaigns for electoral office Jessie Wallace Hughan as she appeared in 1919. For over two decades, Jessie Wallace Hughan was a candidate for public office on the ticket of the Socialist Party of America. Her first foray into politics came in a 1915 bid for Alderman in 1915. It was perhaps the only race in which she ran in which she had a measurable chance of winning. Hughan ran for office not so much intending to win, but rather as a means of advancing socialist ideas to a broader public and to put pressure on elected officials to co-opt and implement ideas from the Socialist Party's political platform. Hughan therefore was unfazed by electoral defeat, instead running for a steadily escalating series of political offices. Hughan ran on the Socialist ticket for New York State Treasurer in 1918.James Weinstein, The Decline of Socialism in America, 1912-1925. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1967; pg. 60. In 1920, she ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York as a Socialist. The year 1922 marked Hughan's first bid for US Congress, an office which she sought four times ‚Äî in 1922 in the New York 16th District; in 1924 in the New York 17th District; in 1928 in the New York 15th District; and in 1934 in the New York 15th District. In 1926 she took a break from her Congressional campaigns to launch a bid for election to the US Senate from New York. Hughan also ran for New York State Assembly in 1927,\\"Here Are Your Candidates,\\" The New Leader, vol. 4, no. 18 (October 22, 1927), pg. 4. 1932, and 1938. Hughan does not seem to have exited the Socialist Party with its so- called \\"Old Guard\\" faction in 1936 to join the Social Democratic Federation, instead remaining loyal to fellow radical pacifist Norman Thomas despite the SPA's descent into factional war as the decade of the 1930s came to a close. Tellingly, neither did she run for elective office again after 1938. Anti- War efforts A deeply religious person, Hughan was a committed pacifist who spent the whole of her life fighting the spread of militarism in America. Hughan joined Frances M. Witherspoon and Tracy Mygatt in forming a number of peace groups linking pacifism, Christianity, and socialist politics. Unlike other opponents of war, Hughan intellectually developed a sophisticated socialist-pacifist position. Prior to U.S. military intervention in World War I, she challenged prowar socialists, such as Graham Stokes. Following the eruption of the war in the summer of 1914, Hughan felt herself called to action. In 1915 she organized the Anti-Enlistment League, with a headquarters in her apartment. Hughan and her associates were able to gather the signatures of some 3,500 men to a declaration opposing military enlistment with a view to demonstrating to American political leaders the unpopularity of the European war. She was a devoted opponent of the coordinated \\"Preparedness\\" campaign which emerged across the nation in 1915 and 1916. American entry into the war in April 1917 spelled the end of the Anti-Enlistment League, with the government seizing the organization's files and records. While she was never fired from her public school teaching positions for her political views, Hughan was called into suspicion in the eyes of some New York politicians. In 1919, Hughan was called before the Lusk Committee of the New York State Assembly, a special committee convened to investigate and report upon radicalism in New York state. The Committee denied her the Certificate of Character and Loyalty due to her appending the words \\"This obedience being qualified always by dictates of conscience\\" to the state's teachers' oath. Later in 1919, Hughan's name appeared with those of settlement house pioneer Jane Addams and liberal journalist Oswald Garrison Villard on a list of 62 \\"dangerous radicals\\" presented to the Overman Committee of the U.S. Senate, the first congressional body charged with the investigation of radicalism in the United States. After World War I, Hughan led a campaign to organize an active war resistance movement in the United States. During the 1920s, she signed up numerous war resisters, delivered many speeches, and wrote pamphlets and tracts on the use of active nonviolence. She also organized various public protests against war and militarism, including some New York \\"NO More War\\" parades. Hughan sat on the National Council and was a member of the New York Executive Committee of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a religious pacifist organization, from 1920 to 1923. In 1923, she founded a new anti-militarist group, the War Resisters League (WRL), and presided over it as Secretary from the time of its formation. The intent behind the WRL was to provide an organizational framework for opponents of militarism who had no traditional religious basis for their pacifist beliefs. The organization of the WRL was supported by other pacifist groups, including the Fellowship of Reconciliation, the Women's Peace Society, and the Women's Peace Union. In 1938, with another war looming in Europe, Hughan organized a new umbrella organization known as the United Pacifist Committee, designed to coordinate the educational and political activities of sundry pacifist groups. She helped with the organization of public demonstrations, including a series of \\"No More War\\" parades in New York City, and was a vigorous opponent of the return to military conscription in 1940. She continued to serve as Secretary of the War Resisters League continuously through the end of World War II in 1945, at which time she stepped down to become the group's \\"Honorary Secretary.\\" She continued to remain active on the governing Executive Committee of the WRL. Death and legacy Jessie Wallace Hughan retired in 1945. She stayed active in the War Resisters League as a member of the organization's Executive Committee until her death on April 10, 1955. She was 79 years old at the time of her death. She was survived by her sister Evelyn Hughan, with whom she had lived during her entire adult life, as well as her sister Marjorie Hughan Rockwell and Marjorie's four children, with whom Jessie was extremely close. The organization that Hughan founded, the War Resisters League, as well as the organization she helped to found, Alpha Omicron Pi fraternity, both continue as vital and established institutions into the 21st century. Both of these organizations remember Hughan's name and her role in their formation. Alpha Omicron Pi annually awards a prize known as the Jessie Wallace Hughan Cup to the organization's outstanding chapter. Footnotes Works * The Present Status of Socialism in America.

Founded in 1908, the Guild was inspired by the philosophy of William Morris, and originally offered a place for artists and craftsmen to come together, learn from each other and sell their wares. Today it still showcases artists both local and foreign, while also operating as a more conventional small department store. History The Guild was founded in 1908 as a guild in the true sense, a co-operative for local craftsmen to organise, work, learn and sell their handiwork. It was built on the principles behind William Morris's Arts and Crafts Movement and lasted in that form until 1918, when the enterprise folded. It was bought out by three local businessmen and turned into a fully commercial venture, importing glass from Sweden and crystal and pottery from elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Park Street has been the home of the Guild since its founding, with the modern-day premises located at 68‚Äì70 Park Street. Since the 1940s, the Guild has survived the Bristol Blitz bombings in World War II and a Provisional IRA attack in 1974.McGladdery, p. 99. Modern times Since its inception the Guild has offered exhibitions of particular artists and craftspeople, both established names and newcomers, including Gillian Lowndes and Dan Arbeit, at its second floor public gallery.

It consists essentially of the proventriculus of a chicken (thus, the derivation of its name), dipped in cornstarch or flour, and deep-fried. It is served either in a small bagful of vinegar, or skewered on bamboo sticks to be dipped in the vinegar just before it is eaten. Description Proven originated in the city of Cagayan de Oro. It is also eaten in Cebu City, Iligan City and other parts of Mindanao.http://www.cdodev.com/2013/11/22/proben-the-popular-street-food-in- cagayan-de-oro/ Nutritional value A nutritional study conducted by UPLB noted that, as with most street foods, the microbial quality of the proben is a concern. However, the study noted that the pathogenic food-borne microbes in proben are mostly destroyed when it is cooked. The microbes only return if the proben is stored at ambient temperature after having been cooked. The study concluded that the risk of contamination can be reduced simply \\"through practice of personal hygiene employing standard cooking temperature (171‚Äì185 deg C) and time (10‚Äì15 min)\\" and by making sure that the proben is cooked just before it is eaten.

In some parts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamilnadu it is also celebrated in the month of Sravana masam. Nagula Chavithi, a festival to worship Nag Devatas (Serpent Gods), is mainly a women festival. Nagula Chavithi is observed by married women for their wellbeing of their children. During the Chavithi festival, women keep fast and observe Naga Puja. Devotees offer milk and dry fruits to Sarpa Devata at the Valmeekam or Putta (snake pits). On Nag Chaturthi day, Ashtanag (seven hooded cobra) is worshipped. Nagula Chavithi in Kartika masam is a major festival in Andhra Pradesh and some parts of Tamilnadu. The rituals and puja procedures are different from place to place. Some people place Naga devatha idol at home and perform puja. But in some places, devotees go to 'Putta' (Snake pit) and offer naivedyam and perform other pujas there The popular legend associated with Nagula Chavithi in Telugu Hindu culture suggests that on the day Lord Shiva drank the poison Halahala or Kalkuta to save the universe during the famous incident of Samudra Manthan. Pujas and prayers are held in Naga temples across the state. Nowadays, Nagula Chavithi day is noted for the practice of offering milk and eggs to the snakes, especially cobras near snake pits. Snake charmers also bring cobras to villages and towns which are fed with milk by devotees. Worship of Nagas is a constant reminder to humans to live in harmony with Nature.

Early life Sylla was born to an unknown French father and a Creole mother, Louisa Sylla on 18 February 1909 in Tul√©ar. As a child he was educated in nous Catholic missions, attending the Brothers of Saint Gabriel in Nosy Be, and later the College of the Saint Joseph Christian Brothers in Tamatave. After being admitted to the Myre de Vilers school, he began studies at the School of Medicine in Antananarivo in 1926, where he gained the rank of Senior Medical Officer; the highest degree attainable by local officials. Personal life In 1932 in Tamatave he married Laguet, a lady of European and R√©union Creole heritage, and they had six children. The family lived in Fianarantsoa, Tul√©ar, Tananarive, Mananara, √éle Sainte-Marie and lastly Tamatave, where he was posted in September 1946, after the birth of his son Jacques. Sylla helped form Parti des d√©sh√©rit√©s de Madagascar (PADESM), and he entered politics when he was elected as a provincial councillor on 30 March 1952. In the same year he became Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Tourism. His son, Jacques Sylla, served as Prime Minister from 2002 to 2007. Career In 1953 he was elected as a councillor to the Assembly of the French Union, and he ran on the list of \\"Entente franco-malgache dan l'Union francaise\\". On 28 August 1956, whilst attending a reunion in Tamatave, he became president of the local chapter of the UDSM, which had been formed by Norbest Zafimahova. In 1958 he became a member of the National Assembly of Madagascar. During this time he travelled extensively, and made unofficial visits to South Korea, Algeria, India, Taiwan, France, Belgium, Kenya, Japan, Greece, amongst others. After Madagascar gained independence from France on 26 June 1960, Sylla was appointed by President Philibert Tsiranana to the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs, and chaired Madagascar's delegation at meetings of the Organisation of African Unity. Death On 19 July 1967, an Air Madagascar Douglas DC-4, on a scheduled flight from Antananarivo to Tamatave and Diego Suarez, crashed after take-off from Ivato International Airport, killing 42 people, including Sylla. The Madagascar Cabinet held an emergency meeting after the crash, and it was announced that Sylla would be given a state funeral. Sylla was succeeded as foreign minister by Jacques Rabemananjara on 22 August 1967 after President Tsiranana reshuffled his cabinet as a result of Sylla's death.

Its full title originally was A Handbook of the Birds of Western Australia (with the exception of the Kimberley Division), though with the publication of the 5th edition only the shorter form was used. It was authored by Dominic Serventy and Hubert Whittell. It was issued in octavo format (228 x 148 mm) and contains 372 pages bound in blue buckram with a dustjacket illustrated with a painting of Australian pelicans by Harley Webster. It contains a coloured frontispiece of paintings of the heads of Meliphaga honeyeaters, with numerous black-and-white drawings and maps scattered through the text. The second edition (1951) contained colour plates by Olive Seymour. The book covered birds recorded within the Australian state of Western Australia except, as the full title of the first edition indicates, the tropical Kimberley region of its north. It was the first Australian regional ornithological handbook. In the Introduction the authors state: > ‚ÄùThe need for some such Handbook as this one was impressed on the authors by > their own early experiences in Western Australian ornithology. Perhaps, > however, they flatter themselves unduly for presenting to the bird-loving > public a book which they like to feel is one of the type they wished had > been available to them when beginning the study of local birds.‚ÄùServenty & > Whittell (1948), p.1. With regard to the layout of the book, they say: > ‚ÄùThe first two sections deal with the history of Western Australian > ornithology and a discussion of the bird geography of the State. Though > complete in themselves both are supplementary to the third section, the > detailed treatment of the species of birds occurring in our area.‚ÄùServenty & > Whittell (1948), pp.1-2. The success of the book was such that, for many years, it was the principal source of information on the birds of the state. Further editions appeared in 1951, 1962, 1967 and 1976, the fifth and final one being published by the University of Western Australia Press, with the length having increased by then to some 490 pages.

Early life and military service Heubeck was born in Nuremberg, Germany in 1923, the son of an engineer in the city's gas works. In 1942, aged 19, he was a member of the Hitler Youth,McKittrick, David: Nazi background of prominent Irish publisher exposed, The Independent, 4 January 2007. and was conscripted into the Luftwaffe as a soldier and engineer in the Hermann G√∂ring division. He was initially posted to anti-invasion duties in western France, then moved to Italy, before being assigned to the Afrika Korps in the last stages of the North African Campaign. The transport ships carrying Heubeck to Africa were attacked by air and sunk four-and-a-half miles from the African coast. Heubeck swam to Cap Bon, also managing to rescue some of his colleagues, of which 60 from 550 survived the attack.Werner Heubeck, Ulsterbus chief who carried live bombs off buses, dies at age of 85, The Belfast Telegraph, 20 October 2009. Post-World War II Captured shortly after reaching Tunisia, Heubeck was sent to the United States on the last prisoner of war convoy to a POW camp at Fort Polk, Louisiana. He was repatriated in 1946, and returned to Nuremberg to rebuild his family home. After a brief period working for the United States Army, Heubeck obtained work as a translator and proof reader at the Nuremberg Trials held in his home town. It was at the Nuremberg Trials that Heubeck met his future wife, Monica, a Welsh translator who had worked at Bletchley Park during the war. Despite Heubeck's German heritage and military service, he and Monica gained permission to marry and settle in Britain, which they did in 1949.Face of Belfast buses passes away, BBC News, 20 October 2009. Heubeck was naturalised as a British citizen in 1954, at the time he was described as a \\"Development Assistant\\" and was living in Govilon, Abergavenny, Wales. Ulsterbus and Citybus In 1957, Heubeck was working for Alex Pirie & Sons, a paper mill in Aberdeen. In 1967, he happened to notice an advertisement for the position of managing director for buses in Northern Ireland, and successfully applied for the job, preparing for the interview by taking a day trip to Ulster and speaking to the bus manager in Aberdeen. The Ulster Transport Authority (UTA), as it was then known, had been making serious losses, and in 1967, Heubeck headed up a major revamping of the bus side of the organisation, which was rebranded as Ulsterbus. Staffing was cut, including the phasing out of conductors, and timetables were rescheduled. He succeeded in running Ulsterbus and Citybus profitably at a time when conventional wisdom said that public transport could never be run profitably. Unlike many managers at the time he eschewed ostentation‚Äîsharing the services of a secretary with his Chief Engineer, keeping filing to a minimum and carrying this emphasis on economic working throughout the organisation. In addition, Heubeck's tenure at Ulsterbus coincided with the height of The Troubles in Northern Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s, with public transport being a prime target of the Provisional IRA's bombing campaign. Heubeck was well-known at the time for personally boarding buses and removing hoax bombs himself to keep the buses running to schedule. Retirement Heubeck retired in 1988, after 23 years at Ulsterbus. He moved to near the village of Gleno in County Antrim where Heubeck produced handmade artefacts and furniture for local churches. He later moved to Shetland where one of their three sons (Martin Heubeck) worked as an ornithologist. Heubeck died on 19 October 2009, aged 85, just a month after the death of his wife Monica. He had been battling cancer for several years. Honours Heubeck was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1977 Queen's Birthday Honours. In the Birthday Honours of 1988, the year of his retirement from Ulsterbus, he was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

It is a monotypic genus, containing the single species Salmacisia buchlo√´ana, first described as Tilletia buchlo√´ana in 1889, and renamed in 2008. Plants infected by the fungus undergo a phenomenon known as \\"parasitically induced hermaphroditism\\", whereby ovary development is induced in otherwise male plants. Because of the pistil-inducing effects of the fungus, the authors have named the species pistil smut; it is the only species in the order Tilletiales known to have hermaphroditic effects. Taxonomy and history In 1889 American mycologist William Ashbrook Kellerman and his student Walter T. Swingle discovered a species of smut that was able to change the sex of its host; the host plant, in this case buffalograss (Buchlo√´ dactyloides), produced ovaries in flowers of plants that were otherwise male. They named the fungus Tilletia buchlo√´ana, a generic placement they considered apt because of the characteristics of the fungal teliospores. Both Kellerman and Swingle, and later Norton in 1896, were unable to induce teliospores to germinate in vitro. Reinvestigation of the species in 2005 highlighted both the uniqueness of the species and the need for a taxonomic rearrangement, resulting in the description of the new genus Salmacisia. The genus name is derived from Salmacis, who, according to Greek mythology, transformed the boy Hermaphroditus into an individual with both male and female sexual characteristics. Description Salmacisia species are defined as those with fruiting structures (technically known as sori) that originate only in the ovaries of infected plants, where clumps of dirty-brown agglutinated spores are formed. The spores are covered with surface ornamentations (spines or reticulations), and arise from cells of spore- creating mycelia, frequently encased in a translucent jelly-like sheath. The spores germinate by means of continuous promycelium (the germ tube of the spore) that bear primary basidiospores that can be have either one nucleus, which conjugate, or two nuclei, giving rise to secondary basidiospores. The morphological characteristics of Salmacisia are indistinguishable from species of Tilletia, they may be distinguished from this genus and other genera of the Tilletiaceae family by differences in their ribosomal DNA sequences. Effect on host The sex organs in the induced hermaphroditic flowers become sterile as a result of infection, a process known as \\"parasitic castration\\". Ovaries become sterile because they become replaced with teliospores and form \\"smut balls\\", making the ovary unable to set seed. The anthers, however, do not show outward signs of teliospore production, but are still effectively sterile because they tend to be small and immature. Consequently, both male and female reproductive organs within induced hermaphroditic flowers of buffalograss become parasitically castrated, but for different reasons. Infection does not kill the host plants (under greenhouse conditions), rather, the plant and fungus coexist, and infected plants sometimes begin to lose symptoms of infection after three years.

This is found mainly in the ants of the subfamily Amblyoponinae and give them the other name of Dracula ant. In colonies of the Amblyopone silvestrii the queens feed on the hemolymph (or insect blood, also spelt haemolymph) of their larvae when food is not available.

On the other hand, the foundresses suppress larval hemolymph feeding (LHF) when prey is available, allowing them to rear the first workers more swiftly. The nondestructive form of cannibalism can be regarded as a nutritive adaptation related to: (1) the lack of social food transfer in this species, and (2) its specialized predation on large sporadic prey (centipedes). LHF similar to that in Amblyopone was found in Proceratium and another type of LHF, with a larval specialized exudatory organ, in Leptanilla.

The majority of the members were indeed young and came to represent a new generation of Mexican scholars, reacting specifically against positivism and its prevalence in the ideology of the regime of Dictator Porfirio Diaz.Earle, 835. The group sought a revindication of the humanities as the center of cultural creation. The \\"Ateneo\\" The Ateneo officially convened on the 28 of October, 1909.Pedraza, 25.

Finally, in the summer of 1909, Antonio Caso organized a series of conferencesPedraza, 22. dealing with the history of Positivism, given at the National Preparatory School, an institution founded on positivist principles and source of Mexican educational since its creation in 1868.Pedraza, 4. As stated in the official statutes of the club when, in 1912, it took the name Ateneo de M√©xico, the principal goal of the association was to promote intellectual and artistic culture.Pedraza, 26. The same document outlines the strategies proposed in this effort. The members held public meetings, discussions, and lectures, and published a journal. The fundamental ideology of the Ateneo was a rejection of positivistic influences on education and culture. Instead, the members of the Ateneo thought, the humanities would be responsible for the revitalization of Mexican culture, the group's ultimate concern. Members of the Ateneo such as Alfonso Reyes stressed the importance of classical scholarship and additionally looked to the works of modern continental philosophers such as Kant, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Bergson, as well as Spanish writers such as Jose Ortega y Gasset, to propound new values for human societies which were contrary to scientific and positivistic trends in thought.Pedraza, 33.

It refers to a data structure whose operations are roughly as fast as those of a conventional data structure for the problem, but whose size can be substantially smaller. The size of the compressed data structure is typically highly dependent upon the entropy of the data being represented. Important examples of compressed data structures include the compressed suffix arrayR. Grossi and J. S.

Given any input pattern P, they support the operation of finding if and where P appears in T. The search time is proportional to the sum of the length of pattern P, a very slow-growing function of the length of the text T, and the number of reported matches. The space they occupy is roughly equal to the size of the text T in entropy- compressed form, such as that obtained by Prediction by Partial Matching or gzip. Moreover, both data structures are self-indexing, in that they can reconstruct the text T in a random access manner, and thus the underlying text T can be discarded. In other words, they simultaneously provide a compressed and quickly searchable representation of the text T. They represent a substantial space improvement over the conventional suffix tree and suffix array, which occupy many times more space than the size of T. They also support searching for arbitrary patterns, as opposed to the inverted index, which can support only word-based searches. In addition, inverted indexes do not have the self-indexing feature. An important related notion is that of a succinct data structure, which uses space roughly equal to the information- theoretic minimum, which is a worst-case notion of the space needed to represent the data. In contrast, the size of a compressed data structure depends upon the particular data being represented. When the data are compressible, as is often the case in practice for natural language text, the compressed data structure can occupy space very close to the information- theoretic minimum, and significantly less space than most compression schemes.

He is the recipient of awards from the National Writers Union and the New York State Council on the Arts, and has twice been a visiting artist at The American Academy in Rome. McCarthy was a professor of English at St. Thomas Aquinas College in Sparkill, New York. Wartime experiences As a 17-year-old marine, McCarthy served in Vietnam in 1966-7, unloading cargo from ships at FLSG-Bravo with the 1st Marines, after which he was transferred to the 1st Combat Engineer Battalion in Chu Lai and then Danang. After one tour, McCarthy deserted the military and did time in civilian jail and military prison. His early work, collected in War Story, is an unflinching yet understated meditation on his scarifying experiences in Vietnam. He remains a committed anti-war activist, and has participated in actions by Vets for Peace and Vietnam Veterans Against the War. McCarthy reflects on the brutalizing effects of the military experience in Bloody Hell: The Price Soldiers Pay By Dan Hallock (Plough Publishing House, 1999), where he says, \\"Forget going to war...I wouldn't even go back to boot camp...I think it can change you psychologically forever.\\"(p. 89) Formative years After his discharge, McCarthy worked as a stonecutter and shoe-factory worker. Fatefully, he decided to attend the University of Iowa Writers Workshop, a formative experience that helped shape his emerging voice as a poet, as did his time teaching writing at Attica Prison and in migrant labor camps, jails, and schools. McCarthy's work is informed by his Italian- American heritage (McCarthy's mother was Italian, his father Irish American) and his hard-luck upbringing in the blue-collar factory town of Endicott, New York (an experience that reverberates in his autobiographical book of poems Shoetown). The Amazon blurb for his book Trouble Light quotes the author's comment that his sketches of Italy, in that book, \\"are not pastoral poems of the landscape, but poems about memory and the connectedness of historical experience.\\" His poetry, fiction, and criticism have appeared in New Letters, TriQuarterly, America, Beloit Poetry Journal, Ohio Review, RATTLE magazine, Ploughshares,http://www.pshares.org/authors/author-detail.cfm?authorID=1003 Poet Lore, Nimrod, Carrying the Darkness, From Both Sides Now, A New Geography of Poets, Unaccustomed Mercy: Soldier Poets of The Vietnam War, Asheville Poetry Review, and other magazines and anthologies. Critical reception Critics have focused on the carefully observed detail in McCarthy's writing, his use of concrete, haiku-like images to communicate keen insight and deep feeling in a few terse words. As well, they've noted his depth of feeling for working-class people, prisoners, and other marginalized members of society, and the quiet authority of his critique of the Vietnam war---of all wars. In a Pedestal magazine review of Trouble Light, critic JoSelle Vanderhooft wrote, Review of Trouble Light \\"Each of these poems bristles with immediate, lively imagery and detail---the father‚Äôs hands 'not curled or shaking,/ but thick, articulate,' the father 'half believing his own lie' as he daydreams about the might-have-beens of a lost son‚Äôs future. [...] [McCarthy's] poems about the rural landscape and his family‚Äôs place within it are exquisite...Whether soldier or prisoner, laborer or father, lost son or disenfranchised steel worker, McCarthy‚Äôs talent lies in showing the reader the faces behind the pages of his work. His skillful, intricate and deeply literary poetry...is urgent and deeply contemplative.\\" Amazon reviewer Margot Mifflin observed: > McCarthy's declarative style, sharpened with a jagged edge of irony, keeps > Trouble Light free of sentimental indulgence. A poem, for example, about a > day of work at Tri-City Beverage in Johnson City, wherever that is, closes > with the image of the town arches, inscribed with the words, 'Home of the > Square Deal.' A poem set on the Fourth of July ends with the poignant > understatement (coming from a vet), 'The noise of fireworks catches me off > guard.' Trouble Light is wistful and precise, suffused with the sensuality > of nature, strewn with detritus of industry and haunted by the ghosts of > war. Its power lies in its terrific restraint... Personal life A former professor of English at St. Thomas Aquinas College, McCarthy lives with his wife Michele and their three sons in Nyack, New York.

Smith, along with the preacher Abner Jones, founded a group of Christian Churches in New England that eventually merged with other like-minded, regional groups to become the denomination known as the Christian Connexion. Smith founded The Herald of Gospel Liberty in 1808, which he claimed (in his autobiography) to be \\"the world's first religious newspaper\\". It was not the first in the world, but may have been the first in the U.S. The Herald had two purposes: (1) reporting news of revivals and (2) promoting \\"religious liberty\\", by which he meant an end to tax supported churches. (Several states had official tax supported churches at the time.)Hines, Michael. The Christian Chronicler Smith proved to be a controversial figure in the Christian Connexion, leaving the denomination for several years to become a Universalist. Smith's apostacy to Universalism encouraged the Christian Connexion to more clearly define the boundaries of their beliefs and identity. Smith publicly renounced Universalism in 1823, but was not well received and reverted to it for a couple of years. Smith again attempted a re-entry to the Connexion with another repudiation of Universalism in 1827. His brethren were understandably hesitant to accept him, but his home congregation of Portsmouth, NH received him back in fellowship in 1840.Smith, Elias.

About one third of the members have had professional music training, the others are amateur musicians. All of the physicians engage in regular musical activity and play both in professional and non-professional orchestras as well as in chamber music ensembles. Conductor Founder and conductor of the World Doctors Orchestra is Stefan Willich, director of the Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics at the Charit√© University Medical Center in Berlin and former president of the Berlin Academy of Music Hanns Eisler. Willich studied violin, chamber music, and conducting in Stuttgart and Berlin. In his professional career as physician he became a highly regarded cardiologist and researcher, focusing on cardiovascular disease, prevention, health economics, integrative medicine, as well as music and medicine. He worked for several years at Harvard Medical School in Boston, and was appointed professor and director of the Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics at the Charit√© University Medical Center in Berlin in 1995.

Early life John Rae was born at Aberdeen, Scotland, the son of George Rae, banker, and his wife Jane, n√©e Edmond. He was educated at the Aberdeen Grammar School, Marischal College and University of Aberdeen. He graduated Master of Arts in 1832. He studied law and in 1839 went to Australia to take up the position of secretary and accountant to the North British Australasian Loan and Investment Company. Career as an administrator He arrived in Sydney on 8 December 1839. In 1842 he was responsible for the letterpress for Sydney Illustrated, and was appointed town clerk of Sydney on 27 July 1843, the second to occupy that position. At the end of 1853 the Sydney corporation was abolished, and from 1 January 1854 the city was managed by three commissioners, of whom Rae was one. In 1856 John Smith, then mayor of Melbourne, endeavored to have Rae appointed town clerk of Melbourne, but Edmond Gerald Fitzgibbon was chosen for the position. In April 1857 the city council of Sydney was again constituted, and in July Rae was appointed secretary and accountant to the railway commissioners. In January 1861 he became under-secretary for works and commissioner for railways. In this post, he supported a standard gauge throughout the colonies. In 1877 Rae gave up the office of commissioner for railways, and in 1888 he became a member of the civil service board. He retired in 1893 at the age of 80. Artistic and personal life Upon his arrival in Sydney, he became interested in the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts; he delivered in connection with it a series of lectures on \\"Taste\\" and \\"The English Language\\" in 1841. In August 1844 a fancy dress ball was given by the mayor of Sydney, the first of its kind in Australia. Rae wrote The Mayor's Fancy Ball, a long humorous and satirical poem on this event which was printed anonymously in four issues of The Sydney Morning Herald in April 1845. He married Elizabeth Thompson in the same year. His first acknowledged publication was The Book of the Prophet Isaiah rendered into English Blank Verse, which was published in 1853. He published in 1869, Gleanings from my Scrap-Book in two series, collections of his work in verse, which were followed by Gleanings from My ScrapBook: Third Series, dated 1874. This consisted of The Mayor's Fancy Ball already referred to. The three series were printed by the author himself, and are remarkably good examples of amateur printing. He was also a good amateur painter in water-colours; a series of 26 views of the streets of Sydney are held by the Mitchell Library, Sydney. At his death in 1900 he was survived by four sons and two daughters.

Education Hora attended middle school at Matsumoto Kukashi High School () and high school at Waseda University High School (). He was a graduate of Waseda University's literature department. He received his Doctor of Letters from Waseda. Nanjing Massacre In 1972, Hora published his seminal Nankin Jiken, in which he refuted revisionist denial of the Nanking Massacre.Takashi Yoshida. The making of the \\"Rape of Nanking\\". 2006, page 87 The work updated his 1967 Kindai senshi no nazo (\\"Riddles of Modern War History\\"). This detailed treatment of the incident was a meaningful, in-depth response to revisionist accounts of Imperial Japanese action in China. Hora's Nankin Jiken appeared amidst controversy in regards to the Nanjing Massacre scholarship of Honda Katsuichi, whose Chugoku no tabi (\\"Travels in China\\") recorded Chinese eyewitness accounts of Japanese wartime atrocities.Fogel, Joshua A. The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography. 2000, page 80-84 Honda's account garnered much support and stimulated debate in Japan, while at the same time attracting fearsome nationalistic defenses of Japanese military activity in the period, which materialized as historical debates, rhetorical attacks, and personal threats. Hora's Nankin Jiken then appeared, which bolstered Honda's interview- based research with a documentary record, answering various attempts to undercut the Nanjing Massacre in Japanese historiography. Throughout the 1970s, Hora continued his struggle against revisionist works, publishing a number of scholarly monographs and documents on the events of the war. In 1984, he became a founding member of the Study Group on the Nanking Incident, a diverse group of scholars, lawyers, and teachers, who held a variety of views but agreed that \\"they had to face the past wrongs committed by Japan\\".Fogel, Joshua A.

Snyder was formerly a prominent press secretary and public relations manager. He is best known for his work with Democrats, including John F. Street, Ed Rendell, and Vince Fumo. He earned a master's degree from Loyola University Chicago and pursued a Ph.D. at University of Wisconsin. He began his career working on John F. Street's first campaign for Mayor of Philadelphia. In that position, he became known to Senator Vince Fumo, who hired Snyder to work in the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee. During the 2002 United States Senate election in New Jersey, he managed the campaign for Bob Torricelli, a job that PoliticsPA called \\"masochism\\" and \\"a challenge and huge opportunity.\\" After Torricelli was replaced by Frank Lautenberg on the ballot, Snyder stayed on the campaign and helped achieve victory. Immediately following the Pennsylvania gubernatorial election in 2002, Fumo lent Snyder, who was one of Fumo's \\"key political staffers,\\" to Ed Rendell, where he worked as acting press sectary for the Governor-elect from November 2002 to March 2003. He then returned to work in the private sector. In 2009, he was hired by the Governor to serve as communications employee charged with publicizing the state's take of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The controversial hiring, which appeared to violate Rendell's well-publicized state hiring freeze during the 2009 Pennsylvania budget impasse, was questioned by government reform advocates, including Eric Epstein. Later in 2009, he took on an expanded portfolio as interim press secretary with the departure of Chuck Ardo, Rendell's long-time press secretary. He is \\"considered by many ... to be among the most intelligent spokesmen and strategists around.\\" Within political circles, he is \\"widely regarded and respected by Republicans and Democrats alike.\\" Overall, PoliticsPA called him \\"One of the best political press secretaries in the state.\\" In 2010, Politics Magazine named him one of the most influential Democrats in Pennsylvania. In July 2010, Snyder and fellow political consultant Terrie Pickerill formed SnyderPickerill Media Group. They met while working for David Axelrod on John Schmidt's unsuccessful 1997 gubernatorial campaign, and both cite him as a mentor.

Zhou attempted to enter Hong Kong from the United States via Macau using a forged Malaysian passport. Zhou's supporters alleged the renditioning to be illegal, and his lawyer, Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho, described Zhou's case as \\"posing the biggest challenge to the one country, two systems principle laid down in the Basic Law.\\" The Government of Hong Kong refused to comment on individual cases, and the People's Republic of China said Zhou was detained on several charges, including one of financial fraud.  Background on Zhou  Zhou was a student at the China University of Political Science and Law at the time of the student protests and ensuing military crackdown on 4 June 1989. He was among a group of students who were photographed kneeling in front of the Great Hall of the People on 22 April that year to present a list of demands to China's leaders after the death of Hu Yaobang. Zhou was arrested and held for two years in prison for his role in the protests. He subsequently lost his enrolment status as a student as well as his family registration as a Beijing resident. In 1992, Zhou fled to Hong Kong and then travelled to the United States, where he was granted resident's status. His first attempt to re-enter China was in 1998, but he was caught and sentenced to three years of administrative detention in a re-education-through-labour camp. After his release, he again left in 2002 for the United States,  The incident   Illegal entry into Hong Kong  Zhou made a second attempt to reenter mainland China on 28 September 2008, but he was intercepted by immigration department officials at the Hong Kong Macau Ferry Terminal, on suspicion of entering Hong Kong using a counterfeited travel document. He had travelled from the United States to Macao, using a Malaysian passport purchased from a travel agent in Los Angeles. The passport was in the name of Wang Xingxiang, a known alias of Zhong Gong leader Zhang Hongbao. He had repeatedly been denied requests for an official permit to return to China by the Chinese authorities. Zhou was on his way to Sichuan to visit his ailing father. Zhou was documented in Sichuan saying he was detained on arrival in Hong Kong and then secretly handed over to Shenzhen authorities two days later. Lawyer Li Jinjin said Zhou was initially held at the No.1 Detention Center in the southern city of Shenzhen, and later transferred to the Shenzhen Yantian Detention Center. In May 2009, seven months after his arrest, Zhou's family was notified that he had been detained by Sichuan authorities on fraud charges. The indictment by prosecutors in Shehong county stated Zhou used the alias of Wang Xingxiang, and attempted to transfer money from an account at Hang Seng Bank in Hong Kong to two banks, in the city and in Australia. His lawyer, pan-democrat legislator Albert Ho, held a press conference on 12 October 2009 during which he said his client was picked up by immigration officers, put into a van and driven across the border to mainland China against his will. Ho said that normal protocol would be to send him back to his place of origin, which in this case would be Macau or the United States. Furthermore, Ho noted that there was no agreement with the mainland on extradition, and demanded that the Hong Kong government explain why Zhou was handed over to Shenzhen authorities; he appealed to Chief Executive Donald Tsang to make available police records of the incident and to press for Zhou's release. The Hong Kong Government, speaking only in general terms, said in an official statement that \\"a passenger whose travel document does not meet the entry requirements will be repatriated to his or her place of embarkation or origin.\\"  The trial  Zhou was tried in Shehong, and was sentenced to nine years in jail for a fraud attempted in Hong Kong. The Times remarked that \\"details of the charges against Zhou are vague, as is common in China‚Äôs opaque legal system.\\" Wang Xingxiang, the name in Zhou's bogus passport, was placed on a money laundering watch list following a complaint by the Hang Seng Bank received a suspicious request to transfer HK$6 million out of an account registered in that name. The transfer was not completed as the signature on the transfer form did not match that of the account signatory. After Zhou was sentenced, Secretary for Security, Ambrose Lee, rejected accusations the government knowingly turned Zhou over to the mainland authorities. On the other hand, he also denied there had been any serious errors in the Hong Kong Government's handling of the incident.Fung, Fanny & Tsang, Phyllis (4 February 2010), Minister denies HK knowingly handed over dissident, South China Morning Post The SCMP article on this goes on to state that \\"However, a person with direct knowledge of the case said immigration officers did not know Zhou's real identity when they repatriated him and that Zhou did not state that he had residency in another country when officers told him that he would be sent to the mainland.\\" An editorial in the South China Morning Post on 6 February 2010 said the Chinese government action appeared to be extra-territorial. it criticised the Hong Kong government for hiding behind bland statements, and urged it to defend the principle of 'One country, two systems'Editorial (6 February), \\"A stain on 'two systems' that won't go away \\", South China Morning Post  References  External links * mirror mirror mirror Category:1989 Tiananmen Square protests Category:2009 in Hong Kong Category:Political controversies in China Category:Human rights in China ","title":"Zhou Yongjun incident"},{"id":"24757535","text":"Ashford.com is an online retailer of luxury watches and other luxury goods.

Taking place in the year 2011 in an alternate reality version of Boston, Massachusetts, players BASE jump from the highest building, trying to get the highest possible score. Gameplay AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a game where players BASE jump headfirst from the top of the highest building downwards. The game is viewed in a 3D first-person perspective. Players score points by flying near objects on the way down, smashing through various colored glass plates, landing via parachute on a designated drop zone, and not ending up as a sack of broken bones. Players also receive points for \\"kissing\\" (flying very close to) buildings or other airborne obstacles, and for \\"hugging\\" (remaining in close proximity to) these obstacles as they fall. Players receive bonus points for \\"threading the needle\\", spraying paint on buildings, giving a thumbs-up to fans and making rude gestures to protestors. Hitting a bird is also worth quite some points. Hugs and kisses are the main way to increase score. Structures, obstacles, and objects vary amongst levels. Some levels feature mountain slopes, floating and/or moving structures, birds, and abstract art. Players are rated for how well they jump, and they attain \\"teeth\\" for achieving certain benchmark high scores on jumps. Teeth allow players to unlock new levels, items (which includes espresso to help slow down jumps, graffiti to spray on buildings, and a glove designed to give a thumbs up to supporters or a two-fingered salute to protesters), and other obscure things such as guided meditations and pig de-bristling techniques. Earning high enough scores allow players to post their scores on online leaderboards. Developers say the game was inspired by BASE jumping in a wingsuit. Development The first version of AaAaAA!!! was a prototype that was based on people who were base jumping off the side of a mountain. One of the challenges of developing this game was building a core gameplay mechanic and then simplifying it down to what was necessary. It was then developed as a spin-off of a previous game, Inago Rage. Some of the influences during the development were Alternate Reality: The City, M.U.L.E. and Koronis Rift. Other titles In 2011 an updated version, subtitled For the Awesome was released in collaboration with Owlchemy Labs. It includes several graphical upgrades and new expert levels, as well as every level from the original game. Also added to this version was support for the Oculus Rift Virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD). In 2012, again in collaboration with Owlchemy Labs, mobile port AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! (Force = Mass x Acceleration) was released for iOS and Android. The game currently has a rating of 90% on Metacritic based on 12 critic reviews. In a third collaboration with Owlchemy Labs, a second Android port titled Caaaardboard!!!! (Aaaaa! Cardboard Edition!) was released in 2014, designed solely for use with the Google Cardboard virtual reality platform. Reception AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity has received generally favorable reviews, as seen by the aggregate scores of 81/100 at Metacritic. The game was a 2010 Independent Games Festival finalist for Excellence in Design. It was recognized by Guinness World Records for the \\"longest word in the title of a commercially released video game\\", being 28 characters long.
