He was educated at Deptford Grammar School. In 1881 he married Hannah Elizabeth, the daughter of James and Hannah Abbott of Bermondsey. They had three sons and a daughter. One of their sons was James Harold Abbott Glanville (1884‚Äì1966) who also had a career in public service and was President of the Liberal Party in 1959‚Äì60.The Times, 18 March 1959 p14 Hannah Glanville died in 1891. Harold was married for a second time in 1918 to Bertha Nimmo, a widow from Brockley.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Career On leaving school, Glanville entered the General Post Office but afterwards he worked for a while in his father's office. In 1883 he entered into partnership with his father-in-law and for over 30 years carried on the business of mill furnishers, being head of the firm of James White Abbott & Co. However he always took a keen interest in public affairs.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Politics Bermondsey politics Glanville started off in local politics. He served on the Bermondsey Vestry,The Times House of Commons 1911; Politico's Publishing 2004 p 29 a body set up under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 as a second tier of local government in London. In 1889 he was prominent in a campaign to stop the provision of meals and refreshments to vestrymen and officials on the rates.The Times House of Commons 1919; Politico's Publishing 2004 pp 17‚Äì18 At this time Glanville was Secretary of the Bermondsey Liberal and Radical Association and was involved in a court case arising from a disturbance at a Vestry meeting where members of the public were being excluded from the proceedings.The Times, 10 July 1889 p4 London County Council Glanville graduated from the Vestry to the London County Council (LCC).

During his years on the Council Glanville held many local positions in the borough of Bermondsey and he also served as a Justice of the Peace for the County of London.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Parliament Glanville's first Parliamentary contest was for the constituency of Rotherhithe at the 1892 general election but he lost to the Conservative John Cumming Macdona by 1,230 votes.The Times House of Commons 1910; Politico's Publishing 2004 p 28 His next chance came in 1909 when he was adopted as Liberal candidate for Bermondsey.The Times, 20 December 1909 p9 There had been a by-election in the seat on 28 October 1909. The sitting Liberal MP, George Joseph Cooper had died and the Liberals adopted Spencer Leigh Hughes, a journalist, to contest the constituency. However, the by- election was won by the Conservative John Dumphreys who turned a Liberal majority of 1,759 at the 1906 general election into a Conservative majority of 987 ‚Äì the intervention of a Labour candidate who got 1,435 votes having split the anti-Tory vote.The Times House of Commons 1910; Politico's Publishing 2004 p 28 Hughes then moved to Stockport where he was elected in the general election of January 1910.The Times House of Commons 1910; Politico's Publishing 2004 p 51 This gave the Bermondsey Liberals the chance to pick a local man and Glanville was the successful applicant. He duly won the seat back in January 1910 in a straight fight against Dumphreys. He held the seat in the general election of December 1910 and served until 1918 when the constituency was abolished in boundary changes. A General Election had been expected to take place in either 1914 or 1915, at which, Glanville was expected to face a challenge, not only from a Unionist but also from an Independent Labour Party candidate, Dr Alfred Salter.Political Change and the Labour Party 1900‚Äì1918 By Duncan Tanner During the earlier part of his Parliamentary career, Glanville was credited with playing a prominent part, as a backbencher, in the Liberal Party's programme of social reform legislation.The Times, 22 February 1966 p12 Glanville then switched to the new seat of Bermondsey West. At the 1918 general election he was opposed by a Coalition Liberal, i.e. a member of that section of the party supporting Prime Minister David Lloyd George in his Coalition government with the Conservative Party. This candidate, Mr C R Scriven, presumably received the Coalition Coupon. Glanville also faced Labour opposition and an Independent candidate supported by the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Soldiers and Sailors.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918‚Äì1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p6 During this period of his time in Parliament, Glanville assumed duties for the government in relation to claims and allowances arising from the First World War and he was helped in discharging these duties by his son, H J A Glanville, who later went on to be a Progressive member of the LCC.The Times, 22 February 1966 p12 Glanville did not stand for re-election in 1922 as he was almost 70 years old by this time. However he earlier nearly got into the House of Lords. In the struggle between the Liberal government and the House of Lords over the Parliament Act 1911, H H Asquith proposed to the King the creation of many new Liberal peers to ensure the measure could be carried if the Lords continued to obstruct.

During the Middle Ages, the palace served as a residence of the Plantagenet kings of England. It fell into disuse sometime during the 16th century and became a ruin. Today, nothing remains of the building except for some archaeological remains. The site is a scheduled ancient monument. History The origins of Kings Langley Palace are not known, but it is thought that the estate land was originally the property of the Manor of Chilterne Langley or Langley Chenduit. The estate would have part of a large, dense forest stretching from London out to Berkhamsted which was abundant in deer, and a hunting lodge is known to have existed on the estate during the reign of Henry III. The Manor became a royal possession in 1276 when Queen Eleanor of Castile, wife of King Edward I (\\"Edward Longshanks\\"), acquired the estate and supervised the development of a lavish royal household. There are records of a \\"new start\\" in 1277, and these are thought to be either improvements to an existing property or a new house being built at the top of the hill. Little is known about the early development of the palace, but records exist from 1279-1281 which indicate that the palace had private chambers for the Edward I and Eleanor and for their son, Alphonso, Earl of Chester. King's Langley Palace served as a family home for Edward and Eleanor. Their son, Edward of Caernarfon (later King Edward II), who was born in Caernarfon Castle in 1284, spent much of his youth at Langley Palace. Prince Alfonso, heir to the throne, died only months after the young Edward's birth, and Queen Eleanor died unexpectedly in 1290. With Prince Edward now heir to the throne, Langley Palace, was destined to be inherited by the young prince. After Eleanor's death, the King took residence at Ashridge and held Parliament there in 1290 and 1291. In 1299 the aging King Edward I remarried to Margaret of France, granting her Berkhamsted and Hertford Castles, and he returned to Langley. That same year, he summoned the Bishop of Norwich, John Salmon, John of Berkhamsted, Abbot of St. Albans, and Aymon, Count of Savoy, to celebrate the feast day of All Saints with him and Queen Margraret at King's Langley. After Prince Edward was invested as Prince of Wales, King Edward I granted Langley to him in 1302. The young prince was enthusiastic about music, the arts, horse racing and kept a small menagerie, which included a lion and a camel, at Langley. He also allowed his favourite, Piers Gaveston, to live with him at the palace, a companionship which scandalised England at the time. In 1307 Edward II was crowned king and founded the neighbouring King's Langley Priory in 1308 in the park of his manor adjacent to the palace. It was here that King Edward reburied his beloved Gaveston in January 1315 following his execution. Langley Palace remained the King's favourite residence until his death in 1327.May McKusack, The Fourteenth Century (Oxford History of England) 1959.2. Today, no traces of the monastery church or Gaveston's tomb remain.Walter Phelps Dodge, Piers Gaveston: a chapter of early constitutional history, 1899:179; May Kusack, The Fourteenth Century (Oxford History of England) 1959:47; The surviving building of the former Dominican priory established in 1308 by Edward II, next to the Palace Engraving of a farm building which was thought to incorporate some remains of Kings Langley Palace (J. Greig/F.W.L. Stockdale, 1816) During the reign of Edward III, his fifth son, Edmund of Langley was born in Langley Palace in 1341 and drew his name from the manor. After his death in 1402, Edmund was buried in the priory there. In the late 1340s, England was being ravaged by the spread of Black Death; with high death rates in London, Edward III moved his Court out of the city to Langley Palace in July 1349, and for a short period the seat of government was based in Kings Langley. Edward also removed his extensive collection of religious relics from the Tower of London and brought them to Kings Langley for safekeeping. The author of The Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer, would have visited the palace during his appointment as Clerk of the Kings Works to King Richard II between 1389 and 1391. Later King Richard II celebrated Christmas there. The Palace was damaged by a serious fire in 1431; accounts describe \\"a great and disastrous fire at the manor of our lady Joan the Queen at Langley\\" (referring to Joan of Navarre, wife of Henry IV) which was blamed on \\"the negligence and drowsiness of a ministrel and insufficient care of a lighted candle.\\" However, records of subsequent repair work to the buildings indicate that the palace was not entirely destroyed by the fire. The last evidence of the Palace being used for official occasions was in 1476 when William Wallingford, Abbot of St. Albans, held a banquet there for the Bishop of Llandaff. The manor was transferred to Eton College but reverted to the Crown, for Henry VIII conveyed it upon Catherine of Aragon, whom he was about to marry. During Henry's reign, a new class of landowner emerged; instead of estates being held by powerful feudal lords who were often a challenge to the sovereign, estates were now being granted to servants of the crown. Holders of high office were granted freehold land as a reward from the king, and they used their new property as a source of income. John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, was given custody of the royal park at Kings Langley in 1538, one of many perquisites he accumulated at the court of Henry VIII. The park was acquired by a wealthy lawyer, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England and the builder of Old Gorhambury House near St Albans. During the reign of Charles I, Kings Langley royal park was cleared to make way for agriculture and tenant farmers cultivated the land. By 1652 there were 10 farmers on the estate. In 1626, Charles I granted the Langley Estate to Sir Charles Morrison, owner of the Estate of Cassiobury at nearby Watford who already held a lease on part of the land at Langley. Upon his death in 1628, the estate passed to his daughter, Elizabeth Morrison and her husband Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham. Capell, a Royalist in the English Civil War was executed in 1649, and the estate was granted to a Parliamentarian, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex. Following the Restoration, the Langley Estate was returned by the Crown to the Capell family, granting it to Capell's son Arthur Capell and also creating him Earl of Essex. In the late 17th century the expansion of the London population meant that landowners in the surrounding country were increasingly turning their land to agricultural use, to meet the demand for food and animal feed. Many parks eventually disappeared; Kings Langley Park did not feature on a 1675 map drawn by John Seller. The estate of Langley Palace remained in the possession of the Earls of Essex until 1900, when the 7th Earl, George Capell, sold the land to a Mr. E. N. Loyd of Langleybury. Remnants of the Palace complex remained for many years after it ceased to be a royal residence, falling gradually into decay. The gatehouse and parts of the main building were still standing in 1591, and in his 1728 History of Hertfordshire, Nathanael Salmon states that \\"Here the rubbish of royalty exists\\" in reference to Kings Langley. James Sargant Storer's 1816 account features an illustration of the \\"Remains of an Ancient Palace Kings Langley Herts\\" which is said to be a farm house which \\"exhibits the ancient bake-house and some other vestiges of the domestic offices of the palace.\\" A description published by John Murray in 1895 reports that \\"at Kings Langley some outer walls only exist of the once royal palace, erected by Henry III.\\" Today, nothing remains of the royal palace; the site was occupied by the Rudolf Steiner School, which closed in March 2019. A small display case of items from the Palace era recovered during excavation could previously be seen in the school entrance hall. Buildings from King's Langley Priory were also used by the Steiner School.Lionel M, Munby, The History of Kings Langley Some ruins exist in the vicinity; ruined flint walls and fragments of stonework remain in the garden of house number 80, Langley Hill, which are thought to be part of a house built for Sir Charles Morrisson around 1580 when he held a lease on the Crown land. Map showing the approximate location of the Kings Langley Palace site Architecture The Palace had a triple courtyard layout. Accounts dating from August 1279 to November 1281, shortly after the estate became a royal possession, describe building work on the house which encompassed construction of chambers for the king and queen and for their son, Alphonso, Earl of Chester, paving the queen's cloister, planting of a vineyard, digging of a well and expansion of a moat. Further records list the construction of a new gateway (1282‚Äì83); a wine cellar (1291-92); louvres for the roof of the hall built by a carpenter, Henry of Bovingdon; a stone wall enclosing the court (1296‚Äì97); and the addition of new fireplaces in two \\"great chambers\\". The palace had a bath-house, domestic offices, a bakery, roasting house, great kitchen and \\"le Longrewe\\" (\\"the long house\\"). Between 1359 and 1370, further additions were made to the palace, which included a bath house and a new entrance gate at a cost of ¬£3000, and Totternhoe Stone was used to pave the bath house and for a fireplace in the King's chamber. It appears from excavations in 1970 that the Palace also had a huge underground wine cellar, situated under the present-day gymnasium; this cellar is thought to have been built around 1291-92 and was located on the west side of a kitchen court, opposite a bakehouse. Excavations also revealed the presence of a structure to the east of this which is thought to be a probable gatehouse. This gatehouse opened out onto an approach road, now known as Langley Hill. Because the kitchens were located on the west side of the site, it is thought that the great hall of the palace ran on an east-west alignment. Records exists stating that a brickmaker to the king, William Veyse, was appointed in 1437 to produce bricks for Kings Langley Palace. In 1440 bricks from le Frithe, near St Albans, were used to make fireplaces and ovens in the Palace, possibly as part of repair works following the fire of 1431. Veyse was also appointed in 1440 to supply bricks for a stone wall at the Tower of London. In Literature Act III, scene IV of William Shakespeare's play Richard II is set in the gardens of Kings Langley Palace, in which Queen Isabel learns of King Richard's imprisonment.

It generally began with a chill and a body temperature of . As the temperature rose higher, muscular pains began, with headache, loss of appetite, nausea, and marked weakness. Many patients spontaneously recovered within a week.

In an effort to establish a retrospective diagnosis, pathologist James Ewing of New York City studied blood samples of 800 patients suffering from the disease, and found that 80 percent of the cases of Cuban fever were of the aestiva-autumnal type of malarial fever, and the remaining 20 percent suffered from tertian malaria.

A number of variants were proposed but only the prototype was built. Design and development The DM-165 was a tandem two-seat low-wing monoplane. Powered by a 165 hp (121 kW) Continental IO-346A flat-four piston engine. It had a tailwheel and retractable landing gear which folded inwards. Dalotel was assisted by Soci√©t√© Poulet in the construction of the prototype, registered F-PPZE, which was first flown in April 1969. The aircraft was successfully tested during 1970 but despite efforts to market the aircraft none were ordered. The aircraft was based at Meaux-Esbly airfield, to the west of Paris, for several years and was then sold to a pilot owner in the United Kingdom. The aircraft had a forced landing in a cornfield due to fuel management issues in about 1983. The aircraft was damaged in the accident and flipped over onto its back, significantly damaging the RH wing, and doing minor damage to the LH wing, fuselage, cowl, and tail section. The aircraft was put into storage for years and was subsequently sold to a gentleman in the US (Idaho) who imported the remains for rebuild and restoration. After some work was done on it, it was sold to a gentleman in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where it is currently being restored.

The term is now commonly used to describe a variety of small business financing options characterized by short payment terms (generally under 24 months) and small regular payments (typically paid each business day) as opposed to the larger monthly payments and longer payment terms associated with traditional bank loans. The term \\"merchant cash advance\\" may be used to describe purchases of future credit card sales receivables or short-term business loans.  Concept  Merchant cash advance companies provide funds to businesses in exchange for a percentage of the businesses' daily credit card income, directly from the processor that clears and settles the credit card payment. A company's remittances are drawn from customers' debit and credit-card purchases on a daily basis until the obligation has been met. Most providers form partnerships with payment processors and then take a fixed or variable percentage of a merchant's future credit card sales. These merchant cash advances are not loans ‚Äî rather, they are a sale of a portion of future credit and/or debit card sales. Therefore, merchant cash advance companies claim that they are not bound by state usury laws that limit lenders from charging high-interest rates. This technicality allows them to operate in a largely unregulated market and charge much higher interest rates than banks. On June 10, 2016, a New York Supreme Court judge presiding over a published merchant cash advance case ruled that \\"if the transaction is not a loan, there can be no usury,\\" adding also that asking the court to convert an agreement to sell future receivables into a loan agreement \\"would require unwarranted speculation.\\" This structure may have some advantages over the structure of a conventional loan. Payments to the merchant cash advance company fluctuate directly with the merchant's sales volumes, giving the merchant greater flexibility with which to manage their cash flow, particularly during a slow season. Advances are processed quicker than a typical loan, giving borrowers quicker access to capital. Also, because MCA providers typically give more weight to the underlying performance of a business than the owner‚Äôs personal credit scores, merchant cash advances offer an alternative to businesses who may not qualify for a conventional loan. An example transaction is as follows: A business sells $25,000 of a portion of its future credit card sales for an immediate $20,000 lump sum payment from a finance company. The finance company then collects its portion (generally 15-35%) from every credit card and/or debit card sale until the entire $25,000 is collected.  Usage  Merchant cash advances are most often used by retail businesses that do not qualify for regular bank loans and are generally more expensive than bank loans. Competition and innovation led to downward pressure on rates and terms are now more closely correlated with an applicant's FICO score. Small businesses take out loans and cash advances when they believe that the opportunities offered by expanded financial assets will outweigh the costs. Small businesses that don‚Äôt have the cash on hand to fund an expansion by themselves could rely on external funding, such as a merchant cash advance. MCAs are \\"almost entirely unregulated\\" because they are not supposed to be loans. They are not subject to usury laws or banking laws like the Truth in Lending Act.

They could be relied upon to vote in the interest of the railways when legislation aimed at controlling the companies' actions was proposed, and to persuade their fellow members, most of whom will have been railway shareholders, to follow suit. While the monopoly position of railways in inland transport remained unchallenged, the influence of the railway interest in resisting rates' control and safety improvements was a continuing concern both to free-trade liberals and to the aristocracy/landed-gentry with a dependence on farming. The 'interest' was particularly strong as divisions were often not whipped on party lines until the end of the century. 'Railway members' of the House of Commons were listed in some early editions of Bradshaw's Almanack, directory and shareholder's guides from 1847, and both Lords and MPs who were railway directors were listed continuously there from 1858 to 1923. Geoffrey Alderman shows that from 1868 to 1879 the number of MPs holding railway directorships was between 106 and 132 (out of 640 seats) that is, roughly up to a fifth of the house. This fell somewhat in 1880-1891 to 78-108, fell again in the 1890s to 65-79 and later in first decade of the 1900s to 34-50, which effectively saw the end of the interest's influence during the Liberal administration of 1906-1910.Alderman, p.227, pp.229-250 References Sources * Alderman, Geoffrey, The railway interest, Leicester, Leicester University Press, 1973, Category:Rail industry Category:History of rail transport in the United Kingdom Category:Parliament of the United Kingdom Category:19th century in the United Kingdom ","title":"Railway interest"},{"id":"23993847","text":"Ah Cacao Real Chocolate, SA de CV is a Mexican chocolate company based in Playa del Carmen, Quintana Roo, Mexico.

The GSMA represents its members via industry programmes, working groups and industry advocacy initiatives. The present Director General of the GSMA is Mats Granryd.  History  The original GSM MoU document: \\"A Pan-European 900MHz Digital Cellular Mobile Telecommunications Service\\" (dated 7 September 1987) The GSMA was formed in 1995 as the 'GSM MoU Association' as a body to support and promote mobile operators using the GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) standard for cellular networks. It traces its history back to an memorandum of understanding signed in 1987 by 13 operators in 12 countries that committed to deploying GSM for mobile services.  Membership and governance  Full membership of the GSMA is open to licensed mobile operators using a GSM family technology. Approximately 750 such operators around the world are full GSMA members. Associate membership of the GSMA is open to non- operator companies active in the mobile ecosystem. These include handset and device makers, software companies, equipment providers and Internet companies, as well as organisations in industry sectors such as financial services, healthcare, media, transport and utilities. There are approximately 400 GSMA member companies in this category.https://www.gsma.com/membership/ The GSMA board has 25 representatives from the world‚Äôs largest operator groups and selected smaller operators, and is elected bi-annually. St√©phane Richard, CEO of Orange Group, became GSMA Chairman in January 2019, serving a two-year term.https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/home-banner/orange- chief-richard-to-chair-gsma/  Programmes and advocacy  The GSMA manages industry programmes in collaboration with its members with the aim of achieving scale and interoperability for new mobile technologies. It has three active programmes: 'Future Networks' (promoting standards such as Rich Communication Services and Voice over LTE); 'Identity'; and the 'Internet of Things'. It also runs industry working groups covering areas such as roaming and interconnection, fraud and security, and intellectual property, as well as various other specialist committees and groups. The GSMA represents the mobile industry to governments and institutions where it advocates policy and regulatory positions on behalf of its members. Its stated goals in this area is to ensure that mobile telecoms \\"policy and regulatory frameworks are fair, flexible and future-proof\\"; that radio spectrum is made available for mobile services \\"in a timely and fair manner\\"; and to promote the use of mobile services in emerging markets. As part of its Industry Purpose programme, the GSMA is supporting the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals.

It allocates official IMEI number ranges to all manufacturers of 3GPP compliant devices and records these ranges and device model information in a database. It offers a device look up and identification service based on this database that allows authorised third- party organisations to identify the manufacturer and model of a mobile device using the IMEI.

Career Born in Greenock, McWilliams began his career at Greenock Morton. He worked his way through the youth system to the Under-19s and then was called up to the first team. On 15 August 2009, he made his professional debut in a game against Dunfermline Athletic. McWilliams made his debut for Morton on 15 August 2009, against Dunfermline Athletic after Bryn Halliwell was injured in the warm-up. McWilliams was loaned to his old club, Ayrshire junior side, Largs Thistle towards the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season. After being released by Morton, on 30 July 2010, Ryan signed for Ayr United on a 1-year deal as back up to David Crawford. At the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, McWilliams signed a one-year extension with Ayr, but left at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. McWilliams signed a one-year contract with the Second Division outfit Albion Rovers, then immediately after Rovers played against Morton in the Challenge Cup he was loaned out to East Stirlingshire on a 6-month deal, with his first game ironically to be against Morton. He asked to be released from his contract with Rovers in January 2013, after falling to third choice at the club. East Stirlingshire traveled to play Rangers on 18 August 2012, where McWilliams earned the Man of the Match award after several point blank and double saves; these helped keep the score respectable as the Shire lost 5‚Äì1. He was recalled by Albion after an injury to Chris McCluskey. McWilliams also coached the goalkeepers at youth level for Morton. After his release by Albion Rovers, McWilliams returned to first club Largs Thistle. After leaving Largs, he moved to Greenock Juniors. After four seasons with his home club, Ryan signed a one-year deal with South Lanarkshire outfit Lesmahagow Juniors for season 2018‚Äì19. Ryan decided to leave Lesmahagow and signed a deal with Govan-based side Benburb Juniors until the end of season 2018‚Äì2019.

Henan"},{"id":"23993975","text":"Adolf Endler (20 September 1930 - 2 August 2009) was a lyric poet, essayist and prose author who played a central role in subcultural activities that attacked and challenged an outdated model of socialist realism in the German Democratic Republic up until the collapse of communism in the early 1990s. Endler drew attention to himself as the \\"father of the oppositional literary scene\\" at Prenzlauer Berg in the eastern part of Berlin.Goethe-Institut e. V., Online-Redaktion, July 2009 In 2005 he was made a member of the Deutsche Akademie f√ºr Sprache und Dichtung in Darmstadt. Early life and career A communist as a young man, Endler moved to East Germany in 1955 and studied at the Johannes R. Becher Institute of Literature in Leipzig from 1955‚Äì57. An acclaimed poet, he was well respected in the East and West, but at the same time was marginalized and degraded by party functionaries who controlled the fields of cultural practice, conspired to guard their concepts of aesthetics, and went as far as to extend their influence into the writer's private life. Even though socialist realism had spread over most of Eastern European cultural life, it was successfully undermined by writers and artists like Endler. His defiance involved ignoring orders from cultural politicians and finding alternative ways of communicating with peers. In 1978 he coined the term S√§chsische Dichterschule to describe the group of German writers who were born in the 1930s and were influential in the areas of poetry, such as, Karl Mickel, Heinz Czechowski, Sarah Kirsch and Volker Braun. This sentiment is shared by Michael Hamburger, who, before the group had been named, applauded those that they had been creative in an artistically hostile environment. Hamburger recorded the traffic of correspondence between individual poets -a secret project that held the young writers together in a state that promoted the exact opposite, i.e. the isolation of individual deviants. His colleague in exile, the Austrian Erich Fried (Fried and Hamburger went into exile in Great Britain during Hitler's Third Reich), documented some of this writing for the BBC in his review of the anthology In diesem besseren Land (1966).Fractured Memories: Life Writing in Adolf Endler‚Äôs Surrealist Anti- Autobiography Nebbich by Gerrit-Jan Berendse, seminar 45:1 (2009) Into the seventies, Endler remained steadfastly confrontational. Following the expatriation from the GDR of songwriter Wolf Biermann in 1976, Endler was expelled from the Writers‚Äô Association of the GDR in 1979, having declared his solidarity with his previously reprimanded colleague Stefan Heym. Throughout the 1980s he contributed to various Berlin and Leipzig underground magazines. In the 1990s, Adolf Endler became known to a wider public through a volume of memoirs entitled Tarzan am Prenzlauer Berg (i.e. Tarzan at Prenzlauer Berg) and from 1991 to 1998, with Brigitte Schreier-Endler, he organised the legendary ‚ÄúOrplid&Co.;‚Äú readings in Caf√© Clara in Berlin-Mitte. Mr. Endler died after a long illness. Quotations *A lot of people connect liberalization with the fact that the GDR for international reason didn't want to have any trouble. The GDR wanted to be thought of in the international community as something very decent and without blemish. That was something we went along with. Our only means of power was to threaten to make an international fuss. If a book had been published in the west, and then the author had been sent to jail, there would have been a fuss. There must have been five hundred of us who had written letters or who had collected signatures. There weren't three hundred thousand people, but there were always ten or twenty thousand refractory people who as a rule wanted to stay in the GDR, but who, out of some sort of defiance or whatever, weren't ready to put up with it. They weren't the people who had left because they were fed up to the teeth.\\" -March 15th, 1992.Literary intellectuals and the dissolution of the state: Robert Von Hallberg, Kenneth J.

Life His first film experiences were in 1982 in Andy Bausch's short film Stefan. After this, he appeared in all of Bausch's films, generally in the starring role. Soon, he came to other directors' attention: he appeared in films by Paul Kieffer (Schacko Klak), Marc Olinger (De falschen Hond) and Pol Cruchten (Hochz√§itsnuecht). Abracadabra, by Harry Cleven, was his first film in French. In his role as the Belgian \\"Henk\\" in Knockin' on Heaven's Door, a great success in Germany, he became known to the German public. He regularly appeared in German films, TV films and series. For his role in Offside he received the Adolf-Grimme-Preis in 2008. He also often acted in Luxembourgish theatre productions, often directed by Frank Hoffmann. As the singer of the groups Nazz Nazz, Taboola Rasa and Luxus he also had a loyal following. The last film in which he had a starring role was inthierryview, filmed by Andy Bausch as a sort of retrospective portrait and homage in 2008, after it had become known that Van Werveke was very ill.

She has been described as ‚Äòunapologetically conservative‚Äô, and has written Underdog: Confessions of a Right-Wing Gay Jewish Muckraker. Levy placed second in the 2009 Ontario by- election as Progressive Conservative Party candidate for Toronto, St. Paul's. Early life and education Levy grew up in Hamilton, Ontario, the daughter of an accountant. Levy is the niece of the late Jeffrey S. Lyons, a Toronto lawyer and prominent municipal lobbyist who is best known for having been implicated in the MFP scandal at City Hall. She earned a journalism degree from Carleton University in 1978. After graduating from Carleton, Levy worked as an aide to Ontario Progressive Conservative cabinet minister Frank Drea before returning to school to earn an MBA from the University of Toronto in 1985. She then worked in public relations but left in order to enter journalism as a reporter for the Bracebridge Examiner, before being hired by the Toronto Sun in 1989. At the Sun Levy became the Suns City Hall columnist in 1998 and covered the mayoralties of Mel Lastman, David Miller, and Rob Ford before being moving on to Queen's Park. She has since returned to covering city politics under Mayor John Tory. In 2004, the Ryerson Review of Journalism surveyed city councillors and found that Levy was \\"rated lowest among the 18 city hall reporters for accuracy, fairness and knowledge\\". Levy made a reputation as the press gallery‚Äôs \\"most unapologetically conservative chronicler of local politics.\\" She created enemies among some city councillors, whom she goaded with derogatory nicknames. Levy was criticized by the National NewsMedia Council for a ‚Äúserious breach of journalistic standards‚Äù for an October 2018 column --part of a series -- which alleged that immigrants and refugee claimants temporarily residing at the Radisson Hotel Toronto East were slaughtering goats in one of the hotel's public bathrooms. This assertion was based on on-line reviews of the hotel posted to TripAdvisor and Expedia, and interviews with clients who posted their reviews on Trip Advisor. Levy's columns were widely circulated online by alt-right commenters on 4chan and Reddit, as well as sites such as Infowars. Two days later, an unknown person engaged in an act of arson but police later confirmed the fire had nothing to do with any media coverage. Levy is the author of the book Underdog: Confessions of a Right-Wing Gay Jewish Muckraker (2016) and also appeared as a regular guest on The John Oakley Show on Talk 640 until 2018. She was previously a panelist on CBC Radio One's local Toronto afternoon drive show Here and Now, as well as an occasional commentator or panelist over various cable news channels. Politics In 2009, Levy was the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario's by-election candidate in the Toronto riding of St. Paul's, placing second with 28.33% of the vote behind the Liberal victor, Eric Hoskins. Personal life Levy is Jewish and an openly gay conservative. She came out publicly in 2007 and married her wife Denise Alexander in 2009.

Although relatively unknown in modern Tibet, there are several ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama Mantra texts in the Tibetan Buddhist canon. It is associated with Chinese Esoteric Buddhism and Shingon Buddhism. The Mantra was, according to the opening chapter of the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra,≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra Translation Committee of the Buddhist Text Translation Society, 2009, p. xviii. historically transmitted by Gautama Buddha to Manjushri to protect Ananda before he had become an arhat. It was again spoken by the Buddha before an assembly of monastic and lay adherents. ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra Translation Committee of the Buddhist Text Translation Society, 2009, p. xviii. Like the popular six-syllable mantra \\"om mani padme hum\\" and the Nƒ´laka·πá·π≠ha DhƒÅra·πáƒ´, the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama mantra is synonymous with practices of Avalokite≈õvara, an important bodhisattva in both East Asian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism. The ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama Mantra also extensively references Buddhist deities such as the bodhisattvas Manjushri, MahƒÅkƒÅla, Sitatapatra Vajrapani and the Five Tathagatas, especially Bhaisajyaguru. It is often used for protection or purification for meditators and is considered to be part of Shingon Buddhism in Japan. Within the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra , the Sanskrit incantation (variously referred to as dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ or mantra) contained therein, is known as the SitƒÅtapatro·π£·πáƒ´·π£a dhƒÅra·πáƒ´, The \\"≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama mantra\\" () is well-known and popularly chanted in East Asian Buddhism, where it is very much related to the practice of the \\"White Parasol DhƒÅra·πáƒ´\\" (). In Tibetan Buddhism, it is the \\"White Umbrella\\" ().. History of the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama Mantra transmission and translations In 168-179 CE, the Gandharan monk Lokak·π£ema arrives in Han China and translates the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra into Classical Chinese. The currently popular version of the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra and ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama mantra were translated and transliterated from Sanskrit to Chinese characters during the Tang dynasty by the monk Paramiti from North India and reviewed by Meghashikara from Oddiyana after Empress Regnant Wu Zetian retired in the year 705. The ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama mantra was promoted and popularised by the Chan monk Hsuan Hua in North America and the Sinophone world, who valued it as fundamental to Buddhism's existence.

Services also passed through this station before joining the North Wales and Liverpool Railway. Located west of the A550 near RAF Sealand, the station was just before a triangular junction at Dee marshes which controlled rail services from North Wales, Liverpool and Cheshire. History The station was opened on 17 June 1918 by the Great Central Railway for WWI military personnel based at Sealand Camp. The station, which was originally called Welsh Road Halt, had two adjacent side platforms. It was renamed Sealand in September 1931. From this station, services from North Wales could either terminate at Chester Northgate Station, the Chester terminus of the Cheshire Lines Committee, or continue on the through line to Manchester Central. Services to and from Liverpool via Bidston used the Grand Central line until joining the Chester & Connah's Quay railway at Dee Marsh junction. Passenger services ceased on 9 September 1968 when the station was completely closed. The 20-lever signal box continued being used until 14 September 1981.

Mildred Hubble Mildred Hubble is the titular character of The Worst Witch series. Unlike the other girls at Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches, she doesn't come from a regular witch family, but was given a scholarship which greatly impressed Miss Cackle. She is best friends with Maud Spellbody and Enid Nightshade. In The Worst Witch, although inadvertently ruining a broomstick display while she was lead, she was given a sabotaged broomstick, she saves the whole academy from Miss Cackle's jealous and evil identical twin sister Agatha Cackle, who was seeking to turn all the teachers and pupils into frogs. In the nick of time, Mildred turns Agatha and the rest of her fiendish coven into snails. In The Worst Witch Strikes Again Miss Cackle trusts her to look after the new girl, Enid Nightshade, much to the chagrin of both Maud and Miss Hardbroom. In A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch Mildred is turned into a frog by Ethel Hallow where she discovers a frog-magician Algernon Rowan-Webb and manages to have him turned back into a human. In The Worst Witch All at Sea she sneakily brings Tabby, her bumbling tabby cat along to Grim Cove with her, instead of her new, ordinary black cat Ebony. In The Worst Witch Saves the Day she once again saves the academy from the ruthless Agatha Cackle (who sneaked into the school disguised as a new teacher Miss Granite, with a high-pitched, squeaky voice, a huge cloud of orange curls, and an extremely bizarre personality) who tried to turn the whole academy into snails. In The Worst Witch to the Rescue her project is stolen by the ruthless Ethel Hallow who also gets her banned from art lessons with Miss Mould after Ethel turned her clay pot into five rattlesnakes. In the same book, Mildred also pulls off a daring rescue of rescuing her talking pet tortoise from a tall pine tree after Drusilla Paddock hid him there under Ethel's orders, and is granted permission to keep the tortoise once he returns to normal. In The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star, as she starts fourth year, Mildred is promoted to Lantern Monitor of the school. When she makes an idle wish on a shooting star, she finds herself with an unexpected new pet in the form of a dog, Star, who displays a surprising aptitude for doing tricks on the broomstick. Although there is some objection to Star's presence, after he and Mildred help Cackle's win a competition among three different schools to earn money for a new swimming-pool (albeit after Star accidentally ruined their original plans for a broomstick ballet display), Mildred is granted special permission for Star to be her broomstick companion instead of Tabby. Despite being clumsy and bumbling, Mildred's intentions are good and she is well-meaning, despite almost getting expelled in The Worst Witch Strikes Again. Although she has trouble training her cat, Tabby- who is grey with black stripes rather than the required black as they 'ran out of black ones' when handing out cats-, Mildred is nevertheless very fond of him, enjoying cuddling up to him in bed, and even risking expulsion to take him with her on holiday after she is forced to give him up in The Worst Witch All at Sea, and is upset when they suggest that her new dog Star replace Tabby as her broomstick companion until Miss Cackle clarifies that they intend for Tabby to remain as her general pet. She also has three bats in her room, which she has named Winky, Blinky, and Nod in the series; by the fourth book in the series, the number of bats has grown to eight. Mildred is tall and thin and has long, waist-length, black hair which she wears in two messy pigtails, whereas in The Worst Witch Saves the Day, Mildred has what Miss Hardbroom calls \\"a bad hair day\\", after borrowing Maud's styling brush and getting her hair tangled in it. Ethel chops off the styling brush but then cuts off all of Mildred's hair to hide it. In a false attempt at kindness, Ethel gave Mildred a hair-growth potion which, unfortunately, makes Mildred's hair grow so long and so fast that it practically engulfs the whole school. In the original 1998 TV series, Mildred was portrayed by Georgina Sherrington. In the 2017 remake, Mildred is portrayed by Bella Ramsey (although in the episode \\"The Best Teacher\\", Mildred is portrayed by Rachel Bell when she is temporarily aged into an older woman by what was meant to be a wisdom spell) and Lydia Page in Season four, after Ramsey left the series. Both TV adaptations establish that Mildred is the 'worst witch' because she is the first student at Cackle's to originate from a non-magical background; the 1998 version has her receive a scholarship for an imaginative piece of creative writing and the 2017 version has her learn about Cackle's and magic because she helped Maud get to the school on her first day after Maud crashed into her balcony. It is revealed in the season two finale of the 2017 series that actually Mildred's ancestors were magic, but her great-grandmother thirteen generations back sacrificed twelve generations of magic to reignite a founding stone. In Season four, after a sabotage by Ethel, who had substituted an appearance-spell to prevent Mildred from applying for head girl, during her potion experiment, which causes Mildred with a whole new look: a redhead with blue eyes. Mildred tried to complete three impossible challenges and reverse the spell before the sun goes down. Mildred becomes stuck in her new look, when she fails to complete the last impossible challenge. Mildred is becoming powerful, since she and Maud correctly perform the Transference Spell in sync. She later meets her father Spike Jones and her younger half-sister Isabella \\"Izzy\\" Jones, after Mildred saves Izzy on her first day of school during a flying accident involving her broom. At the end of Season four, she becomes the new head girl after saving the school from Agatha Cackle and she make peace with Ethel. Maud Spellbody Maud Spellbody is first introduced as Mildred's best friend. She breaks off her friendship with Mildred in The Worst Witch Strikes Again after growing jealous of Mildred's apparent friendship with the new girl, Enid Nightshade. She later reverts her friendship to Mildred after Ethel locks them in a store cupboard and makes friends with Enid. She is short and chubby with glasses and hair is worn in bunches (in A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch she wore pigtails and in The Worst Witch Saves the Day she has curly bunches instead of straight ones). She is fiercely loyal to Mildred and Enid and has stood up to Ethel many times, most notably in The Worst Witch All at Sea where she reprimands Ethel about eavesdropping on a conversation between her and Enid about Mildred acting strangely. There is also some inconsistency regarding Maud's surname. The 1998 TV series gave her surname as \\"Moonshine\\", but it is never referred to as this in the books; in fact Miss Hardbroom scathingly addresses her as Maud \\"Spellbody\\" in The Worst Witch All at Sea. The 1980s Halloween television movie gave her surname as \\"Warlock\\". Later books, including Fun with the Worst Witch (2014) gave her surname as 'Spellbody' however. In The Worst Witch (TV series) Maud was played by Emma Brown. Her chubbiness is dropped but her small stature, bunches, glasses, and loyalty towards her friends remain intact. She has also sprung to Mildred's defense several times, such as in the episode \\"Learning the Hard Way\\" where she comments to Miss Hardbroom that Mildred would never have any confidence if she kept shouting at her. It was the 2017 TV series that popularized Maud's surname as the most commonly known Spellbody. Maud was played by Danielle Bachelor in the 80's Halloween movie. In the 2017 CBBC version of The Worst Witch, Megan Hughes plays Maud in Series 2. In the first series of the CBBC version she is played by Meibh Campbell.  Enid Nightshade  Enid Nightshade is Mildred's second-best friend who is introduced in The Worst Witch Strikes Again where she has hair \\"the colour of milky tea\\" wearing it in a thick plait and having large limbs. Mildred is assigned to look after her by Miss Cackle. Enid at first appears to be dull and boring but turns out to be a wild practical joker/prankster who is more likely to get the three into trouble than Mildred is. She unintentionally causes trouble for Mildred throughout the novel, even to the point where Miss Cackle threatens to expel Mildred if there is any more bother from her. Nevertheless, Enid is just as loyal as Maud is and provides comfort and support to Mildred in the following books of the series. Enid is the second-worst witch in the Academy, as both she and Mildred are hapless at broomstick riding and lack the specific requirements to be a fully-fledged, efficient witch. In the TV series, Enid was portrayed by Jessica Fox. In the new BBC reboot, Enid was portrayed by newcomer Tamara Smart.https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/worst-witch-casting  Ethel Hallow  Ethel Hallow is the snobbish, stuck-up, vindictive, and sly rival and enemy of Mildred and her friends. She is favoured by Miss Hardbroom, but appears to have no friends, apart from the rarely seen Drusilla Paddock, who is just as bad as Ethel. Ethel is described as being \\"one of those lucky people for whom everything goes right\\" which is what caused her to become so snobby. Ethel is tall and thin (just like Mildred) and has blonde hair which she wears in a ponytail with a black hair ribbon. She also has a very spiky nose (pointed out by Maud in A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch). Various commentaries have noted that Ethel's primary weakness as a student is that, which she is able to easily follow the rules and perform new spells after the demonstration, she lacks the ability to imagine and improvise when given free rein. This was demonstrated most clearly in The Worst Witch to the Rescue, when she was the student who performed worst in the art class and had no ideas whatsoever for a summer project to research a spell of the student's choice as she lacked a framework for her to start studying in, in contrast to Mildred who not only performed best in art but had even created a completely new spell for the project.  Ethel Hallow in the books  * In The Worst Witch, Ethel is turned into a pig by Mildred Hubble after persistently taunting her about her tabby cat's inability to fly properly on a broomstick. In revenge, Ethel jinxes the spare broom she lends Mildred, ruining Mildred's broomstick performance in front of Grand Wizard Egbert Hellibore. * In The Worst Witch Strikes Again, she locks Mildred and Enid in an abandoned store cupboard. * In A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch, she turns Mildred into a frog to get even with her for calling her younger sister Sybil Hallow a \\"weed\\". * In The Worst Witch All at Sea, she casts off a boat containing Tabby and an unconscious Miss Hardbroom from the breakwater, thus nearly causing them to be lost at sea. * In The Worst Witch Saves the Day. she shears all of Mildred's hair off then gives her a hair regrowth potion that causes Mildred's hair to grow out- of-control, and she also hides Tabby on the roof. * Ethel's most villainous role is in The Worst Witch to the Rescue, in which she gets Mildred banned from art lessons by turning her clay pot into five rattlesnakes out of jealousy that Mildred was doing better than her, and steals Mildred's summer project of a spell that can allow animals to talk for two weeks, passing it off as her own, filling Mildred's project folder with sheets of paper with smiley faces scrawled on. She also gets Drusilla to hide Mildred's talking pet tortoise up a tree to prevent him from revealing the truth about the project, but this backfires on her when Mildred saves the tortoise and presents him to Miss Cackle and Miss Hardbroom as a witness. * In The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star, Ethel has been promoted to Lantern Monitor in fourth year, along with Mildred and Drusilla, but it is noted that she is on a tight leash after her previous actions. Realising that Mildred has something hidden in a bag, Ethel is able to expose Mildred's new pet dog, Star, but the subsequent scuffle causes destroys the costumes that would have been used for Form Five's broomstick ballet. Because of her nasty ways, Ethel is sometimes seen as a bully. Yet her actions are instrumental in setting up the climax of nearly every novel. In The Worst Witch the jinx she puts on the broomstick results in Mildred running away into the woods rather than face Miss Cackle. If Mildred hadn't run away she wouldn't have spotted Agatha Cackle and her coven. In The Worst Witch Strikes Again, if she hadn't locked Mildred and Enid in the store cupboard they would never have flown into the Great Hall to do a performance and improve Maud's speech. In A Bad Spell for the Worst Witch, if Ethel hadn't turned Mildred into a frog, Mildred wouldn't have discovered Algernon Rowan- Webb and he would have remained a frog for the rest of his life. In The Worst Witch All at Sea, if she hadn't set the boat adrift, the legendary treasure chest on Cat's Head Rock wouldn't have been discovered. In The Worst Witch Saves the Day, if Ethel hadn't left Tabby on the roof then Miss Granite wouldn't have picked him up and Mildred wouldn't have found out Miss Granite was actually Agatha Cackle in disguise. While she is a straightforward bully in The Worst Witch to the Rescue, where the main threat is Ethel stealing Mildred's summer project to pass off as her own, Ethel returns to her traditional role of unwittingly provoking success in The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star, where her attempts to expose Mildred's new dog Star result in Mildred being granted permission to use Star as her broom companion rather than Tabby after she and Star win an inter-school competition.  Ethel Hallow in the TV series  In the 1998 ITV series, Ethel is played by Felicity Jones in the first series and Katy Allen in the second and third series. Jones later reprised her role in Weirdsister College. The excuse for the change of actress, as explained in the first episode of the second series \\"Old Hats and New Brooms\\", was Ethel having a makeover (or a \\"witch-over\\" in their case) during the holidays. In the 2017 CBBC series, Ethel is portrayed by newcomer Jenny Richardson.https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/worst-witch- casting This version of Ethel is still intelligent, but is particularly driven to 'prove' herself as her elder sister Esmerelda is a third-year at Cackle's who is generally seen as the school's best student. Her vendetta against Mildred begins in the selection day tests, when Ethel's attempt to prove herself by creating a potion that would turn her into a dragon is inadvertently sabotaged by Mildred; Mildred 'stole' part of a key ingredient from Ethel's potion because she needed it for her own levitation spell, with the result that Ethel's spell turned her instead into a worm. As the series continues, Ethel attempts to undermine Mildred and affirm her own place in the school, but her own nature often works against her as her attempts at 'heroism' typically involve making others look bad rather than putting herself at risk, such as stealing the school's Founding Stone to try and restore Esmerelda's magic after she was the reason her sister lost her powers in the first place, or creating a duplicate of Indigo Moon- another student from a non-witching background- that would attack the school so that Ethel could defeat the duplicate, unable to recognise the difference between building herself up and genuinely helping others.  Miss Hardbroom  Miss Joy Hecate Hardbroom is the terrifying and extremely strict form-mistress of Mildred, Maud, Enid, Ethel, and Drusilla. She is tall, thin and bony with waist-length black hair which she keeps \\"scragged into such a tight knot that her forehead looked quite stretched\\". Miss Hardbroom favours Ethel Hallow but has the complete opposite attitude to Mildred Hubble. Miss Hardbroom is even terrifying enough to reduce any pupil to a gibbering heap with one word. Despite seeming cruel, Miss Hardbroom's soft side does come through on occasions, such as her \\"brief flicker of friendliness\\" at the end of The Worst Witch Saves the Day and her admitting her error of judgement in The Worst Witch to the Rescue after it is revealed that Ethel stole Mildred's summer project for herself, Maud noting in The Worst Witch and the Wishing Star that Miss Hardbroom's dislike of cheats means that Ethel will be under close watch. In the books and earlier TV series, Miss Hardbroom‚Äôs first name is Constance. In the 1986 film Miss Hardbroom is portrayed by Diana Rigg. In the 1998 TV series she is portrayed by Kate Duch√™ne, and in The New Worst Witch by Caroline O'Neill. In the 2017 CBBC series she is called Miss Hecate Hardbroom and played by Raquel Cassidy.

It may also describe other motions such as precession or nutation of an object's rotational axis. Prograde or direct motion is more normal motion in the same direction as the primary rotates. However, \\"retrograde\\" and \\"prograde\\" can also refer to an object other than the primary if so described. The direction of rotation is determined by an inertial frame of reference, such as distant fixed stars. In the Solar System, the orbits about the Sun of all planets and most other objects, except many comets, are prograde, i.e. in the same direction as the Sun rotates. Except for Venus and Uranus, planetary rotations are also prograde. Most natural satellites have prograde orbits about their planets. Prograde satellites of Uranus orbit in the direction Uranus rotates, which is retrograde to the Sun. Nearly all regular satellites are tidally locked and thus have prograde rotation. Retrograde satellites are generally small and distant from their planets, except Neptune's satellite Triton, which is large and close. All retrograde satellites are thought to have formed separately before being captured by their planets. Most low-inclination artificial satellites of Earth have been placed in a prograde orbit, because in this situation less propellant is required to reach orbit when launching in a prograde direction.  Formation of celestial systems  When a galaxy or a planetary system forms, its material takes the shape of a disk. Most of the material orbits and rotates in one direction. This uniformity of motion is due to the collapse of a gas cloud. The nature of the collapse is explained by conservation of angular momentum. In 2010 the discovery of several hot Jupiters with backward orbits called into question the theories about the formation of planetary systems. This can be explained by noting that stars and their planets do not form in isolation but in star clusters that contain molecular clouds. When a protoplanetary disk collides with or steals material from a cloud this can result in retrograde motion of a disk and the resulting planets.Ingo Thies, Pavel Kroupa, Simon P. Goodwin, Dimitris Stamatellos, Anthony P. Whitworth, \\"A natural formation scenario for misaligned and short- period eccentric extrasolar planets\\", 11 July 2011  Orbital and rotational parameters   Orbital inclination  A celestial object's inclination indicates whether the object's orbit is prograde or retrograde. The inclination of a celestial object is the angle between its orbital plane and another reference frame such as the equatorial plane of the object's primary. In the Solar System, inclination of the planets is measured from the ecliptic plane, which is the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. The inclination of moons is measured from the equator of the planet they orbit. An object with an inclination between 0 and 90 degrees is orbiting or revolving in the same direction as the primary is rotating. An object with an inclination of exactly 90 degrees has a perpendicular orbit that is neither prograde nor retrograde. An object with an inclination between 90 degrees and 180 degrees is in a retrograde orbit.  Axial tilt  A celestial object's axial tilt indicates whether the object's rotation is prograde or retrograde. Axial tilt is the angle between an object's rotation axis and a line perpendicular to its orbital plane passing through the object's centre. An object with an axial tilt up to 90 degrees is rotating in the same direction as its primary. An object with an axial tilt of exactly 90 degrees has a perpendicular rotation that is neither prograde nor retrograde. An object with an axial tilt between 90 degrees and 180 degrees is rotating in the opposite direction to its orbital direction. Regardless of inclination or axial tilt, the north pole of any planet or moon in the Solar System is defined as the pole that is in the same celestial hemisphere as Earth's north pole. Solar System bodies Planets All eight planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in the direction of the Sun's rotation, which is counterclockwise when viewed from above the Sun's north pole. Six of the planets also rotate about their axis in this same direction. The exceptions ‚Äì the planets with retrograde rotation ‚Äì are Venus and Uranus. Venus's axial tilt is 177¬∞, which means it is rotating almost exactly in the opposite direction to its orbit. Uranus has an axial tilt of 97.77¬∞, so its axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the plane of the Solar System. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized protoplanet collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation. It is unlikely that Venus was formed with its present slow retrograde rotation, which takes 243 days. Venus probably began with a fast prograde rotation with a period of several hours much like most of the planets in the Solar System. Venus is close enough to the Sun to experience significant gravitational tidal dissipation, and also has a thick enough atmosphere to create thermally driven atmospheric tides that create a retrograde torque. Venus' present slow retrograde rotation is in equilibrium balance between gravitational tides trying to tidally lock Venus to the Sun and atmospheric tides trying to spin Venus in a retrograde direction. In addition to maintaining this present day equilibrium, tides are also sufficient to account for evolution of Venus's rotation from a primordial fast prograde direction to its present-day slow retrograde rotation. In the past, various alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain Venus' retrograde rotation, such as collisions or it having originally formed that way. Despite being closer to the Sun than Venus, Mercury is not tidally locked because it has entered a 3:2 spin‚Äìorbit resonance due to the eccentricity of its orbit. Mercury's prograde rotation is slow enough that due to its eccentricity, its angular orbital velocity exceeds its angular rotational velocity near perihelion, causing the motion of the sun in Mercury's sky to temporarily reverse. The rotations of Earth and Mars are also affected by tidal forces with the Sun, but they have not reached an equilibrium state like Mercury and Venus because they are further out from the Sun where tidal forces are weaker. The gas giants of the Solar System are too massive and too far from the Sun for tidal forces to slow down their rotations.  Dwarf planets  All known dwarf planets and dwarf planet candidates have prograde orbits around the Sun, but some have retrograde rotation. Pluto has retrograde rotation; its axial tilt is approximately 120 degrees. Pluto and its moon Charon are both tidally locked to each other. It is suspected that the Plutonian satellite system was created by a massive collision.  Natural satellites and rings  The orange moon is in a retrograde orbit. If formed in the gravity field of a planet as the planet is forming, a moon will orbit the planet in the same direction as the planet is rotating and is a regular moon. If an object is formed elsewhere and later captured into orbit by a planet's gravity, it can be captured into either a retrograde or prograde orbit depending on whether it first approaches the side of the planet that is rotating towards or away from it. This is an irregular moon. In the Solar System, many of the asteroid-sized moons have retrograde orbits, whereas all the large moons except Triton (the largest of Neptune's moons) have prograde orbits. The particles in Saturn's Phoebe ring are thought to have a retrograde orbit because they originate from the irregular moon Phoebe. All retrograde satellites experience tidal deceleration to some degree. The only satellite in the Solar System for which this effect is non-negligible is Neptune's moon Triton. All the other retrograde satellites are on distant orbits and tidal forces between them and the planet are negligible. Within the Hill sphere, the region of stability for retrograde orbits at a large distance from the primary is larger than that for prograde orbits. This has been suggested as an explanation for the preponderance of retrograde moons around Jupiter. Because Saturn has a more even mix of retrograde/prograde moons, however, the underlying causes appear to be more complex. With the exception of Hyperion all the known regular planetary natural satellites in the Solar System are tidally locked to their host planet, so they have zero rotation relative to their host planet, but have the same type of rotation relative to the Sun as their host planet, because they have prograde orbits around their host planet. That is to say, they all have prograde rotation relative to the Sun except those of Uranus. If there is a collision, material could be ejected in any direction and coalesce into either prograde or retrograde moons, which may be the case for the moons of dwarf planet Haumea, although Haumea's rotation direction is not known.Matija ƒÜuk, Darin Ragozzine, David Nesvorn√Ω, \\"On the Dynamics and Origin of Haumea's Moons\\", 12 August 2013  Asteroids  Asteroids usually have a prograde orbit around the Sun. Only a few dozen asteroids in retrograde orbits are known. Some asteroids with retrograde orbits may be burnt-out comets, but some may acquire their retrograde orbit due to gravitational interactions with Jupiter.S. Greenstreet, B. Gladman, H. Ngo, M. Granvik, and S. Larson, \\"Production of Near-earth Asteroids on Retrograde Orbits\\", The Astrophysical Journal Letters, 749:L39 (5pp), 2012 April 20 Due to their small size and their large distance from Earth it is difficult to telescopically analyse the rotation of most asteroids. As of 2012, data is available for less than 200 asteroids and the different methods of determining the orientation of poles often result in large discrepancies. The asteroid spin vector catalog at Poznan Observatory avoids use of the phrases \\"retrograde rotation\\" or \\"prograde rotation\\" as it depends which reference plane is meant and asteroid coordinates are usually given with respect to the ecliptic plane rather than the asteroid's orbital plane.Documentation for Asteroid Spin Vector Determinations Asteroids with satellites, also known as binary asteroids, make up about 15% of all asteroids less than 10 km in diameter in the main belt and near-Earth population and most are thought to be formed by the YORP effect causing an asteroid to spin so fast that it breaks up.Kevin J. Walsh, Derek C. Richardson & Patrick Michel, \\"Rotational breakup as the origin of small binary asteroids\\", Nature, Vol. 454, 10 July 2008 As of 2012, and where the rotation is known, all satellites of asteroids orbit the asteroid in the same direction as the asteroid is rotating.N. M. Gaftonyuk, N. N. Gorkavyi, \\"Asteroids with satellites: Analysis of observational data\\", Solar System Research, May 2013, Volume 47, Issue 3, pp. 196‚Äì202 Most known objects that are in orbital resonance are orbiting in the same direction as the objects they are in resonance with, however a few retrograde asteroids have been found in resonance with Jupiter and Saturn.  Comets  Comets from the Oort cloud are much more likely than asteroids to be retrograde. Halley's Comet has a retrograde orbit around the Sun.  Kuiper belt objects Most Kuiper belt objects have prograde orbits around the Sun. The first Kuiper belt object discovered to have a retrograde orbit was . Other Kuiper belt objects with retrograde orbits are (471325) 2011 KT19, , and 2011 MM4. All of these orbits are highly tilted, with inclinations in the 100¬∞‚Äì125¬∞ range.  Meteoroids  Meteoroids in a retrograde orbit around the Sun hit the Earth with a faster relative speed than prograde meteoroids and tend to burn up in the atmosphere and are more likely to hit the side of the Earth facing away from the Sun (i.e. at night) whereas the prograde meteoroids have slower closing speeds and more often land as meteorites and tend to hit the Sun-facing side of the Earth. Most meteoroids are prograde.A  Orbital motion of the Sun  The Sun's motion about the centre of mass of the Solar System is complicated by perturbations from the planets. Every few hundred years this motion switches between prograde and retrograde.  Planetary atmospheres  Retrograde motion, or retrogression, within the Earth's atmosphere is seen in weather systems whose motion is opposite the general regional direction of airflow, i.e. from east to west against the westerlies or from west to east through the trade wind easterlies. Prograde motion with respect to planetary rotation is seen in the atmospheric super-rotation of the thermosphere of Earth and in the upper troposphere of Venus. Simulations indicate that the atmosphere of Pluto should be dominated by winds retrograde to its rotation.  Artificial satellites  Artificial satellites destined for low inclination orbits are usually launched in the prograde direction, since this minimizes the amount of propellant required to reach orbit by taking advantage of the Earth's rotation (an equatorial launch site is optimal for this effect). However, Israeli Ofeq satellites are launched in a westward, retrograde direction over the Mediterranean to ensure that launch debris does not fall onto populated land areas.  Exoplanets  Stars and planetary systems tend to be born in star clusters rather than forming in isolation. Protoplanetary disks can collide with or steal material from molecular clouds within the cluster and this can lead to disks and their resulting planets having inclined or retrograde orbits around their stars. Retrograde motion may also result from gravitational interactions with other celestial bodies in the same system (See Kozai mechanism) or a near-collision with another planet, or it may be that the star itself flipped over early in their system's formation due to interactions between the star's magnetic field and the planet-forming disk.\\"Tilting stars may explain backwards planets\\", New Scientist, 1 September 2010, Issue 2776.Dong Lai, Francois Foucart, Douglas N. C. Lin, \\"Evolution of Spin Direction of Accreting Magnetic Protostars and Spin-Orbit Misalignment in Exoplanetary Systems\\" The accretion disk of the protostar IRAS 16293-2422 has parts rotating in opposite directions. This is the first known example of a counterrotating accretion disk. If this system forms planets, the inner planets will likely orbit in the opposite direction to the outer planets.\\"Still-Forming Solar System May Have Planets Orbiting Star in Opposite Directions, Astronomers Say\\", National Radio Astronomy Observatory, February 13, 2006 WASP-17b was the first exoplanet that was discovered to be orbiting its star opposite to the direction the star is rotating. A second such planet was announced just a day later: HAT-P-7b.\\"Second backwards planet found, a day after the first\\", New Scientist, 13 August 2009 In one study more than half of all the known hot Jupiters had orbits that were misaligned with the rotation axis of their parent stars, with six having backwards orbits. The last few giant impacts during planetary formation tend to be the main determiner of a terrestrial planet's rotation rate. During the giant impact stage, the thickness of a protoplanetary disk is far larger than the size of planetary embryos so collisions are equally likely to come from any direction in three dimensions. This results in the axial tilt of accreted planets ranging from 0 to 180 degrees with any direction as likely as any other with both prograde and retrograde spins equally probable. Therefore, prograde spin with small axial tilt, common for the solar system's terrestrial planets except for Venus, is not common for terrestrial planets in general.Sean N. Raymond, Eiichiro Kokubo, Alessandro Morbidelli, Ryuji Morishima, Kevin J. Walsh, \\"Terrestrial Planet Formation at Home and Abroad\\", Submitted on 5 Dec 2013 (v1), last revised 28 Jan 2014 (this version, v3)  Stars' galactic orbits  The pattern of stars appears fixed in the sky, insofar as human vision is concerned; this is because their massive distances relative to the Earth result in motion imperceptible to the naked eye. In reality, stars orbit the center of their galaxy. Stars with an orbit retrograde relative to a disk galaxy's general rotation are more likely to be found in the galactic halo than in the galactic disk. The Milky Way's outer halo has many globular clusters with a retrograde orbit and with a retrograde or zero rotation. The structure of the halo is the topic of an ongoing debate. Several studies have claimed to find a halo consisting of two distinct components. These studies find a \\"dual\\" halo, with an inner, more metal-rich, prograde component (i.e. stars orbit the galaxy on average with the disk rotation), and a metal-poor, outer, retrograde (rotating against the disc) component. However, these findings have been challenged by other studies, arguing against such a duality. These studies demonstrate that the observational data can be explained without a duality, when employing an improved statistical analysis and accounting for measurement uncertainties. The nearby Kapteyn's Star is thought to have ended up with its high-velocity retrograde orbit around the galaxy as a result of being ripped from a dwarf galaxy that merged with the Milky Way.  Galaxies   Satellite galaxies  Close-flybys and mergers of galaxies within galaxy clusters can pull material out of galaxies and create small satellite galaxies in either prograde or retrograde orbits around larger galaxies.M. S. Pawlowski, P. Kroupa, and K. S. de Boer, \\"Making Counter-Orbiting Tidal Debris ‚Äì The Origin of the Milky Way Disc of Satellites\\" A galaxy called Complex H, which was orbiting the Milky Way in a retrograde direction relative to the Milky Way's rotation, is colliding with the Milky Way.  Counter-rotating bulges  NGC 7331 is an example of a galaxy that has a bulge that is rotating in the opposite direction to the rest of the disk, probably as a result of infalling material.  Central black holes  The center of a spiral galaxy contains at least one supermassive black hole. A retrograde black hole ‚Äì one whose spin is opposite to that of its disk ‚Äì spews jets much more powerful than those of a prograde black hole, which may have no jet at all. Scientists have produced a theoretical framework for the formation and evolution of retrograde black holes based on the gap between the inner edge of an accretion disk and the black hole.

The film began filming in Caldicot, Monmouthshire, Wales in 2002, and was released in the U.S. on 12 November 2005, with a DVD release on 7 March 2006. Plot Boris Plots is director of Plots Funeral Home in the fictional Welsh village of Wrottin Powys. His rival Frank Featherbed, an American, is determined to revolutionise the undertaking business in Britain through the innovation of \\"themed funerals\\". Boris Plots dreamed of only two things as a young boy: dancing and Betty Rhys-Jones. Betty secretly loved Boris, but could not fight her father's wishes, so she was married off to a gold digger. Boris gave up his dreams and took over the family's undertaking business. When Betty's mother-in-law dies, Boris and Betty are thrust together again and as they discuss the funeral arrangements for Betty's mother-in-law, the old spark is rekindled. Boris discovers that the only obstacle between their love for one another is her marriage to the adulterous Councilor Hugh Rhys-Jones.

It was released in 2010 for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. The story is based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's novel of the same name, and is set in the ruins of Moscow following a nuclear war, where the survivors are forced to live in underground Metro tunnels. Players control Artyom, a man who must save his home station from the dangers lurking within the Metro. Metro 2033 is played from a first-person perspective. Players encounter human and mutant enemies, who can be killed with a variety of firearms; alternatively, players can employ stealth to evade or silently kill enemies. Ammunition and other necessary items must be either scavenged from the bodies of dead enemies, or purchased from vendors. Some areas of the metro tunnels, in addition to the Earth's surface, are covered in fallout radiation, and the player must wear a gas mask to explore these areas. If the gas mask is worn while in combat, it may be damaged, and the player must quickly find a replacement before they die. Metro 2033 received positive reviews from critics. The game was praised for its horror elements, detailed environments and appealing plot, but it was criticized for its buggy artificial intelligence and its many graphical issues. A sequel, Metro: Last Light, was released in 2013. A compilation of both titles was released in 2014 as Metro Redux for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, OS X, Linux, and SteamOS. A second sequel, Metro Exodus, was released in 2019. In addition, Metro 2033 Redux was released as a standalone game for the Nintendo Switch in February 2020 and on Stadia in June 2020, alongside ports of Metro: Last Light Redux. Gameplay A gameplay screenshot of Metro 2033. The tunnels are often dimly lit, and the player must use a flashlight to see in the darkness Metro 2033 is a first-person shooter video game. It is predominantly set within the tunnels of the Moscow Metro and Metro-2 system, though some sections take place on the surface, in the ruins of Moscow. The story is told through a linear single-player campaign, and important plot moments are shown during cutscenes. The human and mutant enemies can be killed with a variety of firearms. The game features traditional guns like a revolver, assault rifles and shotguns, as well as more inventive weapons like a pneumatic crossbow. In firefights, human enemies take cover and flank the player, while mutant enemies stay in the open and try to bite them. Alternatively, the player can employ stealth to evade their enemies or kill them silently. This can be achieved by using a throwing knife to kill an enemy from afar, or shoot an enemy with a suppressed weapon. If the player is shot or bitten while in combat, they can either wait for their health to recharge, or use a med-kit to heal themselves immediately. The player often has little ammunition, and must scavenge for bullets and other useful items from the bodies of dead enemies or from caches. Pre-war 5.45√ó39mm ammunition (referred to in the game as \\"military grade ammunition\\") can also be found, which serves as the currency within the tunnels. The player can either spend military grade ammunition on new weapons, or use it in firefights, which inflicts more damage on enemies than normal bullets. As most of the tunnels feature little to no light, the player can use a flashlight to explore dark areas. In addition to the dimly lit tunnels, some areas, including the entire surface, are covered in radiation, and require the use of a gas mask. If the player engages in combat while wearing a gas mask, it may become damaged and crack, forcing the player to find a functional gas mask. Throughout the game, there are certain moral choices that can be made. If the player is compassionate to the people living in the tunnels, such as giving the homeless some military grade ammunition, they may be able to watch a different cutscene at the end of the game. These moral choices are never explicitly mentioned, and it is possible to play through the game without knowing of their presence. Plot This game is based on Dmitry Glukhovsky's book Metro 2033. In 2013, nuclear war had devastated the Earth, wiping out billions of lives. Among the affected nations is Russia, including the now-desolate wasteland of Moscow. A handful of survivors manage to hide in the Metro system, salvaging spare parts and growing mushrooms for food. Animals such as rats, bears, and others are mutated into horrific monsters, while the air in many areas that humans breathe becomes heavily irradiated and impossible to survive in without a gas mask. While there is a constant state of war between the Communists and the Nazis both trying to promote their radical ideologies, bandits are stealing, killing and looting in the metro tunnels, even keeping hostages to gain bullets, which are used as currency. Twenty years later, in 2033, the northern station of VDNKh, now called Exhibition, falls under attack by a group of mysterious creatures referred to as the Dark Ones. Artyom (Russian: –ê—Ä—Ç—ë–º), a 24-year-old male survivor born before the bombs fell and the adopted son of the station commander, is persuaded to leave his home there and seek help from the rest of the Metro by Hunter, an elite soldier of the Spartan Order. Hunter gives Artyom his dog tags and tells him to present them to his superiors in Polis, the \\"capital\\" of the Metro, before disappearing while tracking the Dark Ones. The next day, Artyom signs on as an escort for a caravan headed to Riga, a neighboring station. Along the way, the crew is incapacitated by a psychic attack, but manage to reach the safety of the station's defenses after an attack by mutants. Afterward, Artyom meets Bourbon, a smuggler who offers to help him reach Polis as he was immune to the psychic attack. The two make their way through several other stations and tunnels, and even up through the very city of Moscow itself, before Bourbon is killed by bandits. A traveler named Khan rescues Artyom promptly after. After escorting Artyom through haunted tunnels and to a station under attack, Khan stays with the survivors and advises Artyom to meet his contact Andrew the Blacksmith, who lives under the control of the Red Line, a Stalinist regime. With his help, Artyom sneaks out of the Reds' territory but is subsequently captured by their enemies, the neo-Nazi Fourth Reich. Two Spartan Rangers, Pavel and Ulman, rescue him from execution. Pavel later dies in a handcar escorting Artyom out of the Reich, and he is forced to continue alone, eventually coming across a group of survivors trying to stop a mutant horde from reaching Polis. They fail, but Artyom manages to save a boy named Sasha before they escape. In gratitude, the defenders help him reach the surface, and he reunites with Ulman, who takes him to Miller, the colonel of the Order, in Polis. The governing council ultimately refuses to help Exhibition, but Miller reveals that he has a back- up plan: a missile silo known as D6 that has the firepower necessary to destroy the Dark Ones hive in the Botanical Gardens. To find a way to D6, Miller tells Artyom to meet him at the Moscow State Library to search for a book that may contain a map. Artyom makes his way into the library and eventually is forced to continue alone while avoiding the mutant Librarians. He eventually finds the book and flees with the help of Miller and Ulman. Artyom is recruited as a Spartan ranger, and takes part in an operation to locate and reactivate the command center of the D6 complex. After their success, he and Miller go to install a laser guidance system at the top of Ostankino Tower. After the laser system is installed, Artyom experiences a vivid hallucination induced by a Dark One. After the hallucination, two endings are possible depending on the choices the player makes throughout the game. In the canonical ending, Artyom allows the missiles to fire, destroying the Dark Ones; only to realize later that they sought peace and the deaths by them were merely self-defense, which was too late by then. The alternate ending gives Artyom the choice to destroy the laser guidance device, citing a last-minute realization that the Dark Ones were actually attempting to make peaceful contact through the hallucinations. This ending is only available by performing various positive acts throughout the game, such as helping out fellow humans and not automatically fleeing the Dark Ones in various hallucinations. Development and release 4A Games was founded by Oles' Shiskovtsov and Aleksandr Maksimchuk, former programmers for GSC Game World who left about a year before the release of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. Shiskovtsov and Maksimchuk had worked on the development of X-Ray engine used in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. In March 2006, 4A Games announced a partnership with Glukhovsky to collaborate on the game. The game was announced at the 2009 Games Convention in Leipzig; along with an official trailer. The game utilizes multi-platform 4A Engine, running on Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. There is some contention regarding whether the engine is based on the pre-release X-Ray engine (as claimed by Sergiy Grygorovych, the founder of GSC Game World, as well as users who have seen the 4A Engine SDK screenshots, citing visual similarities, shared resources, and technical evaluation of the pre-release 4A Engine demo conducted at the request of GSC Game World), or whether the engine is an original development (as claimed by 4A Games and Oles' Shiskovtsov in particular, who claims it would have been impractical to retrofit the X-ray engine with console support). 4A Engine features Nvidia PhysX support, enhanced AI, and a console SDK for Xbox 360. The PC version includes exclusive features such as DirectX 11 support and has been described as \\"a love letter to PC gamers\\" because of the developers' choice \\"to make the PC version [especially] phenomenal\\". A PlayStation 3 version was planned, but ultimately cancelled. On 19 February, THQ and 4A Games announced the game features Steamworks software and DRM. This gives Metro 2033 achievements, Steam support for in-game downloadable content and auto-updating. Metro 2033 was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on 16 March 2010 in North America, 18 March in Australia, and 19 March in Europe. A Collector's Edition of the game was released in Russia ‚Äì it contained the game itself in special packaging, a game guide, a map of the post-apocalyptic subway of Moscow and a unique watch with the game's logo on it. An even larger special edition was released in Poland; it contained: the game itself in special packaging, a Polish translation of the novel Metro 2033, instructions for the game, an army container and a gas mask (with filters and a military bag included). A special edition was also released in Germany ‚Äì more similar in size to the Russian collector's edition and smaller than the Polish one, it contained: the game itself in a special edition box, a hardback novel titled \\"Davor und Danach\\" (Before and After), a fully working replica of the watch that Artyom uses in the game, a bear-shaped key ring with one of Hunter's dog tags on it and a download code for the Heavy Automatic Shotgun. In February 2014, the Xbox 360 version of 2033 was included in Microsoft's \\"Games with Gold\\" program exclusively for German subscribers. This served as a replacement for Dead Island, the game offered in other territories, as it is unavailable for purchase in Germany. On 22 May 2014, a Redux version of the game was announced. It uses the latest version of the 4A Engine bringing the graphical and gameplay changes from Last Light to 2033. It was released on 26 August 2014 in North America and 29 August 2014 in Europe for the PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. It was delayed in Australia until 4 September. A compilation package, titled Metro Redux, was released at the same time which includes both games. The redux version of the two games were published by Deep Silver. A demo of the Redux version, which allows players to play through the first one- third of the game, was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 2 June 2015. Metro 2033 Redux and Last Light Redux were released separately on Google Stadia on 23 June 2020. In August 2015, the Xbox 360 version of 2033 was included in Microsoft's \\"Games with Gold\\" program for most Xbox Live regions. On Microsoft Windows, OS X (released on 14 April 2015), Linux (released on 11 December 2014), and SteamOS, a release entitled Metro Redux Bundle includes both this game and Last Light Redux. Reception Metro 2033 received favorable reviews from critics, scoring 81/100 and 77/100 on Metacritic for the PC and Xbox 360 versions respectively. Game Informer praised it, giving it 9 out of 10. GameZone's Dakota Grabowski gave the game an 8 out of 10, saying, \\"The single-player affair is worthy of every FPS fanatics' time since the 4A Games and THQ were able to put forth a wonderful tale that deserved telling. The world is engrossing as it invites players for multiple trips with the sheer amount of detail 4A Games spent implementing into the environments. Metro 2033 is as pure as they come in the genre and I gladly welcome any sequel that may reach fruition.\\" Good Game gave the game an 8.5 out of 10 praising the RPG and survival horror elements which add richness to the gameplay as well saying the HUD-less design was a choice which suits this particular game. Overall they said \\"I'm a big Fallout 3 fan and I was worried this would try to be something similar and fail dismally. But it's more FPS than RPG, so I think it manages to dodge a direct comparison. They've just worked really hard to bring RPG narrative and decisions into the action, and it works.\\" X-Play gave Metro 2033 a 3 out of 5. The reviewer approved of the game's atmosphere and attention to detail, and stated that the game had some truly scary moments. The reviewer also stated that the developers \\"didn't do enough with the creepy atmosphere\\", that the game had some almost truly frightening moments, but \\"never truly commits to scaring the audience\\". The reviewer said that the mapping of the buttons on the controller for the Xbox 360 can be \\"less than optimal\\", but the problem does not apply to PC users. In the conclusion, the reviewer said that the game was \\"over all a respectable effort, provided you don't expect the same level of depth found in, let's say Fallout 3.\\" GameSpot gave Metro 2033 7.5 out of 10 for the Xbox 360 version and 8 out of 10 for the PC version, praising the atmosphere but noting problems with the artificial intelligence and animations. IGN gave the game a lower rating of 6.9 out of 10 (identical for Xbox 360 and PC versions), citing the frame rate, bugs, and disappointing graphics as issues. Sequels Metro: Last Light was released in 2013. Even though it acts as a sequel to the original game, it does not follow any direct storylines from the book Metro 2034. An improved version called Redux, with all downloadable content was released in 2014. A compilation package, titled Metro Redux, was released at the same time which includes both Last Light and Metro 2033. Another sequel, Metro Exodus, was released in 2019.

It is one of only four official Christian places of worship in Pyongyang. It operates under the Korean Catholic Association. History Before the division of Korea, Pyongyang was the city with the highest number of Christian believers in Korea, and was known as the \\"Korean Jerusalem\\".http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/08/15/while-pope-visits-south- north-korea-quiet-catholics-cut-off-from-vatican/ By 1945, nearly 1/6 of its citizens were Christians. Therefore, Pyongyang was made into the only diocese in northern Korea. After the division of Korea, however, the Communist government under Kim Il-sung persecuted Christians as imperialist collaborators and spies; even the famous Christian Nationalist Cho Man-sik, initially more influential than Kim, was arrested and shot. Much of the Catholic community was either killed or imprisoned, and many more fled south. The original cathedral, built of red brick in the late 19th century, was destroyed in the Korean War by American forces. Earlier, in 1949, the last formal Bishop of Pyongyang, Francis Hong Yong-ho, had been imprisoned by the communist government; he later disappeared. In 1988 a new cathedral was opened in East Pyongyang. At the same time, two nondenominational \\"protestant\\" churches were opened in an effort by the government to show religious freedom. Operation The cathedral is operated by the Korean Catholic Association and is not affiliated with the Holy See. Because of the strained relations with the Holy See, the cathedral currently has no bishop or even an ordained priest.https://philosophynow.org/issues/78/New_Atheists_and_Old_Atheists There is no resident priest either.

The British captured her in 1807 and named her HMS Heureux. After service in the Caribbean that earned her crew two medals, including one for a boat action in which her captain was killed, she was laid up in 1810 and sold in 1814. French service Lynx was the name ship of her two-vessel class of brigs. She was built to plans by Pierre-Jacques-Nicolas Rolland. The French Navy commissioned her in June 1804 under Lieutenant Fargenel. She took part in the Trafalgar Campaign, ferrying dispatches between Fort de France and France, where she arrived on 10 July 1805. She was then attached to a five-frigate squadron under Commodore Eleonore-Jean-Nicolas Soleil, tasked with ferrying supplies and troops to the French West Indies. A British squadron intercepted the convoy, which led to the Action of 25 September 1806, where the British captured four of the frigates. Lynx, the frigate Th√©tis, and the corvette Sylphe escaped, with Lynx managing to outrun HMS Windsor Castle. Lynx finally arrived in Martinique on 31 October. Capture The boats of , under Lieutenant William Coombe, captured Lynx off Les Saintes on 21 January 1807. The boats, manned with five officers, 50 seamen and 20 marines, had to row for eight hours, mainly in the blazing sun, to catch her. During the action Coombe, who had already lost a leg in a previous action, received a musket ball through the thigh above the previous amputation. The British only succeeded in boarding Lynx on their third attempt and a desperate struggle occurred on deck as the crew of the Lynx outnumbered their attackers. The British lost nine men killed and 22 wounded, including Coombe. The French had 14 killed and 20 wounded, including the captain. The Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded Coombe and several of the other British officers swords worth 50 guineas, but Coombe did not live to receive his.Long (1895), pp.231-2. The surviving officers were promoted; Coombe was promoted to commander but appointed as captain of , not Lynx. Hart was a lesser vessel than Lynx and Coombe complained to the admiral of the station and then to the Admiralty. The Admiralty reversed the appointments, which led to Coombe fighting a duel with the relegated captain.The United service magazine, (1854), p.545. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"21 Jan. Boat Service 1807\\" to all surviving claimants of the action. The British took Lynx into service as HMS Heureux as the Royal Navy already had a , and had lost an the year before. British service Heureux was commissioned in Antigua in April 1807 under Coombe. Coombe was killed in the early morning of 29 November 1808. He had received information that seven French vessels were lying under the protection of two batteries in the harbour at Mahaut, Guadeloupe and decided to attack them. Coombe took three boats and 63 men who rowed six hours to reach Mahaut at about midnight. The cutting out party then waited for four hours at their oars until just after the moon set at 4 am on 29 November. Coombe, with 19 men, boarded and carried a schooner armed with two guns and with a crew of 39 men. After a few minutes of desperate fighting the attackers prevailed. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Daniel Lawrence and the remainder of the party landed and spiked three 24-pounders in the batteries, before boarding a brig. On the way out the prizes grounded, making them ideal targets for small arms fire and the three field pieces that the French had brought down to the shore. As Coombe was about to abandon the prizes, a 24-pound shot struck him on the left side, killing him almost immediately. A musket ball wounded Lawrence in the forearm. Still, he extricated all the men without further casualties.Long (1895), p.236. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"28 Nov.

He was prosecuted at the Auschwitz Trial, sentenced to death and hanged.  Life  Bogusch was born in Lubliniec, Upper Silesia. He joined the Nazi Party in October 1932 and the SS in April 1933 (number 51922). On 21 August 1939 he was drafted into the SS- Totenkopfverb√§nde and was posted to Buchenwald concentration camp.

After the evacuation of Auschwitz he was sent to Mysen concentration camp near Oslo, and in February 1945, was transferred back to Buchenwald. He was also deployed to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. In the summer of 1943, Bogusch participated in the extermination process, where he selected Jews from arriving transports to the gas chambers.

Bruun and Nick Goldfarb. The film was selected to world premiere at the 2005 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. Plot Joe Pace is a radio personality whose program, The F Word, is being shut down by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) after racking up over $1 million in unpaid indecency fines. On his last day on the air, which coincides with the last day of the 2004 Republican National Convention, Joe sets off to broadcast his own one-man march through Manhattan. Style and structure Combining fictional scenes - written by over thirty different writers - set among actual protests with documentary footage of people Joe meets along the way, the film weaves together a seamless narrative. In a uniquely interactive writing process, each day new scenes were written and appropriated to upcoming events and in response to the previous day's footage. It is often impossible to tell the difference between fiction and reality. The concept is loosely inspired by Medium Cool by Haskell Wexler. The film was shot by cinematographer Christian Ditlev Bruun and Heather Greer on two main cameras at 24 frames/second, as well as several other video formats for b-roll. The film was unconventionally color corrected and composited using several different types of software as well as in-camera adjustments creating a unique, photographic expression. Motion graphics, titles, and color grading as well as the official poster and website was designed by Christian D. Bruun. Cast Josh Hamilton stars along with Edoardo Ballerini, Zak Orth, Sam Rockwell, Callie Thorne, Waris Ahluwalia, Yul Vazquez and others, including many leaders of the protest movement: Reverend Billy, Peter Camejo, John Perry Barlow.  Technical information  The film's main cameras were two Panasonic AG-DVX100(b) video cameras, filming at 23.976 fps with Advanced Pulldown. A few additional shots were filmed on other DV cameras using various pulldown techniques in Adobe After Effects. The film was edited using Final Cut Pro, the title sequence and all visual effects - created by Christian D. Bruun - were done using Adobe After Effects. The film was on-lined and output to HD using and Avid Symphony system.

Oakland, California. 1901. By 1853, Jos√© de Jesus and Sisto Berelleza had sold minor parcels of Rancho Las Putas, referred to as Berryessa Ranch by the American settlers, to pay gambling debts. They owed Edward Schultz $1,645 but couldn't pay him in cash; Schultz petitioned the county to auction a major section of the Berreyesa holdings. In the auction, Schultz paid only $2,000 for the huge parcel, and quickly resold it for $100,000 to a consortium of developers. In 1866, the developers holding the majority of land in the valley divided Rancho Las Putas into smaller parcels to sell to farmers, and platted a town called Monticello. Within a year, the valley was filled with farmers who enjoyed mild winters and bountiful harvests, especially of wheat. By 1870, Monticello contained a cemetery, a general store, blacksmith shops, hotels and various other businesses. In 1875, a former toll road through the valley was opened to become a public road, maintained by the county. A four- and six-horse stagecoach ran from the 300 menBellaVistaRanch.net. Suisun History.

The Berreyesas moved from their original hacienda holdings to smaller dwellings. The large adobe estate house belonging to Sisto Berreyesa was left to ruin, but a second, smaller one, was held by a settler named Abraham Clark. In the late 19th century, the valley floor was covered with family farms whose land titles could be traced to the Homestead Act of 1862. Much of the valley floor was covered with dry-farmed wheat and barley fields, with some orchards and grapevines mixed in. Ranching was mostly in the foothills. In 1900 and 1901, news of a high-quality oil strike in Berryessa Valley brought speculators and experts in drilling, but no results. Damming Putah Creek In 1896, a heavy stone bridge with three large arches was built across Putah Creek about from Monticello, along the road leading to Napa. The bridge cost $19,500 and, at long, was the largest stone bridge west of the Rocky Mountains. The well-engineered bridge survived the swollen flood of Putah Creek every winter thenceforward. As early as 1906, proposals were put forward to dam Putah Creek to form a reservoir. In 1907, the Mulholland- Goethals-Davis plan proposed a dam at Devil's Gate, the southeastern limit of the valley. Other plans were formulated, but no proposal was acted upon until 1947 when Solano County and the United States Bureau of Reclamation together formed the Solano Project, a combination of water plans including Monticello Dam, the Putah Diversion Dam, the Putah South Canal, the Terminal Dam and Reservoir, the Green Valley Conduit and various related water distribution systems. Residents of Monticello protested, but California Governor Earl Warren and Solano County promoted the dam as necessary for the economic and agricultural growth of the surrounding area. Residents started leaving the valley to find homes elsewhere.BellaVistaRanch.net. Suisun History. Nancy Dingler, Part 3 - Fifty years since the birth of the Monticello Dam. Retrieved on August 14, 2009. Dorothea Lange and Pirkle Jones were commissioned to shoot a photographic documentary of the death of the town, and of the displacement of its residents, for Life, but the magazine did not run the piece. Lange's Aperture magazine, however, devoted one whole issue to the photojournalists' work. Construction of the dam began in 1953. Vegetation in the valley was chopped down, fences torn down and buildings demolished down to their foundations. The town cemetery was moved to Spanish Flat, a bluff overlooking the valley. The Putah Creek Bridge, too well made to easily demolish, was left in place to be covered by the rising waters. Monticello Dam was completed in 1957, and Lake Berryessa was formed. On February 26, 1957, crews poured the last bucket of concrete for Monticello Dam. Following tradition, they tossed in a few coins as well. A post office functioned at Monticello from 1867 to 1956.

It was a single-engined pusher biplane based on a floatplane built by Sopwith before the war for Greece. Small numbers were built and used by the British Royal Naval Air Service, mainly as a trainer. Development and design In 1913, the Sopwith Aviation Company received an order for six two- seat floatplane from the Greek Government for the Greek Naval Air Service, which was in the process of being set up on the basis of advice from Rear Admiral Mark Kerr, the head of the British Naval Mission to Greece.Robertson 1970, p. 44.T. Mason 1982, p. 78. Sopwith's design, known as the \\"Greek Seaplane\\" or \\"Pusher Seaplane\\" was a single-engined pusher biplane powered by a single 100 hp (75 kW) Anzani radial engine, with four-bay wings. It was fitted with dual controls for use as a trainer.Bruce 1957, p. 524. Operational history The first of the Greek Pusher Seaplanes flew in February 1914, successfully passing trials in March, with first deliveries in May and all six delivered by the outbreak of the First World War. Two more identical trainers were purchased by the Royal Naval Air Service, again for use as trainers, these being delivered in May. While the Greek machines performed well, despite the limited facilities available at their base at Eleusina, with at first no workshops or hangars available, the two British aircraft were less successful, with their engines proving unreliable, and were withdrawn by February 1915. In March 1914, the Greeks placed an order for six more pusher seaplanes, the Sopwith S PG N, which were similar to their previous aircraft, but rather than being dual control trainers, were to be armed with a machine gun in the nose, and powered by a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine. At least five of these aircraft were taken over by the Royal Navy at the outbreak of war, but again proved unsuccessful in British Service, with at least two being modified as landplanes. They remained in service until July 1915. The Royal Navy ordered six modified landplane based on the S PG N in July 1914, the Sopwith Gunbus or Admiralty Type 806, to be powered by 110 hp (82 kW) Sunbeam water-cooled V8 engines and armed with a machine gun. The first one flew on 6 October 1914, and was found to be underpowered, so was fitted with a 150 hp (112 kW) Sunbeam. A further 30 aircraft were ordered from Robey & Co. Ltd. of Lincoln in early 1915, these being fitted with a modified nacelle, with the pilot sitting in the forward cockpit rather than the gunner, and fitted for bombing. Only 17 of these aircraft were completed, with the remaining 13 delivered as spare parts.Bruce 1968, pp. 110‚Äì111. The Sunbeam- powered Gunbuses saw limited operational use, with one aircraft being on the strength of the RNAS squadron at Dunkirk led by Commander Charles Samson in February 1915, with Samson commenting that the Sopwith required \\"a lot of work on it to make it safe to fly\\".Bruce 1968, pp. 109‚Äì110. The Gunbuses were used mainly as trainers, being used by the RNAS at Hendon,F. K. Mason 1992, p. 20. and remaining in service until the winter of 1915-16.Bruce 1968, p. 111. The name Gunbus came from the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) pilot's slang term for an aeroplane - a bus - and was also used in the name of the Vickers Gunbus. Variants ;Pusher Seaplane or Greek Seaplane :Dual control trainer floatplane powered by an Anzani 10-cylinder 100 hp (75 kW) radial engine, giving a speed of 55 mph (89 km/h) and climbing to 2,000 ft (610 m) in 12¬Ω minutes. Six were built for Greek Navy and two for RNAS. ;S PG N :Armed version of Pusher Seaplane powered by Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine. Six were ordered for Greece, with at least five commandeered by the RNAS at the outbreak of the First World War. At least two were modified as landplanes. ;Gunbus :Landplane version for RNAS, the Gunbus was officially designated the Admiralty Type 806. It had a revised nacelle which was raised above the centre section of the lower wing rather than being directly attached and was powered by a Sunbeam engine. Six gun-armed aircraft were built by Sopwith, with a further 30 modified aircraft fitted for bombing ordered from Robey and Co., of which only 17 were completed.Bruce 1957, p. 525.

It is created by a positive feedback between mid- channel deposition and flow divergence. As the flow diverges near the ocean, sediment settles out in the channel and creates an incipient mouth bar. As flow is routed around the incipient bar, additional sediment is deposited on the incipient bar. This continued process results in the formation of a full- fledged mouth bar, which causes the channel to bifurcate. This continued process leads to the characteristic fractal tree pattern found in some prograding river-dominated deltas.

Built at Brest on private plans by Pierre Ozanne, she was particularly fast. The French Navy adopted the design and copied the plans as late as 1848. Originally armed with 6-pounder guns, she was later rearmed with heavier carronades. She continued in service, off and on, until she was struck in 1854. French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars Diligente took part in the Atlantic campaign of 1806 in Leiss√®gues' squadron, culminating in the Battle of San Domingo. The frigates , , and Diligente captured and burned the American vessel Lark, Moore, master, which was sailing from Philadelphia to Jamaica. In August 1808 Diligente, captained by Commander Jean-Fran√ßois Lemaresquier, with the corvettes and Espi√®gle, sailed from France with supplies for the island of Martinique. British ships chased the group through the Bay of Biscay and captured Sylphe and Espi√®gle. Diligente escaped, only to encounter the British sloop , under Commander (later to be Admiral) Charles Napier, off Antigua. During a hard-fought action lasting three hours, Recruits mainmast fell, putting her somewhat at Diligentes mercy. However, a lucky shot ignited Diligentes ammunition store, causing some damage. Diligente withdrew and later Lemaresquier justified his action on the grounds that other British naval vessels were approaching, which they were not, and the weight of Recruits broadside, which was heavier.James (1837), pp.88‚Äì9. On 3 October, Diligente sank the Mexican brig Juliana. Then on 12 November she returned to Lorient. Here she served from 1811 to 1812 as a school ship. On 12 March she was in the harbour at Brest. On 2 December 1812, she accidentally collided with in the Roads of Toulon. She may have cruised in the Channel as reported that on 20 December 1813 she had retaken and sent in the brig Racehorse, from Newfoundland for Teignmouth, that the French corvette Diligente had captured. In 1814 Diligente was paid off. Bourbon Restoration After the Bourbon Restoration, Diligente underwent refitting at Brest between 22 August 1820 and 4 January 1821. She was recommissioned with 18-pounder carronades and was reclassified as a corvette aviso (sloop corvette). Then on 21 April she left Brest for the Antilles, Guiana and Newfoundland. By 30 August 1822 she was in the Antilles again. On 2 November 1822 Diligente left Rochefort for Brazil, not returning to Brest until 27 December 1826. Around 1825 or so she was off the coast of Chile where she took a privateer that had fired a broadside at her. In 1827 Diligente was again decommissioned for refitting. Then in 1828 she was in the Eastern Mediterranean. July Monarchy Under Commandant Garibou Diligente took part in the expedition to the mouth of the Tagus River where a French squadron fought the Battle of the Tagus on 11 July 1831. The French vessels fought their way past the Portuguese forts guarding the mouth of the river and sailed up to Lisbon. There they forced the Portuguese king Dom Miguel to accede to French demands, among them that he recognize the July Monarchy. The French also seized all the military and commercial vessels they could find as reparations. Then in 1835‚Äì36 Diligente was on the Livorno station. On 30 January 1836, she was driven ashore and severely damaged at Livorno. On 26 October 1840 she left Toulon for Alexandria, Egypt. She visited Smyrna in March 1841. Lastly, she was present at Athens during the 3 September 1843 Revolution. Fate Diligente was struck off on 11 October 1854.

Painting by JB Hirschmann. Christoph Franz von Buseck (28 December 1724 - 28 September 1805) was the Roman Catholic bishop of Bamberg and the last Prince-Bishop of Bamberg. Early life Von Buseck was born in Jagstberg to Ernst Johann Philipp Hartmann von Buseck and Mary Ann. Almost nothing is known of his early life. Tenure as Bishop On 7 April 1794, von Buseck was elected Prince-Bishop of Bamberg and ordained to the priesthood. His nephew, Georg Karl von Fechenbach, the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg, consecrated him as a bishop on 16 August 1795 and he took office. Von Buseck proved to be a very weak ruler. In 1796, when Bamberg was invaded by the French, von Buseck fled to Prague and when the French invaded Prague in 1799, he fled to Saalfeld. He returned to Bamburg in 1800 and appointed his nephew as his coadjutor bishop and successor. In the course of the German mediatization of 1802‚Äì1803, which saw the suppression of all the Holy Roman Empire ecclesiastical principalities, Bavaria occupied the former prince-bishopric on 29 September 1802 and annexed its territories. However, until his death on 28 September 1805, von Buseck remained bishop of Bamberg, but bereft of any temporal power. He was then succeed by his nephew. After his nephew's death in 1808, the See remained vacant until 1818, by which time Bamberg had been elevated to an archbishopric following the Bavarian Concordat of June 1817.

History and origin The Kayastha (also known as Kulshreshtha, Kulshrestha, Kayasth or Kayeth) community has historically been involved in the occupations of land record keeping and accounting. Some Hindu Kayasth found favour with Muslim rulers for whom the acted as Qanungo employees of the court and judicial systems.

Upon their death, Chitragupta has the task of deciding heaven or the hell for the humans, depending on their actions on the earth. Chitragupta Maharaj (Chitragupta the King) is the patron deity and forefather of Kayasthas, a Hindu caste and are scribes, Officials, administrators, writers, magistrates, judges. lawyers, chief executive officers and village accountants in ancient South Asia. Kayasthas celebrate: Qalam and Dawaat (pen and ink-pot) worship, a ritual in which pens, papers and books were worshipped. This clearly shows that they were clerks and official record keepers of the kings. Kayasthas were valued in the second millennia by most kingdoms and princely states as desired citizens or immigrants within South Asia. The Muslim kingdoms treated the Kayasthas more as a community rather than a Hindu caste because they developed expertise in Persian (the state language in Islamic India), learned Turkish and Arabic, economics, administration and taxation. This gave them an edge over the Brahmins (the priestly Hindu caste), who traditionally had reserved the study of Sanskrit shastras to themselves. They successfully adapted themselves as scribes and functionaries under Islamic rule and later on under the British. Some historians hold the view that during the reign of the Mughals, a number of upper caste Hindus who were educated and endowed with sharp intellect attained administrative positions through rapid adaptation to the Persian language and culture of the new rulers of South Asia. These influential upper caste Hindus got together and formed a new caste known as Kayastha. Their secular viewpoint to life, adaptability and lifestyle was an asset which allowed them to succeed. This close association with Muslim rulers led to the conversion of most members of the Kayastha community to Islam. The Muslim Kayasthas outnumbered the Hindu Kayastha even today. The Muslim Kayasthas have intermarried with the other Muslim communities over the centuries and have lost their community consciousness and consider themselves to be part of the Urdu speaking and Bengali speaking Muslims of northern India and eastern India. The Muslim Kayastha community also adapted to changes, such as the advent of the British Raj. They learned English, the more affluent ones sent their children to the United Kingdom, they became civil servants, tax officers, junior administrators, teachers, legal helpers and barristers, and rose to the highest positions accessible to natives in British India. The Muslim Kayasth have traditionally been a literate and landlord community living as Patwaris and Qanungohs (land record keepers). The only exception being the large taluqdar families, who were substantial landowners. They have high rates of literacy, and many have played important roles in the cultural life of the North Indian Muslim community. Present circumstances The Muslim Kayastha are considered to be Shaikh and follow Sunni Hanafi fiqh. The Muslim Kayasthas have intermarried with the other Muslim communities over the centuries and have lost their community consciousness and have assimilated into Urdu speaking Muslims of Pakistan and northern India. They live mainly in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, the provinces of Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan and many have now settled in United Kingdom, United States and Canada.

Polemics have also been written on the Church and its practices. Some examples are the anti-Catholic stereotypes that filled Gothic fiction of Anglican England, the films of Luis Bu√±uel who had his issues with the Church in Spain, the humor of some US television pundits like Rosie O'Donnell, and the rhetoric of some fundamentalist preachers. Since the Reformation sexual immorality by individuals in the Catholic church has been fertile ground for criticism, with biased coverage evident in media coverage of abuse cases. Literature Anti-Catholic stereotypes are a long-standing feature of English literature, popular fiction, and even pornography. Gothic fiction is particularly rich in this regard. Lustful priests, cruel abbesses, immured nuns, and sadistic inquisitors appear in such works as The Italian by Ann Radcliffe, The Monk by Matthew Lewis, Melmoth the Wanderer by Charles Maturin and The Pit and the Pendulum by Edgar Allan Poe.Patrick R O'Malley (2006) Catholicism, sexual deviance, and Victorian Gothic culture. Cambridge University Press Such gothic fiction may have inspired Rebecca Reed's Six Months in a Convent which describes her alleged captivity by an Ursuline order near Boston in 1832. Reed's claims inspired an angry mob to burn down the convent, and her narrative, released three years later as the rioters were tried, famously sold 200,000 copies in one month. Reed's book was soon followed by another bestselling fraudulent expos√©, Awful Disclosures of the Hotel-Dieu Nunnery (1836) in which Maria Monk claimed that the convent served as a harem for Catholic priests, and that any resulting children were murdered after baptism. Col. William Stone, a New York city newspaper editor, along with a team of Protestant investigators, inquired into Monk's claims, inspecting the convent in the process. Col. Stone's investigation concluded there was no evidence that Maria Monk \\"had ever been within the walls of the cloister\\". Reed's book became a best-seller, and Monk or her handlers hoped to cash in on the evident market for anti-Catholic horror fiction. The tale of Maria Monk was, in fact, clearly modeled on the Gothic novels popular in the early 19th century. This literary genre had already been used for anti- Catholic sentiments in works such as Matthew Lewis' The Monk. Maria Monk's story exhibits the genre-defining elements of a young and innocent woman trapped in a remote, old, and gloomily picturesque estate; she learns the dark secrets of the place; after harrowing adventures she escapes.Franchot, Jenny (1994). \\"Two Escaped Nuns: Rebecca Reed and Maria Monk\\", Roads to Rome: The Antebellum Protestant Encounter with Catholicism. Berkeley, California (USA): The University of California Press. The anti-Catholic Gothic tradition continued with Charlotte Bront√´'s semi-autobiographical novel Villette (1853). Bronte explores the culture clash between the heroine's English Protestantism and the Catholicism of the environment at her school in 'Villette' (aka Brussels) before magisterially pronouncing \\"God is not with Rome.\\" In a chapter of Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov called The Grand Inquisitor, the Catholic Church convicts a returned-from-Heaven Jesus Christ of heresy and is portrayed as a servant of Satan. Dan Brown's best-selling novel The Da Vinci Code depicts the Catholic Church as determined to hide the truth about Mary Magdalene. An article in an April 2004 issue of National Catholic Register maintains that \\"The Da Vinci Code claims that Catholicism is a big, bloody, woman-hating lie created out of pagan cloth by the manipulative Emperor of Rome\\". An earlier book by Brown, Angels & Demons, depicts the Church as involved in an elemental battle with the Illuminati. A World Lit Only by Fire by William Manchester quotes several anti-Catholic stereotypes about Middle Ages, while pretending to be academic. In Germany, Otto von Corvin has published two anti-Catholic books. Cinema Many film-makers have attacked Catholicism in their work (e.g. La B√™te by Walerian Borowczyk). One of the most notable is the Spanish film director Luis Bu√±uel, a fierce critic of what he saw as the pretension and hypocrisy of the Catholic Church. Many of his most famous films demonstrate this: Un chien andalou (1929): A man drags pianos, upon which are piled several priests, among other things. L'√Çge d'Or (1930): A bishop is thrown out a window, and in the final scene one of the culprits of the 120 days of Sodom by Marquis de Sade is portrayed by an actor dressed in a way that he would be recognized as Jesus. Ensayo de un crimen (1955): A man dreams of murdering his wife while she's praying in bed dressed all in white. Simon of the Desert (1965): The devil tempts the saint by taking the form of a naughty, bare-breasted little girl singing and showing off her legs. At the end of the film, the saint abandons his ascetic life to hang out in a jazz club. Nazarin (1959): The pious lead character wreaks ruin through his attempts at charity. Viridiana (1961): A well-meaning young nun tries unsuccessfully to help the poor. The Milky Way (1969): Two men travel the ancient pilgrimage road to Santiago de Compostela and meet the embodiments of various heresies along the way. One dreams of anarchists shooting the Pope (recognisably Pope Paul VI). In Elizabeth, the strife during the English Reformation is portrayed as being entirely the fault of the Catholic Church, contrary to fact, with demeaning and inaccurate negative stereotypes as Catholic figures.Elizabeth is \\"resolutely anti-Catholic\\" Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, January‚ÄìFebruary 1999 The films of Bu√±uel (who reportedly 'thanked God he was an atheist') initially scandalised the Catholic church. For instance Viridiana was denounced by the Vatican and, in Catholic Spain where the film was produced, an attempt was made to destroy all copies; Catholic Italy sentenced Bu√±uel, in absentia, to a year in jail, whilst in Catholic Belgium copies of the film were seized and mutilated. Latterly, however, there was a change of attitude. For instance the US National Catholic Film Office, gave Nazarin an award, recognising its spiritual value, and the heretical Milky Way was screened at the Festival of Cinema of Religious and Human Values in Valladolid. Some of Bu√±uel's free thinking friends even alleged that he had received Vatican money for the latter film. Ironically Bu√±uel's last months were enlivened by his friendship with a Catholic priest, Father Julian Pablo, with whom he indulged in theological wrangles over points of Catholic dogma.John Baxter (1994) Bu√±uel. London: Fourth Estate. Miramax, a company run by Harvey Weinstein, has been accused of spreading anti-Catholic propaganda. According to Jesuit Fr. James Martin, the U.S. entertainment industry is of \\"two minds\\" about the Catholic Church. He argues that, > On the one hand, film and television producers seem to find Catholicism > irresistible. There are a number of reasons for this. First, more than any > other Christian denomination, the Catholic Church is supremely visual, and > therefore attractive to producers and directors concerned with the visual > image. Vestments, monstrances, statues, crucifixes ‚Äì to say nothing of the > symbols of the sacraments ‚Äì are all things that more \\"word oriented\\" > Christian denominations have foregone. The Catholic Church, therefore, lends > itself perfectly to the visual media of film and television. You can be sure > that any movie about the Second Coming or Satan or demonic possession or, > for that matter, any sort of irruption of the transcendent into everyday > life, will choose the Catholic Church as its venue > Second, the Catholic Church is still seen as profoundly \\"other\\" in modern > culture and is therefore an object of continuing fascination. As already > noted, it is ancient in a culture that celebrates the new, professes truths > in a postmodern culture that looks skeptically on any claim to truth, and > speaks of mystery in a rational, post-Enlightenment world. It is therefore > the perfect context for scriptwriters searching for the \\"conflict\\" required > in any story. He argues that, despite this fascination with the Catholic Church, the entertainment industry also holds contempt for the Church. \\"It is as if producers, directors, playwrights and filmmakers feel obliged to establish their intellectual bona fides by trumpeting their differences with the institution that holds them in such thrall.\\" Television Father Martin suggests that \\"it is television that has proven the most fertile ground for anti-Catholic writing. Priests, when they appear on television shows, usually appear as pedophiles or idiots, and are rarely seen to be doing their jobs.\\" In October 2006, top Catholic leaders in the state of Minnesota took a rare step in collectively calling on University of Minnesota President Robert Bruininks to reconsider the university's plan to stage a controversial play that they viewed as anti-Catholic, The Pope and the Witch. Rosie O'Donnell has been accused of serial anti-Catholicism and labeled a bigot by Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights. On the 24 February 2003 episode of Phil Donahue's talk show O'Donnell referred to the \\"pedophile scandal\\" in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston resulting in $157 million awarded to 983 claimants, stating \\"I hope the Catholic Church gets sued until the end of time. Maybe, you know, we can melt down some of the gold toilets in the Pope's Vatican and pay off some of the lawsuits, because the whole tenet of living a Christ-like life has been lost in Catholicism.\\" On The View, Rosie O'Donnell has regularly joked about communion rituals alongside co-host Joy Behar's drunk priest comments. On 2 October 2006 she compared the Republican Party cover-up of the Mark Foley scandal to the cover- up of child sexual abuse by Catholic Church officials who actively concealed perpetrators by moving them from parish to parish, as detailed in Amy Berg's award-winning film about the abuse within the Catholic Church. O'Donnell said \\"the most interesting thing about Deliver Us from Evil [is] that the person who was in charge of investigating all the allegations of pedophilia in the Catholic church from the ‚Äò80s until just recently was guess who? The current Pope.\\" Although Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) was the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith from November 1981 to April 2005, responsibility to investigate sexual abuse of minors by priests only started in 2001 and the Pope has denounced the abuse. On 19 April 2007 the all-woman panel on The View discussed the Supreme Court of the United States ruling on the Gonzales v. Carhart decision upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. O'Donnell cited a Gloria Steinem quote, \\"If men could get pregnant abortion would be a sacrament\\" adding \\"How many Supreme Court judges are Catholic?\\" and \\"[H]ow about separation of church and state?\\" This sparked reaction from conservatives calling her statements \\"anti-Catholic bigotry\\" and suggested that such statements against other religions would be abhorred. Modern polemics Themes of modern anti-Catholic controversialists included accusations of paganism, idolatry and conspiracy theories which accuse the church of seeking world domination. Some Protestant polemics also brand the Catholic Church as the Antichrist and the Whore of Babylon. One example of modern anti-Catholic polemic can be found in the writings of the American evangelical author John Dowling. In his The History of Romanism, he accused the Catholic church of being \\"the bitterest foe of all true churches of Christ ‚Äì that she possesses no claim to be called a Christian church ‚Äì but, with the long line of corrupt and wicked men who have worn her triple crown, that she is ANTI-CHRIST\\".John Dowling, The History of Romanism 2nd edition, 1852, pp. 646‚Äì47). Cover of a 1919 edition of Hislop's Anti-Catholic The Two Babylons Alexander Hislop's pseudohistorical work The Two Babylons (1858) asserted that the Roman Catholic Church originated from a Babylonian mystery religion, claiming that its doctrines and ceremonies are a veiled continuation of Babylonian paganism. The renegade priest Charles Chiniquy's 50 Years In The Church of Rome and The Priest, the Woman and the Confessional (1885) also depicted Catholicism as pagan. Avro Manhattan's books,Vatican Moscow Alliance (1982), The Vatican Billions (1983), and The Vatican's Holocaust (1986) advance the view that the Church engineers wars for world domination. Hislop's and Chiniquy's nineteenth century polemics and Avro Manhattan's work form part of the basis of a series of tracts by the noted modern anti-Catholic and comic book evangelist Jack Chick who also accuses the papacy of supporting Communism, of using the Jesuits to incite revolutions, and of masterminding the Holocaust. According to Chick, the Catholic Church is the \\"Whore of Babylon\\" referred to in the Book of Revelation, and will bring about a Satanic New World Order before it is destroyed by Jesus Christ. Chick claims that the Catholic Church infiltrates and attempts to destroy or corrupt all other religions and churches, and that it uses various means including seduction, framing, and murder to silence its critics. Drawing on the ideas of Alberto Rivera, Chick also claims that the Catholic Church helped mould Islam as a tool to lure people away from Christianity in what he calls the Vatican Islam Conspiracy. David Ranan's Double Cross: The Code of the Catholic Church asks three questions: should the pope be sacked? Should the Vatican be dissolved? Can the Catholic Church be saved? His analysis of the Church's history, dogma and present day strategies leads to the conclusion that the Catholic Church is incapable of accepting her culpability and therefore unlikely to change. Author David Yallop has followed up his best-selling book In God's Name (1984), which claimed that Pope John Paul I was killed by corrupt Vatican schemers (see Pope John Paul I conspiracy theories) with another The Power and the Glory: Inside the Dark Heart of John Paul II's Vatican (2007) which claims that Pope John Paul II was in league with Soviet power. Yallop enlarges on claims of priestly sexual abuse and repeats other standard anti-Catholic tropes listed above together with a new one that St Maximilian Kolbe, the Polish priest who died in place of a young married man at Auschwitz, had previously endorsed the anti-Jewish Protocols of the Elders of Zion. There is no reference for this claim and just thirteen footnotes in the entire 530 pages. Satire and humour The Catholic church has been a target for satire and humour, from the time of the Reformation to the present day. Such satire and humour ranges from mild burlesque to vicious attacks. Catholic clergy and lay organizations such as the Catholic League monitor for particularly offensive and derogatory incidences and voice their objections and protests. Gender and sexuality Accusations of deviant sexuality have provided a rich field for anti-Catholic polemicists since the time of the Reformation. Under Henry VIII, even before he broke with Rome, lurid tales of sexual deviancy by monks and nuns were part of the justification for the Dissolution of the Monasteries. According to a later commentator the alleged carnal misdeeds of the monks and nuns were recorded in a 'Black Book' wherein was recorded \\"the vile lives and abhominable factes in murders of their bretherene, in sodomyes and whordomes, in destroying children, in forging deedes and other horrors of life\\" (sic).Cottonian MSS quoted in Alan Ivimey (nd) A History of London: 113 R.W. Dixon in his History of the Church of England justified the Dissolution of the monasteries on the grounds that they were under \\"the condemnation of Sodom and Gomorrah\\", i.e., some monks and nuns were homosexual.R.W Dixon History of the Church of England quoted in Alan Ivimey (nd) A History of London: 112 Prior to the Dissolution its instigator Thomas Cromwell had decreed death by hanging for homosexuals through the Buggery Act of 1533: the first time the death penalty had been applied for this offence in England.The Buggery Act In the twentieth century the Nazi government denounced the Catholic Church as \\"awash with sex fiends\\" (the Nazi Churches minister claimed that 7,000 clergy had been convicted of sex crimes between 1933 and 1937 while \\"the true figure seems to have been 170, of whom many had left the religious life prior to their offences.\\")Michael Burleigh, Sacred Causes (HarperPress, 2006) These accusations were part of a campaign by some members of the Nazi party, including Joseph Goebbels, to reduce the influence of the Catholic Church in Nazi Germany during the second half of the 1930s.Evans, Richard J. \\"The Third Reich in Power\\" page 244-245 Erotic literature has often been a vehicle for anti-Catholic sentiments. Victorian writer Henry Spencer Ashbee devotes 300 pages of the second volume of his three volume bibliography of erotic works to such anti-Catholic pornography.Steven Marcus (1969) The Other Victorians: 34-77 In particular, the erotic life of nuns has held great fascination from Denis Diderot's La Religieuse of 1798. Recent times have brought nunsploitation films, often seen as pure exploitation but at times containing criticism against religion in general and the Catholic church in particular. Indeed, some of the protagonists voice a feminist consciousness and a rejection of their subordinated social role. For instance at the end of The Nun and the Devil, based on the true events of the suppression of the Convent of Sant Archagelo at Naples in the 16th century, a condemned nun launches a bitter attack against the church hierarchy. Many of these films were made in countries where the Catholic church is dominant, such as Italy and Spain.Convent Erotica Lately sexual abuse by representatives of the Catholic church has been highlighted in such films as The Magdalene Sisters (2002). However the veracity of the bestselling Kathy's Story by Kathy O'Beirne which details physical and sexual abuse suffered in a Magdalene laundry in Ireland has been questioned in a new book entitled Kathy's Real Story by Hermann Kelly. In this book it is alleged that false allegations against the priesthood are being fueled by a government compensation scheme for victims.Hermann Kelly (2007) Kathy's Real Story. Dunleer, Prefect Press. Many feminists and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender activists criticize the Catholic Church for its policies on issues relating to sexuality, contraception, and abortion. In 1989 members of the ACT UP and WHAM! disrupted a Sunday Mass at Saint Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan to protest the Church's position on homosexuality, abortion, safer sex education, and the use of condoms. One hundred and eleven protesters were arrested outside the Cathedral, and at least one protester inside threw used condoms at a Church altar and desecrated the Eucharist during Mass. Daniel Goldhagen has been accused of attacking Pope Pius XII in a book filled with factual errors. Media coverage of abuse cases Philip Jenkins, an Episcopalian and Professor of History and Religious Studies at Penn State University, published the 1996 book Pedophiles and Priests: Anatomy of a Contemporary Crisis in which he argues that the Catholic Church is being unfairly singled out by secular media which fail to highlight similar sexual scandals in other religious groups, such as the Anglican Communion, various Protestant churches, and the Jewish and Islamic communities. He also states that the Catholic Church may have a lower incidence of molesting priests than Churches that allow married clergy because statistically child molestation generally occurs within families, but Latin-rite Catholic priests do not have families, and the Catholic Church only allows married priests in a few of its rites. He also notes that the term \\"pedophile priests,\\" widely used in the media, implies a distinctly higher rate of child molesters within the Catholic priesthood when in reality the incidence is lower than in most other segments of society\\".Philip Jenkins, Pedophiles and Priests: Anatomy of a Contemporary Crisis (Oxford University Press, 2001). Another recent and pronounced example of this can be seen from mass-media coverage of the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI. On one such occurrence, Episcopalian Tom Ehrich stated that the Catholic Church is \\"uninterested in sex abuse scandals beyond their litigation costs, ... stuck in the 19th century, ... providing safe cover for oppression and intolerance, ... against oppressed peoples, ... homophobic.\\" Tom Enrich (2013) COMMENTARY: Pope Benedict XVI‚Äôs missing mea culpa. Although these are themes which are widely used throughout the Western media, this occasion prompted a public response from Springfield, Illinois, Bishop Thomas J. Paprocki titled \\"Tom Ehrich column promoted religious bigotry\\" wherein the Bishop stated: > Columnists are indeed entitled to their own opinions, but not their own > facts. Ehrich got it wrong in several ways. ...I cannot imagine a secular > newspaper publishing such hostile vitriol against any other religion except > the Catholic church. ...It is untrue and patently malicious to declare that > Roman Catholicism is \\"uninterested in sex abuse scandals beyond their > litigation costs\\". I know of many cases where dioceses have compensated > victims long after their claims were legally barred by the statute of > limitations.Bishop Thomas John Paprocki (2013) Bishop Paprocki: Tom Ehrich > column promoted religious bigotry.

Career Furet far left foreground at the Battle of Trafalgar, by Nicholas Pocock Around 23 June 1802, Furet, under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Demay, sailed on a secret mission from Toulon to Mahon, and return. Furet, with Demay still in command, sailed with Admiral Villeneuve's fleet from Toulon on 29 March 1805 to Martinique. She returned to Europe with the fleet and then participated in both the battles of Finisterre and Trafalgar. Capture After Trafalgar, Furet found herself blockaded in Cadiz. Captain Julien Cosmao decided to sortie from Cadiz on 23 October, in an attempt to retake some of the vessels the British had captured at Trafalgar. He put to sea in company with five ships of-the-line, three French, the 80-gun and , and the 74-gun , and two Spanish, the 100-gun and the 74-gun . Some smaller French ships that had been present at the battle but had not taken part accompanied the ships of the line: the frigates , , , , and , and the brigs Furet and . In preparation for the counter-attack the British cast off several of the prizes and formed a defensive line, allowing the frigates to retake two of the captured prizes, both Spanish ships, the 112-gun and the 80-gun . Of the two recaptured ships, only Santa Ana made it back to Cadiz, when the sortieing ships ran into difficulties in the heavy storm that blew up after the battle. Neptuno ran aground and was destroyed, while a similar fate befell both Indomptable, after she grounded off Rota, and San Francisco de Asis, in Cadiz Bay. Rayo attempted to anchor off San Lucar and ride out the storm, but rolled out her masts in the heavy seas. came up, and being unable to resist, Rayo surrendered to her, but was driven on shore on 26 October and wrecked. Neptune had to be towed back into Cadiz. The survivors, including Furet took refuge at Cadiz, where they remained into February 1806. To try to lure them out, Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood pulled his ships-of-the-line ten leagues out to sea, leaving only the frigate Hydra, under Captain George Mundy, and the brig-sloop in close blockade. On 23 February a strong easterly wind drove the British off their station, which led the French commander, Captain Lameillerie, to seize the opportunity to escape. George Chambers On the evening of 26 February Hydra and Moselle were three leagues west of the Cadiz lighthouse when they sighted the French squadron, comprising the 40-gun frigates Corn√©lie, Rhin, Hortense and Hermione, and Furet. Mundy began firing rockets and alarm guns to alert Collingwood, while sailing parallel to the French squadron. Mundy then sent Carden in Moselle to try to locate the British fleet. On the morning of 27 February Moselle reached Collingwood, who despatched three frigates to try to catch the French. In the meantime, Hydra had managed to isolate Furet from her companions, and after a two-hour chase, captured her. The French frigates did not come to their brig's aid, and after firing a pro forma broadside, Furet surrendered. Furet was armed with eighteen 9-pounder guns, and had a crew of 130 men under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Demay. She was provisioned for a cruise of five months. Under the rules of prize-money, Moselle shared in the proceeds of the capture of Furet. During the next six months, Lamellerie's frigate squadron cruised the Atlantic, visiting Senegal, Cayenne and the West Indies, but failed significantly to disrupt British trade.

Life He was educated at Oxford, and graduated B.A. on 7 April 1565; but on 21 October next year he entered the Society of Jesus at Rome, aged 19. According to Charles Dodd, he was among the Jesuits for many years; but gradually he became estranged from them, and while at Venice, perhaps about 1585, he wrote a book on the society; it does not appear to have been published. It took generally favourable view, but seems to have been subsequently thought by the English government likely to prove damaging. About the same time William Cecil visited Rome; Perkins intervened when his religious opinions created a difficult situation. Perkins is said then to have returned with young Cecil, who recommended him to his grandfather Lord Burghley's favour. Return to England In 1587 he was resident at Prague, being described in the government's list of recusants abroad as a Jesuit. There he became acquainted with Edward Kelley, who in June 1589 accused him of being an emissary of the pope, and of complicity in a plot to murder Queen Elizabeth. Soon afterwards Perkins arrived in England, and seems to have been imprisoned on suspicion. On 12 March 1590 he wrote to Francis Walsingham, undermining Kelley and appealing to a commendation from the King of Poland as proof of his innocence. On 9 May he was granted expenses for a mission to Poland and Prussia. Diplomatic Agent From this time Perkins was frequently employed as a diplomatic agent to Denmark, Poland, Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, and the Hanseatic League; his missions dealt principally with commercial affairs. In 1591 he was ambassador to Denmark, having his first audience with the king on 4 July, and on 22 December received an annuity of one hundred marks for his services. He proceeded to Poland in January 1592, and was in Denmark again in the summer. In June and July 1593 he was negotiating with the Emperor at Prague; in 1595 he visited Elbing, L√ºbeck, and other Hanse towns, and spent some time in Poland. He says he was acceptable to the Poles generally, and the king tried to induce him to enter his service; but (on his own account) the clergy were bitterly hostile, and the Pope offered put a price on his head. In 1598 he was again sent to Denmark, returning on 8 December; in 1600 he was employed in negotiating with the Danish emissaries at Emden. He acted as principal adviser to the government in its mercantile relations with the Baltic countries; on 3 January 1593 he was on a commission to decide without appeal all disputes between the English and subjects of the French king in reference to piracy, and on 3 July was on another to inquire into and punish all abettors of pirates. Numerous Titles He was appointed as Dean of Carlisle in 1595. On 20 February 1597 he was admitted member of Gray's Inn. On 16 Sept. 1597 he was elected M.P. for Ripon, and again on 21 October 1601; he frequently took part in the mercantile business of the House of Commons. On the accession of James I his annuity was increased; in 1603 he was on a commission for suppressing books printed without authority; on 23 July he was knighted by the king at Whitehall, and on 20 March 1605 was admitted commoner of the college of advocates. From 1604 to 1611 he was M.P. for Morpeth; he also acted as deputy to Sir Daniel Donne, master of requests, whom he succeeded in 1617. In 1620 he subscribed to the Virginia Company. He died late in August 1622, and was buried on 1 September on the north side of the long aisle in Westminster Abbey. Family Perkins married, possibly for the second time, on 5 November 1617, at St. Martin's-in- the-Fields, London, Anne, daughter of Anthony Beaumont of Glenfield, Leicestershire, and widow of James Brett of Hoby in the same county. She was sister of the Countess of Buckingham, whose son, George Villiers, became Duke of Buckingham, and mother, by her first husband, of Anne, second wife of Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex. She survived him.

B. Jeyaretnam's death in September 2008. Early life Jeyaretnam was born in 1959 in Singapore. He is the elder child of J. B. Jeyaretnam (sometimes known as \\"JBJ\\") and Margaret Cynthia Walker. His parents met in the United Kingdom in 1950 while studying law at University College London. J. B. Jeyaretnam, a barrister, became one of Singapore's most well-known opposition politicians and democracy advocates and was the first opposition member ever to be elected to Singapore's Parliament in 1981. Margaret Walker was a lawyer originally from England was later one of the first women lawyers in Singapore and Registrar of the Diocese of Singapore and Malaysia. Jeyaretnam was followed by a brother who died at birth, and then by Philip Jeyaretnam who was born in 1964. Education In Singapore, Jeyaretnam attended St Andrew's School, followed by the United World College of South East Asia. He attended Charterhouse School in England from 1975 to 1977. From 1978 to 1980 he returned to Singapore for compulsory military service, officially known as National Service (NS) in Singapore. From 1980 to 1983, he attended Queens' College, Cambridge, where he read economics and graduated with Double First Class Honours. Jeyaretnam is also an alumnus of the Amsterdam Institute of Finance. Early career Upon graduation, Jeyaretnam returned to Singapore where he took up his first employment with Wardley (the merchant banking arm of HSBC in the 1980s), working as an Assistant Manager in the Lending Department. In 1984 Wardley decided to transfer him overseas and he was sent to work in their Hong Kong branch. This move by his employer coincided with the time of his father's second election victory in 1984. Whilst declining to join his father's Workers' Party (WP), he contributed by writing sections of the party's manifesto dealing with economic policy and articles for the party newsletter The Hammer. From 1987 to the early 1990s, Jeyaretnam worked in London and Tokyo for Continental Bank, Banque Indosuez and Lehman Brothers. He then moved to Nomura International in London as head of Japanese warrants and later as proprietary trader. He met his wife-to-be Amanda while working there. They married in 1995 and had a son in 1997. In 1998, Jeyaretnam moved on from the Asian derivatives markets to become a hedge fund manager specialising in event-driven investing. He managed his own fund from 2004 to 2008. During this time in London, he was a member of the Singapore UK Association (SUKA) and later served on the association's committee working with fellow expat Singaporeans. Prominence following J. B. Jeyaretnam's death Kenneth Jeyaretnam lacked prominence in Singapore until the media attention after his father's death. Jeyaretnam's eulogy at his father's funeral was broadcast over YouTube and other new media sites. Subsequently, he arranged a memorial event and exhibition, working closely on the project with his father's supporters and civil rights groups. Joining and leading the Reform Party In 2007, his father J. B. Jeyaretnam formed the Reform Party. The survival of the new opposition party seemed to have been in question when he suffered a heart attack and died on 30 September 2008. With the demise of his father, Jeyaretnam began an active role in Singaporean politics. He started contributing articles on economic themes to the Singaporean online blog, The Online Citizen. He gave his first public \\"political\\" speech alongside other prominent opposition politicians at a memorial event held in memory of his father in Hong Lim Park on New Year's Eve 2008. It was here that Jeyaretnam spoke of his belief that it was possible for Singapore to have both prosperity and liberty. During this period he also started working with prominent non- partisan groups in their campaign to have a chair elected in his father's name and in establishing a foundation for study which will sponsor Singaporean students in human rights law and politics. On 10 April 2009 it was announced in The Straits Times and other sources that Kenneth Jeyaretnam had joined the Reform Party. Eugene Tan, a law lecturer at Singapore Management University, was quoted as saying: \\"Mr Jeyaretnam has given the Reform Party a tremendous boost given his academic achievements, professional background and political pedigree\\". Before long, Jeyaretnam was co-opted into the party's Central Executive Committee (CEC) and voted into the vacant position of secretary- general. Privatization policies Jeyaretnam in a February 2010 statement available on the Reform Party's website indicated that \\"The Reform Party would go much further though in dismantling or privatizing the whole GLC (Government-linked companies) structure starting with the privatization of GIC (Government of Singapore Investment Corporation) and Temasek (Temasek Holdings) and giving Singaporean citizens a direct stake, whether through shares, deferred shares or quasi-equity, in their assets. We would seek to sell off or break-up most of the GLCs which control such a substantial portion of economic activity (up to 60% according to some estimates) which has in our view a detrimental effect on the growth of a vibrant private sector in Singapore.\\" Election rally speeches Speakers' Corner, Hong Lim Park on 15 January 2011 In his maiden election speech in late April 2011, Kenneth Jeyaretnam said the objective of the Reform Party is to win a few seats in the May 2011 general election, adding that competition in politics will lead to better and more intelligent policies. He also sounded a warning that the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) will likely open the floodgates to more foreigners to enter Singapore again once they form the government. \\"Already you can see that. The Reform Party was the first to talk about how the government's track record was hollow. They always talk about the high rate of economic growth, but the economic growth is created just by bringing in cheap foreign labour. It is not created by raising the incomes of Singaporeans,\\" he said. Jeyaretnam criticised the PAP for failing to improve the lives of ordinary Singaporeans as their median incomes have remained stagnant over the last few years. Return Our CPF protest Jeyaretnam participated as a speaker during the \\"Return Our CPF\\" protest in 2014 at Hong Lim Park..

It has crowded pseudobulbs, tough, dark green leaves and up to four small whitish to yellowish flowers with an orange labellum. Description Bulbophyllum argyropus is an epiphytic, rarely an lithophytic herb with crowded, warty and furrowed pseudobulbs long and wide. Young pseudobulbs are covered with papery white bracts. There is a single tough, dark green leaf, long and wide on each pseudobulb. Up to five whitish or yellowish flowers long and about wide are arranged on a warty, thread-like flowering stem long. The sepals are about long and wide, the lateral sepals are long, the petals about long and wide. The labellum is orange, about long and wide curved and fleshy. Flowering occurs between August and December. Taxonomy and naming The silver strand orchid was first formally described in 1833 by Stephan Endlicher who gave it the name Thelychiton argyropus and published the description in Prodromus Florae Norfolkicae. In 1876, Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach changed the name to Bulbophyllum argyropus. The specific epithet (argyropus) is derived from the Ancient Greek words argyros meaning \\"silver\\" and pous meaning \\"foot\\". Distribution and habitat Bulbophyllum argyropus usually grows on the highest branches of rainforest trees, rarely on rocks. It occurs between the McPherson Range in Queensland and the Dorrigo Plateau in New South Wales as well as on Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands. It has also been reported from New Caledonia.

It has coarse, creeping rhizomes, curved, yellowish pseudobulbs with a single thick, fleshy leaf, and a single cream-coloured flower with yellow, red or purple spots. It grows on trees and rocks in open forest, often in exposed places. Description Bulbophyllum baileyi is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb that forms spreading clumps. It has a creeping rhizome covered with brown bracts and curved, yellowish pseudobulbs long and wide. There is a single oblong or egg-shaped, thick, fleshy light-coloured leaf long and wide on the end of the pseudobulb. A single upward-facing, cream-coloured to creamy yellow flower with red or purple spots, long and wide is borne on a flowering stem long. The sepals and petals curve inwards. The dorsal sepal is narrow triangular, long and wide and the lateral sepals are a similar length but wide. The petals are long and wide. The labellum is fleshy, curved, long and about wide with tiny spots. Flowering mainly occurs between October and February. Taxonomy and naming Bulbophyllum baileyi was first formally described in 1875 by Ferdinand von Mueller. The description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from a specimen collected by Frederick Manson Bailey growing on the trunk of Casuarina equisetifolia near Rockingham Bay. The specific epithet (baileyi) honours Manson Bailey who collected the type specimen. Distribution and habitat The fruit fly orchid grows on trees, rocks and cliff faces in mangroves, rainforest and open forest. It is found in New Guinea, some Torres Strait Islands and the Cape York Peninsula as far south as Townsville. Ecology The flowers of B. baileyi are pollinated by male fruit flies of the genus Bactrocera which are attracted to them by their \\"fruity\\" fragrance. It has been suggested that the flies are seeking zingerone which they use as a sexual attractant. The labellum of the flower is delicately hinged and when the insect lands on it, is tipped into the column and either has sticky pollinia attached to its back or deposits the pollinia on the receptive stigma.

Published in London in 1781, An Essay on the Right of Property in Land was issued anonymously, necessarily it seems in a revolutionary age. As with John Locke,Are you a real libertarian, or a royal libertarian ‚Äô'Furthermore, Locke based his scenario on pre-monetary societies, where a landholder would find that \\"it was useless, as well as dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed.\\" With the introduction of money, Locke noted, all land quickly became appropriated. Why? Because with money, those who can take more land than they have personal use for suddenly have reason to do so, as between them they will have taken all the land, and others will have to pay rent to them. So, with the introduction of money, the Lockean rationale for landed property falls apart, even according to Locke. And while Locke did not propose a remedy specifically for to this problem, he repeatedly stated that all taxes should be on real estate.'‚Äô John Stuart Mill, \\"The ordinary progress of a society which increases in wealth, is at all times tending to augment the incomes of landlords; to give them both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community, independently of any trouble or outlay incurred by themselves. They grow richer, as it were in their sleep, without working, risking, or economizing. What claim have they, on the general principle of social justice, to this accession of riches? In what would they have been wronged if society had, from the beginning, reserved the right of taxing the spontaneous increase of rent, to the highest amount required by financial exigencies?\\" Thomas Paine,'Agrarian Justice', 1797, paragraph 12: ‚Äô'Every proprietor, therefore, of cultivated lands, owes to the community a ground- rent (for I know of no better term to express the idea) for the land which he holds; and it is from this ground-rent that the fund proposed in this plan is to issue.'‚Äô Adam Smith and others‚ÄîOgilvie is seen as a leading proto-Georgist thinker. His masterwork was republished in 1838, then in 1891 (reprinted 1970) as the heart and subject of a much larger new work titled Birthright in Land, and in more recent years has been republished twice in modern, further expanded editions, using that same title.Ogilvie 1997. Ogilvie is cited as an influence by reformers internationally.http://www.wealthandwant.com/docs/Ogilvie_Essay_1782.html The principal authority and main published source of informationsee also Ritchie in ODNB, 2004 (whose principal source is also DC MacDonald). on William Ogilvie and his life is his 19th-century biographer DC MacDonald, who says: > The facts known about Ogilvie‚Äôs life are exceedingly scanty, and themselves > be of little importance; but when considered along with the conception we > form of the man as displayed on every page of his book, the smallest scrap > of authentic information will in these days be of some interest, not only to > ‚Äúmen of enlarged and inquisitive minds‚Äù, but also to readers in general. It > is in the book, however, and in the book alone, that we meet face to face > with the author. Ogilvie instilled his soul into it, and he left us evidence > that it was the chief aim of his life. We, therefore, should as soon think > of separating the man Isaiah from the Book of Isaiah, as we separating the > man Ogilvie from the book of Ogilvie.DC MacDonald's Biographical Notes, in > Ogilvie 1997. Life Born in 1736, William Ogilvie was the only son of James Ogilvie of Pittensear, Morayshire, and of Marjory Steuart of Tannachy in the neighbouring county of Banff. \\"A born and bred patrician\\", he was lineally descended from Gillecrist, the last Maor Mor of Angus, one of the seven provinces of Pictish Scotland. \\"By birth and lineage an anti-Whig, and, as a man, he must have despised the wirepulling Scotch Whigs of his time as 'but a pack o' traitor louns'\\".DC MacDonald's Biographical Notes (quoting Robert Burns' \\"'Awa' Whigs, Awa'\\"), in Ogilvie 1997. There is no authentic account of Ogilvie's boyhood, according to his biographer, who assumes that until he left home for College he was brought up in the diminutive mansion-house of Pittensear and attended the Grammar School in Elgin, the county town and cathedral city away. One dramatic incident in his childhood may have been defining: > When the so-called Royal Army was passing through Morayshire in 1746 > 'Butcher' Cumberland's government troops on their way to the Battle of > Culloden, a short halt was made at Pittensear House, and three cannon shots > were fired at it. One of these shots struck the front wall close to the > dining-room window, and, we need not say, caused the inmates much alarm. > William Ogilvie, then about ten years of age, in all probability witnessed > that scene‚Äîa sad example of what even a Whig Government may do at the head > of a mercenary army. He, without any doubt, surveyed the wreck after the > storm had passed. We have it on the authority of old people still living > near Pittensear, that his mother, who happened to be in childbed at the > time, never recovered the shock of that day's proceedings, and that shortly > thereafter she was laid in a premature grave. And a few years later, when > his disconsolate and broken-hearted father had quitted life's stage, he was > left alone, in place of both father and mother, as guardian to four orphan > girls. Here we may trace the way in which, what we may call a motherly > feeling towards all the children of men, was developed in his breast. In 1755, at the age of nineteen, Ogilvie entered King's College, Aberdeen. On graduating in 1759 he was appointed Master of the Grammar School at Cullen, Morayshire‚Äîremaining there a year. He then attended Glasgow University in the winter session of 1760‚Äì61 and Edinburgh University the following winter. While he was at Glasgow, studying under Dr. Joseph Black, the engineer inventor James Watt was demonstrating his scientific discoveries at the University and Adam Smith occupied the Chair of Moral Philosophy. MacDonald says that between 1759 and 1762 Ogilvie was travelling tutor and companion to Alexander, 4th Duke of Gordon‚Äî\\"during which time he probably found himself in the company of Adam Smith as travelling tutor and companion to Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch.\\" But Ritchie points out that the period of travel \\"coincided with the commencement of Ogilvie's teaching duties and [Gordon] is known to have taken another tutor\\"Ritchie in ODNB, 2004. Ogilvie on 'Grand Tour' would have had good opportunity to survey the broad continent of Europe and witness the condition of its people: his reformer eye would not have missed those circumstances and conditions that were to lead to the French Revolution: > The widow is gathering nettles for her children's dinner; a perfumed > seigneur, delicately lounging in the ≈íil de B≈ìuf, hath an alchemy whereby he > will extract from her the third nettle, and call it rent.MacDonald (1970, > p.162) identifies his source (and quotes it in-text) incorrectly, viz.: > \\"Carlyle's Past and Present, inspired by Byron, see Age of Bronze XIV.

The French Revolution ‚Äî a history. Copyright edition. London: Chapman > and Hall. p.178. In 1761 Ogilvie was appointed Assistant Professor of Philosophy in King's College, Aberdeen, and Regent\\"(A regent, from the Latin regens \\"reigning\\", is a person selected to act as head of state).... [but] [o]ccasionally, the term regent refers to positions lower than the ruler of a country.... [including] a management board for a college or university; this is commonly stated as: 'Board of Regents'\\" Wikipedia. in 1764. The following year he exchanged offices with the Professor of Humanity, which class he taught until he retired in 1817. Ogilvie appears to have lived a somewhat reclusive life, remaining unmarried and childless. He is buried in the south transept of St Machar's Cathedral in Old Aberdeen, adjacent to his college: a discreet stone in the wall describes him as \\"William Ogilvie, Esquire of Pittensear, in the County of Moray, and Professor of Humanity in the University and King‚Äôs College, Aberdeen, who died on the 14th February 1819, aged 83 years\\".Kirkyard of St Machar‚Äôs Cathedral, visited and inscription read by Peter Gibb, August 1997. His Times obituary called him \\"one of the most accomplished scholars of the age\\".The Times, 23 February 1819. The Book of Ogilvie‚ÄîBirthright in Land leftThe declared object of An Essay on the Right of Property in Land, according to its original title and introduction, is to show how \\"property in land might be rendered more beneficial to the lower ranks of mankind\\". Due to what MacDonald calls the 'boycotting' of Ogilvie and his masterwork by the establishment, \\"the lower ranks of mankind in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and the British Colonies never heard that such a man lived, far less that he left them such a legacy\\". In his preface to the 1891 edition of Ogilvie's book, DC MacDonald elucidates Ogilvie's core message: > When a child is born, we recognise that it has a natural right to its > mother‚Äôs milk, and no one can deny that it has the same right to mother- > earth. It is really its mother-earth, plus the dew and sunshine from heaven > and a little labour, that supplies the milk and everything else required for > its subsistence. The monster that would deprive a babe of its mother‚Äôs milk, > or would monopolise the breasts of several mothers, to the exclusion of > several children, is not more deserving of being destroyed than the monster > who seizes absolute possession of more than his share of the common mother > of mankind, to the exclusion of his fellow-creatures.DC MacDonald's Preface, > in Ogilvie 1997. In his Essay Ogilvie claims the birthright of every citizen to an equal share in the value of property in land, and outlines the practical policy means by which this would progressively be achieved. He asserts \\"land values as having three parts, the original, the improved, and the improvable values; the first and third of these [belong] to the community and only the second to the landholder\\". Fillebrown provides a considered critical analysis of Ogilvie's proposal: \\"The crux of the land problem, according to Ogilvie's analysis, lies in the reconciliation\\" of the conflict between \\"the claims to an equal share of land, involving right of occupancy, and the claim to more than an equal share, based on labour.... 'Rude nations have adhered to the first of these maxims, neglecting the second. Nations advanced in industry and arts have adhered to the second, neglecting the first.'\\" > To establish a just combination of these two maxims, at the original > foundation of states, so as to render it a fundamental part of their frame > and constitution, or to introduce it afterwards, with as little violence as > may be, to the actual possessions and supposed rights and interests of > various orders of men, ought to be the object of all agrarian laws ; and > this object being once distinctly conceived, if wise and benevolent men will > turn their attention towards it, no doubt need be entertained that very > practicable methods of carrying it into execution will in time be > discovered, by comparison of projects, or from the result of trials.Ogilvie > 1781. Ogilvie set out a prototype of the economic policy known as land value taxation, or, as his modern editors style it, community ground rent.'The global Green tax? Community Ground Rent', by Peter Gibb, Afterword, in Ogilvie 1997. However his analysis and proposal are incomplete, says Fillebrown: > \\"His enumeration of the moral benefits to accrue to mankind from a > realisation of his fiscal ideal is a brilliant prognostication that no later > and greater economic light has sufficed to dim. But Ogilvie's failure to > grasp the full significance of economic rent, especially urban rent, as a > social product, and the stress laid by him on his proposed agrarian law, a > plan devoted to a now admittedly impossible mechanical allotment of land; > are responsible for his being relegated from the Authorities to the Appendix > [ie. by Fillebrown from the body of his book to its appendix].Fillebrown > 1917, p. 257. thumbMacDonald describes Ogilvie's Essay as \\"a pastoral prose poem, through which we can realise this beautiful world, with its ample provision for satisfying man's instinctive and rational faculties of enjoyment.\\" Ogilvie wrote his revolutionary masterwork between 1776 (the US declaration of independence) and 1781‚Äîeight years before the storming of the Bastille. He presented the work as a warning to the \\"friends of mankind\\", he being \\"well aware that great changes suddenly accomplished are always pregnant with danger\\".Ogilvie's Essay, in Ogilvie 1997. Despite his so-called 'boycotting', Ogilvie and his work does appear to have had contemporary influence. A copy of his Essay, marked \\"with the author's compliments\\", was found in the repositories of the modernising Frederick the Great; and Ogilvie was involved in the land tenure reforms carried out by Lord Cornwallis in lower Bengal in 1793. Ogilvie's work was praised by Fillebrown as \\"a notable contribution to economic literature, a product of original and independent thinking\\".Fillebrown 1917, p. 249. The ideas it contains were to be taken up and developed a hundred years later by the American social reformer Henry George and definitively presented in own masterpiece, the economics best- seller Progress and Poverty. Thus would Ogilvie's Enlightenment insights be turned into a significant 19th century social and political movement, and become a philosophy that would in turn inspire and inform the modern land reform.http://www.tlio.org.uk/pubs/LE2_ltax.html Retrieved 16-08-09.http://www.caledonia.org.uk/land/iglehart.htm Retrieved 16-08-09.Beer 2001 (1920). \\"The modern land reform movement originated in the last quarter of the eighteenth century, in Great Britain. Its aims and ends are different from those of the Peasants' War (1381, 1449, 1549) and the Diggers (1649), for, while these fought either for a restoration of the village community or the establishment of a communism, it advocates a compromise between communism and private property, with a view to increase the number of farmers and, generally, to improve the condition of the labouring population. The pioneers are Thomas Spence (1750‚Äì1814), William Ogilvie (1736‚Äì1813(sic)), and, to some extent, Thomas Paine (1737‚Äì1809). They all argue from the natural law doctrines, according to which the earth and the fulness thereof were, in the original state of society, or the state of nature, the common property of mankind, so that every child born into the world had ipso facto an inalienable right to an equal share in the common inheritance.\\" p. v. and Green movements.'The fundamental political measure ‚Äì Community Ground Rent', by Peter Gibb, Reforesting Scotland, issue 16, spring 1997. MacDonald delivers a closing paean on Ogilvie's work: > His Essay on the Right of Property in Land, in every line of it, says: > suffer little children to come unto me, and I shall teach them that God is > no respecter of persons; that all the children of men are entitled > indiscriminately to an equal share in the soil, in all wild animals, game, > fish, and the whole products of nature, necessary for man‚Äôs subsistence or > enjoyment; and that anything contrary to this doctrine is a gross and > blasphemous slander on the Creator, as well as a most iniquitous fraud on > the bulk of mankind. Friend of Robert Burns Ogilvie‚Äôs biographer makes a sustained and compelling argument‚Äîpresenting circumstantial but no concrete evidence‚Äîthat Ogilvie was personally acquainted with his compatriot Robert Burns. He appealingly places the two men side by side: > Both were lovers of mankind, and there was a very strong mental affinity > between them. Ogilvie was known as ‚Äúthe gentleman an‚Äô scholar‚Äù, but never > (except within a very limited circle) as a Land Law Reformer. This is a > regretful circumstance. It is equally regretful that Burns is more known as > ‚Äúa rhyming, ranting, roving billie‚Äù than as a pioneer and great thinker, in > regard to reforms for the benefit of mankind‚Ä¶. Ogilvie and Burns saw eye to > eye; but while Burns roused up his fellow-men from the gutter of serfdom, > Ogilvie reasoned with them as to the causes which brought them to such a low > condition, and also as to the means of reclaiming their natural rights. > Ogilvie considered the whole question from a magnanimous, impartial, and > truly scientific point of view. He pleaded for ‚Äúfree inquiry‚Äù; he sought > after truth; he was not one of those rough-and-ready reformers who would > simply say, ‚ÄúAbolish landlordism and all evils will vanish‚Äù. No. He looked > upon modern landlordism not as a cause but as an effect. The primary and > fundamental cause of all the evils under which humanity suffers is traced by > him to man‚Äôs want of knowledge; and landlordism, with all its consequent > evils, under which humanity groans, according to him, is directly owing to > man‚Äôs ignorance of his natural rights. It is this ignorance which begets > slavish submission and breeds oppression. Ogilvie considered the situation > logically. In his view ignorant humanity must neglect its rights, and > without its rights cannot perform its duties. Rights and duties are co- > relative. Ogilvie recognised this very old maxim of Natural Law. Landowner Ogilvie came from a family of agricultural improvers. A gentleman farmer and landlord, he managed in-hand a good portion of his inherited lands of Pittensear until 1772, when, apparently for family reasons, he sold the property to the Earl of Fife (reserving a lease on the mansion house and manor farm, which he retained \\"to the last parting pang\\"). In 1773 Ogilvie purchased the property of Oldfold and Stonegavel, on Deeside, about outside Aberdeen. In 1808, after thirty-five years of agricultural improvement, having borrowed ¬£2000 from the Duke of Gordon for draining, trenching, blasting and legal fees, he sold it again. > \\"In the year 1802 we find him carrying through a Process in the Court of > Teinds, by which he saved the property from being plundered by increased > tithes on the increased value arising from his improvements. He got the > tithes valued according to the old rental.\\" Although an academic intellectual, Ogilvie appears to have been a practical man: his management of his landed property benefited from his profound theoretical insights; while his theoretical knowledge was bolstered by his hands-on practical experience on the land. Antiquarian and collector Ritchie says \\"Ogilvie enthralled his students with the outstanding quality of his translations of classical writers, especially Virgil and Horace, although these were never published\\", and that \\"his scholarship extended to natural history and the fine arts\\". Ogilvie was a keen antiquary, medallist, numismatist and collector‚Äîof natural specimens and of rare prints, mainly portraits.DC MacDonald's Biographical Notes, in Ogilvie 1891.

Educational reformer During his tenure at Aberdeen Ogilvie was an active educational reformer, helping to sweep aside \\"a gavelkind system of distributing University honours\\". \\"Ogilvie's clarity of thought, freedom from preconceptions, and disinterested motives inevitably brought him into conflict with colleagues in King's College\\".Ritchie, in ODNB, 2004. Professor Ogilvie held the modern view that Universities were public institutions, and professors public servants (with regard to teaching) and trustees for the public (with regard to endowments, buildings, libraries, etc). The 18th century Masters of King‚Äôs College collectively were of a different view. MacDonald records that during Ogilvie‚Äôs time as a member of King‚Äôs College > his colleagues not only alienated some of the lands belonging to the > College, but they misapplied and ‚Äòmisappropriated‚Äô College funds. They also > disposed of the patronage of no less than fifteen churches, and, worse > still, the right of presentation to twenty bursaries. The great landlords > were the purchasers of these saleable commodities, and in this way they > became the private owners of rights and duties which, until then, were held > by the Professors in trust for the public. The money received for Church > patronage has been accounted for, but the price of the other articles of > commerce was appropriated by the Masters as their own private property. It > became 'money in their purse'. Ogilvie protested and sought reform: > For upwards of half-a-century Prof. Ogilvie was perhaps the most energetic > member of Senatus, his decidedly progressive views bringing him not > infrequently into conflict with his more conservative colleagues. The pages > of the College Minutes during his incumbency bristle with protests against, > and reasons of dissent from, the decision of the majority.Note by Mr P J > Anderson, Secretary to the New Spalding Club, in 'Scottish Notes and Queries > for June 1889', cited in DC MacDonald's Biographical Notes, in Ogilvie 1997. A contemporary printed paper titled 'Outlines of a Plan for Uniting the King‚Äôs and Marischal Universities of Aberdeen, With a View to Render the System of Education More Complete' is believed to have been authored by Ogilvie.WR Humphries, 'William Ogilvie and the projected union of the colleges, 1786‚Äì1787', 1940, cited by Ritchie in ODNB, 2004. Its reform proposals were rejected by his own College, with seven out of Ogilvie‚Äôs ten Professor colleagues opposing it‚Äîthe \\"seven wise Masters\\" as they became known. It was not until 1860 finally that the 1786 plans were implemented. In 1764 Ogilvie‚Äôs name is connected with a scheme for a Public Library in Aberdeen. This, like educational reform, was another grand public project that would remain unrealised in his lifetime (but since achieved). His greatest, radical yet practical proposition for the public good‚Äîthe equitable sharing of nature's bounty among all citizens‚Äîremains unfulfilled.

Kostant used it to rewrite the Weyl character formula as a formula (the Kostant multiplicity formula) for the multiplicity of a weight of an irreducible representation of a semisimple Lie algebra. An alternative formula, that is more computationally efficient in some cases, is Freudenthal's formula. The Kostant partition function can also be defined for Kac‚ÄìMoody algebras and has similar properties. An example The Kostant partition function for the A2 root system Consider the A2 root systems, with positive roots \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, and \\\\alpha_3:=\\\\alpha_1+\\\\alpha_2. If an element \\\\mu can be expressed as a non- negative integer linear combination of \\\\alpha_1, \\\\alpha_2, and \\\\alpha_3, then since \\\\alpha_3=\\\\alpha_1+\\\\alpha_2, it can also be expressed as a non-negative integer linear combination of \\\\alpha_1 and \\\\alpha_2: :\\\\mu=n_1\\\\alpha_1+n_2\\\\alpha_2 with n_1 and n_2 being non-negative integers. This expression gives one way to write \\\\mu as a non-negative integer combination of positive roots; other expressions can be obtained by replacing \\\\alpha_1+\\\\alpha_2 with \\\\alpha_3 some number of times. We can do the replacement k times, where 0\\\\leq k\\\\leq\\\\mathrm{min}(n_1,n_2). Thus, if the Kostant partition function is denoted by p, we obtain the formula :p(n_1\\\\alpha_1+n_2\\\\alpha_2)=1+\\\\mathrm{min}(n_1,n_2). This result is shown graphically in the image at right. If an element \\\\mu is not of the form \\\\mu=n_1\\\\alpha_1+n_2\\\\alpha_2, then p(\\\\mu)=0. Relation to the Weyl character formula Inverting the Weyl denominator For each root \\\\alpha and each H\\\\in\\\\mathfrak{h}, we can formally apply the formula for the sum of a geometric series to obtain :\\\\frac{1}{1-e^{-\\\\alpha(H)}}=1+e^{-\\\\alpha(H)}+e^{-2\\\\alpha(H)}+\\\\cdots where we do not worry about convergence‚Äîthat is, the equality is understood at the level of formal power series. Using Weyl's denominator formula :{\\\\sum_{w\\\\in W} (-1)^{\\\\ell(w)}e^{w\\\\cdot\\\\rho(H)} = e^{\\\\rho(H)}\\\\prod_{\\\\alpha>0}(1-e^{-\\\\alpha(H)})}, we obtain a formal expression for the reciprocal of the Weyl denominator: Proposition 10.27 :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sum_{w\\\\in W} (-1)^{\\\\ell(w)}e^{w\\\\cdot\\\\rho(H)}}&{}=e^{-\\\\rho(H)}\\\\prod_{\\\\alpha>0}(1+e^{-\\\\alpha(H)}+e^{-2\\\\alpha(H)}+e^{-3\\\\alpha(H)}+\\\\cdots) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &{}=e^{-\\\\rho(H)}\\\\sum_{\\\\mu}p(\\\\mu)e^{-\\\\mu(H)} \\\\end{align} Here, the first equality is by taking a product over the positive roots of the geometric series formula and the second equality is by counting all the ways a given exponential e^{\\\\mu(H)} can occur in the product. Rewriting the character formula This argument shows that we can convert the Weyl character formula for the irreducible representation with highest weight \\\\lambda: :\\\\operatorname{ch}(V)={\\\\sum_{w\\\\in W} (-1)^{\\\\ell(w)}e^{w\\\\cdot(\\\\lambda+\\\\rho)(H)} \\\\over \\\\sum_{w\\\\in W} (-1)^{\\\\ell(w)}e^{w\\\\cdot\\\\rho(H)}} from a quotient to a product: :\\\\operatorname{ch}(V)=\\\\left(\\\\sum_{w\\\\in W} (-1)^{\\\\ell(w)}e^{w\\\\cdot(\\\\lambda+\\\\rho)(H)}\\\\right) \\\\left(e^{-\\\\rho(H)}\\\\sum_{\\\\mu}p(\\\\mu)e^{-\\\\mu(H)}\\\\right) . The multiplicity formula Using the preceding rewriting of the character formula, it is relatively easy to write the character as a sum of exponentials. The coefficients of these exponentials are the multiplicities of the corresponding weights. We thus obtain a formula for the multiplicity of a given weight \\\\mu in the irreducible representation with highest weight \\\\lambda: Theorem 10.29 :\\\\mathrm{mult}(\\\\mu)=\\\\sum_{w\\\\in W}(-1)^{\\\\ell(w)}p(w\\\\cdot(\\\\lambda+\\\\rho)-(\\\\mu+\\\\rho)). This result is the Kostant multiplicity formula. The dominant term in this formula is the term w=1; the contribution of this term is p(\\\\lambda-\\\\mu), which is just the multiplicity of \\\\mu in the Verma module with highest weight \\\\lambda. If \\\\lambda is sufficiently far inside the fundamental Weyl chamber and \\\\mu is sufficiently close to \\\\lambda, it may happen that all other terms in the formula are zero. Specifically, unless w\\\\cdot(\\\\lambda+\\\\rho) is higher than \\\\mu+\\\\rho, the value of the Kostant partition function on w\\\\cdot(\\\\lambda+\\\\rho)-(\\\\mu+\\\\rho) will be zero. Thus, although the sum is nominally over the whole Weyl group, in most cases, the number of nonzero terms is smaller than the order of the Weyl group. References Sources  Humphreys, J.E.

It was published (usually monthly) beginning in October 1964 by the homophile activist group the Janus Society as a continuation of the group's monthly newsletter. Edited by Clark Polak, the president of the Janus Society, the magazine represented Polak's radical approach to the homophile movement by emphasizing sexual liberation when other homophile organizations were focused on assimilating with straight society.  Title  The magazine's title was inspired by a quote from Walden by Henry David Thoreau that appeared in every edition: \\"If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears the beat of a different drummer.\\"  Content  Drum was published most months between October 1964 and November 1966, but after issue number 21 the magazine was published sporadically for another 10 issues until January 1969.Stein, Marc (2000). City of Sisterly and Brotherly Loves : Lesbian and Gay Philadelphia, 1945-1972. University of Chicago Press. p. 283. .LCCN 68006149 The magazine's exclusive coverage of gay men's issues was controversial within the Janus Society because the group focused on all LGB issues.Stein, p. 232-234 The magazine was the most popular homophile magazine in the country, with a circulation of 10,000 by 1966, far surpassing similar homophile magazines ONE and The Ladder. Drum's success came from its bold portrayal of gay sex and culture in erotica, fiction, and humor. The magazine maintained a clipping service to identify news coverage of gay issues from across the country which were often reprinted in Drum.Streitmatter, p. 66 Polak wanted to ‚Äúput the 'sex' back in homosexuality,‚Äù and the magazine was the first in the country to publish full frontal male nudity in 1965. However, copies of the magazine sold at newsstands never featured nudity and only subscribers received copies with a centerfold-style insert of additional pages.Stein, p. 240 A Life magazine expose titled ‚ÄúHomosexuality in America‚Äù in 1964 inspired a parody article in Drum, ‚ÄúHeterosexuality in America,‚Äù written by ‚ÄúP. Arody‚Äù that jokingly treated heterosexuality as a deviation that exists in all walks of life across the country.Streitmatter, p. 71 Drum began the first gay comic strip, Harry Chess: The Man from A.U.N.T.I.E by A. Jay (Al Shapiro), which featured Harry Chess and his sidekick Mickey Muscle as top secret agents working for Agents Undercover Network to Investigate Evil, a spoof on comic strips from the time and The Man from U.N.C.L.E.Stein, p. 234 The comic was discontinued in 1966 but reappeared in gay magazines Queen‚Äôs Quarterly and Drummer.  Demise  In March 1967, Polak was arrested when his home was raided by the police and over 75,000 gay books, photos, and magazines were seized. Polak was indicted by a grand jury, however, a judge threw out the case because one of the warrants was filled out incorrectly. In February 1969, Polak was arrested for a second time for distributing obscene materials and operating a peep show at one of his adult bookstores. In April 1969, Polak was found guilty and sentenced to two years in prison which was reduced to two months. Polak sent a letter to Drum‚Äôs subscribers in May explaining that the previous January issue was the magazine's last.Stein, p. 283-284 After two additional arrests, Polak was found guilty by two federal grand juries in 1969 and 1970. Polak moved to Los Angeles in 1970 and in 1972 pleaded no contest to the charges of mailing obscene publications and was sentenced to five years probation contingent on giving up his pornography businesses in Philadelphia. The Janus Society succeeded Drum with another magazine, PACE!, named from the same Thoreau quote, it covered lesbian and gay issues but only ran for two issues.Stein, p. 300-301 Notes References * Gross, Larry (2001).

Career Argus was a Vigilant-class brig, designated No. 3 in 1799, of a six-vessel class. She was launched 1800, but not commissioned until 1802. She was at the battle of Trafalgar, but did not engage in combat. On 23 October 1805, French Captain Julien Cosmao made a sortie from Cadiz with some of the more seaworthy ships that had escaped the battle, in an attempt to retake some of the captured prizes. Argus was among the sortieing vessels. A storm came up that wrecked many vessels and forced the remains of the French fleet back to Cadiz. There, the Spanish seized a number of them after Spain entered the war against France in 1808. However, Argus was not among the seized vessels. Argus left Cayenne on 15 March 1806, provisioned for a cruise of four months and in company with the French brig Observateur. Argus was eager to escape and abandoned Observateur, which, however, was able to hold off her attacker.Barrey (1907), p.54. Still, the British captured Observateur on 9 June. Argus fought off Cayenne on 27 January 1807 at the side of Favorite. The British report from the engagement states that Argus was armed with fourteen brass 8-pounder guns, which were the equivalent of English 9-pounders, and had a crew of 120 men. Argus was condemned and ordered broken up at Cayenne on 31 March 1807. She was decommissioned on 21 April and then broken up. Citations and references ;Citations ;References *Barrey, Ph.

It is an account of her stay at the Ursuline Convent in Charlestown, Massachusetts in 1832. The account was primarily written before, and published after, the 1834 Ursuline Convent riots, in which the facility was destroyed by rioting Protestants, and may have played a role in inspiring those riots. Reed was a witness at trials involving accused participants in the rioting. Summary Rebecca Reed was a young Episcopalian woman from Boston who had attended the school operated by the Ursulines in 1831 as a charity scholar: a day student for whom the convent waived tuition fees. In 1832, she declared her intent to enter the Ursuline novitiate, but left the convent after six months as a postulant (originally one who makes a request or demand, hence a candidate). In the memoir, Reed described the convent as a prison, where young girls were forced into Roman Catholicism, with grotesque punishment for those who refused. This book, along with a growing number of propaganda magazines including the Christian Watchman and Boston Recorder, stoked the fires of anti-Catholicism in Boston and the surrounding area.Barnes and Noble review Circulation prior to publication and riots Although not published until 1835, some versions of the manuscript apparently circulated among the primarily Protestant student community, and versions of it may have gained wider circulation in Charlestown. Some authors, including a former student at the school, have speculated that discussion of the manuscript may have contributed to the anti-Catholic sentiment which incited riots.Franchot, 145, citing Whitney, 53. Reed's claims were alleged by the Ursulines to inspire riots that burned the convent. Reed's narrative, released one year after the rioters were tried, sold 200,000 copies in one month. A response to its allegations was published by Mother Superior Mary St. George.An answer to Six months in a convent, exposing its falsehoods and manifold absurdities Maria Monk Reed's book was soon followed by another bestselling supposed expos√©, Awful Disclosures of the Hotel-Dieu Nunnery, (1836) in which Maria Monk claimed that a convent in Montreal served as a harem for Catholic priests, and that any resulting children were murdered after baptism. The tale of Maria Monk was, in fact, clearly modeled on the Gothic novels popular in the early 19th century. This literary genre had already been used for anti-Catholic sentiments in works such as Matthew Lewis's The Monk.

Herrick (born October 6, 1954) is an American academic. He is the Guy Vanderjagt Professor of Communication and former communication chair at Hope College. Herrick‚Äôs research interests include rhetoric and argumentation, new religious movements, technology and spirituality, and the discourse of futurism.http://www.hope.edu/academic/communication/faculty/herrick.htm His early books are guides to the discipline of scholarly argumentation that discuss both traditional rhetorical techniques and contemporary applications for students and academics. He has written extensively on the history of rhetoric, from the theories of the ancient Greeks to modern Western thought, and more specifically on the revolutionary rhetorical practices of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English Deists. Herrick‚Äôs research also deals with the birth of ‚Äúsynthesized‚Äù religions that differ from traditional Christian doctrine. He has worked on the intersection of science and religion, and particularly on the new forms of spirituality that have risen in an increasingly technological age. Most recently, he collaborated with Michael Hyde to co-edit After the Genome: A Language for our Biotechnological Future (2013), an award-winning volume of essays that examines the ways in which language and rhetoric inform people‚Äôs understanding of biotechnology. Early life and education Herrick was raised in a household in which argument‚Äîintellectual debate, rather than heated dispute‚Äîwas highly valued. He cites this upbringing as the source of his interest in rhetoric.http://www.hope.edu/academic/communication/faculty/herrick/three.pdf He graduated Magna cum Laude from California State University, Fresno in 1976. He then received his MA from the University of California, Davis in 1979. His PhD was granted by the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1984.http://www.hope.edu/academic/communication/faculty/herrick/Vita- Herrick.pdf Career Herrick has taught at Hope College since earning his PhD in 1984. His courses have included Analytic Skills in Communication, Rhetoric and Public Culture, Biotechnology and Human Enhancement, and Rhetorical and Communication Theory.http://www.hope.edu/academic/communication/faculty/herrick.htm He also taught at LCC International University in Klaipeda, Lithuania during the spring semester of 2004.http://www.hope.edu/academic/communication/faculty/herrick/Vita- Herrick.pdf Religious Beliefs and Academic Philosophy Herrick is interested in the relationship between Christianity and rhetoric, and sees argumentation as the basis of Christian culture. In his view, this philosophy forms the core of his teaching and scholarship.http://www.hope.edu/academic/communication/faculty/herrick/three.pdf Herrick views rhetoric as \\"architechtonic\\". * organizes and structures other arts and disciplines * it's a kind of master discipline that controls all others * says that if rhetoric is the study of how we organize and use language effectively, then it is also a study of how we organize our thinking on various subjects, that is, all ideas are packaged rhetorically Herrick wanted everyone to recognize \\"the pervasiveness of persuasiveness\\" and defines rhetoric as \\"the systematic study and intentional practice of effective symbolic expression\\" James A. Herrick, The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction, 3rd edition, p. 7 He states that \\"rhetoric is the art of employing symbols effectively,\\" and that 'effective' means achieving the purpose of the symbol-user. The categories in which this effectiveness can be judged include persuasion, clarity, beauty, and mutual understanding.see ref #8 Critical reception Herrick‚Äôs scholarly output has met with much critical appreciation in the academic community. Of Herrick‚Äôs 1997 book, The Radical Rhetoric of the English Deists, Lester C. Olson of the University of Pittsburgh wrote, ‚ÄúIt is...an important contribution to eighteenth-century studies and scholarship on the history of Britain.‚Äù James W.

It was won by Fireball Roberts driving a 1962 Pontiac. Roberts drove his famous number 22 to victory in three hours and 10 minutes. The race was run in its entirety without a single caution flag. Roberts dominated the event by leading 144 of the 200 laps. The win was Roberts' second victory of the season. Speedweeks This year's Speedweeks followed a familiar pattern, Fireball was the class of the field. he won the pole for his qualifying race in his Smokey Yunick prepared 1962 Pontiac and again led from flag to flag, averaging 156.999 mph over the 40 laps to set the all-time Grand National race speed record. The Indy Invasion For the top Indianapolis drivers, including the three previous winners of the Indianapolis 500--A. J. Foyt, Rodger Ward and Jim Rathmann‚Äîthis was irresistible. They clamored to get the United States Auto Club (which had replaced the AAA as the nation's leading auto racing sanctioned body) to lift its ban on racing at Daytona, but USAC, which sanctioned the Indy 500, would not budge. It wanted the drivers to focus on its own stock car racing series. The Indy drivers would have to wait another year. Race Day A furious battle erupted right from the green flag. Five different drivers traded the lead during the first 50 laps, including Joe Weatherly, who had won his qualifying race. Few, if anyone, paid attention when the no. 52 Ford dropped out of the race on lap four with electrical problems. Behind the wheel was 22-year-old Cale Yarborough of Timmonsville, South Carolina, destined to finish last in the 48-car field. The pitched battle at the front saw Roberts lead the 15th lap, Cotton Owens lead on lap 16, Junior Johnson on lap 17 and Roberts again on lap 18. The blistering pace allowed the front-runners to lap nearly the entire field. But Yunick's flat- out strategy caused Roberts to run out of gas twice in the early going. During pit stops, Roberts pulled down his window by hand, just like a passenger car driver, to accept a drink. Not far behind the front-runners was Richard Petty. He took the lead for the first time on lap 42. Petty was in a Plymouth that had started 10th, but his car was at least 10 mph slower than Roberts' Pontiac. Petty's team decided to try Junior Johnson's 1960 race-winning strategy and stay with Roberts at all costs, to draft him incessantly and pit when he did. Lee Petty, still limping from his devastating 1961 crash, stalked the pits during the last 125 miles, placed his hands on his lips, his cigar in his mouth, with his intention on watching the battle on the track. But this time, Roberts would not be denied. His nerves were frayed by the fear of yet another late race calamity, but he nonetheless turned laps at more than 155 mph in the late going and gradually distanced himself from Petty. Roberts won by 27 seconds. Petty finished second, becoming the only other driver on the lead lap. It was Fireball's only Daytona 500 victory. He would die two years later from a fiery crash in the World 600.
