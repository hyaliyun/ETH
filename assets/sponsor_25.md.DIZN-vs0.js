He is the former CEO of Maersk Line, the world's largest container shipping company. He was also the Chairman of the board at Danske Bank, which is the largest bank in Denmark, before briefly being appointed CEO until his firing in 2013. Kolding was appointed CEO of Maersk Line 1 July 2006, at which time he also became a partner at the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group. He is a member of the Executive Board of the company. In 1983, he graduated as MA, Law from University of Copenhagen. He was admitted lawyer to the bar in 1986, and joined A.P. Moller in 1989. He has held positions as Managing Director of Maersk Hong Kong Ltd. and as CFO in the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group, from 1998 to 2006.  Triple-E - the world's largest ship  On a press conference in London on 21 February 2011, Eivind Kolding revealed that Maersk Line had just signed a deal with Korea's Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., ordering 10 gigantic vessels to be delivered in 2013-14. Each of these vessels will be capable of carrying 18,000 twenty foot containers, making them the largest container vessels the world has ever seen. During the presentation in London, Eivind Kolding stated that the size and capacity of these vessels, at 400 metres long and 59 metres wide, will help reduce energy consumption and lower CO2 emissions far beyond what regulators imagined possible at that point. A website following the making of the vessels was also launched for the occasion, and the news caught worldwide media attention. The name of the new vessel class is Triple-E. The three E's stand for \\"Economies of scale\\", \\"Energy efficient\\" and \\"Environmentally improved\\". In June 2011 Maersk Line exercised its option with Daewoo to build an additional 10 Triple-E vessels.  A call for change  On 7 June 2011 Eivind Kolding addressed the container shipping and logistics industry as the keynote speaker at the TOC conference in Antwerp, Belgium. He said that the container industry might be \\"only a few years from being completely overtaken\\" by new technology, and called for radical changes in the industry to ‚Äúassure itself of a license to operate in the future.‚Äù In his keynote, Eivind Kolding also pointed out what kind of radical changes he believes are necessary for the industry to survive. First, the reliability or on-time delivery of the carriers has to improve. Secondly, the industry has to be much easier to do business with. And thirdly, shipping companies need to focus even harder on the environmental impact of their operations. On the occasion, Eivind Kolding presented a manifesto named \\"The new normal\\" with more detailed information about the thoughts and studies behind his call for change. Eivind Kolding's call for change was well received by both media and shippers around the globe and led to both intense and constructive discussions at the website launched for the occasion. On the website, Eivind Kolding repeats the core messages from his keynote speech in Antwerp.Shippers' Voice: \\"Shippers‚Äô Voice applauds Maersk- inspired revolution in liner shipping\\" Video recordings of his full keynote speech was later published on the internet.  Introducing absolute reliability  On 12 September 2011 Eivind Kolding yet again took center stage when he revealed a new product offering by Maersk Line at a press conference in London. The product which the company has named Daily Maersk was said to be the introduction of ‚Äúabsolute reliability‚Äù. Basically, Daily Maersk entails daily cut-offs, absolute reliability and promised delivery on the Asia to North Europe trade route, the largest and arguably most important trade route in the shipping industry. The launch of Daily Maersk caught worldwide media attention as the press conference was streamed live on the website launched for the occasion, and the industry press reacted positively to the news. Daily Maersk can be seen as part of Maersk Line‚Äôs answer to Eivind Kolding‚Äôs call for change a few months earlier.  CEO of Danske Bank  On 19 December 2011 it was announced that Eivind Kolding will take over the position as CEO of Danske Bank, effective 15 February 2012. In Maersk Line, he will be replaced by S√∏ren Skou. On 16 September 2013 he was fired immediately, and replaced by Thomas Borgen.https://www.danskebank.com/en-uk/press/News/Press-releases-and- company-announcements/Company%20announcement/Group/Pages/ca16092013.aspx  References   External links  * Profile on maerskline.com * Profile on maersk.com * Profile on wsj.com * Profile on BusinessWeek * Website: Triple-E - the world's largest ship  Website: Changing the way we think about shipping * \\"The new normal\\" - Eivind Kolding's manifesto  DailyMaersk.com: Website presenting Daily Maersk Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Danish businesspeople in shipping Category:Businesspeople from Copenhagen Category:University of Copenhagen alumni Category:Maersk Line Category:Maersk people Category:Danske Bank people ","title":"Eivind Kolding"},{"id":"32426240","text":"William L.

The team was founded in on April 14, 1912, by the initiative of three sports enthusiasts from Santos by the names of Raimundo Marques, M√°rio Ferraz de Campos, and Argemiro de Souza J√∫nior. In 1962, the club participated in their first of many South American competitions, and has since amassed seven CONMEBOL trophies and a quadruple.

JonesThe 'Labour Question' in Nineteenth Century Brazil: railways, export agriculture and labour scarcity (pg 35) In 1884, Miller sent his 10-year-old son Charles William Miller to Bannister School in Southampton, England to be educated. Charles was a skilled athlete who quickly picked up the game of football at the time when the Football League was still being formed, and as an accomplished winger and striker Charles held school honours that gained him entry into the Southampton Football Club team, and later into the County team of Hampshire. On his return to Brazil, Charles brought two footballs and a set of Hampshire FA rules in his suitcase. He then taught the rules of the game to players in S√£o Paulo. The first Santos FC emblem, 1912 Henrique Porchat de Assis introduced football to the city of Santos at the Instituto Presbiteriano Mackenzie. Although water sports such as rowing were the most practiced activity by the city's youth, the introduction of football by Porchat de Assis quickly became the top event in Santos. Santos was growing in wealth, with its port growing as one of the largest in the world with coffee, a major product in those times, being the most exported product.Hist√≥ria do Porto de Santos Combined with plans from the city of to form a statewide competition, the socialites of Santos created two football clubs to represent them: Clube Atl√©tico Internacional and Sport Club Americano. The first football match in Santos was played on November 1, 1902 with Porchat de Assis as one of the spectators. However, Atl√©tico Internacional dissolved in 1910 due to growing debts and extremely poor results which included not scoring a single goal during the 1908 season. With the Serra do Mar, a 1,500 km long system of mountain ranges and escarpments in Southeastern Brazil,Angulo, R. J., G. C. Lessa, M. C. de Souza (2009).

Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences 107: 135-176. separating S√£o Paulo and Santos by 76 km, Americano found participating in the Paulista tournament a long and expensive journey. This prompted the club members to move the club to the city of S√£o Paulo. This left Santos with no representatives left, which many Santistas, particularly the city students, being left dissatisfied at this turn of events. A meeting to create a football team was advertised to take place at the headquarters of the Concordia Club (located in Rosario Street No. 18, at the top of the old bakery and Switzerland confectionery, currently Avenida Jo√£o Pessoa) The meeting, which lasted 14 hours, was spearheaded by three sportsmen from the city: Raymundo Marques Francisco, M√°rio Ferraz de Campos and Argemiro de Souza Junior. During the meeting, there was doubt as to the name that should be given to the club. Several suggestions emerged: √Åfrica Futebol Clube, Associa√ß√£o Esportiva Brasil, Conc√≥rdia Futebol Clube, among others. But the participants hailed unanimously at the proposal of Edmundo Jorge de Araujo: Santos Foot-Ball Club. Thus, the club was formally born at 2:00 pm on April 14, 1912, 12 hours and 20 minutes before the Titanic would sink into the Atlantic Ocean. The club's first president was Sizino Patuska (who had participated in the founding of Atl√©tico Internacional and was the founder of Americano). The first field for Santos was the Campo da Ana Costa, Atl√©tico Internacional's former playing field.  The first years (1913-1917)  Santos FC team of 1913 The first game took place on June 23, 1912 against a local opponent named Thereza Team which Santos won 2‚Äì1, with goals scored by Anacleto Ferramenta and Geraule Ribeiro. Santos formation then was Fauvel, Simon, Ari, Bandeira, Ambr√≥sio, Oscar, Bulle, Geraule, Esteves, Fontes and Anacleto. For the first official game on September 15, the opponent was Santos Athletic Club, also known at the time as the ‚ÄòClube dos Ingleses‚Äô. Santos first official goal in the history of the club was scored by Arnaldo Silveira. In the beginning of 1913, Santos received an invitation from the S√£o Paulo Football League to compete in the state championship. This was Santos‚Äô first official competition and the debut happened on June 1, against Germ√¢nia. The result was not a very good one, as the team was defeated 8‚Äì1. Santos formation at that match was Durval Damasceno, Sebasti√£o Arantes, Sydnei Simonsen; Geraule Ribeiro, Ambr√≥sio Silva, Jos√© Pereira da Silva; Adolfo Millon, Nilo Arruda, Anacleto Ferramenta, Harold Cross and Arnaldo Silveira. In 1913, the Campeonato Santista de Futebol took place for the first time, and the teams taking part of it were Santos, Am√©rica, Escol√°stica Rosa and Atl√©tico. The Alvinegro (the ‚Äúblack and white‚Äù as Santos is also called by fans) was crowned the champion, having six victories in six games, 35 goals for and only seven against. This was the very first achievement in the history of the club. Three weeks later, on June 22, Santos won their first match in an official competition against a team who would become the club greatest rival, Corinthians. Santos won 6‚Äì3 in a full Parque S√£o Jorge, Corinthians‚Äô home.  1917-1935  Between the 1917 and 1926 seasons, Santos was recognized as a solid and talented team, but one that could not offer a true challenge for the state title, finishing no higher than fourth place. That changed in 1927 when the tradition of the Alvinegro became defined during the 1920s: the discovery and creation of young talent. The team, known as O ataque dos 100 gols (English: The 100-goal attackers), was led by the first major club idol, Araken Patusca, son of the first president of Santos. With the Araken Patusca was the first Santista to participate in a World Cup, as a member of the Brazilian national team squad in the FIFA World Cup in 1930, the first World Cup. He played one match against Yugoslavia.according to most sources, including the RSSSF, the Santos Futebol Clube official web site, and Sambafoot.com. FIFA does not list him in the starting lineup or as reserve in the official match report, but contemporary newspapers do: they criticized the performance of Araken against Yugoslavia, saying \\"Araken played like a dancer\\". Santos finished as runners-up in 1927, 1928 and 1929, scoring 100 goals in 16 games in the 1927 season, resulting in an incredible rate of 6.25 goals per match. The milestone of 100 goals was a result of work characteristics that later would become an excerpt in the official anthem of the club: T√©cnica e Disciplina (English: Technique and Discipline). Santos entered a period of irregular campaigns, coinciding with the club's transition to professionalism; in 1933 the president of Santos publicly declared Santos a professional side for the first time. This was followed by the club's first great success in 1935. During that season, the club prepared heavily for the Paulist√£o with 14 friendlies, winning seven, losing four and drawing three matches. The 10-1 thrashing of Espanha at the hands of Santos provided the highlight of its preseason preparations. On the last match of the state competition, Santos defeated Corinthians 2‚Äì0 at the Est√°dio Parque S√£o Jorge, Corinthians' home ground at the time, to win their first state title ever, thanks to goals by Raul and an experienced Araken Patusca. This historic consecration sealed Santos' first major title and paved the way for future generations to follow. Although Santos failed to retain the state title next season, the club remained undefeated in international matches during the 1930s, with seven wins and one draw. The most overwhelming win occurred against the French national football team, who arrived at Santos on July 30 after the FIFA World Cup in Uruguay and decided to use the stop to play against a local team, handidly losing 6‚Äì1 with four goals from Feiti√ßo. Claiming they faced the Sele√ß√£o rather than the club, the suspicious French were invited to the clubhouse to prove that the team that had just faced them was not the Brazilian team in disguise.

Steinhaus has been the target of abuse and controversial incidents on several occasions, including a physical confrontation from Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola while serving as the fourth official in a 2014 match, and an accidental groping of her breast by a player in 2010. Fortuna D√ºsseldorf's Kerem Demirbay was suspended for five matches by his club after making a sexist comment towards Steinhaus, who had sent him off for a second yellow card. IRIB, the state broadcaster of Iran, cancelled their broadcast of a Bundesliga fixture in February 2019 due to Steinhaus being named as its head referee. The television channel had previously broadcast a match officiated by Steinhaus, but cut to crowd shots instead of using the close-up shots of Steinhaus in the normal feed. Steinhaus was appointed to officiate the 2020 DFL-Supercup between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund on 30 September 2020. She announced that the match would be the last of her refereeing career. Personal life Steinhaus lives in Langenhagen, and is a trained police officer with the rank of Chief Inspector. She is in a long-term relationship with English referee Howard Webb, who separated from his wife in 2016.

Frank, a former executive at the Walt Disney Television, and Jeff Kwatinetz, former CEO of the talent agency The Firm, Inc., and music manager Peter Katsis. Based in Century City, California, and embodies three distinct business units: music management, record label, and television production. On May 3, 2011, former ABC executive Josh Barry joined the company to lead the production company. The production company produced USA Network television series Royal Pains, as well as the FX Network series Wilfred and the WGN America series, Salem. The music division is divided into the management department, which guides the careers of music artists, and Prospect Park Records, an independent record label which has served as the label home to artists such as Five Finger Death Punch, Korn, and Mindset Evolution. In 2014, it added British chart toppers You Me at Six and New York rapper Azealia Banks to its roster. In 2013, Prospect Park launched its own web channel, The Online Network, with revivals of the long-running daytime soap operas One Life to Live and All My Children. Later that year it filed a lawsuit against ABC, the licensee of those series, and the Prospect Park Networks division filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2014. The production and music divisions remained unaffected, and in 2015 were positioned as subordinate entities to a reactivated The Firm, Inc. The Online Network On July 7, 2011, ABC announced the licensing of its soaps to Prospect Park, who intended to continue production of the shows in a new paid online TV and interactive media network. On September 27, 2011, Prospect Park announced that it would produce new episodes of the two daytime soap operas, which would air on its new Internet channel starting in January 2012. On November 10, 2011, it was announced that the relaunch of All My Children had been indefinitely delayed and that Prospect Park would focus solely on the relaunch of One Life to Live. However, on November 23, 2011, Prospect Park suspended its plans altogether to launch an online channel with All My Children and One Life to Live. However, a year later, it was announced the plans were revived. On January 7, 2013, it was confirmed via press release that Prospect Park's The Online Network would launch and that All My Children and One Life to Live would serve as anchor programming. Production of the shows resumed on February 25, 2013. The soap operas premiered with new 30 minute episodes on Hulu, Hulu Plus and iTunes on April 29, 2013. TOLN also produced a series of behind the scenes promotional \\"episodes\\" called MORE All My Children and MORE One Life to Live, as well as a radio talk show centered on the programs, called TOLN SOAPS Live with Michael Fairman. Litigation and bankruptcy On April 18, 2013, Prospect Park filed a $25 million lawsuit against ABC over One Life to Live, alleging ABC failed to honor its part of the licensing agreement. Among the issues named in the lawsuit are allegations of ABC's attempts to sabotage Prospect Park's revival of the soaps by killing off One Life to Live characters loaned to General Hospital, failure on ABC's part to consult Prospect Park on storylines involving One Life to Live characters, and claiming that one One Life to Live character was actually a General Hospital character.LEGAL SOAP OPERA UPDATE: ABC Calls $25M Prospect Park Suit ‚ÄúBaseless‚Äù Deadline Hollywood, April 23, 2013 On June 6, 2013, production of both shows was halted due to a labor dispute with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees labor union, which was resolved two months later.Prospect Park Halts Production to Soap Operas Over Union Dispute Enstars, June 6, 2013 On September 3, 2013, Prospect Park announced production of All My Children and One Life to Live would be suspended until the lawsuit with ABC was resolved. On November 11, 2013, several All My Children cast members announced that Prospect Park had closed production and canceled the series again. On March 10, 2014, Prospect Park Networks announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while it continued its lawsuit against ABC. ABC subsequently filed a countersuit seeking unpaid licensing fees. TOLN was dissolved later that year. The Firm, Inc. was reactivated in August 2015, with Prospect Park Productions as a subordinate entity continuing to produce its series, including Royal Pains and Salem, and the music divisions similarly unaffected. ABC's countersuit was dismissed in October 2016, and Prospect Park's lawsuit was dismissed in December 2016, with the rights to All My Children and One Life to Live reverting to ABC.

The group, established in 1915, has operated largely in secrecy despite being either wholly or partly responsible for many events, traditions, and activities in student life, athletics, and academics. The group's motto is ‚ÄúTo Be Nameless in Worthy Deeds.‚Äù Scarabbean Senior Society brick on UT campus History and past contributions The idea of the group first came to John Ayres (‚Äô15), the son of the University President Brown Ayres. He desired to form a group that could incorporate leaders in various campus organizations to better work together and coordinate on improving student life. He approached two faculty members for help, Elliot Park Frost and George Hebert Clarke, and the group was formed.‚ÄúScarabbean Senior Secret Society at the University of Tennessee: Its Origin, Purpose, Methods of Operation, and Achievements,‚Äù L.R. Hesler, University of Tennessee Libraries, Special Collections, unlisted student affairs box The Scarabbean Senior Secret Society looked at many different areas in the University and then sought ways to improve conditions. It created, influenced, and encouraged the formation/construction of many features of student life, most of which are still felt today. The group established All-Students Club, now called the Student Government Association, in 1919. It started both Carnicus and the All- Sing Competition. The Society also created the predecessor the University's Interfraternity Council, the Fraternity Relations Board. After its early years, the group continued its impact at the school. It strongly supported the formation of the University Center and spiritual retreats. It also started, both in 1965, the school's current student newspaper, The Daily Beacon, and the student activities fee to help pay for it and other endeavors.September 1965 edition of The Pirate, University of Tennessee Libraries, Special Collections, AR.0499, box 1, folder 1 The group is also responsible for several University traditions, such as the Alma Mater, the Torchbearer symbol, Aloha Oe, and Torch Night. In recent years, little is known about what the group has been involved in although a few things are known. It launched the Honors Ambassador's Program to better recruit students and the Student Gift Committee,Summer 1994 edition of The Pirate, University of Tennessee Libraries, Special Collections, AR.0499, box 1, folder 1 leading to the addition of University history onto the pedestrian walkway and the clock tower near the main library, among other things. It also used its alumni to set up a teaching award at the university, the L.R. Hesler Award.University Faculty Senate meeting minutes from February 11th meeting, http://web.utk.edu/~senate/Minutes84-85.html Perhaps its most visible contribution to the university from its early years is Neyland Stadium. When the University started to build a new athletic field, the school ran out of money and could not finish the project. However, during a Society meeting, it was decided that the students and faculty could help finish the construction. So in the Spring of 1921, students and faculty leveled the field, dug drainage ditches, and added other improvements. Thus the new athletic field, Shields- Watkins Field, was now finished. Beliefs, traditions, and membership As stated earlier, the group's motto is ‚ÄúTo Be Nameless in Worthy Deeds.‚Äù It forms the basis of the group's ideals. More can be accomplished by working behind the scenes on campus improvements with members unable to take credit. However, the group's longtime faculty advisor, LR Hesler, in his history of the Society, said there is another quote that the group accepts which is Johann Goethe‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhere there is much light, the shadows are deepest.‚Äù A large part of the group that continues today includes an Egyptian and pirate culture. The emphasis on ancient Egyptian culture can be traced to the use of the scarab beetle. It has had a place in most of the group's history. A student's time at the University and in the Society could be, ‚Äúan experience where he can activate his spirit in the direction of improving his moral and emotional nature; where he can learn something from the stout-bodied scarab beetle ‚Äì a symbol of his own resurrection.‚Äù The use of the scarab beetle is also used as part of the society's logo, along with crossed swords. Other references to ancient Egypt include invoking ‚ÄúBubastis‚Äù and the titles ‚ÄúWorthy Osiris‚Äù and \\"Amenophis III,\\" which are leadership positions within the society. The other theme used heavily in the Society is the pirate culture. In its early years in the yearbook, a boat was used as the group's symbol instead the scarab beetle and then it was used together with the scarab beetle before being dropped. The name of the group's newsletter for most of its history was The Pirate until the name changed to Orange Slices. In addition to the two Egyptian-named leadership titles, the group also has two pirate-named titles, ‚ÄúHenry Morgan‚Äù and ‚ÄúEdward Davis.‚ÄùSummer 1994 edition of The Pirate, University of Tennessee Libraries, Special Collections, AR.0499, box 1, folder 1 While there are several other traditions, they do not really use any Egyptian or pirate themes. Fellow members are called ‚Äúcomrades‚Äù and there is an annual meeting with current and past members every homecoming. The group still maintains a directory of all members called The Blackbook. The Society also flies a flag for every graduation to congratulate its graduates though no names are listed, only ‚ÄúNameless.‚Äù The Society used to publish all members in the Volunteer yearbook but stopped after 1969, with the exception of 1981. Since 1969, very few new members are known. Initiation and membership is closely guarded. In years past, the typical tapping ground for new initiates was at the University's Torchbearer statue. But the current method is not confirmed although tapping students in the library and asking, ‚ÄúAre you ready?‚Äù is one of the current rumors concerning initiation. For most of its history, the group initiated members based on positions held. For example, the SGA President was always inducted along with the Vice President and the SGA Election Commissioner. But in recent years, it is possible the group has stopped adding members based on positions held. For a majority of its history, membership was restricted to only white males but that policy has changed in recent decades. Criticism and reporting There has been plenty of criticism of the Scarabbean Senior Secret Society but most of it has been within the past two decades. Due to the strength of its secrecy, the group was largely anonymous and nearly all students were unaware of its existence. But the group connected student leaders and mid-to-high level university administrators. Even in its early years, administrators handpicked members to discuss possible improvements and then those students would feed the information back to their respective groups and increase student support for these endeavors.Montgomery, James Riley. Threshold of a New Day: The University of Tennessee 1919-1946. (The University of Tennessee Record, 1974), 311. The closeness of students to administrators has led to beliefs that such student members have been compromised and no longer represent the interests of the student body but rather the administrators and that they have a severe conflict of interest. The secrecy could allow members to act in their own interests instead without having to worry about an outcry from other students. Other student leaders have occasionally decried the group for its influence on campus and ability to quash rival ideas that may not sync up with the group's own ideas. In one letter to the editor in 1991 from several SGA executives and Torchbearer Award recipients, they point out how the group's existence undermines SGA as the Scarabbean Senior Secret Society is where the real interaction between students and administrators are located and where the implementation of ideas become a reality.‚ÄúLeaders Allege Secret Society Undermined SGA,‚Äù The Daily Beacon, April 20s, 1991. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, controversy concerning the group reached its loudest point. On the SGA discussion page, students continually posted about the Scarabs and how it was a major conspiracy. It was not until an expos√© by The Daily Beacon in November 1999 that the controversy was campus-wide. Students blasted the secrecy while outed members defended themselves by saying students should want top leaders to work in secret with the administration or blasted student ignorance.http://utdailybeacon.com/opinion/letters/1999/nov/16/scarab-article- takes-away-from-real-news/ Allegations of rigging SGA elections followed and students became distrustful of especially the top SGA executives.http://utdailybeacon.com/opinion/letters/1999/nov/18/secrecy-may- disguise-questionable-motives/ The controversy followed into the next SGA election as flyers were posted around campus claiming that one of the candidates for president was a Scarab. While the candidate did confirm during a debate that he was a Scarab, he still won the election. The general university lost interest in the organization after the early 2000s until 2017 when a Daily Beacon writer published a large feature on the organization discussing Scarabbean history and practices.. During his research, the reporter received documents and a list of names of current and former members that were later verified but not published. In an interview for the article, UT-Martin chancellor Keith Carver said he was a member of the organization but had not been involved since his undergraduate graduation. After publication of the 2017 article, a columnist involved with its reporting discussed his issues with the society.

Somerset) (25 May 1866 - 14 November 1890) was a British conman who was convicted of killing one of his victims in Canada. He was hanged at Woodstock, Ontario. Born into a wealthy family in Lancashire, England, Birchall entered the Lincoln College, Oxford in 1885. While at Lincoln, Birchall spent his time partying and incurring debt, where he founded the Black and Tan Club. In 1888 Birchall was forced to leave college and sell off his is inheritance to pay his debts. That same year he paid ¬£600 for an estate in Woodstock. After eloping with his fianc√©e, the couple travelled to Canada. When they arrived in Woodstock, they discovered that the property was a small farm, not an estate. After six months of creating more debt in Woodstock, the couple returned to England. Once in England, Birchall concocted a scheme to defraud several wealthy people. He took out an advertisement in a London newspaper claiming to be the owner of a prosperous horse farm in Canada who was looking for investors. His plan was to take the money, place bets in the Derby horse race, and pay back the investors with his winnings. However the British investors wanted to inspect the Canadian farm and its financial records before investing. Frederick C. Benwell In February 1890, the Birchalls and the investors arrived in New York City and then travelled to Buffalo, New York. At this point, Birchall took Frederick Benwell, the son of the biggest potential investor, to Ontario to view the farm. After arriving near Woodstock, Birch led Benwell into the woods, then shot him twice in the back of the head. Birchall then returned to Buffalo, telling the other investors that Benway had decided to return to England separately. However, on February 20, Birchall telegraphed Benwell's father in England, saying that his son had agreed to the investment and he should immediately wire over ¬£500. On February 23, 1890, hunters found a body in a swamp in Princeton, Ontario. Clothing tags had been removed, and a watch was found close to the body. Still in Buffalo, one of Birchall's investors saw a picture of the body in a newspaper and recognized him as Benwell. He travelled to Ontario to identify the body and speak with police. Birchall was arrested in Niagara Falls, Ontario on March 3 and transported back to Princeton, Ontario. Birchall denied murdering Benwell. On September 22, Birchall's trial started at Woodstock's Town Hall. Given that both the suspect and the victim were members of the British aristocracy, the trial garnered substantial attention. News organizations from England, France, Germany and Italy covered the trial. Birchall was convicted of murder based on circumstantial evidence and sentenced to death on September 30. Birchall professed his innocence to the end. He wrote a long account of the affair while in prison. This memoir was published in an attempt to create an income for his wife after his death. Birchall was hanged on November 14, 1890. He was buried in the courtyard of the Woodstock City Gaol, where he still remains. The swamp in Princeton was called \\"Benwell Swamp\\" by the locals.

His parents were Welsh, his father an inspector of schools and mother a teacher. He attended secondary school at Dynevor School in Swansea, Wales. He then studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and graduated with a double first in Economics. In later life, Davies received a PhD from the same university (Cambridge) based on his published works. Career In 1964, Davies taught Economics at the University of Adelaide, South Australia. After coming back to the UK, he spent two years at the BBC as a radio producer. He then returned to the academia, lecturing at the University of Leeds for three years, followed by a stint as a visiting lecturer in India. In 1972 he joined the University of Reading as a lecturer in Sociology, receiving promotion to a Professor in 1984. In 2002 he retired and was appointed Professor Emeritus at the same university. In addition to numerous works on humour, censorship and morality, Davies also published a collection of humorous fantasy stories titled Dewi the Dragon. Humour research In his 2002 book The Mirth of Nations, Davies criticised the theories which derive humor from conflict and superiority, and argued instead that humor is a form of play ‚Äì a play with aggression, superiority, and taboo-breaking. He also argued against the Freudian theory about Jewish jokes being mostly self-deprecating, claiming that instead they are based on the cultural tradition of analytical thinking and self-awareness. American folklorist Alan Dundes called the book \\"the provocative critique of previous scholarship on the subject\\".

He has related research interests in semantic computation, systems sciences, artificial intelligence, philosophy of science and philosophy of language.

Dissertation Title: Toward a realist interpretation of quantum theory ‚Äì Integrating Bohr and Einstein. Early work in the industry In the 1970s Gomatam worked with India‚Äôs international airline on their software development projects. He then moved to the USA and worked as a freelance consultant for a number of Fortune-500 companies including General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Burroughs and IBM in the areas of operating system design, data communications and very-large database design. Academic career Starting from the early 1980s, Gomatam turned to fundamental scientific research, and started contributing to the development of the Bhaktivedanta Institute (B.I.) in Mumbai and Berkeley. Along the way, based on the work he was doing at B.I., he obtained his Ph.D. in the foundations of quantum mechanics. He has been a visiting scholar at University of Pretoria, South Africa and Loyola University, New Orleans, USA. Research Gomatam‚Äôs primary area of research is in non-relativistic quantum mechanics (QM), which emerged in 1925 with Erwin Schr√∂dinger's derivation of the \\"wave equation\\". Gomatam is developing his own approach to macroscopic quantum mechanics (MQM, applying the wave equation to the macroscopic regime), which is distinct from the ideas of ‚Äòmacroscopic dissipative systems‚Äô and ‚Äòmacroscopic quantum coherence‚Äô, developed in the early 80s by Anthony James Leggett. In general, Leggett's attempt is to indirectly observe superposition at the macroscopic level by extending current microscopic quantum physics to the macroscopic level. In contrast, Gomatam is attempting to develop MQM independent of the application of the Schr√∂dinger equation to the micro regime, in such a manner that quantum superposition can be directly observed at the macroscopic level. This involves introducing a new notion of macroscopic objects as quantum kinds, instead of classical objects. In this regard, he is also developing two further new ideas within physics: the ontology of \\"Objective, Semantic Information\\" (OSI) and corresponding \\"Relational Properties\\" (RPs). As part of developing his version of MQM, Gomatam has related interests in exotic manifolds, semantic information processing, quantum computation, and philosophy of ordinary language. Selected papers * Niels Bohr's Interpretation and the Copenhagen Interpretation‚ÄîAre the two incompatible?\\" Here Gomatam contrasts Bohr's Interpretation with Copenhagen Interpretation (where Bohr is a co-author).

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on March 12, 1949, and stars Porky Pig. It is a parody of the fairy tale The Pied Piper and it involves Porky trying to stop a cat that disguises himself as the last rat to bring the rats back for the local cats, and later, to get the reward money back from the cat, by playing a clarinet. It has Porky in the role of the piper character. Plot The people of the town of Hamelin are celebrating the high rat population being driven from the town. The cats hearing the news, do not bode well for them as it means their main food source is gone. In panic, they decide to go to the Supreme Cat for a solution to the problem. Supreme tells to the crowd of cats that his plan is to get the rats back by sabotaging the Piper's reward collecting with a rat suit. While wearing the rat suit, Supreme sneaks into the town hall. Supreme arrives at the town hall as Porky is going to get his reward money from the mayor. Supreme walks straight into the mayor's office and does a Last of the Mohicans impression and the mayor tells Porky he won't be getting the money until that rat is gone. Around the town, Supreme bothers Porky by running around in the rat costume and momentarily removes it to trip and insult Porky in various ways. Porky eventually grabs the rat suit and Supreme deliberately loses it. Porky takes the empty costume back to the town hall to get the reward money. Just when the mayor gets the reward money from the vault, Supreme pops out and steals it. Porky chases after him to get it back, which he does by tricking the cat to come out of hiding by pretending to bring the rats back. Finally Porky gets the reward money and insults the cat back before he leaves playing his clarinet and walks into the distance.

Biography Mario Bernasconi was born in 1899 in Lugano-Pazzallo, in the home facing the Museum. He was the son of Luigi Bernasconi (electrician) and Caterina Dozio (seamstress). He grew up with his sister Maria (Nini), who was two years younger. He was attracted to what he called \\"la mia montagna\\" (my mountain) - San Salvatore. On the mountain, he discovered clay and received his first inspirations. During his childhood, beside the school there was the country life. He brought home lizards, snakes, insects of every kind, which he studied and observed attentively. Work and study 1914 - Once the obligatory schools terminated and having to learn a trade, Mario worked in a pharmacy in Lugano. In the evening he posed as a model in the studio of the sculptor Luigi Vassalli. Captured by the arts, Mario left the pharmacy and became a student of Luigi Vassalli (monument to Carlo Battaglini). He appears as the angel-like figure in the monument. In addition to posing and performing hard work, he learned the art of moulding, design in relief, and the study of the human body. In carving marble and shaping clay he was more than ever convinced to become a sculptor. 1917 - Mario continued his studies by the painter and sculptor Giuseppe Foglia and started his own studio in Pazzallo, in the house that is now the Mario Bernasconi Museum. In his studies, Mario was deeply inspired by Michelangelo, Donatello, Rodin, Maillol and Lehmbruck.Esposito, Salati, Caglio, Manzoni, 1981 p. 17-31. Early works and scholarships Mario obtained the first Federal scholarship that was renewed for three consecutive years: 1921 - the mask La scema (the idiot) La Scema - early work 1922 - the portraits of \\"Enea\\" and \\"Eva\\". 1923 - the bust \\"La giovane madre\\" Mario with the young Mother Ritratto_di_Eva - early work. He made portraits of his friends, among them Angelo Tonello, the painters Filippo Boldini, Gualtiero Colombo, the writers Vinicio Salati Francesco Manzoni and Silvio Calloni the naturalist from Pazzallo. He created the head of \\"Cristo\\" (Christ) that stands atop the steps of San Pietro Pambio Cemetery, at the center of the big stone cross.Christ 1923 - His mother became ill and died. A period of inertia followed, but it's the portrait of his mother that brought back his creativity. 1925- At the National Exhibition of Fine Art at the Kunsthaus Zurich, the Federal Government acquired the statue \\"Il Curato di campagna\\" (The country Priest) and donated the bronze to the city of LuganoDetail of the country priest The full plaster figure can be seen at the Museum in Pazzallo. On June 13, 1926, in New York, on the Daily News of the workers of America, \\"The New World\\" in the center of the front page appears the reproduction of the sculpture \\"Il Martire\\" (The Martyr) by Mario Bernasconi. It was Giacomo Matteotti, which in New York on that day, the second year of his death was commemorated. Bernasconi later donated this sculpture to the Chamber of Labor in Lugano. Career, character, marriage and travel The artist demonstrates to be a free-thinker, a great lover of nature, mystic, philosopher, intuitive, poet, romantic. His family and friends considered him to be gentle and having a good character, a bit narcissistic, sentimental and emotional. Sometimes argumentative at times revolutionary and remembered for his motto \\"Lottare per non morire\\" (Fight not to die). Of the encounter with friends, writes Francesco Manzoni in the volume \\"Mario Bernasconi Scultore\\" Editions Aurora, Lugano: \\"Then the political rounds would break loose and Mario wearing the Valiere tie, was singing Bandiera Rossa (Red Flag) and the hymn to the anarchists or he would play them on the mouth accordion, his face assuming a faun flavor whereby his authentic faith was affirmed without reservation: perhaps with great anger, that sometimes had the epic of Brecht and when cooled off, ended with the recitation of a scarlet \\"Ca ira.\\"Manzoni 1981 p. 29 \\"RIcordo di uno scultore\\". Matured by the strong impression of the Egyptian sculptures, Greek and Roman, the one of the Renaissance, the neo-Gothic of Lehmbruck, the realism of Rodin, Mario Bernasconi found his own style. For art studies, he gives preference to the cities of Siena and Florence (Firenze) and he continues his formation through contact with artists and intellectuals.

This spiritual position came to light in the statue of the Madonna that stands in front of the Cathedral of San Lorenzo. Of all the verses of the litany, the artist chose the one that most reflected his intentions. \\"Virgo Potens\\". The woman who has been shaken and trembled at the Annunciation, the Mother who generated the divine infant in the squalor of the Bethlehem stable, the one who will be torn from the atrocious sufferings inflicted on the Son, this statue symbolizes a vigorous vitality. Seeing her, one is induced to enter the word robur (fortress) in the Salve Regina, where Mary is pleaded as life dulcedo et spes nostra. \\"Caglio 1981 p. 26 \\"Affermazioni dei valori della vita\\" His works have seen and endured many moves and travels in Switzerland and abroad. 1947 - 1949 - Again the sculptor is without a workshop.

The cartoon was released on August 13, 1949 and stars Charlie Dog and Porky Pig. The cartoon deals with Charlie trying to get Porky to adopt him after his old owner dumps him at Porky's farm on a trip disguised as a picnic. Charlie instead irritates Porky and the short deals with him trying to get rid of the dog in various ways, but failing each time. Plot The cartoon opens with a car driving up near a farm for a picnic and a man coming out and the dog Charlie coming out shortly after him. The man throws a stick, and when Charlie is off getting it, the man packs up and leaves in his car, deliberately leaving the dog behind. After Charlie is dumped, he tries various tricks to attract new owners from the people driving along the road. After three failures in various ways, he hears Porky singing and decides to go talk to him. He annoys Porky though as he says he is 50% various dogs but is mostly a Labrador Retriever. He eventually drives Porky crazy and is kicked off his property. A series of gags then ensues with Charlie trying to become Porky's dog, with them all failing until Porky is about to kick Charlie out but is stopped by a nearby Humane Society worker, who is spying on Porky, who does not want to get in trouble with the law. Porky then sings \\"Rock-a-bye Baby\\" as he carries Charlie back and puts Charlie down. After the Humane Society worker leaves, Porky demands that Charlie leave, but Charlie sadly and dramatically pleads Porky not to kick him out, as he always wanted to live in the country, and not the city, while Porky finally feels ashamed of himself. Porky finally feels sorry for Charlie's traumatic experience in the city and tricks Charlie into accepting him as a pet and puts him in a \\"sleeping bag\\" (which is actually a golf bag) which he promptly shuts and, cackling evilly, sends Charlie off to Scotland in it. However, when Porky returns Charlie is there in Scottish attire complete with a bagpipe and he eventually drives Porky into accepting him as a pet with the bagpipe's annoying music. Porky promptly suggests a picnic afterwards and he decides to head to the middle of a desert to do it, planning to abandon Charlie there. As Porky unpacks the food and calls Charlie out to catch the stick he has, Charlie comes running out. Porky proceeds to throw the stick, but Charlie, having now learned his lesson from the last master he had, runs to the car instead of going after the stick and drives off, deliberately leaving Porky behind. Porky at first becomes angry, then suddenly snaps, gets a crazy look in his eyes and starts barking and panting, acting like a dog. He is picked up by the dog catcher, who puts him in the back with the other dogs, where he barks along with them as the cartoon irises out.

There in the administrative district of Gmina Witkowo is the village of Ch≈ÇƒÖdowo. In 1692 Ch≈ÇƒÖdowo (at the time called Ch≈Çƒôdowo) was owned by the Ch≈Çƒôdowski family. This branch of the family belongs to the Gryf Clan. Seweryn Ch≈Çƒôdowski, a prominent member of the family purchased the estates of Wietrzno in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria in 1810. From this branch Freiherr Adam von Ch≈Çƒôdowski of the Bo≈Ñcza Clan married Ida Pfaff von Pfaffenhofen, the adopted daughter of Count Franz Simon Pfaff von Pfaffenhofen (1753‚Äì1840). From this marriage issued 2 sons Ludwig and Casimir, who received from Emperor Francis Joseph I the hereditary title of Baron and the right to use the name Ch≈Çƒôdowski von Pfaffenhofen.

It is named after Theodor Heuss (1884‚Äì1963), the first President of Germany after World War II. Location The square is located at the western end of the wide Kaiserdamm boulevard, leading via Bismarckstra√üe, Stra√üe des 17. Juni with the Berlin Victory Column and Brandenburg Gate in a direct line to Pariser Platz, Unter den Linden and the site of the City Palace in Berlin- Mitte. The axis is continued to the west by the Heerstra√üe up to Scholzplatz and further towards Spandau and the Berlin city limits. Underneath the square is the U-Bahn station Theodor-Heuss-Platz. History Reichskanzlerplatz with U-Bahn entrances, 1907 The square was laid out as part of the development of the new Westend district between 1904 and 1908 and then named Reichskanzlerplatz after the office of the Imperial Chancellor. When the eponymous U-Bahn station was inaugurated by Emperor Wilhelm II on 29 March 1908, the square was still without any houses. After the Nazi seizure of power, the square was renamed Adolf-Hitler-Platz on 21 April 1933. According to the Welthauptstadt Germania plans by Hitler and his architect Albert Speer, it was to have an important role at the western end of the monumental east‚Äìwest axis, including a vast heroes' memorial. It was also planned to rename the square after Benito Mussolini. After World War II, its name officially returned to Reichskanzlerplatz on 31 July 1947. Only six days after the death of President Theodor Heuss on 18 December 1963, the square was given its present name. In 2014, Google apologized after labeling Theodor-Heuss- Platz as Adolf-Hitler-Platz on its Google Maps service. Buildings NAAFI Club, Amerikahaus At the south of the square is the former Edinburgh House, the Deutschlandhaus and the Amerikahaus (clockwise). The Edinburgh House, was erected from 1960 to 1962 as a British Forces guest house and officers' hotel. It is today run as a boarding house by the Berlin Studentenwerk. The adjacent Deutschlandhaus and Amerikahaus were built from 1928 to 1930, including a hotel, a coffee house and a cinema. Since 1937 the studios of TV Station Paul Nipkow were located in the Deutschlandhaus. The Amerikahaus at the corner of Heerstra√üe was known as the Summit House, Jerboa Cinema and NAAFI centre after the war until the British Forces left Berlin in 1994. Today it is used as the cabaret theatre Die W√ºhlm√§use. In 1970, the on the eastern edge of the square located 18-story high TV centre of the former Sender Freies Berlin (SFB) broadcaster was finished. After the merger with the ORB on 1 May 2003 it became the Berlin home of the now created Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB). Close by in Masurenallee is the historic Haus des Rundfunks, finished 1930, which was seat of the Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft and the East German Berliner Rundfunk before the founding of the SFB. It is located straight across the exhibition ground and the Funkturm. Memorials and art Eternal Flame In 1955 an eternal flame monument was erected by compatriot groups organised in the Federation of Expellees to commemorate the Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944‚Äì50) during and after World War II. The flame was extinguished in the day of German reunification on 3 October 1990, but again lit three months later on Human Rights Day December 10. In 1989 the sculpture duo Two Heads was erected at the eastern edge of the square. The Blue Obelisk was placed opposite the eternal flame monument in 1995. Notable residents *Richard Strauss (1864‚Äì1949), composer, lived in Heerstra√üe 2 at the corner of Reichskanzlerplatz from 1913 to 1917 *Magda Quandt (1901‚Äì1945) lived in Reichskanzlerplatz 3 after her divorce in 1929, where she received Hitler and her future husband Joseph Goebbels In popular culture The novel In the Presence of Mine Enemies by Harry Turtledove has several crucial scenes set in Adolf Hitler Platz, in an alternate history where the Third Reich rules much of the world at the dawn of the 21st century.

Career He attended Forest School in Walthamstow, where he completed GCSEs. During this time, he became the youngest ever accepted member of the National Youth Choir of Great Britain under Michael Brewer, and began his training as a singer and 'cellist. In 1995 he went on to study A-Levels in Music, English Literature and History at Bancroft's School in Woodford Green, Essex; whilst also attending the Guildhall School of Music and Drama on Saturdays and training as a classical singer under Mollie Petrie. In 1999, he went on to study and gain a BA Hons degree in Drama from Middlesex University in North London, and in 2002 finally completed a year's postgraduate diploma in Musical Theatre at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in Wood Green. In March 2005, McNamara auditioned for Queen legends Brian May and Roger Taylor and comedian/author Ben Elton for the West End production of We Will Rock You. He was offered the speaking ensemble role of Bob the Builder and first cover to the role of Khashoggi (played by Alex Bourne), which he accepted, and he joined the cast in April. Later in 2005, Alex took over the role of Khashoggi full-time for a period of almost three months when Bourne sustained an injury, and appeared numerous times in the role between 2005-2007, also performing live onstage with Brian and Roger on several occasions, including Freddie Mercury's 60th Birthday Anniversary, and ITV's Al Murray's Happy Hour. In late 2010, McNamara was invited to join The Australian Pink Floyd Show as one of their vocalists, singing both backing and lead vocals. \\"Aussie Floyd\\" or TAPFS (as commonly abbreviated) are the world's biggest selling tribute act, and long-running testament to the iconic band Pink Floyd. In 2011, McNamara embarked on his first UK & European Tour with the band: playing celebrated venues such as the Eventim London Hammersmith Apollo, Liverpool's Echo Arena and the Manchester O2. The band's performance at Hammersmith in March was given a 4* review by David Sinclair in The Times. In June 2011, the band were joined onstage at the Hampton Court Palace Festival by bassist Guy Pratt of Pink Floyd, who sang a duet with Alex in the track Run Like Hell. A month later in July, TAPFS performed at the Chester Rocks Festival supporting Iggy and the Stooges. The band are due to tour the U.S. and Canada from October 2011, with another UK and European \\"Exposed in the Light\\" tour booked for 2012. Songs he sang on the 2011 tour included \\"Time\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Dogs\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"Coming Back to Life\\", and \\"Comfortably Numb\\". In 2015, McNamara announced via his Facebook page that he had decided to leave the Australian Pink Floyd. He now writes a full-time blog called Mac's Mouth.

The artwork is an abstract bronze piece which tops a granite fountain. Description La Hermana del Hombre B√≥veda is an abstract, figural, cast bronze artwork. The form wraps around a central cavity, which is the focal point when viewed from the front. Jutting edges that look as though they were ripped or chopped face the front, surrounding the circular cavity and contrasting with its smooth, hollowed surface. The highly textured surface curves around the back to create a rounded form that evokes a woman‚Äôs backside. The texture is consistently applied, with sporadic scratches creating emphasis and texture throughout. The artwork was originally patinated a medium brown color, unevenly applied to emphasize texture and form. The highly polished central cavity originally had a bright, golden sheen ‚Äì the natural color of the bronze. The polished and patinated surfaces were intended to play off of each other; the edge of the polished circle was slightly feathered into the rich brown. The artwork is currently mounted on a granite base which is part of a fountain; the fountain rests on a limestone base. The artwork is secured to the top of the fountain by means of a custom-made piece of steel which is hooked to the edges of the hollow bottom of the artwork. This steel piece has fittings so that it and the bronze can be rotated and then lifted off of the fountain. The bronze element itself weighs approximately 450 lbs. Identifying marks The artwork is signed at the bottom proper left edge ‚ÄúSerrano‚Äù. Historical information La Hermana del Hombre B√≥veda was hollow cast in a multi-part mold in Madrid in 1963. Location history La Hermana was installed as the central attraction of one of the IMA's most prominent accessibility projects - the Garden for Everyone. This garden made its debut in 1993, located at the east end of the Sutphin Mall in front of the museum. It was designed specifically for people with disabilities, and it creates a full sensory experience with fragrant flowers, various textures of stone and landscaping, and a gentle fountain, upon which La Hermana rests.Indianapolis Museum of Art. \\"Garden for Everyone\\", IMA Grounds and Gardens.

However, due to an unknown phenomenon that prevents them from traveling into space, humanity returns to Earth only to find it inhospitable except for Japan. To accommodate the entire human population, pocket dimensions are created around Japan to house the returned populace. In order to find a way to return to outer space, the humans begin reenacting human history according to the Holy Book Testament. But in the year 1413 of the Testament Era, due to the destruction of the land created above Japan for the reenactment which was called the Divine Realm, the nations of the pocket dimensions split Japan's territory into several \\"Divine States\\" most of which are ruled over by Japanese noble families of which the \\"Far East\\" of Japan is represented and the flying ship Musashi is the location of the Far East's academy. Musashi circles Japan and periodically docks in Far East Divine State territory. It is now the year 1648 of the Testament Era, and the Divine States are monitored by the Testament Union, the authority that runs the re-enactment of history. However, rumors of an apocalypse and war begin to spread when the Testament stops revealing what happened after 1648. Taking advantage of this situation, Tori Aoi, head of Musashi Ariadust Academy's Supreme Federation and President of the student council, uses this opportunity to lead his classmates and try to prevent the apocalypse and bring humanity into a better future.

During the summer of 1881 in a small New Mexican village, Garrett shot and killed the notorious outlaw, William H. Bonney, better known as Billy the Kid. Due to the first publisher's inability to widely distribute this book beginning in 1882, it sold relatively few copies during Garrett's lifetime. By the time the fifth publisher purchased the copyright in 1954, this book had become a major reference for historians who have studied the Kid's brief life. The promotion and distribution of the fifth version of this book to libraries in the United States and Europe sent it into a sixth printing in 1965, and by 1976 it had reached its tenth printing.Tuska (1983), p. 114. For a generation after Sheriff Garrett shot the Kid, his account was considered to be factual,Tuska (1983), p. 125. but historians have since found in this book many embellishments and inconsistencies with other accounts of the life of Billy the Kid.  Purpose  In the days and weeks that followed the death of Billy the Kid, there were several articles written mostly in New Mexican newspapers and dime novels that depicted the Kid's death in ways that put Pat Garrett in a bad light. As the author wrote in his introductory to this biography, \\"I am incited to this labor, in a measure, by an impulse to correct the thousand false statements which have appeared in the public newspapers and in yellow- covered, cheap novels.\\"Quotation from the introductory to The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid by Pat Garrett. Garrett's purpose comes in two parts; firstly, he wanted to publicly respond to the speculative accusations against him about Billy the Kid's death that were being printed, and secondly, he wanted to set the record straight regarding the more notable incidents that had involved the notorious outlaw beginning with his early life and leading up to his untimely death. Many people had begun to gossip about the unfairness of Garrett's final encounter with the Kid, so his first reason, which was to clear his name, was decidedly his main purpose.Tuska (1983), p. 192. Still smarting from local outrage in New Mexico over his shooting of the Kid, Garrett wanted to present his side of the story and hoped to turn a profit as well on the American public's fascination with the outlaw. Consequently, he published his account of Bonney's life and death in 1882. It was credited to Garrett, but the first fifteen chapters were a concoction of factual material mixed with fabrications, written by Roswell's postmaster, Ash Upson, an itinerant journalist. The remaining chapters, written in a more restrained style, are generally accurate, and were likely composed by Garrett himself. The book failed to find a wide audience and sold just a few copies; nevertheless, although filled with many errors of fact, The Authentic Life served afterwards as the main source for most books written about the Kid until the 1960s. Thus was established the mythic stature of Pat Garrett as the heroic lawman in pursuit of the villainous but romantic desperado, Billy the Kid.  Ghostwriter  Pat Garrett Ash Upson Garrett, who did not consider himself a writer, called upon his friend, Marshall Ashmun \\"Ash\\" Upson, to ghostwrite this book with him.Utley (1989), pgs. 198-9. Ash Upson was an itinerant journalist who had a gift for graphic prose. Upson and Garrett shared equally in the royalties.Tuska (1983), p. 37. As was noted in the introduction to the fifth version of this book: There is good reason to believe that the legend of Billy the Kid, including the familiar historical figure he has become, would not be known at all today if this book had not been published.Tuska (1983), p. xv.

Morgan (born c. Jan. 1, 1950) is an American law enforcement official who has served as the Chief Operating Officer and acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection since July 5, 2019. Morgan had a long career in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, culminating in appointments as head of the Inspection Division and Training Division. He then served as chief of the United States Border Patrol under President Barack Obama as the first person to be appointed to that post from outside the border Patrol; he resigned a few days after the inauguration of President Donald Trump. Morgan returned to government when he was announced as Trump's pick to be acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), where he served from May 28, 2019 until he moved to Customs and Border Protection. Early life and education Morgan was born on January 1, 1950. Morgan received a bachelor of science degree in engineering from Central Missouri State University. He joined the United States Marine Corps at the age of 19, and served active duty and reserve for a total of 10 years. Morgan received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City, serving as a deputy sheriff with the Platte County Sheriff's Department in Missouri, and in the Marine Corps Reserve concurrently with his studies. Career After graduating from law school, Morgan attended the Los Angeles Police Department Academy and served as a police officer with the Los Angeles Police Department.  FBI  Morgan as FBI Academy head in 2015 Morgan entered on duty as a Special Agent in 1996 and was assigned to the Los Angeles Field Office. While there, he was a member of the Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force, the Crisis Response Squad, and the Special Weapons and Tactics Team. In 2002, Morgan became a Supervisory Special Agent and served as a Crisis Management Coordinator in the Crisis Management Unit in the Critical Incident Response Group. In 2005, Morgan returned to Los Angeles, where he supervised an FBI-led Hispanic Gang Task Force that focused on the MS-13, and 18th Street gangs. While in Los Angeles, he also supervised the Critical Incident Response Squad, which had administrative and operational oversight of the division's critical incident response resources. In 2007, Morgan became assistant section chief of the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime Branch, where he managed the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Units and the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program. In 2008, he became the FBI's Deputy On-Scene Commander in Baghdad, Iraq, where he was responsible for all FBI personnel deployed to Iraq under the auspices of the Counterterrorism Division. This was his first deployment to a war zone. In 2009, Morgan was assigned as Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the New Haven Field Office. In 2010, Morgan became Chief of the FBI Strategic Information and Operations Center. From 2011 to 2013, Morgan served as the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI El Paso Division. During 2013 and 2014, Morgan served as Deputy Assistant Director for the FBI's Inspection Division, which performs compliance and oversight of all FBI operations. In 2014, Morgan served on a detail to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in the Department of Homeland Security as the Acting Assistant Commissioner for Internal Affairs. In this role, he oversaw the investigation of criminal and serious administrative misconduct by the CBP workforce. Morgan was assigned to this position after the previous Assistant Commissioner, James F. Tomsheck, was removed for failing to investigate allegations of inappropriate use of force by border agents, and CBP head Gil Kerlikowske took the unusual step of requesting an interim appointment from outside the agency to pursue investigations more aggressively. In 2014, he was appointed Assistant Director of the FBI for the Training Division in Quantico, Virginia, with responsibility for overseeing policy development and delivery of all law enforcement skills and academic programs for the FBI workforce. Department of Homeland Security Chief of U.S. Border Patrol Morgan in September 2016 In June 2016, he was named as the next chief of the U.S. Border Patrol by the Obama administration, and took command in July. Morgan was the first Chief of the Border Patrol to come from outside the agency, and was intended to be a reformer and increase accountability. The appointment was opposed by the Border Patrol's union, the National Border Patrol Council. His decision to wear the Border Patrol uniform was met with some opposition, as he had never been a Border Patrol officer. On December 1, 2016, Morgan stated in a Senate hearing that he supported a comprehensive immigration overhaul, which was met with strenuous criticism from the National Border Patrol Council. Morgan subsequently clarified that he did not support \\"blanket amnesty\\". On January 26, 2017, just days after President Donald Trump took office, he was forced to resign. He had reportedly desired to stay in his post during the Trump administration, internally criticizing the immigration enforcement policies of the Obama administration after the election.  Gap in government service  In January 2019, Morgan said that he could determine if an unaccompanied minor would become a member of MS-13, a transnational crime gang known for gruesome violence, just by looking at their eyes. Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement At the end of April 2019, it was reported that Trump was considering Morgan to take over as head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency's former acting director, Ronald Vitiello, resigned earlier in April after Trump pulled his nomination for the director's job, telling reporters that he wanted to go with someone \\"tougher\\" instead. On May 5, Trump announced on Twitter that he had chosen Morgan to become the next director of ICE. The Washington Post reported that the announcement \\"caught White House aides and Homeland Security officials by surprise. They had not been informed Morgan was Trump‚Äôs choice, and at ICE, senior leaders learned of the decision from the president‚Äôs tweet, according to two senior administration officials.\\" Matthew Albence, who had been acting director of ICE since April 2019 and was previously acting deputy director of the agency, continued in that role until Morgan was formally named acting director on May 28, 2019. He was formally appointed to a newly created position as Principal Deputy Director that outranked the preexisting Deputy Director position. This was criticized as avoiding Senate scrutiny for this position through the normal confirmation process. U.S. Customs and Border Protection  On June 27, 2019, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Morgan would become the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, replacing John Sanders, who had announced his resignation. On July 5, 2019, Morgan became acting commissioner. His formal appointment was as Chief Operating Officer of the agency. Since his appointment was never confirmed by the Senate and his tenure as acting commissioner exceeded 210 days, he can no longer legally lead the agency. To circumvent the law, his new title is \\"Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\\" In July 2020, Morgan sent CBP agents dressed in camouflage and tactical gear to Portland, Oregon, where federal agents repeatedly used tear gas and projectile munitions on protestors and shot one peaceful protestor in the face, fracturing his face. Agents also used unmarked vehicles to detain protestors, without identifying themselves as law enforcement. Legal observers called this \\"abduction\\" and \\"kidnapping\\". Oregon Governor Kate Brown described the actions as \\"abuse of power,\\" and accused DHS of \\"provoking confrontation for political purposes.\\" Portland mayor Ted Wheeler said it was \\"an attack on our democracy.\\" Morgan alleged the protestors were \\"violent criminals\\" and defended the practice of CBP officers having no names on their uniforms. The New York Times reported that an internal DHS memo prepared by the top official at DHS prior to the deployment stated that the federal agents in question had not been specifically trained in riot control or mass demonstrations. Tom Ridge, the first head of the Department of Homeland Security, sharply criticized the deployment, saying ‚ÄùThe department was established to protect America from the ever-present threat of global terrorism. It was not established to be the president‚Äôs personal militia.‚Äù Ridge, the former governor of Pennsylvania, added that it would be a ‚Äúcold day in hell‚Äù before he would have consented as a governor to what is taking place. {cite news |last1=Hagerman |first1=Maggie |title=Trump‚Äôs Actions in Portland Mesh With His Political Message |url=Trump‚Äôs Actions in Portland Mesh With His Political Message |accessdate=22 July 2020 |publisher=New York Times |date=22 July 2020}} Morgan defended the deployment of officers in military-style uniforms in unmarked in a press conference on July 21, saying they had identifying numbers on their shoulders. But former Trump administration DHS spokesman Col.

The film also features a new Ultraman known as . The movie is set in the world of Ultraman Dyna, taking place 15 years after the series and features much of the supporting cast returning. A selection of members from the idol group AKB48 has been chosen to portray the characters of Team-U, a special monster attack team part of the fictional Earth Defense Force. In its first week in theaters, Ultraman Saga opened at the #4 spot in the Japanese box offices, about 166,006 people in 369 screens with a budget of ¬•143,747,300. Plot The film opens with a powerful apocalyptic vision of Tokyo, buildings destroyed and the city seemingly devoid of life. We are soon introduced to the Earth Defense Force (EDF), Team U (played by members of the female idol group AKB48), who go on a shopping raid in a desolate store in the city. During their raid, Team U is attacked by the monster, Earthtron. Despite their setup traps and weapons assisting them, they are no match for the monster. As the monster rampages, Ultraman Dyna appears and quickly destroys Earthtron. Meanwhile, in the alternate universe in which he defeated Ultraman Belial, Ultraman Zero receives a distress call from an unknown voice as he is battling a hoard of Legionoids and proceeds into the multiverse after making quick work of the robots. Upon arriving to the universe where he received the distress signal, he goes towards the Earth in aid, which is revealed to be the same universe in while Ultraman Dyna took place. Shortly before Zero departs, the hosts and Human forms of Ultraman, Seven, Jack, Ace and Leo comment on something unusual taking place in the multiverse, referring to the universe in which Zero is headed for. Taking place 15 years after Shin Asuka (Ultraman Dyna) disappeared through a black hole at the series's ending, Earth has since then set up a space station on Mars in Asuka's honor and memory. The space station is then attacked by a few Granspheres, only for the invaders to quickly be fended off by a young defense team pilot named Taiga. Shortly after recklessly pursuing the Granspheres, Taiga is trapped (along with a few other Granspheres) inside of a Fortress-like Ship of an invading alien force, that quickly disappears. Taiga soon finds himself in the apocalyptic version of Tokyo, as Ultraman Zero battles the fleet of spaceships that were released by the Fortress. As Taiga notices a crashing ship heading straight towards a young boy, he pilots his ship directly into its path in an act of self- sacrifice. Witnessing his brave actions, Ultraman Zero rescues Taiga and joins with him. Once Taiga reawakens, he discovers that Ultraman Zero saved him and is not happy to be joined with the Ultra. Trying to dismiss and expel the Ultra from his body, Taiga and the boy are attacked by another monster named Gubira. As Taiga tries to keep the boy and himself from getting harmed, Gubira is confronted by another Ultraman, Ultraman Cosmos. After a relatively short fight, Cosmos manages to calm down Gubira and the monster leaves the deserted city peacefully. Shortly after encountering Ultraman Cosmos's human host, Musashi Haruno, both Ultras and the boy named Takeru are picked by Team U and taken to their base, which is revealed to be a warehouse full of children. Taiga and Musashi learn that Team U and the children are the last survivors on planet Earth after the world was invaded by an evil alien known as Alien Bat, who was revealed to have abducted all life on Earth, including nearly the entire human population. Shortly after the introductions, Alien Bat reveals himself to the survivors and unleashed Gubira and the monster, Gomess to attack them. With the help of Ultraman Cosmos and Ultraman Zero (the latter being only 5 meters tall due to Taiga's stubborn participation), the monsters are turned gentle once again, only to be murdered in cold blood by Alien Bat for failing him. Alien Bat then announces to the survivors that they will all be killed by his greatest weapon: Zetton. As Taiga and Musashi bond with Team U and the children, it is revealed that the reason for Taiga's general dislike towards Ultraman is due to his parents being killed by accident during one of Ultraman Dyna's fights against a monster, thus forcing him to live a very lonely lifestyle growing up. It is also revealed by Team U that Ultraman Dyna and his human host Asuka had once stayed with the team and protected them, but was lost in battle against Alien Bat's Zetton. The next day Alien Bat reveals his customized Zetton and what remains of Ultraman Dyna, who has been turned to stone. With his creation complete, Alien Bat unleashes Zetton onto Team U and the survivors, destroying their shelter and leaving them all in despair. In their depression, Team U is exposed as being frauds, not associated with Earth's Defense Force but instead are a group of amateur mechanics who took it upon themselves to protect the surviving children by lying to them. Touched by Team U's bravery, and now realizing the seriousness of the situation this Earth is in, Taiga sets aside his differences with Ultraman and transforms into Ultraman Zero, where he and Cosmos head off to destroy Zetton. Arriving at the Zetton's birthplace, Zero and Cosmos manage to hold off against the monster, but Alien Bat's Zetton is too big in size and strength for the combined Ultras to stop him. During the crossfire Cosmos is knocked out of commission, leaving Zero to face the Zetton by himself. With the Ultra fighting Zetton, Team U and Takeru arrive to help him when Takeru digs up the object that can revive Ultraman Dyna, Dyna's Reflasher. Despite some interference by Zetton, the Reflasher reunites with the statue of Dyna and Ultraman Dyna is revived to assist Zero and Cosmos, (whom had been revived by Dyna and Zero) in destroying Alien Bat's Zetton. However just as it seems the Zetton has been defeated, Alien Bat merges both his fortress and himself with the remains of the Zetton to reveal his creation's true form: Hyper Zetton. Now with enhanced speed and power, Hyper Zetton easily defeats the three Ultras, leaving the group of heroes hopeless in stopping the crazed alien and his weapon. Unwilling to give up their home and the lives of their friends, Taiga, Musashi, and Asuka merge to form a new Ultraman known as \\"Ultraman Saga\\". Ultraman Saga confronts Hyper Zetton, but both Ultra and Monster's abilities are evenly matched with both combatants unable to best each other. Motivated by the Ultra, Team U assists Saga when the battle is taken to the deserted city. Leading Hyper Zetton to a trap that was set for Earthtron, Ultraman Saga takes advantage of the distraction by slicing off Hyper Zetton's wings, the source of Hyper Zetton's abilities. With Hyper Zetton crippled, Ultraman Saga takes the monster into the Earth's Atmosphere and finally destroys it and Alien Bat with an energy-powered punch. With Alien Bat and his Zetton destroyed, all those abducted by the alien return to Earth to live their lives in peace. The children reunite with their parents, Musashi returns to his home planet on Juran, Asuka returns to his home dimension briefly to inform his old teammates on Taiga's status and says that he will wait for them catch up to him before resuming his journey through space, and Taiga remain on Earth to live with Team U. Feeling confident that Taiga is ready to protect the Earth with Team U, Ultraman Zero separates from him and returns to his own universe.

Prominent among the supporting players were Colleen Moore, Marjorie Daw, Pat O'Malley, and Noah Beery. Together with the African American Aaron Mitchell and the Chinese-American Walter Chung, Barry creates the prototype of the multi-ethnic baby gang which will serve as a model for the successful series of Our Gang (1922‚Äì44) and in other feature films like Little Annie Rooney (1925) with Mary Pickford.Gevinson, Alan. Within Our Gates: Ethnicity in American Feature Films, 1911-1960, University of California Press, 1997. The film is extant, archived in the Filmmuseum in Amsterdam. Plot In a village in the Irish woods, young Doreen Adair (Colleen Moore) falls in love with a young man, Danny O'Sullivan (Tom Gallery). One day, Danny receives notice that he is offered a job in America. Before leaving, he marries Doreen. A year later, a son is born, and Doreen decides to follow her husband to America. Upon arriving in San Francisco from Ireland, Doreen discovers through Danny's landlady Mrs. O'Toole (Kate Price) that her husband has been killed in a car accident. To support herself and her infant son Dinty, Doreen labors night shifts as a scrub woman until, at the age of twelve, Dinty (Wesley Barry) becomes the family's breadwinner by selling newspapers, forming his own street gang with other children. Doreen, meanwhile, suffers from tuberculosis and gets weaker by the day. Meanwhile, in Chinatown, when Judge Whitely (J. Barney Sherry) imprisons the son of opium smuggler Wong Tai (Noah Beery), Wong Tai retaliates by kidnapping the judge's daughter (Marjorie Daw). Dinty, whose work as a newsboy has familiarized him with the Chinese underworld, leads police to Wong Tai's hideout and saves the judge's daughter from a bizarre death by torture. As Dinty's mother has succumbed to tuberculosis, the grateful Judge Whitely adopts Dinty.

Neilan used the character to create a story in a similar vein as a starring vehicle for Barry, who was being groomed by the studio. Moore, on loan from Christie Film Company, would sign a lucrative contract with Neilan when production for Dinty was completed. Anna May Wong appeared in an uncredited role that also led to more work with Neilan; after Dinty, he created a role for her in Bits of Life for which she earned her first screen credit. Portions of the film were shot on location in San Francisco including Chinatown and Adolph B. Spreckels' Spreckels Mansion. The end of the film was shot on location on Catalina Island. Sets were designed by Ben Carr√©. Release Released November 29, 1920, Dinty was successful. A booklet on Wesley Barry's life was put out concurrently, part of the movie's promotional strategy. Neilan also used the release of Dinty to debut a campaign to improve the artistic quality of film stills. Reviews of the film were generally favorable. The Dramatic Mirror called it \\"a photoplay of remarkable direction, excellent acting ... and perfect photography\\". The reviewer for Motion Picture News wrote: \\"There are enough elements in this feature to please every type of picturegoer.\\" Positive reviews appeared in trade papers Variety, Wid's, and the Exhibitors Herald. Some of the positive reviews were conditional. The Photoplay reviewer commented that Neilan's \\"human touch ... however obvious and conventional it may become, is usually effective\\". The New York Times critic noted the \\"deliberateness\\" that led to a deficiency in \\"genuineness\\", especially in the dramatic and action scenes.

The game was originally released in November 2013 in CIS countries, North America and Europe. It was relaunched as World of Warplanes 2.0 in October 2017 in the same countries, achieving significantly better reception.  Gameplay  World of Warplanes gameplay World of Warplanes (or \\"WoWp\\" for short) features over 100 aircraft, namely military and experimental aircraft from Germany, the Soviet Union, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and China. It allows players to choose from 5 main warplane classes: fighters, multirole fighters, heavy fighters, ground attack planes, and bombers. In addition to this, Premium aircraft are also available. Each nation's tech tree introduces squadrons of planes ranging from Tier I entry- level 1930s biplanes all the way up to Tier X late 1940s jet-powered aircraft. All warplanes can be unlocked and upgraded through a continued gameplay progression. It is possible to upgrade your aircraft with various weapons, engines, equipment, and consumables. The game features 4635 possible aircraft configurations, which along with customisation options, such as camouflage, allows the player to create planes that are uniquely configured with specific needs in mind, such as increased speed or ruggedness. Battles in World of Warplanes unfold at dozens of unique maps, most of which are based on real- world landscapes. Unlike similar games in the genre, World of Warplanes does not feature limited ammunition in-game, instead implementing a system where bombs and rockets have cool-downs before they can be reused, and overuse of guns results in overheating, limiting the rate of fire and accuracy of overheated guns. Aircraft of each class in the same tier vary in flight characteristics and firepower across nations. For example, a Soviet or a Japanese fighter of the same tier will be more horizontally maneuverable than its German or American counterpart but would have limited vertical manoeuvrability and would be more fragile. WoWp features an aircraft comparison system to assist players in understanding the differences in capabilities between different aircraft. The official website has a History of Aviation section, where one can find additional information on specific planes. Available tech trees expand as development continues on WoWp. New nations and additional aircraft for each nation‚Äôs tech tree have been gradually introduced post-launch.World of Warplanes F.A.Q.Worldofwarplanes.com. Retrieved 2013-11-06.  Game modes  The basic game features mixed PvP/PvE combat sessions in two basic scenarios: Training Room and Standard Battles. A separate tutorial intro mode covers game fundamentals over a series of lessons. Training Mode is a sandbox environment for new players and teams, helping them test tactics, new planes, and practice shooting at static and flying targets. No experience or credits are earned in training mode. In Standard Battles, the only mode in which players can earn credits and experience points necessary to unlock more ingame content, players must destroy all enemy aircraft or achieve air superiority by destroying more enemy ground objects and airplanes. With patch 1.9.0's release in October 2015, bots were introduced into Standard Battles in an attempt to provide more balanced battles for players, as WoWp suffered from a chronic lack of players. In essence, this means that unlike most Wargaming titles there is effectively no real player-versus-player mode as players must fight against and alongside bots even in Standard Battles. As of Update 2.0, respawning has been added into WoWp, thus further differentiating WoWp from other Wargaming titles, which often do not feature respawning. The primary game mode has been changed to 'Conquest', in which two teams of opposing players accumulate points by capturing territories on the game map, which can be accomplished by destroying enemy aircraft or ground fortifications within capture zones. Different capture zones have different effects on gameplay. For example, the 'Airfield' and the 'Military Base' zones both help to accumulate points towards a team's score, but differ in function. 'Airfield' zones provide an extra spawn point for players, reducing travel times for players occupying 'Airfield' zones. 'Military Base' zones also routinely bombard enemy zones with rockets, enabling faster capture of enemy zones. When a team has earned a noticeable point advantage, players would be warned in advance of the 'squall line' event, wherein players can no longer respawn upon being shot down. The victor of the game is the team that has accumulated more points in the time limit of the game, or when all enemy players are permanently killed after the arrival of the 'squall line' gameplay event. Players are graded on their performance in battle via a personal score, which increases when players carry out activities specific to their aircraft type in battle. For example, fighters earn more personal points when engaging in manoeuvring combat with other fighters and bombers earn more personal points by destroying ground targets. A higher personal score generally reflects a greater skill on the part of the player, and higher-scoring players earn more in-game credits and experience than their poorer-scoring teammates. Medals and awards are also provided to players who accomplish specific tasks in battle, such as shooting down a certain number of enemy aircraft while under a time limit. Consumable items are awarded to players who earn medals, and an in-game tracker maintains a record of the medals that a player has earned in-game.  Economic system  The economic system in World of Warplanes is similar to World of Tanks and other Wargaming titles. The game features four primary types of in-game currency: credits, experience, tokensWorldOfWarplanes.eu Portal Tokens in World of Warplanes Wargaming.net 2016-03-29, Retrieved 2016-07-08.

New Game Mode\\" was released on World of Warplanes official YouTube channel, signalling the release of World of Warplanes 2.0. It features an updated and revamped version of the game, including a reworked gameplay system and an upgrade to the game's graphics. With the World of Warplanes 2.0 release came a new publishing and marketing team. In 2018, they began working with British metal band Iron Maiden and their lead singer Bruce Dickinson. WoWp obtained a music license from Sanctuary Records for the iconic track \\"Aces High\\". WoWp remade the Aces High music video using the game's graphics engine and shared and promoted it on WoWp websites, Facebook groups and YouTube channels. WoWp also made an exclusive Iron Maiden Spitfire plane which was available for free in game through Jun-Aug 2018 to synch with the band's Legacy of the Beast European tour. There was an Iron Maiden themed hangar and special events during the same time period. As well as being the singer for Iron Maiden, Bruce Dickinson is a pilot and military aviation history buff who regularly captains Iron Maiden's converted charter aeroplane, Ed Force One, during their world tours, and still runs an aircraft maintenance and pilot training company. Bruce agreed to be an ambassador for WoWp and made himself available to film a series of WoWp video diaries at Hendon RAF Museum.  Reception  The original World of Warplanes received mixed to negative reviews and held a Metacritic score of 69 out of 100. In March 2016, Wargaming CEO Viktor Kislyi acknowledged in an interview that World of Warplanes had failed to meet expectations saying, \\"...we can't call that a success.\\" It was with this in mind that significant changes were made in the development team and the new 2.0 version made. The release of World of Warplanes 2.0 received generally positive reviews, and received a score of 8 in a review on Gamereactor from Marco Vrolijk, with the implementation of the respawn mechanic (which had been absent in previous versions of World of Warplanes), the introduction of the 'Conquest' gamemode and the upgraded graphics being praised the most. However, Vrolijk noted that the game was not suited for simulator enthusiasts. James Barber from military.com commented that WoWP 2.0 had ‚Äúbetter graphics, bigger explosions\\" and was \\"a lot more fun to play\\". Inside-Indie scored it at 88%.

Unlike other series of its kind, Saimum not only thrills its readers but also provides various informative and educative stuff. But above all, it stimulates into the mind of its reader the sense of morality and gradually makes them think to work for the betterment of humanity and peace. It also helps the readers to gain knowledge of History, geography and culture of many countries. Particularly the History of Islam, the geography of Muslim countries, the territories where they live in and their cultures. A reader can know about the present condition of Islam in the world. Abul Asad starts Saimum on 1976 with Operation Tel Aviv (). About Abul Asad (‡¶Ü‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶≤ ‡¶Ü‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶¶) The author of Saimum Series, Abul Asad, was born on 5 August 1942, at the village Narashinghpur in Rajshahi, Bangladesh. He started writing articles and stories since he was a student of Class 9. Gradually he became involved in journalism. He continued his studies with the activities of a journalist. He passed MS in economics. Now he is the editor of The Daily Sangram. He is also a member of Bangla Shahitta Parishad. All the books of the Saimum Series are published from Bangla Shahitta Parishad. He wrote many other books as well, including Kalo Panchisher Age O Pore () and Amra Sei Se Jati (). Plot of Saimum Series Ahmad Musa is the protagonist of the series. We come to know about his past in the first book of the series. He once had a family. He used to live with them in Sinkiang, a state of China. As they were Muslims, they were attacked by China Military. Many people died in there and many fled out of Sinkiang. But most of them, including his parents and his brother, were killed on the way. At first, they decided to cross the border of China and go to Tibet. But they found that the Tibetan border is sealed, therefore they decided to go to Afghanistan, crossing Himalayas. When they crossed the ice-covered Himalayas, only 850 persons of them were alive among the whole fifty-thousand people. Then we are introduced to his new identity; he is the most discussed person and the headache of the imperialistic power, the central gem of the Saimum. Saimum is an organization working for oppressed people and against the imperialistic power. Ahmad Musa is also a preacher of Islam, the religion of peace. His faith in his Creator Allah and always does his best to fulfil the responsibility that Allah has given him. Most of the times he risks his life in order to carry out this immense duty. Some of his great contributions are: * He and Saimum were responsible for the independence of Palestine from Israel. * He stopped a great conspiracy of wiping out Muslims from Mindanao, a small island near Philippine. * He made possible the creation of a new Muslim country in Central-Asia. * He went to the Caucasus to stop Muslims from being killed by a Christian terrorist group, named White Wolves. * He contributed to C√≥rdoba and ceased the fearsome terrorism of Ku Klux Klan. There, he also brought to an end the misery of the Muslims (Moriscos) who were oppressed and were persecuted by the extremist Christians. * He went to France to stop the historical Muslim structures from being demolished. * He fought against a terrorist group called Black Cross. * He brought to light a horrifying conspiracy of wiping out Muslims from Africa. * He went to Russia to end a formidable intrigue related to Czar. * He went to the Turks and Caicos Islands island in North America to stop an extremist group from terminating the Muslim young men. * A great conspiracy of Ariel Sharon, the founder of a Zionist terrorist group in the United States, was brought to light by him. * He unravelled the secret of kidnapping the seven famous detectives of Sputnik, a Muslim detective firm in Europe. He rescued them and moreover, he solved the mystery of the destruction of the World Trade Center. * He stopped the conspiracy of wiping out Muslims from Suriname, a country of South America. * He went to Andaman, a small island of India to save the minority Muslims from getting killed. Besides, he also rescued the Mughal Prince Ahmad Shah Alamgir, who was getting tormented by the Hindus. He had been to Suriname, Pattani, Thailand, Armenia, Germany, Polynesian Islands and numerous other countries to retrieve and rescue the oppressed people, namely the minority Muslims. Ahmad Musa was first engaged to Fatima Farhana, an Uzbek girl. But unfortunately he was kidnapped a night before their wedding, and Farhana was woefully murdered by his kidnappers. A few months later, he married Maily Guly, who had been an actress in Central Asia. She was from a Muslim Uyghur background; her name was originally Amina Guly. She returned to her faith when she met Ahmad Musa. After their marriage, the same day, Ahmad Musa went on to another mission. Ahmad Musa learned about his wife, Amina, is missing or she had been abducted. He fulfilled his mission in Spain and finally met Amina in his captured condition. The intention of the enemies was to kill Ahmad Musa. Amina was martyred saving Ahmad Musa. Later he was married to Maria Josephine, a princess of the prominent Bourbon family, who is also an heir to the French Louise Family. Maria converted to Islam after getting mesmerized by the essence of this religion. They had a son named Ahmad Abdullah. Maria Josephine and Ahmad Abdullah were about to be kidnapped in America, but the FBI averted the kidnappers' plans from being successful. Before leaving the United States, Ahmad Musa married Sara Jefferson. She was a descendant of Thomas Jefferson, a Founding Father of the United States. She had also converted to Islam by getting engrossed in it. Sara fell in love with Ahmad Musa when he was on a mission in America. She significantly helped Ahmad Musa during his mission in Turkey. When the alliance of Ahmad and Sara arose, Ahmad Musa at first hesitated to marry her. But later, when Maria Josephine expressed her disappointments for not doing any justice to Sara Jefferson and made it coherent to him that Islam allows a second marriage with certain conditions, Ahmad Musa agreed and wedded her. Subsequently, Ahmad Musa travelled to Armenia to help the oppressed people.

Its format was general music from the 1950s-onwards, drama plays, comedy series, documentaries and children's interests. Toodyay Community Radio was established in 2010 under the name Toodyay Community Radio Inc. Assoc. and commenced broadcasting at 9am on Friday, 3 December 2010. It was a volunteer run organisation and was listener funded. Programming Toodyay Community Radio had a comprehensive schedule and played a mix of Rock and Roll, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s music, Disco and Club Classic music as well as many Drama plays, comedy series and documentaries. Part of its commitment to the community was supporting local music and the arts. Jukebox Radio Being a community radio station, and therefore relying on volunteers, Toodyay didn't want to be prone to the same problems facing other community radio stations, where the availability of its volunteers and presenters could be unpredictable. Toodyay Community Radio turned itself over to its listeners during the day, and overnight, by allowing them to access part of the station's music library through the station's website, and to request the music that they wanted to hear. This service differed greatly from request services offered by other radio stations, in that other stations allow listeners to email the station, and a request gets assigned to the next appropriate program. Toodyay's Jukebox Radio allowed the listener's request to enter into a queue to be played in order, just like a jukebox. Ties with Toodyay District High School Toodyay Community Radio was involved in many projects with the local community, but had close ties with Toodyay District High School. In 2011, the Year 9 and 10 Drama students were involved in recording an updated version of the drama play 'Six From Borneo' that was originally broadcast on ABC radio in 1947. The play tells the story of over 2000 prisoners of war, held by the Japanese in Sandakan, North Borneo during World War II. The play, quite dramatically, tells the story of the Sandakan Death Marches that the prisoners were taken on, and how only six POW's survived by escaping. All six to escape were Australian Soldiers. The story is very poignant to Toodyay, as three brothers from the town were killed on these death marches. The play went into production in May 2011 and was recorded by Toodyay Community Radio and was broadcast on Remembrance day 2011. A CD of the play was produced and was presented to members involved with the production. A copy is held at the National Sound Archives of Australia.

They became involved with power generation projects, starting with hydroelectric plants of the late 19th-century that led to building and operating electric streetcar systems in a number of cities across the United States. As well as industrial plants, they built the 50-storey General Electric building in New York City, the Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh, a landmark now listed in the National Register of Historic Places, as well as buildings for Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Stone & Webster was the prime contractor for the electromagnetic separation plant for the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

In 1851, another school building replaced the old one and was built on the Thomas Guest property (now Dorbrook Farm.)

Overview  Raphaele Shirley is a multi-media artist whose work spans installation art, light sculpture, video, art collectives, live performances and social intervention. Her work deals with questions of space, time, primordial life forces, and the ephemeral. Since her beginnings in New York City (1993), where she currently lives and works, she has been instrumental in the creation of several large-scale social projects such as [PAM] Perpetual Art Machine and the New York International Fringe Festival. She has been awarded several grants recently from the Norwegian arts council for commissioned public and video works. Several of the projects she has been involved in have received international acclaimed awards. She shows her work nationally and internationally. She has worked in collaboration with renowned artists and directors such as Aaron Beall, Karin Coonrod, Elaine Summers, Richard Foreman, Dino Lupelli, Randolph Curtis Rand and Gh Hovagimyan. For live performances she has collaborated with the following musicians: Rhys Chatham, David Watson, Peter Zummo, Kevin Shea, Laura Ortman, Algis Kizys, Vincent Signorelli, Lynn Wright, Eric Hubel, Katarina Raska and Anna Liisa Eller.  Early life  Raphaele Shirley is daughter of Hunter B. Shirley, the renowned psychologist and theoretician, and Anne Couelle from the French Couelle family, known for their reconstruction of churches, export of historical churches including part of the New York city Cloisters, stone quarry and architecture. She is the youngest of three children. She moved to Aix-en-Provence in her early teens and began to explore sculpture, photography and other art forms through elective art courses. In the early 90s, she enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux Arts of Aix-en-Provence, France.  Training  Between 1997 and 2002, she worked as a studio assistant for Nam June Paik, the US-based Korean artist and founder of video art, assisting him in the development with Norman Ballard of a number of public laser works displayed at the Olympic Park Lake in Seoul, Korea and in his Retrospective \\"The Worlds of Nam June Paik\\" at the S.R.Guggenheim, New York U.S.A. and Bilbao, Spain. She also participated in the construction, installation and take down of numerous of his CRT-based sculptures including \\"Tv Fish\\" ( Holly Soloman Gallery), \\"The Megatron\\" (The Smithsonian Museum of American Art), \\"Tv Garden\\" ( S.R. Guggenheim Museum ). Since 2005 she has been an active contributor for the restoration and preservation of Nam June Paik CRt based art works for Museums around the world. She has extended her efforts in collaboration with CTL Electronics Inc. to help museums and private collections in the restoration of numerous new media artworks of artists such as Bruce Nauman, Diana Thater, Gary Hill, Bill Viola, Robert Irwin to name a few. [edit]  Curator/Social Interventions  In 1997, Shirley was a founding member of The New York International Fringe Festival and co-directed Fringe Al Fresco up until 2001, which staged over 100 artists for the first two years of the festival in public locations all over the Lower East Side in New York. From 2002-2004, with director and impresario Aaron Beall, she founded the Times Square Arts Center, installed in the former notorious Adult entertainment center on 42nd and 8th avenue in New York called \\"Show World\\", where over 100 performances, screenings and installations were organized. In 2005 she co-founded the project [PAM] Perpetual Art Machine, an interactive installation and video art collective of over 2000 members and video artists.[PAM] presented over 50 exhibitions drawing from the video art collective worldwide.  Body of work  In 2008 Shirley began sculpting in pure light. Light Shot 0910 explores the spirituality of geometry through two mysterious rectangles of light intersecting in mid-air, shown in a solo exhibit at the Chelsea Art Museum. Shooting Stair uses light diodes and high-pressured mist to form a staircase made of light, installed outdoors in a private collection in Southampton, New York. Light and geography intersect powerfully with community in two recently commissioned public pieces which brought Shirley to Norway, the first a massive outdoor light sculpture, the second a film. Jewels of Kvinesdal, dramatically overlooking the Kvinesdal fjord, consists of an open-air arena from which a diagonal tower of light beams into the night sky, visible to communities many kilometers away. This installation was curated by Torill Haugen at the Utsikten Kunstsenter Art Center in Kvinesdal, Norway. Stargaze in Sandnes is a 14-minute film combining communal and geologic memory, past and future, utopia and dystopia, employing topographical maps, 3D animation, and old family films provided by the people of Sandnes, Norway. This project was funded by Norway's KinoKino Art center and the Norwegian Arts Council. Here work was shown alongside Gustave Deutsch and Bjorn Melhus' commissioned work. The exhibition was toured to The Museum of Moving Image in New York. During The Arctic Circle, a residency led by the FARM Foundation, Shirley created a series of immersive earth and light works while sailing the Arctic, documented in a series of photographic prints. Her Norway and Arctic expeditions were preceded by her similarly experiential ‚Äò‚ÄôSunken City‚Äô‚Äô projects. For these installations Shirley used silicone and bronze, bathed in lasers, fog and dense soundscapes, to create a language of architecture and urban space both ancient and futuristic, terrifying and utopian. These were exhibited in Basel, New York, and Brooklyn. Shirley solo and collaborative projects have also been exhibited at the KAI art center in Estonia,The Queens Museum, Museum of Moving Image, the former Chelsea Art Museum, New York, USA, the Moscow Biennale, New York, the Video Lounge at ArtBasel Miami 2006, and The State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg Russia.

It was started by Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet & Society in 2010, with financial support from the Alfred P.

History 2012 Project Steering Committee A steering committee led the planning phase of the DPLA initiative from inception through its launch in 2013. Members of the project's Steering Committee included Harvard University's Robert Darnton, Maura Marx, and John Palfrey; Paul Courant of University of Michigan, Carla Hayden then of Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library and subsequently the Librarian of Congress, Charles J. Henry of the US Council on Library and Information Resources, Luis Herrera of San Francisco Public Library, Susan Hildreth of the US government Institute of Museum and Library Services (who stepped down from the Steering Committee to avoid a conflict of interest related to funding from IMLS), Brewster Kahle, Michael A. Keller of Stanford University, Carl Malamud, consultant Deanna B. Marcum, Jerome McGann, Dwight McInvaill of Georgetown County Library in South Carolina, Peggy Rudd of the Texas State Library and Archives Commission, Amy Ryan of the Boston Public Library, David Spadafora of the Newberry Library in Chicago, and Doron Weber of the Sloan Foundation. Others working on the project included Harvard University's David Weinberger. Critiques Critiques of the project during its planning phase included: its vagueness, lack of internal cohesion, potentially redundant overlap with similar efforts (such as Project Gutenberg), and potential to redirect financial support away from existing public libraries. It has been suggested that in contrast to the brick-and- mortar public library, a digital public library may not be suitable for providing adult literacy training or fostering young children's cognitive development. Some public librarians have also expressed a concern that a national digital library will divert and reduce traditional public library funding, which received a fast response from the DPLA. According to Peggy Rudd, a member of the Steering Committee, \\"the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies passed a resolution at their May 11, 2011 meeting asking the steering committee to reconsider the name Digital Public Library of America, fearing that the inclusion of the word 'public' would have the unintended consequence of giving local governments the excuse to reduce public library funding\\". Projects discussed in planning phase Participants in the planning phase of the DPLA established a publicly accessible wiki which outlines \\"workstreams\\" (\\"Audience and Participation,\\" \\"Content and Scope,\\" \\"Financial/Business Models,\\" \\"Governance,\\" \\"Legal Issues,\\" \\"Technical Aspects\\") and corresponding listserves. A proposed future project of the DPLA is the idea of the Scannebago, a mobile scanning unit that would travel the United States in order to digitize and curate local historical materials. Harvard University staff, led by project's managing director Maura Marx and principal investigator John Palfrey, coordinated a broad-based team that built the DPLA's digital library platform, which launched on April 18, 2013. In June 2013, the DPLA announced a partnership with HathiTrust to provide access to the latter's digital materials.

Birth controversy Per√≥n's date and place of birth (October 8, 1895, in Lobos) are disputed by recent investigations by Hip√≥lito Barreiro, who suggests October 7, 1893, in Roque P√©rez.Galasso, p. 21 Juan Domingo Per√≥n was the son of Mario Tom√°s Per√≥n and Juana Sosa. Their first son was Avelino Mario, born on November 30, 1891, in Lobos. Mario and Juana began to cohabitate the following year, in a house built in Roque P√©rez (a small village near Lobos). They had a new son on October 7, 1893, named Juan, but they did not report the birth in Lobos. Mario reported his birth on October 8, 1895, as if Juan had been born the previous day. He added the middle name \\"Domingo\\" after the late Dominga Dutey de Per√≥n, Juan's paternal grandmother. Oddly enough, the birth certificate reports only Juan's father, and not his mother.Galasso, pp. 21-22 Mario and Juana were not married, and their relationship was not stable. In 1894 Mario acknowledged only Avelino as his natural son, and Juan was baptized in 1895 as the son of Juana, without mention of Mario. Mario and Juana finally got married on September 25, 1901, and acknowledged both Avelino and Juan as their natural sons.Galasso, p. 22 Juan Domingo Per√≥n attended elementary school without problems, despite his complex legal situation. However, his grandmother feared in 1910 that he would not be accepted by the military school. Under the highly strict social customs of the time, an illegitimate son would not be accepted by the military, nor a child with indigenous ancestry. Juana Sosa was the daughter of a Tehuelche father and a Quechua mother. So, with the help of social relations of her late husband, she forged a birth certificate that would allow Juan to pass the requirements.Galasso, pp. 22-24 Military career Per√≥n passed the exams to join the National Military College by the end of 1910, and was accepted by March 1911. He had no problems adapting to military discipline. The Argentine army was highly Germanophile. This influence began about 1904 (predating the World Wars) and was not based on a rejection of democracy but an admiration of German military history. By his first year in college Per√≥n chose the infantry. He began boxing training as well, besides his military career, but he gave up after a bad punch injured the metacarpal bones in his hand.Galasso, pp. 43-47 There were political discussions in Argentina by this time about the implementation of universal suffrage, promoted by the Radical Civic Union and resisted by the governments, until it was sanctionEd by the S√°enz Pe√±a Law in 1912. It is unknown whether Per√≥n had specific political views about these topics, but the usual isolation of military service, his weak family relations and the unlikely political concerns of his grandmother and aunts (as few women were concerned about politics at that time), suggest that Per√≥n would focus his mind only on military topics. He distrusted the lessons of history, as he noticed that it focused on circumstantial details about Jos√© de San Mart√≠n's life as a moral example, but did not analyze his reasons for leaving South America and spending his last years in Europe.Galasso, pp. 48-49 Basic training ended in 1913, with a military exercise conducted near Concordia, Entre R√≠os. The exercise was organized by Agust√≠n Pedro Justo and generated a press scandal as he left the army stationed in the open during the summer noon day sun. Half the recruits fainted of heatstroke, eventually the formation gave up the exercise and took the fainted recruits to Concordia's hospital. Per√≥n became a sub lieutenant on December 18, 1913, and was assigned to Regiment 12 in Parana.Galasso, p. 49 He was promoted to lieutenant in December 1915, and Regiment 12 moved to Santa Fe, serving under Bartolom√© Descalzo. He voted for Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen in the 1916 presidential elections. He was appointed to the Esteban de Luca Unit in 1918, in Buenos Aires.Galasso, p. 54 Tragic week There was a massive riot in January 1919 in Buenos Aires, known as the Tragic Week. A large number of anarchist workers started the riot, which was fought by both the police and the army. Historians disagree on Per√≥n's precise role during these events: peronist historians try to negate, conceal or justify his intervention, and antiperonist historians view it as contradictory with his future ideas. The peronist Enrique Pav√≥n Pereyra wrote that Per√≥n was located in Santa Fe province at the time and moved to Buenos Aires by mid 1919, and thus was absent from the events. However, his military records date his return to Buenos Aires in 1918 and his return to Santa Fe in February 1919, after the riots. The antiperonist Tom√°s Eloy Mart√≠nez conducted an interview with Per√≥n that confirmed his intervention, but only used the supply of ammunition that was present. Mart√≠nez had a later interview with Vicente Carlos Alo√©, governor of Buenos Aires Province during Per√≥n's second presidency, suggesting that Per√≥n was actively involved in the repression. However, Mart√≠nez did not check the validity of Alo√©'s claims. Alo√© was not a direct witness of the event, nor knew Per√≥n until years later.Galasso, pp. 56-58 As a military man, it was unlikely that Per√≥n supported the rioters, because anarchism calls for the disestablishment of the government and the armed forces, and rejects nationalism. However, he made sympathetic comments about the riot years later, but rejected the anarchist or communist affiliation of the rioters and considered them as mere workers.Galasso, pp. 58-59 Contact with labour conflicts Per√≥n returned to Regiment 12 in Santa Fe the following February. There were labour conflicts at the north of the province, where the British Forestal Land, Timber and Railways Company faced the first local strike action. Employees asked for better wages, the end of unjustified dismissal, and an eight-hour workday. The company rallied a band of thugs to attack the strikers, arranged blackouts, cut the water supply, and closed the single warehouse in the area. When Per√≥n arrived there the laborers explained the events going on. He then met with the warehouse owner, who refused to open it, claiming that the timber company was the only authority in the area; so Per√≥n resorted to a death threat in order to have the warehouse opened.Galasso, pp. 59-60 There was a new strike in December 1919. Although Per√≥n also mediated that conflict, the details of his intervention are unknown. He returned to Buenos Aires in 1920, as a first lieutenant. He was assigned to Santiago del Estero.Galasso, pp. 61-62 Sargento Cabral school Per√≥n joined the Sargento Cabral Military School on January 16, 1920, with good qualifications. He was paternalistic towards the soldiers under his command. He wrote many chapters of the Applicant's Manual which was published by the army in 1924, and was his first published work. He was promoted to captain in December 1924, and Commander of the First Company of Infantry in 1925. In his spare time, he enjoyed practicing swordsmanship, polo and basketball.Galasso, pp. 65-67 First wife Per√≥n's first wife was Aurelia Tiz√≥n, a school teacher. When they met Per√≥n was aged 30 and Aurelia 17. Her middle-class family belonged to the Radical Civic Union. She was highly religious, and had interests in the English and French languages, geography, history and the arts. Per√≥n took her to see movies and visited her family house, their relation helped him to reduce the machismo influence of his military life.Galasso, p. 68 Peron continued both his military career, his history studies, and his romantic relation with Aurelia. Mario Per√≥n, who was very ill, moved from Patagonia to Buenos Aires with Juana, and Juan Per√≥n moved to live with his parents during their last years. By this time Per√≥n was engaged to Aurelia. Mario died on November 10, 1928 a few days before Juan and Aurelia's wedding. They married in a private ceremony on January 5, 1929. Juana returned to Patagonia with her son Mario Avelino (who visited Buenos Aires for his father's funeral); Juan Per√≥n would have little contact with them afterwards. Juan and Aurelia had a brief honeymoon in Bariloche, and returned to Buenos Aires.Galasso, pp. 68-71 Infamous Decade Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen was elected for a second term as President in 1928. He was supported by the poor people, and rejected by the conservatives and the press. In January 1929 Per√≥n became an appointed official under the command of Francisco Fasola Casta√±o. Per√≥n and Casta√±o made a trip to visit to the Andes in Patagonia. When he returned Yrigoyen was facing an even greater political crisis fostered by the economic crisis caused by the Great Depression of the United States. The army began to plot against Yrigoyen, and Per√≥n was invited to the discussions by √Ångel Solari. Solari was aligned with Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu, one of the heads of the Argentine military in these years, the other being Agust√≠n Pedro Justo. Per√≥n had a positive view of Uriburu, but did not trust some of Uriburu's allies and feared that the military plot had no clear ideas nor notable support (hardly more than 20 members of the top military). In later years he would completely regret his role in the military plot, pointing out that prior to this he had only focused on his military career, and that most of the military joined in it solely out of obedience to orders from superior officers.Galasso, pp. 73-75 Bibliography * References Category:Juan Per√≥n Peron, Juan Domingo ","title":"Early life of Juan Per√≥n"},{"id":"32428639","text":"Deglaciation describes the transition from full glacial conditions during ice ages, to warm interglacials, characterized by global warming and sea level rise due to change in continental ice volume. Thus, it refers to the retreat of a glacier, an ice sheet or frozen surface layer, and the resulting exposure of the Earth's surface. The decline of the cryosphere due to ablation can occur on any scale from global to localized to a particular glacier. After the Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 21,000 years ago), the last deglaciation begun, which lasted until the early Holocene. Around much of Earth, deglaciation during the last 100 years has been accelerating as a result of climate change, partly brought on by anthropogenic changes to greenhouse gases. The previous deglaciation took place between approximately 22ka until 11.5ka. This occurred when there was an annual mean atmospheric temperature on the earth that increased by roughly 5 ¬∞C, which was also accompanied by regional high- latitude warming that exceeded 10 ¬∞C. This was also followed by noteworthy deep-sea and tropical-sea warming, between about 1-2 ¬∞C (deep-sea) and 2-4 ¬∞C (tropical sea). Not only did this warming occur, but the global hydrological budget also experienced noticeable changes and regional precipitation patterns changed. As a result of all of this, the world's main ice sheets, including the ones located in Eurasia, North America and parts of the Antarctic melted. As a consequence, sea levels rose roughly 120 metres. These processes did not occur steadily, and they also did not occur at the same time. Background The process of deglaciation reflects a lack of balance between existing glacial extent and climatic conditions. As a result of net negative mass balance over time, glaciers and ice sheets retreat. The repeated periods of increased and decreased extent of the global cryosphere (as deduced from observations of ice and rock cores, surface landforms, sub-surface geologic structures, the fossil record, and other methods of dating) reflect the cyclical nature of global and regional glaciology measured by ice ages and smaller periods known as glacials and interglacials. Since the end of the Last glacial period about 12,000 years ago, ice sheets have retreated on a global scale, and Earth has been experiencing a relatively warm interglacial period marked by only high-altitude alpine glaciers at most latitudes with larger ice sheet and sea ice at the poles. However, since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, human activity has contributed to a rapid increase in the speed and scope of deglaciation globally. Greenland Research published in 2014 suggests that below Greenland's Russell Glacier's ice sheet, methanotrophs could serve as a biological methane sink for the subglacial ecosystem, and the region was at least during the sample time, a source of atmospheric methane. Based on dissolved methane in water samples, Greenland may represent a significant global methane source, and may contribute significantly more due to ongoing deglaciation. A study in 2016 concluded based on past evidence, that below Greenland's and Antarctica's ice sheet may exist methane clathrates. Causes and effects At every scale, climate influences the condition of snow and ice on Earth's surface. In colder periods massive ice sheets may extend toward the Equator, while in periods warmer than today, the Earth may be completely free of ice. A significant, empirically demonstrated, positive relationship exists between the surface temperature and concentration of Greenhouse gases such as CO2 in the atmosphere. The higher concentration, in turn, has a drastic negative impact on the global extent and stability of the cryosphere. On the millennial time scales of Pleistocene glacial and interglacial cycles, the pacemaker of glaciation onset and melting are changes in orbital parameters termed the Milankovitch cycles. Specifically, low summer insolation in the northern hemisphere permits growth of ice sheets, while high summer insolation causes more ablation than winter snow accumulation. Human activities promoting climate change, notably the extensive use of fossil fuels over the last 150 years and the resulting increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, are the principal cause of the more rapid retreat of alpine glaciers and continental ice sheets all across the world. For example, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has receded significantly, and is now contributing to a positive feedback loop that threatens further deglaciation or collapse. Newly exposed areas of the Southern Ocean contain long-sequestered stores of CO2 which are now being emitted into the atmosphere and are continuing to impact glacial dynamics. The principle of isostasy applies directly to the process of deglaciation, especially post-glacial rebound, which is one of main mechanisms through which isostasy is observed and studied. Post-glacial rebound refers to the increase in tectonic uplift activity immediately following glacial retreat. Increased rates and abundance of volcanic activity have been found in regions experiencing post-glacial rebound. If on a large enough scale, an increase in volcanic activity provides a positive feedback to the process of deglaciation as a result CO2 and methane released from volcanos. Periods of deglaciation are also caused in part by oceanic processes. For example, interruptions of the usual deep cold water circulation and penetration depths in the North Atlantic have feedbacks that promote further glacial retreat. Deglaciation influences sea level because water previously held on land in solid form turns into liquid water and eventually drains into the ocean. The recent period of intense deglaciation has resulted in an average global sea level rise of 1.7 mm/year for the entire 20th century, and 3.2 mm/year over the past two decades, a very rapid increase. The physical mechanisms by which deglaciation occurs include melting, evaporation, sublimation, calving, and aeolian processes such as wind scouring. Deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet Throughout the Pleistocene Epoch, the Laurentide Ice Sheet spread over large areas of northern North America, with over 5,000,000 square miles of coverage. The Laurentide ice sheet was 10,000 feet deep in some areas, and reached as far south as 37¬∞N. Mapped extent of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during deglaciation has been prepared by Dyke et al. Cycles of deglaciation are driven by various factors, with the main driver being changes in incoming summer solar radiation, or insolation, in the Northern Hemisphere. But, as not all of the rises in insolation throughout time caused deglaciation, to the current ice volumes that we witness today. This leads to a different conclusion, one that suggests that there is a possible climatic threshold, in terms of ice sheets retreating, and eventually disappearing. As Laurentide was the largest mass ice sheet in the Northern Hemisphere, much study has been conducted regarding its disappearance, unloading energy balance models, atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, and surface energy balance models. These studies concluded that the Laurentide ice sheet presented a positive surface mass balance during almost the entirety of its deglaciation, which indicates that the loss of mass throughout its deglaciation was more than likely due to dynamic discharge. It was not until the early Holocene when the surface mass balance switched to become negative. This change to a negative surface mass balance suggested that surface ablation became the driver that resulted in the loss of mass of ice in the Laurentide ice sheet. It is concluded then that the Laurentide ice sheet only began to exhibit behaviours and patterns of deglaciation after radiative forcing and summer temperatures began to rise at the beginning of the Holocene. Result of the deglaciation of the Laurentide ice sheet When the Laurentide ice sheet progressed through the process of deglaciation, it created many new landforms and had various effects of the land. First and foremost, as huge glaciers melt, there is a consequently large volume of meltwater. The volumes of meltwater created many features, including proglacial freshwater lakes, which can be sizable. Not only was there meltwater that formed lakes, there were also storms that blew over the inland freshwater. These storms created waves strong enough to erode the ice shores. Once ice cliffs were exposed, due to rising sea levels and erosion caused by waves, the ice bergs were split and shed (calved) off. Large lakes became prevalent, but so did smaller, shallower, relatively short-lived lakes. This appearance and disappearance of small, shallow lakes influenced much of the plant growth, spread and diversity that we see today. The lakes acted as barriers to plant migration, but when these lakes drained, the plants could migrate and spread very efficiently. The last deglaciation Temperature from 20,000 to 10,000 years ago, derived from EPICA Dome C Ice Core (Antarctica) The Post-Glacial Sea Level The period between the end of the Last Glacial Maximum to the early Holocene (ca. 19k-11k years ago), shows changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), when sea-level rose by 80 meters. Additionally, the last deglaciation is marked by three abrupt CO2 pulses, and records of volcanic eruptions show that subaerial volcanism increased globally by two to six times above background levels between 12 ka and 7 ka. Between roughly 19ka, the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (or LGM) to 11ka, which was the early Holocene, the climate system experienced drastic transformation. Much of this change was occurring at an astonishing rate, as the earth was dealing with the end of the last ice age. Changes in insolation was the principal reason for this drastic global change in climate, as this was linked with several other changes globally, from the alteration of ice sheets, to the concentration of greenhouse gases fluctuating, and many other feedbacks that resulted in distinct responses, both globally and regionally. Not only were ice sheets and greenhouse gases experiencing alteration, but also additionally to this, there was sudden climate change, and many occurrences of fast, and sizeable rising of sea level. The melting of the ice sheets, along with the rising sea levels did not happen until after 11ka. Nonetheless, the globe had arrived at its present interglacial period, where climate is comparatively constant and stable, and greenhouse gas concentrations exhibit near pre-industrial levels. This data is all available due to studies and information gathered from proxy records, both from the terrestrial and ocean, which illustrates overall global patterns of changes in climate whilst in the period of Deglaciation. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), there were apparent low atmospheric concentration of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), which was believed to be as a result of larger containment of carbon in the deep ocean, via the process of stratification within the Southern Ocean. These Southern Ocean deep waters contained the least Œ¥13C, which consequently resulted in them being the location with the greatest density, and most salt content during the LGM. The discharge of such sequestered carbon was perhaps a direct outcome of the deep Southern Ocean overturning, driven by heightened wind-driven upwelling, and sea-ice retreat, which are directly correlated to the warming of the Antarctic, and also coinciding with the cold events, the Oldest and Younger Dryas, in the north. Throughout the LGM in North America, the east was populated by cold-tolerant conifer forests, while the southeast and northwest of the United States sustained open forests in locations that have closed forests today, which suggests that during the LGM temperatures were cooler and overall conditions were much drier than those that we experience today. There is also indication that the southwest of the United States was much wetter during the LGM compared to today, as there was open forest, where today we see desert and steppe. In the United States, the general variation of vegetation implies an overall fall in temperatures of (at minimum 5 ¬∞C), a shift of the westerly storm tracks to the south, and a very steep latitudinal temperature gradient. Landforms Several landforms visible today are distinctive of the powerful erosional forces at play during, or immediately after, deglaciation. The distribution of such landforms helps to inform the understanding of the glacial dynamics and geologic periods of the past. Studying exposed landforms can also inform the understanding of the present and near future as glaciers all over the world retreat in the current period of climate change. In general, recently deglacialized landscapes are inherently unstable and will tend to move towards an equilibrium.

Early life Lupien was born in Cochituate, a neighborhood in Wayland, Massachusetts. His parents were of French descent and were brought to the United States from Canada when they were infants. He was named \\"Ulysses\\" because of his grandfather's admiration for president Ulysses S. Grant. He began working at the age of 14, shoeing mules at the Metropolitan Water Works. After about six months he was given a job swinging a sledgehammer and was later promoted to a pick and shovel crew. He later worked in construction as a concrete mixer and as a shoe packer for a shoe manufacturing company. Lupien also played semipro baseball while working and attending school. After graduating from Wayland High School, Lupien attended Harvard College. He worked as way through school as a tutor. While at Harvard, Lupien was unable to play for the school's varsity athletic teams due to his status as a semipro baseball player. He graduated from Harvard in 1906. After graduating, Lupien worked at the General Electric plant in Lynn, Massachusetts. During World War I he was in charge of construction at the Bethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard in Sparrows Point, Maryland. Lupien later worked as a teacher and athletic coach at the Lowell Textile Institute. Courses taught by Lupien included electrical engineering and physics. While he was at the Institute, Lupien also acted as a contractor on the school's construction projects, which included additions to the school and installing a power plant. Business career Lupien left the Institute to enter the business world. His first job was director of industrial relations at Cheney Brothers in Manchester, Connecticut. In 1933, he returned to Massachusetts as the director of public relations for Pacific Mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts. His duties as public relations director included passing on the qualifications of job applicants, which were then divided into between 200 and 250 types of work. Director of civil service In 1939, Lupien was appointed to a five- year term as the state director of civil service. The position was created by a revision in the state law which replaced the three-person civil service board with a five-person commission consisting of members of both political parties and a civil service director chosen by the board and approved by the Governor. His duties consisted of appointing examiners, setting up classifications, and judging appeals. Lupien's appointment was heralded as an end to favoritism in civil service hiring. Lupien considered himself to be a political independent, as he had never voted a straight party line in his life and his only political experience was on the Chelmsford, Massachusetts school committee more than two decades earlier. He sought to eliminate the practice of job selling in the state civil service and pledged to hire the best person, regardless of race, religion, or political affiliation. He was praised for breathing new life into the civil service system, but was also involved in a number of controversies involving the hiring and firing of employees. One such controversy involved the Lowell School Committee voting to bypass Lupien's recommendation for the position of school attendance officer, a disabled veteran who had scored a 72 on the civil service test, in favor of a woman who had earned a higher score (90), as the committee had asked only for a list of female candidates (the school system already had a male attendance officer and wanted a female officer as there was a majority of female students). He was also criticized by Boston City Councilor Charles I. Taylor for usurping the power of the chief executives of the cities in towns by serving as the final authority on whether or not municipalities needed additional temporary help. After his term ended, Lupien returned to Pacific Mills as the consulting director of public relations. Lowell city manager On November 29, 1952, the Lowell City Council voted five to four to appoint Lupien to the position of city manager. Lupien was elected over City Solicitor P. Harold Ready on the 10th ballot at a special meeting called days before incumbent city manager John J. Flannery was to retire due to ill health. Lupien was sworn in by the city clerk soon after the vote was taken. In September 1953, the Lowell retirement board ruled that Lupien, who would turn 70 in December, must quit by December 31 of that year, citing a provision in the retirement law dealing with employees who began their initial employment with the city after the age of 60. On November 10, 1953, the City Council voted five to three to remove Lupien from office in order to give the next city manager plenty of time to prepare the city's budget for the following year. After his firing, Lupien campaigned to get his job back. Four city councilors strongly supported him and were ready to rehire him if a fifth councilor was willing to join them. He remained involved in Lowell politics by delivering a weekly \\"State of the Nation\\" radio address. On July 24, 1954, Lupien announced his candidacy for the Massachusetts Senate seat in the 1st Middlesex District, which included his hometown of Chelmsford as well as most of Lowell. He faced incumbent Senator Paul A. Achin and former Lowell City Council candidate Joseph N. Herbert. According to Fred A. Simmonds of The Boston Daily Globe, Lupien's candidacy was viewed by some as a test of strength in his effort to return to Lowell politics. Lupien finished second in the primary with 2731 (36%) votes to Achin's 4099 (54%). Personal life and death Lupien lived on a small farm in Chelmsford from 1939 until his death. He had four sons, Ulysses John \\"Tony\\" Lupien Jr., an athletic standout at Harvard who played professional baseball for the Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago White Sox, and in the Pacific Coast League, Albert J. Lupien, captain of the 1932 Harvard Crimson football team, Theodore A. Lupien, also a varsity athlete at Harvard, and Frank U. Lupien. His great-grandson is wrestler John Cena. Lupien died on August 15, 1965 at the Willow Nursing Home in Lowell. He was 81 years old.

It is one of Brazil's richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual revenue of $45.1m (‚Ç¨31.5m), and one of the most valuable clubs, worth over $86.7m (‚Ç¨60.6m) in 2011.Clubes mais ricos do Brasil 2011 The Santista club is the most successful club in Brazilian football in terms of overall trophies, having won nine national, six continental and three international titles. In 1962, Santos became the first club in the world to win the continental treble consisting of the Paulista, Ta√ßa Brasil, and the Copa Libertadores. That same year, it also became the first football club ever to win four out of four competitions in a single year, thus completing the quadruple, comprising the aforementioned treble and the Intercontinental Cup. Santos has employed several famous players, with eleven FIFA World Cup, six Copa Am√©rica and one FIFA Confederations Cup winners among the previous and current Santos players. Arnaldo Patusca was the first Santista player to participate with the national team during the 1916 Copa Am√©rica. Araken Patusca was the first player from the club to participate with Brazil at a World Cup in 1930. The first Peixe to participate with the national team at the Confederations Cup was L√©o at the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup. Pel√© was voted South American footballer of the year in 1973, won the FIFA World Cup Best Young Player award in 1958 and FIFA World Cup Golden Ball in 1970. Pepe is considered the greatest winger of all time and the player who won the most Brasileir√£os with seven titles in total. He has also won the most Campeonato Paulistas with 13 titles in total and the only player to spend his entire player career with Santos. Coutinho, considered one of the greatest forwards in the sport, was the top scorer during Santos' victorious campaign during the 1962 Copa Libertadores and scored Santos' 5000th goal in a 10‚Äì2 rout of Guarani in 1961. Honours Santos' memorial of conquests Santos won their first trophy in 1913, a year after its founding, when they won the Campeonato Santista, a football championship between clubs of the city of Santos. The club won the Campeonato Santista again in 1915 under the name Uni√£o Futebol Clube. Santos participated in the Campeonato Paulista, for the first time, in 1913 and won it for the first time in 1935. Even when the national league was established in 1959, the importance of the state leagues remained high. The Campeonato Santista, however, became an amateur event in 1941. of the Ta√ßa Brasil, Brazil's first truly national league. As of 2010, Santos is one of only five clubs never to have been relegated from the top level of Brazilian football, the others being S√£o Paulo, Flamengo, Internacional and Cruzeiro. The club is also the most scorer team of history, with 11,875 goals (until 1 December 2012), and one of the most recognized football clubs in the world, having won nine international trophies, making them the seventh most successful team in South America for official international competitions won, all recognized by CONMEBOL; it also has the record in Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A titles, alongside Palmeiras (with 8), and Supercopa Sudamericana and Supercopa Sudamericana and Intercontinental Supercup titles. ;International *Intercontinental Cup (2): 1962, 1963 *Intercontinental Supercup (1): 1968 ;Continental *Copa Libertadores da Am√©rica (3): 1962, 1963, 2011 *Copa CONMEBOL (1): 1998 *Recopa Sudamericana (1): 2012 *Supercopa Sudamericana (1): 1968 ;National *Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A (8): 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1968, 2002, 2004 *Copa do Brasil (1): 2010 *Torneio Rio-S√£o Paulo (5): 1959, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1997 ;Regional *Campeonato Paulista (22): 1935, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1960, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1978, 1984, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016 *Copa Paulista de Futebol (1): 2004 Doubles and Trebles * The Double :Domestic Double (5) ::State and Cup: 2010 ::State and League: 1961, 1964, 1965, 1968 :Continental Double (2) ::State and Copa Libertadores: 2011 ::League and Copa Libertadores: 1963 * The Treble :Continental Treble (1) ::State, League and Copa Libertadores: 1962 Especially short competitions such as the Recopa Sudamericana, Intercontinental Cup (now defunct), or FIFA Club World Cup are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.

The Gulf Coast Native is a breed of sheep native to the U.S. states bordering the Gulf Coast. Also occasionally known as the Louisiana Scrub, Pineywoods Native or simply Gulf Coast sheep, the breed is a mix of many of the sheep varieties which populated the Southern United States during the European colonization of the region. It is now an exceedingly rare breed, but one valuable for its ability to adapt to the hot humid climate of the Gulf Coast. History The bloodlines of Gulf Coast Native sheep can be traced back to the original proliferation of Churra sheep in the New World during the 15th century by the Spanish. Later, these Criollo- type sheep mixed intermittently with British and French breeds. Some strains may also show Tunis influence. Thousands of Gulf Coast sheep roamed free range over pastures in the South, except for regular roundups. In an age before modern husbandry methods, these sheep adapted to the climate of the South or perished, breeding in decades of resistance to the conditions of the region. Eventually special strains the breed appeared based on the area, such as for Louisiana, Texas, or Florida. By the mid 20th century, Gulf Coast Native sheep supplied nearly all the raw wool for the Southern United States and hundreds of thousands of them were in existence. However, post-World War II, deworming medications and other advances were widely introduced to the sheep industry in the United States, meaning more modern breeds with greater production capacity could be introduced to the South. This led to a precipitous decline in the numbers of Gulf Coast Native sheep. Since 1994, there has been a breed association for Gulf Coast Native sheep. Gulf Coast Native sheep are listed \\"critical\\" on the conservation priority list of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, and are included in Slow Food USA's Ark of Taste. Research flocks have been kept by the University of Florida, Louisiana State University, and by the USDA Agricultural Research Service in Arkansas. Zoo Atlanta has also acquired a flock. Characteristics A child pets a Gulf Coast Native at Zoo Atlanta Gulf Coast Natives are small fine-boned sheep, with ewes weighing no more than 180 pounds and rams 200. They are often much smaller, especially on poor grazing land. They may be polled or horned in both sexes. Though primarily a meat breed, Gulf Coast Natives carry a light wool that may have some hair in it, with a staple of 2.5-4 inches long. It is usually white, but may be brown, black, or spotted occasionally. All Gulf Coast sheep do not have wool on their faces, bellies or legs, which is an adaptation to the heat of the South. The most notable characteristic of Gulf Coast Native sheep is its resistance to parasites and diseases that flourish among sheep in hot humid climates. Compared to other breeds, they are especially known for their ability to resist foot rot (Fusobacterium) and the dreaded Haemonchus contortus which are both more common in warmer climates.

The advantages of such an OS would be that it would run on a thin client, allowing cheaper, more easily manageable computer systems; it would require all applications to be designed on cross-platform, open standards; and would not tie a user's applications, documents, and preferences to a single computer, but rather place them in the Internet cloud. The Internet OS has also been promoted as the perfect type of platform for software as a service. History Talk of an Internet OS began to surface in 1995 as the browser war started heating up between Microsoft and Netscape. In response to the limited capabilities of HTML at the time, Microsoft began developing an online content authoring platform that would be based on distributed OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) which it codenamed Blackbird. Using OLE, applications put on the web would contain their own processing logic, so would act similar to applications in a typical desktop environment. Immediately, there were concerns that this would tie the web to proprietary Microsoft technology that wouldn't be guaranteed to run across different systems. As a challenge, Marc Andreessen of Netscape announced a set of new products that would help transform their browser into what he called an \\"Internet OS\\" that would provide the tools and programming interfaces for a new generation of Internet-based applications. The so-called \\"Internet OS\\" would still run on top of a regular OS - being based around Netscape Navigator - but he dismissed desktop operating systems like Windows as simply \\"bag[s] of drivers\\", reiterating that the goal would be to \\"turn Windows into a mundane collection of not entirely debugged device drivers\\". Andreessen explained that the newest versions of Navigator were not just web browsers, but suites of Internet applications, including programs for mail, FTP, news, and more, and would come with viewers for a variety of document types, like Adobe Acrobat, Apple QuickTime, and Sun Java applets, which would give it programming interfaces and publishing tools for developers. Netscape also would continue to sell its server software, and Java applets would run cross-platform on both its clients and its servers, and as a scripting language in the form of JavaScript. They would also provide facilities for backend transaction processing, elaborating the client/server model with navigating clients and application servers and database servers. He pointed out - because of the broad capabilities that all of this gave their browser - the only difference technically between Netscape Navigator and a traditional operating system is that Navigator didn't include device drivers. Technical problems with Blackbird, the growth of the web, and what they saw as competitive statements from Netscape, soon led Microsoft to rethink their strategy and they began to position OLE as a primary tool within Netscape's proposed ecosystem. OLE would now be embeddable in web pages using an ActiveX plug-in, and would be easily integrated on the server side using ASP (Active Server Pages) development. The \\"Gang of Five\\" and the NC Opposition in the industry to Microsoft began to grow, as did the concept of an \\"Internet OS\\", and this led to the formation of an alliance around developing Java as an alternative to Windows - the chief partners being Netscape, Sun, Oracle, and IBM. These companies were informally referred to in the industry press as the \\"Gang of Four\\". Novell later joined the alliance, leading it to be called the \\"Gang of Five\\". In May 1997, the group published a position paper which discussed integration of software component models within CORBA - a commonly used architecture allowing computer applications from different vendors running on different systems to work together over networks. From this, they then issued several RFPs (Request for Proposals) to the Object Management Group (OMG), the standards body responsible for managing CORBA, meant to help integrate different aspects of Java. The proposals included support for JavaBeans - the serialized, component architecture of Java - and for JavaScript. In what was called the \\"Java- tization of CORBA\\", the group was positioning Java to be a distributed object architecture, similar to what Microsoft had intended with OLE in Blackbird. OLE would only exist as a second-class technology that would interface through CORBA using JavaBeans. The group also promoted the idea of a JavaOS - a minimal, Java-based operating system - which would in turn run Netscape's web browser, and through the browser run JavaBeans components. This would be the front for a new ecosystem based on open standards; first, HTML in the web browser; and second, Java, which they hoped would become widely adopted through CORBA. JavaOS would be hosted on a Network Computer (or NC), a concept long advocated by Oracle. The NC would be a thin client designed only for Internet use, leaving it to access applications and documents stored entirely online. Oracle saw its role as providing tools for the server layer, where network-hosted applications would be provided through the Network Application Server, which in turn would make use of both Oracle7 relationship database management system and the Oracle Web Server. Oracle also outlined what was referred to as the Network Computing Architecture (NCA), which would separate presentation, application and data access logic into Java applets or NCA cartridges. Microsoft and Intel in response to this challenge put forward a standard for a competing model called the NetPC, a diskless PC that would be primarily adapted to web browser use and would run a simplified version of Windows 95, codenamed Pegasus. Later down the road, this idea evolved into the Netbook. Microsoft publicly criticized the idea of an Internet OS, and instead argued that the traditional desktop OS should be Internet-enabled, the beginning of the idea for Active Platform, an Internet strategy that culminated later in the release of Windows 98. This strategy, which involved tightly bundling Internet Explorer in Windows, became the center of a United States anti-trust suit against Microsoft. All of the Gang of Five - Netscape, Sun, IBM, Oracle, and Novell - were involved in lobbying for anti-trust action against Microsoft. By 1998, the Java alliance started to fall apart. Oracle continued developing server-side Java databases but had given up the idea of the network computer and Netscape had given up on their Java browser efforts, instead aiming to position themselves as an Internet portal. Pressure from investors was given the blame. Google and Chrome OS Google revived the idea of the Internet OS in 2009 with the development of Chrome OS, a Linux- based operating system designed to work exclusively with AJAX-based web applications. The operating system was designed to look and operate like the Chrome web browser and be sold on laptops developed with partners, called Chromebooks. They also promoted G Suite, their suite of web applications, as an alternative to traditional desktop software such as Microsoft Office. Google has tried to address standard criticisms of the Internet OS concept with its development projects. Google Native Client allows a browser to run Intel x86 native code in a sandbox, so that more complex programs could run that more fully take advantage of a system's hardware. Google Gears was also created to allow offline access of online applications, although this is being deprecated in favor of web storage, a model in the process of standardization by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

It is the 5th handheld game in the Ridge Racer series. The game was developed by Cellius and published by Namco Bandai Games. The game continues the Ridge Racer tradition of illegal street racing and supports single-player as well as local and Wi-Fi multiplayer games. The game was panned by most video game critics, some of whom have listed it as one of the worst video games ever made. Downloadable content The Hornet from Sega's Daytona USA makes a cameo appearance as available DLC, as well as an exclusive song inspired by both franchises. Other cameos include cars with paint schemes derived from The Idolmaster, as well as DoCoMO and Pac-Man-themed versions of the Kamata SYNCi, the game's cover car. The DoCoMo and Idolmaster cars are not available outside Japan. Reception Ridge Racer received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight and three sevens for a total of 29 out of 40. Elsewhere, it was critically panned by various publications for its bare-bones nature and a lack of proper progression, unlike other installments in the series. GameSpot criticized the game's lack of initial content (which consisted only of a limited number of cars and tracks ported from Ridge Racer 7) as a ploy to force users to buy its downloadable content (while its first DLC pack, despite being available for free as a limited time offer, only consisted of more content originating from Ridge Racer 7), resulting in a poor experience that lacked any of the variety of past installments. In conclusion, the game was considered \\"a complete and utter ripoff\\" that \\"feels more like a cheap cash-in than a fully thought-out product.\\" IGN similarly criticized the game's absolute lack of storyline or progression-based modes or leagues, and unbalanced online races that use a leveling system to determine a player's top speed (giving an unfair disadvantage to newer players). Ridge Racer was described as \\"racing in a vacuum, barely more than a tech demo, wrapped up in an online-reliant social framework that's fundamentally flawed on several levels.\\" In June 2012, IGN also named Ridge Racer one of its ten \\"Worst Video Games of 2012 So Far\\".

From 1869 to 1879 this ship was named Olympia. In 1879 the name was changed to Princess Louise, after Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, a daughter of Queen Victoria who was married to Marquess of Lorne (1845-1914), Governor General of Canada from 1878 to 1883. Princess Louise was the last sidewheeler to be operated commercially on the coast of British Columbia. Design and construction Olympia was built in 1869 in New York City by John English and Sons to the order of George S. Wright, a pioneer steamboat man on Puget Sound. The ship was long, with a beam of and depth of hold of . The hull was built of seasoned white oak. Wright, E.W., ed. Lewis and Dryden Marine History, at page 171.Hacking and Lamb, The Princess Story, at pages 337 and 338. Power was supplied by single-cylinder walking beam type steam engine, manufactured by John Roach & Sons. The cylinder was in diameter and had a stroke of 11 feet (132 inches). The engine generated 350 horsepower.Another source gives 200 horsepower as of 1874. See U.S. Dept. of the Treasury, Bureau of Statistics, Annual List of Merchant Vessels of the United States (for year ending June 30, 1874). (accessed 07-16-11), at page 255. Overall size of the vessel was 971 gross tons, and, as of 1874, 493 registered tons. The ship had an auxiliary sailing rig as a brig.Newell, Ships of the Inland Sea, at pages 53-54. The official United States steamboat registry number was 19297.U.S. Dept. of the Treasury, Bureau of Statistics, Annual List of Merchant Vessels of the United States (for year ending June 30, 1874). (accessed 7-16-11), at page 255. Construction of Olympia was supervised by Capt. James Bolger, who commanded the vessel in the 75-day delivery voyage around Cape Horn. Olympia arrived in San Francisco on November 19, 1869. Continuing north, Olympia arrived at the city of Olympia on December 3, 1869. Operations On December 7, 1869, Olympia was employed on the Olympia-Victoria route for the first time, running under the ownership of the Finch and Wright partnership. Olympia was a replacement for the older and slower Eliza Anderson, a vessel once so profitable that it became known as the \\"floating gold mine\\", which the partnership then used as a reserve boat. In April 1870, the partnership suffered a business reverse when the mail contract was lost to Capt. J.T. Nash, who had submitted an annual bid of $12,000 to carry mail on weekly runs to Victoria, British Columbia and on a semi-weekly route between Olympia and Port Townsend, Washington Territory. Nash, who was to take over the mail contract on July 1, 1870, prepared by purchasing and reconstructing the half- completed sidewheeler Tacoma. To do this, Nash secured the financial backing of two successful businessmen from Portland, Oregon, Edwin A. and Louis A. Starr. When the rebuilding of Tacoma was complete, the vessel was renamed Alida, and the Starrs were in full ownership of the vessel. They also assumed Nash's interest in the mail contract. Nash took over running a smaller vessel, Varuna, in alliance the Starrs. Once Edwin Starr acquired his master's license, the Starr brothers bought another steamer, Isabel, which was somewhat larger than Alida, and was considered one of the most seaworthy vessels on the coast.Carey, The Steamboat Landing on Elliott Bay, at pages 28 to 32. 1871 steamboat race North Pacific circa 1871, Olympia's rival in the 1871 steamboat race. To meet the challenge of the Starrs, the Wright and Finch partnership brought out Eliza Anderson as their primary vessel and undercut the Starrs on passenger fares and freight rates. Isabel proved to be a speedier vessel than Anderson and so Wright and Finch substituted Olympia in the competition against the Starrs. The Starrs however responded by commissioning Joseph Gates, a well-regarded engineer on Columbia river steamboats, to design and build a steamer which would run faster and cheaper than Olympia. This vessel, which was named the North Pacific, was constructed at the Gates and Colyer shipyard in San Francisco, and launched on May 18, 1871. Capt. Dan Morrison brought North Pacific into the Strait of Juan de Fuca on June 23, 1871. For a few days after that, North Pacific was engage in trial trips. Meanwhile, Finch, in command of Olympia was preparing for a race to show the public which steamboat was superior. Finch went so far as to have the coal lumps on Olympia sorted into uniform sizes. On June 27, 1871, Olympia and North Pacific were both at Victoria, with Olympia scheduled to depart for Port Townsend in the morning, with North Pacific making the same run in the afternoon. Intending to challenge North Pacific that day, Finch delayed departure of Olympia but kept steam up in the boiler. Word spread around Victoria, which tended to favor Olympia, that a race was impending, and bets were made favoring Olympia at 10 to 1 over North Pacific. The Starrs meanwhile tried to lower expectations by telling people that their ship was not yet ready for racing. When North Pacific cast off lines, Olympia did likewise, and followed North Pacific out of Victoria harbor. As North Pacific made a south- easterly course for Point Wilson, of open water away from Victoria, Olympia's firemen poured on the coals, causing clouds of black smoke to spew out of the ship's smokestack. Olympia, the heavier, oak-built vessel, was favored over the long open stretch, whereas North Pacific was thought to be able to better in the narrower waters near Point Wilson. The resulting race between the two vessels, each of which was almost new, and represented the highest point of technical achievement for the time, was long remembered by the people on board the ships and alongside the wharves of Victoria and Port Townsend. Over most of the run, the two steamers ran almost side by side at maximum speed. But as the neared Point Wilson, North Pacific drew ahead, reaching Port Townsend in 2 hours and 41 minutes, 13 minutes and four miles (6 km) ahead of Olympia. Finch and Wright soon composed their differences with the Starrs, who bought the Finch and Wright dock and warehouse in Olympia. In addition, in a typical anti-competitive agreement of the time, paid Finch and Wright a subsidy to keep Olympia off the Victoria route. Finch and Wright then withdrew Olympia to California.Newell, ed., McCurdy Marine History, at page 94. Olympia was based in California for the next seven years and managed to collect another subsidy from a California rival in return for staying out of competition. During this time Olympia made a voyage to Hawaii. Canadian service Princess Louise at Comox, British Columbia circa 1880. By 1878, the Starrs had paid $50,000 to Olympia's owners, and they decided to terminate the subsidy. Olympia was then returned to Puget Sound, and was then under the ownership of George S. Wright. At that time, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) was engaged in a competitive struggle with John Irving, who had recently purchased the former Gold Rush steamer Wilson G. Hunt. To beat the Hunt, the Hudson's Bay Company HBC bought Olympia from Wright for $75,000.Turner, Pacific Princess, at pages 4 through 7. The ship was reregistered in Canada and assigned Canadian registry #72682.The New Mills' List, \\"Registered Canadian Steamships 1817‚Äì1930 over 75 feet\\" (accessed 06-17-11) HBC operated Olympia under the ship's original name until May 1879, when it changed the name to Princess Louise, after Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll (1848-1939), a daughter of Queen Victoria, who was married to Marquess of Lorne (1845-1914), Governor General of Canada from 1878 to 1883.Hacking and Lamb, The Princess Story, at page 77. In the summer of 1879, competition between Princess Louise and the Hunt drove rates down on the routes between Vancouver Island and the mainland. In August 1879 Princess Louise ran an excursion around Vancouver Island, which was possibly the first such cruise to take place. In 1880, HBC and Irving settled the rate war. In a monopolistic arrangement which became known as the \\"'arf and 'arf agreement\\", HBC ships would carry passengers to and from New Westminster, where they would transfer to an Irving-owned stternwheeler for the trip up river to the head of navigation at Yale. This was a suitable arrangement for the Princess Louise because as a sidewheeler the ship required improved docking facilities that were not available upriver from New Westminster. In the late summer of 1880, when word reached Victoria that the steamship Otter had wrecked five miles (8 km) out of Bella Bella on August 19, 1880, Princess Louise was sent to the scene with the Lloyd's agent and HBC officials on board in an attempt to salvage Otter. This proved to be not possible, and Princess Louise was forced to return to Victoria with as much cargo as could be salvaged from the Otter.Hacking and Lamb, The Princess Story, at pages 70-71. In May 1881, the Canadian Pacific was anxiously recruiting as many laborers as it could for the difficult work of completing the transcontinental rail line down the valley of the Fraser River. Princess Louise transported the first group of laborers, who had been recruited from San Francisco and from China to New Westminster on March 25, 1881.Hacking and Lamb, The Princess Story, at page 87. Transfer of ownership Princess Louise in the 1880s, at a small dock somewhere in British Columbia. In 1883, the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company was incorporated. Although the stated capital was $500,000, divided into 5,000 shares valued at $100 each, the actual paid-up capital was only $336,000, divided in 3,360 shares at $100 per share. Most of the shares were controlled indirectly by John Irving, but the Hudson's Bay Company was also allocated a total 1,150 shares. This was in return for transferring ownership of three HBC steamships, including the Princess Louise to the new company, with 750 shares specifically allocated to the Princess Louise.Hacking and Lamb, The Princess Story, at pages 94 to 96. Princess Louise began its first trip for the new company on March 13, 1883, steaming under Capt. William McCulloch, from Victoria, to Alert Bay, Prince Rupert, Metlakatla, Port Simpson, the Skeena River, Wrangell, Alaska and way ports along the route. On May 4, 1883, the new company announced that Princess Louise would be put on a regular route from Victoria to Burrard Inlet and Port Moody, British Columbia.Hacking and Lamb, The Princess Story, at page 99. Also in 1883, Princess Louise was refitted with new boilers, manufactured by Albion Iron Works of Victoria. Other overhaul work was completed and the ship was returned to service before the beginning of 1884.Turner, Pacific Princesses, at page 11 and 12. In October 1887, the mayor of Vancouver, which then was the second largest city in British Columbia next to Victoria, tried to discourage visitors to Vancouver Island by denouncing Princess Louise as unseaworth. John Irving felt this went too far, and he threatened to sue the mayor for libel. He also banned the mayor from travel on any of the company's ships.Turner, Pacific Princesses, at pages 16 and 18. From 1886 to 1890, Princess Louise was operated on northern routes, serving among other communities the many cannery ports in coastal British Columbia. In 1898, Princess Louise was used like many other ships on the west coast to carry gold seekers to the Klondike goldfields.Turner, Pacific Princesses, at pages 30 and 32. On August 16, 1890, Princess Louise developed a serious leak which forced the ship to return to Victoria. Princess Louise was replaced on the route by Islander.Hacking and Lamb, The Princess Story, at pages 111, 114, and 133. In 1895 Princess Louise was estimated to be worth $35,000.Hacking and Lamb, The Princess Story, at page 333. In September 1898, Princess Louise returned to Victoria carrying 8,100 cases of canned salmon from Alert Bay, but on this trip there had been a fatal accident. Three of the crew had fallen overboard when they were leaning on a railing posing for a photograph. They were washed beneath the sidewheel and never seen again.Turner, Pacific Princesses, at page 35./ Canadian Pacific Railway In 1901, the Canadian Pacific Railway purchased the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company and all its ships, including Princess Louise.Hacking and Lamb, The Princess Story, at pages 189, 192, and 203-204. The name of Princess Louise inspired the Canadian Pacific to name a new series of coastal liners as \\"Princesses\\". In 1901, Capt. James W. Troup reported that Princess Louise was in poor mechanical condition, with worn out boilers and engines badly in need of repair. Because the hull was still in good condition, and capable of being operated in the often-dangerous waters of the Strait of Georgia, Troup recommended that the engines be replaced. This however was not done. Even so, the CPR did use Princess Louise in the winter to replace the sternwheeler R.P. Rithet on the route from Victoria to New Westminster and points on the lower Fraser River. In the summers, the Princess Louise was a secondary vessel on northern routes to Rivers Inlet, Port Simpson, British Columbia, and the Queen Charlotte Islands. Ships on this route departed Victoria twice a month, on the 1st and the 15th at 11:00 p.m., and stopped in Vancouver the next day on the way north.Turner, Pacific Princesses, at pages 39-40. Disposition In November 1906 Princess Louise was sold to Marpole McDonald of Victoria, who removed the machinery and converted the vessel to a barge.Turner, Pacific Princesses, at page 92. In 1908 McDonald sold the barge to Vancouver Dredging and Salvage Company. In 1916, the barge was sold again to Britannia Mining and Smelting Company, which in turn, in 1917, sold the barge to Whalen Pulp and Paper Co., which in the same year beached the hull on Howe Sound at Woodfibre, British Columbia. The unpowered vessel is also reported to have sunk a considerable distance away from Woodfibre, at Port Alice, British Columbia in 1919 on northern Vancouver Island.

She is known for her work in chemical neurobiology and is currently a professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology. She is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and an adjunct professor at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at the University of California, Los Angeles.  Biography  Hsieh-Wilson was born in New York City, NY and received her bachelor's degree in chemistry at Yale University, where she graduated magna cum laude. She then completed her Ph.D. in 1996 at the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a National Science Foundation Fellow in the laboratory of Peter G. Schultz and studied antibody-based catalysis. She then joined the lab of Professor and Nobel Prize Laureate Paul Greengard at Rockefeller University until 2000. There she characterized the protein phosphatase and actin-binding protein spinophilin and investigated its role in dendritic spines. Hsieh-Wilson then obtained an appointment at the Department of Chemistry at the California Institute of Technology in 2000 as an assistant professor and became an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2005. She then became an associate professor of chemistry in 2006 and was appointed a full professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology in 2010.  Research interests  Overview Hsieh-Wilson's research is at the interface between organic chemistry and neuroscience. She investigates how the post-translational addition of glycans affect the structure and function of proteins in the nervous system. Her laboratory has developed a chemoenzymatic method to tag proteins that have been appended with a dynamic form of glycosylation called O-GlcNAc. Her work with glycosaminoglycan microarrays has significantly advanced an understanding of specific sulfated glycosaminoglycans in neuronal communication, learning, and memory as well as advanced the field of chemical biology. She has demonstrated how fucosylation can modulate neurite growth and neuronal morphology. O-GlcNAc Glycosylation Hsieh-Wilson and her colleagues have found that the covalent-modifications of intercellular proteins by O-linked-N- acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) within the mammalian nervous system have a large role in the regulation of gene expression, neuronal signaling, and synaptic plasticity.http://www.pnas.org/content/101/36/13132.full.pdf This post- translational modification, has been analysed in the rat brain using a novel chemoenzymatic strategy wherein O-GlcNAc modified proteins are selectively labeled with fluorescent or biotin tags. This technique developed by Hsieh- Wilson and her lab has revealed over 200 O-GlcNAc modified proteins within the mammalian brain and such modifications have been shown to activate transcriptional function of proteins,http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=WOS&search;_mode=DaisyOneClickSearch&qid;=11&SID;=1AMO2etzAYAIFJZoUSG&page;=1&doc;=6&cacheurlFromRightClick;=no regulate cancer metabolism, regulate gene expression and memory formation,http://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=WOS&search;_mode=DaisyOneClickSearch&qid;=11&SID;=1AMO2etzAYAIFJZoUSG&page;=1&doc;=21 and carry out many other tasks in the brain and beyond. Glycosaminoglycans Glycosaminoglycans are heterogeneously sulfated oligosaccharides that are very important in nervous system development, spinal cord injury, inflammation and cancer metastasis. Hsieh-Wilson's research on this subject implicates the specific sulfation sequence of glycosaminoglycans as a way to modulate biological function. Specifically, her work with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS), the two most common glycosaminoglycans in the nervous system, has shown that this \\"sulfation code\\" functions as a molecular recognition element for growth factors and modulates neuronal growth,https://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v2/n9/full/nchembio810.html indicating that these specific sulfated glycosaminoglycans play a major role in neuronal communication, learning, and memory. Additionally, Hsieh-Wilson has elucidated the role of this sulfation in glycosaminoglycan-protein interaction using a carbohydrate microarray-based approach developed in her lab.

Only 10 years old at the time of her death, her dismembered remains were found in November 2010. Because of the crime's gruesome nature and the series of events leading up to her death, Zahra's murder received worldwide media coverage. In September 2011, the victim's stepmother, Elisa Baker, pleaded guilty to murdering Zahra, and was sentenced to eighteen years in prison. In 2013, she was given an additional 10 years for drug related charges. Australia Zahra Baker was born to Emily Dietrich and Adam Baker who both lived in Wagga Wagga, Australia. Emily Dietrich, who had postpartum depression after Zahra's birth, gave up custody to Adam. Adam took Zahra and moved with his parents to Giru, Queensland, in 2004 to work for a sugar mill. Zahra, who was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2005, later suffered a bout of lung cancer as well. As a result, she had the lower part of one leg amputated and had to wear hearing aids. Adam Baker reportedly met Elisa Fairchild (originally from western North Carolina) online on an IMVU website. Elisa Fairchild visited Adam Baker in Queensland and they were soon married. Elisa had been previously married six times and was still married at the time she married Adam Baker. Zahra's cancer went into remission in 2008, shortly before she moved to the United States from Australia with her father and new stepmother. North Carolina, U.S.A. After moving to North Carolina, the Bakers settled in Hickory where Zahra attended public school until she started being home schooled. It is not known, though, if she was ever actually home schooled. It is suspected Zahra was taken out of public school because reports of child abuse were made to the school, implicating Elisa. Many neighbors of Zahra's claimed that Elisa was physically and mentally abusive, and neglected the child. Two teachers visited Zahra's home, after Zahra went to school with a black eye in a public school in Hudson while she was in the fourth grade. Child Protective Services from both Caldwell County and Catawba County visited the various residences of Zahra multiple times before Zahra died. The Bakers had moved a few times in both those counties before settling in Hickory. Reports of Elisa's abusive behavior have been investigated by the Department of Social Services in regards to Elisa's own biological children dating as far back from 1999. Elisa has 3 children from 2 different relationships: a daughter born out of wedlock and a son and a daughter from a previous marriage. 911 call A 911 call was made by Elisa on October 9, 2010 at 5:30 am, reporting a fire in the back of the family residence in Hickory. When the police came for the reported fire, there was a ransom note and the smell of gasoline coming from Adam's company truck, a Chevrolet Tahoe. In a second 911 phone call made when Zahra was reported missing at 2 pm on the same day, Adam Baker explained that during a fire in their backyard a $1 million ransom note was found on his company truck the night before, addressed to Adam's boss and landlord, Mark Coffey. Adam explained that they called 911 earlier that day about the fire and implied that whoever started the fire, may have done so in order to distract the family, in order to take Zahra. Adam explained the purported kidnapper mistakenly confused Zahra for Mr. Coffey's daughter. Mark Coffey's daughter was unharmed and with her family, Adam stated. Adam said the last time he saw his daughter was at 2:30 am. Apparently, Adam Baker left for work early in the morning and did not return until after Zahra went to sleep. Investigation Arrests and charges Reportedly, Elisa failed a polygraph test she had taken early in the investigation. She was asked: if she had hurt Zahra, if she knew of anyone who had harmed Zahra and if she knew who wrote the ransom note. On October 10, 2010 search and rescue dogs were sent to search the Bakers' house and cars. The dogs gave positive alerts to the scent of human remains on both of the Bakers' cars, the Chevrolet Tahoe and a sedan. The police took swabs of what they thought may be blood from the car. On October 10, 2010, Elisa Baker was also arrested for various crimes which included communicating threats, writing bad checks, larceny and driving with a revoked license, crimes unrelated to the death of Zahra. Baker, who was jailed, was next charged with obstruction of justice after admitting that she wrote the ransom note, which led the police astray. Bond hearing In late October 2010, a Catawba County judge raised Elisa's bond from $40,000 to $65,000 at a bond hearing, believing that Elisa was a flight risk. Amber Fairchild, Elisa's daughter testified at the hearing and said her mother told her she was thinking of leaving North Carolina the day before she was arrested. Amber Fairchild also said her mother was involved in an online relationship with a man from England who had sent her thousands of dollars. The prosecutor said that Elisa failed to show up at other court dates for other charges which included traffic violations and communicating threats, thus thwarting Elisa's attorney's attempt to lower her bond. Discoveries Elisa Baker's aunt Buzzie Winkler told reporters that Elisa told her Zahra died after being sick for 2 weeks, and both parents dismembered her and hid the remains. Elisa's aunt said: \\"She'd been sick two weeks before she died, when they found her, I guess they didn't know what to do. They just went wild.\\" However, Elisa reportedly said Adam dismembered Zahra Baker alone, after she died, and they both hid her remains. Elisa also told police that Zahra died on September 24, yet she was not reported missing until October 9. Allegedly Eric Gein, crime memorabilia dealer and owner of Serial Killers Ink, used an assumed name to write to Elisa in jail. She twice wrote back to him, sharing some information. According to a letter written to Eric Gein, Elisa admitted: \\"We really didn't kill her, but what he did after the fact is kinda horrifying.\\" \\"(It) makes me scared of him.\\" Reportedly, Elisa's attorney Lisa Dubs told police where they could find possible evidence relating to Zahra's death. Apparently, Elisa told her attorney that Zahra's prosthetic leg was left in a dumpster that she and Adam had disposed of at Fox Ridge Apartments in Hickory. A prosthetic leg was found in late October off a road in Caldwell County a few miles from a former residence of Elisa's. The Hickory police department were able to match the serial number of the prosthetic leg from Zahra's medical records they obtained from Australia, in order to confirm that it was definitely Zahra's leg. In November 2010, Elisa Baker started leading police to different areas in Catawba County and Caldwell County to find Zahra's scattered remains. Numerous bones of Zahra were found but Zahra's head was not found until some years later. Allegedly, Elisa had told police she threw Zahra's mattress in a dumpster, and police confirmed the mattress fitting the description was found in a landfill. Elisa Baker also led the police to another dumpster, behind a grocery store in Hudson, where she and Adam dumped a car cover and bed cover, which was used to hide and transport Zahra. Elisa also told police they would find Zahra's body parts in the drain trap of the bathtub and that plastic gloves that she used would be found in her bathroom. Elisa's MySpace page A review of Elisa Baker's now defunct MySpace page revealed she called herself \\"GothicFairy6668\\". Her page portrayed skulls and bones as Living Dead Girl by Rob Zombie was played. She listed \\"Never, neverland\\" as her hometown, Queensland, Australia, as her state and country and wrote that she was a college graduate and a proud parent. The page had photos of Zahra on it and in one photo, Zahra was wearing all black and the title read \\"The Dark Child!!!lol\\". Her \\"mood\\" on the page was listed as \\"crazy\\" on the last day she signed in, October 8, 2010, one day before Zahra was reported missing. Elisa's past marriages Reportedly, Elisa Baker was married seven times. At times she was married to two or three men concurrently, having failed to divorce before remarrying. Prior to marrying Adam Baker, Elisa had married three men within three years. In January 2011 it was reported that Elisa Baker was charged with bigamy after it was confirmed that she was still married to Aaron Young when she wed Adam Baker. Elisa had introduced Aaron Young to Adam, claiming he was her brother, not an ex-husband. Elisa kept in frequent contact with her previous husband, Aaron Young, and they both visited an IMVU.com website on September 22, two days before the day on which Elisa claimed Zahra died. The IMVU website featured \\"chainsaw massacre role-playing\\". Police investigated the claim of a woman who used the same social networking site as the Bakers that she had had a conversation with one or both of the Bakers about \\"doing a murder with chainsaws. Accusations against two men related to Elisa Baker's previous husband, Aaron Young, alleged that Zahra was raped and may have been hit on the head, causing her death. The two cousins, James Young and Timothy \\"Sammy\\" Young were both investigated by the police for the allegations. Both men passed polygraph tests and were not charged. Sammy Young was alleged to have had a sexual relationship with Elisa and the two had taken illicit drugs together. Murder charge Since no cause of death could be determined, Zahra's death was ruled an \\"undetermined violent homicide\\". Allegedly, Elisa told the police that both she and Adam Baker disposed of Zahra's remains, but according to cell phone towers, Elisa was in the area where Zahra's remains were found but Adam was not. Investigators believe that Elisa Baker killed and dismembered Zahra on September 24, 2010 and disposed of her remains the following day. Elisa Baker was indicted by a grand jury, for second degree murder with aggravating circumstances, on February 22, 2011 in Catawba County. The five aggravating circumstances were cited as: *Elisa Baker had a history of physical, verbal and psychological abuse of the child. *She secreted the child from her family, before and after the crime. *She desecrated Zahra‚Äôs body to hinder the murder investigation and prosecution. *Zahra was young and physically infirm/handicapped. *Elisa Baker took advantage of a position of trust. Elisa would have a first degree murder charge if she had not led law enforcement to Zahra's remains. Adam has denied any involvement in Zahra's death and the police have not found any credible evidence to suggest that he had any involvement in her death or to charge him with murder. Elisa's bond was increased by $200,000 because of the murder charge, making the total bond $307,700. Identity theft charges In April 2011 Adam Baker was charged with identity theft and obtaining property under false pretenses. It was claimed that Adam Baker used the identity of a man by the name of James Starbuck and his social security number to get power connected to his apartment. James Starbuck is the husband of Elisa's daughter, Brittany Starbuck. Adam was previously charged with passing worthless checks, communicating threats, assault with a deadly weapon and failure to return property. With these new charges, Adam was ordered not to leave North Carolina without notifying the district attorney's office. He also was ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device on his ankle and was ordered to meet with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement once a week. Adam was hoping to return to Australia shortly. Elisa Baker was also charged with identity theft and obtaining property under false pretenses in February 2011. It was reported that Elisa had used her daughter, Brittany Starbuck's personal information to obtain telephone and utility service at one of the family residences in Caldwell County in March 2010. She pleaded not guilty to the four counts of identity theft in May 2011.  Drug charges In May, 2011 Elisa Baker was indicted with seven drug counts for the time period of May 2006 through October 2010. Elisa, who had used different addresses in both Catawba and Caldwell County of North Carolina, had distributed Oxycodone, Hydrocodone and Alprazolam, all prescription drugs for pain and anxiety. Elisa was charged with possessing, distributing and conspiring to distribute prescription drugs. These new federal drug charges combined with the previous unrelated charges brings the total to over twenty. On June 2, 2011, Elisa pleaded not guilty to all seven federal drug charges. She is facing up to 20 years in prison for each drug charge.  Change of venue  Because of all the publicity surrounding this case, Elisa Baker's attorney, Scott Reilly requested a change of venue for the trial, which was supposed to occur in Catawba County.

As a royalty it refers to the fraction of net smelter return that a mine operator is obligated to pay the owner of the royalty agreement. The royalty is paid in variable or fixed payments based on sales revenue received by a mining operator in return for mining output. It is contingent only on the sales price and quantity of product sold. The term is named so due to the fact most of the time, mining output sold requires further processing by smelters; the mining products purchased directly by smelters are sold to them for a discounted (net) price based on how much further processing is needed. The mining lease specifies the selling price (prices are different in spot and forward markets) and is used to verify the exact amount of product that's produced and sold between royalty payments. One advantage NSR royalties have over other royalties is that usually, payments are higher in the short term because capital costs and exploration costs cannot be used as deductions (some royalties don't have to be paid until after other costs such as loans/amortization are taken care of). Also, mine life and royalty expiration dates need to be taken into consideration. The royalty can be called a Net Value Royalty when deductions are based solely on the contract. Alternatively the Gross Smelter Return is a percentage of gross revenue paid by mine owner that isn't subject to any deductions. Examples of transactions involving net smelter return royalties *Franco-Nevada's 7.29% NSR royalty on Newmont Mining's Gold Quarry open pit mine in Nevada, which cost the company US$103.5 million, realized $250 million in royalty payments before being acquired. The NSM royalty in this case gave Franco Nevada the option of collecting in cash or in-kind (metal product output).

He was City Manager of Medford, Massachusetts and Town Manager of Norwood, Massachusetts and Saugus, Massachusetts. He was a candidate for Treasurer and Receiver-General of Massachusetts in 1960. Early life and career Kennedy graduated from Winthrop High School in 1918 and went on to earn degrees from Wentworth Institute and Franklin Union Technical Institute. He also completed course in municipal government at Boston University. Kennedy's career in municipal management began in Winthrop, Massachusetts, where he served as water commissioner and business manager. In 1949, he and seven other water superintendents agreed to form the Massachusetts Water Works Association, a corporation that would gather and disseminate information to insure an adequate supply of drinking water. Kennedy served as the corporation's first Secretary. Norwood Town Manager After ten years as water commissioner, Kennedy left Winthrop to become Town Manager of Norwood, Massachusetts. In 1954, after a series of assaults on women in town, which included the murder of 15-year-old Geraldine Annese, Kennedy declared a state of emergency. Medford City Manager From 1957 to 1958, Kennedy served as City Manager of Medford, Massachusetts. In January 1958, two members of the Medford City Council requested that Kennedy resign. City Councilor and Kennedy's predecessor as City Manager James Shurtleff told Kennedy that six of the seven members of the City Council would vote in favor of removing him if he chose not to resign. On January 29, he announced that he would not resign. On March 30, 1958 the City Council voted to suspend Kennedy, despite the fact that the crowd of over 400 was mostly pro-Kennedy. On April 8, the city council voted for to 4 to 3 to fire Kennedy, who the council accused of 19 charges, including being appointed unethically by the previous council, failing to \\"provide executive leadership\\", failing to \\"show reasonable understanding of municipal finance\\", and establishing an \\"unsound\\" tax rate. Saugus Town Manager In May 1958, Kennedy was named Town Manager of Saugus, Massachusetts. He succeeded Daniel E. McLean, who resigned to become Chairman of the Massachusetts Republican State Committee. In 1960, Kennedy ran for Treasurer and Receiver-General of Massachusetts. He finished third in the Democratic primary behind John T. Driscoll and Patrick F. McDonough. On September 11, 1960, the Saugus Board of Selectmen requested Kennedy's resignation. Kennedy did not resign and at the next meeting, the Selectmen voted 4 to 1 to fire Kennedy. Kennedy's dismissal came one month after three new Selectmen were elected in a special recall election (all of whom voted to remove Kennedy). One of the reasons for firing Kennedy, according to Selectman Frederick Wagner, was the manager's decision to put curbing on the sidewalk in front of his Taylor Street home instead of on a sidewalk where children more frequently walked. Later life and death Kennedy later worked for Whitman & Howard, an engineering firm located in Boston, until his retirement at the age of 70. He died on January 26, 1983 at the St. Francis Home for the Aged in Laconia, New Hampshire. He was 82 years old.

Born at the Wierzchownia estate in VolhyniaJuanita Helm Floyd, Women in the Life of Balzac. Page 136. Kessinger Publishing, 2004 reprint. . Retrieved October 8, 2011. (now Ukraine), Ha≈Ñska married landowner Wac≈Çaw Ha≈Ñski (Wenceslas Hanski) when she was a teenager.Frederic Ewen, Heroic imagination: the creative genius of Europe... Page 498. New York University Press, 2004 reprint. . Ha≈Ñski, who was about 20 years her senior, suffered from depression. They had five children, but only a daughter, Anna, survived. In the late 1820s, Ha≈Ñska began reading Balzac's novels, and in 1832, she sent him an anonymous letter. This began a decades-long correspondence in which Ha≈Ñska and Balzac expressed a deep mutual affection. In 1833, they met for the first time, in Switzerland. Soon afterward he began writing the novel S√©raph√Æta, which includes a character based on Ha≈Ñska. After her husband died in 1841, a series of complications obstructed Ha≈Ñska's marriage to Balzac. Chief of these was the estate and her daughter Anna's inheritance, both of which might be threatened if she married him. Anna married a Polish count, easing some of the pressure. About the same time, Ha≈Ñska gave Balzac the idea for his 1844 novel Modeste Mignon. In 1850 they finally married, and moved to Paris, but he died five months later. Though she never remarried, she took several lovers, and died in 1882.  Biography   Family and early life  Ha≈Ñska was the fourth of seven children born to Adam Wawrzyniec Rzewuski and his wife, Justyna Rzewuska (n√©e Rdu≈Çtowska).Robb, p. 226; Pierrot, p. 12. Note that spelling changes for the feminine form of Polish surnames. Their family was established as Polish nobility, known for wealth and military prowess.Robb, p. 226. He states: \\"Eveline Hanska, the fourth of seven children, came from a historic Polish family, the Rzewuskis, many of them brilliant warriors, statesmen, adventurers and lunatics.\\" One ancestor had imprisoned his own mother in a tower to extract his part of an inheritance.Cronin, p. 153; Robb, p. 226; Korwin- Piotrowska (1938), p. 21. Ha≈Ñska's great-grandfather, Wac≈Çaw Rzewuski, was a famous writer and Grand Crown Hetman.Pierrot, p. 3. When the Russian Empire gained control of lands owned by the family through the Partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century, Rzewuski swore his allegiance to Catherine II. He was rewarded with a comfortable position in the ranks of the empire. Moving between assignments in Kiev, St. Petersburg, and elsewhere, he chose as his primary residence the village of Pohrebyszcze in the region of Vinnytsia.Pierrot, pp. 3‚Äì7; Robb, pp. 226‚Äì227. One historian compares the Rzewuski estate in Pohrebysche to \\"a little kingdom\\". She was born in the Pohrebyszcze castle, in the Kiev Governorate of Russian partition of Poland. Although scholars agree that Ha≈Ñska was born on 6 January, the year is disputed.Robb, p. 227; Pierrot, pp. 12‚Äì16; Korwin-Piotrowska (1933), pp. 20‚Äì21. Even the date of 6 January is contentious, and is complicated by the transition at the time from the Julian to Gregorian calendar. See Floyd, p. 203 and Pierrot, pp. 12‚Äì16. Her biographers and those of her Balzac offer conflicting evidence of her age, taken from correspondence, family records, and testimonies from descendants. Most estimates range between 1801 and 1806.Pierrot, pp. 12‚Äì16; Floyd, p. 203; Cronin, p. 153. Maurois implies on p. 219 that she was born in 1799. Balzac's biographer Graham Robb writes: \\"Balzac chose 1806 as her date of birth and he was probably right.\\"Robb, p. 227. Roger Pierrot's 1999 biography of Ha≈Ñska, however, contends that she was born in 1804.Pierrot, p. 14. His certainty is cited to an entry for Adam Rzewuski in the Dictionary of Polish Biography which gives his birth date as 24 December 1804. Eveline was born roughly one year earlier. Polish Biographical Dictionary gives 24 December 1805 (Georgian) which converts to 5 January 1805 (Julian). Like her brothers and sisters, Ha≈Ñska was educated by her parents about family lineage and religion. Her mother was a devout Catholic, but her father also taught the children about Voltairian rationality. The family was secluded in Pohrebyszcze, with only occasional trips away. Once a year, the family visited Kiev for a market gathering, during which Rzewuski sold grain and her mother purchased clothing and supplies for the estate. Ewelina had three brothers: Adam, Ernest and Henryk, and three sisters: Alina, Karolina (better known as Karolina Soba≈Ñska) and Paulina. Ha≈Ñska was closest to her brother Henryk, who later became famous for his work in the genre of Polish folk literature known as gawƒôda. They shared a passion for philosophical discussions, especially related to love and religion. Ha≈Ñska's other brothers, Adam and Ernest, both pursued military careers.Pierrot, pp. 49‚Äì55. Ha≈Ñska's eldest sister, Karolina, was admired as a child for her beauty, intellect, and musical talent. She later married a man 34 years her senior, a landowner from Podole named Hieronim Soba≈Ñski. They separated after two years, and she began a series of passionate affairs with some of her many suitors. These included the Russian general Ivan Ossipovitch Witt, the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, and the Russian writer Alexander Pushkin. The Tsar considered her behavior scandalous and declared her dangerously disloyal. As a result, Ha≈Ñska and the other Rzewuski women were watched carefully by police when they visited the Russian capital of St Petersburg.Gerson, p. 153. Ha≈Ñska's younger sisters, Alina and Paulina, married early into comfortable upper-class families. Alina married a wealthy landowner from Smilavichy, whose father had gained his fortune by managing property for the Ogi≈Ñski family. Her nephew Stanis≈Çaw Moniuszko became a renowned composer. Paulina married a banker from Odessa named Jan Rizniƒç.  Marriage to Ha≈Ñski  Ha≈Ñska's first husband Wac≈Çaw Ha≈Ñski was more than twenty years older than her.Robb, p. 227; Maurois, p. 219; Cronin, p. 155. In 1819 Eveline married Wac≈Çaw Ha≈Ñski, a noble who lived nearby at Verhivnya (Wierzchownia). Their marriage was a union of wealthy families, not of passion. His estate covered and employed over 3,000 serfs, including 300 domestic servants. The manor had been designed by a French architect, and its owner filled it with luxuries from around the world: paintings from galleries in Milan and London, dinnerware from China, and a library of 25,000 books in a variety of languages. Ha≈Ñski boasted that none of the furniture was Russian.Robb, p. 227; Gerson, pp. 151‚Äì152; Cronin, p. 155. Ha≈Ñski was more than twenty years older than Ewelina, who was a teenager at the time of their wedding, and his personality clashed with her youthful vigor. He spent most of the day supervising the grounds, by some accounts with an iron fist.Robb, p. 452 note 7. After dinner he was usually too fatigued to spend time with his wife, and retired early. He was generally dour, and lived with a depressed condition that Ha≈Ñska referred to as \\"blue devils\\". Although she was surrounded by opulence, Ha≈Ñska found herself dissatisfied with her new life and with her husband's emotional distance in particular. As one biographer put it: \\"He loved Eve but he was not deeply in love with her.\\" In the first five years of their marriage, Ha≈Ñska gave birth to five children, four of whom died as infants. The surviving daughter, Anna, was a welcome joy to Ha≈Ñska, and she trusted her care to a young governess named Henriette Borel who had moved to Wierzchownia from the Swiss town of Neuch√¢tel. The estate at Wierzchownia was isolated. Ha≈Ñska was bored by visits to the court at St. Petersburg, and even more bored by noble guests in her own home. She found nothing in common with the ladies of high society, and longed for the stimulating discussions she had enjoyed with her brother Henryk. She spent her time reading the books her husband imported from faraway lands.Gerson, p. 154; Cronin, pp. 157‚Äì158.  Becoming \\"The Stranger\\"  In her November 1832 letter, Ha≈Ñska told Honor√© de Balzac: \\"My heart has leapt as I read your works.\\"Quoted in Maurois, p. 218. One of the writers who most enchanted Ha≈Ñska was the French novelist Honor√© de Balzac. After laboring in pseudonymous obscurity for ten years, Balzac published Les Chouans (The Chouans) in 1829. A tale of star-crossed love amidst a royalist uprising in Brittany, it was the first work to which he signed his own name. Ha≈Ñska was intrigued by the glowing portrayal of the female protagonist, driven by true love to protect the object of her desire. She also enjoyed Balzac's Physiologie du mariage (The Physiology of Marriage), also published in 1829, which heaps satirical scorn on husbands and celebrates the virtue of married women.Cronin, p. 158; Maurois, p. 155. When she read his 1831 novel La Peau de chagrin (The Magic Skin), however, Ha≈Ñska was appalled by the coarse depiction of Foedora, the so-called \\"femme sans c≈ìur\\" (\\"woman without a heart\\"). She felt that Balzac had lost the reverence shown in his earlier works, and worried that he had based Foedora on a real woman from his life. Motivated partly by concern, partly by boredom, and partly by a desire to influence the life of a great writer (as her sister Karolina had done), she wrote to Balzac.Robb, pp. 226‚Äì227; Cronin, pp. 158‚Äì159; Korwin-Piotrowska (1938), pp. 68‚Äì70. On 28 February 1832 Ha≈Ñska posted a letter from Odessa with no return address. In it, she praised Balzac for his work, but scolded him for the negative portrayal of women in La Peau de chagrin. She urged a return to the glowing representations in his earlier novels, and signed enigmatically: \\"L'√âtrang√®re\\" (\\"The Stranger\\" or \\"The Foreigner\\").Maurois, p. 218; Dargan, p. 29; Robb, pp. 223‚Äì224. \\"L'√âtrang√®re\\" can also mean \\"The Foreigner\\".Some sources suggest that Ha≈Ñska had her daughter's governess write the actual letter as she dictated. See Cronin, pp. 158‚Äì159 and Gerson (who suggests an elaborate plan involving Ha≈Ñska's cousins), pp. 154‚Äì155. Balzac was intrigued by the letter; he took out a personal advertisement in the Gazette de France indicating his receipt of an anonymous letter and expressing regret for being unable to reply. She probably never saw this notice.Robb, p. 224; Maurois, p. 218; Gerson, p. 155. Cronin says on p. 163 that La Quotidienne was one of the only French newspapers allowed into Russia at the time. Ha≈Ñska wrote to Balzac several times during 1832.Cronin, p. 161; Robb, p. 224. The exact number of letters is unknown. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery: > Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its philosophical concepts appear to > be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still > young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I > know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and > feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your > outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you > have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to > show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be‚Äîa man > superior in his knowledge of the human heart. She insisted, however, that they could never meet, and indeed that he should never know her name: (\\"For you I am The Stranger, and shall remain so all my life.\\") Still, she wished for him to write back, so she advised him to place a notice in La Quotidienne to \\"L'√â\\" from \\"H.B.\\". He purchased a notice similar to the earlier one in the Gazette, and signed it according to her instructions.Maurois, p. 219; Cronin, p. 163; Gerson, p. 156. In her next letter Ha≈Ñska made arrangements for a trusted courier to collect letters from Balzac, and thereby allow for a direct correspondence. Before long she sent him the news that she and her husband would be traveling Europe, and visiting Vienna, Hanski's childhood home. They would also travel to the Swiss village of Neuch√¢tel, to visit the family of her daughter's governess. Contradicting her vow of eternal anonymity, she suggested a meeting. Balzac agreed immediately, and began to make preparations for the journey.Maurois, p. 228; Robb, p. 229. Also, sometime in 1833, Balzac wrote his first confession of love to her, despite being at that time in another relationship.  Meeting Balzac  In September 1833, after traveling to the French village of Besan√ßon to find cheap paper for a publishing enterprise, Balzac crossed into Switzerland and registered at the H√¥tel du Faucon under the name Marquis d'Entragues. He sent word to Ha≈Ñska that he would visit the garden of the Maison Andri√©, where she and her family were staying. He looked up and saw her face at the window, then ‚Äì as he described it later ‚Äì he \\"lost all bodily sensation\\".Quoted in Maurois, p. 229. They met later that day (September 25) at a spot overlooking Lake Neuch√¢tel; according to legend, he noticed a woman reading one of his books. He was overwhelmed with her beauty, and she wrote soon afterwards to her brother, describing Balzac as \\"cheerful and lovable just like you\\".Quoted in Robb, p. 240.Maurois, pp. 229‚Äì230; Cronin, pp. 168‚Äì169. Ha≈Ñska met Balzac for the first time in the Swiss village of Neuch√¢tel. Ha≈Ñska and Balzac met several times over the next five days, and her husband became enchanted with Balzac as well, inviting him to meals with the family. During a trip to Lake Biel, Ha≈Ñski went to arrange lunch, leaving his wife and Balzac alone. In the shade of a large oak tree, they kissed and exchanged vows of patience and fidelity. She told him of the family's plan to visit Geneva for Christmas; Balzac agreed to visit before the end of the year. Before he left Nauch√¢tel, she sent a passionate letter to his hotel: \\"Villain! Did you not see in my eyes all that I longed for? But have no fear, I felt all the desire that a woman in love seeks to provoke\\".Quoted in Maurois, p. 231. Arriving in Geneva on December 26, the Christmas Eve, Balzac stayed at the Auberge de l'Arc, near the Maison Mirabaud where the Ha≈Ñski family had settled for the season. She left a ring for him at the hotel, with a note asking for a new promise of love. He gave it, and described how he began wearing the ring on his left hand, \\"with which I hold my paper, so that the thought of you clasps me tight.\\"Quoted in Cronin, p. 173. At this time he began working on a philosophical novel, S√©raph√Æta, about a hermaphroditic angel united by the love of a mortal man for a compassionate and sensual woman. Balzac explained that she was his model for the latter.Maurois, pp. 238‚Äì239 and 244; Cronin, p. 173. It was clear to all that Ha≈Ñski was in ill health, and Ha≈Ñska began to think about her future with the French author. In the meantime, she asked Balzac to begin collecting for her autographs of the famous people he spent time with in Paris and elsewhere.Cronin, p. 173. After leaving Geneva on 8 February, the Ha≈Ñski family spent several months visiting the major cities of Italy. In Florence the sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini started work on a bust of Ha≈Ñska.Pierrot, p. 90. In the summer of 1834 they returned to Vienna, where they would stay for another year. During this time Balzac continued writing to Ha≈Ñska, and by accident two especially amorous letters fell into the hands of her husband. He wrote to the French author, furious, and demanded an explanation. Balzac wrote to Ha≈Ñski claiming that it was nothing more than a game: \\"One evening, in jest, she said to me that she would like to know what a love-letter was. This was said wholly without meaning.... I wrote those two unfortunate letters to Vienna, supposing that she remembered our joke....\\"Balzac, p. 200. Ha≈Ñski apparently accepted the explanation, and invited Balzac to visit them in Vienna, which he did in May 1835.Maurois, p. 253; Cronin, pp. 174‚Äì175; Gerson, pp. 201‚Äì203; Pierrot, p. 92. Balzac's biographers agree that, despite his vows of loyalty to Ha≈Ñska, he conducted affairs with several women during the 1830s, and may have fathered children with two of them. One was an Englishwoman named Sarah who had married the Count Emilio Guidoboni-Visconti. Ha≈Ñska wrote to Balzac about these rumors in 1836, and he flatly denied them. Her suspicion was raised again, however, when he later dedicated his novel B√©atrix to \\"Sarah\\".Cronin, pp. 176‚Äì177; Robb, pp. 266‚Äì267; Maurois, pp. 305‚Äì313. Balzac also corresponded with Ha≈Ñski; while most of their family disapproved of Balzac, Ha≈Ñski respected him, and the two exchanged letters on literature and agronomy. Andrzej Biernacki, HA≈ÉSKI Wac≈Çaw (1782‚Äì1841) marsza≈Çek szlachty wo≈Çy≈Ñskiej, Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny, t. 9 p. 287-288 Meanwhile, Ha≈Ñska was experiencing a renewal of religious interest, partly because her daughter's governess, Henriette Borel, left to join a nunnery in Paris. Ha≈Ñska taught her daughter Anna from the works of Christian scholars including Jean Baptiste Massillon and St. Fran√ßois de Sales.Maurois, p. 429. Her religious interest was more towards mysticism than mainstream religions; she corresponded with Baroness Barbara von Kr√ºdener, and read on Rosicrucianism, Martinism and Swedenborgianism. Balzac treated this attack of devotion with the sharpest disapproval. When Balzac sent her works in progress, her only replies were moral queries, rather than the stylistic criticism for which he hoped.Cronin, pp. 178‚Äì179.  Ha≈Ñski's death  After her first husband's death, Ha≈Ñska rejected advances from composer Franz Liszt.Maurois, p. 448; Robb, p. 340; Cronin, p. 186. Ha≈Ñski died in November 1841.Pierrot, pp. 151‚Äì152. The cause of his death remains unclear, and sources disagree on the date. Pierrot says 29 November is \\"le plus vraisemblable\\" (most likely). She sent Balzac a letter, sealed in black, with the news. He instantly wrote back: \\"je n'en aurais peut-√™tre pas voulu recevoir d'autre de vous, malgr√© ce que vous me dites de triste sur vous et votre sant√©\\" (\\"I could not perhaps wish to have received any other [news] from you, in spite of the sad things you tell me about yourself and your health\\").Balzac, p. 504. He made plans to visit Dresden in May, and obtain a visa to visit her in Russia.Cronin, p. 183. The future, however, was not as simple as Balzac wanted to believe. Ha≈Ñska's family did not approve of the French author; her Aunt Rozalia was especially disdainful. To make matters worse, her late husband's uncle protested the Ha≈Ñski's will in which she had inherited Ha≈Ñski's estate. Horrified that her daughter would be robbed of everything, Ha≈Ñska insisted that she must end her relationship with Balzac. \\"You are free\\", she wrote to him.Maurois, p. 431; Cronin, p. 182. As she made plans to protest the uncle's interference in St. Petersburg, Balzac wrote back to offer his help. He suggested that he could become a Russian citizen and \\"go to the Czar myself and ask him to sanction our marriage\\".Quoted in Maurois, p. 433. She asked for his patience, which he offered anew.Cronin, p. 182. Soon after she arrived in the Russian capital of St. Petersburg, in order to resolve some of the litigation issues surrounding her inheritance, she took Anna to a recital by the Hungarian composer and pianist Franz Liszt. Although she did not succumb to Lisztomania, she was impressed by his musical talent and his good looks. \\"He is an extraordinary mixture\\", she wrote in her diary, \\"and I enjoy studying him.\\"Quoted in Maurois, p. 448. They saw one another on several occasions, but she ultimately rejected his advances. One biographer says that their last meeting \\"gives striking evidence of her loyalty to Balzac\\".Robb, p. 340. In late July 1843 Balzac visited her in St. Petersburg, the first time they had seen one another in eight years. He was struck by Ha≈Ñska's resilient beauty, but his condition had deteriorated over the years. Biographers agree that she was much less physically attracted to him at this time.Robb, pp. 354‚Äì355; Cronin, pp. 183‚Äì184. Still they renewed their vows of love and planned to marry as soon as she won her lawsuit. In early October he returned to Paris.Robb, p. 355; Cronin, p. 185. Soon afterwards, she wrote a story based on her own experience writing to Balzac for the first time. Unhappy with it, she threw it into the fire, but the French author begged her to rewrite it so he could adapt it. He assured her that she would \\"know something of the joys of authorship when you see how much of your elegant and delightful writing I have preserved\\".Quoted in Maurois, p. 454. Her story became Modeste Mignon, Balzac's 1844 novel about a young woman who writes to her favorite poet.Maurois, pp. 453‚Äì455; Cronin, pp. 186‚Äì187. Also in 1844 Ha≈Ñska won her lawsuit. The wealth of her late husband's estate would go to Anna, who had become engaged to a Polish Count, Jerzy Mniszech. They planned to marry in 1846, after which time Ha≈Ñska would bestow the inheritance. Thus Ha≈Ñska's marriage to Balzac would have to wait.Cronin, p. 188; Maurois, pp. 462‚Äì466; Robb, pp. 360‚Äì361. In the meantime, two urgent problems began to complicate their plans. One was his health, which had been deteriorating for years. In October 1843 he wrote to her about \\"horrible suffering which has its seat nowhere; which cannot be described; which attacks both heart and brain\\".Balzac, p. 612. Balzac's other problem was financial: despite his illness, he could not afford to relax his work schedule, since he owed more than 200,000 francs to various creditors.Robb, p. 360.  Second marriage and widowhood  The house Balzac bought for Ha≈Ñska (with her money) was built before the French Revolution by banker Nicolas Beaujon.Maurois, p. 478; Robb, p. 372. Ha≈Ñska and Balzac were determined, however, and in 1845 she visited him in Paris with Anna and Jerzy. In April of the following year they visited Italy; Balzac joined them for a tour of Rome, and they proceeded to Geneva.Cronin, p. 188; Robb, pp. 362 and 364. Soon after he returned to Paris, she wrote with the news that she was pregnant. Balzac was overjoyed, certain that they would have a boy, and insisting on the name Victor-Honor√©. The thought of having a son, he wrote, \\"stirs my heart and makes me write page upon page\\".Quoted in Robb, p. 371. To avoid scandal, he would have to marry Ha≈Ñska in secret, to hide the fact that their child was conceived out of wedlock. In the meantime, Anna married Jerzy Mniszech on 13 October in Wiesbaden. Balzac served as a witness and wrote an announcement for the Paris newspapers, which offended Ha≈Ñska's sister Alina.Maurois, pp. 476 and 485; Cronin, p. 190; Robb, p. 371. Ha≈Ñska, living for a time in Dresden, was not soothed, either, by Balzac's disregard for financial stability. For years he had planned to buy a house for them to share, but in August 1846 she sent him a stern admonition. Until his debts were paid, she wrote, \\"we must postpone buying any property\\".Quoted in Maurois, p. 478. One month later he purchased a house on the Rue Fortun√©e for 50,000 francs.Cronin, p. 190; Robb, p. 371; Maurois, p. 478. Having collected finery from his many travels, he searched across Europe for items to properly complete the furnishings: carpets from Smyrna, embroidered pillowcases from Germany, and a handle for the lavatory chain crafted from Bohemian glass.Maurois, pp. 482‚Äì483. In November, Ha≈Ñska suffered a miscarriage; she wrote to Balzac with the tragic news. He wanted to visit her, but Anna wrote asking him to remain in Paris. The emotion involved, she wrote, \\"would be fatal\\".Quoted in Maurois, p. 488. Ha≈Ñska made plans to return to Wierzchownia, but Balzac begged her to visit him, which she did in the spring of 1847.Maurois, pp. 488‚Äì492; Robb, pp. 374‚Äì375. As soon as she was back in Ukraine, however, a new wrinkle unfolded. Ha≈Ñska had long been unhappy with the presence of Balzac's housekeeper, Louise Breugniot, and he promised to break with her before marrying. He wrote with alarm to Ha≈Ñska explaining that Breugninot had stolen her letters to him and blackmailed the author for 30,000 francs. Biographers disagree about truth of this story; Robb suggests it was \\"a convincing hysterical performance put on for the benefit of his jealous fianc√©e\\".Robb, p. 377. He adds: \\"Whether or not Louise Breugniot actually resorted to blackmail, Balzac's righteous horror at her evil deeds, the contradictions in the details he gave to Eveline, and his decision not to prosecute all point to a furious burning of bridges.\\"Cronin (p. 194) and Maurois (p. 502) insist that blackmail was indeed afoot. Before Balzac's death, Ha≈Ñska was visited often by Victor Hugo. Still, Balzac believed that keeping her letters was dangerous and, in a moment of characteristic impulse, threw them into the fire. He described it to her as \\"the saddest and most frightful day of my life ... I am looking at the ashes as I write to you, and I tremble seeing how little space fifteen years takes up.\\"Quoted in Cronin, pp. 194‚Äì195. On 5 September 1847 he left Paris to join her for the first time in Wierzchownia.Robb, p. 378; Maurois, p. 510. They spent several happy months together, but financial obligations required his presence in France. The Revolution of 1848 began one week after his return.Robb, pp. 383‚Äì384. Back in Wierzchownia, Ha≈Ñska lost 80,000 francs due to a granary fire, and her time was consumed with three lawsuits. These complications, and Balzac's constant debt, meant that their finances were unstable, and she hesitated anew at the idea of marriage. In any case, a wedding would be impossible without approval from the Tsar, which he did not grant until spring of 1850.Cronin, pp. 196‚Äì200; Maurois, pp. 529‚Äì530 and 539. On 2 July 1849 Russian authorities responding to Balzac's request in December 1847 to marry Ha≈Ñska stated that he could do so, but that Ha≈Ñska could not keep her land. Balzac returned to Wierzchownia in October, and immediately fell ill with heart issues. His condition deteriorated throughout 1849, and doubts persisted in her mind about their union. Biographers generally agree that Ha≈Ñska was convinced by Balzac's frail state and endless devotion. One wrote: \\"It was charity, as much as love or fame, which finally turned the scale.\\"Maurois, p. 539. Robb indicates that the wedding was \\"surely an act of compassion on her part\\".Robb, p. 403. To avoid rumors and suspicion from the Tsar, Ha≈Ñska transferred ownership of the estate to her daughter. On 14 March 1850 they traveled to Berdychiv and, accompanied by Anna and Jerzy, were married in a small ceremony at the parish church of St. Barbara.Maurois, p. 539; Robb, p. 403. Both Ha≈Ñska and Balzac took ill after the wedding; she suffered from a severe attack of gout, for which her doctor prescribed an unusual treatment: \\"Every other day she has to thrust her feet into the body of a sucking-pig which has only just been slit open, because it is necessary that the entrails should be quivering.\\"Quoted in Maurois, p. 539. The doctor goes on to suggest that Ha≈Ñska's noble position obviates concern for the animal: \\"No need to describe the agonized squeals of the little pig, which does not realize the honour that is being done it.\\" She recovered, but he did not. They returned to Paris in late May, and his health improved slightly at the start of summer. By July, however, he was confined to his bed. Ha≈Ñska nursed him constantly, as a stream of visitors ‚Äì including the writers Victor Hugo and Henri Murger ‚Äì came to pay their respects. When Balzac's vision started to give out, she began to act as his secretary, helping him with his writing. In mid-August Balzac succumbed to gangrene and began having fits of delirium. At one point he called out for Horace Bianchon, the fictional doctor he had included in many novels.Robb, p. 409. He suggests that this was \\"surely a humorous recognition that nothing now could save him\\". But he also expressed great worry for Ha≈Ñska, once telling Hugo: \\"My wife is more intelligent than I, but who will support her in her solitude? I have accustomed her to so much love.\\"Quoted in Robb, p. 409. He died on 18 August 1850.Robb, pp. 409‚Äì410; Cronin, p. 210; Maurois, pp. 548‚Äì549. As most of Balzac's biographers point out, Ha≈Ñska was not in the room when he died. Robb says she \\"must have retired for a moment\\",Robb, p. 409. while Andr√© Maurois notes that she had been by his side for weeks with no way of knowing how long it would continue, and \\"there was nothing to be done\\".Maurois, p. 548. Vincent Cronin attributes her absence to the nature of their relationship: \\"From the first day by the lakeside at Neuch√¢tel theirs had been a Romantic love and Eve wanted to guard it to the end against that terrible taint of corruption.\\"Cronin, p. 210.  Later years and death  Ha≈Ñska spent her last thirty years in a relationship with painter Jean Gigoux. Ha≈Ñska lived with Balzac's mother for a time after his death, in the house he had spent so much time and expense furnishing. The elder Mme. Balzac moved in with a friend after several months, and Ha≈Ñska approached the remains of her late husband's writing. Several works had been left incomplete, and publishers inquired about releasing a final edition of his grand collection La Com√©die humaine. Ha≈Ñska sponsored new editions of his works and was involved in editing some of them, even adding occasional content. Balzac's debt, meanwhile, still exceeded 200,000 francs, which Ha≈Ñska paid while also providing for his mother's living expenses. One of her letters at the time gives voice to her frustrations: \\"In nursing my husband's incurable malady I ruined my health, just as I have ruined my private fortune in accepting the inheritance of debts and embarrassments which he left me.\\" Anna and Jerzy moved into a nearby house in Paris.Maurois, p. 555; Cronin, pp. 210‚Äì212. Despite her obligations, Ha≈Ñska was a beautiful unmarried woman of means living in Paris. The writer Jules Am√©d√©e Barbey d'Aurevilly described her this way: \\"Her beauty was imposing and noble, somewhat massive, a little fleshy, but even in stoutness she retained a very lively charm which was spiced with a delightful foreign accent and a striking hint of sensuality.\\" As she began sorting through Balzac's papers, she called on his friend, Champfleury, for assistance. As they worked one evening, he complained of a headache. \\"I'll make it go away,\\" she said, and began massaging his forehead. As he wrote later: \\"There are certain magnetic effluvia, in such situations, of which the effect is that the matter does not stop there.\\" Her affair with the man twenty years her junior was brief, but it provided a tremendous release to Ha≈Ñska, who had spent decades with older men in various states of ill health. She began partaking of the social life around her. \\"The night before last I laughed as I have never done before,\\" she wrote in 1851. \\"Oh, how wonderful it is not to know anyone or have to worry about anyone, to have one's independence, liberty on the mountain-tops, and to be in Paris!\\" Champfleury was intimidated by her vitality and jealousy, and removed himself from her life. On his recommendation, she turned creative control of Balzac's unfinished novels Le D√©put√© d'Arcis and Les Petits Bourgeois to another writer, Charles Rabou. Rabou added extensively to them and published both books in 1854. To soothe the publisher, Ha≈Ñska falsely claimed that Balzac had chosen Rabou as his literary successor.Robb, p. 414. Ha≈Ñska met the painter Jean Gigoux when she hired him in 1851 to paint Anna's portrait. They began a relationship that lasted many years, but never married. Over the next thirty years, Ha≈Ñska and particularly her spend-thrift daughter spent the remainder of their fortune on fine clothing and jewelry. Jerzy, meanwhile, succumbed to mental disorders and died in 1881, leaving behind a trail of debts. Ha≈Ñska was forced to sell the house, but was allowed to continue living there. She died on 11 April 1882 and was buried in Balzac's grave at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Influence on Balzac's works Eveline was an inspiration for many of Balzac's characters. She can be seen as the model for La Fosseue, Mme Claes, Modesta Mignon, Ursule Mirouet, Adelina Houlot, and especially Eugenie Grandet and Mme de Mortsauf. There is less agreement among scholars on whether she was also the inspiration for more negative characters such as Fedora and lady Dudley, as Balzac seems to have used her mostly as a model for more positive personas. His works also mention numerous characters named Eve or Eveline, and have several dedications to her. In addition to Eveline, her daughter Anna, sister Alina, aunt Rozalia, first love (Tadeusz Wyle≈ºy≈Ñski), and several other figures that she introduced Balzac to or told him about, were also incorporated into his works. After they met, Poland, Polish topics, Polish names, and Polish (Slavic) mysticism began to appear much more frequently in his works, as exemplified by such characters as Hoene Wro≈Ñski, Grabianka and General Chodkiewicz. Defenders and detractors Ha≈Ñska became a controversial figure among the biographers and researchers of Balzac. As Zygmunt Czerny notes, the \\"mysterious Pole\\" was criticized by some (Henry Bordeaux, Octave Mirbeau (La Mort de Balzac), Adolf Nowaczy≈Ñski, J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski, Charles L√©ger and Pierre Descaves), and praised by others (Philippe Bertault, Marcel Bouteron, Barbey d'Aurevilly, Sophie de Korwin- Piotrowska, Tadeusz Boy-≈ªele≈Ñski, Tadeusz Grabowski, Juanita Helm Floyd and Andr√© Billy). Czerny notes that one of the \\"greatest experts on Balzac\\", Spoelberch de Lovenjoul, referred to her as \\"one of the best women of the epoch\\", and that while there are those who deride her influence on Balzac, and question her feelings and motivations, few deny she had a crucial impact on him, and, for most, the \\"Great Balzac\\" emerged only after meeting her in early 1830s. Czerny concludes by saying: \\"However one could analyze her and their relationship, the impact of her love on Balzac was persistent, all-enveloping and decisive\\".

The valves are thin and rather brittle. The edges are parallel, tapering slightly towards the posterior and are off white with transverse bands of brown. The shell is sculpted with fine co-marginal lines and the annual growth lines can be seen. The inner side of the shell is white with a purplish sheen. The periostracum is olive green and the foot is reddish.Marine Bivalve Shells of the British Isles Two identifying features are that the posterior adductor muscle is positioned some one and a half times its own length from the pallial sinus, and that the muscle that retracts the foot is posterior to the insertion point of the ligature.

It is common around the coasts of Britain.Marine Life Information Network Biology Ensis ensis burrows into clean or silty sand on the seabed in the neritic zone and the low intertidal zone. When covered with water this bivalve remains close to the surface but when disturbed or when the substrate is exposed it descends to half a metre below the surface. It can tunnel with great rapidity.Fish, J.D. and Fish, S. (1996) A student‚Äôs guide to the seashore. Second Edition. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. It has two short siphons that normally extend up to the surface of the sand. It draws in water through one siphon and expels it through the other. By this means it both respires and extracts food particles from the water at the same time. At low tide, a keyhole-shaped depression in the sand is often the only visible sign that the bivalve is present. Ensis ensis becomes mature at about three years old and may live for ten. Reproduction takes place in the spring and the larvae are pelagic and form part of the zooplankton. After about a month they settle out and burrow into the substrate.

The single release was first announced on July 11, 2011. Two days later, Black unveiled the single's artwork through her Twitter account. On July 18, the accompanying music video was uploaded on Black's YouTube channel,Black, Rebecca (July 18, 2011). . RB Records. Retrieved July 19, 2011. while the single was released digitally on the iTunes Store on July 19. Composition \\"My Moment\\" is a self-empowerment song that lasts for three minutes and twenty-five seconds. It is composed in the key of E major, simply using three major chords (E, B, and A, respectively). According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, the song \\"is addressing all those haters who didn't necessarily get her last viral smash, \\"Friday\\". Black starts singing the lyrics \\"Weren't you the one who said that I would be nothing? / Well, I'm about to prove you wrong / I'm not the only one who believes in something / My one wish is about to come true.\\" As the song goes, Black addresses her negative reception even more, singing, \\"Haters, said I'll see you later/Can't talk to you right now/I'm getting my paper\\". \\"My Moment\\" features a simple mid-tempo melody with a prominent uses of garish keyboards on its background. Uses of pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune on Black's vocals were also noticed. Critical reception Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly said that, unlike Black's previous song, \\"My Moment\\" was not so bad it's good, and Michelle Woo of OC Weekly described \\"My Moment\\" as \\"a lot less terrible\\" than \\"Friday\\", making it \\"less awesome\\". Many compared the production to that of \\"Friday\\". Mike Hale of The New York Times criticized Black's vocals for being \\"as heavily processed\\" as they were previously, but said that the tuning had \\"been done much more artfully\\", meaning Black sounded \\"more like a human being.\\" A reviewer for The Huffington Post said, \\"if you were hoping for \\"Friday\\" part two, this certainly isn't it. Gone is the weird nasal, overly auto-tuned voice that made 'Friday' sound like she was saying 'fried egg.'\\" Black herself was called \\"sweet but very self empowered\\" by Stransky, and Adrian Chen of Gawker called the track \\"a 'look-at-me-now' love letter\\" to all [Black's] haters\\". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard saw the song in a similar light; for him, Black \\"does offer a bit of vitriol to those who wrote her off as a one-hit Internet wonder.\\" The song was compared to Radio Disney songs and the music of Justin Bieber. While Chen called it \\"inoffensive\\" and \\"mildly catchy\\", other reviewers were less sympathetic. Jenni Dunning, of the Toronto Star, said that while \\"you might find it possible to listen to the whole song without flinching as much at her nasally voice [...] that doesn‚Äôt make it good.\\" Daniel Kreps, of Yahoo! Music, was even more critical, saying that nobody could like \\"My Moment\\", not even ironically. Music video The music video, directed by Morgan Lawley, was released through Black's YouTube channel on July 18, 2011, and a behind-the- scenes video was uploaded the day after.Black, Rebecca (July 19, 2011). .

Mayor First term Renaud was elected as mayor of Saint-Leonard in September 1984, winning a by-election that followed di Ciocco's death. This election was extremely divisive, dominated by a rival candidate's charge that the city had acted improperly in a land purchase; after the vote, Renaud filed libel suits against both of his opponents.Barry Cliff, \\"Renaud going ahead with suits against political foes; Cases might not be heard during mayor's current term,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 January 1985, X5. Renaud's newly formed Ralliement de Saint-L√©onard became the majority party on council in this period, including in its ranks many former members of the defunct Renewal Party.

A Quebec Superior Court judge later ruled that this decision was unjust.\\"Ex-mayor's secretary unjustly fired - court,\\" Montreal Gazette, 2 July 1987, C16.

This came about as a result of the decision to disband the 6th Brigade,. which resulted in 7th Brigade becoming an integrated Regular and Reserve unit.. By 1999, the battalion had an authorised strength of 647 personnel, of which 55 per cent were Reservists. When the 7th Brigade was reorganised in 2007 as a primarily Regular motorised brigade, although major Reserve elements were transferred to the 11th Brigade, 7 CSSB continued to maintain a small Reserve element.. Operational experience 7 CSSB regularly supports operational deployments in all ADF theatres with individual and small group reinforcements. In late 2003, 7 CSSB supported the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR)-based \\"Australian Battalion IX\\" (AUSBAT 9) deployment to Timor Leste as part of Operation Citadel.. They returned to Brisbane in mid-June 2004.. In 2005, elements of the battalion deployed to Iraq as part of SECDET, which was during Operation Catalyst. In 2007-08, the 7th Brigade provided the main force elements for the fourth rotation of the Australian Overwatch Battle Group (West) (OBG(W)-4). Elements of 7 CSSB deployed in support OBG(W)-4, whilst the unit also contributed personnel to the Australian Army Training Team (AATT). In 2010, elements of the battalion were deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Slipper. While the majority of the battalion's force was part of the Force Support Unit based in Tarin Kowt, Kandahar and Al Minhad Air Base, elements also deployed in support of the 6 RAR-based 1st Mentoring Task Force (MTF-1) combined arms battle group that was deployed to Uruzgan province to conduct counter- insurgency operations. Current role and structure Based at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, the battalion is staffed by Regular Army personnel from various service support corps of the Army. In 2012, the battalion underwent a significant restructure which saw both the detachment of Health Company to the Joint Health Command and 17th CSS Brigade, and the re-establishment of \\"corps-based\\" sub units. As a result, 7 CSSB now consists of a Battalion HQ, Administration Company, 5th Transport Squadron, 6th Field Supply Company, and 106th Field Workshop Squadron. This restructure is significant as it re-establishes the links with the unit's predecessors in 6 BASB and previously independent sub units. In 2019, the battalion was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Colin Lingo. In October 2016, the battalion re-raised the 2nd Transport Squadron, consisting of 38 vehicles spread across two protected mobility vehicle troops and a medium-lift troop. The squadron traces its lineage back to the 2nd Company, Australian Army Service Corps, which was raised in August 1914 for service during World War.

It replaced the European Payments Union which ended in 1958. The EMA was administered by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD did this to achieve economic integration by coordinating the exchange rates of the 17 member countries. This allowed the countries to directly convert their currencies and integrate their balance of payments accounts, which promoted free trade. Due to advanced facilities offered by the International Monetary Fund, the EMA was ended in 1972. The European Economic Community oversaw the EMA aiming to achieve a greater level of economic integration within Europe. The European Economic Community was the legal successor at the time, however it has advanced and is now referred to as the European Union.  History  Europe during the Second World War: 1941-1942 Prior to the European Monetary Agreement, the European Payments Union was the agreement in place. This was an organisation which was bilateral in nature, and enabled trade between the European countries through an automatic credit system. The credit system within the framework of the European Payments Union was imposed to make transfers and recognition of credit between countries automatic. There was trade discrimination which still occurred with these features of the European Payments Union, and this resulted in the increased stagnation of intra- European trade. The EMA was implemented following this to boost the trade and economic growth of the member states. This was done in order to rebuild the individual economies within Europe, so that the overall European economy could recover from this situation which had been created by the prior agreements and organisations. One difference that was noticed in the EMA compared with the European Payments Union was greater coordination of individual exchange rates held by each country for monthly settlements. This was instead of using a single exchange rate to cover all countries for settlements. Additionally, the EMA was a multilateral system and allowed a smaller amount of interim finance, a form of short-term borrowing, to be taken between countries in comparison to the European Payments Union. The loan granting as well as the multilateral settlements imposed by the EMA were not automatic or mandatory, which was a new aspect compared to prior organisations. These changes were implemented to achieve currency convertibility and the overarching aim of the EMA. As a continuation from the European Payments Union, the EMA similarly had a managing board which regularly monitored the developments of the member countries. This was done particularly through individual consultations about their exchange rate policies and balance of payments. From the impact of the European Payments Union, the trade deficit across Europe had recovered and overall trade increased within member countries. As a result of this, the countries also had greater financial stability. Due to the Second World War, currency convertibility was not an immediate option for most countries as there was a significant imbalance across the global economy. This imbalance was primarily created from the deficit in the current account of Europe following the War. This meant the feat of currency convertibility had to be slowly worked towards over the long-term, as the balance of payments in Europe was impacted by the trade deficit. Currency convertibility was then eventually achieved through the EMA. Prior to the EMA, countries feared they would lose financial reserves if currency convertibility was implemented, and thus this formed part of the debate around the European multilateral convertibility. There was potential for loss of financial reserves as these are used to influence the rate of exchange, which would not have been necessary once currency convertibility was in place.  Aim  There were various goals which were set out to be achieved through the implementation of the European Monetary Agreement, however there was one main aim. The aim of the EMA was to reduce the short-term credit, a form of loans, that was received between the member countries from one another. It was hoped this would be achieved through the changes made when moving from the European Payments Union to the EMA. The EMA was a short-term phase as part of a long-term plan for the economic integration of Europe. It followed previous agreements which were all created to boost the growth and development of the European economy. This was done particularly through trade liberalisation and increased production, following the effects of the Second World War. It was hoped that a high level of trade liberalisation could be maintained between the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, even if they did not yet have convertible currencies. Through the implementation of the EMA, it was intended that this agreement would eventually help Europe move towards an overall monetary union. The EMA was a framework arranged to further progress the work of the European Payments Union, which was responsible for the cooperation of exchange of goods and services between countries. In doing this, the EMA hoped to assist the European Economic Community. It hoped to do this by achieving a fixed exchange rate system, consistent economic policy, and a union where factors of production such as capital and particularly labour were free to move around.  Economic vs. Political Motivations  The journey to economic integration, of which the European Monetary Agreement was a small part, was instigated due to a range of political motivations and historical views. With the decisions and policies implemented, both prior to and during the EMA, there was debate around whether these were inspired by political or economic objectives. The idea of a common institutional framework required the cooperation of individual economic policies as well as the political policies of member governments. This meant that political rivalry across the European countries was lessened, in order to achieve mutual economic cooperation, which also led to increased political integration. The increased integration formed by the EMA also resulted in a loss of national autonomy and sovereignty for the member governments and their nations. The individual governments within the EMA were required to give up their autonomous use of certain policies, in particular fiscal policy and monetary policy. This element of political integration was required in order for the EMA to achieve unity across the exchange rates and trade policies within Europe. Through the views of economic stakeholders and politicians, as well as events such as the falling of the Berlin Wall and Germany‚Äôs recovery from war, Europeans became satisfied with the idea of economic integration in Europe. The European countries were motivated by the prospect of economic recovery following the war. This led to stability and a high degree of coordination of the political policies across the member countries within Europe. There were concerns about the political nature of this integration, and through agreements such as the EMA, the accelerated globalisation and economic growth which could be achieved became clear. Although, following the economic and political integration that had been implemented within the EMA, there were some countries which preferred a system of only economic integration. In the 1950s following the establishment of the EMA, these countries, including Denmark, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland and Austria chose to form their own external free trade areas. These free trade areas were not focused on political integration, rather solely on achieving the economic objectives and policies of the countries. One example was the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The formation of free trade areas such as EFTA showcased the divide in views between the member nations of the EMA. EFTA also portrayed how each country had different motivations in terms of what they believed was required to achieve economic growth and economic development through integration.  Impacts  Current member states of the European Union  Economic & Political Repercussions  All financial transactions which occurred as a result of the European Monetary Agreement were managed by the Bank for International Settlements. The policy changes made through the EMA established greater currency convertibility for members of the agreement. This enabled currencies of countries within the agreement to be exchanged freely. The impact of currency convertibility was due to the removal of many exchange restrictions as well as the removal of limits on imports. These actions meant that less barriers to trade were in place. This enabled the countries in the agreement to trade with greater freedom, further improving the degree of economic integration across Europe. Due to the economic stability achieved through this level of currency convertibility, high levels of employment and economic growth were achieved both domestically across the member countries, as well as across the overall economy of this agreement. However, complete currency convertibility within Europe was not achieved until the late 1980s. The EMA was one part of the European Economic Community‚Äôs plan, which was to achieve overall economic integration in the long run. The EMA contributed to this through the currency convertibility which established a pathway to a European common currency and a common central bank. The EMA had short-term impacts, however it also played a role in the final establishment of the European Union. The European Union is the current monetary union which possesses a common currency, the Euro, and demonstrates a high level of cooperation and integration between the member countries. This existence of a common currency and central bank was contributed to by the EMA. This enabled price stability and social protection for the citizens of Europe under a common law. Other than economic integration, the EMA also contributed to an improved level of political unity. This was through the higher level of cooperation it established between governments, particularly with government trade policies. Governments of the member countries were able to cooperate in all trade deals made with non-member countries. Although, this political unity which arose from the high level of integration meant that the individual governments lost policies such as monetary policy as instruments of their own individual economic policy.  Successors  There have been various successors to the European Monetary Agreement, including the European Monetary System which began in 1979, the Single European Act which started operating in 1987, as well as the Common Agricultural Policy. These also impacted the European economy, in particular through promoting trade and building on the financial credit system developed by the EMA. There continues to be policies and arrangements implemented to continue the development of economic integration within Europe, even though the outcomes of many of the prior policies have already been achieved. Overtime, economic integration within Europe, including the impacts of the EMA as well as its predecessors and successors, has been referred to as a project which promised different outcomes to three specific generations. It was stated by Beno√Æt C≈ìur√©, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, that these groups of people were expected to be impacted differently from the European economic integration based on their history and socioeconomic status. For the generation following war, their expectation from this integration was lifelong democracy and peace. The generation from Europe who experienced the falling of the Berlin Wall during their youth were assured they would have greater opportunities and freedom in their life. The other collective of people to be affected by the European integration were European workers impacted by increased global competition and changes in technology. These people were guaranteed there would be both social and economic security to protect them from the increased production worldwide. The third promise is yet to be fulfilled, as since this integration began there have been high levels of unemployment, in particular youth unemployment. Although, the European economic integration following the EMA has led to various developments and continues to be updated under the European Union.

The company was the first to offer a micro-payment solution for social networking application developers shortly after Facebook opened its Facebook Platform. It operated a virtual goods monetization platform that allowed users to deposit funds into a central Spare Change account that they could then spend across multiple games and applications on the social network, and was a precursor to Facebook Credits. The company pioneered and evangelized the move for app developers away from advertising based monetization models toward micro-payment models and the sale of virtual goods. In March 2009, Spare Change was reported to be processing $30M of payments across 700 applications on Facebook, MySpace and Bebo and to have over 1M wallet accounts. Company history Spare Change Payments was founded in 2007 by Mark Rose, Simon Ru and Lex Bayer, with offices in Cupertino, California. In April 2009, the company was acquired by PlaySpan, which was subsequently acquired for $190M by Visa Inc, in February 2011. The staff and technology at Spare Change and PlaySpan was ultimately used to build out Visa Checkout. Visa designed Visa Checkout to be quick and tailor for mobile shopping experience.

It was designated as a Michigan State Historic Site on September 17, 1957 and later added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 3, 1971. It was the first property in Lapeer County to be listed on either registry. Back view of the courthouse The courthouse is a rectangular, wood, two-story structure built on a raised foundation in the style of Greek Revival architecture. On the inside, a circuit court room is located on the second floor with jury room; administrative offices are located on the ground floor; and restrooms are located in the basement. The building also houses a Lapeer County Historical Society display with some vintage furnishings. With limited space, the police station, probate court, jail, and several other offices and courtrooms are now located behind the courthouse in a newer complex located at 255 Clay Street. The Lapeer County Courthouse is among the earliest of its kind built in the state. It is recognized as the oldest original courthouse structure still in use in the state of Michigan and one of the 10 oldest such structures in all of the country. Lapeer County was formed in 1822 with the city of Lapeer being established as the county seat in 1831. The structure is recognized as having been first constructed in 1839, although this represents an earlier structure built on the site. The date on the pediment states 1846, which is the date that the current structure was completed‚Äîhaving been started the previous year. It was commissioned by state representative and state senator Alvin N. Hart, who lobbied successfully for Lapeer to continue to serve as the county seat. Hart sold the structure to the Board of Supervisors of Lapeer County for $4,500 in 1853. The first local Grange in Michigan was founded at this site in 1872. Since its construction, the only alteration to the structure occurred when three doorways were cut into the portico in 1938. The property is owned by the Lapeer County Historical Society and is open for tours during special events. It can also be rented.

Biography  Son of Angelo Cattaneo della Volta and Maria Cattaneo di Quilico, he was born in Genoa around 1487. His noble and needy figure is remembered in the historical records of the Genoese characters for having founded, in a period of maximum famine, the \\"Officio dei Poveri\\", made up of a magistrate together with eight Genoese citizens who, together with the parallel construction of numerous public barns, managed to coordinate and therefore provide support to about four thousand needy inhabitants. The first institutional position that Leonardo Cattaneo della Volta held was that of procurator of the Republic from 1533. In 1534, with the fresh appointment of governor, he was designated by the doge Battista Lomellini to guide the overseas territory of Corsica. Returning to Genoa in 1535 after his tenure as governor, a position he held for about two years, he was appointed governor of the Republic itself, it was at this stage that, during the stating of Cristoforo Grimaldi Rosso, he suggested the institution and participated in the office. According to various historical opinions, it was precisely his activism in managing the emergency of famine which, in fact, led him to the customs elections of 1541 as a personality designated to hold the highest office in the state. With 268 favorable votes, and among the acclamation of the Genoese people, Leonardo Cattaneo della Volta was elected on January 4, seventh doge of Genoa, with a two-year office, and fifty-second in republican history.  Dogate and later years  In his mandate he promoted the construction of the walls of the gates of the republic, works in the Grimaldina tower of the Doge's Palace and the Genoese port providing a cost of about 500 gold shields. However, he also had to deal with a new famine that afflicted Genoa and the rest of Italy in 1541. To find new agricultural resources, the Genoese state asked for help both from the Kingdom of Sicily and from the fields of Lombardy, but precisely the spread of the event in other Italian states, and therefore with similar situations of \\"food demand\\", they forced the doge to the Kingdom of France. The immediate French response in the supply of resources was followed by official thanks from Doge Cattaneo della Volta by the two ambassadors of the Republic to the King of France. At the end of his dogal biennium, in 1543, he returned to live in his sumptuous palace. In 1547 the famous \\"Congiura dei Fieschi \\" broke out against the power of the Republic and was commissioned by the doge Benedetto Gentile Pevere to manage the revolt together with Nicol√≤ de Franchi. Appointed general commissioner, he actively participated, with the help of the already doge Cristoforo Grimaldi Rosso, in the repression of the Fieschi at the barricaded castle of Montoggio in the upper Scrivia valley. In 1548, always together with Grimaldi Rosso, he participated in the reconstruction of the dock of the port of Savona. He died in Genoa in 1572 where he found burial in the Church of San Torpete.

Since its release it has become a significant entry in the burgeoning debate of video games as an art form. Rohrer himself has been an outspoken proponent of advancing the artistic integrity of the medium. In the game, the player spends five minutes experiencing a character's entire lifetime, with results that many commentators have described as emotionally powerful. Rohrer has described the title as a \\"memento mori\\" game. Gameplay In form, Passage most resembles a primitive side-scroller in which players control a male avatar that can move from left to right as time progresses. There are no instructions. The environment is a two-dimensional maze with treasure chests scattered throughout, some in relatively hard to reach places. Points are earned for collecting these chests. After a short time, the player will encounter a female character who will marry the protagonist if touched; this choice, however, will increase the difficulty of navigating the maze, as the female will begin to accompany the player and restrict certain avenues of movement. In the beginning of the game the player is positioned near the left side of the screen, thereby limiting his ability to see backward (the environment to the left of the player), with a long and narrow expanse of environment available to the right. As the game progresses, the avatar's relative position on the screen gradually shifts to the right, with less visibility to the right and more visibility to the left. The speed of the player also slows as time progresses, and the representation of both the avatar and the wife visibly age. The lack of any victory conditions coupled with the inevitability of death have led some to question whether Passage is in fact a game at all, or whether the word \\"game\\" is a sufficient label for it. Plot The game is devoid of a traditional plot, instead allowing the player's choices to author an abstract representation of a life. The protagonist may choose to maximize his life as a treasure hunter by remaining alone, or choose to marry for companionship, which will last until his wife's eventual death. Regardless of the choices the player makes, the fixed length of the game and the aging of the protagonist ensures death for the player character as well. Themes Passage was intended as an abstract metaphor for the human condition. Rohrer has stated that repeated playthroughs help emphasize the finite nature of the experience. Development Passage was made for Kokoromi's Gamma 256 event, a curated show at the 2007 Montreal International Games Summit. The size constraints for Gamma 256 led Rohrer to present the game in a blocky 100x16 pixel resolution. No entrants were allowed to exceed 256x256. Games were also limited to five minutes in length. Rohrer created all of the content, including the music, and the pixel art, which was made using the free software mtPaint. The final game was 2 megabytes large. The visual presentation of the main character is loosely based on Rohrer himself, with the female character modeled on his wife Lauren. Rohrer has stated that the themes of Passage were influenced by the death of an elderly neighbor, as well as his own changing life circumstances after starting a family of his own. In 2007 Rohrer released the game's source code and assets into the public domain,supportMyWork on hcsoftware.sourceforge.net \\"I release all of the source code that I write as free software (free as in \\"freedom\\") into the public domain so that others can learn from my work and make use of my source code in their own projects. I also release all of my software in compiled binary form (in other words, \\"ready-to-run\\") into the public domain, with no restrictions on use or redistribution.\\" (accessed 2016) while asking for voluntary donations (Donationware) and selling the game on the iOS appstore for $0.99.Passage on itunes.apple.com Exhibitions At the 2007 Montreal International Games Summit, Passage was one of eight submitted entrants that were screened at Kokoromi's Gamma 256 show, a competition that asked designers to create a game in 70 days that used as low a resolution and as unusual an aspect ratio as possible. In 2012, curator Paola Antonelli of New York's Museum of Modern Art selected Passage as one of the first 14 video games to be added to its permanent collection. In March 2013 the exhibition opened in the Philip Johnson Galleries.

Details View of the west, entrance, side The lands around Newton St. Loe (Newton Seyntloo) were inherited through marriage from the de Paveley's, a Norman knight from Westbury, Wiltshire. John de Paveley died without an heir, so his lands passed through marriage to John de Sancto Laudo, another family of knight who gained recognition for his actions at Acre during the Crusades. Newton St Loe Castle was originally built as a fortified manor house, probably in the 12th century, surrounded by Newton Park, then a medieval deer park. During its time the castle was known as St. John's keep, for apparently holding King John under arrest by William de Sancto Laudo. St Loes Castle , National Monuments Record, English Heritage, accessed 16 July 2011; Dunning, pp.61-2. At the start of the 14th century, a keep was built on the site as part of a wider programme of work by the St Loe family, creating a rectangular, courtyard castle with four corner towers, protected by a ditch on three sides.Pettifer, p.222; Youngs and Clark, p.200; Castle Keep in the Grounds of Newton Park, Images of England, accessed 16 July 2011. In 1375 the site was inherited by Elizabeth, the last of the St Loe family, who married William, Baron Botreaux.Dunning, pp.61-2. Sir Walter Hungerford built a new gatehouse at the castle during the first half of the 15th century, which features turrets, machicolations and an early gunport.Pettifer, p.222; Kenyon, p.83. In the 19th century the castle and the surrounding park were heavily landscaped to produce the current country house and gardens; only the renovated keep and the gatehouse survive intact, although a nearby mound marks one of the corner towers of the 14th-century castle.St Loes Castle , National Monuments Record, English Heritage, accessed 16 July 2011. Today the site is leased by Bath Spa University and both the keep and the gatehouse are scheduled monuments, holding a Grade 1 listed building status.Newton St Loe, Gatehouse webpage, accessed 16 July 2011.

Samuel achieved many breakthroughs for Jews in the colonial community of New South Wales including the first Jew to become a magistrate, the first Jew elected to parliament, the first Jew to become a minister of the Crown. Early years and background Samuel was born in London, England on 2 November 1820, the posthumous son of Sampson Samuel and his wife Lydia, n√©e Lyons. Samuel arrived in Australia on 25 August 1832 aboard The Brothers with his mother to meet with Samuel's brother, Lewis, and their uncle, Samuel Lyons, was had arrived in colonial New South Wales a few years earlier. Educated at schools run by W. T Cape, Samuel was initially employed at his uncles' accounting house, before he and his brother formed their own mercantile firm. After purchasing of land at Bathurst, he abandoned pastoral interests following the 1851 gold rush and business interests became his main focus. He married Henrietta Matilda Goldsmith-Levien on 16 December 1857 and had two daughters and two sons. He married Sarah Louisa Isaacs on 31 October 1877 (in Auckland, New Zealand) and had one son.

Elected to the first responsible government, Samuel became a member of the Legislative Assembly representing the Counties of Roxburgh and Wellington from 1854 until 1856. Re-elected to the Assembly in June 1859 and then again in November 1859, Samuel served as member for Orange until 1860.

Samuel resigned as Treasurer in the Cowper ministry after his budget proposals for trade licences and increased duties on tea and sugar had been defeated. In 1870, at the Intercolonial Conference in Melbourne, Samuel proposed intercolonial free trade to settle the border customs dispute. He hoped to abolish ad valorem duties but his plans for a tax on incomes of over ¬£200 were bitterly contested and led to the downfall of the government in December 1870. Between 1872 and 1880, Samuel served as Postmaster-General on three occasions under Premier, Henry Parkes, including the first (1872‚Äì1875), second (1877), and third (1878‚Äì1883) ministries.

Municipally, it is the administrative center of Severoonezhskoye Urban Settlement, one of the eight urban settlements in the district. Population: . Geography Severoonezhsk is located on the left bank of the Onega River, several kilometers downstream from the mouth of the Iksa River, the left tributary of the Onega. On the right bank of the Onega, across Severoonezhsk, stands the urban-type settlement of Oksovsky. History The first house in Severoonezhsk was built in February 1973 shortly after huge deposits of bauxite were discovered. Until 1985, Severoonezhsk was subordinate to the urban-type settlement of Oksovsky. On July 8, 1985, Severoonezhsk was granted urban-type settlement status itself, and was split from Oksovsky; with its territory including the whole area on the left bank of the Onega which had been part of Oksovsky. At the beginning of 1970, there were plans to build an aluminum production plant close to the bauxite deposits. It was planned that the plant would be served by a city with the population of approximately 100,000, with the name of Severorossiysk, located on both banks of the Onega. The plans were supported by Hungary and Bulgaria, who were interested in becoming the shareholders. The plans have never been realized. Economy Industry Bauxite extraction is the main industry in Severoonezhsk. The bauxites were discovered in the area in 1949, and the extraction (the North Onezhsky mine) began in 1978. Transportation Oksovsky (Navoloki railway station) is at the end of the railway line which connects in Puksa to the line between Moscow and Arkhangelsk (Konosha-Obozyorskaya stretch). There is a railway bridge from Severoonezhsk (Iksa railway station) to Oksovsky across the Onega, connecting to the railway to the west of Severoonezhsk, to Undozero and Yangory. This line (Zaonezhskaya Railroad) is one of the biggest railways in Russia which does not belong to Russian Railways. The owner of the railway is the State Department of Corrections. Plans to extend this line to Medvezhyegorsk have not been realized. There is a road connecting Severoonezhsk to Oksovsky and further on to the highway which is a historic trading route between Kargopol with Arkhangelsk. The Onega is not navigable at Severoonezhsk because of the rapids. Culture and recreation The weekly newspaper of Plesetsky District, Kuryer Prionezhya (), has been published since 1999.

Biography Ducat of Paolo di Campofregoso, coined between 1483 and 1488. The son of doge Battista I Campofregoso, he was convinced by Pope Nicholas V to study ecclesiastical matters at Pavia. In 1448, once finished with his studies, he was appointed canon of the cathedral of Savona, and in 1453 he became abbot of the Cistercian convent of Sant'Andrea at Savona. The same year, aged only 26, he was appointed archbishop of Genoa by request of his brother Pietro, the current doge. Pietro had become doge for the first time in 1450, succeeding his cousin Lodovico, who had resigned for unknown reasons. His rule ended in 1458 when the city surrendered itself to King Charles VII of France. Further strife with his cousin caused Lodovico to cede the title of doge to Paolo on 14 May 1462. His rule ended after just fifteen days, as he was replaced by five captains. The latter, in turn, lasted for only a week, after which Lodovico di Campofregoso was restored as doge: now the hate between Paolo, the city's archbishop, and Lodovico, the city's political chief, reached its apex. Paolo succeeded him as doge in January 1463 and had Lodovico detained in the castle of Castelletto. The following year, after a series of questionable deeds (such as menacing the expulsion of the Adorno family from Genoa, and the endless strife within the Fregoso family), the Council of the Elders deposed him, accepting the protection of the House of Sforza, which lasted until 1477.  Life as cardinal  In 1480 he was created cardinal in Rome. In that year he participated as papal admiral for an expedition alongside the Neapolitan fleet of Ferdinand I against the Turks at Otranto. In 1483 Paolo di Campofregoso was elected as doge of Genoa for the third time; however, this time a popular rebellion forced him to flee his city in 1488, being succeeded by another submission to the Sforzas. He subsequently lived in exile in Piedmont, Veneto and Rome. In 1490 he received the cardinal title of San Sisto, and took part in the conclave of 1492.  Later years  In 1495 he resigned from archbishopric of Genoa, but the following year he was appointed to that post again. In his late life he participated in the struggle to expel Charles VIII of France from Genoa.

Career  Ramesh Prasad Kharel has served as the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in Pokhara, Kathmandu, and Birgunj. His transfer from Kathmandu was a controversial decision, and was likely delayed due to public support for his stay in Kathmandu. During his stint in Kathmandu, he cracked down on crime in the city, including controlling the gangs and the so-called \\"dons\\" of Kathmandu. He also presided over raids on dance clubs that were illegally working as brothels in Kathmandu. He had similarly cracked down on illegal prostitution during his earlier stint in Pokhara. Stint in Birgunj, Parsa While in Birgunj in Parsa District, he continued his strong policing he was known for. Within the first 10 days of his transfer, it was reported that crime was down and the rife corruption within the police force had decreased significantly. The practice of collecting illegal tolls from those importing goods from India was also significantly cut. Kharel became one of the few police officers in Nepal to take on political criminality. Despite tremendous pressure from his superiors he registered a murder charge against Prabhu Shah, a minister of land reforms in the then government. Despite his efforts, the District attorney's office in Parsa refused to register murder charges against Shah. In April 2012, he was SSP. Second Term in Kathmandu In January 2014, Kharel was recalled to oversee the operations of the Kathmandu Metropolitan Police. Soon after he took office, he made the police officers under him take oath of honesty and hard work. He arrested Tejendra Gurung, a notorious gangster, on his second day in office.http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news;_id=69132 He has also started cracking down on massage parlors, dance bars and cabin restaurants suspected of running prostitution and strip shows,http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news;_id=68875 something he was well known for in his previous term in Kathmandu.  Contributions  In a police force known for widespread corruption, Ramesh Parsad Kharel has been seen as the hallmark of integrity and principled service. He has received support from both the press and citizens for his activities as a principled cop, and for cracking down on corruption in Kathmandu. He gained his reputation not only from large-scale crime reduction, but also from small incidents like jailing the son-in-law of the ex-King, and firing corrupt subordinates without fear of authority. DIG Ramesh Kharel is the great inspiration for the youngsters or the newly recruited government officials or police man in the NPS(Nepal Police Service) or NAS (Nepal Administrative Service).

Biography The son of Bartolomeo di Campofregoso and Caterina Ordelaffi, he was the brother of Giano I di Campofregoso. He studied under humanist Bartolomeo Ivani, who later was also educator of his sons. His first military command took place in 1437 when his uncle, doge Tommaso di Campofregoso, sent him to fight the Del Carretto marquisses in the Riviera di Ponente and the lower Piedmont. Later appointed as captain of the Republic of Genoa, he was charged with the suppression of the Hussites and Waldensians. In 1447, when Giano was elected doge, he held diplomatic positions in the court of Alfonso V of Aragon at Naples and in Rome. Here, Pope Nicholas V (also of Ligurian origins) appointed him as Lord of Corsica after the island had been completely subjugated to Genoa with the papal approval. Nicholas also gave him the lordship of Cyprus, where Lodovico sojourned for a period. In 1448 he returned to Genoa to assist his ill brother. At the latter's death, on 16 December, Lodovico was elected as doge. During his first rule, he ended the conflict with the Marquisate of Finale. In September 1450, he abdicated in favor of his cousin Pietro di Campofregoso, and moved to the fortress of Sarzanello near Sarzana. In July 1461, he succeeded his cousin Spinetta di Campofregoso as doge, and received the fortress of Castelletto. However, contrasts with his cousin Paolo (now archbishop of Genoa) caused him to renounce to the crown of doge on 14 May 1462, being succeeded by Paolo the same day. On 8 June of that year he was again doge in place of Paolo, but the endless strife led to his second abdication, after which Paolo had him arrested at Castelletto, which he was also forced to surrender to his cousin. In 1468 he ceded Sarzana to the Republic of Florence, causing, in the following years, numerous struggles between the Florentine and the Genoese for its possession. Having become an admiral of Ferdinand II of Aragon, in 1478 he returned to Genoa at the head of a fleet of seven galleys to help free the city from Gian Galeazzo Sforza's domination. He spent the last years of his life as a refugee in Nice, where he died in 1489.

It aims to virtualize Windows applications so that they can run on other machines or in HTML5 browsers. It is reported to be easy to use, light in weight, and compatible with a wide variety of applications. The company‚Äôs web site includes a library of ready- to-use virtualized free and open-source virtual applications which can be downloaded or run in the browser. Cameyo has a free edition for home and small businesses for up to 49 machines. History The Cameyo application virtualization product was launched in 2010, and since then, has undergone at least two major and several minor versions yearly to improve the quality and functioning of the application. Cameyo claims to be one of the pioneers in linking app virtualization with cloud storage systems and HTML5. It has added new features recently, such as making it possible to run the applications on operating systems other than Windows, like Linux and Android. Since 2014, Cameyo has launched another angle to its operation: now it is possible to run virtualized Windows applications through the web browsers directly, with each application running in a new tab. Operations Once Cameyo has packaged an application, its output is a standalone EXE that contains the virtualization engine and the original software‚Äôs files and registry. It can then be directly run on target Windows machines. Since it is self-contained, it does not require an agent to be pre-installed on target machines. It can also be uploaded to a Cameyo server, making it possible to run virtual applications through a browser. Virtualizing applications Cameyo itself is a portable virtual application that does not need to be installed on the computer. It can be deleted once the virtualization is completed as a single file without leaving any traces in the registry. Cameyo essentially reduces all the files, folders, registry items, and binaries of the application that needs to be virtualized into a single executable file that can run without installation as a single file from any storage device on any computer. This single executable file can be carried in a USB device or be uploaded in a cloud storage system. This operation can be carried out either by downloading Cameyo on the computer, or through their online system by uploading the system file of the required application. However, it is advisable to download Cameyo on the computer as it provides for a better sequencing process. The following are the highlights of the procedure: 1) The application to be virtualized needs to be installed after opening Cameyo. If it is previously installed, it will have to be uninstalled and reinstalled once Cameyo is in capture mode. 2) Cameyo takes snapshots of the computer before and after the installation of the desired application, compares the changes in the two snapshots, and hence, captures the application as it makes changes to the registry and system files. 3) Both steps for taking snapshots requires some time, depending upon the speed of the computer, the size of the application, and the state of the registry of the computer 4) Cameyo makes it possible to virtualize multiple applications at the same time into one executable file 5) Close any background applications, and updating of windows and anti-virus programs, so that no extra material is captured by Cameyo, thus making the application bulky 6) Once the application is virtualized, it will be saved in the defined destination folder from where it can be accessed, opened, or copied in a portable storage device for use on other computers There is also an option in Cameyo for editing virtualized applications in case any changes need to be made regarding the settings, name, or registry items of the application. Running applications through browsers Cameyo has recently made it possible to run virtualized applications directly through web browsers, hence, claiming to make software discovery and usage easier. Through this operation, there is no longer need to even carry the application, as it can be directly accessed from the website of the company. The company provides a large variety of open access free software and applications which are pre-virtualized for direct use. However, personal applications from the computer or the cloud storage device can also be uploaded onto the company server and accessed through the browser. Each application runs in a separate tab. As with virtualizing applications, browser applications now can also run on operating systems other than Windows. To use this function, create a free account with the company, and link the Dropbox or other cloud storage system with the account in order to access personal files from applications running in the browser. Cost Cameyo has a free version available for download through the company website and other software websites. It does not need to be installed as it is a portable virtualized application itself. The company offers free basic version for home use and small businesses, and various commercial offerings for other types of usage.

King of Kongo, ruled from 1695 to 1718, although his effective reign of Kongo was only from 1709. He is noted for restoring the country and ending the civil war which had raged since 1666. It was during his reign that Beatriz Kimpa Vita, the prophetess claimed to be possessed by Saint Anthony had her career. Early life Very little is known of Pedro's early life, although he was the founder of the House of √Ågua Rosada which was a lineage founded from the two rival lineages of the late 17th century, the Kimpanzu and the Kinlaza. He began his career among royal refugees who had taken shelter in the mountain of Kibangu, in the Serra do Canda of modern day Angola. He claimed the throne upon the death of his brother, but as he was not crowned in S√£o Salvador, he was not considered fully legitimate. Reign He was also a partner in several attempts to organize a peaceful settlement to the succession crisis in Kongo brokered by the old Queen Ana Afonso de Le√£o with the special cooperation of the Capuchin missionary Francesco da Pavia. The concerts did not result in success however as bad blood remained among all the contenders. Popular discontent with the king rose in the early eighteenth century as many felt he had not done enough to restore the kingdom by reoccupying the capital, and to this end Pedro led an armed column from Kibangu to S√£o Salvador in 1694 and was crowned there by a priest. But he was threatened immediately by his principal rival, Jo√£o II of Lemba, who also claimed to be king, and withdrew immediately. He would remain in the mountain for many more years. After 1700, Pedro sought to reoccupy the ancient capital by sending out groups of colonists, one set led by Manuel Cruz Barbosa, his majordomo, and the other by Pedro Constaninho da Silva (known also as Kibenga), a one time rival who had temporarily joined forces with him. Pedro himself moved down from Kibangu to a smaller mountain, Evululu, nearer to the capital. The Antonian Movement There were millennial stirrings among the colonists that had been sent out to resettle the capital. Several prophets emerged, but the final prophet, Beatriz Kimpa Vita, began immensely popular. Claiming to be possessed by Saint Anthony, Beatriz confronted Pedro on his lack of resolution, and he for his part wanted to arrest her as a heretic, as indeed the Capuchin priest in his service, Bernardo da Gallo recommended. However, he did not, and Beatriz left his capital, and eventually began resettling S√£o Salvador herself. In the process she gained the adherence of Pedro Constantinho da Silva, thus setting up a crisis between Pedro IV and his one time subordinate. Pedro IV captured Beatriz near his capital at Evululu, and in July 1706 had her executed. In 1709 in turn, he occupied S√£o Salvador, defeating the final partisans of Pedro Constantinho da Silva. The same year, he won a signal victory of Jo√£o II, thus securing himself the position as king. According to later accounts, before his death in 1718, Pedro declared that the kingship in Kongo should rotate between the rival lineages.

Today it covers an area of making it the largest science park in Germany.Der Spiegel. Hamburg 2008,02 (7.1.), S. 38,  History  The existence of technology centers at Adlershof dates back well into the late 19th and early 20th centuries - the Berlin‚ÄìG√∂rlitz railway had reached the Berlin suburb of Adlershof in 1867 and the population increased from 743 in 1875 to 5591 in 1895 following the industrialization in the area. The decision to build the Teltow Canal (1900 - 1906) furthered the development of businesses in the area between the old town (in the north) and the canal (in the south). In 1909 the Johannisthal Air Field opened in the west of the area and a number of institutions settled in Adlershof, including the German Research Institute for Aviation (today German Aerospace Center). During the wars the area was used as a technology development center for aviation and radio telecommunications - for some time the large 36 meter radio telescope was an icon of the area. After the total destruction of Berlin 1945 the new Eastern Government decided to move the German Academy of Sciences to Adlershof. In 1950 to 1952 the media centers of the Deutscher Fernsehfunk television broadcaster were built in Adlershof. The aviation field was closed down (as air transport had been moved to Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld Airport a few miles away) and the guards regiment Feliks Dzierzynski (12,000 soldiers) occupied the military buildings. After the German reunification almost all institutions at Adlershof were closed down during 1990/1991. The infrastructure was old and not up to date with the technology level of West Germany however the available area had the best premises to build a modern one. Berlin did found the Redevelopment Company Adlershof Ltd (Entwicklungsgesellschaft Adlershof mbH - EGA) in 1991 and it was renamed to WISTA Management Ltd (WISTA-Management GmbH) in 1994 as the plans for a new science and technology park took shape. Since then, it helps developing the cluster partly like a business incubator, with network management, communication and marketing, acceleration of special fields of technology and acquisition of projects, investments and companies. The name WISTA is not officially explained as an abbreviation although at the time the full name was \\"WISTA - Wissenschafts- und Wirtschaftsstandort Adlershof\\" (WISTA - Science and Business Location Adlershof) so that WI-ST-A points to a previous project name \\"WIssenschaftsSTandort Adlershof\\" (Science Location Adlershof) while much of the press refers to the area as \\"Wissenschaftsstadt Adlershof\\" (Science City Adlershof) leading to the same abbreviation. In fact WISTA was included in the Expo 2000 fairs under the name of \\"Berlin Adlershof ‚Äì Stadt f√ºr Wissenschaft, Wirtschaft und Medien\\" (Berlin Adlershof - City of Science, Business and Media) corroborating the correspondence. Since its founding, more then 1,200 companies and scientific institutions setteled down in the Science City Adlershof. Between 1998 and 2003 the gradual relocation of the Humboldt University's scientific departments realized from downtown Berlin to Adlershof, the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences with the Institutes of Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics and the Institute of Geography as well as the Institute of Psychology of the Faculty of Life Sciences domiciled on the Adlershof campus. At the end of 2007 the redevelopment legislation for Adlershof were lifted. In 2008 the area advanced to the north-west building the Hermann D√∂rner Avenue (Hermann-D√∂rner-Allee). In 2011 the tram line was extended to run right through the science and technology park. Today the BESSY synchrotron is something of an icon for the area. There is still room for extension of the science park using the industrial area along the earlier airfield in the west and the earlier shunting station in the north. Developments plans for a housing project west of the earlier airfield (today a grassland recreational area) have been scrapped with new homes being single and duplex houses.  Numbers  The Berlin Adlershof Science City is one of the most successful high-technology sites in Germany and Berlin‚Äôs largest media site. It is home to 1,203 companies and scientific institutions (Dec 2019) on an area of 4.2 km¬≤ ‚Äì embedded in an integrated urban planning concept. 23,500 people work and 6,458 study here. The companies and non- university research institutes in the Adlershof Science and Technology Park at the heart of the Adlershof Science City focus on: * Photonics and Optics, * Renewable Energies and Photovoltaics, * Microsystems and Materials, * IT and Media, * Biotechnology and Environment. Moreover, there are six scientific institutes of the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin (Chemistry, Geography, Computer Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology). In the direct vicinity, an ensemble of meanwhile 454 commercial enterprises, shops, hotels and restaurants has been created in addition to the Media City with its 189 companies. Here, as well as on the approximately 45 hectare area of the Sch√∂neweide marshalling yard (\\"Gleislinse\\"), which was closed in 1998, the Science and Technology Park has ideal space for further growth. Adlershof is not just a place of work. Single-family homes, rented and owner-occupied apartments, townhouses and student apartments have been built. In 2019, around 4,000 people were already living in the Adlershof development area. Further residential developments are currently in construction. * 6 departments of the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin (Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, Geography) with 6,458 students and 980 personal * 1,851 employees work at 8 Non-university research institutions * 548 science companies with 7,945 employees in the science and technology park * 189 media companies with 2,960 employees in the television and media park * 454 support companies with 9,764 employees  See also  * German Silicon Valley  References   External links  * Berlin-Adlershof ‚Äì Science and Technology Park * Initiativgemeinschaft Au√üeruniversit√§rer Forschungseinrichtungen in Adlershof e.V.

Armament consisted of either a 4-in or a 4.7-inch gun, and six machine guns. Empire Duke departed from Sunderland on 2 December for the Tyne, arriving that day. She departed from the Tyne on 18 December to join Convoy FN 1208, which had departed from Southend, Essex the previous day and arrived at Methil, Fife on 19 December. She then joined Convoy EN 322, which departed on 21 December and arrived at Loch Ewe on 23 December. Empire Duke sailed on to Oban, Argyllshire, arriving the next day. Laden with a cargo of coal, she departed on 26 December to join Convoy OS 63/KMS 37G, which departed from Liverpool, Lancashire on 25 December and split at sea on 7 January 1944. Convoy OS 63 arrived at Freetown, Sierra Leone on 17 January. Empire Duke was in the part of the convoy that formed Convoy KMS 37G, which arrived at Gibraltar on 7 January. She then joined Convoy KMS 37, which departed on 9 January and arrived at Port Said, Egypt on 20 January. Empire Duke left the convoy at Oran, Algeria, where she arrived on 10 January. She departed on 25 January to join Convoy GUS 28, which had departed from Port Said on 15 January and arrived at the Hampton Roads, Virginia, United States on 15 February. She left the convoy at Casablanca, Morocco, She departed on 1 February, joining Convoy SL 147, which had departed from Freetown on 22 January and rendezvoused at sea with Convoy MKS 38 on 2 February. The combined convoys arrived at Liverpool on 13 February. Empire Duke sailed on to Loch Ewe, arriving on 12 February and joining Convoy WN 544, which arrived at Methil on 14 February. Empire Duke was a member of Convoy EN 350, which departed from Methil on 24 February and arrived at Loch Ewe two days later. She left the convoy at Aberdeen on 25 February.

Laden with a cargo of grain, she departed on 7 April to join Convoy HX 286, which had departed from New York on 5 April and arrived at Liverpool on 20 April. She was bound for Manchester, Lancashire. Empire Dukes movements are not recorded for over eight weeks. It may have been during this period that she was on loan to the Cambridge University Engineering Department for tests to be undertaken in connection with research into problems affecting various Liberty Ships (see below). She departed from Southend on 12 June as a member of Convoy ETM 7, which arrived at the Seine Bay, France the next day. She spent the next three months shuttling between those two place in various ETM and FTM convoys, arriving at Southend on 12 September as a member of Convoy FTM 2A.

She spent the next four months sailing between Southend and Antwerp, Belgium with various TAM and ATM convoys, arriving at Southend on 28 March 1945 as a member of Convoy ATM 106. Empire Duke was a member of Convoy TBC 117, which departed from Southend on 3 April and arrived at Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire on 6 April. She then sailed to the Clyde, where she arrived two days later. She departed on 22 April to join Convoy ON 298, which had departed from Southend on 21 April and arrived at New York on 7 May. Her destination was Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She arrived at Father Point, Quebec on 6 May. Solving the Liberty ship problem Early Liberty ships suffered problems with brittle fractures, leading to some of them breaking in two without warning. Following the loss of off the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, United States in 1943, research was carried out by Cambridge University Engineering Department in the United Kingdom into the causes of these losses. Empire Duke was lent for the purpose of testing of the steel used to build ships in the United Kingdom. Constance Tipper proved that low temperatures sustained by Liberty ships in the North Atlantic were leading to brittle fractures. Further research into the plasticity of steel led to the development of specialist steels that are used in artificial human and animal joints. The Victory ship was developed, which was stronger and faster than the Liberty ship. Post-war In June‚ÄìJuly 1945 Empire Duke sailed from Montreal to The Downs, off the coast of Kent and then back to Montreal. She then sailed from Montreal on 11 August, arriving in Casablanca on 24 August and then sailed to Avonmouth, Somerset, where she arrived on 8 September. As a member of Convoy TAM 32, she departed Southend on 28 December and arrived at Antwerp the next day. In May 1946, Empire Duke was transferred to the French Government and renamed Lieutenant J Le Meur, after Julien Le Meur, an officer who had served on , and had been killed in Provence on 28 August 1944, whilst serving as a pilot with the Marine Nationale when his aircraft crashed. She was operated by the Compagnie G√©n√©rale Transatlantique. Lieutenant J Le Meur loaded a cargo of ammonium nitrate at the Port of Texas City, Texas, United States between 8 and 10 April 1947, a week before the exploded in the Texas City Disaster, which killed 581 and injured 3,500 people. In 1949, Lieutenant J Le Meur was sold to the Compagnie Franco Ch√©rifienne de Navigation', Casablanca, Morocco and was renamed Zelidja. In 1955, she was sold to Compagnia de Navigazione Hellespont SA, Monrovia, Liberia and was renamed Propontis, after the Sea of Marmara. She was placed under the management of A M Embiricos, Monaco. In 1957, Propontis was sold to Compagnie de Navigazione Propontis Liberia SA, Monrovia. She was not renamed and remained under the management of Embiricos. Propontis served until 1966, arriving on 24 May at Kaohsiung, Taiwan for scrapping. Notes A Sources give the year as 1945. A month of May is given by one source, but Empire Duke was (another states) still in service under that name in December 1945.

It consisted of 13 episodes, bringing the series total to 39. Damages was created by brothers Todd and Glenn Kessler, along with Daniel Zelman, each of whom served as executive producer and contributed four scripts for the season, including the premiere and the finale. The season picks up one year after the events of season two. Louis Tobin, patriarch of the famously wealthy Tobin family, has just confessed to orchestrating the largest Ponzi scheme in Wall Street history; the U.S. Government has assigned Patty Hewes and Tom Shayes to find the Tobins' hidden money, and uncover any evidence that other Tobin family members (namely Louis' eldest child Joe and long-time attorney Leonard Winstone) had prior knowledge of the fraud. Ellen Parsons has taken a job at the District Attorney's office but, as the story unfolds, she finds herself being pulled further and further back into Patty's orbit. Tom, meanwhile, learns that he unwittingly invested with Louis Tobin and has lost 70% of his net worth and both his parents' and in-laws' savings. He struggles to keep his personal issues from interfering with the case and with keeping this secret from Patty. Though the season earned mostly positive reviews from television critics, it continued to struggle in the ratings; soon after the season finale, FX announced it had canceled Damages due to low ratings. However, the series was eventually picked up by DirecTV for two additional seasons, which began airing the fourth season on July 13, 2011.  Cast and characters   Main cast  * Glenn Close as Patty Hewes (13 episodes) * Rose Byrne as Ellen Parsons (13 episodes) * Tate Donovan as Thomas Shayes (13 episodes) * Campbell Scott as Joe Tobin (12 episodes) * Martin Short as Leonard Winstone (13 episodes) * Ted Danson as Arthur Frobisher (4 episodes)  Recurring cast   Episodes   Production  After Damages had finished airing its first season in October 2007, FX renewed the series for two additional 13-episode seasons. Production on both seasons was delayed due to the Writer's Guild Strike, which delayed the season two premiere until the beginning of 2009, and season three was consequently delayed until January 2010. As with the previous two seasons, season three of Damages was executive produced by series creators Todd A. Kessler, Glenn Kessler, and Daniel Zelman. Mark A. Baker and Aaron Zelman served as co-executive producers with Mark Fish serving as co-producer. Aaron Zelman and Mark Fish each wrote one episode and co-wrote the sixth episode. Jeremy Doner and Adam Stein also wrote one episode each. The season's main directors were Matthew Penn (three episodes), Todd A. Kessler (two episodes), and Timothy Busfield (two episodes). Co-creators Daniel Zelman and Glenn Kessler each made his directorial debut with episode five and episode seven, respectively, as did series director of photography David Tuttman with episode ten. The remaining three episodes were directed by Tony Goldwyn, Chris Terrio, and series star Tate Donovan.  Reception   Awards and nominations The third season received five nominations for the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards: Glenn Close for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Rose Byrne for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, Martin Short for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, Ted Danson for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series, and Lily Tomlin for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.  Critical reviews  The third season of Damages was met with mostly high praise, and it earned 81 out of 100 based on 16 reviews on the aggregate review website Metacritic. This qualifies as \\"universal acclaim\\". Rotten Tomatoes gave the third season a 100% rating based on 12 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.9 out of 10. Rotten Tomatoes' critical consensus reads: \\"This season of Damages grows even more masterful with dazzling performances all around, first-rate writing and savory storylines.\\"  Ratings  Despite positive critical reviews, Damages continued to struggle in the ratings. The premiere episode garnered 1.43 million viewers and a 0.3 ratings share with adults 18‚Äì49. This is down from the 1.72 million households that viewed the second-season premiere. Season three reached a ratings low point upon airing its tenth episode, \\"Tell Me I'm Not Racist,\\" which attracted only 650,000 viewers and a 0.2 ratings share with adults 18‚Äì49. Though the ratings went into a slight incline for the remainder of the season, the finale was watched by only 910,000 households compared to the 1.05 million viewers who tuned in for the second-season finale.

It was established by the Consultation of the Republic of Texas on November 25, 1835. Along with the Texian Army, it helped the Republic of Texas win independence from the Centralist Republic of Mexico on May 14, 1836 at the Treaties of Velasco. It was replaced by the Texas Navy on March 23, 1839. History 1835 During the naval campaign of the Texas Revolution, the Texans had three objectives. The first was to defend their coastline from a sea-borne Mexican invasion, and the second was to escort rebel ships back and forth between Texas and the United States, from where the main source of volunteer soldiers and supplies was coming. The third objective was to inflict serious casualties on the Mexicans in the hopes of forcing them to recognize the independence of Texas. Mexican naval forces had the mission of trying to blockade the long Texas coastline, which was impossible for the few ships stationed in the region. Due to the shortage of ships, Mexico's blockade remained largely ineffective throughout the hostilities. This allowed the Texans to import much of their war material by sea. The Texas Navy in 1835 was nonexistent; the only rebel naval forces were six privateers authorized by the rebel government at the end of the year. However, in the first naval battle of the war involving Texas, rebels boarded the American-owned ship San Felipe and the steamer Laura on September 1, 1835, and then proceeded to attack the Mexican treasury vessel Correo de Mexico off Brazoria, which was taken as a prize to New Orleans.http://www.texasmilitaryforcesmuseum.org/articles/texasnavy/texasnavy.htm Other than the commissioning of privateers, the Texan government agreed to authorize the purchase of four schooners on November 24, 1835, for use in defending territorial waters. The first of the ships acquired was the former revenue service ship USRC Ingham, a small six-gun ship of 112 tons which was renamed Independence. The Independence became the flagship of the First Texas Navy and was placed under the command of Captain Charles E. Hawkins; she fought a battle with Mexican naval forces on June 14, 1835, off Brazos Santiago. The second schooner was Brutus; she was nearly twice as large as the Independence and was placed under Captain William A. Hurd, the former commander of the privateer William Robbins, which was also acquired for duty in the regular navy. The William Robbins was renamed Liberty and was commanded by Captain William S. Brown, whose brother, Captain Jeremiah Brown, commanded the fourth schooner, named Invincible. The next engagement after the Correo de Mexico affair occurred on December 19, 1835, when the William Robbins liberated the American merchant ship Hannah Elizabeth, which had been captured by the Mexicans for carrying two cannons, allegedly intended for the rebels.http://www.texasmilitaryforcesmuseum.org/articles/texasnavy/texasnavy.htm 1836 As a result of the taking of Correo de Mejico and the Hannah Elizabeth, the Mexican Navy responded by escorting their merchantmen. The schooners Bravo and Vera Cruzana were two of the vessels known to have been involved in escort duty. Meanwhile, the Independence was dispatched on a solo cruise of the Mexican Gulf for the first three months of 1836. She was successful in capturing multiple small fishing vessels and disrupted communications between Mexico and General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna's army in Texas. On March 3, Captain William S. Brown in the Liberty was sailing to the Yucatan when he encountered the armed Mexican merchantman Pelican. In the ensuing battle, the Texans captured the enemy ship while under fire from the fortress at Sisal. The Pelican was then sent as a prize to Matagorda but she ran aground on a sandbar off the port and was wrecked. Over 300 kegs of gunpowder and other military supplies were found on board the ship and it eventually was utilized by General Houston's army. Liberty captured the American brig Durango shortly thereafter and it too was found to be carrying Mexican Army supplies. Around the same time, Captain Jeremiah Brown in the Invincible took the American brig Pocket at the mouth of the Rio Grande; she was carrying contraband as well but her owners informed the United States Navy.http://howdyyall.com/Texas/TodaysNews/index.cfm?GetItem=1087 Subsequently, the American Commodore Alexander J. Dallas arrested Captain Brown and his crew for piracy when they sailed into New Orleans that May for provisioning. The charges were eventually dropped because all of the seized American ships carried Mexican military stores, but a civil suit remained in litigation for years afterward. Texan authorities took the time to purchase the Pocket and both the ship and her cargo were used against the Mexicans. On April 3, the Invincible attacked the Mexican ship Montezuma off Matamoros. Captain Brown ordered his men to open fire while the schooner maneuvered in circles around the Montezuma until she ran aground and sank. On April 11, the privateer Flash picked up the refugees and survivors of the Runaway Scrape at Morgan's Point, including members of President David G. Burnet's family. The next significant event of the conflict, which had an effect on the naval campaign, was the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836. In it, General Houston led an attack on the Mexican Army and routed them, in the process capturing General Santa Anna, who was then forced to sign a treaty recognizing the independence of Texas. The fighting on land was over at that point but because the Mexican government never ratified the Treaty of Velasco, the naval campaign continued for another year.http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/navy/war.html After San Jacinto, the Invincible was used to deliver the news of victory to President Burnet and the Liberty escorted the ship Flora to New Orleans. The Flora was an unarmed vessel carrying the wounded General Houston who needed better medical attention than what he could receive in Texas. During the stay in New Orleans, the American navy seized the Liberty on May 22 and sold her as compensation for unpaid bills. On June 3, twenty Texas Rangers under Major Isaac Burton joined in the naval operations when they boarded and took over three American ships near Corpus Christi. All three were carrying war materials and they were condemned by the admiralty court in Velasco.http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/navy/sanjac.html 1837 The United States Navy's response to this incident was sending the sloop USS Natchez. On April 16, 1837, the Natchez was involved in a combat incident with Mexican ships off the Rio Grande. In the battle, the Americans captured the Mexican brig General Urrea and liberated the merchantman Climax, all while under cannon fire from the two brigs General Teran and General Bravo, as well as a Mexican fort. The American commander, Captain William Mervine, was later found to have exceeded his authority in taking a Mexican warship, so he was forced to apologize to the Mexicans and release the General Urrea. While the Independence and the Liberty were conducting their missions, the other three Texan warships, Invincible, Brutus, and Pocket, were directed to blockade Matamoros until September, when they sailed for New Orleans and New York City for repairs. These three ships remained in American waters for the rest of the year and finally returned to the war zone in the spring of 1837, by which time the Mexican Navy had sent three brigs and two schooners to blockade Galveston. On April 17, the Independence engaged the Mexican brigs Vencedor del Alamo and Libertador while she was entering the Brazos River. Captain George W. Wheelwright knew he was outgunned so he fled up the river; the Mexicans followed for five hours before finally forcing the Texans to surrender in front of Velasco, Texas, and Secretary of the Navy Samuel Rhoads Fisher.http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/exhibits/navy/sanjac.html The final naval battle of the war was fought on August 26, 1837, just as the Invincible and the Brutus were returning to Galveston after a successful cruise in which five Mexican vessels were captured along with the British brig Eliza Russell. The Vencedor del Alamo and Libertador chased the Invincible for a short time before she ran aground and was abandoned and the Brutus was wrecked and sank. Thus the last two rebel ships were destroyed and it wasn't until 1839 that the Texans would have a navy again.http://www.texasnavy.com/day_in_history.htm See also * Texas Military Forces * Texas Military Department * List of conflicts involving the Texas Military * Awards and decorations of the Texas Military References Category:Naval operations and battles Category:History of Mexico Category:History of the United States Navy Category:Texas Revolution External links *Texas Navy - Uniforms of the Republic of Texas (Texas Military Forces Museum.org) Category:Texas Military Forces Category:Texas Military Department Category:Texian ","title":"Texian Navy"},{"id":"32432511","text":"John Cooke D.D.

Leynes is regarded as one of the leaders of the \\"Magic Realist\\" movement of the Philippines. He was born in Santa Cruz, Manila. Biography Binatang X (1947), illustrated by Nestor Leynes. Leynes was born on February 26, 1922 in Santa Cruz, Manila. His parents were Ricardo Leynes, a doctor, and Enriqueta Garcia, a registered nurse. He had three brothers and a sister. Leynes' parents owned several paintings, including some by the Filipino master painter Fabi√°n Cueto de la Rosa, a distant relative of the family. Probably influenced by his environment, Leynes already expressed the desire to be an artist from a young age. His parents discouraged this ambition, fearing a life of hardship for him. Nevertheless, Leynes was already taking art lessons in grade school and highschool. He graduated from the Arellano High School and entered the College of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines. His studies were cut short in his fourth year by the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in World War II. Two days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, he married Amalia Alcantara, a childhood neighbor and sweetheart. Being already married, Leynes never returned to school after the war and thus never graduated. He found work as an illustrator for Ramon Roces Publications. He created illustrations for magazines like Liwayway and Philippine comics. He was hired as a staff artist for the Philippine Advertising Counsel. Later on, he became the executive vice president for the art department of the J. Romero and Associates Advertising Agency. Leynes resumed painting full-time after retiring in 1980 at the age of fifty eight. He died in March 2016 at the age of 94. Mention of death Work Realism work by Leynes. Duyan ('Cradle') showing Leynes' favorite subjects - the mother and child. Mag-ina sa Banig Leynes was strongly influenced by his professors during his time at the University of the Philippines. Among them were the Philippine National Artist Fernando Amorsolo and his younger brother Pablo Amorsolo. In 1976, Leynes discovered the works of Andrew Wyeth, a realist American painter whose works became popular in the Philippines during this period. Along with several other artists like Ger Viterbo, Jr., Joselito Barcelona, Emmanuel Llado, and Jaime Roque they formed a group known as the \\"Magic Realists\\" (not be confused with a separate movement known as Magic realism), after Wyeth's style. Leynes' first contribution was his 1977 work Bigas ('Rice', also known as Pitong Gatang). It was widely acclaimed for its attention to detail. Former first lady Imelda Marcos was so impressed by the work that she brought the entire collection to the Malaca√±an Palace for the viewing of her then guest of honor David Rockefeller. Marcos bought several paintings, while Rockefeller bought two. The painting Bigas was among those looted from the palace during the People Power Revolution of 1986. Leynes diverged from Wyeth's use of drab colors. Like other Filipino realist painters, he retained Amorsolo's influence, particularly in the use of light. While American realism focused on banality, Leynes and other Filipino realists depict romantic scenes in painstaking detail. Leynes' subjects are typically scenes of Philippine rural life, ranging from women sifting rice (like Bigas ni Lorna) to harvest scenes. He is best known for his favorite subject, that of the mother and child. He regularly paints a picture of Christ every Good Friday, a part of his panata (penance) during Lent. His works were exhibited along with other Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Collection paintings in the 2010 exhibit Sulyap, Yugto, Dalipay: Mementos of Philippine Everyday of the Metropolitan Museum of Manila. Although not representative of his work, his oil on canvas piece A Peasant's Funeral (1948) is on display at the National Museum of the Philippines.

Within the framework of municipal divisions, it serves as the administrative center of Puksoozerskoye Rural Settlement, one of the thirteen rural settlements in the district. Population: History Puksoozero was built in 1930 as the settlement for forcibly resettled peasants. At the time, it was directly subordinate to Plesetsk Settlement Soviet. The main occupation of the population was timber production and construction of the railroad connecting Puksoozero and Puksa railway station. In February 1938, the construction of a pulp mill No. 1 started. The construction was mainly carried out by prisoners of \\"Onegalag\\", with the headquarters located in the town of Plesetsk. In May 1939, the pulp mill No. 1 was put into operation. Pulp was used for the production of gunpowder, which was carried out in Vyborg, Leningrad Oblast. In 1944, Puksoozero was granted urban-type settlement status. During Stalin's rule, fourteen correctional labor camps existed in and around Puksoozero. These camps contained more than fifteen thousand prisoners. Three of these were located directly adjacent to the settlement, and the remaining camps were built along the railway. The prisoners were responsible for the timber logging. In 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, all colonies were closed. This caused the economic crisis, and the pump mill was shut down in 1994. The population of Puksoozero dropped by the factor of 3.5 between 1989 and 2010. Puksoozero had work settlement status until it was demoted to a rural locality in February 2013. Economy Industry The biggest enterprise in the settlement is Puksoozero Timber Enterprise (). Transportation A road connects Puksoozero with the urban-type settlement of Plesetsk; there is regular passenger bus traffic. Between 1930 and 2001, Puksoozero was on the Mekhrenga railroad, which at the time it was the longest, at . The railroad started at the Puksa station of the railway between Moscow and Arkhangelsk, and ran to the east, via Puksoozero to the Dalnyaya station. The locomotive depot was located in Puksoozero and closed in 2001. The railroad belonged to the State Department of Corrections and was used to transport timber. After 1966, it was gradually disassembled. The last stretch, between Puksa and Puksoozero, was closed and disassembled in 2001.

As an indigenous pygmy people, the Twa are generally assumed to be the oldest surviving population of the Great Lakes region. Current populations are found in the states of Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and the eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2000 they numbered approximately 80,000 people, making them a significant minority group in these countries. Apart from anthropological literature, the term \\"Twa\\" generally refers to the Twa of the Great Lakes region. There are a number of other Twa populations in the Congo forest, as well as southern Twa populations living in swamps and deserts where there has never been forest, but these are little known in the West. History Batwa women with traditional pottery Traditionally, the Twa have been semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers of the mountain forests living in association with agricultural villages, much as other pygmy peoples do. When the Hutu, a Bantu-speaking people, arrived in the region, they subjugated 'bush people' (hunter-gatherers) they called Abatwa, which are generally assumed to be the ancestors of the Twa today, though it may be that the Twa arrived alongside the Hutu, and either were a distinct people from the original inhabitants, or have mixed ancestry. Around the 15th century AD, the pastoralist Tutsi arrived and dominated both the Hutu and the Twa, creating a three-caste society with the Tutsi governing, the Hutu the bulk of the population, and the Twa at the bottom of the social scale, simultaneously despised, admired, and feared. For several hundred years, the Twa have been a small minority in the area, currently 1% in Rwanda and Burundi, and have had little political role, though there were at times Twa in the government of the Tutsi king. Unusually for Pygmies, who generally trade meat for agricultural products, iron, and pottery, the Twa are themselves potters. The Twa are often omitted in discussions about the conflict between the Hutus and Tutsis, which reached its height in the Rwandan genocide of 1994. About 30% of the Twa population of Rwanda died in the violence. The Twa of Uganda lived in the mountains of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest until 1992, when it was made a World Heritage Site for the endangered mountain gorilla. At that time they were expelled from the forest and placed in settlements. Current situation A traditional dance of the Batwa Pygmy boy in the village Shasha in North Kivu during 2007 conflicts. Due to clearing of the forests for agriculture, logging, development projects, and the creation of conservation areas, the Twa have been forced to leave the mountain forests and establish new homes. As they seek to develop new means of sustaining their communities (such as agriculture and livestock development) most are currently landless and live in poverty. The ancestral land rights of the Twa have never been recognised by their governments and no compensation has been made for lands lost. Twa children have little access to education and their communities have limited representation in local and national government. Due to their pygmy ancestry, they continue to suffer ethnic prejudice, discrimination, violence, and general exclusion from society. Batwa men struggle with alcoholism, known to occur in communities facing cultural collapse as men can no longer carry out traditional roles and provide for families. By 2007, begging was the primary source of livelihood for 40 percent of the Batwa in Rwanda. While the Batwa adapted to the changes in their environment by adopting new economic activities and thus traditions and identities, they continue to face challenges to their survival. Today, much of the available land, apart from areas reserved for wildlife conservation and environmental protection, is under cultivation. Unable to access their ancestral lands and practise traditional cultural and economic activities, the Batwa now perceive their pottery as an expression of their identity. Although it is no longer profitable since industrialised pottery became cheaply available, the Batwa continue to produce traditional pottery for its cultural and social significance. Not only do they consider it an ancestral tradition, but also it carries a social importance in their current day society. The process of digging the clay and carrying it to their settlements allows for socialisation and a sense of community among Batwa potters.

NSS is one of the spiritual foundations of Swami Nigamananda after Saraswata Matha, established at Kokilamukh, Jorhat in 1912. The \\"Sangha\\" focus only on spirituality (\\"dharma nitti-‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø\\") with three core objectives: i.e.formation of ideal family, combined of Sangha Power and exchange of spiritual thoughts. Banamali Dash was the first president of this Sangha, subsequently Durga Charan Mohanty became its Secretary and Parichalaka or Administer.Durga Charan Mohanty as Secretary and Parichalaka or Administer of Nilachala Saraswata Sangha, Puri History Swami Nigamananda was on a short retirement from his busy work. He left Assam Bangiya Saraswata Matha, Jorhat, (Assam) and came to Puri in 1923. He bought Nilachala Kutir near the Puri seashore, and it was there, that he spent the last 12 years of his life.Swami Nigamananda retired form his work and resided in Nilachala Kutir, Puri While living at Nilachala Kutir, the majority of people who met him on the quest of truth and knowledge could immediately discern the divine quality in him. Durga Charan Mohanty had the opportunity to read the master pieces, Yogiguru (‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡•Ä‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å), and Premikaguru (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ï‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å), authored by: Swami Nigamananda, in a library. His look at a vigraha, of Swami Nigamananda, present in the books, attracted him so much, that having seen it, he felt as if a current of thought vibrated in his mind. He felt a very close relationship with this portrait in past lives. With that realization, he began identifying with the Swami. He came to know that Swami Nigamananda was residing in Saraswata Matha, Kolilamukh, Jorhat, Assam. He wrote a letter to the Matha, desiring to know more about Swami Nigamananda. He was replied to from the Matha, that Swamiji was residing at Puri. March 20-1930 (Thursday), he met Swami Nigamananda for the first time, at Nilachala Kutir. Thereafter, he became a regular visitor to Nilachala Kutir for Swamiji's darshan. Durga Charan Mohanty was initiated (dikshya) as a disciple of Swami Nigamananda, in the year 1934. Durga Charan Mohanty noted all discussion, advices of Swami Nigamananda, and various everyday happening at Nilachala Kutir, and later published it in books, called ‚ÄúNilachala Vani\\"( ‡§®‡•Ä‡§≤‡§æ‡§ö‡§≤ ‡§µ‡§æ‡§£‡•Ä) and \\"Nigama Upadesha‚Äù(‡§®‡§ø‡§ó‡§Æ ‡§â‡§™‡§¶‡•á‡§∂). Swami Nigamananda had told to Durga Charan Mohanty that My disciples are around. They will come. Tell them about Me only when someone eagerly enquires. Obeying this advice, Durga Charan Mohanty had guided Nilachala Saraswata Sangha till 1985, his worldly departure at Biratunga. He wrote a lot of books on Swami Nigamananda and had opened more than 100 Nigamananda Ashrama in Odisha. He wrote and published a volumes of books, called \\"Sangha Sevaka\\"(‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ò ‡§∏‡•á‡§µ‡§ï). As a \\"sevak\\"(member) of Nilachala Saraswata Sangha, what kind of principles need to be followed are mentioned carefully in this series. Swami Nigamananda at Nilachala Kutir Puri Year 1934 was a very memorable year. Banamali Dash, Durga Charan Mohanty along with devotees, who were coming on the quest of truth and knowledge to Nilachala Kutir, sought permission from Swami Nigamananda to celebrate His birth day at Nilachala Kutir (Puri) on 24 August 1934, Full Moon day(Shraban Purnima). On occasion of His birth day Swami Nigamananda advised them to form a divine circle among them. As per His wishes they started an association for religious talk and thus Nilachala Saraswata Sanga(NSS) came into existence by the gradual growth of the group discussion and prayer. The under lying principles of the Sangha were fulfilling the triple objectives viz: *1. to lead and ideal family life (‡§Ü‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂ ‡§ó‡•É‡§π‡§∏‡•ç‡§• ‡§ó‡§†‡§®) *2. to establish more and more such association or Sangha and (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ò ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§†‡§æ) *3. to exchange each other's thought and idea's among the disciples (‡§≠‡§æ‡§µ ‡§¨‡§ø‡§®‡§ø‡§Æ‡§Ø) Swami Nigamananda deliberated his disciples about Nilachala Saraswata Sangha principles especially \\"formation of an ideal household life\\". According to Swami Nigamananda, He(self) should be worshipped. He taught them how His portrait should be placed on a royal chair giving utmost reverence generally paid to the Guru (spiritual master). He should be made the head of the family and ideal household life should be regulated under His direction.

English is one of the official languages of Pakistan (the other being Urdu) and has a history going back to the British colonial rule in South Asia (the British Raj); the national dialect spoken in the country is known as Pakistani English. Today, it occupies an important and integral part in modern Pakistani literature.\\"Prolegomena to the Study of Pakistani English and Pakistani Literature in English\\" (1989), Alamgir Hashmi, Pakistani Literature (Islamabad), 2:1 1993. Dr. Alamgir Hashmi introduced the term \\"Pakistani Literature [originally written] in English\\" with his \\"Preface\\" to his pioneering book Pakistani Literature: The Contemporary English Writers (New York, 1978; Islamabad, 1987) as well as through his other scholarly work and the seminars and courses taught by him in many universities since 1970's. It was established as an academic discipline in the world following his lead and further work by other scholars, and it is now a widely popular field of study. Background English language poetry from Pakistan from the beginning held a special place in South Asian writing, on account of the new trends represented by Shahid Suhrawardy, Ahmed Ali, Alamgir Hashmi, Taufiq Rafat, Daud Kamal, Maki Kureishi, Zulfikar Ghose, Waqas Ahmed Khwaja, Moniza Alvi, Bilal Faruqi, Shahid Suhrawardy, Omar Tarin, Kaleem Omar, Raja Changez Sultan and others. Dawn Poetry review, 9th April 2017 Retrieved February 5th 2020 Fiction from Pakistan began to receive recognition in the latter part of the 20th century. The early success of Pakistani English poets was followed in fiction by the prose works written by Ahmed Ali co-founder of The Progressive Writers Movement & Association, author of Twilight in Delhi, Angarey..., and Zulfikar Ghose, and by such figures as Bapsi Sidhwa, the Parsi author of The Crow Eaters, Cracking India (1988) and other novels. In the diaspora, Hanif Kureshi commenced a prolific career with the novel The Buddha of Suburbia (1990), which won the Whitbread Award. Moniza Alvi published several poetry collections and won British literary prizes. Tariq Ali published numerous novels and plays and broadcast TV scripts. Aamer Hussein wrote a series of acclaimed short story collections. Sara Suleri published her literary memoir, Meatless Days (1989). Many short story collections and some play scripts were also received well. The Pakistan Academy of Letters has awarded its prestigious prizes to a number of English writers. Saleem Akhtar Dhera is also a promising new name regarding Pakistani literature in English. His book of English poetry 'Pale Leaves' was published in 2007 and in the same year it was honoured with National Award by Government of Pakistan. He was also selected as a member of a youth delegation to China. In the early years of the 21st century, a number of Pakistani novelists writing in English won or were shortlisted for international awards. Mohsin Hamid published his first novel Moth Smoke (2000), which won the Betty Trask Award and was a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award; he has since published his second novel, The Reluctant Fundamentalist (2007), which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.

Singles are a type of music release that typically have fewer tracks than an extended play or an album. Throughout the 1970s the UK Singles Chart was compiled by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) from the sales data of a representative panel of record shops across the country, starting with about 250 shops at the beginning of the decade and increasing to around 450 stores by 1979. The \\"panel sales\\" data from each shop were then posted to the BMRB every week and a multiplication factor was then applied to obtain an estimate of total sales across the country. This procedure led to several problems with the collection of accurate data: the ease with which the panel sales data could be tampered with resulted in repeated accusations of chart rigging or hyping (culminating in an investigation by the ITV current affairs programme World in Action broadcast in August 1980, which found evidence that the record label WEA had been guilty of chart manipulation); some stores simply forgetting to return their data some weeks; postal strikes in the early 1970s meaning data could not be sent back to the BMRB; and every year only one set of data was collected over the two-week Christmas and New Year period each. As this was normally the busiest sales period of the year, it meant many records that were high in the charts over Christmas \\"lost\\" large numbers of sales. Some record companies also claimed higher sales figures for their records by quoting the amounts shipped to record shops instead, although these did not necessarily reflect the sales within those shops. Producing an accurate list of the best-selling singles of the 1970s in the United Kingdom has therefore never been a simple task because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate sales data from the period. An official chart of the best-selling singles of the 1970s was produced by the BMRB and broadcast on the UK's national pop music radio station BBC Radio 1 on 31 December 1979. However, this chart is no longer considered accurate due to the method of data collection by the BMRB and has since been superseded. The 19 September 2009 issue of the UK music trade magazine Music Week included a special supplement to celebrate its 50th anniversary. It included updated charts of the top twenty best-selling singles of each decade of the magazine's existence, based on the most recent information available from the Official Charts Company (OCC). The following chart is therefore the most up to date estimate of the top twenty best-selling singles of the 1970s, with sales figures for the top ten up until the end of 1979 as estimated by the OCC. (\\"1959‚Äì2009: Anniversary Special\\" supplement, p. 18.) Between 1970 and 1979, fourteen different singles sold more than one million copies each in the UK. The biggest-selling single of the decade was \\"Mull of Kintyre\\" by the British band Wings. Released in November 1977, the song became Christmas number one and the first single ever to sell more than two million copies in the UK. Best-selling singles Boney M. released two of the top four biggest songs of the 1970s. {|class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" !scope=col !scope=col |Title !scope=col |Artist !scope=col |Year !scope=col |Estimated sales |- !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1 \\"Mull of Kintyre\\"/\\"Girls' School\\" Wings style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1977 style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 2,050,000 |- !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2 \\"Rivers of Babylon\\"/\\"Brown Girl in the Ring\\" Boney M. style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1978 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1,985,000 |- !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"3 \\"You're the One That I Want\\" and Olivia Newton John style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1978 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1,975,000 |- !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"4 \\"Mary's Boy Child\\" Boney M. style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1978 style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1,790,000 |- !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"5 \\"Summer Nights\\" and Olivia Newton John style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1978 style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1,515,000 |- !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"6 \\"Y.M.C.A.\\" Village People style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1978 style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1,380,000 |- !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"7 \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" Queen style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1975 style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1,300,000 |- !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"8 \\"Heart of Glass\\" Blondie style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1979 style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1,180,000 |- !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"9 \\"Bright Eyes\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1979 style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1,150,000 |- !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"10 \\"Don't Give Up on Us\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1976 style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1,145,000 |- !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"11 \\"I Love You Love Me Love\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1973 - !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"12 \\"Merry Xmas Everybody\\" Slade style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1973 - !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"13 \\"Save Your Kisses for Me\\" Brotherhood of Man style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1976 - !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"14 \\"Eye Level\\" Simon Park Orchestra style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1972 - !scope=row style=\\"text- align:center;\\"15 \\"Long Haired Lover from Liverpool\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1973 - !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"16 \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\" Pink Floyd style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1979 - !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"17 \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1976 - !scope=row style=\\"text- align:center;\\"18 \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1971 - !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"19 \\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\\" Dawn featuring Tony Orlando style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1973 - !scope=row style=\\"text-align:center;\\"20 \\"Under the Moon of Love\\" Showaddywaddy style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 1976 } Previous charts Record Business chart (mid‚Äì1979) The first attempt to create a list of the best-selling singles of the decade was produced by Record Business and published in the BPI Year Book 1979. Record Business was a short-lived chart statistics company ‚Äì headed by Barry Lazell, its staff included Alan Jones, who would become the leading authority on UK chart statistics and sales for the next thirty years. The BPI Year Book chart was a list of the biggest-selling singles in the UK for the period 1960-79: although it was published midway through 1979, the list includes the year's two biggest selling singles, \\"Bright Eyes\\" by Art Garfunkel and \\"Heart of Glass\\" by Blondie. Stripping out the songs from the 1960s, the remaining 16 songs in the list, in order, were: # \\"Mull of Kintyre\\"/\\"Girls' School\\" ‚Äì Wings # \\"Rivers of Babylon\\"/\\"Brown Girl in the Ring\\" ‚Äì Boney M. # \\"You're the One That I Want\\" ‚Äì John Travolta and Olivia Newton John # \\"Mary's Boy Child\\" ‚Äì Boney M. # \\"Summer Nights\\" - John Travolta and Olivia Newton John # \\"Y.M.C.A.\\" ‚Äì Village People # \\"Bright Eyes\\" ‚Äì Art Garfunkel # \\"Bohemian Rhapsody ‚Äì Queen # \\"Heart of Glass\\" ‚Äì Blondie # \\"I Love You Love Me Love\\" ‚Äì Gary Glitter # \\"Don't Give Up on Us\\" ‚Äì David Soul # \\"Eye Level\\" ‚Äì Simon Park Orchestra # \\"Save Your Kisses for Me\\" ‚Äì Brotherhood of Man # \\"Long Haired Lover from Liverpool\\" ‚Äì Little Jimmy Osmond # \\"Merry Xmas Everybody\\" ‚Äì Slade # \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\\" ‚Äì The New Seekers BMRB official chart (December 1979) In December 1979 the BMRB produced the official lists of the 100 biggest selling singles and albums of the 1970s. The lists were published in the issue of Music Week dated 22 December 1979 and the singles list was reproduced in The Guinness Book of Hits of the 70's the following year. All 100 singles and a track from each of the top 100 albums were played on BBC Radio 1 on 31 December 1979 between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. As these lists were published before the end of 1979, it is assumed that the cut-off date was the week ending 8 December 1979, and consequently the lists are missing sales from the last three weeks of the decade. The single that lost out most as a result of this decision was \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\" by Pink Floyd, which was the current number one in the singles chart and selling strongly: it would go on to pass one million sales the following month. Almost immediately chart followers began to point out the inconsistencies in the BMRB list, with Alan Jones describing it as \\"a farce\\" in his weekly column for the music magazine Record Mirror in the issue dated 9 February 1980. The biggest surprise was the placing of Rod Stewart's \\"Sailing\\" at number four, ahead of several singles that had already been certified million sellers before the end of 1979 ‚Äì \\"Sailing\\" itself was not certified to have sold a million copies until 2010, more than two decades later. Jones pointed out that the BMRB had calculated its chart based purely on the panel sales data, rather than actual sales data figures, and consequently sales for singles that had sold well over the Christmas period had been underestimated. The 1978 Christmas number one, \\"Mary's Boy Child\\", already certified to have sold over a million copies by the end of 1978, was at number 16, behind several songs that have still not reached the million sales mark in 2015. Meanwhile, \\"Merry Xmas Everyone\\", which Jones calculated had sold 989,000 copies by the end of the 1970s and which was certified a million seller just nine months after the chart was produced, was only at number 67. Although the BMRB list remains the only \\"official\\" chart of the decade, it has since been widely discredited as unreliable. The BMRB top twenty for the 1970s was: # \\"Mull of Kintyre\\"/\\"Girls' School\\" ‚Äì Wings # \\"Rivers of Babylon\\"/\\"Brown Girl in the Ring\\" ‚Äì Boney M. # \\"You're the One That I Want\\" ‚Äì John Travolta and Olivia Newton John # \\"Sailing\\" ‚Äì Rod Stewart # \\"Save Your Kisses for Me\\" ‚Äì Brotherhood of Man # \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\\" ‚Äì The New Seekers # \\"Summer Nights\\" ‚Äì John Travolta and Olivia Newton John # \\"Don't Give Up on Us\\" ‚Äì David Soul # \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" ‚Äì Queen # \\"Under the Moon of Love\\" ‚Äì Showaddywaddy # \\"Mississippi\\" ‚Äì Pussycat # \\"My Sweet Lord\\" ‚Äì George Harrison # \\"Bright Eyes\\" ‚Äì Art Garfunkel # \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" ‚Äì Elton John and Kiki Dee # \\"Amazing Grace\\" ‚Äì The Pipes and Drums and Military Band of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards # \\"Mary's Boy Child\\" ‚Äì Boney M. # \\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\\" ‚Äì Dawn featuring Tony Orlando # \\"If You Leave Me Now\\" ‚Äì Chicago # \\"Y.M.C.A.\\" ‚Äì Village People # \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" ‚Äì Julie Covington MRIB chart (January 1980) Record Business produced its own rival list of the best-selling singles of the 1970s for the BMRB's chief competitor, the Market Research Information Bureau (MRIB).

It is walled on three sides by steep bush-clad slopes. Most of its level land is occupied by Williams Park and an independent boys' primary school, originally a part of Williams Park. Wellington shipowner, J H Williams, bought land in Days Bay near the end of the 19th century to create custom for his smaller vessels, building a wharf and turning the bay into a sports and resort development for day-trippers and holiday-makers. Williams sold his interest in 1905 and the new owners split off building sites on unneeded land.

Better road access was achieved, a bus service provided and the ferries lost custom and Williams Park lost some of its visitors. Suburban electric trains up the west coast and the rise of private cars in the second half of the 20th century opened new options for Wellingtonians. Since public ownership in 1914, aside from the maturing of trees, no waterslide and a new small pavilion, more than a century has elapsed and Williams Park has changed little. Days Bay, early morning April 2010, the most distant of the orange tile roofs is the Day's Bay House building European settlement Days Bay was at first known to settlers as Hawtrey Bay. It was settled by George Day and his family who had immigrated from Kent aboard the Arab in 1841. A William Tod appears to have employed George Day to look after his interests in the area while he went south. They had permission to cut and sell firewood and timber. The Days built their house in the bay and operated a schooner that ferried early settlers between the Hutt Valley and Wellington. After their house was severely damaged by an earthquake in November 1849 the Day family left the bay aboard the schooner Flirt, captained by their eldest son George Frederick Day, and sailed to Lyttelton in Canterbury, the port for the new settlement of Christchurch. By December 1849 the family had settled in Sumner and George Day had become a road construction overseer, while the rest of the family appears to have continued their firewood, timber and shipping activities.Celia and Cecil Manson, Days Bay, My Brilliant Suburb ed.

Destination resort A destination resort is a self-contained development that provides for visitor-oriented accommodations and developed recreational facilities in a setting with high natural amenities.Statutes, State of Oregon, USA J H Williams a Wellington ship owner and son of another prosperous Wellington ship owner like some other owners ran excursions to Lowry Bay in a work boat dressed for the day in flags and bunting. They were popular with church groups, employees out for their annual company picnic and the like as well as the general public. Lowry Bay's wharf was becoming unsound and at the end of the 1880s Williams rebuilt it at his own expense. A refreshment booth was organised, playground equipment was brought in for young children and races and other activities set up for the older ones and the excursions became a great success. Williams' income came from carrying the people to Lowry Bay and not from their activities once on dry land. Wanting to participate in the takings from those shore activities he took an opportunity in November 1894Extensive Sale of City Properties, The Evening Post 8 October 1894 Page 3 to buy the principal 125 acres section of beachfront in Days Bay, got permission to build a wharfHarbour Board.

Generally passengers were carried by Duco which also performed tugboat duties but at the end of 1897 the specially designed and built for Williams, licensed for 1,029 passengers, electrically lit steamer Duchess arrived from her builders in Glasgow.

He had put ten successful years work into Day's Bay. The Evening Post reported about 4000 had visited Days Bay on Anniversary Day 1905.Local and General. Evening Postvolume=LXIXissue=19, 24 January 1905 His real pleasure was in running his resort and finding extra work for his commercial vessels in their slack times. By 1905 there was less commercial work available. The Union Company had bought two tugs for its own operations and there were other smaller competitors. A wharf had been built at Rona Bay and building sites were being sold. The usual civic institutions were beginning to take root in the neighbourhood, initially an unelected group calling themselves The Day's Bay Ratepayers Association. Properly constituted they would see a useful tax source in his business and in any case he did not want to run a scheduled commuter ferry service to please permanent residents. Williams had successfully floated Wellington Steam Ferry Company Limited in 1900, a public listed company, and put his own business into its ownership. That way he raised enough extra capital to improve and expand the resort's facilities and acquire another ferry. He now put his share of Wellington Steam Ferry and its 226 acres of Day's Bay up for sale and in August 1905 it was bought by a syndicate led by William Watson of the Bank of New Zealand. Wellington Steam Ferry became a subsidiary of Watson's newly formed Wellington Harbour Ferries Limited. Within a month an auction of 66 building sites was advertised. It seemed all Wellington protested. Harold Beauchamp, father of Katherine Mansfield appealed to the Premier, Richard Seddon, for the Government to acquire Days Bay and proclaim it a National Park \\"for all time\\".\\"It has been proposed to acquire under the Scenery Preservation Act the native bush at Day's Bay. A petition is now in circulation praying the Government to acquire not only the bush, but the whole of the Ferry Company's Day's Bay estate. The petition reads:‚Äî \\"To the Right Hon. the Premier, Wellington, ‚Äî We the undersigned residents of Eastbourne and Wellington . . .

Evening Postvolume=lxxissue=115, 11 November 1905 No government help was forthcoming. After the uproar abated the auction went ahead. Wellington Harbour Ferries found revenue enough to maintain the ferry service but wanted the profits from more subdivision in Day's Bay. Its focus became property development, it had a ferry service to make the properties attractive. It lost Miramar business when trams arrived and, as expected by Williams, Harbour Board and Eastbourne Borough Council both pushed up wharf rentals. Duco was sent to the Chathams to fish and earn cash but disappeared with all hands. The Council would not buy the bush-clad slopes for a reserve.

The timetable was increased and the service made more convenient for East Harbour residents. In 1923 the council purchased Muritai but it proved an expensive vessel to run. The paving of the Hutt Road and the extension of the bitumen to Muritai lowered ferry custom and the council was obliged to buy a fleet of buses. Duchess was sold in 1934. Muritai was taken over for Defence purposes in August 1940.Ferry Taken Over.

Day's Bay House soon after it was built Days Bay House Day's Bay House was built in 1903 for J H Williams's Wellington Steam Ferry Company. The resort hotel operation met with only moderate success and in 1913 with its immediate surrounds, 4 acres, it was sold to Miss Gladys Sommerville and building and grounds became Croydon School. Williams Park When the resort without hotel became available at the end of 1913 once again strong public pressure arose for the Government or Wellington City Council to buy it. Having no satisfaction from these organisations a Citizens' Committee was formed and it called for donations. Much the largest were from the Government, ¬£4,000 and the Wellington City Council ‚Äîthe same amount‚Äîand from Mrs W R Williams, widowed mother of the park's founder, J H Williams.Williams Park City Reserve at Day's Bay, Evening Postvolume=lxxxviiissue=59, 11 March 1914 The Wellington City Council announced on 11 March 1914 that councillors had visited and inspected the land in Days Bay and after a special meeting in the evening in committee resolved to buy it on the terms submitted by the deputation of citizens and the vendors. The foreshore rights vested in the company would now vest in the Wellington City Council. Mrs W R Williams was given a copy of the following resolution by the Council: \\"That this council place on record its deep sense of the public spirit manifested by Mrs W R Williams in contributing a sum of ¬£1,500 towards the fund for the purchase of the Day's Bay grounds for public purposes and in recognition of her generosity hereby resolves that the reserve shall henceforth be known as Williams Park\\".

The whole far or eastern side of the harbour had become known as Eastbourne by the turn of the 19th to 20th century but it was still referred to as the-district-round-about-Day's-Bay. Modern Eastbourne was then Rona Bay (within) Day's Bay and its broader neighbour to its south, Muritai (within) Day's Bay, both accessible by Day's Bay steamer.Page 6 Advertisements Column 4, Evening Postvolume=lviiissue=1, 3 January 1899 That is to say Rona Bay (or Brown's Bay or Okiwi) and Muritai (or Robinson's Bay) were in Day's Bay and the province of the Day's Bay Ratepayers Association, a free association of like-minded residents and not an elected body. Some letters to The Evening Post described the Association as a coterie.

Content Traditionally the royal instructions were issued to a Governor to: * tell him how the Executive Council and legislative council were to be constituted, how their procedure was to be regulated, and how he was to work with them * set out the how legislation was to be framed * instruct him as to which classes of legislation he must refuse his assent * regulate precedence * set out how copies of certain formal documents and records were to be communicated to the British government Legal status Royal instructions were a commonly used legal instrument of British imperial law used in the governing of the empire's colonies. Royal instructions delegated to colonial governors the legal capacity to exercise the Crown's royal prerogative and set out the limits and conditions within which that prerogative was to be exercised. The royal instructions given to a colonial governor were one of three documents normally used for constituting the government of a colony,Wright, Martin. p.142 \\"The Development of the Legislative Council 1606-1945\\", in the series \\"Studies in Colonial Legislatures\\" edited by Margery Perham of the Institute of Colonial Studies, Oxford, England (Faber & Faber, 1946) the others being the letters patent or order in council constituting the office of governor and commander- in-chief, and the governor's commission obliging him to follow the instructions he received from the Privy Council in London. As explained in the book, Royal Government in America, it is \\"The British authorities clearly looked upon the instructions as constitutional documents of the greatest importance which all members of the colonial government were expected to obey.\\" For example, when, in the late 1750s, the Governor of Virginia approved three Acts in contravention of regulations incorporated into his royal instructions, the Privy Council struck down the Acts and admonished the Governor, reminding him that his instructions in this regard were ‚Äúcoeval with the Constitution of the British Colonies‚Äù and formed \\"an Essential part of that Constitution and cannot be sett aside a without subverting Fundimental Principle of it.\\" As at 1945 there were eight legislative councils which had been constituted by royal instructions: the Falkland Islands, the Gambia, Hong Kong, Kenya, Nyasaland, Seychelles, the Straits Settlements and Uganda; while others had been constituted by order in council, letters patent, local ordinance or by act of the imperial parliament at Westminster.Wright, Martin. \\"The Development of the Legislative Council 1606-1945\\", in the series \\"Studies in Colonial Legislatures\\" edited by Margery Perham of the Institute of Colonial Studies, Oxford, England (Faber & Faber, 1946) Continuing importance in Canada With Confederation, Canada inherited a Constitution \\"similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom\\". Thus, those elements of the constitution of the Provinces of Canada that were not displaced by the Constitution Act, 1867 or subsequent legislation continue in force in the country. At the time of Confederation and still to this day, certain subjects matters remain within the scope of the Crown‚Äôs prerogative powers, such as international treaty making and the creation of Indian reserves. However, the limits on those powers and the guidelines for their use that were set out in the instructions to the governors of Canada‚Äôs constituent colonies were incorporated into Canada‚Äôs constitution and, unless displaced, bind the Crown in Right of Canada‚Äôs actions. The continued importance of Royal Instructions can has been noted by the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada‚Äôs decision in St. Catherines Milling, in which it was stated that the Royal Proclamation of 1763 must be read \\"together with the Royal instructions given to the Governors as to its strict enforcement\\" and that, when taken together, these constitute \\"the Indian Bill of Rights\\". Numerous contemporary decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada refer to Royal Instructions given to colonial governors, without necessarily analysing their legal status. Canada after Confederation Initially the form of royal instructions remained essentially unchanged after the development of responsible government. Detailed criticism in 1876 by Edward Blake (Canada's federal Minister of Justice) of the wording of both the letters patent appointing the Governor General of Canada and the royal instructions issued to him led to changes to both sets of instruments for each of the dominions, to better reflect how they were actually governed.

A single is a type of music release defined by the British Official Charts Company (OCC) as having no more than four tracks and not lasting longer than 25 minutes. On 31 May 2011, a retrospective record chart was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 that listed the 60 biggest-selling singles in the United Kingdom during the 1960s. The programme, entitled The Top 60 Best Selling Records of the 60s, was hosted by British DJ Tony Blackburn. The chart was compiled by the OCC, and was based on sales of singles from 1 January 1960 to 31 December 1969. The most represented act in the chart is the Beatles, who feature on the list with 18 releases, seven of which are in the top twenty. Similarly, the most represented record label is Parlophone, who released music from the Beatles between 1962 and 1968 in the UK. The most represented act after the Beatles is the Rolling Stones, who have five singles in the list. The highest-placed solo female artist on the list is Cilla Black at number 27, with her 1964 single \\"Anyone Who Had a Heart\\", which was also distributed by Parlophone. Of the 60 discs in the chart, more than half (44) are by British acts. During the 1960s, sales of singles in the UK were monitored by several magazines, including New Musical Express (NME), Record Retailer, Melody Maker and Disc. Before 1969, no officially recognised singles chart was published in the UK. Until 10 March 1960, chart compilers used the weekly chart listed by NME, after which they moved to the singles list published by Record Retailer, despite NME having the wider circulation and higher readership. During the start of the decade, Record Retailer was sampling roughly 30 stores; NME and Melody Maker had a sample size of more than one hundred. One source explains that the reason for using the Record Retailer chart for the early 1960s was that it was \\"the only chart to have as many as 50 positions for almost the entire decade\\". On 15 February 1969, Record Retailer and the BBC jointly commissioned the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) to record sales of singles in what officially became the UK Singles Chart. The BMRB compiled the chart by using hand-written and post-submitted data from approximately 250 record stores. Between 1960 and 1969, fourteen singles sold more than one million copies in the UK, of which the biggest-selling was \\"She Loves You\\" by the Beatles. Released on 23 August 1963, the single spent six non-consecutive weeks at number one and sold more than 1.89 million copies, approximately 140,000 more than its nearest rival, \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", also by the Beatles. The biggest-selling record not to top the UK Singles Chart was Acker Bilk's 1961 instrumental \\"Stranger on the Shore\\" ‚Äì it sold more than 1.13 million copies and peaked at number two, being kept off the top by \\"The Young Ones\\" by Cliff Richard and the Shadows, another million-seller.

The Times. 13 July 2011 Dawood is wanted on the charges of terrorism, murder, extortion, targeted killing, drug trafficking and various other cases. He was designated as a global terrorist in 2003 by India and the United States with a reward of US$25 million on his head for his believed role in the 1993 Bombay bombings. In 2011, he was named number three on \\"The World's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives\\" by the FBI and Forbes.\\"Dawood 4th 'most wanted' criminal on Forbes list\\". Forbes. (29 April 2008). Retrieved 16 April 2012. Early life Dawood Ibrahim was born on 26 December 1955 in a Konkani Muslim family in Khed in Maharashtra, India. His father, Ibrahim Kaskar, worked as a head constable with the Mumbai Police and his mother, Amina, was a homemaker. He lived in the Temkar Mohalla area of Dongri and attended Ahmed Sailor High School from which he dropped out. Criminal career Dawood started his career in crime by engaging in fraud, robbery and petty crimes in his early teens and later joined the gang of Baashu Dada, a local don. He later split from the gang and created his own gang with his elder brother Shabir Ibrahim Kaskar in the late 1970s. After Shabir was killed by the rival Pathan gang, he became the sole boss of his gang, known as the D-Company. He was then chiefly involved in gold smuggling, real estate, extortion and drug trafficking. He fled India for Dubai in 1986 after being wanted by the Mumbai Police for the murder of Samad Khan. In the following years he further expanded his gang with the help of his second-in- command Chhota Rajan, with his gang having over 5000 members and bringing in tens of crores of rupees in revenue annually in the early 1990s. He was named by the Indian government as one of the masterminds in the 1993 Mumbai Attacks. Following the attacks he fled Dubai for Karachi, where he is said to be living to this day. The United States Department of the Treasury designated Ibrahim as a terrorist as part of its international sanctions program, effectively forbidding US financial entities from working with him and seizing assets believed to be under his control. The Department of Treasury keeps a fact sheet on Ibrahim which contains reports of his syndicate having smuggling routes from South Asia, the Middle-East and Africa shared with and used by terrorist organization al-Qaeda. The fact sheet also said that Ibrahim's syndicate is involved in large-scale shipment of narcotics in the United Kingdom and Western Europe. He is also believed to have had contacts with al- Qaeda leader Osama bin-Laden. In the late 1990s, Ibrahim traveled to Afghanistan under the Taliban's protection. The syndicate has consistently aimed to destabilise India through riots, terrorism, civil disobedience and pumping fake Indian currency notes into the country. India Today reported that Ibrahim provided the logistics for the 2008 Mumbai attacks.India Today . Indiatoday.digitaltoday.in (28 November 2008). Retrieved 16 April 2012. Presently, Ibrahim's criminal activities are terror funding, drug trafficking, gunrunning, extortion and money laundering. He has also heavily invested in real estate in Karachi, Dubai and India. Ibrahim is believed to control much of the hawala system, which is the very commonly used unofficial system for transferring money and remittances outside the view of official agents. Ibrahim was linked to the financing of increasing attacks in Gujarat by Lashkar-e-Taiba. In 2006, the government of India handed over to Pakistan, a list of 38 most wanted criminals including Ibrahim. His crime syndicate spreads across Asia, Europe and Africa, with over 40% of its earnings coming from India.Chandigarh, India ‚Äì Main News. The Tribune. (31 December 2000). Retrieved 16 April 2012.'ISI pressured Dawood to carry out Mumbai blasts'. Rediff.com (22 December 2002). Retrieved 16 April 2012. 1993 Bombay bombings Dawood is widely believed to have masterminded the March 1993 bombings in Bombay. In 2003, the Indian and United States governments declared Ibrahim a \\"Global Terrorist.\\" The Indian Deputy Prime Minister Lal Krishna Advani described it as a major development. Ibrahim is currently on India's \\"Most Wanted List\\". In a public discourse in June 2017, Ram Jethmalani confirmed that after the Bombay blasts, Dawood Ibrahim had called him from London, saying that he was prepared to come to India and stand trial, on the condition that he should not be subjected to any third degree treatment from the police. Jethmalani had conveyed this to Sharad Pawar, but the politicians in power did not agree to this proposal. As per Jethmalani, their refusal to allow Dawood's return was due to their fears that he would expose their secrets. Location Ibrahim is previously believed to be living in Pakistan and then in the United Arab Emirates. India says he has shifted to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Indian sources add that \\"Inter-Services Intelligence appeared extremely wary of the new Indo-US cooperation to fight terrorism. The Inter-Services Intelligence and Dawood appear under a lot of pressure\\" On 5 May 2015 MP Haribhai Chaudhary informed the Lok Sabha (the lower house of India's Parliament) that the whereabouts of Ibrahim were unknown. However, on 11 May, Rajnath Singh, the then Home Minister of India, told the parliament that Ibrahim was in Pakistan and he will bring him back to India. According to claims of Indian news media Times Now on 22 August 2015, Dawood was in Karachi, Pakistan. According to said media corporation, they had conversation with a woman in Karachi on August 22, 2015. Transcripts of conversations which were published on the news agency's website, in one conversation she said that she is Dawood's wife and \\"he is sleeping\\", while in the second conversation she said that there was no one by that name known to her. According to a dossier prepared by India in August 2015, to be handed over to Pakistan, Ibrahim has nine residences in Pakistan and has three Pakistani passports which he frequently uses to travel. On 22 August 2020, Pakistan issued two notifications sanctioning key terrorist figures. In it, three addresses of Dawood Ibrahim were listed \\"White House, Near Saudi Mosque, Clifton\\" in Karachi, Pakistan; in addition to \\"House Nu 37 - 30th Street - defence, Housing Authority, Karachi\\" and \\"Palatial bungalow in the hilly area of Noorabad in Karachi\\". Pakistan denied it was admitting he was in Pakistan, stating the notifications only contained what was listed in the list of sanctioned individuals and the entities belonging to the United Nations.  Search for Dawood Ibrahim  He was third on Forbes's The World's 10 Most Wanted list from 2010 until it stopped publishing the list in 2011, and is designated a \\"global terrorist\\". Many attempts have been made to locate Ibrahim by the Indian intelligence agencies, Research and Analysis Wing and Intelligence Bureau (IB), ever since he went into hiding. His location has been frequently traced to Karachi, Pakistan, a claim which the Pakistani authorities have frequently denied. The claims were further established in August 2015, when a phone call made to his home by an Indian television channel, Times Now, was answered by his wife, who confirmed his presence at their home in Karachi. The Indian intelligence agencies immediately prepared a dossier of Ibrahim which included evidence of his location in Karachi, among other evidence. It was to be presented at the National Security Agency-level talks between the two countries in the same month, which was however, called off due to political reasons. In an interview with India Today, Chhota Rajan, a former aide of Ibrahim, who he later fell out with in 1992, said that, \\"He [Ibrahim] does travel out of Pakistan once in a while but Karachi is his base.\\" Chhota Rajan vs Dawood Ibrahim Chhota Rajan is believed to have assisted intelligence agencies in getting a low down on the activities of the D-Company and its members by using his intimate knowledge of the criminal enterprise and its operations from his experience. To reinforce his reputation as a patriotic gangster don, Chhota Rajan threatened to brutally murder those accused of engineering the 1993 Mumbai bombings.Chhota Rajan, The ‚ÄòPatriotic Don‚Äô - Scroll.IN Reporting Saleem ‚ÄòKurla‚Äô in April 1998 followed by Mohammad Jindran in June 1998 and Majeed Khan on 1 March 1999 were shot dead. The Shiv Sena, which ruled Maharashtra in a coalition with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from 1994 to 1999, is speculated to have sympathized with Chhota Rajan. It is reported that selective police action against the Ibrahim crime syndicate during the Shiv Sena administration and its subsequent decline through encounter killings helped strengthen Chhota Rajan's position in the underworld. This is similar to how Dawood Ibrahim himself had benefitted from the 1980s police campaign against the Pathans.Police Action During Mumbai Gang Wars - Press Reader Reporting The Shiv Sena laid bare its affection for Chhota Rajan in an editorial in the Saamna newspaper, its mouthpiece, edited by Bal Thackeray. The editorial heaved a sigh of relief, attributing Chhota Rajan's survival to \\"good fortune\\" resulting from divine grace. The Pakistani Inter- Services Intelligence (ISI) was believed to be behind the attempted assassination of Chhota Rajan. In February 2010, alleged Chhota Rajan associates gunned down Nepali media baron Jamim Shah point blank in broad daylight as he was driving to his residence on a public road. Shah ostensibly had links with Dawood Ibrahim and was the mastermind of a racket producing counterfeit Indian currency within Nepal. His anti-Indian criminal activities had rankled the Indian government for more than a decade and half prior. Family In 2006, Ibrahim's daughter, Mahrukh Ibrahim, married Junaid Miandad, the son of Pakistani cricketer Javed Miandad. In 2011, his daughter Mehreen, 24, married Ayub, a Pakistani - American. His son Moin married Saniya, daughter of a London-based businessman on 25 September 2011.Dawood's son Moin marries London girl in Karachi Several of his family members, including his brother, Iqbal Kaskar, live in Mumbai.http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/unfair-to-deny-passport- for-being-dawoods-brother-kaskar/ In popular culture Ibrahim and his syndicate D-Company have been linked to the financing of the Bollywood movie industry. A number of Bollywood studios and films were financed by D-Company in the 1980s and 1990s. Ibrahim was linked to a number of celebrities during that time, including the beauty pageant contestant Anita Ayub and the Bollywood actress Mandakini. D-Company is also known for extortion and threats targeted towards Bollywood producers and celebrities, and was involved in the murders of Bollywood producers Javed Siddique and Gulshan Kumar.10 Times Bollywood Actors Crossed Paths With The Underworld, ScoopWhoop, 11 August 2015 The 2002 film Company is based loosely on D-Company's activities, and its sequel (prequel to events in the movie), the 2005 film D, as well as Shootout at Lokhandwala (2007), the 2010 film Once Upon a Time in Mumbai and 2013 film D-Day. The 2013 movie Shootout at Wadala is based on the rise of the D-Company. The film Haseena Parkar (2017) is a biographical crime film based on his sister, Haseena Parkar. The 2018 video game Hitman 2 features a Mumbai crime lord active in the movie industry called \\"Dawood Rangan\\" as a target, presumably as a reference to Ibrahim himself.

This illustrates the conflict many of these soldiers had with their identity as Japanese soldiers and their heritage as Taiwanese Seediq warriors.

Bridging the story of the fourth album Seediq Bale, which took place in 1930, and the story of the fifth album Mirror Of Retribution, which took place in 1947, the latest album Takasago Army, which recounts the story that occurred from 1940 to 1945, was actually the last puzzle of Chthonic's trilogy.\\"http://www.deadpress.co.uk/6597/track-by-track-chthonic- takasago-army/ Recording and Production In an interview with Metalship, Freddy Lim commented on the band's songwriting process for Takasago Army, saying: \\"In the early years, we played a kind of metal like the western kind. And the more we played, the more we put Taiwanese elements into the music. All particularly in the new album Takasago Army, the whole 'writing' philosophy has been changed. We used to write metal, and then add some Taiwanese feelings and emotions, but this time I write Taiwanese songs.

Life Family home of Ch√¢teau de Servigny, outside Valognes While the family came from Bellefonds, in the central French department of Nouvelle- Aquitaine, Bernadin's branch settled in Chef-du-Pont, near Valognes, in Normandy. His paternal grandfather Bernardin Gigault de Bellefonds (1580‚Äì1639) was Governor of Valognes and Caen; his grandmother Jeanne Suzanne (?‚Äì1652) was the daughter of Henri-Robert-aux-√âpaules, Lieutenant g√©n√©ral du roi in Normandy. Bernadin was the only child of Henri-Robert Gigault (?‚Äì1643), also Governor of Valognes and Caen, and Marie d'Avoynes, who brought the Servigny properties into the family. His father was one of eight and he had a wide circle of relatives in Normandy and Acquitaine. He married Madeleine Fouquet de Chalain (1639‚Äì1716) in 1655 and they had 9 children; Jean (1660‚Äì1668), Louis-Christophe, killed at Steenkerque in 1692, Marie-√âl√©onore (?‚Äì1717), Th√©r√®se-Marie (1667‚Äì1733), Jeanne-Susanne (1665‚Äì1698), Louise (?), Bernardine- Th√©r√®se (?‚Äì1717), Fran√ßoise Bonne (1676‚Äì1693) and Marie-Armande-Agn√®s. His titles and estates were inherited by his grandson, Louis-Charles Bernadin (1685‚Äì1710). Career Cognac; Bellefonds defended it against Frondeurs under Cond√© in November 1651 In the first half of the 17th century, France was divided internally and threatened externally; while it largely stayed out of the 1618‚Äì1648 Thirty Years' War, support for the Dutch Republic in its war of independence from Spain eventually led to the 1635‚Äì1659 Franco-Spanish War. At home, the French Wars of Religion that had ended with the 1590 Edict of Nantes flared up again in a series of domestic Huguenot rebellions in the 1620s. The accession of the five-year old Louis XIV in 1643 caused a power struggle between his regents, headed by his mother, Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin, opposed by regional magnates like Cond√©. This resulted in the 1648‚Äì1653 civil war known as the Fronde; Bellefonds became Governor of Valognes after his father's death in 1643 and in 1649 held it against rebel troops or Frondeurs. Similarly, in November 1651 he defended Cognac in Nouvelle-Aquitaine when besieged by Frondeurs under Cond√©, until it was relieved by the Comte d' Harcourt in early December. Fort Navagne, on the Meuse, taken and destroyed by Bellefonds in May 1674 but contrary to his orders; he was relieved of command In the latter stages of the Franco-Spanish war, he served in Catalonia and Flanders, including the decisive Battle of the Dunes in June 1658, which led to the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees and he was promoted Lieutenant-General in 1659. He was also employed in maritime operations, acting as deputy to the duc de Guise in his failed attempt to capture Naples in 1654 and in 1666 was sent to the Dutch Republic to discuss joint fleet operations against England.De P√©rini, Batailles fran√ßaises, Volume IV p. 241 In 1663, he was appointed head of the Maison du Roi or the King's household; given its proximity to Louis XIV, this was a position of great importance, held by an individual of proven loyalty. In the 1667‚Äì1668 War of Devolution, France quickly over-ran Franche-Comt√© and much of the Spanish Netherlands; after the capture of Lille in 1667, Turenne detached a cavalry force under Bellefonds and de Cr√©quy to cut off the Spanish retreat. They inflicted nearly 2,000 casualties, with Louis looking on; in 1668, Bellefonds, de Cr√©quy and Humi√®res were all created Marshals of France.De P√©rini, Batailles fran√ßaises, Volume IV p. 303 However, the Dutch preferred a weak Spain as a neighbour in the Spanish Netherlands, to a strong and ambitious France; with England and Sweden, they formed the Triple Alliance obliging Louis to return most of his gains in the 1668 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Angered by what he viewed as ingratitude for previous French support against Spain, Louis made preparations to invade the Netherlands. In April 1672, Turenne was appointed general en chef or senior commander of French forces in the Netherlands; this caused problems, as the convention was Marshalls did not serve under other Marshalls. Bellefonds, Humi√®res and de Cr√©quy refused to serve under Turenne, arguing that to do so would diminish their personal prestige and the position of Marshal; all three were banished to their estates, while Bellefonds also lost his position as head of the Maison du Roi. When the Franco-Dutch War began in May 1672, the French over-ran much of the Dutch Republic and initially seemed to have achieved an overwhelming victory. By late July, the Dutch position had stabilised and they gained the support of Brandenburg-Prussia, Emperor Leopold and Charles II of Spain. With new fronts opening in Spain and the Rhineland, Louis decided to withdrew from the Dutch Republic by the end of 1673.Lynn 1999, p. 117. La Hogue, June 1692; this was the final action of his military career Bellefonds and his two colleagues had been taken back into service in November 1672 and he was put in charge of operations in the Netherlands. All Dutch towns held by the French were evacuated except for Grave and Maastricht, providing him with an army of 15,000 troops. Ignoring orders to remain on the defensive, in May 1674 he attacked and captured Fort Navagne and Argenteau, Spanish-held positions on the Meuse between Maastricht and Liege. A large Allied army was based nearby, which left his force dangerously exposed; Conde managed to reinforce him first but Bellefonds was removed from command. Bellefonds coat of arms; azure, chevron d'or and three silver lozenges While he never recovered his previous office in the Maison du Roi, in 1680 he was appointed head of household or Grand Ecuyer to La Dauphine, Maria Anna of Bavaria, a position he held until her death in April 1690. In the 1683‚Äì1684 War of the Reunions, he once again commanded the French army in Catalonia and besieged the town of Girona, although he was forced to retreat in May 1684, shortly before the Truce of Ratisbon. Bellefonds had been acquainted with James II of England since the 1650s and following his exile to France in the 1688 Glorious Revolution, accompanied him on religious retreats to La Trappe Abbey. In 1690, he was nominated general of French forces fighting in the Williamite War in Ireland to restore James to his throne but the Marquis de St Ruth was selected instead and was killed at Aughrim in July 1691. In 1692, he was given command of the expeditionary corps assembled at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue to support a proposed invasion of England. This ended after an inconclusive naval battle between the French and a combined Anglo-Dutch fleet at Barfleur on 29 May; a few days later, 12 French ships that had taken refuge at La Hogue were destroyed, while French land forces failed to intervene. Clearly fearing he would be blamed, Bellefonds wrote a lengthy explanation to the naval minister, the Comte de Pontchartrain. Regardless of who was to blame, this was his final military command; he died on 4 December 1694 at the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes and buried in Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes, next to his daughter Fran√ßoise Bonne who died in 1693. His eldest son Louis-Christophe was killed at Steenkerque in 1692 and his titles and estates were inherited by his grandson, Louis-Charles Bernadin (1685‚Äì1710). Legacy Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes, where Bellefonds was buried Bellefonds was considered by contemporaries to be a man of morality but inflexible once he had decided on a course of action, which led to his banishment in 1672 and removal from command in 1674. He was known for religious piety, financing Notre-Dame-des-Anges, a convent near Rouen established in 1650 by his aunt, Laurence Gigault de Bellefonds (1610‚Äì1683). He was also associated with the abbey of Port-Royal-des-Champs, a centre of Jansenist thought, a then popular doctrine within French Catholicism controversial for its similarities to Calvinism. Finally, he was close to Jacques-B√©nigne Bossuet, Bishop to the Court at Versailles, and like him supported the decision of Louis' mistress Louise de La Valli√®re to enter a Carmelite convent in Paris in 1675. His letters to and from Louis XIV concerning the education of the Dauphin were later collected and published in Lettres sur l'√©ducation du dauphin; suivies de Lettres au mar√©chal de Belle- fonds et au roi. Introd. et notes de E. Levesque. The Rue de Bellefond in Paris is named after his daughter Marie-√âl√©onore, Abbess of nearby Montmartre Abbey, demolished in 1794.

It runs north-northeast, following Paseo del Volcan to its northern terminus at US-550 in Bernalillo. Currently it exists in two discontinuous segments: the southern segment is long, and follows Paseo del Volcan from I-40 to Paseo del Norte (NM 423) near Double Eagle II Airport. The northern section begins at Unser Boulevard in Rio Rancho and ends at US-550 in Bernalillo, which incorporates a 3.4 mile extension of Paseo del Volcan from Iris Road to US-550 that was completed in February 2011. The remaining segment from Paseo del Norte to Unser Boulevard is not yet built. While the New Mexico Department of Transportation owns the right-of-way for the unbuilt section, its completion is contingent upon future growth within Albuquerque and Rio Rancho and the availability of funding. Currently a 2-lane road, NM 347 right- of-way is 150 feet wide to accommodate expansion to a freeway, should future growth and traffic demand necessitate the construction of a freeway along the Paseo del Volcan corridor. History An environmental impact statement for the Paseo del Volcan project was approved in August 2001 by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Phase 1 of the project, a segment between Unser Blvd. and Iris Road was completed in October 2006. The road was designated as State Road 347 between I-40 and US 550 in August 2010. The Phase 2 extension eastward to US 550 was opened to traffic in February 2011. Land acquisition is currently in progress for a further extension westward from Unser Blvd. to Rainbow Blvd. In July 2011, a street west of Albuquerque also known as Paseo del Volcan was renamed Atrisco Vista Blvd. to avoid a naming conflict. Atrisco Vista Blvd. intersects I-40 at Exit 149 only east of the proposed interchange with NM 347. Interchange construction at I-40 will be Phase 3 of the project and awaits acquisition of individual private parcels along the Interstate.

Common symptoms include decreased vision and uveitis. Orbital lymphoma can be diagnosed via a biopsy of the eye and is usually treated with radiotherapy or with combination with chemotherapy. Signs and symptoms Primary visible signs of ocular lymphoma include proptosis and a visible mass in the eye. Symptoms are due to mass effect.  Pathophysiology  Recent studies have detected the presence of viral DNA in ocular lymphoma cells. This implies that pathogens play a role in ocular lymphoma. Other studies have found that the aging population, the increasing number of immunosuppressive drugs, and the AIDS epidemic have also contributed to the increased incidence of Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Ocular MALT lymphomas may also be associated with Chlamydia psittaci, although whether or not this is the case is still debated. Follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and natural killer cell lymphoma have also been reported to affect the orbit. Diagnosis Classification There are two types of ocular lymphomas: intraocular lymphomas and adnexal lymphomas. An intraocular lymphoma occurs within the eye, while an adnexal lymphoma occurs outside, but adjoined to the eye.  Intraocular lymphoma  There are two main types of intraocular lymphomas: primary central nervous system involvement (PCNSL) and primary central nervous system with ocular involvement (PCNSLO). The difference between PCNSL and PCNSLO is that PNSCL involves the central nervous system, while PCNSLO does not. 56-86% of orbital lymphomas are classified PCNSL and 15-25% are classified PCNSLO. PCNSLO is common in people who are severely immunosuppressed. Symptoms of this form of ocular lymphoma include painless decreased vision, sensitivity to light, a red eye, and floaters. Diagnosis is difficult due to its gradual onset and the fact that the symptoms are the same as other diseases. PCNSLO is usually bilateral, but sometimes grows unevenly. Like other metastatic tumors of the eye, it is usually confined to the choroid.  Treatment  Radiotherapy is the most effective treatment for local disease either as the sole treatment for low-grade lymphoma or in combination with chemotherapy for intermediate- and high-grade lymphoma. Radiotherapy dose in range of 30-45 Gy administered in fractions are advised in treating the local orbital lymphomas.  Epidemiology  Orbital lymphoma accounts for 55% of malignant orbital tumors in adults. In one study, this was 10% of patients presenting with orbital tumors or similar lesions. Orbital lymphoma is more prevalent in Asia and Europe than in the United States.

The programmes concentrate on the development of a European Research Area, and in particular, improving the ability of European researchers to access the European supercomputing infrastructure provided by the programmes' partners. The programme is currently in its third iteration, known as \\"HPC-Europa3\\" or \\"HPCE3\\", and fully titled the \\"Transnational Access Programme for a Pan-European Network of HPC Research Infrastructures and Laboratories for scientific computing\\". History HPC-Europa1 The original HPC-Europa programme (HPC-Europa1), operated between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2007 under the EU's sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, (FP6). The programme had the goals of improving trans-national access to high-performance computing infrastructure for European researchers by the funding of visitations, creating new methods for accessing the resources of grid computing systems, and devising new methods of measuring the performance of research programmes being undertaken on supercomputers. The HPC-Europa1 programme had a budget of 14.2 million euros, of which approximately 13 million euros came from the EU budget. An initial tranche of funding of 1.6 million euros (of which 1.5 million was from the EU budget) was provided between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2008. HPC-Europa2 The second HPC- Europa programme (HPC-Europa2) operated between 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2012, under the seventh Framework Programme (FP7). Continuing on its goal of improving access to pan-European supercomputing infrastracutre, the programme also had the goals of developing programming models for HPC on Massively Parallel Architectures, to aid visiting researchers with the development and parallelization of their applications, and the development of data-grid tools for Scientific Data Services. For the first time in the HPC-Europa programme \\"virtual visits\\" were offered as part of HPC-Europa2, in which researchers were able to remotely access the HPC facilities from their institutes. However, the final report on the programme reports low up take on this offer, speculating that this was not what researchers wanted from the HPC-Europa programme. The budget for HPC-Europa2 was 13 million euros, of which 9.5 million euros came from the EU budget. Current programme: HPC-Europa3 The current HPC-Europa programme, HPC-Europa3, is fully funded under the EU's eighth Framework Programme, better known as Horizon 2020, with a budget of 9.2 million euros. Furthering its original goal of funding visitations of researchers to the 8 supercomputing facilities of the programme partners, HPC- Europa3 identified the Baltic and the Western Balkans as two regions to aid in improving the access of their researchers to European supercomputing infrastructure. The programme has also extended its aims to encouraging small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to use supercomputing infrastructure. The programme also focuses on external co-operation with other European HPC projects, such as PRACE and ETP4HPC.

Gaspar de Vigodet (also called Gaspar de Bigod√©) (1747‚Äì1834) was a Spanish military officer with French roots who served as last Royalist Governor of Montevideo. Biography De Vigodet participated in the Great Siege of Gibraltar in 1783 and fought in the War of the Pyrenees in 1793, where he was promoted to Mariscal de campo. He was in command of a division in the lost battles of Almonacid and Ocana (1809). By the end of 1811, he was made Governor of Montevideo, to stop the advance of the Independentist rebels forces of R√≠o de la Plata. By October 1812 the entire region was under control of the rebels, except for the city of Montevideo itself, which was besieged. On December 31, Vigodet broke out of the city but was defeated in the Battle of Cerrito. Supplied from over the sea, the city still held out until May 17, 1814, when the naval victories of Admiral William Brown, cut off the supply route and the city faced starvation. By the end of June, Vigodet was forced to surrender Montevideo to General Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear. The following years he stayed in R√≠o de Janeiro, where he tried to take revenge on Alvear, who was also exiled to this city, due to political differences. In 1820 he returned to Spain where he became capit√°n general of Castille, and member of the Liberal Regency during the Trienio Liberal. When King Ferdinand VII of Spain was restored in 1823, de Vigodet went into exile in France, from where he could only return in 1834, after the death of the King.

It is also used to inhibit potato sprouting and for sucker control in tobacco. Chlorpropham is available in emulsifiable concentrate and liquid formulations. Chlorpropham is within the maximum residue limit regulation in Germany germination inhibitors approved for the treatment of potatoes for the purpose of preservation after harvest. Chlorpropham products are approved as a germination inhibitor for potatoes in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Chlorpropham is approved for use as a plant regulator and herbicide only on potatoes in the United States.http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text- idx?SID=211601858f4f236cff4d417b617de968&mc;=true&node;=se40.24.180_1181&rgn;=div8  Uses  When it is used as an Anti Sprouting Agent for potatoes, the formulation is based on HN formulation, Hot Fogging. For herbicide, an EC formulation is used so that it is dissolvable in water for spray in the field. Toxicity Chlorpropham displays a low level toxicity profile, with no signs of acute toxicity after exposure of less than 1000 mg/kg/day. Long term exposure at high doses (‚â• 1000 mg/kg/day) could cause reduction of body weight gain, decrease in hematocrit and hemoglobin, and increase in blood reticulocytes. Regarding the carcinogenic risk, chlorpropham is classified by the EPA as group E (non-carcinogenic). One of its metabolites is 3-chloroaniline. The acceptable daily intake ranges from 0.03 mg/kg (FAO 2001) to 0.05 mg/Kg (EPA 1996 and EC 2003). Stability Chlorpropham is partially degraded in the environment under aerobic conditions (15% to 30% after 100 days) and partially hydrolysed in water solution (90% after 59 to 130 days). A study of the stability of chlorpropham in potatoes (estimated concentration of chlorpropham: 1.8 to 7.6 mg/kg at 10 days post-application) revealed that mean concentration of chlorpropham in the tuber decreased spontaneously by 24% and 42% at 28 days and 65 days postapplication respectively. The study also showed that peeling removed 91-98% and washing 33-47%. Residues of chlorpropham were detected in the boiled potatoes, in the boiling water, in the French-fried potatoes and in the frying oil. According to this study, the theoretical dose for a 20 kg infant eating 100g of crude-peeled tuber would be 0.00018 to 0.00342 mg/kg.

Early life Louis Lobong Lojore was born between 1962-1965. He belongs to the Toposa ethnic group, and is from Kapoeta East County. Lojore became a Brigadier General in the SPLA during the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983‚Äì2005). He was also Secretary of the Southern Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Agency (SSRRA) for Greater Kapoeta, Commissioner for greater Kapoeta and Deputy Governor for greater Equatoria. When the civil war ended, Lobong was appointed Chief of the National Intelligence and Security Service for the Southern Sector of South Sudan. He was the SPLM State Chairman for Eastern Equatoria. In 2005 he was a candidate for governorship of Eastern Equatoria State, but Aloisio Emor Ojetuk was elected. It was said that Lobong failed to gain support for his candidacy from the chiefs in the State Conference in Chukudum in June 2005 due to dissatisfaction over his failure to prevent Toposa of Namorunyang from raiding and destabilizing the Lauro and Lotukei areas of Budi County. Lobong was appointed chairman of the Southern Sudan Peace Commission. In October 2009, responding to the recent wave of ethnic violence, Lobong called for the government to take harsh measures to deter others from causing problems. Eastern Equatoria governor Lobong took his oath of office on 19 May 2010 in a ceremony at the Eastern Equatoria State Legislative Assembly Hall in Torit, taking over from caretaker Governor Johnson Juma Okot. He promised to work towards development of the state and to promote peace between the different communities. On 9 June 2010 he appointed his cabinet of state ministers, and also named the Commissioners for the eight counties of the state. After the successful referendum in January 2011 in which 99.95% of votes were for south Sudan secession, Lobong was visited by a delegation of women from all eight counties of Eastern Equatoria. He recognized the great contribution that women had made during the civil war and subsequent struggle leading up to the referendum, and called on them to help build peaceful ties between the different ethnic groups in the state. In March 2011 Lobong said that claims that rebels loyal to George Athor had invaded Eastern Equatoria from Jonglei State were untrue. He said that Athor was using scare tactics to gain publicity, and said the people of Greater Equatoria were loyal to the democratic Government of South Sudan. In April 2011 Lobong said that at least six hundred thousand people were starving in Eastern Equatoria state due to a poor harvest in 2010. He called on NGOs to supply food and seed to the affected communities. He also asked NGOs to declare their budgets and objectives. This was needed to prevent corruption and so the government could direct its budget to unfunded areas. In May 2011 Lobong announced that it would be illegal to carry arms in public places, and that this ban applied even to off-duty security personnel such as soldiers and policemen. That month Lobong said that he would consult with President Salva Kiir Mayardit about solving to a dispute between the Lopit and Pari communities of Lafon-Lopa County over which community should supply the county commissioner. He said that he would discuss adding more counties with the President. Each of the 16 new counties would be more ethnically homogeneous. This runs counter to recommendations of a report issued in 2010 to which Lobong's Southern Sudan Peace Commission contributed. The report found that decentralization and division of administrations along ethnic lines could be aggravating tensions. During the July 2011 independence celebrations, Lobong urged citizens to play an active role in suppressing cattle rustling, which he described as the biggest challenge to security in South Sudan, one of the poorest countries in the world. He called on them to develop a culture of hard work and to send their children to school. Lobong also called for cordial relations with neighboring countries, including Ethiopia. He said, \\"It is time for us to contribute at regional and international levels for the stability not only of the region but of the world. We need peace among ourselves and our sister countries\\".

Synopsis The story begins in the mind of Cashril Plus, a twelve-year-old animator and son of graffiti artist Faith47. Through Cashril's eyes, we see his mother paint the streets and forgotten townships haloing Cape Town. Weaving through the lives of Faith47, Warongx (afro-blues), Emile Jansen (hip hop), Sweat.X (glam rap), Blaq Pearl (spoken word) and Mthetho (opera), the film culminates in an intertwined story. Born into separate areas of a formerly-segregated South Africa, the artists recraft history‚Äîand the impacts of apartheid‚Äîin their own artistic languages. The lens reveals the impulse behind the artists‚Äô social consciousness, the individuals‚Äô eccentricities, and each creator's unique form of expression. Diving into the current of subversive art which fuels South Africa's many clashing and merging cultures, The Creators brings into focus the invisible connections among strangers' disparate lives‚Äîand the creative expression used to traverse the divide. The result is an intimate, refreshing, and deeply revealing portrait of those remolding the legacy of apartheid.  Cast   Artists   Faith47  A street artist illuminating the forgotten townships haloing South Africa's cities, Faith is a subversive activist creating for public art and a mother painting a new world for her twelve-year-old son. Faith uses the 1955 ANC document, \\"The Freedom Charter,\\" to inspire murals questioning whether South Africa's post-apartheid government kept its central goals after ascending to power. Painting in townships with levels of violence surpassing all of sub-Saharan Africa, Faith infiltrates the culture on a level that allows her to merge seamlessly with the country's impoverished majority. The film views Faith through the eyes of her son, aka Cashril Plus: South Africa's youngest genius.  Warongx  An Afro-blues artist originally from the rural Eastern Cape, Ongx was awarded first place in a national music competition in 2007, winning a record deal with Africa's largest music production company. When the deal did not turn out as promised, Ongx must play music on the streets, wash dishes and connect illegal electricity in the townships in order to make ends meet. Fighting tooth and nail to sustain himself through his passion, Ongx puts a human face on a devastating social reality in a country with roughly 40% unemployed citizens. Ongx and his best friend Wara form the band Warongx, singing in their traditional language of Xhosa while the world around them turns increasingly towards English pop music. Demonstrating pride in traditional African culture, Ongx and Wara expose the schism between their people's roots and an increasingly westernized media landscape.  Mthetho Mapoyi  Before leaving his family, Mthetho's father left behind one opera CD, which Mthetho listened to repeatedly while growing up. Soon, Mthetho discovered that he could sing Pavarotti's arias by memory. Mthetho used his natural talent to teach his friends and support his family until his mother's death from HIV/AIDS. From the age of 9 years old, Mthetho sang along with his other friends Athenkosi Jaza, Thulani Myeki, Mzwamadoda Nkanunu and Elvis Seekoei. Later, he then fell into a pattern of crime, enduring multiple stabbings and a burning in gang wars and chance incidents. With a knife scar stretching the length of his cheek, Mthetho is now pulling himself out of gang life, using opera to uplift his mind and support his family. A Dutch pianist Derk Blaisse found Mthetho and his friends on the street and helped Mthetho apply for training opportunities. Derk Blaisse, Mthetho Mapoyi and Athenkosi performed together at markets and Blaisse's restaurant The Crypt. Mthetho was featured on the BBC 7 January 2013 (the BBC spelled his name 'Mthetho Maphoyi') https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-20940136 and gave a TedxTeen talk in early 2012 (TedxTeen spelled his name 'Mteto Maphoyi').  Emile Jansen  As an MC, B-boy and breakdancer from the seminal hip hop group Black Noise, Emile united a generation of youth during the fall of apartheid in the tumultuous eighties and nineties. Emile participated in anti-apartheid protests and school boycotts during his youth, getting shot at by police and witnessing the death of friends fighting to overthrow South Africa's oppressive government. Emile now practices more subversive activism in his community, creating a conscious culture through breakdancing workshops, events and b-boy competitions.  Blaq Pearl  The younger sister of Mr. Devious, a hip hop activist killed amidst gang warfare in their hometown of Mitchell's Plain, Blaq Pearl's life is imbued with the struggle between a violent environment and a peaceful core. As a spoken word artist and performer, Blaq Pearl worked in a prison teaching creative writing to inmates where her brother taught before his untimely death. The same prison released her brother's murderer just months after his incarceration. The killer now lives in the neighborhood next to Blaq Pearl's family home. In the ten years prior to 2007, four times as many people were murdered in South Africa than Americans killed during the entire Vietnam War. In a country where violence threatens physically and psychologically, Blaq Pearl's poetry meditates her situation at a level free from the chaos of the streets.  Sweat.X  \\"Spoek Mathambo is a slippery post-apartheid glam-rap prince from Soweto who is descended from distant African royalty, or Jewish, or both\\" (Fader Magazine). Spoek is one half of Sweat.X, a radical black/white duo from Soweto and Pretoria ‚Äî arguably polar opposite locations in the world's most polarized economy. Sweat.x exemplifies the growing population of South Africa that is tired of stale, on-the-sleeve activism.

Etymology The Yeghrdut Monastery takes its name from the \\"yeghird\\" herb which grows in the area. The monastery, was originally called Myuronaman or Shish-Yougho.Official site of Armenian Holy Apostolic Church about Yeghrdut abbey In Armenian, Myuron or Meron means myrrh, and Myuronaman translates to container of a myrrh. The Armenian Apostolic Church for many centuries used myrrh to prepare the sacramental chrism for christening and funeral rites. Thus the name Yeghrdut means the place of myrrh containers. Yeghrdut monastery has 2 other names: # Surb Hovannes Vank (, Monastery of Saint John). # Artzvaberi Surb Nshan (, Saint Sign Brought by the Eagle). The exterior The Yeghrdut Monastery consisted of four churches: * Surb Hovannes Church (main church in the center) * Surb Astvatzatzin (adjoining from south) * Surb Grigor Lusavorich (adjoining from northwest) * Surb Stepanos (adjoining from south to Grigor Lusavorich Church) The Yeghrudt Monastery was a structure similar in size to the Saint Karapet Monastery. History According to Abbot Zenob Glak, several Christian relics were found in the Yeghrdut Woods in Taron district of the Kingdom of Armenia, then under the patronage of King Tiridates. It was at that place from 283-292 A.D that the Yeghrdut Monastery was constructed.Illustrated dictionary of Taron- Turuberan's monasteries, Eprikyan S., 1953 In the Middle Ages, the Yeghrdut Monastery became a center of the Yeghrduts' order and had accumulated rich reserves of myrrh. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Yeghrdut was one of Armenia's centers of education. The Matenadaran repository contains at least twenty hand written books originating from the Yeghrdut Monastery. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the monastery had a prestigious school and wide manors. In 1650 the priest Grigor Mshetsi (Gregory from Moush) renovated the Yeghrdut Monastery and added a new two-story building and in 1828 Father Ghazar (Lazarus) added a bell tower. In 1866 an earthquake damaged the monastery; But in the 19th century, the monastery was repaired again and by 1870, due to the efforts of Catholicos Garegin Srvandztyan, the school re-opened. In 1909 the school educated many pupils, including forty orphans. The Yeghrdut Monastery was damaged during the Armenian genocide in 1915 during which time many Armenians were killed by the Turks in the Yeghrdut monastery. Legends According to popular belief, the Kingdom of Armenia has an eden-like woodland named Yeghrdut in the Taron district, west of the Mu≈ü Valley. It is believed that old men who come there from Mu≈ü valley and spend some time in that corner of unearthly beauty would become twenty years younger. Current condition The monastery was completely destroyed by the Turkish military years later. There were still remains noted in 1983.

Legislative history  On 5 July 2010 a private bill was introduced into the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, sponsored by Knesset members Ze'ev Elkin and Dalia Itzik and a group of members from Likud, Shas, Yisrael Beiteinu, United Torah Judaism and the National Union. The bill distinguished between three types of boycotts: a boycott imposed by a resident or citizen of Israel, a boycott imposed by a foreign resident or citizen, and a boycott imposed by a foreign political entity through a law enacted by the foreign political entity. The proposal stated that such a boycott is a civil wrong and a criminal offense punishable by a fine. After debate in a Knesset committee, the bill was changed to remove any criminality, i.e. it only provides for civil penalties, and to allow it to apply to anyone regardless of the nationality of the person who publicizes the boycott. The revised bill was published on 2 March 2011. It was approved by the Knesset on 12 July 2011 with the vote 47-38, with opposition factions voting against the bill. Netanyahu and another 10 ministers, including Defence Minister Ehud Barak, were absent during the voting. Opponents of the law argued that it violated the principle of freedom of expression. The supporters of the bill, led by Netanyahu, contended that the law doesn't and only prevents harmful actions being taken against the State of Israel or its citizens.  The law  The law states that individuals or organizations who publicize a call for an economic, cultural or academic boycott against a person or entity merely because of its affiliation to the State of Israel and/or to an Israeli institute and/or to a specific region under Israeli control, may be sued civilly, in tort, by a party claiming that it might be damaged by such a boycott.unofficial translation by The Association of Civil Rights in IsraelThe Anti-Boycott Law: Questions and Answers updated 17 July 2011Israel's New Boycott Law published in http://inewp.com The law also allows Israeli authorities to deny benefits from individuals or organizations ‚Äì such as tax exemptions or participation in government contracts ‚Äì if they have publicized a call to boycott and/or if they have obligated to participate in a boycott. All sections took effect on 13 July 2011, except for section 4 (withdrawing state benefits) which took effect on 11 October 2011. The law was temporarily frozen by the Supreme Court between 2012 and 2015. In the 2015 landmark decision Avneri v. The Knesset, the Supreme Court of Israel unanimously struck down section 2c of the law (which permitted the imposition of compensation payments even if no damages were proven), ruling that it was unconstitutional. The law's other provisions were upheld by the Court in majority decisions ranging from 9‚Äì0 to 5‚Äì4.  Reaction to the law  The law has been condemned as a violation of freedom of expression, \\"deeply undemocratic\\", widely criticised in the Israeli media, and \\"three dozen\\" eminent law professors have described it as unconstitutional. After the law was enacted, a number of Israeli civil rights groups declared that they would legally challenge the law by petitioning the Supreme Court of Israel. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel claimed that the law is \\"unconstitutional and anti-democratic\\" and sets a bad precedent. Gush Shalom, Adalah, Physicians for Human Rights, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel and the Coalition of Women for Peace ‚Äì said that they would join legal challenges.

Data from Mariner 10 led to its discovery in 1974; the spacecraft measured the field's strength as 1.1% that of Earth's magnetic field. The origin of the magnetic field can be explained by dynamo theory. The magnetic field is strong enough near the bow shock to slow the solar wind, which induces a magnetosphere. Strength The magnetic field is about 1.1% as strong as Earth's. At the Hermean equator, the relative strength of the magnetic field is around 300 nT, which is weaker than that of Jupiter's moon Ganymede. Mercury's magnetic field is weaker than Earth's because its core had cooled and solidified more quickly than Earth's. Although Mercury's magnetic field is much weaker than Earth's magnetic field, it is still strong enough to deflect the solar wind, inducing a magnetosphere. Because Mercury's magnetic field is weak while the interplanetary magnetic field it interacts with in its orbit is relatively strong, the solar wind dynamic pressure at Mercury's orbit is also three times larger than at Earth. Whether the magnetic field changed to any significant degree between the Mariner 10 mission and the MESSENGER mission remains an open question. A 1988 J.E.P. Connerney and N.F. Ness review of the Mariner magnetic data noted eight different papers in which were offered no less than fifteen different mathematical models of the magnetic field derived from spherical harmonic analysis of the two close Mariner 10 flybys, with reported centered magnetic dipole moments ranging from 136 to 350 nT-RM3 (RM is a Mercury radius of 2436 km). In addition they pointed out that \\"estimates of the dipole obtained from bow shock and/or magnetopause positions (only) range from approximately 200 nT-RM3 (Russell 1977) to approximately 400 nT-RM3 (Slavin and Holzer 1979b).\\" They concluded that \\"the lack of agreement among models is due to fundamental limitations imposed by the spatial distribution of available observations.\\" Anderson et al. 2011, using high-quality MESSENGER data from many orbits around Mercury ‚Äì as opposed to just a few high-speed flybys ‚Äì found that the dipole moment is 195 ¬± 10 nT-RM3.  Discovery  Data from Mariner 10 led to the discovery of Mercury's magnetic field. Before 1974, it was thought that Mercury could not generate a magnetic field because of its relatively small diameter and lack of an atmosphere. However, when Mariner 10 made a fly-by of Mercury (somewhere around April 1974), it detected a magnetic field that was about 1/100th the total magnitude of Earth's magnetic field. But these passes provided weak constraints on the magnitude of the intrinsic magnetic field, its orientation and its harmonic structure, in part because the coverage of the planetary field was poor and because of the lack of concurrent observations of the solar wind number density and velocity. Since the discovery, Mercury's magnetic field has received a great deal of attention, primarily because of Mercury's small size and slow 59-day-long rotation. The magnetic field itself is thought to originate from the dynamo mechanism, although this is uncertain as yet.  Origins  The origins of the magnetic field can be explained by the dynamo theory; i.e., by the convection of electrically conductive molten iron in the planet's outer core. A dynamo is generated by a large iron core that has sunk to a planet's center of mass, has not cooled over the years, an outer core that has not been completely solidified, and circulates around the interior. Before the discovery of its magnetic field in 1974, it was thought that because of Mercury's small size, its core had cooled over the years. There are still difficulties with this dynamo theory, including the fact that Mercury has a slow, 59-day-long rotation that could not have made it possible to generate a magnetic field. This dynamo is probably weaker than Earth's because it is driven by thermo-compositional convection associated with inner core solidification. The thermal gradient at the core‚Äìmantle boundary is subadiabatic, and hence the outer region of the liquid core is stably stratified with the dynamo operating only at depth, where a strong field is generated. Because of the planet's slow rotation, the resulting magnetic field is dominated by small-scale components that fluctuate quickly with time. Due to the weak internally generated magnetic field it is also possible that the magnetic field generated by the magnetopause currents exhibits a negative feedback on the dynamo processes, thereby causing the total field to weaken. Magnetic poles and magnetic measurement Mercury's magnetic field tends to be stronger at the equator than at other areas of Mercury. Like Earth's, Mercury's magnetic field is tilted, meaning that the magnetic poles are not located in the same area as the geographic poles. As a result of the north- south asymmetry in Mercury's internal magnetic field, the geometry of magnetic field lines is different in Mercury's north and south polar regions. In particular, the magnetic \\"polar cap\\" where field lines are open to the interplanetary medium is much larger near the south pole. This geometry implies that the south polar region is much more exposed than in the north to charged particles heated and accelerated by solar wind‚Äìmagnetosphere interactions. The strength of the quadrupole moment and the tilt of the dipole moment are completely unconstrained. There have been various ways that Mercury's magnetic field has been measured. In general, the inferred equivalent internal dipole field is smaller when estimated on the basis of magnetospheric size and shape (~150‚Äì200 nT R3). Recent Earth-based radar measurements of Mercury's rotation revealed a slight rocking motion explaining that Mercury's core is at least partially molten, implying that iron \\"snow\\" helps maintain the magnetic field. The MESSENGER spacecraft was expected to make more than 500 million measurements of Mercury's magnetic field using its sensitive magnetometer. During its first 88 days in orbit around Mercury, MESSENGER made six different sets of magnetic field measurements as it passed through Mercury's magnetopause.  Field characteristics  The MESSENGER spacraft noted that Mercury's magnetic field is responsible for several magnetic \\"tornadoes\\" ‚Äì twisted bundles of magnetic fields connecting the planetary field to interplanetary space ‚Äì that are some 800 km wide or a third the total radius of the planet. Scientists noted that Mercury's magnetic field can be extremely \\"leaky,\\" because MESSENGER encountered magnetic \\"tornadoes\\" during its second fly-by on October 6, 2008, which could possibly replenish the atmosphere (or \\"exosphere\\", as referred to by astronomers). When Mariner 10 made a fly-by of Mercury back in 1974, its signals measured the bow shock, the entrance and exit from the magnetopause, and that the magnetospheric cavity is ~20 times smaller than Earth's, all of which had presumably decayed during the MESSENGER flyby. Even though the field is just over 1% as strong as Earth's, its detection by Mariner 10 was taken by some scientists as an indication that Mercury's outer core was still liquid, or at least partially liquid with iron and possibly other metals. BepiColombo mission BepiColombo is a joint mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to Mercury. It is launched in October 2018. Part of its mission objectives will be to elucidate Mercury's magnetic field.

Opened in 1881, it forms part of the Cagliari‚ÄìGolfo Aranci railway, the main railway line in Sardinia. Between 1883 and 2000, the station was also the junction of a short branch line to Olbia's ferry pier, at Isola Bianca. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). Train services to and from the station are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Olbia railway station is situated in Via Giacomo Pala, at the northwestern edge of the old town. History The station was opened on 15 March 1881 as the main station of Terranova Pausania, which was then the name of present-day Olbia. Its opening coincided with the inauguration of the Monti‚ÄìTerranova Pausania section of the Cagliari‚ÄìGolfo Aranci railway. The passenger building viewed from the station yard. Terranova Pausania was intended to be the penultimate station on the line, which, on 1 May of that year, arrived at the designated terminus of Terranova Isola Bianca, in front of the docks of the town's port. However, in the meantime it had been decided to move the docking of ships passengers to nearby Golfo Aranci, and so the line was extended by constructing a new trunk route from Terranova Pausania. The extension was opened in 1883. The opening of this route created a bifurcation of the line a short distance from the station. To the west, the new main line continued to Rudalza, another stop within the municipality, and Golfo Aranci, while to the east, the established line, now a branch, headed to Isola Bianca. A few decades later, the port of Olbia once again became the ferry port. A new rail link from Terranova Pausania station to the new Isola Bianca pier was opened on 28 January 1920, just weeks after responsibility for management of the station had passed to the FS. The station, which took its present name of Olbia in 1939, continued to be the terminus of most trains in the years to come, including the Freccia Sarda, the Cagliari-Olbia express that for decades linked its termini with the regional capital of Gallura. In the 1990s, with the closure of the railway station at Olbia Isola Bianca, the branch that led from Olbia station to the ferry terminal and its formation was largely dismantled following work affecting the road network near the port. However, the station at Rudalza remains open. Features The main platform and station yard. The passenger building is a two-storey rectangular structure made of red brick, with stone quoins and a tiled roof. Its ground floor exterior has an all round white rendered finish. The station yard has a track in front of the passenger building, and three other tracks used for passenger services. About from the passenger building, towards Cagliari, is the station's locomotive depot, adjacent to which is also a group of tracks for freight service. A new station is expected to be constructed in future near the present freight terminal, to replace the current passenger building. Passenger and train movements In 2007, the station had, on average, 442.5 passenger movements each day. Trains link the station with Cagliari, Oristano, Chilivani, Sassari, Porto Torres and Golfo Aranci. The station is always attended, and train movements are managed on site by the station manager. Interchange An ASPO bus terminal in front of the station provides urban bus links, including Olbia's ferry port at Isola Bianca. Not far from the station is a bus stop for ARST suburban buses to surrounding areas.

He partially earned his living as a worker in coal and sulfide mining. Greiling did research in the field of agricultural microbiology. He worked at the Technische Hochschule in Hannover, as an assistant, as well as for the Hamburgisches Welt-Wirtschafts-Archiv (Hamburg archive of world economy).

He predicted that from 1990 to 1995, there would begin systematic international efforts to mitigate climate change and that, shortly after the turn of the millennium, there would for the first time come about a sudden and crisis-laden shortage of the international supply of petroleum. World population would balance out at about nine billion, rather earlier than later in the 21st century. During the 21st century, mankind would succeed to cooperate internationally in shifting to biological raw materials. This and big undertakings to humidify the Sahara, Turkestan and further regions of the Earth would make it possible to feed ten billion people with comparative ease.

Early Life in Switzerland Deschwanden was born in Stans, in Canton Nidwalden, the son of Johann Baptist Deschwanden and Regina Luthiger. He was Roman Catholic and remained a bachelor. Artistic Training He studied drawing with Louis Victor von Deschwanden, Johann Kaspar Moos (1825‚Äì1826) in Zug, Daniel Albert Freudweiler and Johann Caspar Schinz in Zurich (1827), then he enrolled in the Munich Academy (1830). After going to Lausanne to learn French (1835‚Äì1836), he returned home. From 1838 to 1840, he studied at the Florentine Academy where he won first prize for an oil of a male nude. In Florence he was particularly drawn to the works of Fra Angelico. Religious Painter After a meeting with the Nazarene artist Friedrich Overbeck, he made a conscious decision to devote his life's work to religious painting. After returning to Switzerland finally, he received his first order from an ecclesiastical source, altarpieces for the chapel of St. Peter in Lucerne. In 1842 he met members of the D√ºsseldorf school of painters and became interested in the work of the Austrian artist Eduard von Steinle, a fashionable religious painter and a Nazarene. In 1845 he discovered in the church of St. Louis in Munich murals by Peter von Cornelius, a classical artist who had been influenced by the Nazarenes, and visited one of his pupils the portrait painter and history painter Wilhelm von Kaulbach. Though himself a portraitist of talent, he devoted more of his time to religious paintings, creating a style of simple understandable compositions, expressive figures and a smooth technique. Deschwanden is believed to have painted over 2000 works, amongst which the greatest number are altarpieces, and for nearly forty years he dominated religious painting in Switzerland. His works were well received in Catholic and Protestant circles. Consequently, he sent his works all over the world, and examples may be found in churches in Annapolis, Maryland and Covington, Kentucky. His work was widely reproduced in pious chromolithographic reproductions. Pupils Deschwanden is known to have taken many pupils, amongst whom were the fellow artist from Stans Adalbert Baggenstos, and the Swiss-born American painter Adolfo M√ºller-Ury in whose arms he is documented as dying in February 1881. Deschwanden Memorial In the front garden of the former Nidwaldner Kantonalbank in the centre of Stans is a monument by the Swiss sculptor Auguste Stanser Blaesi (1903‚Äì1979) that was erected in memory of Deschwanden in the autumn of 1933.

Life Early life and education Rossi was born on 8 March 1762 at Nottingham, where his father Ananso, an Italian from Siena, was a quack doctor According to some sources the family later moved to Mountsorrel in Leicestershire, but by 1776, they were living at 9, Haymarket, in London, where the sculptor Giovanni Battista Locatelli, who had just arrived from Italy, came to lodge with them. Some time later, when Locatelli had moved on, and was occupying premises in Union Street, near the Middlesex Hospital, Rossi became his pupil. On completing his apprenticeship he remained with his master for wages of 18 shillings a week, until he found more lucrative employment at Coade and Seeley's artificial stone works at Lambeth. Rossi entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1781. He won the silver medal in November of that year, and in 1784 the gold medal for a group showing Venus conducting Helen to Paris. In 1785 he won the travelling studentship, and went to Rome for three years, during which he executed a Mercury in marble, and a reclining figure of Eve. Porcelain and artificial stone By 1788, following his return from Italy, he was modelling figures for the Derby porcelain factory; his name is recorded in connection with figures ordered by the clockmaker Benjamin Vulliamy, some of them based on Vulliamy's own drawings. In around 1790 he went into business in partnership with John Bingley, a London mason, producing work in a form of terracotta or artificial stone. Their works included the statues of Music and Dancing for the Assembly Rooms at Leicester (1796). Rossi later told Joseph Farington that he had lost a large amount money through this enterprise. The partnership with Bingley was formally dissolved in December 1800. Between 1798 and 1810 Rossi leased premises in Marylebone Park (an area which later became Regent's Park), next to those of James Wyatt. They were described in the St Marylebone rate books as consisting of \\"A Cottage, Artificial Stone Manufactory and Stable etc.\\" In 1800 Rossi made an artificial stone folly in the form of a \\"Hindu temple\\" at Melchet Park, near Romsey to the designs of Thomas Daniell. It was built a tribute to Warren Hastings, and contained his bust, rising out of a lotus flower, on a pedestal. In 1800-2 he again used artificial stone for the colossal seated figure of Minerva for the dome of Liverpool Town Hall. Royal Academy Rossi became an associate of the Royal Academy in 1798, and a full academician in 1802. His diploma work, a marble bust of George Dance (1827), is still in the possession of the Academy. Monuments in St Paul's During the early years of the 19th century Rossi won several prestigious commissions for monuments to military and naval heroes to be set up in St. Paul's Cathedral, including those to Captain Robert Faulkner (1803), Marquis Cornwallis (1811), Lord Rodney(1811‚Äì15) and General Le Marchant (1812). Some of these were elaborate compositions in the grand manner; Cornwallis stands on a pedestal above the three figures representing Britannia and the rivers Begareth and Ganges, denoting the British empire in Asia. In the monument to Captain Faulkner, Neptune is seated on a rock, in the act of catching the naked figure of a dying sailor, while Victory is about to crown him with laurel. Lord Rodney is represented with allegorical figures of Fame and History.. Dates from Among those working on these commissions in the studio were a young J. G. Bubb.James George Bubb - A Biographical Dictionary of Sculptors in Britain, 1660-1851, Henry Moore Foundation website Architectural sculpture Caryatids, St Pancras New Church, London In 1809 Rossi worked with John Flaxman on two friezes for the facade of the Covent Garden Theatre. He carved one, of Ancient Drama, from a model by Flaxman. For the other, of Modern Drama, he worked from Flaxman's drawings, making a model himself, before carving it in stone. For the south wing of the theatre, he made a seven-foot high statue of Tragedy as a pendant to Flaxman's Comedy. With his son Henry, Rossi was contracted to make the door surrounds, capitals, and other terracotta architectural decorations for William and Henry William Inwood's Greek revival St Pancras New Church (1819‚Äì22). They were paid ¬£4300 for the work. A contemporary report described the terracotta used for the capitals as \\"a modern composition of Mr. Rossi's invention, which it is hoped will rival in firmness and durability the same description of material of the ancients\\". The decorations included two sets of caryatids. Modelled on those at the Erechtheum in Athens, they were built up in sections cemented around structural cast-iron columns. Elgin Marbles In 1816 Rossi was one of the experts questioned by a select committee of the House of Commons enquiring into whether the government should purchase the sculptures from the Parthenon then in the possession of Lord Elgin. He told the committee that they were the best sculptures he had ever seen, superior both to the Apollo Belvedere and the Laoco√∂n. Later years Rossi owned a large house in Lisson Grove.In the Royal Academy catalogues his address is given as 21 Lisson Grove from 1810 and \\"New Road and Lisson Grove\\" from 1819. See By 1817 his prosperity had declined, and he rented out part of it to the painter Benjamin Robert Haydon, who was then temporarily solvent.O'Keefe 2009, p.177 Haydon was to remain Rossi's tenant until his imprisonment for debt in 1823.O'Keefe 2009, p.234 In 1818 he went into partnership with his former student J. G. Bubb to provide a large number of sculptures for the new Customs House in London for which they used a composition material of their own design, a form of terracotta, but within six years the badly-constructed building had been demolished. During the 1820s Rossi again received some substantial commissions. He made another monument for St Paul's Cathedral, this time to Lord Heathfield(1823‚Äì5). The Earl of Egremont commissioned Rossi to execute several works for Petworth, including Celadon and Amelia (c.1821) and the British Pugilist or Athleta Britannicus (1828), a statue of a boxer, almost two metres tall, carved from a single piece of marble. He also executed a statue of the poet Thomson for Sir Robert Peel. A bronze bust of James Wyatt and an artificial stone one of Edward Thurlow are in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. The Prince Regent appointed Rossi his sculptor, and employed him in the decoration of Buckingham Palace, where he made chimneypieces, a frieze of the Seasons to his own design, and others friezes to the designs of John Flaxman. He also made sculpture for the Marble Arch, originally built as an entrance to the palace. When the planned height of the arch was reduced, some of Rossi's work became surplus to requirements, and was instead adapted for use on the new National Gallery. Rossi was also sculptor in ordinary to William IV. In later life he suffered from ill-health and financial difficulties. He did not exhibit at the academy after 1834, and in 1835 he exhibited the works which remained at his studio in Lisson Grove prior to their sale by auction. He retired from the Royal Academy with a pension shortly before his death at St John's Wood on 21 February 1839. An obituary in the Art-Union noted \\" Mr Rossi has bequeathed to his family nothing but his fame\\". He married twice and had eight children by each wife. He was interred in the burial ground of St James's Church, Piccadilly, which was located some way from the church, beside Hampstead Road, Camden, London.

Using a replication probability, the c+-probability is defined as follows: if we get a random draw from each group (or factor level) and calculate the sampled value of the contrast variable based on the random draws, then the c+-probability is the chance that the sampled values of the contrast variable are greater than 0 when the random drawing process is repeated infinite times. The c+-probability is a probabilistic index accounting for distributions of compared groups (or factor levels). The c+-probability and SMCV are two characteristics of a contrast variable. There is a link between SMCV and c+-probability. The SMCV and c+-probability provides a consistent interpretation to the strength of comparisons in contrast analysis. When only two groups are involved in a comparison, the c+-probability becomes d+-probability which is the probability that the difference of values from two groups is positive. To some extent, the d+-probability (especially in the independent situations) is equivalent to the well-established probabilistic index P(X > Y). Historically, the index P(X > Y) has been studied and applied in many areas. The c+-probability and d+-probability have been used for data analysis in high-throughput experiments and biopharmaceutical research.

The word is derived from Ibn Arabi's nickname, \\"Shaykh al-Akbar,\\" meaning \\"the greatest shaykh.\\" Akbariyya has never been used to indicate a specific Sufi group or society. It is now used to refer to all historical or contemporary Sufi metaphysicians and Sufis influenced by Ibn Arabi's doctrine of Wahdat al- Wujud. It is not to be confused with Al Akbariyya, a secret Sufi society founded by Swedish Sufi 'Abdu l-Hadi Agu√©li.  Wahdat al-Wujud  Wahdat al- Wajud (Arabic: Ÿàÿ≠ÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑŸàÿ¨ŸàÿØ Persian: Ÿàÿ≠ÿØÿ™ Ÿàÿ¨ŸàÿØ) meaning the \\"unity of being\\" is a Sufi philosophy emphasizing that \\"there is no true existence except the Ultimate Truth (God)\\", that is, that the only truth within the universe is God, and that all things exist within God only. Ibn Arabi is most often characterized in Islamic texts as the originator of this doctrine. However, it is not found in his works. The first to employ this term was Ibn Sabin. Ibn Arabi's disciple and stepson Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi used this term in his own works and explained it using philosophical terms. Academic study  Europe and United States  In the 20th century there has been a focus on the Akbariyya School in academic circles and universities. Viewed in a historical context, increased government support for the study of the Muslim world and Islamic languages emerged in the United States after the Second World War where many students were attracted to Islam and religious studies during the 1970s. The greatest growth in American scholarship on Sufism took place during the 1970s. Alexander Knysh notes that, \\"In the decades after World War Two the majority of Western experts in Sufism were no longer based in Europe, but in North America.\\" Henri Corbin (d. 1978) and Fritz Meier (d. 1998), who were prominent among these experts, made important contributions to the study of Islamic mysticism. Other important names were Miguel As√≠n Palacios (d. 1944) and Louis Massignon (d. 1962), who made contributions to Ibn Arabi studies. Palacios discovered some Akbarian elements in Dante's Divine Comedy. Massignon studied the famous Sufi Al-Hallaj saying \\"Anal Hak\\" (I am the Truth). Seyyed Hossein Nasr and his students and academic disciples have come to play an important role in certain subfields of Sufi studies. The influence of Nasr and other Traditionalist writers like Rene Guenon and Frithjof Schuon on Sufi studies can be seen in the interpretation of the works of Ibn Arabi and the Akbarian school by such scholars as Titus Burckhardt, Martin Lings, James Morris, William Chittick, Sachiko Murata, and others. These names are both mostly practitioners of Sufism and scholars studying Sufism.  Turkey  Turkey is situated where Ibn Arabi's most prominent disciple, successor and stepson Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi, and other important commentators on Arabi's works lived in the past. Daw≈´d al-Qay·π£arƒ´, who was invited to Iznik by Orhan Ghazi to be the director and teacher for the first Ottoman university (madrasa), was the disciple of KamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al-QƒÅshƒÅnƒ´, himself a disciple of Sadr al-Dƒ´n al-Q≈´nawƒ´. This means that the official teaching itself was set in motion by a great master of the Akbarian school. Not only Sufis but also Ottoman sultans, politicians and intellectuals had been deeply impressed by Ibn Arabi and his disciples and interpreters.Mustafa Tahrali, A General Outline of the Influence of Ibn 'Arabi on the Ottoman Era Seyyed Muhammad Nur al-Arabi was also impressed by Ibn Arabi's doctrine, though that continued to decrease until the Modern Era. In the 20th century the last important commentator of Fus√ªs was Ahmed Avni Konuk (d. 1938). He was a mawlaw√Æ and composer of Turkish music. Studies on Sufism, especially Akbarian works, were not very common until the first Ph.D. thesis was written by Mahmud Erol Kƒ±lƒ±c in Marmara University's Faculty of Theology titled \\"Ibn 'Arabi's Ontology\\" (in Turkish, \\"Muhyiddin ƒ∞bn Arabi'de Varlƒ±k ve Varlƒ±k Mertebeleri\\") in 1995. Academic studies on Akbarian metaphysics and philosophy began to rise after studies on this topic were conducted by Turkish scholars such as Mustafa Tahralƒ± and Mahmud Erol Kƒ±lƒ±c. In terms of Akbarian studies, the most important event to take place was the translation of Ibn Arabi's magnum opus,\\"Futuhat-ƒ± Makkiyya\\", to Turkish. Turkish scholar Ekrem Demirli translated the work in 18 volumes between 2006 and 2012. This particular translation was the first complete translation to another language. Demirli's work also includes translating Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi's corpus to Turkish and writing a PhD thesis on him in 2004, writing a commentary on Fusus al-Hikam by Ibn Arabi, and writing a book titled ƒ∞slam Metafiziƒüinde Tanrƒ± ve ƒ∞nsan (God and Human in Islamic Metaphysics), [Istanbul: Kabalcƒ±, 2009 ()]. There are many Akbarian works in Ottoman Turkish that are yet to be studied by scholars.  List of some Akbarian Sufis  There have been many Akbarian Sufis, metaphysicians and philosophers. Ibn Arabi never founded a Tarikah,Michel Chodkiewicz, The Diffusion of Ibn 'Arabi's Doctrine but he created the philosophy of Wahdat al-Wujud.

In reaction to a state visit by the Japanese Prime Minister, Kakuei Tanaka, students held a demonstration protesting corruption, high prices, and inequality in foreign investments. After provocation by suspected agent provocateurs, the demonstrations became riots, which eventually turned into a pogrom. By the end of the incident, 11 protestors had been killed and hundreds of cars and buildings destroyed. The riots caused numerous changes. Suharto's New Order government enacted a series of economic reforms meant to improve Native Indonesian representation in partnerships with foreign investors, General Sumitro (then Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces), was forced to retire, and numerous repressive measures were enforced by the government. Background At the beginning of Suharto's New Order in 1966 the policies of economic development were popularly supported. However, dissent soon surfaced. The formerly-powerful Indonesian Nationalist and Masyumi political parties were pressured to replace their old leadership. Civilian politicians began to be considered untrustworthy, and all branches of the government (except the executive branch) steadily diminished in importance. Suharto's Golkar party won the 1971 Indonesian legislative election by forcing civil servants to vote for them and promising funds to supportive constituencies. Disillusionment with the government continued to rise. The elimination of corruption, once hoped to be a priority of the New Order, was not worked towards; corruption instead became more institutionalized. Critics disagreed with the \\"financial generals\\", army staff who used their relationships with the ethnic Chinese Indonesians to become rich. One of them, Sujono Humardhani, was identified as the most prolific in convincing Japanese businesses to invest in Indonesia. When they did, they often took full ownership of the investments and partnered with Chinese Indonesians or senior military officers instead of with native Indonesians. The success of the 1973 Thai student demonstrations convinced Indonesian students that they could change policy. Riots The incident started with a visit by Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. On 14 January 1974 Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka arrived for a state visit. Enraged by Japan's competitive pressures on local businesses, students burned effigies of Tanaka and Humardhani outside of Ali Murtopo's office. They faced no resistance from the Indonesian military. The next morning, thousands of students demonstrated in the streets of Jakarta, calling for lower prices, an end to corruption, and the disbanding of Aspri, Suharto's clique of personal assistants. Although the demonstrations began peacefully, by the afternoon suspected Special Forces' agent provocateurs had turned it into a full riot. Hundreds of cars were burned, mainly of Japanese make. More stores were looted, including \\"the most visible symbol of Japanese presence in Indonesia\\", an Astra dealership selling Toyota- brand cars on Sudirman Street. By the evening, the riot had been diverted into an anti-Chinese Indonesian pogrom. Stores in Glodok, owned by ethnic Chinese, were looted and burned; the largest being the Senen shopping complex. The security forces did little to stop the looting, and it was reported that General Sumitro was seen speaking with the demonstrators in a friendly manner. However, some troops executed orders to shoot looters on sight. Later that evening Hariman Siregar, president of the Student Body of the University of Indonesia called for an end to the riots via Televisi Republik Indonesia, saying \\"this wasn't our intent\\". It was later reported that Siregar had made the plea under duress. The riots were brought to an end the next day, when KKO, RPKAD, and Kostrad forces fired upon the rioters. By then, Prime Minister Tanaka had already left Indonesia due to the riots. During the three days of civil conflict 11 people were killed, 17 critically injured, 120 non- critically injured and roughly 770 arrested. Almost 1,000 motor vehicles were damaged and 144 buildings destroyed or burned. Aftermath Crowds on the streets during the 15 January 1974 \\"Malari\\" riots General Sumitro, the Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces, was blamed for inciting the rioters, and forced to resign. His supporters were removed from command positions, being made ambassadors or receiving staff jobs. This move was supported by the \\"Ramadi Document\\" presented to President Suharto by General Ali Murtopo, a rival of Sumitro's. It hinted that a general with the initial S would attempt a coup d'√©tat between April and June 1974. After the Malari incident, the New Order became more repressive and quicker to act when citizens expressed dissent, including through demonstrations and the media, abandoning the fragile \\"partnership\\" they once had. Twelve newspapers and magazines had their printing and publishing permits revoked, including Indonesia Raya. Journalists, such as Mochtar Lubis, were detained without trial. Offending journalists began to be blacklisted, losing nearly all job opportunities. Within a week of the Malari incident, the New Order presented a package of regulations meant to promote the economic interests of Native Indonesians. The plan, mandating partnerships between foreign investors and Native Indonesians as well as the use of the planned Indonesia Stock Exchange, and requiring potential investors submit a plan for future majority Native Indonesian ownership, was well received by the public and silenced critics. In practice, however, this was not strictly enforced. The Aspri were officially disbanded. However, former Aspri Ali Murtopo was later promoted to head of the Indonesian State Intelligence Agency and all of them stayed on as trusted advisers. Reactions The New Order government was \\"shocked to its very roots\\" by its inability to handle the riots during Tanaka's visit. Jeffrey Winters notes that the greatest fear of the Indonesian politicians at the time was an uprising of the millions of urban and rural poor.

There has been a long history of conflict between the Toposa of Namorunyang and Bunio and the Didinga of Budi County. The Toposa are purely pastoralist and the Didinga are agro-pastoralists. In the dry season the Toposa would drive their cattle to the Didinga Hills for water and pasture until the rains began in Toposa land. In the past, this practice was carried out by agreement between the two communities, with a gift being made in exchange for the right to access the pasturage. With the proliferation of guns and breakdown of order during the civil war, the traditional protocols were ignored and violence became common. In May 2007 Toposa tribesmen of Namorunyang raided the Ngauro Payam of Budi County, attacked a group that were resting after working in a collectively-owned field, and took 300 head of cattle and 400 goats or sheep. 49 women, 4 children and 5 men were killed, while others were wounded.

In 1938 she completed Post Graduate studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.Hu, Joseph. ‚ÄúEdna Andrade : Biography Locks Gallery.‚Äù Accessed April 22, 2015. http://www.locksgallery.com/artists.php?aid=1 . While at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Andrade was awarded two Cresson Traveling Scholarships. While traveling post World War II, Andrade encountered the Bauhaus movement and other examples of German modernism. The artistic experimentation happening in Europe influences Andrade's approach to design, color, and abstraction. In 1941 she married architect Preston Andrade and they moved to Philadelphia in 1946, where she would remain for the rest of her life. Career After her studies, Andrade taught art at an elementary school in Norfolk, Virginia. Subsequently, she taught at Tulane University in New Orleans. Upon her move to Philadelphia, she began teaching at The University of the Arts, where she taught for thirty years. In her early career she drafted on a freelance basis, but didn't take charge of her career until her marriage ended.Rosenberg, Amy S. ‚ÄúAn Op Art original.‚Äù The Philadelphia Inquirer, January 11, 2007. Andrade's early work includes water color collages and ink drawing of abstracted landscapes (an outpouring of art). During World War II, she worked on propaganda materials for what is now the CIA. Over the course of her career she created public artwork, commissioned by the Free Library of Philadelphia and the Salvation Army. Beginning in the 1950s, Andrade painted highly abstract, geometric paintings that used a limited color palette and variety of shapes. Her work is in numerous collections including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, The Museum of Contemporary Art Buenos Aires, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, the Dallas Museum of Art, Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and Baltimore Art Museum, the Utah Museum of Fine Arts, and the Delaware Art Museum. Her papers are held at the Archives of American Art.  Style  As a part of the Op art movement, Andrade's style confronts the nature of perception, creating highly abstracted, geometric images. Her oil paintings possess illusionistic qualities, hence ‚Äúoptical art.‚Äù As Andrade began creating illusionistic art, she shifted from organic abstraction to hard-edge geometry, emphasizing symmetrical squares and color juxtapositions.Ann Sutherland Harris, ‚ÄúCool Waves and Hot Blocks: The Art of Edna Andrade,‚Äù Woman‚Äôs Art Journal 15 (1995): 59. Andrade's style of painting often produces hallucinatory compositions, psychedelic in appearance and often as if they are moving. Her paintings have no narrative, nor subject matter, which situate Andrade as an abstract artist. In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Andrade comments on her paintings, stating, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like showing your emotion. It‚Äôs a decision to be totally visual. A story doesn‚Äôt go with it.‚Äù As demonstrated by Andrade and her paintings, they are complex visual experiences, based in aesthetic experimentation rather than storytelling. Her style is best exhibited in her most famous painting, Motion 4-64. Motion 4-64 is a 48-inch square oil painting featuring black and white rectangles. The edges bend inward, pulling the viewer into the center of the canvas, creating an illusionary experience.Ann Fabri, ‚ÄúEdna Andrade at ICA and Locks,‚Äù Art in America 91 (2003): 171. She implements curvilinear lines to create an illusionistic space, in which the audience visually experiences movement within the geometric, flowing design. Other paintings such as Turbo I, from 1965, integrate the science of perception into the viewer's experience by using lines and circular movements to create aesthetically engaging canvasses. In her later work, Andrade returns to painting abstracted landscapes and practices the more fundamental art techniques she learned while at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.  Influences  Andrade listed artists who particularly influenced her style including Paul Klee, Piet Mondrian, and Josef Salvador Gonz√°lez Ruvalcaba the Mar√≠a Del Refugio Gonz√°lez BarajasAlbers.\\"Past Exhibitions > Edna Andrade: Optical Paintings, 1963-1986 - ICA - Institute of Contemporary Art - Philadelphia, PA\\".

She was specifically inspired by things such as astrophysics and Freudian psychology, contributing to the complexity and detail of her paintings.Rosenberg, Amy S. ‚ÄúAn outpouring of art.‚Äù The Philadelphia Inquirer, September 14, 2012. Death Andrade died on April 17, 2008 at the age of 91 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Recognition In 1991 Andrade received Philadelphia's Mayor's Arts and Culture Award for Visual Arts as well as the Distinguished Teaching Award from the College Art Association in 1996.  Legacy  In 1997, the Leeway Foundation established the Edna Andrade Emerging Artist Award to encourage and assist female artists in their artistic careers. In 2013, the Edna Andrade Summer Scholarship was established at the University of Pennsylvania, providing travel for student researchers. There have been two major retrospectives of Andrade's work, one in her lifetime and one after her death.

It was the first museum to be established in the country since independence in 1960. Establishment In the mid-1970s, a strong cultural movement arose in Hargeisa. This movement was the driving force behind the establishment of the museum. The museum was a part of a cultural center in the city that consisted of a theater, a library and a provincial museum. The building consisted of two concentric rings with a meeting area and temporary exhibit room. The circular building in the center was inspired by the \\"mundul\\" which is a traditional hut used by Somali farmers. The museum was 650 m¬≤ large and was designed and built by a local contractor, Osman Dahir Adan. Collection When the museum was opened in 1977, it had an ethnographic exhibition, most of the parts for which had been donated by the residents of Hargeisa. The items where displayed in two 20 meters long cabinets without any glass, one in each of the halls. There were only two attendants, the gardener and a cleaning woman and both the collection and building soon started to deteriorate. Renovating was started in 1981. The two large showcases where dismantled and 23 smaller cases with glass were built. Netting was installed in front of the windows, the building repainted and the collection was cleaned. Original it had been around 4,000 items on display. However, the new exhibition was reduced to around 1.400 items, with the rest was put into storage. A special display was made for firearms used by Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan and his men between 1901 and 1921. Destruction The museum was completely destroyed by the civil war in 1988. Reconstruction Reconstruction is taking place on the building and is set to be completed in 2012.

Biography  Born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi in 1923 to tenant farmers, Womack began school at the University of Mississippi, but transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C. to complete his degree and to pursue graduate studies. Womack was a heavyset man and an albino. By 1946, Womack came to terms with his homosexuality and ended his marriage to his second wife. This coincided with the collapse of one of his business ventures, the Howell Academy, a private boarding school at which Womack reportedly was rarely present. After the closing of the Howell Academy, Womack enrolled in a Ph.D. program in philosophy at Johns Hopkins University, receiving his doctorate in 1955. After completing his Ph.D., he became a professor of Philosophy at the George Washington University. Guild Press Founding An investment that he had made earlier in his life paid off and resulted in his becoming the owner of a small printing plant. With this printing press, he developed MANual Enterprises, an earlier incarnation of the Guild Press. By 1960, Guild Press became a profitable publishing enterprise under Womack's leadership as publisher and sole proprietor and was printing art and physique magazines and providing a national mail-order business. Battling censorship: Manual Enterprises v. J. Edward Day In 1962, the United States Postal Service tried to shut down the distribution of three of the Guild Press's publications: Manual, Trim, and Grecian Guild Pictorial. Womack responded by taking the U.S. Postal Service to court in MANual Enterprises v. Day (1962), which was one of the First Amendment cases that determined that erotica intended for gay males was \\"not obscene as a matter of law\\". He ultimately won the case on appeal in the United States Supreme Court, thereby carving out greater freedoms for gay publications throughout the United States. Business operations At its height, Womack's business enterprises included Guild Press; Guild Book Service, its mail order distribution service; the Grecian Guild; the Potomac News Company; the Mark II gay cinema (808 K St NW in Washington, DC); and Village Books, a chain of bookstores along the East Coast. In Washington, DC, there were Village Books outlets at 819 13 St NW and at 14th and H Streets NW. Through the 1960s and 1970s, Womack ran his businesses through partners and subordinates, such as J. J. Proferes (also owner of DC's Metropole Cinema), Henry Pryba, and Raymond Pechin. Womack's mail order business, Guild Book Service, started in 1964, distributed a regular bulletin to members with reviews of selections. In its first Bulletin, Guild Book Service announce that it had \\"been organized primarily as a service to meet the needs of the subscribers to the various publications of Guild Press, Ltd. We will provide a critical evaluation of much of the material now flooding certain areas of specialized interest and will make these materials available as efficiently and economically as possible.\\" The Guild Book Service goals were to bring the \\"collective output of gay titles and provide them to a newly defined gay reading public.\\" Womack was not known for being a competent businessperson. At one point, he committed himself into St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, D.C. to avoid creditors. He set up a makeshift office in the hospital, from which he could run his business without interruptions from creditors or lawyers. He had run out of money and could not complete the manufacture of books that had been in progress for years. Dispute with Samuel Steward In March 1964, Samuel Steward (a.k.a. Phil Andros) met H. Lynn Womack in New York to discuss the publication of a collection of short stories that he had been working on. The lunch meeting between Steward and Womack was productive, and Womack ultimately decided to publish Steward's book $tud. By late 1965, the final manuscript had been submitted, and $tud was slated to be published in 1966. Unfortunately, due to Womack's legal and financial problems, the publication of $tud was delayed for more than three years. Because Womack was hiding in St. Elizabeth's Hospital and refusing to return Steward's calls, Steward was unable to buy back the rights to his manuscript and had to wait until Womack could pull together the money to finish the production of his book The text block of the books had been printed in 1966 but had sat for three years with no bindings. By 1969, Steward found another publisher (J. Brian) willing to publish a cheap paperback edition of $tud. Utilizing an escape clause in the contract, Steward agreed to allowing J. Brian to publish the paperback edition. Womack retaliated by immediately having the unbound books in his warehouse bound, but instead of selling or distributing them to bookstores, had them remaindered which meant that Steward would never earn any royalties. Later legal problems In 1970, Womack decided to launch a short-lived gay newspaper, The Gay Forum, with national distribution. Womack's new venture into the newspaper business quickly floundered due in large part to renewed prosecution of Guild Press and Womack on charges of using underage models in the increasingly photo-illustrated publications produced by Guild Press. In April 1970, the FBI conducted major raids on adult bookstores up and down the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. As part of a plea bargain reached in 1971 to reduce Womack's sentence from two-and-a-half years to six months, Womack agreed to legally separate himself from his adult businesses, including the Guild Press. Guild Press ceased nearly all publishing within two years and was bankrupt by 1974. Later life In the 1970s, after the end of his connection with Guild Press and its ultimate demise, Womack moved to Boca Raton, Florida, where he died in 1985.

In 1870 she served as a nurse in Sedan during the Franco-Prussian War. She was known for her ability to improvise when lacking the resources of a hospital. That year she also wrote A Handbook for Nursing the Sick, which was well received by her fellow nurses. In 1873 she became qualified as a midwife. She was dismayed by the small amount of training many of her fellow midwives had received. She then worked with publisher Louisa Hubbard to establish the Trained Midwives Registration Society. She was the treasurer of the new society. She served as the president of the Midwives' Institute from 1890 until her death in 1894. In this role she advised government regulators on legislation about midwifery. Personal life In 1876 she married Henry Smith, a widowed surgeon.

Both these stations are truncated versions of former station sites, Bradford Forster Square station and Bradford Exchange. These stations were built in the nineteenth century by different railway companies with an individual, rather than a comprehensive plan for rail development in the city.  History  Linking the stations together was first suggested as early as 1845; however, an Act of Parliament granted to the Midland Railway on the 25 July 1896 permitted them to build a new branch railway from Royston in South Yorkshire to Queens Road north of Bradford. The West Riding Lines Act allowed for a tunnel underneath the east side of Bradford, bypassing Exchange station, with underground platforms at Forster Square and emerging out to serve Manningham and beyond. The tunnel was to be long. Another proposal was put forward in 1911 and an enabling Act known as the \\"Bradford Through Lines Act\\" was passed. The area between the stations was heavily built-up with Victorian warehouses, shops and offices, so the 1911 plan would have involved a large amount of demolition. This plan called for a line starting near Low Moor with a tunnel with a girder bridge high above Forster Square. The start of World War I put a stop to these plans. The Midland eventually abandoned the plan and on the 30 September 1920, it sold all the buildings it had purchased for the scheme back to the Bradford Corporation for ¬£295,000. Another plan was to emerge in the 1950s when Bradford Corporation members discussed a circular rail service through Bradford using a new tunnel. This would see a train leaving and calling at , , , , , , , St Dunstan's, and back into Forster Square (and vice versa). This would utilise the closed Shipley and Windhill Line. The tunnel was eventually rejected as the height difference between Exchange and Forster Square of made the gradient unacceptable. By the late 1950s and early 1960s many of the Victorian buildings in central Bradford were demolished to make way for the urban vision of the then Bradford city engineer Stanley Wardley. Although the land between the two stations was cleared to make way for new office blocks and an urban ring road, the plans did not include a cross rail link. A slightly different vision did emerge in the 1970s when the Victorian Bradford Exchange station was demolished and a new integrated Bradford Interchange rail and bus station was built to the south of Bridge Street. The idea of a crossrail route for Bradford was raised in 1989, when the estimated cost was ¬£30 million. By 2010, when another proposal was mooted, the cost was estimated at ¬£140 million. Many of Wardley‚Äôs highrise office blocks and shops did not ultimately prove successful and by the late 1980s many of them lay empty. An initial plan was put forward to redevelop part of the city centre with a shopping development called the Broadway Centre. Forster Square station was truncated in 1990 and a new station was built some distance to the north of the original to help facilitate these plans. The aim was to build part of the new shopping centre in place of some of the demolished 1960s buildings with the rest of the centre taking up the site of the old station. By truncating the station it was hoped that passengers walking to the new platforms would generate a greater amount of pedestrian flow around the shopping centre, thus making it more viable. The recession of the early 1990s however, put paid to these plans and Broadway Centre was never built.  21st century  By 2004 another plan had emerged to build a new Westfield shopping centre in the middle of Bradford. This led to the wholesale urban clearance of many of the 1960s buildings to make way for the new centre. Although work started on laying the groundwork for the new shopping centre another recession again put paid to the initial plans with Westfield still planning to build a new smaller centre when financial conditions were more favourable. In January 2014, the site was cleared and steelwork was erected in March 2014 with the main building works following on. The centre was opened to the public in November 2015. As most of the land between the stations is now clear of buildings this has led to further speculation about the viability of building a cross city heavy rail link. Bradford Council had discussed plans long before in the 1980s, but linking the stations was ultimately deemed to be too expensive. Today, even with the clearance of most of the land there is no official plan by either the Bradford Council or the Westfield Group to develop a link. Although Westfield did design and fund the new Shepherd's Bush station as part of their West London shopping development. The development of Stratford station in East London is also connected to Westfield's Stratford City project. In 2010, a group of local businessmen and councillors have put forward a plan to link Bradford's stations. Inspired by other rail projects, such as the London Overground link in Shoreditch, the Bradford business plan involved building new Bradford central station linked by a viaduct and track bridging the distance (currently ) and the gradient difference involved. The Bradford Crossrail plan is aimed to stimulate business investment in Bradford, but due to the high costs and major engineering works involved it is not likely to be taken forward at this time as a heavy rail link; however, The One North Report from 2014 suggested a tram-train route from the Interchange via Forster Square and continuing on to Leeds Bradford Airport. The Campaign for Better Transport support the proposal to join the two stations at Bradford with a crossrail link. The support comes from their Re-Opening Rail Lines campaign, which is focused around previous railways being re-opened. In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line which was listed as Priority 2 for being built. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments). The Northern Powerhouse Rail project has also mooted a project to link Leeds and Manchester with a through route at Bradford. Whilst this would either involve a bypass line south of the city and a parkway station at or a new route tunnelling through the city centre, neither option mentions connecting the lines from both north and south of the city together.

Alba is a private label brand used for budget electronics. Products bearing the brand name are primarily sold at Argos, and to a lesser extent at Sainsbury's. Alba's sister brand is Bush, which has a similar history. History Alba began by manufacturing radio sets from 1922. In the late 1960s they became Alba Group, and made only low-cost consumer products. The name Alba used to be a trademark used on radio and television produced by A.J. Balcombe Ltd. The company was formed in 1917 or 1918 by Alfred Balcombe. It became Alba in 1960, and went into receivership in June 1982. During that time, it was a significant contributor to the development of the British radio & TV industry. In 1982, it was bought by Harvard International. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1987 as Alba plc, buying Bush in 1988, and then Goodmans in 1994. Alba also produces electronic products under licence for other companies or individuals, including Antony Worrall Thompson, Cable and Wireless, Carl Lewis, JCB, Ministry of Sound, Nicky Clarke and NTL. The company sold its share of the Grundig brand for ¬£25.5m in December 2007, although it retained the UK distribution rights until 2010. In November 2008, the Alba and Bush names were purchased by Home Retail Group, the parent company of Homebase and Argos, for ¬£15.25 million. As a result, the former Alba Group was renamed to Harvard International. Today Alba products are more basic and cheaper than its sister brand, Bush, which manufactures more professional and more expensive products. The brand is parodied in the British Sitcom I'm Alan Partridge starring Steve Coogan. In the series, Alan telephones Currys (now Currys PC World) asking about two supplementary speakers for his Alba system, with the aim of achieving surround sound, apparently unaware that such technology was not available for the basic Alba system.

Brieske (May 4, 1923 ‚Äì November 29, 1968) was an American football placekicker. He played college football for the University of Michigan in 1942, 1946 and 1947. He set Michigan, Rose Bowl, Big Ten Conference, and national collegiate placekicking records and was the second leading scorer on Michigan's undefeated 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team. For more than two decades, he held the Michigan records for most successful point after touchdown (\\"PAT\\") conversions in a career (107), season (52), and game (9). Brieske's college football career was interrupted by service in the United States Navy during the 1944 and 1945 football seasons. His kicking foot was amputated in 1967 due to cancer. He died the following year at age 45 following surgery to remove growths from his lungs. Early years Brieske was born in May 1923 at either Saginaw, or Port Huron, Michigan. His family moved to Harbor Beach in the Thumb of Michigan in the late 1920s. His father, Frank Brieske, was a Michigan native of German descent who, at the time of the 1930 United States Census, was working as an oil agent at Harbor Beach. His mother, Sadie Brieske, was a Michigan native of Polish descent. Brieske had an older sister Lorraine (born c. 1921), a younger sister Helen (born c. 1927), and a younger brother Kenneth (born c. 1929).Census entry for Frank Brieske and family. Ancestry.com. 1930 United States Federal Census [database on- line]. Census Place: Harbor Beach, Huron, Michigan; Roll: 989; Page: 9B; Enumeration District: 16; Image: 917.0. Brieske was a backfield star for the Harbor Beach High School football team and graduated from the school in 1941. University of Michigan Brieske enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1941. He played on the all-freshman football team that year. He played three years of varsity football for the Michigan Wolverines football team under head coach Fritz Crisler. Brieske graduated in 1947 with a B.S. in science and mathematics.1947 Michiganensian. After graduating in 1947, Brieske enrolled as a graduate student in Michigan's Business Administration School. 1942 season As a sophomore, Brieske played for the 1942 Michigan Wolverines football team that was ranked No.8 in the final AP Poll. He tried out for the center position, but that position was filled by All-American (and future College Football Hall of Fame inductee) Merv Pregulman. Brieske won a spot on the team as a placekicker. He converted 26 of 31 point after touchdown (\\"PAT\\") attempts in 1942. Brieske's talent as a kicker won him acclaim, and in November 1942, stories about Brieske were published in newspapers across the country. Michigan had lost or tied several close games in Fritz Crisler's first four years at Michigan as a result of missed PAT attempts (including 7‚Äì6 losses to Minnesota in 1938 and 1940 and a 20‚Äì20 tie with Ohio State in 1941). One newspaper story noted that Brieske had earned the nickname \\"Old Monotony\\" because his reliability in converting PATs had turned Michigan's kicking game from excitement to routine. At the time, Brieske told the reporter he wasn't satisfied with having a limited role as a placekicker: \\"Sure, this kicking is alright, but I'd like to take a crack at the real stuff.\\" He was also known by the nicknames \\"automatic Jim,\\" and the \\"mechanical toe.\\" Teammate Bob Chappuis later recounted a story from the 1942 season when he and Brieske were both sophomores. In the first game of the 1942 season, Brieske kicked a field goal to secure a 9‚Äì0 victory over the Great Lakes Naval Station team. The next week, Brieske brought his hometown newspaper into the locker room. The headline read, \\"Jim Brieske, the Pride of Harbor Beach.\\" Brieske showed it to his teammates and then took it into the coaches' locker room and showed it to them. Chappuis recalled that was \\"a bad mistake!\\" Head coach Fritz Crisler had Brieske play linebacker during practice that day, where he was \\"on his back all day.\\" Eventually, Crisler walked over to Brieske who was lying on his back and said, \\"Brieske, you're not the pride of Harbor Beach, you're a jackass.\\" Military service An injury kept Brieske from playing during the 1943 season, and he also missed the 1944 and 1945 seasons while serving in the United States Navy. 1946 season Brieske returned to the University of Michigan in time for summer football training in August 1946. He played for the 1946 Michigan Wolverines football team that finished the season ranked No.6 in the final Associated Press poll. Brieske completed 29 of 32 PATs in 1946 and also kicked a field goal. With 32 points, he was the Wolverines' leading scorer in 1946. 1947 season Brieske graduated with his B.S. degree in 1947, and the Baltimore Colts offered him a contract to play professional football. Instead, he returned to Michigan in the fall of 1947 as a graduate student in the Business Administration School. He was the place- kicker for the 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team that finished undefeated and untied with a 10‚Äì0 record. In an October 1947 article on the growth of specialization in football, The Sporting News wrote: > \\"Brieske is one of the greatest kickers college football has ever had. He > led the Wolverines in scoring, entirely with his foot, last season and in > three games, this fall, converted on 23 of 25 attempts. Brieske converted 52 of 57 PAT attempts and was the team's second leading scorer during the 1947 regular season. Only two of the five PATs Brieske failed to convert in 1947 were \\"misses\\" resulting from his own inaccuracy. Three of the misses resulted from balls that were fumbled or snapped poorly from the center. Brieske had converted 31 of 34 PAT attempts in the first five games of the 1947 season and was the leading scorer in the Big Ten Conference at the end of October. He converted 7 of 7 attempts against both Northwestern and Stanford and 9 of 10 against Pitt. The fact that an extra point specialist led the conference in scoring drew national media attention. Sports writer Bob French wrote a column about Brieske titled, \\"Specialist Comes Into His Own.\\" He called Brieske \\"one of the specialists who make this football era picturesque\\" and noted the irony that Brieske was the conference's leading scorer even though he had not been involved in an official play: \\"Brieske makes his points without using up any time at all. The watch is stopped when he goes into action after touchdowns. You might say he doesn't play; he just scores.\\" The Los Angeles Times also noted the unusual nature of Brieske's contributions: > \\"Brieske has an enviable distinction. He has scored his 100 points in NO > TIME AT ALL. No sir. It didn't take him one single minute to score all those > points. Football rules call for the clock to be stopped on the try for extra > point. That means Brieske, a third-string center, has booted all those > tallies without ever officially being in a single football game.\\" Brieske explained the secret to his success: \\"You've got to believe you're going to kick that point and let nothing disturb your poise once you're set. I 'wish' it over every time.\\" Although ranked second in the Associated Press poll at the end of the regular season, the Wolverines defeated the USC Trojans by a score of 49‚Äì0 in the 1948 Rose Bowl game, and were selected as the nation's number-one team by a 226‚Äì119 margin over Notre Dame in an unprecedented post-bowl Associated Press poll. The 1947 team has been selected as the best team in the history of Michigan football. After the 1947 season, Brieske was selected to play in the College All-Star Game against the NFL champion Chicago Cardinals. He was one of 10 players from the 1947 Michigan team invited to play in the game. Placekicking records * With 52 successful PAT conversions in 1947, Brieseke surpassed the national collegiate record of 47 conversions in a season set by Dick Walterhouse of Army and George Jernigan of Georgia. The official records dated back to 1937 when the National Collegiate Athletic Bureau began compiling statistics. Michigan's Tom Hammond kicked 65 extra points for the 1903 \\"Point-a-Minute\\" team. * His total of 107 successful PAT conversions in three years set the Michigan career record. His career record was broken in 1974 by Mike Lantry who converted 113 PATs. * He set Michigan's season record for successful PAT conversions by completing 52 of 57 attempts in 1947. His season record was broken in 1971 by Dana Coin who converted 55 PATs. * He set Michigan's single-game record for successful PAT conversions by converting 9 of 10 attempts against Pitt on October 11, 1947. His single-game record was broken on November 7, 1981 by Ali Haji-Sheikh with 10 PATs. (James E. Lawrence kicked 19 successful PAT conversions against Michigan Agricultural in 1902, but the National Collegiate Athletic Bureau began compiling \\"official\\" statistics until 1937.) * He set the record for successful PAT conversions in conference play by converting 22 of 23 attempts in 1946. He tied his own record by converting 22 of 24 attempts in conference play in 1947. *He set a Rose Bowl record with seven PATs in the 1948 Rose Bowl. *He tied the Rose Bowl record set in 1931 with three PAT in one quarter during the 1948 Rose Bowl. Later years and family In January 1948, Brieske was selected by the New York Giants as the 97th pick in the 1948 NFL Draft. In April 1948, Giants President John V. Mara announced that the club had signed Brieske. Brieske played in several pre-season games for the Giants, but opted to return to Ann Arbor in September 1948 to complete his master's degree. Brieske and his wife Ann had two children, James Brieske, Jr., and Karen Brieske. During the 1960s, Brieske was the director of student activities at Stevenson High School in Livonia, Michigan. In January 1967, Brieske was sick with cancer and had his right leg amputated from approximately eight inches below the knee. When the cancer returned, Brieske was hospitalized again in late October 1968. In late November 1968, he underwent surgery at the University of Michigan Hospital to remove lung growths. He suffered a stroke after the operation and remained in a coma until he died the following day. His funeral was held at St. Aidan's Roman Catholic Church in Livonia, and he was buried at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Southfield, Michigan.

Originally launched as Eat Your Kimchi, from 2008 to 2016, the channel featured videos about the Stawskis' lives in South Korea, including food, cultural differences, and popular media. In 2012, the Stawskis registered Eat Your Kimchi as a company in South Korea and opened their own studio in Seoul, which remained operational until 2015. In 2016, the Stawskis moved to Tokyo, Japan, where they lived until 2020. During their stay, they produced a video series on Japanese food and culture titled Eat Your Sushi. Their channel was rebranded as Simon and Martina to reflect the change. By January 2018, the channel had 1.3 million subscribers. Background Simon and Martina Stawski met in 2005 during a poetry class at the University of Toronto, and both earned a Bachelor's Degree in Education and Art. After marrying, the two moved to Bucheon, South Korea in 2008 to teach English abroad. At the time of their arrival, there had been threats of violence between North and South Korea. As a result, they uploaded their first video on YouTube as an attempt to show their parents that they were safe, which was a video of them eating at Incheon International Airport. Originally, the video blogs were made for their friends and family, but it later expanded to documenting \\"fun and quirky things\\" about Korea, and they later titled their channel Eat Your Kimchi. Soon, they experienced a rise in viewership in 2009. The Stawskis were several of the first non-Korean bloggers whose content was centered on Korea, particularly on YouTube. In 2011, after quitting their jobs as teachers, the Stawskis became full-time bloggers living off the ad revenue from their YouTube videos and website. The popularity of Eat Your Kimchi has led the Stawskis to be invited on South Korean television programs such as Heart to Heart, Quilt Your Korean Map, Star King, and Running Man. On September 5, 2012, the Stawskis launched a fundraiser on Indiegogo for setting up a business and for a studio in Seoul to film. The fundraiser met its goal of $40,000 in less than seven hours and raised more than $100,000. By 2013, the Stawskis registered Eat Your Kimchi as a business and relocated from Bucheon to Seoul. Video producers Soo Zee Kim and Leigh Cooper were hired as Eat Your Kimchi's interns and later appeared in their videos. On August 9, 2014, in collaboration with the YouTube channel Talk to Me in Korean, the Stawskis opened You Are Here Cafe, a cafe situated in Hongdae for language exchange and Korean language classes. The Stawskis met Adam Swarts, the CEO of Japanese media company Breaker, at a video industry event in the United States, who offered to sign them onto his company and bring them over to Japan. They accepted, having decided to expedite their travel plans due to the increasing severity of Martina's Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. In 2015, the Stawskis closed down Eat Your Kimchi's studio to move to Kichij≈çji in Tokyo, Japan the following year, Their video series was renamed Eat Your Sushi, and the channel itself was also renamed Simon and Martina during the rebranding. In 2020, the Stawskis moved back to Canada. Video series Simon and Martina highlights cuisine, lifestyle, and recommended locations from abroad.

The Korea Herald included Eat Your Kimchi in a list of 21 of \\"the nation's most useful websites.\\" On the website Hiexpat.com, it was also voted the best expat blog in South Korea in 2011. Elysabeth Hahm from Yonhap News noted that the Stawskis allowed tourists to gain information from a local's perspective that was not present in guidebooks. On the other hand, David Oh and Chuyun Oh, through the periodical Communication, Culture & Critique, criticized Eat Your Kimchi, describing the Stawskis' approach towards Korean culture as ethnocentric and orientalist.

Very little historical evidence remains about this railway, its original purpose, date of construction or date of closure. Historical evidence The primary source of historical evidence for the existence of the Phnom Krom railway is its appearance on a number of maps. For example, a 1962 US Army Corps of Engineers map of the area shows the railway clearly marked, and its demarcation is as a ‚Äònarrow gauge‚Äô railway, as opposed to standard gauge (which, in keeping with the standard gauge of Cambodia and much of South East Asia, is listed as 1 metre). The railway also shows up in the same position on a number of other maps of Siem Reap from the 1960s. Description of route The railway ran 6 miles (9.5 km) in a south-westerly direction from what was then the western side of Siem Reap town, in a straight line to Phnom Krom. According to the available maps, the northern terminus of the railway was just north of National Highway 6, in what was then a military area. Conjecture on origin, use and removal Though no evidence is known to exist on the origins and use of the Phnom Krom railway, it is possible to hazard some guesses based on the pattern of French colonial railway construction in the rest of South East Asia, and remaining physical evidence on the ground. Origin and use It is most probable that the railway originated as a quarrying railway, transporting stone from extensive quarries on the north eastern and south eastern faces of Phnom Krom (which are still evident, though now defunct) to provide material for the construction of the French colonial administrative centre at Siem Reap. It is impossible to speculate when the railway was constructed, but most likely it would have between around 1890 (when the French were, among other things, undertaking extensive construction in Phnom Penh which also included the use of narrow gauge railways) and perhaps as late as the 1920s, when work on the Grand Hotel D'Angkor was being undertaken (a project which would have required large quantities of building materials). Removal Some maps from the 1960s with the railway marked mark it as disused, as it would almost certainly have been by that time. Again, it is possible the tracks were lifted a lot earlier, and the maps of this time are merely marking a railway that had long since disappeared on the ground, by compiling and copying information from earlier maps. If the track did survive in situ into the 1960s, it would have certainly been removed during the 1970s and the conflict that swept over Cambodia during that decade. Surviving evidence Trackbed The trackbed survives largely intact. Starting at Phnom Krom, most likely the southern terminus of the railway was in a cluster of buildings that are now used by the RCAF, under an old quarry face on the southern side of the hill. It then runs on the road leading to the Tonl√© Sap for a short distance, before turning off to the north and taking a more direct route into Siem Reap. The majority of the length of the trackbed is a raised, red earth embankment, though no original bridges seem to have survived. It enters Siem Reap from the south, where the trackbed becomes a nameless street leading in a straight line leading due northwest, and passes in front (i.e. to the east) of what is now the Angkor Night Market. At the extreme northern end, it seems that the trackbed has been converted through a recent construction project into an open culvert for rainwater run- off, this runs as far as National Highway 6. Where the railway might once have terminated just north of the highway, the modern Hotel Sokha now stands. Rails On Phnom Krom itself is a winding road leading up to a Buddhist monastery, and an Angkorian temple. Lining this road are a series of old lampposts, no longer functional, with cast concrete bases and rails providing the pole. These rails, still extant in 2011, are consistent with gauge narrow gauge rails, and are at any rate far ‚Äòlighter‚Äô than that used for the Cambodian standard gauge of 1 metre. It is impossible to conjecture whether the rail-lampposts were placed there by the railway itself (perhaps an attempt to develop Phnom Krom as a tourist location), or by another party after the railway had ceased to function.

Biography  Eduard Wald, known as Edu, was born in Kiel, Germany, where he attended school. He reached upper school, then received training as a gardener between 1921 and 1923. By 1923, he was already a member of the Young Communist League of Germany and in 1924, he joined the Communist Party (KPD). He soon became a member of the Lower Saxony district leadership, where he was responsible for agitation and propaganda and the Rotfrontk√§mpferbund. In 1926, he became the editor of the Nieders√§chsischen Arbeiterzeitung,Eduard Wald Friedrich Ebert Stiftung Archiv der sozialen Demokratie. Retrieved July 16, 2011 the Lower Saxony workers' newspaper and from 1926 to 1927, he was district treasurer. As editor of the newspaper, between 1926 and 1929, he was convicted of 12 different press violations. In 1929, he went to the Soviet Union for medical reasons, to be cured of a lung condition. On his return, he was active in the educational programs of the KPD. He was a member of the Vers√∂hnler, a group of KPD members critical of the ultra-left policies of KPD leader Ernst Th√§lmann and as a result, in 1929, lost his job in the Party, though he was not expelled until 1930. He was unemployed until 1930, when he got a job at a factory and began to build a regional Vers√∂hnler network both in and outside the KPD. After the Nazi Party seized power in 1933, Wald was forced to go underground. He was able to build a Resistance group called the Committee for Proletarian Unity (Komitee f√ºr Proletarische Einheit).Manfred Wilke (Ed.), Anatomie der Parteizentrale: die KPD/SED auf dem Weg zur Macht Akademie Verlag GmbH, Berlin (1998) pp. 481-482.

He kept in close contact with the Vers√∂hnler group organized by Hans Westermann in Hamburg and the Hannover Socialist Workers' Party under Otto Brenner. In 1934, Wald moved to Berlin, where he work to coordination the various Vers√∂hnler groups around Germany.

Services were originally held at a home at 303 Maria Street. In 1911, the tract of land on which the synagogue was built was purchased for $520 with construction beginning shortly thereafter. The Knesseth Israel Jewish Synagogue, Maria Street at Shipman Street, (1911) was designed by James Augustus Ellis (architect) of the firm Ellis and Connery. It was built with the bartered labour and donated funds of the founding members and their families. The building was dedicated on September 8, 1912 and services began in 1913. At its peak, in the 1920s, the temple served more than 200 Jewish residents in the neighbourhood, with the presence of the synagogue contributing to a dramatic rise in Jewish migrants to the neighbourhood. The building has a modest red brick facade with minimal ornamentation or detail. A double-side staircase leads to two heavy wooden doors. Circular windows on three sides of the building are divided into eighteen segments to symbolize the Hebrew word chai (life). Its interior is decorative and elegant in a traditional Eastern European style. The women's gallery on the top floor is a three-sided upper-level balcony. The lower level of the sanctuary has three sides of seating facing the centre. The ark housing the Torah scrolls is situated against the eastern wall.\\"Congregation Knesseth Israel\\" , Doors Open Toronto description, City of Toronto website. Accessed July 16, 2011. Many of the congregants were artisans, peddlers, shopkeepers or scrap and metal collectors while a large number of residents who were carpenters or cabinet makers found work at the nearby Heintzman & Co. piano factory on Keele Street. A number of these cabinet makers carved much of the synagogue's interior wooden architectural details. The synagogue's only rabbi was Mordechai Langner who served the congregation from 1924 until 1939. Subsequently, services were conducted by a cantor or congregants. Toronto's Jewish population migrated north after World War Two, resulting in the synagogue remaining largely closed except for holidays and special events since the 1950s. Nevertheless, it has a congregation of 80 full-time and 300 associate members most of whom grew up in the area or are descended from the founding members. Philanthropist and arts patron Joey Tanenbaum is the grandson of one of the synagogue's founders and attended services as a boy. He remains a member and funded the synagogue's restoration in the 1990s. The synagogue features on the 2017 movie Stephen King's it.

It had an estimated magnitude of 7.9 on the surface wave magnitude scale and triggered a devastating tsunami that resulted in thousands of deaths in the Nankai and T≈çkai regions of Japan. It is uncertain whether there were two separate earthquakes separated by a short time interval or a single event. It is referred to as a tsunami earthquake, in that the size of the tsunami greatly exceeds that expected from the magnitude of the earthquake. Background The southern coast of Honshu runs parallel to the Nankai Trough, which marks the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate. Movement on this convergent plate boundary leads to many earthquakes, some of them of megathrust type. The Nankai megathrust has five distinct segments (A-E) that can rupture independently, the segments have ruptured either singly or together repeatedly over the last 1,300 years. Megathrust earthquakes on this structure tend to occur in pairs, with a relatively short time gap between them although in the 1707 H≈çei earthquake all segments are thought to have ruptured at once. In 1854 there were two earthquakes a day apart and there were similar earthquakes in 1944 and 1946. In each case, the northeastern segment ruptured before the southwestern segment. In the 1605 event, there is evidence for two distinct earthquakes, but they are not distinguished by all historical sources and some seismologists suggest that only the Nankai segment of the megathrust ruptured. Earthquake There are very few reports of shaking associated with this earthquake, with most historical records only mentioning the tsunami. This has led seismologists to interpret this as a 'tsunami earthquake', probably involving a slow rupture velocity causing little observed shaking while generating a large tsunami. Tsunami The records of this tsunami are quite sparse but the maximum wave heights are larger than those for either the 1707 H≈çei or 1854 Ansei Nankai tsunamis in areas on the south coast of Shikoku where they can be compared. The regional extent of this tsunami is supported by the discovery of tsunami deposits on the northeastern part of the Kii Peninsula and at Lake Hamana correlated to this event. Victims of the tsunami were also reported from Kyushu. Damage There is no reported damage associated with the earthquake itself. At least 700 houses were washed away at Hiro in present-day Wakayama prefecture and 80 at Arai in what is now Shizuoka prefecture. Castles were reported destroyed or damaged at Tahara on the Atsumi Peninsula; the main keep of Kakegawa Castle was also destroyed. The total number of casualties is uncertain as records are incomplete and contradictory, but estimates are in the order of thousands.

The platform consisted of three parts: ActiveDesktop, which would use push technology to deliver the web applications to the desktop; ActiveServer, which would provide server side scripting; and ActiveX, a set of technologies created to allow software components on different machines to communicate with each other using COM and OLE. History The Active Platform strategy started to take shape after the cancellation of another Microsoft project, Blackbird, and as challenges were developing from Microsoft's competitors. Blackbird promised to make web applications function more like those users were accustomed to on the desktop, by using distributed OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) rather than HTML markup. The project was soon scrapped, after Microsoft realized that there were performance problems and it became clear that HTML was gaining in popularity. Meanwhile, Netscape, Sun, Oracle and IBM (referred to as the \\"Gang of Four\\") proposed turning Java into a similar type of distributed object platform that would form the basis of an Internet OS which could compete with Windows. Such an OS would rely on web applications that were run through a browser and constructed using Java software components. In response, Microsoft announced the Active Platform at their SiteBuilder conference in October 1996. ActiveDesktop at first was promised by Microsoft to run on any operating system, but only appeared in Windows, first through the Internet Explorer 4.0 release, and later in Windows 98. Active Server was based on IIS 3.0 and included Active Server Pages, the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), Microsoft Transaction Server, and a new message queuing-based middleware. ActiveX was based on a number of technologies Microsoft had already developed for Windows. ActiveX controls were OLE based controls that could be embedded in web pages, applications, and on the desktop. ActiveX became strongly criticized for security problems, and Microsoft later abandoned further development in favor of the .NET Framework. ActiveDesktop was never widely used and disappeared in newer versions of Windows, the concept only later being readopted in the Windows Sidebar, which was added as a response to the Dashboard feature in Apple's OS X. ActiveServer was later harmonized with the .NET platform and a revamped version of ASP became known as ASP.NET. The Active Platform strategy became the center of a United States anti-trust suit against Microsoft.

He then performed research at the University of Iowa, the Imperial College in London and the Argonne National Laboratory, after which he joined the University of Notre Dame, initially as assistant professor from 1966 to 1969, then advancing to associate professor and, from 1978 onwards, as professor of physics. From 1990 to 1993, he additionally was professor of philosophy at the same university. Cushing's main areas of research were the history and philosophy of 20th century physics and the foundations of quantum theory. He investigated in particular interpretations of quantum mechanics, including the historical reasons for the success of the Copenhagen interpretation over hidden-variable theories or the de Broglie‚ÄìBohm theory (causal interpretation of quantum mechanics).

The exact dates of his reign are disputed by scholars at various times ranging from 1462 to 1465. Life Antony Kokkas was born probably to Western parents and he became a monk. According to Laurent and Kiminas he was elected as Patriarch with the name of Joasaph on 1 April 1462, in a rush the day after the death of Patriarch Isidore II. During his patriarchate he had to face troubles caused by clashes with monks and intrigues of the Greek nobility. The intrigue that led to the tragic end of Joasaph's patriarchate involved the scholar and politician George Amiroutzes, renowned for having persuaded Emperor David of Trebizond to surrender to the Ottomans, and who, along with all the nobility of the former Empire of Trebizond, had moved to Istanbul. George Amiroutzes had become an intimate of Sultan Mehmed II and wanted to marry the beautiful Mouchliotissa, widow of last Duke of Athens Franco Acciaioli, notwithstanding that he was already married and his wife was still alive. Patriarch Joasaph refused to grant his permission because it was a case of bigamy under canon law. George Amiroutzes pressed forward and turned to his cousin, the Grand Vizier Mahmud Pasha Angeloviƒá, who tried to influence the Holy Synod to depose Joasaph. Some scholars propose different details for these events. Irritated by the refusal of Joasaph to allow the new marriage of Amiroutzes, Sultan Mehmed II ordered the Patriarch's humiliation by cutting his beard, and punished also the Megas Ekklesiarches (i.e. Head Sacristan) Manuel, the future Patriarch Maximus III, by cutting his nose. These events led Joasaph to a state of depression which culminated in his attempted suicide: the day of Easter 1463 (10 April) he deliberately threw himself in the cistern beneath the Pammakaristos Church. Joasaph was rescued, deposed and exiled to Anchialos, opening the way for George Amiroutzes to marry his new wife. Disputed chronology The chronology of the reign of Joasaph I Kokkas is disputed among scholars. Recent scholarship, such as Kiminas (2009), Podskalsky (1988), Laurent (1968) and Runciman (1985) place the reign of Joasaph I Kokkas after Isidore II and before Sophronius I, dating it between April 1462 and Easter 1463. Other scholars, following Bishop Gemanos of Sardeis (1933‚Äì8) and Grumel (1958), as well as the official website of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, propose that Joasaph I reigned after Sophronius I and before Mark II, suggesting that his reign begun in early 1465 (or July 1465) and ended in first months of 1466. Blanchet (2001) places the beginning of the reign of Joasaph in summer 1464 directly after Sophronius. Furthermore, there is no consensus among scholars on the length and chronology of the second and third terms of Gennadius Scholarius which supposedly alternated the patriarchates of Joasaph and Sophronius. For a comparison of the main scholar suggestions, see the List of Patriarchs of Constantinople.

Phillips (1943‚Äì1996) was an American founder of the field of architectural conservation. He is credited with coining the term \\"architectural conservation\\" in the early 1970s and was among the first to call himself an architectural conservator.\\"AIC News: the newsletter of the American Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works\\", Vol. 21-22 (1996), p. 20 Phillips worked for most of his career at the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA) in Boston, now Historic New England, and the organization's Conservation Center was largely built around his research and that of his apprentices. Phillips pioneered a number of techniques that would subsequently become standard in the field, including the microscopic examination of historic paint layers, the use of epoxies for wood repairs, and the acrylic consolidation of fragile historic material. He and Andy Ladygo perfected an acrylic injection technique for re-attaching historic plaster walls and ceilings to wooden laths. His contributions to historic paint analysis ranged from developing the technique of 'cratering' using sandpaper (to macroscopically reveal multiple paint layers), to the microscopic evaluation of paint cross-sections in situ and in the laboratory, to techniques meant to reverse the natural yellowing of linseed oil and thus reveal the 'true' colors of historic paints.Phillips, Morgan W. \\"Problems in the Restoration and Preservation of Old House Paints, Preservation and Conservation\\", In Principles and Practices. Proceedings of the North American International Regional Conference, Williamsburg, Virginia, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, September 10‚Äì16. 1972. The Preservation Press, National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States, (1976); Technology and Conservation, vol. 1-4 (1976), p. 16 Phillips was also among the first to investigate the properties of historic mortars, convening a landmark conference on the subject in Boston in 1973. Early career An undergraduate at Yale, Phillips went on to become one of the first graduates from Columbia University's pioneering MA program in Historic Preservation, founded in 1964 by James Marston Fitch. He began his career at SPNEA in the late 1960s as a Curatorial Assistant, and by 1971 was Supervisor of Buildings. With no formal training in science, technology, or craftsmanship, he sometimes referred to himself as an \\"alchemist\\". His expertise in architectural conservation developed largely through self-teaching and contacts made with art conservators, and in response to the necessity of preserving over 30 historic houses, dating from the 17th century to the 1930s, for which he was initially responsible. In time, and particularly as a result of his publications, coupled with the rise of the historic preservation movement in the 1970s, Phillips began to be in demand nationally as a consultant. This led SPNEA to establish a \\"Consulting Services Group\\" in 1974, built largely around his expertise and reputation, but also offering the services of an historical architect, Maximilian Ferro; a preservation scientist, Norman Weiss; and an architectural historian, Rick Detwiller; with David M. Hart as Director of Consulting Services, and initially headquartered at the Society's Harrison Gray Otis House in Boston. Dr. Judith Selwyn, a materials scientist, joined the Group as an intern, as did researcher Sarah Chase. This Consulting Group worked closely, successfully pioneering the concept of multidisciplinary historic preservation services. In February 1977, however, the SPNEA became concerned with the liability of providing professional services as a non- profit, and Maximilian Ferro (under whose name and license all construction contracts were signed), was spun off to form The Preservation Partnership, a private multi-disciplinary firm. Dr. Selwyn followed later, forming her own consultancy in Preservation Science, while Sarah Chase, Rick Detwiller, David M. Hart, and Norman Weiss all pursued successful private practices. Later career By the mid-1980s Phillips had trained or attracted a number of other conservators to SPNEA, including Andy Ladygo, Brian Powell, and Gregory Clancey. The Consulting Services Group became the SPNEA Conservation Center, moved to the Lyman Estate in the Boston suburb of Waltham. Never an administrator, Phillips always concentrated on research and consulting. While the Center continued to be profitable, it never regained the prominence it had when administering architectural projects, and never again enjoyed the full support of the SPNEA, After protracted bureaucratic battles, it eventually closed in the early 1990s. Phillips went into private practice in Canajoharie, New York, but during a trip to examine Mayan ruins in Guatemala, he developed a ringing in his ears that exacerbated his long-standing struggle with manic depression. Phillips committed suicide at his home in Canajoharie, New York, in 1996.Obit., Boston Globe, Nov. 2, 1996 Family Phillips never married. He had an older brother, Reverend Wendell R. Phillips, and a sister, Andre Phillips. His nephew is the musician Jon Lindsay.

Since the 1990s, the group has incorporated the Screg and Sacer road construction firms. Road construction makes up 80% of the group's activities. Additional related activities include road signage, construction, various civil engineering activities including pipe-laying, and rail track construction and maintenance. Colas Ltd is a UK subsidiary. History Colas The product name Colas was given in 1924, derived from the terms 'cold' and 'asphalt'. Fed by local demand, SGE developed production facilities in France in the 1920s, and also exported the Colas product to French North African possessions, Poland, and Romania. By the end of the 1920s, demand was such that SGE sought the partnership of Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell, and the Soci√©t√© Routi√®re Colas company was founded, with two Shell subsidiaries taking two thirds of the stock and SGE the remaining third. Despite its creation during the Great Depression, the company was successful. It developed new bitumen emulsion-derived products and diversified into a wide range of road construction services during the 1930s. During the Second World War, the company, majority-owned by a Dutch firm, was treated as an enemy possession. After the war, the company recovered and became the leading road construction company in France. It expanded into French North Africa, creating full subsidiary operations in Algeria and Morocco by 1950. The Soci√©t√© Parisienne Raveau-Cartier acquired most of Shell's shares in the company in 1958. In the decades following World War II, the company established a strong position in the French market through collaboration with the government transportation ministry. It continued to operate in former colonies in Africa and elsewhere, and began to expand via native subsidiaries in other European countries. It also expanded through acquisitions in France, Belgium (Arboroute), Canada, and established a U.S. presence in Vermont. In the 1980s, still the market leader in France and North Africa, the company acquired Grands Travaux de l‚ÄôEst, the starting point for expansion into countries surrounding the Indian Ocean as well as the diversification into its civil engineering activities. The Bouygues company became the main shareholder in the 1980s, with Colas under Shell/Bouygues jointly holding the Soci√©t√© d'Investissement de Travaux Publics (SITP). French road construction competitors Screg and Sacer were also part of the SITP structure. By the 1990s, the international subsidiaries had been bought back from Shell, and both Sacer (1993) and Screg (1997) became Colas subsidiaries. In 2000, the group acquired Seco Rail,SECO was the Societe d'Etudes et de Construction d'Outillage. followed by AMEC Spie RailAMEC acquired the Spie Batignolles engineering group between 1997 and 2003, including the Spie Rail subsidiary in May 2007. The Colas Rail division was formed in 2007. Sacer The origins of the Sacer company date back to the 19th century and the Anciens Etablissements Brun company, formed through the merger of companies owned by Ga√´tan Brun (son of Pierre-Jean-F√©lix Brun) and Alphonse Brun; the newly created company took steam tractors used to transport agricultural produce and put them into road construction service in between farming seasons. The first road-rolling contract was awarded in 1874. A new automated product, Bitulithe, was developed in 1911. In 1920, the road-rolling entities were spun off into a separate company, Soci√©t√© Anonyme pour la Construction et l'Entretien des Routes (SACER). In the following two decades, the company expanded throughout France and into Algeria and Morocco. In 1969, the Raveau-Cartier investment group (also a Colas stakeholder) took control of Sacer. In 1992, it became a Colas subsidiary, and in 2002 the Sacer holding company merged with Colas and three regional subsidiaries were formed: Sacer Atlantique, Sacer Paris-Nord-Est and Sacer Sud-Est. Screg In 1910 in Blaye, near Bordeaux, France, the JF Humarau & Cie. chemical company (founded in 1898 by Jean-Ferdinand and Louis Humarau) set up a tar distillation factory. In 1917, it became the Soci√©t√© Chimique de La Gironde (SCG), known as \\"La Gironde\\". From 1924, the company began to specialise in road construction products, producing bitumen emulsions by 1926, and operating over ten production plants by 1928.Sources: During the 1930s, the company started road construction, and became the Soci√©t√© Chimique & Routi√®re de la Gironde (SCRG) in 1936. In the next three decades, the company diversified into related business areas, including civil engineering and construction, and in 1964 was renamed Soci√©t√© Chimique Routi√®re & d‚ÄôEntreprise G√©n√©rale (Screg). In 1979, the Screg Routes et Travaux Publics subsidiary was spun off, and during the 1980s Sacer and Colas became part of the same holding group as Screg. Screg Belgium was founded in 1989. During the 1990s, the company became a Colas group subsidiary, and the Screg Routes road construction company became the Screg subsidiary. In 2006, Screg Belgium was renamed Colas Belgium.

West side driveway with arch, Mayo Hall, 2007 External view of Mayo Hall, 2007 Mayo Hall is a government building located in the center of Bangalore. It was built to honor the memory of Lord Mayo, the 4th Viceroy of India. It offers a panoramic view of the city's Parade Grounds and Ulsoor Lake on one side, and the Bangalore Race Course and Brigade Grounds on the south. This two-story structure is known for its ornate furniture and architecture. It is adorned by chandeliers, Greek cornices, Tuscan columns, stone arches, wooden floors and beautiful furnishings. It became a popular tourist attraction. Municipal offices Mayo Hall houses several departments of Bangalore Mahanagara Palike, Bangalore's administrative body. The government's Kempegowda Museum is located on the upper floor. It was established in 2011, and is dedicated to Kempegowda, the founder of Bangalore.The museum has Kempegowda's statue as well as artistic renderings from his time. Originally, the ground floor had the Municipal Office for the Cantonment as well as several public offices and law courts. The upper floor was intended for important public meetings and exhibitions. History Mayo Hall was a part of a larger design to develop the cantonment into an integrated civil and military station. Accordingly, around the mid-1800s, a series of developmental activities began. The army that defeated Tipu Sultan in the 4th Mysore War was relocated from the swamps of Srirangapatana to the more temperate Bangalore in 1809. The crown's administrative staff and the army's families began arriving, after sailing around the Cape of Good Hope. Tradesmen also arrived in this manner and contributed to the westernization of Bangalore. Lord Mayo (christened Richard Southwell Bourke) was appointed the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. In the period 1869‚Äì1872, he traveled extensively in India and was greatly impressed, and stated that Britain should hold India \\"as long as the sun shines in heaven\\". On a visit to Port Blair's prison, Lord Mayo was stabbed to death by Sher Ali, a Pathan life convict, the only Viceroy to be murdered in office. The convict who killed him did so to avenge his father's death in the First Anglo-Afghan War. As a tribute to this administrator, a commemorative building was erected on the South Parade on a flat ground with trees, flowering bushes and a low wall on the south side. Terraced lawns surrounded the two-story building. It cost around 45,000, a sum raised largely through public donations. Mayo Hall was inaugurated by the British Resident on 6 June 1883. The Bangalore District Gazetteer noted that \\"The building in elevation is remarkable for its composition of architrave and pedimented windows, varied with key-storied arches, beautifully executed consoles, balustraded ledges and typical Greek cornice.\\" Inside the building, framed pictures of the British nobility and notable citizens could be found in the hall. On the first floor, Italian chandeliers and ornate furniture were installed. The late Kora Chandy described the Mayo Hall as \\"one of the most elegant public buildings of the era in Southern India.\\" Several Greco-Roman elements and influences are apparent in the building: architrave and pediment windows, key-stoned arches, balustrade ledges, beautiful consoles, Greek cornices, Tuscan columns, and wooden floors. Modern era Mayo Hall stands shorn of its greenery and breathing space. Tall buildings such as the Public Utility Building and the Central Mall are its neighbours. Heavy traffic generates significant sound pollution, and the future of this historical building remains uncertain.

The decomposition of this waste material produces deadly gases, making slurry pits potentially lethal without precautions such as the use of a breathing apparatus with air supply.  Nutrient value  The liquid manure blend, or slurry, can be a rich source of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Risks Slurry pits present risks of drowning, as well as of suffocation. Decomposition generates gases such as ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulphide. The latter two are heavier than air and will not disperse quickly from low places. Carbon dioxide is odorless, and hydrogen sulfide quickly becomes undetectable by odor by destroying victims' sense of smell. If inhaled, they can cause rapid unconsciousness by poisoning or displacement of oxygen leading to hypoxia. Death may follow then from poisoning or hypoxia directly, or by drowning caused by unconsciousness.

Deori was one of the main architects of the ‚ÄúKhasi Darbar Hall Resolutions‚Äù created on 21‚Äì23 March 1945 where indigenous leaders of different ethnic identities resolved resolutions to restore their independent homelands against Indian occupation. His vision was that tribes should have the essence of freedom and independence. His vision was attuned to marginalized communities. He helped found the General Secretary of Assam Tribal League in 1933. He stated that the government was not justified in stopping the remission of land revenue. He worked to ensure that indigenous Assamese people be allotted land . He complained on behalf of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to members into the general dining halls of universities on June 18, 1941, while criticizing improper mass literacy campaigns during the Assam Legislative Council budget session on 9 to 13 March 1943. Under the leadership of Deori and indigenous leaders, Assam (then northeast India) was included in independent India.

Obozersky lies south of Arkhangelsk (by rail). The name of the settlement originates from Lake Obozero, located south of Obozersky. Military airfield Letneozyorsk is located southeast of the settlement. Municipally, Obozersky is the administrative center of Obozerskoye Urban Settlement, one of the eight urban settlements in the district. Population: . History Obozyorsky was established as a railway station on November 29, 1987, when the railway stretch between Vologda and Arkhangelsk was built. Previously, the village of Alexandrovskaya existed at the same location. Alexandrovskaya was known from the mid-19th century. Obozyorskaya was one of the biggest cargo stations of the railway. From 1922, the station was included into Yakovlevskaya Volost of Arkhangelsky Uyezd, Arkhangelsk Governorate. In 1926, it was transferred to Plesetskaya Volost. On July 15, 1929, the uyezds were abolished, the governorates merged into Northern Krai, and Plesetsky District was established. In 1937, the settlement at Obozyorskaya railway station became the administrative center of Yakovlevsky Selsoviet. The urban-type settlement of Obozersky was established by the Decree of the Presidium of the Russian SFSR Supreme Soviet on September 12, 1957. Yakovlevsky Selsoviet was transferred to Obozersky Settlement Soviet. Economy The economy of Obozersky is based on lime production, logging and timber. Obozerskaya Railway station is a part of the Northern Railway. The main railroad here connects Moscow and Arkhangelsk, and another railroad to Onega, Belomorsk and Murmansk branches off to the west. This railroad was built during World War II to secure the transport of goods from the harbor of Murmansk to central Russia. Obozersky is located on the road connecting Kargopol with one of the principal highways in Russia, M8 between Moscow and Arkhangelsk (the highways meet in the village of Brin-Navolok). This is the historic trading route which connected Kargopol with Arkhangelsk before the railroad was built, and long stretches of this road are still unpaved. The military air base Letneozersky is located southeast of the town. Culture and recreation There is the Chapel of the Tikhvin Icon of the Virgin in Obozersky, built in the late 1990s.

Design and development The P2008 is a conventionally laid out strut braced high-wing monoplane aimed specifically at the US market. Resembling the earlier Tecnam P92 and P2004 in general appearance, the P2008 differs by introducing a carbon fibre fuselage and integrated fin. The wings and tailplane are all-metal. It can be adapted to LSA, ultralight or ELA1 categories. The wing leading edge is straight except for some pinching at the root and the wing has constant chord over about the inner 60% of span. Outboard, the trailing edge is tapered; the straight wing tips are slightly upturned. Frise ailerons on piano hinges span the outboard sections and the inner sections are spanned by slotted flaps. There is a single lift strut on each side, attached to the lower fuselage. The P2008 has a low set all-moving constant chord tailplane with an anti-balance tab. The fin is swept and the rudder moves above the tailplane. The P2008 is powered by a Rotax 912ULS flat four piston engine driving a two blade propeller. The cabin seats two side-by side with a door each side and baggage space behind. The cabin and cabin doors are wider than on earlier Tecnam high-wing aircraft. Its fixed tricycle undercarriage has spring cantilever main legs and a castoring, non-steerable nosewheel on a compressed rubber suspension. Ground steering is achieved by differential braking. All wheels have speed fairings. The first flight was on 30 September 2008. Operational history The first P2008 was delivered to the US in December 2009. By November 2010 six had been registered in Australia, Italy, South Korea and the United States.

Challenger was chief engineer of the British & Colonial Aeroplane Company and he designed the glider for Sir George White the company founder. White had the glider built to present to the Bristol and West of England Aero Club after he had been elected president of the club in October 1910. Challenger had previously designed the Bristol Boxkite, strongly influenced by Henri Farman's aircraft, and the Glider followed the same layout. It had a foreplane well ahead of the wings, mounted on wire-braced wooden booms, which also carried the undercarriage of a pair of long skids carrying small wheels. Four booms, tapering together in elevation, carried a single tailplane rather than the pair used by the Boxkite. The foreplane and tailplane moved together to control pitch. A small pair of rudders was mounted between the booms near the tail. Lateral control was by ailerons fitted on the upper wing. The Glider first flew from the landing ground at Keynsham on 17 December 1910, piloted by Challenger. It was hand- towed into the air and retrieved uphill using a two-wheel dolly. It was damaged in February 1911 and repaired but a more serious accident on 4 September 1911 cost ¬£30 to repair. The Glider survived until 1912 but the final fate is not known.

He is generally considered to be one of the most important Czech writers of the twentieth century, since he influenced many of his own and later generations of writers. Yet he is little known outside the Czech Republic. Because of his enigmatic writings he has often been likened to Franz Kafka, although mutual influences can be ruled out with near certainty.Jind≈ôich Chalupeck√Ω: Richard Weiner. Aventinum, V Praze 1947; F. Kautmann: Franz Kafka a ƒçesk√° literatura (Franz Kafka and the Czech literature). In: E. Goldst√ºcker, F. Kautmann & P.

Geburtstag von Kurt Krolop im Goethe- Institut Prag am 29. Mai 2010. (19 July 2011) He has been called \\"the poet of anxiety\\", others spoke of him as \\"the Odd-man out\\" of Czech literature. His contemporary Karel ƒåapek named him \\"the man of pain.\\"  Life  Weiner was born in P√≠sek, South Bohemian Region, Austria-Hungary (now the Czech Republic). His parents ran a distillery and confectionery and Richard, the oldest of five children, was destined to take over the family's business. He studied chemistry at the Technical University in Prague and after graduating in 1906 with a degree in Chemical engineering he went on to take further studies in Zurich and Aachen. In 1908 he served in the military and in 1909 he began working as a chemist in Pardubice, Freising and Allach (near Munich). In 1911, however, and after many sleepless nights, Weiner determined that he would rather try to make his living as an independent journalist and writer. The following year he moved to Paris and started writing as a correspondent for the Czech daily newspaper Samostatnost. Beginning in 1913 he primarily worked for Lidov√© noviny and published his first volume of poetry. While he was on vacation in Prague in the summer of 1914 World War I broke out. He was conscripted for military service and served at the Serbian front. In January 1915 he suffered a nervous breakdown and was discharged from the army. For the rest of the war he worked for various Prague newspapers and published three collections of short stories, among them L√≠tice (Furies, 1916), one of the first Czech books dealing with World War I.William E. Harkins: War in the Stories of Richard Weiner. In: Kosmas 1 (1982), pp. 67-71. In 1919 Weiner returned to Paris once again as a correspondent for Lidov√© noviny. He was to stay in Paris for nearly the rest of his life, only returning to Prague in 1936 when he had fallen seriously ill with stomach cancer.Jonathan Bolton: Weiner, Richard. YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe. (11 July 2011). He died in a Prague sanatorium on 3 January 1937. He was buried at the Jewish cemetery of his hometown. His tomb was wrecked in a pogrom shortly before the outbreak of World War II.Peter Urban: Biobibliografische Notiz In:  Work   Journalist  Weiner's journalistic work focused on French and particularly Parisian politics and culture, but covered everyday life and sensational crimes as well. He reviewed plays, literature, and exhibitions and even wrote a regular column on fashion under a female pseudonym.Vanda Pickett: \\"In Between Reality and Literature. Reflections on the Creation of National Identity in The Journalistic Writing of Richard Weiner\\". p. 2 (Paper presented at the Postgraduate Conference The Contours of Legitimacy in Central Europe. St. Antony's College, Oxford, 24‚Äì26 May 2002.) His style has been described as \\"impressionist\\" by contemporaries. For this reason his work may be difficult to understand now, because Weiner presupposed familiarity with the news of his day.Pickett: \\"In Between Reality and Literature\\", pp. 6-7. \\"But is not his journalistic writing of that time a wonderful source of study of this time- period?\\" his friend and fellow correspondent Gustav Winter asked in his obituary of 1937. \\"This time period with its special fragrance Weiner perceived and interpreted however more by an intuition than hard study. He was proud of it - and rightly so.\\" In her study of Weiner's work, Marie Langerov√° has characterized Weiner's quest as a journalist as that of a \\"destroyer of national myths\\".Pickett: \\"In Between Reality and Literature\\", p.4.  Writer  Weiner's literary work is generally divided into two distinct phases. His first poems and short stories appear to be influenced by the modernist literature of the early 20th century. At the same time he developed his own new poetics under the influence of Charles Vildrac and Georges Duhamel. Whereas Weiner did not publish any literary works for several years after 1919, he started writing prose and poetry once again when he met a group of French surrealists, including Roger Vailland, Ren√© Daumal and Roger Gilbert- Lecomte, who called themselves Le Grand Jeu (The Big Game).Widera, Richard Weiner, p. 56. Between 1927 and 1933 Weiner published three more volumes of poetry, the prose work Lazebn√≠k (The Barber; 1929) and the novel Hra doopravdy (A Game for Real; 1933).Literatur im Kontext - Richard Weiner (in English) Weiner used literature as a means to explore the depths of being, while at the same time consciously reflecting the limits of language as a means of communication. Alfred Thomas argues: \\"Weiner's subtle fiction exposes ‚Äì not the defunct status of language per se ‚Äì but the fragmentation of a unified discourse subtended by a monistic, morally unambiguous truth.\\"Thomas: Labyrinth, p. 106 Referring to Weiner's homosexuality Thomas has also stressed, that Weiner's language is not emptied of meaning as some critics had insisted, but that his stories \\"explore the relationship between identity understood in terms of social morality and identity conceived in the subjective terms of sexuality.\\" With his prose Weiner reached an extreme degree of abstraction. Taking Hra doopravdy for an example, Walter Schamschula has pointed out that this novel consists of two distinct parts which are seemingly not connected to each other. But whereas the content of the first part might be accessible to the reader by viewing it as a dream, the plot is increasingly atomized in the second part. According to Schamschula critics have argued that a rational understanding of this novel is not possible, but he claims that it can nonetheless be accessed by recognizing its elaborate stage of abstraction. In particular, Schamschula stresses Weiner's commitment to the optical and to geometrical structures. Weiner's philosophy might be described as existentialism.Schamschula, Geschichte, p. 305. In his lifetime, Weiner was already viewed as a literary outsider. His works did not sell at all and after his death he fell almost into oblivion. With the exception of a small volume by Jind≈ôich Chalupeck√Ω,Thomas: Labyrinth, pp. 105-6 founder of the Group 42, he became recognized as an important author only in the wake of the Prague spring and particularly after 1989. Until recently, he has not been translated into English.Richard Weiner: a European mind In 2015, an English translation (by Benjamin Paloff) of Hra doopravdy (as The Game For Real) appeared on Two Lines Press.

Example  (from Many nights) Broken where the rainbow spans O¬¥er blissfulness itself, there is a wondrous country where divine courtiers dwell For who else would in a realm reside Which only those can reach Who know to erase the border That divides good deeds and guilt? They see no shining star to light The way to Bethlehem. (A rhyme would say: a blind bird sings To those who are blind as well. The true rhyme claims: a strangely aware vexation in me stays, Here starts the abrupt journey To heights of insanity.) Accomplished leaders, beware! Your lore inspires my fears. You would infuse a poison Into my nourishment. No longer would I comprehend Why all ‚Äì as it is said - Those dwellers leave their destiny The moment it is known And blinding themselves willfully Attempt on waters to walk, while avoiding all the landmass in the search for a walking shore. And why the cosiest shelter Is gained through a heart which burst, the one who thirsts for comfort most Is the counselor best. Why pain is there the landlord, The greatest charity, The timeless wakefulness of God, The breathing space, respite. Like the pipes of an organ, roars The sculptured coral grove, The commotion of anthems tear down the azure vault. Smoke belligerent soars and spirals From pregnant, fertile soil, warmhearted angels whirl around like tempests transfigured. In fits of fury flashes write The eternal chronicle Of fateful tragedies that have No actors or observers. Of fateful tragedies that hold The crushed ones unrelieved, that live on darkness doggedly, Where they cast the beastly claw. Of the unforgiving being Which Minerva cursed in vain. Oh, you clarity wrongly dimmed of the untruly denied word. By opening of a heavy gate (whose rusty doorposts screeched) White water rushes fast into the judgement-storing granaries. The Lamb¬¥s fleece is the water, then at the crack of dawn Some men are rushing forward And collecting up the foam. And conscientious women Woke at the break of day To spin the wool magical With their selfless hands. And who has donned that garment No longer suffers pain, And who has donned that garment Is with fatigue aflame. There mother nurses baby And knows the beloved child, Whose closed, slumbering eyelids Are scorched by spike of creation¬¥s fire, Won¬¥t recognize her at waking, Nor she her offspring know, So she cuddles it still tighter, victorious, joyful seven times, And with a face of marble Invokes the reptile‚Äôs blissful bite That welds the hearts of people In one, in hardness angel-like. There in the coral country, The crazy land, the bluish dome, Where on the serene waters Float uprooted weeds of hope. Translation Jan Dobi√°≈°  Bibliography  * Jind≈ôich Chalupeck√Ω: Richard Weiner.

Within the framework of municipal divisions, it is the administrative center of Oksovskoye Rural Settlement, one of the thirteen rural settlements in the district. Population: . Geography Oksovsky is located on the right bank of the Onega River, several kilometers downstream from the mouth of the Iksa River, the left tributary of the Onega. On the left bank of the Onega, across Oksovsky, the urban-type settlement of Severoonezhsk is located. History The former village of Navolok, close to Oksovsky, is a historical landmark. Before 1926, Navolotskaya Volost existed with the administrative center in Navolok. In 1926, the volost was transformed into a selsoviet, and on July 15, 1929 Plesetsky District was established. The administrative center of Oksovsky Selsoviet was located in the village of Navolok. In 1930, Oksovsky Selsoviet was merged with nearby Paberezhsky Selsoviet, and in 1961, the urban-type settlement of Oksovsky was established, and the selsoviet transformed into the settlement soviet. In 1985, the urban- type settlement of Severoonezhsk was established by splitting it from Oksovsky. In the beginning of 1970, there were plans to build an aluminum production plant close to the bauxite deposits (which were discovered on the left bank of the Onega, currently Severoonezhsk). It was planned that the plant would be served by a city with the population of approximately 100,000, with the name of Severorossiysk, located on both banks of the Onega. The plans were supported by Hungary and Bulgaria, who were interested in becoming the shareholders. The plans have never been realized. Oksovsky had work settlement status until it was demoted to a rural locality in February 2013. Economy Industry The economy of Oksovsky is based on forestry. Transportation Oksovsky (Navoloki railway station) is at the end of the railway line which connects in Puksa to the line between Moscow and Arkhangelsk (Konosha-Obozyorskaya stretch). There is a railway bridge to Severoonezhsk (Iksa railway station) across the Onega, connecting to the railway to the west, to Undozero and Yangory. This line is one of the biggest railways in Russia which does not belong to Russian Railways. The owner of the railway is the State Department of Corrections. Plans to extend this line to Medvezhyegorsk have not been realized. Until the 1990s, the Onega was heavily used for timber rafting and logging, and Oksovsky was one of the points where timber was transported from the river. There is a road connecting Oksovsky to the village of Denislavye located on the highway which is a historic trading route between Kargopol with Arkhangelsk. The highway also connects to Plesetsk. The Onega is not navigable in Oksovsky because of the rapids.

The film was released on August 25, 2011 in select theaters using the Eventful Demand It and Video on Demand via Comcast. The film premiered internationally in Italy via distributor Eagle Pictures under the title ESP Fenomeni Paranormali on June 1, 2011. The trailer for Grave Encounters is considered a viral sensation, generating over 30 million views. Despite its mixed reviews, the film was a box office hit, spawning a sequel in 2012. Plot Jerry Hartfield is the producer of Grave Encounters, a reality television program directed by ghost hunter Lance Preston. Hartfield explains that the show was cancelled after five episodes following the disappearance of its crew, and presents raw scenes from recovered footage of the sixth and final episode. The Grave Encounters crew consists of Lance, occult specialist Sasha Parker, surveillance operator Matt White, cameraman T.C. Gibson, and fake medium Houston Grey. The crew is invited to examine the abandoned Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital, where unexplained phenomena has been reported for years. The hospital warden takes the crew on a day tour and informs them of the hospital's history, particularly of a doctor named Arthur Friedkin, who performed unethical experiments and lobotomies on the hospital's patients before being killed by them. The crew voluntarily lock themselves inside the hospital for the night and begin their investigation, setting up camp near the hospital's main entrance. No paranormal activity seems to occur within the first few hours of the investigation until a door slams behind T.C.. The crew attempts to establish contact with the invisible entities responsible for this demonstration, and the incidents soon become more flagrant and hostile. The crew begins to repack in preparation for the warden unlocking the hospital. Matt goes to recover the cameras, but suddenly disappears. The other crew members spend several hours searching for Matt without success, and the warden has not yet returned. The crew forces the front doors open, but discover that they lead to another hallway, as well as to other false exits. The crew also notes that it is still nighttime outside the building when their clocks indicate that it is well past morning. In their continued search for Matt and an exit, the crew encounters a girl whose face demonically distorts. As the crew flees in fear, Houston is separated from the others and is strangled to death by an invisible force. When the crew catch their breath, they discover that they have been fitted with hospital identification bracelets bearing their names. The crew eventually find Matt, wearing a hospital gown and having gone mad; he mumbles nonsense about his apparent mental disorders, and explains that the only means of escape is to be \\"cured\\" by the hospital's residents. T.C. is pulled into a blood-filled bathtub by a ghost and disappears, while Matt throws himself down an elevator shaft as Lance and Sasha are attacked by a demon. Lance and Sasha enter the tunnels in search of an exit. Sasha falls ill and is abducted by a mist as she and Lance sleep. The terrified and unstable Lance wanders the tunnels alone and feeds on live rats to survive. He finds a door leading into Friedkin's operating room, which contains an altar and evidence of satanic rituals and black magic. He turns to see the apparitions of Friedkin and several nurses, who drag the screaming Lance to an operating table. The camera cuts out for a few moments before it is turned back on by a lobotomized Lance, who proclaims that he is cured and allowed to leave.

The Office of the Mining and Lands Commissioner is an agency of the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) in the Canadian province of Ontario.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/STEL02_168319.html?CSB_ic- name=browseByTopic&CSB;_ic-info=land_Eng The current Commissioner is Linda M. Kamerman. History The Office of the Mining and Lands Commissioner will have been in existence, as of May 2006, in one form or another, for one hundred years. The legislation that deals with the vast mineral resources in Ontario dates back to 1864.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/OMLC/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_163860.html The Mining Convention of 1905 followed on the heels of an exciting silver discovery in Cobalt, Ontario in 1903. It was felt that mining activity needed to be more regulated and that a Mining Commissioner should be appointed to decide disputes between claimants. The result was the Mines Act of 1906. While there had been mining laws in Ontario dating back to 1864, the Mines Act of 1906 was a comprehensive revision and update to those laws. Legislators looking for a suitable template for the Mining and Lands Commissioner turned to the legislation establishing the Drainage Referee (The Drainage Trials Act, 1891) for their inspiration. The major difference between the two was that mining dealt with the disposition of Crown property and associated unpatented rights which had not been dealt with by the ordinary courts while drainage dealt with ordinary property, claims and rights which would otherwise be heard in the ordinary Courts. The original intention behind establishing a Mining and Lands Commissioner was to create a functionary who would deal with disputes under provincial mining legislation. The legislators recognizing that an independent judicial officer was needed (as opposed to ministers) to hear disputes. The presence of such an official would also free up ministers who were having to deal with increasingly time-consuming cases and would offer an accessible and affordable venue for members of the mining industry who obviously needed an adjudicator to quickly and effectively sort out their disputes. The Mining and Lands Commissioner is assisted by deputies and, in addition to being called upon to deal with matters arising under legislation other than the Mining Act, can also expect to hear what used to be called summary conviction cases (now provincial offences).http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/mnr/omlc/MLC%20History.htm Responsibilities Today‚Äôs Commissioner is the first female appointee. In her role as an inferior court of review, the Commissioner is still required to hear disputes under the Mining Act and to carry out the role of ‚Äúultimate interpreter of the Act‚Äù. As in the past, she can still be called on to deal with summary conviction cases (now referred to as provincial offences). Unlike her brethren of the past though, she can expect to deal with legal issues that have become both increasingly complex and costly. And unlike the Commissioners of the first fifty years, she can expect to hold hearings under the Conservation Authorities Act, the Oil, Gas and Salt Resources Act, the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act and the Assessment Act. Changes to jurisdiction aside, the Mining and Lands Commissioner carries on maintaining a rich decision-making tradition that reaches back one hundred years. Perhaps, quoting the 1988 government Green Paper that explained the 1989 changes to the Mining Act can serve to sum things up quite nicely. The resulting legislation closely resembles today‚Äôs version. ‚ÄúThe powers and procedures of the Commissioner under today‚Äôs Mining Act are similar to those of the courts, although proceedings easily accommodate participants without legal counsel and provide quick settlement of disputes. The Commissioner is appointed by Order- in-Council under the Ministry of Natural Resources Act...Recommendation ‚Äì The Mining and Lands Commissioner provides a quick and effective means of settling disputes and accordingly, the Office of Commissioner should be retained.‚Äùhttp://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/mnr/omlc/MLC%20History.htm See also *Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) References External links * Natural Resources ","title":"Office of the Mining &amp; Lands Commissioner"},{"id":"32436029","text":"Robert Morley (died 1632) was an English merchant and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1621 and 1629.

Earliest settlements of the Bosut culture originated from the late Bronze Age Belegi≈° culture.Predrag Medoviƒá, Praistorija na tlu Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 2001, page 114. Large fortified settlements were built on the sites of former settlements that were situated on a higher ground near rivers, on a slopes of Fru≈°ka Gora and Vr≈°ac Mountains, or on the edge of the Titel Hill. Large settlements were mutually interconnected into a chain of common defense. Smaller settlements and farms were located around larger ones. Houses in the fortified settlements were located close one to another and narrow passes existed between them. Defensive trenches were located around settlement walls. Main occupation of inhabitants of Bosut culture was agriculture and animal husbandry. Agricultural tools were similar to ones from the Bronze Age. Main market excesses were made from wheat, meat, and animal skin. These products were sold to Greek traders, who in turn brought luxury goods from south-east Europe, that were purchased by local aristocracy. The silver jewelry was especially appreciated.

He served as commander of United States Army Western Command from 1981 until his retirement in 1983. Education Forrester graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1948, where he was a classmate of Alexander Haig. He also earned a Master of International Studies from George Washington University and a Legum Doctor from Chung Ang University in Korea. His military schooling includes the Armed Forces Staff College, the British Army Staff College and the National War College. Military career Following graduation from West Point in 1948, Forrester had an additional year of infantry training before being assigned to the 350th Infantry Regiment, U.S. Forces - Austria. There he served two years (1950 -1952) as a platoon leader, company commander, and finally as aide to Major General Paul Wilkins Kendall, the commanding general of the U.S. Zone in Austria. In June 1952, Forrester accompanied Kendall to South Korea, continuing to serve as his aide until October 1952. Forrester was then given command of Company E, 2nd Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. The company occupied outposts and conducted company combat raids against North Korean and Chinese forces in the area around Old Baldy and Pork Chop Hill. In March 1953, Forrester's company was attacked while in the middle of a unit night rotation of the outpost on Little Gibraltar. He rallied several platoons and led a night counterattack that after several hours of battle, recovered control of the outpost. Forrester's Korean tour ended in July 1953 when he was again selected by now Lieutenant General Kendall for aide duty in Japan. That lasted until December when Forrester departed to attend the Infantry Officer Advance Course (1954) at Fort Benning, Georgia, followed by assignment to the U.S. Army Military Academy at West Point as tactical officer. In 1956, Forrester was selected for early promotion to Major. The next year he attended the Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. This began a succession of schools and staff duty - a year at the British Army Staff College; two years on the staff at Headquarters, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Paris, France; and in January 1963 the Armed Forces Staff College, Norfolk, Virginia. Forrester returned to troop duty in July 1963 with an assignment as Deputy Commander, 2nd Airborne Battle Group, 504th Infantry, 82nd Airborne Division. He soon became the division Plans and Operations Officer (G3) and played a key role in the division's successful invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965. Next came an assignment as Military Assistant to the Secretary of the Army before attending the National War College (1967). This was followed in August 1967 with assignment to South Vietnam as a plans officer in Headquarters, U.S. Army Vietnam. Forrester was selected for early promotion to colonel, and in February 1968 he was given command of the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. Forrester led the brigade in operations on the coast and in the mountains of Central Vietnam where, among other awards, he was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action. This was followed by another tour on the Army staff in the Pentagon as executive officer to the Army Vice Chief Staff (1969 -1970). In February 1970, Forrester was sent to helicopter flight school in preparation for return to Vietnam an assistant division commander for the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). He arrived at the division's headquarters in May 1970, beginning a senior officer extended tour of 18-24 months, just in time to participate in the Cambodian Incursion (May- June). In October 1970, Forrester was selected to be Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff, Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) at Headquarters, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV). A very brief awards ceremony was held before his departure on leave from the division. It was a rushed affair at which several medals were presented without reading the citations to Forrester. Among the awards was a second Silver Star. Forrester then departed on leave to visit his family in the Philippines. Unknown to him, the Silver Star citation claimed to be for his actions on 9 June 1970 during the Cambodian Campaign. It stated that Forrester was flying in his command helicopter when he directed ground troops in an engagement and came under enemy fire. The helicopter then delivered ammunition to the troops and evacuated wounded. However, enlisted men in the 1st Cavalry Division's awards and decorations office revealed that, lacking specific information and pressed for time, they had been ordered to fabricate the action on short notice so that Forrester could receive the medal before he left the division. Following an investigation that exonerated Forrester from any blame, the award was rescinded and the division chief of staff who instigated the award was reprimanded. Following his return from leave, Forrester continued to serve in his position at CORDS. On his return to the United States in August 1971, Forrester was assigned to a series of senior Army staff director and command positions including the oversight of the amnesty program for Vietnam era deserters and draft evaders. Major commands for Forrester included the United States Army Administration Center at Fort Harrison, Indiana, from 1973 to 1975. He commanded the United States Army Recruiting Command at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, from 1975 to 1978. Prior to his Hawaiian command he commanded the Sixth United States Army at the Presidio, and then the Combined Field Army in South Korea. Among Forrester's decorations are the Army Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit with three oak leaf clusters, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Bronze Star Medal with two oak leaf clusters.

Translations Translations between 1934 and 1937 The first attempts to translate Mein Kampf into Arabic were extracts in various Arab newspapers in the early 1930s. Journalist and Arab nationalist Yunus al-Sabawi published translated extracts in the Baghdad newspaper al-Alam al-Arabi, alarming the Baghdadi Jewish community. Lebanese newspaper al-Nida also separately published extractions in 1934. The German consulate denied it had been in touch with al-Nida for these initial translations. Whether a translation published by the Nazi regime would be allowed, ultimately depended on Hitler. Fritz Grobba, the German ambassador to the Kingdom of Iraq, played a key role in urging the translation. The largest issue was the book's racism. Grobba suggested modifying the text \\"in ways that correspond to the sensitivities of the race conscious Arabs\\", such as changing \\"anti-Semitic\\" to \\"anti-Jewish\\", \\"bastardized\\" to \\"dark\\" and toning down arguments for the supremacy of the \\"Aryan race\\". Hitler wanted to avoid allowing any modifications, but accepted the Arabic book changes after two years. Grobba sent 117 clippings from al-Sabawi's translations, but Bernhard Moritz, an Arabist consultant for the German Government who was also fluent in Arabic, said the proposed translation was incomprehensible and rejected it. This particular attempt ended at that time. Subsequently, the Ministry of Propaganda of Germany decided to proceed with the translation via the German bookshop Overhamm in Cairo. The translator was Ahmad Mahmud al- Sadati, a Muslim and the publisher of one of the first Arabic books on National Socialism: Adolf Hitler, za'im al-ishtirakiya al-wa·π≠aniya ma' al- bayan lil-mas'ala al-yahudiya. \\"(Adolf Hitler, leader of National Socialism, together with an explanation of the Jewish question).\\" The manuscript was presented for Dr. Moritz's review in 1937. Once again, he rejected the translation, saying it was incomprehensible. 1937 translation Al-Sadati published his translation of Mein Kampf in Cairo in 1937 without German approval. According to Yekutiel Gershoni and James Jankowski, the Sadati translation did not receive wide circulation. However, the local Arab weekly Rose al-Y≈´suf then used passages from an original 1930 German version to infer that Hilter deemed the Egyptians a \\"decadent people composed of cripples.\\" The review raised angry responses. Hamid Maliji, an Egyptian attorney wrote: Another commentator, Niqula Yusuf, denounced the militant nationalism of Mein Kampf as \\"chauvinist\\". The Egyptian journal al-Isala stated that \\"it was Hitler's tirades in Mein Kampf that turned anti-Semitism into a political doctrine and a program for action\\". al-Isala rejected Nazism in many publications. Attempts at revision A German diplomat in Cairo suggested that instead of deleting the offending passage about Arabs, it would be better to add to the introduction a statement that \\"Egyptian people\\" were differentially developed and that the Egyptians standing at a higher level themselves do not want to be placed on the same level with their numerous backward fellow Egyptians.'\\" Otto von Hentig, a staff member of the German foreign ministry suggested that the translation should be rewritten in a style \\"that every Muslim understands: the Koran,\\" to give it a more sacred tone. He said that \\"a truly good Arabic translation would meet with extensive sympathy in the whole Arabic speaking world from Morocco to India.\\" Eventually the translation was sent to Arab nationalism advocate Shakib Arslan. Arslan, who lived in Geneva, Switzerland, was an editor of La Nation arabe, an influential Arab nationalist paper. He also was a confidant of Haj Amin al-Husseini, a Palestinian Arab nationalist and Muslim leader in the British Mandate of Palestine, who met with Hitler. Arslan's 960-page translation was almost completed when the Germans requested to calculate the cost of the first 10,000 copies to be printed with \\"the title and back of the flexible cloth binding... lettered in gold.\\" On 21 December 1938 the project was rejected by the German Ministry of Propaganda because of the high cost of the projected publication. 1963 translation A new translation was published in 1963, translated by Luis al-Haj. Some authors claim that al-Hajj was a Nazi war criminal originally named Luis Heiden who fled to Egypt after World War II. However, Arabic sources and more recent publications identify him as Louis al-Hajj (ŸÑŸàŸäÿ≥ ÿßŸÑŸíÿ≠ÿßÿ¨), a translator and writer from Lebanon, who later became the editor in chief of the newspaper al-Nahar (ÿßŸÑŸÜŸéŸëŸáÿßÿ±) in Beirut, and who translated parts of Mein Kampf from French into Arabic in 1963. Al-Hajj‚Äôs translation contains only fragments of Hitler‚Äôs 800-page book. 1995 edition The book was republished in 1995 by Bisan Publishers in Beirut. As of 2002, newsdealers on Edgware Road in central London, an area with a large Arab population, were selling the translation. In 2005, the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, an Israeli think tank, confirmed the continued sale of the Bisan edition in bookstores in Edgware Road. In 2007 an Agence France-Presse reporter interviewed a bookseller at the Cairo International Book Fair who stated he had sold many copies of Mein Kampf. Role in Nazi propaganda One of the leaders of the Syrian Ba'ath Party, Sami al-Jundi, wrote: \\"We were racialists, admiring Nazism, reading its books and the source of its thought... We were the first to think of translating Mein Kampf.\\" According to Jeffrey Herf, \\"To be sure, the translations of Hitler's Mein Kampf and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion into Arabic were important sources of the diffusion of Nazi ideology and anti-Semitic conspiracy thinking to Arab and Muslim intellectuals. Although both texts were available in various Arabic editions before the war began, they played little role in the Third Reich's Arab propaganda.\\" Mein Kampf and Arab nationalism Mein Kampf has been pointed to as an example of the influence of Nazism for Arab nationalists. According to Stefan Wild of the University of Bonn, Hitler's philosophy of National Socialism - of a state headed by a single, strong, charismatic leader with a submissive and adoring people - was a model for the founders of the Arab nationalist movement. Arabs favored Germany over other European powers, because \\"Germany was seen as having no direct colonial or territorial ambitions in the area. This was an important point of sympathy\\", Wild wrote. They also saw German nationhood‚Äîwhich preceded German statehood‚Äîas a model for their own movement. In October 1938, anti-Jewish treatises that included extracts from Mein Kampf were disseminated at an Islamic parliamentarians' conference \\"for the defense of Palestine\\" in Cairo. During the Suez war In a speech to the United Nations immediately following the Suez Crisis in 1956, Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir claimed that the Arabic translation of Mein Kampf was found in Egyptian soldiers' knapsacks. In the same speech she also described Gamal Abdel Nasser as a \\"disciple of Hitler who was determined to annihilate Israel\\". After the war, David Ben-Gurion likened Nasser's Philosophy of the Revolution to Hitler's Mein Kampf, a comparison also made by French Prime Minister Guy Mollet, though Time Magazine at the time discounted this comparison as \\"overreaching\\". \\"Seen from Washington and New York, Nasser was not Hitler and Suez was not the Sinai,\\" writes Philip Daniel Smith, dismissing the comparison. According to Benny Morris, Nasser however had not publicly called for the destruction of Israel until after the war, but other Egyptian politicians preceded him in this regard. The second generation of Israeli history textbooks included a photograph of Hitler's Mein Kampf found at Egyptian posts during the war. Elie Podeh writes that the depiction is \\"probably genuine\\", but that it \\"served to dehumanize Egypt (and especially Nasser) by associating it with the Nazis.\\" References See also *Antisemitism in Islam *Antisemitism in the Arab world *Contemporary imprints of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion *History of the Jews under Muslim rule *Relations between Nazi Germany and the Arab world *Mein Kampf in English *Persecution of Jews in the Muslim world Category:Antisemitism in the Arab world Category:Arab nationalism Category:Mein Kampf Category:Translations into Arabic ","title":"Mein Kampf in Arabic"},{"id":"32436182","text":"Charles George Roebuck (born 14 August 1991) is an English first-class cricketer.

The patient lies on his stomach. In the first picture the injection needle is visible with its tip behind the aorta. The second image shows the distribution contrast with lysis bolus. Sympathicolysis is a procedure for temporary or long-term elimination of sympathetic innervation. It is used to improve blood circulation in the legs or arms. The sympathetic nervous system causes the balance of the autonomic system to lean towards narrowing of blood vessels, with elimination of its function resulting in vasodilatation. Completely blocked arteries are not opened again, but the collaterals are better supplied with blood. To improve the blood circulation to the upper extremities, an anesthetic block of the stellate ganglion is performed. Due to this blockage, in addition to vasodilatation, in the entire innervation area this leads to reduced sweating (anhidrosis) and Horner's syndrome. The latter is a sign of successful blockade. A temporary blockade of the stellate ganglion is performed for e.g. the treatment of advanced complex regional pain syndrome. Surgical elimination of the stellate ganglion (sympathectomy) is a treatment of last resort for Raynaud's disease. The sympathetic plexus can also be blocked in other parts of the body.

It is found off the coasts of northwest Europe, where it lives buried in sandy sediments. Bivalves are molluscs with a body compressed between two usually similar shell valves joined by an elastic ligament. There are teeth at the edge of the shell and the animal has a muscular foot, gills, siphons, mouth and gut and is surrounded by a mantle inside the shell. Description The shell of Fabulina fabula is brittle and flattened and grows to a length of twenty millimeters. The outline is oval but the shell is asymmetric with the hinge slightly off centre and the beaks slightly behind the midline. The anterior dorsal margin curves gently and the anterior margin is rounded. The posterior dorsal margin is straighter and the posterior margin is somewhat pointed. The periostracum is transparent and glossy and the shell is white with tinges of yellow or brown. There is a sculpture of fine concentric lines on both valves and some faint radial ribs on the right valve only.Marine Bivalve Shells of the British Isles. The inner surface of the valves is white, sometimes tinted with yellow or orange. The mantle is white with a fringe of tentacles and the gills are unequal in size.Marine Species Identification Portal Distribution F. fabula occurs off the coasts of north west Europe and Morocco and in the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. It is found from low water level to a depth of about forty metres. In a study off the Belgian coast in 2006, this species was found at a maximum density of over a thousand individuals per square metre.Degraer S., J. Wittoeck, W. Appeltans, K. Cooreman, T. Deprez, H.

Individual molluscs are either male or female and gametes are liberated into the water table during spring and summer. The larvae are free swimming and form part of the zooplankton for from 11 to 30 days. Maturity is reached at a size of about 10 millimetres after 1 to 2 years, and the lifespan is up to 5 years. Ecology The closely related species, Tellina tenuis is found over the same distribution range but the two are not usually in competition as T. tenuis occurs from the middle shore level to a depth of about seven metres.

Life  Charlotte Amalie was a daughter of Landgrave Charles I of Hesse-Philippsthal and his wife, Princess Christine of Saxe-Eisenach. In 1750, when she was 20 years old, she married with the 63-year-old Duke Anton Ulrich of Saxe-Meiningen to whom she gave eight children. The Duke stipulated in his last will and testament that Charlotte Amalie would act as the sole guardian of their sons and regent of Saxe-Meiningen. Anton Ulrich had retired to Frankfurt, away from the family squabbles, and lived there with his family. After her husband's death she first traveled to Philippsthal to await an imperial decision confirming her as guardian and regent. Relatives from Gotha travelled to Meiningen, in anticipation of the inheritance. After the imperial decision confirmed her as regent and first guardian, she could move to Meiningen. When she took over the regency in 1763, the country was financially and economically ruined. With strict austerity measures and reforms, economic reconstruction and promotion of spiritual life, she is considered the \\"savior of the Duchy\\". The appointment of new ministers, like Adolph Gottlieb von Eyben, allowed the central government to effectively function again within one year. With a sophisticated system of savings and financial analysis at the court she attracted the attention of Emperor Joseph II, who appointed her as Director of the Commission to save the even more hopelessly indebted Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen. Since her sons were entitled to rule jointly, she ruled jointly with her eldest son Charles from 1775 to 1782, when George I was still a minor. Her reign was the breakthrough of enlightened absolutism in Saxe- Meiningen; and she raised her sons to continue that policy. She founded the Masonic lodge (\\"Charlotte and the three carnations\\"). In accordance with her last wishes, she was not buried in the royal crypt, but in the town cemetery.  Issue  Charlotte Amalie from her marriage had the following children: * Charlotte (1751‚Äì1827) : married Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1745-1804) * Louise (1752‚Äì1805) : married in 1781 Landgrave Adolph of Hesse- Philippsthal-Barchfeld (1743-1803) * Elizabeth (1753‚Äì1754) * Charles (1754‚Äì1782), Duke of Saxe-Meiningen : married in 1780 Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern (1764-1834) * Frederick Francis (1756‚Äì1761) * Frederick William (1757‚Äì1758) * George I (1761‚Äì1803), Duke of Saxe-Meiningen : married in 1782 Princess Louise Eleanore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1763-1837) * Amalie (1762‚Äì1798) : married in 1783 Prince Charles Henry Erdmann of Carolath-Bytom (1759-1817)  References  * L.

Strathtay Prince Albert (3 July 1910 - unknown), a Bulldog, was the winner of the title of Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1913. He placed third at the show in 1914 and continued to appear at the competition for several years afterwards, winning Best of Breed on several more occasions. Early life Prince Albert was a white Bulldog, with brindle patches around the side of his head. He was originally owned by an officer in the British Army, who sold the dog on when he was transferred to India. It was sired by Chineham Joker, to dam Moston Violet, in Cheshire, England, and was purchased by Alexander H. Stewart of Chicago. Show history He was shown in a single show in his native England, at Chatham Hill where he was defeated by a dog named Centaur. Centaur was imported to the United States around the same time as Albert, being renamed to Dreamwold Centaur. Centaur's string of victories in Britain overshadowed Albert's arrival in the US. When Albert won Best in Show at Westminster, it was seen as a surprise since he was the first non- terrier to take the title, defeating Wire Fox Terrier Vickery Estelle into second place. The other breeds in the final round of judging were an English Foxhound, an American Foxhound, a Manchester Terrier, an Airedale Terrier, a Bedlington Terrier, an Old English Sheepdog, a Doberman Pinscher, a Chow Chow and a Cocker Spaniel. Albert would go on to be beaten twice within four months by his rival, Dreamwold Centaur, including at the Bulldog Breeders' Association of America Show in New York in May. In 1914, he won Best of Breed at Westminster once again. Runner up in the breed competition was another Dreamwold dog, Dreamwold Irish Boy. Fifty dogs made it through to the Best in Show contest at the 1914 Westminster, of which Albert placed third, being bested by Wire Fox Terrier Vickery Fast Freight into second place. Best in Show went to an Old English Sheepdog name Slumber, the first of its breed to take the title. Vickery Fast Freight had knocked out future two time Best in Show winner Matford Vic in the breed competition. In 1915, Albert retained his title of best male Bulldog at Westminster, and went on to win Best of Breed, a feat he repeated in a reduced field at the 1916 competition, and in 1917, where he was described as \\"easily the best\\". However, he did not make it to the final round of judging in that year, as he was once again bested by the Old English Sheepdog, Slumber, at the group stage. Slumber would eventually place second overall in the competition.

Background The Constituent Assembly was set up while India was still under British rule, following negotiations between Indian leaders and members of the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India from the United Kingdom. The provincial assembly elections had been conducted early in 1946. The Constituent Assembly members were elected to it indirectly by the members of these newly elected provincial assemblies, and initially included representatives for those provinces which came to form part of Pakistan, some of which are now within Bangladesh. The Constituent Assembly had 299 representatives, including nine women. The Interim Government of India was formed on 2 September 1946 from the newly elected Constituent Assembly. The Indian National Congress held a large majority in the Assembly, with 69 percent of all of the seats, while the Muslim League held almost all of the seats reserved in the Assembly for Muslims. There were also some members from smaller parties, such as the Scheduled Caste Federation, the Communist Party of India, and the Unionist Party. In June 1947, the delegations from the provinces of Sindh, East Bengal, Baluchistan, West Punjab, and the North West Frontier Province withdrew, to form the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan, meeting in Karachi. On 15 August 1947, the Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan became independent nations, and the members of the Constituent Assembly who had not withdrawn to Karachi became India's Parliament. Only 28 members of the Muslim League finally joined the Indian Assembly. Later, 93 members were nominated from the princely states. The Congress thus secured a majority of 82%. Jawaharlal Nehru took charge as the first Prime Minister of India on 15 August 1947, and chose 15 other members for his cabinet. Vallabhbhai Patel served as the first Deputy Prime Minister until his death on 15 December 1950. Lord Mountbatten, and later C. Rajagopalachari, served as Governor-General until 26 January 1950, when Rajendra Prasad was elected as the first President of India. Ramachandra Guha, \\"India After Gandhi\\", Picador India, 2007.  Cabinet members  Lord Mountbatten swears in Jawaharlal Nehru as the first Prime Minister of India on 15 August 1947. There were members from Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh and Parsi communities represented in India's first ministry. There were two members from the Dalit community represented as well.

It consists of nine floors and forms part of a complex consisting of the larger Plantation Place to the north. The building was designed by the Arup Associates architects' group. Plantation Place South was first proposed as a new area of office development in 2001 and construction work began in 2002; it was completed and opened two years later. Plantation Place South is located at the corner of Great Tower Street and Mincing Lane, near the Tower of London and Fenchurch Street railway station. Its main entrance and postal address is at 60 Great Tower Street, although workers may also enter the building from Plantation Lane, a pedestrianised alley between Plantation Place and Plantation Place South. Plantation Lane is the home of an art installation, \\"Time and Tide\\", created by Simon Patterson. The installation, which is frequently visited and photographed by tourists, chronicles the history of London from times of the Romans to the modern age. Tenants of Plantation Place South include insurers AXIS, Beazley Group, Liberty Syndicates, and Sucden. These insurers operate in what is known as the London Companies' Market, which alongside Lloyd's of London offers large commercial insurance and reinsurance to the global market. The location of the building, within an easy walk of the Lloyd's building and many other brokers and insurers, is an attractive force for the aforementioned companies and others operating within this market.

Bishop Mazzolari was born Feb. 9, 1937 in Brescia, Italy. He joined the Comboni Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus, and on 17 March 1962 was ordained a priest in San Diego, USA. His mission brought him to Cincinnati, in the United States, where he worked among African American and Mexican American miners. In 1981, in response to the invitation of Bishop Joseph Gasi, he was appointed by his Comboni Congregation to the Diocese of Tombura-Yambio then the south-central Archdiocese of Juba, Southern Sudan. He was then aged 44. In that diocese, he worked in Nzara parish as curate and as Spiritual Director at St. Joseph‚Äôs Minor Seminary at Rimenze, Yambio. From there, he went to Juba to serve as Comboni Provincial of Southern Sudan for six years. In 1990, he was appointed Apostolic Administrator of the war-torn Diocese of Rumbek (Southern Sudan). He re-opened missions and negotiated humanitarian assistance and the freedom of very young slaves. That same year, he helped free 150 child slaves. He rebuilt the Diocese of Rumbek, after the two Southern Sudanese Secession Wars (1955‚Äì1973 and 1983‚Äì2005) had devastated the country and the Government of Khartoum had expelled all foreign missionaries from the country in the 1960s. In 1991, he reopened the mission of Yirol, the first of many, some of which subsequently had to be abandoned during the protracted Second Sudanese Civil War. In 1994 he was captured and held hostage for 24 hours by guerrillas of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the separatist armed group fighting against the Khartoum government. On 6 January 1999 he was ordained a bishop by Pope John Paul II.Independent Catholic News: \\"South Sudan: Peacemaker Bishop Mazzolari has died\\" July 17, 2011Vatican Radio: \\"Catholic Diocese of Rumbek: The death of Bishop Caesar Mazzolari\\" July 19, 2011Cincinnati Herald: \\"Comboni Bishop Caesar Mazzolari dies\\" July 18, 2011.

He went on to be instrumental in the design of Rover's revolutionary Land Rover off-road vehicle which was launched at the Amsterdam Motor Show in 1948. After the Land Rover, Bashford was involved in the development of a series of David Bache styled Rover cars, including the P4, as chief designer of chassis and body for the P6 and as designer of the SD1 which won European Car of the Year in 1977. Bashford also played a key role, along with Spen King, in the development of the 1970 Range Rover. Bashford retired in 1981.

FPBS works with PBS and NPR member stations, along with state and local groups, to deliver education based outreach projects and provide high quality programming.\\" FPBS has a total of 14 member stations that covers 99% of Florida viewers, as well as some viewers in Georgia and Alabama. History The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 established The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, defined its board and purpose, and appropriated funding. This stemmed from a failed amendment of the Communications Act of 1934 that attempted to reserve 25% of the radio airwaves to educational nonprofit usage and a 1945 decision by the Federal Communications Commission to set aside 20 of 100 FM channels for noncommercial radio. Legislative Act In 1973 the Legislature created the Florida Public Broadcasting Program System as described in 73‚Äì293, Laws of Florida. The system is administered by the Department of Education pursuant to rules adopted by the State Board of Education. The System‚Äôs purpose is to maintain high quality broadcasting capability for public television stations and public radio stations. The stations which compose the system are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission to local communities, school boards, community colleges, or the Board of Regents. State funding is provided to assist qualified public broadcasting stations with operations, equipment, production and program distribution, construction of station facilities and a statewide interconnection system. Today in the Legislature In 1973, \\"Florida Public Broadcasting\\" (FPB), a joint venture between WJCT-TV (Jacksonville) and WFSU-TV (Tallahassee) began program coverage of the Florida Legislature, which was transmitted to and broadcast by the eight affiliated PBS television stations in Florida, from a mobile facility located on the grounds of the State Capitol. The program was called Today in the Legislature, and was the first of its kind in the United States, preceding Legislative programs in other states, and U.S. Congressional coverage by C-SPAN. Reaction to the first year of Today in the Legislature was positive. The state legislature dedicated funds to expand the program, managed exclusively by WJCT-TV.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC- IDX/74-OCR/1974-08-19-BC-0068.pdf Production facilities were moved inside the (old) Capitol building, with engineering and studio facilities constructed on the third floor. The first broadcast from the new facility was on April 2, 1974. Today In The Legislature became a 60-minute program produced Monday through Friday during the legislative session, with a one-hour Spanish language summary, Hoy en la Legislatura produced on Fridays. There was also a weekly sign language program. The first year, the program was anchored by Elizabeth \\"Bib\\" Willis, with George Meyer, a veteran newspaper writer. Beginning the second year, the on air talent was provided by veteran broadcaster Jim Lewis, with additional scripts and interviews by Elizabeth \\"Bib\\" Willis. Research, engineering, and production crews were composed chiefly of recent graduates from the FSU department of communications, now Florida State University College of Motion Picture, Television and Recording Arts, nearly all under the age of 25, including Producer Elliott C. Mitchell, Director John P. Leu, and future Georgia Legislator Chesley V. Morton, as still photographer and cameraman. Today in the Legislature was described as a \\"unique blend of television of record and more conventional news coverage.A research study concluded that Today in the Legislature generated more positive attitudes about the legislature and increased political knowledge in adolescents who viewed the broadcast, although only 12% found the programming to be \\"interesting\\". Controversy The member stations of Florida Public Broadcasting receive national and state funding, as well as contributions from local businesses, viewers and listeners. This funding goes toward broadcasting local programming, as well as programming from PBS, NPR, CPB, BBC, ITV, and others. In May 2011, Florida Governor Rick Scott vetoed $4.8 Million from Public Broadcasting, claiming that it is an unnecessary investment towards a special interest group. The money cut will slash funding from thirteen radio stations by an average amount of $61,715 and all Florida Public Television Stations by an average of $307,447. Some critics have questioned his use of \\"special interest\\" for a medium that promotes arts, education, and news with the intention to \\"deliver education based outreach projects and provide high quality programming‚Ä¶[with the mission of] strengthen[ing the] community, empower[ing] families and‚Ä¶educat[ing] the public\\". These cuts emphasize the role of the executive branch in policy making and legislative advocacy. Despite a multitude of petitions against the decision (26,000 on at least onehttp://signon.org/sign/keep-public- broadcasting.fb1?source=s.fb&r;_by=298763) and a State Senate Funding guarantee, the veto ultimately won. This also came as a shock to the public broadcasting stations that saw the Senate approve a continuation of funding in 2010 and 2011, http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2011/0164/BillText/Filed/PDF as well as perplexing to those curious as to how Public Broadcasting could be lumped into the same category as other special interest groups. The initial intention of creating a non-private sector of radio was to create an alternative to the corporate interests of the private radio sector.

It was released as a flip book alongside Chris Priestly's teachers tales of terror for World Book Day. The novella is set in London and introduces street urchin Smiff, policeman Anders, and a young Anna Fang. The story was later expanded into the short story titled \\"Traction City Blues\\" as part of the Night Flights short story collection, released in July 2018. Plot summary Smiff is an orphan who lives on the lowest tier of London and scavenges for items which have fallen through the cracks from higher tiers. Whilst searching in London's womb for items he witnesses a murder where the attacker has removed the right hand. Whilst not a fan of the police Smiff goes to the airdock green police station where a teenage Anna Fang has just been arrested by corporal Nutter as an Anti-Tractionist saboteur for carrying an explosive device. Smiff explains about the murder to Sergeant Anders who alongside Nutter leaves to investigate the murder and come across the culprit which turns out to be a stalker. Meanwhile, constable Pym searches the records for similar incidents and find several reports about accidents which have occurred within a fortnight where the right hand has been removed and concludes that they weren't accidents but murders by the same killer. Anders and Nutter return to the police station where Anna Fang explains that she has been following the stalker called The Collector who she wants to recruit to the Anti-tractionist cause. When asked why she feels The Collector wouldn't just attack her she talks about Shrike another stalker who is a bounty hunter who refuses to harm children (like her). Concluding that it is highly likely that this is true given the fact that Smiff survived his encounter with The Collector he decides to use Anna as bait to give himself and Nutter enough time to strap the explosive device she was found with to the stalker. Along the way they find a dead apprentice engineer with a missing right hand who is younger than Anna Fang. They are surrounded by a group of Engineers who are a powerful guild in London. The Engineers explain that they brought The Collector on to London in order to see if they could use stalkers as soldiers but lost control of The Collector. Afterwards the head of the engineers orders the death of the two police officers and Anna but Smiff who had followed Anders throws a tin and shouts explosive scattering the engineers giving the group time to run and get find cover. The engineers who have regrouped and are charging towards the group are killed by The Collector who proceeds to chop of the right hands and see if they are a suitable replacement for its own missing hand. Concluding that the right hands aren't a match The Collector heads towards the group but Anders begins trying to talk to it hoping to sacrifice himself to give the other time to escape but as he steps out he remembers Anna's explosive which they had bought along and talking to The Collector he manages to distract him long enough to strap the explosive to him and escape. Afterwards he allows Anna Fang to escape telling her to travel to the Anti- Traction league and allowing Smiff to stay at the station. Reception The book has an aggregated rating of 4 stars on Goodreads.
