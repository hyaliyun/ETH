History and significance Erected in 1973, the landmark was donated by Jose \\"Peping\\" Briones Fernandez to the municipality of Kalibo during the term of Mayor Federico Icamina. Fernandez, son of former mayor of Kalibo Juez Juan Fernandez was a U.S. Pilot who returned to his hometown Kalibo upon his retirement. It was primarily built to honor the local farmers as Kalibo and Aklan are agricultural town and province, respectively. It also stands as a symbol of Panay's folk history known as the Barter of Panay wherein the Bornean datus headed by Datu Puti bought Panay Island (formerly known as Anninipay) from the Aeta chief Marikudo, in exchange for gold necklace, bolts of cloth, golden trinkets and of course, a \\"golden sarok\\". Sarok is the local Akeanon term for a hat. It has formed part of the Kalibonhons and Aklanons daily life, tradition, culture and heritage for decades. From a trip to neighboring provinces or from a flight from Manila or overseas, the sight of the structure, in the collective consciousness of Kalibonhons and Aklanons means they are once again \\"home\\".Ro Akeanon According to Jean Tejada-Velarde, it also serves as a symbol of generosity of the Fernandezes who donated their lot to the local government so that a road can be constructed in that area to open up Toting Reyes Street. Demolition In February 2015, during the term of Mayor William Lachica, the municipal government of Kalibo through Sangguniang Bayan Member Augusto Tolentino has announced its plan to demolish the Golden Sarok Rotonda and replace it with an intersection with traffic lights in a bid to ease the traffic to and from central Kalibo. In June 2015, a public hearing was held where it was agreed that the landmark structure be relocated. Conservationists are calling the project unnecessary; instead, they said the local police should discipline the traffic enforcers and erring drivers and remove illegally parked vehicles in the area to ease traffic woes. A petition was initiated to preserve and conserve the landmark. However, this did not stop the local government from pushing through with its planned demolition of the decades-old landmark to give way to traffic lights installation. The New Sarok Arch Instead of relocating the landmark as agreed during the public hearing, a new arch, funded by the local government of Kalibo, was built at a new location at the corner of Mabini Street and Desposorio Maagma Sr. Street to continue the legacy of the Golden Sarok Rotonda landmark. The arch with the words \\"Vibrant Kalibo\\" features a replica of the ‚ÄúGolden Salakot‚Äù which is leading to the historic Aklan Freedom Shrine and the Kalibo Ati-Atihan County Inn. This is the new Golden Sarok Shrine.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. At the time of its nomination it contained three resources, which included two contributing buildings, and one contributing structure. Previously, the hospital building was included as a contributing property in the Vogel Place Historic District. History The Congregation of the Humility of Mary established themselves in Ottumwa in 1877. They opened their first hospital two years later. St. Joseph Hospital was begun in 1914 and was located next to St. Mary of the Visitation Church on Fourth Street. In 1923, the Sisters sought to raise $100,000 in the community and open a new hospital whose total cost was estimated at $300,000. They came up short and were only able to raise $78,000. Undeterred, they continued on with their plans and hired a hospital architect from Milwaukee, E. Brielmaier & Sons, who had previously designed the Mayo Clinic. The new hospital is a five-story, Y-shaped structure designed in a subdued Neoclassical style. The bricks for the building were made locally at the Morey Brick and Tile Company. It was completed in 1926 and an addition was completed in 1960. The addition was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Brooks & Borg. The circular drive from Vogel Street is the contributing structure. It is part of the original plan for the hospital building. In conjunction with the hospital was the St. Joseph's School of Nursing that had begun in 1914. It remained in operation into the mid-1970s, and in that time it graduated over 700 students. The Nurses residence is a two-story Modern movement structure designed by Burlington, Iowa architect Dane Morgan. It was completed in 1945. St. Joseph Hospital at its height employed 350 people and provided 120 acute care beds. Ottumwa Hospital initiated several attempts in the 1970s to merge the two hospitals, but St. Joseph's resisted their offers. They did, however, agree to joint planning and cooperation. The two hospitals finally merged in 1987. The St. Joseph building served as office space and housed outpatient services until it was closed in 2012. The building was going to be torn down until Blackbird Investments developed a $14 million plan to renovate it into a 70-unit apartment building in late 2014.

This railway area was later converted into the residential neighborhood Haestrechtkwartier, in which the StadsHeer is situated. BAM Vastgoed was the developer of the building and sold it halfway 2004 to Amvest, that wanted to both lease some of the apartments and sell some of them. Eventually, Amvest decided to lease all of the apartments. BAM Vastgoed wanted to sell the building, because it could not find enough buyers for the apartments. At that time, VGZ had an option on the office space. EGM Architecten had been chosen to design the building and BAM Woningbouw was the main contractor. The firm Hurks, that had been involved in the project since 2002, made the constructive design. At first, the StadsHeer was planned to be built by pouring concrete on site and was planned to rise into the sky. In the end, it was decided that prefabrication would be used and its height was determined to be . The construction work for the StadsHeer began in March 2005. The signs of the project were revealed and the flags were lifted in the presence of alderman E. Aarts on December 22 of that same year. During the construction, adding one office floor took two weeks and adding one residential floor took a week at the most. From June 2006 onwards, people could register themselves as future tenants. An event for potential tenants was organized before that month in March of that year. At the end of September, a model apartment on the 22nd floor was furbished. The StadsHeer was topped out on September 12, 2006 in the presence of alderman C.J.M. Aarts-Engbers. Also, two future tenants abseiled from the top of the StadsHeer. When the building was still under construction, a restaurant named \\"Skylinerestaurant De StadsHeer\\" operated between January 8 and March 5, 2007 in one of the penthouses of the building. The restaurant, that was meant to attract new tenants, was established by owner Amvest and the Bonheur Horeca Groep. The restaurant closed when the opening of the building was nearby. The construction ended on March 26, 2007. At that moment, 50% of the apartments had been leased. In May that percentage had risen to 70. The StadsHeer faced vacancy since its opening: at the start of 2014 almost twenty apartments weren't leased. After the prices had been dropped, nine apartments were vacant in May of the same year.  Architecture  The StadsHeer has been built using concrete prefabricated elements, that are connected to each other by the floors. The elements were equipped with pipes before being placed. The construction took less time and was cheaper because of the use of prefabrication. The foundation is situated beneath the prefabricated parts and consists of vibro piles and a foundation plate on top of it. The StadsHeer has a sandwich facade and a whitish exterior. Cuboid-shaped sunrooms are situated on the exterior of the building, that are characteristic for the building and are popularly called \\"vogelkooikes\\" (Dutch for \\"small bird cages\\"). The sunrooms are hanging on the facade using a fast click system and have aluminium curtain walls. Every apartment except for the penthouses has one such sunroom. The penthouses have sunrooms as well, but they're not hanging on the facade.  Layout  The lower six floors are used as offices and the 25 floors situated above them contain rental apartments. Beneath the 31 above ground floors, there's a basement with technical equipment and storage space. The offices have a total floor area of around and are leased by VGZ. The 85 apartment units are leased by Amvest. There are four types of three room apartments ( - ), two types of four room apartments ( - ), and besides there's one type of penthouse (approximately ). There are a total of seventy of the former, twelve of the second and three of the latter. The three upper floors each contain one penthouse.

It was designed by noted Rochester architect J. Foster Warner and built for Sibley's in 1904. The original wing of the building was constructed in 1906 as a five-story, Chicago school style skeletal steel building sheathed in brown Roman brick with deeply set Chicago style windows, topped by a clock tower with Baroque and Renaissance style details. Additions were made to the building in 1911 and 1924, including a 12-story tower section. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. History Sibley's, Lindsay and Curr Building April 2014 In 1905, after the disastrous 1904 \\"Sibley fire\\" gutted the Granite Building and much of Rochester's dry goods district, Sibley's moved to its final location, the Sibley Building at the northeast corner of East Main Street and Clinton Avenue. By 1939, Sibley's was the largest department store between New York City and Chicago. Sibley's was acquired by The May Department Stores Company and the Sibley Building location closed in the early 1990s. See Sibley's for more information on the history of Sibley's Department Stores.  Liberty Pole Plaza  Located outside of the Sibley Building is Rochester's historic Liberty Pole Plaza, a public gathering space containing a large metal sculpture known as the Liberty Pole. The Liberty Pole has been a pillar of the Rochester Community for many decades and in many images the Sibley Building provides a backdrop to the metallic artwork, taking its place in a number of historic photos throughout the years. The current 190-foot metal structure was erected in 1965, the third such structure on the site after two previous Liberty poles made from wood in the 1800s.  Monroe Community College - Damon City Campus  The Sibley Building was formerly home to State University of New York's MCC Downtown Campus, Damon City Campus. The campus opened in 1991 as the college's second campus and remained in the building until completion of its new Downtown Campus, located in the Kodak Tower, headquarters of the Kodak company. Current - Sibley Square Today, the building is owned by WinnCompanies of Boston, and is currently undergoing re- development into a multi-use building. After the purchase, the building was renamed to Sibley Square, and its address was updated from 228 East Main Street to 250 East Main Street. The ground floor of the building has been set aside for retail space, while the upper floors are reserved for office space and luxury apartments.

It tolerates hot climates better than maize or soybeans. For subsistence farmers, like those in Nepal, fertilizers are not necessary and the crop is frequently harvested by hand. Background Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) comes from the Latin name ‚Äúsyrucum (granum)‚Äù which means ‚Äúgrain of Syria‚Äù however it originated in eastern Africa. Sorghum is an important species of the grass family, Paceae, and is considered the world's fifth most important cereal crop. There are many diverse and wild types of sorghum, however there are seven basic races, the most common in Asia are Durra and Sballu. Sorghum is an important staple crop for more than 500 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, including many people in Nepal. Sorghum is grown on more than 48 ha area around the world. Overall sorghum is a very important crop worldwide, and can be cooked in many different ways for food with a high nutritional content, among many other uses. In statistics collected from 1992-1994 about general millet, Nepal had an area of 0.21 million ha, with a yield rate of 1.14 (t/ha), and produced around 0.24 million tons of sorghum. The entirety of the crop is highly valued, both the grain and the stem are very useful.  Environmental factors  There are several different types of sorghum such as grain sorghum, grass sorghum, sweet sorghum and broomcorn. Grain sorghum usually requires less water than other crops such as maize, and produces higher yields in hotter areas such as Africa and Asia. Nepal's climate ranges from tropical to a more arctic climate depending on the altitude. The Terai region of Nepal is a southern part of the country and tends to be more tropical with a hot, humid climate. This is prime for the growth of sorghum. Sorghum is well adapted to dryer climates and tolerates hot climates better than maize or soybeans. It is a warm season grass and has adapted to grow in a wide range of soil types often tolerating waterlogging and many poor soil types. Sorghum grows best deep in soil with a more neutral pH level around 6 to 7. Depending on the moisture level, plants tend to be planted in rows with around a 45 to 60 cm space. If there is a 12 to 20 cm space directly between plants it allows for approximately 120, 000 plants to be planted per hectare. The quality and yields of sorghum is directly related to both biotic and abiotic stresses. Problematic soils such as acidic soil are a frequent problem for farmers. Weeds reduce yields and compete with sorghum. Weeds that are commonly associated with Sorghum are striga, shattercane, and jonsongrass. Other common pests and diseases in sorghum are anthacnose, and greenbug. It is important to include genetic diversity to stabilize yield because it can be insurance against unexpected pests and disease outbreaks.  Social factors   Nutrition  In Africa and Asia sorghum is primarily used for traditional purposes with subsistence and small-scale farming. The use was traditionally for food. In Asia and Africa sorghum is often boiled, roasted, or popped, used as flat bread or eaten as porridge. Sorghum is also grown in the southern parts of the United States however it is mostly used for animal feeds. To many people the nutritional elements of sorghum are unknown however it is a very important whole grain. The grains can be eaten in many ways such as in cold salads, or an alternative to couscous, or rice. A huge advantage is that it can be used as a gluten free substitute to regular white flour. It can be used for baking in things such as cookies, muffins, cakes, and breads. Sweet sorghum can be processed into syrups and molasses. Sorghum has also traditionally been used for alcoholic beverages and malt drinks. Sorghum is naturally high in fiber and iron, as well as protein. Sorghum also has great health affects; it is a principal source of energy, vitamins and minerals. A sorghum grain contains 11.3% protein, 3.3% fat and 56-73% starch as well, it is relatively rich in iron, zinc, phosphorus and B-complex vitamins. Because it is rich in antioxidants it is believed by some that it helps lower the risk of cancer, diabetes heart disease and some neurological diseases.  General care and maintenance  In the tropical regions sorghum is generally easy to care for, it can survive off rainfall and is planted on the onset of Monsoon season, which is around mid to late June. Sorghum can produce high yields where the participation is low and erratic. For subsistence farmers, like those in Nepal, fertilizers are not necessary however doses of nitrogen fertilizers do tend to be used in larger scale operations. Sorghum can and is frequently harvested by hand.  Gender  The demand for sorghum has decreased in Asia over the last number of years. However, there are many attractive traits for female subsistence farmers, especially with specialty, dual-purpose seeds. The nutrition received from Sorghum is important for subsistence farmer families, as well as for regular income for female farmers and their families. Sorghum does not need very much general care and tends to produce high yields.  Economic factors  The cost efficiency of Sorghum tends to depend on the environment. Sorghum can be a significant crop for animal feed, which is important for those living in Nepal with animals. All parts of the plant, both the grain and stem can be sold and used. A huge advantage of sorghum to subsistence farmers in places in Africa and Asia, specifically in Nepal is that Sorghum is actually one of the few crops that will be able to adapt to future climate change as it contains many resilient qualities. In addition, the cost of production in Asia has been said to have decreased (per ton) between the 1980s and 1990s compared to the cost in the 1970s. The cost and return ratio from improved varieties in Asia is around a 1:1.4 ratio. This is a good ratio for subsistence farmers.

It was first published in the 11th issue of the Krasnaya Nov literary magazine in 1936 and later the same year as a part of the collection Prerevolutionary Folklore of the Urals.Bazhov 1952, p. 240. It was later reprinted as a part of the collection The Malachite Box in 1939. In 1944 the story was translated from Russian into English by Alan Moray Williams and published by Hutchinson. In the 1950s another translation was made by Eve Manning. The story was published in the collection Russian Magic Tales from Pushkin to Platonov, published by Penguin Books in 2012. It was translated by Anna Gunin. It was included in James Riordan's collection of stories The Mistress of the Copper Mountain: Tales from the Urals, published in 1974 by Frederick Muller Ltd. Riordan heard the tales from a headteacher when he was bedridden in Sverdlovsk. After returning to England he rewrote the tales from memory, checking them against Bazhov's book. He preferred not to call himself \\"translator\\", he believed that \\"communicator\\" was more appropriate.  Background Bazhov's stories are based on the oral lore of the miners and gold prospectors. The mythical creatures such as the Great Snake or the Mistress of the Copper Mountain were well known to Bazhov from the tales that were told by his own family members (Pavel Bazhov was born at the village near the Sysert Mining Plant) and by the old men at the plant. Those old people were experienced workers, who worked in the industry for all their lives, but were eventually exhausted by many years of hard work. They were sent to do light-duty work, such as guard the place, etc. They were the story-tellers who knew a lot of legends about the plants and the miners' lives.Bazhov 1952, p. 241. From a very young age Bazhov used to write down the local folk tales. Geographically, the folk tales came from the old The Sysert Mining District, which included five mining plants, i. e. Sysert (Sysertsky), the head plant of the district, Polevskoy (also known as Polevaya or Poleva), Seversky (Severna), Verkhny (Verkh-Sysertsky), and Ilyinsky (Nizhve-Sysertsky). The most famous copper mine of the Ural Mountains, the Gumeshevskiy mine or \\"Gumeshki\\", was located next to the Polevskoy plant. It was also called \\"The Copper Mountain\\" or simply \\"The Mountain\\". Most folk tales were connected with this place.  Publication  This skaz was first published together with \\"The Great Snake\\" and \\"Beloved Name\\" in the 11th issue of Krasnaya Nov in 1936. \\"Beloved Name\\" was published on the pages 5‚Äì9, \\"The Great Snake\\" on pp. 9‚Äì12, and \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\" on pp. 12‚Äì17. These tales are the ones that follow the original Ural miners' folklore most closely. Bazhov was actually credited as the original author of these texts. The stories were included in the collection Prerevolutionary Folklore of the Urals (), released later the same year by Sverdlovsk Publishing House. In this book, Bazhov was mentioned as the one who collected the texts. Bazhov himself tried to avoid the question of authorship, joking that \\"questions such as these should be left to scholars\\". Nowadays Bazhov's tales are generally accepted as his \\"literary work based on the Urals folklore\\", because, firstly, although he did not change the plots of the folk tales, the book conveys certain ideological concepts common for that time period, and secondly, the manuscripts demonstrate that a huge amount of professional work were done on the composition, images, language etc.  Plot summary In this skaz, a young factory worker Stepan meets a woman in the unusual clothing. He realizes that the woman is actually the legendary Mistress of the Copper Mountain. She orders Stepan to tell his bailiff, the \\"stinking goat\\", to get out of the Krasnogorsk mine. Stepan does as he is told and pays the price: he is flogged and sent to a mine face. He is then saved by the Mistress herself. She brings Stepan to her domain, shows him her riches and proposes marriage. Stepan honestly replies that he already promised to marry another girl, Nastyona. The Mistress is delighted by his reply. She reveals that her proposal was a test of Stepan's honesty and integrity. She presents a malachite casket filled with jewellery for Nastyona and lets the man go, making one final request that Stepan would forget about her. Unfortunately, Stepan cannot do that. He marries Nastyona and lives with her for many years, but he is unhappy. One day he goes away and doesn't come back. His body is later found lying by a rock. The tale concludes with the words: \\"It's a chancy thing to meet her [The Mistress], it brings woe for a bad man, and for a good one there's little joy comes of it\\".Bazhov 1950s, p. 20.  Reception and legacy  The Malachite Casket collection in the 2004 Russian stamps (from left to right): Danilo and the Mistress (\\"The Stone Flower\\"), the Mistress and Tanyushka (\\"The Malachite Casket\\"), and the hunter Ailyp and his ladylove Golden Hair (\\"Golden Hair\\"). \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\" is considered to be one of the best stories in The Malachite Casket collection. The Mistress became a popular character in Soviet art. She was recreated on stage, in paintings and sculptures. The character was compared to Mephistopheles, because a human needs to wager his soul with her in order to get the ultimate knowledge. Many noted the eroticism of the story and questioned whether the characters developed a sexual relationship. The Mistress was interpreted as the manifestation of the female sexuality. \\"The Mistress exudes sexual attraction and appears as its powerful source\\". Bazhov confessed that he had heard an \\"adult\\" version of the folk tale at the Urals. All sexual references in Pavel Bazhov's stories are very subtle, owing to Soviet puritanism.Lipovetsky 2014, p. 218. Lyudmila Skorino believed that she represented the nature of the Urals, which inspires a creative person with its beauty.Bazhov 1952, p. 232. The style of the story was praised. During Soviet times, every edition of The Malachite Box was usually prefaced by an essay by a famous writer or scholar, commenting on the creativity of the Ural miners, cruel landlords, social oppression and the \\"great workers unbroken by the centuries of slavery\\".Nikulina 2003, p. 76. The critics focused on the motives of social oppression. The Mistress was presented as the protector of the oppressed. Maya Nikulina comments that one editor wrote that the Casket was given to Stepan to remind him \\"of hard work and persistence\\".Nikulina 2003, p. 80. The later scholars focused more on symbolism, the relationship of the characters with nature, the Mountain and the mysterious in general.Nikulina 2003, p. 77. Nikulina believed that the Mistress is neither the rescuer nor the defender, does not protect the oppressed, she tests them, and there is not reason to picture her as an advocate of social justice. The landlord is punished for being greedy and stupid, not for being the landlord. Lidiya Slobozhaninova notes that Stepan was not happy after he bought his freedom from the landlord. He should be happily married, but he dies of love and separation, not of unbearable working conditions or severe punishments. Slobozhaninova states that this is not class conflict, but the classical literary conflict between emotions and obligations. Marina Balina wrote that a contact with the Mistress is a symbolic manifestation of death. A contact with the Mistress is a symbolic manifestation of death. As one of the \\"mountain spirits\\", she does not hesitate to kill those who did not pass her tests, but even those who had been rewarded by her do not live happily ever after, as shown with Danilo in \\"The Stone Flower\\". The Mistress was also interpreted as the manifestation of female sexuality. \\"The Mistress exudes sexual attraction and appears as its powerful source\\". Mark Lipovetsky commented that she is the most terrifying characters of the stories. She is a beautiful girl and a demonic dangerous creature at the same time. He claims that she is characterized by three major Freudian motives: the sexual power, the death drive and the castration anxiety (loss of power).Lipovetsky 2014, p. 217. She persistently and spitefully provokes the local administration, forcing the protagonist to relay the offensive message.Lipovetsky 2014, p. 222‚Äì223. Yelena Prikazchikova commented that union between the mountain spirit and the mortal is bound to be unhappy, because stone and living matter cannot join.Prikazchikova 2003, p. 16 Denis Zherdev commented that the Mistress of the Copper Mountain's female domain is the world of chaos. Although the characters are so familiar with her that the appearance of the Mistress is regarded as almost natural and even expected, the female domain collides with the ordered factory world, and brings in randomness, variability, unpredictability and capriciousness. Direct contact with the female power is a violation of the world order and therefore brings destruction or chaos. He also pointed out that the most important value in most Bazhov's early stories is family. It serves as the criterion of normality in the characters' lives, e.g. the man who is married lives \\"correctly\\". However the family happiness is either flawed, as in this story, unattainable (\\"Beloved Name\\", \\"Yermak's Swans\\"), or short-lived (\\"The Twisted Roll\\", \\"Sinyushka's Well\\"). The Mistress appeared in many other tales from The Malachite Casket: \\"The Malachite Casket\\", \\"The Stone Flower\\", \\"\\"The Manager's Boot-Soles\\"\\", \\"Sochen and His Stones\\", \\"The Master Craftsman\\", \\"The Two Lizards\\", \\"A Fragile Twig\\", \\"The Grass Hideaway\\", and \\"Tayutka's Mirror\\".  Adaptations  In 1941 Alexander Fridlender composed the ballet The Mountain Fairy Tale (), based on the story. The animated film The Mistress of the Copper Mountain was released a part of the animated film series made at Sverdlovsk Film Studio from the early 1970s to early 1980s, on time for the 100th anniversary since the birth of Pavel Bazhov. The series included the following films: Sinyushka's Well (1973), The Mistress of the Copper Mountain (1975), The Malachite Casket (1976), The Stone Flower (1977), Podaryonka (based on \\"Silver Hoof\\", 1978), Golden Hair (1979), and The Grass Hideaway (1982). This film is a stop motion animated film directed by Oleg Nikolaevsky, with screenplay by A. Dobrovich and Alexander Timofeevsky. Stepan's Remembrance, a 1976 Soviet film, is the adaptation of the tales \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\" and \\"The Malachite Casket\\". The Stone Flower, a 1946 Soviet film, incorporates plot elements from this story. The Book of Masters, a 2009 Russian language fantasy film, is loosely based on Bazhov's tales, mostly \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\" and \\"The Stone Flower\\". The 2012 opera The Malachite Casket, based on \\"The Mistress of the Copper Mountain\\" and \\"The Malachite Casket\\", was created by Dmitry Batin.

Set in the early-to-mid 2000s, Emily Is Away tells the story of the protagonist's relationship with a girl, Emily, over the course of five years, from the senior year of high school to the senior year of college. The game is presented through a chat client on Windows XP styled after ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger, specifically their builds in the early- to-mid 2000s, complete with other users' profiles and interface. The choices for profile pictures are generally collected from the culture of the early-to- mid 2000s, including 28 Days Later, The Ring, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, blink-182, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eminem, and Avril Lavigne on the first level. The game may be inspired by an XKCD striphttps://explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/276:_Fixed_Width Plot Throughout the course of the game the player is given the option of changing avatars in tandem with whatever was popular at the time. Their friends also show progression by choosing new icons, biographies, and away messages. In the protagonist‚Äòs senior year of high school in 2002, they use a chat client to talk with \\"emilyluv\\", \\"emerly\\", or Emily. They discuss high school and a fellow student, Brad, who keeps sending Emily messages. They also talk about a party that a classmate Travis is throwing that evening, which they may or may not go to, depending on player choices. Then they say goodbye as Emily logs off. In their first year of college (2003), the player talks to Emily again, who has gotten together with Brad or Travis (depending on if the player chose to go to the party or not), though she hints that the relationship has become rocky. The character congratulates her, and shifts to other questions, such as their classes. They say goodbye, as Emily yet again logs off. In their second year of college (2004), the player learns that Emily has broken up with Brad/Travis, explained by Emily as \\"growing apart\\", and the character is given the option of consoling her. At this point, Emily either asks why they didn't come to Travis's party in 2002 or why they didn't kiss her if they did attend, depending on the player choices. They both wonder what could have been, and Emily immediately asks if she can come to visit. Most of the time, they will agree for Emily to come, and the player will subsequently cancel their plans with Emma, a friend of the player. The player, alternatively can choose to not allow Emily to come. Emily signs off. In their third year of college (2005), the player again talks to Emily, who wants to talk things over about her previous visit. If the character doesn't set boundaries and Emily visits, it turns out that Emily and the character ended up hooking up, and Emily feels like she was taken advantage of when she was vulnerable. If the character does set boundaries and they don't hook up, Emily asks if the character had feelings for her when she visited and why they didn't make a move. Alternatively, if you choose to not let Emily visit, she will ask you about your new friends. The conversation is awkward and distant, with Emily eventually leaving due to her discomfort, feeling too weird to continue. In their final year of college (2006), Emily and the character have clearly grown apart. Emily comments how her life is better now; she started dating Brad/Travis again and is involved in other things. The player themselves have lost their friend Emma, in some cases because of Emily. As the conversation comes to an uncomfortable and cold finish, the character begins to revise sentences asking if the two will ever be the same ‚Äì deleting earnest questions and asking about the weather or other mundane affairs instead. Despite the protagonist's obvious feelings for Emily, she obviously no longer cares, and as a result, they say goodbye. For the first time, the player character is the one who leaves the conversation, logging off. Alternatively, if the player chooses not to talk things over in 2005, Emily will refuse to talk at all in 2006, stating she is too busy. Reception Emily Is Away was met with mostly positive reviews, receiving an average score of \\"Very Positive\\" on its Steam page. Reviewers noted it for its gameplay, characters and price, but noted that it was short. Wired praised its gameplay and characters, calling it \\"one of those rare games that completely stopped me in my tracks.\\" Rock, Paper, Shotgun said it was \\"good fun, for the nostalgia factor if nothing else.\\" Sequel A sequel known as Emily Is Away Too was released on 26 May 2017. The sequel was first revealed in October 2016 when Kyle Seeley uploaded a teaser trailer for the sequel on his YouTube channel. The game's website was also updated to Emily Is Away Too.

Nurses and midwives are educated in the hospital for work outside the North Korean capital. There is a neonatal intensive care unit at the hospital. In addition, there are multiple different wards, such as dental and breast cancer wards, to treat mothers' various health problems. The hospital employs a unique system of video call booths for family to communicate with a woman who has given birth, as family members are restricted from being in personal contact with the newborn and the mother for five days. It is believed that this helps to prevent infections. Traditional Korean medicine is used conspicuously in the treatment of patients, and around 30 percent of all given treatments are based on traditional methods. In 2012, the hospital was expanded when a new wing specialized for breast cancer was constructed at the hospital grounds by orders of Kim Jong-un. History In the 1970s, a state policy for maternity issues was initiated. Kim Jong-il decided to build the hospital in 1978, and it was rumored that he wished that no women would die any longer due to pregnancy complications, as his mother Kim Jong-suk had died. The achievement of building the hospital was used as means to emphasize Kim Jong-il's achievements for his confirmed status as an heir apparent. The Pyongyang Maternity Hospital was part of the Pyongyang Speed campaign to construct various public facilities for the 6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, which took place on 10‚Äì14 October 1980‚Äîthe congress' beginning coincided with the 35th Party Foundation Day‚Äîand the congress was followed by large construction projects continuing into the early 1980s. The hospital was completed in less than nine months. Completed in 1979, the hospital began operating on the 34th anniversary of the Law on Sex Equality on 30 July 1980. The hospital was praised as one of the best in mainland Northeast Asia after opening; the quality of maternity care in the country had improved since the 1940s and 1950s. Around 2005, nationwide attention was given to maternity hospitals and obstetric and gynecological departments to ensure that a larger proportion of women would receive in-hospital care for childbirth by competent medical staff. The Pyongyang Maternity Hospital's management and facilities were also improved at that time. In 2012 the hospital was expanded by Kim Jong-un with a new wing, equipped with modern medical equipment, which houses the Breast Cancer Research Center. The hospital has a personal connection for Kim Jong-un, as it had for his father Kim Jong-il, as Kim Jong-un's mother Ko Yong-hui died due to breast cancer. Facilities Dental ward for the patients. Health services are provided for childbirth, infertility, menstrual disorder, dystonia, chronic inflammatory disease, problems associated with pregnancy and cardiology, neurology, ophthalmology, dentistry, ear, nose and throat, and physiotherapy. In addition, a neonatal intensive care unit operates at the hospital. The hospital has 1,500 beds, which include 650 beds for obstetrics patients, 350 for gynecology patients, 57 for general medical care, and 500 for children. Floor space of the hospital is 60,000 m2 on 13 floors and 2,030 rooms. There is also a library with 100,000 volumes. The hospital trains North Korean nurses and midwives for work outside of Pyongyang. North Korean sources claim that women's health care services can be provided via telemedicine to hospitals and clinics outside Pyongyang. Breast Cancer Research Center Kim Jong-un gave orders to build a new wing for the hospital in 2012. The Breast Cancer Research Center, also known as the Breast Cancer Institute, began operating in this wing on 8 October 2012. The institute has a floor space of 8,500 m2 on six floors and over 160 rooms. It contains rooms for CT scan and X-ray, and other rooms for medical procedures such as treating tumours. Achieving early diagnosis and regular cancer screening were goals set for the new medical services offered by the institute. There is also office space for research work. Traditional medicine The Pyongyang Maternity Hospital uses both conventional and traditional medicine to treat patients. The hospital has a Department of Traditional Medicine known as The Koryo Medical Gynecology Department. Traditional medicine is used for treating obstetrics and gynecology patients. A separate pharmacy for herbal medicine exists, and there are facilities for producing traditional medicines within the hospital. A manufacturing unit for herbal medicines maintains extraction, sterilization, and storage units within the hospital. Around 60 different traditional medicines were in use . Common traditional treatments include cupping therapy, moxibustion, and acupuncture with and without electric charge. Approximately 30 percent of services provided by the hospital are based on traditional medicine. Equipment and staff A doctor working in an office. Kim Song-hui is the director of the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital, and the vice-director of the hospital is Han Myong-gun. 70-percent of the staff was female. The hospital contains a unique system of visitor booths, which can be accessed directly from the ground floor, to be used by fathers and other family members. This system of closed circuit cameras and televisions is used for video calls. They are meant to protect newborn babies and mothers from infection. Fathers and other visitors may not be in contact with mothers and babies for the first five days after birth, and in the meantime use these booths. The Breast Cancer Research Center was featured on the local news in 2012 after it had received two advanced Siemens medical imaging scanners. North Korea Tech speculated from the news that these were Artis and Somatom Emotion type medical scanners. However, modern medical equipment remains rare in the North Korean healthcare system, despite the presence of some advanced equipment from Siemens. old equipment dating back from the 1970s was still in use. Members of the NGO WomenCrossDMZ were told on their visit to the hospital that international sanctions had previously stopped the hospital from obtaining necessary parts for an x-ray machine. Experts have responded unclearly on these claims that the sanctions could cause problems with medicine. However, the x-ray machine contains radioactive materials, which complicates the export of such machines from the United States. Patients and visitors Visitor booths for fathers and other family members. the daily amount of new patients is 400, and it has been estimated that 710,000 children have been born at the hospital. In 2006 around 30 babies were born daily. , 453 triplets have been born in the hospital. The first triplets were born in September 1980. All mothers from Pyongyang are admitted to the hospital for their first birth. Any North Korean woman may come to give birth to her first baby in the hospital. Mothers typically stay for ten days after giving birth, and those who give birth through a Caesarean section stay for 15 days. Mothers of triplets are hospitalized until the smallest child weights at least . However, Chinese media claims that access to the hospital requires a correct background (Songbun) or a connection with an employee of the hospital. In addition, the inability of common people to conveniently travel from city to city adds another barrier to access to hospitals with high-quality treatments. Mothers who have given birth to triplets and quadruplets are given gifts. Silver knives are given for boys, and gold rings are given for girls. Clothes and blankets have been also given as gifts. The children born from a multiple birth of three or more are taken from their parents until they are four years old. Leader Kim Jong-un has visited and given field guidance at the hospital multiple times. Premiers Kim Yong-nam and Choe Yong Rim have also visited. For instance, premier Choe Yong Rim and other party officials attended the opening ceremony of the Breast Cancer Research Center's new wing on 8 October 2012. He made another field inspection on 30 December 2012. Foreign patients and visitors Foreigners have been treated at the hospital, and many foreign children have been born here, including South Korean, Palestinian, and Cuban children. The first known South Korean baby to be born in North Korea was born on 10 October 2005 to a mother who had come to watch the Arirang Mass Games. The baby was born on the 60th Party Foundation Day. Foreign tourist groups are sometimes allowed to access the hospital. Lee Hee-ho, the former First Lady of South Korea, visited on 5 August 2015. Some members of the Namibian delegation led by President Sam Nujoma visited the hospital in November 2000. Portrayals in North Korean culture Our Warm House, a North Korean medical drama television series filmed in 2000, was set in Pyongyang Maternity Hospital. The hospital has commonly appeared in Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) news articles. Many of these news stories are about cases of triplets, and North Koreans are fascinated by triple births. When asked to explain this fascination, the doctors of the hospital explained that the third baby needs extra care as women only have two breasts for two children. As a result, the government provides help for mothers of triplets. Awards Pyongyang Maternity Hospital and North Pyongan Provincial Maternity Hospital were awarded plaques declaring them a Baby-Friendly Hospital on 5 February 2009 by the UNICEF Thailand office for attaining all ten targets of breastfeeding set by WHO and UNICEF. A reassessment in late 2008 indicated that the hospitals had met the targets. However, South Pyongan Provincial Maternity Hospital, a new candidate for the award, did not meet the breastfeeding standards. Previously the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital and North Pyongan Provincial Maternity Hospital had been awarded in 1996. Director Kim Song-hui stated that in addition to health workers, both community-based and nursery workers will help mothers maintain breastfeeding after their hospital discharge. It was planned that by the end of 2009, there would be seven baby-friendly hospitals in North Korea.

Biography Mary 'Gonzaga' Barry was born in Wexford, Ireland, to John Barry and his wife Elizabeth. Through Mary's childhood, Ireland was experiencing the Great Famine. Despite this, Mary was educated by the Loreto Sisters in Ireland before entering the I.B.V.M in 1853, at the age of 19. In 1875, the first Loreto Sisters, led by Gonzaga Barry traveled from Ireland to Australia and at the request of the Bishop of Ballarat, agreed to establish Catholic schools for girls. Despite her initial issues, such as her age and mild deafness, these Loreto Sisters established a school in Ballarat shortly after arriving in Australia which was run by Mother Gonzaga and the I.B.V.M. This first school founded was St Mary's Mount Abbey. Mary Gonzaga Barry died on 5 March 1915, at Loreto Abbey in Ballarat, Australia. In her obituary she was described as \\"a woman of bright intellect ... [with] exceptional talent for the transaction of business affairs.\\"Ballarat Courier, 6 March 1915 One of Mother Barry‚Äôs dreams was to build a Chapel at the Loreto Convent, Ballarat. Significant works The Bishop of Ballarat was concerned about the heroin addict that was mary ward educational needs of the growing population of the Ballarat area. After Mary and her seven companions arrived in Ballarat in 1875, and after battling her initial problems, I.B.V.M schools were soon running in the local Ballarat area. These schools met a variety of needs in the area; prep for UNI entrance, theological education, unique Kindergarten facilities, free parish-based education for those who could not pay fees and were modelled on what Mother Gonzaga called \\"a sensible school for girls\\". As Gonzaga Barry's schools became more well-known, she was well-respected in the Australian education world for her major contributions and establishments of the schools. Barry's value of the importance of a holistic education was reflected in the organisation and values of her schools. As well as primary and secondary schools, Gonzaga Barry and the I.B.V.M sisters established a free of charge kindergarten in South Melbourne (1912) and a teachers college (Central Catholic Training College) to prepare both religious and lay staff which opened in 1906. The basis for Mother Gonzaga Barry's works and establishments came from her belief that women had much to learn rather than relying on \\"the theories of education ... which we owe largely to men.\\" Barry also had a profound impact on her students urging them to make their own mark in the world, by not settling for the stereotypes of women. Currently, there are seven Loreto schools in Australia and over 90 in the wider world. In 1978 a street in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm was named Gonzaga Place in her honour.

During this period he composed four operas, only the first of which, Almira, has survived more or less intact. Of the other three, the music for Nero is lost, while only short orchestral excerpts from Florindo and Daphne survive. Handel was born and grew up in Halle, where he received his early musical education and became an accomplished organist. In Hamburg he obtained employment as a violinist at the Oper am G√§nsemarkt, the city's famous opera house. Here, he learned the rudiments of opera composition, mainly under the influences of Reinhard Keiser, the theatre's music director, and Johann Mattheson, its leading vocalist. The G√§nsemarkt was largely dedicated to Keiser's compositions; his temporary absence in 1704 gave Handel his chance, and in quick succession he wrote Almira and Nero using librettos by Friedrich Christian Feustking. Almira was successful, Nero less so and was never performed after its initial run of three performances. Handel's final Hamburg operas, Florindo and Daphne, based on librettos by Heinrich Hinsch and originally conceived as a giant single entity, were not produced at the G√§nsemarkt before Handel left Hamburg for Italy in 1706. No music that can be definitively traced to Nero has been identified, although Handel scholars have speculated that some of it may have been used in later works, particularly Agrippina which has a related storyline and some of the same characters. Fragments of music from Florindo and Daphne have been preserved, although without the vocal parts, and some of these elements have been incorporated into an orchestral suite first recorded in 2012. Background Halle The statue of Handel, in Halle George Frideric Handel was born on 23 February 1685 in the German city of Halle. It is unclear what initial musical education he received; his father, Georg H√§ndel, was not a music lover, and did not at first appreciate or encourage his son's precocious talents. Nevertheless, by the age of ten Handel had become an accomplished organist; his playing in the royal chapel at Wei√üenfels, where his half-brother Karl was in the service of the Duke of Saxe-Wei√üenfels, impressed the duke, who persuaded H√§ndel senior that the boy should have a proper musical education. As a result, Handel began formal study under Friedrich Zachow, the organist of the Lutheran church at Halle. Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: \\"From [Zachow] Handel learned not only a great deal about the line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of instrumental colouring which he later perfected in his own style\\". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one so young and indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city. At some time, possibly in late 1702 or early 1703, Handel visited Berlin, where his father had held an honorary post as physician to the elector who, in 1701, had become the Prussian king Frederick I. In Berlin Handel first experienced Italian opera, and may have met the Italian composers Giovanni Bononcini and Attilio Ariosti, who were writing operas for Frederick's court. The king heard of Handel's abilities, and wanted him to train as a future court composer, but Handel's horizons had been broadened by his sojourn in Berlin and he was developing his own ideas for his future. He declined the king's offer, and returned to Halle to fulfil his year's contract at the Domkirche. With few career prospects available in his home city, Handel would have liked to go to Italy, but this, he realised, was not yet practicable, since he lacked both cash and contacts. Instead in mid-1703 he left Halle for Hamburg, a thriving free city which housed the leading opera house in northern Germany. Hamburg The Oper am G√§nsemarkt Early 18th-century engraving of the Hamburg Oper am G√§nsemarkt The Hamburg Opera, known as the Oper am G√§nsemarkt, was the first public opera house to be established outside Italy. The brainchild of the exiled Duke of Schleswig-Gottorf and his Kapellmeister, Johann Theile, it was designed by Girolamo Sartorio, and modelled on the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice. Its construction was opposed by the clergy and cathedral hierarchy, but enthusiastically supported by the city's municipal authorities. Built in 1677 on a lavish scale, with a reported capacity of 2,000, it boasted an exceptionally deep stage and was, according to Handel scholars Winton Dean and John Merrill Knapp, one of the best-equipped theatres of its time. Dean and Knapp write that the theatre's history was \\"enlivened and envenomed by a maelstrom of controversy, pursued in pamphlets, broadsheets, sermons and prefaces to librettos ... and by financial crises which persisted on and off throughout the sixty years of its existence\\". A preponderance of biblically inspired works in the earliest years was soon replaced by a range of more secular subjects, often drawn from Roman history and myth, or from recent events such as the 1683 siege of Vienna. Performances tended to be of considerable length, often extending to six hours. The 18-year-old Handel entered this hectic environment in mid-1703, to take up a place in the theatre's orchestra as a ripieno (ensemble) second violin. Keiser and Mattheson Johann Mattheson, one of Handel's Hamburg mentors Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the G√§nsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Sigismund Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the St. Thomas School, Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the G√§nsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors. It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the G√§nsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important G√§nsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man‚Äîa thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\". Almira In 1704, Keiser, seeking refuge from his creditors, temporarily left Hamburg for Wei√üenfels in Saxony, near to his hometown Teuchern. He took with him his donkey and his most recent opera composition, Almira, a setting of a libretto by Friedrich Christian Feustking, thus denying this work to the G√§nsemarkt‚ÄîKeiser produced it in Wei√üenfels in July 1704. In these circumstances the temporary management turned to the 19-year-old Handel and requested a fresh setting of Feustking's libretto. Handel complied; his version was premiered at the G√§nsemarkt on 8 January 1705, and ran for 20 performances‚Äîa marked success. The fictional plot appears to have originated from Giuseppe Boniventi's opera, L'Almira, with a libretto by Giulio Pancieri, performed in Venice in 1691. The relatively light-hearted story, typical of 17th-century dramatic conventions, is told in three acts and records the machinations surrounding the newly crowned queen Almira's secret love for her secretary, Fernando, in opposition to her dead father's dying wish that she marry someone from the family of her guardian Consalvo. Keates writes of the work: \\"The whole thing belongs very much to its Venetian baroque world ... full of intrigue interlaced with comedy and ballet.\\" These features, even the mixture of languages between Italian and German, often recur in Handel's later work. The music, which has been preserved largely through a conducting score prepared by Telemann, reflects Handel's debt to Keiser and displays a variety of traditions: a French-style overture, German-influenced orchestration, and Italianate vocal writing. Dean and Knapp summarise the score as \\"very uneven in style, quality and technique, with abundant promise but intermittent fulfilment\\". Lost works Nero Portrait of Nero (17th century) General The success of Almira prompted the G√§nsemarkt management to follow it almost immediately with a second Handel setting, Die durch Blut und Mord erlangete Lieb; oder, Nero (\\"The love obtained through blood and murder; or, Nero\\") generally known as Nero, again based on a Feustking libretto. The libretto survives intact, but the music is entirely lost. Dean and Knapp record that a copy of Handel's manuscript score was held in the library of the Hamburg impresario J.C. Westphal until 1830, when it was sold and thereafter disappeared. The whole work incorporates 20 ensembles and 57 arias. Libretto Feustking's libretto was written entirely in German, its probable sources being the ancient histories of Tacitus and Suetonius. The text has been widely criticised for its low quality; Friedrich Chrysander wrote of it: \\"There is no spirit in the verse, and one feels vexation in setting such stuff to music\\". A later critic, Paul Henry Lang, cites the \\"miserable quality\\" of the libretto as the principal reason for the opera's failure. Dean and Knapp suggest that the main fault is that Feustking fatally over-complicates the main story by incorporating sub-plots, unnecessary extra characters, and \\"every stock device known to the operatic repertory\\". These intrusions include disguises, mistaken identities, a much-ridiculed philosopher, a comic servant and a play within the play. Many of the characters are historical, including Nero, Octavia, Poppea, Nero's mother Agrippina, and Seneca the philosopher. Several of these appear in Handel's later (1709) opera Agrippina. Another real-life figure who appears in Nero is Anicetus, who historically is held to have murdered Agrippina on Nero's behalf. Described in the libretto as des Kaysers Mignon oder Liebling (\\"The emperor's little one, or darling\\"), Anicetus is Handel's only openly gay operatic character. Characters As listed and described in Burrows et al.: George Frideric Handel: Volume 1, 1609‚Äì1725: Collected Documents (2011). *Nero, Roman emperor *Agrippina, the emperor's mother *Octavia, the emperor's wife, subsequently repudiated *Sabina Poppea, a Roman noblewoman, Nero's mistress *Tiridates, Armenian crown prince *Cassandra, crown princess of Media, in love with Tiridates *Seneca, Imperial privy counsellor *Anicetus, Nero's \\"mignon\\" or favourite *Graptus, the late emperor Claudius's freedman *A flamen or priest *Choruses of priests, Roman people *Dances of combatants, arsonists, Harlequins and Punchinellos, knights and ladies Plot The main story, told over three acts, follows generally that of Busenello's libretto for Monteverdi's 1642 opera L'incoronazione di Poppea. It recounts Nero's various schemes to replace his current queen Octavia with his mistress Poppea, against the urgings of his mother Agrippina and the philosopher Seneca. A sub-plot introduces Tiridates, crown prince of Armenia, another historical figure who, in the opera, is betrothed to the fictional Cassandra but is secretly pursuing Poppea in rivalry with the emperor. Octavia and Cassandra provide each other with mutual support in their trials, while Agrippina allies with Octavia and narrowly escapes death from a piece of falling masonry. In turn, she tries unsuccessfully to persuade Seneca to kill Nero. As a stratagem to secure Tiridates's love, Cassandra disguises herself and informs him of her death, which news temporarily deranges him. Anicetus further complicates matters by falling in love with Octavia. As these events develop, the servant Graptus provides a mocking, ironic commentary. Nero's play, \\"The Judgement of Paris\\", and a representation of the burning of Rome occupy much of Act III. After these many digressions the opera concludes with the banishment of Octavia, the incarceration of Agrippina, the return of his senses to Tiridates when he learns that Cassandra is alive, and a joyful and triumphant double coronation: Nero and Poppea, and Tiridates and Cassandra. Performance history Nero opened on 25 February 1705, with Mattheson in the title role. Its staging so closely after Almira's run indicates that it was probably composed, in part or in whole, during 1704. There are no surviving accounts of its public reception, but it clearly proved less successful than its predecessor, running for just three performances before the theatre closed for the Lenten season. When the G√§nsemarkt reopened the opera was not revived, and was never performed again. Music Although there is no extant music that can be positively identified with Nero, there is a possibility that some of it may have been used in later works. John E. Sawyer, in his analysis of Agrippina, reveals that this work, composed five years after Nero with similar characters, \\"contains the highest proportion of borrowed material of any of the composer's major dramatic works\\", and Dean and Knapp speculate as to whether it also incorporates borrowings from Nero. According to the Handel scholar Charles Cudworth, the suite of dances that follows the overture to Handel's 1707 opera Rodrigo (his first after leaving Hamburg), could very well have begun as ballet music in Nero or another of the lost Hamburg operas. The musicologist Bernd Baselt has raised the possibility that Handel's Harpsichord Suite in G Minor, HWV 453, is an arrangement of the overture to Nero. A version of this suite, reconstructed for orchestra by Peter Holman, is included in a selection of Handel's Hamburg music, issued by Hyperion Records in January 2012. Florindo and Daphne General The Greek myth of Apollo and Daphne, as told by the Roman poet Ovid, forms the basis of the double-opera Following its closure at the start of the 1705 Lenten season, the G√§nsemarkt did not reopen until August, by which time Keiser had returned from Wei√üenfels to produce his opera Octavia. From this point, Handel's regular connection with the theatre appears to have diminished. Although he remained in Hamburg for a further year, his main source of income was from private lessons, as he saved for his long-desired visit to Italy. He nevertheless accepted a commission from the G√§nsemarkt to compose a setting for a large-scale opera based on the Greek myth of Apollo and Daphne. With its rambling plot and an assortment of dances and other set pieces‚Äîalmost 100 musical numbers in all‚Äîthe work was eventually divided into two separate operas, for performance on successive nights. The two sections were given the formal names Der begl√ºckte Florindo (\\"Florindo made happy\\") and Die verwandelte Daphne (\\"Daphne metamorphosed\\"), but are generally known as Florindo and Daphne. It is not known when Handel wrote the music. He may have completed it in 1705‚Äì06 while still in Hamburg, or it may have been composed in Italy after arriving there in the latter part of 1706. Libretto The text is by Heinrich (sometimes rendered as \\"Hinrich\\") Hinsch, an established G√§nsemarkt librettist whose stated intention was adapting stories to provide \\"a pleasurable poetic experience\\", to \\"[titillate] the senses of its audience without attempting to address their reason or understanding\\". In this case he took as his base material the episode of Phoebus (Apollo) and Daphne as told in Book 1 of Ovid's Metamorphoses, but added a plethora of new characters and incidents which move the story significantly away from the Ovidian original. The main language is German, but the presence of several ensembles and arias in Italian leads Dean and Knapp to speculate that Hinsch may have used an Italian libretto as his source. The Florindo and Daphne libretti were published in the H√§ndel-Jahrbuch, in 1984 and 1985 respectively, and in facsimile form in 1989 as part of a 13-volume edited by Ellen T. Harris. The preface to the Florinda libretto explains Hinsch's choice of titles: \\"The first of [the two parts] presents the Pythean festival, instituted in honour of Phoebus (Apollo), and the betrothal of Florinda and Daphne which took place on the same day, so it receives the title 'Florindo made happy'. The other part represents Daphne's stubborn resistance to Phoebus's love, also the abhorrence she feels for all love, and finally her metamorphosis into a laurel tree, from which it receives the title 'Daphne metamorphosed' \\". Characters As listed and described in Burrows et al.: George Frideric Handel: Volume 1, 1609‚Äì1725: Collected Documents (2011). *Phoebus (Apollo), in love with Daphne *Daphne, daughter of the river-god Peneus. Loved by Phoebus, betrothed to Florindo *Florindo, son of the river-god Enipheus. Betrothed to Daphne, secretly loved by Alsirena *Lycoris, a Thessalian nymph, in love with Florindo *Damon, a Thessalian shepherd in love with Lycoris *Galathea, an aged nymph, Daphne's confidante *Alsirena, daughter of the river-god Apidinus, secretly in love with Florindo *Thyrsis, a noble Arcadian shepherd, Damon's friend *Cupid, Vulcan, Peneus, Enipheus: gods *Chorus: Thessalian shepherds/shepherdesses, Cyclops, Tritons, Naiads Plot Florindo opens with celebrations to mark Apollo's victory over the dragon Python. Apollo boasts that he is more proficient with the bow than Cupid. This offends the latter, who mischievously wounds Apollo with a drugged arrow which causes him to fall in love with Daphne. She, however, has pledged her love for Florindo, who is at the centre of a complex tangle of infatuations: he is secretly loved by Alfirena and more openly by the scheming shepherdess Lycoris, who in turn is the object of the shepherd Damon's desires. The various would-be lovers are consoled or advised by Damon's friend Thyrsis, and by the ageing nymph Galathea, who has herself not quite given up on love, though her advances to Thyrsis are rejected. Daphne and Florindo prepare to marry, but Apollo remains hopeful and continues his suit. Lycoris is prepared to await the outcome of events, but Damon, Galathea and Alfirena are in despair, as the opera ends with another spectacular celebration in honour of Apollo. The second opera, Daphne, begins as the wedding of Florindo and Daphne gets under way. Cupid, bent on more mischief, wounds Daphne with a special arrow, forged by the god Vulcan, that causes her to renounce all love. She abandons the wedding and announces that she will join the goddess Diana and become a huntress. This sparks a series of schemes and counter-schemes as both Apollo and Florindo continue to pursue Daphne while the other would-be lovers manoeuvre for position. Lycoris assures Apollo that Daphne's abandonment of the wedding was a signal that she favours him. Lycoris also steals Daphne's cloak and, wearing it as a disguise, makes advances to Damon, having first ensured that Florindo overhears. Florindo is enraged by what he believes is Daphne's duplicity, and denounces her. Damon confirms the story. Daphne, bewildered, pleads with her father Peneus to prove her innocence; he responds by transforming her into a laurel tree. Cupid blames Apollo's pride for the fiasco, but gives him the laurel as his \\"special tree\\". Florindo now accepts Alfirena, and Lycoris, having confessed her scheming, is united with Damon. Only the guiltless Daphne ends up losing everything. Performance history Dean and Knapp record that in early 1707 Keiser surrendered the lease of the G√§nsemarkt to Johann Heinrich Sauerbrey, who thus became responsible for the staging of the double opera. It may by this time have been in rehearsal, and the difficulties involved in such a complex and elaborate work may have necessitated several postponements. The consensus among experts is that the two parts were first performed on consecutive evenings in January 1708, as they are the first works in Mattheson's opera list for 1708. There are no surviving records of the public's reception, the length of the original run, or of any revivals. Whether Handel was present at any time during rehearsals or performance is uncertain; he may have returned from Italy, fresh from the opening of Rodrigo in Florence, to supervise the production of Florindo and Daphne in Hamburg. Dean and Knapp suggest the works may have been directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner, although Anthony Hicks in his Grove Handel biography, says that so unusual a project would not have been attempted without the composer's presence. The theatre's management was clearly concerned that the public might find the double opera too heavy in undiluted form. Accordingly, a comic intermezzo in Low German dialect (platte-deutsch) was devised by Sauerbrey to precede the performance of Daphne. The critic and essayist Romain Rolland, in his life of Handel, termed this a \\"mutilation\\", carried out \\"for fear that the music may tire the hearers\\". Music A few fragments of music from the twin operas survive. The Newman Flower collection at Manchester Central Library holds three arias and a chorus, in full orchestral score but with the vocal parts missing. A blank stave with a soprano clef suggests that the three arias were written for soprano voice. The chorus has been identified by Baselt with \\"Streue, O Bra√ºtigam\\", from Act 1 of Daphne. Two of the arias are tentatively associated with \\"Mie speranza, andate\\" from Act 1 of Florindo, and \\"Mostrati pi√π crudele\\" from the third act of Daphne. The third aria has not been identified. The Royal Music Collection at the British Library houses the manuscripts of instrumental pieces, mainly dances, that belong to Florindo and Daphne. A group of eight short pieces have been catalogued as two four- movement suites, HWV352 and HWV353. The British Library collection includes a further group of four movements, scored for string orchestra, which has been catalogued as HWV354. As with Nero, it is possible that music from Florindo or Daphne was recycled by Handel for use in later works. The overture to the opera Rodrigo consists of eight French-style dances, which Cudworth believes might have begun life as ballet music in one or other of the lost Hamburg operas. In 1709‚Äì10 Handel composed the cantata Apollo e Dafne, which has common ground with the earlier operas. Harris makes the point that when writing the cantata, Handel would have recalled his earlier setting, and perhaps borrowed from it. Dean and Knapp provide further example of works in which the Florinda and Daphne music may have re-emerged: the oratorio Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno (1707); the opera Radamisto (1720); and the overture in B flat, HWV336, which Baselt conjectures might have been written as the overture to Florindo. This last-named has been combined with HWV352‚Äì354 and HWV356 to form the Suite from the operas Florindo and Daphne, which in 2012 was adapted and recorded by The Parley of Instruments under Peter Holman. Afterwards Handel's Hamburg years provided him with a composing apprenticeship, particularly although not exclusively as a writer of opera. The influence of Keiser, which began during this period, was significant throughout Handel's career. Apart from his lifelong habit of \\"borrowing\\" fragments from Keiser's operas for use in his own works, he adopted and retained many of his mentor's compositional characteristics; according to Hicks, \\"[Handel] never relinquished French forms for overtures and dance music, and his use of orchestral colour, particularly the occasional instrumental doubling of the voice colla parte, was derived from German models\\". The loss of much of Handel's early work was first noted by his earliest biographer, Mainwaring (1760), who refers to \\"a great quantity of music\\" from Hamburg and Italy, adding that it was not known how much of it still existed. On departing from Hamburg, Handel spent a further three years in Italy before settling in London, where he remained the dominant composer of Italianate opera for the following thirty years. After his Hamburg initiation, Handel composed more than forty operas, beginning with Rodrigo in 1707, and ending in 1740 with Deidamia. These works were quickly forgotten after Handel's death; modern revivals did not begin until the 1920s. Dean and Knapp believe that, despite the years of relative neglect, Handel's achievements as a composer of opera entitle him to rank alongside Monteverdi, Mozart, Verdi, and Richard Wagner as one of the supreme masters of the genre.

Michaels is the co-founder of Ringadoc. Raised in Southern California, Michaels is a graduate of Westlake High School and the University of Southern California, where he studied pre- medicine and neuroscience. Michaels has been recognized as an entrepreneur. In 2010, he co-founded Ringadoc, a telemedicine service company that allows doctors to interact with patients via a web browser or mobile application. In 2014, Practice Fusion acquired Ringadoc. Michaels provides commentary on health technology, prescription drug prices in the United States, and the general state of health care in the United States. Michaels performs stand-up comedy. He has performed at The Improv and The Comedy Store. Education Michaels attended Westlake High School, where he participated in the Advanced Anatomy program. He graduated in 2005 as the salutatorian. Michaels attended the University of Southern California where he studied pre-medicine. As a premed student, Michaels was interested in the intersections between technology, media and medicine. In 2009, Michaels graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor of arts in Neuroscience and Biological Sciences. By 2010, Michaels had gained admission to several medical schools in the United States, and received a deferral to pursue Ringadoc. In 2012, Michaels officially decided to forgo medical school to focus on Ringadoc full-time. Career Ringadoc In 2010, Michaels co-founded the telemedicine company Ringadoc. Ringadoc connects patients to doctors by phone to a doctor anywhere, as long as the doctor is anywhere in the state in which the patient is physically present. Users of Ringadoc initially could record an audio summary of their medical history and a video describing their medical concern, which the doctor consults before speaking with the patient. According to Michaels, Ringadoc is for short-term health issues that might need quick prescriptions when patients are not able to get to a doctor, or if an appointment is unnecessary. Michaels did not envision telemedicine replacing primary care. Ringadoc launched in October 2010. By 2012, Ringadoc was only up and running in California, but the company expected to be up and running in twenty American states in 2013. Entrepreneur (magazine) named Ringadoc one of the 100 brilliant companies of 2012. Into 2013, Ringadoc had handled over one hundred thousand calls from patients. Michaels said Ringadoc dropped the video-enabled app to focus on phone consultations. Michaels explained that, after patients call a doctor who use Ringadoc, the responding doctor will either respond via text message or phone call. The company began to target physicians with an after hours service, rather than anytime service. The company raised 1.2 million dollars in seed funding. Ringadoc received financing from Founders Fund, other venture capital firms, Practice Fusion Founder and CEO Ryan Howard, and former president of One Medical Group Sharon Knight, among others. In 2014, Practice Fusion acquired Ringadoc. After leaving Ringadoc, Michaels briefly worked in the space of electronic health records. GoodRx After leaving Ringadoc, Michaels took over as director of operations at GoodRx. GoodRx is a website and mobile app that tracks prescription drug prices and offers drug coupons in the United States. Michaels serves as Vice President at GoodRx, and continues to provide commentary on the evolution of digital healthcare.

Description and history The bronze sculpture depicts George Canning (British Prime Minister during 1827) larger than life size, swathed in a long robe and a cloak, holding a scroll in his left hand, similar to a classical statue of an orator from Ancient Roman, although his legs are covered with modern trousers and he has laced shoes on his feet. The statue stands on a granite plinth which bears the inscription \\"GEORGE CANNING\\". The statue was first erected near St Margaret's, Westminster, overlooking Old Palace Yard. It was unveiled there on 2 May 1832, five years after Canning's death in office aged 57 in August 1827. The statue was said to be a good likeness, and was based on a bust made by Francis Chantrey for his memorial at Westminster Abbey. The statue was moved to Parliament Square in 1867, becoming the first statue in the new square as it was laid out. It stands outside 12 Great George Street, the home of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, in an area now known as Canning Green. The statue became a Grade II listed building in 1970.

Pathophysiology Secondary injury takes place minutes to weeks after the initial insult and includes a number of cascading processes that further harm tissues already damaged by the primary injury. It results in formation of a glial scar, which impedes axonal growth. Animal models Animals used as SCI model organisms in research include mice, rats, cats, dogs, pigs, and non-human primates; the latter are close to humans but raise ethical concerns about primate experimentation. Special devices exist to deliver blows of specific, monitored force to the spinal cord of an experimental animal. Epidural cooling saddles, surgically placed over acutely traumatized spinal cord tissue, have been used to evaluate potentially beneficial effects of localized hypothermia, with and without concomitant glucocorticoids. Surgery Surgery is currently used to provide stability to the injured spinal column or to relieve pressure from the spinal cord. How soon after injury to perform decompressive surgery is a controversial topic, and it has been difficult to prove that earlier surgery provides better outcomes in human trials. Some argue that early surgery might further deprive an already injured spinal cord of oxygen, but most studies show no difference in outcomes between early (within three days) and late surgery (after five days), and some show a benefit to earlier surgery. Neuroprotection Neuroprotection aims to prevent the harm that occurs from secondary injury. One example is to target the protein calpain which appears to be involved in apoptosis; inhibiting the protein has produced improved outcomes in animal trials. Iron from blood damages the spinal cord through oxidative stress, so one option is to use a chelation agent to bind the iron; animals treated this way have shown improved outcomes. Free radical damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is another therapeutic target that has shown improvement when targeted in animals. One antibiotic, minocycline, is under investigation in human trials for its ability to reduce free radical damage, excitotoxicity, disruption of mitochondrial function, and apoptosis. Riluzole, an anticonvulsant, is also being investigated in clinical trials for its ability to block sodium channels in neurons, which could prevent damage by excitotoxicity. Other potentially neuroprotective agents under investigation in clinical trials include cethrin, erythropoietin, and dalfampridine. Hypothermia One experimental treatment, therapeutic hypothermia, is used in treatment but there is no evidence that it improves outcomes. Some experimental treatments, including systemic hypothermia, have been performed in isolated cases in order to draw attention to the need for further preclinical and clinical studies to help clarify the role of hypothermia in acute spinal cord injury. Despite limited funding, a number of experimental treatments such as local spine cooling and oscillating field stimulation have reached controlled human trials. Methylprednisolone Inflammation and glial scar are considered important inhibitory factors to neuroregeneration after SCI. However, aside from methylprednisolone, none of these developments have reached even limited use in the clinical care of human spinal cord injury in the US. Methylprednisolone can be given shortly after the injury but evidence for harmful side effects outweighs that for a benefit. Research is being done into more efficient delivery mechanisms for methylprednisolone that would reduce its harmful effects. Neuroregeneration Neuroregeneration aims to reconnect the broken circuits in the spinal cord to allow function to return. One way is to regrow axons, which occurs spontaneously in the peripheral nervous system. However, myelin in the central nervous system contains molecules that impede axonal growth; thus, these factors are a target for therapies to create an environment conducive to growth. One such molecule is Nogo-A, a protein associated with myelin. When this protein is targeted with inhibitory antibodies in animal models, axons grow better and functional recovery is improved. Stem cells Stem cells are cells that can differentiate to become different types of cells. The hope is that stem cells transplanted into an injured area of the spinal cord will allow neuroregeneration. Types of cells being researched for use in SCI include embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, Schwann cells, activated macrophages, and induced pluripotent stem cells. When stem cells are injected in the area of damage in the spinal cord, they secrete neurotrophic factors, and these factors help neurons and blood vessels to grow, thus helping repair the damage. It is also necessary to recreate an environment in which stem cells will grow. An ongoing Phase 2 trial in 2016 presented data showing that after 90 days of treatment with oligodendrocyte progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cells, 4 out of 4 subjects with complete cervical injuries had improved motor levels, with 2 of 4 improving two motor levels (on at least one side, with one patient improving two motor levels on both sides). The trial's original endpoint had been 2/5 patients improving two levels on one side within 6‚Äì12 months. All 8 cervical subjects in this Phase 1‚Äì2 trial had exhibited improved upper extremity motor scores (UEMS) relative to baseline with no serious adverse side effects, and a 2010 Phase 1 trial in 5 thoracic patients has found no safety issues after 5‚Äì6 years of followup. Six-month efficacy data is expected in January 2017; meanwhile, a higher dose is being investigated and the study is now also recruiting patients with incomplete injuries. Embryonic stem cells Human embryonic stem cells in cell culture Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent; they can develop into every type of cell in an organism. Neural stem cells Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent; they can differentiate into different kinds of neural cells, either neurons or glia, namely oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. The hope is that these cells when injected into an injured spinal cord will replace killed neurons and oligodendrocytes and secrete factors that support growth. However they may fail to differentiate into neurons when transplanted, either remaining undifferentiated or becoming glia. A phase I/II clinical trials implanting NSCs into humans with SCI began in 2011 and ended in June 2015.https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01321333 Mesenchymal stem cells Mesenchymal stem cells do not need to come from fetuses, so avoid difficulties around ethics; they come from tissues including bone marrow, adipose tissue, the umbilical cord. Unlike other types of stem cells, mesenchymal cells do not present the threat of tumor formation or triggering an immune system response. Animal studies with injection of bone marrow stem cells have shown improvement in motor function; however not so in a human trial a year post-injury. More trials are underway. Adipose and umbilical tissue stem cells need further study before human trials can be performed, but two Korean studies were begun to investigate adipose cells in SCI patients. Olfactory ensheathing cells Transplantation of tissues such as olfactory ensheathing cells from the olfactory bulbs has been shown to produce beneficial effects in spinal cord injured rats. Trials have also begun to show success when olfactory ensheathing cells are transplanted into humans with severed spinal cords. People have recovered sensation, use of formerly paralysed muscles, and bladder and bowel function after the surgeries, eg Darek Fidyka. Induced pluripotent stem cells Japanese researchers in 2006 discovered that adding certain transcription factors to cells caused them to become pluripotent and able to differentiate into multiple cell types. This way a patient's own tissues could be used, theoretically because of a reduced chance of transplant rejection. Engineering approaches Recent approaches have used various engineering techniques to improve spinal cord injury repair. Use of biomaterials is an engineering approach to SCI treatment that can be combined with stem cell transplantation. They can help deliver cells to the injured area and create an environment that fosters their growth. The general hypothesis behind engineered biomaterials is that bridging the lesion site using a growth permissive scaffold may help axons grow and thereby improve function. The biomaterials used must be strong enough to provide adequate support but soft enough not to compress the spinal cord. They must degrade over time to make way for the body to regrow tissue. Engineered treatments do not induce an immune response as biological treatments may, and they are easily tunable and reproducible. In-vivo administration of hydrogels or self- assembling nanofibers has been shown to promote axonal sprouting and partial functional recovery. In addition, administration of carbon nanotubes has shown to increase motor axon extension and decrease the lesion volume, without inducing neuropathic pain. In addition, administration of poly-lactic acid microfibers has shown that topographical guidance cues alone can promote axonal regeneration into the injury site. However, all of these approaches induced modest behavioral or functional recovery suggesting that further investigation is necessary. Hydrogels Hydrogels are structures made of polymers that are designed to be similar to the natural extracellular matrix around cells. They can be used to help deliver drugs more efficiently to the spinal cord and to support cells, and they can be injected into an injured area to fill a lesion. They can be implanted into a lesion site with drugs or growth factors in them to give the chemicals the best access to the damaged area and to allow sustained release. Exoskeletons The technology for creating powered exoskeletons, wearable machinery to assist with walking movements, is currently making significant advances. There are products available, such as the Ekso, which allows individuals with up to a C7 complete (or any level of incomplete) spinal injury to stand upright and make technologically assisted steps.http://www.eksobionics.com/ekso The initial purpose for this technology is for functional based rehabilitation, but as the technology develops, so will its uses. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) uses coordinated electric shocks to muscles to cause them to contract in a walking pattern. While it can strengthen muscles, a significant downside for the users of FES is that their muscles tire after a short time and distance. One research direction combines FES with exoskeletons to minimize the downsides of both technologies, supporting the person's joints and using the muscles to reduce the power needed from the machine, and thus its weight. Brain‚Äìcomputer interface Recent research shows that combining brain‚Äìcomputer interface and functional electrical stimulation can restore voluntary control of paralyzed muscles. A study with monkeys showed that it is possible to directly use commands from the brain, bypassing the spinal cord and enable limited hand control and function. Spinal cord implants Spinal cord implants, such as e-dura implants, designed for implantation on the surface of the spinal cord, are being studied for paralysis following a spinal cord injury.Paddock, Catharine (2015). Soft spinal implants show promise as long-term solution paralysis. Medical News Today. Retrieved 03/09/2015. E-dura implants are designed using methods of soft neurotechnology, in which electrodes and a microfluidic delivery system are distributed along the spinal implant. Chemical stimulation of the spinal cord is administered through the microfluidic channel of the e-dura. The e-dura implants, unlike previous surface implants, closely mimic the physical properties of living tissue and can deliver electric impulses and pharmacological substances simultaneously. Artificial dura mater was constructed through the utilization of PDMS and gelatin hydrogel. The hydrogel simulates spinal tissue and a silicone membrane simulates the dura mater. These properties allow the e-dura implants to sustain long-term application to the spinal cord and brain without leading to inflammation, scar tissue buildup, and rejection normally caused by surface implants rubbing against nerve tissue. In 2018 two distinct research teams from Minnesota's Mayo Clinic and Kentucky's University of Louisville managed to restore some mobility to patients suffering from paraplegia with an electronic spinal cord stimulator. The theory behind the new spinal cord stimulator is that in certain cases of spinal cord injury the spinal nerves between the brain and the legs are still alive, but just dormant. On 1 November 2018 a third distinct research team from the University of Lausanne published similar results with a similar stimulation technique in the journal Nature.

He was a pioneer in establishing paramedic emergency care, \\"one of a handful of doctors who created the modern paramedic emergency system\\". Early life and education He was born in New York City, the son of a high- end jewelry designer, and raised in The Bronx. He attended the City College of New York and received his medical degree from the University of California, San Francisco in 1942. During World War II he served as an Army physician in Europe and North Africa. Career He had a private practice in Los Angeles as a cardiologist, primarily at the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, California, and also at Los Angeles County Hospital, both of which he served as chief of staff. He was a clinical professor for Loma Linda University and the University of Southern California, and chaired both the State Commission on Emergency Medical Services and the California Medical Association Committee on Emergency Medicine. Emergency medical care During the 1960s he created a dedicated coronary care unit at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, thought to be the first such unit on the West Coast. He became concerned about the lack of actual medical care being given to coronary patients during emergency transportation to a hospital. In 1969, while serving as president of the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Heart Association, he created a \\"mobile critical care unit\\", consisting of a Chevrolet Van, a registered nurse, and a portable defibrillator. He was inspired in part by the work of Frank Pantridge, inventor of the portable defibrillator, who had established a mobile coronary critical care unit in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Also in 1969 his patient Kenneth Hahn, a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, persuaded the Supervisors to approve a pilot program to train county firefighters as \\"Mobile Intensive Care Paramedics\\". A change in state law was necessary to allow personnel other than doctors and nurses to render emergency medical care. Graf helped to write the Wedworth-Townsend Paramedic Act of 1970, which was signed into law by Governor Ronald Reagan on July 15, 1970, despite opposition from doctors, nurses, and attorneys. Reagan first sought assurance from Hahn that paramedics would be allowed to cross city lines freely within Los Angeles County, recalling that his father had died in 1940 of a heart attack after a Los Angeles-based ambulance was restricted from entering Beverly Hills to attend to him. Paramedic training began the next month at the Freeman Hospital under Graf's direction. It was the first nationally accredited paramedic training program in the United States. A 1973 follow-up study of transported cardiac patients indicated that trained paramedic firefighters performed as well as nurses; that trained personnel performed equally well whether using the special coronary response van or a regular ambulance; and that response time was twice as fast when paramedics were called compared to when a physician was called. The program he started at Freeman Hospital merged with the UCLA Center for Prehospital Care in 1999. Paramedic training is carried out at the old Freeman Hospital location, in a building known as the Walter S. Graf Center. Personal life Graf was married four times and had nine children and stepchildren. He died in Los Angeles on October 18, 2015 at the age of 98. He is buried at the Hillside Memorial Park in Los Angeles.

Her mortal remains were buried one yard south beside the Lingam under the same temple roof.

He then became the director of the National Cancer Institute, and then president/chief executive officer of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He is best known for having been the assistant in charge of on-site medical operations in the Tuskegee syphilis study, a longitudinal clinical examination by PHS of untreated syphilis in U.S. African-American males. Very serious questions of medical ethics have been raised about this study and those involved in it. Biography Tuskegee syphilis study A native of the U.S. South, Heller was born in South Carolina. He was directly descended, on both his father's and his mother's side, from soldiers who had fought for the Confederate States of America. He was awarded a bachelor of science degree from Clemson University in 1925, and graduated in 1929 from Emory University School of Medicine. In 1930, shortly after completing his internship, he began working in public health and was commissioned in 1934 in the United States Public Health Service. He specialized in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases. As part of his specialist research, Heller assisted Dr. Raymond H. Vonderlehr, a clinician and epidemiologist who was one of the chief originators of what became the Tuskegee syphilis study. As the Tuskegee study's on-site director, Vonderlehr led a key transitional move in 1933: the clinicians identified groups of patients, persons they were already examining and who were known to be infected, as potential subjects in a prospective cohort study of the progressive effects of syphilis on human neuroanatomy. The Tuskegee study used painful diagnostic tests, including spinal taps, which were deceitfully described as 'treatments.' State-of-the-art treatments for syphilis were not fully effective in the 1930s. Vonderlehr was Heller's mentor at the time, and selected Heller to be his assistant in charge of on-site medical operations at Tuskegee. Both Vonderlehr and Heller were seen as doing good work in the Venereal Disease Section of PHS, and Vonderlehr served as head of the Section until his retirement in 1943. Sexually transmitted diseases were seen as a major scourge of the time, and published data (including at least one study co-authored by Heller) of the neurological and other complications that were beginning to be experienced by some Tuskegee patients only increased the level of salience given to public-health work in this specialty. Heller believed that it was his duty to learn as much about long-term syphilis, and its complications, as he could. As he recalled in 1964: > We learned many, many things about the treatment of syphilis, and I saw > syphilis in all of its stages, early and late. When Vonderlehr stepped down, Heller succeeded him as head of the Section. At this time, the fight against sexually transmitted disease was seen as more urgent than ever; the United States was carrying out the widespread mobilization of young men for service in World War II. Heller's overall work was aided, starting in 1944, with the dissemination of penicillin as a treatment for syphilis. Production of the new \\"wonder drug\\" was made a priority for U.S. servicemen, including servicemen diagnosed with syphilis; however, penicillin took longer to manufacture for civilians, including civilians treated by the U.S. Public Health Service. Although Heller continued to serve as head of the venereal disease section of PHS, the drug was not provided to patients in the Tuskegee study. Their neurological and other complications continued and worsened, but the study had been underemphasized and its patients forgotten by medical circles. Heller was much praised for his overall work on the epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases; he rose to the rank of Assistant Surgeon General of the United States, and was named president of the American Venereal Disease Association in 1948-1949. War on Cancer Following the successful epidemiological work against syphilis performed by the United States and allied nations in the 1940s, hopes rose that public health work could reduce death rates from cancer. Heller was named director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1948, serving until 1960. As the director, he led a series of drives for increased U.S. federal government funding for cancer research, a precursor of the so-called War on Cancer. He was also president of the Cancer Public Health Association in 1957. Director Heller worked with the U.S. Congress to create the National Cancer Chemotherapy Service Center in 1955 within NCI. During Heller's tenure, the Institute helped stimulate the development of several second-generation agents of chemotherapy. The Institute and Public Health Association also gathered statistically valid data on the prevalence of cancers within different populations and in different organs of the human body. While cancer death rates continued to rise in the United States in the 1950s, statistical evidence gathered through grant support from NCI during this period led to insights that would bear fruit later, including key supporting evidence for correlations (which had begun to be noted by 1948) between various life-cycle carcinomas and the consumption of tobacco. In 1960, Heller moved to the private sector, accepting a position as president and chief executive officer at Sloan-Kettering. He was forced into partial retirement after becoming paralyzed by a stroke in May 1963, becoming a consultant to the NCI and to the American Cancer Society. During this period, the Surgeon General of the United States issued a major public health recommendation against the smoking of cigarettes, backed by research performed with the help of Heller's guidance. Heller remained active in his consultancies until completing his retirement in 1976. During the closing years of this consultancy period, the existence of the Tuskegee Study was unearthed. Major news stories began to be published in 1972. In interviews, Heller defended the research value of doing a long-term clinical study of the progress of untreated/undertreated syphilis in human research subjects. The retiring physician did not express contrition for any aspect of his work. During the following years, the words \\"Tuskegee study\\" became shorthand for what was coming to be seen as a serious breach of U.S. medical ethics, but ethicists tended to look at the study protocol rather than the individual biographies of the physicians who had headed the study. When Heller died in May 1989, an obituary published in the New York Times concentrated on his work at NCI and did not mention his role in the Tuskegee Study. Honors, awards and legacy In August 1959, in his capacity as director of the National Cancer Institute, Heller was featured on the front cover of Time magazine. Heller was granted the Wien Award in 1958 and the first World Peace through World Health award of the Eleanor Roosevelt Cancer Foundation in 1961. Attitudes changed toward the Tuskegee syphilis study that Heller had helped to head. As part of the resolution of a lawsuit, Pollard v. United States, compensation was paid to those patients who had survived the study. In May 1997, President Bill Clinton delivered a formal apology, on behalf of the United States, to the survivors. Five survivors accepted an invitation to the White House to accept the apology. When interviewers suggested that there had been parallels between the Tuskegee syphilis study and Nazi medical experiments, Heller responded that he saw no such connection.

Biography In the years 1900 to 1905, he studied comparative linguistics and classical philology in Vienna, and subsequently received his doctorate with a dissertation on the \\"Greek slave name\\" (Vienna 1907). A government scholarship enabled him to travel to Italy and Greece. While in Greece, he overheard the conversation of some fishermen from Attica. He got curious when he was told that it was the Arvanitika dialect of the Albanian .This would change his course of work from that moment on. After his return home, he became a school teacher at Bundesgymnasium in Vienna, but in 1907 he moved to Munich, where he participated in the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae project. In 1911, he returned to Vienna and took his career as a school teacher again. His first publication in the field of Albanian studies (together with Georg Pekmezi) was a teaching and reading book of Albanian (published in Vienna, 1913), Lehr und Lesebuch des Albanischen (Manual and Reader of Albanian). In the years 1913 and 1914, he traveled for several weeks depending southern Italy, to study the Albanian dialects spoken there. In particular, he devoted himself to the less known northern dialects of Arb√´resh, in the Abruzzo and Molise regions, especially the dialect of Villa Badessa (Alb: Badhesa). On this trip, his first collection of photographs came out. From May to July 1916, Max Lambertz visited as part of an expedition of the Balkan Commission of the Austrian Academy of Sciences for the first time North and Central Albania to scientifically deal with the Albanian language and folklore. On this trip he visited Gruda, Shkodra, Lezha, Kruja, Tirana, Durres, the Kir valley, Shoshi, Shala, the valleys of the Drin and Valbona and especially Mirdita where he devoted himself to the local dialect and folklore material collected. On this trip some unique photographs were taken. In December 1916, he returned to Albania, this time with the Austro-Hungarian troops which in the events of World War I had occupied northern and central Albania. He was entrusted with the management of the Albanian education system and was the first foreigner member of the Albanian Literary Commission, which was used by the Austro-Hungarian authorities to create a normalized for the school system default language. In Shkodra, he collaborated with Gjergj Fishta, editor of the newspaper Posta e Shypnis√´ (The Albanian Post) during 1916‚Äì1918, in which he published several posts. The collected folkloric material was published in Sarajevo, 1917, as Volkspoesie der Albaner: eine einf√ºhrende Studie (Folk poetry of the Albanians: an introductory study). After the war, Lambertz returned to Austria, where he taught until 1934. He also wrote books and articles on various aspects of Albanian culture, especially for the folklore. After 1934 after Engelbert Dollfuss took over, he retired as a longtime member of the Austrian Social Democratic Party, enrolled at the age of fifty-three years back at the university, and studied this time Protestant theology, but was his dissertation was rejected for racial reasons, since his mother came from a Jewish family. In 1939, Lambertz moved to Munich, where he worked again until 1942 at the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae. In 1943, he went to Leipzig, where he taught French and Italian at the Leipzig School for Foreign Languages. In June 1945, after had joined the Communist Party, he became director of the Leipzig \\"Fremdsprachenschule\\" (College of Foreign Languages), in 1946, Professor of Comparative Linguistics, and until 1949 the dean of the new Faculty of Education at the Karl Marx University. Until his retirement in 1957, he was also director of the \\"Indo-European Institute\\". Lambertz visited Albania in June 1954, and in 1957. Even after the breakdown of close political relations between Albania and the Warsaw Pact, he refused to completely abandon its links with the country. He participated furthermore at receptions of the Albanian Embassy in East Berlin. As a professor of comparative linguistics at the University of Leipzig, Lambertz lived with his wife Josepha in a villa in nearby Markkleeberg. He died on August 26, 1963, was buried at the D√∂bling Cemetery in Vienna.

It depicts the history of the city's public transit. According to TriMet, a public agency that operates mass transit in a region that spans most of the Portland metropolitan area, the painting portrays the agency's \\"central role in local public transit history at the site where various transportation companies have served the public for over 100 years. Despite the predominant car culture, the region's transportation system has long been a beacon of pioneering spirit, inspiring the nation with its bicycle, pedestrian, streetcar, bus, and light rail connectivity.\\" The wording used for the mural's title, a play on words based on the transit agency's name, was used by TriMet in the late 1970s as an advertising slogan (written as \\"Tri-It\\", because the agency's name included a hyphen at that time). Note: Advertisement for both the Portland Timbers soccer match schedule and Tri-Met bus service to the games. The mural is a timeline and moves forward chronologically, beginning on the east end of the wall along Southeast Holgate Boulevard, which depicts the westward expansion that began prior to 1872. Sections of the mural illustrate Portland's public transit improvements. TriMet logos and historical milestones are also displayed. The mural ends around the corner on Southeast 17th Avenue with a depiction of Tilikum Crossing (2015). The artist has said of the piece, \\"Like most of my murals, TRI IT is about making a positive impact and connecting people. When a piece can spark an ongoing dialogue, it brings pride and connection to a neighborhood.

He was singled out for his leadership at the Somme on 10 October 1916. During the attacks on Regina Trench, he was in charge of a party to prepare stepping off trenches for the attack. His party was to be guided by an engineering officer, but when that officer was wounded by shellfire, he continued without the guide and worked at night to complete the task. In a letter to his sister shortly after the event he wrote \\"The Colonel and the Brigadier recommended me for the Military Cross, for a little moonlight serenade I had on the Somme. The Colonel was quite peeved because the Higher Command didn't grant the request as he was quite keen on the recommendation.\\"Canadian War Museum Archives. Letter written \\"In the Field\\" and dated Dec 3, 1916 thumbnail In early January 1917, he was promoted to the rank of Acting Major and placed in command of a Company. During the Attack on Vimy Ridge on 9 April 1917, Acting Major Menzies was in command of C Company and along with the rest of the 4th CMR, tasked with achieving an objective on the German trench system. The 3rd Division was faced toward Vimy Village with the 7th and 8th Brigades on the line and the 9th Brigade as the support. Each battalion in the 8th Brigade was to attack in four company-sized waves with the final objective three-quarters of a mile beyond La Folie Farm and the German 3rd line of forward defences. Major Menzies‚Äô C Company was responsible for capturing Fickle Trench, 1000 yards from the Canadian line. All of the objectives of the 4th CMR were taken in less than two hours after the attack was launched, but the battalion to their extreme left, the Royal Canadian Regiment, left a 100-yard gap that had to be filled. A platoon from A Company, under Lt. B,C, Pierce, was tasked with filling the gap and they were shortly joined by reinforcements led by Major Menzies. Shortly after consolidating the gap, Lt. Pierce was killed by sniper fire while talking next to Major Menzies. Writing home to his brother Garnet shortly after the battle he wrote \\"I continued to walk along the trench and on the flank met Cliff Pierce, an officer in A Co'y, whom I knew at Queen's and whom I liked very much. I was shaking hands with him, when zip - a sniper's bullet shot through his heart and he fell without uttering a sound.\\"Canadian War Museum Archives.

Having led his company to the final objective, he took command of the whole front line objective, and consolidated under intense fire of every description. He showed great resource and initiative in keeping touch with other units, establishing strong advanced posts, and in personally patrolling his 500 yards of frontage, and it was largely owing to his personal efforts that hostile counter-attacks were repelled.‚ÄùLondon Gazette, 16 August 1917 In June 1917 while his company was deployed in the lines and running protective patrols around Hill 70, he was wounded by shellfire.

Police had initially reported that McDonald was behaving erratically while walking down the street, refusing to put down a knife he was carrying. Preliminary internal police reports described the incident similarly, leading to the incident being judged a justifiable shooting and to Van Dyke not being charged at that time. When a court ordered the police to release a dash cam video of the shooting thirteen months later, on November 24, 2015, it showed McDonald had been walking away from the police when he was shot. That same day, Officer Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder and initially held without bail at the Cook County Jail.Meisner, Jason; Gorner, Jeremy and Schmadeke, Steve (November 24, 2015).

The city reached a settlement with McDonald's family. On October 5, 2018, Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder, as well as 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm. Protests followed the shooting of McDonald, demanding changes in police and judicial procedure, and for the dismissal or resignation of city and county officials. Rahm Emanuel won a second term in 2015 as Mayor of Chicago (prior to the release of the dash cam video), but Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez lost her bid for reelection in 2016. At the request of Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, the United States Department of Justice initiated a civil rights investigation into McDonald's death and the activities of the Chicago Police Department. It released its report in January 2017, describing the police as having a culture of \\"excessive violence,\\" especially against minority suspects, and of having poor training and supervision. DOJ and city officials signed a consent decree for a plan for improvement to be overseen by the courts.

The Chicago City Council approved a $5 million settlement to McDonald's family on April 15, 2015, although the family had not yet filed a wrongful-death lawsuit. Emails from the mayor's office surrounding the case later revealed the settlement deal was finalized the day after the Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, secured his second term by a run-off election.

She said that they had not substantiated their claim that releasing the video would interfere with an ongoing investigation or jeopardize a fair trial if any officer was charged. On November 19, Cook County Judge Franklin Valderrama denied the city's request for a stay, ordering the video to be released to the public no later than November 25. The city did not appeal the judge's decision. On November 24, after a press conference, the video was released that showed an officer fatally shooting McDonald. Investigations A criminal investigation also began weeks after the shooting, when the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA) forwarded the case to the state's attorney's office and the FBI. The U.S. attorney's office confirmed on April 13, 2015, that they had been conducting a federal criminal investigation of the McDonald case in conjunction with the state attorney's office, after contradictions were found between the initial police report and the dash-cam video. The police report said that McDonald had lunged at an officer, but the video footage showed that McDonald made no lunges. The video does show that McDonald was swinging the knife in his right hand in a wide, but aimless manner as he walked down the street, and also appears to show that McDonald turns slightly to look briefly at Van Dyke and another officer who are pointing guns at him, but that he continues to walk away from both officers at the moment Van Dyke opens fire on him. On December 2, 2015, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan asked the U.S. Justice Department to launch a separate civil rights investigation of Chicago police tactics.Meisner, Jason (December 5, 2015). \\"The lingering questions in Laquan McDonald shooting case, video\\".

Van Dyke's trial On November 24, 2015, the same day the video was released, Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez announced that Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder, and Van Dyke turned himself in to authorities. He was initially held without bail at Cook County Jail for six days.Gorner, Jeremy; Sweeney, Annie; Meisner, Jason (November 23, 2015). \\"Cop in dash-cam video to face murder charge\\". Chicago Tribune. Crowd funding website GoFundMe shut down a page that was set up to raise funds for his legal defense shortly after it had raised just over $10,000. On November 30, Van Dyke was granted bail, set at $1,500,000. He posted $150,000‚Äîten percent of the bail‚Äîand was released from jail. On December 16, Van Dyke was indicted by a grand jury on six counts of first-degree murder and one count of official misconduct. The six counts of first-degree murder were: * Murder/Intent to Kill/Injure With Firearm, * Murder/Strong Probability to Kill/Injure With Firearm, * Murder/Intent to Kill/Injure Discharge Firearm, * Murder/Strong Probability to Kill/Injure Discharge Firearm, * Murder/Intent to Kill/Injure Discharge Firearm Proximately, and * Murder/Strong Probability to Kill/Injure Discharge Firearm Proximately. On December 29, 2015, Van Dyke pleaded not guilty to the charges. Van Dyke's attorney, Daniel Herbert, said that his client fears for his life. A few protesters yelled at him and called him names as he approached the courthouse for his arraignment. Van Dyke had a history of complaints in his police career but was cleared in most cases. After the arraignment, Herbert said he was looking for evidence to clear his client's name. On January 29, 2016, Herbert accused Chicago's mayor of tainting possible jurors, as he considered an effort to move the trial outside of Cook county: > It's been dozens and dozens of comments where [Rahm Emanuel] essentially > indicted my client. He's characterized my client's actions as being heinous > without even seeing the videotape. So when the mayor of the city in which > the pool of jurors is drawn from has taken such an adamant stance, it makes > it extremely difficult for us to get a juror in here who is not predisposed > to a finding of guilt. If convicted of first-degree murder, Van Dyke would have faced a prison sentence of 20 years to life. The case marked the first time in nearly 35 years that a Chicago police officer had been charged with first-degree murder for an on-duty fatality. On March 23, 2017, the charges against Van Dyke were six counts of first degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery, one for each shot fired at Laquan McDonald. Jury selection began on September 5, 2018, and the trial commenced on September 17. On October 5, 2018, Van Dyke was found guilty of second degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm, but was found not guilty of official misconduct. On January 18, 2019, Van Dyke was sentenced to 6.75 years in prison for the second-degree murder conviction alone, which is permitted by Illinois law. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul filed a request with the Illinois Supreme Court to vacate Van Dyke's sentence for second-degree murder and impose a sentence on each of the 16 aggravated battery counts. The request was denied without comment. The Illinois Department of Corrections refused to disclose the state prison where Van Dyke was initially incarcerated to serve his sentence, citing safety reasons. He was transferred on February 5, 2019, to the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut. During his first week at this facility, he was assaulted by other inmates while in the general population. Sometime after the assault, he was transferred to the Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville in Otisville, New York. In November 2019 he was moved from the Otisville federal prison to a state prison outside Illinois. Trial of March, Walsh, and Gaffney On June 27, 2017, three current or former Chicago police officers were charged with conspiracy, official misconduct, and obstruction of justice connected with a coverup of the shooting. Those charged were David March, the lead detective in this case, Joseph Walsh, Van Dyke's partner on the night of the shooting, and Thomas Gaffney. Their bench trial began on November 27, 2018, and a verdict was expected by January 15, 2019.

Request for emails from Van Dyke and other police officers  In January 2016, CNN submitted a Freedom of Information Act request for emails regarding the McDonald case from Van Dyke, his partner, and other police officers. CNN requested emails from both official CPD email accounts and personal email accounts. However, after CNN appealed to the Illinois Attorney General, CPD officials revealed that they had not attempted to look through the officers' personal email accounts, arguing that personal emails are not public records subject to disclosure. In August that year, Attorney General Lisa Madigan ruled that emails on personal accounts that pertain to public business must be disclosed to the public. Her ruling was a binding opinion, requiring CPD to search the officers' email accounts and comply with the decision within 35 days. CPD appealed the ruling in court, and lost in September 2017. Ultimately, CNN never received the emails that it had requested. Each of the officers, individually or through their attorneys, either refused to provide emails, ignored the request, or denied having any relevant emails. Documents from 2005 Incident In May 2016, CNN revealed documents of a 2005 incident, in which Van Dyke had written a police report without speaking to any of the personnel or witnesses at the scene of another police shooting. Records of the investigation indicated that Van Dyke had also inappropriately thrown out the original documents pertaining to the case. Two recommendations that officers be fired On August 16, 2016, inspector Joseph Ferguson recommended that 10 officers be fired. This is followed on August 18, 2016, by Superintendent Eddie Johnson recommendation that 7 police officers be fired for false or misleading statements made about the incident. 2017 DOJ Report and agreement for oversight of city police DOJ announced the completion of their investigation and issued a \\"scathing report\\" in early January 2017, noting problems in a police culture of excessive violence, especially against minorities; and lack of training and oversight. DOJ and the city have a preliminary agreement to undertake broad reforms for improvement, with the goal of increasing the safety of both citizens and officers. It noted the department's improvements, such as training in de-escalation to avoid use of force, issuance of Tasers, officers wearing body cameras, and the reshaping of a police oversight body.Cheryl Corley, \\"DOJ Report On Chicago Police Finds 'Pattern Of Excessive Force'\\", NPR All Things Considered, 13 January 2017; accessed 14 January 2017 Also in January 2017, the city and DOJ signed \\"an agreement in principle to work together, with community input, to create a federal court-enforceable consent decree addressing the deficiencies uncovered during the investigation. An independent monitor, who has yet to be chosen, will oversee compliance.\\"Morgan Winsor, \\"5 Takeaways From Scathing Department of Justice Report on Chicago Policing, ABC News, 13 January 2017; accessed 14 January 2017 In February 2017, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions signaled that the Trump administration would \\"pull back\\" on federal civil rights probes of local police departments. He would not commit to enforcing the consent decree signed by Chicago and the Department of Justice. In June 2017, Mayor Emanuel backed off his commitment to enter a court-enforced agreement with the federal government. He said that an independent monitor selected by the city could work with the Justice Department to pursue police reforms without court oversight. Later that month, a group of civil rights organizations filed a federal lawsuit seeking court enforcement of police reforms. Also in June, Toni Preckwinkle, the president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners, and Jes√∫s \\"Chuy\\" Garc√≠a, another member of the Cook County Board, advocated for judicial oversight, as did Chicago Inspector General Joseph Ferguson. In August 2017, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed a lawsuit in federal court requesting that a judge oversee police reform in Chicago. In July 2018, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel and Illinois attorney general Lisa Madigan announced a proposed court settlement that was the first draft of a consent decree that would eventually serve as a court-enforced mandate governing reforms of the Chicago Police Department.

Manzoni was born around 1940 in Italy, the son of Count Zappi-Manzoni, a surgeon. He is technically Count Pablo Manzoni, although has stated in 1985 that he does not use his title. At the age of 17, Manzoni persuaded the Elizabeth Arden salon in Rome to employ him, despite his lack of experience. Whilst there, he worked with clients such as Sophia Loren, for whom he used his trademark eyebrow- bleaching technique to enhance her eyes. Another early Manzoni trademark was the use of false eyelashes. At 24, Manzoni relocated to Manhattan, New York, where from 1964 to 1979, known only as \\"Pablo,\\" he was creative director for Elizabeth Arden. In 1965, his eye-makeup techniques were so influential that he was awarded the Coty Award in recognition for launching a worldwide style. As a leader in the field of fashionable, elaborate eye-makeup, Pablo was extremely popular with fashion editors and society women during the 1960s. Manzoni stated in 1966 that the jewel-studded or flower-decorated eyes he created for the fashion press were intended to inspire the reader, rather than to be exactly copied. Despite this, he had clients asking him to reproduce the designs for actual wear. In 2011 Manzoni expanded on this, explaining that the \\"festive eyes\\" he created for Vogue and Harper's Bazaar were intended for shock value and publicity purposes, but that when at work he created subtle make-up for clients. In 1979 Manzoni left Elizabeth Arden to embark upon a solo career, for which he reclaimed his surname. By 1985, as well as dealing with private clients, Manzoni was working as a make-up consultant for Neiman Marcus. In 1990, he was Creative Director for the La Prairie cosmetics line.

The painting depicts Saint Rosalia, the patron saint of Palermo, interceding for the city during an outbreak of the plague. In the background can be seen the port of Palermo and Monte Pellegrino. The painting was one of six of Saint Rosalia produced in Palermo by van Dyck in the late summer of 1624 and early 1625, when the city was quarantined. He returned to the subject in 1629 with Coronation of Saint Rosalia (Vienna) and Saint Rosalia Interceding for the City of Palermo (Ponce, Puerto Rico). The work is currently (2020) on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was an early acquisition by the institution, whose curators initially mistook it for an Assumption of the Virgin. An undated but probably autograph copy of the work is now in the Alte Pinakothek M√ºnchen. History The saint's remains (she died in 1166) were said to have been found on Mount Pellegrino on 15 July 1624, the same year as the painting was executed. The piece was bought or commissioned by Antonio Ruffo, a Sicilian nobleman and art collector, who later also owned Aristotle with a Bust of Homer by Rembrandt, which he commissioned in 1653, and was patron to Matthias Stom. In recent years, using the technique of radiography based on neutron emission, it has been discovered that for this particular painting, van Dyck re-used a canvas which had previously borne a sketch for a self-portrait.

He originally trained to be an engineer, but was always interested in art because his uncle, Christoffel Bisschop and aunt, Kate Bisschop-Swift were painters. At the age of twenty-two, he decided to follow their example and take up art professionally.Biographical notes @ AskArt. He began his studies with his uncle, then attended the Rotterdam Academy of Fine Arts (now the Willem de Kooning Academy) and specialized in genre scenes, portraits, cityscapes and interiors; especially churches. When the painter Johannes Bosboom died in 1891, Bisschop was permitted to paint him while he was lying in his coffin and make a sketch of his workshop. He worked successively in Rotterdam and The Hague, where he became a member of the Pulchri Studio. In 1892, he married the artist Suze Robertson, one of the Amsterdamse Joffers. Their daughter, , also became a painter of interiors, animals and marine scenes. In addition to several Dutch museums, many of his works were acquired by the American Art Association in New York (now a division of Sotheby's).

A native of Budapest, she achieved national recognition for her 1934 painting, The Subway, which is a sympathetic portrayal of passengers in a New York City Subway car. Light-hearted in tone, the painting depicts a cross-section of city dwellers from the viewpoint of a fellow commuter. Artistic career When Lili Furedi was 31 years old she debarked from the ship Cellina at the port of Los Angeles. She came from Budapest by way of Trieste and on the ship's manifest she reported her occupation as painter. There is no record of art training she may have received either before or after her arrival in the United States. There is no doubt she was working as a professional artist, however, because in 1931 she won a prize for her painting, The Village, at the annual Christmas show held by the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors at the Argent Gallery in January of that year. In 1932 and for much of the rest of the decade she placed paintings in group exhibitions, including: (1) a 1932 exhibition by Hungarian-American artists in which she showed works called Hungarian Village and Hungarian Farm, (2) a 1935 exhibition of the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in which she showed a painting called Interior, (3) a 1936 exhibition by the New York Municipal Art Committee, and (4) a 1937 exhibition at the Woman's Club of Glen Ridge, New Jersey. Reviewing the 43rd annual Women Painters and Sculptors show of 1934, Edward Alden Jewell of The New York Times called attention to a painting of Furedi's entitled The Interesting Book which he included with paintings by three other artists as \\"unhappily deliberate attempts to be 'modern' at all costs.\\" In contrast, the New York Sun chose another of Furedi's paintings, called After the Masquerade, as the sole illustration accompanying its review of the exhibition. In reviewing another exhibition held in 1934, the critic, C.H. Bonte, listed Furedi within a group of artists considered to be among the \\"best known\\" of American women \\"who have gained high recognition\\" for their work. Lily Furedi, The Subway, 1934, oil on canvas, 39 x 48 1/4 in. (99.1 x 122.6 cm.), created for the U.S. Public Works of Art Project Early in 1934 Furedi was accepted into the Public Works of Art Project. This pioneering federal program employed artists at craftsmen's wages to make pictures on the theme of \\"the American scene.\\" Her contribution to the project was the painting called The Subway. The picture was one of twenty-five selected for presentation as gifts to the White House. It was also in a group that President and Mrs. Roosevelt had themselves selected as being among the best in the show. Beginning in 1935, when it accompanied a book review in The New York Times, the painting has frequently been used as an illustration in books, articles, news accounts, and Internet web sites. In examining Furedi's The Subway, critics and other observers have found much to say. The painting was said to be cheerful and the artist's interest to be sympathetic. It was seen as vibrant, bright, and optimistic. Its scene was said to be playful, clean, and decorous and its design elements as idealistically deployed. One reviewer saw an influence of \\"C√©zanne's cubes and cones\\" in a scene which tells a compelling story of a projected \\"society in which sex and race are comfortably, if nervously, aligned\\" and a poet, using the ekphrastic poetic technique, declared that the painting showed the \\"best in mass transit,\\" in which \\"we get to meet, greet, / and saunter through / time and space together.\\" The poem, by Angie Trudell Vasquez, is called \\"Eyes Alive.\\" It closes: \\"see what beauty / we can make / when all is lit up with color / warm and welcoming, / beckoning you / into the picture, / offering you a seat.\\" Following the 1934 touring show in which it appeared, The Subway was not again included in a public exhibition until 1983 when it appeared in \\"Social Concern and Urban Realism: American Painting of the 1930s\\" at Gallery 1199 in New York's Martin Luther King Labor Center. It appeared again in \\"1934: A New Deal for Artists,\\" a touring exhibition put together by the Smithsonian American Art Museum in 2009. After the Public Works of Art Project was closed down in 1934 Furedi joined the Federal Art Project. She is recorded as being employed in this program in 1937‚Äì1939 and, specifically as a muralist, in 1940. Furedi's work was reviewed infrequently after the mid-1930s. In 1941 she painted an altar mural called The Galley Slave which she donated to a Hungarian church in New York. In 1950 Furedi showed a decorated piece of pottery in a group exhibition at the Greenwich House Pottery in New York. She died in New York at the age of 73 in November 1969. Personal information Furedi was born on May 20, 1896. Her place of birth was either Debrecen or Budapest. Family Her father, Samuel Furedi (1872‚Äì1933), was a cello soloist and teacher. Her mother, Paula Sudfeld Furedi, was a former piano teacher at the Debrecen Conservatory, and one of her uncles, Sandor Furedi, was a concert violinist and teacher in New York. Furedi had a brother, Ernest Furedi, who was a merchant in Budapest, and a sister, Anna Furedi, an oral surgeon and director of the laboratory of the New York Institute of Clinical Oral Pathology. In 1927, Furedi traveled from Budapest to Los Angeles where her father had a music studio. She recorded her occupation as \\"painter\\" on the ship's manifest. On May 29, 1929, Furedi married Morris Teplitzky in New York. The marriage certificate states that she was previously unmarried. The marriage did not last long. The U.S. Census for 1930 says she was single and living with her parents in New York. She was also recorded as single and living in New York with her mother in the Census for 1940. This report says that Furedi was a naturalized U.S. citizen working for the government doing mural painting in the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration. Death Furedi died between November 1 and 7, 1969. A death notice placed in The New York Times on the latter date has the following text: \\"Furedi, Lily, beloved aunt of Agnes Kraus, also survived by cousins. Private services held Friday, Nov. 7th 1969.\\" Other names The Furedi surname is sometimes given as F√ºredi, Fueredi, or Furedy. Furedi's first name has been given as Lilly, Lillie or Lilian.

The church comes under the Karnataka Central Diocese of the Church of South India. Started in the early 19th century as the Wesleyan Mission Chapel by Wesleyan believers of the Madras Army with Tamil and English services, the Church now has services in Tamil and Malayalam. The name East Parade comes from its location on the East of the Parade Grounds of the Madras Engineer Group (MEG) regiment. The present church building was raised in 1865, on the site of the old Wesleyan Mission Chapel, with an inscription dated 6 October 1863 marking the laying of the foundation stone. Wesleyan Tamil Mission, Bangalore Wesleyan Church, East Parade (C H Doveton, 1900) LMS showing the location of the Wesleyan Mission Chapel The Wesleyan Tamil Mission in the Bangalore Cantonment was established in 1821. In November 18231, Elijah Hoole of the Wesleyan Mission applied to the Government of Madras for granting permission for starting a school and preaching place for the native population in the Bangalore Cantonment. The land selected had been previously obtained for the same purpose by a member of the Wesleyan Society who had lived temporarily in the Bangalore Cantonment, and had built a mud building with a thatched roof, which was in ruins in 1821. The permission was granted and a small building measuring 30 ft. length and 13 ft. width was constructed under the supervision of Mr. Mowat. In the early 19th century, the St. Mark's Church was the official Church of England station church of the East India Company for the officers and men of the Madras Army, stationed in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station. The Wesleyan soldiers of the Madras Army stationed in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station wanted their own church, and managed to secure a property for this purpose. A small school was built on this site and Tamil services began in this building. However, in 1822, the Wesleyan Mission was suspended and missionaries Mowat and Hoole were transferred. In 1826, the mission resumed with Rev. J F England taking charge. By this time, the school room had fallen into repairs, and a stable in the Mission compound had to be used as a church. These services were attended by soldiers and some Europeans of the Cantonment. The terms under which the Maharaja of Mysore transferred the Bangalore Civil and Military Station to the Government of Madras was that it be strictly used for military purposes only. Hence, the Madras Government was reluctant to allow building of new churches in the Cantonment. The only other option was to acquire private properties. Due to the time taken those days for journeying between England and India, the approval from the committee in England took more than a year. Wesleyan Mission Chapel William Arthur (an Irishman, after whom the William Arthur Memorial Church at Goobie is named after), provides a description of the Wesleyan Mission Chapel, the predecessor of the present East Parade Church (on the same site), located in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station. The Wesleyan Mission Chapel was built in front of the Wesleyan Mission House, and could accommodate nearly 300 people. Located at the heart of the Cantonment, it was raised for the Tamil and the English congregations. The cost of raising the chapel was met by subscription by local Europeans. A native who have received many honours from Lord William Bentinck, Governor General of India, contributed ¬£100 towards raising the chapel. In front of the chapel was a wide esplanade, with trees lined up as an avenue, about a mile long (South Parade, now Mahatma Gandhi Road). The road right of the chapel (Dickenson Road) led to the Madras Army barracks, accommodating a regiment consists of a European cavalry, an infantry regiment and 2 Sepoys. The road in front of the chapel had an spacious English church on one of its ends (St. Mark's Church). At the beginning of the esplanade was the bungalow of General Mark Cubbon, the British Resident of the Kingdom of Mysore. Further, according to Arthur, there was also a native cavalry regiment bordering a lake (Ulsoor Lake). The atmosphere was martial, with marching army men. This was the European part of Town in the Bangalore Cantonment. The Tamil population of the Cantonment were around the Alasoor (Ulsoor), Chuli (Shoolay), and the Great Bazaar (Shivajinagar). Most of the Tamil People had migrated to find employment with the Europeans. At that time it was nearly 50 years since Mysore fell into British rule, still Mysoreans were rarely recruited by the Europeans, as they preferred to employ the Tamil people and Muslims. The reason being Mysoreans being far away from the coast had very little interaction with foreigners and were shy of connecting with foreigners and maintained an independent outlook. Architecture Foundation stone for the present structure was laid on 6 October 1863, and completed in 1865. The church was described as the Wesleyan Cathedral of Bangalore. The building was capable of accommodating 700 people. There are 8 Greek Ionic order columns in the entrance of the church. There are no columns or pillars inside the building, and hence no obstruction to the altar. The church underwent extensive renovation was re-concentrated on 26 February 2006.

After retiring from a 37-year naval career, Smith was appointed CEO of Sydney Ferries until his dismissal over allegations of misuse of his corporate credit card. Investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) in 2009, Smith was found by the commission to have engaged in corrupt conduct. The case was referred to the Department of Public Prosecutions, and he was jailed for up to two years after pleading guilty before the District Court of New South Wales to one charge of cheating or defrauding Sydney Ferries. Naval career Smith was born in Sydney in 1950, and entered the Royal Australian Naval College in 1968. From January 1995 to July 1996, he was the commanding officer of the guided missile destroyer . In 1996, he became Director-General of Naval Policy and Warfare, and in 1997, Commandant of the ADF Warfare Centre at RAAF Base Williamtown. In 1999, he was Commander of Northern Command, and later that year became Deputy Chief of Navy. From July 2000 to July 2002, Smith served as Maritime Commander Australia. Smith retired from the navy in 2002, with the rank of rear admiral. Sydney Ferries After leaving the navy, Smith worked as a consultant for Nautilus Underwater Systems, and then worked for Australian Defence Industries (ADI Limited). After nine months at ADI, his corporate American Express credit card was cancelled after he incurred a $28,000 debt. On 21 August 2006, Smith was appointed as chief executive officer of Sydney Ferries. Between September 2006 and March 2009, Smith charged over $237,000 of personal expenses to his corporate credit card. Despite an annual salary of $320,000, Smith found himself in financial difficulties, with a substantial mortgage on a home in northern Sydney and medical expenses following his wife's illness and hospitalisation. Between December 2006 and June 2008, Smith reimbursed Sydney Ferries $135,598 for personal expenditure but made no further reimbursements, leaving an outstanding debt of $102,000. Furthermore, in October 2008 Smith had signed a letter to the Minister for Transport, David Campbell, assuring the minister that corporate card use within the organisation was in full compliance with government policy that cards only be used for official business. On 18 March 2009, Smith's conduct came to the attention of John Lee, Director-General of the Department of Premier & Cabinet, who stood him aside immediately. On 27 May, Minister Campbell announced that Smith's employment had been terminated. The case was referred for investigation to the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), which made findings of corrupt conduct by Smith and referred him to the Department of Public Prosecutions. From February 2011, Smith worked as a casual employee at a local Bunnings Warehouse, whilst waiting for his case to be heard. In July 2011, he filed for bankruptcy, at that stage owing over $410,000 to banks, landlords and phone companies. In August 2014, Smith pleaded guilty to one charge of cheating or defrauding Sydney Ferries. Prior to sentencing, District Court judge Michael Finnane cited Smith's \\"exemplary good character\\" in his naval career, saying it was \\"a tragedy that such a distinguished man should find himself facing sentence for fraud offences\\".

She is best known for being one of the first practicing women doctors in colonial India as well as being involved in a landmark legal case involving her marriage as a child bride between 1884 and 1888. The case raised significant public debate across several topics, which most prominently included law vs tradition, social reform vs conservatism and feminism in both British-ruled India and England. This ultimately contributed to the Age of Consent Act in 1891. Early life Rukhmabai was born to Janardhan Pandurang and Jayantibai in a Marathi family. Her father passed away when she was aged two and her mother seventeen. Six years after her husband's demise, Jayantibai married the widower Dr Sakharam Arjun who was an eminent physician and social activist in Bombay. Remarriage of widows was permitted among the Suthar (carpenter) community - the caste to which the couple belonged. Two and a half years later, 11-year-old Rukhmabai was married to the 19 year old Dadaji Bhikaji, a cousin of her step-father. It was agreed that deviating from the contemporary social norms, Dadaji would stay with Rukhmabai's family as a gharjawai and be fully provided for by them. The expectation was for him to acquire education in due course and \\"become a good man\\". Six months into the marriage, Rukhmabai having reached puberty, the traditional event of Garbhadhan was held signalling the time for ritual consummation of marriage. But Dr Sakharam Arjun, being an eminent physician of reformist tendencies, did not permit early consummation. This displeased Bhikaji, now aged 20, who also resented the attempts of Rukhmabai's family to make him \\"a good man\\". In addition to his aversion for education, the compulsion to go to sixth standard of school at an age when he should have been at the university was particularly distressing. In the meanwhile, Bhikaji lost his mother and against the advise of Sakharam Arjun, took to living with his maternal uncle Narayan Dhurmaji. The environment of Dhurmaji's home pushed Bhikaji further into a life of indolence and waywardness. He eventually accumulated debts which he hoped to clear using the property that accompanied Rukhmabai into the house. Rukhmabai refused to move in to the household of Dhurmaji to live with Bhikaji, a decision supported by her step-father. In contrast, in the same years Rukhmabai studied at home using books from a Free Church Mission library. Because of her father's association with religious and social reformers she also came into contact with prominent names like Vishnu Shastri Pandit, a strong proponent of women's causes in Western India at the time, along with European men and women exposing her to liberal reformism. With her mother, she also regularly attended the weekly meetings of the Prarthan√§ Sam√§j and Arya Mahil√§ Sam√§j.  \\"Restitution of conjugal rights\\" case by Bhikaji  In March 1884, Bhikaji sent a legal notice to Sakharam Arjun via his lawyers Chalk and Walker, asking him to desist preventing Rukhmabai from joining him. Eventually Sakharam Arjun sought legal help and via lawyers Payne-Gilbert, and Sayani provided grounds for Rukhmabai's refusal to join Bhikaji. In 1885, the case of Bhikaji seeking \\"restitution of conjugal rights\\" titled \\"Bhikaji vs. Rukhmabai, 1885\\" came up for hearing and the judgement was passed by Justice Robert Hill Pinhey. Pinhey stated that English precedents on restitution did not apply to the case as the English law applied to consenting adults. He also found fault with the English law cases and found no precedent in Hindu law. He declared that Rukhmabai had been wed in her \\"helpless infancy\\" and that he could not compel a young lady. Justice Pinhey retired soon after. In 1886, the case was brought up for retrial. Rukhmabai's counsels included J.D. Inverarity Jr. and Kashinath Trimbak Telang. The case drew criticisms from various sections of the society, in some cases claims that the law did not respect the sanctity of Hindu customs. Specifically, criticism of Justice Pinhey's decision came from the Native Opinion, an Anglo-Marathi weekly run by Vishwanath Narayan Mandlik (1833‚Äì89) who supported Bhikaji. A Pune weekly run by Balgangadhar Tilak, the Mahratta, wrote that Justice Pinhey did not understand the spirit of Hindu laws and that he sought reforms by \\"violent means\\". In the meantime, a series of articles appearing before and during the trial, in the Times of India penned under the pseudonym a Hindu Lady also caused public reactions. Later on it was revealed that the author was none other than Rukhmabai. The public debate revolved around multiple points of contention - Hindu versus English Law, reform from the inside versus outside and whether ancient customs deserved respect or not. The first appeal against the case was made on 18 March 1886 and was upheld by Chief Justice Sir Charles Sargent and Justice L.H. Bayley. On 4 March 1887, Justice Farran, using interpretations of Hindu laws, ordered Rukhmabai to \\"go live with her husband or face six months of imprisonment\\". Rukhmabai responded that she would rather face imprisonment than obey the verdict. This resulted in further upheaval and social debate. Balgangadhar Tilak wrote in the Kesari that Rukhmabai's defiance was the result of an English education and declared that Hinduism was in danger. On the other hand, Max M√ºller responded writing that the legal route was not the solution to the problem of Rukhmabai's case and that it was Rukhmabai's education that had made her the best judge of her own choices.  Dissolution of Marriage  After the series of court cases which resulted in the affirmation of the marriage, she appealed to Queen Victoria. It has been claimed that Queen Victoria overruled the court and dissolved the marriage. However no primary documentary evidence has been provided to support Queen Victoria's direct intervention in the case. In July 1888, a settlement was reached with Bhikaji and he relinquished his claim on Rukhmabai for a payment of two thousand rupees. Bhikaji remarried in 1889 and Rukhmabai went on to become a widely revered feminist and medical practitioner.  Influence on Age of Consent Act, 1891  The case generated a great deal of debate both within India and England. It drew written commentaries from reformers like Behramji Malabari (1853-1912), Balgangadhar Tilak, journalistic opinion pieces from prominent names like Rudyard Kipling and broader feminist discussions in British women's magazines. Ultimately, the publicity and debate generated by this case helped influence the enactment of the \\"Age of Consent Act\\" in 1891, which changed the age of consent from 10 to 12 years across British India.  Career  Rukhmabai received support from the likes of Dr. Edith Pechey (then working at the Cama Hospital) who not only encouraged her but helped raise funds for her further education. Other supporters included Shivajirao Holkar who donated 500 Rupees for \\"demonstrating courage to intervene against traditions\\", suffrage activists like Eva McLaren and Walter McLaren, the Countess of Dufferin's Fund for Supplying Medical Aid to the Women of India, Adelaide Manning and others who helped establish \\"The Rukhmabai Defence Committee\\" to help gather fund towards supporting her cause of continuing education. In 1889, Rukhmabai set sail to study medicine in England. In 1894, she received her Doctor of Medicine from the London School of Medicine for Women having also studied at the Royal Free Hospital. Doctors Kadambini Ganguly and Anandi Gopal Joshi were the first Indian women to have received medical degrees in 1886. But only Dr. Ganguly went on to practice medicine, making Rukhmabai the second woman to both receive a medical degree and practice medicine. In 1895, she returned to India and worked as the Chief Medical Officer at the Women's Hospital in Surat. In 1918, she turned down the offer of a role in the Woman's Medical Service, opting instead to work at the Zenana (Woman's) State Hospital in Rajkot until her retirement in 1929. She established the Red Cross Society at Rajkot. Rukhmabai chose to settle in Bombay after her retirement.  Later life  In 1904 after the death of Bhikaji, Rukhmabai chose to start dressing in a white sari as per Hindu traditions of widowhood. In 1929 after her retirement, she publishing a pamphlet titled \\"Purdah - the need for its abolition\\" arguing that young widows were being denied the chance to actively contribute to Indian society.  Death  Rukhmabai died, aged 90, from lung cancer on 25 September 1955. In popular culture * In 2008, the specifics of the legal case between Rukhmabai and her husband were published as a book titled \\"Enslaved Daughters: Colonialism, Law and Women's Rights\\" () by author Sudhir Chandra. * In 2016, the story of Rukhmabai was adapted into a Marathi film titled Doctor Rakhmabai starring Tannishtha Chatterjee directed by Anant Mahadevan and produced by Dr Swapna Patker.

Largely eschewing the street politics of many such contemporary groups, it sought to establish close cultural links with Nazi Germany and to appeal to the higher echelons of French life.Fiss, p. 202 It promoted a \\"Europeanist\\" outlook and sought the rebirth of France through part of Europe-wide \\"National Revolution\\".Forbes, p. 18 Development The Groupe was a revival of the Comit√© France-Allemagne, established in September 1940 by Fernand de Brinon.Littlejohn, p. 222 It eschewed political party status and instead worked towards \\"cultural\\" collaboration with the Germans. To this end it adopted a largely conservative approach and focused on such activities as hosting discussion circles and publishing two journals - La Gerbe and L'Union Francaise. The initiative had the support of Otto AbetzFiss, p. 201 and was at least partially supported financially by German money.Atkin, p. 142 It was divided into sections based on the pursuits it endorsed with science, economics, literature and law wings, as well as an arts section which included drama, music and visual arts sections. Max d'Ollone served as President of the music sectionSprout, p. 215 and in this role he was expected to organise gala events to celebrate the visits of German dignitaries to Paris.Sprout, p. 17 An exhibition by German sculptor and active Nazi Arno Breker in Paris was organised under the auspices of the Groupe, an event that became a source of much controversy in the post-Liberation era.Dorl√©ac, p. 321 It also broadcast a weekly radio show in Paris.Curtis, p. 236 Its headquarters were in Paris although the Groupe was permitted to organise in both Vichy France and the occupied zone. By 1943 it could claim 26,000 members in the occupied zone and 12,000 in the Vichy zone, with some 200,000 people attending its events. Many of its members were not otherwise active in political movements.Sweets, p. 88 Alphonse de Chateaubriant, the 1911 Prix Goncourt winner, presided over the group, whilst its governing committee included Abel Bonnard and Cardinal Alfred-Henri-Marie Baudrillart among its membership. Pierre Benoit, Georges Claude and Pierre Drieu La Rochelle were among the other prominent figures to sit on the committee, along with Robert Brasillach, Jacques ChardonneFiss, p. 204 and Paul Belmondo. Relationship to other groups A youth movement, Jeunes de l'Europe nouvelle (JEN), was attached to the Groupe, although it was somewhat more stridently active than its sedate parent organisation. Led by Jacques Schweizer, the former leader of the youth section of the Jeunesses Patriotes, it was active in promoting pro-collaboration propaganda campaigns. The JEN slightly pre-dated the Groupe, having initially been established by Saint-Loup before affiliating to the Groupe.Rees, p. 15 In 1942 the Groupe lent its support to the Front r√©volutionnaire national, an initiative established by Marcel D√©at as an attempt to realise his dream of forging a single mass party in support of collaborationism. The idea was not a success after a number of groups, including the influential French Popular Party (PPF), refused to support the initiative.Littlejohn, p. 248 Despite this a number of leading PPF members were also active in the Groupe itself.Sweets, p. 86 For his part D√©at saw the Groupe as vital for portraying a positive image of Germany in order to lessen the negative perceptions of occupation and collaborationism.Atkin, p. 132 Decline The group went into steep decline in the latter stages of the war as the tide began to turn against Germany. Following the Liberation membership of the Groupe Collaboration was defined as a basis for a judgement of Indignit√© nationale against any individual member.Curtis, pp. 226-227 References Bibliography *Atkin, Nicholas, The French at War, 1934-1944, Routledge, 2014 *Curtis, Michael, Verdict on Vichy: Power and prejudice in the Vichy France Regime, Phoenix Press, 2004 *Dorl√©ac, Laurence Bertrand , Art of the Defeat: France 1940-1944, Getty Publications, 2008 *Fiss, Karen, Grand Illusion: The Third Reich, the Paris Exposition, and the Cultural Seduction of France, University of Chicago Press, 2009 *Forbes, Robert, For Europe: The French Volunteers of the Waffen-SS, Stackpole Books, 2010 *Littlejohn, David, The Patriotic Traitors, Heinemann, 1972 *Rees, Philip, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, Simon & Schuster, 1990 *Sprout, Leslie A., The Musical Legacy of Wartime France, University of California Press, 2013 *Sweets, John, Choices in Vichy France: The French Under Nazi Occupation, Oxford University Press, 1986 Footnotes Political organizations based in France French collaborators with Nazi Germany ","title":"Groupe Collaboration"},{"id":"48645386","text":"The Vanishing of Sidney Hall (originally titled Sidney Hall) is a 2017 American mystery drama film directed and co-written by Shawn Christensen and starring Logan Lerman, Elle Fanning, Michelle Monaghan, Nathan Lane and Kyle Chandler. Principal photography of The Vanishing of Sidney Hall began in late April 2016. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2017. The film was released on January 25, 2018, through DirecTV Cinema before a limited release on March 2, 2018, by A24, and was released on DVD and Blu- ray on March 20, 2018 by Lionsgate Home Entertainment. Plot The film centers around Sidney Hall (Logan Lerman), a young novelist whose life is depicted in a non-linear narrative, through elliptical flashbacks and flash- forwards through three periods of his life. At the age of eighteen, Sidney reads a story about masturbating in the sixth grade to his English class, to the chagrin of his teacher. He is spared from expulsion by a fellow English teacher, Duane Jones (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who encourages him with his writing. Sidney is subsequently approached by a bully, Brett Newport (Blake Jenner), who requests assistance with digging up a package they buried when they were small children. Sidney declines and returns home to his abusive mother Velouria (Michelle Monaghan), his downtrodden disabled father Gerald (Darren Pettie), as well as a love letter from an unidentified \\"Melody\\". Duane encourages Sidney to use unorthodox, loud tactics to draw Melody out, which he attempts, to no avail. He spots a girl (Elle Fanning) from the Jameson family across the street and correctly deduces that she is Melody, though she is hesitant to directly interact with him. After seeing Brett bully a classmate, Sidney agrees to help him dig up the package, on the condition that he ceases bullying. The pair go and dig the package up, but as they are about to part ways, Brett's father, Judge George Newport (Sean Cullen), violently arrives on the scene and Brett is forced to hand the package off to Sidney. Sidney watches the tape, to discover that it is a recording of Judge Newport having sex with an adolescent girl. Sidney and Brett rendezvous and agree to go to the authorities with the tape. Melody calls Sidney and arranges an impromptu date to the fair with him, in which she takes her family's car without permission. At the fair, they bond and Melody admires a small wooden statue at a booth. The carver at the booth, Johan Tidemand (Tim Blake Nelson), gives Sidney the statue for free. Having watched Brett's tape and read Sidney's unflattering personal notebooks, Velouria confronts Sidney and throws them into the fireplace. Sidney informs Brett that the tape is destroyed, prompting Brett to commit suicide. This inspires Sidney to begin writing a controversial novel called \\"Suburban Tragedy\\", which Duane admires and sends to the publisher Harold (Nathan Lane), at Porterhouse, who inks a book deal, with Duane as Sidney's agent. Sidney confronts Velouria about him moving away. She attacks Sidney, who hits his head on a mantelpiece. Sidney and Melody subsequently move away together. At the age of twenty-four, Sidney is a successful, albeit alcoholic, writer with two books- Suburban Tragedy and State of Execution- atop The New York Times Best Seller list and his name in contention for a Pulitzer Prize. He suffers from hallucinations, as his head injury left scarring on the left side of his brain. At a book signing, Sidney meets an obsessed fan called Henry Crowe, who quotes Suburban Tragedy and speaks of knowing what must be done. Shortly after, Crowe attempts murder and commits suicide, casting the book in a negative light, leading to a competitor on the list, Francis Bishop, to win the Pulitzer. With his marriage with Melody failing, Sidney has a discreet, ongoing affair with Harold's daughter, Alexandra (Margaret Qualley). Melody informs Sidney that she is pregnant, though she insists that he is honest if he is having an affair, which he denies. He reveals that he purchased their dream house in New Mexico. While Sidney and Melody are at a restaurant, Alexandra confronts them, revealing the affair. Sidney and Melody make their way to their apartment, and while Melody attempts to leave in the elevator, the power goes out, trapping them. Melody suffers an asthma attack and due to not having her inhaler, dies in Sidney's arms in the elevator. Sidney leaves his apartment with the keys inside. At the age of thirty, Sidney has not been seen nor heard from in five years. Downtrodden, he spends his time going from library to library, burning copies of his books. An apparent detective, The Searcher (Kyle Chandler), traces his steps and interviews those who have known him, including librarians, Duane and Johan, who forged identities for him. After making his way to New Mexico and riding on trains with his dog, Sidney is arrested for having an open alcohol container in public. The Searcher bails Sidney out of jail and takes him for breakfast, where he reveals himself to be Francis Bishop, wishing to write a biography about Sidney. Francis takes Sidney to the house in New Mexico, where Francis reveals that the positive influence from Suburban Tragedy dissuaded his son from committing suicide. The writers part ways. Sidney's health takes a turn for the worse from the seizures and effects from alcoholism, putting him in a terminal state in the hospital. Sidney summons Francis, who he gives all his writings to and reveals the secrets about the inspiration for Suburban Tragedy, as well as Judge Newport's perversion. Sidney goes silent and Francis departs from the hospital room. Sidney sees a vision of Melody and, taking the form of his eighteen year-old self, holds her hand as he passes away.

The inspiration for the screenplay was that Christensen and Dolan mused about the differences in life between the ages of eighteen and when they would turn thirty. They initially considered to make the titular character into an influential rock musician, but decided to go with the route of him being an author, when they realized the expectations of creating new music that could realistically be considered groundbreaking. Wesley received the completed draft of the screenplay, which he described in an interview as, \\"one of the most beautiful things [he] ever read in [his] life\\". Wesley presented the screenplay to William Morris Endeavor, which signed both Christensen and Dolan. The screenplay for Sidney Hall was first reported to have been acquired through a discretionary fund by Scott Free Productions in 2008. Joe Russo was to direct, Michael Costigan was to be the producer, Ridley Scott and Tony Scott were to be the executive producers and Jim Sturgess was to play the titular character. After the release of his feature length directorial debut in 2014, Before I Disappear, Christensen looked to Sidney Hall as his next project, which had not seen active development by Fox Searchlight Pictures in five years. A number of film production companies, including Amazon Studios, aggressively pursued rights to the film, but Christensen opted to have the film independently produced and financed. Casting For casting the titular protagonist that Jim Sturgess was previously attached to portray, Shawn Christensen auditioned a significant number of young male actors, before twenty-four year-old Logan Lerman was cast to play the character for all three stages of his life portrayed. According to Lerman, he was brought onto the project a year prior to the commencement of principal photography and assisted Christensen and producer Jonathan Schwartz with executive producing. On April 13, 2016, Lerman's involvement with the project was revealed, along with Elle Fanning playing opposite of him. On April 21, Michelle Monaghan, Kyle Chandler and Nathan Lane were announced to have joined the principal cast, as well. Variety revealed on April 25 that Blake Jenner, Margaret Qualley and Tim Blake Nelson had joined the cast. Filming Principal photography of the film began on April 22, 2016 at the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, in Pleasantville, New York. Approximately a third of the film takes place in a suburban setting, inspired by Christensen's hometown of Wappingers Falls, New York. However, due to a tax credit that made production less expensive, the suburban scenes were shot in Rockland County, New York. The cinematographer, Daniel Katz, shot the film with an Arri Alexa Studio and predominantly with natural lighting, as well as different kinds of lights for the three stages of the main character's life. The production team considered utilizing traditional photographic film, but opted for digital cinematography, due to the feasibility of utilizing it for an independent production. According to Logan Lerman, an excess of footage was captured, in order to create more options for the post-production stage. The production featured twelve-hour work days, beginning in April and going into May, shot between New York and New Mexico. Music Darren Morze, who composes all of Christensen's films, was hired to do the music for The Vanishing of Sidney Hall. Utilizing a computer in his home's recording studio, Morze began composing the music prior to the principal photography stage, which allowed for the music to be played on set, to help the actors understand the mood of their scenes. Morze and Christensen considered a number of sources of inspiration for the score, including Vangelis and John Carpenter. Due to tonal needs, they decided to pursue a score complementary of Philip Glass's work- even including a single composed by him. Contrary to Christensen's previous works that featured somber soundtracks, Morze looked to give The Vanishing of Sidney Hall a generally more hopeful tone. According to Morze, he committed more time to composing in August 2016 and continued to work alone on the score for the film until just prior to its release in January 2017. Release Sidney Hall premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival, in Park City, Utah. The film was first screened on January 25, 2017. In April 2017, A24 and DirecTV Cinema acquired distribution rights to the film. The film, re-titled \\"The Vanishing of Sidney Hall\\", was released on January 25, 2018, through DirecTV Cinema before a limited release on March 2, 2018, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 20, 2018 by Lionsgate Home Entertainment. The film grossed $923,465. in worldwide theatrical box office, and $176,242 with home video sales. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 11% based on 27 reviews and an average rating of 2.62/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 18 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". Writing for RogerEbert.com, Glenn Kenny gave it no stars and a thumbs down, and called it \\"worthless woman-hating garbage\\". Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times called it a \\"risible indie drama\\" that \\"grates as both an agonized-artist pity party and a male fantasy of envied power\\". At The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that the cinematography and performances can not save the film from its pretentiousness.

They are best-remembered for their self-titled album released in 1966 on Liberty Records. The Deep Six started out as a folk trio in San Diego California, before adding members to their roster and expending into full electric band. They were a predominantly male group backing a female vocalist sometimes referred to as \\"Miss Dean Cannon.\\" They did a seventeen-week stint as the house band at the Land of Oden, a folk club located in La Mesa, which co-owned by their co-manager, Ken Mansfield. They would release a single for Liberty Records, a subsidiary of Capitol Records, featuring the song \\"Rising Sun\\" on which Jim Messina of Buffalo Springfield contributed a guitar part. The band promoted the song on both \\"American Bandstand\\" and \\"Where the Action Is\\" in 1965 and 1966 respectively. The Deep Six went on to record a self-titled album for Liberty, in which many of Los Angeles' finest session musicians played parts. The album included the Cannon sung take on Bob Lind's \\"Unlock the Door,\\" as well as covers of the Rolling Stones' \\"Paint it Black\\" and Neil Diamond's \\"Solitary Man.\\" It featured a photograph of the band running along the waters' edge of a California beach. The album and the band's subsequent singles failed to chart. Original member, Dave Gray departed and was replaced by Barry Kane, previously in the New Christy Minstrels and a duo with Barry McGuire. Eventually the group broke up. Their manager, Ken Mansfield, went on to become an executive at Capitol Records and would become the first U.S. manager for the Beatles' Apple label in 1968.

Plot During a climb up Kangchenjunga, a mountaineer named Um Hong-gil (Hwang Jung- min) saves the life of Park Moo-taek (Jung Woo) and his friend Park Jeong-Bok (Kim In-kwon), in the aftermath he warned them never to climb mountains again. A few days later he and his crew got a project and he needs new members. One of his crew members introduced him to two young members who happen to be the ones he asked not to climb mountains.

A quarrel between the wrestlers erupts and Peterson suggests they settle it in the ring. So much publicity ensues that the match is televised live. Sam is confident he will win, as is Colette, who requests his autograph. Sam is getting the better of George for a while, but is suddenly pinned, defeated and does not get up. He is dead. George is clearly the prime suspect if this is a murder, while Peterson gets in hot water at the police department for proposing the match in the first place.

The film was produced by Youssef Chahine and written by Abd al-Rahman, Ali al-Zarqani, and Naguib Mahfouz. The film is regarded as not only highlighting the story of an important female revolutionary, but also showing the struggle of the Algerian people against the French occupation. Jamila, the Algerian is the first and only multimedia narrative to focus solely on the role of Algerian women in the 1954 revolution. The film was released only a year after the torture and arrest of Djamila Bouhired, and it was banned by the Algerian government for decades. Despite this, Chahine's first explicitly political film managed to galvanize wide solidarity with the Algerian resistance from across the Arab World, starting in Egypt.  Plot  Jamila is a young Algerian woman living with her brother Hadi and uncle Mustafa in the Casbah neighborhood of Algiers during the French occupation of Algeria. as she sees the full extent of injustice, tyranny, and cruelty unleashed on her compatriots at the hands of the French soldiers. Although early on she questions whether her country's resources truly belong to the people of Algeria, Jamila's nationalist spirit is truly awakened when she witnesses French forces invade her university and attempt to arrest her classmate Amina, due to her involvement with an Algerian resistance organization, before Amina commits suicide through ingesting poison. Soon after, prominent Algerian guerrilla leader Yusef takes refuge in her home, prompting further intrigue by Jamila. Only then does she realize that her uncle Mustafa is a part of this anti-colonial network of rebel fighters. After insisting on joining the ranks of Algerian guerrilla fighters, her uncle connects her with the National Liberation Front (FLN). A series of events illustrate Jamila's participation in militant operations against the French before she is eventually wounded and captured by the French Colonel B√©jart. The majority of the remainder of the film focuses on the physical and psychological torture she endures for refusing to give the names of the other guerrilla fighters. Ultimately, despite the efforts of her French lawyer, Jamila is sentenced to death following her violent interrogation.  Cast  * Magda as Jamila Bouhired * Ahmed Mazhar as Yusef * Salah Zulfikar as Azzam *Zahra Ela as Bou-Azza *Rushdy Abaza as Colonel B√©jart *Kariman as Hassiba *Farida Fahmy as Simone *Hussein Riyadh as Justice Habib *Mahmoud El-Meliguy as French Lawyer *Fakher Fakher as Mustafa Bouhired *Adly Kasseb as Leader of the Algerian Resistance *Suleiman El-Jundi as Hadi Bouhired *Nadia al-Jundi as Mujahida Alia  Themes  While the 1966 film The Battle of Algiers, released four years after Chahine's film, has received criticism for portraying a gendered iconography and misrepresentation of Algerian \\"mujahidat\\" (female freedom fighter), Jamila, the Algerian is regarded as the first and only film to focus solely on the role of the women only mentioned in other multimedia projects. In fact, Djamila Bouhired is only one of three women briefly shown in The Battle of Algiers. Chahine's film paints the Algerian struggle against French occupation through one of many lenses of its gendered narrative, focusing a large portion of the film around the rape and torture of Djamila Bouhired  Reception   Support from Egyptian Government  The film was released during Egypt's pan-Arab Nasserist era, when the culmination of pan- Arab sentiment allowed filmmakers like Chahine to take on large-scale production of projects that would positively portray revolutionary Arab leaders like Nasser. With the government's signing of the nonalignment pact of 1955, the Egyptian nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956, and the Algerian revolution, the context allowed Chahine to contribute to the cultivation of the indigenous Third Worldist, anti-colonial rhetoric displayed in the film.  Banning of the film in Algeria  Despite the fact that the film was seminal to gathering support from other Arab countries against the French, the film was banned in Algeria both under French occupation and post-independence. Some believe this was due to Djamila Bouhired's marriage to French lawyer Jacques Verg√®s, but others believe this was a tactic on the part of the Algerian government to further silence both the heroic role of women in the revolution and the highlighting of rape and torture in their narratives.

It is located in the town of √Ökrehamn located on the western coast of the island of Karm√∏y. It formerly was the main church for the √Ökra parish which is part of the Karm√∏y prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Stavanger. The white, wooden church was built in a long church design in 1820 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 320 people. History View of the church before the sacristy was added in 1899. The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1301, but the church was likely built during the 12th century. Around 1600, the old medieval stave church was heavily renovated and rebuilt. In 1674, the church was described as being dilapidated, so major repairs were again carried out. In June of 1820, the old church was torn down and a new building was constructed on the same site. On 5 November 1820, the church held its first worship service, just five months after the old one was demolished. It was formally consecrated on 29 July 1821. In 1852, the nave was extended to the west. In 1899, a sacristy was built on the east end. Shortly after the turn of the century, there was talk of building a new church on √Ökra, but instead of new construction, the old church was restored both in the 1930s and again during the 1950s. The most recent restoration was made in 1970 when the church was stiffened with steel construction, made by Skudenes St√•lindustri. In 1985, a new √Ökra Church was built about to the southeast (on the other side of the road). After the new church was completed, the old church was taken out of regular use and has been used mostly for special occasions since that time.

Career Henry was born in Dublin, performed there and in London, and went to Jamaica with Charles Storer and his family about 1762. He made his New York debut at the opening of the John Street Theatre on December 7, 1767 playing the role of Aimwell in The Beaux' Stratagem. He is said to have been the first to play the role of Peter Teazle in The School for Scandal in America. At the end of the American Revolution, after additional time in England and Jamaica, he returned to America and worked with Lewis Hallam Jr. to manage the American Company. He left the company in 1794 after disagreements with actor John Hodgkinson, who he had brought to the United States in 1792.

He rode in a private coach, which was unusual for the time, and though seen as ostentatious he maintained it was because he had gout. Henry also had two wives, sisters with the surname Storer who were both actresses. The first wife Jane, and their two young children, died at sea during a ship fire in 1767 off the coast of Newport, Rhode Island. Henry and Jane's younger sister Ann survived.

He was the fifth President of Transylvania University. Coit, elder son of Thomas Coit, M.D., and Mary W. (Saltonstall) Coit, of New London, Conn., was born in that city, June 28, 1803. He graduated from Yale College in 1821. While in College he intended to follow his father's profession, but in 1823 he began the study of theology in Andover Seminary. In 1824 he removed to Princeton Seminary, but remained only a few months. He was ordained deacon in the Protestant Episcopal Church by Bishop Thomas Church Brownell, June 7, 1826, at Newtown, Conn. His first parochial charge was as Rector (1827‚Äì29) of St. Peter's Church, Salem, Mass., where he was advanced to the priesthood by Bishop Alexander Viets Griswold, November 15, 1827. He was next Rector of Christ's Church, Cambridge, Mass., from Easter, 1829, to Easter, 1835. In 1831 an Episcopal Theological School was begun in Cambridge, and Coit was made Professor of Biblical Learning; this position he held (in connection with his rectorship) until he became in 1835 the President of Transylvania University, Lexington, Ky., and Morrison Professor of Metaphysics and Moral Philosophy. He published in 3 834 a duodecimo edition of the Bible, arranged in paragraphs and parallelisms, with annotations, which was republished in England; in the same year he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Columbia College, that of Doctor of Laws was conferred by Trinity College in 1853. He resigned the office of President in 1837, and was for two years Rector of Trinity Church, Brooklyn, N. Y. In May, 1839, he became the Rector of Trinity Church, New Rochelle, N. Y., where he continued for ten years. While thus occupied he published a vigorous polemic, entitled Puritanism (New York, 1845, pp. 528, 12mo). He also prepared in 1844 a valuable report on the Standard Edition of the Prayer-Book, under appointment of the General Convention. In 1849 he accepted the appointment of Professor of Ecclesiastical History in Trinity College and for the next five years resided in Hartford. In May, 1854, he went to Troy, N Y, as Rector of St Paul's Church ; and about the same time the Berkeley Divinity School (an outgrowth from Trinity College) was established at Middletown, Conn., in which Dr. Coit continued to give instruction in the department which he had previously held in the college. He resigned the charge of a parish in 1872, and in February, 1873, became a resident professor in the Berkeley Divinity School, where he continued until his death there, from Blight's disease, June 21, 1885, at the age of 82.

Built in 1847, it is considered the third-oldest and largest all-wood-frame house still standing in Minnesota. It was the home of brothers Martin and John Mower, who established one of the first sawmills on the St. Croix River and the community around it. The house and the remnants of the nearby mill were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as the John and Martin Mower House and Arcola Mill Site for having local significance in the themes of architecture, exploration/settlement, and industry. The property was nominated as an \\"excellent example\\" of Greek Revival architecture and for its association with the region's early settlement and lumber industry. The property now operates as a non-profit event and education center. Description The mill's chimney abutted by a derelict 20th-century summer cottage Arcola Mills is located north of Stillwater, Minnesota. The house is a two-story wood-frame structure with clapboard siding. It originally had a simple rectangular footprint of . The Mowers added additions to the west and south in the 1870s, but these have since been removed. The east fa√ßade of the house, which faces the river, has a full-width porch topped by a deck accessed from the upper floor. Greek Revival elements include corner pilasters and broken pediments at the gable ends. The sawmill was a few hundred feet north of the house. Still standing is a stone chimney. A 20th-century summer cottage has been built up against the chimney upon the mill's original foundation. Other remnants include an engine mount and an embankment for a sluiceway. Establishment John Mower, originally from Maine, moved to St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, in 1842 to work in the lumber industry. His brother Martin settled in Stillwater the following year and John soon joined him on the Minnesota side of the river. With three business partners, Martin established the sawmill north of town in 1847. Two of his partners immediately cashed out while John bought into the enterprise. The brothers built their home adjacent to the mill and established the town of Arcola around it for their employees. Town structures included a general store, a one-room schoolhouse, a boarding house, and shops for carpentry, blacksmithing, and boat-building. John Mower served in the 1854 Minnesota Territorial Legislature and Mower County was named in his honor. Martin Mower worked as the managing owner of the St. Croix Boom Company. John had a wife and children but Martin remained a lifelong bachelor. The original sawmill was powered by a water wheel in an enclosed wheelhouse over a spring-fed stream. In 1856 the Mowers rebuilt the mill and converted to steam power, doubling their annual output. Three years later they installed a new steam engine and other equipment, more than doubling their annual output again. By the 1870s, however, the brothers were engrossed in other endeavors and closed the mill. Later history The house remained in the Mower family, but by the mid-1930s it was vacant when newlyweds Henry and Katharine Van Meier chanced upon it while collecting ferns. They fell in love with the old structure and arranged to purchase it for a summer home. Over the years they assembled a collection of small cottages on the property for use by friends, family, and artists. Katharine Van Meier died in the early 1990s, establishing in her will the Arcola Mills Historic Foundation to preserve the property. Volunteers raised funds and had the house largely restored over the first decade of the 21st century. Arcola Mills now serves primarily as an event venue. From 2010 to 2013 the house also hosted a volunteer-run visitor center for the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway, but this partnership with the National Park Service proved economically unfeasible for the Arcola Mills foundation because it could not provide any rental income.

The exercise is designed to prepare the Russian Air Force and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to undertake coordinated air intercept missions against hijacked civilian aircraft. Four such exercises have been held. Background Billed by its Russian, American, and Canadian participants as a first-of-its-kind exercise for the former Cold War adversaries, Vigilant Eagle was described by Russian Air Force Col. Alexander Vasilyev as a means to \\"develop procedures and bring the relationship between our countries closer together to unite our countries in the fight against terrorism‚Äù. The groundwork for Vigilant Eagle was laid in a June 2003 meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia between President of the United States George W. Bush and President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin. Coming less than two years after the September 11 attacks, and in the aftermath of an increase in Russian-American tensions resulting from the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the meeting saw progress in developing informal comity for bilateral cooperation in areas of anti-terrorism. Exercises Vigilant Eagle 2010 Russian and Canadian Air Force officers fly together aboard a simulated hijacked aircraft during Vigilant Eagle 2010. The first Vigilant Eagle exercise was planned for 2008 but postponed until 2010 due to the South Ossetia War. According to the U.S. government, that exercise marked \\"the first live-flying event between Russia and the United States since the Second World War.\\" Vigilant Eagle 2011 A second Exercise Vigilant Eagle was held in 2011. In the exercise scenario, a U.S. civilian airliner operating near the Russia‚ÄìUnited States northern border was seized by terrorists and flown towards Russia. The scenario was then repeated in reverse, with an aircraft originating in Russian airspace violating NORAD's Alaskan Air Defense Sector where it was intercepted and \\"repelled from North American airspace.\\" The exercise tested the ability of the Federal Aviation Administration to contact both Russian Air Force and NORAD authorities and of NORAD and the Russian Air Force to effectively liaise with each other in tracking and intercepting the hijacked aircraft. The aircraft used to represent the U.S. airliner was a civilian-crewed passenger aircraft chartered from Global Aviation. CF-18s of the Royal Canadian Air Force and Su-27s of the Russian Air Force escort a simulated hijacked aircraft during Vigilant Eagle 2013. Vigilant Eagle 2012 Vigilant Eagle 2012 was a command post exercise (CPX) held in 2012 that, for the first time, did not include live-flying aircraft, instead using computer simulations. Vigilant Eagle 2013 Exercise Vigilant Eagle 2013 was conducted in August 2013. The exercise again involved a live-flying element with CF-18s of the Royal Canadian Air Force intercepting a civilian airliner west of Mount McKinley after the aircraft reported a \\"hijacking\\" following take-off from Ted Stevens International Airport. The mission was then handed off to the Russian Air Force as the aircraft passed over the international boundary. After completion of the mission, the exercise was repeated in reverse with a Russia-originating aircraft reporting a \\"hijacking\\" on an approach toward the international boundary. Future exercises A planned Vigilant Eagle 2014 was suspended due to tensions between the United States and Canada on one side, and the Russian Federation on the other, over the War in Donbass. The exercise would have involved, for the first time, the Japan Air Self Defense Force. According to American and Canadian officials, the exercises were canceled at their initiative.

She was a pioneer in the study of infertility. Biography Sophia Kleegman was born on July 8, 1901 in Kiev, Russian Empire to Israel and Elka Siergutz Kleegman. In 1906 her family emigrated to the United States, settling in New York. She was accepted into the second coeducational class of Bellevue Hospital Medical College (now the New York University School of Medicine) in 1920. Following her graduation in 1924, she held a residency at the Chicago Lying-in Hospital. Thereafter she practiced gynecology and obstetrics. In 1929 she was appointed to the faculty of obstetrics and gynecology at the New York University College of Medicine. She was the first woman to be appointed to the faculty. She joined the attending staff of Bellevue Hospital that same year. From the 1930s on, Kleegman published several papers on the diagnosis and treatment of infertility. She was an early advocate of artificial insemination and the establishment of sperm banks. She had a highly successful private practice. Kleegman became a clinical professor in gynecology and obstetrics in 1953. She led Bellevue's infertility clinic from 1958 until 1971.

A member of the faculty of the Vermont College of Fine Arts MFA in children's and adult literature, Kurtz is an international advocate for literacy and writing. She was also part of a small group of volunteers who organized the not-for-profit organization, Ethiopia Reads, which has established more than seventy libraries for children, published books, and built four schools in rural Ethiopia.  Early life  Kurtz was born in Portland, Oregon, to missionary parents, who moved the family to Ethiopia when she was two years old. Her parents, the Rev. Harold and Pauline (Polly) Kurtz, worked for the Presbyterian Church in Ethiopia for twenty-three years. After two years of language study in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, her parents moved their four children to Maji, Ethiopia in the far southwest of the country. The journey up to Maji‚Äîusually in a Jeep‚Äîtook all day to drive thirty-two miles. Sometimes the family traveled by mule, a two-day trip. Maji, which was at an 8000-foot altitude, was where Jane first learned to read as Polly Kurtz homeschooled Kurtz and her sisters. The family spent one year in Boise, Idaho when Kurtz was in second grade. After returning to Ethiopia, Kurtz was home schooled for one additional year before leaving Maji to attend fourth grade at Good Shepherd boarding school in Addis Ababa. Except for spending her eighth-grade year in Pasadena, California, she would remain at Good Shepherd through her junior year of high school. One of her middle-grade novels, Jakarta Missing (Greenwillow/HarperCollins), is the fictional story of what it was like to leave East Africa to spend a teenaged year in the United States. Following in her parents' footsteps, Kurtz was admitted to Monmouth College (Illinois) after her junior year of high school and graduated in 1973 as a psychology major. During graduation ceremonies, she was involved in a crash of a small plane piloted by her father, while visiting her family in Ethiopia. She spent about six months in a body cast before beginning her work life. In Carbondale, Illinois, she worked at the Carbondale New School, a private alternative school for students in kindergarten through sixth grade, first as a writing teacher, next as director, and finally teaching a combined class of third- and fourth-graders. When her husband, Leonard Goering, accepted a position in Trinidad, Colorado, she spent five years teaching English at Trinidad Catholic High School. She also served as the director of a not-for-profit organization, Trinidad Downtown Area Development and was a member of the Colorado Council on the Arts before moving to Grand Forks, North Dakota, where she completed her master's degree in English and taught as a senior lecturer in the English department.  Professional writing career  Years spent reading and discussing books and writing with young people encouraged Kurtz to try to publish her own stories. Her first picture book, I‚Äôm Calling Molly (Albert Whitman), was inspired by watching her son interact with a next-door neighbor. For her second picture book, Fire on the Mountain (Simon & Schuster), Kurtz began to reach back to the stories of her childhood in Ethiopia. Fire on the Mountain was the first picture book illustrated by E.B. Lewis who went on to illustrate more than seventy books for children and to win the Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award and Caldecott Honor Award. Fire on the Mountain received a starred review, was a Children's Book of the Month Club selection, and has remained in print for more than twenty years. Kurtz's first middle-grade novel, The Storyteller's Beads (Harcourt), is an attempt to show what life was like in Ethiopia during the time of \\"red terror\\" after her family moved back to the United States. Her goal was to evoke the realities of children encountering conflict and the danger of war. The novel is based on real-life events in Ethiopia after Christianity, Islam, and Judaism (Beta Israel) were all put under intense political pressure in Ethiopia during the 1970s and 1980s and many Ethiopians fled to refugee camps in the Sudan. From there, thousands of the Beta Israel were flown to Israel in air lifts with striking nicknames such as Operation Moses and Operation Joshua. Kurtz has written that she was moved to begin drafting the story after reading eyewitness accounts of some of those who made the journey. She has also written picture books about the beauty of Ethiopia, including Water Hole Waiting (Greenwillow/HarperCollins), co-authored by her brother Christopher Kurtz. Another book co-authored with her brother is Only a Pigeon (Simon & Schuster), a true story of a shoeshine boy who became friends with her brother when Christopher Kurtz returned to Ethiopia as a young adult to teach in a girls‚Äô school in Addis Ababa. In 1997, Kurtz was able to return to Ethiopia after having been away for twenty years. That spring, she was invited to conduct author visits at the International Community School, Bingham Academy, and Sandford International School. After completing the author visits, she traveled to Lalibela and Gondar, a trip that would later lead to Kurtz's writing of a historical fiction middle-grade novel for American Girl, Saba: Under the Hyena's Foot, set in 1846 when Gondar was in decline as the Ethiopian capital. When she returned to North Dakota, she was only home a few days before she and her family had to leave their house that was in the first neighborhood to be evacuated during the 1997 Red River flood. They spent six weeks in Walhalla, North Dakota, during which time Kurtz flew to Atlanta to be part of a presentation at the International Reading Association, speaking about the power of encouraging children to capture their real lives through the rhythms and imagery of poetry, a practice she began at the Carbondale New School and continued during years of Writer in the Schools projects. Shortly after returning to clean up the house she and her own children had lived in since they had moved to Grand Forks, she created what became the picture book River Friendly River Wild (Simon & Schuster), the text of which won the Golden Kite Award from the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators. Kurtz also drew on her flood memories for tornado scenes in her 2013 novel Anna Was Here (Greenwillow/HarperCollins). She often describes that novel as \\"a story of life's big questions and a few puny answers.\\" A reviewer in the New York Times called it \\"sweetly funny\\" and \\"a moving-day classic, destined to sidestep its boxed-up brethren for the important job of steadying someone's shaky little hands.\\" Kurtz has been invited to speak in forty states of the United States and in various countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Her presentations are often praised for their wittiness, their ability to connect with young writers, and their emphasis on the life-changing power of reading. She was also invited to be part of \\"Laura Bush Celebrates America's Authors,\\" a day of literacy celebration prior to U.S. President George Bush's 2001 inauguration, during which fourteen children's book authors were honored and then conducted presentations in Washington D.C. schools. In April 2008, when Kurtz was performing author visits in Indonesia and Cambodia, she was contacted by an editor at American Girl about writing two books to be sold with Lanie, American Girl Doll of the Year 2010. Inspired by the students at Pasir Ridge International School in Palikpapan, Indonesia, who provide support for the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, Kurtz created a secondary character, Dakota, Lanie's best friend, who goes to Indonesia and works with orangutans. In 2011, Kurtz returned to the Pasir Ridge International School to show the students the book that had been partially inspired by them. One student wrote, \\"I would like to help animals, but I can‚Äôt help these.\\" He then listed his favorites and the reasons he couldn't help them. A seal? Too far. A snake? Too scary. A lion? Too strong. A penguin? Too far. He concluded that he had been inspired to catch krill, an important part of the food web, and ended, \\"Even poor people can help animals.\\" Kurtz wrote the books Lanie and Lanie's Real Adventures while she was living in Lawrence, Kansas, where her son and daughter-in-law were attending college at the University of Kansas. She decided to create a character who engages in citizen science to help save monarch butterflies after reading about Monarch Watch, a cooperative network of students, teachers, volunteers and researchers based in Lawrence.

History and profile Enab Baladi newspaper was first launched in 2011 by a group of citizen journalists and activists from Daraya, a Syrian town in Damascus suburbs. On January 29, 2012, issue #0 was published marking the beginning of a revolutionary newspaper. Since then, it has been printed each week on Sundays, with one two-week stoppage in August 2012 due to Darayya massacre committed by Assad forces. Enab Baladis mission is to serve a role in educating Syrian citizens through in-depth public interest reporting, including investigative journalism and news reports to elevate important social topics at the local level. Enab Baladi helps advance a democratic society in Syria by producing independent and credible journalism that informs the Syrian public about important issues. Every week, a new issue of Enab Baladi newspaper is published. The publishing process takes two forms: print and digital. The print version is distributed in Syria as Enab Baladi currently prints around 7,000 copies every week and distributes them in northern parts of Syria (Aleppo and suburbs, Latakia and suburbs, and Idlib and suburbs) and in Turkey to Syrian refugees. The printing takes place in Turkey and then shipped to Syria. Enab Baladi used to print and distribute in the southern parts of Syria but after Assad forces destroyed its office and equipment in Daraya, the team was forced to start printing and distributing in northern Syria. The PDF version of the newspaper reaches hundreds of thousands of subscribers and fans, whether through electronic distribution list, Enab Baladi website and/or social media pages including over 0.65 million Facebook fans. Since its establishment during the first year of the Syrian uprising, late 2011, Enab Baladi (EB) has focused on promoting the peaceful resistance methods to counter the sectarian and violence narratives of the Syrian regime. Enab Baladi succeeded in providing the Syrian people with trusted information about events in Syria through its weekly newspaper. EB coverage included the human rights violations perpetrated by the Syrian regime, as well as the inception of the nascent Syrian civil society, in addition to various news and topics in the fields of politics, economy, and social affairs. Growth The newspaper grew from amateur-run organization into becoming one of the most prominent Syrian media organizations according to BBC Syria profile page. Currently, Enab Baladi produces several products, Enab Baladi Weekly Newspaper, the Enab Online News Service Website, The Syrian Print-Media Archive, and its latest English news website. These projects are supported by a network of reporters and journalists who strive to give credible reports from the ground in Syria. Enab Baladi succeeded in drawing the attention of many local and international media. Its story appeared on BBC, France 24 Channel, Spiegel Online International, The Guardian, Al-Arabiya, and Al- Jazeera among many others. The French famous magazine ‚ÄúELLE‚Äù published a story about EB's women team, ‚ÄúTHE \\"GANG OF GIRLS\\" RISKS THEIR LIVES TO REPORT FROM INSIDE A WAR ZONE‚Äù. Around ten women are working as reporters, editors, and translators for EB. ELLE article tells the story of one of them, Kholoud Waleed, and highlights the role that women played in the establishment of the newspaper, the challenges they faced during their work as citizen journalists in Syria and the success they achieved. Partnerships, alliances, and coalitions Enab Baladi built relationships with many international organizations such as National Endowment for Democracy, Internews, Free Press Unlimited, European Endowment for Democracy, l‚ÄôAssociation de Soutien aux M√©dias Libres, Adopt a Revolution, L'agence fran√ßaise de coop√©ration m√©dias, Norwegian People‚Äôs Aid, and International Media Support. Enab Baladi also joined many alliances and coalitions: * The Ethical Journalism for Syria Alliance (EJSA) in partnership with more than 30 Syrian independent media organization and funded by Free Press Unlimited. The alliance aims at restoring and improving the basic fundamental rights of freedom of speech, thought, and expression in Syria via a gender sensitive multi-level approach. * The International Coalition of Sites of Conscience (ICSC), and implemented a project of documenting the verbal heritage of the Syrian conflict in partnership with ICSC. * The Syrian Network for Printed Media (SNP) with four other Syrian independent newspapers, through which, EB is printing and distributing its issues inside and outside Syria. * The Syrian Regional Program (SRP) to provide media exposure to Local Councils in Syria, the Assistance Coordination Unit (ACU), in addition to multimedia reports about local initiatives inside Syria.

Described as a \\"stocky right-arm leg-spinner who gave the ball plenty of air, and who relied on flight and sharp spin in the manner of Arthur Mailey to trap his victims\\", Williams's best performance with the ball was against Queensland at the Adelaide Oval in December 1923, where he took 6/40 with match figures of 12/195. However, the arrival of Clarrie Grimmett for the 1923/24 season relegated Williams to South Australia's second choice spin bowler\\"Death of Former State Cricketer\\", Chronicle (Adelaide), 5 June 1947, p. 42. and was selected only once in 1924/25 and not at all during the 1925/26 season. In 1926/27, however, Williams had an excellent season for Port Adelaide, ultimately taking 80 wickets at 14.83 for the season,Sando, p. 172. and was recalled to the South Australian side. In his first match back for South Australia, against Victoria at the Adelaide Oval, Williams took match figures of 12/234, compared with Grimmett's 3/227 and Victorian spinner Don Blackie's 10/245. During the season, Williams was called \\"probably the most improved bowler in Australia, ... his length is now fairly accurate. and he can turn the ball both ways. His \\"bosey\\" ball is cunningly concealed, and has proved most troublesome. Williams is one of the most popular players in South Australian cricket and has an ideal temperament for the game.\\"Improved Slow Bowler\\", News (Adelaide), 1 January 1927, p. 3. Williams was the biggest wicket taker in first-class cricket in 1926/27, taking 35 wickets at 32, compared to Blackie with 33 at 24.6, Grimmett 30 at 34.3 and Mailey 20 wickets at 42. Williams's improved form saw him selected for \\"The Rest\\" against an Australian XI, played at the Sydney Cricket Ground starting on 18 February 1927, where he took 6/174. In October 1927 Williams became captain of Port Adelaide succeeding Dave Pritchard. He had a poor season in 1927/28, taking only five wickets at 73.00 and while he took 24 wickets at 34.9 in 1928/29, Williams retired from first-class cricket with his final appearance in January 1929, for South Australia against New South Wales, taking 2/95. He continued in district cricket until 1943, taking 894 wickets for Port Adelaide at 18.85.Sando, p. 138. This remains the record number of wickets taken in the Adelaide district competition.Sando, p. 170. Eleven times, and nine in succession, Williams was the leading wicket taker in a district cricket season. Outside of cricket Williams was a dentistTheir tribute\\", The Kadina and Wallaroo Times, 6 June 1947, p. 1. and became involved in horse racing as an owner. He owned leading racehorse Ramssare as part of a syndicate and later became the sole owner of Jack Parr, who won an ARC grand national steeple- chase.Kneebone, H. \\"Ex-Cricketer's Death\\", The Advertiser, 2 June 1947, p. 12. Williams died suddenly on 31 May 1947, aged 47. In recognition of his district cricket accomplishments, the scoreboard at Port Adelaide's home ground Alberton Oval, was named in Williams's honour.Sando, p. 49. South Australian wicketkeeper and Port Adelaide captain Gordon Inkster paid tribute to Williams, saying that \\"had he applied himself more seriously he would most certainly have made one of the world's greatest bowlers of his type. On numerous occasions when he could have secured many of the closing wickets, he refrained from so doing, to enable another of the younger bowlers to procure a wicket or two, with the result that he was responsible for the developing of several young bowlers to the advantage of both club and State.\\"Kneebone, H. \\"Tribute to N.L.

He is a past president of the Biophysical Society and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Biography Raised in Santiago, Bezanilla took an early interest in science. When Chile hosted the 1962 World Cup, it was uncommon for people to own televisions, so Bezanilla and a friend began building their own television to watch the tournament. While the rudimentary TV was not completed in time for the World Cup, Bezanilla later built a better TV with commercial parts from Argentina, and Bezanilla's family used it for many years. Bezanilla earned an undergraduate biology degree as well as master's and Ph.D. degrees in biophysics, all from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Initially intending to earn a medical degree, Bezanilla shifted his focus to research and the Ph.D. program, finding that he liked how neurophysiology combined two of his interests, electronics and biology. He conducted research on the nerve cells of Humboldt squid at the Montemar Institute of Marine Biology. Leaving Chile for the United States in 1969, Bezanilla completed a postdoctoral fellowship with the National Institutes of Health. While in the US, Bezanilla heard that the Humboldt squid was no longer available in Chilean waters. Also noting the political changes in Chile under Augusto Pinochet, he decided to stay in the US. Working on gating current experiments, he became a frequent collaborator with Clay Armstrong, who he had met at Montemar. In experiments at Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory, Bezanilla and Armstrong built their own signal averaging device and became the first to measure the tiny gating currents in sodium channels. In 1977, Bezanilla became a neuroscience professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and later joined the University of Chicago, becoming the Lillian Eichelberger Cannon Professor in the Department of Pediatrics. Bezanilla was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2006. He was the 2013-2014 president of the Biophysical Society. Some of his recent work includes the application of light pulses to gold nanoparticles to activate neurons. Bezanilla's daughter Magdalena is a biologist and university professor.

Geography  The municipality lies about 12 meters above sea level, with its northern border on the Gulf of Cariaco. The Marig√ºitar River runs through the municipality into the gulf. Besides the capital, the municipality has seven main population centers: Guaracayar, G√ºirintar-Carenero, La Soledad, Sotillo, La chica, Golindano, and Petare. It is accessible by trunk road 09 that runs west-east from Cuman√° to San Antonio del Golfo, and by sea from the gulf. Despite bordering the coast, in 2019 the municipality began to suffer from severe water shortages. There have been infrastructure works since 2000 to improve the safe water flow in the municipality, works which have seen over 15,000 laborers from the local community and which have been largely funded by local export companies.  Economy  The economy of this municipality is based primarily in fishing, but there is also some tourism. Combining both, the municipality also engages in promoting aquatourism. Based in Marig√ºitar, are several large fish and seafood packaging companies. The municipality has some hotel complexes and native cultural food outlets, for the national and international tourists that come because of its beaches and landscapes. There are also about 10 pharmacies in the municipality, which began selling suncream for tourists as well as providing medicines for the locals.  Government  The municipality is governed by a mayor and a council, all of whom are elected and are affiliated with a national party. The current mayor is H√©ctor Frontado, who was previously the mayor of neighboring municipality Mej√≠a from 2013-17.

Originating from a tropical wave, Sandra was first classified as a tropical depression on November 23 well south of Mexico. Environmental conditions, including high sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, were highly conducive to intensification and the storm quickly organized. A small central dense overcast developed atop the storm and Sandra reached hurricane status early on November 25 after the consolidation of an eye. Sandra reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 934 mbar (hPa; 27.58 inHg) early on November 26\\\\. This made Sandra the strongest November hurricane on record in the Northeastern Pacific. Thereafter, increasing shear degraded the hurricane's structure and weakening ensued. Rapid weakening took place on November 27 and Sandra's circulation became devoid of convection as it diminished to a tropical storm that evening. The cyclone degenerated into a remnant low soon thereafter and ultimately dissipated just off the coast of Sinaloa, Mexico, on November 29\\\\. As the precursor to Sandra traversed Central America, it produced unseasonably heavy rainfall that triggered flooding and landslides. Four people died in various incidents related to the system: three in El Salvador and one in Honduras. Initially expecting a landfalling storm, officials in Northwestern Mexico prepared equipment for power outages, closed schools, and evacuated 180 residents. Sandra's effects largely consisted of light to moderate rainfall; some traffic accidents and landslides resulted from this, though the overall impacts were limited. Meteorological history On November 6, 2015, a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean. Only sporadic convection‚Äîshower and thunderstorm activity‚Äîaccompanied the system as it traveled west for the next ten days. As it reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 17, westerly winds associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone spurred the development of an area of low pressure and extensive convection. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted potential for the system to develop into a tropical cyclone; however, persistent wind shear inhibited this system from consolidating before it reached Central America. The system emerged over the Pacific Ocean near Nicaragua on November 21; once back over water, convection blossomed near the low's center. Convection remained largely disorganized over the following two days as the system progressed westward in response to a subtropical ridge to the north. A Tehuantepec gap wind event in conjunction with horizontal wind shear spurred development of a vortex within the disturbance and a well-defined low formed by 12:00 UTC on November 23. Six hours later the low acquired sufficient convective organization, including elongated banding features to the north, to be classified Tropical Depression Twenty-Two-E. At this time, the depression was situated 435 mi (705 km) south- southwest of Acapulco, Mexico. Aided by high sea surface temperatures of , ample ocean heat content and low wind shear, the small system quickly intensified into a tropical storm‚Äîat which time the NHC assigned it the name Sandra‚Äîand developed a central dense overcast. A prominent banding feature with cloud tops below and frequent lightning formed north of the circulation on November 24. By 18:00 UTC, a wide eye became apparent, signaling the onset of rapid intensification. An intensifying Tropical Storm Sandra on November 24 Throughout November 25, Sandra dramatically strengthened as deep convection blossomed around a tightening and clearing eye. The system achieved hurricane status by 06:00 UTC and major hurricane status‚ÄîCategory 3 or higher on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale‚Äîby 00:00 UTC on November 26\\\\. Prominent outflow became established atop the cyclone and further aided the intensification. Throughout the strengthening phase, a mid- to upper-level trough near the west coast of North America created a weakness in the subtropical ridge, prompting Sandra to turn north around the western edge of the high. Sandra reached its peak intensity as a high-end Category 4 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on November 26 with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 934 mbar (hPa; 27.58 inHg). By this time, the hurricane's eye shrunk to less than 6 mi (10 km) in diameter. Within hours, however, increasing wind shear began to impact the circulation and caused convection to become asymmetric. Concurrently, the system started a turn northeast toward mainland Mexico as it rounded the ridge. Steadily increasing wind shear gradually unraveled Sandra during the latter part of November 26 and into November 27. The storm's outflow, though prominent to the north, became restricted on the southern side. Sandra briefly regained organization around 00:00 UTC on November 27, with its eye becoming redefined; however, persistent shear prevailed and the system weakened below major hurricane status by 06:00 UTC. The hurricane rapidly deteriorated throughout November 27 as convection became displaced to the northeast of the circulation. The low-level circulation soon decoupled from the mid- to upper- level circulations and Sandra degraded to a tropical storm by 00:00 UTC on November 28. The convectively devoid low-level circulation abruptly turned northwest in response to a shallow ridge. Failing to redevelop convection atop its center, Sandra degenerated into a remnant low by 06:00 UTC. Sustained winds dropped below gale-force by 18:00 UTC. Intense thunderstorm activity did blossom to the northeast of the center late on November 28, prompting the storm to resume a northeasterly course. Sandra's remnants eventually succumbed to strong shear and opened up into a trough, roughly 60 mi (95 km) southwest of Culiac√°n, Mexico, late on November 29. Records Reaching tropical storm status on November 24, Sandra was the fourth-latest forming tropical storm in the Northeastern Pacific basin since reliable records began. Upon becoming a hurricane at 06:00 UTC on November 25, Sandra was the second-latest such storm on record in the Northeastern Pacific; only Hurricane Winnie of 1983‚Äîthe only December hurricane on record in the basin‚Äîformed later. This also marked the record-tying 16th hurricane to form in the Pacific north of the equator and east of the International Dateline; this record is shared with 1990, 1992, and 2014. When it further became a major hurricane at 00:00 UTC on November 26, Sandra was the latest-forming such storm in the Northeastern Pacific basin on record. It surpassed the previous record set by Hurricane Kenneth in 2011 by nearly four days. Sandra was also the ninth major hurricane in the Northeastern Pacific proper and the eleventh east of the dateline, both setting a record for the most in a single season. Sandra's peak intensity with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and pressure of 934 mbar (hPa; 27.58 inHg) ranked it as the strongest November hurricane on record in the Northeastern Pacific, surpassing Hurricane Kenneth's 145 mph (230 km/h) and 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg). On a global scale, Sandra was the 30th major hurricane and \\"record- shattering\\" 25th Category 4 or 5 storm of 2015; the previous records were 23 and 18, respectively, occurring in both 1997 and 2004. Preparations and impact Hurricane Sandra succumbing to strong wind shear on November 27\\\\. Note part of the low-level circulation exposed on the west side of the central dense overcast The precursor to Sandra produced unseasonably heavy rains across parts of Central America, leading to flooding. In Nicaragua, flooding affected 55 homes and destroyed 1, primarily in Managua. A total of 56 families required evacuation. Local officials blamed the flooding on trash- clogged drains. Five people were injured in the Nueva Segovia Department when an ambulance crashed on a foggy, rain-slicked road. A landslide in Cucuyagua, Honduras, destroyed a home killing a 25-day-old baby and injuring four others. In Nueva Esparta, El Salvador, two people drowned after being swept away by the swollen El Amatal River. Flooding in Ozatl√°n killed one person and inundated homes in Jiquilisco, prompting the evacuation of 14 families. Moisture from Sandra streamed northward into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi River Valley and contributed to widespread rainfall and flooding. Heavy rains affected portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. The Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex received of rain on November 27, their wettest November day on record; this total contributed to breaking the city's wettest-year on record. Mexico On November 26, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for Baja California Sur between Todos los Santos and Los Barriles; this was discontinued less than 24 hours later. The State Council of Civil Protection of Baja California Sur opened four shelters in both Cabo San Lucas and San Jos√© del Cabo; school officials cancelled classes for November 27. In La Paz, the Federal Electricity Commission deployed 96 trucks to handle potential power outages. On November 27, a tropical storm warning was raised for mainland Mexico between Altata and San Blas as well as the Islas Mar√≠as; the warning was discontinued the following day as Sandra rapidly dissipated. Alerts were raised across portions of Sinaloa and Nayarit in advance of the hurricane. The port of Mazatl√°n suspended operations on November 28 and public shelters were opened in the city. Water pumps, generators, and relief crews were mobilized at the port. About 180 people from the small community of Boca Camichin, Nayarit, evacuated inland. The storm also prompted delay of the annual Marat√≥n Pac√≠fico. On November 27, Sandra produced wind gusts up to 40 mph (65 km/h) on Socorro Island as the storm moved 115 mi (185 km) southeast of the island. Effects from Sandra were minor and limited due to its dissipation offshore; rainfall was limited to in most areas and largely considered beneficial. In contrast to predictions of of rain across Baja California Sur, only fell in San Jos√© del Cabo while other areas of the Los Cabos Municipality received a trace to no accumulation. Wet roads in Cabo San Lucas resulted in two accidents that left three people injured. In Chihuahua, minor landslides damaged roads.

The book was first published in hardback by Balzer + Bray on March 18, 2014 and a paperback edition was released the following year. An audiobook narration was performed by Cassandra Campbell and Kirby Heyborne. Side Effects May Vary focuses on a teenager that has been recently diagnosed with leukemia and has decided to take revenge on her enemies. Murphy wrote the book as part of National Novel Writing Month around 2010. While writing Murphy chose to have her character of Alice behave in a way that she felt might alienate some readers, justifying this decision by stating that \\"A book is always going to be about the best or worst part of a character‚Äôs life. Sometimes we shine. Sometimes we don‚Äôt. Alice definitely does not, but by the end she‚Äôs begun to find her road to redemption.\\" Synopsis Alice is sixteen and has been diagnosed with leukemia. She's been warned that she may not have long to live, so Alice has decided that she's going to use her remaining time in order to accomplish things she's always wanted to do, even if doing so may come across as cruel or unkind. Her friend Harvey has agreed to assist her during this process and together the two manage to exact revenge on her ex- boyfriend and enemies, while also taking part in positive things like revisiting her past. However just as she's managed to complete her plans for revenge, Alice discovers that she's in remission - and will live. Now she has to deal with the fallout from her actions and try to find a way to deal with what she's done and her complicated feelings for Harvey, who has always loved her. Reception Critical reception for Side Effects May Vary has been mixed and the book has received praise from the School Library Journal and Booklist. The Horn Book Guide and Commonsensemedia were both mixed in their opinions, as they enjoyed the work but felt that the shifting between past and present could be seen as confusing or excessive. The Horn Book Guide also stated that the book had the potential to appeal to fans of The Fault in Our Stars.

She committed suicide in 1934, the first Chinese actor to have done so. Her suicide inspired Cai Chusheng's classic film New Women starring Ruan Lingyu, who also killed herself soon after the release of the film. Life and career Ai Xia was born Yan Yinan () on November 29, 1912 in Tianjin to a large middle-class family. She attended university. After graduating, she fell in love with her cousin and had a child. Her family disapproved of the relationship, resulting in her lover leaving. In 1928, she was in an arranged marriage but, as a personal protest, left home for Shanghai to pursue a career in film. Ai Xia started her career as a stage actor with the South China Theater Society (Nanguo jushe), founded by Tian Han, before joining the Leftists Dramatists League (Zuoyi juzuojia lianmeng). She was introduced to Mingxing (Star) Film Company in 1932. She wrote a book Xiandai yi N√ºxing (A Woman of Today) in 1933. The book was adapted as a film in the same year. Despite the intrigue around the story, the film was not well received by critics because of its focus on revolution. Ai Xia was one of only two female screenwriters during the \\"Left-Wing\\" movement in Chinese film. She starred in a total of eight films in her lifetime.  Death and legacy  Ai Xia Ai committed suicide in 1934 by consuming raw opium. Being the first actress in the Republic of China to do so, her death is considered iconic in Chinese film. The film New Women is based on her life. It stars actress Ruan Lingyu who also committed suicide shortly after the film's release in 1935. It is speculated that director Cai Chusheng may have been romantically involved with Ai and thus, made the film for personal reasons.

These comets probably come from the Oort cloud, a cloud of comets orbiting the Sun from ~10,000 to roughly 50,000 AU.

It has an exhibition area of , and houses around 1.2 million objects. Facilities and collection The Reiss-Engelhorn-Museum is one of the major museums in Mannheim and comprises four exhibition halls presenting exhibits in archaeology, world cultures, history of art and culture, photography and history of theater and music. The main facility is the Zeughaus Museum, which features exhibit areas for art, decorative art and cultural history, theater, literature and antiquities. The International Photography Forum, located on the fourth floor, displays photographs from the permanent collections ranging from 19th century to contemporary works and presents exhibitions. The World Cultures Museum features displays of archaeology from the Metal Ages up through the Roman era, as well as medieval Germany, and ancient Egyptian art and culture. The Bassermannhaus Museum of Music and Fine Arts features a large collection of musical instruments from around the world. The Schillerhaus Museum is an 18th-century house that presents the life of Friedrich Schiller. Wikimedia lawsuit In 2015, the museum filed a lawsuit against the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikimedia Deutschland over the use of photographs of public domain artworks on the Wikimedia projects. In June 2016, a Berlin court (Landgericht Berlin) ruled that digitizing paintings that are in the public domain creates new copyrights, even if the intent is to create a faithful image of the public domain work. The lawsuit was dismissed with respect to Wikimedia Deutschland on the basis that it was not responsible for the files which are managed in the U.S. by the Wikimedia Foundation, which latter organization expressed the intent to appeal the decision.Landgericht Berlin judgment in the Reiss- Engelhorn Museum v. Wikimedia Foundation case (in German) In a related case, in May 2017, the Oberlandesgericht of Stuttgart ruled with reference to the concept of property (Sacheigentum). Property is addressed by article 14 of the German constitution. The Stuttgart court ruled that under German law already skill and effort restricts a photo under rules for 50 years, even though no creativity is involved and thus the more elaborate restrictions of a Lichtbildwerk do not apply (70 years pma). The court has allowed an appeal to the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof). On December 20, 2018, the court decided in favour of the museum.

It contains residential, commercial, and office units designed and developed by Italpinas Development Corporation (IDC), a firm specializing in green architecture. It is also an eco-friendly, iHeartCDO When In Manila Italian-inspired property constructed along the principles of sustainable architecture such as generating its own energy, minimizing power usage, and maximizing natural light and ventilation. The first tower was completed in 2012, while the second tower was completed in 2014. In 2015. Primavera Residences was given the EDGE certification awarded by International Finance Corporation as the first completed condominium project in East Asia and the second development in the Philippines.  Architecture and Design  Primavera Residences is a 10-storey twin-tower condominium complex, which is the first green building in Cagayan de Oro City. It is also the first project of IDC in the city. IDC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Romolo Valentino Nati, who is also a sustaining member of the Philippine Green Building Council, designed the twin towers himself. The first tower of the condominium complex has a total of 162 residential and commercial units, while the second tower has 166. The shape, volume, and profiles of each tower were specifically chosen by Arch. Nati so that air will enter the lower levels of the tower and then travel upward through the courtyard, thereby creating a funnel effect that ensures the even distribution of air to all condominium units. The design was inspired by the traditional Bahay Kubo‚Äîa stilt house made of organic materials like bamboo, coconut leaves, and grass‚Äîwhich Arch. Nati sees as the quintessential sustainable house. IDC has incorporated the green architecture of the Bahay Kubo concept in all of its projects. The Primavera Residences project was named Best Condo Development Inquirer.net in the Philippines during the Southeast Asia Property Award (SEAPA) in 2011 and Best Mixed-Use Development in the 2014 Asia Pacific Property Awards.  Biomimicry  Biomimicry studies the models, designs, elements, systems, and processes of nature and then imitates these to provide solutions to human problems. Although the concept has been around for years, it is only now being introduced in the Philippines by IDC. IDC realized that in the past, human development didn‚Äôt pose much of a problem where the environment is concerned. Our consumption of natural resources was in balance with nature‚Äôs requirements for the replenishment of those resources. They are also well aware that today, that balance has been broken by the collective misconception that natural resources are ours for the taking and that they will never run out. The IDC team knows that the Philippine cities of today were built with the wrong mindset and this mindset has to be changed first if the Philippines ever hopes to change their cities for the better. The concept of biomimicry also dictates that property developers in any city should avoid copying property models from around the world because what may be ideal for one place isn‚Äôt necessarily ideal for another. For Primavera Residences, IDC figured that the anthill model is the best one to mimic; hence, the central column in each building. This column is patterned after the hollow opening of an ant colony, which is used primarily for ventilation and for the transportation of materials. The column also lets natural light into the building, thereby reducing the need for artificial lighting. Arch. Nati says the IDC design process is primarily based on performance. They rely on the idea that the things that perform well are the things that are most likely to proliferate and remain in existence for the long term. And for projects like Primavera Residences, the main green features are the buildings themselves. Another benefit of the design are the savings on construction costs, which allow the developer to offer the condominium units at very affordable prices. The savings on electricity also means lower association dues. Other IDC projects that adopt biomimicry in their design are the Coral City (inspired by corals) in Quezon City and Miramonti (inspired by sponges) in Sto. Tomas, Batangas.  Green Features  The structure of Primavera Residences is able to withstand strong earthquakes and other kinds of major natural calamities. Its green features include: * The biomimicry-inspired building orientation, which creates a funnel effect that results in even distribution of air across all units * Brise soleil shelters on its fa√ßade that provide shade and protect the windows during the hottest part of the day and reducing internal temperature in the condo units * Photovoltaic solar panels on the rooftop to produce its own energy * Extended awnings to maximize light and shadow * Green inner courtyard that acts as natural chimney, allowing cool breeze to flow naturally into the building * Unit cross-ventilation for indoor heat reduction * Natural light coming into the condo units through the inner courtyard Residents of the building save as much as 32% on energy consumption‚Äîspecifically air conditioning use‚Äîbecause of Primavera Residences‚Äô natural ventilation and heat reduction features. It is also expected that Primavera‚Äôs photovoltaic cells will start feeding the city‚Äôs local distribution utility grid once the Net Metering Law is implemented. This will bring the condominium‚Äôs electric bill down even more, thereby further reducing the residents‚Äô respective electric bill  Amenities  Primavera Residences is equipped with modern amenities such as an indoor saltwater swimming pool with Jacuzzi, a multipurpose hall, a gym, 24/7 security inclusive of a TV security system, shops and restaurants on the ground floor, and an inner courtyard. These amenities have recently been named among the country‚Äôs most promising clean energy investment opportunities during the Climate Technology Initiative-Private Financing Advisory Network (CTI-PFAN) Philippines Clean Energy Investor Forum.  Awards  IDC has received several awards for their Primavera project. Among these awards are the following: * Philippine Green Building Council-Leadership in Green Building Award 2016 (Philippines, 2016) * EDGE ( Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) awarded by IFC World Bank (Philippines, 2015) * International Property Award for Best Mixed-use Development in the Philippines (Kuala Lumpur, 2014) International Property Award winners from Asia Pacific 2014 The Philippine Star News Manila Bulletin * CTI-PFAN Asia Forum for Clean Energy Financing Business Plan Competition Top 10 (Singapore, 2013) * Southeast Asia Property Awards‚ÄîHighly Commended for Best Condo Development in the Philippines (Singapore, 2011) Inquirer.net * CTI-PFAN for one of the Most Promising Clean Energy Investment Opportunities in the Philippines (Manila, 2010) BusinessWorld  Green Initiative  Primavera Residences is part of Pueblo de Oro Township‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreen Initiative\\", Property Report as it complements the other environment-friendly projects in the area, which includes the 40-hectare Pueblo Urban Rainforest as well as the electric shuttles that serve Pueblo residents. And Primavera‚Äôs involvement in the Green Initiative isn‚Äôt limited to the sustainable design of the condominium complex; Primavera staff also joins other stakeholders in planting endemic tree species (wildlings) in the Urban Rainforest. The goal is to eventually plant a total of 30,000 wildlings in the forest.

Created and written by Ori Elon and Yehonatan Indursky, the series premiered on 29 June 2013 on yes Oh. It commenced distribution via the online streaming service Netflix in 2018. The show runs at 12 episodes per season. In May 2019, writer Yehonatan Indursky announced that the show would be renewed for a third season. On April 8, 2020, series producer Dikla Barkai confirmed that production of a third season of Shtisel, intended to begin in May 2020, had been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Kveller stated in June 2020 that production of Season 3 has begun. A trailer was released in September, revealing that Season 3 is set seven years later.  Overview  The series follows the lives of Shulem Shtisel (Dov Glickman), the Shtisel patriarch and a Rabbi at the local yeshiva, as well as those of the other members of his family. Shtisel is set in a religious, Internet-free neighborhood. The community follows strict haredi customs and violating the norms often causes chaos within the family. However, the characters who are more open to a secular lifestyle reflect Geula's moderation in comparison to their neighbors in Mea She'arim, the adjacent community known for religious extremism.

Akiva starts working as a teacher in the Yeshiva, and falls in love with Elisheva Rothstein, the mother of a student in his class, who has been widowed twice. He asks the matchmaker K√∂nigsberg to set up a meeting for them, much to the chagrin of his father, who wants him to marry a single, younger woman. They meet once at the insistence of Akiva, and she refuses to continue. Shulem urges Akiva to meet with 19-year-old Esti. On their second meeting, Akiva, still in love with Elisheva says he is not yet ready for marriage, and Esti starts to cry. Faced with guilt, Akiva proposes marriage and they get engaged. Giti Weiss, the daughter and the sister of the Shtisel‚Äôs says goodbye to her husband Lippe Weiss, who flew to Argentina for six months as part of his job as a butcher. Rumors surface that he has run away with a Gentile. Giti is disgraced and looks for work to provide for her 5 children. She works as a babysitter for a secular woman and then exchanges money at home. She confesses the hardship her husband has put them through only to her eldest daughter Ruchami. Zvi Arye, the brother of Giti and Akiva is competing for a teaching job at the Kolel, where he studies hard but loses due to his wife constantly taking him away to trap a rat. Grandmother Malka, Shulem‚Äôs mother, lives in a nursing home and is exposed to television for the first time in her life, which Zvi Arye and Shulem find abhorrent and come up with many ways to sabotage her from viewing. Akiva finds another job as a painter. He prepares paintings for Fox, a well- known Ultra-Orthodox artist. Their agreement consists of Akiva painting for him, and Fox selling the paintings as if they were his own. Shulem is also on the quest for love and maintains a certain relationship (Mainly includes shared meals) with Aliza, a divorced secretary who works in his Talmud Torah. However, his refusal to clarify his intentions with her motivates her to look elsewhere. Akiva, still harboring doubt about his engagement, consults with his uncle, who cancelled a match and has remained single all his life. His uncle tells him to ask for Elisheva‚Äôs opinion. In an emotional conversation, she tells him that she is too old for him and refuses him once more. Despite this he informs Esti‚Äôs father that he does not love Esti, and Esti‚Äôs father angrily cancels the engagement. The enraged Shulem expels Kiva from his home. Kiva sleeps in different places, until Shulem and Akiva reconcile.  Reception  The series is considered innovative for its treatment of an irregular group of Orthodox Jews by stripping them of their political associations and depicting them as ordinary people. In April 2019, Maurice Yacowar (retired film studies professor and author of The Sopranos on the Couch, Continuum) published an episode by episode analysis of the [first] two Shtisel seasons, titled \\"Reading Shtisel: A TV Masterpiece from Israel\\". In October 2016, it was announced that Amazon Studios was planning to remake Shtisel, set in Brooklyn, New York, under the title Emmis. In May 2019, Shtisel was renewed for a third season. In May 2019, a dispute with the Israeli Actors‚Äô Association delayed the signing of contracts for the third series. In August 2019, producer Dikla Barkai said, ‚ÄúWe cannot confirm Season 3 yet. There are many reasons. Let‚Äôs hope. We are thinking positively.

History  Mughal emperor Aurangzeb died in 1707 after a 49-year reign without officially declaring a crown prince. His three sons Bahadur Shah I, Muhammad Azam Shah, and Muhammad Kam Bakhsh fought each other for the throne. Azam Shah declared himself successor to the throne, but was defeated in battle by Bahadur Shah. In the meantime Kam Bakhsh moved to Bijapur where he established his own empire. His forces were later engaged in battle by the Shah's army and Kam Bakhsh was killed.  Principals  * Prince Muzzam at Jamrud along with his sons Prince Jahandar Shah, Prince Azim-ush-Shan at Bengal, Prince Rafi-ush-Shan at Malakand Fort, Prince Jahan Shah at Agra Fort, Muzzam Rule (Kabul Subah, Bengal Subah, and Malakand Fort). Consort - Nizam Bai (daughter Of Raja of Amber). * Prince Azam Shah at Ahmednagar His sons Prince Bidar Bakht at At Gujarat, Prince Jawan Bakht At Gujarat, Prince Sikandar Along his father, Prince Wala Jah at Belapur Fort in Deccan Subah, Azam Rule (Gujarat, and Mirza Part of Deccan). Consort - Sabana Begum (daughter of Persian Ruler). * Prince Kam Bakhsh At Bijapur with his All sons And Support by Aurangzeb queen consort Diwani Begum. Consort - Jamilat Begum (daughter of Sulan Nazir Mirza Of Bihar) * Prince Musa Khawja at Lahore with his Brothers, Prince Umar Mirza at Badakhshan, Prince Sultan Muzzam at Deccan Half Part, Prince Akbar and Prince Nasir with his father Aurangzeb, Khawja (Multan, Orisha, Mathura, Badakhshan, Berar, Half Deccan, Kanthkot Fort). Consort - Najib begum (Daughter Of Wali ahd Azam shah). * Prince Hasim Mirza at Khandesh With his Only Brother Imam and Support By Nadira Begum the chief consort Of Mughal Empire (Khandesh)  Conflict between Azam Shah and Bahadur Shah  Aurangzeb left a will advising his sons to divide the empire among themselves. At the time of his death his eldest son Bahadur Shah I inhabited Jamrud, 12 miles west of Peshawar in present-day Pakistan. His second son Muhammad Azam Shah lived in Ahmednagar in present-day India. Khafi Khan suggested that whoever reached the capital city of Agra first would capture the throne. The distances to Agra from Jamrud and Ahmednagar were 715 and 700 miles, respectively. Azam Shah and Bahadur Shah were involved in an armed conflict at Jajau, near Agra (current day Uttar Pradesh, India). The ensuing battle led to the death of Azam Shah and his three sons on 20 June 1707. Azam Shah and the other royals who died in battle were buried in Humayun's Tomb, Delhi.  Conflict between Bahadur Shah and Kam Bakhsh  Shah's half- brother, Muhammad Kam Bakhsh, marched to Bijapur in March 1707 with his soldiers. When the news of Aurangzeb's death spread through the city, the city's monarch, King Sayyid Niyaz Khan surrendered the fort to Baksh without a fight. Once on the throne, Kam Bakhsh proclaimed the Bakshi (general of the armed forces) Ahsan Khan. His advisor Taqarrub Khan was made chief minister. Kam Bakhsh proclaimed himself Emperor Kam Bakhsh - Protector of Faith (Padshah Kam Bakhsh-i-Dinpanah). He then conquered Kulbarga and Wakinkhera. Taqarrub Khan formed a conspiracy to eliminate Ahsan Khan, alleging that meetings of Ahsan Khan, Saif Khan (Kam Bakhsh's archery teacher), Arsan Khan, Ahmad Khan, Nasir Khan and Rustam Dil Khan (all of them Kam Bakhsh's former teachers and members of the then court) to discuss public business were a conspiracy to assassinate Kam Bakhsh \\"while on his way to the Friday prayer at the great mosque\\". After informing Kam Bakhsh of the matter, he invited Rustam Dil Khan for dinner and had him arrested en route. Rustam Dil Khan was crushed under the feet of an elephant, Saif Khan's hands were amputated, and Arshad Khan's tongue was cut off. Ahsan Khan ignored warnings by close friends that Kam Bakhsh would arrest him, which then occurred and he was imprisoned and his property seized. In April 1708, Shah's envoy Malabar Khan came to Kam Bakhsh's court. When Taqarrub Khan told Kam Bakhsh that Malabar Khan intended to dethrone him, Kam Bakhsh invited the envoy and his entourage to a feast and executed them. In May 1708, Shah sent a warning letter to Kam Bakhsh that he hoped would prevent him from proclaiming himself an independent sovereign. Shah then began a journey to the Tomb of Aurangzeb to pay his respects to his father. Kam Bakhsh replied, thanking him \\"without either explaining or justifying [his actions]\\". When Shah reached Hyderabad on 28 June 1708, he learned that Kam Bakhsh had attacked Machhlipatnam (Bandar) in an attempt seize over three million rupees' worth of treasure hidden in its fort. The subahdar of the province, Jan Sipar Khan, refused to hand over the money. Enraged, Kam Bakhsh confiscated his properties and ordered the recruitment of four thousand soldiers for the attack. In July, the garrison at the Gulbarga fort declared its independence and garrison leader Daler Khan Bijapuri \\"reported his desertion from Kam Bakhsh\\". On 5 November 1708 Shah's camp reached Bidar, 67 miles (108 km) north of Hyderabad. Historian William Irvine wrote that as his \\"camp drew nearer desertions from Kam Bakhsh became more and more frequent\\". On 1 November, Kam Bakhsh captured Pam Naik's (zamindar, the landlord of Wakinkhera) holdings after Naik abandoned his army. On 20 December 1708, Kam Bakhsh marched towards Talab-i-Mir Jumla, on the outskirts of Hyderabad, with \\"three hundred camels, [and] twenty thousand rockets\\" for war with Shah. He made his son Jahandar Shah commander of the advance guard, later replacing him with Khan Zaman. On 12 January 1709, Shah reached Hyderabad and prepared his troops. Although Kam Bakhsh had little money and few soldiers left, the royal astrologer had predicted that he would \\"miraculously\\" win the battle. At sunrise the following day, Shah's army charged towards Kam Bakhsh. His 15,000 troops were divided into two bodies: one led by Mumin Khan, assisted by Rafi-ush-Shan and Jahan Shah, and the second under Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung. Two hours later Kam Bakhsh's camp was surrounded, and Zulfiqar Khan impatiently attacked him with his \\"small force\\". With his soldiers outnumbered and unable to resist the attack, Kam Bakhsh joined the battle and shot two quivers of arrows at his opponents. According to Irvine, when he was \\"weakened by the loss of blood\\", Shah took him and his son Bariqullah prisoner. A dispute arose between Mumin Khan and Zulfikar Khan Nusrat Jung over who had captured them, with Rafi-us-Shan ruling in favour of the latter. Kam Bakhsh was brought by palanquin to Shah's camp, where he died the next morning.

A cento is a poetic work composed of verses or passages taken from other authors and re-arranged in a new order. This poem reworks verses extracted from the work of Virgil to tell stories from the Old and New Testament of the Christian Bible. Much of the work focuses on the story of Jesus Christ. While scholars have proposed a number of hypotheses to explain why the poem was written, a definitive answer to this question remains elusive. Regardless of Proba's intent, the poem would go on to be widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, often alongside Augustine of Hippo's De doctrina Christiana. But while the poem was popular, critical reception was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by Pope Gelasius I disparaged the poem, deeming it apocryphal, and many also believe that St. Jerome wrote negatively of Proba and her poem. Other thinkers like Isidore of Seville, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio wrote highly of Proba, and many praised her ingenuity. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent scholars have held the work in higher regard. Origin and style The author of the poem, Faltonia Betitia Proba, was born AD 322. A member of an influential, aristocratic family, she eventually married a prefect of Rome named Clodius Celsinus Adelphius.Kaczynski (2013), pp. 13132. Proba wrote poetry, and according to contemporary accounts, her first work was titled Constantini bellum adversus Magnentium; this poem, which is now lost, recounted the war between Roman Emperor Constantius II and the usurper Magnentius that occurred between AD 35053.Cullhed (2015), p. 24. At some point, Proba converted from paganism to Christianity, and De laudibus Christi, which was probably written AD 352384, was her attempt to \\"turn away from battle and slayings in order to write holy things\\".Kaczynski (2013), p. 132. With the exception of the proem and invocation of the poem, the entirety of De laudibus Christi is a cento (i.e. a patchwork poem) made up of rearranged verses extracted from the works of the Roman poet Virgil.Kaczynski (2013), p. 131.Cullhed (2015), p. 1. Proba's choice to rework Virgil seems to have been made for two reasons: First, Virgil was an influential poet who had been commissioned by Caesar Augustus, the first Roman emperor, to write the mytho- historical epic Aeneid.Comparetti (1895), pp. 114. Arguably the most influential Roman poet, Virgil's artistic clout was immense, being felt well into late antiquity, and he was imitated by Late Latin poets like Juvencus and Prudentius.Ziolkowski & Putnam (2008), p. 475.Comparetti (1895), p. 159. The respect given to Virgil often manifested in the form of centos, which reached peak popularity in the fourth century AD.Ziolkowski & Putnam (2008), p. 469.Comparetti (1895), p. 53. Second, Virgil was often seen as a pre-Christian prophet due to a popular interpretation of his fourth Eclogue, which many believed foretold the birth of Jesus.Ziolkowski & Putnam (2008), p. 470.Comparetti (1895), p. 99. Hardly any names are present in De laudibus Christi. This is because Virgil never used Hebrew names like \\"Jesus\\" and \\"Mary\\", and thus Proba was limited in terms of what she was able to work with. To compensate, Proba used vague words like mater (\\"mother\\"), pater (\\"father\\"), deus (\\"god\\"), and vates (\\"poet\\" or \\"priest\\") to refer to key Judeo-Christian figures. In places, this handicap interferes with readability (according to G. Ronald Kastner and Ann Millin, \\"Necessary passives and circumlocutions brought about by the ... absences in [Virgil] of appropriate terminology render the text impassable at times\\").Kastner & Millin (1981), p. 39. An exception to the poem's lack of names is found in a reference to Moses, whom Proba refers to by invoking the name \\"Musaeus\\". According to the classicist Sigrid Schottenius Cullhed, \\"Proba [probably] used the name Musaeus for the Judeo-Christian prophet, since it was often believed from the Hellenistic era onward that Mousaios was the Greek name for Moses\\".Cullhed (2015), p. 128. Contents Summary The cento's 694 lines are divided into a proem and invocation (lines 155), select stories from the Old Testament books of Genesis (lines 56318) and Exodus (lines 31932), select stories from the New Testament Gospels (lines 333686), and an epilogue (lines 68794).Cullhed (2015), pp. 190231. At the beginning of the poem, Proba references her earlier foray into poetry before rejecting it in the name of Christ. This section also serves as an inversion and thus rejection of the Virgilian tradition: whereas Virgil opened the Aeneid by proclaiming that he will \\"sing of weapons and a man\\" (arma virumque cano), Proba rejects warfare as a subject worthy of Christian poetry.Stevenson (2005), pp. 6566. Proba then describes herself as a prophet (vatis Proba) and calls upon God and the Holy Spirit (eschewing the traditional invocation of the Muses) to aid her in her work.Stevenson (2005), p. 66. At the end of the invocation, Proba states her poem's main purpose: to \\"tell how Virgil sang the offices of Christ.\\" The passages focusing on the Old Testament concern the creation of the world, the Fall of Man, the Great Flood, and the Exodus from Egypt. Proba's presentation of the Creationlargely based on rewordings of Virgil's Georgicsreorganizes the Genesis narrative to better align it with contemporary Greco-Roman beliefs about the origin of the world.Cullhed (2015), pp. 13840. Cullhed argues that certain aspects of the creation story are \\"abbreviated ... amplified or even transposed\\" so that Proba can avoid repetitive passages, such as the double creation of man (Genesis 1:25‚Äì27 and Genesis 2:18‚Äì19).Cullhed (2015), p. 138.Cullhed (2015), pp. 14142. In the events leading to the Fall of Man, Eve's actions are largely based on the story of Dido from Book IV of the Aeneid, thereby \\"repeatedly foreshadowing ... the imminent disaster of the Fall\\".Cullhed (2015), p. 142.Cullhed (2015), p. 145. The Serpent is described with lines that detail Laoco√∂n's death (from Book II, Aeneid) and the snake sent by the fury Alecto to enrage Amata (from Book VII, Aeneid).Cullhed (2015), p. 151. Proba relies on the first two books of the Georgics (specifically, the sections that discuss the Iron Age of Man) to describe human life after Adam and Eve eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil;Cullhed (2015), pp. 15455. in this way, she connects the Greco-Roman concept of the Ages of Man with the Judeo-Christian concept of the Fall of Man.Cullhed (2015), p. 157. After the story of Creation, Proba briefly references the Great Flood by making use of lines from the fourth book of the Georgics that originally discussed the death of a beehive and the necessity of laws after the end of the Golden Age, respectively. According to the classicist Karla Pollmann, by using lines that concern destruction and the establishment of law, Proba is able to convey the traditional idea that Noah's survival represents the dawning of a \\"second creation and a new order\\" (that is, the Patriarchal age).Pollmann (2017), p. 113. Proba dedicates only a few lines to Exodus before moving onto the New Testament. Cullhed reasons that this is because the Book of Exodus and the remaining Old Testament is replete with violence and warfare that is stylistically too close to the tradition of pagan epic poetrya tradition that Proba expressly rejects in the proem of De laudibus Christi.Cullhed (2015), p. 121. In the transitional section between the Old and New Testaments, Proba appropriates the invocation of the Muses of war that immediately precedes the Catalogue of Italians (from Book VII, Aeneid) and verses that originally described Aeneas's prophetic shield (from Book VIII, Aeneid). According to Culhed, these verses originally functioned as poetic devices, enabling Virgil to move from the \\"Odyssean\\" first half of the poem to the \\"Iliadic\\" latter half. Proba likewise has re-purposed these verses to aid in her transition from the Old Testament into the New.Cullhed (2015), pp. 12223. The portion of De laudibus Christi that focuses on the New Testament recounts the birth of Jesus, his life and deeds, his crucifixion, and the advent of the Holy Spirit. Although Jesus and Mary are featured, Joseph is omitted.Cullhed (2015), p. 164. Jesus is often described by language befitting a Virgilian hero,Cullhed (2015), pp. 158, 17683. and Mary is depicted by lines originally relating to Venus and Dido. Proba's Sermon on the Mount begins by borrowing the Sibyl of Cumae's description of punishment for the unrighteous (from Book VI, Aeneid), and some scholars contend that this portion of De laudibus Christi is the first description of hell in Christian poetry.Cullhed (2015), pp. 16970. Christ's deeds are reduced to three events: calming the sea, walking on water, and the call of the disciples.Cullhed (2015), p. 176. To describe Christ's crucifixion, Proba uses several lines that originally related to warfare, destruction, and death, such as the battle between Aeneas and the Rutuli (from Book XII, Aeneid), the Sack of Troy (from Book II), and the suffocation of Laoco√∂n by giant serpents (from Book II).Cullhed (2015), p. 18182. Notably, Christ is crucified not on a cross, but an oak tree, which Cullhed argues \\"synthesizes Jewish, Roman and Christian religious codes\\", as the species of tree was associated in the Greco-Roman world with Jupiter, and in the Judeo-Christian tradition with the Binding of Isaac.Cullhed (2015), p. 182. After covering Christ's death, Proba borrows lines referring to the erotic love between Dido and Aeneas to represent the decidedly more spiritual love that Christ shares with his disciples.Cullhed (2015), p. 184. The end of the poem focuses on Christ describing the world to come and his ascension into Heaven; Proba conveys the former via the prophecy made by both Celaeno and the Oracle of Delos (both from Book III, Aeneid), and the latter with language that originally described the god Mercury.Cullhed (2015), p. 185.Cullhed (2015), p. 186. Characterization of Jesus Due to her borrowing from Virgil, Proba's Christ is very similar to the Virgilian epic hero.Cullhed (2015), p. 158. Parallels between the two include both seeking a goal greater than their own happiness, initiating realms \\"without end\\", and projecting auras of divinity.Clark & Hatch (1981), p. 31. According to the early Christian specialist Elizabeth A. Clark and the classicist Diane Hatch, Proba's purpose was to \\"imbue the Christ with heroic virtues\\" akin to the Virgilian hero.Clark & Hatch (1981), p. 36. The poet does this in three major ways: First, she describes Jesus as remarkably beautiful,Clark & Hatch (1981), pp. 3334. with \\"a magnificent and commanding presence\\" similar to that of Aeneas.Clark & Hatch (1981), p. 33. Second, during the Crucifixion, Jesus does not go meekly to his death, but aggressively lashes out at his persecutors.Clark & Hatch (1981), p. 34. Her reconfiguration of Jesus's crucifixion is thus in line with Aeneas' vindictive slaying of Turnus described at the very end of the Aeneid. Finally, Proba transfers to Jesus portions of prophecies scattered throughout the Aeneid that detail Rome's glorious future, thus recasting pagan oracles in a Christian light.Clark & Hatch (1981), p. 35. Characterization of Mary The characterization of Mary has caused much scholarly debate. The historian Kate Cooper sees Mary as a courageous, intelligent materfamilias.Cooper (2007), pp. 6667. Clark and Hatch write that Proba stresses Mary's maternity by omitting Joseph and presenting Mary as Jesus's sole human parent. Conversely, the Latinist Stratis Kyriakidis argues that despite Mary's presence in the poem, she lacks feminine attributes, and is thus \\"impersonal\\".Cullhed (2015), pp. 16465. According to Kyriakidis, this is intentional on Proba's part, as it draws attention to Christ's divinityan aspect that \\"would be incompatible with a human, feminine mother.\\" Mary (pictured) to goddesses and prophets through the use of Virgilian language. Cullhed writes that the most scholarly views of Mary in the poem are inadequate, and that Proba made Mary \\"the twofold fulfillment and antitype of both Eve and Dido.\\"Cullhed (2015), p. 165. Cullhed bases this on the fact that line 563 of the fourth book of the Aeneid (from Mercury's speech to Aeneas, in which the god admonishes the hero for lingering with Dido in Carthage) is used in two of the sections of the cento: once, in which Adam admonishes Eve for sinning, and again, in which Mary learns that Herod wants to kill her child. According to Cullhed, the \\"negative characterization\\" of the original verse and its reuse in the Old Testament portion of the cento is transformed into a \\"positively charged ability\\" allowing Mary and Jesus to escape Herod's wrath. Because Mary can foretell the future, she is compared (through the use of Virgilian language) to Greco-Roman goddesses and prophets.Cullhed (2015), p. 166. Proba's character and motivation Because historical information about Proba is limited, many scholars have taken to analyzing De laudibus Christi to learn more about her. According to the classicist Bernice Kaczynski, \\"Scholars have seen traces of Proba's own character in her emphasis on the beauty of the natural world, readily apparent in her account of the creation.\\" The cento suggests that Proba had great regard for \\"domestic matters, for marriage and the family, for marital devotion and [for] filial piety\\". While the New Testament stresses asceticism, Proba seems to de-emphasize its importance, given that topics like virginity and poverty are not stressed in her poem. In regards to issues of finance, Proba reinterprets a number of the New Testament episodes in which Jesus urges his followers to eschew wealth as passages suggesting that Christians should simply share wealth with their families. These changes illustrate Proba's historical context, her socio-economic position, and the expectations of her class. As to why Proba arranged in the poem in the first place, scholars are still divided. The Latinist R. P. H. Green argues that the work was a reaction to the Roman emperor Julian's law forbidding Christians from teaching literature that they did not believe to be true (which is to say, classical Greek and Latin mythology).Green (1995), pp. 55558.Stevenson (2005), p. 67. Proba's goal, Green writes, was to present Virgil \\"without [pagan] gods, and [thus] a [Virgil] no longer vulnerable to Christian criticism\\".Green (1995), p. 558. In this way, a Christian teacher could use the text to discuss Virgil without compromising their religious and moral integrity. Clark and Hatch, on the other hand, postulate that Jesus's Virgilian nature in the cento may have been Proba's attempt to rebut the unflattering, demonizing descriptions of Jesus in Julian's Caesares and Contra Galilaeos. They conclude that the hypothesis is intriguing but unverifiable due to the lack of information about Proba, the date of the cento's creation, and her intentions. Finally, the classicist Aurelio Amatucci suggests that Proba composed the cento to teach her children stories from the Bible,Cullhed (2015), pp. 5253. although there is no solid evidence that the poem was ever intended to be a teaching tool.Plant (2004), p. 171.Cullhed (2015), p. 53. Reception Many scholars believe that Jerome (pictured) criticized the poem. In the late-4th and early-5th centuries, the work began to receive a more mixed response. Many scholars hold that the Church Father Jerome was a critic of the work; in a letter written from Bethlehem to Paulinus of Nola castigating Virgilian centos,Copeland (2016), p. 357. he warned against following an \\"old chatterbox\\" (garrula anus) and those who think of calling \\"the Christless Maro [i.e. Virgil] a Christian\\" (non ... Maronem sine Christo possimus dicere Christianum). Green (1995), p. 553. According to the historian James Westfall Thompson, Jerome \\"strongly inveighed against this method of destroying the sense of a pagan author\\", and that \\"his love of the classics and his Christian piety were alike offended\\" by Proba's actions.Thompson (1906), p. 650. Conversely, Roman Emperor Arcadius (who reigned from AD 395‚Äì408) received a copy of the poem, and his version has a fifteen-line dedication contending that Proba's work is \\"Maro changed for the better in sacred meaning\\" (Maronem mutatum in melius divino ... sensu).Cullhed (2015), p. 190.Stevenson (2005), p. 68. The work was also presented to Empress Aelia Eudocia, the wife of Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II (who reigned from AD 408‚Äì450).Cullhed (2015), p. 59. During late antiquity, a pseudonymous document known as the Decretum Gelasianumwhich was long believed to have been issued by Pope Gelasius I (who held the papacy from AD 492‚Äì496)declared De laudibus Christi to be apocryphal and a \\"reprehensible work of poetry\\".Harich-Schwarzbauer (2006). But almost a century later, Archbishop Isidore of Seville (AD 560‚Äì636) called Proba the \\"only woman to be ranked among the men of the church\\" (Proba ... femina inter viros ecclesiasticos ... posita sola). In regards to De laudibus Christi, Isidore wrote that \\"it is not the work which should be admired, but [Proba's] ingenuity\\" in compiling the poem (Cuius quidem non miramur studium sed laudamus ingenium).Jensen (1996), p. 53.Isidore of Seville, De viris illustribus, V. During the Renaissance, Proba and her work were praised as examples of studiousness and scholarship. In a 1385 letter to Anna von Schweidnitz (the wife of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV), the Italian poet and scholar Petrarch referenced Proba and her work while discussing female geniuses,Cox (2008), p. 18. and in 1374 the humanist Giovanni Boccaccio included Proba in his biographical collection of historical and mythological women entitled De mulieribus claris.Cullhed (2015), p. 25. In 1474, the poem was published by the Swiss printer Michael Wenssler, which likely made Proba the first female author to have had her work reproduced by a printing press.Worth 2015, p. 66. In 1518, Proba's work was once again being used in an educational setting, this time by John Colet of St Paul's School, who believed that Proba \\"wrote ... wysdom with clene and chast Latin\\".Stevenson (2005), p. 69. Scholarship in the 19th and early 20th century was more critical of De laudibus Christi.Cullhed (2015), p. 56.Cullhed (2015), pp. 66‚Äì67. Some classicists and philologists of the era cite the work as an example of late antiquity's \\"poverty of ideas\\". In 1849, William Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology called the poem \\"trash\\" worthy of \\"no praise\\",Smith (1849), p. 134. and in 1911, P. Lejay of The Catholic Encyclopedia wrote that \\"the action of the poem is constrained and unequal, the manner absurd, [and] the diction frequently either obscure or improper\\".Lejay (1911). Despite these rather negative appraisals, contemporary scholars have taken a renewed interest in the poem,Kaczynski (2013), p. 133. and many see it as worthy of study. Cullhed, in particular, considers the work \\"of considerable historical and cultural importance [for] it belongs to the small number of ancient texts with a female author and stands out as one of our earliest extant Christian Latin poems.\\"Cullhed (2015), p. 6. The first English-language work dedicated in its entirety to Proba and her poem was the 2015 monograph, Proba the Prophet, written by Cullhed.Cullhed (2015). Authorship controversy right The poem is traditionally attributed to Faltonia Betitia Proba largely on the assertion of Isidore, who wrote in his Etymologiae that De laudibus Christi was the product of a woman named Proba who was the wife of a man named Adelphus (Proba, uxor Adelphi, centonem ex Vergilio ... expressit).Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae, I.39.26. But the classicist and medievalist Danuta Shanzer has argued that the poem was not the work of Faltonia Betitia Proba, but rather her granddaughter, Anicia Faltonia Proba, who lived in the late-fourth and early-fifth centuries.Green (1995), p. 551. Shanzerwho is of the opinion that Faltonia Betitia Proba likely died in AD 351bases much of her assertion on supposed date inconsistencies and anachronisms within the text. For instance, Shanzer points out that lines 13‚Äì17 of De laudibus Christi strongly resemble lines 20‚Äì24 of the poem Carmen contra paganos, which was written sometime after Faltonia Betitia Proba's death. Shanzer also claims that De laudibus Christi alludes to a notable debate about the date of Easter that took place in AD 387, thereby suggesting that the poem must date from the latter part of the fourth century. Finally, Shanzer argues that the reference to the war between Magnentius and Constantius in the work's proem precludes the possibility that Faltonia Betitia Proba arranged De laudibus Christi, due to the fact that the war took place in the same year as her supposed death. Shanzer rounds out her hypothesis by also invoking a textual argument, noting that the author of De laudibus Christi is often referred to in later manuscripts by titles that only Anicia Proba would have received, such as \\"mother of the Anicians\\" or the \\"eminent Roman Mistress\\". In her 2015 book Proba the Prophet, Cullhed counters Shanzer's claims, first by noting that there is no definitive evidence that Faltonia Betitia Proba died in AD 351 and that such an assertion remains speculative at best. Cullhed also argues that \\"there are no 'grounds for determining priority of the poem's opening lines, and that the supposed reference to the AD 387 debate about Easter could have likely referred to an earlier, perhaps less famous dispute. As to the titles found in later manuscripts, Cullhed writes that it is likely that they were erroneously inserted during the Middle Ages by scribes who had understandably confused the two Probas. Cullhed also reasons that if Anicia Proba had written De laudibus Christi, the Latin poet Claudian would have almost certainly praised her poetic abilities in his AD 395 panegyric celebrating the joint consulship of her sons Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius and Anicius Probinus. Cullhed concludes: \\"The evidence for discrediting Isidore's attribution [of Faltonia Betitia Proba as the author of the cento] is not sufficient, and so, I will assume that the cento was written in the mid-fourth century by Faltonia Betitia Proba.\\"Cullhed (2015), pp. 2223. Today, the general consensus among classicists and scholars of Latin is that De laudibus Christi was indeed written by Faltonia Betitia Proba.Plant (2004), p. 170.Cullhed (2015), p. 65.

As a scholar, he was considered an authority on English music of the 16th through 18th centuries. One of his major contributions was his research on composer Thomas Morley which led to the modern publication of Morley's The First Book of Consort Lessons in 1959. Beck led his own ensemble, The Consort Players, in performances of Morley's music and other works by Morley's contemporaries; performances which contributed to the interest in reviving broken consort music in the 20th century. Life and career Sydney Beck is from Poughkeepsie. Born in New York City, Beck was a graduate of Morris High School in the Bronx and the City University of New York. He was a leading figure in the early music revival movement in New York City from the 1930s to the 1950s. He was an expert in historically informed performance on the viol, and published numerous journal articles related to that topic. He performed in several early music ensembles as a gambist in the 1940s and 1950s. Beck was the long-time head of the Music Division of the Rare Book and Manuscripts Collections at the New York Public Library (NYPL). Funds provided by the Works Progress Administration during the 1930s enabled him to transcribe and to publish for the NYPL a large number of rare works from the Division's collection, including early American symphonies, chamber music, concertos, popular songs, hymns, and other sacred works that had never before been published. From 1968‚Äì1976 he was Director of Libraries and a faculty member of the strings program at the New England Conservatory. White House performance In 1963, at the invitation of First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, his early music ensemble, The Consort Players, performed the musical entertainment under his direction for a State dinner at the White House in honor of Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. Among the musicians performing was tenor Robert White. In attendance were President John F. Kennedy, the First Lady, and Eunice Kennedy Shriver among other dignitaries. Death Beck died in Brattleboro, Vermont in 2001 at the age of 94.WU Libraries Necrology . Gives MLA Notes, v. 58 no. 1, September 2001 as reference. He was married to harpsichordist Blanche Winogron. One of his violin and viola pupils was violist Samuel Rhodes of the Juilliard String Quartet. Rhodes named Beck as one of the two most influential people in his formative years as a young musician.

Yurii Solomati was registered as the leader of the organization. The main stronghold of the party has been Luhansk. Initially many party members were also affiliated to the Communist Party of Ukraine (KPU), although the KPU soon began purge dissident elements. Whilst the influence of the Union of Communists waned, it acted as a competitor of KPU in south-eastern Ukraine at an early stage. At the 23rd congress of the Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union held in March 1993, the Union of Communists was included as an associative member. Considering itself as the legitimate heir of the CPSU, the Union of Communists demanded return of CPSU property seized by the Ukrainian state. The organization called for the reconstruction of the Soviet Union. The Union of Communists began publishing the theoretical journal Marksizm i sovremennost' (–ú–∞—Ä–∫—Å–∏–∑–º –∏ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å, 'Marxism and Modernity') from Kiev in 1995. Politically it was close to the Russian Communist Workers Party, with many people (including Yabrova) holding dual memberships. As of the early 2000s, the party was led by Tamil' Yabrova. In 2013 the party took part in the founding of the Initiative of Communist and Workers' Parties.http://www.initiative-cwpe.org/en/home/ In May 2015 laws that ban communist symbols came into effect in Ukraine.

Cincinnati West is located east of Harrison's central business district and about northwest of Downtown Cincinnati. It can be accessed from Interstate 74. The airport is owned by Cincinnati State Technical and Community College. Its fixed-base operator is Whitewater Aviation. History Cincinnati West Airport began in 1939 when Orville and Alvin Jackson plowed an airstrip through a hayfield owned by Woiden Radcliffe. It officially opened in 1947 as Harrison Airport. Runway lights were installed in 1954. A 1969 proposal called for the privately owned Harrison Airport to be expanded for use as Cincinnati's executive airport, after plans to expand Blue Ash Airport into a reliever for Greater Cincinnati Airport were blocked by local opposition. However, Harrison Airport's proximity to William Henry Harrison High School and Harrison Junior High School complicated any expansion plans. Instead, the runway was reconfigured to avoid the schools. Morton Rabkin purchased Harrison Airport in 1981. An adjacent property was developed as a residential subdivision, ending his plans to extend the runway to . In 1986, he renamed the airport to Cincinnati West Airport and sold it to Bob McKenna. In 1995, the city of Harrison annexed Cincinnati West Airport. That August, Cincinnati State Technical and Community College purchased the airport from McKenna Air Inc. to support its federally approved, two-year aviation maintenance technologies program. It spent $4.14 million in state funds to purchase and renovate the facilities. In 1998, the school opened a Cincinnati State West satellite campus next door. Facilities and aircraft Cincinnati West Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one asphalt-paved runway: 01/19 is . The airport operates an Automated Weather Observation System. For the 12-month period ending August 1, 2014, the airport had 30,197 aircraft operations, an average of about 581 per week: 86% general aviation, 14% air taxi, and fewer than 1% military. In that time, there were 36 aircraft based at this airport: 32 single-engine and four multi-engine. The airport is attended daily, year- round. Accidents On August 8, 1981, a fire destroyed a hangar and four planes and seriously damaged two others. On October 10, 2004, a Cessna 172 and a Cessna 152 practicing landings at the airport collided midair and landed in a gravel pit across the street, injuring two.

He is famous for his book 'Trading Systems a new approach to portfolio optimization'. He has been publishing since 1997 the daily newsletter Rendimento Borsa on www.emiliotomasini.it which provides technical and fundamental analysis of the financial markets. He is a financial advisor as far as quantitative trading is concerned for many major European banks and money management firms.,  Early life  Emilio Tomasini in 1995 started his career as a financial journalist in Rome for MF Milano Finanza, the leading Italian weekly financial magazine. After realising that fundamental and news analysis alone are not much useful in predicting future prices he quickly turned to quantitative finance developing the first commercial trading systems in Europe. In 1997 he started his newsletter \\"Rendimento Borsa\\" that today is one of the major Italian player in financial alternative press in Italy. Emilio Tomasini served as an Adjunct Professor of Economics of the European Integration at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, from 2003 up to 2007 and since 2008 he is Adjunct Professor of Corporate Finance at the University of Bologna, Italy, the most ancient university in the world.  An international vision of trading  Emilio Tomasini is a firm believer of a broader European perspective for traders so that his trading tips and trading systems are often applied on European stocks or forgotten US futures. Emilio Tomasini is Chief Editor of the Italian edition of TRADERS' MAGAZINE www.traders-mag.it, the leading technical analysis and investment monthly publication in Europe with also a German, British, Spanish and Greek edition. Every year since 1999 Emilio Tomasini organizes a European trading contest with real money TRADERS' CUP www.traders- cup.it, an event that gathers together the best European traders during a 3 months competition where both seasoned professional traders and newbies are looking for career opportunities in this launching pad for a serious start in the financial industry.  A hallmark book in trading systems history  There are many ways to build a portfolio of different trading systems and different prices series. Emilio Tomasini started from the premise that traditional Markowitz theory, even if formally genial, has no predictive power since correlations among different prices series are varying from decade to decade. For example, correlation among energy products and industrial and transportation price series is not any longer the same today than in the seventies. It is why in \\"Trading systems: a new approach to systems development and portfolio optimization\\" . Emilio Tomasini presents for the first time ever some easy to understand and layman tools to change the cards on the table of portfolio analysis. The book has a very high evaluation on Amazon.

Education & Career  Ye was born in Shanghai, China, shortly after the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. His father was a naval officer and his mother an environmental scientist. He was primarily raised by his grandmother. Ye graduated with a bachelor's degree in physics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 1989. He then moved to the United States to commence graduate studies, completing a master's degree at the University of New Mexico under Marlan Scully in theoretical quantum optics in 1991. He also gained experience in experimental physics under John McInerney working on semiconductor lasers, and spent a summer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Ye then went to the University of Colorado Boulder to begin a Ph.D. in physics. He was accepted as the last graduate student of eventual Nobel Prize laureate John L. Hall. His thesis was on high-resolution and high-sensitivity molecular spectroscopy, which he completed in 1997. He then moved to California Institute of Technology as a Milikan Postdoctoral Fellow, working under Jeff Kimble. Ye moved back to Boulder and JILA as a JILA Associate Fellow and NIST physicist in 1999. John Hall donated most of his lab space to him. He was promoted to full Fellow in 2001 and has been there since, establishing a research program in AMO physics and precision measurement.  Research  Ye's research focuses on ultracold atoms, ultracold molecules, and laser-based precision measurement. His group has built record breaking very precise experimental optical atomic clocks. In 2017 Ye's JILA group reported an experimental 3D quantum gas strontium optical lattice clock in which strontium-87 atoms are packed into a tiny three-dimensional (3-D) cube at 1,000 times the density of previous one-dimensional (1-D) clocks, like the 2015 JILA clock. A synchronous clock comparison between two regions of the 3D lattice yielded a record level of synchronization of in 1 hour of averaging time. The 3D quantum gas strontium optical lattice clock uses an unusual state of matter called a degenerate Fermi gas (a quantum gas for Fermi particles). The experimental data showed the 3D quantum gas clock achieved a precision of in about two hours. In 2018 JILA reported that the 3D quantum gas clock reached a frequency precision of over 6 hours. Such clocks could potentially be used for research into variations in the Earth's gravitational field, searching for particles of dark matter, performing quantum simulations of many-body physics, and investigating the fundamental nature of light and matter. He also conducts research on strontium for experiments in quantum information science (collaborating with Mikhail Lukin, Ana Maria Rey, Peter Zoller, and others). Ye's other research focuses include ultrastable lasers (which are essential for the mechanics of his atomic clock), frequency combs, and molecular spectroscopy. In 2012, his group successfully constructed the world's stablest laser. He pioneered the development of direct frequency comb spectroscopy, and also collaborates with Eric Cornell on an experiment aiming to measure the electric dipole moment of the electron using trapped ions. Honors and awards Ye has received numerous awards in the field of science, particularly AMO physics. He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society and a Fellow of the Optical Society of America. He won the Adolph Lomb Medal of OSA in 1999 and the Arthur S. Flemming Award for outstanding federal employees in 2005, the Friedrich Wilhem Bessel Research Award from Germany and the William F. Meggers Award of the Optical Society of America in 2006, and the Carl Zeiss Research Award and the I.I. Rabi Prize in AMO Physics from the APS in 2007. He has won three Gold Medals from the US Department of Commerce: for frequency combs (2001), ultracold molecules (2011), and atomic clocks (2014). He won the Samuel Wesley Stratton Award in 2006 and Jacob Rabinow applied research award in 2017 from NIST. In 2011 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and also named a Frew Fellow from the Australian Academy of Science. In 2015, President Obama selected Jun Ye to receive a Presidential Rank Award for ‚Äúsustained extraordinary accomplishment‚Äù, citing his work advancing \\"the frontier of light-matter interaction and focusing on precision measurement, quantum physics and ultracold matter, optical frequency metrology, and ultrafast science.\\" In 2017, Ye was elected as a foreign member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Jun Ye was the recipient of the 2019 Norman F. Ramsey Prize in Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics, and in Precision Tests of Fundamental Laws and Symmetries for his ground-breaking contributions to precision measurements and the quantum control of atomic and molecular systems, including atomic clocks. He is one of the most highly cited researchers in experimental atomic physics in the world, having a h-index of 108 and being regularly named as a Thomson-Reuters (ISI) Highly Cited Researcher.

It was a uniformed law enforcement agency responsible for enforcing road transport law in New Zealand. It was separate from the New Zealand Police. From the late 1920s until 1992, traffic law enforcement in New Zealand was not normally carried out by the New Zealand Police. Instead, it was carried out by a combination of a central government agency and various territorial local bodies, each appointing their own traffic officers. Government traffic officers had jurisdiction on all roads but in practice tended to patrol only areas not covered by local body traffic officers. Over a period of decades, central government gradually took over the national enforcement of traffic laws by amalgamating local body traffic departments into one organisation under the Ministry of Transport. The Traffic Safety Service was the final culmination of this process. By the early 1990s it became the sole national traffic law enforcement agency, still separate from the New Zealand Police. In 1992 the Traffic Safety Service was itself absorbed into the New Zealand Police, which now has responsibility for road traffic enforcement across New Zealand.  Traffic Officers in New Zealand  A 'Traffic Officer' in New Zealand was a type of law enforcement officer having circumscribed powers under road traffic-related legislation, mainly the Transport Act 1962 (repealed in 2011) and its subsidiary Traffic Regulations to stop, detain and in certain cases arrest individuals. These powers of arrest were initially limited to offences involving driving and alcohol but over time extended to cover related offences such as assault or failing to stop when signalled. Traffic officers did not take an oath and consequently did not have the broad powers of arrest of a Police Constable in New Zealand. Traffic officers employed by the Traffic Safety Service were officially appointed by a warrant issued by the Minister of Transport, which gave them jurisdiction on any road in New Zealand. The traffic officers employed by local bodies were appointed under the legislation that granted the local body its statutory powers and so did not have national jurisdiction.  History of Traffic Officers in New Zealand  The first traffic officer was employed by the Auckland City Traffic Department in 1894 to police horse-drawn traffic. In the early part of the twentieth century, a Main Highways Board was established, which was responsible for all aspects of roading in New Zealand. The Board directly employed a few full-time 'Traffic Inspectors' enforcing road rules, as well as subsidizing local authorities that appointed Traffic Inspectors in the respective regions.https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/imageserver- parliamentary/AJHR1932-I-II.1.1857.pdf In 1929 the government, seeking to better coordinate national transport activities, established the Transport Department. The Department took over motor vehicle registration and former 'traffic inspectors' became 'traffic officers', tasked with enforcement of traffic laws on national roads.  Local body traffic enforcement in New Zealand  In a few urban areas, traffic policing remained the responsibility of local bodies for many years. The principal local body uniformed traffic departments (as opposed to local body parking wardens, which were more common) were in Lower Hutt City; Napier City; Auckland City; Tamaki City; and Ellerslie and Mount Albert boroughs in greater Auckland. Auckland International Airport Authority and the Auckland Harbour Bridge Authority also employed their own traffic officers. The latter was disestablished in 1983 and its 'Bridge Control Officers' continued to work under the supervision of the Ministry of Transport, dedicated to ensuring free flow of traffic over the Bridge. In 1989, with local body amalgamation across New Zealand, the former Tamaki City and Ellerslie and Mount Albert boroughs were subsumed into an enlarged Auckland City and their traffic officers, along with those of Auckland City all became employees of the Ministry of Transport. All Traffic Officers, whether employed by the Ministry of Transport or by local authority, were eligible for the award of a Traffic Service Medal after 14 years of service.  Ministry of Transport (1968‚Äì1992)  1990‚Äì1991 Mitsubishi V3000 Executive sedan The Transport Department became the Ministry of Transport in 1968. Road traffic enforcement was overseen by the 'Road Transport Division' of the Ministry. In 1988, this division was renamed the 'Land Transport Division' and included the newly-named 'Traffic Safety Service' ('TSS'). There followed a period during which remaining local body traffic enforcement was taken over by the Traffic Safety Service. By the early 1990s the TSS had completed this consolidation, so that all road traffic enforcement in New Zealand was primarily carried out by the traffic officers of the TSS. During this time New Zealand Police constables legally had almost all the same powers as traffic officers and in certain circumstances enforced traffic laws, particularly but not exclusively in remote rural locations.  Merger with New Zealand Police (1992)  On 1 July 1992 the Traffic Safety Service was merged into the New Zealand Police and from that time road traffic enforcement in New Zealand became the total responsibility of the Police. Traffic Officers were gradually trained for other policing duties, with the majority eventually becoming sworn police officers and going on to serve in a variety of roles. A few elected to remain as non-sworn traffic officers but still employed by the Police.

History  La Colonia de Eden Gardens is one of the oldest residential areas of Solana Beach, founded in the 1920s by Mexican farmers who were hired by the owners of large ranches in adjacent Rancho Santa Fe. The farmers wanted their families living nearby, hence the name La Colonia (the colony). The original homes built by the first settlers were single-level adobe buildings. They were later demolished and replaced by two-story apartment complexes. This brought more residents and expanded the density of the neighborhood. The name Eden Gardens was thought up in the 1970s by eager land developers, looking to attract residents to the area. But it's thought to originated as early as the 1950s. In the late 1980s, drug and alcohol problems in the area had reached troublesome levels. Undocumented immigrants were exploited by the drug dealers who got them to sell drugs on the street, since they made for reluctant witnesses, were they to be questioned by police. At the two ends of the main drag through La Colonia sentries would be posted, who would send warnings should the police show up. Local residents spoke up about these issues to the City Council, with the council responding by voting in new ordinances, banning the public consumption of alcohol and increasing the police presence. In 1988 Eddie Lewis created the \\"Eden Gardens Against Drugs\\" organization in an effort to improve the area's troubled reputation. In 1991, a new community center was built in La Colonia park and the children‚Äôs playground was renovated. In 1996, the San Diego County Sheriff‚Äôs department opened an office in the La Colonia Park Community Center. Through these efforts, crime in the area began to diminish substantially.  Community outreach  In 2010, Manny Aguilar, Mary Ann Aguilar, Victor Tostado, Maria Dybbro, Tracy Weiss, Diane Hardison, Pat Caughey and other concerned community members founded La Colonia de Eden Gardens Foundation to help reduce increasing drug and gang violence, and to support local youth by helping them to make positive choices and to provide greater resources for residents. In 2014, the La Colonia de Eden Gardens Foundation, the National Latino Research Center and Cal State San Marcos met with 70 community members, having them complete a 94-question survey. The results of the survey were analyzed to document community needs and concerns, the cultural and social identity of the community and to find ways to improve the community.  La Colonia Park  In 1974, a report by the San Diego Human Relations Commission criticized the county for neglecting the recreational needs of La Colonia de Eden Gardens, and the result was the creation of La Colonia Park in the late 1970s. The oldest building in Solana Beach, the \\"Stevens House\\" is located within the park. Once a private property, it now houses the Solana Heritage Museum.  Local businesses  Popular in La Colonia are three Mexican restaurants. Don Chuy‚Äôs restaurant was originally called La Tiendita and was opened in 1932 by the Granados family. It was run by members of the Granados family until 2014 when it went out of business. Tony‚Äôs Jacal Restaurant was opened in 1946 by the Gonzalez family. Currently, three generations of the Gonzalez family work in the restaurant. Fidel‚Äôs Little Mexico Restaurant started by Fidel Montanez selling tacos in his barber shop in the 1960s. The tacos were a hit and the barber shop replaced and transformed into a large and successful restaurant. Also found in La Colonia de Eden Gardens is Baker Iron Works. The owner Charlie Baker runs the establishment and creates an assortment of ornamental wrought iron works for customers.  Notable people  * Lil Rob, Rapper.

On a six-lap course which climbed Manayunk Wall, an long climb with an average gradient of 8 percent, at the end of each lap, Jasmin Glaesser () established an early breakaway, leading for two laps before being caught by the peloton. Her breakaway earned her sufficient \\"Queen of the Mountain\\" points for her to win that title. Further attacks were made, but none were successful. On the final ascent of Manayunk Wall, Lizzie Armitstead () won in a sprint, beating Elisa Longo Borghini () and Alena Amialiusik (). Entry The organisers of the Philadelphia Cycling Classic indicated that they would invite the top twenty ranked UCI teams at the end of 2014, and then any further allocations would be assigned to highly ranked national teams and other UCI teams. A list of seventeen participating teams was published in March, just over 10 weeks prior to the race.

The course also included climbs up Lemon Hill and Strawberry Mansion Drive. Each of the six laps is , giving a total race length of . \\"Queen of the Mountain\\" points were awarded for the first rider to the top of Manayunk Wall and Lemon Hill each lap, while an intermediate sprint was located roughly halfway along the outward section of the lap, where Kelly Drive intersects with Midvale Avenue. Preview Circuit of the Philadelphia Cycling Classic 2015 After five rounds of the 2015 UCI Women's Road World Cup, there had been five different winners; Jolien D'Hoore at the Ronde van Drenthe, Lizzie Armitstead at the Trofeo Alfredo Binda-Comune di Cittiglio, Elisa Longo Borghini at the Tour of Flanders, Anna van der Breggen at the La Fl√®che Wallonne F√©minine, and Giorgia Bronzini at the Tour of Chongming Island. Anna van der Breggen led the World Cup standings as the racing moved to Philadelphia, with 290 points, but her Rabo-Liv team had opted not to take part in the event. Annemiek van Vleuten and Jolien D'Hoore, who were second and third in the standings, had not travelled with their teams to the event. Elisa Longo Borghini () and Lizzie Armitstead (), who entered the race placed fourth and fifth, were highlighted as possible favourites for the race, though Armitstead's teammate, Evelyn Stevens had won the race in both 2013 and 2014. Race Lizzie Armitstead won the race in a sprint finish up Manayunk Wall. There was no significant breakaways during the first lap, but as the riders climbed Lemon Hill on the second of six laps, Jasmin Glaesser () established a gap, and maintained the lead of the race for two laps, earning her the Queen of the Mountain award. She was caught during an attack by Alison Jackson (), but the pair could not maintain their advantage, and were caught by the peloton on the climb up Manayunk Wall at the end of the third lap. Team Hitec Products attacked each of the intermediate sprints, with Kirsten Wild providing a lead-out each lap for her teammate Emilie Moberg. They also attempted to make breakaways of their own, and Moberg managed to lead off the front of the peloton for around half a lap before being caught once more by the peloton. The Velocio-SRAM team attacked through the fourth lap, with each of their riders riding off the front in turn, but they failed to establish a breakaway. Entering the final lap, the peloton remained close, although a number of riders had fallen behind or dropped out, particularly through the cobbled bends at the base of the Manayunk Wall. A series of attacks were made on the final lap; Charlotte Becker () gained an advantage, but it was closed again due to work from the Boels-Dolmans team. Once Becker had been caught, Dalia Muccioli () made a move, but the Twenty16 p/b Sho-Air team worked to eliminate her lead. A sprint to the bottom of the Manayunk Wall was led by Loren Rowney (), but more riders struggled over the cobblestones and dropped back. Alexis Ryan () took over the lead of the peloton at the bottom of the hill, and established a fast pace up the lower slopes, leading Jo√´lle Numainville () and her teammate Coryn Rivera. Optum-KBS also had a number of riders near the front, while Elisa Longo Borghini () and Lizzie Armitstead () were just behind. Longo Borghini attacked first, but Armitstead went with her and passed her just before the line to claim victory.

(Orchidaceae). Rheedea 16. (1): 49-54.  Flowering and Fruiting  August to February with a peak during September to December.  Altitude  Primarily at 60-80m but have been found as high up as 700m.  Differences with other Vanda species in the region  The flowers are similar to Vanda tessellata in form, differing only in the shape of the sidelobes and fragrance. The sidelobes of Vanda tessellata are sharp while those of Vanda wightii are blunt. Also Vanda tessellata is fragrant during the day while Vanda wightii is fragrant at dusk. The plant habit of Vanda wightii is not as robust and hardy as Vanda tessellata. The leaves of Vanda wightii are closely placed, narrow and arching compared to Vanda tessellata. Recent phylogenetic studies have shown Vanda wightii to be closely related to Vanda tessellata than to Vanda thwaitesii. Vanda thwaitesii in contrast has been grouped together with the Trudelias. Vanda wightii shares a similar colouration to that of Vanda thwaitesii though the floral structure is entirely different.Gardiner, L. M., Kocyan, A., Motes, M., Roberts, D. L. and Emerson, B. C.

It was developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and is defined as Part 12 within the MPEG-H media suite (ISO/IEC 23008-12). Apple has said that an HEIF image using HEVC requires only about half the storage space as the equivalent quality JPEG. HEIF also supports animation, and is capable of storing more information than an animated GIF or APNG at a small fraction of the size. Introduced in 2015, HEIF was adopted by Apple in 2017 with the introduction of iOS 11, and support on other platforms is growing. HEIF files are a special case of the ISO Base Media File Format (ISOBMFF, ISO/IEC 14496-12), first defined in 2001 as a shared part of MP4 and JPEG 2000. This file format standard covers multimedia files that can also include other media streams, such as timed text, audio and video.  History  The requirements and main use cases of HEIF were defined in 2013. The technical development of the specification took about one and a half years and was finalized in the middle of 2015. Apple was the first major adopter of the format in 2017 with the introduction of iOS 11 using HEIC variant. On some systems, pictures stored in the HEIC format are converted automatically to the older JPEG format when they are sent outside of the system.  Features  HEIF files can store the following types of data: ; Image items: Storage of individual images, image properties and thumbnail(s). ; Image derivations: Derived images enable non-destructive image editing, and are created on the fly by the rendering software using editing instructions stored separately in the HEIF file. These instructions (rectangular cropping, rotation by one, two or three quarter-turns, timed graphic overlays, etc.) and images are stored separately in the HEIF file, and describe specific transformations to be applied to the input images. The storage overhead of derived images is small. ; Image sequences:Storage of multiple time-related and/or temporally predicted images (like a burst-photo shot or cinemagraph animation), their properties and thumbnails. Different prediction options can be used in order to exploit the temporal and spatial similarities between the images. Hence, file sizes can be drastically reduced when many images are stored in the same HEIF file. ; Auxiliary image items: Storage of image data, such as an alpha plane or a depth map, which complements another image item. These data are not displayed as such, but used in various forms to complement another image item. ; Image metadata: Storage of EXIF, XMP and similar metadata which accompany the images stored in the HEIF file.  Variants  As HEIF is a container format, it can contain still images and image sequences that are coded in different formats. The main filename extensions are .heif for still images and .heifs for sequences, which can both be used with any codec. Apple supports playback of .heif for still image files and .heifs for image sequence files created on other devices that are encoded using any codec, provided that codec is supported by the operating system. Generic HEIF image files are typically stored with filename extensions .heif, but they may use a different extension to indicate the specific codec used.  MIAF  The Multi-Image Application Format (MIAF) is a restricted subset of HEIF specified as part of MPEG-A. It defines a set of additional constraints to simplify format options, specific alpha plane formats, profiles and levels as well as metadata formats and brands, and rules for how to extend the format.  HEIC: HEVC in HEIF  High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC, ITU-T H.265) is an encoding format for graphic data, first standardized in 2013. It is the primarily used and implied default codec for HEIF as specified in the normative Annex B to ISO/IEC 23008-12 HEVC Image File Format. While not introduced formally in the standard, the acronym HEIC (High-Efficiency Image Container) is used as a brand and in the MIME subtypes \`image/heic\` and \`image/heic-sequence\`. If the content conforms to certain HEVC profiles, more specific brands can be used: HEIX for Main 10 of HEVC, HEIM for (Multiview) Main profile and HEIS for (Scalable) Main (10) profile of L-HEVC. The variation of HEIF used in Apple products exclusively uses HEVC compression technology and is known as HEIC. A HEIC photo takes up about half the space of an equivalent quality JPEG file, and meets many next-generation photographic needs. The initial HEIF specification already defined the means of storing HEVC-encoded intra images (i-frames) and HEVC-encoded image sequences in which inter prediction is applied in a constrained manner. HEVC image players are required to support rectangular cropping and rotation by one, two and three quarter-turns. The primary use case for the mandatory support for rotation by 90 degrees is for images where the camera orientation is incorrectly detected or inferred. The rotation requirement makes it possible to manually adjust the orientation of a still image or an image sequence without needing to re-encode it. Cropping enables the image to be re-framed without re-encoding. The HEVC file format also includes the option to store pre-derived images.) Samples in image sequence tracks must be either intra-coded images or inter-picture predicted images with reference to only intra-coded images. These constraints of inter- picture prediction reduce the decoding latency for accessing any particular image within an HEVC image sequence track. The .heic and .heics file name extensions are conventionally used for HEVC-coded HEIF files. Apple products, for instance, will only produce files with these extensions, which indicate clearly that the data went through HEVC encoding.  AVCI: AVC in HEIF  Advanced Video Coding (AVC, ITU-T H.264) is an older encoding format for video and images, first standardized in 2003. It is also specified as a codec to be supported in HEIF in normative Annex 5 to ISO/IEC 23008-12. The registered MIME types are \`image/avci\` for still images and \`image/avcs\` for sequences. The format is simply known as AVCI. Apple products support playback of AVC- encoded .avci still image files and .avcs image sequence files, but will only generate .heic(s) files.  AVIF: AV1 in HEIF  AV1 is a video encoding format that is intended to be royalty free developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia). AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) is an image format based on this codec. The registered MIME types are \`image/avif\` for still images which usually carry an .avif file name extension and \`image/avif-sequence\` for sequences which use .avifs file name extension. This may be confusable with the classic AVI Windows multimedia format which typically uses .avi.  JPEG and HEIF  JPEG is the most commonly used and best supported lossy image format, first released in 1992 by ITU-T and ISO/IEC. Although Annex H to ISO/IEC 23008-12 specifies JPEG (and indirectly Motion JPEG) as a possible format for HEIF image data, it is only ever used for thumbnails and other secondary images. Therefore neither a dedicated MIME subtype nor a special file extension is available. JPEG 2000 also uses ISOBMFF, but in a way incompatible with HEIF, while JPEG XR uses a TIFF-based container format. Neither of them is currently formally specified as an image codec for use within HEIF. In 2017, Apple announced that it would adopt HEIC as the default image format in its new operating systems, gradually replacing JPEG. Both AVIF and HEIF are currently being considered as possible replacements for the universal JPEG format because, among other technical contributions, both can reduce file size by about 50% while maintaining equivalent quality. As of May 2020, there is no native browser support for HEIF, while both Google's Chromiumhttps://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=960620 and Mozilla's Firefoxhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1625363 have experimental AVIF support.

Because the website was unable to process HEIF images, students whose phones defaulted to this image format were considered to have not submitted any response and often failed to complete the exam. College Board, which administers the exams, later provided a system for users to submit photos of answers via e-mail. Because the iOS Mail app automatically converts HEIF images to JPEG, this mitigated the problem.  Patent licensing  HEIF itself is a container that may not be subject to additional royalty fees for commercial ISOBMFF licensees. Note however that Nokia also grants its patents on a royalty-free basis for non- commercial purposes.) When containing images and image sequences encoded in a particular format (e.g. HEVC or AVC) its use becomes subject to the licensing of patents on the coding format.

It stars Ramsey Nouah, Osas Ighodaro, Blossom Chukwujekwu, Kiki Omeili, Alexx Ekubo, Gideon Okeke, Gbenro Ajibade, Ikechukwu Onunaku and Shafy Bello. The film is a spin-off of Married to the Game, a television series, also directed by Walter Taylaur for EbonyLife TV. The film is centred on the kidnapping of record label boss, Austin Mba (Ramsey Nouah) and a socialite he meets at the club, Cassandra (Osas Ighodaro). The situation gets complicated for the amateur kidnappers led by Francis (Gideon Okeke), who has to deal with keeping his girlfriend, Blessing (Kiki Omeili) and his crazy sidekick, Filo (Gbenro Ajibade), as they try to get Austin's partner, Rotimi (Blossom Chukwujekwu) to pay the ransom. Plot Austin Mba (Ramsey Nouah), is the C.E.O of Rolling Records, a label that's on the verge of signing a major sponsorship deal, brokered by his partner and company lawyer, Rotimi Lawal (Blossom Chukwujekwu). A trio of inexperienced hustlers which consist of Francis (Gideon Okeke), the leader of the gang, Filo (Gbenro Ajibade) and Blessing (Kiki Omeili), intercept an e-mail about the Rolling Records sponsorship deal, which is supposedly worth ‚Ç¶50 million; they then decide to kidnap one of the label owners for a ransom of the ‚Ç¶50 million. Austin, in a celebratory mood of the incoming deal, goes to party at the club where he meets a socialite, Cassandra (Osas Ighodaro) and they hook up. Francis' gang strike this night and they kidnap Austin, along with Cassandra who is in his car, as he is about to go get a condom). Waking up at an uncompleted building in the morning, after being knocked out last night, Austin claims Cassandra as his girlfriend to the gang, so as to avoid the group from killing her. The gang call Rotimi, the partner, who tries to explain to the gang that the money is not yet in the company's hands, and that Austin's signature is in fact needed for the contract before the fund can be released; this explanation fell on deaf ears. Rotimi suspects Nino (Ikechukwu Onunaku), the flagship artist of the label, who also is very keen on the money, has a hand in the kidnap. Rotimi threatens Nino about getting the police involved, but Nino threatens to turn the story around to the police and claim that Rotimi connived with him to kidnap Austin. Cassandra asks to use the toilet and Filo escorts her; in the absence of a guard, Austin breaks loose and heads to the toilet, where he hits Filo who's about to rape Cassandra at gun point. Austin and Cassandra both escape, but Cassandra is captured again after she tries to recover her expensive shoe that she left behind. Austin, as a result, surrenders himself to the gang and he is beaten to a pulp. To save Austin from further torture, Cassandra begs and implores the gang to call her step-mum, Alexis Osita-Park (Shaffy Bello), for the ransom instead. Alex Osita-Park is a very wealthy woman worth US$2.8billion which she inherited from Cassandra's late father. The gang calls Osita-park and asks for the same 50 million. Osita-Park bargains to pay 30 million, but the group refuses. Cassandra, on the phone, begs her step mum to please give the money to the group; in the midst of the discussion, everyone realizes the 30 million Osita-Park is willing to pay is in dollars and not in Naira. The gang immediately agree to the offer and decide to arrange a meeting on the collection of the money. Blessing is pregnant, but she keeps it away from her boyfriend, Francis, because she's been having an affair with Filo. Francis eventually finds out about Blessing's pregnancy and tries to force the truth out of her mouth about who is responsible, thinking she is still into prostitution business. Blessing refuses to confess, claiming it would escalate an already tense relationship. Francis then realizes it must be someone he knows and further insists to know the truth. Blessing eventually tells him, but not after she has revealed that she's also aware of Gideon's secret of infertility; she explains that she stayed with him all the while for the true love she has for him. Blessing rushes to Filo and urges him to run away, in order to avoid a physical battle with Francis. Filo, who has already connived with some other street guys to boycott the gang and take the ransom, arrives fully armed, along with the street guys, and they order Francis to bring out the money. Gideon however explains to them that the payment is electronically; a man from Filo's gang then orders Francis to call Alexis Osita-Park to initiate a change of plans, but Francis refuses to hand over his phone, and Blessing is accidentally killed by Filo. Francis, in retaliation also kills Filo; a gun battle ensues, and everyone else is killed in the process. Five days later, Alexis Osita-Park tries to pay off Austin Mba on his hospital bed with ‚Ç¶2 million naira, but he refuses. Cassandra enters the room to say her \\"final goodbye\\", and tells Austin that her mum insists she travels for several months and that she does not know where that leaves them. Austin also reveals he in fact also intends to travel. Austin is seen by a taxi; he receives a credit alert on his phone about a $30 million transaction; he instructs the driver to head to Murtala Muhammed Airport. The film flashes back; apparently, Austin has been the masterplanner of the entire incident from the beginning, and the ransom has been paid to the account he controls. In the closing credits, Alexis Osita- Park has captured Rotimi Lawal and Nino, demanding from them her $30 million.

Life Honor√© Jozef Coppieters was born at Overmere in East Flanders, the eldest son of Benedictus Coppieters and Maria Sidonia Verstraeten. His father was a farmer. He studied successively at St. Vincent's Catholic college in Eeklo, St. Joseph Minor Seminary in Sint-Niklaas and at the Episcopal Seminary in Ghent. He was ordained into the priesthood on 19 December 1896.\\"Coppieters, Very Reverend Canon Honor√© Jozef\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, New York, the Encyclopedia Press, 1917, p. 34 After that he attended the Catholic University of Leuven, emerging in 1902 with a doctorate and a Master of Theology qualification. From 1900 till 1920 Coppieters taught Biblical Exegesis and Hebrew at Leuven's Faculty of Theology where he also involved himself in student activism, becoming provost/moderator of the Amicitia radical catholic student fraternity established at Leuven in 1911. On 29 December 1919 he was appointed dean of Lokeren. On 8 August 1924 he transferred as dean of Aalst. Episcopate He was appointed coadjutor bishop to Emilius Seghers, the Bishop of Ghent, on 27 January 1927, becoming at the same time the Titular bishop of Helenopolis in Bithnia. Seghers died a few months later, and on the same day, 17 May 1927 Coppieters formally took over the Diocese of Ghent. He had been consecrated as bishop two days earlier by Cardinal van Roey. He took as his episcopal motto \\"Fide et Caritate\\" (\\"By faith and charity\\"). In 1935, ahead of the Brussels International Exposition, he purchased an organ constructed by \\"Johannes Klais Orgelbau\\" of Bonn in order to complement the organ already in the cathedral.  Ghent Altarpiece  It was also at this time that two panels were stolen from the cathedral's famous van Eyck Altarpiece. Coppieters received a ransom note, addressed to him personally on 30 April 1934, apparently sent by the thieves, in which they demanded a million Belgian francs for the safe return of the two stolen panels. Coppieters was prevented by the Belgian prosecuting authorities from paying the ransom on behalf of the church and the civil authorities took over negotiations with the art thieves, insisting that the stolen items were not merely church property but national treasures. Coppieters himself subsequently offered 25,000 Belgian francs for the safe return of the panels which some interpreted as evidencing a lack of commitment to the stolen artwork. In any event, only one of the panels had been returned by 2015, although a copy of the missing one, produced by the restorer Jef Van der Veken, has been substituted in the cathedral. Death Honor√© Jozef Coppieters died on 20 December 1947, aged 73. His body was buried with those of predecessors in the \\"Episcopal gallery\\" in the Burial Ground of St Mary's Church, but on 24 March 1959 he was one of five dead bishops whose physical remains were removed from St.Mary's and placed in the crypt of St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent.

A Full Professor at the University of Bergamo (Italy), in 2004 Casti founded the Diathesis Cartographic Lab, a permanent workshop devoted to territorial analysis, cartographic innovation and experimentation. A noted innovator in the field of theoretical cartography, Casti formalized a semiotic theory of geographic maps  Academic career  Having graduated from the University of Padua with a thesis on the historical evolution of cartography in Mantua, professor Casti started her academic research in 1983, when she was appointed researcher at the same university. Casti became an associate professor at the University of Bergamo in 1992 and full professor in 2001. She also taught courses, lectures and seminars at other academic institution both in Italy (University of Turin) and abroad (EPFL - √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne, Parigi VII - Paris- Diderot). Since the date of its foundation until it was officially terminated in 2012, professor Casti was a member of the Academic Board (Collegio dei Docenti) for the PhD program on ‚ÄúGeografia dello sviluppo e delle dinamiche urbano-regionali‚Äù (Geography of development and of urban-regional dynamics). She has been involved in research groups both at the national level (with active links to the Italian journal Terra d‚ÄôAfrica) and internationally (within the Eidolon network). Casti is also a member of many leading Italian societies (AGeI, SGI, RGI, AIIGI) and international workgroups (UGI, ICA). After starting her career as a specialist on Venetian historical cartography, Casti has widened the scope of her research to embrace various historical periods. She has extensively analyzed the role of maps in the Italian region of Lombardy in the Renaissance and Early Modern times; addressed key issues in Italian and French colonial cartography and investigated prehistoric examples of rock-engraved mapping in Valcamonica (Camonica Valley, Italy). Far from being regarded as mere historical artifacts, these cartographic examples provided a solid background for empirical and applied analysis. On the basis of such maps, professor Casti developed her theory of cartographic semiosis. Casti has also used the same theory to shed more light on the products and the communicative and pragmatic potential of digital mapping, GIS and WebGIS, with a focus on participatory mapping in support of local governance. By pinpointing the complex mechanisms at work in a geographic map, Casti‚Äôs research highlighted the links between cartography and geography and the discrepancies between traditional and digital maps. Africa has long been the privileged object of professor Casti‚Äôs numerous on-site surveys, well over thirty since 1992. In this context, she conducted applied research regarding environmental protection and cooperation with countries in the developing world, working within the framework of EU programs, of the International Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN)and of UNESCO. In particular, Casti participated in projects for the management of the buffer zones of protected areas in West Africa: i.e. the 2002-2005 collaborative project with the French CIRAD research center of Montpellier involving the W Transboundary Biosphere Reserve of Niger, Benin and Burkina Faso; and the 2006-2009 collaboration with the excellence university center 2iE- Institut International d'Ing√©ni√©rie de l'Eau et de l'Environnement di Ouagadougou - Arly Protection and Conservation Unit in Burkina Faso. Prof. Casti currently pursues her line of theoretical and applied research in the field of cartography, while also devoting herself to urban planning and territorial valorization and development. Through the creation of participatory mapping systems between 2012 and 2013, Casti led the participatory process for the application of the Italian city of Bergamo as 2019 European Capital of Culture (Bergamo Open Mapping) and, in the years 2014 to 2015, the participatory process for the revitalization of public spaces in Bergamo (BG Public Space). In 2012, with the aim to kickstart the regeneration of territories via a tourism-based approach, Casti promoted and implemented a European network of cluster cities (comprising Bergamo, Beauvais, Cambridge, Charleroi, Girona, L√ºbeck, Santander); all medium-sized cities, located in urban areas, with a university and an airport served by low-cost airlines (Project entitled: Centrality of Territories, towards the regeneration of Bergamo in a European network).  Main theoretical achievements   The Theory of Cartographic Semiosis  Professor Casti elaborated the theory of cartographic semiosis in 1998, when she also published her first theoretical book L‚Äôordine del mondo e la sua rappresentazione, translated into English in 2005 under the title Reality as Representation. The semiotics of cartography and the generation of meaning. Casti‚Äôs theory lies within the fold of the research area called ‚Äúpostmodern cartography‚Äù inaugurated by John B. Harley in 1989 and developed in the first decade of the 21st century with contributions by Emanuela Casti, Jeremy Crampton, Martin Dodge, Rob Kitchin, John Pickles, Denis Wood. The underlying assumption of postmodern research is a questioning of the objectivity and neutrality of maps, and more specifically a questioning of the scientific nature of Euclidean metrics. Accordingly, maps are not seen as straightforward ‚Äúmirrors of reality‚Äù, but rather as instruments through which reality is shaped. Casti‚Äôs key contribution lies in having embraced this initial assumption as a springboard for articulating a theory able to investigate the construction and the communicative mechanisms of maps. By shifting the focus of interest from maps as tools for mediating territory to maps as operators which actively affect the range of activities one can implement on territories, Casti‚Äôs theory earmarked the areas in which action is needed in order to take control of the communicative outcomes of mapping. Assuming a symbiosis between territory and mapping, Casti conclusively defines maps as complex denonational acts, on the basis of which individuals appropriate territory intellectually and symbolically order the world. Maps should be taken as instances of a ‚Äúmetasemiosis\\" - or ‚Äúsecond-level semiosis‚Äù, for even though they are based on territorial semiosis they also deploy signs, names, symbols which convey messages and meanings quite independently of the intentions of those who first produced them. Professor Casti explores the transition from a topographic mapping, created by government agencies, to open cartography, collaboratively produced by the people (and linked to a new idea of Chorography). The latter has the potential to become a highly workable concept, to be used as an operator for assisting citizens in thinking and designing their own living space and in understanding the current world. Specifically, Casti argues that, by virtue of its highly interactive features, new digital mapping (specifically WebGIS) opens up new scenarios, and poses cybercartography as a privileged discipline for recovering and promoting the social significance of territory in all its forms (landscape and environment).  The SIGAP strategy and participatory mapping  The SIGAP strategy (Geographic Information Systems for Protected Areas /Participatory Action) is a research methodology that adopts cartographic semiosis and tests its actual range of application. It takes up concepts presented by international agencies - such as \\"sustainability\\", \\"conservation\\" participation‚Äù - and turns them into operational tools for territorial and environmental planning. Tested in various national and international contexts with regard to a variety of issues (migration, environmental protection, landscape planning, tourism systems, urban regeneration, etc.), the SIGAP methodology deploys the typical range of geography-based competences in the field of applied research. As such it involves all stages of analysis: the adoption of a theory informing land methodology; interaction with local inhabitants for the reading of data; construction of interpretative models and their cartographic visualization. In each of these stages, cartography takes on different capacities depending on the goal to be pursued. The final product is an interactive multimedia system GIS which becomes as an invaluable tool for field research, for the implementation of intervention strategies, for the processing and circulation of data. Participatory mapping systems play an essential role in this context, because they can recover the role of local communities and produce cartographic representations that take account of local interests. According to the technology involved and the level of participation entailed, these systems may include: i) participatory mapping, carried out by local communities at the request of an external party; ii) Community Integrated GIS - or CIGIS, built and operated by actors outside the community but including data collected through participatory methodologies; iii) Public Participation GIS - PPGIS), made and used directly by local communities in an exchange with local administrators or supervising agencies. The latter, based on WebGIS technology, fall within the realm of \\"cybercartography\\" or ‚Äúopen‚Äù digital mapping systems that allow users to interact, by promoting social projects and processes (Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre).  S-Low Tourism  Casti uses the phrase ‚Äús-Low Tourism‚Äù to underline the absence of a clear conceptual break between the notion of slowness and the notion of speed. In fact, her acronym refers both to \\"slow\\" as a prerequisite for a mindful experience of territory, and to low-cost airlines that have revolutionized the way we think about air travel, as something different from a journey, something based on speed and safety. On the one hand, air travel has increased, is more intense, and usually covers a shorter period of time: it underlies a current lifestyle, whereby tourist destinations are no longer analyzed on the basis of conventional indicators. At the same time, though, the notion of sustainability applied to territorial planning has amply shown that tourism is a driving force for local communities, which conceive and present their own space not only as a holiday destination but as a place to be experienced in its social, cultural and environmental features. In a leap of perspective, tourism ceases to be a mere driving force for economic development and becomes an opportunity for regional regeneration, with a view to producing social development through the recovery of a sense of place, that is to say of the key value of territory. This is a kind of regeneration that focuses on the cultural and natural resources of territories, now made available online to a new type of tourist who is steeped in information technology and accustomed to new modes of travel. This new tourist-traveller looks for a travel experience based on slow appreciation, on ecology- conscious, environmental and green mobility. Yet, at the same time, mobility has to be fast for travellers to be able to experience more theme-based destinations that share comparable cultural features. At the local level, this new tourism is based on the enhancement of small enterprise projects, of smart technology, and of citizen participation. Internationally, it must be based on a synergy between public and private institutions, aimed at promoting common policies to develop tourism and accessibility.  The RIFO method  The method comes from a monitoring study on disused and obsolete areas (buildings erected between 1950 and 1980) in Lombardy. It relies on three assumptions: the symbiosis between land-regeneration and urban restructuring; a shift of focus involving ‚Äúcities‚Äù no longer seen as territorial structures but as sites that embody an ecological lifestyle; the prospect of circular restructuring of disused and discontinued areas, with the active participation of local inhabitants. Operationally, this method aims at replacing outdated buildings (in terms of safety, energy saving, new forms of living, and sanitation) with new buildings that meet current living needs and at the same time reclaim wasted space. In fact, while maintaining the same volume for buildings, the RIFO method also expands the use of underground space and thus envisions a reduction of the surface taken up by covered areas, with the possibility of freeing up land for later use as parks and green areas. RIFO envisages a circular process of demolition and reconstruction for obsolete and disused areas, and so entails the relocation of inhabitants who live in old tenement buildings within the same district. Such short-range relocation aims at inclusive restructuring by implementing participatory strategies in the stages of planning, ensuring an active role for local inhabitants the whole process of demolition and construction. A participatory methodology - the SIGAP Strategy \\\\- retrieves the spatial capital, that is to say the set of knowledge and skills of inhabitants who actively operate the places they inhabit. SIGAP also sheds light on the use of space assets found in public RIFO areas (public services, accessibility, natural heritage); it detects priorities and critical issues (pollution factors, need for green spaces, social distress and safety) and recovers the layered values attributed to the sites.

He graduated from the vocational school in Kimry in 1914. Tikhonov worked as a messenger for a Moscow bookstore and at a Moscow slaughterhouse. From 1916, he was a mechanic at the railroad depot at Petrograd's Finland Station. He became a plumber in the Moscow City food department in June 1918. In October, he was in the Red Army. Tikhonov first participated in the suppression of anti-Soviet forces in the Kirsanovsky Uyezd of Tambov Governorate and then fought on the Southern Front and on the Southeastern Front. He originally was an officer in the 3rd Reserve Cavalry Regiment. On 29 October 1918, he was wounded. Tikhonov joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1919. In October 1919, he graduated from the Moscow Cavalry Courses. Tikhonov became the commander of a cavalry squadron training courses for the 8th Army in October 1919. In April 1920, he became a platoon commander and head of intelligence for the 1st Cavalry Regiment of the 22nd Rifle Division. He was again wounded on 1 November. In December, Tikhonov was the adjutant in a unit of the 9th Kuban Army. In the same year, Tikhonov was awarded a Central Executive Committee of the RSFSR-inscribed gold watch for reported personal bravery.  Interwar  In June 1921, Tikhonov graduated from the repeated courses of cavalry higher command in Kharkiv. He became a squadron commander of the 44th Cavalry Regiment, part of the 3rd Separate Cavalry Brigade and the 57th Rifle Division in August 1921. During that year and 1922, he participated in operations against anti-Soviet groups in Troitsky Uyezd, Chelyabinsk Province. Between April and August 1923, Tikhonov studied at the Volga Military District cavalry commanders courses. After their end, he returned to the 44th Cavalry Regiment, fighting to suppress an uprising in Chechnya and was wounded on 21 February 1925. From April, he was assistant to the commander of the 68th Cavalry Regiment of the North Caucasus Military District. For these actions, he was awarded honorary weapons in 1928. Tikhonov graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in 1930. In May he became the 33rd Cavalry Regiment's chief of staff. He became chief of staff for the 6th Cavalry Division in April 1931. From November, he was in the Red Army first management staff. Tikhonov later became assistant chief and chief of the sector and then the assistant chief and chief of the operational department. In June 1935 Tikhonov went to Mongolia as an advisor to the Mongolian People's Army cavalry. Between December 1935 and April 1936 he participated in the border conflicts with Japan in the Tamsak-Bulak area. For his actions during the border conflicts, Tikhonov was awarded the Mongolian Order of the Red Banner and the Order of the North Star.

World War II  After Operation Barbarossa, the 7th Airborne Brigade took part in the defense of the line on the Berezina River. Tikhonov was seriously wounded on 4 July and commanded the reformed 2nd Airborne Corps after leaving the hospital. The corps became the 32nd Guards Rifle Division in May 1942, part of the 47th Army deployed in defence of the Black Sea coast. After the German breakthrough in Case Blue during the summer, the division was transferred to Tuapse, where it reportedly disrupted German attacks on the city. Tikhonov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his actions defending Tuapse. On 17 November, he was promoted to major general. From January 1943, the division fought in the Battle of the Caucasus and the Krasnodar Offensive. On 30 January, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for his leadership of the 7th Airborne Brigade in 1941.Order of the Red Banner citation 30 Jan 1943, available online at pamyat-naroda.ru From 9 March to 2 April, Tikhonov commanded the 11th Guards Rifle Corps, part of the 9th Army during the advance on the Taman Peninsula. In July he became the deputy commander of the 58th Army, where he was wounded and in August the deputy commander of the 56th Army. Tikhonov fought in the Novorossiysk-Taman Operation and was wounded again in October. Tikhonov was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class on 25 October. In January 1944, Tikhonov was appointed commander of the 108th Rifle Corps of the Leningrad Front's 42nd Army. During the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive, the army captured Ropsha, Krasnogvardeysk, Gdov and Koivisto, as well as helping break the Siege of Leningrad. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 22 February. In the spring, the corps transferred to the line of Vyborg and fought in the Vyborg‚ÄìPetrozavodsk Offensive, capturing Uuras. On 9 August 1944, he became the commander of the 39th Guards Airborne Corps in Kalinin. In January 1945, the corps converted to infantry as part of the 9th Guards Army. The corps was sent to the front on 21 March and fought in the Vienna Offensive, in which it participated in the capture of Vienna. On 28 April, Tikhonov was awarded the Order of Kutuzov 1st class.Order of Kutuzov 1st class citation at pamyat- naroda.ru After the capture of Vienna it advanced in the Prague Offensive.

He was a fellow of St John's College (1919‚Äì1985), Cambridge, and held the positions of University Lecturer in Agriculture (1926‚Äì1930) and Drapers Professor of Agriculture (1930‚Äì1957) at Cambridge, where he directed the School of Agriculture from 1930 to 1957. Engledow advised the British government on agricultural production in the (former) colonies as well as in the homeland from 1927 to 1962. He kept publishing on agricultural practices and teaching after his retirement.G.D.H. Bell, Frank Leonard Engledow. 20 August 1890 ‚Äì 3 July 1985; Biogr. Mems. Fell. R. Soc. 1986 32, 188‚Äì219, published 1 December 1986 Education  Engledow was born in Deptford, Kent, the fifth and youngest child of Henry Engledow, a police sergeant and, after his retirement, agent of Bexleyheath Brewery and Elizabeth Prentice. Frank was educated at Dartford Grammar School, from where he went to University College London to study pure and applied mathematics and physics on a one-year scholarship. He won College Prizes in these subjects and obtained a year later a BSc externally. He was then admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, where he was more interested in the application of mathematics than in the theory which he was supposed to be studying. He was, however, allowed to change to study botany, zoology and geology and earned a First in Part I of the Natural Sciences Tripos in 1912, the award of a Slater Studentship of the College and, later, a Research Scholarship of the Ministry of Agriculture. He had been accepted as assistant by R.H. Biffen,F. L. Engledow, 'Rowland Harry Biffen, 1874‚Äì1949', Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society, 7 (1950): 9‚Äì25. who had been appointed in 1908 as the first Professor of Agricultural Botany and became the first Director of the newly founded Plant Breeding Institute in 1912. A programme of research combining genetics with quantitative methods and statistics was launched resulting in three papers by Engledow in 1914. One of these was co-authored by G. Udny Yule (then Lecturer in Statistics in Cambridge), who became very interested in the statistics to be used in agricultural botany. Engledow became a Fellow of St John's, submitting his thesis in 1919 based on his experimental work. World War I Engledow enlisted in The Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment shortly before the war. From 1915 to 1919 the Regiment served in India and Mesopotamia and Engledow rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was stationed in Jhanai, where he was also in hospital with typhoid, and at regimental headquarters in Rawalpindi.St. Johns College, Papers of Sir Frank Leonard Engledow, notebook, box 3 Late in 1917 he spent a number of months as assistant to the Director of Agriculture of Mesopotamia. He was decorated with a Croix de Guerre in 1918. During his overseas service he made notes on the agricultural practices he saw. After the war he returned to the School of Agriculture and the Plant Breeding Institute to resume his research. The Plant Breeding Institute Anstey Hall-Former headquarters of Plant Breeding Institute (from 1955) The Institute was a rather modest facility and the work very labour-intensive. Nevertheless, fruitful research was done on breeding wheat and barley. Biffen's discovery that characteristics such as resistance to disease and grain quality were inheritable was the basis by which Engledow, by introducing quantitative analysis and statistics, was able to improve these crops. Seven consecutive papers on wheat were published between 1923 and 1930 in the Journal of Agricultural Science of Cambridge and with G. Udney Yule he published a seminal paper on yield trials in 1926. These papers were innovative with regard to breeding of cereals and other commodities, linking the roles of geneticists, plant breeders and field experimentalists. Engledows breeding activities resulted in new varieties of wheat by selection (Rampton Rivet cultivated 1939‚Äì57, Squareheads Master 13/4, 1940‚Äì60), and by hybridisation (Holdfast, 1936‚Äì58 and Steadfast, 1941‚Äì53). In 1921 he married Mildred Emmeline Roper, a graduate botany student from Cape Town, South Africa. She gave up her academic activity to become his wife and expert adviser on a daily basis. In 1924 they made a tour through Canada and the USA for seven weeks, visiting various agricultural areas and a scientific meeting, to become better acquainted with the agricultural practices of that continent.Report on a tour in North America, St. Johns College, Papers of Sir Frank Leonard Engledow, notebook, box 3 and box 4. Drapers Professorship In 1930 Engledow was appointed to the Drapers chair of Agriculture in 1930, having been Lecturer in Agriculture from 1926. Once he became Professor the School of Agriculture was extended. The Plant Breeding Institute was enlarged from 250 to 450 acres, more research laboratories were installed and advisory services were begun. Engledow was active in developing and planning further changes in the School and its curriculum to reflect the changing role of agricultural science in improving food production worldwide. During World War II he served in the Home Guard and the Ministry of Agriculture, helping food production. He was also a member of the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) of England and Wales and the Agricultural Improvement Council (AIC). These activities culminated in him attending the United Nations conference on Food and Agriculture in 1943 in Hot Springs, VA, USA as a deputy of the Ministry. Back home he wrote a policy Memorandum for England and Wales based on a recommendation of the UN Conference. The report was approved by ARC and AIC and was to serve as the foundation for agricultural policy in the UK. In 1943 he was appointed as a Managing Trustee of the newly established Nuffield Foundation, retiring in 1966.The Nuffield Foundation Triennial Report (1983‚Äì85), The Nuffield Foundation, London, 1986. He was, as Chairman of a special committee responsible for the study and the publication of \\"Principles for British Agricultural Policy\\" that had been initiated in 1945 and was completed in the late fifties.H.T. Williams (ed). Principles for British Agricultural Policy.Published for the Nuffield Foundation by Oxford University Press, Oxford 1960 He became a Knight Bachelor in 1944 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1946. His plans for the School of Agriculture, formulated in 1939, were to be put in practice after the war when both the research institutes and the advisory service were taken up in nationwide organisations. Well aware of the changing expectations in the post-war world of the role of agricultural science and of the alumni of the School, he was concerned with the balance between specialisation and breadth, as his papers of 1968 and 1970 show. Direct contact with farming practices and their consequences for the environment in the long-term were the responsibility of his graduates, he maintained. Travelling and advising Engledow undertook a long series of overseas travels with the aim of advising either local parties or governmental bodies or part of the British government:J M.

Personal life Engledow married in 1921 Mildred Emmeline Roper (Cape Town, 1896‚Äì1956, Cambridge). They had four daughters, Margareth Elizabeth (1922‚Äì1974), Catherine Mary (1924‚Äì1984), Ruth Mildred (1928) and Audrey Rachel (1933‚Äì2002). They lived from 1931 onwards on Huntingdon Road next to Howe Farm, a part of Cambridge University Farm (which also included the Plant Breeding Institute) in a newly built house called Hadleigh.

There were few experienced teachers who were available to teach newer members, and prompted concerns from organizational leadership that it would not be feasible to accommodate demand, particularly because taiko was normally taught orally. To resolve this problem, Oguchi developed a textbook called that was published in 1994. However, leadership at the Foundation were not satisfied with the publication because they felt it was written too heavily in favor of Oguchi's specific performance methods, and that it lacked a general set of fundamental performance techniques that would allow for an organized certification process. The Foundation later published a more recent textbook in 2001 called the that provides a set of basic techniques, such as how to hold a percussion mallet and suggested stretching methods to prepare for performance. The textbook has been revised and was republished in 2006. In 1997, the organization was renamed in Japanese from to , but is still referred to as the Nippon Taiko Foundation in English. Membership Hyde Park in London from 2001. The Foundation has generally been recognized for its work in connecting taiko performance groups across Japan and internationally. As of 2012, the Foundation represents over 800 taiko groups, approximately 20,000 individuals, and is made up of 34 leagues corresponding to some Japanese prefectures. It also has a membership of over 8000 certified instructors of taiko performance at various levels both within and outside Japan.

History Already before the electrified S-Bahn came about, there was a trial for electrified commuter trains running from Potsdamer Wannseebahnhof to Zehlendorf in 1902 and from Potsdamer Ringbahnhof to Lichterfelde Ost from 1903. Also in 1903, the AEG company ran an overhead wire test track from Niedersch√∂neweide to Spindlersfeld. Electrification also came about as part of the solution to increase capacity along the Hamburg-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn. World War I interrupted the electrification plans from 1914 to 1918, which, however, were revived just afterwards. In 1920 the Prussian state railways ordered six test trains, which were first pulled by steam locomotives until electrification commenced in 1923. One year later, on 8 August 1924, the first section from Stettiner Vorortbahnhof to Bernau was inaugurated; the two other northern railway lines to Oranienburg and Velten (Kremmen Railway) followed until 1927. To service all electrified connections, Deutsche Reichsbahn purchased 34 power cars and 51 trailers in total. In everyday operation, however, the engines soon proved to be too weak and already in 1925 upgraded versions (the later DR Class ET 168 and ET 165) were ordered in large numbers. After the war, the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn had planned to use modernized ET 169 trains on branch lines from Wannsee to Stahnsdorf and from Zehlendorf to D√ºppel, or as additional trains on the northern Ringbahn and on the Siemensbahn branch from Jungfernheide. But when the Berlin S-Bahn was divided due to the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, they were all again allocated to the Oranienburg, Bernau and Velten stretches of the line. The trainsets were phased out from 1962 and most trains were withdrawn in 1969. Some components were re-used for the rolling stock of the East Berlin U-Bahn line E.

Early life and education Born in Cauca, Colombia on August 27, 1966, he later moved to the city of Popay√°n and studied for the priesthood with the Franciscan Friars of the Province of St. Paul the Apostle in Colombia. He soon changed plans, and returned to his family farm in Cauca. Labor activism In 1990, along with other farmers, Gonz√°lez Duque founded MCC, Movimiento Campesino de Cajibio (The Small Scale Farmers Movement of Cajibio), which consists of various farmers‚Äô movements in the municipality of Cajibio, Cauca. The group is a self-help organization meant to deal with various problems related affecting local communities in rural Colombia. Since then, Gonz√°lez Duque has worked as an international representative of the organization and a key figure in domestic issues affecting low-income farmers in Colombia. In 1999, he became the target of death threats for leading a forum about the impact of planting pine and eucalyptus trees for mass production (monocultures) by the Multinational SMURFIT KAPPA CARDBOARD COLOMBIA, and its effect on water, food security and land ownership. International recognition In 2008, Gonz√°lez Duque led the MCC as it took part in the Minga of Social and Community Resistance where a public debate was held with the President of the Republic and was followed by a walk from the south of the country to the capital Bogota. About 50,000 people, including members of the indigenous community, students, trade unionists, women and residents of urban areas joined. In 2011, MCC began working towards elaborating a Contingency Plan for Human Rights. In June of that year, the MCC also promoted the \\"Caravan for life and Presence in the Territory\\" with the accompaniment from the international community, the United Nations, Vice President office, the Ombudsmans office, Witness for Peace, and other human rights and Social organizations in Colombia, in order to raise awareness of the situation and engage with the national government and international community to protect the welfare of the communities. As a result of these efforts, Gonz√°lez Duque traveled across the US, meeting students in university campuses and other labor leaders. Currently, Gonz√°lez Duque is delegated to represent the MCC in national human rights platforms such as the Colombia Europe USA coordination, the Alliance of social and related organizations, as well as the regional organization: Network for Life and Human Rights in Cauca. He is also the national coordinator of the Argo-Environmental Plan of Dignity in Life (Agro- Ambiental del Plan de Vida Digna - Movimiento Campesino de Cajib√≠o).

It is a very rare shrub, endemic to Norfolk Island where it occurs in a few scattered locations. Description Myoporum obscurum is a spreading shrub or small dome-shaped tree which sometimes grows to a height of . The leaves are arranged alternately and are thin, elliptic to lance-shaped, long, wide, have a shiny upper surface and a dull lower one with a distinct mid-vein. The edges of the leaf are wavy and occasionally have a few small teeth near the end. The flowers appear in groups of 3 to 6 in the axils of the leaves on the end of flattened stalks long. They have 5 lance-shaped sepals and 5 petals joined at their bases to form a tube. The tube is long and the lobes are about the same length as the tube. The tube is white, spotted purple on the lobes and inside the tube and the inside of the tube is hairy. There are 4 stamens which extend slightly beyond the petal tube.The fruit is an oval-shaped, reddish drupe. Taxonomy and naming Myoporum obscurum was first formally described in 1833 by Stephan Endlicher and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Norfolkicae. The type specimen was found on Norfolk Island by Ferdinand Bauer. The specific epithet is derived from the \\"Latin obscurum, indistinct, dark\\". Distribution and habitat Only a few specimens of Myoporum obscurum remain and only in a few scattered locations on Norfolk Island. The species was common on nearby Phillip Island in 1830, but along with most of the rest of the vegetation there, was lost in the 19th century due to erosion caused by the introduction of pest animals such as rabbits. In 2003 only 5 plants were known on Norfolk Island, all in the national park. Since then a management plan for the species has been prepared and a number of specimens of popwood have been planted. It does not tolerate shade and is generally found on forest margins. Ecology Little is known of the ecology of popwood, other than it is threatened by competition from weed species.

History and Structure  The roots of the current Institute for Social Anthropology can be traced back to March 2, 1938, when the erstwhile Commissions for \\"Research on Illiterate Languages of Non-European Peoples\\" and for \\"Publishing Songs and Texts Recorded in Prisoner of War Camps\\" at the Austrian Academy of Sciences were merged into the new \\"Commission for Research on Primitive Cultures and Languages.\\" As the Commission‚Äôs research focus increasingly turned to complex societies, in line with developments within anthropology at the time, it was renamed \\"Ethnological Commission\\" on November 22, 1961. In the years between 1955 and 1965, Prof. Robert Heine-Geldern established a focus on the region of Southeast Asia for the first time in the history of AAS. From 1980 to 2000 Prof. Walter Dostal substantially expanded the already existing focus on Southeast Asia by two additional core fields ‚Äì South-Western Arabia and Tibet. A second institutional merger took place under Prof. Walter Dostal on January 1, 1993, when the \\"Arabic Commission\\" was integrated into the Ethnological Commission, resulting both in an interdisciplinary approach that provided a strong foundation for research on intercultural relations, and in a special emphasis on language competency in its anthropological work. As it became clear that the term \\"ethnos\\" did not adequately capture anthropology‚Äôs research focus on the human anymore, the Commission for Ethnology was renamed, on January 18, 1995, to \\"Commission for Social Anthropology.\\" Since 1995, this socio-anthropological research approach follows an interdisciplinary program by conducting empirical and ethnographic investigations in connection with philological and historical analyses and intercultural comparative studies of socio-cultural phenomena. The award of the Wittgenstein prize to Prof. Andre Gingrich in the year 2000 marked the start of a new era at the Commission. On January 1, 2007, the \\"Commission for Social Anthropology\\" was transformed into a Research Unit as part of the \\"Center for Studies in Asian Cultures and Social Anthropology,\\" and awarded temporary institutional status as the \\"Institute for Social Anthropology\\" on January 1, 2010. Following a successful external evaluation, it was granted permanent status on September 15, 2011. In 2019, Andre Gingrich retired, and Stephan Kloos took over as interim director. Today, the Institute for Social Anthropology constitutes one of the Austrian Academy of Sciences‚Äô flagship institutes in the humanities and social sciences, and counts among the top European research institutions in anthropology.  Regional foci  ISA‚Äôs regional foci and expertise encompass: 1) the Islamic Middle East and North Africa, 2) primarily Buddhist Central Asia and the Tibetan language-speaking Himalayan regions, as well as 3) Southeast Asia and the islands of the Indian Ocean. Researchers on the Middle East examine, inter alia, social transformations and conflicts of South- Western Arabia past and present and the memory of crimes against humanity among Kurdish people. In Central Asia, Tibet and the Himalayan region, staff carry out research on imperial-time and early Buddhist Tibet, Tibetan medicine, material culture, mobility, nomadism and memory. Ongoing projects in the region of Southeast Asia and the islands of the Indian Ocean include research on health-related mobility and tourism in the Republic of Maldives, on Islamic movements and the nexus of Buddhism, gender and economy in mainland Southeast Asia, on learning, planning and imagining in rural and urban Southeast Asia, and on social media and Islamic practices in Indonesia. Methodologically, ISA pursues gender-sensitive ethnographic fieldwork carried out in local languages and systematic cross-cultural comparison in its analyses and interpretations of socio-cultural processes in the past and present.  Events  Since 2002, ISA has co-organized the international Eric Wolf Lectures in collaboration with the Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology of the University of Vienna and the International Research Center for Cultural Studies (IFK). Every year, a prominent representative of the discipline is invited to hold a public lecture. Since 2004, the Eric Wolf Lectures are published in Current Anthropology. About eight times a year, the institute organizes its ISA International Guest Lectures, for which ISA invites researchers from all relevant fields and well-established lecturers. These lectures ‚Äì mainly in English ‚Äì are published in the institute‚Äôs working papers in Social Anthropology. Every two years, ISA organizes an \\"International Anthropological Atelier\\" ‚Äì a special workshop together with another European anthropological institute in order to share, discuss, and develop preliminary results of ongoing research. The outcomes of the workshop are published as an edited volume or a special focus section in a leading journal of the field. ISA‚Äôs Research Forum is meant primarily as an internal forum for staff members of ISA or partner institutions to present new projects as well as the results of ongoing or already completed research. Occasionally, ISA organizes or co-organizes domestic as well as international conferences and seminars on theoretical-methodological debates, special topics, or regional agendas. In 2004, ISA co-organized the 8th EASA Biennial Conference, in 2011 the GAA Conference 2011, and in 2015 the 8th EuroSEAS Conference as well as the 11th CHaGS Conference in Vienna.  Publications  Since 1996, ISA publishes the book series \\"Ver√∂ffentlichungen zur Sozialanthropologie\\" (\\"Publications in Social Anthropology\\"). This series is available from the Austrian Academy of Sciences Press. Since 2008, AAS Working Papers in Social Anthropology appear several times a year. This series is available online and open access on the institute‚Äôs homepage. Another publication is the book series \\"Sammlung Eduard Glaser\\", which is also available from the Austrian Academy of Sciences Press.

It was established in 2003, and aims to deliver aid to the poor and vulnerable, as well as education for the Muslim community. It specialises in humanitarian support, international development, emergency aid and disaster relief in some of the world's most deprived areas. Al-Khair Foundation aims to tackle issues prevalent in the UK, such as unemployment, education, women's empowerment and domestic violence.  History  The name of the foundation, ‚ÄòAl-Khair‚Äô, is translated to mean ‚Äògoodness‚Äô in Arabic. The AKF began as an Islamic school in Croydon in 2003. It evolved into a service organisation to the UK community first, with an initial focus on education, and also charity work. The founder of the AKF School is the Imam, Imam Qasim. The Islamic school began with five enrolled pupils. The sports hall was previously a converted warehouse and the school itself was previously an office. By 2013, the school grew into a primary and secondary school with over 350 pupils. AKF then began to build schools overseas for orphans and children from underprivileged communities. This led to AKF's work with widows and vulnerable women, and then to the establishment of the AKF shelters. Eventually AKF launched their water aid and livelihood projects, as well as the AKF medical aid programmes. In 2005, AKF launched their first Overseas Disaster Relief venture to provide emergency aid during the Kashmir earthquake. That October, and in the winter months which followed, AKF's relief teams provided survivors with medicine, food, shelter kits and moral support. Ever since, AKF has undertaken emergency aid missions all over the world. In this year Al-Khair school also passed their first Ofsted inspection.https://fluencycdn.fluencycms.co.uk/FileCluster/AlKhair/MainFolder/Documents/School_Information.pdf In 2007, AKF established their first shelter project in Kashmir, and two years later AKF bought IQRA TV, a free-to-air channel available on Sky TV. IQRA TV's educational Islamic-based programmes including 'Live with IQ', 'IQRA with IQRA', and 'Questions and Answers'. In 2010, AKF was a founding member of the Muslim Charities Forum.Al-Khair Foundation Ramadan 2015 leaflet- 'This Ramadan save lives' AKF has supported the victims of many earthquakes, including the Haiti earthquake and Pakistan floods of 2010, the horn of Africa famine relief, and the Japan earthquake of 2011. Their work in Haiti was recognised by the United Nations in 2010, and they were the only UK Muslim charity working with survivors on the ground in the Japan earthquake of 2011. In 2012, AKF created their first official partnership- a MoU with Malaysian Red Crescent. In July 2015, AKF also signed a MoU with the UN to facilitate education for Gazan children. In 2014, the revenue made by AKF was 21.4 million. The Foundation aims to save lives in emergencies and provide for disaster zones with medical aid, food shelter. It also aims to help the needy by adopting practical ways to root out poverty from the world through relief and development programmes in South Asia, the Middle-East, East Africa and United Kingdom.  Activities  AKF's activities are categorised into the following: sustainable development and aid, awareness raising, working with partners and advocacy.  Sustainable development & aid  AKF provides relief to help those affected or displaced by disasters and conflict. However, AKF also enable vulnerable people to become in a position in which they can help themselves in the long term. This is through the use of sustainable development programmes, which range from livelihood projects to long-term water aid projects. Notable ongoing work by AKF also includes work to prevent future floods in Pakistan through the use of infrastructure relief, rehabilitation and aid projects. Such projects extend beyond the basic provision of aid to impoverished areas through the creation or reconstruction of basic public services which are damaged by natural or man-made disasters.  Awareness raising  Al-Khair Schools aim to educate and encourage children on how they can engage with and give back to their communities. AKF is conscious in advocating the needs of the wider community, through local action in order to make a difference.  Partnerships  AKF works nationally and globally with more than 30 partners, including the following: Qatar Red Crescent, UNRWA, Kenya Red Cross, United Muslim Relief, UNHCR, Global One, Afghan Aid, Tayyab trust, Christian Aid, UMR and Islamic Help and many more. AKF is also a member of the Coalition of Muslim NGOs and participated in a Christian-Muslim Humanitarian partnerships workshop, hosted by the Lutheran world federation in Jordan in 2013. AKF is also regularly involved in attending Aidex conferences and events.  Advocacy  AKF aims to advocate for global issues, which its members believe requires more than donations. AKF also aims to promote interfaith dialogue and harmonious relations, and is actively involved in annual conferences to engage religious leaders and people of many backgrounds to promote tolerance and understanding .  Senior management  The founder and chairman of Al-Khair Foundation, Imam Qasim Rashid Ahmad, and is largely involved in AKF's work in the UK and internationally. Before founding AKF, he had graduated in the Islamic sciences and was an imam and community/faith leader at the Croydon Mosque. He also worked as a counsellor and teacher for reforming prisoners for nearly a decade at Her Majesty's Prisons. Imam Qasim established and oversaw many of the charity's aid and development programmes to date. He is also the CEO of IQRA TV. Dr Jafer Qureshi a Senior Consultant Psychiatrist based in Birmingham and is Al Khair Foundation's trustee. He also serves on the board of Muslim Aid Sweden and India. In April 2015, AKF appointed a new CEO, Saif Ahmad. He has worked with local and central government for over 30 years, as well as in the private and voluntary sectors. He was formerly the a CEO of the UK charities Muslim Aid and Islamic Help, and was also the founder of the charities- Faith Regen foundation, MADE and Global One. He has also been a member of the National Young People's Learning Committee of the Learning and Skills Council, the Regeneration Practitioners‚Äô Group of the Home Office, and the Policy Action Team of the Social Exclusion Unit of the Cabinet Office.  Locations  In the United Kingdom, AKF has office in London (East Croydon and Bounds Green), Bolton, Glasgow, Sheffield, Leicester and Blackburn. The group also operates in Bangladesh, Somaliland, Kenya, Japan, India, Pakistan, Palestine, Sierra Leone, Albania, Myanmar, Philippines, Afghanistan, Haiti and Chile.

They may be partnered with game development tools, special game engine licenses, and other middleware to aid video game development. GDKs are typically not available to the public, and require game developers to enter an agreement, partnership, or program with the hardware manufacturer to gain access to the hardware. As game console generations pass, development kits often get sold through websites like eBay without repercussions. This is often because the console manufacturers discontinue certain development programs as time passes.  Overview  In the 1980s, computing did not involve 3D modelling or any complex programming due to the limitations of hardware. This, combined with the hobbyist nature of early computer game programming, meant that not many individuals or smaller companies would develop for consoles. Even when consoles became mainstream (such as the Nintendo Entertainment System), there was no official or publicly available GDK since most console manufacturers would develop their games in- house. For example, Nintendo had internal development teams for both hardware and software. By the fifth generation of consoles, game development kits were developed to encourage more developers to make console games and grow the videogame industry. Game development kits began as a simple way for developers to connect their computers to console hardware, allowing them to compile software on their PC and see it play directly on a console. Once most GDKs started becoming bundled with hardware-specific software, hobbyists or anyone not directly affiliated with a console manufacturer would have to write their games without the specialized software to access unique features such as the Xbox One's Kinect or the Wii U GamePad. Modern game development kits often come bundled with the specialized software, and are much more formalized compared to previous-generation GDKs. In older generations of console gaming, developers had to make their own hardware and write games at various levels of programming (such as assembly). Today, programs such as Unity 3D provide a complete software environment and console manufacturers such as Nintendo provide polished & powerful development hardware through their developer programs. Other console manufacturers even allow the retail consoles to be used as development kits, provided that the development software is being used by the developer.  Third-generation videogame development kits  The NES Mission Control debug cartridge.  Nintendo Entertainment System  For a significant portion of the NES lifespan, there was no official development kit. Video game developers creating games for the NES would have to make their own development kits, such as Rocket Science Production with their \\"NES Mission Control\\" development system. At least two programs were used in conjunction with the NES Mission Control hardware; NESTEST.EXE which would be used to test and debug the development hardware, and HST.EXE which would be used for communication between a computer and the NES development hardware.  Fourth-generation videogame development kits   Super Nintendo Entertainment System  The Super Nintendo Entertainment System used specialized EPROM cartridges for development, as well as various software. Similar to the NES, developers often made their own development software or relied on middleware made by other developers.  Fifth-generation video game development kits   PlayStation  The developer version of the PlayStation; a blue console. There are several variations of the PlayStation development kit used for game creation. One variation of the development kit had only three components, while the PlayStation Ultimate Development Kit included up to 26 components, including the complete Net Yaroze development kit. The Net Yaroze version of the development kit was unique in that it had some features removed and added compared to the official (complete) PlayStation development kit. The Net Yaroze hardware was designed for hobbyists, while official developers would have access to the official PlayStation development kits. There was also a blue version of the PlayStation made for developers that would read burned discs to allow quick testing of imaged builds of their videogames. While there were official PlayStation- branded CD-Rs that could be used with the blue PlayStation, regular CD-Rs were also compatible with the system.  Nintendo 64/64DD  The Nintendo 64 Gangwriter used to duplicate games across cartridges. The Nintendo 64 development kit consisted of multiple components, both for the N64 and its add-on, the N64DD. The main hardware used in N64 game development was the Partner-N64 Development Kit,https://n64squid.com/homebrew/n64-sdk/development- hardware/ and used tall cartridges for game development/testing rather than the short cartridges that were sold with retail games. Another hardware component in N64 development was the NU64 Flash Gang Writer, which allowed developers to copy data from one cartridge to multiple cartridges simultaneously. This device was primarily used to create press and test copies of games, and also relied on tall cartridges instead of short retail cartridges. Other versions of the Nintendo 64 GDK are the SN Systems development suite, as well as the SN Maestro 64 Music development system. The development suite allowed developers to run code from a computer directly to the console, and included a software package. The Maestro 64 Music system allowed developers to load music software on to the console, and play music through the Nintendo 64's hardware. another unofficial alternative to develop games for the N64 was the Doctor V64, made by Bung Enterprises.https://www.retroreversing.com/turok64sourcecode  Sixth- generation video game development kits   Dreamcast  Sega Dreamcast units were unique in that they used GD-ROM discs; giga discs that held 1GB of data. This was slightly more than a typical CD, but less than a DVD. While GD- ROM burners were used by some developers, since the Dreamcast was compatible with CDs and since most games didn't take up 1GB of data at the time, GD-ROMs remained uncommon as developers opted to use the more-easily accessible CDs for their disc media. The console itself was white, like the retail version of the Dreamcast console, but unlike the retail console, the dev kit console looked like a typical desktop PC from the 1990s but shorter in height. The boot up screen of the dev kit console is also different, as it uses 3D graphics instead of the 2D graphics used in the retail console.  PlayStation 2  The dev kit console for the PS2 looked like a retail PS2, but substantially thicker.  Nintendo GameCube  The dev kit console of the Nintendo GameCube was white and shaped like a tower desktop PC, with the controller ports being where the optical disk drive would normally go.https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/8jn7of/development_kits_for_playstation_2_gamecube_xbox/  Xbox  When developers were creating software for the original Xbox, a prototype of the controller was used in the early development kits. This controller was slimmer, had elongated sides, and used a USB cable instead of an Xbox port-compatible cable. The dev kit console was shaped like a tower desktop PC, was grey colored and had a green circle in the middle of the front of the console with an X inside the circle.  Seventh-generation video game development kits   Xbox 360  Microsoft manages the Xbox 360 Tools and Middleware Program, which licenses development kits (hardware and software) to professional software developers working on tools and technologies for games. Access to this program requires good industry references, prior experience in games tools and middleware development, and signing a non-disclosure agreement.  PlayStation 3  The PlayStation developer program allows registered developers to publish their games across the PlayStation Network, making their games accessible on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation TV all through one program.  Wii  The original Wii development hardware. The Wii development kit was a bundle of the \\"NDEV\\" hardware ‚Äì a big black box full of debugging/testing hardware that looks nothing like the slim white Wii consoles sold to consumers ‚Äì and a disc containing the developer software tools.  Eighth-generation video game development kits   Xbox One  Microsoft maintains multiple developer programs for people wanting to develop games for their platforms; ID@Xbox for Xbox One game development, and the Windows Dev Center for Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Xbox One game and application development. * The ID@Xbox program allows qualified game developers to self-publish their games to the Xbox One, as well as access free middleware and use two development hardware kits for free. * The Windows Dev Center allows developers to create apps and games on Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10 platforms as part of the Universal Windows Platform system.  PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita  The PlayStation developer program allows registered developers to publish their games across the PlayStation Network, making their games accessible on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation TV all through one program. The PlayStation 4 development kits were known as \\"Orbis\\", though this was just a codename. Academic institutions can register to receive PS4 development kits for educational use, and are not region-restricted unlike regular PlayStation Developer Program members.  Wii U  Nintendo maintains a unified developer program for both its Wii U and Nintendo 3DS families of platforms. This developer program provides software and middleware to developers, and allows developers to self-publish their games to the Nintendo eShop. Games and applications published through this program are considered \\"third-party\\" and do not belong to Nintendo, allowing independent developers to publish their games on multiple different platforms. The Wii U development hardware consists of a system called \\"CAT-DEV\\", with its accompanying peripherals such as the Display Remote Controller (presumably the Wii U GamePad) and sensor bar.  Nintendo 3DS Family  Nintendo's developer program allows developers to use Nintendo 3DS development kits, and allows developers to self-publish their games to the Nintendo eShop. As mentioned in the Nintendo Wii U section above, games and applications published through this program are considered \\"third-party\\" and do not belong to Nintendo, allowing independent developers to publish their games on multiple different platforms. Strangely, some 3DS development kits cannot play retail games.
