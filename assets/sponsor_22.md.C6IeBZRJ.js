However, they are actually dark tones of azure, not blue. Thornycroft Antar Mk 3 in Royal Air Force blue colour scheme These air force blue colours are used by these various air forces for colour identification. RAF blue Air Force blue, more specifically Air Force blue (RAF) or RAF blue, is a medium shade of the colour azure. The shade derives from the light blue uniforms issued to the newly formed British Royal Air Force in 1920, which were influential in the design of the uniforms of some other air forces around the world. Similar shades are still used in Royal Air Force uniforms and the Royal Air Force Ensign. The choice of blue uniforms for the RAF was the result of a surplus of inexpensive medium sky blue coloured herringbone twill in the United Kingdom, which had been intended for use in the uniforms of Czarist Russian imperial cavalrymen before the Russian Revolution occurred.

Description The red-necked crake is a large crake (length 25 cm, wingspan 40 cm, weight 200 g). Its head, neck and breast are red-brown, with a paler version of that color on the throat. The upperparts are grey-brown, while the underparts are grey-brown with pale barring. The underwing is barred black and white, the bill green, and the legs grey-brown. Distribution and habitat Red-necked crakes live in the Moluccas, Lesser Sundas, New Guinea lowlands and adjacent islands, and north-eastern Australia. They are found in tropical rainforests and dense vegetation close to permanent wetlands. Behaviour Diet The bird's diet consists of amphibians, aquatic invertebrates, crustaceans and molluscs. Breeding The bird rests on or close to ground in dense vegetation. It lays clutches of 3-5 dull-white eggs, the incubation periods of which are around 20 days. The chicks emerge covered in black down, precocial and nidifugous. Voice The crake makes repetitive clicking calls and soft grunts. Conservation With a large range and no evidence of significant decline, this species is assessed as being of least concern. The species is little studied and seldom seen due to its secretive nature, but appears to be locally common in New Guinea. In Australia it has suffered declines due to habitat loss.

In the US, MSRS has found important application in the precision measurement of missile trajectories at the Air Force Eastern Test Range, which extends from the Florida mainland to the Indian Ocean. These MSRSs include the AZUSA, the MISTRAM, and the UDOP. All systems employ a cooperative beacon transponder on the observed target and a ground-based transmitting station with several receiving stations at separate, precisely located sites.V S Chernyak. Fundamentals of Multisite Radar Systems: Multistatic Radars and Multiradar Systems. (Translated from Russian). CRC Press: New York, 1998. pp.26–27.Schneid, Daniel L. The UDOP Handbook. National Technical Information Service document no. AD0609038, July 1964, 214 pp. The UDOP used an AN/DRN-11 transponder installed in the Saturn (rocket family) launch vehicle for Project Gemini missions. The C-band CW interferometric AZUSA, in operation from the 1950s, has one transmitter and nine receivers located along two crossed baselines with the total lengths of about . Intermediate receivers spaced at are used for phase ambiguity resolution. The AZUSA system measures range by phase measurement of sideband frequencies modulating the carrier, coherent range by Doppler count, two direction cosines, and two cosine rates. Errors of less than in range and 20 ppm in direction cosine are obtainable. Missile Trajectory Measurement (MISTRAM) is a CW interferometric system with receiving stations situated along two mutually perpendicular baselines spaced at . This MSRS can measure range, four range differences, range rate and four range difference rates of a target. The range error is less than . Principles of operation There is nothing new in using a CW tracking system to obtain metric data. The system was augmented in 1965 by short baselines of a few meters to a few hundred meters in contrast to the conventional UDOP system with baselines of several kilometers and longer. The UDOP system was used extensively for the Saturn program at the NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center (NASA-KSC).Instrumentation Systems Analysis Branch (K-ED2) and Tracking Branch (K-EF4). Saturn early launch phase tracking by CW Doppler. John F. Kennedy Space Center, SP-79, April 13, 1964, NASA doc. no. N65-19700, 52 pp. UDOP is a 2-way, coherent, continuous-wave, tracking system. It is a highly reliable data source providing very accurate velocity measurements. The UDOP system, a descendant of Doppler Velocity and Position (DOVAP) was developed by NASA-KSC. Operation Functional Block Diagram of UDOP Close-In Tracking System UDOP consists of three basic elements: :# The ground transmitters :# The airborne transponder :# The ground receiver In practice, a central recording station and data handling system are also used. A simplified, functional block diagram of the close-in UDOP tracking system is shown in the figure. The transmitters use a primary frequency standard to derive the frequencies used. The standard is multiplied to 50MHz and broadcast as a reference signal to the receiver sites. The 50MHz is multiplied to 450MHz and transmitted to the transponder on board the vehicle as an interrogation signal. The transponder receives the 450MHz signal, doubles and re-transmits at 900MHz. The ground stations simultaneously receive the 50MHz reference signal and the 900MHz transponder signal. The 50MHz signal is multiplied by 18 and compared to the 900MHz signal. The difference will be zero for a vehicle on the pad and there will be a Doppler effect (measured in cycles per second) if the vehicle is in motion. This effect will be proportional to a loop velocity with amount depending on the location of the transmitter site, receiver sites, as well as vehicle position and velocity. The UDOP ground receivers are double, superheterodyne, dual-channel units with common local oscillators. All resulting frequencies after mixing are related to the frequency standard except those experiencing Doppler shift. Consequently, the Doppler effects are measurable. Interim- Offset UDOP operation The existing system operates in an offset mode where the reference frequency is raised to 5kHz higher than 900MHz causing a 5kHz beat frequency as long as the vehicle is on the pad. When the vehicle moves, the Doppler effect adds to the 5kHz frequency. The primary advantage is simplification of data handling as the frequency varies from 5kHz rather than zero. This offset frequency is derived using phase-locked loop techniques. Data reduction The UDOP digitized data recorded from each receiver station was fed to a computer which calculated positions X, Y, and Z. These positions were then fitted to a second degree polynomial using midpoint, moving arc smoothing over a one-second interval. From this process, smoothed position, velocity, and acceleration were obtained. The data presented were reduced to an earth-fixed, right-handed, rectangular cartesian coordinate system. The Y axis is normal to the Clarke Spheroid of 1866 and positive upward. The X axis is positive in the direction of the flight azimuth. The origin for the UDOP system is at the vehicle transmitting antenna at vehicle launch position.

Except for a single prototype, no Model 31 trench guns were produced. Despite being well received, sales still lagged far behind the Winchester. Remington went back to the drawing board and designed the Model 870; this shotgun matched the durability of the Model 12 at a significantly lower cost.

LSE,\\" London School of Economics & Political Science Archives Last accessed 17 December 2010 designed by George Bernard Shaw. The window was stolen from Beatrice Webb House in Dorking in 1978 and reappeared at Sotheby's in 2005. It was restored to display in the Shaw Library at the London School of Economics in 2006 at a ceremony presided over by then-Prime-Minister Tony Blair, emphasising New Labour's intellectual debt to the Fabians.Andrew Walker, \\"Wit, wisdom and windows\\", BBC News Last accessed 23 February 2007 Design and construction The stained glass window was designed by George Bernard Shaw in 1910 as a commemoration of the Fabian Society, and shows fellow Society members Sidney Webb and Edward R. Pease, among others, helping to build 'the new world'. Four Fabians, Beatrice and Sidney Webb, Graham Wallas, and George Bernard Shaw founded the London School of Economics with the money left to the Fabian Society by Henry Hutchinson. Supposedly the decision was made at a breakfast party on 4 August 1894. Artist Caroline Townshend (cousin of Shaw's wife Charlotte Payne-Townshend and daughter of Fabian and Suffragette Emily Townshend) created the Fabian window, according to Shaw's design in 1910. Also included in the window besides Shaw and Townshend themselves, were other prominent Fabians such as H. G. Wells, Annie Besant, Graham Wallas, Hubert Bland, Edith Nesbit, Sydney Olivier, Oliver Lodge, Leonard Woolf, and Emmeline Pankhurst. The window explicitly reflects the goal of the Fabian Society to portray an outward role contrary to its real character, i.e. to use deception in pursuing its ultimate aim . Specifically, a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing is the image which appears in the shield above the world being wrought in the Fabian mold. This biblical reference comes from the New Testament and a sermon by Jesus warning that false prophets come in sheep's clothing, but are actually ravening wolves. Authors such as G. Edward Griffin, in his book The Creature from Jekyll Island, have given voice to the reality that this shield image highlights the distinguishing feature of the Fabians as compared to the communists, in that the Fabians desire to create a socialist state using subversive tactics, as opposed to the communist method of revolution and violence. For whatever reason, Shaw never collected the window from her workshop. The belief is that it remained there until 1947, when Mrs Townsend's niece Eva Bourne, also a stained glass artist, presented it to Beatrice Webb House, Holmbury St Mary, near Dorking. This was the year the house was formally opened by the Webb Memorial Trust as a conference and educational venue for the Labour party and the Fabian Society, officially opened by Clement Attlee, who also unveiled the Fabian Window at LSE, having been a former lecturer. Theft and recovery The window was subsequently stolen from the house in 1978 and surfaced in Phoenix, Arizona, soon after but then disappeared again until it suddenly appeared for sale at Sotheby's in July 2005. The Webb Memorial Trust re-purchased it and have now loaned it to the London School of Economics (LSE) to sit alongside the painting of LSE founders Sidney and Beatrice Webb by William Nicholson in the School's Shaw Library. Comments Tony Blair Tony Blair spoke about the remarkable way the Fabians influenced the Labour party, not just in its creation but also in its economic, political and intellectual development. > Despite all the very obvious differences in policy and attitude and > positioning... a lot of the values that the Fabians and George Bernard Shaw > stood for would be very recognisable, at least I hope they would, in today's > Labour party.

The film has earned over US $10 million worldwide.  Plot  The 60-year-old widow Maggie (Marianne Faithfull) desperately needs money for the cost of traveling to Australia for a special medical treatment of her beloved ill grandson Olly. After several unsuccessful attempts to get a job, she finds herself in the streets of Soho. Her eye is caught by poster in the window of a shop called Sexy World: \\"Hostess wanted.\\" She enters, and Miki (Miki Manojlović), the owner of the shop, explains to her frankly that \\"hostess\\" is a euphemism for \\"whore.\\" The job he has for her is one for which age and being visually attractive are not important: a male customer inserts his penis in a hole in a wall (glory hole), and she, at the other side, gives a handjob (however, the film does not show any penis). Her colleague, Luisa, shows her how to do it, and after the first hesitation, she quickly develops good skills. However, she keeps her work secret from friends and family, which leads to uncomfortable situations. After a while, she tells some friends. They are quite interested and ask various details. Under the pseudonym Irina Palm, she becomes increasingly more successful and well-paid, 600 to 800 pounds a week. However, the health of her grandson deteriorates quickly, therefore she asks and receives an advance payment of 6000 pounds for 10 weeks of work. She gives the money to her son Tom (Kevin Bishop) without telling how she got it. He follows her to learn about the source of the money, and is furious when he discovers what she does. He wants her to never go there again and says he will himself return the money and not go to Australia. However, his wife, Sarah, is thankful to Maggie for her sacrifice to save the boy. Tom and Maggie reconcile and Tom, Sarah, and Olly go to Australia. Luisa is fired due to Maggie's success. She is very angry at Maggie. A competitor of Miki's offers Maggie a better job, as supervisor of prostitutes in a room with multiple glory holes. She would get 15% of their earnings.

ASCA is chaired by Mr. Talal Abu-Ghazaleh the Chairman of Talal Abu-Ghazaleh Organization (TAGorg). ASCA is a non-profit professional accounting association which aims at advancing the profession of accounting, management and related disciplines in the countries of the Arab League. ASCA also aims to maintain the professional independence of accountants and their protection through the application of professional supervisory measures as a way to elevate the professions of accounting and auditing.  ACPA Certificate  ASCA contributes to the administrative development in the Arab World by offering the Arab Certified Public Accountant (ACPA) program. The program is accredited by Cambridge University and is increasing recognized in many Arab countries especially that it aims at introducing a group of highly qualified professional accountants to the Arab community, who will take the lead in developing the business practices and economies.  ASCA Membership  ASCA works hard and on a continuous basis to meet all professional requirements to make it eligible to receive appropriate international status. Accordingly, ASCA became an active member in the following international organizations and committees: *The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) *The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) *UN Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR) *The International Committee for Accounting Education and Research *UN International Professional Accounting Qualification Committee (IPAQC). In 1998, ASCA was invited by the International Accounting Standards Board and the International Federation of Accountants to participate in preparing International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and International Auditing, Assurance and Ethics pronouncements. These two professional organizations have accredited ASCA as the sole Arab society for translating all their publications on accountancy and auditing standards and distributing them throughout the Arab world. ASCA also has participated in preparing quality control standards to evaluate the performance of accountants and members of professional societies who are members of the IFAC to ensure their good performance and adherence to the appropriate international standards. Based on the value that ASCA attaches to continuing professional education, a number of specialized training programs in the fields of accounting and auditing are offered by ASCA or through recognized academic institutions throughout the Arab world such as the Talal Abu-Ghazaleh College of Business (TAGCB) at the German-Jordanian University (GJU).

Description and significance Methylobacillus is a group of methylotrophic aerobic bacteria, and they can be found in large numbers in marine and fresh water ecosystems.Chistoserdova L, Lapidus A, Han C, Goodwin L, Saunders L, Brettin T, Tapia R, Gilna P, Lucas S, Richardson PM, Lidstrom ME. “Genome of Methylobacillus flagellatus, Molecular Basis for Obligated Methylotrophy, and Polyphyletic Origin of Methylotrophy” American Society for Microbiology. 2007.

Vol 70, No.4. p. 539-546. These organisms are one of Earth’s most important carbon recyclers, and they recycle such important carbon compounds as methane, methanol, and methylated amines on Earth.Bonnie Jo Bratina, Gregory A. Brusseau, Richard S. Hanson. “Use of 16S rRNA analysis to investigate phylogeny of methylotrophic bacteria” International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology. 1992. Vol 42, No. 4. p. 645-648. “In general methylotrophs can use green-house gases such as carbon dioxide and methane as substrates to fulfill their energy and carbon needs.”Richard S. Hanson, Thomas E. Hanson. “Methanotrophic bacteria” Microbiological Reviews. 1996. Vol 60, No. 2. p. 439-471. Furthermore, strong scientific evidences indicate that a subset group of methylotrophs, the methanotrophs, play huge roles in global warming and groundwater contamination. According to Bonnie et al., methane gas is far more efficient at absorbing infrared radiation than carbon dioxide gas, and “the concentration of methane has been increasing at an alarming rate of 1% per year for the last 150 year to 200 years.” The role that these methylotrophs play in carbon cycling may help us understand, and eventually combat global warming. Thus, it is imperative for researchers to classify, and study methylotrophic bacteria. One such important methylotroph of interest is Methylobacillus flagellatus KT strain. Methylobacillus flagellatus was first isolated in the early 1980s in sewerage pipes of a metropolitan sanitary sewer. “M. flagellatus is most closely related to other members of the family Methylophilaceae.” The shape of M. flagellatus is an oval shape, with multiple flagella originating from opposite poles of the bacteria.Methylobacillus flagellatus KT Using small-subunit 16S rRNAs and comparing metabolic/phylogenic similarities and differences< between M. flagellatus and its relatives, scientists have determined that Methylobacillus flagellatus (betaproteobacteria) is more closely related to Methylobacterium extorquens (alphaproteobacteria) and Methylococcus capsulatus (gammaproteobacteria), than to Methylibium petroleiphilum (betaproteobacteria). Genome structure The genome of Methylobacillus flagellatus is a circular chromosome that is approximately 3Mbp long, and it encodes about 2,766 proteins. According to Chistoserdova et al., M. flagellatus’ genome does not code for three enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). The failure of M. flagellatus to produce these three enzymes (dehydrogenases) means that it can only rely on one-carbon compounds as carbon substrates for the production of precursor molecules, and for its energy needs. The ability to use only one-carbon substrates automatically makes M. flagellatus an obligate methylotroph. Overall characteristics of the M. flagellatus genome include 53.7% GC content and 143,032 base pairs that are direct repeats. Furthermore, there are approximately 2,766 coding regions, and only 233 open reading frames (ORFs) are unique to M. flagellatus. The genome also contains a CRISPR region, which is functionally linked to lateral gene transfer, host cell defense, replication, and regulation. Ecology A recent attempt at phylogeny classification of obligate methylotrophs puts the genus Methylobacillus along with Methylophilus and Methylovorus as terrestrial methylobacteria, while marine obligate methylotrophs are assigned to the genus Methylophaga.Doronina, Nina V.; Trotsenko, Yuri A.; Kolganova, Tatjana V., et al. “Methylobacillus pratensis sp. nov., a novel non-pigmented, aerobic, obligately methylotrophic bacterium isolated from meadow grass” International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology. 2004. Vol 54. No. not available. p. 1453-1457. Methylobacillus flagellatus KT strain was found in a metropolitan sewer system, whereas Methylobacillus pratensis were isolated from meadow grass. The important point is that the methylotrophs are very adaptable and they can be found in diverse ecosystems. As mentioned before, the importance of studying M. flagellatus and other closely related species of methylobacteria will help us better understand the recycling of carbon on Earth. More specifically a better understanding of how these methylotrophs affect the carbon cycle would undoubtedly help us shed light on the effects of methane gas on global warming. “Approximately 10^3 megatons of methane are produced globally each year by anaerobic micro-organisms.”Kiyoshi Tsuji, H. C. Tsien, R. S. Hanson, S. R. DePalma, R. Scholtz, S. LaRoche. “16s ribosomal RNA sequence analysis for determination of phylogenetic relationship among methylotrophs” Journal of General Microbiology. 1990. Vol 136. No. not available. p. 1-10. A subgroup of methylotrophs, the methanotrophs, oxidizes roughly %80-90 of the global methane. The significance of this fact cannot be overlooked, because without these methanotrophs the vast majority of atmospheric methane would not get degraded. The accumulation of methane gas would cause the Earth’s temperature to rise dramatically, because methane gas is far more efficient at absorbing infrared radiation than carbon-dioxide gas, and “may contribute more [than carbon dioxide] to global warming.” Pathology No known pathogenic quality of M. flagellatus has been discovered. Application to biotechnology Specific characteristics of M. flagellatus such as its high coefficient of conversion of oxidizers (methanol) to its own biomassMarchenko GN, Marchenko ND, Tsygankov YD, Chistoserdov AY. “Organization of threonine biosynthesis genes from the obligate methylotroph Methylobacillus flagellatus” Microbiology. 1999. Vol 145, No.11. p. 3273-3282. allows for practical applications such as inexpensive industrial productions of commercially needed compounds. These compounds can range from heterologous proteins and amino- acids to vitamins. Some methylotrophs within the genus of Methylobacillus can even use organic compounds such as the pesticide carbofuran and choline as carbon raw materials; they use these carbon sources to fulfill their energy and carbon requirements. As early as the late 1980s researchers had known that some methylotrophs possess enzymes such as dichloromethane dehalogenase, or methane monooxygenase (MMO), which degrade various environmental pollutants (i.e.: alkanes, alkenes, and mono- and poly-substituted aromatic compounds). Another common environmental pollutant that results from industrial processes is formaldehyde. Recently, a company called BIP Ltd has been cultivating a pink-pigmented methylotroph, strain BIP, for the specific purpose of remediating formaldehyde-contaminated industrial wastes.Chongcharoen R, Smith TJ, Flint KP, Dalton H. “Adaptation and acclimatization to formaldehyde in methylotrophs capable of high-concentration formaldedyde detoxification” Microbiology. 2005. Vol 151. No. not available. p.2615-2622. Since there are not a lot of published researches on M. flagellatus in particular, hence, there are not a lot of data available about this organism on the topic of application to biotechnology. We can still look at M. flagellatus’ close relatives, the methanotrophs, to help us better understand the genus Methylobacillus. Methanotrophs are a subset of a physiological group of methylotrophs, and its sole assimilatory/dissmilatory carbon source is methane. Methanotrophs also possess MMO, it is known that this enzyme has a broad substrate specificity and it can catalyzes the oxidation of a wide variety of water pollutants, such as trichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, and other halogenated hydrocarbons. MMO’s primary role is to convert methane to methanol, and any methyltrophs that can synthesize MMO are most likely classified as methanotrophs. Current research Genomic analysis M. flagellatus is closely related to members of the family Methylophilaceae. Most of its genes are dedicated to its methylotrophy functions (i.e.: breaking down one-carbon compounds), and these genes are present in more than one identical or non-identical copy. M. flagellatus is an obligate methylotroph; this is the direct consequence of an incomplete set of genes that cannot encode 3 critical enzymes (dehydrogenases) of the TCA cycle. Its genome does not code for any secondary metabolite synthesis pathways such as antibiotic biosynthesis, and no known xenobiotic degradation pathways are encoded. The absence of these self-defense mechanisms may help explain why M. flagellatus has no pathogenic qualities. Population survey/detection methods In June 2006 Kalyuzhaya et al. published a paper (“Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization-Flow Cytometry- Cell Sorting-Based Method for Separation and Enrichment of Type I and Type II Methanotroph Populations”) detailing more precise methods for separating organisms of interests within a natural sample. Their experiment focused on separating Type I and Type II Methanotrophs using combined techniques of FISH/FC (fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry) and FACS (fluorescence-activated FC analysis and cell sorting). FISH/FC employs oligonucleotide attached to florescein, or Alexa for targeting 16S rRNA. The fluoresced microbe can then be subjected to analysis and cell sorting. The detection phase involves putting the detected sample to “functional gene analysis to indicate specific separation using 16S rRNA, pmoA (encoding a subunit of particulate methane monooxygenase), and fae (encoding formaldehyde activating enzyme) genes.”Kalyuzhnaya MG, Zabinsky R, Bowerman S, Baker DR, Lidstrom ME, Chistoserdova L. “Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization-Flow Cytometry-Cell Sorting-Based Method for Separation and Enrichment of Type I and Type II Methanotroph Populations” Applied and Environmental Microbiology. 2006. Vol 72, No. 6. p. 4293-4301. The data indicate that FISH/FC/FACS is a method that can “provide significant enrichment of microbial populations of interest from complex natural communities.” Lastly, Kalyuzhaya et al. tested the reliability of whole genome amplification (WGA) using limited numbers of sorted cells. They found that WGA would give more “specific” results if a rough threshold number of 10^4 or more cells are in a sample. Having proven FISH/FC/FACS’ effectiveness to detect microbial populations, Kalyuzhay et al. used mixed samples of M. flagellatus along with other members of the methylotrophs genus to test their method’s effectiveness. Metabolism In “Analysis of two formaldehyde oxidation pathways in Methylobacillus flagellatus KT strain, a ribulose monophosphate cycle methylotroph” Chistoserdova et al. studied different pathways of formaldehyde oxidation in M. flagellatus KT strain to asset the importance of these pathways relating to dissimilatory metabolism, and, or formaldehyde detoxification. Based on null mutant experiments of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gnd) (a key enzyme of the cyclic oxidation pathway), and methenyl H4MPT cyclohydrolase (CH) (participating in the direct oxidation of formaldehyde via H4MPT derivatives), Chistoserdova et al. have found that Gnd null mutants were not obtained, but CH null mutants were obtained. The experimental result suggests “that this pathway [cyclic oxidation] is essential for growth on methylotrophic substrates”,Chistoserdova L, Gomelsky L, Vorholt JA, Gomelsky M, Tsygankov YD, Lidstrom ME. “Analysis of two formaldehyde oxidation pathways in Methylobacillus flagellatus KT, a ribulose monophosphate cycle methylotroph” Microbiology. 2000. Vol 146. No. 1. p. 233-238. and that linear oxidation of formaldehyde via H4MPT derivatives is not required for growth. More specifically, “results confirm previous suggestions that the cyclic formaldehyde oxidation pathway plays a crucial role in C1 metabolism of M. flagellatus KT strain, most probably as the major energy-generating pathway.” Metabolic comparisons between M. flagellatus (beta-proteobacteria) and Methylobacterium extorquens (alpha-proteobacteria) indicated that these species utilize the linear oxidation pathway via H4MPT linked derivatives differently. M. flagellatus “mutants defective in this (linear oxidation) pathway were more sensitive to formaldehyde than wild-type for cells grown on solid media but not in shaken liquid cultures.” The result provided clues that this pathway may serve to protect the M. flagellatus from excess formaldehyde, whereas Methylobacterium extorquens uses this pathway as its “main energy- generating pathway for methylotrophic growth.” References Further reading * Baev M V, Chistoserdova L V, Polanuer B M, et al. “Effect of formaldehyde on growth of obligate methylotroph Methylobacillus flagellatum in a substrate non-limited continuous culture” Archives of Microbiology. 1992.

The narrative follows the O'Sullivan twins, Patricia and Isabel, and their adventures at exclusive boarding school St Clare's. The book introduces four new characters: Claudine, the French mistress' niece; Eileen, whose mother joins the school as matron; Pauline, a wannabe rich girl; and Angela, a rich and spoiled society girl. Plot summary When Pat and Isabel arrive at school, they are surprised to meet a new matron and her daughter, Eileen. Then, French teacher Mam'zelle introduces Claudine, her niece, who will be joining them for this term. Alison O'Sullivan, the twins' rather silly, 'feather-headed' cousin, meets and befriends Angela, who is rich, beautiful and well dressed. Soon, Alison is completely under the spoilt, snobbish Angela's spell. The new Matron's daughter Eileen is a reserved girl who is later identified as a sneak. Pauline is soon discovered to be a snobbish and conceited girl who continuously brags about her family's 'wealth'. During the inevitable midnight feast the girls find themselves in trouble when Matron is spitefully locked for hours in a broom cupboard by Claudine while they were having the feast. She is furious to find that she is released by her daughter, and thinks that she was with the other girls, while actually she was speaking with her brother Eddie, who lost his job but doesn't dare to tell his mother. Eileen is in trouble. Pauline suffers a worse fate than Eileen when her mother visits unexpectedly and is happened upon by Alison and Angela, who mistake the poor, worn-out woman for one of the cooks. Pauline, like Eileen, is exposed as working class. Angela is scornful to discover that all Pauline's boasts of wealth are lies, and that she is ashamed of her lower-class background. The more compassionate Alison, however, takes pity on Pauline's mother, and to her credit, stands up to Angela's snobbish and domineering attitude, vowing not to fall under her thrall in the future. Alison also makes this action because of the awful behaviour of Angela's mother at half-term. Even she felt that though beautiful, Angela's mother was horrible and Alison was also secretly pleased when the brave and mischievous Claudine fell into the water from a balcony so that Angela's mother gets wet, even though Claudine hates the water. Near the end of the book Matron reveals that someone is stealing food, money and even stamps from her. It is written that Eileen stole the things in order to feed Eddie and apply for a new job. When Eddie does get employed, Eileen and Eddie go to Miss Theobald to confess about the stealing, for they heard that Pauline had been accused of this even though she had been taking money from her mother's bank account (In a short section also Claudine is suspected for stealing, for she suddenly has a lot of money and buys expensive birthday presents, but it turns out that she sold her lovely cushion cover that Mam'zelle showed to everyone at half term to Alison's mother.) Miss Theobald sends Eileen and Eddie into her other room next door, and calls for Matron. She tells her that she knows who stole from her, and asks Matron whether the girl should be expelled or not, since it was Matron who had been stolen from. The unkind Matron insists that the girl should be expelled, and is then lead to Eileen and Eddie. Matron cannot believe her eyes, and then sees the trap she fell into. She leaves St. Clare's at the end of the year with her children, but Eileen sends a last letter to Alison thanking her for inviting her to eat together at half-term. Themes and morality As is typical in Blyton's boarding school novels, class lines are drawn sharply. St Clare's is an upper-class domain, and its pupils are from upper class (if not always fabulously wealthy) backgrounds. With wealth, however, comes responsibility - the girls are expected to treat any lower-class people with the respect that goes with their own privileged positions. Lower class girls are seen to try to fit into St Clare's by deception, but their class lies are unmasked, to their great shame. Being lower class is not considered intrinsically bad, but lower class girls are expected to know their place in society and are not able to fit into the St Clare's milieu. Eileen, for example, is the daughter of Matron, and has a brother with a working-class name - Eddie - who gets into trouble. All these things are marks of a lower class girl. This book shows a moral - Never judge others or yourself from the amount of wealth you have, or family background; always see one for the person they are.

Academic pursuits Sukhdeo was born in Nadi, Fiji. After completing his primary at St. Andrews Government School and secondary education at Shri Vivekananda High Scholl in Nadi, Fiji, he went to India and studied at Elphinstone College, Bombay where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) degree in History/Politics (1964). At the college, he was elected the general secretary of the Overseas Students Union (1962) and subsequently the Joint Secretary of the Student Union and contributed to its literary organ, the \\"Elphinstonian\\". In 1965, he received the Bachelor of Education, Delhi University and Master of Arts in politics from Bombay University. He was regarded as the first Fiji student to have obtained a master's degree in Politics. He also studied Sociology and Journalism. He had his initial training as a journalist with The Times of India (1967). In 1966, he was elected to the University Students' Council and was the editor of \\"The University Journal\\"(1967/68). A scholarly article, India that is... critically analysed the socio-political psyche of emergent India after two decades of independence. He wrote a few literary poems. One, entitled 'FACADE' was published in the 'Student Journalist' (1965), a laboratory publication of the Bombay College of Journalism and the other, 'Petals', was included in the University Journal (1967). Meeting Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India He met Nehru in Bombay in May 1963 when he was casually engaged as an information aide for the Government of India pavilion, showcasing the lavish 'Our Himalayas' exhibition. On Nehru's 80th birth anniversary, he wrote an extensive article, Face to face with Nehru in the 'Fiji Times (17 November 1969) and his photograph together with Nehru was published in Shanti Dut, a Hindi publication (19 November 1970) Contribution to Fiji's civil service (1968–1974) On his return to Fiji in 1968, he was courted by the then head of politics of the University of the South Pacific for a position of lecturer of politics, but on being called to take the appointment, the offer was abruptly turned down by the then vice-chancellor of the University of the South Pacific, Dr. Colin C Aikman. This ended his aspiration to be the first Fiji academic for that position. It was assumed by many at the time that the vice-chancellor did not favour an Indian for this sensitive position, as his academic utterances could impact on Fiji's politics. Sukhdeo then opted to be employed as a Divisional Welfare Officer in Fiji's Department of Social Welfare. As the first Divisional Welfare Officer, Northern he successfully siphoned a number of social oriented functions of the District Administration such as the family assistance scheme, matrimonial reconciliation, youth schemes etc. into the new service and opened district welfare offices in Labasa and Savusavu. In 1970, he initiated the formation of the \\"Fiji Association of Welfare Officers\\" later renamed \\"Fiji Association of Social Workers\\" and edited its first journal, \\"The Welfare Forum\\" (December 1971). He was elected president of the association in November 1971. In his capacity as the president, he criticised the 1972 National Budget for failing to fully address the social paradigm. This earned him a formal warning from the Public Service Commission for criticising Government's economic policies. In 1972, he was the secretary and subsequently its interim chairman of the Suva District Council of Social Services. In the same year, he spent three months in Australia studying the Australian family system as a guest of the International Training Centre and in February 1974 he was called for an interview in Singapore and narrowly missed selection for the position of Regional Coordinator of the World Planned Parenthood Federation. A strong pressure for the Indonesian candidate and an impromptu negative remark on the Australian family planning scheme propelled the chairperson (an Australian) of the Selection Committee to negate Sukhdeo's bid. Suva City Council (1974–81): First phase In April 1974, prompted by Suva City Councillors of National Federation Party, Harilal M. Patel and Chandra P. Bidesi, he resigned from the Civil Service to take up an appointment as the Industrial Relations Officer/Fair Rents Officer, Suva for Suva City Council. His recruitment created a minor political flutter as the Alliance Councillor Joape Rokosoi stormed out of the meeting. Ironically, both of them became good friends till Rokosoi's untimely demise in 1996. During the intervening years, Sukhdeo was the informal link between Bidesi and Rokosoi who were on opposite political platforms. When Bidesi was nominated as a senator, he penned almost all his speeches. In early 1976, he initiated the formation of the Fiji Local Government Executive Officers Association to represent the interests of the senior executives. He drafted the constitution and at its first meeting on 9 February 1976, he was appointed its general secretary. The SCC Staff Association opposed the registration that resulted in its application for a separate trade union being declined. That ended the first attempt at uniting all local government executives under an official industrial umbrella. The position of industrial relations officer was later designated as the city personnel officer that reflected the depth of responsibility for more than 800 employees. In 1977, Suva City Council was dissolved after a damning report on its misadministration. A government nominee, William Cruikshank, was appointed its chief administrator. A number of senior executives were axed, but Sukhdeo worked closely with the chief administrator to reorganise the workforce and transfer personnel when the council's electricity operations were taken over by the Fiji Electricity Authority. In 1978, the administrators appointed him the assistant town clerk. With the return of the elected councillors, he was appointed the city's deputy town clerk in August 1979. In December he acted as the town clerk/chief executive officer. He was clearly being groomed for the town clerk/CEO's position when in August 1981 his tenure was abruptly terminated by the then lord mayor of Suva on account of writing a feature article, \\"Vatuwaqa Cemetery Access Road...how it all happened\\") that did not record his name in the Fiji Sun supplement (\\"The Fiji Sun\\" 18/08/81). India- Fiji Friendship Society (1974–81) Parallel to his first phase of career in Suva City Council, Sukhdeo was instrumental in the formation of India-Fiji Friendship Society in association with Councillor Isireli Vuibau, the then Lord Mayor of Suva and the Indian high commissioner to Fiji, Bhagwan Singh. He drafted the first constitution of the then titled Asia-Fiji Friendship Society that was adopted at its first meeting. In the subsequent meeting, the new name was adopted. Since its inception in 1974, he remained the society's secretary till the early 1980s when a new set of office bearers were elected. It was during this (1974–1981) period, the society organised the reception for the Indian Navy ship, provided platform for several Indian dignitaries and supported the engagement of some 700 Indian nationals as professionals in almost all facets of Fiji's development. Research fellow/lecturer: University of the South Pacific (1982–83) In 1982, he was appointed a research fellow conjointly with his engagement as the lecturer-in-charge of “Social Policy and Administration” at the University of the South Pacific. Under the aegis of Dr. Benjamin Higgins, head of the Centre for Applied Studies in Development, he completed several research projects, principal one being a six-month study of Suva, its developmental potential and constraints as part of the United Nations’ inter-country project on the “Role of Small Towns and Medium Cities”. During this period, he wrote the University of the South Pacific's lead paper “Urbanisation – An Inevitable Development” for discussion at the 22nd South Pacific Conference in Pagopago, American Samoa (23–29 October 1981). Sukhdeo was also a consultant for the Commonwealth Youth Programme and a Resource Person for several high level seminar/workshops at the USP’ chiefly the “Local Level Planning” Seminar at the Institute of Social and Administrative Studies; Regional Training Course on “Environmental Management for Resource Development (funded by CFTC) and a Workshop on “The Use of Technical Consultants in Technology Decision Making in the Public Sector”. During 1983, he wrote an extensive survey of the “Economic and Social Policy responses of the Pacific Island Nations to the International Development Strategy, 1983 and completed writing Country Papers on “Economic and Social Developments” for Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Nauru, Solomon Islands, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Niue, Tonga and Fiji. National Union of Municipal Workers (1983–1989): First phase Whilst still engaged at the University of the South Pacific, several senior executives of the union (Akapusi Tui, Haffizud Dean and others) approached Sukhdeo to stand for the general secretary's position to replace the incumbent who was reportedly weak and ineffective. At the AGM held in Jubilee Hall, Suva on 26 March 1983, he comfortably won the election on the promise of forfeiting his pay of $3000 in favour of a welfare fund for the workers and removing discriminatory structures affecting municipal workers (The Fiji Times, 28/03/83). From 1983 to 1989, Sukhdeo was the voice of the union and under his leadership, branches were established in Nausori, Lami and Labasa; industrial agreements were fortified; job evaluation affecting the Suva municipal employees was implemented; several cases were taken up as industrial disputes and the union provided a viable support for social campaigns and the formation of the Fiji Labour Party. After the 1987 Coup, he spent considerable time to ensure that the municipal employees were minimally affected by the cost-cutting measures. During 1984/85, there was a strong bid by councillors all over Fiji asking the Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs to implement the 1982 report on \\"Remuneration and Allowances for Councillors\\". Sukhdeo was opposed to any substantial remuneration to councillors, as he viewed councillors' role as that of selfless service at the local level. He wrote a letter directed at the Minister resulting in the Minister diffusing any bid for remuneration for councillors. Noting that the management board of the Fiji Trades Union Congress was heavily tilted in favour of large white collar union leaders and almost all external seminars/conferences were being earmarked for the board members, Sukhdeo steered the union away from the ICFTU affiliated congress activities towards affiliation with the Russian backed World Federation of Trade Unions and its affiliates. The first such affiliation was with the Public Service Trade Union International of Public and Allied Employees with its headquarters in East Berlin. In 1985, Sukhdeo was invited to a Regional Trade Union Conference in New Delhi where he spoke of the glaring anomalies both within the public service personnel as well as comparative matrix outside the public service. In 1986, he accepted a direct invitation from the general secretary of the World Federation of Labour to attend its XI World Trade Union Congress at Berlin from 16 to 22 September. Another Fiji attendee was his trade union and political colleague Krishna Datt, a nominee of Fiji Teachers Union. The Fiji Trades Union Congress did not wish to be officially associated with the visit although the invitation was sent to them. At the time, Sukhdeo was a vice- president and Krishna Datt the general secretary of the newly formed Fiji Labour Party. On the way to Moscow, both of them were given new passports by the Russian embassy in Singapore. In Moscow, both of them had informal discussions with the WFTU officials and in Berlin WFTU Conference were accorded front line seats. On their return to Fiji in early October, Krishna Datt was the first to break the informal pact that their whereabouts will remain confidential. Later in the 1987 General Elections, their Moscow visit generated keen media attention as both of them traded innuendoes regarding the visit. In 1988, he was again invited by the general secretary of TUI of Public and Allied Unions, Jochen Meinel to attend the VIII International Trades Congress of Public Employees in Sofia, Bulgaria. Board of trustees: the Fiji Museum: (1978–1981) As a nominee of Suva City Council, Sukhdeo was a member of the board of trustees of Fiji Museum for three years. During this time, the importance of Lapita relics found at the Sigatoka Sand Dunes was a subject of Board's deliberations. Sukhdeo and Kamikamica (later to become the prime minister of Fiji) spearheaded the move to provide protection for such heritage sites. Sigatoka Sand Dunes were then brought under the heritage protection of the Fiji National Trust Act. Birth of Fiji Labour Party: (1982–1985) Between 1982 and 1985, people of Fiji were getting disenchanted with the political impotency of the National Federation Party and the right wing policies of the Alliance Party. Soon after 1982 elections, during the prolonged teachers’ strike in 1983, Sukhdeo was called in by the combined FTA/FTU team to galvanise the teachers and supporters. In a spirited impromptu speech at the FTA Hall, he lashed out at the anti-worker policies of the Government and the then Minister for Education, Dr Ahmed Ali. This strike was followed by a hunger strike by the young graduates who were deprived of guaranteed employment. In a speech in front of the hunger strikers and their aides, he once again criticised the Government's inability to prioritise its economic policies towards the weaker sections of the community. The imposition of wage freeze in November 1984 provided the fodder for the unionists to unite across sectoral trade union and political interests and galvanise the rank and file workers against the measure. Following massive support given to the public rallies in Suva, Lautoka and Labasa and after much discussion within the Fiji Trades Union Congress, about forming a Labour Party, it was Sukhdeo, who at an executive committee meeting of the Congress on 15 December 1984 moved a motion that Fiji Labour Party be launched. After the formation of the party, he outlined his vision for the platform of the new party as follows: :\\"a strong anti-corruption bill, tougher immigration laws, improvements for rural people, increased social welfare projects, an overhaul of all labour legislation, job creation programs, greater encouragement of local production and import substitution, a non-aligned foreign policy,, and support for a nuclear free Pacific as well as for independence movements in New Caledonia and French Polynesia.\\" He was elected a vice-president of the party and the Secretary of the Nasinu/Vunidawa branch. In 1985 he was elected to the Suva City Council. Suva City Council Elections: November 1985 He was asked by the party general secretary to prepare the strategies, formulate policies and provide leadership for the Suva City Council elections in November 1985. Initial press reports and Party pamphlets showed that Sukhdeo was providing the lead for the party candidates, particularly in the Samabula ward. It was just before the elections that a Labour candidate, Michael Dutta withdrew as he was migrating to Australia. This provided the opportunity for Bob Kumar to seek management board's approval for his Samabula candidacy. The party immersed itself into an electioneering mode at ground level and received wholesome support in Samabula and Muanikau Wards. The Labour candidates thrashed National Federation Party and Alliance candidates in Samabula Ward, once regarded as a blue ribbon constituency for the National Federation Party. It was the first nail in the National Federation Party's coffin. Sukhdeo was well groomed to take the helm of the council, but the party bypassed him in favour of Bob Kumar, the Party Treasurer a late comer to Suva City Council electioneering. Sukhdeo was then elected as the party whip and chairman of the sensitive Tender Committee. Not long after, Sukhdeo was the centre of media attention when he opposed a Suva City Council resolution to lease part of the Flagstaf Park to an Australian Company and in the process accused some councillors of involvement in the matter. The media blew his statements to smack of corruption on the part of two unnamed councillors. Sukhdeo was referred for investigation of his allegations by the Council to the Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs. On an investigation report by a senior Detective, the Minister, Hon. E. J. Beddoes ruled that there was no case to answer. The TV saga resulted in a formal split amongst the Fiji Labour Party councillors as a section led by Bob Kumar was seen to be in cahoots with a few dissident Alliance councillors. 1987 general elections In early 1986, Sukhdeo organised one of the largest party rallies in Nasinu attended by some 500 followed by another rally in Narere where the branch was formed and he was elected secretary of the Nasinu/Vunidawa branch. He provided logistical support to the party candidates for the Labasa Town Council elections and was active in electioneering for the party candidates for the Ba Town Council elections. At the formation of the Nadi Branch, he, being a Nadi born official, was called alongside Dr Bavadra, Choudhry and Krishna Datt at the Nair's Dias to speak at its inauguration. His relationship with the leadership of the party soured after talks began with the National Federation Party for the formation of a coalition to contest the 1987 election. He publicly opposed any idea of a coalition. On 22 December 1986 he resigned in protest from the party and later defected to the Alliance Party. In the following weeks, he elaborated on his disenchantment with the Labour Party: “My reasons for leaving the Labour Party are self-evident. The Party has lost its credibility, because it constantly deviated from its principles and promises. The Party leadership has made several unpardonable lapses and its primary aim is to secure safe seats for four to five staff union leaders. It is unfortunate that there is not a single representation of blue collar workers. The labour party is not the beginning but the end of the road for a united labour movement in Fiji” (Fiji Sun 29 December 1986) And predicted “... that the coalition, win or lose, would soon break up after internal fighting” and he “warned of the possibility of violent reactions here in Fiji if Fiji citizens living overseas were allowed to vote” (in Fiji's elections) (Fiji Sun 8 January 1986) “On the Labour Party’s credibility, firstly the Party stated that it will not have any track with an organised group; it went ahead and had talks with the National Federation Party Youth Group. Then it indicated that no parliamentarians will be taken in, it went ahead and recruited three “political refugees”, namely Dr Satendra Nandan, Jai Raj Singh and Davendra Singh. Inter alia, the party hurled abuses at the National Federation Party as a sectarian party full of ostentatious lawyers and party bourgeoisie; it went ahead into an unholy coalition with the same National Federation Party. Subsequently, the party fostered the view that the National Federation Party will be embraced under the umbrella of the Fiji Labour Party. It ended up becoming a junior partner of a communal party with the sole aim of toppling the Government rather than disseminating the egalitarian labour philosophy. The party labelled itself as a representative movement. Yet those union leaders who have selected themselves as candidates belong to the white collar unions only. Such callous inconsistencies within such a shot life span of a multi-racial party are inexcusable. Deny these Mr. Datt?” (Fiji Sun 12 January 1987) And quite ominously, he declared that “...the unholy alliance of National Federation Party and Fiji Labour Party was sowing seeds of instability in Fiji” (Fiji Sun 29 January 1987) For the 1987 general election, the Alliance Party chose him as a candidate for the Nasinu/Vunidawa Indian Communal Constituency which the party had no chance of winning. He issued a personal leaflet, “Fiji Labour Party and I” (Fiji Archives doc.) outlining a raft of policy contradictions and false promises to the voters. In particular, he predicted that “Race relations is likely to deteriorate in Fiji with the emergence of a Coalition – a marriage of convenience – consisting of racial extremists, business opportunists, political refugees and white collar unionists..” and he concluded that “Any disturbance of race relations i n Fiji is likely to harm more the Indians than any other race in Fiji.” During the campaign, he accused Krishna Datt (of the Fiji Labour Party) of asking the Russians for help.[2] The military coup a month after the election ended his national political career. Deputy Lord Mayor of Suva: (1988–1989) However, he remained a councillor in Suva City Council and in November 1987 Sukhdeo was elected Deputy Lord Mayor and in June 1988, he was the Acting Lord Mayor of Suva. In this capacity, on 22 June he officially opened the paved bus bays at the Suva Bus Station. In August 1988, he was invited as a Guest of the Fifth South Pacific Arts Festival, Townsville, Australia in recognition of Suva being the host of the First South Pacific Arts Festival. A large Fiji contingent participated in the Festival that was opened by the then prime minister of Australia, Bob Hawke, on 14 September. During his visit, he met with the mayor of Townsville, Alderman Mike Raynolds and his key officials (18 September) with a view to forming a sister city relations between Suva and Townsville. On 20 September he was invited as a unionist to speak at the combined group of Federal Municipal and Shire Council Employees Union and Municipal Officers’ Association in regard to the post coup political situation in Fiji. On 21 September he was at the World Expo in Brisbane. Later he met with the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Sallyanne Atkinson. Although the council was dissolved in November 1988 on expiry of its three-year elected life, he remained a councillor as a nominee of the Minister of Housing and Urban Development, Tomasi Vakatora. In November 1988, he along with Councillor Navin Chandra, played an active role in the election of the mayoral candidate. In April 1989 he resigned as a councillor to take up the substantive position of the operations manager once again with Suva City Council. KMU Conference, Manila, Philippines (22 April – 2 May 1989) On his way to India to consecrate his late father's ashes in the Ganges, Sukhdeo and his wife, Malti Sukhdeo, a teachers’ unionist, attended the KMU Trade Union Solidarity Conference in Manila. Their week-long visit to familiarise with the minimal working conditions of workers in various parts of Philippines coincided with the Labour Day solidarity march in downtown Manila. Thousands of workers had gathered at the protest rally that was addressed by prominent trade unionists. A heavy military/police presence was noticeable. As the rally progressed towards the American Embassy, the military opened tear gas fire and water cannon shooting at the gathering including Sukhdeo and his wife. In the stampede, both of them along with other delegates ran out of the military/police range and took shelter in buildings around the grounds. It was a harrowing experience for all the delegates that left an indelible imprint on their minds. Operations Manager, Suva City Council (1989–1996) As a condition of employment imposed upon him, Sukhdeo resigned from the position of general secretary of the union in April 1989. The highlights of his career during this period included the pioneering work in producing/mounting a visual/textual exhibition, “Suva- Showcase of the Pacific” that was displayed for the public at Civic Hall, Melbourne during “Cities and Towns of Asia- Pacific” Conference. The exhibition was later displayed at Suva Civic Centre during the 1995 Tourism Convention for which it received the Air New Zealand Fiji Tourism Award of Excellence. In the same year, Sukhdeo received the Government of Fiji “Letter of Appreciation” for contribution towards the official visit of the United Nation’ Secretary General, Mr Boutros Boutros- Ghali to Fiji. In 1996, he received similar accolades for the State Visit of HRH Princess Sirindorh of Thailand and for his singular contribution towards the United Nations’ 50th Anniversary Celebrations in Suva. It was Sukhdeo who proposed and on his recommendation the Suva City Council approved that the adjoining park between Municipal Library and Old Town Hall be named “United Nations Park”. Sukhdeo is also credited for writing a management report on the feasibility of incorporating “Giant Waterslide” for the Suva Olympic Pool; giving support for the food kiosk project for Fijian women at the Suva Municipal Market and submitting a detailed marketing report for the Civic Tower project. In July 1996 he resigned from Suva City Council. Member: Hotel and Catering Wages Council (1989–1994) Sukhdeo served as a member of the Hotel and Catering Wages Council for almost five years when minimum wage bands and service conditions were established. In 1995, he was awarded the 25 Anniversary Independence Medal by the president for his meritorious service to Fiji National Union of Municipal Worker (August 1996 – December 1999) Second Phase From 1989, when Sukhdeo left the union till early 1996, the union was without a strong steward and the regional and racial factions within the union catapulted into separate union entities. The Municipal Employees Credit Union that Sukhdeo had established had broken its umbilical cord; the branches in the west had formed their own trade union and a separate trade union was registered in Suva. Jale Toki, the general secretary of the SCC Staff Association that was perpetually at loggerheads with the National Union of Municipal Workers had forced his way into the union as its organising secretary. A series of meetings with Sukhdeo by a group of concerned executive members led to his reappointment as the general secretary and revocation of Jale Toki's appointment as the organising secretary. His attempt to reunite the members from the Western Division failed as the separate union was now entrenched under the shadow of the Fiji Local Government Officers Association. Sukhdeo re-established links with the Trade Union International of Public Employees, now led by Sukomal Sen with its headquarters in India. In 1998, he attended the IX TUI Congress in Calcutta, India. In December 1999, prior to his emigration to New Zealand, he resigned from the general secretary's position and invited Pramod Rae to be the Organising Secretary of the union. In March 2000, he returned to Fiji to steer the union's annual general meeting in Suva that formally appointed Pramod Rae as its general secretary. President, Fiji Society for the Intellectually Handicapped (1988/89) In September 1988 Sukhdeo was elected the president of the Suva Society for the Intellectually Handicapped. His involvement began when his son, Devneel Sukhdeo joined the school in 1986 after it was ascertained that he could not progress through the normal school curriculum. The school's administration was disorganised and its finances remained unaudited for a number of years. Sukhdeo was asked to take the lead to streamline the management of the society. His engagement was discontinued in 1989. It was his son's rehabilitation that prompted the family to migrate to New Zealand in December 1999 Centre Manager: Adult Education Centre, South Auckland Branch, Auckland, New Zealand (2000/2001) The centre catered for adult students in pursuit of New Zealand Qualifications Authority's accredited units for Computing, Business Administration, Communication and Customer Service. On account of liquidation of the company, Sukhdeo left and since 2003 he is with the Skycity Entertainment Group, Auckland in a supervisory role in its support operations.

She returned to Iceland, marrying the young pastor Hallgrímur Pétursson, who became known for his poetry and hymns. Life Guðríður was the young wife of a fisherman and a mother. After her abduction in 1627 from the Westman Islands, she was sold by the pirates as a slave and concubine in Algeria. She was among the few who were ransomed nearly a decade later by King Christian IV of Denmark, and she returned to Iceland.

The fantasy draft was subsequently lost, possibly by one of the publishers.  Universe Description  The story of the first two novels takes place in the 1990s, while this storyline moves on to 2130s. The following description applies to the first two novels. Our galaxy contains a huge number of worlds inhabited by sentient beings. For most civilizations, interstellar travel, including FTL travel, is routine part of life. As civilizations are constantly in contact with one another, their levels of technological development are roughly the same. There are, of course, more primitive worlds, whose people are unable to leave their system, and who do not even suspect that the galaxy is full of life. Earth is one such planet.  Seeders and Temples  All known civilizations are humanoid. Most of them are indistinguishable from earthlings, while others differ slightly (for example, they might have grey skin or can bear extremely cold or hot temperatures) but still very similar. The reason for the appearance of so many humanoid civilizations is known - a long time ago, mysterious beings only known as the Seeders \\"seeded\\" the Earth-like planets of the galaxy with life. After that, they disappeared without a trace. The study of what remains of their culture shows that their level of development was much higher than the current galactic standard. Specifically, they were able to travel through time. It is believed that the Seeders were at war with someone, but no one knows who were their enemies. On almost all planets, the Seeders are deified. On every inhabited world, except Earth, the Seeders left a Temple. The Temple resembles a large sphere standing on a thin (4 inches in diameter) support leg, which ends in an ornament in the form of a hand, as if the hand is holding the sphere. The surface of the sphere is divided in black and mirror-like squares, alternating without any visible pattern; however, the design of the squares is identical on all Temples. It is physically impossible to destroy a Temple. After a civilization reaches a certain level of technological development, its Temple allows the supreme ruler of that world inside it and can grant his or her wishes. Besides its other qualities, a Temple reveals the galactic coordinates of all planets with Temples. Therefore, any interstellar civilization can contact all others, excluding Earth. Earth does not have a Temple, and its coordinates are unknown. That is why Earth is often contemptuously called \\"the planet which doesn't exist.\\" Most believe that the Seeders, by not leaving a Temple on the planet, displayed their contempt for Earth. One religious sect even believes that the Seeders consider Earth to be their enemy; as such, the sect believes that Earth must be destroyed. Fortunately, the same lack of coordinates prevents the planet's destruction. However, there have been rumors of people reaching Earth by making a blind jump.  Technological Inventions  Most of these technologies have been reverse-engineered from recovered Seeder artifacts.  Hypertunnels  Besides interstellar flights (both FTL and sublight), another method of travel is through hypertunnels. This does not require the traveller to know the hyperspace coordinates of the target world (how it works is never fully explained). As such, extraterrestrials can get to Earth (for example, Palian vampires have visited Earth numerous times in the past to feed). However, such method of transportation lacks commercial or military value, as physical laws prohibit any mass greater than 80 metric ton to be moved through a hypertunnel. Also, no weapon capable of destroying a planet can be successfully transported. For example, a quark bomb (description below) becomes inert after rematerialization.  Neutralization fields  Blocks all weapons except for bladed ones. Even reactions such as nuclear fission, fusion, and matter/anti-matter annihilation are blocked. The area of effect is limited - a single spaceship can be protected (although protecting large ships is extremely costly), an area of several miles around a royal palace, a restaurant territory, etc. Due to the invention of neutralization fields, bladed weapons have returned to their important role on the battlefield. The battles are now reminiscent of medieval knights fighting.  Monatomic swords  The monatomic sword (called by the protagonist \\"the plane sword\\") is an ideal melee weapon. Its blade is one atom thick. Due to such sharp blade, the sword can cut through any known material. Any strike or even a wave with the sword blunts the blade, making it thicker than one atom. The hilt contains a button that nearly instantly sharpens the sword back to its original thickness. However, this can be done only about 1500 times, after which the sword breaks down. When two swords collide, one of them slices through the other. This depends on the angle of collision and on the sharpness of each blade. The latter is what makes the sharpness button so important. When not in use, the sword is placed in a specially-designed scabbard which hold the sword using magnetic fields without actually touching it. A wound from a monatomic sword is nearly painless. These swords are extremely popular throughout the galaxy. They are developed and made on the planet Tar, which increased its weight in the galactic community.  Protective Suit  Partly protects the wearer from a monatomic sword. After a sword strike, it stretches over the wound and holds it in place. A wound of one atom thick heals in about 3 seconds (as long as the suit does not let it move). To neutralize the effect of the suit, the protagonist developed a \\"persistent sharpening\\" mode. When the sword is in the wound, the wielder keeps holding the sharpening button. The constant sharpening does not let the wound close and kills the opponent. In fact, the energy used to sharpen the blade burns the wound, making it a gaping hole. Another way to quickly kill an opponent is to stab him in the heart, as the constant motion of the heart prevents the healing process.  Plane Discs  An \\"improvement\\" of the monatomic swords invented by the protagonist. Made of a disc of thin steel, with monatomic blades glued to all sides (from broken monatomic swords). This disc can be thrown at an enemy; however, a professional fighter can dodge such a throw. Several different versions of the weapon have been invented. A discus-sized version can slice a person in half. There are also shuriken-like discs and small discs designed to be fired from an air-powered gun. The latter is designed with a shifted center of gravity (similar to a 5.45 x 39 mm M74 round) to literally shred the target's organs upon entering the body. Since the beginning of the public use of the discs, they have been criticized as a \\"coward's weapon\\", claiming that no combat should come down to a \\"shot from around the corner\\".  Antimatter  Anti-ship weapon. When it hits a ship's hull, the matter/anti-matter reaction causes a massive explosion. The only way to stop antimatter from reacting with the ship's hull is by engaging its neutralizing field. However, the ship is then unable to use any weapon. The only way to get rid of the anti-matter is to jettison the hull section with it. Antihelium is especially dangerous, as it tends to flow all around the hull, enveloping the ship. However, this same flowing property makes it simple to dispatch by heating up a single section of the hull (the antihelium will keep flowing over that section and be evaporated). Antisodium and antihelium are used by the protagonist in a decisive space battle. Apparently, antimatter is a Seeder weapon that has never been used before.  Quark Bomb  The size of a soccer ball, the quark bomb is capable of destroying an entire planet, initiating subatomic fission. The complete destruction of a planet takes several hours. There is no known defense from a quark bomb (see also Strangelet). The quark bomb explodes at the moment of construction at the factory. The rest of its existence is a slow process of quark fission, which turns the avalanche-like destruction of atoms into a slow, rhythmical, gradual destruction of 10 grams of copper dust - the best known explosive trigger. If the bomb is shot at, which destroys its mechanisms, then the unstoppable process of atomic fission begins at full strength. The only way to get rid of a quark bomb is to jettison it in deep space at least 3-4 light years from the nearest stellar body or nebula. Occasionally, quark fission can be transferred from one planet to another through tiny meteorites, dust particles, molecules of ionized gas, etc. The bomb was used only twice, before a galactic agreement was signed banning its use.  Gravity absorber  Spaceship equipment. Absorbs g-forces (for example, during takeoffs), then slowly \\"returns\\" them, creating a constant acceleration of 1.5g for a long period of time. Allows a ship to stop on a dime, even moving at relativistic speeds, but the crew then has to \\"repay\\" this with months, or even years, of 1.5g acceleration. Resembles a black sphere, which decreases in size as it absorbs g-forces. The more g-forces it absorbs, the smaller the sphere becomes. In extreme cases, the absorber can be ejected into space, then it will create a gravity field in surrounding space. However, this is highly extreme as such devices are very expensive; also, the ship loses its absorber.  Spiderweb Mine  A web of super-thin strings. Constricts and chokes it victim. Can also break the victim's neck, which is considered to be a more merciful death. Once the person is trapped by the mine, he or she is as good as dead.  Leyan Sweets  Amazingly tasty sweets. Much better than the very best Swiss chocolate. As such, it is considered a highly prized delicacy, which only the richest can afford.

It is in Biddulph parish and is a part of the Staffordshire Moorlands district in England. It is very similar to Mow Cop which is located on the other side of the valley of Biddulph. It is semi-rural and is the source of the River Trent. In Legend Legend has it, that the people of Biddulph Moor are descended from Saracen warriors captured during the Crusades. Geography The highest point is over 300 metres above sea level and it enjoys views over the Staffordshire and Cheshire plains and on a clear day the Welsh mountains are visible. The nearest railway station is Congleton which is 4 miles away. The nearest city is Stoke on Trent which is approximately 10 miles away. The source of the River Trent is a short walk down a public footpath that can be picked up at the end of Trentley Drive. Features The village has three churches, a first school, a post office, two local shops, a pharmacy and two pubs. Each Friday a mobile 'chippy van' used to serve fish and chips from about 4:30-6pm outside the local shops. This has been replaced by a fish and chip shop, which has now closed. The Rose and Crown serves homemade pies and often has live music with a number of Irish bands performing on a regular basis. Next to the local village hall there is a park where many different events such as fund-raising events are held. One of the more significant and popular of these is 'Rock on The Rocks', an outdoor music event held each summer. Just out of the village to the south is an unusual and attractive rocky outcrop, 'Rock End', with views to the southwest. The most common names on the Moor used to be Bailey, Nixon, and Brooks. The names Stanway and Pass are also very prevalent. It is believed that during the middle ages Saracen men populated the area to work in mining of coal. These were known locally as 'The Black Men Of Biddle' due to their very dark features. The Biddulph valley coal seam was very rich and mined up until the early 1980s. Bailey's hill and Robin hill are prominent features. Nearby Rushton Spencer has the ancient church of St Lawrence, which stands in the wilderness and has many fascinating stories associated.

Background The first mayor is recorded as Ralph Dery, who took up office in 1314. The role was then left unrecorded until 1401, when Roger Thomas held office. The mayor for municipal year 2012–13, Councillor John Guy, was the 380th recorded Mayor of Newport. One of the most famous mayors of Newport was the Chartist John Frost in 1836, who less than four years later was condemned to death for treason for his involvement in the Newport Rising (appointed mayor in 1838, Thomas Phillips was knighted for his efforts in quelling the Rising). Frost's sentence was later commuted to transportation for life to Australia. In 1856 John Frost was given a full pardon, returned to the UK and lived in Bristol. Several mayors have, over the years, held office for more than one term. Henry John Davis was mayor from 1851-1852, 1891-1892 (the first of the new County Borough) and 1901-1902, having served on the Borough Council continuously for 60 years. Mayoral responsibilities The position of mayor of Newport is now largely ceremonial, but it still has high- profile rôle in maintaining and promoting the interests of the city and its people. The Local Government Act 1972 states that as chairman of the City Council, the Mayor shall have precedence in the city over all but members of the Royal Family or the Lord Lieutenant, representing the Royal Family. One of the responsibilities of the current post holders is to choose a selection of charitable organisations they wish to support during their year in office. The Mayoral Chains of Office The Coat of arms of the City forms an integral part of the Mayoral Chains, of which there are two, one for the Mayor and one for the Mayoress. The Mayor’s chain consists of an original chain and detachable medallion depicting the shield surmounted by the cherub, which was the original Coat of Arms of the County Borough of Newport before the supporters were added. This original chain and medallion were presented to the Corporation for the use of Mayors of the Borough on the 9 November 1886 by Edwin James Grice, the then Mayor of Newport. Mounted on either side of the centre medallion are the medallions of the former Caerleon Urban District Council, and Magor and St Mellons Rural District Council. These two authorities were merged into Newport in 1974. Mayoral Car The Mayor and Mayoress have use of the Mayoral Car for all official engagements. The Mayoral Car has changed over the years, but always carries the number plate NDW 1, where '\\"DW\\" are the original registration letters for Newport Corporation. NDW 1 indicates the first registration in the N series of registrations; N in this instance presumably also indicating Newport. As of 2008 the Mayoral car is a 3.2-litre automatic Jaguar XJ8. Previous cars included a stretched Ford Granada. List of mayors of Newport The 'Newport Past' website provide a list of past mayors of Newport on their website, with records beginning in 1314.

It is located 5.7 miles (9.22 km) north of Charing Cross. The area is mainly residential and includes both Chestnuts and Downhills parks. Its area is roughly defined by Downhills Park in the North and Northeast, by Cornwall Road to the East, a line running between Cranleigh and Stanley Roads to the South, Harringay Road and Stanmore Road to the West and Northwest. History West Green developed as a small village in the Middle Ages with settlement first recorded in 1393. By the start of the seventeenth century, the eight buildings that then stood in West Green formed the only hamlet in the central area of the manor of Tottenham. Although it had not grown by 1800, by 1840 it contained 18 houses. This made it bigger than Wood Green at that time.Although within the parish and later borough of Tottenham, West Green has been identified as a separate village for hundreds of years - British History Online Development took off during the period after the 1860s, particularly after the arrival of the Tottenham & Hampstead Junction Railway in 1878.

Rhodolith beds create biogenic habitat for diverse benthic communities. The rhodolithic growth habit has been attained by a number of unrelated coralline red algae, organisms that deposit calcium carbonate within their cell walls to form hard structures or nodules that closely resemble beds of coral. Unlike coral, rhodoliths do not attach themselves to the rocky seabed. Rather, they roll like tumbleweeds along the seafloor until they become too large in size to be mobilised by the prevailing wave and current regime. They may then become incorporated into a semi-continuous algal mat. While corals are animals that are both autotrophic (photosynthesize via their symbionts) or heterotrophic (filter plankton from the water for food), rhodoliths produce energy solely through photosynthesis (i.e. they can only grow and survive in the shallow photic zone of the ocean). Common rhodolith species include Lithophyllum margaritae, Lithothamnion muellerii, and Neogoniolithon trichotomum. Scientists believe rhodoliths have been present in the world's oceans since at least the Eocene epoch, some 55 million years ago.Science Daily, September 23, 2004 Overview Rhodoliths (including maërl) have been defined as calcareous nodules composed of more than 50% of coralline red algal material and consisting of one to several coralline species growing together.Bosellini, A. and Ginsburg, R.N.

Globally, rhodoliths fill an important niche in the marine ecosystem, serving as a transition habitat between rocky areas and barren, sandy areas. Rhodoliths provide a stable and three-dimensional habitat onto which a wide variety of species can attach, including other algae, commercial species such as clams and scallops, and true corals. Living rhodolith beds are widely distributed throughout the Gulf of California, Mexico.source:Diana Steller, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories Rhodoliths are resilient to a variety of environmental disturbances, but can be severely impacted by harvesting of commercial species. Rhodoliths come in many shapes, including laminar, branching and columnar growth forms.Bosence, D.W. (1983) \\"Description and classification of rhodoliths (rhodoids, rhodolites)\\". In: Coated grains, pages 217-224, Springer, Berlin. . . In shallow water and high-energy environments, rhodoliths are typically mounded, thick or unbranched; branching is also rarer in deeper water, and most profuse in tropical, mid-depth waters. File:Rhodoliths on the northwestern shore of Fuerteventura.jpg|Rhodoliths on the northern shore of Fuerteventura File:Messinian rhodolith.JPG|A fossilised rhodolith from the Messinian of southern Spain  Geological significance  Rhodoliths are a common feature of modern and ancient carbonate shelves worldwide. Rhodolith communities contribute significantly to the global calcium carbonate budget, and fossil rhodoliths are commonly used to obtain paleoecologic and paleoclimatic information. Under the right circumstances, rhodoliths can be the main carbonate sediment producers, often forming rudstone or floatstone beds consisting of large pieces of rhodoliths in grainy matrix. Climate change and the rhodolith holobiont A view of rhodolith beds impacted by the warmer and more acidified oceans predicted by the IPPC.IPPC (2014) Climate change 2014 impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability, Part B. Rhodoliths are significant photosynthesizers, calcifiers, and ecosystem engineers, which raises an issue about how they might respond to ocean acidification. Changes in ocean carbonate chemistry driven by increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions promotes ocean acidification. Increasing the ocean carbon dioxide uptake results in increases in pCO2 (the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the ocean) as well as lower pH levels and a lower carbonate saturation in the seawater. These affect the calcification process.Millero, F.J., Graham, T.B., Huang, F., Bustos-Serrano, H. and Pierrot, D. (2006) \\"Dissociation constants of carbonic acid in seawater as a function of salinity and temperature\\". Marine Chemistry, 100(1–2): 80–94. . Organisms like rhodoliths accrete carbonate as part of their physical structure, since precipitating CaCO3 would be less efficient.Orr, J.C., Fabry, V.J., Aumont, O., Bopp, L., Doney, S.C., Feely, R.A., Gnanadesikan, A., Gruber, N., Ishida, A., Joos, F. and Key, R.M., 2005.

Global Change Biology, 15(8), pp.2089-2100. . Calcification rates in coralline algae are thought to be directly related to their photosynthetic rates, but it is not clear how a high-CO2 environment might affect rhodoliths.McCoy, S.J. and Kamenos, N.A., 2015.

Elevated CO2 levels might impair biomineralization due to decreased seawater carbonate () availability as pH falls, but photosynthesis could be promoted as the availability of bicarbonate () increases.Johnson, M.D., Price, N.N. and Smith, J.E., 2014. Contrasting effects of ocean acidification on tropical fleshy and calcareous algae. PeerJ, 2, p.e411. . This would result in a parabolic relationship between declining pH and coralline algal fitness, which could explain why varied responses to declining pH and elevated pCO2 have been recorded to date.Ries, J.B., Cohen, A.L. and McCorkle, D.C., 2009. Marine calcifiers exhibit mixed responses to CO2-induced ocean acidification. Geology, 37(12), pp.1131-1134. . Expected parabolic relationship between climate change stressors and rhodolith holobiont fitness. Under normal conditions healthy rhodoliths possess stable microbiomes, important to holobiont function. However, beyond the thresholds of algal physiological tolerance, disruption of positive host-microbiome interactions occurs, detrimentally affecting holobiont fitness.Cavalcanti, G.S., Shukla, P., Morris, M., Ribeiro, B., Foley, M., Doane, M.P., Thompson, C.C., Edwards, M.S., Dinsdale, E.A. and Thompson, F.L.

BMC Genomics, 19(1): 1–13. . 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The widespread distribution of rhodoliths hints at the resilience of this algal group, which have persisted as chief components of benthic marine communities through considerable environment changes over geologic times.Weiss A, Martindale RC (2017) \\"Crustose coralline algae increased framework and diversity on ancient coral reefs\\". PLoS One, 12: e0181637. . In 2018 the first metagenomic analysis of live rhodoliths was published. Whole genome shotgun sequencing was performed on a variety of rhodolith bed constituents. This revealed a stable live rhodolith microbiome thriving under elevated pCO2 conditions, with positive physiological responses such as increased photosynthetic activity and no calcium carbonate biomass loss over time. However, the seawater column and coralline skeleton biofilms showed significant microbial shifts. These findings reinforce the existence of a close host-microbe functional entity, where the metabolic crosstalk within the rhodolith as a holobiont could be exerting reciprocal influence over the associated microbiome. While the microbiome associated with live rhodoliths remained stable and resembled a healthy holobiont, the microbial community associated with the water column changed after exposure to elevated pCO2.

They can be tasked by the battalion or brigade commander to carry out tasks such as special reconnaissance, raids on enemy artillery positions, airfields, supply dumps and tactical headquarters or other special operations at a tactical level. They are also capable of directing artillery and air attacks on targets deep within enemy lines. Unit composition A Ghatak platoon is usually 20-men strong, consisting of a commanding Captain, 2 non-commissioned officers and some specialised soldiers like designated marksman, light machine gunners, medics and radio operators. The remaining soldiers act as assault troopers.http://defencenews.in/defence-news-internal.aspx?id=5LRDP7jQa5g= Training The most physically fit and motivated soldiers of all arms and services of the Indian Army either volunteer or are selected to be a part of the Ghatak platoon. Personnel attend training at the Commando Training Course in Belgaum, Karnataka. As a part of the training, the soldiers are evaluated through speed marches in battle gear ranging from 20 to 60 km, carrying their rifles and 20 kg of weight in their rucksacks. Depending on their role and parent unit, the successful individuals often undergo specialized training in demolition, close quarter battle, navigation, rock climbing and heliborne assault. Some operators are sent to the High Altitude Warfare School and the Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School as well. However, most of them are not parachute qualified. It is mandatory for all infantry officers to pass the Commando Training Course. Equipment Ghatak platoons are equipped with the IWI Tavor TAR-21, INSAS, or a version of the AK-47 as their primary assault rifle. The marksmen are equipped with the Dragunov SVD and Heckler & Koch MSG-90 designated marksman rifles. They wear standard issue camouflage and body armour. Depending on the mission, they may carry other items like ropes, climbing gear, grenades, rocket launchers, laser target designators and night vision equipment. Some of the equipment for them are manufactured indigenously by the Indian Ordnance Factories, while other items are obtained from foreign suppliers. Currently, the Indian Army is upgrading the equipment of these units by procuring lighter body armour, personal communication sets, anti- materiel rifles and various other mission specific equipment.. A deal worth $5.75 million was signed with M/S B&T; Switzerland for the acquisition of 1,568 advanced Brügger & Thomet MP9 sub-machine guns for the Ghatak platoons of infantry battalions. Additionally, door breaching ammunition and non-lethal systems like stun grenades and ballistic shields are being procured for counter-insurgency operations. Honours Gren.

Websites hosting quizzes include Quizilla, FunTrivia, OkCupid, Sporcle, and Quizlet. Blog quizzes Blog quizzes (also known as quiz blog) refer to a specific genre of quizzes which are conducted by the quizzers on blogs. Blog quizzes may be about verbs or a wide range of other topics. Educational quizzes Quiz is one of the most common eLearning patterns for many of the online course. Some companies and schools use online quizzes as a means to educate their employees or students respectively. Popular websites hosting quizzes for this purpose include Quizlet and Revision Quiz Maker. Practical applications Many online quizzes are set up to actually test knowledge or identify a person's attributes. Some companies use online quizzes as an efficient way of testing a potential hire's knowledge without that candidate needing to travel. Online dating services often use personality quizzes to find a match between similar members. Other Most online quizzes are to be taken lightly. The results do not often reflect the true personality or relationship. They are also rarely psychometrically valid.

Effective measures such as media communication between vehicles can be enabled as well methods to track automotive vehicles. InVANET is not foreseen to replace current mobile (cellular phone) communication standards. \\"Older\\" designs within the IEEE 802.11 scope may refer just to IEEE 802.11b/g. More recent designs refer to the latest issues of IEEE 802.11p (WAVE, draft status). Due to inherent lag times, only the latter one in the IEEE 802.11 scope is capable of coping with the typical dynamics of vehicle operation. Automotive vehicular information can be viewed on electronic maps using the Internet or specialized software. The advantage of WiFi based navigation system function is that it can effectively locate a vehicle which is inside big campuses like universities, airports, and tunnels. InVANET can be used as part of automotive electronics, which has to identify an optimally minimal path for navigation with minimal traffic intensity. The system can also be used as a city guide to locate and identify landmarks in a new city. Communication capabilities in vehicles are the basis of an envisioned InVANET or intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Vehicles are enabled to communicate among themselves (vehicle-to- vehicle, V2V) and via roadside access points (vehicle-to-roadside, V2R) also called as Road Side Units (RSUs). Vehicular communication is expected to contribute to safer and more efficient roads by providing timely information to drivers, and also to make travel more convenient. The integration of V2V and V2R communication is beneficial because V2R provides better service sparse networks and long distance communication, whereas V2V enables direct communication for small to medium distances/areas and at locations where roadside access points are not available. Providing vehicle–vehicle and vehicle–roadside communication can considerably improve traffic safety and comfort of driving and traveling. For communication in vehicular ad hoc networks, position-based routing has emerged as a promising candidate. For Internet access, Mobile IPv6 is a widely accepted solution to provide session continuity and reachability to the Internet for mobile nodes. While integrated solutions for usage of Mobile IPv6 in (non-vehicular) mobile ad hoc networks exist, a solution has been proposed that, built upon a Mobile IPv6 proxy-based architecture, selects the optimal communication mode (direct in-vehicle, vehicle–vehicle, and vehicle–roadside communication) and provides dynamic switching between vehicle–vehicle and vehicle–roadside communication mode during a communication session in case that more than one communication mode is simultaneously available.

Dvořák sent the score to be bound, but could not pay the binder, who kept the score. A friend of his, with whom he was sharing lodgings, Moric Anger, lent Dvořák the money to pay off the binder and retrieve his score. Later, when Anger asked for repayment of the debt, Dvořák was again unable to pay, so Anger took the score as security and only returned it when Dvořák retracted a previous threat to destroy it, something Anger had always advised against. In 1887 Dvořák revised the score, thinning out the rather dense orchestration. It had its world premiere, and its sole performance during the composer's lifetime in March 1888, under Adolf Čech (who also premiered the 5th and 6th symphonies). It was generally well received. Form The work is in four movements: Unusually, all of these movements begin with introductory material unrelated to the major theme. The introduction to the final movement contains a four note motif that Dvorák would quote some thirty-five years later in his opera Rusalka. Musicologist David R. Beveridge has concluded that this theme owes its origins to Dvorák's spurning by his pupil Josefina Cermakova, which occurred at approximately the time that Dvorák was writing this symphony and which the composer was prompted to recall by the plot of the opera. A typical performance of the work has a duration of about 50 minutes. Instrumentation The work is scored for two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, and strings.

The Tor is surmounted by the Church of St Michael, the parish church of the village of Brentor, which lies below the Tor. Geology Brent Tor is a unique example of an early Carboniferous basaltic volcano, now weathered down.Dartmoor National Park Authority, Educational Register of Geological Sites It is composed of volcanic breccia and pillow lava exuded beneath a former sea.Robert Hesketh, Devon's Geology, an introduction, page 8. Bossiney Books History Around the Tor are Iron Age earthworks, the remnants of a Hill fort. Unusually, the fortifications are at the base of the Tor, rather than the summit as is more normal (compare with Brent Knoll in Somerset). No serious archaeological work has been carried out on the site. However, the northern ramparts in particular are well preserved, displaying a multi-vallate pattern characteristic of the Iron-A, or early -B, culture. There are three distinct consecutive ramparts in this sector, and traces of internal partitioning. St Michael's Church, Brent Tor The Church of St Michel de Rupe (\\"Saint Michael of the Rock\\") atop the Tor dates to the 13th century, and measures wide and long. The tower is highBrentor Church: A Guide, Church of England publications and houses five bells.Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers At one point, the Church may have been used as a Beacon tower, used to spread word of enemies seen out to sea (see also Spanish Armada). It is also said that the church was to be built at the bottom of the tor, but the devil who didn't want to see its construction would move the construction to the top of the hill each night to stop its construction. Dissuaded by the devil, the locals continued with its construction in defiance. The Church has a capacity of approximately forty people. Although there is a newer (19th century) church (Christchurch) in the village, which is used for many services, St Michael's is still used on Christmas Day, Easter Day and for Evensong during the summer. In 1995 the Church was struck by lightning, which caused extensive damage, but this has since been repaired. Legends There are many legends surrounding Brent Tor. One of the best-known is that of the Merchant and the Storm.

Authorised under the Birmingham Canal Act 1768 which created the original Birmingham Canal, it was constructed in 1836-7 and opened on 4 November 1837.Hadfield, Page 89 It now runs from Titford Pool, a reservoir made in 1773-4 which now lies under, and to both sides of, an elevated section of the M5 motorway near the motorway's junction 2, to join the BCN Old Main Line at Oldbury Junction, also under the M5. Beyond Titford Pool was a continuation, abandoned in 1954, as the Portway Branch, which served coal mines in the Titford Valley. Also from Titford Pool was the Causeway Green Branch; opened in 1858 and abandoned, in parts, in 1954 and September 1960.Hadfield, Pages 318-319 Titford Pool At a height above sea level of 511 ft Titford Pool was one of the original water sources for the James Brindley 491 foot Smethwick Summit Level of his Birmingham Canal (later called the Old Main Line). Titford Pool is also the highest navigable canal in the Midlands, with only Rochdale Canal beating it at 600 feet above sea level.https://madeinoldbury.co.uk/articles/titford-canal/ This feeder was not made navigable until 1837, with the addition of six locks, nicknamed The Crow, which were adjacent to chemical works owned by Jim Crow. These locks, as is usual on the BCN, have single lower gates to reduce leakage. The Titford Locks (also known as Oldbury Locks) became derelict and were restored in 1973-4. The canal Between Titford Pool and the locks is the Grade II listed Langley Maltings (previously used for the malting stage of beer-making). Sadly the Maltings have been badly damaged by fire. At the top lock stands the grade II listed Titford Engine House; built to pump water back up the six locks from the Wolverhampton Level, but later more often used to supply the feeder.Hadfield, Page 264Broadbridge, Page 117 It is now the headquarters of the Birmingham Canal Navigations Society. Also at the top lock is the junction with the Tat Bank Branch (or Spon Lane Branch), no longer navigable, which was the original feeder to the Smethwick Summit, and is now a feeder (made by Thomas Telford, 1830) to Edgbaston Reservoir (Rotton Park Reservoir) which itself feeds the Birmingham and Wolverhampton Levels of the BCN. It was later made navigable for a part of its length to the Stourbridge Railway at Rood End and the British Industrial Plastics chemical factory was built upon it. It is now impassable and without towpath access. Titford Pool, Tat Bank Branch and the top pound of the Titford Canal are the highest point of the BCN. They are accessible from Engine Street.

It is regarded as inedible by some authors, but it is nevertheless eaten in parts of Europe. Description Lactarius scrobiculatus produces large agaricoid fruiting bodies which arise from soil. The cap has an eye-catching orange to yellow coloration and is covered with small scales arranged in indistinctive concentric rings. The surface is wet, glossy and slimy especially in wet weather. The cap may be wide, with a large diameter (about 15 cm in mature specimens), but with a depressed centre and slightly inrolled margin. The gills are crowded and coloured cream to yellow, with darker patches being present sometimes. When cut, the gills bleed copious amounts of a white to cream milk (latex), which soon darkens to yellow. The stem, in relation to the cap, is quite short and stubby. The surface is cap-coloured but the presence of small pits, filled with fluid, is a key identifying feature. The stem is hollow. The spores are coloured creamy with an elliptical-globular shape. When a small piece of flesh is chewed, it tastes bitter to acrid. So acrid, that a researcher reportedly developed a numbness in the mouth, having nibbled on a piece. It doesn't have any discernible smell. There are several recognised varieties, including var. canadensis. var. montanus and var. pubescens. Distribution Lactarius scrobiculatus is known to occur throughout Europe, and to a lesser extent North America where its occurrence is rare. It occurs primarily in coniferous and birch forests. It forms mycorrhizal relationships and appears to prefer damp, shady and boggy areas. The fruiting bodies appear in troops, sometimes forming fairy rings and only rarely occur singly. The fruiting season of L. scrobiculatus is summer to autumn. Closeup of gills and stem, showing latex. Edibility Most authors consider Lactarius scrobiculatus inedible. It is collected and eaten in parts of eastern Europe and Russia after salting, pickling and thorough cooking. Consuming it irritates the gastrointestinal tract, causing symptoms of gastrointestinal syndrome. Careful preparation seeks to neutralise the acrid taste. This usually involves a process of boiling, during which the water is discarded. Further cooking and pickling may not eliminate the possibility of distressing symptoms.

Banalata (Kiron Kher) has lived a solitary existence since her husband-to-be died the night before their wedding from a snake bite. Never having quite gotten over the tragedy, she rarely ventures out and is clearly very lonely. This changes when she agrees to allow a film production unit to shoot in a wing in her sprawling estate. Suddenly her house is filled with movie stars and glamorous people, including the beautiful actress Sudeshna (Roopa Ganguly) and charming director Deepankar (Chiranjeet Chakraborty). Though she knows that not only is Deepankar married but that his former lover Sudeshna still holds a torch for him, the lonely woman finds herself drawn to the director. He is exactly the sort of worldly character whom she has always longed to meet. The rakish man flirts back and even persuades Banalata to appear in a bit part in the movie. Yet once the film crew decamps, things at the estate return to the same grinding tedium as before, though the woman feels her isolation all the more acutely. The letters that Banalata writes to Deepankar go unanswered, and her bit part in the movie ends up on the cutting- room floor.

Early career When Gaughran was young, he played Gaelic football for St. Laurence O'Tooles and subsequently took up rugby with O'Connell Schools,Glasgow Celtic Grab Gaughran, Irish Press, 16 November 1936 where he had great possibilities as a full back.Gaughran Gone to Glasgow: Celtic Club, Irish Independent, 16 November 1936 Gaughran's main sport was rugby until 18 years of age when he played his first game of Association Football. While with O'Connell Schools he played for Leinster against Connacht in a schools' junior interprovincial. He later joined Clontarf, where he played a few games for them. Charlie Harris, the Bohemians' trainer succeeded in inducing him to take up Association Football. Gaughran believed that his rugby training gave him a good grounding for soccer and that \\"[i]f one could kick an oval ball accurately there should be no great difficulty in learning how to control a round one.\\" After a few games with Bohemians' Leinster League team he made his debut for their Free State team against Waterford at Kilcohan Park and very soon attracted the attention of a number of cross-channel clubs. Arsenal were very keen to sign him towards the close of the 1935–36 season and sent their chief scout to sign him but they were unsuccessful. Bohemians was not his first soccer club, as he played 6 matches for a junior team in the Phoenix Park, scoring 36 goals for them. Interest from UK clubs At the start of the 1936–37 season, there was interest in Gaughran from several UK football clubs, including Arsenal, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Burnley,Four Clubs Want Him: Gaughran Should Await Biggest Offer, Irish Independent, 11 November 1936 Blackburn Rovers and Manchester United.

It is at the intersection of U.S. Route 380 and Texas State Highway 208, southwest of Jayton and east of Post. Clairemont lies near the center of Kent County, and the estimated population as of the 2000 census was 15. History Clairemont was established in 1892 to coincide with the organization of Kent County with the understanding that it would serve as the county's seat of government.Charles G. Davis, \\"Clairemont, TX,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hnc62, accessed December 04, 2012, Published by the Texas State Historical Association. The new town was located on land owned by local rancher R.L. Rhomberg, who named the new town after his niece, Claire Becker. In 1895, a sandstone courthouse and matching jail were constructed. By that time, the town had several stores, a bank, a newspaper, and a hotel. Although the Stamford and Northwestern Railway had bypassed Clairemont to the east by 1909, the town continued to prosper. Cotton farming and cattle ranching dominated the economy, and oil later became important. By the 1930s, the population exceeded 200. By the 1950s, however, the town had begun a steady decline and by 1954 had lost its title as county seat to nearby Jayton. The Clairemont courthouse burned shortly after the records were transferred to Jayton, but the bottom story was preserved as a community center. The remaining citizens soon began to move away, and the population dwindled to about 15 by the 2000s.

History The construction for a new riverfront area between the two stadiums is the result of a public participation planning process begun in October 1996. Hamilton County and the City of Cincinnati engaged Urban Design Associates to prepare a plan to give direction in two public policy areas: # To site the two new stadiums for the Cincinnati Reds and the Cincinnati Bengals # To develop an overall urban design framework for the development of the central riverfront which would capitalize on the major public investment in the stadiums and structured parking. A Riverfront Steering Committee made up of City and County elected officials and staff was formed as a joint policy board for the Central Riverfront Plan. Focus groups, interviews, and public meetings were held throughout the planning process. A Concept Plan was published in April 1997 which identified three possible scenarios for the siting of the stadiums and the development of the riverfront. The preparation of a final Master Plan was delayed due to a November 1998 public referendum on the siting of the Reds Stadium. Once the decision on the Reds Stadium was made by the voters in favor of a riverfront site, Hamilton County and the City of Cincinnati appointed sixteen prominent citizens to the Riverfront Advisors Commission who were charged to \\"recommend mixed usage for the Riverfront that guarantees public investment will create sustainable development on the site most valued by our community\\". The result of that effort was The Banks, a September 1999 report from the Advisors which contained recommendations on land use, parking, finance, phasing, and developer selection for the Central Riverfront. The final Master Plan includes The Banks recommendations from the advisors. Carter and The Dawson Co. were selected by the city of Cincinnati and Hamilton County as master developers for the 18-acre mixed-use project. Carter has also served as program manager for the construction of the city and county-funded parking garage and infrastructure components of The Banks project, including accommodation of parking for the Cincinnati Reds stadium. Bob Castellini, CEO of the Cincinnati Reds, was a chair of Joint Banks Steering Committee. On November 1, 2007, Cincinnati City Council and Hamilton County approved of the project. Groundbreaking took place on April 2, 2008. The first phase, which opened in the summer of 2011, included Current at The Banks, a building containing 300 apartment units atop 96,000 square feet of street-level retail space. Currently, the apartments are fully leased and the retail space is approximately 92 percent occupied. Many of the retail tenants include bars, restaurants and musical venues such as Yard House, Tin Roof, Mahogany's, Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill and Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. The second phase of The Banks is slated to break ground in the summer of 2013. Phase II will include an additional 300 apartment units, more than 60,000 square feet of street level retail and more than 400 parking spaces along Vine Street in between Second Street and Freedom Way. It will be located near Paul Brown Stadium, home of the Cincinnati Bengals. Plans also call for the development of 180 Walnut @ The Banks, a 233,496-square-foot, Class A office building. According to a recent study of Phase I by The University of Cincinnati Economic Center, it is estimated that The Banks will have an ongoing economic impact of $91.6 million, as well as generating $556 million in construction- based impact. Upon completion, The Banks will be the region's largest mixed- use development and will house more than 3,000 residents. The city of Cincinnati, the county and a joint venture between Carter and The Dawson Company formed The Banks Public Private Partnership to secure funding and develop the project. Through a successful public-private partnership, The Banks is one of the nation's preeminent urban \\"Live, Work, Play\\" destinations.

It is named after John G. Smale, who gave $20 million for its construction in memory of his wife, Phyllis W. Smale. Design Concept image of the Cincinnati Riverfront Park The park will connect Bicentennial Commons and Sawyer Point to form an almost corridor of public park along the river. The park will include: *Playgrounds *Boat docks *A Great Lawn *Green spaces for festivals and community events *A carousel *Gardens *Bike trails *Walkways *Tree groves *A river's edge promenade with oversized \\"porch\\" swings *Water features (jets, cascades, pools and waterfalls) *Grand stairs Also considered for the park is a historical marker indicating the position of home plate of the former Cinergy Field (Riverfront Stadium). The area to be occupied by the Banks and the Riverfront Park is the former site of this storied facility, razed in 2002 after the completion of Great American Ballpark to the east. As of 2013, Phase I is completed, including the Schmidlapp Stage and Event Lawn, the Walnut Street Steps and interactive fountain, the Main Street interactive fountain, the Black Brigade Monument, tree groves, a labyrinth, Cincinnati Bike and Visitor's Center, and the Moerlein Lager House. This is only a small portion of the other 45 acres of park space. Funding *Congress has appropriated $3 million for design and planning. The federal government will contribute up to $50 million in additional funding. *$3.5 million has been given by Cincinnati and Ohio for planning and design. *Cincinnati has applied for $8 million federal funds and $2 million in state funds for the first phases of park construction. *The initial $1 million has been provided by private funds. *Total cost for the park will be $66 million. *Annual costs for operation will be $1.2 million offset by parks, restaurants, retail, events, concessions, modest tax and private support. *$20 million gift from John G.

The two versions of the revolver differ only in barrel length (The M1883 had a 5-inch barrel). Although the design was dated, the weapon was extremely robust, and they were still used through World War I. The M1879 is referred to as the \\"cavalry model\\" and the M1883 as the \\"officer's model,\\" by collectors, which were not official designations. Design Both models were single-action, solid frame, non-ejecting six-shot revolvers. The caliber was an indigenous 10.6×25mmR with a medium-length cartridge case, comparable to the contemporary .44 Russian round in size and power. Loading was via a gate on the revolver's right side, and the cylinder was released by pulling the hammer to half-cock. Removing empty cartridges could be done by removing the cylinder by withdrawing the axis pin, and then removing the casings by hand, but in actual practice a separate small rod (stored in the ammunition pouch) was used to push the casings out without having to remove the cylinder. A unique feature among these revolvers was the safety lever, which was often applied with the hammer resting in the half-cock position. Most revolvers came with a lanyard ring for attachment to the uniform. References * Military Small Arms of the Twentieth Century, 7th Edition, Weeks, John, Hogg, Ian V.

This club merged with FC Vorwärts 1908 Braunschweig to become FC Sportfreunde Braunschweig on 7 September 1912. FC Sportfreunde then joined Sportverein 07 Braunschweig on 1 January 1919 to create VfB 1904 Braunschweig. From 1907 to 1914, SV had played as FC Britannia Braunschweig, acknowledging the roots of the game in Britain, until the club changed its name with the onset of World War I when that country became a wartime foe. In 1907, SV was joined by FC Germania Braunschweig which was a founding club of the German Football Association in Leipzig in 1900.

However, the club made a fleeting appearance (1943–44) in the war-weakened first division Gauliga Südhannover-Braunschweig which was formed in 1942 after the split of the Gauliga Niedersachsen. Following World War II the club became SV Rot-Weiß Braunschweig and fused with SV Brunswiek 1936 Braunschweig to play the 1945–46 season in the Oberliga Niedersachsen Süd (I) as VfB Brunswiek 04 Braunschweig. They resumed their identity as SV Rot- Weiß the following year and slipped into lower-tier competition. In 1953 the club again changed its name, this time to VfB Rot-Weiß 04 Braunschweig.

The movement has been a member of the Friends of the Earth International since 1994. History Hnutí DUHA was founded in 1989 by a group of students from Brno, Czechoslovakia shortly before the end of Communist rule, and officially registered as a non- governmental organization on 28 September 1990 under the name Hnutí Duha - Přátelé Země Česká republika (The Rainbow Movement - Friends of the Earth Czech Republic). Since then it has grown into a large organization, eclipsing the other environmental movements (such as Greenpeace) in the country. Among the most well-known members are Vojtěch Kotecký and two of the founders: Jan Beránek and Jakub Patočka. Several members of Hnutí DUHA have become prominent members of the Czech Green Party but the movement is nominally independent of political parties. the organisation employs around 40 people, between its main offices in Brno and a smaller office in Prague. Ten branches were established throughout the country, starting with Olomouc in 1991. Large numbers of volunteers, usually students, participate in the activities of Hnutí DUHA. The movement rejects formal hierarchical structure and prefers to work in task- oriented semi-independent groups. The 2005 budget was less than 11 million CZK, and has decreased steadily since then. About 60% of funding comes from foundations, such as the Heinrich Böll Foundation, and about 15% from Czech government grants. The remainder consists of individual contributions and profit from the organisation's web-based publishing house. Starting in 2001, the movement issues a bi-monthly journal Sedmá generace (The Seventh Generation). The movement organizes protest campaigns (e.g. a long campaign against the Temelín Nuclear Power Station during the 1990s), provides environmental impact estimates for assessment processes and for new legislative acts, offers ecological services for individuals and municipalities and promotes the use of renewable technologies. It has contributed to the cancellation or delay of several large construction projects, including a new highway to southern Bohemia, and expansion of lignite mining in northern Bohemia. Hnutí DUHA is one of 30 national organisations represented in the Friends of the Earth Europe umbrella organisation.

It is related to notions of curvature in geometry. In the form presented below, the concept was introduced in 1995 by the mathematician Mark S. Melnikov; accordingly, it may be referred to as the Melnikov curvature or Menger-Melnikov curvature. Melnikov and Verdera (1995) established a powerful connection between the curvature of measures and the Cauchy kernel. Definition Let μ be a Borel measure on the Euclidean plane R2. Given three (distinct) points x, y and z in R2, let R(x, y, z) be the radius of the Euclidean circle that joins all three of them, or +∞ if they are collinear. The Menger curvature c(x, y, z) is defined to be :c(x, y, z) = \\\\frac{1}{R(x, y, z)}, with the natural convention that c(x, y, z) = 0 if x, y and z are collinear. It is also conventional to extend this definition by setting c(x, y, z) = 0 if any of the points x, y and z coincide. The Menger-Melnikov curvature c2(μ) of μ is defined to be :c^{2} (\\\\mu) = \\\\iiint_{\\\\mathbb{R}^{2}} c(x, y, z)^{2} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (x) \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (y) \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (z). More generally, for α ≥ 0, define c2α(μ) by :c^{2 \\\\alpha} (\\\\mu) = \\\\iiint_{\\\\mathbb{R}^{2}} c(x, y, z)^{2 \\\\alpha} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (x) \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (y) \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (z). One may also refer to the curvature of μ at a given point x: :c^{2} (\\\\mu; x) = \\\\iint_{\\\\mathbb{R}^{2}} c(x, y, z)^{2} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (y) \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (z), in which case :c^{2} (\\\\mu) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^{2}} c^{2} (\\\\mu; x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (x). Examples * The trivial measure has zero curvature. * A Dirac measure δa supported at any point a has zero curvature. * If μ is any measure whose support is contained within a Euclidean line L, then μ has zero curvature. For example, one- dimensional Lebesgue measure on any line (or line segment) has zero curvature. * The Lebesgue measure defined on all of R2 has infinite curvature. * If μ is the uniform one-dimensional Hausdorff measure on a circle Cr or radius r, then μ has curvature 1/r. Relationship to the Cauchy kernel In this section, R2 is thought of as the complex plane C. Melnikov and Verdera (1995) showed the precise relation of the boundedness of the Cauchy kernel to the curvature of measures. They proved that if there is some constant C0 such that :\\\\mu(B_{r} (x)) \\\\leq C_{0} r for all x in C and all r > 0, then there is another constant C, depending only on C0, such that :\\\\left6 \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{C}} \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\varepsilon} (\\\\mu) (z) |^{2} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (z) - c_{\\\\varepsilon}^{2} (\\\\mu) \\\\right\\\\leq C \\\\\\\\mu \\\\for all ε > 0\\\\. Here cε denotes a truncated version of the Menger-Melnikov curvature in which the integral is taken only over those points x, y and z such that :x - y > \\\\varepsilon; :y - z > \\\\varepsilon; :z - x > \\\\varepsilon. Similarly, \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\varepsilon} denotes a truncated Cauchy integral operator: for a measure μ on C and a point z in C, define :\\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\varepsilon} (\\\\mu) (z) = \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{\\\\xi - z} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\mu (\\\\xi), where the integral is taken over those points ξ in C with :\\\\xi - z > \\\\varepsilon.

Early life and training Born as Nadine Judd in Bloemfontein, the provincial capital of the Orange Free State (now Free State Province) in central South Africa, she was a descendant of British settlers who had immigrated to the diamond-rich area in search of a new life. Her parents, who were in the English-speaking minority of the city, where Afrikaans was the official language, encouraged her childhood interest in theater. Her first stage appearance was at the age of 8 or 9, when she appeared as Cio-Cio San's child in a local production of Madama Butterfly. Her serious study of dance did not come until after her parents moved the family to Durban, the major city in the coastal province of Natal (now KwaZulu-Natal). There she studied drama with Elizabeth Sneddon at Natal University, ballet with Eileen Keegan, a gifted teacher who had danced with Anna Pavlova's company, and stagecraft and mime with Dorothea McNair.Marina Grut, \\"Nerina, Nadia,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, 1981), p. 398. Keegan is credited with laying the foundations of Nerina's strong classical ballet technique.Clarke, \\"Nadia Nerina,\\" obituary, 7 October 2008. After Judd's mother died, while she was in her early teens, her teachers advised her father to send their talented pupil to England for further instruction. In 1945, not long after World War II had ended in Europe, Mr. Judd arranged passage for his daughter on a ship sailing from Cape Town to Southampton. She was 17 or 18 at the time. Once settled in London, with aspirations to join Ballet Rambert, she sought out and took classes with Marie Rambert, who befriended her and encouraged her. She then went on to the Sadler's Wells Ballet School, under the direction of Ninette de Valois, and to the studio of Elsa Brunelleschi, where she studied Spanish dancing.Grut, \\"Nerina, Nadia,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (1981), p. 398. While still a student at Sadler's Wells, she appeared as a nursemaid to the baby Princess Aurora in the famous production of The Sleeping Beauty mounted for the reopening of the Royal Opera House on 20 February 1946.Clarke, \\"Nadia Nerina,\\" obituary, 7 October 2008. The following summer, intent on improving her classical technique, she went to Paris with her friend Elaine Fifield, to study with Olga Preobrajenska, a former star of the Russian Imperial Ballet in Saint Petersburg. Professional career Upon returning to England in the autumn, Judd danced briefly with the Sadler's Wells Opera Ballet, which soon was reformed and renamed the Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet. There, under the guidance of ballet mistress Peggy van Praagh, she worked with Leo Kersley, who became a close friend, Kenneth MacMillan, Peter Darrell, and emergent choreographer John Cranko, a fellow South African.Clement Crisp, ed., Ballerina: Portraits and Impressions of Nadia Nerina (London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1975). At this time, she assumed the stage name Nadia Nerina, derived from the delicate, lily-like flowers called nerines, a species native to South Africa. Cast as the Circus Dancer in Andrée Howard's Mardi Gras, she enjoyed her first big success, winning approval of balletomanes and applause from audiences whenever she appeared. In December 1947, she joined the main Sadler's Wells company at Covent Garden as a soloist. Within three days, she was on stage, dancing a solo in Michel Fokine's Les Sylphides.Clement Crisp, \\"Nerina, Nadia,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance, edited by Selma Jeanne Cohen and others (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), vol. 4, p. 584. Set to Chopin's Mazurka in D Major (op. 33, no. 2), it showed her light, high jumps, fleet footwork, and soft port de bras to particular advantage. Soon thereafter, de Valois saw her in a solo in the Swan Lake pas de trois, which she had learned from Preobrajenska, and, recognizing her individuality, encouraged her in what Nerina described as \\"my natural style.\\"Clarke, \\"Nadia Nerina,\\" obituary, 7 October 2008. Thereafter, her progress was swift, as one good role followed another.

Her acting talent was also admired by Kenneth MacMillan, who in 1956 cast her in his first ballet, Noctambules, a dark tale of a hypnotist in which she played a veiled, aged woman pursued by four suitors when she is restored to her youthful beauty.Adam Bernstein, \\"'Bravura' Classical Ballerina Nadia Nerina,\\" obituary, Washington Post, 9 October 2008. Such dramatic roles were not her forte, however, as her sunny disposition and dazzling technique made her more suitable to lively roles and classical brilliance. The year 1960 was a banner one for Nerina. On 28 January, she appeared with the Royal Ballet (so called since 1956) in the role with which she would thereafter be most closely identified, that of Lise in Ashton's La Fille Mal Gardée (\\"the poorly guarded girl\\"). Based on an old French tale of a widow and her wayward daughter, Ashton's reworking of Jean Dauberval's 1789 ballet was an immediate hit. The three scenes were set in the widow's farmyard, at a nearby field, and in the living room of the farmhouse. The charming décor and costumes were designed by Osbert Lancaster, and the choreography was set to a melodious new score arranged and orchestrated by John Lanchbery. Besides Nerina in the title role, it starred David Blair as Colas, her sweetheart; Stanley Holden en travestie as her mother, the Widow Simone; and Alexander Grant as Alain, her hapless suitor.Julie Kavanagh, Secret Muses: The Life of Frederick Ashton (New York: Pantheon, 1996), pp. 421-422. Ashton called them his \\"ideal cast,\\" and, although they have since been succeeded by numerous others, it is doubtful that they have ever, as a quartet, been surpassed.Clarke, \\"Nadia Nerina,\\" obituary, 8 October 2008. After its premiere, Ashton's bucolic comedy was described as \\"an unabashedly lyrical, bravura showcase for pixieish (5 feet, 4 inches, 105 pounds) Nadia Nerina.\\"Staff writer, Time magazine, quoted by Bruce Weber in \\"Nadia Nerina,\\" obituary, 11 October 2008. It was declared a signal success, even called a masterpiece, and has since entered the contemporary canon, in no small measure because of its original leading lady. Nerina was also well known outside England. In the early 1950s, she toured South Africa several times, presenting recital programs with fellow South African Alexis Rassine and starring with him in a local production of Giselle in Cape Town.Grut, \\"Nerina, Nadia,\\" in The History of Ballet in South africa (1981), p. 398. With the Sadler's Wells company (later the Royal Ballet), she toured Europe and North America on many occasions.Alexander Bland, The Royal Ballet: The First Fifty Years (New York: Doubleday 1981). She was particularly popular in France, where she was applauded for her performances in Massine's Mam'zelle Angot and Cranko's Bonne-Bouche, both with a distinctly Gallic flavor. She was also warmly appreciated by Scottish audiences in Edinburgh and Glasgow, where she often performed during the Sadler's Wells Ballet tours in the 1950s.Anonymous, \\"Nadia Nerina–Dancer with Royal Ballet,\\" obituary, The Scotsman (London), 8 October 2008. In 1960, after her January triumph at Covent Garden, she was invited to perform as guest ballerina with both the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow and the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad. Partnered by Nikolai Fadeyechev in Swan Lake in Moscow in 1960 and by Konstantin Sergeyev in Giselle in Leningrad in 1961, she won acclaim in both ballet-loving cities.Crisp, \\"Nerina, Nadia,\\" in International Encyclopedia of Dance (1998), vol. 4, p. 585. She was also well loved in America. In 1964, she represented Great Britain at the commemoration performance for slain president John F. Kennedy at the White House in Washington, D.C.Grut, \\"Nerina, Nadia,\\" in The History of Ballet in South Africa (1981), p. 398. In 1965, Nerina asked Ashton, then director of the Royal Ballet, to be designated a \\"guest artist,\\" to enable her to pursue invitations from other companies. Among them was Western Theatre Ballet, based in Bristol, where she created a major role in Peter Darrell's Home, about a young woman in an asylum. She made guest appearances with the Royal Ballet until 1968, dancing in La Fille Mal Gardée and Sylvia, and she was a popular star at ballet galas, usually giving her fees to dancers' benevolent funds. After her retirement in 1969, she became a patron of the Cecchetti Society, which preserves the Italian teaching system on which British ballet was founded.

Personal life In the early 1960s, Nerina was widely regarded as the rightful successor to the aging Margot Fonteyn as the leading ballerina of the Royal Ballet. Her career path was diverted, however, by the defection of the young Rudolf Nureyev from the Kirov Ballet in 1961. His subsequent partnership with Fonteyn at the Royal Ballet postponed her retirement and revitalized her career. She remained the reigning queen of the Covent Garden stage for another two decades. Nerina was disappointed at being overshadowed by Fonteyn and Nureyev, but, ever generous in spirit, she never blamed Fonteyn for her dominance. She remained on friendly terms with her for many years, but her relationship with the mercurial Nureyev was ambivalent. They successfully danced together on a number of occasions, but their partnership was often testy.Anonymous, \\"Nadia Nerina,\\" obituary, The Telegraph (London), 7 October 2008. Alexis Rassine, David Blair, and the great Danish dancer Erik Bruhn, with whom she danced Swan Lake in 1962, were much more agreeable to her as partners.Weber, \\"Nadia Nerina,\\" obituary, 11 October 2008. Nerina married Charles Gordon, a financier and entrepreneur from South Africa, in 1956. During the years of his rocky career, she remained a loyal and supportive wife. They had no children. After her retirement from the stage in 1969, they moved to Monte Carlo and then to southern France, where she lived until her death. She died at her home in Beaulieu-sur-Mer, on the Mediterranean coast west of Nice. She was 80 years old. Legacy Insights into Nerina's work and her approach to her roles can be gained from her comments and interviews in the following books. * Clement Crisp, ed.

(If Pitscottie made an erroneous assumption, George would likely be a son of Sir Patrick Dunbar (son of Alexander de Dunbar)). John was son of Alexander de Dunbar, Knt. (a younger son of Patrick de Dunbar, 7th Earl of March), although some genealogies place John as a son of Patrick de Dunbar, 8th Earl of March. If John's father Alexander was a younger brother of Patrick de Dunbar, \\"8th\\" Earl of March, then John is not a younger brother of Sir Patrick de Dunbar, 9th Earl of March. George succeeded his first cousin once removed Sir Patrick in his honours and estates, and appears in a charter dated 28 June 1363; and is second witness, styled 'cousin' of Sir Patrick (rather than 'nephew') and his wife 'black' Agnes, in another charter signed at Dunbar Castle on 24 May 1367.Bain (1888),pps: xx - xxv \\"Robetus de Lawedre, consanguineus noster\\" (a cousin) witnessed a charter of \\"Georgii comitis Marchie\\" relating to Sorrowlessfield, a still extant property on the (A68) road south of Earlston, Berwickshire, in the reign (1390–1406) of Robert III,Young, James, Historical References to the Scottish Family of Lauder, Glasgow, 1884, p.19 indicating both his extended family and that he was active in the management of the Dunbar family estates during Robert's reign. Campaigns and intrigue The Earl of March acquired the estates centred on the castles of Morton and Tibbers, with Morton likely becoming the centre of administration for both.* The Earl of March accompanied James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas, in his incursion into England, and after the Battle of Otterburn (1388) he took command of the Scots, whom he conducted safely home. His daughter Elizabeth was betrothed by contract to David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay, son of King Robert III and heir to the throne, but Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Douglas, 'The Grim', protested against the match, and through the influence of the Duke of Albany had the contract annulled, and had the prince married to his own daughter Marjory instead. Exile to England In consequence of this slight upon his family's honour, George renounced his allegiance to Robert III and retired into England, placing himself under the protection of King Henry IV. On 28 June 1401, Henry granted, by Letters Patent, to \\"George de Dunbarre earl of the March of Scotland and Cristiana his wife\\" the lordship of Somerton in Lincolnshire, and the heirs male of their bodies, to be held by homage and military service. On the same day Henry gave \\"George de Dunbarre earl of the March of Scotland\\" £100 sterling per annum \\"of his special favour\\" and in October granted him 'costs' of £25/9s/7d; and granted his wife \\"Cristiana countess of Dunbarre\\" £40/19s/3d \\"for her charges and expenses coming from the North at his command, to prosecute certain matters touching her husband, herself, and their heirs\\".Bain (1888), vol.iv, pps:125 & 130, nos.602 & 623. Battles In 1401 he made a wasteful inroad into Scotland, and in June 1402 he was victorious against a small Scottish force at the Battle of Nesbit Moor. At the subsequent Battle of Homildon Hill he again fought on the English side. In the summer of 1403 the Percies declared open revolt against King Henry IV and raised their standard of revolt at Chester. A plan was hatched to seize the King's son, the young Prince of Wales, at Shrewsbury. The plan was foiled by the extreme speed with which Henry IV moved once he heard details of the revolt. \\"Egged on by his very competent and energetic ally, the renegade Scotsman, George Dunbar\\", he drove his men across the Midlands towards Shrewsbury, raising more troops as he went.Earle, Peter, The Life and Times of Henry V, London, 1972, p.56-7, The Battle of Shrewsbury took place on 21 July 1403, with Dunbar fighting on the side of Henry IV.Dunbar, Sir Alexander H., Bt., Scottish Kings, Edinburgh, 1899, p.177 It was a royal victory and the revolt was, for the moment, over. Estates Thereafter in the same year \\"George de Dunbar earl of the March of Scotland\\" petitioned (Parliamentary Petitions, No.961) Henry IV stating that he had lost all his castles, lordships, goods and chattels in Scotland on account of his being his liegeman, and asked the King to \\"ordain in this parliament that if any conquest is made in the realm of Scotland, the petitioner may have restoration of his castles, &c.;, and also his special protection for all dwelling in the earldom of March who come to his allegiance hereafter\\". This was endorsed by the King.Bain (1888), vol.iv, p.132-3, no.634. On 21 January 1403/4 \\"George de Dunbarre earl of the March of Scotland\\" received a £100 annuity from Henry IV.Bain (1888), vol.iv, p.137, no.650. Between 14 and 18 August 1403, King Henry granted George de Dunbar, Earl of March, the ward of the manors and lordships of Kyme and Croftes in Lincolnshire, and a house and chattels in Bishopsgate, City of London, for life, which had previously belonged to the late Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, and was forfeited by his rebellion.Bain (1888), vol.iv, p.133, nos.637, 639. Under a Letters Patent, \\"the King's cousin, George de Dunbarre, Earl of March of Scotland\\", for \\"his daily service and great costs\\" was given the manor of Clippeston in Shirewood by King Henry IV on 10 June 1405. In addition, on 14th of the following month, the King gave him the ward of the lands of the late Thomas Umfraville in Haysille on Humber in York, till the majority of Gilber his heir, or his heirs in succession if he dies in minority.Bain (1888), vol. iv, p.142-3, nos.681/685. In addition he shared in the forfeited estates of the attainted Thomas Bardolf, 5th Lord Bardolf (who later fell with Percy at the Battle of Bramham Moor in February 1408). However, as the following decree shows, George did not retain them all: \\"27 April 1407. The King to the sheriff of Lincoln.

The creek is named for the location of its mouth, twenty miles (32 km) west of the Niagara River along the Lake Ontario shoreline. The Indian name for the Twenty Mile Creek was the Kenachdaw, which translates to Lead River. Watershed The Twenty Mile Creek's watershed covers an area of and is about in length. The creek begins at the headwaters above the Niagara escarpment in the City of Hamilton, rising near the Hamilton International Airport. From there the creek travels east above the escarpment, before turning north and crossing the Niagara Escarpment at Balls Falls, where it drops . The creek eventually enters Lake Ontario at Jordan Harbour, after passing through the Jordan Marsh, which was created by lake waters flooding the lower reaches of the river valley. The Twenty Mile Creek watershed contains five sub-watersheds including the main channel of Twenty Mile Creek; Gavora Ditch, Spring Creek, North Creek and Sinkhole Creek. The Twenty Mile Creek watershed contains several areas of natural and scientific interest, environmentally sensitive areas, and regionally significant wetlands. The upper reaches of the Twenty Mile Creek watershed are characterized by rolling topography with fairly steep slopes in the headwaters. Further downstream, the watershed contains gently rolling to flat topography before the creek flows over the Niagara Escarpment. Navigation Historically, the Twenty Mile Creek has been navigable by small craft and canoe as far upriver as Smithville, with the use of portages, most notably around the cataracts at Ball's Falls. In recent years, rafters, kayakers, and canoes have navigated the rapids above and below Ball's Falls (including Upper Ball's Falls (36\\")), although the main cataract has yet to be attempted. The rapids rate a Class II to Class V (depending on river level) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Settlements The waterway played an essential role in the development of the communities on its banks. Smithville, St. Anns, and Jordan all owe their early activity to industry based upon the creek. The ghost town of Ball's Falls' development was also due to its location on the Twenty. Terror plot The Canadian National trestle bridge near Jordan was allegedly the subject of a terror plot in early 2013. The alleged plot involved an attempt by Chiheb Esseghaier and Raed Jaser, both non-citizen residents of Canada, to derail the daily New York-Toronto passenger train as it crossed the trestle. The two men were allegedly affiliates of an Al-Qaeda group operating out of Iran.

History  At its inception in 2000,Simon Hayward, Ken Dulaney, Bob Egan, Daryl C. Plummer, Nigel Deighton, Martin Reynolds, \\"Beyond the Internet: The 'Supranet'\\", Gartner research report, September 2000 the term was alluding to the ongoing convergence of the Internet, mobile communications, always-on connectivity, sensors and advanced human-computer interaction. In subsequent elaborations, it was extended to include electronic tagging (via, for example, RFID), geotagging and electronic geomapping (i.e., mapping internet coordinates to geodetic coordinates), thereby completing the fusion of physical and virtual.Paolo Magrassi, Angelo Panarella, Nigel Deighton, Geoff Johnson, \\"Computers to Acquire Control of the Physical World\\", Gartner research report T-14-0301, 28 September 2001Philip Redman, Jean-Claude Delcroix, Kathy Harris, Rich Mogull, John Monroe, \\"A Brave Mobile World: Emerging Technologies for Mobility\\", Gartner research report T-14-0297, 1 October 2001Paolo Magrassi, \\"E-Tags: From Niches to the Supranet\\", Gartner research report T-14-8198, 11 January 2002  Paradigm  Collectively, those publications anticipated the following trends, all subsumed under the \\"Supranet\\" heading: * The increase of miniature intelligent devices, such as microelectromechanical systems or RFID tags, already numbered by the billions in 2001; * The electronic coding of physical objects (from consumer goods to cars, from drugs to clothing, from banknotes and sheets of paper), which makes them all uniquely identifiable; * The fact that all or most such objects will be networked via the wireless Internet (the \\"Internet of things\\"); * The fact that all humans (or animals) carrying such objects will be networked and identifiable; * The fact that the geographic location of many such entities (animals and physical objects) will be known with increasing precision; * The fact that the planet's surface will be mapped in the internet, either via ad hoc GIS's or in more-definitive ways such as assigning an IP address to every square meter on earth.  Practical aspects  A practical common example of Supranet is photography geotagging, as it can be done in Flickr, Panoramio or Picasa, perhaps (although not necessarily) using GPS-enabled cameras. However, applications will be only limited by the users' imagination. It will be possible to attach electronic information to places, from the botanic description of plants on mountain trails to the projection of ancient Rome onto the actual vision of the current landscape from the Pincio; it will be possible for products to self-determine their paths along supply chains, and to auto-assemble; it will be possible to grow cyborgs resembling fiction characters. Moving across the three-dimensional physical space will match movements in the digital/virtual one, and vice versa.

He preferred to spell his first name with a \\"G\\", even though it began officially with a \\"J\\". Although the details of his early years are not entirely certain, Giménez was probably born in Seville and spent his childhood and adolescence in Cádiz. Claudo Prieto, La Tempranica, Mundoclassico.com, July 1, 2004 A child prodigy, he began music lessons with his father and continued his education with Salvador Viniegra. By the age of 12, he was already playing among the first violins of the Teatro Principal orchestra in Cádiz. Five years later, he became the director of an opera and zarzuela company, making his debut in Gibraltar with a production of Giovanni Pacini's Safo. A scholarship permitted Giménez to enrol at the Conservatoire de Paris in June 1874, where he studied violin with Jean-Delphin Alard and composition with Ambroise Thomas. He received the first prize for harmony and counterpoint. After graduation, he traveled to Italy and then returned to Spain, settling in Madrid. In 1885, he was named director of Teatro Apolo de Madrid, and shortly afterwards, of the Teatro de la Zarzuela. Ruperto Chapí commissioned him to write the openings to his zarzuelas El Milagro de la Virgen and La bruja. As a conductor of the Sociedad de Conciertos de Madrid, Giménez helped cultivate the tastes of audiences in Madrid for symphonic music. According to \\"those who have seem him conduct [and] have transmitted to us the memory of his performances of great strength and great enthusiasm […] he obtained with imperceptible gestures what he wanted from the orchestra.\\" Carlos Gómez Amat, Historia de la Música Española. Siglo XIX. Ed. Alianza Música. Madrid, 1984. A prolific composer, Giménez also collaborated with the leading authors of sainetes (a comic genre found in Spanish theatre), including Ricardo de la Vega, Carlos Arniches, the brothers Serafín and Joaquín Álvarez Quintero, and Javier de Burgos, to obtain the libretti for his zarzuelas. He co-wrote the music of a number of his works with Amadeo Vives, who hailed him the \\"musician of elegance\\" because of his sense of rhythm and easy melodies. In 1896, Giménez wrote El mundo comedia es, or El baile de Luis Alonso, based on a text by Javier de Burgos. Following the success of this piece, he set to music another sainete by Burgos with the same characters, which became one of his most famous works: La boda de Luis Alonso, or La noche del encierro (1897). This second work, which achieved much greater success than the first, was actually meant to be a prequel, not a sequel. La tempranica was perhaps his most ambitious and successful work. Presented at the Teatro de la Zarzuela on 19 September 1900, it followed a text by Julián Romea. Giménez skillfully managed to combine moments of intense lyricism with scenes of colloquial explosion in a zarzuela which, according to Carlos Gómez Amat, \\"had all the qualities of the genre and none of the faults\\". Roger Alier, La Zarzuela. Ed. Robinbook, S.L. 2002. Barcelona. The influence of Giménez is often noticeable in the compositions of subsequent Spanish composers, such as Joaquín Turina and Manuel de Falla (especially the stylistic correspondences between La tempranica and the latter's opera La vida breve). Federico Moreno Torroba adapted the celebrated zarzuela into an opera by setting the spoken parts to music. In 1939, Joaquín Rodrigo also paid his respects with a Homenaje a la tempranica, which contained a solo part for castanets. Beyond dramatic works for the stage, Giménez also wrote three cadenzas to Beethoven's Violin Concerto. Towards the end of his life, Giménez lived in a precarious economic situation, which was made worse by the Madrid Conservatory's refusal to grant him a professorship in chamber music. He died in Madrid on 19 February 1923.

Life  Stojka was born in Kraubath an der Mur, Styria in 1933 as the fifth of six children to mother Maria \\"Sidi\\" Rigo Stojka and father Karl \\"Wackar\\" Horvath.French, L.. (2008). An Austrian Roma Family Remembers: Trauma and Gender in Autobiographies by Ceija, Karl, and Mongo Stojka. German Studies Review, 31(1), 68. Two of her brothers, Karl \\"Karli\\" Stojka and Johann \\"Mongo\\" Stojka, were also writers and musicians. The family were Roman Catholic Lovara Roma, members of the Bagareschtschi clan on their father's side and Giletschi clan on their mother's side. The Stojkas were horse-traders whose caravan spent winters in Vienna and summers travelling through the Austrian countryside, where the family could trace their heritage for over 200 years. Together with her mother and four of the five brothers, she survived the Holocaust and internment at Auschwitz, Ravensbruck, and Bergen-Belsen. Her father was sent to the Dachau concentration camp, then to Schloss Hartheim, where he was killed. Her youngest brother Ossi died in the \\"Zigunerfamillienlager\\" at Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1943. Stojka, her mother, and sisters were freed by the British from Bergen-Belsen in 1945 and returned to Vienna. Ceija began school at the age of twelve in the second grade. Stojka had two children, a son in 1949 and a daughter in 1951. Her son Jano, a jazz musician, died from drugs in 1979. She earned her livelihood selling fabric door-to-door, as well as rugs at markets at which she earned her living until 1984. Later, she lived in Vienna as a writer, painter, singer, and public lecturer. In 1992, she became the Austrian spokeswoman for the recognition of the Roma and Sinti genocide, along being a voice in the struggle against discrimination that the Roma continue to suffer throughout Europe. She died in Vienna in 2013 at the age of 79.  Autobiographies  Stojka wrote three autobiographies. The first, We Live in Seclusion: The Memories of a Romni, was published in 1988 and was one of the first popular works to make public the issues concerning the Nazi persecution of the Austrian Romani people. The publication received substantial public attention for its subject matter, as well as for the fact that a woman had written it, breaking Romani convention. She continued exploring these issues in Travelers on This World (1992) and I Dream That I am Alive - Liberated From Bergen-Belsen (Träume ich, dass ich lebe) (2005). All three books were published with the help of Karin Berger as editor. A commemorative sign for Ceija Stojka Platz in Vienna, Austria. Two of Stojka's brothers, Karl and Mongo Stojka, also published autobiographies about their family's experiences of Austrian Roma persecution under the Nazis.French, L.. (2008). An Austrian Roma Family Remembers: Trauma and Gender in Autobiographies by Ceija, Karl, and Mongo Stojka. German Studies Review, 31(1), 64–86. Karl Stojka, the fourth child in the family, released Auf der ganzen Welt zu Hause in 1994. Mongo Stojka, the oldest male in the family, published Papierene Kinder: Gluck, Zerstorung und Neubeginn einer Roma-Femilie in Osterreich in 2000. These overlapping autobiographies are among the only opportunities to compare the memories of family members who survived the Holocaust and consider the \\"separate and collective experiences of a major historical traumatic event,\\" given that only about 18% of Austrian Roma survived Nazi persecution.Freund, Florian, Gerhard Baumgartner, and Harald Greifeneder. Vermogensentzug, Restitution und Entschadigung der Roma und Sinti. Wien, Munchen: Oldenbourg Verlag, 2004 (p. 53) The Austrian author Karin Berger,Karin Berger editor of several books by Ceija Stojka, is well- known as a filmmaker too and published two documentary films on the life and work of Ceija Stojka: Ceija Stojka, Austria 1999, 85 min. [Navigator Film] Navigator Film Karin Berger Ceija Stojka and Unter den Brettern hellgrünes Gras / The Green Green Gras Beneath, Austria 2005, 52 min. [Navigator Film] Navigator Film Karin Berger Ceija Stojka Unter den Brettern hellgruenes Gras Stojka is featured in the 2013 documentary film Forget Us Not, which follows several non-Jewish survivors of the Holocaust.  Art  Stojka began painting at the age of 56 using unconventional painting implements like her fingers and toothpicks. She worked with \\"everything that comes between [her] fingers,\\" including cardboard, glass jars, postcards, and salt dough. Her work is rooted in German expressionism and folk art and depicts the death camps as well as \\"idyllic\\" pictures of family life in their painted wagon before the Holocaust. A 2014 retrospective exhibition \\"We Were Ashamed\\" described her body of work as two cycles. The first, titled \\"Even Death is Afraid of Auschwitz,\\" depicts her memories of concentration camps, and is composed primarily of black and white ink drawings and comparatively few oil paintings. The second \\"Bright Cycle\\" involves colorful oil paintings of nature, landscapes, Roma wagons, dance, and family. Her art has been exhibited throughout Europe, in Japan and in the United States. She also released a CD of Lovara Romani songs titled Me Diklem Suno (\\"I dreamt\\"). In 2018 the Ceija Stojka International Fund was created to contribute to the knowledge and international influence of the work of Ceija Stojka (1933-2013). The exhibitions in France (Marseille, Paris) “Ceija Stojka, a Roma artist in the century” produced by Lanicolacheur and La maison rouge with the support of the Antoine de Galbert Foundation and the Austrian Cultural Forum inspired the creation of the Fund. The Fund gathers personalities who, since the essential encounter between Ceija Stojka and Karin Berger (author and film maker) in 1986, contribute to international recognition and promotion of her work. Ceija Stojka’s commitment as an activist, artist, and spokesperson has led to the study and the exhibition of her works in Europe, Japan, and the USA. This was made possible thanks to a number of dedicated curators, experts, scientists, and friends.

Biography Born in Cádiz, Viniegra began studying law but soon decided to be a painter and entered the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Cádiz, where he was taught by Rámon Rodríguez Barcaza and José Pérez Jiménez. He concentrated initially on painting watercolors, and a series of works in that genre, which grew eventually into an album, earned him his first taste of public success, in 1877. In the following years, he won various painting prizes at regional exhibitions and traveled to Rome, where he devoted himself to the study of life drawing.Caso, E.D., Les Orientalistes de l'école Espagnole, ACR edition, 1997, p. 270 Patio del Convento de San Francisco de Cádiz, an 1881 work Returning to Spain in 1882, he competed that same year in the Exposición de Hernandéz, submitting the painting Un patio de Sevilla as his entry. Later, another work of large proportions, La bendición de los campos en 1800, was exhibited at the Exposición Nacional de Madrid in 1887 and received the first prize in its category. In 1890, he won a merit scholarship to study at the Academia Española de Bellas Artes in Rome where he resided until November 1896, and this Italian period marked the richest in his vast oeuvre. Displayed in Munich, Rome, and Budapest, his works were reproduced ceaselessly, making him one of the most popular painters in Europe. In 1897, La romería del Rocío was exhibited at the Sala Dante de Roma and at the Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes de Madrid. It also appeared at the World's Fairs in 1898 in Munich and Vienna, where it won several gold medals. The painting continued its international tour when a Polish dealer agreed to exhibit it in various cities in Eastern Europe. Viniegra finally donated it to the Museo de Arte Moderno in Madrid in 1905. Biography in Portuguese, based on \\"Viniegra, Salvador\\", Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana, vol. LXVIII, Madrid, Espasa-Calpe, pp. 1687–1689. Settling in Madrid, Viniegra was named the deputy director and conservator of the city's Prado museum in 1898. During this time, he became an important patron of the arts. Being a notable cellist himself, he gave particular support to musicians, among his beneficiaries being the composer Manuel de Falla and the cellist and conductor Juan Ruiz Casaux. He died in Madrid.

His chief claim to historical significance is that he was the first person to be tried for piracy outside England under Admiralty Law and thus without a jury. These Admiralty courts had been instituted to tackle the rise of piracy in colonial ports where civil and criminal courts had proved ineffective. Pirate career In July 1703, Governor Joseph Dudley of Boston sent out Captain Daniel Plowman of the Charles with a privateering license to attack French and Spanish ships off the coast of Newfoundland and Arcadia. John Quelch was Plowman's lieutenant. Before leaving Marblehead, Massachusetts, the Charless crew under Quartermaster Anthony Holding mutinied and locked the ailing Plowman in his cabin.New England Pirates -ThePiratesRealm.com The crew elected Quelch the captain, who turned the Charles south. Plowman was thrown overboard, although it was never established whether he was dead or alive at that moment. The crew plundered nine Portuguese ships off the coast of Brazil and gained a large sum of money,Gosse, P: \\"The Pirates' Who's Who Giving Particulars Of The Lives and Deaths Of The Pirates And Buccaneers\\", page 253. Lenox Hill Pub, 1968 even though England and Portugal were at peace at the time. -Blind Kat Publishers The Charles contained large amounts of Brazilian sugar, hides, cloth, guns, gold dust and coins. The loot's total value is estimated at over £10,000 sterling (£ as of ).Quelch' Gold -Summary of the book Quelch's Gold Before their capture, legend says the crew buried some of the gold on Star Island off the coast of New Hampshire. In the 1800s some gold coins were found hidden in a stone wall there. Death When the Charles returned to Marblehead 10 months later, the crewmen scattered with their plunder. Some of the crew sailed with pirate and former privateer Thomas Larimore, who was also captured shortly afterward. Within a week, Quelch was in jail, because the Portuguese were not in his letter of marque and more importantly, Queen Anne and the King of Portugal had just become allies. He and others of his crew were taken to Boston to be tried. This was the first admiralty trial outside England. It was called by one historian \\"the first case of judicial murder in America.\\" On Friday, 30 June 1704, the pirates were marched on foot through Boston to Scarlet's Wharf accompanied by a guard of musketeers, various officials, and two ministers, while in front was carried a silver oar, the emblem of the Lord High Admiral. Upon reaching the gallows, the minister (reportedly Cotton Mather) gave the pirates a long and fervent sermon. All of the pirates showed repentance on their faces except Captain Quelch. Before he was hanged, Quelch stepped up while holding his hat and bowed to the spectators. He also gave a short address and warned them, \\"They should take care how they brought Money into New England to be Hanged for it.\\" Their bodies were buried in between the tide marks. Charles The Charles was an eighty-ton vessel built in Boston between 1701 and 1703. It was owned by some of the most prominent people in Boston and was equipped to go privateering off the coast of Newfoundland and Arcadia. Captain John Quelch Crew Here follows a list of all the known crewmembers aboard the Charles while Quelch was captain. *Austin, James *Breck, John *Carter, Dennis *Carter, John *Chevalle, Daniel *Clifford, John *Chuley, Daniel *Davis, Gabriel *Dorothy, John *Dunbar, Nicholas *Farrington, Thomas *Giddens, Paul *Harwood, John *Holding, Anthony *Hutnot, Joseph *James, Charles *Johnson, Isaac *Jones, William *King, Charles *King, Francis *King, John *Lambert, John *Lawson, Nicholas *Lawrence, Richard *Miller, John *Norton, George *Pierse, George *Perkins, Benjamin *Parrot, James *Pattison, James *Perkins, Benjamin *Peterson, Erasmus *Pitman, John *Pimer, Matthew *Quelch, Captain John *Quittance, John *Rayner, William *Richardson, Nicholas *Roach, Peter *Scudamore, Christopher *Templeton, John *Thurbar, Richard *Whiting, William *Way, John *Wiles, William Of the above, six including Quelch were hanged. More than half the crew escaped capture. Parrot, Clifford, and Pimer had turned Queen's evidence and escaped prosecution. John Templeton was found to be only a servant on the ship and was not even 14, so he was released. Old Roger Old Roger Popular myth has it that John Quelch flew a pirate flag referred to as Old Roger by his crew. It is sometimes considered to be the origin of the name Jolly Roger. It is alleged that his theme was later borrowed by Blackbeard and also Bartholomew \\"Black Bart\\" Roberts. There is no evidence whatsoever that Quelch flew any flag other than the Flag of St. George or possibly a privateer's flag of St. George quartered on a red background similar to today's British merchant colors. Courtroom testimony from the crew maintained that the flag of England had been flown at all times. The origin of this myth of Quelch's flag being described as having \\"in the middle of it an Anatomy with an Hourglass in one hand and a dart in the Heart with three drops of Blood proceeding from it in the other.\\" most likely stems from the poetic license of Ralph D. Paine, a popular writer at the turn of the 20th century. None of the principals involved in the affair, not even the Governor or the prosecution, ever mentioned such colors being employed by Quelch.

While the designation was used from the 18th to 20th century, the administrative division only existed from 1882-1891.Jean Suret-Canele. French Colonialism in Tropical Africa 1900-1945. Trans. Pica Press (1971) pp 87-88. Early usage Since the 18th century, Portuguese, British and French traders had established small stations on the coast which was called Rivières du Sud by the French. The Portuguese had trading stations at Rio Pongo and Rio Nunez, mostly for the purchase of enslaved Africans captured inland and brought to the coast. Subsequently a number of English and American traders also settled in the region. With the establishment of Sierra Leone by British Abolitionists, this area attracted their attention and that of the Christian Missionary Society, which sought to promote Christianity and trading opportunities By 1820, British suppression of the slave trade and Portuguese imperial decline saw these posts abandoned, with British and French traders moving in. The French admiral Bouët-Willaumez made a number of treaties with coastal communities in the area (usually under the threat of force), and ensured Marseilles based trade houses exclusive access to the palm oil trade by the 1840s. Used for making soap, the palm oil trade was with Diola merchants who established markets in the interior, and transported it to the coastal stations. Administrative expansion The French colonial governor of Senegal Louis Faidherbe in the 1850s formalised the colonial structure which was christened Rivières du Sud. In 1854 Guinea ports were placed under control of Naval administration and split from new colonial administration in Saint-Louis, Senegal under the name Gorée and Dependencies. Previously, they had fallen under the naval 'supreme commander in Gabon' of the Establissements francais de la Cote de l'Or et du Gabon. By 1859, Faidherbe's campaigns of conquest on the riverine coast south of Gorée saw the region annexed to the colonial administration, under the arrondissement of Gorée. The Rivières du Sud now referred to the entire region from Sine-Salmon to the border of British Sierra Leone. In 1865 the fort at Boké was built in the Rio Nunez area, expanding from the main French-controlled town of Conakry. Shortly after this, Bayol was taken as a 'protectorate' as well. The Rio Pongo area, nominally held by Germany, was traded to France for their 'rights' to Porto-Seguro and Petit Popo on the Togolese coast.Suret-Canale, Jean. Guinea in the Colonial System, in Essays on African History. Translated, Hurst (1980) pp 111-147. The British formally recognised French control of the area, and the administrative division collecting these possessions was created under the name Rivières du Sud in 1882. Pause The background to these legalistic and administrative manoeuvres was the Berlin conference of 1884 and the \\"loaded pause\\" of French imperial expansion. Domestically, this stemmed from the disastrous French defeat in Tonkin and the collapse of the colonial policy of the Ferry ministry.Virgil L Matthew, Jr. Joseph Simon Gallieni in L.H. Gann and Peter Duignan, African Proconsuls. European Governors in Africa. Free Press/Collier Macmillan and Hoover Institution (1988). European horse-trading followed the Berlin conference, in which foreign powers divided the African continent and attempted to consolidate their own possessions. Rivières du Sud was a formal division which, apart from the coast, had little relation to actual governance until the next decade. Evolution of French administrative division In 1891, Rivières du Sud was placed under the colonial lieutenant governor at Dakar, who had authority over the French coastal regions east to Porto-Novo (modern Benin). Governor general Gallieni, having faced fierce resistance to French expansion on the upper Senegal and Niger basin from the Toucouleur Empire, Samori, and then Mahmadu Lamine's forces, turned the colonial gaze to the Rivières du Sud in the late 1880s, marking a new phase in French expansion. Between 1889 and 1894, Rivières du Sud, Côte d'Ivoire and Dahomey were each successively separated into 'independent' colonies, with Rivières du Sud being renamed the 'Colony of French Guinea'. In 1895 these colonies came under the authority of the governor general of French West Africa, and in 1904, this was formalised into the Afrique Occidentale Française. French Guinea, along with Senegal, Dahomey, Cote-d'Ivoire and Upper Senegal and Niger each were ruled by a lieutenant governor, under the Governor General in Dakar. Futa Jallon opposition The Rivières du Sud colony never extended far from the coast, as the French were unable to conquer the people of the Futa Jallon highlands, running from the south of modern Senegal though the interior of modern Guinea. The Imamate of Futa Jallon was located mainly in present-day Guinea as well as parts of Guinea Bissau, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. A powerful force, it stymied French expansion until 1896 when the French colonial troops defeated the last Almami, Bokar Biro Barry, dismantled the state and integrated it into their colony of French Guinea.

It was built in 1913 and demolished in 1978. It was located on Hennepin Avenue next to the Hennepin Avenue Bridge and across the street from the main Minneapolis Post Office. History An aerial photograph of the depot in the 1950s The station was sometimes called the Minneapolis Union Depot, which actually was the name of the previous station on the opposite side of Hennepin Avenue that had been in use for 30 years. The older Union Depot was razed; today, that site is used for loading docks by the central downtown Minneapolis Post Office. The Stone Arch Bridge was built to serve the original Minneapolis Union Depot, but later provided access to the Great Northern Depot. The Minneapolis BNSF Rail Bridge, an older crossing of the Mississippi River to the north, also served the depot with a cutoff track located on the bridge. The Minneapolis Great Northern Depot was built to serve the railroad empire of James J. Hill. It was constructed at the height of the City Beautiful movement, at a time when Minneapolis was striving to revive the decaying Bridge Square area. The building was designed by Charles Sumner Frost, who had earlier designed the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Depot Freight House and Train Shed, and then later the Saint Paul Union Depot.Lost Twin Cities by Larry Millett. Minnesota Historical Society Press. 1992 Frost had also supervised the construction of the Navy Pier in Chicago and the Maine State Building at the Columbian Exposition of 1893. The Depot was constructed of brick and reinforced concrete. It was faced with light Kettle River sandstone. It was designed in a Beaux-Arts style with a Doric colonnade facing Hennepin Avenue. The train tracks ran Northwest–Southeast along the Mississippi river, under Hennepin Avenue and into a pass-through train shed. Demise and reuse of the depot site Passengers waiting at Minneapolis Great Northern Depot in April 1971 Passenger train service through the depot declined from a peak of 125 daily trains during World War II to just one route when Amtrak began operation in 1971--the Empire Builder. Amtrak opted to consolidate all of its Twin Cities service at the Great Northern Depot, shuttering St. Paul's Union Depot. Traffic rebounded very slightly in following years, as the Arrowhead, North Coast Hiawatha, and Twin Cities Hiawatha entered service, though these sometimes operated as combined trains from Chicago or only served the depot on alternating days. The trains continued to stop at the depot until the Midway station opened in Saint Paul, roughly halfway between downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul, in 1978. The Great Northern Depot was demolished later that year. The area lay vacant and was adjacent to the Berman Buckskin building and the Chicago Great Western railway freight warehouse. All these buildings were torn down to make way for development; the site is occupied by the third and current Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis building. The new Target Field station for the Metro light rail line and Northstar commuter rail line was constructed at the site of Target Field along BNSF Railway's Wayzata Subdivision. It is located five blocks west and two blocks north of the former depot. Trains Arrivals and departures at Minneapolis Great Northern Depot in April 1971, months before Amtrak's takeover of all passenger operations at the station.

The area is known for its prosperity of mineral resources which have for a long time remained unexploited. History Bakouma was founded in September 1892 when the Belgians, led by Commander Balat and Captain Paul Le Marinel set up a military post on the site. It became a part of the French Upper Oubangui in July 1894. Bakouma became a district under the French rule in 1944 and on 23 January 1961, the region eventually became a Sous-Préfecture in the Mboumo prefecture in the newly formed Central African Republic. . The Lengo Petroglyphs are located near Bakouma. In a uranium survey in 1959-1961, phosphatic sediments were discovered near Bakouma. The phosphates are characterized by their high uranium content, which are the highest in sub- Saharan Africa.\\\\- Rocks for Crops: Central African Republic Further feasibility studies showed that in the area, there are 41 million pounds of U3O8 with an average grade of 0.27% (which is almost 20 times higher than the resources in Trekkopje, Namibia). A large concentration of Cretaceous ferruginous limestones has also been found near Bakouma. . However, commercial exploitation in the area never took off. The French Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA) studied the area, as did Alusuisse in the 1970s, which only came to conduct small scale mining. The Japanese in the 1980s came to the conclusion that any large exploitation would not be commercially viable. During the 1990s, former political prisoner Jeanne-Marie Ruth-Rolland was elected deputy leader of Bakouma and lead a gold prospector's consortium. She was also active in diamond mining in the area. Following her death, a monument was elected in her honor. Due to the increasing world market price on uranium, combined with decreasing stocks, the area gained new interest in the mid-2000s. Australian company Paladin Energy expressed its interest in the area, but it never took off. The same thing happened with the Chinese. Finally, in May 2006, the South African company UraMin invested 90% in a Bakouma uranium project. The remaining 10% is held by the Government. A mining convention was signed, guaranteeing fixed taxes for 25 years. The project consists of ten separate areas of uranium mineralization and the consortium has applied for two additional licenses, which, if granted, would extend the project area to 2,900 square kilometres. A feasibility study that started in August 2006 has drilled some 9,400 meters and indicated that the resource is significantly deeper than previous studies have shown. The production is expected to ramp up from late 2009 and peak in 2010 at 3000 tonnes Per Annum. From December 2018 to January 2019 heavy clashes took place in the city between ex-Séléka militias and government forces. Geography and climate Bakouma is situated on the Gboyo River. In is on the northern end of the Mbomou forest, which has an area of 10.000 km². When it became clear that the Government was going to allow for a concession of uranium, many voices were heard, mainly from the opposition, claiming that uranium mining in other countries has created much harm to the environment and the population. The Government claimed that this was the words of evil tongues. It said that the bill on the regulation of exploitation of radioactive minerals, which passed the Parliament on 30 August 2006, would protect from any such damage. UraMin has started to drain the marches on its site. Law and government Although the Government has its representative in Bakouma, the presence of UraMin in the town has attracted visits of several high-level government officials. When UraMin arrived with their first equipment to Bangui, the unloading of the airplane was monitored by the Minister of Mining and Energy, Sylvain Ndoutingaï. When the team later arrived in Bangassou with a second plane, the unloading was monitored by the prefect of Mboumou, Remy Sem Ndouto, along with representatives of the police, the gendarmerie, the customs and the armed forces. The customs was represented by Colonel Yvon Songue.– Le Confident, 1 August 2006 In March 2007, the UraMin site was inspected by the Director for the Ministry of Mining and Energy, Mr Guy Ngaïkomessé. Also present were the Regional Director for Mining, the Assistant Commander of the Mining Brigade, the Commander of the Mboumou Police Force as well as several police and gendarme officers. They found that the UraMin team consisted of six Tanzanians, two Europeans and one Cameroonian. The Tanzanians and the Cameroonian did not have visas for the country and were brought to Bangui for regularisation.– Le Confident, 31 March 2007 Economy 3000 people are expected to be employed by UraMin and the Government has predicted a boom for the whole region. Numerous young men have left Bangassou, Nzako, Irabanda in Haute-Kotto for Bakouma. However, there has been reports that members of the Central African Government has arranged for transport of their own family members and own ethnic groups to Bakouma, to function as manpower in the mining project. This has led to irritation among Bakouma’s original citizens.– Le Confident, 19 February 2007 Prices on food items are said to have exploded since the international mining companies arrived. While the normal price on chicken is said to be 600 or 700 CFA franc, it is now negotiated at between 1500 and 2000 CFA franc. Fish and beef can hardly be found at all.– Le Confident, 6 October 2006 There is a small hydro-power plant on the left bank of Gboyo, which is owned by the Catholic Diocese of Bangassou. The water flows of the river allows electricity production 305 days per year. The electricity is used to feed the mission and its hospital. Transport Bakouma is located about 870 km from Bangui. UraMin, which has its site 7 km outside of Bakouma has invested 0.5 million to upgrade road access, but it is unknown what other roads in the area will be upgraded. The Catholic Diocese of Bangassou has recently upgraded 19 bridges between Bakouma and Nzako. There is an airstrip in Bakouma, close to the uranium exploitation. But when UraMin arrived with its machinery in July 2006, the Antonov freighter had to land at Bangassou, with a considerably longer runway.

Russian Iveco LMV Rys'. The LMV uses modular armour packs to adjust its level of protection to its mission requirements. In regards to mine protection, the vehicle's ground clearance has been increased to 493 mm without increasing the overall height (less than 2 meters); it also uses suspended seats of aeronautical derivation, v-hull under body, and a collapsible sandwich structure in the floor to deflect and absorb mine blasts. Its exhaust is piped through its C-pillars, and its turbocharger is located underneath the engine to reduce its thermal signature. Mobility is helped by a run-flat system, allowing the vehicle to move even with completely deflated tires. It is related to the Fiat Oltre concept car unveiled in 2005. The LMV was designed in the 1990s and the first LMVs were produced in 2001 while the British Panthers were produced between 2006 and 2009. Variants Panther CLV The Panther Command and Liaison Vehicle or Panther CLV is the British Army variant of the Iveco LMV. The Panther CLV came from the \\"Future Command and Liaison Vehicle\\" (FCLV) project. Design modifications were made by BAE Systems to allow assembly at BAE Systems Land Systems' factory in Newcastle upon Tyne. While the Panther seats four people, the VTLM Lince seats five. Over 300 Panthers were assembled at BAE Systems factory in Newcastle upon Tyne under a £160 million contract. It is intended that the Panther will replace vehicles including Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (tracked) (CVRT), FV 432, Saxon and Land Rover Truck Utility Medium (TUM). The armour protection is tuneable by the replacement of armour packs within the vehicle's external skin. The basic add-on armour pack provides ballistic protection against small arms fire and a heavier kit provides protection against heavy weapons to including mines. Panther Command and Liaison Vehicles (CLV) are equipped with Enforcer RCWS weapons stations which were developed by SELEX Galileo. The weapons station can be armed with a 7.62mm or 12.7mm machine gun or a 40mm automatic grenade launcher. The first Panthers were delivered to the 1st Mechanised Brigade (United Kingdom) and a small number underwent hot weather trials in Afghanistan. At end of April 2018, the UK Defence Equipment Sales Authority has put the entire Panther 4x4 fleet up for sale with 395 vehicles available. Other variants The LMV is available in two different wheelbases, and . A two-door, two seater is also available. Since 2015, LMV production has featured a host of improvements: these include a more powerful 220 hp (164 kW) diesel engine coupled to a new eight-speed automatic transmission, an upgraded drive line for higher performance and a new air filtration system. The payload of the LMV has been increased by some 40 per cent and it is now fitted with new specially designed suspension units and recently developed all-terrain tyres for a higher level of cross-country mobility. A key feature of the latest LMV batch of improvements is that they can be backfitted to the entire legacy LMV fleet to enhance their capabilities. The internal layout of the LMV has also been redesigned for greater crew comfort, with new seats, a next-generation dashboard and an upgraded hardtop.

To date, over 60,000 items have been posted on the archive and are viewable through either a keyword search or browsing by subject. Each item also has its own record which, in many cases, includes any history or commentary on the item being viewed. Items date back to the 1840s when Schaumburg Township was first surveyed. In addition to the digital archive, the library also maintains a blog on the History of Schaumburg Township (HOST). History The library dates to 1962 when local voters approved a tax funding mechanism. Its collection was initially located in a small home until a dedicated facility was constructed four years later. After a second referendum increasing library funding passed in 1970, the library opened branches in Hoffman Estates and Hanover Park. The central library moved into its current building in 1998. Departments Being the second largest public library in Illinois, the main branch is broken up into the following departments: *Audiovisual *Circulation *Computer Assistance *New Books and Fiction *Non-Fiction and Reference *Youth Services *Teen Center There are more departments in STDL, including Extension Services, Graphics, Public Relations, and IT.

It is located near the administrative border of three oblasts, Lviv, Rivne, and Ternopil. Population: Description Rock of Pidkamin Dominican Monastery today belongs to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (till 2010) Polish coat of arms The village takes its name (translatable into English as \\"below the rock\\") from an inselberg called the \\"Devil's Rock\\", which is located on an adjacent hill. Pidkamin became known for a Dominican monastery. It was established by twelve monks from a monastery established by Saint Hyacinth in Kyiv who were forced to flee from the city when it was ravaged by Mongols (in 1240). Prior Urban and 12 monks were martyred by Tatars in 1245. In the second half of the 15th century wasteland around the place where the monastery had been, was in possession of nobleman Petrus Cebrovscii who founded the town. With his assistance on the mountain was built a castle, rebuilt Roman Catholic church. Knowing the stories about being here before the Dominican monastery, he went to Lviv archbishop asking that he sent to Pidkamin monks. Monastery was reestablished in 1464 by the Latin Archbishop of Lviv Gregory of Sanok, who himself came to the feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary monks came to the Roman church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, St Cross, Peter and Paul and all the saints. In 1519 after the devastation Pidkamin passed in possession nobleman Marcin Kamenecki. In the 17th century a fortified abbey was constructed. Pidkamin hosted a miraculous icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary (a copy of the famous Protectress of the Roman People from the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome), crowned in 1727 by the Latin Rite bishop of Lutsk Stefan Rupniewski, assisted by other Roman Catholic and Greek Catholic bishops, with a crown conferred by Pope Benedict XIII. After the region came under Austrian rule in 1772 the monastery suffered from the policies of Emperor Joseph II, and although saved by the emperor's death, it never regained its former significance. In 1915, Pidkamin was largely destroyed by Russian artillery. The icon was again crowned in 1927 by the Latin Rite Metropolitan of Lviv Bolesław Twardowski and in 1959 by the Cardinal Primate of Poland Stefan Wyszyński. During the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia, Pidkamin was a shelter for Poles, who escaped there to hide in the monastery. Some 2,000 people, the majority of whom were women and children, were living there when the monastery was attacked in mid-March 1944, by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, cooperating with the Ukrainian SS. Around 300 Poles were murdered in the monastery, and additional 500 were killed in the town of Pidkamin itself.Grzegorz Motyka, Ukraińska Partyzantka 1942-1960, Warszawa 2006 In the nearby village of Palikrovy, 300 Poles were killed, 20 in Maliniska and 16 in Chernytsia. Armed Ukrainian groups destroyed the monastery, stealing all valuables, except for the monastery's crowned icon. After World War II the icon was removed from Pidkamin to rescue it from communists and today remains in the Dominican church of St Adalbert in Wrocław, Poland. In 1946 the monastery was closed by the Soviets and turned into a jail. Among the inmates was the Blessed Priest and Martyr Nicholas Tsehelskyj. Later the monastery was used as psychiatric hospital, which still exists, and the church was turned into a stable. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the emergence of independent Ukraine, the ruins of the monastery were given to Ukrainian Greek Catholic Studite Brethren. From 1940 to 1959 Pidkamin was an administrative center of Pidkamin Raion.

Biography Cunningham went up to St John's College, Cambridge in 1899 and graduated Senior Wrangler in 1902, winning the Smith's Prize in 1904. In 1904, as a lecturer at the University of Liverpool, he began work on a new theorem in relativity with fellow lecturer Harry Bateman. They brought the methods of inversive geometry into electromagnetic theory with their transformations (spherical wave transformation): :Each four- dimensional solution [to Maxwell's equations] could then be inverted in a four-dimensional hypersphere of pseudo-radius K in order to produce a new solution. Central to Cunningham's paper was the demonstration that Maxwell's equations retained their form under these transformations.Warwick, page 423. He worked with Karl Pearson in 1907 at University College London. Cunningham married Ada Collins in 1908. In August 1911 he returned to St John's College where he made his career. When drafted for the war in 1915 he did alternative service growing food and in an office at the YMCA. He held a university lectureship from 1926 to 1946. His book The Principle of Relativity (1914) was one of the first treatises in English about special relativity, along with those by Alfred Robb and Ludwik Silberstein. He followed with Relativity and the Electron Theory (1915) and Relativity, Electron Theory and Gravitation (1921). McCrea writes that Cunningham had doubts whether general relativity produced \\"physical results adequate return for mathematical elaboration.\\" He was an ardent pacifist, strongly religious, a member of Emmanuel United Reformed Church, Cambridge and chairman of the Congregational Union of England and Wales for 1953–54.

Ultimately, Gregory Millar became the full-time resident conductor and music director. His tenure saw the introduction of many long-standing programs, including children's concerts, concerts in other locales in southwest Michigan, and the Art Center recitals by KSO musicians. The first of the popular \\"Starlight\\" summer concert series came in 1962; the concerts featured popular musicians like Louis Armstrong and were held on the roof of the Gilmore parking garage in downtown Kalamazoo. Millar's tenure was succeeded by Pierre Hetu in 1968 and Yoshimi Takeda in 1974. Maestro Takeda's 25-year tenure as Music Director and Conductor saw the KSO establish its high level of musicality. The current Music Director, Raymond Harvey, was appointed in 1999.

AIDS Walk AIDS Walk is a walkathon fundraiser that raises money to combat the AIDS epidemic. Since 1985, AIDS Walk Los Angeles has drawn hundreds of thousands of supporters to walk, and millions more to donate, raising more than $90 million to combat HIV and AIDS in Los Angeles. The funds raised at the event remain a vital lifeline that sustains APLA Health’s care, prevention, and advocacy programs for those living with HIV in Los Angeles County. Proceeds also benefit more than 20 other HIV/AIDS service organizations that are able to participate and raise funds through the Community Coalition Initiative (CCI).https://aidswalkla.org/our-story/  About  Event Each year AIDS Walk Los Angeles opens registration during Pride Month--when LGBTQ+ communities and supporters stand together to celebrate and advocate for inclusiveness and civil rights. Individuals and Teams can register at no cost and fundraise for the pioneer fundraising walk that raises vital funds and builds support and awareness of the continuing need to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In a typical AIDS Walk, participants walk a predetermined route (usually 5 or 10 kilometers long) through a city or town. Many AIDS Walks have team programs that encourage organizations such as churches, schools, and corporations to participate together. In 2019, AIDS Walk Los Angeles was managed in-house by APLA Health, which has been the beneficiary of the walk since its inception. The theme for the 2019 event “AIDS Has Met Its March,” calls upon participants to continue the fight to make AIDS history. The walk is approximately four miles and starts and ends at the steps of Los Angeles City Hall and takes about two hours to complete. The morning kicks off with an aerobic warm-up, followed by opening ceremonies featuring celebrities, musical performances, and HIV/AIDS activists and leaders. A post-walk celebration congratulates walkers, volunteers and supporters.https://aidswalkla.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/06/AWLA-2019-Press-Release-FINAL-VERSION-6-13-19.pdf Fundraising Fundraising models vary from event to event, but most AIDS Walks encourage participants to raise money by collecting pledges from their friends, family, and co-workers. Some events have a required minimum amount or registration fee, but for many events fundraising is voluntary. Volunteering An AIDS Walk event will usually be produced with the help of volunteers. Typically, an AIDS Walk volunteer will assist on an assortment of projects. Some of these projects could include: direct mailing pieces are sent out to registrants, creating fund-raising packages, phone-banking past participants and volunteers to continue their efforts, and many other tasks as needed. On the day of the event, volunteers can number in the thousands and might perform many different (and necessary) tasks. Volunteers might hand out refreshments to participants, cheer and direct participants along the route and throughout the AIDS Walk venue, assist lost children and other participants, assist \\\\the event, assist with communication throughout the venue, and even escort celebrities, elected leaders and other invited guests throughout the day.  History  On July 28, 1985, AIDS Project Los Angeles held the world's first AIDS Walk, with the hope to raise $100,000. Three days prior, actor Rock Hudson publicly announced he had AIDS on July 25, 1985. As one of the first mainstream celebrities to have been diagnosed with the disease, the news of Hudson’s diagnosis shook the HIV/AIDS and LGBTQ communities in Los Angeles but also surged a tide of 4,500 walkers to participate in the first AIDS Walk Los Angeles at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. The walk surpassed its goal, raising $673,000 and ignited a movement to eradicate the disease. Today, the need to eradicate HIV/AIDS is still with us. APLA Timeline  Support  Community-based activism is the cornerstone of organizing an AIDS Walk event. Over the course of the epidemic, there have been many supporters of these events. Celebrities, elected leaders, corporations, religious organizations and churches, schools and universities account for some of entities that have supported AIDS Walks throughout the world.  Criticism  As with many charity fundraisers, critics have often questioned where the money goes and the level of transparency.

The name Dianmu is the name of the goddess of thunder and lightning in Chinese folklore. Dianmu formed on June 13 and moved west-northwest where it rapidly strengthened to typhoon status on June 16. Dianmu then strengthened to a 285 km/h (180 mph) typhoon, making it one of nine typhoons to reach that intensity since 1990 and equaled its power with Typhoon Chaba as the strongest typhoons of the 2004 season. After reaching peak intensity, Dianmu turned northwest before skirting the minor Japanese islands and making landfall in Japan as a tropical storm. Dianmu then became extratropical on June 21. Dianmu caused four fatalities and considerable damage across southern and eastern Japan. Damage amounted to US$68.3 million. Two more fatalities were also reported in neighboring South Korea. Meteorological history An area of disturbed weather formed on June 11 within a monsoon trough southeast of Palau. Satellite imagery showed the disturbance beginning to acquire a low level circulation as the system was within a favorable area for tropical development. As the system began to strengthen, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its first warning on the system as it strengthen to a tropical depression on June 13. Moving westward, Tropical Depression 09W continued to strengthen and on June 14, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the depression to tropical storm status. After becoming a tropical storm, Dianmu remained stationary west of Yap where it continued to strengthen. The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the storm to typhoon status at 1373 UTC. while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the storm to typhoon status at 1800 UTC. Dianmu then moved north-northwestward at speeds between 6-9 kts (11–17 km/h, 7-10 mph) as it winds reached 241 km/h (150 mph), prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center to upgrade the storm to supertyphoon status on June 15. The following day, Dianmu continued northward as the storm reached category 5 status. At the same time, the storm entered the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) area of responsibility and was given the name Helen. Typhoon Dianmu on June 18 Dianmu reached its maximum intensity as its winds reached up to 285 km/h (180 mph) and the barometric pressure fell to 915 millibars. The JMA assessed the typhoon attaining a 10-minute peak of 185 km/h (115 mph) winds. After maintaining Supertyphoon status for 42 hours, the storm began to weaken as it swung westward. The typhoon briefly regained supertyphoon status on June 18 before finally weakening again a few hours later. The next day, Dianmu swung northward as the center was located southeast of Okinawa. As it turned northward, dry air entered the storm causing the center to become ragged and eventually resulted in the storm weakening further as the winds dropped to on June 19. On June 20, the center of Dianmu bypassed Okinawa by to the east as the storm continued to weaken. Satellite imagery showed the storm losing its deep convection and significant outflow and its winds dropped to 145 km/h (90 mph). As the storm approached Japan, it interacted with a trough which was position northwest of the storm. The resulting interaction with the trough caused the storm to drop below typhoon status. As the storm edged closer to Japan, it began to gradually take on the characteristics of an extratropical cyclone before it made its first landfall in Shikoku before making its second landfall in Honshū on June 21. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued its final advisory on Dianmu at 1800 UTC while the JMA continued to issue advisories until June 23. The extratropical remnants of Dianmu then dissipated over the Bering Sea on June 25. Preparations Because Dianmu was very close to the islands of Yap and Palau, the National Weather Service began issuing advisories. As Dianmu moved northwestward away from the islands, the advisories were discontinued on June 14. In Okinawa, the approach of Dianmu caused residents to stock up on supplies as all U.S. military bases were put under a Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness level three (TCCOR). In Kadena Air Base, military crewmen stowed or secured lightweight equipment. The approach of Typhoon Dianmu resulted in the cancellation of numerous incoming and outgoing flights and ferry service. In mainland Japan, 130 flights and passenger rail service was canceled, many homes were evacuated, and schools were closed. In South Korea, meteorologists at the Daegu Meteorological Administration and the government of South Korea issued torrential rain advisories as the outer rain bands of the typhoon was forecast to produce heavy rainfall. In addition, internal flights in South Korea were canceled. Impact Typhoon Dianmu approaching Japan on June 20 Dianmu affected the island of Yap which was still recovering after the impact of Typhoon Sudal. The storm produced heavy rainfall, rough seas and gale-force winds but did little damage. A weather station in Yap reported a 95 km/h (59 mph) gust. Dianmu then brushed past Ulithi Atoll dropping 102.8 mm (4.01 inches) of rain over the atoll. A weather station in Palau reported 121.7 mm (4.76 inches) of rain from the Dianmu's passage. Overall, there were no reported damage from Dianmu's impact on the Ulithi Atoll, Yap or Palau. Several stations in Okinawa and other Japanese islands reported sustained winds of at least tropical storm force. A weather station in Okinawa reported the highest sustained winds of 104 km/h (64 mph). Another weather station in Kochi reported a wind gust of 206 km/h (128 mph) during Dianmus passage. One fatality was reported in Okinawa when a surfer drowned in the rough seas. In mainland Japan, Dianmu brought strong winds and heavy rainfall across southern, central and eastern portions of the country. A weather station in Owase recorded a 24‑hour rainfall total of 207.5 mm (8.14 inches). In Cape Muroto, a weather station reported winds gusting to 177 km/h (110 mph). High winds from Dianmu damaged power lines which left 25,000 residents without electricity. The landfall of Dianmu also disrupted oil and crude shipments. Elsewhere in Japan, Dianmu damaged or destroyed 79 homes and flooded 18 others. Damage in Japan amounted to 6.85 billion JPY ($68 million 2004 USD, $73 million 2006 USD), mostly agricultural damage. Dianmu's outer rainbands dropped heavy rainfall across southern and eastern parts of South Korea. A weather station in Jeju Island reported 295.5 mm (11.6 inches); another weather stations in South Korea recorded 150 - 184.7 mm (5.9 - 7.2 inches) of rain. The heavy rainfall from Dianmu resulted in moderate flash flooding as the rainfall caused the Nakdonggang River to overflow its banks. The floodwaters left two people dead and four more missing.

Life The grave of prof George Jardine, Glasgow Cathedral churchyard He was born in 1742 at Wandel in Lanarkshire where his predecessors had resided for nearly two hundred years. His mother was a daughter of Weir of Birkwood, in the parish of Lesmahagow. Jardine was transferred in October 1760 from the parish school to Glasgow College, and after passing through the arts and divinity courses (MA 1765), was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Linlithgow. In 1770 he went to Paris as tutor to the sons of William Mure of Caldwell, who obtained for him from David Hume introductions to Helvetius and D'Alembert. Soon after his return from France in July 1773, he failed to secure election to the chair of humanity at Glasgow, by a single vote, but in June 1774 was appointed professor of Greek and assistant professor in logic. In 1787 he became sole professor of logic. Jardine gave a practical turn to the teaching of his chair, and established a system of daily examination. His classes rose from an average of fifty to nearly two hundred. He expounded his principles of teaching in his Outlines of Philosophical Education, published at Glasgow, 1818; 2nd edit. 1825. He was also an administrator and brought the finances of the college to order. Jardine created the introductory college course, which presented new or difficult material in small and digestible pieces rather than as a single imposing system that students had to either understand or fail. Jardine also insisted that lectures be interspersed with regular examinations, in order to gauge the students’ progress, and on which students had to write themes or original essays. His Outlines of Philosophical Education, Illustrated by the Method of Teaching the Logic Class at the University of Glasgow became one of the most popular textbooks in American higher education. It explained how to create a stimulating intellectual atmosphere in the classroom and lecture hall. It created a system of “writing across the curriculum,” as it would later be called, with compositions, essays, and research papers assigned in every class and at every level, which taught students how to think for themselves, but also how to write clear, incisive, original English prose.Herman, How Scots Invented the Modern World (Three Rivers Press, 2001, p. 391 He had a country house, Hallside (near Cambuslang and modern-day Drumsagard Village) constructed in 1790.Country Houses of the old Glasgow gentry – Hallside House He was one of the founders in 1792, and afterwards for more than twenty years secretary, of Glasgow Royal Infirmary. For over thirty years he was the representative of the presbytery of Hamilton in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. He retired from the chair of logic in 1824, and died on 27 January 1827. He is buried in the Lindsay plot on the north side of the churchyard around Glasgow Cathedral. Family In 1776 Jardine married Janet Lindsay, daughter of John Lindsay, founder in Glasgow. She died in 1815. They had one son, John Jardine, advocate, who held the office of sheriff of Ross and Cromarty, and died in 1850. They are both buried with him.

He was a recognised authority on mushrooms, and also described new species of ferns, bryophytes, and seed plants.  Life and career  Batsch was born in Jena, Saxe-Weimar to George Lorenz Bratsch and Ernestine (nee Franke) Bratsch. He studied at the Jena City School, and then had private tuition. He showed an aptitude for natural sciences and drawing, and so subsequently studied medicine and philosophy at the University of Jena (now known as the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena), entering in 1772 and obtaining his doctorate in philosophy in 1781Verein der Familie Batsch e.V. (German) and in medicine in 1786, his supervisor being Justus Christian Loder. Batsch was married in 1787 to Amalie Pfaundel. They had three children, Friedrich (born 1789), George Friedrich Karl (1792), and Karoline (1795). He died in 1802 after a short illness. In 1786 Batsch began to teach natural history at the University of Jena and in 1787 he was appointed associate professor of medicine and botany. In 1792 he became Professor of Philosophy. He advised Johann Wolfgang von Goethe on his botanical research. Batsch's organization of plants in progressive forms may have influenced Goethe's thinking on the transmutation of species.

Roberts Stable is a renovated former barn in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Illinois, United States. The building has a long history of remodeling work including an 1896 transformation by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The stable remodel was commissioned by Charles E. Roberts, a patron of Wright's work, the same year Wright worked on an interior remodel of Roberts' House. The building was eventually converted into a residence by Charles E. White, Jr., a Wright-associated architect, sources vary as to when this occurred but the house was moved from its original location to its present site in 1929. The home is cast in the Tudor Revival style but still displays the architectural thumbprint of Wright's later work. The building is listed as a contributing property to a federally designated U.S. Registered Historic District. History Charles E. Roberts was an engineer, inventor and important early client of Frank Lloyd Wright.Frank Lloyd Wright: An Autobiography, by Frank Lloyd Wright, p. 383 Roberts was an influential member of the building committee of Unity Temple in Oak Park.Frank Lloyd Wright: An Autobiography, by Frank Lloyd Wright, pp. 153, 158 For Roberts, Wright also developed the Quadruple Block Plan of 1900-1903.Frank Lloyd Wright and His Vision of the Future, by Franz Sdoutz Some architectural historians have mistakenly identified Charles E. Roberts as the father of Oak Park Studio architect Isabel Roberts.The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, by William Allin Storer, Second Edition, p. 150 As has been well documented, Isabel's father was James H. Roberts of South Bend, Indiana. In 1896 Charles E. Roberts, an established patron of Frank Lloyd Wright, commissioned two jobs by the architect. One was the Charles E. Roberts House, for which Wright executed an interior remodel, and the other was the Charles E. Roberts Stable.\\"Charles E Roberts House,\\" (PDF), Oak Park Landmark Nomination Form, HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved 14 June 2007. Wright redesigned the structure from an old barn into a garage for Roberts' electric car.O'Gorman, Thomas J. Frank Lloyd Wright's Chicago, Thunder Bay Press, San Diego: 2004, pp. 100-103, (). The building was eventually converted into a residence by architect Charles E. White, Jr., Roberts' son-in-law and an employee in Wright's studio in the years 1903-1905. Sources greatly vary on the date of White's conversion. The village of Oak Park's landmark nomination form for Wright's other Roberts project, the patron's home, dates White's conversion of the garage into a residence at 1929, the year when the structure was physically moved from its original location to its present location. Historian Thomas O'Gorman, while noting the 1929 move, states that the Wright- redesigned barn conversion was altered into a dwelling between 1903 and 1904. O'Gorman connects White's remodel to the thorough overhaul the building experienced under Wright's creative control. Architecture The view of the front (east) elevation is obscured by foliage during warmer months. The house elicits in its viewer a distinct \\"English feel.\\" Indeed, through its many remodelings the building is cast in the Tudor Revival style of architecture. The structure displays a steeply pitched, side gabled roof, rounded bay and half-timbering, all common elements of the Tudor Revival style. Other 1890s Wright-designed buildings also displayed a connection to traditional domestic architecture styles. The house has a vertical upsweep which projects a sense of shelter and safety associated with the broad, overhanging eaves found in Wright's roof designs. White carried Wright's design a step further in his remodel, but Wright's architectural aplomb is still evident in the structure. The home expresses a familial coziness, common to Wright's later early modern Prairie homes. The entire idea of barn conversion was an architectural advance in the late 19th century. Wright's work on the stable introduced angularity and converted it from a barn to a building which conveyed a meld of country charm and modernity. O'Gorman compares the home to those designed by architect Edwin Lutyens. The prominent roof features second-story dormers, and its massive scale is balanced by Wright's placement of towering chimneys at either end of the house. The home's front facade is obscured by bushes, trees and landscaping during the warmer months, and the home is best viewed in autumn or winter.\\"Charles E.

Some of his most successful work was done in association with leading television magician Mark Wilson. They worked on the television show The Magic Land of Allakazam, which was sponsored by Kellogg's cereal, and aired on CBS every Saturday from October 1st 1960 then moved to ABC in 1962. Early life Wakeling was born in Hollywood, California, but at an early age went to live with his grandparents in Winslow, Arizona, where he grew up during the Great Depression. He took an interest in magic at an early age as the result of seeing travelling magicians who passed through the small town. One that left a particular impression was J. B. Bobo, who performed at his school. In addition he was inspired by finding the work of 19th century magic expert Professor Hoffmann in his local library. Wakeling then began performing magic with improvised props. His family returned to Los Angeles in 1938 and Wakeling later studied drama at the University of Southern California. Career Following university, Wakeling did some acting but continued to seek a career in magic. He worked as a demonstrator at two magic shops in Los Angeles, the Thayer Magic Company and the Magic House of Charles. He was also employed by magic inventor and manufacturer Merv Taylor. A chance meeting with magician Roy Benson in the early 1940s gave Wakeling the beginnings on an idea for a routine with billiard balls, which later became something of a signature piece for him. For a while he did an act with long-time friend Marvyn Roy, who later went on to be known as \\"Mr Electric\\". Wakeling gradually became a regular performer at clubs in the Los Angeles area, doing a range of acts with titles such as \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" and \\"Hollywood Cowboy\\" as well as the \\"Fan Act\\", which he began performing with his soon-to-be wife Helen shortly before they were married. Wakeling worked as a performing magician until 1966 when he began a behind-the-scenes job with Mark Wilson, who had recently become famous across America for transforming magic into a successful format for network television. He was Wilson's creative director for many years, contributing to Wilson's television shows, including Magic Circus, as well as to live productions in Las Vegas and major venues around the world. He also contributed to the work of other famous magicians including Channing Pollock, John Daniel, Marvyn Roy, Norm Nielsen, Dick Zimmerman, Peter Reveen and Earl Nelson. Channing Pollock said of him: \\"Alan is a one-of-a-kind genius. I see him as one of the best kept secrets in magic, someone who was so good at what he accomplished that you’d want to keep him a secret\\". Among Wakeling's inventions is at least one distinctive version of the Sawing a woman in half effect. One version of this illusion, which bears his name, takes certain elements of the first ever sawing trick performed by P.T. Selbit and incorporates them into a new and very effective illusion. However, while Wakeling performed and perfected that variant of the effect, the origins of the so-called \\"Wakeling Sawing\\" have been attributed to another magician Virgil Harris Mulkey (aka The Great Virgil), who first performed it in 1942. A version that is fully attributed to Wakeling is the \\"Double sawing in half\\" routine for Channing Pollock. Among the illusions he devised for Mark Wilson were Backstage, Girl Through Glass, The Spiker, and Excalibur. He was also responsible for Wilson's \\"Circus Act\\" routine, which involved the Gorilla crush illusion. Wakeling died peacefully on 10 November 2004 in hospital in his hometown of Westlake Village, California and his memorial was held at The Magic Castle in Hollywood, California.

These county roads are found in every county of Florida. History The county road system was created in 1977 as a result of the Florida Department of Transportation changing the division of roads from secondary state roads, which were at one time primary state roads, to county roads. Most secondary roads and some primary roads were given to the counties, and occasionally a new state road was taken over; some main roads in incorporated areas were given to the localities. As a result of how the county road system was created, county roads generally follow the same numbering grid pattern as the state roads. Signage The secondary signs had the S changed to C (for county) and a small “COUNTY” sticker added to the bottom. As signs grew old, they were replaced with the standard county road pentagon marker from the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

Well known in the Mouride Brotherhood, Ibrahima Fall established the influential Baye Fall movement. Neil Savishinsky (1994) contends that Sheikh Ibrahima Fall is “one of the first and most illustrious of Ahmadu Bamba’s disciples”.Savishinsky, J. N.

Touba’, Bimestriel Islamique d’Informations Générales. Retrieved May 25, 2007 from Cheikh Ibra Fall at www.metissacana.sn Ibrahima Fall catalysed the Mouride movement. Fall led all the labour work in the Mouride brotherhood. Fall reshaped the relation between Mouride Talibes (Mouride disciples) and their guide, Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke. Fall instituted the culture of work among Mourides with his concept of Dieuf Dieul “you reap what you sow”. Serigne Bassirou Mbacké, son of Sheikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, claims that Ibrahima Fall renovated the Mouride Brotherhood.Mbacké, S. B. (1995) Intineraires du Bienfait (K. Mbacké, Trans.) Dakar, Senegal: Imprimerie Saint Paul According to Mbacké, Ibrahima Fall introduced giving money to Aamadu Bàmba. Mourides follow this practice of giving money to their sheikh. Serigne Moussa Kâ understands that “Fall initiated devoting ones life to his Sheikh in search of aura (Wolof tarbiya).Kâ, S. M.

C. (1980). La Confrérie mouride: organisation politique et mode d’implentation urbaine. Lyon  Origins  Ibrahima Fall belonged to an aristocratic Wolof family from Cayor. A scholar confirms that Fall came out of an animistically influenced Muslim tradition, but believes Fall's family was nevertheless prosperous and traditionally powerful in Cayor. Other sources contend that Fall's grandfather, the Damel Dethialaw, was a ruler of the Cayor kingdom.  Family and education  Ibrahima Fall was born around 1855 in a northern village, Ndiaby Fall, Cayor. His original tyeddo name was Yapsa Khanth Fall. Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke later gave him the name Ibrahima Fall. Ibrahima Fall was a son of Amadou Rokhaya Fall and Seynabou Ndiaye. At an early age, Ibrahima Fall learned the Qur'an in a neighbouring village, Ndiaré. Fall achieved major Arabic sciences such as theology, fiqh, tafsir, grammar and rhetoric. Savishinsky (1994) tells us that Ibrahima Fall had “reputation for ferocity and extraordinary strength” (p. 212). Another scholar claims that Fall was viewed as a troubled man who seldom went with his peers and often remained alone in the bush. However, all agree that the turning point of his life was Fall's search for Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke.  In Search of Aamadu Bàmba  One major study of Ibrahima Fall reports that two versions exist of his search for Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba. In the first version, Fall is rich merchant who travelled in Cayor, Jolof and Saloum. But after meeting Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke in Mbacké Bari, Fall gave up business to become Bamba's disciple. In the second version, which is more commonly believed in Senegal, Ibrahima Fall in 1882 went on looking to Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke. Scholars state that Ibrahima Fall knew that his destiny dictated him to search for him. Without any knowledge of him, Ibrahima Fall went on looking for the best Muslim teachers. Ibrahima Fall tested Serigne Massamba Syll and after Serigne Adama Gueye. Adama Gueye conducted Ibrahima Fall through mystic ways to Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke in 1883.  Pact with Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke  The encounter between Ibrahima Fall and Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke defined the beginning of Mouridism. Savishinsky claims “Fal (Ibra Faal) performed his obeisance to Ahmadu Bamba in crown-slave style disrobing and falling forward to the ground.\\" Serigne Bassirou (1995) narrates the famous speech that Ibrahima Fall and Ahmadou Bamba exchanged: Ibrahima Fall: “If I found only your gravestone, be aware that the force of my intention would satisfy my objective” Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba: “If I found only the stars and the sky that Muhammad watched at, I’m sure that I could attain my objective with my strong love of the prophet [...] Know that from this life, I’ll neither protect you from sun nor provide you material goods. I accept you if you follow God recommendations”. In this way, the contract started between Fall and Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke. Ibrahima Fall became his 40th disciple. From this moment, Fall followed the Ndiguel \\"orders\\" of the Shaikh until Fall's death.  Introduction of Mouride Values  Within this contract called “Diebelou”, Savishinsky claims that Ibrahima Fall displayed an absolute, slave-like devotion to his master. His “pastef” (courage and devotion) served example for all Mourides. In fact, Fall started “growing food, cutting firewood, fetching water and building shelters and mosques” (p. 213). Likewise, Serigne Moussa Kâ tells us that Fall reshaped quickly the relation between a disciple and his guide. Ibrahima Fall instituted five rules of deference to the Sheikh: # Never stand at the same level than Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke # Never greet the Shaikh with your hat on your head # Never walk in front of him # Always do the “sudiot” (kiss his hands) with the Shaikh # Always lower your voice in front of him Ibrahima Fall himself supervised these rules.  Physical Description  In appearance, Ibrahima Fall had matted locks. Fall carried a black cudgel especially for making people respecting these rules. Fall also smoked a Western African plant called “pone”. Moussa Kâ claims that Fall often begged in neighbour villages with a wood bowl, which was an unorthodox practice. When Mame Chiekh Ibra Fall was taking a haircut, S.Touba told him not to take a haircut today, because it is not a day to take a haircut and he didn't take a haircut because he didn't have permission.  Contribution to Aamadu Bàmba's mission  In 1890, Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba nominated Fall the third responsible in the Mouride Brotherhood. Fall had to supervise all manual works. With the exile of Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, Fall's life changed. He moved to Saint-Louis, Senegal, to defend the innocence of his Shaikh. During Fall's negotiations with the French, Paul Marty recognised that Fall hid great intelligence. Another scholar cites the multiple Arabic poetries of Ibrahima Fall to prove Fall's intellectualism. Fall wrote also an Arabic book, Jazbul Mouride.  Exile of Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke  On 21 September 1895, the French exiled Aamadu Bàmba to Gabon.Hizbut (2006). Retrieved June 07, 2007 from Aamadu Bàmba ordered Ibrahima Fall to work for Sherif Hassan. He did so until 1901, when Sherif Hassan died. In this interval (1895–1901), Fall kept sending money (in Wolof “Adiya”) to the Shaikh until his return in 1902. On 11 November 1902, Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke returned to Senegal and awarded Ibrahima Fall the degree of Sheikh.  Return of Aamadu Bàmba  In June 1912, the French kept Aamadu Bàmba under house arrest in Ndjarèem, Diourbel.Mame Cheikh Ibrahima Fall(2006). Le travail voie royale d'acces au paradis. Retrieved June 07, 2007 from http://mapage.noos.fr/alkhidmat/ibra.html Consequently, Sheikh Ibrahima Fall followed him to Diourbel. In Diourbel, Fall created a famous district, Keur Sheikh. In Keur Sheikh, the Baye Fall movement consolidated and expanded very quickly. Many tyeddos became his disciples. In 1925, the French banned construction of the Touba Mosque. Sheikh Ibrahima Fall enclosed the area of the mosque with timbers Fall carried from Ndjarèem to Touba. In 1927, at the death of Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, Sheikh Ibrahima Fall performed among the first obeisance to the Shaikh's son, Serigne Moustapha Mbacké. Sheikh Ibrahima Fall participated in the difficult creation of the railroads between Diourbel and Touba. Sheikh Ibrahima Fall died 9 June 1930 after helping the succession of Aamadu Bàmba. He lies in Touba.Mouride, (2005). Cheikh Ibrahima Fall: l’homme du labeur Retrieved May 25, 2007 from  Recognition by the Mouride Brotherhood  Sheikh Ibrahima Fall obviously helped Shaikh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke to expand Mouridism, particularly with Fall's establishment of the Baye Fall movement.

The approach was developed by United Nations Children's Fund and the World Health Organization in 1995. It includes both preventive components on the part of families and communities, as well as curative actions to be taken by health workers. It also has an objective to help improve health systems. Inequalities of child health Although the annual number of deaths among children less than five years old has decreased by almost a third since the 1970s, this reduction has not been evenly distributed throughout the world. According to the 1999 World Health Report, children in low- to middle-income countries are 10 times more likely to die before reaching age five than children living in the industrialized world. In 1998, more than 50 countries still had childhood mortality rates of over 100 per 1,000 live births. Every year more than 10 million children in these countries die before they reach their fifth birthday. Seven in 10 of these deaths are due to acute respiratory infections (mostly pneumonia), diarrhea, measles, malaria, or malnutrition – and often to a combination of these conditions Rationale for an evidence-based syndromic approach to case management Many well-known prevention and treatment strategies have already proven effective for saving young lives. Childhood vaccinations have successfully reduced deaths due to measles. Oral rehydration therapy has contributed to a major reduction in diarrhea deaths. Effective antibiotics have saved millions of children with pneumonia. Prompt treatment of malaria has allowed more children to recover and lead healthy lives. Even modest improvements in breastfeeding practices have reduced childhood deaths. Many of these interventions have been summed up into 16 key family practices. While each of these interventions has shown great success, accumulating evidence suggests that a more integrated approach to managing sick children is needed to achieve better outcomes. Child health programmes need to move beyond single diseases to addressing the overall health and well-being of the child. Because many children present with overlapping signs and symptoms of diseases, a single diagnosis can be difficult, and may not be feasible or appropriate. This is especially true for first-level health facilities where examinations involve few instruments, little or no laboratory tests, and no X-ray. During the mid-1990s, the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with UNICEF and many other agencies, institutions and individuals, responded to this challenge by developing a strategy known as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). Although the major reason for developing the IMCI strategy was the needs of curative care, the strategy also addresses aspects of nutrition, immunization, and other important elements of disease prevention and health promotion. The objectives of the strategy are to reduce death and the frequency and severity of illness and disability, and to contribute to improved growth and development. The IMCI clinical guidelines target children less than five years old – the age group that bears the highest burden of deaths from common childhood diseases. The WHO also published the \\"Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth\\" (IMPAC), which included newborn and neonatal care guidelines as a continuum of care for both the mother and child in postnatal period.Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth (IMPAC)  References  * http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/maternal/impac/en/  External links  * WHO (2014): Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI): set of distance learning modules (Download list * WHO: Documents on the IMCI * WHO: More about WHO's work on IMCI Category:Pediatrics Category:Prevention ","title":"Integrated Management of Childhood Illness"},{"id":"11768324","text":"IMCI may refer to: * International Marine Certification Institute, a certification organisation to serve the interests of the recreational boating industry * Integrated Management of Childhood Illness, an approach to children's health which focuses on the whole child * Initial Many Core Instructions, a processor instruction extension for Intel's 64-bit architecture based on SIMD instructions ","title":"IMCI"},{"id":"11768364","text":"Daniel Bennett (born November 27, 1979) is an American saxophonist who lives in Manhattan.

The duo released a self-titled EP in March 2005. Three months later they added bassist John Servo to the group. After a year of travel, the Daniel Bennett Group released A Nation of Bears, on the Bennett Alliance label. The album was released in April 2007. Bennett used repetitious melodic ideas over shifting, odd-metered chord structures. In February 2007, the Daniel Bennett Group expanded into a full quartet. The new lineup featured classical guitarist Brant Grieshaber, as well as bassist Jason Davis. Most notable was the addition of drums to the group for the first time in three years. Percussionist Rick Landwehr joined the group in May 2007. The newly formed quartet found its audience in the Boston art scene, performing at venues like the Cambridge ArtCentral Festival, DTR Gallery, Fox Hall Studios, and the Judi Rotenberg Gallery. The Daniel Bennett Group had considerable success in Boston's jazz club scene, performing regularly at venues like The Beehive and Ryles Jazz Club. In the summer of 2008, the newly formed quartet also collaborated in double bill performances with guitarist Bill Frisell, saxophonist James Carter, and indie rock group Zyrah's Orange. In the fall of 2009, the band began a weekly artist residency at the famed Liberty Hotel (formerly the historic Charles Street Jail) in Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood. The Daniel Bennett Group would go on to perform at the hotel for 5 years. Bennett composed the music for Peace and Stability Among Bears during his time at the Liberty Hotel. The New York years Daniel Bennett (2010) In the summer of 2010, Daniel Bennett moved to New York City, where he enlisted a new cast of musicians that included guitarist Mark Cocheo, bassist Mark Lau, and drummer Brian Adler. In the winter of 2011, the Daniel Bennett Group organized the popular \\"Jazz at the Triad\\" concert series at the Triad Theatre on Manhattan's upper westside. The Daniel Bennett Group currently curates and performs in this ongoing concert series. Supporting artists on the series have included Charlie Hunter, Steve Kuhn, and Greg Osby. The concert series quickly garnered critical acclaim throughout the New York media. In 2015, The Daniel Bennett Group was voted \\"Best New Jazz Group\\" in the New York City Hot House Jazz Awards. Daniel Bennett recently composed and performed the original musical scores for 'Frankenstein' and 'Brave Smiles' at the Hudson Guild Theatre in Manhattan. Recent off-Broadway theater performances include the North American premier of 'Legacy Falls' and a revival of 'Swingtime Canteen' at Cherry Lane Theatre. Daniel Bennett recently played woodwinds in 'Blank! The Musical,' the first fully improvised Off-Broadway musical to launch on a national stage. The show was produced by Second City, Upright Citizens Brigade, and Improv Boston. Bennett Alliance Charlie Hunter performs at the Bennett Alliance Music Fest in Rochester, NY (July 21, 2007) Bennett founded Bennett Alliance, a music production company and concert organizer serving Massachusetts and New York City, in the spring of 2003. In 2006, Bennett Alliance expanded into an independent record label. Bennett Alliance has released albums for The Kode, JK & the Servomatics, and the Daniel Bennett Group. The Bennett Alliance Music Fest (formerly Open Fest) is a jazz and folk fest held in Rochester, New York. The Bennett Alliance also produces the Bennett Alliance Concert Series at the Cambridge YMCA Theatre.

Biography Born in Olney, Texas in 1907, Keathley attended Onley High School and Cameron Junior College, now Cameron University, in Lawton, OK. He attended the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas, today known as Texas A&M; University, in 1937. He never graduated due to financial reasons. He joined the Army from Lamesa, Texas, and by September 14, 1944, was serving as a staff sergeant in Company B, 338th Infantry Regiment, 85th Infantry Division. During an enemy counterattack on that day, at Mount Altuzzo, Italy, Keathley took command of three platoons which had been left leaderless due to heavy casualties. He organized the platoons' defense, gathered ammunition, and encouraged his men even after being severely wounded. He died of his injuries shortly after the attack was repulsed. For these actions, Keathley was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor six months later, on March 29, 1945. Keathley, aged 36 at his death, was buried at the Florence American Cemetery in Florence, Italy.Handbook of Texas Keathley's Medal of Honor is on permanent display at Texas A&M; University's Sanders Corps of Cadets Center. The medal was donated to the museum by his family on July 17, 2009. Also at Texas A&M; is the Keathley Hall dormitory, named in his honor. Medal of Honor citation George D.

It was popularly rumoured that the countess and her half-brother were lovers, and that her children were in fact his illegitimate offspring. When the elector became King of Great Britain in 1714, the von Kielmansegg family followed him to London. On 8 August 1719, Charlotte married Emanuel Howe, 2nd Viscount Howe. The king gave the couple £750 per annum, which was later raised to £1250. The couple had ten children, including Hon. George Augustus Howe, Hon. Richard Howe and Hon. William Howe (successively Viscounts Howe). Charlotte was naturalised as a British citizen by Act of Parliament in 1722.

It was built by the Great Western Railway in 1912 to provide a faster and less steeply graded route between London and Fishguard, in connection with the recently opened harbour at the latter place. It can thereby claim to be the last mainline railway to have been built in Wales. The double track line runs from Cwrt Sart junction at Briton Ferry on the South Wales Main Line to Morlais junction near Pontarddulais on the Heart of Wales line. Current usage The line is currently used mainly for freight traffic, but Transport for Wales run two or three services along the line in each direction on Mondays to Saturdays, one of which is the daytime boat train between Fishguard Harbour and Cardiff. The boat train service is run in connection with the Stena Line ferry to/from Rosslare in Ireland. By taking the Swansea District line, these passenger services bypass Neath, Swansea and Gowerton railway stations. Future plans Network Rail are considering rationalisation of this line following replacement of the Loughor railway viaduct and re-doubling of the track at Gowerton, work which was completed in 2013.

Staff believed that her pain was due to a gallstone attack and thus did not believe she required urgent medical care. Rodriguez's situation became a cause célèbre about the failures and bureaucratic indifference of both King-Harbor as well as political and health leaders in the Los Angeles area, creating or reinforcing fears that the health care system will not take care of people in a time of dire need. The Rodriguez case resulted in press coverage on national news networks such as CNN and CBS News. Incident at the hospital On May 9, 2007, Rodriguez is reported to have lain on the floor of the hospital's emergency department waiting room for 45 minutes while boyfriend Jose Prado made calls to 911 to report that Rodriguez was dying but hospital staff could not be convinced to treat her. According to waiting room video, and a June 15, 2007 report by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, for at least 30 minutes \\"staff members walked past the patient or worked to clean the floor next to her without interacting with her\\"; at one point a janitor cleaned the floor around Rodriguez as she vomited blood. A bystander made a similar call, telling the 911 dispatcher that a woman vomiting blood was being ignored by emergency-room staff. The caller requested an ambulance to transport the woman to another hospital, but her request was refused; emergency dispatchers would not act on the situation, nor call paramedic services, citing that the victim was at a hospital. The nighttime triage nurse, Linda Ruttlen, after repeatedly refusing to intervene, complained to police officers of the Los Angeles County Office of Public Safety that Rodriguez was causing a disturbance; a computer search on Rodriguez found that she had a parole violation for possession of a controlled substance. As county police were taking her into custody, Rodriguez became unresponsive and died on a stretcher. Results of toxicology testing by the coroner showed that Rodriguez tested positive for methamphetamine, but the level was not \\"life-threatening\\". Aftermath As a result of the incident, six staff members at King-Harbor, including a nurse and two nursing assistants, received \\"letters of expectation\\" (a letter outlining how they should behave in the future and carrying no additional penalty) from the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (DHS), taking into consideration previous performance history and their role in the event. In addition, the contract janitor was counseled verbally and the triage nurse (Linda Ruttlen) was placed on leave and later resigned. DHS placed most of the blame on Ruttlen, who pointedly refused requests to intervene, and she was referred to the state nursing board for investigation. The incident, including the actions of 911 operators, was under review by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. In response to public outcry, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) asked federal regulators to address how they will protect patients at King-Harbor in light of \\"horrific\\" and \\"appalling\\" lapses in patient care. The police, who had arrested Rodriguez in hopes of getting her better medical treatment in jail than she had received at the hospital, were absolved of wrongdoing.

May 16, 2014)Juvenile champion and sire Dehere dies at stud was an American Champion Thoroughbred racehorse. He was bred and raced by Robert E. Brennan's Due Process Stable. Sired by Canadian Hall of Fame inductee and two-time North American Champion sire, Deputy Minister, he was out of the mare Sister Dot, a daughter of the U.S. Triple Crown champion Secretariat. Racing at age two in 1993, Dehere joined Regret (1914), Campfire (1916), and City Zip (2000) as the only horses to ever win all three Saratoga Race Course events for two-year-olds: the Saratoga Special Stakes, Sanford Stakes and Hopeful Stakes. Dehere's other major victory in 1993 came in the Grade I Champagne Stakes. He went into the Breeders' Cup Juvenile having won five of his six starts. In his only loss, he had finished second to Holy Bull in the Belmont Futurity Stakes. Breeders' Cup bettors made him a prohibitive favorite, bet down to odds of 7-10. In the race, at the three-quarter pole Dehere moved into third place but then faded and finished eighth to winner Brocco. Despite the loss, Dehere's 1993 performances earned him the Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Male Horse. Dehere raced only twice as a three-year-old, winning the Fountain of Youth Stakes. A fracture of his right hind cannon bone during training ended his racing career. Acquired by Ireland's Coolmore Stud, he was retired to breeding duty at their Ashford Stud in Versailles, Kentucky. During his five years there, he was shuttled to Coolmore breeding operations in Australia before being sold in 1999 to the Japan Bloodhorse Breeders' Association's Iburi Stallion Station in Hokkaidō, Japan. In 2005, Coolmore reacquired Dehere and he is again shuttling between Ashford Stud and Coolmore Australia. Among Dehere's offspring are four millionaire racehorses in Australia: # Belle Du Jour - Golden Slipper Stakes (2000), Linlithgow Stakes (2001), Newmarket Handicap (2003) # Defier - George Main Stakes (2002), AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes (2002), Doomben Cup (2004) # Natural Blitz - multiple stakes winner # Dear Demi - VRC Crown Oaks (2012) In the United States, Dehere has sired the 2000 Arkansas Derby winner Graeme Hall and Take Charge Lady, a winner of the Grade I Ashland Stakes in 2002 and the Grade I Spinster Stakes in 2002 and 2003.

Biography In 1713, Randolph inherited 625 acres of land near the Chickahominy River when his father's will was probated at the Henrico County court in Varina, Virginia. Although known as \\"Edward Randolph of Bremo\\", the Virginia Historical Society reported that the Bremo Plantation located along the James River in Henrico County near Malvern Hill and Turkey Island was actually owned by the Cocke family of Virginia during the 18th century. Randolph \\"chose a seafaring life\\" and operated merchant vessels between England and the Colony of Virginia. Residing in England, he met an heiress named \\"Elizabeth\\" (whose last name has been noted as \\"Graves\\", \\"Groves\\", and \\"Grosvenor\\") from Bristol, England at a launch at Gravesend, Kent. The couple married around 1715 and had four children: *Joseph Randolph did not marry. *Edward Randolph (? - April 1757) married Lucy Harrison of Berkeley (the daughter of Benjamin Harrison IV, the sister of Benjamin Harrison V, the sister-in-law of Peyton Randolph and William Randolph III, and the granddaughter of Robert \\"King\\" Carter) in the late 1740s and had two children. Harrison's sisters were married to Peyton Randolph and William Randolph III, Edward Randolph Jr's cousins. *Elizabeth Randolph first married Reverend William Yates, the fifth president of The College of William & Mary, and had three children. She then married Theodorick Bland of Cawsons. *Mary Randolph married Robert Yates, the brother of William Yates, and had three children. Two sons of Bartholomew Yates, William and Robert, were members of the Church of England and married the two daughters of Randolph, Elizabeth and Mary, while visiting England to obtain their clerical orders. Although he came from a large, wealthy, and powerful family, Edward Randolph's children were born into a branch that was not very prosperous. Randolph was bankrupt by 1732 and misfortune had later brought him near poverty. Benjamin Harrison IV was among his many creditors and brought suit against him in 1737. It is not known where or when Randolph died, but was placed in Virginia as late as 1756 by the Dinwiddie Papers. Ancestry and descendants In addition to the familial connections noted previously, Randolph was a great-great-great grandfather of Harrison Randolph, the President and Professor of Mathematics at the College of Charleston.

It is assigned to the 509th Operations Group, Air Force Global Strike Command, stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. The squadron is equipped with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber. The 13th is one of the oldest units in the United States Air Force, first being organized as the 13th Aero Squadron' on 14 June 1917 at Camp Kelly (later Kelly Field), Texas. The squadron deployed to France and fought on the Western Front during World War I as a pursuit squadron. The unit was demobilized after the war in 1919.Gorrell, Series E, Volume 2, On 16 October 1936, the squadron was consolidated with the 104th Aero Squadron, another AEF combat squadron on the Western Front, which was organized on 25 August 1917.Gorrell, Series E, Volume 17, Reorganized in 1921 as part of the permanent United States Army Air Service, the squadron became part of Fifth Air Force in the Pacific Theater of Operations of World War II flying North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. During the Cold War, it fought in the Korean War and Vietnam War as a Martin B-57 Canberra tactical bomber squadron.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 70–72 History The 13th Bomb Squadron traces its origins to two World War I United States Army Air Service squadrons. World War I The 13th Aero Squadron was formed at Camp Kelly (later Kelly Field), Texas, on 14 June 1917. 13th Aero Squadron – SPAD XIII, Souilly Aerodrome, France. 1918 The \\"Devil’s Own Grim Reapers\\" as they came to be known was a Pursuit (Fighter) squadron on the Western Front in France during 1918, flying the French SPAD S.XIII. The 13th claimed several \\"aces\\" from this period of its history: Charles J Biddle, Murray K Guthrie, Frank K Hays, John J Seerly, and William H Stovall. Major Carl Spaatz was attached to the unit at his request, and had two victories. He would rise to four-star rank during WW II. The Unit's first combat loss was Lt. George Kull on 14 September 1918 during the St. Mihiel Offensive. There would be others to follow: During the Meuse Argonne Offensive, the squadron lost Lts. Gerald D. Stivers, Henry Guion Armstrong, Clarence A. Brodie and Robert H. Stiles killed in action. It returned to the United States in March 1919 when it was demobilized. It remained inactive until it was reconstituted in 1936. The 104th Aero Squadron was organized on 25 August 1917, also at Kelly Field. As a Corps Observation (Reconnaissance) Squadron flying the French Salmson 2A2 observation aircraft, the 104th flew reconnaissance, directed Allied artillery fire and pinpointed troop movements on the Western Front. The demand for artillery fire adjustments through aerial observation was constant in spite of difficulties encountered in air-to-ground communications. It was largely due to the photos made by aerial reconnaissance that the Allied infantry knew where it was advancing. It returned to the United States in April 1919 and became part of the permanent United States Army Air Service in 1921. Inter-War period After its arrival at Roosevelt Field, Long Island, most of the 104th Aero Squadron's men returned to civilian life. In May 1919, the squadron moved to neighboring Mitchel Field; the squadron was down to one officer and one enlisted man and was administratively carried by the Air Service as an active unit. About 15 May, the 104th moved to Fort Bliss, Texas, and during June to Kelly Field, Texas, still manned in name only. On 25 May 1919 it was redesignated as the 104th Surveillance Squadron, and assigned to the Army Surveillance Group on 1 July along with the 8th, 12th and 90th Aero Squadrons. During August 1919, nearly 200 men from Mitchel Field were moved to Kelly Field to bring the squadron up to strength. The 104th quickly adapted to peacetime soldiering in the nation's infant air organization It was also equipped with new Dayton-Wright DH-4 aircraft, surplus from the World War.History, 8th Bombardment Squadron (L), 3d Bombardment Group (L) AAF, 31 May 1917 – 31 March 1944 Mexican Border patrol : see also: United States Army Border Air Patrol The mission of the Army Surveillance Group was to carry out observation overflights along the Mexican Border. During this period, Mexico was enduring a period of revolution and unrest, which led to border violations and the deaths of American citizens. After being manned and equipped, in November 1919 the squadron split into three flights: Headquarters Flight and Flight A went to Fort Bliss, Texas, while Flight B deployed to Marfa Field, Texas. From 10 September to 4 November, Flight B was located at Post Field, Oklahoma, but it returned to Marfa Field on 17 November 1920, and remained there until June 1921 flying observation flights along the Big Bend area of the Texas/Mexico border. 13th Squadron (Attack) 13th Squadron (Attack) – Dayton-Wright XB-1A, Kelly Field, Texas, 1921. 13th Attack Squadron Curtiss A-3B. On 14 March 1921 with the establishment of the permanent Army Air Service, the 104th Surveillance Squadron was redesignated as the 13th Squadron (Attack). In May the border patrol flights were ended and all of the flights were ordered to participate in maneuvers at Langley Field, Virginia. On 2 July the squadron reassembled at Kelly Field and on 25 January 1923 the squadron was redesignated the 13th Attack Squadron. The new mission of the squadron was to conduct a series of suitability tests of new types of aircraft. Initially tested was the Dayton-Wright XB-1A, an observation plane to be used for photography, bombardment and liaison work. The next aircraft was the GAX (Boeing GA-1), a ground attack triplane. These tests were conducted to determine the capability of aircraft under hard service incurred during long cross-country flights. All squadron officers and enlisted personnel attended classes to learn everything they could about the aircraft. In 1923, the 13th Attack Squadron returned to the Dayton-Wright DH-4 and performed aerial demonstrations, formation flying, and normal training. Due to funding reductions, the squadron was inactivated on 27 June 1924. Reserve status and reactivation Curtiss A-8 Shrike ground-attack aircraft No.60 of the 13th Attack Squadron, 1931 After its inactivation from the active forces, the 13th was designated an Regualar Army Inactive squadron, and partially manned with reserve officers. Remaining as the 13th Attack Squadron, it was allotted to the Eighth Corps Area on 28 February 1927. Organized about May 1928 with Organized Reserve personnel. Conducted summer training at Fort Crockett, with units of the 3d Attack Group.Clay, Returned to active status on 1 November 1929, the 13th Attack Squadron again joined the 3d Attack Group at Langley Field, Virginia. Two weeks later the squadron moved to Fort Crockett, Texas. From 1929 to 1934, the squadron flew the Curtiss A-3 aircraft, and then converted to newer Curtiss A-12 Shrikes. In February 1935, the 13th moved to Barksdale Field, Louisiana. On 16 October 1936, the War Department reconstituted the World War I 13th Aero Squadron and consolidated it with the 13th Attack Squadron, forming a single squadron with two separate origins, thus perpetuating the history and traditions of both. The 13th Attack Squadron designation was retained for the consolidated unit. Also in 1936, the squadron received the Northrop A-17 ground attack aircraft. It continued flying A-17s through 1939. On 15 September 1939 the squadron became the 13th Bombardment Squadron (Light), while its parent became the 3d Bombardment Group (Light). Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bombers were gained about this same time, but some Martin B-12s were also flown in the 1939–1941 period as the 13th developed into a proficient bombardment squadron. The 3d Bomb Group moved to Savannah Army Airfield, Georgia in October 1940, and in 1941 they received Douglas A-20A Havoc ground attack aircraft to replace their obsolescent B-18s and B-12s. World War II \\"When war came to the nation in December 1941, the Reapers embarked on an accelerated training program while also engaged in anti-submarine patrols against German U-boats along the Atlantic coast. Because every ranking and experienced man from the unit was pulled and assigned overseas to train other units, the Reapers were left without personnel and planes. When the unit arrived in Australia in January 1942, they were still without airplanes. While waiting for aircraft, the Reapers learned there were 24 brand new North American B-25 Mitchells sitting on the ramp in nearby Melbourne, but the planes were earmarked for the Dutch. Soon after, 24 Reaper pilots arrived in Melbourne, presented a confused Officer of the Day with an authorization letter, and nonchalantly flew away with the airplanes before anyone realized the mistake. The Reapers used those planes, and later A-20s, to attack bridges, transports, airfields, troop installations, seaplanes, docks, warehouses and enemy targets. At the end of the war, the squadron had earned four Distinguished Unit Citations for actions over the Philippine Island[s], Papua and New Guinea, and also took home the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation.\\"\\"From the end of World War II to 1950, the [13th] remained in Japan as part of the Army of Occupation.\\" Korean War A 13th BS B-26C equipped with an infrared seeker during the Korean War. \\"When North Korea invaded the south in 1950, the squadron, [f]lying . . . Douglas B-26 Invaders, conducted interdiction missions during daylight raids on enemy troops and lines. On 25 June 1951, the squadron was redesignated the 13th Bombardment Squadron[,] Light-Night Intruder to reflect the unit’s \\"Hoot Owl\\" night missions. Following the end of the Korean War, the 13th remained forward deployed to Kunsan Air Base, Korea until ordered to Johnson Air Base, Japan, in 1954 to begin conversion to the Martin B-57 Canberra. On 1 October 1955, the unit was redesigned the 13th Bombardment Squadron Tactical.\\" Vietnam War \\"The unit’s next move was to Clark Air Base, Philippines, on 10 April 1964. During the Vietnam War the Reapers took part in numerous campaigns flying the Canberra, a light twin engine jet bomber, and with the upgraded B-57G model was one of the first units to fly with a targeting pod, which was used to release some of the first ever laser guided munitions. Deployed to Tan Son Nhut Air Base, South Vietnam, by June 1964, the squadron had flown 119 combat sorties. In February 1965, an enemy attack destroyed six 13 BS B-57s at Bien Hoa Air Base and rendered the airfield unusable. Flying from Da Nang Air Base and Phan Rang Air Base, Vietnam, the unit continued to fly combat sorties until 1968. The 13th BS was then inactivated.\\" \\"The squadron remained on the shelf until 8 February 1969, when it was activated at MacDill Air Force Base, Fla., where the mission of the 13th trained members on B-57G tactics, techniques, and state of the art computer systems. On 15 September 1970, the 13th deployed to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, and on 17 October 1970, flew its first combat mission in the B-57G. The squadron flew combat missions until 12 April 1972, when personnel and equipment moved to Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas, as the squadron was reduced to paper status. The 13th was again inactivated on 30 September 1973.\\" Modern era \\"On 14 June 2000 after more than 26 years in hibernation, the Grim Reapers returned to the active Air Force as part of the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas. Shortly after 11 September 2001, the Reapers deployed with the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron and performed notably in Operation Anaconda to Afghanistan in early 2002. Upon returning the Reapers were named the 7th Bomb Wing's executive agent for support of the Rockwell B-1 Lancer [t]est program. Additionally, the Reapers were responsible for supporting the B-1 Weapons Instructor Course. This relationship put the 13th in the enviable position of being the first in the operational bomber community to train on the latest upgrades . . .\\" \\"The Reapers were deployed in early 2003 as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. Upon returning from Guam, the 13th BS was charged with devising and running the first Iron Thunder, an audacious plan calling for the scheduling of 120 missions over three days with the stated objective of the execution of 75 sorties flying 90%, or 108 sorties. The crews began flying sorties on 7 October 2003 and continued round the clock until late on 9 October. Starting in the fall of 2003, the B-1 fleet initiated a transformation with major computer and software upgrades and the Reapers were at the forefront. The 13th BS was the first operational unit assigned to fly Block E B-1s, a revolutionary upgrade which allowed a mixed load of GPS guided and unguided weapons, as well as a new air-to-air radar capability to increase the combatant commander’s options and flexibility. As the initial cadre, the Reapers were responsible for training the core of the wing’s bomber crews.\\" \\"The 13th Bomb Squadron was deployed in early 2004, again flying missions over Afghanistan. Upon returning, the squadron was tasked with leading Iron Thunder 04-4 with the goal of delivering massive concentrated firepower in another bomber surge, which carefully integrated limited range space, jet availability, and realistic threat and target scenarios. The plan resulted in 77 effective sorties in less than 68 hours. More astounding was the fact that 47 of the sorties released a record 383 training weapons. In December 2004, for the fourth time in less than four years, the B-1s answered the call to war with all Reaper crew members and most enlisted support staff deployed as members of the 40th Air Expeditionary Group.\\" \\"In June 2005, the Air Force announced the 13th Bomb Squadron would replace the 325th Bomb Squadron at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, and fly a new aircraft, the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber. On 23 September 2005, the 13th Bomb Squadron passed the flag and time honored traditions of the unit to future Reapers at Whiteman AFB. Among its first assignments as a unit of the only stealth bomber wing in the United States Air Force, the 13th Bomb Squadron was deployed to Andersen AFB, Guam, in June 2006, to take part in the ongoing rotation which provides the U.S. Pacific Command a continuous bomber presence necessary to maintain stability and security for the Asia-Pacific region. Notable squadron achievements during this period was the firstever B-2 deployment on the continent of Australia. The historic event took place 25–27 July 2006 and featured training sorties on Australia’s Delamere Air Weapons Range and a B-2 Engine Running Crew Change at RAAF Base Darwin – the first time the B-2 landed on Australian soil.\\" Lineage ;

In 1901, the American author O. Henry coined the term to describe Honduras and neighbouring countries under economic exploitation by U.S. corporations, such as the United Fruit Company. Typically, a banana republic has a society of extremely stratified social classes, usually a large impoverished working class and a ruling class plutocracy, composed of the business, political, and military elites of that society. The ruling class controls the primary sector of the economy by way of the exploitation of labor; thus, the term banana republic is a pejorative descriptor for a servile dictatorship that abets and supports, for kickbacks, the exploitation of large-scale plantation agriculture, especially banana cultivation. A banana republic is a country with an economy of state capitalism, whereby the country is operated as a private commercial enterprise for the exclusive profit of the ruling class. Such exploitation is enabled by collusion between the state and favored economic monopolies, in which the profit, derived from the private exploitation of public lands, is private property, while the debts incurred thereby are the financial responsibility of the public treasury. Such an imbalanced economy remains limited by the uneven economic development of town and country, and usually reduces the national currency into devalued banknotes (paper money), rendering the country ineligible for international development credit. Etymology Cabbages and Kings (1904 edition). In the 19th century, the American writer O. Henry (William Sydney Porter, 1862–1910) coined the term banana republic to describe the fictional Republic of Anchuria in the book Cabbages and Kings (1904), a collection of thematically related short stories inspired by his experiences in Honduras, where he lived for six months until January 1897, hiding in a hotel in when he was wanted in the U.S. for embezzlement from a bank. In the early 20th century, the United Fruit Company, a multinational American corporation, was instrumental to the creation of the banana republic phenomenon.Big Fruit , NY Times Together with other American corporations, such as the Cuyamel Fruit Company, and with occasional support from the United States government, the corporations created the political, economic, and social circumstances that established banana republics in Central American countries such as Honduras and Guatemala.Where did banana republics get their name? , The Economist Origin The history of the banana republic began with the introduction of the banana fruit to the U.S. in 1870, by Lorenzo Dow Baker, captain of the schooner Telegraph, who bought bananas in Jamaica and sold them in Boston at a 1,000% profit. The banana proved popular with Americans, as a nutritious tropical fruit that was less expensive than locally grown fruit in the U.S., such as apples; in 1913, 25 cents () bought a dozen bananas, but only two apples. In 1873, to produce food for their railroad workers, the American railroad tycoons Henry Meiggs and his nephew, Minor C. Keith, established banana plantations along the railroads they built in Costa Rica; recognizing the profitability of exporting bananas, they began exporting the fruit to the Southeastern U.S. Minor C. Keith, American businessman. In the mid-1870s, to manage the new industrial-agriculture business enterprise in the countries of Central America, Keith founded the Tropical Trading and Transport Company: one-half of what would later become the United Fruit Company (UFC), later Chiquita Brands International, created in 1899 by merger with the Boston Fruit Company, and owned by Andrew Preston. By the 1930s, the international political and economic tensions created by the United Fruit Company enabled the corporation to control 80–90% of the banana business in the U.S.Alison Acker (1988), p. 63. Señorita Chiquita logo, a primary export commodity of Latin America. By the late 19th century, three American multinational corporations (the United Fruit Company, the Standard Fruit Company, and the Cuyamel Fruit Company) dominated the cultivation, harvesting, and exportation of bananas, and controlled the road, rail, and port infrastructure of Honduras. In the northern coastal areas near the Caribbean Sea, the Honduran government ceded to the banana companies of a laid railroad, despite there being neither passenger nor freight railroad service to Tegucigalpa, the capital city. Among the Honduran people, the United Fruit Company was known as El Pulpo (\\"The Octopus\\"), because its influence pervaded Honduran society, controlled their country's transport infrastructure, and sometimes manipulated Honduran national politics with anti-labor violence. In 1924, despite the UFC monopoly, the Vaccaro Brothers established the Standard Fruit Company (later the Dole Food Company) to export Honduran bananas to the U.S. port of New Orleans. The fruit-exporting corporations kept U.S. prices low by legalistic manipulation of Latin American national land use laws to cheaply buy large tracts of prime agricultural land for corporate banana plantations in the republics of the Caribbean Basin, the Central American isthmus, and tropical South America; the American fruit companies then employed the dispossessed Latin American natives as low-wage employees. By the 1930s the United Fruit Company owned of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest landowner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries, one of the factors confirming the suitability of the phrase \\"banana republic\\". Honduras In 1912, for the Cuyamel Fruit Company, the American mercenary \\"general\\" Lee Christmas overthrew the civil government of Honduras to install a military government friendly to foreign business. In the early 20th century, the American businessman Sam Zemurray (founder of the Cuyamel Fruit Company) was instrumental to establishing the \\"banana republic\\" stereotype, when he entered the banana-export business by buying overripe bananas from the United Fruit Company to sell in New Orleans. In 1910, Zemurray bought in the Caribbean coast of Honduras for use by the Cuyamel Fruit Company. In 1911, Zemurray conspired with Manuel Bonilla, an ex-president of Honduras (1904–1907), and the American mercenary Gen. Lee Christmas, to overthrow the civil government of Honduras and install a military government friendly to foreign businessmen. To that end, the mercenary army of the Cuyamel Fruit Company, led by Gen. Christmas, effected a coup d'état against President Miguel R. Dávila (1907–1911) and installed General Manuel Bonilla (1912–1913). The U.S. ignored the deposition of the elected government of Honduras by a private army, justified by the U.S. State Department's misrepresenting President Dávila as too politically liberal and a poor businessman whose management had indebted Honduras to Great Britain, a geopolitically unacceptable circumstance in light of the Monroe Doctrine. The coup d'état was consequence of the Dávila government's having slighted the Cuyamel Fruit Company by colluding with the rival United Fruit Company to award them a monopoly contract for the Honduran banana, in exchange for the UFC's brokering of U.S. government loans to Honduras. Honduras, the quintessential banana republic. The political instability consequent to the coup d'état stalled the Honduran economy, and the unpayable external debt (c. US$4 billion) of the Republic of Honduras was excluded from access to international investment capital. That financial deficit perpetuated Honduran economic stagnation and perpetuated the image of Honduras as a banana republic. Such a historical, inherited foreign debt functionally undermined the Honduran government, which allowed foreign corporations to manage the country and become sole employers of the Honduran people, because the American fruit companies controlled the economic infrastructure (road, rail, and port, telegraph and telephone) they had built in Honduras. The U.S. dollar went on to become the legal-tender currency of Honduras; the mercenary Gen. Lee Christmas became commander of the Honduran army, and later was appointed U.S. Consul to the Republic of Honduras. Nonetheless, 23 years later, after much corporate intrigue among the American businessmen, by means of a hostile takeover of agricultural business interests, Sam Zemurray assumed control of the rival United Fruit Company, in 1933. Guatemala center Guatemala suffered the regional socio-economic legacy of a 'banana republic': inequitably distributed agricultural land and natural wealth, uneven economic development, and an economy dependent upon a few export crops—usually bananas, coffee, and sugar cane. The inequitable land distribution was an important cause of national poverty, and the concomitant sociopolitical discontent and insurrection. Almost 90% of the country's farms are too small to yield adequate subsistence harvests to the farmers, while 2% of the country's farms occupy 65% of the arable land, the property of the local oligarchy. During the 1950s, the United Fruit Company sought to convince the governments of U.S. Presidents Harry Truman (1945–1953) and Dwight Eisenhower (1953–1961) that the popular, elected government of President Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán of Guatemala was secretly pro-Soviet for having expropriated unused \\"fruit company lands\\" to landless peasants. In the Cold War (1945–1991) context of the pro-active anti-communist politics exemplified by U. S. Senator Joseph McCarthy in the years 1947–1957, geo-political concerns about the security of the Western Hemisphere facilitated President Eisenhower's ordering and authorizing Operation Success, the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état by means of which the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency deposed the democratically elected government (1950–1954) of President Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán and installed the pro-business government of Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas (1954–1957), which lasted for three years until his assassination by a presidential guard. A mixed history of elected presidents and puppet-master military juntas were the governments of Guatemala in the course of the 36-year Guatemalan Civil War (1960–1996). However, in 1986, at the 26-year mark, the Guatemalan people promulgated a new political constitution, and elected Vinicio Cerezo (1986–1991) president; then Jorge Serrano Elías (1991–1993).  In art  Poetry With the poem \\"La United Fruit Co.\\", Pablo Neruda denounced the corporate subjugation of Latin America. In the book Canto General (General Song, 1950), the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (1904–73) denounced foreign corporate political dominance of Latin American countries with the four-stanza poem \\"La United Fruit Co.\\"; the second-stanza reading in part:George Black (1988), p. 33. > ... The Fruit Company, Inc. > Reserved for itself the most succulent, > The central coast of my own land, > The delicate waist of the Americas. It rechristened its territories > As the \\"Banana Republics\\", > And over the sleeping dead, > Over the restless heroes > Who brought about the greatness, > The liberty and the flags, > It established a comic opera ... Novels The novel One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), by Gabriel García Márquez, depicts the imperialist capitalism of foreign fruit companies as voracious socio-economic exploitation of natural resources of the fictional South American town of Macondo and its people. Domestically, the corrupt national government of Macondo abets the business policies and labor practices of the foreign corporations, which brutally oppress the workers. Modern interpretations Graffiti implying a banana republic in Slovenia. Countries that obtained independence from colonial powers in the 20th and 21st centuries have at times thereafter tended to share traits of banana republics due to influence of large private corporations in their politics; for example, Maldives (resort companies), and the Philippines (tobacco industry, U.S. government and corporations). On 14 May 1986, then Australian Treasurer Paul Keating stated that Australia might become a banana republic. This has received a lot of commentary and criticism and is seen as part of a turning point in Australia's political and economic history. In the 21st century some critics called the United States a banana republic, and this is referenced in the title of the book Banana Republicans by Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber.

It was designed to comply with the Metropolitan Police Conditions of Fitness for London taxicabs, but was used in other towns and cities in the UK. It was commissioned from Austin by taxi dealers Mann & Overton and built by Carbodies of Coventry on a chassis supplied by Austin. Prototype The first prototype, the FX had a 1.8-litre sidevalve engine that proved inadequate for the job. The second prototype, the FX2 had a 1.8-litre petrol engine, but this was replaced by the third version, the FX3, which had a 2.2-litre ohv petrol engine. Fitted with an all-steel body from Carbodies the FX3 was registered as JXN 842, and it and the FX2 (registered as JXN 841) went on test in the summer of 1948. It was announced at the Commercial Motor Exhibition in the following November and went into full production in 1949.Public Carriage Office archives Following on from previous designs of London taxi, the FX3 had a traditional 3-door body, with an open luggage platform rather than a front passenger seat beside the driver. The FX3 was fitted with mechanical brakes, with rod operation, beam axles on leaf springs and a built-in Jackall hydraulic jacking system. Like all London taxis, it has a tight turning circle of 25 ft (7.6m) diameter, as required by the Conditions of Fitness.Austin FX3 brochure The petrol engine proved too expensive to run and a conversion to a Standard diesel engine was offered by taxi and bus proprietors Birch Brothers of Kentish Town.Birch family private archive A 3-litre Perkins engine was also offered and these, as well as pressure for Mann & Overton prompted the Austin Motor Company to develop their own diesel engine.Overton family private documents This appeared in 1956 and quickly became the most popular choice in the FX3. The FX3's manual transmission has four forward speeds plus reverse, with synchromesh on all but first gear. In 1957-1958 a series of automatic transmission test vehicles were manufactured, of which only two are known to survive. Outside London, cab operators in major UK cities like Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and Liverpool ran FX3s, either bought new or when they were retired from service in the capital. Examples of four-door FX3s were known to run in Manchester, where, in common with every other UK local authority outside London Town Police Clauses Act 1847 different taxi licensing regulations were enforced. Several FX3s were exported to Madrid, Spain and proved successful. Attempts to sell them to the United States were a failure. A Hire Car version, the FL1 was also made, which had four full doors, a bench front seat, column gear-change and an umbrella-type handbrake handle. The two occasional seats faced forward. A 'driveaway' chassis-cab was also supplied to outside coachbuilders. Several shooting brake ('woodie' ) bodies were made, as well as newspaper vans for the three London evening papers, the Star, News and Standard. A number of hearse bodies were also mounted on FL1 chassis by such coachbuilders as Simpson and Slater, Alpe and Saunders, Arthur Mulliner and Woodall Nicholson.A Pictorial history of the British Hearse Undoubtedly the most remarkable body built on an FX3 chassis belonged to Armenian oil magnate Nubar Gulbenkian. Built by London coachbuilders FLM Panelcraft, it was an open-drive town car, with carriage lamps and wickerwork decoration on the body sides. It was powered by a Ford six cylinder engine.Bonhams 1783. 14 Aug 2015. Lot 42 The ex-Nubar Gulbenkian 1960 AUSTIN FX4 BROUGHAM SEDANCA The FX3 was a popular model. Out of a combined production total of 12,435 Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders production figures FX3 and FL1 models, 7,267Mann & Overton sales records were licensed in London between 1948 and the end of production in 1958. The FX3 was replaced in 1958 by the Austin FX4, but continued in use in London until 1968. Many other examples ran for longer outside London. In turn, the FX4 ceased production in 1997 and was replaced by the TX series. The Austin FX3 is still sought after by collectors and enthusiasts of vintage London Transport.

While more lightly armed and armored than many of its contemporaries, their small size and relatively simple design facilitated their construction and their relatively high speed made them useful for many military operations. Both participated in combat during the Russo-Japanese War and World War I. Background The Suma-class cruisers were designed and built in Japan at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, as part of an Imperial Japanese Navy program to end its dependence on foreign powers for modern warships, using an all-Japanese design and all-Japanese materials.Schencking, Making Waves; Although the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal had experience gained in the construction of the cruisers and , albeit with assistance from French naval engineers and imported components, construction of Suma still took four years and resulted in a vessel with questionable stability and seaworthiness. However, her construction gave Japanese designers and shipbuilders valuable experience which was applied to her sister ship Akashi and which was applied in designs for larger and more powerful vessels in the future.Jentsura, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy page 99 Design The overall dimensions and layout of armaments on the Suma-class cruisers was almost the same as on Akitsushima.Chesneau, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860–1905, page 229. The design incorporated an all-steel, double-bottomed hull, with an armored deck, divided underneath by watertight bulkheads. The armor, of the Harvey armor variety, covered only vital areas, such as the boilers, gun magazines and critical machinery, with a thickness of on the deck. Her main battery consisted of two QF 6 inch /40 naval guns, one set in the forecastle and one in the stern. The main guns had a range of up to with a nominal firing rate of 5.7 shots/minute. Secondary armament consisted of six QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I–IV mounted in sponsons on the upper deck. These guns had a range of up to with a nominal firing rate of 12 shots/minute. She also had ten QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss guns, with a range of up to with a nominal firing rate of 20 shots/minute, mounted four on the upper deck, two on the poop, two on the after bridge and one each on the bow and stern, as well as four 1-inch Nordenfelt gun, which was later replaced by four 7.62 mm Maxim machine guns. She also was equipped with two torpedoes, mounted on the deck . The Suma-class cruisers were slightly smaller in displacement than Akitsushima, and consequently had lighter weaponry (two six-inch guns instead of four) to reduce issues with weight and design lessons learned with Akitsushima (such as the need to locate the secondary battery lower to the center of gravity to improve stability were implemented. Nevertheless, as with most Japanese designs of the period, the design remained top-heavy and had issues with seaworthiness and stability. The second ship of the class, Akashi differed from Suma in that its torpedo launch tubes were moved from the bow to the rear of the ship, and had a high foremast with a radio antenna. On Akashi the fighting top was eliminated from the mast from the start, resulting in a sleeker, “more modern” design. This was also eliminated from Suma at a later date. Propulsion was by two vertical triple steam reciprocating engines, 2-shafts, with eight cylindrical boilers (on Suma, and nine single-ended boilers on Akashi) yielding a speed of and a range of at based on its capacity for 544 tons of coal. Ships in class Japanese cruiser Akashi ; Ordered in 1891, launched 9 March 1895, and completed 12 December 1896,Nishida, Ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy Suma served in the Boxer Rebellion and in the Russo-Japanese War. She also served patrol duty during World War I primarily in the Southeast Asia theater. She was removed from the navy list on 4 April 1923, and scrapped in 1928 . ; Ordered in 1893, launched 18 December 1897 and completed 30 March 1899, Akashi was plagued in its early career with numerous problems with its engines, especially its boilers. Once these issues were resolved, she served in the Boxer Rebellion and in the Russo-Japanese War. In World War I, Akashi served in the Battle of Tsingtao, and subsequently patrolled the sea lanes in Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean Sea. She was based out of Malta as flagship of a destroyer group as part of Japan’s assistance to the Royal Navy under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. She was expended as a target for dive bombers south of Izu Ōshima on 3 August 1930 .

He grew up in Freeport, Long Island.Serwer, Jesse. \\"Before The Hype\\", Long Island Press, 7/11/2007  Education  Harry Allen attended Adelphi University.  Beginnings  Harry Allen first met Carlton \\"Chuck D\\" Ridenhour in 1982, when the two took an animation class at Adelphi University in Garden City. Ridenhour, also a member of hip hop group Spectrum City, introduced Allen to a clique who congregated around university radio station WBAU/90.3 FM on Monday nights (although not all were students), and, in Allen's own words, \\"looked at hip-hop scientifically - as an analysis of its parts - and took it completely seriously, like I did.\\" This included Flavor Flav and Terminator X (who, along with Chuck D, would form the core of Public Enemy), Spectrum City founders Hank and Keith Shocklee (who, along with Chuck D and Eric \\"Vietnam\\" Sadler, would form PE's legendary production team, The Bomb Squad), future Def Jam President Bill Stephney, and Andre \\"Doctor Dré\\" Brown, best known for later co-hosting Yo! MTV Raps. Although it would still be a number of years before Long Island produced its own stars, Allen was brought into direct contact with hip hop at a pivotal moment in its development. In 1983, WBAU/90.3 would be the first radio station to play Run- DMC's seminal classic \\"Sucker M.C.'s\\" and possibly the first to interview the Hollis, Queens trio that would go on to be hip hop's first platinum act. It was during this time that Allen would flirt with a career in photography, capturing the local scene and visiting New York City stars, as well as a change of scenery after transferring to Brooklyn College - until abruptly ending this hobby in 1986.  Career  Allen's first published article was \\"one of the first pieces to illuminate the political ideology behind Public Enemy, whose militant demeanor and confrontational lyrics initially confused and baffled the mainstream white press.\\" After a 1989 Washington Times interview with Professor Griff brought accusations of anti-Semitism against PE, \\"Allen was the natural choice to negotiate the love-hate relationship between PE and the press,\\" and began identifying himself as a \\"hip hop activist and media assassin,\\" becoming the group's publicist as \\"director of Enemy relations.\\" He also wrote on a variety of topics for The Village Voice (between 2002 and 2008), Essence, Spin and Vibe. Making his first recorded appearance on Public Enemy's 1988 track \\"Don't Believe the Hype\\", Allen responds to Flavor Flav's concluding question, \\"'Yo Harry, you're a writer, are we that type?' 'Don't believe the hype.' [Allen].\\" He also made a visual appearance on Tour of a Black Planet video, stating: > Well, what black people should do when they're seeking justice is ask for > justice, accept what they've given, and then compensate for the difference. > Black people usually don't compensate for the difference—they usually accept > what's given. What we need to do is bust through the wall by any means > necessary. Allen also appears on the chorus of \\"More News At 11\\", from Apocalypse 91...The Enemy Strikes Black, and 1994's Muse Sick-N-Hour Mess Age features a voicemail-message skit, entitled \\"Harry Allen's Interactive Super Highway Phone Call To Chuck D.\\" Allen was an early proponent of the Internet, creating an online presence for PE in 1991, publishing the webzine Rap Dot Com, and leading a panel discussion on music and the Internet—with Chuck D and Adam Curry—during the 1994 New Music Seminar. Allen stated on his radio show: \\"anyone can be on the Internet, and now anyone is on the Internet.\\" During this period, Allen also worked for Hank Shocklee's record label, Soul Records. Allen also founded the Rhythm Cultural Institute in 1992, with KRS-One and others, which moderates and hosts seminars, and has undertaken research into the methodology necessary to create a fitting \\"Hip Hop Hall of Fame\\".D, Davey. \\"Hip Hop News\\", The FNV Newsletter 8/18/1999 In 1995, the mission of the Institute was: \\"capturing, keeping for the future, aggressively defining, and promoting the expansion of hip hop music and culture.\\" In a 1995 Wired magazine interview, Allen spoke about hip hop in relation to technology: > That African Americans are alienated from technology is a myth. There is far > more evidence showing quite the opposite. When useful technology is not kept > from us by white people who practice racism, or when it is not used to > oppress us, we usually find energetic ways to get a new maximum out of it. > Additionally, I say that the power of hip hop lies in its ability to > radically combine sounds, imagery, text, and other media within its form. Allen hosts an \\"on-air magazine\\" on WBAI-NY/99.5 FM called Nonfiction, started in 2003, and he has interviewed guests such as Talking Heads bassist Tina Weymouth, physicists Brian Greene and Lisa Randall, and Black Panther Party activist Kathleen Cleaver. Allen was employed by Rockstar Games from 2004 to 2006, in the public affairs department, and his personal website states: \\"He [Allen] considers his credit on the hit title Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas his proudest byline.\\" On June 28, 2007, an exhibition of his photography, entitled Part of the Permanent Record: Photos From the Previous Century, opened at the Eyejammie Fine Arts Gallery in Manhattan, a gallery that specialized in hip hop-related art, founded and owned by Bill Adler, former Def Jam director of media relations. The exhibition, which ran until August of that year, was re-mounted at the University of Iowa’s Black Box Theater from March 27 through June 27, 2010. As of September 2014, Allen serves as an advisor to the Archives of African American Music and Culture (AAAMC), at Indiana University, is represented by the APB Speakers International speakers bureau, and published the blog Media Assassin.

Since \\"Safe to Sleep\\" was launched in 1994, the incidence of SIDS has declined by more than 50%.NICHD Back to Sleep Campaign History In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued the recommendation that babies sleep on their backs or sides to reduce the risk of SIDS (a statement that was later revised in 1996 to say that only the back was safest). NICHD launched the \\"Back to Sleep\\" campaign in 1994 to spread the message. The campaign was successful in that it significantly reduced the percentage of babies sleeping on their stomachs (prone position). It was found, however, that a significant portion of African-American babies were still sleeping on their stomachs; in 1999, an African-American baby was 2.2 times more likely to die of SIDS than a white baby. Thus, then Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala and Tipper Gore refocused the \\"Back to Sleep\\" campaign on minority babies.1999.10.26:\\"Back to Sleep\\" Campaign Seeks to Reduce Incidence of SIDS in African American Populations Campaign In 1985 Davies reported that in Hong Kong, where the common Chinese habit was for supine infant sleep position (face up), SIDS was a rare problem. In 1987 the Netherlands started a campaign advising parents to place their newborn infants to sleep on their backs (supine position) instead of their stomachs (prone position). This was followed by infant supine sleep position campaigns in the United Kingdom (as \\"Back to Sleep\\"), New Zealand, and Australia in 1991, the U.S. and Sweden in 1992, and Canada in 1993. This advice was based on the epidemiology of SIDS and physiological evidence which shows that infants who sleep on their back have lower arousal thresholds and less slow-wave sleep (SWS) compared to infants who sleep on their stomachs. In human infants sleep develops rapidly during early development. This development includes an increase in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep) which is also called quiet sleep (QS) during the first 12 months of life in association with a decrease in rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep) which is also known as active sleep (AS). In addition, slow wave sleep (SWS) which consists of stage 3 and stage 4 NREM sleep appears at 2 months of age and it is theorized that some infants have a brain-stem defect which increases their risk of being unable to arouse from SWS (also called deep sleep) and therefore have an increased risk of SIDS due to their decreased ability to arouse from SWS. Studies have shown that preterm infants, full-term infants, and older infants have greater time periods of quiet sleep and also decreased time awake when they are positioned to sleep on their stomachs. In both human infants and rats, arousal thresholds have been shown to be at higher levels in the electroencephalography (EEG) during slow- wave sleep. In 1992 a SIDS risk reduction strategy based upon lowering arousal thresholds during SWS was implemented by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) which began recommending that healthy infants be positioned to sleep on their back (supine position) or side (lateral position), instead of their stomach (prone position), when being placed down for sleep.

In 1996 the AAP further refined its sleep position recommendation by stating that infants should only be placed to sleep in the supine position and not in the prone or lateral positions.

W. H. Abeyesundere A. W. H. Abeyesundere, QCSupreme Court of Sri Lanka (4 May 1906 – 31 January 1988) was a Sri Lankan lawyer, independence activist, former acting Attorney General of Sri Lanka and judge of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka. Roots and lineage A.W.H. Abeyesundere was born on 4 May 1906 in the southern Sri Lanka town of Hikkaduwa, the youngest in a family of seven. His father was a proprietary planter and his mother a homemaker. Just three of his siblings survived to adulthood including Dr. E.R. Abeyesundere, a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and A.C.L. Abeyesundere, a proctor. He traced his lineage on his father's side to Yathramulle Muhandiram from the Dutch era (c. 1669) who was a building contractor awarded the title of Muhandiram by the Dutch for constructing the Dutch fort in Galle using his many elephants. On his mother's side he was a direct descendant of General Wickremasinghe (Wicramasinghe Maha Senevi who was later poisoned by the King) who was the Army Commander of King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe (1580–1593) of Seethawaka to whom former Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe also traces his roots.The Story of a Sinhala Family – The Goonewardene Family of Galle Education and politics Abeyesundere was educated at St. Joseph's College, Colombo, where he excelled in his studies. He had the unique distinction of coming first in the entire British Commonwealth in English, Latin and Greek at both the Junior Cambridge Examination as well as the Senior Cambridge Examination and won a scholarship to University. He read western classics and economics for a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of London.

During the communal riots in 1958, he was appointed legal advisor to Sir Oliver Goonetilleke Governor General of Ceylon and attached to Queen's House. It was during this time that he was also made a Justice of the Peace to facilitate his functions in assisting the Governor.

During the build up to the 2007 Rugby World Cup he was a part of the National Team's 40 man squad and made his debut for his country against England in August 2007. When the 40 man squad was cut to 30 at the end of August James was out and he returned to Cardiff Blues for the Magners League season. A slight knock kept him out of the first few games of the 2007–08 season. He came back shortly after the start, firstly playing a game for Cardiff RFC before starting the Blues away game against Munster in which he scored two tries. The following week he started again at home against Connacht and scored two more tries late on helping the Blues to a bonus point win.

Army Group E was created on 1 January 1943 from the 12th Army.

Composition Its principal units were:p.24, Thomas *11th Luftwaffe Field Division (Attica garrison) - Generalleutnant Wilhelm Kohler *Rhodes Assault Division (amalgamated with the Brandenburg Panzergrenadier Division in 1944) *LXVIII Army Corps (eastern Greece and Peloponnese) **117th Jäger Division - General der Gebirgstruppe Karl von Le Suire **1st Panzer Division (June–October 1943) - Generalmajor Walter Krüger *XXII Mountain Army Corps (western Greece) - General der Gebirgstruppe Hubert Lanz **104th Jäger Division - General der Infanterie Hartwig von Ludwiger **1st Mountain Division - Generalleutnant Walter Stettner *41st Fortress Division *Fortress Crete **22nd Division - General der Infanterie Friedrich-Wilhelm Müller *Also within the Army Group command were 22 penal \\"fortress battalions\\" of the \\"999\\" series. Service history The Army Group participated in anti-partisan operations in Greece and Yugoslavia. During the course of these operations, several atrocities were committed, including the massacres of Kalavryta and Distomo in Greece. Furthermore, during the disarmament of the Italian army in September 1943, German troops executed over 5,000 Italian prisoners of war in the Cephallonia Massacre. At the same time, the Army Group successfully repelled the British attempt to seize the Italian-occupied Dodecanese Islands. Army Group troops were also involved in the Chortiatis massacre (September 1944).  Retreat from Greece  When the fighting in Romania developed into a German defeat in the summer of 1944, Army Group E began to withdraw from the Greek islands and the mainland. The withdrawal from the southern Balkans was successful. By the end of 1944, the army group had succeeded in repelling the attacks of Soviet and Bulgarian troops as well as the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army. On the Bosnian-Macedonian border, she was able to establish a stable defensive position. In the autumn of 1944, the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts, together with the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army, conquered Central Serbia as part of the Belgrade Operation. The Soviet troops were then taken to the Hungarian theatre of war. This forced the Army Group E and the 2nd Panzer Army to set off through the very mountainous terrain of southwestern Serbia, northern Montenegro and finally southeast Bosnia towards Croatia. Throughout the journey they were left exposed to the Yugoslav Partisans' firepower, sometimes with the Allies' assistance of Floydforce. Army Group E was joined with what was left of Maximilian von Weichs' Army Group F. That army group had been dissolved on 25 March 1945. In the spring of 1945, some troops were sent to Hungary, with some units moving to Austria and southern Germany. During the 1945 retreat the fortress units were amalgamated into the LXXXXI Army Corps.  Last fight in Croatia  Colonel General Alexander Löhr tried to hold the Independent State of Croatia against the People's Liberation Army. A major offensive by the People's Liberation Army, which began on 12 April 1945, drove the German troops together in the Slovenian-Austrian border area. A few units escaped and eventually surrendered to British forces that had occupied Styria and Carinthia. Alexander Löhr reached a partial agreement with the British Commander-in-Chief to accept the German units. On the day of the surrender, 8 May 1945, the mass of the Army group was still three day marches away from the Austrian border. Until 15 May, numerous units managed to escape to Austria. 150,000 German soldiers of the Army group were captured by Tito's forces. At that time, Army Group E consisted of seven German divisions, two Cossack divisions of the XV SS Cossack Cavalry Corps and nine Croatian divisions. 220,000 members of the Croatian forces who fled to Austria with Army Group E were extradited by the British to the Tito partisans after their surrender. Several thousand of them were subsequently killed in the Bleiburg Massacre. A member of Army Group E who later rose to prominence was Austrian president and United Nations General Secretary Kurt Waldheim, who served in the military administration of Thessaloniki.

The state highway runs from MD 675 near Princess Anne north to U.S. Route 13 (US 13) near Eden in northern Somerset County. MD 529 is the old alignment of US 13. The state highway was designated from Princess Anne through Allen to Fruitland in Wicomico County when US 13 was relocated in the early 1930s. MD 529 was removed from the state highway system in segments north of its present terminus in sections in the late 1950s and early 1960s. MD 529 was redesignated along an old alignment of US 13 that had previously been MD 663 from Fruitland to Salisbury in the mid-1960s before being removed around 1981. Route description View north at the south end of MD 529 at MD 675 just north of Princess Anne MD 529 begins at an acute intersection with MD 675 (Somerset Avenue) just north of Princess Anne. The two-lane undivided state highway curves to the east and crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision rail line. MD 529 gradually curves to the north through a mix of farmland and forest. The state highway reaches its northern terminus at US 13 (Ocean Highway) immediately after crossing the railroad a second time south of Eden. The roadway continues straight as county-maintained Allen Road, which was once part of MD 529. History MD 529 has been designated along three sections of the original alignment of US 13 from Princess Anne to Salisbury, including Loretto Road, Allen Road, and Camden Avenue. The state road on which US 13 was later designated was paved from the city limits of Salisbury to Fruitland in 1912, from Fruitland to Allen in 1913, and from Allen to Princess Anne in 1914. There remained a gap at Passerdyke Creek at the county line in Allen until a new mill dam was constructed in 1919. US 13's first relocation occurred in 1933 between Princess Anne and Fruitland. The new highway began at MD 529's present southern terminus and paralleled the Pennsylvania Railroad until curving north to intersect Allen Road west of Fruitland. MD 529 was later marked along Loretto Road and Allen Road. The next relocation of US 13 occurred when the federal highway was moved to a new four- lane highway closely paralleling the railroad tracks through Salisbury. The section from the southern limits of Salisbury to Main Street in downtown Salisbury was completed in 1938. The segment from the southern limits of Salisbury to the first relocation south of Fruitland was completed in 1939. MD 663 was assigned to the old alignment of US 13 from the junction of the 1933 and 1939 relocations south of Fruitland north along Camden Avenue to Main Street in downtown Salisbury. MD 663 was removed from the state highway system in 1956. The portion of MD 529 from the present northern terminus to the county line at Allen was transferred to Somerset County in 1959. MD 529 was removed from Wicomico County altogether in 1963, but by 1966 the state highway had been redesignated from the junction of Camden Avenue and Allen Road near Fruitland north to the southern city limit of Salisbury near Salisbury University. This section was transferred back to county and city maintenance around 1981, leaving only the present section of MD 529.

Service At 8:30 on the morning of Thursday, June 13, 1861, ten companies of the Third Michigan infantry, led by its regimental band and the field and staff officers, left their quarters at Cantonment Anderson on the site of the Kent county agricultural fairgrounds, about two and a half miles south of the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The Third Michigan marched north up the Kalamazoo Plank road (present-day Division street) into the city, turned down Monroe street to Canal street and headed north to the Detroit & Milwaukee railroad depot, near what is today the corner of Plainfield and Leonard streets. Upon reaching the train station, the men boarded two special trains heading east, passing through Ada, St. Johns, Owosso, Pontiac and terminated in Detroit, where the Third Michigan was feted by the citizens. The Regiment then boarded two boats for a night cruise to Cleveland, Ohio. From Cleveland they went by rail to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and then on to Harrisburg, Baltimore, Maryland, and finally arrived in Washington, DC, on Sunday June 16. They were tired, hungry and weary when they marched to Chain Bridge just above Georgetown on the Potomac river, where they set up their first wartime encampment on the bluffs overlooking the river. The camp was first called Camp McConnell (after the colonel of the regiment) but then quickly changed to Camp Blair (after Austin Blair, then governor of the state of Michigan). The bands, the crowds, the patriotic fervor of late April soon give way to war's harshest reality: death. The first man to die was William Choates of C company, who died on July 1, 1861, not amidst the glories of battle but in the throes of fever. He was buried near Camp Blair, and is presumably buried there still. The regiment's baptism into war came less than three weeks later in the action at Blackburn's Ford on July 18, 1861, a prelude to the first battle of Bull Run on July 21. The Third suffered its first wartime casualty early on Saturday morning, July 20, 1861, when Homer Morgan of Company B allegedly took his own life. The Third Michigan infantry covered the retreat of the federal troops from Bull Run on July 21, and subsequently went into a succession of camps around Washington throughout the fall and winter of 1861-62. The regiment participated in McClellan's Peninsular campaign of 1862 and suffered its worst casualties to date at the Battle of Seven Pines, Virginia, on May 31, 1862, and at Groveton (or Second Bull Run) on August 29, 1862. The Third Michigan infantry played a peripheral part in the battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. The next major action for the regiment was at Chancellorsville, Virginia, on May 3, 1863, followed by Gettysburg where the Third found itself exposed in the Peach Orchard on July 2, 1863. Near the end of the summer of 1863 the Third Michigan was detached to the Department of the East under General Dix and sent northward to New York City in late August to serve as a deterrent to the expected rioting in the upcoming draft in that state. The Regiment spent several days in New York City, the draft went off without event and the Third Michigan was sent up the Hudson River to Troy to oversee the draft in that city, where it remained for two weeks before it returned south to rejoin the Army of the Potomac. By early May 1864, the Army of the Potomac was again on the move in Virginia and the Third Michigan was hotly engaged on May 5–6 at the Wilderness and on May 11–12 at Spotsylvania Court House. The Regiment participated in Grant's sidestepping moves southeastward around Lee's right flank across the North Anna river and ended its military service in the trenches in front of Petersburg, Virginia, on June 10, 1864, and was formally mustered out that same day. Those men who had enlisted in June 1861 but who had not reenlisted were sent home to be mustered out in Detroit on June 20, 1864, while the remainder of the regiment, reenlisted veterans and recent enlistees, were incorporated into four companies (A, E, F, and I) and then consolidated into the 5th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment. \\"Only three companies of our old Third re-enlist to hold our organization. So our regiment must lose its name after three years are up. The gallant Fifth re-enlist nearly to a man, and go home in a body retaining their organization and name.\\"Crotty, Color Sergeant Daniel G., Four Years Campaigning in the Army of the Potomac, Dygert Bros. & Co. Printers and Binder (Grand Rapids, MI), 1874. Reprinted with new material in 1995 by Belle Grove Publishing Co. (Kearney, NJ), page 118. The history of the Regiment as an integral component of the Union military structure was over, but its history as a relic of that conflict, as a symbol of what that struggle represented would continue to linger on in the guise of the Old Third Michigan Association until well into the Twentieth Century, indeed until every member had died. Today, the lineage of the Michigan 3rd Volunteer Infantry is carried on by soldiers of the Michigan Army National Guard's 126th Cavalry Regiment. Mortality Based on present research and analysis, from mid-June 1861 to mid-June 1864, 232 men died while serving in the Third Michigan: 103 men were killed in action and 47 died from their wounds, while 80 died of disease, 2 died accidentally and 1 man was murdered (Seth Simons in Georgetown). This represents a 16% casualty rate (based on a total enrolled of 1,411). While exact figures will probably never be fully known, on a company-by-company basis we note the following mortality rates: *A: 21 dead *B: 19 *C: 20 *D: 17 *E: 19 *F: 19 *G: 26 *H: 23 *I: 28 *K: 33 *Band: 0 *Field & Staff: 2 When we take into account the men who were transferred to other regiments or who were discharged from the Third Michigan and reentered the military, some 346 men did not survive the war. As a group then the Third Michigan suffered a 24% casualty rate. In other words, one of every four men who enrolled in the Third during the war would not survive. The first man to die in the regiment was probably Joseph Proper or Propier, on May 8, 1861, at Cantonment Anderson in Grand Rapids. He was buried in what is now Oak Hill (north) cemetery, at the corner of Eastern and Hall streets in Grand Rapids. Even though he was listed by name and unit and date of death as well as burial location in the cemetery’s interment record, his grave is today unknown (along with more than 40 other soldiers who died in Grand Rapids during the war and whose names became lost). The first man to die after the regiment arrived in Virginia was William Choates of C company. He died of disease at Camp Blair, Virginia. Homer Morgan of B company was the first to die by violence, on July 20, 1861, allegedly a suicide. The first man to be killed in action was David Stone of H company, who was shot on May 5, 1862, near Yorktown, Virginia. It is somewhat harder to identify the last man to die during the war. Moses Monroe, originally of E company and transferred to the Fifth regiment in June 1864, was wounded on April 6, 1865, at Sayler’s Creek, Virginia, near Appomattox and died of his wounds on April 23. However, 14 other former members of the Third Michigan died in April 1865, and another 4 in May. For example, Casper Thenner, sick from disease, had just returned to his home in Grand Rapids when he died on May 27, and was interred in what is now an unmarked grave in Oak Hill (south) cemetery. The last to die in 1865 was probably Joel Guild, who had recently returned to his home in Grand Rapids and was suffering from dysentery contracted in the service, when he died in December. Perhaps the last man to die as a direct consequence of the war was Samuel Thurston of C company. According to the Grand Rapids Herald of February 9, 1897, \\"After carrying a rebel bullet in his right lung for over thirty years? Thurston, who was an inmate of the Michigan Soldiers' Home ?has given up the fight. The bullet had for over thirty years been ploughing its way downward through the tissues of the lungs, and yesterday afternoon dropped out, death being almost instantaneous. The ball was covered with a linen patch, just as it had left the rifle of some rebel soldier, the patch and bullet being firmly connected. At 2 o'clock yesterday morning Thurston was taken to the hospital, having been in usual good health up to a short time before that. In the afternoon he complained to his nurse that his heart pained him, and while she was gone to secure a hot water application Thurston died.\\" The last known survivor of the Third Michigan was Willard Olds of C company who died at his home near Belding, Ionia county in 1937 and was buried in Otisco cemetery.

His thesis is that churches have a great deal to learn from modern musicals and could usefully incorporate their spiritual and theological values, and the pastoral care they offer, into their services.

Retrieved June 8, 2020 April 24, 1918 – February 9, 2002) was an American football player and executive. He played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Cleveland / Los Angeles Rams, San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Cardinals from 1940 through 1950. To boost team morale, Gehrke designed and painted the Los Angeles Rams logo in 1948, which was the first painted on the helmets of an NFL team. He later served as the general manager of the Denver Broncos from 1977 through 1981. He is the great-grandfather of Milwaukee Brewers left fielder and 2018 NL MVP Christian Yelich. Biography Early life and college Gehrke was born and raised in Salt Lake City to a family of German descent. \\"Fred's father Fred Richard Gehrke was born to August Gehrke and Elizabeth Bergau in Konigsberg, Germany (which was renamed in 1949, Kalininggrad, part of the Russian Federation).\\" As a youth, he snuck into Utah Utes football games. He there developed a love for the sport. He attended South High School where he participated in swimming, track and field, and football. He graduated from high school in 1935 and then attended the University of Utah, where he majored in art. At Utah, he started at running back on offense and left cornerback on defense. He also returned punts and kickoffs. Cleveland Rams and World War II Gehrke entered the National Football League as (NFL) an undrafted rookie. He landed a try-out with the Cleveland Rams in 1940. He was awarded a spot on team after he returned a kickoff for a touchdown in a pre-season exhibition game. His first contract with Cleveland paid him $135 per game. However, he did not play in many games that season because Parker Hall, the NFL's MVP in 1939, was the Rams' starting running back and his success kept Gehrke on the bench. When the United States entered World War II in 1941, Gehrke reported for military service. However, he was denied entry in the armed forces when military examiners noticed an operation scar across Gehrke's knee; he was immediately designated with a 4F status. Gehrke appealed the decision but was still denied entry in the armed forces. However, Gehrke contributed to the war effort by landing a job with Northrop Aircraft, which was based in California, as a technical illustrator, and began helping with the design of airplanes. He was on the team that drafted and designed the P-61 Black Widow warplane. In 1942, Gehrke joined the Hollywood Bears of the Pacific Coast Professional Football League, which at this time had a talent level considered to be on par with NFL, since many NFL players were in the military stationed on the West Coast and others were working in war industries there. The players worked their jobs during the day and then worked out and played their games at night. Gehrke played for the Los Angeles Bulldogs in 1943 and the Los Angeles Wildcats in 1944. Return to the NFL Once the war ended in 1945, Gehrke returned to the Cleveland Rams. That season, the Rams won the 1945 NFL Championship Game by defeating the Washington Redskins 15–14. Gehrke led the NFL that year in both average rushing yards, with 6.3 yards per rush, and an average punt return of 15.0 yards. He was then named to Pro Football Illustrated 's All-Pro team. In 1946 the Rams relocated to Los Angeles. That season, Gehrke was named to Pro Football Illustrated 's All-NFL second team. He also repeated as the NFL's average rushing leader with 5.2 yards per carry. He also continued working at Northrup, since many players at the time took up jobs outside of football during the off-season. He would then take three months off to play professional football. First helmet logo In the mid-1940s, Gehrke toyed with notion of painting a football helmet. Rams coach Bob Snyder suggested Gehrke paint a helmet with the ram horns on it that he could present to the team's owner Dan Reeves. Gehrke painted two ram horns on an old college helmet and presented the design to Reeves, who was intrigued. Reeves then contacted the NFL for a ruling on legality of having a football helmet painted. It was reported that the answer Reeves received from the NFL was \\"You're the owner; do what you want!\\" Reeves then tasked Gehrke to paint 75 helmets at $1.00 per helmet. The project took Gehrke the entire summer of 1948. The newly painted helmets debuted during a pre-season match-up between the Rams and Redskins at the Los Angeles Coliseum before a crowd of 105,000. Upon seeing the new helmets the crowd began cheering, which was followed by a five-minute standing ovation. To this day, Gehrke's rams horn logo is still worn by the team. By 1949, the Riddell sporting goods company had created a plastic helmet, baking in Gehrke's design. Some observers of the 1950 NFL Championship Game said that the only way to tell the Rams and the Cleveland Browns apart in the initial low resolution coast-to-coast telecast was the distinctive horns on the Rams' helmets. Throughout the 1950s many professional and college teams began painting logos to their helmets. The Pro Football Hall of Fame displays one of the original helmets, painted by Gehrke, along with the story behind it each year during Super Bowl Week. The logo innovation also earned Gehrke the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first Daniel F. Reeves Pioneer Award in 1972. First facemask Gehrke is also credited with developing the first helmet with a full facemask. He developed the face mask after having his nose broken three times during the 1946 season. He played the entire 1947 season with the facemask, which was made by Gehrke first applying a clay mold to his face. Once the mask dried, he had a few of the machinists who were running the power stamping machines at Northrop cover it with a sheet of aluminum. The manufactured piece of aluminum covered the nose, forehead and rested on the cheekbones to bear the brunt of blows. Gehrke then took the mask to his grandfather, who covered it in leather. In order for Gehrke to get the helmet on, it was cut up the back and laces were weaved into it. While the mask protected Gehrke's face, it also obscured his vision on pass plays to the sides. He could only see the ball with one eye. However, on punt returns his vision was unobstructed. He returned to using the traditional helmet the next season. Retirement and broadcasting Gehrke spent three more seasons with Rams. From 1945 to 1948, he beat out Tom Harmon and Les Horvath for the starting job at running back. Both men were Heisman Trophy winners. In 1950, he was traded to the Chicago Cardinals. In mid-season Chicago traded him to San Francisco 49ers. He scored his last touchdown with San Francisco. By this time, Gehrke was tired of the constant moving and traveling that came with being an NFL player. He retired as a player at the age of 31. Upon his retirement from professional football, Gehrke returned to Northrup and moved into an administrative post as head of the department. However, he was still involved in football. On weekends he would assist his former roommate, Harmon, who was announcing San Francisco 49ers and college football games. He held the job with Harmon for the next 13 seasons. Denver Broncos and the USFL In 1964, Gehrke was approached by Mac Speedie, a former Utah Utes football player who was then the coach of the American Football League's Denver Broncos, to become a pro scout for Denver. Gehrke repeatedly turned down the offer. He finally accepted the position. He then rose from personnel director to general manager to vice-president of the team. In 1981 the team was sold to Edgar Kaiser, a Canadian businessman who brought in his own personnel. Gehrke and coach Red Miller were asked to resign. However, Gehrke and Red Miller were hired by Denver Gold of the United States Football League. But after three years the league folded, and Gehrke's life in football finally came to an end. Gehrke died at his home in Palm Springs, California, on February 9, 2002. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery.

Known as Worcester Highway, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 113 (US 113) in Friendship north to MD 589 and US 113 in Showell. MD 575 is the old alignment of US 113 in northern Worcester County. The state highway was assigned in 2000 when US 113 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway through the area. As part of the overall project to expand US 113 to four lanes from Berlin to the Delaware state line, 14 unsigned auxiliary routes of MD 575 were designated on old alignments or service roads between 2002 and 2004. Route description View north at the south end of MD 575 st US 113 near Friendship MD 575 begins at a right-in/right-out interchange with northbound US 113, also known as Worcester Highway, in Friendship. There is no access to southbound US 113. MD 575 heads northeast as a two-lane undivided road through farmland. The state highway turns north after intersecting MD 452 (Friendship Road) and passing Carey Road. MD 575 passes under MD 90 (Ocean City Expressway) with no access. The state highway receives an off-ramp from northbound US 113 before reaching its northern terminus at MD 589 (Racetrack Road). Access to southbound US 113 is provided by heading west on MD 589, while a ramp to northbound US 113 continues straight. History MD 575 is the old alignment of US 113 between Friendship and Showell. The state highway was originally constructed by 1921 and designated part of US 113 in 1927. This stretch was bypassed in 2000 as part of a larger project to expand US 113 to a four-lane divided highway between the existing northern end of dual highway just north of US 50 in Berlin and the Delaware state line. In 2000, a ramp from westbound MD 90 to MD 575 was closed when MD 90's current partial cloverleaf interchange with US 113 opened. MD 589 and MD 575 were realigned to their present termini in 2001. All portions of US 113's interchange with MD 589 and MD 575 were completed in 2002. Junction list Auxiliary routes Auxiliary routes of MD 575 were designated between 2002 and 2004 as portions of the project to expand US 113 to a divided highway were completed. These routes are either old alignments of US 113 or service roads to provide access to private property or county highways compromised by the construction of the four-lane divided highway. Fourteen auxiliary routes were established, increasing in alphabetical order geographically from MD 575A in Showell to MD 575N just south of the Delaware state line. MD 575A through MD 575F were assigned in 2002 as the US 113 divided highway reached Jarvis Road (MD 575F). MD 575G through MD 575J and MD 575M were established in 2003 when the divided highway was completed to the state line. MD 575K, MD 575L, and MD 575N were designated in 2004 to bring the overall project to a close. *MD 575A is the designation for West Frontage Road, a highway that is the old alignment of US 113 on the west side of the present highway in Showell. The state highway begins at the entrance ramp to southbound US 113 and runs north to and includes the exit ramp from southbound US 113. MD 575A features turnaround ramps at both ends of the two-way portion just before the ramps from US 113 and intersects the western terminus of MD 589 in the middle. *MD 575B is the designation for Old US 113, a highway that is the old alignment of US 113 on the west side of the present highway in Showell, to the north of MD 575A. The state highway begins at a right-in/right-out interchange with southbound US 113 and heads north to a cul-de-sac. MD 575B has an intersection with Pitts Road, a crossing of Birch Branch, and an intersection with MD 575D. *MD 575C is the designation for a stretch of Shingle Landing Road on the east side of US 113 in Showell opposite MD 575D. *MD 575D is the designation for a stretch of Peerless Road on the west side of US 113 in Showell opposite MD 575C. MD 575D serves as a connector between both directions of US 113 and MD 575B. *MD 575E is the designation for a stretch of Danzi Road on the east side of US 113 north of Showell. *MD 575F is the designation for a stretch of Jarvis Road on the east side of US 113 north of Showell. *MD 575G is the designation for a stretch of Kepler Lane that runs west from a directional crossover intersection with US 113 south of Bishop. The state highway provides access to industrial facilities as well as MD 575H. *MD 575H is the designation for Service Road A, a service road that runs from MD 575G north paralleling US 113 to a cul-de-sac. *MD 575I is the designation for Service Road B, a service road that runs from a right-in/right-out interchange with northbound US 113 east to a cul-de-sac south of Bishop. *MD 575J is the designation for Service Road C, a service road that runs from a right-in/right-out interchange with northbound US 113 east and then north to a cul-de-sac north of Bishop, just south of US 113's grade crossing of the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad. *MD 575K is the designation for Service Road E, a service road that runs from a right-in/right-out interchange with southbound US 113 west and then south to a cul-de-sac north of Bishop, just north of US 113's grade crossing of the railroad. *MD 575L is the designation for a stretch of Hammond Road that runs from US 113's intersection with MD 610 (Whaleyville Road) east to between the intersection with MD 575M and the railroad crossing. *MD 575M is the designation for Handy Lane, a service road that runs from MD 575L north to a cul-de-sac adjacent to northbound US 113. *MD 575N is the designation for Church Road, a service road that runs from a right-in/right- out interchange with southbound US 113 just south of the Delaware state line west to the parking lot for a church.

Species There are currently three recognized species in this genus: * Cheirocerus abuelo (Schultz, 1944) * Cheirocerus eques Eigenmann, 1917 * Cheirocerus goeldii (Steindachner, 1908) Distribution and habitat Cheirocerus is distributed throughout much of the Amazon River basin, and appear to be absent from the Orinoco River. C. abuelo occurs in the Lake Maracaibo basin, C. eques in the Amazon River basin, and C. goeldii in the Purus River basin. C. goeldii is more typical of lowland large rivers where the water may be warmer and deeper, though it may also occur far upstream. C. eques appears to occur closer to Andean foothills where rivers may be cooler and shallower. Description Species of Cheirocerus have a fully ventral mouth with relatively fleshy lips, a broad premaxilla, a crimped gas bladder that appears to have fringe or finger-like projections, and the slender hollow tube extensions on each side of the gas bladder. These fish have an undeveloped dorsal fin locking mechanism and no dorsal fin spine. They also have a relatively long adipose fin. These species all have three pairs of barbels. C. eques and C. goeldii display some geographic variations in certain morphometric characteristics. C. abuelo has a dusky-gray body colouration that varies from relatively plain to having numerous small brown spots, and usually has a broad, diffuse band crossing the nape at the dorsal fin origin. Both C. goeldii and C. eques have a relatively uniform body colouration without spots; C. goeldii has a small, triangular spot at the dorsal fin origin, while C. eques has a distinct dark band at the dorsal fin origin. C. abuelo appears to attain the largest size of the three species, reaching at least . By contrast, the largest known C. eques is about and the largest C. goeldii is about . Ecology Cheirocerus species are generally nocturnal. This is evidenced by the specialized gas bladder, hypothesized to enhance hearing, and the poorly developed pigmentation. Diet mostly consists of benthic invertebrates, with chironomid larvae being a dominant component, but also including ostracods and mayfly nymphs.

It is one of a chain of three reservoirs on the River Balder, a tributary of the River Tees, which it joins at Cotherstone, about to the east. Balderhead Reservoir was commissioned by the Tees Valley and Cleveland Water Board (TVCWB) to increase water supply to Teesdale and Teesside. History In 1956, an upsurge in the chemical industry on Teesside led ICI to negotiate increased water supply from the Tees Valley Water Board. The first site considered, Cow Green, was above Cauldron Snout and was in a sensitive habitat area, so Balderhead was built instead. The site was initially built as a direct supply route of water to Teesside, but later became a river-regulating reservoir, ensuring that water was available for the River Tees. Cow Green Reservoir was built later, though the approval process was protracted due to the loss of habitat for the Teesdale violet plant. Balderhead, which was originally in the North Riding of Yorkshire, was approved for recreational activities by the Yorkshire Naturalists Union in the same year that it was opened, there being no objections on wildfowl grounds. Balderhead Reservoir was constructed upstream of two existing reservoirs, Blackton and Hury, and added to the storage capacity on the River Balder. Construction of the Balderhead dam began in 1961 and was finished in 1964, with the reservoir being filled during 1965. The dam, which was built of compacted boulder clay and shale, is high and long, and became, at completion, the highest earth dam constructed in the British Isles. When full, the reservoir can hold and has an overall perimeter length of . The catchment upstream of the reservoir is a mixture of rough grazing land and moorland which covers . The water quality is assessed as moderate for ecology and good for its chemical composition. Under the Water Act 1973, ownership of the TVCWB's reservoirs, which included the three Baldersdale reservoirs and two others -- Selset and Grassholme -- on the River Lune a short distance to the north, was transferred to the Northumbrian Water Authority (NWA). In 1989, NWA was privatised, and the reservoirs are now owned and operated by Northumbrian Water. All five reservoirs supply a water treatment works at Lartington, just south of Cotherstone. Recreationally, the reservoir is used by the Teesdale Sailing and Watersports Club for windsurfing, canoeing and kite surfing.

NPR's Stephen Marche described it as Thompson's \\"true masterpiece, a preposterously upsetting, ridiculously hilarious layer cake of nastiness, a romp through a world of nearly infinite deceit.\\" Plot Pop. 1280 is the first-person narrative of Nick Corey, the listless sheriff of Potts County, the \\"47th (out of 47) largest county in the state\\". He lives in Pottsville which has a population of \\"1280 souls\\". Sheriff Nick Corey presents himself as a genial fool, simplistic, over-accommodating, and harmless to a fault, given he is Pottsville's sole lawman. In reality, he is a clever psychopath able to manipulate people by appealing to their worst instincts and to get away with multiple murders. The novel begins with Nick visiting Ken Lacey, the sheriff of a nearby county. Nick visits Sheriff Lacey ostensibly to ask for advice as he has in the past. Nick has two pimps in charge of a whorehouse on the river at the edge of town who regularly insult and abuse him. Nick asks Lacey what to do about them and Lacey mocks and belittles Nick including literally kicking him in the behind multiple times. Lacey finally explains that he is doing all this to show Nick that when someone hurts you, you need to hurt them back twice as hard, finishing with the boast that if any pimps tried to disrespect him, he would shoot them dead on the spot. In the process of suffering the abuse of Lacey and his deputy Buck, Nick realizes that Buck harbors ill will towards Sheriff Lacey as well. He manipulates Lacey to have Buck see him off at the train station and has a discussion with Buck before heading back home. Early that evening Nick goes to see the two pimps. As usual they berate and mock him for taking their graft and for being generally spineless. Nick plays the fool and takes their abuse waiting for a steamboat to traverse a bend in the river and blow its whistle. When it does, to the shock of the pimps, Nick pulls his gun and kills them both, relying on the noise of the whistle to cover the sound of his gun. He dumps their bodies in the river and returns home to take a nap. He's awakened by his wife Myra to find that Sheriff Lacey has come to see him. At the prodding of his deputy Buck, Sheriff Lacey became concerned that Nick might actually kill the pimps and make him an accessory for encouraging the crime. Nick reassures Lacey that the thought never entered his mind. He gets Lacey drunk and then apologizes that even though it's too late to get a train back Nick doesn't have room to let Lacey stay the night and there are no hotels in Pottsville. He tells Lacey the only place to spend the night is the whorehouse run by the pimps. In his drunken state Lacey is eager to spend the night this way. As Nick walks him there he manipulates Lacey to brag to several people that he would never take abuse from the pimps, virtually claiming he would kill them if they tried. He further manipulates Lacey to make similar claims to the prostitutes at the house. The next day, the county attorney Robert Lee Jefferson berates Nick for not doing his job and never making any arrests. Jefferson warns Nick that he will face a strong opponent in the coming election from Sam Gaddis. Nick replies that the people don't really want him to do his job, that they enjoy petty crimes such as gambling, public drunkenness, and prostitution and that if he started to arrest people for such crimes he would have to arrest the whole town. Jefferson is adamant that Nick needs to stop being so lazy and cowardly because Gaddis is everything that Nick is not. Nick agrees with Jefferson that Gaddis is a man of the highest moral quality regardless of all the rumors about him people are spreading. Jefferson asks and then demands to know what these rumors are but Nick refuses to tell him. In reality there are no rumors but Nick realizes that he has planted a seed that will result in them. Nick then goes to find Tom Hauck, the husband of Rose Hauck who Nick is having an affair with. He finds Hauck drinking and fishing at the river. Nick tells Hauck that he has been having sex with his wife and as Hauck begins to sputter with rage Nick picks up Hauck's shotgun and lets him have both barrels in the stomach. As Hauck lies in agonizing pain Nick kicks him a few times and leaves him to die a painful death. Nick leaves Hauck to go see Hauck's wife Rose. He encourages Rose to have sex with him, but as much as she wants to, she has work that must be done at her farm or her husband will viciously beat her when he returns from fishing. Nick toys with her a while then finally gives her the news that he has killed her husband. She is overjoyed and they retreat to her bedroom to have passionate sex. In addition to Rose Hauck, Nick is also having an affair with Amy Mason. He sometimes has difficulties juggling both affairs while keeping either woman as well as his wife Myra and her imbecile brother Lennie from discovering them but by quick thinking and manipulation he is always able to. Where as Rose is foul mouthed and hypocritical, Amy is the only person in Pottsville that is beyond Nick's manipulation because she has a strong sense of morality. As she learns that Nick is planning to frame Sheriff Lacey for the murder of the two pimps which Nick committed she threatens to tell the authorities regardless of any potential consequences for her and Nick realizes that she would actually do it. This makes Amy more appealing to Nick than Rose. He realizes that he must choose between them because Amy is too intelligent to try and deceive about his relation with Rose and she will no longer tolerate Nick seeing Rose. Nick comes up with a way to get rid of his wife Myra, her brother, and Rose all at once. He manipulates Rose, who thinks she is taking part in a scheme to get rid of Nick's wife, to tell Myra's brother Lennie that she has seen him and Myra having passionate sex. Upon hearing this, Myra takes Lennie and heads for Rose's house. Myra breaks in on Rose and tells her that because she discovered her and Lennie's secret (what seemed like a vicious rumor turned out to be the truth) she is going to have Lennie rape her while she takes photos in order to blackmail Rose and force her to leave town. Rose gets a pistol that she purchased to protect herself from her abusive husband and kills both Myra and her brother. Rose finally realizes she has been manipulated by Nick. When she confronts Nick he just laughs at her and suggests she get out of town as soon as possible before the bodies are discovered. Toward the end of the novel, Nick's inner dialogue becomes more and more delusional as he comes to believe he is Jesus come to Earth to dispense justice on the guilty, hypocritical people of Pottsville. The novel ends without Nick being caught for any of his crimes but with the impression that circumstances are finally catching up to him while he becomes more delusional. Themes The character of a sheriff who plays the fool but is in reality highly intelligent is used several times by Thompson. Sometimes, as in this novel and The Killer Inside Me, the sheriff is a psychopath. In the novels Wild Town and The Transgressors, the sheriff is heroic, a highly intelligent man who was forced by circumstances to take a job that didn't allow him to take full advantage of his abilities and who plays at being a clown to fit in to his role and to manipulate people for altruistic ends. In his autobiography Bad Boy, Thompson wrote that this character was based on an actual deputy who pursued him when he neglected to pay a fine for being drunk and disturbing the peace. As recounted in a NY Times article, Thompson describes the encounter he had with the deputy: The sheriff also is quite likely based to some degree on Thompson's own father, who had many of the same characteristics: a born politician who knew just what to say to win favor with anyone and who appeared friendly on the outside but inside harbored a great deal of pent up rage and misanthropy. Pop. 1280 is also one of Thompson's most overtly political books. Nick constantly uses jokes to point out the racism, classism, and sexism of American society, for example at the end of Nick's discussion with the county attorney who is after Nick to make more arrests when Nick promises to arrest anyone who breaks the law, \\"Providing o' course, that he's either colored or some poor white trash that can't pay his poll tax\\". Adaptations Pop. 1280 was adapted as the French film Coup de Torchon (1981), directed by Bertrand Tavernier, set in French West Africa in 1938. Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos has been tapped to direct a new adaptation for release in 2020.

The ship was built by Pusey & Jones Corp. of Wilmington, Delaware, Hull Number 1108, as the USACS William H. G. Bullard named for Rear Adm. William H. G. Bullard. She was the first of two Maritime Commission type S3-S2-BP1 ships built for the US Army Signal Corps near the end of World War II. The other ship was the Albert J. Myer, which later joined her sister ship in naval service as the USNS Albert J. Myer (T-ARC-6). The ship was built by Pusey & Jones Corp. of Wilmington, Delaware as Hull Number 1108.Shipbuilding History, Pusey & Jones, Wilmington DE shipbuildinghistory, S-Type Special-Purpose Ships The ship was assigned to and largely worked on installation of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) under its unclassified name for installation, Project Caesar.  Function  Neptune before substantial modifications. Note almost original bow sheaves and absence of helicopter deck. Cable drums from foredeck. Cable drums from below. Neptunes assignments were typically to transport, deploy, retrieve and repair submarine cables, tow cable plowLarge devices used to bury cable in coastal areas to protect from damage from trawls and other hazards. and acoustic projectors, and conduct acoustic, hydrographic, and bathymetric surveys. Civilian cable engineers and specialist were involved during cable or surveying operations in addition to a Navy crew of nine officers and 142 enlisted personnel.SOSUS and both operations and actual linkage of Project Caesar to SOSUS was at the time classified and tightly controlled. The system was covered as \\"oceanographic research\\" and the cable operations were not associated with undersea surveillance systems. Thus any public information, such as the referenced All Hands article, did not describe the true nature of the operations. The All Hands article \\"Underseas Cable Layer\\" emphasizes the cover story with the purpose being to connect remote ocean observation centers with shore stations. In addition to cable operations and surveys for Project Caesar the ship supported experimental efforts and other projects.  Career  After completion for the US Army Signal Corps in February 1946, Neptune was handed to the Maritime Commission and placed in the James River reserve fleet on 2 March 1946. In 1952 Neptune was assigned to Project Caesar, the unclassified name for the installation phase of SOSUS. The system's mission was declassified in 1991. On 17 February 1953 the ship was named Neptune and withdrawn from the reserve fleet. The ship then went to the Bethlehem Steel Co. in Baltimore, Maryland for a number of modifications: e.g., electric cable machinery (in place of steam), precision navigation instrumentation, and a helicopter platform over the fantail. Cable drums in diameter and bow sheaves spanning were among the more visible modifications. On 1 June 1953 the ship was commissioned USS Neptune (ARC-2), with Cdr. Robert A. Bogardus in command. The ship's operations were classified so few specific ones are public. One was the 1962 connection of the array once terminating at Naval Facility Cape May to Naval Facility Lewes necessitated by destruction of the Cape May shore station in the \\"Ash Wednesday\\" Storm.To preserve secrecy the shore terminals operated under the cover of \\"oceanographic research\\" and were designated by the generic term \\"Naval Facility\\" until most had been decommissioned in system consolidation and before declassification. See SOSUS. From December 1965 through March 1966 Neptune was overhauled in Boston. In 1973, Neptune transferred to the Military Sealift Command (MSC), was re-designated T-ARC-2, and continued operations with an MSC civil service crew. Only two of the four cable ships available for Project Caesar had been designed and built as cable ships, the others being conversions and lacking some critical features needed for cable operations. The larger and were not suitable for modernization while Albert J. Myer and Neptune had cable ship features, including deeper draft than the larger ships, that made them suitable candidates for modernization. In hearings for the 1980 appropriations the Navy requested an increase of $9.6 million over an original estimate of $14.5 million in Neptune conversion budget for a total of $24.1 million. The revised estimate was based on actual Myer conversion costs. In particular the Navy was questioned about conversion of merchant type hulls to cable ships and answered that conversion would be more expensive. Further, charter of commercial cable ships was done when needed, but expensive and those ships were not always available when required. The AT&T; was used on occasion to lay trunk cable at a daily cost of $30,000 vice Neptune's $19,200. Scheduled Project Caesar work required a minimum of three Navy cable ships. Neptune was extensively modernized in 1982 by General Dynamics Corporation in Quincy, Massachusetts.See photos before and after modernization. That work included new turbo-electric engines. Neptune and sister ship Albert J. Myer, with Skinner Uniflow Reciprocating Steam Engines, were the last ships in the Navy to operate using reciprocating steam engines. Neptune performed cable repair duties all over the world until 1991, when she'd been in service for some 38 years. During her career, she received a Navy E ribbon in 1988. Inactivated in 1991, the same year in which the SOSUS mission was declassified, she was placed in the James River reserve fleet near Ft. Eustis, VA on 24 September 1991. The ex-Neptune was removed from the fleet 6 December 1994 to stripped. The ship was dismantled and recycled by International Shipbreaking Ltd. of Brownsville, TX in late 2005.

He played college football at Auburn University and was drafted in the third round of the 1955 NFL Draft. On January 8, 1955 quarterback Bobby Freeman signed his first pro contract with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the WIFU. It is estimated that the 2-year contract was worth $7500 plus a signing bonus. It is speculated that the contract signing resulted in Freeman dropping in the NFL draft held in late January 1955. He was selected in the 3rd round of the draft by the Cleveland Browns. Shortly after the draft, Freeman signed his second pro contract with the Browns. It was reported that this contract was worth $12,000 per season plus a $2000 signing bonus. In July, Bobby Freeman was a no show at the training camp of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. Later that same month, Freeman reported to the camp of the Cleveland Browns. The Blue Bombers initiated legal action which resulted in a temporary injunction which prevented Freeman from participating in the Browns camp pending a hearing. The hearing was conducted by U.S. federal Judge Paul Jones. The Blue Bombers argued that they had a signed contract and a canceled cheque indicating that Freeman had accepted payment of his signing bonus. Freeman suggested that the Winnipeg club used high pressure tactics in their contract negotiations. The Cleveland Browns argued that they had no prior knowledge of the Winnipeg contract and that Freeman was ordered to remain in the U.S. by the military. On August 15, 1955, Judge Paul Jones ruled in favour of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. The Blue Bombers offered Freeman the opportunity to quarterback the team for the 1955 season under the terms of the original contract. Freeman countered by agreeing to play for Winnipeg if they offered him the same amount he agreed to with the Cleveland Browns. Coach Al Sherman turned down the Freeman request. Freeman remained out of football for the balance of his contract with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. In 1957, he signed with the Cleveland Browns but he never did play quarterback. Although he never played in Canada, Bobby Freeman's contract was a groundbreaking one. As a result of the ruling by Judge Paul Jones, Canadian football teams could sign contracts with American football players knowing that the contract would stand up in an American court of law. https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rhtUAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=8TkNAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7171%2C2510902https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VhtUAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=7jkNAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4379%2C778698https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XxtUAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=7jkNAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5232%2C2204488https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aBtUAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=7jkNAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6210%2C3638128 References External links *NFL.com player page * Category:1932 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Birmingham, Alabama Category:Players of American football from Alabama Category:American football defensive backs Category:Auburn Tigers football players Category:Cleveland Browns players Category:Green Bay Packers players Category:Philadelphia Eagles players Category:Washington Redskins players ","title":"Bobby Freeman (American football)"},{"id":"11769586","text":"Maryland Route 675 (MD 675) is a collection of state highways in the U.S. state of Maryland.

Within the downtown area, MD 675 intersects MD 388 (Antioch Avenue), Prince William Street, which leads to the Teackle Mansion and MD 363, and Dr. William P. Hytche Boulevard, which is unsigned MD 918 and heads east toward the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. MD 675 crosses the Manokin River into a residential neighborhood that contains Manokin Presbyterian Church and the Somerset County Office Complex, reaching an intersection with MD 362 (Mt. Vernon Road). Farther north, MD 675 meets MD 822 (UMES Boulevard), which connects US 13 to the university, at a roundabout, before leaving the town limits of Princess Anne. MD 529 (Loretto Road) splits to the east before MD 675 reaches its northern terminus at ramps to and from northbound US 13 adjacent to the rail line. There is no access from MD 675 to and from southbound US 13; those movements can be completed via MD 822. Delmar MD 675 southbound past DE- MD 54 in Delmar MD 675B begins at an intersection with US 13 (Ocean Highway) north of Salisbury. The state highway heads west from the perpendicular intersection, then turns north onto two-lane undivided Bi-State Boulevard, passing through a mix of farmland, forest, and residences. At Walnut Street, MD 675B enters the town of Delmar, Maryland. The state highway passes through a residential area, cutting northwest through the street grid until the highway reaches its northern terminus at DE-MD 54 (State Street), which runs atop the Delaware state line. Bi-State Boulevard continues north into the town of Delmar, Delaware. History MD 675 MD 675 between Park Drive--which intersects Old Princess Anne Road, the original alignment of US 13 from Princess Anne to Westover--and MD 529 is the original alignment of US 13. The state highway was paved south of downtown Princess Anne toward Westover in 1911 and north of downtown toward Salisbury in 1914. MD 675 north of MD 529 was constructed in 1933 as part of a relocation of US 13 between Princess Anne and Fruitland to bypass the circuitous route via Loretto Road and Allen Road and to eliminate two railroad crossings. MD 675 south of Park Drive was constructed as part of a similar relocation between Princess Anne and Westover in 1935. US 13's present bypass of Princess Anne was constructed between 1957 and 1959. MD 675 was marked through Princess Anne by 1978. In 2010, plans were made to construct a roundabout at the intersection of MD 675 and MD 822 in Princess Anne. The roundabout was completed in 2015. MD 675A MD 675A was a section of MD 675 passing through Pocomoke City in Worcester County and West Pocomoke in Somerset County. The state highway was designated after the completion of US 13's bypass of Pocomoke City around 1963. MD 675 was marked by 1975. The state highway followed what is now US 13 Business, which was assigned in 1994. MD 675B MD 675B is the original alignment of US 13 through Delmar. The highway was paved as a state-aid road by 1921 and rebuilt as a state road in 1923. US 13's present bypass of Delmar was completed in 1954 concurrent with the adjacent section of US 13 in Delaware bypassing Laurel and Seaford. MD 675B was part of US 13 Alternate between 1954 and 1957. MD 675B was marked through Delmar by 1983.

He stands at the head of a Lotharingian dynasty known to modern scholarship as the Reginarids, because of their frequent use of the name \\"Reginar\\". Background Reginar was probably the son of Gilbert, count of the Maasgau, and a daughter of Lothair I whose name is not known (Hiltrude, Bertha, Irmgard, and Gisela are candidate names). In an 877 charter in the Capitulary of Quierzy, he possibly already appears as \\"Rainerus\\", alongside his probable father as one of the regents of the kingdom during Charles the Bald's absence on campaign in Italy.MGH Leg. 1: Capitularia Regum Francorum II p.359 Career Reginar was lay abbot of important abbeys stretching from the Maas to the Moselle through the Ardennes, Saint-Servais in Maastricht, Echternach, Stavelot-Malmedy, and Saint-Maximin in Trier. All these abbeys lay on or near the boundary negotiated between the Eastern and Western Frankish kingdoms in the Treaty of Meerssen in 870, during a period when the Western Kingdom controlled much of Lotharingia. In Echternach, he was referred to as \\"Rainerus iunior\\" because the lay abbot before him, a probable relative, had the same name. Reginar's secular titles and activities are mainly only known from much later sources which are considered to be of uncertain reliability. Dudo of Saint-Quentin, in describing the great deeds of the early Normans, calls Reginar I (who, along with a prince of the Frisians named Radbod, was an opponent of Rollo, the founder of Normandy) a duke of both Hainaut and Hesbaye.Dudo: \\"Raginerum Longi-Colli, Hasbacensem et Hainaucensem ducem\\" Dudo, ii, 9. Centuries later William of Jumièges, and then later still, Alberic de Trois Fontaines followed Dudo using the same titles when describing the same events. He was variously referred to as duke, count, marquis, missus dominicus, but historians doubt that these titles were connected to a particular territory. That he called himself a duke is known from a charter at Stavelot 21 July 905, but this was during a period when Gebhard was duke of Lotharingia.Parisot (1898) p.563 Reginar was originally a supporter of Zwentibold in 895, but he broke with the king in 898. He and some other magnates who had been key to Zwentibold's election three years earlier then took the opportunity provided by the death of Odo of France to invite Charles the Simple to become king in Lotharingia. His lands were confiscated, but he refused to give them up and entrenched himself at Durfost, downstream from Maastricht. Representatives of Charles, Zwentibold, and the Emperor Arnulf met at Sankt Goar and determined that the succession should go to Louis the Child. Zwentibold was killed by Reginar in battle in August 900. Louis appointed Gebhard as his duke in Lotharingia. In 908, Reginar recuperated Hainaut after the death of Sigard. Then, after the death of Gebhard in 910, in battle with the Magyars, Reginar led the magnates in opposing Conrad I of Germany and electing Charles the Simple their king. He never appears as the duke of Lorraine, but he was probably the military commander of the region under Charles. He was succeeded by his son Gilbert; however, the Reginarids did not succeed in establishing their supremacy in Lotharingia like the Liudolfings or Liutpoldings did in the duchies of Saxony and Bavaria. Family By his wife Alberada, who predeceased him and was probably a second wife, Reginar left the following children: *Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine *Reginar II, Count of Hainaut *a daughter, who married Berengar, Count of Namur References Sources *Reuter, Timothy.

The site was the location of the first Bimaristan (from Persian Bimārestān بیمارستان meaning \\"hospital\\") of the Knights Hospitaller. Christian legend The area just south of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre has a long tradition dating to the days of Judas Maccabeus (the 2nd century BC) based on incidents recorded in the Second Book of Maccabees.The Story of Heliodorus. 2 Maccabees 3:1-40. The Struggle of Judas against the neighbouring peoples and against Lysias, Minister of Antiochus V. 2 Maccabees 10-11 In: The New Jerusalem Bible. standard ed. 1985, Darton, Longan & Todd, London, p.721-723, 740. According to the legend, King Antiochus V proceeded to Jerusalem to punish the High Priest for plundering David's Tomb. While on Golgotha, the king was directed in a divine vision to pardon the High Priest, and to build a hospital for the care of the sick and poor on that spot. In 1496, William Caoursin, Vice-Chancellor of the Hospitallers, wrote that Judas Maccabaeus and John Hyrcanus founded the hospital on that spot.W. Caoursin: Stabilimenta Rhodiorum militum, Ulm, 1496. In: E.J. King: The Knights Hospitallers in the Holy Land. 1st ed. 1931, Methuen, London, p.4-5 History Roman Times In 130, Hadrian visited the ruins of Jerusalem, in Judaea, left after the First Roman-Jewish War of 66–73. He rebuilt the city, renaming it Aelia Capitolina after himself and Jupiter Capitolinus, the chief Roman deity. Hadrian placed the city's main Forum at the junction of the main Cardo and Decumanus Maximus, now the location for the (smaller) Muristan. Hadrian built a large temple to the goddess Venus, which later became the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.Virgilio Corbo, The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem (1981) The earliest historical mention of the location Muristan is in 600 AD, when a certain Abbot Probus was commissioned by Pope Gregory the Great to build a hospital in Jerusalem to treat and care for Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. This hospice was most likely destroyed about fourteen years later when Jerusalem fell to the Persian army and the Christian inhabitants were slaughtered, and their churches and monasteries destroyed (see Revolt against Heraclius). The building was probably restored after Jerusalem fell again under Roman dominion in 629. Map of the Christian Quarter in Jerusalem, the Muristan with the Church of St. John is shown lower right-hand corner (click image to enlarge). Arab rule Arab rule after 637 allowed freedom of worship, and the restored hospice was probably allowed to continue serving its original purpose. In 800, Charlemagne, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, enlarged the hostel and added a library to it. Bernard the Monk, who wrote an account of his visit to Jerusalem in 870, mentions a Benedictine hospital close to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 993, Hugh Marquis of Tuscany and his wife endowed the hospital with considerable property in Italy. In 1009, Fatimid caliph Al Hakim destroyed the hostel and a large number of other buildings in Jerusalem.E.J. King: op. cit., p.5-11. In 1023, merchants from Amalfi and Salerno in Italy were given permission by the caliph Ali az-Zahir to rebuild the hospice, monastery and chapel in Jerusalem. Among these merchants from Amalfi and Salerno was also Mauros, merchant from Amalfi, of a family from Constantinople, Miletus and Amalfi, who gave together with his mother Anna and her brother Constantine a gift to the convent of Saint Lawrence in Amalfi,Health and medicine in early medieval Southern Italy, Patricia Skinner, Brill Publishers, Leiden 1997. which probably had some connection to blessed Gerard the founder of the Order of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem the Knights Hospitaller. In Palestine and Syria, there was a revolt among the Bedouins (1024–1029). In an agreement in 1027 between Ali az- Zahir and Constantine VIII, Constantine VIII allowed the name of the caliph to be acknowledged in the mosques in the emperor's domain and the mosque at Constantinople to be restored.Phyllis G. Jestice, Holy people of the world: a cross-cultural encyclopedia, Volume 3 (2004), p. 935. The hospice, which was built on the site of the monastery of Saint John the Baptist, took in Christian pilgrims travelling to visit the holy sites. To the east of this hospital, separated from it by a lane, a new hospital for pilgrims was built in 1080. Both hospitals remained under the control of the Benedictine abbot. Moréri, Grand dictionnaire historique, s.v. \\"Gerard, surnommé Thom\\", vol. 5 p. 159. In 1078, Jerusalem was captured by the Seljuk Turks who abused the Christian population, forced pilgrims to pay a heavy tax to visit the Holy Places, and even kidnapped the Patriarch of Jerusalem. In spite of the persecution, the Benedictine hospital continued its ministry. Archbishop John of Amalfi records that during his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1082, he visited the hospital. In August 1098, the Turks were ousted by the Egyptian vizier, Al Afdal.Asbridge, T: \\"The First Crusade\\", p.285. Oxford, 2004. Towards the end of the Egyptian occupation (July 1099), the Hospital for Women was being managed by a noble Roman lady, named Agnes, while the Hospital for Men was under the direction of a monk known as Brother Gerard.E.E. Hume: op. cit., p.4-5; E.J. King: op. cit., p.11-14. Crusades Godfrey of Bouillon who endowed the hospital in the Muristan after the First Crusade. Fresco in the Manta Castle. In the First Crusade, during the siege of Jerusalem (1099), the Egyptian governor, Iftikhar ad Dawla, imprisoned Brother Gerard. When Jerusalem fell to Godfrey of Bouillon, he freed Brother Gerard, allowed him to resume his management of the Hospital for Men, and contributed resources to his work. Gerard adopted the policy of receiving all needy patients, irrespective of religion. While the Hospital for Women remained under the control of the Benedictines, Brother Gerard broke off from that Order, adopted the Augustinian rule and organised the Fratres Hospitalarii into a regularly constituted Religious Order under the protection of saint John the Baptist. The members of the Order thus became known as Knights of St. John or Hospitallers. The formal establishment of the Knights Hospitaller under Brother Gerard was confirmed by a Papal bull of Pope Paschal II in 1113. Gerard acquired territory and revenues for his order throughout the Kingdom of Jerusalem and beyond. His successor, Raymond du Puy de Provence, significantly enlarged the infirmary. The earliest description of the first hospital of the Sovereign Military Order of St. John in Jerusalem was written by a German pilgrim John of Würzburg who visited Jerusalem in about the year 1160: > Over against the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, on the opposite side of the > way towards the south, is a beautiful church built in honour of John the > Baptist, annexed to which is a hospital, wherein in various rooms is > collected together an enormous multitude of sick people. Both men and women. > Who are tended and restored to health daily at very great expense. When I > was there I learned that the whole number of these sick people amounted to > two thousand, of whom sometimes in the course of one day and night more than > fifty are carried out dead, while many other fresh ones keep continually > arriving. What more can I say?

In addition to all these moneys expended upon the sick and > upon other poor people, this same house also maintains in its various > castles many persons trained to all kinds of military exercises for the > defence of the land of the Christians against the invasion of the > Saracens.Description of the Holy Land by John of Würzburg.

Later medieval period After the Siege of Jerusalem in October 1187, all Christians were driven out of Jerusalem by Sultan Saladin. The Hospitallers were permitted to leave ten of their number in the city to care for the wounded until they were able to travel. Saladin turned the Hospitallers buildings over to the Mosque of Omar. His nephew in 1216 instituted a lunatic asylum in what had been the conventual church, and it was at this time that the area came to be referred to as the Muristan.E.E. Hume: op. cit., p.6. The hospital facilities continued to be used for the care of the sick and wounded. The site was deserted in the 16th century, and the magnificent structures eventually fell into ruin. Modern history The Church of the Redeemer (Erlöserkirche), in 1900. Order of the Knights of St. John. In 1868, the Sultan Mehmed VI presented the eastern part of this area to Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia, during his visit to Jerusalem. The prince was at the time the Master of the Johanniterorden, the Protestant successor to a former branch of the Knights Hospitaller. The German knights built a road through the Muristan from north to south, calling it Prince Frederick William Street, and the property became the centre of the German colony in Jerusalem. Beginning in 1841, German Protestant Christians came to Palestine to support the Christian minority in the area through diaconal and missionary work. The German government contributed to the process of removing rubble in the area and rebuilding. In the late 1800s, they rebuilt the Crusader church of St. Mary Latina as the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer (Erlöserkirche). The old cloisters, refectory, and original plan of the medieval church were preserved in the present neo-Romanesque building. Kaiser Wilhelm II personally attended the dedication of the church on 31 October 1898 (Reformation Day), when he and his wife, Augusta Victoria, became the first western rulers to visit Jerusalem. The Church of the Redeemer, under control of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) through the Evangelical Jerusalem Foundation (Evangelische Jerusalemstiftung, EJSt) currently houses the ELCA-sponsored English-speaking congregation, a German-speaking congregation, and an indigenous Arabic- speaking congregation. The church is also the headquarters of the German Propst and the Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan (ELCJ). In order to secure equal representation, in 1868 the Sultan assigned the western part of the Muristan to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate. It is now occupied by the Greek bazaar, which specializes in leather goods. A ceremonial gateway off of Muristan Street leads to this Muristan area, called Suq Aftimos, and from thence to a set of short intersecting streets with shops and a few cafes. The street arrangements were constructed in 1903 by the Greek Orthodox authority. In the centre of the bazaar area is an ornamental fountain (19th century); at the north end is the Mosque of Omar, built in 1216 by Saladin's son to commemorate Caliph Omar's visit to Jerusalem in 638, when he prayed on the steps of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre instead of inside so that it could remain a Christian holy place. Archaeology Excavations of the Muristan were conducted around the start of the 20th century, and showed that the Hospitaller complex occupied an approximately square area measuring 160 yards (east-west) and 143 yards (north-south). In the early decades of the twentieth century little was left of the original buildings. The remains included the Church of Mar Hanna, a series of arches on David Street, and the remains of the north door of the Hospitaller's church of St. Mary Latina, which were incorporated into the modern Church of the Redeemer. What remains of the hospital today is a modern memorial situated in a small recess barred from the street with an iron gate and an enclosed yard. The archaeological park opened in November 2012 \\"Durch die Zeiten\\", located below the nave of the Church of the Redeemer offers the possibility to commit more than 2000 years of history of the city of Jerusalem by walking through it.excavator's website: and Church's website:  References  External links * The Muristan(aerial photograph) * Old City of Jerusalem--Muristan area (picture tour with commentary) * Entrance to the Muristan (photo) Category:Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem Category:Christianity in Jerusalem Category:Crusade places Category:Historic sites in Jerusalem Category:Knights Hospitaller Category:Establishments in the Kingdom of Jerusalem Category:Bimaristans ","title":"Muristan"},{"id":"11769786","text":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Tôla(g)naro () is a Latin suffragan diocese in the Ecclesiastical province of Toliara in Madagascar, yet still depends on the missionary Roman Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. Its cathedral episcopal see is in Tôla(g)naro .  Statistics  As per 2014 it pastorally served 128,000 Catholics (11.4% of 1,120,000 total) on 45,000 km² in 16 parishes and 2 missions with 37 priests (17 diocesan, 20 religious), 134 lay religious (36 brothers, 98 sisters) and 15 seminarians.  Antecedents  *Early 16th century - First Roman Catholic priests to Madagascar arrive with a colony of Portuguese emigrants who established a community at Tranovato, some 9 km. west of Fort Dauphin bay. They were mostly Jesuits, not Portuguese by birth, and were reportedly all massacred with the rest of the settlers during a celebration held outside their fort. *1613 - Jesuit Fathers Mariana and Freire, aboard the Portuguese Nossa Senhora, performed daily Mass on the shore of Ranofotsy bay, while this ship was there. Of the Antanosy which came to observe this, some sought to kiss the image of Saint Luke while others were wearing pewter crosses around their necks and some even had tattoos of crosses. Father Mariana establishes a chapel and house at the old Tranovato site, preaching daily while the house was being constructed. Drian-Ramaka, the 12 year old Antanosy son of the local Antanosy king, was kidnapped and sent to Goa for 2 years of study at the Jesuit College of Santa Fe. *1615 - Drian- Ramaka, having been baptized, returns to Anosy with 3 Jesuit missionaries and 5 other foreigners, where they established a mission at Tranovato in 1616. Fathers Custodio de Costa and Manuel d'Almeida remain in Anosy, but conflicts grow with the local ombiasa and king, who seeks to starve them into exile. The mission only succeeds in baptizing one person before they leave in 1617. *1620 - Jesuits abandon their mission efforts in Anosy, never to return. *1648 - First Lazarist missionaries were sent from France by St. Vincent de Paul to Fort Dauphin. The first superior of this Lazarist mission was M. Nacquart who left France with the Sieur de Flacourt, the Governor sent by the Societe de l'Orient, and his associate, M. Gondree. They worked on evangelization amid many difficulties, but M. Gondree died in 1649 and M. Nacquart died from fever in 1650. During these 14 months of work, 77 people were baptized. *1654 - MM. Mounier and Bourdaise arrived to continue the missionary work, but they too, soon died. Three additional missionaries sent to their assistance never reached Fort Dauphin as they all died en route. *1663 - M. Almeras, the successor of St. Vincent de Paul in the government of the Congregation of St. Lazare, sent M. Etienne, Apostolic prefect, to Fort-Dauphin with two brethren and several workmen. On Christmas Day he baptized 15 little children and 4 adults, but then died soon thereafter. *1665-67 - 9 new missionaries, 4 lay brothers and 2 Recollect Fathers left for Fort Dauphin. At one time Fort Dauphin had a chapel, monastery and library. *1671 - The Compagnie des Indes, which had succeeded to the Société de l'Orient, decided to quit Madagascar, so M. Jolly, M. Almeras' successor, recalled his missionaries in Fort Dauphin. Only 2 out of a total of 37 who had been sent to the island, were able to return to France, arriving back there in 1676. On the other hand, by the time they left in 1674, hundreds of Antanosy had been baptized and both a French- Antanosy dictionary and a Catechism in the Antanosy language had been published in Paris.

Junior and college football Bill Baker played junior football for the Regina Rams in 1963, and college football at Otterbein College, where he was a First Team All-Star for four years. CFL career Baker played in a total of 174 games over eleven seasons with the Saskatchewan Roughriders (1968–1973, 1977–1978) and BC Lions (1974–1976). He was a Division All-Star five times, and won the CFL's Most Outstanding Defensive Player Award in 1976 as a member of the Lions. Saskatchewan 1960s In 1968, Saskatchewan had the fewest points allowed in the CFL with 223, including teams in the Eastern division with two fewer games played, but lost in the Western conference final to the Calgary Stampeders. In 1969, the Roughrider defence allowed 261 points, second in the conference, and won the Western conference final, but the passing attack of the Russ Jackson-led Ottawa Rough Riders was too much for them in the 57th Grey Cup. Saskatchewan 1970s: first time around In 1970, the Saskatchewan defence dominated the league again with 206 points allowed, but could not beat Calgary in the Western conference final, or beat Calgary in the Western conference final in 1971. In 1972, the Roughriders beat the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Western conference final, but, despite limiting the Hamilton Tiger-Cats to just 13 points, lost the 60th Grey Cup game because of a weak offence. In the 1973 season, the Roughriders could not get by the Edmonton Eskimos in the Western conference final. British Columbia Baker had a 3-year stint with the BC Lions, less successful as a team than Saskatchewan during this period. In the 1974 season, BC lost to Saskatchewan in the semifinal. In the 1975 and 1976 seasons, the team could not reach the playoffs. Baker won the defensive player of the year award in 1976 despite BC's mediocre 336 points allowed and 5-9-2 record. Saskatchewan 1970s: second time around Baker ended his career with a 2-year stint with his former team, Saskatchewan, but neither in 1977 nor in 1978 did Saskatchewan make the playoffs. Thus, Baker's career ended on a losing note, his team finishing last in the Western conference with a record of 4-11-1. Canadian Football Hall of Fame Despite never having played on a Grey Cup winner, Baker was inducted to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1994 and, in 2006, was listed at #43 on the TSN Top 50 CFL Players list. His credo was \\"your opponents are only as tough as you let them be.\\" According to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, \\"a Baker forearm to the head was greatly respected by opposing quarterbacks who came within range.\\" Saskatchewan 1980s: third time around Bill Baker became general manager of the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1987-1988. 1989: CFL president When the CFL split its commissioner role into two positions after the departure of Douglas Mitchell, Baker became CFL President/Chief Operating Officer in 1989, with Roy McMurtry, Q.C. holding the position of Chairman/Chief Executive Officer. When Baker resigned, McMurtry continued as Chairman and CEO until Crump's appointment but did not serve as Acting Commissioner.

These four highways are sections of the old alignment of U.S. Route 213 (US 213, now US 50) in northeastern Worcester County. These stretches of highway were bypassed and designated part of MD 707 in the early 1940s in West Ocean City and in the late 1940s in Grays Corner. Route description MD 707A, which is known as Old Bridge Road, runs from US 50 to MD 611 within West Ocean City. MD 707B, MD 707E, and MD 707D, which are both known as Grays Corner Road, run , and , respectively, within Grays Corner. MD 707A MD 707A begins at an intersection with US 50 (Ocean Gateway) just east of Herring Creek in West Ocean City. The state highway heads east as a two-lane undivided road. After passing by residential subdivisions, MD 707A reaches its eastern terminus at MD 611 (Stephen Decatur Highway). Old Bridge Road continues east as a county highway to Sinepuxent Bay where the old bridge crossed into Ocean City in line with Worcester Street. MD 707B and MD 707E View east along MD 707B at MD 452 in Grays Corner MD 707B begins at a dead end near Berlin, adjacent to US 50. The state highway heads east and immediately encounters MD 452. The state highway continues east as a two-lane undivided road paralleling US 50 on the north at a distance, passing farms and residences. At the intersection with MD 589 (Racetrack Road) in Grays Corner, access across is restricted, with MD 707B ending and MD 707E beginning. MD 707E parallels US 50 closely until the end of state maintenance just west of Riddle Lane, which is unsigned US 50WA. MD 707D MD 707D begins at a cul- de-sac adjacent to US 50 a short distance east of the eastern terminus of MD 707B. The state highway heads east as a two-lane undivided road paralleling US 50 on the north from a distance and connects with the federal highway via Herring Creek Lane and an unnamed road, which are designated US 50WB and US 50WC, respectively. MD 707D reaches its eastern terminus at a dead end adjacent to US 50 a short distance west of Herring Creek. History What is now MD 707 is much of the original alignment of the Berlin-Ocean City road that was paved east to West Ocean City in 1915. The highway was completed when the first automobile bridge across Sinepuxent Bay opened in 1916. The highway was designated the easternmost part of US 213 in 1927. Present day MD 707A was bypassed in 1942 when the present bridge to Ocean City and the dual highway approach west to Herring Creek opened. The bypassed portion of US 213 remained a state highway and was designated MD 707 by 1948. The segment of MD 707 west of Herring Creek was bypassed in 1950 when the dual highway, which had just been renumbered US 50, was extended to just west of MD 452. MD 707A's eastern terminus was rolled back from Sinepuxent Bay to MD 611 in 2001.

The film was originally released on both LaserDisc and VHS format in Japan in 1983. It was dubbed in English and released on VHS in 1985 by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video and Magic Window. The soundtrack for the film was originally produced by IRUKA but was rerecorded by Charlotte Russe Music for the English dub. Plot The film is centered on Noel, a young girl and her dog, Pup, who both live on the Planet Noel. While relaxing, Noel seems to notice that the sun is too hot and encourages that it be fed ice cream to cool it down. The duo fly off in Noel's plane and begin making progress toward the sun. On their way, the two of them spot a faint blinking light. As they head closer to the light, it begins to form the shape of a planet. The two make a landing on the planet, and, upon their arrival, the President steps out to welcome them and invites them to a special party, in which the Emcees show off the planet's most beautiful designs. This does not impress Noel, who states that it doesn't matter what clothes one is wearing, they will still be beautiful and loved. This idea coaxes the President and the citizens of the planet to take their clothes off, as does Noel. Pup gently reminds Noel of their trip to the sun, and the two resume their journey to meet him. Upon their meeting, the sun is grateful of the ice cream Noel was able to deliver, and also warns of foul smog rising from some unknown planet. The two bid their farewells and attempt to pinpoint the source of the smog, but it quickly surrounds them. They escape underwater on another nearby planet. They appreciate the fine scenery underwater, but as they traverse further, they notice some of the sea life has fallen ill. Below them, on the floor of the sea, sludge begins to form.

The word has its roots from the Greek crypto, meaning secret, and phasia, meaning speech. Most linguists associate cryptophasia with idioglossia, which is any language used by only one, or very few, people. Cryptophasia also differs from idioglossia on including mirrored actions like twin-walk and identical mannerisms.  Classification  It has been reported that up to 50% of young twins will have their own twin language which they use to communicate only with each other and cannot be understood by others. \\"In all cases known, the language consists of onomatopoeic expressions, some neologisms, but for the greatest part of words from the adult language adapted to the constrained phonological possibilities of young children. These words being hardly recognizable, the language may turn out to be completely unintelligible to speakers of the parents' languages, but they resemble each other in that they lack morphology and that word order is based on pragmatic principles such as saliency and the semantic scope of words. Neither the structure of the languages nor its emergence can be explained by other than situational factors.\\"  Causes  A delay in the phonological development of one or both twins (or two siblings at similar age of language development) is said to be a main cause of cryptophasia. Twins can develop the ability to communicate with one another without working within the grammar of their parents' language, thus possibly leading to a short-term delay in linguistic development of one or both twins. The causes seem largely not to be in the greater pre- and perinatal biological problems twins may experience, but rather in postnatal factors. These factors occur within the family environment and include both a reduced quality of verbal stimulation and interaction with adult language models which result from greater demands of care-giving made on parents of twins, and the intensive interaction between twins which may increase their chances of developing cryptophasia and idioglossia at the expense of conventional language.  Social effects  An article in Slate dealt with what is observed about the social effects of cryptophasia between twins and how it relates to societies. \\"Societies need unambiguous ways to distinguish between subject and object,\\" Bakker says. \\"In the twin situation these can be dispensed with, but not in languages in which it is necessary to refer to events outside the direct situation.\\"Jon Lackman (August 24, 2011) \\"Dugon, Haus You Dinikin, Du-Ah\\", Slate  Examples  June and Jennifer Gibbons were twin sisters living in Wales whose language was an example of cryptophasia and was exemplified by the twins' simultaneous actions, which often mirrored each other. Grace and Virginia Kennedy, born in the United States in 1970, developed their own private language, characterized by an extremely fast tempo and staccato rhythm.

(retrieved 30 Nov 2009) It is located east of Pendleton, on the Umatilla Indian Reservation, near Interstate 84. History The casino opened in temporary buildings on November 5, 1994, run by Capital Gaming International Inc., with the tribe taking over as managers in 1999. The resort has expanded each year since its beginning, doubling the size of the casino in 2002 and 2003, adding a conference center in 2004, completely renovating its 100-room hotel in 2005 and expanding in 2006-07 to add four food and beverage venues: a buffet restaurant, a fine-dining restaurant, a sports bar, a coffee shop and a 24-hour restaurant. After contentious discussion within the tribal community, the previously \\"dry\\" (not serving alcoholic beverages) resort, located on a dry reservation, began serving alcoholic beverages on May 5, 2006. Because of this change, a lounge, Wildhorse Sports Bar, opened in May 2007. Work begin in 2010 to expand the hotel by 202 rooms with a ten-story tower, and add to the casino. The $45 million project was completed in October 2011. Amenities Hotel construction in May 2011 Key components of the resort are a casino, five screen cineplex with two 3D screens, golf course, hotel, recreational vehicle park, children's entertainment center, teepee camping village, Arrowhead Travel Plaza and the Tamástslikt Cultural Institute tribal museum. The casino offers poker, roulette, blackjack, craps, Spanish 21, bingo, keno and just over 1200 slot machines, 30% of which are in a no- smoking area. The golf course is a championship, 18-hole course designed by John Steidel that opened in 1997, with approximately 30,000 rounds played annually and hosting about 80 tournaments. It includes a driving range, practice greens, rental clubs, a pro shop, and a variety of teaching programs. Seven restaurants are part of the resort and casino: WildRoast Cafe, the Clubhouse Grill, Hot Rock Cafe, Kinship Cafe, Traditions Buffet, The Wildhorse Sports Bar and Plateau Fine Dining. The hotel is connected to the casino while the RV Park is located nearby, between the casino and golf course. The Tamástslikt Cultural Institute, located on the resort grounds, includes permanent and rotating exhibits on the history and culture of the three tribes who make up the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR): the Cayuse, Umatilla and Walla Walla. The resort has sparked an economic boom for the CTUIR, which has increased the tribal operating budget from less than $10 million in 1992 to approximately $145 million in 2007. That grew to $190 million in 2010 as the casino draws approximately 750,000 people each year. The largest expenditures and the largest single department in the tribal government are devoted to protecting and restoring natural resources on the reservation and throughout the traditional homelands of the three tribes. To this end, the tribes are one of the largest employers of biologists and other environmental scientists in the region.

For many years he directed a weekly radio programme in the Breton language and co-founded a summer festival at Quimper which became the Festival de Cornouaille. Life and work Helias was born in 1914 in Pouldreuzig, Penn-ar-Bed, Brittany. He had a modest upbringing, but this included a good education. After a career in the French Resistance during the Second World War, in 1946 Helias was appointed as director of a weekly programme in Breton on Radio Kimerc'h. Working with Pierre Trépos, he created hundreds of dialogues, many of them between two stock characters, Gwilhou Vihan and Jakez Kroc'hen. In 1948 he was the co-founder, with François Bégot and Jo Halleguen, of Les grandes Fêtes de Cornouaille, a major summer festival of Breton life.Peter Neary, 'Brittany: Theatre', in White Tie and Decorations: Sir John and Lady Hope Simpson in Newfoundland, pp. 175-177 online The theatre was Helias's favourite genre, as he was convinced that the Breton reality was primarily a spoken one, so that it could best be captured by drama, and much of his early work was in the form of plays and scripts for radio. His An Isild a-heul, or Yseulte seconde (1963), was a three-act tragedy based on the story of Tristan and Isolde, but with a focus on Tristan's wife rather than his lover. Written first in Breton, it was published in a dual text, with a French translation on the facing page, and was broadcast on the France Culture radio station in 1965.Joan T. Grimbert, Tristan and Isolde: a casebook, pp. 78-79 online Helias's best-known and most often performed play is Mevel ar Gosker, or 'The Yardman of Kosker'. A mevel bras (majordomo) was the most important Breton farm worker, a man who might enjoy many privileges, but he was not of the landowning class and it was inconceivable in the old Brittany that he could aspire to marry into it. However, the mevel of the play, Jakez Mano, contrives by a complicated means to marry his master's daughter, God Konan. The fact that he can not only think of this but even achieve it is seen as proof that the old Brittany, in which marriages were decided by social status and by the ownership of land, is dying. Helias's poetry includes two collections in Breton, Ar men du (1974, The Black Stone) and An tremen-buhez (1979, The Pastime). An important theme in his work is his devotion to the Breton language and its power. One of his lines translates as \\"Breton speaker that I am, my heritage lies on my tongue, it shall never be yours\\".Brezoneger wa 'z on, war ma zeod eman ma berez, birviken ne vo deoh. His best-selling work is his autobiographical Le cheval d'orgueil, or The Horse of Pride, adapted for cinema by Claude Chabrol in 1980, rooted in the Bigoudenn area south of Quimper. This was also published in Breton as Marh ar lorh, after its success on screen had turned Helias into a national celebrity.Diarmuid Johnson, 'Helias, Pêr-Jakez (1914–95)', in John T. Koch (ed.), Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia, Volumes 1-5 (2006), pp. 900-901 Helias also collected folk tales from his native Brittany and published work on the Breton language and culture. He became a major figure in Breton literature during the last third of the 20th century. Despite his importance in Brittany, Helias came under fire from the radicals promoting the revival of the Breton language. This was only partly due to his willingness to work primarily in French and his refusal to disapprove of the use of that language. In his important and influential Le cheval d'orgueil, Helias was accused of presenting a disappearing Breton world without obvious regret, and he says in the book that he enjoyed learning French. The book appeared first in French, and the English translation was available before there was one into Breton. The radicals condemned it as folklore.Maryon McDonald, 'The politics of fieldwork in Brittany', in Anthony Jackson (ed.), Anthropology at home (1987), pp. 126-127 One commentator has said of this \\"Brittany's two writers most famous in France as a whole, Per-Jakez Helias and Jean-Edern Hallier, are regarded with some scorn by the Breton zealots.\\"John Ardagh, France in the 1980s (1982), p. 134 Helias died on 13 August 1995.

The central character is abandoned by her birth mother because the father was a foreigner (gadje) and later adopted by a wealthy Lebanese couple. Theme In this book, Coelho works with the return to the goddess religion, the interpretation of love, and the feminine part of the Divine within the theme of searching for one’s true self and opening to the energies of the world.NPR: Coelho Explores Goddesses in 'Witch of Portobello' The question central to the story is \\"How do we find the courage to be true to ourselves - even if we are unsure of who we are?\\" The work also expounds a selection of philosophies, which bear a certain degree of similarity to Coelho's teachings from previous novels and carry the characteristic imprint of his own ideas, as well as a citation regarding the ephemeral nature of desires, which appears in most of Coelho's novels. The writer elucidates the opinion that the Church has deviated by its stringent rules to the point where it no longer serves Jesus Christ, or as put in his words in one of the interviews: \\"It's a very long time since they've allowed me in there [the Church]\\". Plot As the book begins, Athena is dead. How she ended up that way creates the intrigue sustaining the book.AAP May 2007 The child, Sherine Khalil renames herself Athena after her uncle was discussing with her mother on how her real name will betray her origins and something like Athena gave nothing away. As a child, she shows a strong religious vocation and reports seeing angels and saints, which both impresses and worries her parents. She goes into a London University to pursue Engineering at the age of 19, but it's not what her heart wanted. One day she just decides that she wanted to drop out of college, get married and have a baby. Here, the author mentions that this might be due to the fact that she was abandoned herself and wants to give all that love she could to her child which she didn't receive from her birth mother. Two years later, her marriage falls apart because they are facing too many problems due to their young age and lack of money or mostly because he felt that she loved only the child and used him to get what she wanted. A very interesting quote she uses is \\"From Ancient Greece on, the people who returned from battle were either dead on their shields or stronger, despite or because of their scars. It's better that way: I've lived on a battlefield since I was born, but I'm still alive and I don't need anyone to protect me.\\" She grows into a woman in search of answers to many questions that arise within a person. She had a life which many felt was content because she had a child of her own, money, and friends; everything but her mind was at peace, so she searches for the answer to the classical question of \\"Who am I?\\" through many experiences. In her quest, she opens her heart to intoxicating powers of mother and becomes a controversial spiritual leader in London.

Looss was sent by Rudolf Leuckart to Egypt to study the transmission of bilharzia, where he became accidentally infected with hookworm, and in so doing discovered the method by which the larvae penetrate the skin.

He examined his faeces at intervals and found hookworm eggs in it a few weeks later. The paper he wrote about the life cycle of the hookworm is considered a classic in the field. He later described the species as Ancylostoma duodenale. Looss continued to work as a professor of parasitology and biology in Egypt until the outbreak of the First World War.

The definition is certainly not universal. Energy Watch Group uses a different definition, P95. More terms Disregarding economics, the proper engineering term for the total technologically extractable amount is the Producible fraction, which is easily confused with the business term proven reserves. However, the purely engineering term is also misleading in that squeezing the last bits of fossil fuel out follows the diminishing returns and at some point is so costly that it becomes highly impractical, as seen on a bell curve, which is why measures like P90 and P95 were created. The term proven reserves is further subdivided into proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves. Note that it does not include unproven reserves, which is broken down into probable reserves as well as possible reserves. These reserve categories are totaled up by the measures 1P, 2P, and 3P, which are inclusive of all reserves types: * \\"1P reserves\\" = proven reserves (both proved developed reserves + proved undeveloped reserves). * \\"2P reserves\\" = 1P (proven reserves) + probable reserves, hence \\"proved AND probable.\\"Petroleum review: 62 p732-743 Institute of Petroleum (Great Britain) - 2008 \\"The field is estimated to hold some 66mn barrels of proved and probable (2P) oil reserves and 143mn barrels of proved, probable and possible (3P) reserves. \\" * \\"3P reserves\\" = the sum of 2P (proven reserves + probable reserves) + possible reserves, all 3Ps \\"proven AND probable AND possible.\\"Offshore Oil Industry Lexicon 2-1 3P RESERVES Proven, Probable plus Possible reserves (3P) are those reserves that , to a low degree of certainty (10% confidence), are recoverable. There is relatively high risk associated with these reserves.Vivek Chandra Fundamentals of natural gas: an international perspective 2006 p20 \\"Probable reserves are unproved reserves that analysis of geological and engineering data suggests are likely to be ... exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves, also known as “P + Probable + Possible = 3P” reserves. \\"Energy, Environment and Development p55 José Goldemberg, Oswaldo Lucon - 2009 \\"3P): reserves that have about 10 per cent probability of exploitation, under favourable circumstances.\\" New proven reserves are commonly added by new field discoveries. Reserves growth also commonly occurs in previously existing fields, as the characteristics of the reservoir become better understood, as fields are extended laterally, or new oil and gas reservoirs are found in existing fields. Reserve growth may also take place due to technological and economic changes. Russian reserve categories In Russia, reserves categories A, B, and C correspond roughly to developed producing reserves, undeveloped reserves (development is approved), and discovered resources without a firm plan to develop yet, respectively; the designation ABC corresponds to discovered resources.

History In 1634, the House of Burgesses established the boundaries of Warwick County in Jamestown. The government of the counties was to parallel that of England. First and foremost was the appointment of a sheriff. The sheriff was responsible for collecting taxes, serving warrants, maintaining order in the county, protecting the court, and running the jail. He had no deputies but could call upon the militia for help when so required. The first Warwick County jail, courthouse and clerk's office were built on the site where the City Farm now sits. It was after the American Revolutionary War that the Sheriff's Office became an elected office and the duties expanded. Now, the sheriff was a law enforcement officer assigned to keeping the peace and maintaining law and order. It was at this time the sheriff was authorized to hire constables to assist in performing duties. In 1810, a new municipal complex was constructed in Denbigh, including a two-story jail. The sheriff's office and two small cells occupied the first floor. And four cells were on the second. The sheriff was allocated fifty-cents per prisoner per day for food. As time went on, expansions and renovations were made to the courthouse and jail. A new jail was built in the winter of 1899. But it became evident that \\"sick mortar\\" was used when prisoner escapes became frequent. The mortar used to bond the brick walls turned to powder when scratched. For repair, sheet iron lined cell walls. During the 1920s and 30s, the biggest problem in the county were illegal distilleries. The jail reached peak capacity. Nearby Fort Eustis became a medium security prison for moonshiners in a seven-state area. Citizens voted to be incorporated into Newport News in 1959. Before there was even a City of Newport News, there was a Sheriff of the region. In August 1976, the current jail in downtown Newport News was built. It is a maximum security, seven-story building. It was originally designed to house 248 inmates. Renovations were completed in 1993. Current jail problems parallel historic issues. The inmate population has exceeded peak capacity. During prohibition there was an abundance of illegal distilleries, while illegal drugs have become the main contemporary problem. Many crimes being committed throughout the city stem from drug activity. It is the goal of the sheriff's office to rehabilitate jail inmates and reduce recidivism. Educational and work programs offered inside the jail are intended to help individuals succeed outside upon release. The Sheriff's Office also provides some law enforcement services alongside the Newport News Police Department, including three K-9 dog units, fugitive and drug interdiction units, motorcycle unit, traffic unit and court security unit.

It's a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Structure Sonnet 119 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 3rd line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: × /× / × / × / × / Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears, (119.3) An unusual number of lines (5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12) feature a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending, as for example: / × × / / × × / × / (×) How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted, (119.7) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus.

He scored Walsall's winning goal in their shock FA Cup third round victory over Newcastle United in January 1975. Career Andrews began his career as an apprentice with Luton Town in the late 1950s, turning professional in 1960 but leaving the following year without making a first team appearance having suffered from homesickness. He continued his career at non-league level with Lower Gornal Athletic in 1961, reaching the Football League in October 1965 after signing for Cardiff City, along with Gary Bell for a fee of £2,100, a record transfer fee for Gornal that still stands, having been spotted by manager Jimmy Scoular. He made his first team debut just a few days later in a 2–1 defeat against Portsmouth, before scoring his first goal for the club a week later in a second 2–1 defeat against Bolton Wanderers. He went on to finish his first professional season with 20 goals in all competitions and scored 6 in the opening 12 matches of the following season before being displaced by new signing Bobby Brown and was allowed to leave to join Southport for £6,000 in February 1967, a club record fee at the time. Signed by manager Billy Bingham as a replacement for Jim Fryatt who had left to join Torquay United, he scored on his debut during a 3–0 victory over Barnsley on 4 March 1967. He quickly established himself in the first-team and, on the final day of the 1966–67 season, he scored the only goal of the game during a 1–0 victory over Southend United which secured promotion to the Third Division for Southport. He left Southport in November 1969 after the club began suffering financial difficulties, joining Shrewsbury Town for a fee of £10,000. In January 1973, Andrews signed for Walsall in a swap deal, along with £6,000, for Geoff Morris. He spent the final four seasons of his professional career there, playing 159 league games and scoring 38 goals.

The film stars Van Heflin, James MacArthur, Rita Moreno and Leopoldo Salcedo. Set during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the working title was To Be a Man. Plot The film begins on December 8, 1941 with the Japanese attacking the Philippines. Dave McVey Jr., the son of a rich American businessman with extensive holdings in the Philippines, is attacked by murderous bandits. He is rescued by Careo, a Filipino patriot who has put together a group of anti-Japanese Filipino guerrillas. Carero hides Dave with an elderly Filpino and his granddaughter, who teach Dave Tagalog. Careo returns again to tell Dave that his father has left the Philippines, but Dave is joined by a fellow American, Joe Trent, a rough merchant sailor who was third mate on a cargo ship that was sunk by the Japanese. Joe's ship was part of a merchant line owned by Dave's father. Joe figures that Dave's father will reward him for keeping his son safe. Joe gets drunk and rapes the teenage granddaughter. When the girl starts screaming, Dave has no choice but to flee with Joe. They meet a band of armed Filipinos led by Atong and the English- speaking woman Sisa. The quick-thinking Joe tells the band that if they bring them to Colonel Ryker, an American officer in charge of a guerrilla unit, Ryker will reward them. Ryker tells Dave that the Japanese would probably give him a comfortable existence and might repatriate him to the United States because of his father's extensive business dealings with Japan. Dave replies that his father's connections to Japan were from before the war and he would rather fight with the guerrillas. The group joins Ryker's unit in fighting the Japanese. Joe is promoted to lieutenant and is to accompany a Filipino captain on a raid against a Japanese-held sugar refinery and railway. Joe brings Dave, Atong, Sisa and a group of their original band on the mission. After the captain is killed, Atong kills one of his own men over the captain's pistol. Joe makes Atong give the pistol to Dave. Not wishing to complete their mission, Joe sends Dave and Sisa into a village to ask the locals for food. As they are negotiating, Joe's band massacres the villagers to steal their rice, with Joe shooting Atong during the raid. Sisa quickly switches her loyalties to Joe.

Garcia Production Producer Joe Steinberg had a wealthy brother named Harry Stonehill in the Philippines who assisted with the financing of the film. He hired his friends Irving Lerner to direct and Bernard Gordon to write the screenplay. Gordon saw the opportunity to use the screenplay as a comment on American attitudes towardThird World people and attitudes about masculinity, explaining the film's working title of To Be a Man. In the film, Dave asks Joe if raping his host's granddaughter made him feel like a man. Joe responds that fighting when necessary and having a woman when possible meant feeling like a man. Joe also initiates Dave into manhood by using his winnings in a poker game to give Dave a night with a prostitute. In Dave's first battle, he captures a panicked Japanese soldier, and Joe grabs Dave's hands and holds his rifle with bayonet, which he thrusts into the prisoner. Rita Moreno's scenes were shot around her travel to Hollywood to accept the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for West Side Story. A Filpino designed her dress for the awards ceremony, which Edith Head voted the most original of the night. The designer returned to the Philippines the next day. Moreno's planned nude bathing scene in the film attracted a great deal of publicity. She eventually filmed the scene wearing a dress. In popular culture Cry of Battle was the first of two features (along with War Is Hell) playing at the Texas Theatre in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. After fatally shooting US President John F. Kennedy and Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit earlier that afternoon, Lee Harvey Oswald sneaked into the theater without paying. After box office cashier Julia Postal was informed by shoe store employee John Brewer that a man had entered the theater, she called Dallas police. Despite attempting to shoot the arresting officer, Oswald was arrested. Oswald was fatally shot two days later by club owner Jack Ruby while being transferred to another jail.

It was launched in 1981 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; the Interamericano Institute de Ciencias Agricola (IICA), a branch of the Organization of American States; the International Development Bank; the governments of Mexico, Canada, the United States; and the government of Haiti to \\"eliminate the debilitating effects of ASF African Swine Fever in Haiti and to begin development of a productive swine industry\\". African swine fever is a highly infectious and deadly disease of pigs, which decimates swine populations because neither vaccinations nor treatment are available. When ASF first appeared in the Dominican Republic, the Haitian government ordered the extermination of all Haitian swine on the border within a radius of 15 kilometers. 100,000 pigs were slaughtered. The peasants received no compensation for the losses they suffered and the preventive measure failed to stop the disease from spreading. In late 1978 ASF spread to Haiti. Haiti's northern neighbors watched the spread with apprehension. Studies indicated that if African Swine Fever ever came to the United States it could wreak $150 million to $5 billion worth of damage. This fear led the American, Canadian, and Mexican governments, through IICA, to impose a Swine Fever eradication plan on the Haitian government. This plan, PEPPADEP, was simple: kill all the swine in Haiti and restock the swine population with foreign pigs-either from the United States, Canada, or Mexico. ASF is a highly contagious viral disease infecting domestic pigs, warthogs and bush pigs, as well as soft ticks. The virus causes a lethal haemorraghic disease in domestic pigs; some strains can cause death of animals within as little as a week after infection. The disease was first recorded in Kenya in 1921 and is found in most sub-Saharan African countries. It spread to southern Europe in 1957 and the Caribbean in the 1970s.Disease factsheet: African Swine Fever ASF made its way from Europe or Africa to the Dominican Republic, and spread to Haiti in the late 1970s. The eradication efforts were nearly complete when it was discovered that populations of feral swine existed throughout the rural countryside. The Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS) worked in concert with the USDA to identify and eliminate feral swine populations which harbored the ASF virus in Haiti. Numerous feral populations were identified and one particular population north of Gonaives tested positive for the virus. SCWDS enlisted the use of American and Haitian hog-hunting dogs to reduce the populations. Wildlife Biologist and seasoned hog hunter Mark W. Hall lead the effort for SCWDS with able Wildlife Technician Matthew Knox. Dozens of feral swine were eliminated in the areas of Jacmel, Gonaives, Petit tru de Nips, and Cap-Haitien.

Background Isadore Jachman was born in Berlin, Germany, on December 14, 1922, the first son of Leo and Lotte Jachman. The family moved to the United States when Isadore was two years old. He was raised in Baltimore, Maryland and attended high school at the Baltimore City College, graduating in 1939. Jachman, who was Jewish, had relatives who died in the Holocaust, including six aunts and uncles. He joined the Army in November 1942. Medal of Honor action Sergeant Jachman, Company B, 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment and his company were pinned down by enemy artillery, mortar, small arms fire and two hostile tanks that attacked the unit, inflicting heavy casualties. Sergeant Jachman left his place of cover, dashed across open ground, through a hail of fire and grabbed a bazooka from a fallen comrade. He then advanced on the tanks, which concentrated their fire on him. Firing his weapon, he damaged one and forced both of them to retire.

It falls into the N7 postcode district of London. Rebuilding Holloway in the 1950s and 1960s The older part of the estate along Andover Road was built in 1938. The newer buildings, which make up the majority of the estate, were built from 1973 to 1979. This area of Holloway was rebuilt after streets of old housing were knocked down in the 1960s. When the estate was built it was seen as a model housing estate, and provided over 1000 homes in an area of high deprivation. Three large uniquely designed triangular buildings rise into the sky on the estate, named Didbin, Noll and Docura Houses respectively, after local architects. Some of the blocks of dwellings were named after railway junctions: Andover, Barmouth, Chard, Methley, Rainford and Yeovil.'Streets with a story: The book of Islington', Eric A Willats (1986, rev. 2017), p.14. Retrieved 16 May 2017 Many similar estates being built at the same time. Nearby Elthorne Estate was designed quite similarly in the mid-1970s but unlike Andover's three big blocks didn't have any high rise development. Other nearby housing estates, Six Acres Estate, Harvist Estate, and Elthorne Estate were built when it was considered more viable to modernise rather than rebuild after the area suffered bomb damage some twenty five years earlier in World War II. \\"Beyond the hoodie\\" The estate was subject to a 2007 ITV documentary in which a local MP, Ann Widdecombe, spent a night in one of the flats to highlight the supposed problem of youths causing trouble. The youth of Andover Estate then got together with a London film maker, Michelle Golding , to produce a film rebutting the Ann Widdecombe programme. Young residents put across their side of the story to demonstrate that they are more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators. The film highlights the actual reduction in crime on the estate over the last couple of years and the problem of much of the crime being committed by non-residents. It also discusses the negative impact created by what is described as the sloppy journalism of the Ann Widdecombe film. Overview / Trivia The estate has various well known residents in former EastEnders TV actor Marc Bannerman, renowned close-up magician and artiste Fay Presto also lived there for over 25 years. One of the UK’s top rappers Skinnyman grew up on the nearby Six Acres Estate and also spent many of his younger years hanging around on Andover Estate. His highly acclaimed album Council Estate of Mind is believed to be about his upbringing in this area. One half of popular house / garage music duo Truesteppers, Andy Lysandrou grew up on Andover Estate as well. John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten) also grew up on the nearby Six Acres Estate. On the edge of the estate on Sonderburg Road by Seven Sisters Road is Harmsworth hospital, (named and built after Sir Harold Harmsworth) an animal hospital run by the RSPCA, which was the focal point of the television reality TV series Animal Hospital, and was presented by the now disgraced TV personality Rolf Harris. The informative and educational series ran for nine years on the BBC.

The EJO aims to contribute to a richer understanding of different journalism cultures, to facilitate collaboration between media researchers and practitioners in Europe and the United States, and to foster press freedom. History The European Journalism Observatory was established in 2004 at the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Lugano, Switzerland, by Stephan Russ-Mohl, then Professor of Journalism and Media Management at USI. Though one of the aims of the EJO was to encourage cooperation and the sharing of knowledge between media researchers and journalists in western Europe and their counterparts in the former Eastern bloc countries that joined the European Union in 2004, at first its publications were available only in English, German and Italian. A Polish website was launched in 2007, and in 2011/12 six more Eastern European languages were added. The EJO currently consists of a network of websites in 13 different languages (Albanian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Ukrainian). In addition, it has a partnership with the Arab Journalism Observatory, based in Tunisia, which runs websites in Arabic and French. From 2013 to 2020, the English-language site was hosted by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ), a UK-based research centre and think tank. In September 2020, the Department of Journalism at City, University of London took over the hosting of the English-language site from the Reuters Institute. Over the years, the EJO has received financial assistance from a variety of sources, including the foundation of Corriere del Ticino, the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Stiftung Presse-Haus NRZ and the Robert Bosch Stiftung, in addition to being supported by the academic institutions that host the various language websites. Awards In 2005 the EJO won the Swiss Association for Quality in Journalism award for outstanding achievement and dedication to the promotion of high-quality journalism.Marc Höchli (2010) The Invisible Scissors: Media Freedom and Censorship in Switzerland; Berne, Peter Lang In 2019 the EJO received the Günter Wallraff Prize for the critical analysis of journalism.

The film was shot entirely in Spain. Plot With no better offers to be had, famous American Civil War upstart officer George Armstrong Custer takes over the Western Cavalry maintaining the peace in the Dakotas. He soon learns that the U.S. treaties are a sham, that Indian lands are being stolen and every excuse for driving them off their hunting grounds is being encouraged. With his wife Elizabeth (Mary Ure) Custer goes in and out of favor in Washington, while failing to keep wildcatting miners like his own deserting Sergeant Mulligan (Robert Ryan) from running off to prospect for gold in Indian country. After trying to humble the prideful Indian warrior Dull Knife (Kieron Moore), Custer leads the 7th Cavalry into defeat. Cast * Robert Shaw as General George Armstrong Custer * Mary Ure as Elizabeth Custer * Ty Hardin as Major Marcus Reno * Jeffrey Hunter as Captain Frederick Benteen * Lawrence Tierney as General Philip Sheridan * Marc Lawrence as the gold miner * Kieron Moore as Chief Dull Knife * Charles Stalmaker as Lt. Howells * Robert Hall as Sgt. Buckley * Robert Ryan as Sgt. Mulligan Production In the mid 1960s 20th Century Fox announced plans to make a film about Custer called The Day Custer Fell, directed by Fred Zinnemann, with Robert Shaw among the actors considered to play the title role. It was cancelled on grounds of cost. Producer Philip Yordan decided to make his own Custer movie and hired Bernard Gordon and Julian Zimet to write a script. According to Zimet, “The original brief was to turn out a typical Western sainted hero martyr script, which Gordon and I duly delivered. But Robert Shaw figured he would make it over to suit himself. Which he did. He turned Custer into a sadist of Shakespearean depth.” According to Bernard Gordon, \\"Production stumbled along on Custer as Julian and I tried to give the Indians a fair shake. Robert Shaw was helpful. A bright man and a fine writer, he approved of our point of view of that the Indians were victims right to the end. He even wrote one speech for Custer… that made this point sharply.” Yordan said he needed a known star (Shaw) and director (Siodmak) to raise the funds to make the movie. Julian Zimet later elaborated: > Shaw took care of the battle scenes himself. Siodmak preferred directing > ballroom scenes, which he had done so often in his long career they required > no invention. What he didn’t anticipate, as he choreographed fifty couples, > was that the actor—whose intervention was designed to give coherence to the > scene—would go crazy, punch him in the chops, and walk off the set. I was > already working on another project, but Yordan insisted that I write some > lines for a minor actor, which would account for the miscreant’s absence. > This would allow the ballroom scene to continue, save having to locate the > crazy or drunk actor, and save having to reshoot. While Siodmak kept the > dancers in motion, I rehearsed the new actor in his role, and tailors > stitched together a bespoke uniform. Within minutes he burst upon the scene, > apologised on behalf of the government minister for his absence—due to a > crisis in Washington—and announced an impending honour for Custer. It was a > weak solution, but it saved a lot of money. That’s show business for you. The film was originally known as Custer's West. It was one of two big screen epics made by Security Pictures (a company of Louis Dolivet and Philip Yordan) in the Cinerama process, the other being Krakatoa, East of Java. Security borrowed $6 million from the First National Bank to make the films in collaboration with Pacific Theatres. Pacific and Security Pictures gave distribution rights to Cinerama. Cinerama bought out most of the rights of Pacific and Security Pictures then sold 50% of the movie to ABC Films. Most of the film was shot within 30 miles of Madrid except for the Battle of Little Big Horn which was filmed in Costa del Sol near Almira. A South Carolina theater showing the film in 1968. Reception The film met with a largely negative reaction from critics. At Rotten Tomatoes, the film received only a 25% \\"rotten\\" rating. It holds average rating of 4.1/10. Many were unimpressed by the attempt to shoehorn two different viewpoints into the same film – the mistreatment of the native Americans by American troops, and the portrayal of Custer as an American hero who was not to blame for the disaster. The general inaccuracies of the film were also questioned, particularly the portrayal of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. The film only returned theatrical rentals of $400,000 in the United States and Canada. Home media Custer of the West was released to VHS by Anchor Bay Entertainment on July 14, 1998 and on DVD by MGM Home Video on May 25, 2004, as a Region 1 widescreen DVD.

It derived from the theology faculty of Jagiellonian University established in 1397. The theology faculty was expelled from the university by Communist authorities in 1954. Remaining under the supervision of the Vatican, the faculty received the honorific title of \\"Pontifical\\" in 1974 and was established as an Academy of Theology by Pope John Paul II in 1981 before becoming the Pontifical University of John Paul II in 2009. History Foundation of the Faculty The Faculty of Theology at the Kraków Academy (now Jagiellonian University) was first established at the request of Queen Jadwiga and her husband Jagiełło. On 11 January 1397 Pope Boniface IX signed a bull patent allowing for the foundation of the Faculty. In the restoration act of 26 July 1400 the Faculty of Theology was listed as the most important faculty of the Academy. Professors of the Faculty were involved in the christianization of Lithuania. In 1817 Kraków Academy became Jagiellonian University in commemoration of Poland's Jagiellonian dynasty. Throughout the existence of the Kingdom of Poland and further, during the partitions, and after the return to independence in 1918, most rectors of the Kraków Academy were drawn from theologians, who would become its most prominent personalities. Thanks to their reputation and the greatest number of students, the Academy was one of the main centres of Polish theological learning. During World War II many professors of the Faculty were prisoners of the Nazi concentration camps. In spite of wartime repressions and deaths, underground education was carried out. In 1945 the teaching staff of the Faculty included professors from the Polish Eastern borderlands (i.e. Lvov). After the expulsion In 1954 the Faculty of Theology was removed from the university by an edict of the communist Cabinet. However, the Vatican issued a decree in 1959 stating that the Faculty of Theology \\"remains under the supervision of one ecclesiastic authority and in the future is to be formed according to the laws passed by the Apostolic see\\". In 1974 owing to the efforts of Cardinal Karol Wojtyła, the Archbishop of Kraków and future Pope John Paul II, the Faculty was bestowed the honourable title Pontifical. The Pontifical Academy of Theology was established by Pope John Paul II on 8 December 1981, when he issued a motu proprio document entitled \\"Beata Hedvigis\\" prescribing that the Pontifical Academy be derived from an age-old Faculty of Theology of the Jagiellonian University.Open Society Archives, Pope John Paul II In Poland In 1988 Włodzimierz Siedlik formed the Psalmodia Choir at the Liturgy Institute, and this was officially recognised as the choir of the Academy in 1996. On 19 June 2009 by virtue of the decision of Pope Benedict XVI the Academy became the Pontifical University of John Paul II. Today The Pontifical University of John Paul II carries on the traditions of the Faculty of Theology of the Jagiellonian University. It co-sponsors the international Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in science, and fosters scholarly works oriented toward bridging the gap between the natural sciences and the humanities.Center for Interdisciplinary Studies, Philosophy in Science People Michał Heller, recipient of the 2008 Templeton Prize, was a significant figure in the establishment of the Academy and continues to teach there today. Also associated with the Faculty in its early days were Karol Wojtyła (Pope John Paul II) and Józef Życiński.

This house was built after designs by Fidus between 1908 and 1910. Today it is a cultural heritage monument. Fidus was the pseudonym used by German illustrator, painter and publisher Hugo Reinhold Karl Johann Höppener (October 8, 1868 – February 23, 1948). He was a symbolist artist, whose work directly influenced the psychedelic style of graphic design of the late 1960s. Biography Born the son of a confectioner in Lübeck, Höppener demonstrated artistic talent at an early age. Around 1886 he met the \\"apostle of nature\\" and artist Karl Wilhelm Diefenbach (1851–1913), and joined Diefenbach's commune near Munich. On Diefenbach's behalf, he served a brief prison sentence for public nudity, earning him the name Fidus (\\"faithful\\"). Monument for the killed First World War Soldiers from Woltersdorf, Relief was made by Fidus. In 1892 he moved to Berlin, set up another commune, and worked as an illustrator on the magazine Sphinx. His work appeared frequently in Jugend and other illustrated magazines. He created many ornamental drawings, especially for book decoration, as well as ex-libris, posters and designs. He was one of the first artists to use advertising postcards to promote his work. He also contributed to the early homosexual magazine Der Eigene, published by Adolf Brand. Harry Oosterhuis, Homosexuality and Male Bonding in Pre-Nazi Germany He held mystical Theosophical beliefs, and became interested in German mythology. His early illustrations contained dream-like abstractions, while his later work was characterised by motifs such as peasants, warriors, and other naked human figures in natural settings. He often combined mysticism, eroticism, and symbolism, in Art Nouveau and Sezessionist styles. By 1900 he was one of the best known painters in Germany, and had come under the influence of writers such as Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, Heinrich and Julius Hart, and the anti-materialist garden city and Wandervogel movements. In 1912 he designed a famous poster for a congress on \\"biological hygiene\\" in Hamburg, showing a man in the process of breaking his bonds and rising up to the stars.Berlinische Gallerie Fidus' Grave at the Woltersdorf cemetery. After 1918, interest in Fidus’ work as an illustrator ebbed. Despite his enthusiasm for the ideology of the Nazi Party, of which he became a member in 1932, he did not receive the support of the Nazi regime. In 1937 his work was seized and the sale of his images was forbidden. By the time he died in 1948 in Woltersdorf his art had been almost forgotten. It was rediscovered in the 1960s, and directly influenced the psychedelic concert posters which began to be produced at that time, initially in and around San Francisco.

Kannada is the official language of the state of Karnataka in India whose capital city of Bangalore is known as the Silicon Valley of India. Kannada also entered the Wikipedia world when Kannada Wikipedia was started in September 2004. History In the mid-1980s, software development in Kannada was started mainly to meet the needs of desktop publishing in Kannada. In those days, the Kannada keyboard was non-existent and existing English keyboard was used to enter Kannada characters. Shabdaratna, Venus, Prakashak, and Sediyapu were some of the Kannada editing software that were developed in those days. They started the era where computers started to replace typewriters and typesettings for Kannada publications. These were joined by more advanced software like Srilipi and Akruti which were Windows compatible. Shabdaratna was released with an advanced version called Winkey and another editing software called Surabhi was also released. In the mid-1990s, Windows started to replace DOS as the operating system of choice as Kannada software began being developed for Windows. The biggest customer for these Kannada software was the Government of Karnataka. Each of this Kannada software was developed using a specific format and hence portability of data across applications proved to be difficult. A Kannada document written and saved using one application could not be opened in the other. Some other issues that needed attention was the standardisation of a keyboard for entering Kannada characters and also to see how Kannada can be used in other software apart from the then existing desktop publishing applications. A group of researchers got together and started to discuss about these problems and brought them to the notice of the Government. In order to address these issues, a conference known as Kannada and computers was convened by the Government. The people invited to this conference included members of the Adivesha Co-operative Bank in Shimoga who had computerised all the bank's transactions in Kannada by using a software called as Gistcard which was developed by CDAC. Members of the bank made a presentation to the delegates on the advantages of using Kannada for its day-to-day computer transactions. The conference was influential in making the Government understand the usefulness and the need of standardising Kannada for computing. Meanwhile, a group of interested people formed an organisation called Ganaka Parishath who followed these developments and started to bring pressure on the Government to address the issues of standardisation. Growth A pioneer who standardised Kannada keyboard was K. P. Rao who modified the existing English QWERTY keyboard layout to suit the needs of the Kannada language.\\"Panini of Modern times: Prof. K. P. Rao\\" The entire set of Kannada characters could now be printed using the 26 alphabet keys on the English keyboard. After few modifications, this keyboard was announced as the standard Kannada keyboard by the Government. All Kannada software vendors were requested to adhere to this keyboard. Initially, it was suggested to use the IISCI language code devised by CDAC to enable portability of Kannada across different software. This code however was unsuitable for transliteration and it was difficult to navigate across different languages using it. This was because the code could not address issues like change in grammar across languages. In March 2000, a technical committee was set up by the Government of Karnataka to look into this problem. Ganaka Parishath came up with a glyph code called \\"Kannada Script Code for Language Processing\\" (KSCLP) in 2001. This glyph code enabled easy movement of data across different software and its development is considered as a milestone in the history of Kannada software. The technical committee suggested that all software developers should adhere to this code. In October 2000, the Government having solved the problems of standardisation, decided to have a benchmark software that will be the standard for usage of Kannada in computing. A software called Nudi was developed by Ganaka Parishath using a common code and also providing the ability to enter Kannada characters in different fonts. This was selected as the benchmark and all private software vendors were advised to adhered to the standards set by Nudi. There were some minor database-related issues which were solved by using a new improved code that was released by CDAC. Nudi was later converted into an advanced software by the Parishath and in 2002, the Government accepted it as an official software. Due to economic reasons, private software vendors put pressure on the Government to revoke the decision of standardisation. This was because if all Kannada software vendors produced the same standardised software, allowing their customers to have a choice to choose among the software vendors and hence an impact on existing business. As a final nail to the coffin, Ganaka Parishath decided to offer Nudi for free and this almost brought the Kannada software development industry to a halt. Baraha was another software that was released by engineer Sheshadrivasu Chandrashekhar which became popular due to its free cost and the ease with which a user could edit Kannada characters. The emergence of Unicode and standardisation of Unicode characters for Kannada ensured that Kannada can now be used across any application that supports Unicode. English to Kannada transliteration, as promoted by Google, is a yet another development in the advent of Kannada in computing. Kuvempu Kannada Thantramsha Kuvempu Kannada Thantramsha was another Kannada software released by Kannada University, Hampi in the memory of Kuvempu. This is a source-on-demand software. This has 4 keyboard layouts and 4 text-to-text converters, in compliance with older version of Anu fonts, SRG, Sree lipi. This is built is accordance with GOK standards. Some of the other important software developed in Kannada are: Latest version of Kuvempu Kannada Thantramsha 2.0 was released on 2-Feb-2010. Also Unicode version 1.0 is released.

Wikipedia in the Kannada language was started in June 2003.

Bugyi is a village of 5,149 residents on 11,558 hectares (28,560 acres; 45 sq mi) and about 30 km (south from Budapest. It is located at the intersection of roads connecting Ócsa to Kiskunlacháza and Taksony to Dabas and Kunpeszér, but it is not directly linked into major, state highways. Etymology The name of the town first appeared in official documents as Latin “Bevd” in 1321AD of a form Budymatheusfelde (translation: Matthew Bugy land). It is named from the personal names starting with \\"Bud\\" (from the verb \\"to be\\") of the original Czech/Slavic settlers. Examples include: Budweis (to be wise), Budik (awaken), Budimir (peaceful). The -i suffix in Hungarian \\"Bugy-i\\" denotes \\"of Bud\\". The place name has no etymological connection to the contemporary Hungarian common name \\"bugyi\\", meaning women's panties. History The township was fused from several medieval villages (Bugy, Vány, Ráda, Ürbo). The region's natural and economic development was defined by the Danube's ancient river bank, which was drained in the 1920s. As a result of its various soil types and micro climate, the region is especially well suited for agricultural production; hence, its important role in providing the capital with fresh produce. The town neighbors an area of gravel mines, so its geography is spackled with mining lakes. One of Bugyi's significant treasures is its rich flora and fauna. The area's rich bird and game life attracts hunters and nature lovers from home and abroad. The township's southwestern fields ease into the Kiskunság National Park, which is known as one of Central-Europe's birding paradises with its saline lakes and wetlands. Some of its rare treasures are the Great Bustard or the 9.4-hectare protected ancient marshland's most beautiful flower Iris pumila. Bugyi's historical landmarks are concentrated around its triangular Baroque main square. St. Adalbert Roman Catholic church, for example, was built in 1761AD by Count Károly, I. Eszterházy, Bishop of Vác. The Beleznay Castle hosted important Hungarian cultural figures in the distant past. Next to the Lutheran church, which was built in 1783AD, there is the so-called “shame stone,” a monument probably from the time of the Avars. We can still find the marble head stones in the Jewish cemetery. At present, one of the town's most festive events is the harvest pageant every October.

Started in Liverpool in 1925 to make Hoosier cabinets, it was bought by new investors in 1938, who after the war built modular kitchens for the new British post-war temporary prefab houses. With the introduction of design concepts based on the Frankfurt kitchen and new materials such as formica, Hygena became the dominant brand in kitchens from the 1960s through the 1970s. But mass manufacture and a change in styles meant that it ended up as an economy brand in the UK, bought out in the 1987 by the MFI Group. MFI sold the mainland European rights to the brand to Nobia in 2006, who on MFI's bankruptcy two years later also bought the global brand rights. However, the UK and Irish rights were bought by the Home Retail Group in 2009. Nobia sold the international rights to the brand to Groupe Fournier in 2015, who replaced it with its own SoCoo'c brand over the next 18 months. In 2016, the Home Retail Group was purchased by the UK retailer Sainsbury's, including the UK and Irish rights and the sole use of the Hygena brand. History Early years The Hygena Cabinet Co. Ltd was established in 1925 in Liverpool by George Nunn and Len Cooklin, to make a variety of the then popular Hoosier cabinets. As the Hoosier dwindled in popularity, so did the company's sales, resulting in the company's going bankrupt in 1938. Bought up by new investors, it made produce for the Ministry of War during World War II. Returning to civilian production, it became involved with the design and manufacture of kitchens for post-war temporary prefab houses. The Ministry of Works had specified a set of design conformance instructions, while the majority of manufacturers were using former war-time scale facilities, which resulted in a preference for factory-based mass manufacture. In 1943, the London-based Selection Engineering Company Ltd had appointed Hungarian emigre George Fejer as an industrial designer, who on a part-time basis helped out with their modular kitchen design. After completing construction of over 29,000 Uni-Seco prefab houses, by 1950 Fejer was looking for a new opportunity. 1950s Approached by Arthur Webb and George Nunn, Fejer was key in the creation the UK style of fitted kitchen, based on the principles of the Frankfurt kitchen. The design team realised that the post-War austerity period was over, and the 1950s kitchen needed to be bright, colourful and modern, influenced from contemporary American ideals of domesticity and good living. Pre-war English Rose kitchens had been the living ideal, but with wood in short supply, Aluminium became the material of choice. This promoted a clean fresh image, which helped to also announce a new beginning post-War. Worksurfaces were most often created in Formica, which available in a series of colours all with wipe-clean surfaces, reduced the amount of labour needed to prepare food. 1950s kitchens also often incorporated rounded shelves at the end of the units providing extra storage and a useful location for the bakelite radio. With much British manufacturing production still managed through standards defined by the MoW in the form of the newly launched British Standard, the first new Hygena kitchen range of the 1950s was the BU, available in cream or cream and green. But the mid-1950s F range was the company's first fully prefabricated kitchen, combining wall units with sliding doors, built-in sinks and larders with clear plastic storage bins. But the key to the F range was the accessibility of its style at a cheap price, with the most popular of the huge colour range choice being red tops, blue doors and white draws. In 1958 the company was joined by Alan Marshall, MSIA, as Chief Designer and Kitchen Planner. (Marshall's brother was Eric Marshall, FSIA, founder of Eric Marshall Associates.) Marshall had worked with George Fejer at Fejer's design Studio at Murray Road, Wimbledon, S.W.19 in the earlier 1950s. At Fejer's suggestion, Arthur Webb and George Nunn invited Marshall to move to Liverpool to join them at their Kirkby factory, and henceforward he was largely responsible for their design and planning work. At this time fitted kitchens were still beyond many people's price range, and builders still did not incorporate one into their new build houses. In 1959, Hygena was acquired by Norcros.Grace's Guide to British Industrial History. Norcros. Available online at . Accessed 16 August 2019. 1960s However, the 1960s changed that, with Hygena and Allied Iron Foundries in their Leisure Lineline range introducing the wider use of Formica. Until this point, kitchens were either made of metal, and hence polished, or wood and hence needed to be painted. The introduction of formica meant that no longer was there a need to paint or repaint your \\"new\\" kitchen, just use it. Secondly, formica was easy clean, and although most new houses incorporated a serving hatch between kitchen and dining room, more and more families were adopting to the American kitchen diner concept. In 1967 Norcros reorganised the board of Hygena with the appointments of Donald Standen, (MD), John Kennedy (Marketing Director), Derek Davies (Production Director) and George Robinson (Technical Director). These changes were made to improve production and increase sales and profitability. The company's main business was with Builders Merchants and Departmental Stores, none of whom kept items in stock. John Kennedy requested George Robinson to produce a limited range of melamine faced units at a specific price level in order to provide a USP for Hygena in the market place, and to facilitate retail stock holding. The company's TV advertising used a little girl to demonstrate simplicity of assembly, and the ease of units being carried away by customers. As a result of the introduction of QA (Quick Assembly) a range of seven units in four colours, turnover and profit increased immediately, In 1971 the same team developed and launched a range of self-assembly Fitted Bedroom Furniture under the name White Space. In 1972 it was decided to launch a range of integrated kitchen units and appliances made by Bauknecht. By 1973 Hygena had reached a 25% share of the Fitted Kitchen market, and in that financial year contributed over one third of Norcros net profit. In January 1974 John Kennedy left to take up an appointment in the USA. Bought by the MFI Group By the mid 1970s, Hygena had established itself as the leader in the fitted kitchen market, making itself vulnerable to attack from others, and changes in style. While the clean lines of its 1950s designs were popular post-War, the late 1970s saw the return of the bespoke country kitchen styles to the kitchen, which were unsuited to Hygena's design style and manufacture methods. In an attempt to survive, Standen considered diversifying: Marshall produced modular designs for kitchens, bedroom furniture and garden sheds, but his designs were regarded as too 'futuristic', and Norcros looked to dissolve the company and sell the Hygena name. This was purchased jointly in 1982 by MFI Group and Malcolm Healey's company; Humber Kitchens.The Independent (1999). Corporate Profile: MFI - Step one: pick up the pieces. The Independent, 22 December 1999. MFI took full control of Hygena in 1987, buying Healey out for £200 million, it sat alongside MFI other well known household brands as the economy choice. Home Retail Group acquisition After MFI went into administration in 2008, the Hygena UK and Irish brand rights together with the Schreiber Kitchens brand were bought by the Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos and Homebase, in 2009 and relaunched through those chains. Purchase by Sainsbury's In April 2016, Home Retail Group agreed to a £1.4bn takeover by UK retailer Sainsbury's, including the UK and Irish rights and the sole use of the Hygena brand. The acquisition completed on 2 September 2016. Operations Current operations The Hygena brand is now owned by Sainsbury's and its products are now sold in the United Kingdom through Argos stores and the Argos website. Former operations Hygena at Currys A typical Hygena at Currys concession during the closing phase In 2000, MFI announced a concession with DSG International plc, allowing the development of the sub-brand Hygena at Currys within DSG's Currys electrical retail stores. The furniture products sold were identical to those of MFI, however rebranded to distinguish the two companies, and usually sold at a vastly discounted price to offset competition from Howden Joinery and MFI itself. Currys benefited and made profit from appliance sales associated with the sale of a kitchen, and increased product knowledge from specialist staff. There were 130+ concessions found in Currys stores throughout the UK. But the concession suffered from particularly poor publicity, with marketing funds used entirely for MFI's own advertising and the refusal of DSG to include the brand in their own Currys campaigns. Therefore, Hygena at Currys relied almost entirely on word of mouth marketing. On 10 May 2005 it was decided by mutual agreement to end the partnership, with the final stores closing in October 2005. Every Currys store that had previously contained 'Hygena at Currys' showroom underwent a substantial refit as part of the Kestrel Refit Programme, at the cost of MFI (rumoured in excess of £5m), to restore the floorspace to its previous state. Hygena at Homebase Following the 2016 sale of Homebase to Wesfarmers, all Hygena branding will be removed from both the Homebase stores and the Homebase website in mid 2017 when the agreement with Home Retail Group Expires. International operations In 2006, MFI sold the successful Hygena operations in France and the rest of Europe to Swedish kitchen retailer Nobia for SEK 1,255 million (EUR 135 million). The sale included the 138 wholly owned stores in its French network, the Lille headquarters of MFI's mainland European operations, and use of the Hygena brand within Europe excluding the UK. Nobia sold the international rights to the brand to Groupe Fournier in 2015 for €20 million, who replaced it with its own SoCoo'c brand over the next 18 months. This gave Sainsbury's the sole use of the Hygena brand name.

Reynolds Tobacco Company. History Vantage was introduced nationwide in November of 1970 in the United States.Vantage is notable for its innovative filter design. Rather than featuring a solid filter like most cigarette brands, Vantage's filter features a conical hole in its center. While seemingly as mysterious as Parliament's recessed filter, Vantage advertising from 1977 states that the reasoning behind the design is to give \\"smokers the flavor of a full-flavor cigarette without anywhere near the 'tar' or nicotine\\". It received its biggest advertising push in the 1970s and '80s but is now categorized as a 'non-support' brand; though R.J. Reynolds will not provide marketing support for Vantage, the company will maintain the brand's distribution where there is consumer demand. In September 2015, the Food and Drug Administration forbade the selling of 4 brands: Camel Bold Crush, Vantage Tech 13 and the regular and menthol versions of Pall Mall Deep Set Recessed Filter cigarettes because R.J. Reynolds had failed to prove that the cigarettes were no more dangerous than brands that have been on the market longer. Advertising R.J. Reynolds has made various poster and magazine ads to promote Vantage in the 1970s and 1980s.[ZU&hl;=nl&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjo- a_lo4DaAhWKUlAKHdFgBgs4ChDoAQhiMAk#v=onepage&q;=vantage%20cigarettes&f;=false] A prominent slogan used at the time was \\"The new cigarette that doesn't cop out on flavor\\". A few TV adverts were also made to promote the brand during the early 1970s. Sponsorship Contests Vantage was the main sponsor of the \\"Women of Originality\\" contest held in Canada in 1998 and 1999. Women such as the singer-songwriter Jann Arden, fashion entertainer Jeanne Beker, figure skating choreographer Sandra Bezic and comedian Mary Walsh participated and won a \\"Vantage Women of Originality Award\\" on the 7th of May, 1998. A second round was scheduled for June 1999. In popular culture Films In the film Junebug, it is the brand smoked by Peg Johnsten, the mother-in-law of Amy Adams' character, Ashley. Similarly, the final punch line of the film Reversal of Fortune comes as Jeremy Irons's Klaus von Bulow purchases \\"two packs Vantage\\" at a drug store. Novels Vantage is featured as the heroine's cigarette of choice in Lorrie Moore's short story \\"Willing\\" in her collection Birds of America and is seen being stubbed out by a minor character in Donna Tartt's bestselling The Secret History. In chapter 103 of Forever by Pete Hamill, Cormac O'Connor purchases a pack of Vantage, ending nine days of not smoking. According to the 1984 biography \\"Wired\\" by Bob Woodward, John Belushi was a smoker of Vantage cigarettes. The \\"Vantage 100\\" cigarette is often smoked by the character of Heidi Halleck in the Stephen King novel, \\"Thinner\\". Celebrities Frank Gorshin smoked up to three packs per day in 2001; he was given 130 packs as a gift by the Don and Mike Show. Bette Davis, who was well known for her smoking habit, changed her preferred cigarette from Lucky Strike to Vantage in the later years of her life.

During the Song Dynasty, the manufacture of glazed tiles was standardized in Li Jie's Architecture Standard. In the Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty, glazed tiles became ever more popular for top-tier buildings, including palace halls in the Forbidden City, and ceremonial temples (for example the Heavenly Temple). There are two main types of Chinese glazed tiles: glazed tubular tile and glazed plate tile. Glazed tubular tiles are moulded into tube shape on a wooden mould, then cut into halves along their length, producing two tubular tiles, each semicircular in section. A tube- shaped clay mould can be cut into four equal parts, with a cross section of a quarter of a circle, then glazed into a four plate tile. Glazed plate tiles are laid side by side across and overlapping each other. In the Song Dynasty, the standard overlap was forty percent, which increased to seventy percent in the Qing dynasty. With the Song-style forty-percent overlap, it was not possible to have triple tile overlap, as there was a twenty-percent gap between the first plate tile and the third plate tile. Hence, if a crack developed in the second tile, water leakage was inevitable. On the other hand, with the Qing dynasty style seventy-percent overlapping, the first plate tile was overlapped seventy percent, forty percent, and ten percent by the second, third and fourth tiles, respectively; thus even if the second and the third tiles developed cracks, there would be no leakage. Glazed tubular tiles used at the eave edge have an outer end made into a round shape top, often moulded with the pattern of dragon. Eave-edge plate tiles have their outer edges decorated with triangles, to facilitate rain-shedding.

Then :\\\\frac{f_{i-1}}{f_i} = 1 + k_i z \\\\frac{f_{i+1}}, \\\\text{ and so } \\\\frac{f_i}{f_{i-1}} = \\\\frac{1}{1 + k_i z \\\\frac{f_{i+1}}} Setting g_i = f_i / f_{i-1}, :g_i = \\\\frac{1}{1 + k_i z g_{i+1}}, So :g_1 = \\\\frac{f_1}{f_0} = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + k_1 z g_2} = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + \\\\cfrac{k_1 z}{1 + k_2 z g_3}} = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + \\\\cfrac{k_1 z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{k_2 z}{1 + k_3 z g_4}}} = \\\\cdots.\\\\ Repeating this ad infinitum produces the continued fraction expression :\\\\frac{f_1}{f_0} = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + \\\\cfrac{k_1 z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{k_2 z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{k_3 z}{1 + {}\\\\ddots}}}} In Gauss's continued fraction, the functions f_i are hypergeometric functions of the form {}_0F_1, {}_1F_1, and {}_2F_1, and the equations f_{i-1} - f_i = k_i z f_{i+1} arise as identities between functions where the parameters differ by integer amounts. These identities can be proven in several ways, for example by expanding out the series and comparing coefficients, or by taking the derivative in several ways and eliminating it from the equations generated. The series 0F1 The simplest case involves :\\\\,_0F_1(a;z) = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{a\\\\,1!}z + \\\\frac{1}{a(a+1)\\\\,2!}z^2 + \\\\frac{1}{a(a+1)(a+2)\\\\,3!}z^3 + \\\\cdots. Starting with the identity :\\\\,_0F_1(a-1;z)-\\\\,_0F_1(a;z) = \\\\frac{z}{a(a-1)}\\\\,_0F_1(a+1;z), we may take :f_i = {}_0F_1(a+i;z),\\\\,k_i = \\\\tfrac{1}{(a+i)(a+i-1)}, giving :\\\\frac{\\\\,_0F_1(a+1;z)}{\\\\,_0F_1(a;z)} = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{1}{a(a+1)}z} {1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{1}{(a+1)(a+2)}z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{1}{(a+2)(a+3)}z}{1 + {}\\\\ddots}}}} or :\\\\frac{\\\\,_0F_1(a+1;z)}{a\\\\,_0F_1(a;z)} = \\\\cfrac{1}{a + \\\\cfrac{z} {(a+1) + \\\\cfrac{z}{(a+2) + \\\\cfrac{z}{(a+3) + {}\\\\ddots}}}}. This expansion converges to the meromorphic function defined by the ratio of the two convergent series (provided, of course, that a is neither zero nor a negative integer). The series 1F1 The next case involves :{}_1F_1(a;b;z) = 1 + \\\\frac{a}{b\\\\,1!}z + \\\\frac{a(a+1)}{b(b+1)\\\\,2!}z^2 + \\\\frac{a(a+1)(a+2)}{b(b+1)(b+2)\\\\,3!}z^3 + \\\\cdots for which the two identities :\\\\,_1F_1(a;b-1;z)-\\\\,_1F_1(a+1;b;z) = \\\\frac{(a-b+1)z}{b(b-1)}\\\\,_1F_1(a+1;b+1;z) :\\\\,_1F_1(a;b-1;z)-\\\\,_1F_1(a;b;z) = \\\\frac{az}{b(b-1)}\\\\,_1F_1(a+1;b+1;z) are used alternately. Let :f_0(z) = \\\\,_1F_1(a;b;z), :f_1(z) = \\\\,_1F_1(a+1;b+1;z), :f_2(z) = \\\\,_1F_1(a+1;b+2;z), :f_3(z) = \\\\,_1F_1(a+2;b+3;z), :f_4(z) = \\\\,_1F_1(a+2;b+4;z), etc. This gives f_{i-1} - f_i = k_i z f_{i+1} where k_1=\\\\tfrac{a-b}{b(b+1)}, k_2=\\\\tfrac{a+1}{(b+1)(b+2)}, k_3=\\\\tfrac{a-b-1}{(b+2)(b+3)}, k_4=\\\\tfrac{a+2}{(b+3)(b+4)}, producing :\\\\frac{{}_1F_1(a+1;b+1;z)}{{}_1F_1(a;b;z)} = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{a-b}{b(b+1)} z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{a+1}{(b+1)(b+2)} z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{a-b-1}{(b+2)(b+3)} z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{a+2}{(b+3)(b+4)} z}{1 + {}\\\\ddots}}}}} or :\\\\frac{{}_1F_1(a+1;b+1;z)}{b{}_1F_1(a;b;z)} = \\\\cfrac{1}{b + \\\\cfrac{(a-b) z}{(b+1) + \\\\cfrac{(a+1) z}{(b+2) + \\\\cfrac{(a-b-1) z}{(b+3) + \\\\cfrac{(a+2) z}{(b+4) + {}\\\\ddots}}}}} Similarly :\\\\frac{{}_1F_1(a;b+1;z)}{{}_1F_1(a;b;z)} = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{a}{b(b+1)} z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{a-b-1}{(b+1)(b+2)} z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{a+1}{(b+2)(b+3)} z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{a-b-2}{(b+3)(b+4)} z}{1 + {}\\\\ddots}}}}} or :\\\\frac{{}_1F_1(a;b+1;z)}{b{}_1F_1(a;b;z)} = \\\\cfrac{1}{b + \\\\cfrac{a z}{(b+1) + \\\\cfrac{(a-b-1) z}{(b+2) + \\\\cfrac{(a+1) z}{(b+3) + \\\\cfrac{(a-b-2) z}{(b+4) + {}\\\\ddots}}}}} Since {}_1F_1(0;b;z)=1, setting a to 0 and replacing b + 1 with b in the first continued fraction gives a simplified special case: :{}_1F_1(1;b;z) = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + \\\\cfrac{-z}{b + \\\\cfrac{z}{(b+1) + \\\\cfrac{-b z}{(b+2) + \\\\cfrac{2z}{(b+3) + \\\\cfrac{-(b+1)z}{(b+4) + {}\\\\ddots}}}}}} The series 2F1 The final case involves :{}_2F_1(a,b;c;z) = 1 + \\\\frac{ab}{c\\\\,1!}z + \\\\frac{a(a+1)b(b+1)}{c(c+1)\\\\,2!}z^2 + \\\\frac{a(a+1)(a+2)b(b+1)(b+2)}{c(c+1)(c+2)\\\\,3!}z^3 + \\\\cdots.\\\\, Again, two identities are used alternately. :\\\\,_2F_1(a,b;c-1;z)-\\\\,_2F_1(a+1,b;c;z) = \\\\frac{(a-c+1)bz}{c(c-1)}\\\\,_2F_1(a+1,b+1;c+1;z), :\\\\,_2F_1(a,b;c-1;z)-\\\\,_2F_1(a,b+1;c;z) = \\\\frac{(b-c+1)az}{c(c-1)}\\\\,_2F_1(a+1,b+1;c+1;z). These are essentially the same identity with a and b interchanged. Let :f_0(z) = \\\\,_2F_1(a,b;c;z), :f_1(z) = \\\\,_2F_1(a+1,b;c+1;z), :f_2(z) = \\\\,_2F_1(a+1,b+1;c+2;z), :f_3(z) = \\\\,_2F_1(a+2,b+1;c+3;z), :f_4(z) = \\\\,_2F_1(a+2,b+2;c+4;z), etc. This gives f_{i-1} - f_i = k_i z f_{i+1} where k_1=\\\\tfrac{(a-c)b}{c(c+1)}, k_2=\\\\tfrac{(b-c-1)(a+1)}{(c+1)(c+2)}, k_3=\\\\tfrac{(a-c-1)(b+1)}{(c+2)(c+3)}, k_4=\\\\tfrac{(b-c-2)(a+2)}{(c+3)(c+4)}, producing :\\\\frac{{}_2F_1(a+1,b;c+1;z)}{{}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)} = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{(a-c)b}{c(c+1)} z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{(b-c-1)(a+1)}{(c+1)(c+2)} z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{(a-c-1)(b+1)}{(c+2)(c+3)} z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{(b-c-2)(a+2)}{(c+3)(c+4)} z}{1 + {}\\\\ddots}}}}} or :\\\\frac{{}_2F_1(a+1,b;c+1;z)}{c{}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)} = \\\\cfrac{1}{c + \\\\cfrac{(a-c)b z}{(c+1) + \\\\cfrac{(b-c-1)(a+1) z}{(c+2) + \\\\cfrac{(a-c-1)(b+1) z}{(c+3) + \\\\cfrac{(b-c-2)(a+2) z}{(c+4) + {}\\\\ddots}}}}} Since {}_2F_1(0,b;c;z)=1, setting a to 0 and replacing c + 1 with c gives a simplified special case of the continued fraction: :{}_2F_1(1,b;c;z) = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + \\\\cfrac{-b z}{c + \\\\cfrac{(b-c) z}{(c+1) + \\\\cfrac{-c(b+1) z}{(c+2) + \\\\cfrac{2(b-c-1) z}{(c+3) + \\\\cfrac{-(c+1)(b+2) z}{(c+4) + {}\\\\ddots}}}}}} Convergence properties In this section, the cases where one or more of the parameters is a negative integer are excluded, since in these cases either the hypergeometric series are undefined or that they are polynomials so the continued fraction terminates. Other trivial exceptions are excluded as well. In the cases {}_0F_1 and {}_1F_1, the series converge everywhere so the fraction on the left hand side is a meromorphic function. The continued fractions on the right hand side will converge uniformly on any closed and bounded set that contains no poles of this function.Jones & Thron (1980) p. 206 In the case {}_2F_1, the radius of convergence of the series is 1 and the fraction on the left hand side is a meromorphic function within this circle. The continued fractions on the right hand side will converge to the function everywhere inside this circle. Outside the circle, the continued fraction represents the analytic continuation of the function to the complex plane with the positive real axis, from to the point at infinity removed. In most cases is a branch point and the line from to positive infinity is a branch cut for this function. The continued fraction converges to a meromorphic function on this domain, and it converges uniformly on any closed and bounded subset of this domain that does not contain any poles.Wall, 1973 (p. 339) Applications The series 0F1 We have :\\\\cosh(z) = \\\\,_0F_1({\\\\tfrac{1}{2}};{\\\\tfrac{z^2}{4}}), :\\\\sinh(z) = z\\\\,_0F_1({\\\\tfrac{3}{2}};{\\\\tfrac{z^2}{4}}), so :\\\\tanh(z) = \\\\frac{z\\\\,_0F_1({\\\\tfrac{3}{2}};{\\\\tfrac{z^2}{4}})}{\\\\,_0F_1({\\\\tfrac{1}{2}};{\\\\tfrac{z^2}{4}})} = \\\\cfrac{z/2}{\\\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\\\cfrac{\\\\tfrac{z^2}{4}}{\\\\tfrac{3}{2} + \\\\cfrac{\\\\tfrac{z^2}{4}}{\\\\tfrac{5}{2} + \\\\cfrac{\\\\tfrac{z^2}{4}}{\\\\tfrac{7}{2} + {}\\\\ddots}}}} = \\\\cfrac{z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{z^2}{3 + \\\\cfrac{z^2}{5 + \\\\cfrac{z^2}{7 + {}\\\\ddots}}}}. This particular expansion is known as Lambert's continued fraction and dates back to 1768.Wall (1973) p. 349. It easily follows that :\\\\tan(z) = \\\\cfrac{z}{1 - \\\\cfrac{z^2}{3 - \\\\cfrac{z^2}{5 - \\\\cfrac{z^2}{7 - {}\\\\ddots}}}}. The expansion of tanh can be used to prove that en is irrational for every integer n (which is alas not enough to prove that e is transcendental). The expansion of tan was used by both Lambert and Legendre to prove that π is irrational. The Bessel function J_ u can be written :J_ u(z) = \\\\frac{(\\\\tfrac{1}{2}z)^ u}{\\\\Gamma( u+1)}\\\\,_0F_1( u+1;-\\\\frac{z^2}{4}), from which it follows :\\\\frac{J_ u(z)}{J_{ u-1}(z)}=\\\\cfrac{z}{2 u - \\\\cfrac{z^2}{2( u+1) - \\\\cfrac{z^2}{2( u+2) - \\\\cfrac{z^2}{2( u+3) - {}\\\\ddots}}}}. These formulas are also valid for every complex z. The series 1F1 Since e^z = {}_1F_1(1;1;z), 1/e^z = e^{-z} :e^z = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + \\\\cfrac{-z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{z}{2 + \\\\cfrac{-z}{3 + \\\\cfrac{2z}{4 + \\\\cfrac{-2z}{5 + {}\\\\ddots}}}}}} :e^z = 1 + \\\\cfrac{z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{-z}{2 + \\\\cfrac{z}{3 + \\\\cfrac{-2z}{4 + \\\\cfrac{2z}{5 + {}\\\\ddots}}}}}. With some manipulation, this can be used to prove the simple continued fraction representation of e, :e=2+\\\\cfrac{1}{1+\\\\cfrac{1}{2+\\\\cfrac{1}{1+\\\\cfrac{1}{1+\\\\cfrac{1}{4+{}\\\\ddots}}}}} The error function erf (z), given by : \\\\operatorname{erf}(z) = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}\\\\int_0^z e^{-t^2} \\\\, dt, can also be computed in terms of Kummer's hypergeometric function: : \\\\operatorname{erf}(z) = \\\\frac{2z}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} e^{-z^2} \\\\,_1F_1(1;{\\\\scriptstyle\\\\frac{3}{2}};z^2). By applying the continued fraction of Gauss, a useful expansion valid for every complex number z can be obtained:Jones & Thron (1980) p. 208. : \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}}{2} e^{z^2} \\\\operatorname{erf}(z) = \\\\cfrac{z}{1 - \\\\cfrac{z^2}{\\\\frac{3}{2} + \\\\cfrac{z^2}{\\\\frac{5}{2} - \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{3}{2}z^2}{\\\\frac{7}{2} + \\\\cfrac{2z^2}{\\\\frac{9}{2} - \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{5}{2}z^2}{\\\\frac{11}{2} + \\\\cfrac{3z^2}{\\\\frac{13}{2} - \\\\cfrac{\\\\frac{7}{2}z^2}{\\\\frac{15}{2} + - \\\\ddots}}}}}}}}. A similar argument can be made to derive continued fraction expansions for the Fresnel integrals, for the Dawson function, and for the incomplete gamma function. A simpler version of the argument yields two useful continued fraction expansions of the exponential function.See the example in the article Padé table for the expansions of ez as continued fractions of Gauss. The series 2F1 From :(1-z)^{-b}={}_1F_0(b;;z)=\\\\,_2F_1(1,b;1;z), :(1-z)^{-b} = \\\\cfrac{1}{1 + \\\\cfrac{-b z}{1 + \\\\cfrac{(b-1) z}{2 + \\\\cfrac{-(b+1) z}{3 + \\\\cfrac{2(b-2) z}{4 + {}\\\\ddots}}}}} It is easily shown that the Taylor series expansion of arctan z in a neighborhood of zero is given by : \\\\arctan z = zF({\\\\scriptstyle\\\\frac{1}{2}},1;{\\\\scriptstyle\\\\frac{3}{2}};-z^2). The continued fraction of Gauss can be applied to this identity, yielding the expansion : \\\\arctan z = \\\\cfrac{z} {1+\\\\cfrac{(1z)^2} {3+\\\\cfrac{(2z)^2} {5+\\\\cfrac{(3z)^2} {7+\\\\cfrac{(4z)^2} {9+\\\\ddots}}}}}, which converges to the principal branch of the inverse tangent function on the cut complex plane, with the cut extending along the imaginary axis from i to the point at infinity, and from −i to the point at infinity.Wall (1973) p. 343. Notice that i and −i are branch points for the inverse tangent function. This particular continued fraction converges fairly quickly when z = 1, giving the value π/4 to seven decimal places by the ninth convergent. The corresponding series : \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} = \\\\cfrac{1} {1+\\\\cfrac{1^2} {2+\\\\cfrac{3^2} {2+\\\\cfrac{5^2} {2+\\\\ddots}}}} = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{3} + \\\\frac{1}{5} - \\\\frac{1}{7} \\\\pm \\\\cdots converges much more slowly, with more than a million terms needed to yield seven decimal places of accuracy.Jones & Thron (1980) p. 202. Variations of this argument can be used to produce continued fraction expansions for the natural logarithm, the arcsin function, and the generalized binomial series.

The bark is brown to grey or blackish, cracking into small plates on old plants. The leaves are opposite, 3–7 cm long and 1.5–4 cm broad with a thick, leathery texture, lustrous dark green above, paler yellow-green below; the margin is entire or with one to four large spine-tipped teeth on each side. Spiny leaves predominate on small, young plants (an adaptation to deter browsing animals), while entire leaves predominate higher on larger mature plants out of the reach of animals. The flowers are very fragrant, white, with a four-lobed corolla, the corolla tube 1–2 mm long and the lobes 2.5–5 mm long; they are dioecious, with flowering in the autumn. The fruit is an ovoid dark purple drupe 1.5 cm long and 1 cm diameter, mature in the following summer about 9 months after flowering.Hata Labs Plant Ecology Laboratory: Osmanthus heterophyllus (in Japanese; google translation)Rokko Mountain guide to trees: Osmanthus heterophyllus (in Japanese; google translation)Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . Osmanthus heterophyllus (flower s6).jpg|flowers Osmanthus heterophyllus fruits.jpg|fruits Osmanthus heterophyllus (leaf s3).jpg|leaf Varieties There are two varieties: *Osmanthus heterophyllus var. heterophyllus. Leaves entire or spiny; flowers with short corolla lobes 2.5-3.5 mm long. Throughout the range of the species. *Osmanthus heterophyllus var. bibracteatus (Hayata) P.S.Green. Leaves always entire; flowers with long corolla lobes 5 mm long. Endemic to Taiwan. Nomenclature The scientific name heterophyllus, \\"different leaves\\", refers to the variation in leaf shape between spiny and entire. The common name holly osmanthus refers to the similarity in leaf shape to that of the holly (Ilex aquifolium), an example of convergent evolution with a common objective of deterring browsing; the two may be distinguished easily by the leaf arrangement, alternate in Ilex aquifolium and opposite in Osmanthus heterophyllus. Cultivation ‘Goshiki’, Cranford, New Jersey It is widely used as a hedge plant. Several cultivars have been selected for garden use, including 'Aureus', 'Goshiki', 'Purpureus', 'Rotundifolius', and 'Subangustatus'. The cultivars 'Goshiki', 'Variegatus' and ‘Purple Shaft’ have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The species has been hybridised in cultivation with Osmanthus fragrans; the resulting hybrid is named Osmanthus × fortunei Carr. Historical mentions It is mentioned twice in the Kojiki, the oldest surviving historical record of Japan. The first mention, under the name hihiragi, is in connection with the name of a kami, Hihiragi-no-sono-hana- madzumi-no-kami (translated by Chamberlain as \\"Deity Waiting-to-see-the- Flowers-of-the-Holly\\"), with the word madzumi (rarely seen) being used to describe the plant's characteristic of its flowers rarely blossoming, as interpreted by the scholar Tominobu. Its second mention occurs during a passage referring to how a holly wood spear, made of material from the tree and spanning \\"eight fathoms long\\", was presented to the Prince Yamato-take by the Emperor prior to him being sent to subdue the East. Its prickly and non- prickly variations are sometimes described as \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" respectively, though this does not have a relation to the plant's gender.

It is a structured and infrastructure-rich Colombo suburb with a hospital (private), a police station, a bus depot, a post office, several schools, Buddhist temples and Catholic and Christian churches. Demographically, Kadawatha area is predominantly Sinhalese and partially Tamils with a majority of them being Buddhists but there is a sizable Catholic and Hindu minority. The residents show a high mobility towards the capital as many of them study or work in Colombo. Along with recent express way developments within the island Kadawatha has been selected as a major express way interchange which connects Dakshina, Airport and proposed Kandy expressway. Recently built Kadawatha city bypass ways has added great convenient to motorists. New Court complex now in operation closer to city bypass  History  In the pre-British era, Kadawatha was the entrance to the Kingdom of Mahanuwara (Kandy). There are several cities bearing the same name, places that were used for bullock carts to be halted.  Accessing Kadawatha  The Kandy-Colombo main road (A-1 road) runs through this suburb. Kadawatha is 16 km far from Colombo Fort. Kadawatha is well-connected to neighbouring the other suburbs of Colombo city, such as Ragama, Kiribathgoda and Biyagama. Due to unsystematic planning, Kadawatha used to be a headache to masses with massive traffic jams during peak hours. Recently, the proper planning of town-side and road infrastructure have drastically reduced this condition. Sri Lanka's first vehicle underpass is being built in Kadawatha, facilitating avoidance of the town-centre by the traffic towards Kandy. In addition, the town will be connecting a major loop of the proposed outer-Colombo circular road which expects to connect major suburbs.

He is best known for his groundbreaking discoveries that reveal the inner workings of an important family G protein-coupled receptors, for which he was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Chemistry with Brian Kobilka. He is currently an Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute as well as a James B. Duke Professor of Medicine and Professor of Biochemistry and Chemistry at Duke University. Early life Lefkowitz was born on April 15, 1943, in The Bronx, New York to Jewish parents Max and Rose Lefkowitz. Their families had emigrated to the United States from Poland in the late 19th century. After graduating from the Bronx High School of Science in 1959, he attended Columbia College from which he received a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry 1962. He graduated from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1966 with an M.D. Degree. After serving an internship and one year of general medical residency at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, he served as Clinical and Research Associate at the National Institutes of Health from 1968 to 1970. Career Upon completing his medical residency and research and clinical training in 1973, he was appointed Associate Professor of Medicine and Assistant Professor of Biochemistry at the Duke University Medical Center. In 1977 he was promoted to Professor of Medicine and in 1982 to James B. Duke Professor of Medicine at Duke University. He is also a Professor of Biochemistry and a Professor of Chemistry. He has been an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1976 and was an Established Investigator of the American Heart Association from 1973-1976. Lefkowitz studies receptor biology and signal transduction and is most well known for his detailed characterizations of the sequence, structure and function of the β-adrenergic and related receptors and for the discovery and characterization of the two families of proteins which regulate them, the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases and β-arrestins. Lefkowitz made a remarkable contribution in the mid-1980s when he and his colleagues cloned the gene first for the β-adrenergic receptor, and then rapidly thereafter, for a total of 8 adrenergic receptors (receptors for adrenaline and noradrenaline). This led to the seminal discovery that all GPCRs (which include the β-adrenergic receptor) have a very similar molecular structure. The structure is defined by an amino acid sequence which weaves its way back and forth across the plasma membrane seven times. Today we know that about 1,000 receptors in the human body belong to this same family. The importance of this is that all of these receptors use the same basic mechanisms so that pharmaceutical researchers now understand how to effectively target the largest receptor family in the human body. Today, as many as 30 to 50 percent of all prescription drugs are designed to \\"fit\\" like keys into the similarly structured locks of Lefkowitz' receptors—everything from anti-histamines to ulcer drugs to beta blockers that help relieve hypertension, angina and coronary disease. Lefkowitz is among the most highly cited researchers in the fields of biology, biochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and clinical medicine according to Thomson-ISI. Personal life Lefkowitz is married to Lynn (née Tilley). He has five children and six grandchildren. He was previously married to Arna Brandel. Awards Lefkowitz has received numerous awards including: * 2014 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement * 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (shared with Brian Kobilka) * 2009 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award, in the Biomedicine Category. * 2009 Research Achievement Award, American Heart Association * 2007 National Medal of Science \\\\- YouTube video of the ceremony * 2007 The Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine * 2007 Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research * 2003 Fondation Lefoulon – Delalande Grand Prix for Science – Institut de France * 2001 Jessie Stevenson Kovalenko Medal of the USA - The National Academy of Sciences * 1992 Bristol- Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement In Cardiovascular Research * 1988 Gairdner Foundation International Award * 1978 John Jacob Abel Award in Pharmacology References External links * - Web site of his lab. * - His biography. * Robert J.

The ship was reclassified as a submarine chaser, PC-1598 on 1 June 1944.  World War II Atlantic operations  USS Excel arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 21 January 1943 for minesweeping exercises in the Virginia Capes, then sailed to Portland, Maine, where she based for patrol and minesweeping duty from 15 March 1943 to 3 February 1944. She was reclassified PC-1598 on 1 June. Returning to Norfolk, she had local patrol, sweeping, and training duty until 9 June, when she sailed for San Diego, California, and Pearl Harbor, arriving on 1 August.  Service as a submarine chaser  After serving as escort on a voyage to Eniwetok, PC-1598 departed Pearl Harbor on 14 October 1944 to escort a convoy of LSTs by way of Eniwetok and Guam to Ulithi. Here a new convoy of landing craft was assembled, and with it PC-1598 arrived at Hollandia, New Guinea, on 16 November. For the next two months, she escorted convoys among the ports of New Guinea, aiding in the assembling of shipping for the Lingayen assault. She left Hollandia on 10 January 1945 on escort duty for San Pedro Bay, Leyte, and on 9 February, arrived at Ulithi, where she joined in exercises, and transported men from place to place in the vast fleet anchorage. In company with six other minecraft, PC-1598 sailed from Ulithi on 19 March 1945 to sweep mines off Okinawa, clearing the way for both pre- invasion bombardment and the assault landings of 1 April. She carried out her hazardous mission successfully, destroying many enemy mines, and sailed from the island on 5 April for a repair period at Guam. PC-1598 gave patrol and escort services in the Marianas, and on 3 July she rescued a downed aviator. After voyaging to Okinawa in the escort for a large convoy between 8 and 21 July, she returned to duty in the Marianas. On 5 August, she made rendezvous off Saipan with the submarine to take off one of the officers, who was severely ill. PC-1598 operated out of Saipan until 17 October 1945, when she sailed for San Francisco, California.

From the 1930s to the 1970s, the Maple Leaf was a halibut longliner on the Bering Sea, making it one of the longest-running ships to fish. Now a sail training vessel and ecotourism schooner, she has a rich history of operation on the coast. History In 1904, a Vancouver businessman named Alexander MacLaren wanted the fastest and best sailing yacht on the west coast. He hired Capt. William Watts, shipbuilder and founder of Vancouver Shipyard (now Vancouver Shipyards) to build it.  Construction  Originally built by Alexander MacLaren, Maple Leaf has many features that make it a very unusual ship. The ribs are made of coastal yellow cedar wood. The planking, decks, and beams were constructed of coastal Douglas fir wood, making the ship a true vessel of the coast. Made of mahogany, the bright work of the ship was a gift from the builder's relatives. It is all the more distinctive by being the first ship North of San Francisco to have electric light. It is also one of the first ships on the coast to have an external, lead keel.

The Museum became a Hawaii non-profit corporation on April 16, 2007. HAM was a member of the Western Museums Association and the Hawaii Museums Association. In 2007, the HAM Education Centers was opened to provide a program of studio art classes, workshops and special exhibits. Its main location closed in December 2007, and only a few classes in a donated space were held in 2008. Collections and holdings The Hilo Art Museum permanent collection included original works of art by Huc-Mazelet Luquiens, Pablo Picasso, Keith Haring, Jack Sudlow, Salvador Dalí, Stephen Freedman, Emily DuBois, Suzanne Dix, and many others. The Museum featured a permanent exhibit, \\"Art of the Holocaust and Genocide\\" which contains a rare signed lithograph by Picasso, works by Chagall and other significant artists. The Museum Teaching Collection also featured a unique teaching collection of hand painted life sized reproductions of the masters. This collection was necessary to teach the island children about art in museums around the world. Isolation in the middle of the Pacific Ocean has kept most of the island inhabitants and their families from viewing the world's master art. Hours and admissions The Hilo Art Museum exhibited a portion of their collection in the Keaau Fine Arts Center, 16-643 Kipimana Street, in the Shipman Industrial Park, Keaau, Hawaii. Hilo Art Museum Research Library The Hilo Art Museum maintained a library of books on art topics. History In April 2007, artist and island resident, Ted Coombs, began to realize his dream of a general art museum in Hilo, Hawaii, the State's second largest city. He contacted several others he knew shared his dream, and formed the HAM Board of Trustees. A search began for a location, and for art to fill the permanent collection. Before finding a permanent home, the trustees decided it would be best to open the facility in the historic Hilo Iron Works building. This facility closed as of December 2007, with a new, smaller facility donated in January 2008, in Keaau. The Hilo Iron Works building was home to the noted Art in the Iron Works gallery which maintained one of Hilo's premier art education resources. This program was generously donated to the Museum when the Museum took over the Art in the Iron Works facility in the Summer of 2007. Donations of art began arriving including an original Picasso drawing of the \\"Two Monkeys\\", original work by abstract expressionist, Willem de Kooning, social commentary artist, Suzanne Dix and Dale Chihuly. The initial funding for the museum came from the trustees, Ted Coombs and family, Stephen Davey, and through museum memberships. In January 2008, the Hilo Art Museum began a program of opening small exhibit centers throughout the Island of Hawaii. The only center so far is the Keaau Fine Art Center which features portions of the permanent collection and rotating exhibits. In February 2009, an exhibition featuring Italian artist Mirko was put on at the Hilo Palace Theater by the museum's Director, Stephen Davey. These works, painted canvas and ceramic pieces, featured images true to the Hawaiian heritage. In June 2009, the museum was closed for business. Closed The Hilo Art Museum Education Center was closed in December 2008. The Hilo Art Museum is no longer a member of the American Alliance of Museums, and never met the criteria for accreditation by the AAM.

The area consists of four council housing estates - Ballybeg, Priory Lawn, Clonard Park and Ardmore Park, and a private housing estate, Glencarra. As of 2007, the community was reported as being \\"approximately 750 houses\\". The community was originally created to provide low-income housing. Location and access Ballybeg is accessed via the N25 junction outside the (now defunct) 'Waterford Crystal' factory, the N25 junction past the 'Cartamundi' (formerly Hasbro) games factory, and the Ballybeg Link Road off the Kilbarry road. The area of Ballybeg is situated within the wider Kilbarry area. This area was reputedly home to a priory of the Knights Templar and later became the Irishtown of Waterford. Many cities and large towns in Ireland have an area called Baile Beag (Small town) Baile Bocht (Poor town) i.e. 'Ballybock' in Dublin, Ceathrú Rua (Red-haired area) or simply \\"Irish Town\\". Amenities Ballybeg (or Bailebeag) is served by a church (St. Saviour's), a primary school (St. Saviour's National School), two supermarkets, a takeaway, and a parish centre / sports hall.

Its remains are located in Abu Qir Bay, currently 2.5 km off the coast, under of water. A stele found on the site indicates that it was one single city known by both its Egyptian and Greek names. Its legendary beginnings go back to as early as the 12th century BC, and it is mentioned by ancient Greek historians. Its importance grew particularly during the waning days of the Pharaohs. Legendary beginnings Heracleion is mentioned by many chroniclers in antiquity, including Herodotus, Strabo and Diodorus. The city was said by Herodotus to have been visited by Paris and Helen of Troy before the Trojan war began. They sought refuge there on their flight from the jealous Menelaus, but were rebuffed by Thonis, the watchman at the entrance to the Nile. Alternatively it was believed that Menelaus and Helen had stayed there, accommodated by the noble Egyptian Thon and his wife Polydamna. The 2nd century BC Greek poet Nicander wrote that Menelaus’s helmsman, Canopus, was bitten by a viper on the sands of Thonis. According to Herodotus, a great temple was built at the spot where Heracles first arrived in Egypt. The story of Heracles' visit resulted in the Greeks calling the city by the Greek name Heracleion rather than its original Egyptian name Thonis. History Heracleion was originally built on some adjoining islands in the Nile Delta. It was intersected by canals with a number of harbors and anchorages. Its wharves, temples and tower-houses were linked by ferries, bridges, and pontoons. The city was an emporion (trading port) and in the Late Period of ancient Egypt it was the country's main port for international trade and collection of taxes. It had a sister city, Naucratis, which was another trading port lying 72 km (45 mi) further up the Nile. Goods were transferred inland via Naucratis, or they were transported via the Western Lake and through a water channel to the nearby town of Canopus for onward distribution. Heracleion had a large temple of Khonsou, son of Amun, who was known to the Greeks as Herakles.Anne Burton, Diodorus Siculus, Book 1: A Commentary. BRILL, 1972 p105 Later, the worship of Amun became more prominent. During the time when the city especially flourished between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, a large temple of Amun-Gereb, the supreme god of the Egyptians at the time, was located in the middle of the city. Pharaoh Nectanebo I made many additions to the temple in the 4th century B.C. Sanctuaries in Heracleion dedicated to Osiris and other gods were famous for miraculous healing and attracted pilgrims from a wide area. The city was the site of the celebration of the \\"Mysteries of Osiris\\" each year during the month of Khoiak. The god in his ceremonial boat was brought in procession from the temple of Amun in that city to his shrine in Canopus. During the 2nd century BC Alexandria superseded Heracleion as Egypt’s primary port. Over time the city was weakened by a combination of earthquakes, tsunamis and rising sea levels. At the end of the 2nd century BC, probably after a severe flood, the ground on which central island of Heracleion was built succumbed to soil liquefaction. The hard clay turned rapidly into a liquid and the buildings collapsed into the water. A few residents stayed on during the Roman era and the beginning of Arab rule, but by the end of the eighth century AD what was left of the city had sunk beneath the sea. Ancient references The stela of Ptolemy VIII from the temple of Heracleion The city was mentioned by the ancient historians Diodorus (1.19.4) and Strabo (17.1.16). Herodotus was told that Thonis was the warden of the Canopic mouth of the Nile: Thonis arrested Alexander (Paris), the son of Priam, because Alexander had abducted Helen of Troy and taken much wealth.Herodotus, Histories, 2.113-115 Heracleion is also mentioned in the twin steles of the Decree of Nectanebo I (the first of which is known as the 'Stele of Naukratis'), which specify that one tenth of the taxes on imports passing through the town of Thonis/Herakleion were to be given to the sanctuary of Neith of Sais. The city is also mentioned in the Decree of Canopus honoring Pharaoh Ptolemy III, which describes donations, sacrifices and a procession on water. Archaeology Ptolemaic coins from the submerged Heracleion In 1933, an RAF commander flying over Abu Qir Bay saw ruins under the water. At that time, most historians believed that Thonis and Heracleion were two separate cities, both located on what is now the Egyptian mainland. The ruins submerged in the sea were located and explored by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio in 1999, after a five-year search. Numerous finds from the site have indicated that the city's period of major activity ran from the 6th to the 4th century BC, with finds of pottery and coins appearing to stop at the end of the 2nd century BC. Goddio's finds have also included incomplete statues of the god Serapis and the queen Arsinoe II. No more than 5% of the city's area was explored by the archaeologist. Around 2010 a baris, a type of ancient Nile river boat, was excavated from the waters around Heracleion. Its design was found to be consistent with a description written by Herodotus in 450 BC. In July 2019, a small Greek temple, ancient granite columns, treasure-carrying ships, and bronze coins from the reign of Ptolemy II, dating back to the third and fourth centuries BC, were found at Heracleion. The investigations were conducted by Egyptian and European divers led by Goddio. They also uncovered a devastated historic temple (the city’s main temple) underwater off Egypt's north coast.

In his final statement before his execution by firing squad in 1960, Rodgers requested a bulletproof vest. His execution by firing squad would be the last to be carried out in the United States before capital punishment was halted by the U.S. Supreme Court. The death penalty was reinstated in 1976 and the first person executed in Utah subsequent to that date was Gary Gilmore in 1977.

At the age of twelve, he left his family's household, where his father forced the children to work. By the age of sixteen, he became involved in a bootlegging operation and was injured in the legs by machine gun fire. Rodgers eventually became involved in armed robbery, spending over twenty years in incarceration at various prisons. Death of Charles Merrifield In 1957, Rodgers came from New Mexico to work as a part-time security guard with the Continental Uranium Company at its Rattlesnake uranium mine near La Sal, Utah. Following an altercation on June 19 of that year, James W. Rodgers shot miner Charles Merrifield, who died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head, arm, and torso. The two had been arguing over how to properly grease a scoop shovel. Rodgers drove off in his truck, but was quickly apprehended in Colorado and turned over to the Grand County Jail in San Juan County, Utah. He claimed that he had been repeatedly threatened and thought Merrifield was going to \\"beat him up.\\" Rodgers said that he \\"challenged Merrifield with a gun\\" and shot him when Merrifield attacked him with a large wrench. Murder trial San Juan County Courthouse in Monticello, Utah. Rodgers was arraigned at the San Juan County Courthouse in Monticello, Utah on June 26, 1957, and was formally charged with murder. Rodgers claimed that he was suffering from syphilis and pleaded \\"guilty by reason of insanity\\". During the trial, Rodgers asserted that he had killed Merrifield in self-defense. However, Merrifield was determined to have been shot by Rodgers' .38-caliber handgun while at the controls of the large shovel at the mine. Upon being convicted and sentenced to death, Rodgers was given the choice of execution by firing squad or hanging; he chose to be shot. Rodgers said that he was not worried because he would succumb to syphilis before his execution. However, he did not test positive for the disease under medical examination. Rodgers filed three appeals, including one to the Supreme Court of Utah, all of which were denied. Rodgers was sent to death row at Utah State Prison, where he was considered a model prisoner and wrote of his \\"deepest gratitude for the many favors and the kindness\\" during his 2 years as an inmate. He made no request for a special last meal nor other favors before his execution. Execution Rodgers awaited execution on death row at Utah State Prison. On the morning of March 30, 1960, Rodgers was driven to the execution site on a clay flat about a mile (1.6 km) from the prison accompanied by San Juan County Sheriff Seth Wright and a prison chaplain. When asked for a final statement, Rodgers continued to insist that he was innocent and said, \\"I done told you my last request ... a bulletproof vest.\\" He was dressed in denim and offered a coat, to which he replied, \\"Don't worry, I'll be where it's warm soon.\\" Rodgers was strapped to a wooden chair inside a 20-foot (6.1 m) canvas enclosure. The firing squad, concealed in a smaller burlap enclosure about away, consisted of five volunteers who were paid $75 each($655.43 in 2020 USD). One of the marksmen was provided with a .30-30 rifle that was loaded with a blank, so that none of them would be certain who fired the lethal shots. Rodgers was executed at 6:16 a.m., the time of sunrise. Rodgers' body was claimed for burial in California by his mother, who had last visited him ten days before the execution. Rodgers would be the last person to die by firing squad in the United States for almost 17 years, until Gary Gilmore became the first to be executed after the reinstatement of capital punishment by the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Gregg v. Georgia. See also *Capital punishment in Utah *Capital punishment in the United States References Further reading * External links *The State of Utah v. James W.

It had the second highest number of casualties of all Michigan infantry regiments in the war. Of all Union infantry regiments in the war, the Fifth Michigan ranked fifth in total number of casualties endured.

The plan which was developed in a joint cooperation with Cities, Counties, Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and METRO. The RTP combines research, plans and programs by various organizations into one comprehensive plan which is updated every four years. The RTP's main aim is to identify long-range transportation needs, prioritize programs and projects and to provide a forum for dialogue and regional problem solving. The Houston-Galveston Area is one of the fastest growing metropolitan area in the United States, with a projected rise in the region's population by 3 million and the creation of 1.5 million new jobs. It is estimated that this growth will create a demand for 1.7 million new homes in the region. The rapid expansion of the region will lead to a heavy drain on the current infrastructure and adequate planning must be undertaken to ensure safe and attractive communities, good schools and a transportation system that provides easy access for residents across the region. Envision Houston Region The RTP began as a public outreach program called Envision Houston Region (EHR). The program was an outreach initiative which brought together hundreds of residents, elected officials, developers and other participants of various workshops. The outcome of the program was a clear need for jobs closer to homes, more travel options and environmental concerns. The 2035 RTP uses these needs as guiding principles for the development of transportation infrastructure. 2035 RTP Goals The Following have been outlined as goals for the 2035 RTP to accomplish: # Improve Mobility, Reduce Congestion # Improve Access to Jobs, Homes & Services # Increase Transit Options # Coordinate Transportation and Land Use Plans # Create a Healthier Environment Meeting RTP Goals System Expansion The 2035 RTP plans to expand the current transportation system in order to meet the growing demand. The system will expand selected roads, bus & transit services and bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Roadway System The RTP will add 6,100 new arterials and 1,420 tollway lane miles to the current system. The following are some of the Major projects that will be undertaken: *SH 99 (Grand Parkway) **Construction of toll lanes and interchanges *US 290 **Widen Main Lanes **Construct Commuter rail between Downtown and SH 99 **Construct Managed lanes along Hempstead Highway. *I-45 **Reconstruct and add Managed Lanes **Construct a Light Rail From US 59 to Intercontinental Airport **Widen main lanes ** Construct managed lanes ** Construct Commuter Rail along SH 3 from Galveston to Downtown *SH 35 **Construct Tollway *US 59 (south) ** Widen main lanes *SH 146 **Widen main lanes **Construct managed Lanes *SH 249 ** Construct toll lanes *US 90A **Construct commuter rail line from I-610 Loop to Rosenberg Transit System The RTP also plans close to $18 billion in capital investments for transit systems across the region. The key projects are: *Downtown Intermodal Terminal *81 miles of Lightrail *84 miles of Commuter Rail Transit *40 miles of signature Bus Service *10 New Transit Facilities \\\\---- Demand Management The 2035 RTP will try to alleviate future pressure on the system by reducing demand on the current infrastructure. Demand management will be an important tool to reduce congestion by encouraging other modes of transport, non-peak travel and alternate routing. The following strategies are recommended in the 2035 plan: Commute Solutions Commute solutions will promote transit, vanpools, carpools, telework and other transport options: *$7 Million annually for vanpools/carpools *$500 Million to support teleworking and Transportation Management Organizations \\\\---- Operations Management The 2035 plan will try to maximize the efficiency of the current infrastructure using low-cost techniques such as traffic signal synchronization, incident management and traveler information systems. Smart Streets Smart Streets consist of traffic light synchronization, deployment of medians, construction and extension of turn bays, consolidation of redundant driveways, and placement of appropriate grade separations Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) Houston's ITS is one of the more advanced ITS systems in the nation. The RTP designates $600 million for Houston TranStar to develop the Houston ITS system further. Safety Program The RTP will allot $347 Million to safety procedures and will: *Improve at-grade railroad Crossings *Add shoulders to Highways *Install Roadway lighting and Signage Security & Evacuation The Regional Evacuation plan will ensure the following in the event of a catastrophic event: *Designated fuel stops *State directed fuel resources *Pre-positioned tow trucks *Buses at pre-designated locations *Pre-arranged destinations and lodging \\\\---- Livable Centers The 2035 Plan presents a 3C's approach to development strategy: Centers, Connects and Context. This Strategy encourages transit, pedestrian and bicycle options. The RTP will allot: *$68 Million for livable centers projects between 2008-2011 *$20 million for additional support for long-range livable centers projects *$274 million in bicycle and pedestrian improvements \\\\---- Protecting the Environment Participants for Envision Houston Region showed an overwhelming concern for the environment and protection of greenspaces and natural resources. The 2035 RTP not only identifies sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands, prairies, forests and bayous but also takes initiative to cut vehicle emissions. *Clean Air Action - $1 million annually for vehicle emission reduction programs *Clean Vehicles/Clean Cities - $460 million to replace aging diesel engines and support clean technologies \\\\---- Funding The 2035 RTP is estimated to cost about $128 billion and will be financed from a combination of Federal, State and Local sources. It is projected that approximately 73% of total revenue will be generated from local sources with less than 20% coming from Federal sources. Tollway revenues are expected to make up to 17% of the total RTP revenues. The RTP will spend $66 billion (51%) on maintenance, rehabilitation and operations of the region's infrastructure. $47 billion (36%) will be used to expand highways, transit and local routes in the Houston-Galveston Area. The RTP program is facing a 70 billion dollar short fall as projected by Tx DOT. This means that the projected 2035 plan will have to be amended unless revenue can be generated to pay for the shortfall. Fee increases, consumption tax increases and a proposed mileage tax for the greater Houston/Galveston area are being looked at to shore up the gap. At the time of this writing government officials were surveying and accepting public comment to gauge public response to the revenue plan.www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22AZ2A7YFGY See also *Regional Transportation Plan *Houston-Galveston Area Council *Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas *Texas Department of Transportation References External links *Houston-Galveston Area Council *METRO *H-GAC 2035 Regional Transportation Plan *Texas Department of Transportation Category:Transportation in Houston Category:Transportation in Galveston, Texas Category:Transportation in Galveston County, Texas ","title":"Houston-Galveston Area Council 2035 Regional Transportation Plan"},{"id":"11771759","text":"Beaver Hunt is a pornographic magazine aimed at men and published in the United States.

The inpatient oncology unit located on the SMC campus consists of 30 beds. The latest cancer technology, along with a healing environment, brings together powerful medicine and patient-centered care. In April 2013, Gibbs Cancer Center was renamed Gibbs Cancer Center & Research Institute when a 7,500 square-foot research facility was added to the cancer center. This addition reflects the inclusion of substantial, cutting-edge clinical and translational research, and the construction of a state-of-the- art research laboratory with National Cancer Institute-funded investigators. Since Gibbs Cancer Center & Research Institute has grown locations across the Upstate: * Gibbs Cancer Center & Research Institute at Pelham * Gibbs Cancer Center & Research Institute at Gaffney * Gibbs Cancer Center & Research Institute at Union Gibbs Cancer Center & Research Institute at Pelham opened in spring of 2013. Gibbs at Pelham provides radiation oncology and medical oncology services. In 2015, Gibbs at Pelham added the Cyberknife M6 system, which is the first of its kind in the southeastern United States and was the first system in the United States to treat with the MLC apertures. Gibbs was the first place in North or South Carolina, and one of the first cancer centers in the United States, to utilize a new tool for prostate cancer called the SpaceOAR® System. SpaceOAR is the first FDA-approved procedure for placing a ‘spacer’ to protect the rectum of men undergoing prostate cancer radiation. Daniel Fried, MD, PhD, medical director and radiation oncologist at Gibbs Cancer Center & Research Institute - Pelham, was the first trained and certified physician in the Carolinas to use SpaceOAR. With a mission of providing oncology services to local communities and throughout the service area, Gibbs at Gaffney was opened in September 2011, and allowed the health care system to increase accessibility to oncology services to the Cherokee County community.

History   The Beginning: 1917 – 1939  Starting with the turn of the twentieth century, the number of hospitals in Spartanburg were beginning to grow. In the late 1910s, at least seven other hospitals served the city.Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System. (1996). Spartanburg Regional Medical Center: The First 75 Years. Spartanburg Regional One of those hospitals was Spartanburg Hospital, Inc., which opened in 1907 thanks in part to the efforts of Dr. Hugh Ratchford Black, known as an early pioneer surgeon in the area who also wrote a definitive history of medicine in the Spartanburg region at the time. Dr. Black actively campaigned for and supported the opening of a public hospital in Spartanburg. On July 21, 1919, ground was broken for Spartanburg General Hospital, and a newspaper article promised the public that they could look forward to one of the “best arranged and equipped hospitals in the entire South.” Dr. Black's Spartanburg Hospital was one of five hospitals that were sold in 1920-1921; the proceeds were used to finance Spartanburg General Hospital. When Spartanburg General Hospital opened on Aug. 29, 1921, people arrived by motorcars, horse-drawn buggies wagons and trolleys to celebrate the opening. Dr. Black performed the first surgery there – on his son, Paul Black. Later on Dr. Hugh R. Black and his sons, Drs. Samuel Orr Black and Hugh Snoddy Black, would open another hospital in at 1925 East Main Street, Spartanburg. That hospital was named for the family matriarch Mary Black. The original Mary Black hospital resided at 1925 East Main Street. Spartanburg General's early years were devoted to establishing key services. The Spartanburg General Hospital School of Nursing graduated its first class in 1922. Student nurses and SGH nursing graduates would play important roles in providing patient care for many years. The medical laboratory, the dietary department, a volunteer dental clinic, and a social services department were also established in these first few years. The 1929 stock market crash resulted in the closure of more than 700 hospitals across the country between 1928 and 1938. Spartanburg General remained open. Patients worked out their hospital expenses in creative ways. Farmers brought chickens, fruit and vegetables as payment on accounts, and their produce and livestock fed the patients. Flour and sugar sacks were turned into aprons and towels. Staff in the dietary department made soap. In spite of the Great Depression, Spartanburg General continued to add services. In 1933, W.C. Guy, the hospital electrician, helped improvise an electrically- heated incubator for premature babies, and the hospital assigned two nurses and a room in which newborns could be isolated, creating the forerunner to today's neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). In 1934, Spartanburg General opened the first local cancer clinic. It was one of the oldest American College of Surgeons (ACOS) Commission on Cancer-approved cancer programs in the nation. By 1938, the hospital treated 198 patients a day, up from the 1926 daily average of 54 patients.  The Mid-Twentieth Century: 1940s – 1960s  In the 1940s, a wing added to the south end of the hospital contained 63 private rooms, a new surgical suite, and other modern facilities. The School of Nursing added a new library and laboratories. From 1943 to 1946, the Spartanburg General Hospital School of Nursing was affiliated with the United States Cadet Nurse Corps. Nurses in training could transfer to an Army, Navy or Veterans’ hospital during their last six months of training. With World War II raging, more than 30 local physicians left Spartanburg to serve in the war. After the war, expansion continued to accommodate the postwar baby boom. Additional expansions in the 1950s and 1960s added a pediatric floor, a new delivery suite, a larger emergency room, additional operating rooms, and intensive and coronary care units. Bed capacity was now 459. The 1960 expansion offered patients new comforts including private or semi-private rooms with private bathrooms. Bedside telephones and a nurse call system were installed, and the bed crank of the 1920s gave way to an electrical bed operated at the touch of a button. Color televisions replaced the coin- operated radios once mounted on the bed for the entertainment of the patient. That same year, the ‘Gray Ladies’ began their service of guiding patients to their rooms from the admitting office. This was the inception of the volunteer services department. By the mid-1960s, the hospital had more than 1,000 staff members, and the patient population was about to change exponentially. In July 1966, the hospital was approved for Medicare patients. This brought a multitude of new rules and regulations and a pressing need for trained staff and new beds. At the same time, hospital-based nurse training programs were being phased out all over the nation and replaced by college and university training. In February 1967, hospital officials signed an agreement with University of South Carolina (USC) trustees to establish USC-Spartanburg (now known as USC-Upstate) complete with a nursing school. After 48 years of educating nurses, the Spartanburg General Hospital School of Nursing graduated its final class in 1969. The school brought more than 1,000 graduate nurses into the profession.  The Late-Twentieth Century: 1970s – 1990s  In 1968, Spartanburg General added a new data center to handle a modern phenomenon: a tsunami of information. Computers had come to the General, and they had come to stay. Also in 1968, due to growing services, Mary Black Memorial Hospital moved from East Main Street to its current location on Skylyn Drive. A technological revolution was also at play in medicine. New treatments for cancer and coronary disease called for new laboratories and the latest equipment. A newborn nursery suite opened in 1968 and obtained a nursery for well babies and an intensive care nursery with equipment to monitor heart rate and respiration as well as a transport isolette with its own battery power so that newborns could be safely transported between hospitals. In 1976, SGH technicians began using ultrasound equipment to monitor pregnancies. An endoscopy department opened, and in 1977, the hospital obtained a $550,000 EMI scanner, the first full-body CT scanner in South Carolina. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Spartanburg General expanded its commitment to educating medical professionals. The Department of Medical Education was established in 1970, making Spartanburg General the first hospital in South Carolina approved by the American Board of Family Practice for Family Practice residencies and the fifth chartered Family Medicine program in the nation. In 1981, Spartanburg General's Pharmacy Residency Program earned accreditation from the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists, which allowed post-graduates a year-long experience in different specialties to prepare them for supervisory positions in other hospital pharmacies. Technological improvements and a growing staff of medical residents called for more space. In 1972, Gov. John C. West presided over the groundbreaking ceremony for the $3.5 million ambulatory care, education and administration building. The building offered a modern outpatient service unit and an emergency department equal to the task of serving 40,000 patients a year. The 1980s heralded a new direction for Spartanburg General Hospital as it moved from a community institution to a regional tertiary care hospital. The hospital added a Home Health program and a Hospice program to provide end of life care and support for patients and their families. In 1984, Spartanburg General's In-Patient Hospice Unit – the first in the two Carolinas – opened its doors. Cardiac care was also advancing. The hospital established a cardiac rehabilitation program to treat patients with heart conditions. Surgeons performed Spartanburg General Hospital's first open-heart surgery in 1981. The hospital opened a new Sleep Disorders Center—one of the first programs of its kind in the Southeast. Spartanburg General was also at the forefront of cancer research. In 1983, a $150,000 National Cancer Institute (NCI) grant enabled the hospital and its staff to participate in the National Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP), the first of many cancer research projects at the hospital. During the hospital's celebration of its 65th birthday in 1986, the decision was made to change the institution's name from Spartanburg General Hospital to Spartanburg Regional Medical Center (SRMC). The 95-bed Regional Heart Center opened in 1988. It was the first in the Carolinas to consolidate prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of heart diseases under one roof. The new Heart Center brought the total number of beds at SRMC to 588. In 1988, medical advancements included Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In 1994, SRMC purchased the building and equipment of Doctors Memorial Hospital on Serpentine Drive. Renamed the Spartanburg Hospital for Restorative Care (SHRC), the hospital serves acutely ill patients who need care longer than is provided in a traditional hospital setting. The eight-story Rose and Walter Montgomery Patient Tower opened in 1996. Designed to meet new demands for patient comfort and family involvement, the Tower also brought services physically closer to one another to make the operation of the hospital more efficient. In 1996, the Regional Outpatient Center (ROC) opened. Built on the grounds of the former Nurses’ Residence, the building consolidated all outpatient services. SRMC also consolidated its women's services areas at the hospital by opening the Regional Center for Women in 1996. The Rx Robot entered the scene in 1997, continuing the hospital's role as an important innovator in health care. The robot minimized medication errors and ensured that expired medications were disposed of immediately.  The Twenty-first Century: 2000 – Present Day  A new era in Spartanburg Regional's history began in 1999 with the opening of the Gibbs Cancer Center. It included the area's only radiation oncology center. The Inpatient Oncology and Hospice unit at the Gibbs Cancer Center includes 30 oncology and hospice rooms. While directors and physicians had been planning the facility for several years, a $1.2 million gift from the Marsha and Jimmy Gibbs family accelerated its construction. The gift was a catalyst for community donations totaling more than $3 million, including $165,000 in donations from employees Gibbs Cancer Center was one of the first facilities to offer all cancer services under one roof. Now known as the Gibbs Cancer Center and Research Institute, SRHS is investing in physicians, technology, facilities, and research to create the cancer center of the future. In 2007, SRHS broke ground on the Bearden-Josey Breast Health Center, which opened in 2008. Six satellite locations of the Center are now open. From 2011 to 2013, SRHS expanded its cancer care service area by opening two satellite facilities: Gibbs Regional Cancer Center at Gaffney and Gibbs Regional Cancer Center at Pelham. SRHS also joined forces with Bon Secours St. Francis Health System to expand services and research. Innovative technology investments during this era included Gibbs being the first hospital in the state to offer TomoTherapy, a target form of radiation therapy. In addition, Gibbs Pelham was the first hospital in the Upstate to use the CyberKnife Robotic Radiosurgery System, a surgery-free radiation therapy. Also in 2015, Gibbs became the first cancer center in the Carolinas and one of the first cancer centers in the United States to use new technology called the SpaceOAR System for prostate cancer radiation therapy. SRHS continues to grow and innovate with a focus on providing state-of-the art patient care. In 2002, the Regional Surgery Center relocated its 7 operating suites from Spartanburg Hospital for Restorative Care to a freestanding Ambulatory Surgery Center. SRHS also established the first hospital-based air ambulance service in the Upstate with Regional One. In 2004, the Surgery Center at Pelham opened as a joint venture between local surgeons and SRHS. This was followed by the Village at Pelham Medical Office Building in 2006. In 2008, the 48-bed Village Hospital opened as a fully operational acute-care facility. This facility became known as the Pelham Medical Center in 2014. A new Emergency Center (EC) opened in 2004 with 55 beds, double the size of its predecessor. The EC became one of the busiest in the Carolinas, with almost 100,000 visits annually. In 2006, the $5.3 million Regional Hospice Home opened. It is the only hospital-based hospice home in the Upstate. Operating room innovations were key in 2008, when surgeons began operating in the first surgical suite in the United States that utilized the state-of-the-art modular VARIOP system that allows operating room walls to be reconfigured to meet the needs of a particular surgical team. Also in 2008, Spartanburg Regional became the first hospital in the South to perform robotic endoscopic beating-heart surgery. SRHS also established the most comprehensive and experienced da Vinci® Robotic Surgical program in the state. In 2010, Spartanburg Regional became the first hospital in South Carolina to complete a minimally invasive, robotic-assisted lung surgery for early lung cancer. Spartanburg Regional was also at the forefront in surgical innovations such as 3D printing for knee replacements and in being named a Blue Distinction Center in hip replacement surgery by BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina. In 2016, Beaumont Mill filled with people for the first time in nearly 20 years. After a year of renovations, Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System relocated 600 administrative and support services to the former textile mill, freeing up space at Spartanburg Medical Center for additional patient services. Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System continues to grow and change in order to provide state-of-the-art care to patients and their families. In 2019, the histories of Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System and the Mary Black Hospital became intertwined again. Spartanburg Regional acquired Mary Black Health System, including hospitals in Spartanburg and Gaffney, multiple physician practices and nearly 1,400 associates, became part of Spartanburg Regional. The purchase from subsidiaries of Tennessee-based Community Health Systems allowed Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System to serve even more patients in Spartanburg and Cherokee counties.

The 1992 attack on the Israeli embassy and the 1994 bombing of the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires also helped create an impetus for Jews to emigrate. More than 10,000 Jews from Argentina immigrated to Israel since 2000, joining the thousands of previous olim already there. The crisis in Argentina also affected its neighboring country Uruguay. Between 1998 and 2003, more than half of that country's 40,000 Jews made aliyah. During 2002 and 2003 the Jewish Agency launched an intensive public campaign to promote aliyah from the region, and offered additional economic aid for immigrants from Argentina and Uruguay. Although the Argentine economy improved, Jews continue to immigrate to Israel, albeit in smaller numbers than before. Some of those immigrants returned to Argentina in the wake of Argentine economic growth from 2003 onwards. Olim from other Latin American countries, such as Uruguay, Venezuela and Brazil, are also making aliyah in smaller numbers.

With a focus on converting intent data into measurable ROI, Aberdeen provides accurate and targeted findings for a range of industry sectors including Business Intelligence, Customer Experience Management, Financial Management and Governance Risk and Compliance, Human Capital Management, Information Security, Manufacturing and Engineering, IT Infrastructure, Supply Chain Management, etc. History Aberdeen was originally founded in 1988 to use enterprise data to help businesses make business decisions by using data governance. Aberdeen has since been acquired by two different companies: Harte Hanks in September 2006 and later Halyard Capital in April 2015. The company initially provided technology industry data and predictive analytics for B2B marketers and sales teams, but as of 2018, provides targeted intent data for marketing and sales. Aberdeen’s method combines online interactions (topic, keywords, PageURL, and Opt-in) with targeting data (company, location, contacts), and first-party visitor intelligence and win/loss history. Aberdeen has databases of opt-in users who have explicitly said that they are looking for certain technology and want to purchase in a specific time-frame. On blind tests run by clients, Aberdeen’s models achieved 91% accuracy in predicting purchase intent. From 2016 to 2018 the Group partnered with Bombora, a provider of B2B demographic and intent-based data. On October 30, 2017, Marc Osofsky became Aberdeen’s chief executive officer and a member of the board of managers; Gary Skidmore became the chairman of Aberdeen.

The unit fought at Baton Rouge and Port Hudson before being converted into the 6th Michigan Heavy Artillery in July 1863. Service The regiment recruited across southern Michigan between April and August 1861. Governor Austin Blair appointed Kalamazoo resident Frederick W. Curtenius as colonel. Curtenius, in turn, selected Thomas Scott Clark and Edward Savage Bacon as lieutenant colonel and major, respectively. On June 19 the regiment’s officers (commissioned and noncommissioned) assembled at Fort Wayne, near Detroit, for training under regular army officers—most notably Alpheus Starkey Williams—as part of Michigan’s Camp of Instruction. Upon completion of that initial training, the full regiment assembled at Kalamazoo in mid-August and was deployed out of state, bound for Baltimore, at the end of the month.Faust, 6th Michigan, 3-26. Despite pronounced secessionist sentiment in Baltimore, the regiment’s stay there was mostly pleasant and uneventful. Major Bacon led the regiment on a bloodless foray down Virginia’s Eastern Shore in December as part of Brigadier General Henry Hayes Lockwood’s Peninsular Brigade. This expedition exposed the first cracks in the 6th Michigan’s discipline as the soldiers foraged liberally and harbored escaped slaves against orders. The Michiganders went so far as to openly taunt General Lockwood after he confronted the entire regiment in an attempt to apprehend a soldier who had stolen a turkey from a local farmer.Faust, 6th Michigan, 27-43. In February 1862 the 6th Regiment deployed for Ship Island, off the coast of Mississippi, where they were brigaded with the 21st Indiana Infantry and the 4th Wisconsin Infantry under Brigadier General Thomas Williams. The Michiganders participated in the successful New Orleans campaign, again without bloodshed. The unit disembarked in the Crescent City at the beginning of May, quartered briefly in the New Orleans Mint amid a hostile population, and resumed their trek up the Mississippi River soon after.Faust, 6th Michigan, 56-73. Curtenius’s troops waded through a cypress swamp overnight and severed the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad near Frenier Station in conjunction with the 4th Wisconsin. Proceeding upriver, they sickened shipboard amid logistical shortages and sweltering heat during an abortive move against Vicksburg, and withdrew to quarter at Baton Rouge. The regiment’s transports were fired upon en route at Grand Gulf, Mississippi, with the loss of one man killed and one wounded. They and the Wisconsin troops disembarked and sacked that town in retaliation.Faust, 6th Michigan, 73-86. The Michiganders’ discipline continued to erode. They had bristled under regular army discipline ever since Ship Island, taunting and defying General Williams at every opportunity—just as they had done with General Lockwood. This clash culminated with Colonel Curtenius’s refusal to expel escaped slaves from camp, citing the Act Prohibiting the Return of Slaves. Williams retaliated by arresting Curtenius briefly and turning the regiment out of its comfortable quarters at the Pentagon Barracks for several days, exposing the already sick soldiers to debilitating rains, heat, and humidity. Nearly half the regiment was hospitalized, and men were dying daily.Faust, 6th Michigan, 73-93. Throughout it all, the unit was engaged in and around Baton Rouge in the profiteering and plundering rampant throughout Benjamin Butler’s Department of the Gulf. Plantations were emptied of cotton and slaves, and some plantation buildings were burned to the ground. Cotton was shipped and sold under mysterious circumstances, to the financial benefit of men ranging from company officers all the way to the highest echelons of the military department.Faust, 6th Michigan, 89-90. After Curtenius resigned due to illness, leaving Thomas S. Clark in command of the regiment, Williams again expelled the disobedient regiment from its quarters. The unit’s four ranking officers refused to order the unit to move. They were arrested and sent to New Orleans, leaving the regiment bereft of field officers and under the command of its fourth ranking captain, Charles Edward Clarke, on the eve of the unit’s first general engagement.Faust, 6th Michigan, 100-103. For all its disciplinary woes, the sickly 6th Michigan fought tenaciously at the Battle of Baton Rouge on August 5, 1862. John C. Breckinridge assaulted Williams’s brigade—which Williams declined to fortify, and scattered around the edges of town—with two divisions. Many sick Michiganders snuck out of their hospital beds to join the fight. Williams, desperate to bolster the center of his line, divided the already thin ranks of the 6th Michigan into two shorthanded battalions. One battalion, under abolitionist Captain Chauncey Bassett, fended off an entire Confederate brigade at Magnolia Cemetery long enough to keep the Union center intact. Captain Harrison Soule’s Company I, with just 44 men and officers, stymied a flanking movement by the 6th Kentucky Infantry, buying critical time for artillery to engage. Soule and his company paid the steep price of nearly 60% casualties.Faust, 6th Michigan, 104-10. On the Union right, the 6th Michigan’s other battalion was reduced by picket detachments to just three companies totaling about 130 men under Captain John Corden. Yet they routed the entire Confederate brigade of Henry Watkins Allen with the help of one section of guns detached from the 21st Indiana, saving the Union right flank. Corden’s men, still grossly outnumbered, counterattacked in a bold bayonet charge, capturing the colors of the 9th Louisiana Battalion. The 6th Michigan’s entire loss in the battle amounted to 19 killed, 40 wounded, and 6 missing, or about 17 percent of the force engaged. General Williams was shot dead toward the end of the battle. Despite all the former animosity, he and the Michiganders had been mutually impressed with each other’s bravery under fire.Faust, 6th Michigan, 108, 110-12, 115-16. General Butler, spooked by the near loss of an irreplaceable brigade, reeled in his department's troops to bar the approaches to New Orleans. The 6th Michigan guarded Metairie Ridge and suffered severely from disease in a swampy setting. In October alone, 22 men died and 73 were discharged. November saw only a modest improvement, and as of December 6, the regiment, which had departed Michigan fifteen months prior with 996 men and officers, now reported a mere 191 men present for duty.Faust, 6th Michigan, 117-18, 121-24. The regiment quartered in a cotton press in New Orleans and recovered sufficiently by January 1863 to join Godfrey Weitzel’s operation to capture or destroy the troublesome, partially ironclad Confederate gunboat J.A. Cotton. After some light skirmishing, the Rebels torched Cotton to prevent her capture. Weitzel let his troops loose on the march home, and foraging soon evolved into outright pillaging, including the burning of five plantation homes.Faust, 6th Michigan, 127-34. After guarding New Orleans again until March, the regiment was ordered in conjunction with fragments of other commands to destroy railroad bridges north of Ponchatoula, Louisiana, as a feint in support of a larger advance by Butler’s successor, Nathaniel P. Banks. The Federals brushed aside modest resistance from Mississippi troops (20th Mississippi), and burned two railroad bridges north of town. Ponchatoula itself was sacked after an unsuccessful guerrilla attack enraged the Federals. Confederate reinforcements (1st Choctaw Battalion, 1st Mississippi, 14th Mississippi) arrived the next morning, and Clark’s expedition was driven all the way back to Pass Manchac, where they constructed Fort Stevens.Faust, 6th Michigan, 137-44, 148. On April 7, 1863, Clark led a handful of men on a raid aboard the partially ironclad USS Barataria. The ship ran aground at the mouth of the Amite River and had to be abandoned and destroyed under pressure from a small force of Confederate cavalry. Five days later, ten Michiganders set off in small boats to pursue a Rebel ship that salvaged one gun from the Barataria’s wreck. Clark’s men stumbled into an ambush, and all but one were captured.Faust, 6th Michigan, 144-46. The Barataria triggered the climax of bitter disputes between the 6th Michigan’s ranking officers, Thomas Clark and Edward Bacon. Clark’s persistent involvement in profiteering and plundering enraged Bacon, whose difficulties in accepting military subordination triggered incessant conflicts with his superiors. Clark had Bacon court-martialed, and although Bacon was exonerated, his arrest would again cause him to miss a major battle.Faust, 6th Michigan, 149-50. The 6th Michigan, brigaded under Neal Dow with the 128th New York, 15th New Hampshire, and 26th Connecticut, joined in Banks’s Siege of Port Hudson and suffered 118 casualties in the ill-fated frontal assault of May 27. Bacon returned to the regiment just in time for Banks's ill-advised second attack on June 14. The time, the Michiganders’ loss was limited to eight wounded, due only to Captain Corden’s refusal to press a suicidal attack.Faust, 6th Michigan, 154-65. Clark’s regiment spent the balance of the siege in trench warfare, sickening under poor living conditions and enduring constant sharpshooting. Bacon was arrested again, this time for openly speaking ill of the army’s leadership and prospects at Port Hudson. The 6th Michigan Infantry’s final engagement came in an night assault on June 29, in which 35 Michiganders were ordered to storm the Citadel, one of the strongest fortifications at Port Hudson. Nine men were killed and eight wounded. Assistant Surgeon Milton Chase called the assault—ordered by habitually drunk division commander William Dwight (and remembered as the “whiskey charge”)—“a wicked loss of life.” The 6th Michigan, ravaged by battle losses and disease, mustered just 160 men and officers present for duty as of July 4.Faust, 6th Michigan, 165-68. Port Hudson surrendered on July 9, and the 6th Michigan was converted into the 6th Michigan Heavy Artillery soon after. New recruits quickly outnumbered the few remaining veterans, and the character of the unit’s service was transformed into inactive garrison duty.Faust, 6th Michigan, 169-71. Total strength and casualties The regiment had 2 officers and 76 enlisted men killed in action or mortally wounded. 6 officers and 498 enlisted men died of disease, for a total of 582 fatalities.http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unmiinf1.htm The Civil War Archive website after Dyer, Frederick Henry.

This is located in Newcastle Upon Tyne. History Grammar school It was called the George Stephenson Grammar School in 1953, at which time it was built on Benton Lane (the Great Lime Road) in West Moor. (George Stephenson lived nearby in a cottage when he worked at Killingworth Colliery.) The current school site in Killingworth is a replacement that opened in 1970, and was originally known as Killingworth High School, a comprehensive, but eventually took the George Stephenson name from the old school. The old school no longer exists as it was demolished in 2004. The headmaster since the opening of the old school in 1953 was Tom W. King, BA. He became headmaster of the new school and finally retired around the end of the 1981-1982 school year. When he died in 2004 at the age of 94, a plaque reading \\"Here, from 1956 to 2004, stood a Place of Learning\\" was placed on the wall of the West Moor Residents Association Community Centre, which now stands on the site of the old grammar school. Each year group in the grammar school had 3 streams, L, G, and F. The L stream studied 3 years of Latin, 2 of German, and 5 of French. The G stream took German and French. The popularity of the grammar school was such that it had expanded over the years from about 350 pupils (the capacity of the original main building) to about 600 (by the addition of prefabricated classrooms at the rear of the school). Until 1970 the school had regular morning assemblies for all pupils. The school hymn was \\"Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer\\".

He was the 16th Associate Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court and unsuccessful candidate for the office of governor. He also served as a circuit court judge for the state of Oregon, was a customs collector, a judge in the Provisional Government of Oregon, and a commissioner on a Native American treaty commission. Early life Skinner was born in Portage County, Ohio in 1814.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956.

History of Oregon. San Francisco: History Co., p. 309-10. Then in 1845 Skinner set out over the Oregon Trail on a seven-month journey to immigrate to Oregon Country. He arrived later in 1845 in Oregon City, Oregon. Alonzo then set up farming in the Tuality District while still practicing law. Political career Beginning in December 1846 Skinner served as a circuit judge for the Provisional Government of Oregon. In that position he would travel from March through November to the county courts as a circuit rider. He was paid a salary of $800 per year for the job and served until 1849 when the Territorial Government arrived and judge Orville C. Pratt took over for Skinner. Later in 1849 Native Americans attacked and killed an American settler at Fort Steilacoom in Lewis County, after which chief justice William P. Bryant traveled to the fort for a trial of six defendants. Bryant brought along Skinner to serve as the prosecutor, and two of the six defendants were convicted and executed. After this in June 1850 he became a member of an Indian Commission set up by the United States government to negotiate treaties with the tribes west of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon.SuAnn M. Reddick and Cary C. Collins. Medicine Creek to Fox Island: Cadastral Scams and Contested Domains. Oregon Historical Quarterly, Vol. 106, No. 3. Retrieved on February 2, 2008. This commission was created because of the Donation Land Act in 1850 allowed citizens to settle up to and the government wanted the lands west of the Cascades for settlement and to move the Native Americans to Eastern Oregon. However, Skinner and his fellow commissioners John P. Gaines and Beverly S. Allen were only able to get treaties signed that allowed the tribes to remain on the west side and in the foothills of the Willamette Valley. The commission ratified 19 treaties and was then disbanded in February 1851. In 1851, Alonzo Skinner was appointed as an Indian agent by the government for Southern Oregon. In 1853 he ran against former governor Joseph Lane for the position of territorial delegate to Congress for the Oregon Territory. As a Whig party candidate Skinner lost to Lane the Democrat while calling for a transcontinental railroad in his campaign. Next in 1856 after moving to Pacific City, Washington, he married Elizabeth Hopkins Lincoln on May 22. Hopkins was a teacher in Vermont sent by Governor Slade to Oregon City. The two would then teach in Astoria, Oregon. Two years later the couple had moved to Willamina, Oregon in the Yamhill Valley where Alonzo had set up a land claim in 1850. The Skinners then moved to Eugene, Oregon where Alonzo returned to law practice. While in Eugene he served as the city's recorder and as a clerk for the county, elected to the latter as a Republican in 1862.Larson, Tony. Alonzo Skinner. genealogy.com.

He wrote the original versions of several funk classics such as \\"Cissy Strut\\" and \\"Hey Pocky A-Way\\". As a session musician he has recorded with a variety of notable artists such as Dr. John, Robert Palmer and Etta James. He is the recipient of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award as a member of The Meters. Career Nocentelli grew up in the Irish Channel and Seventh Ward neighborhoods of New Orleans. He was encouraged by his father to pursue music. He played ukulele at an early age and started on guitar at age twelve. He gravitated to jazz and was influenced by jazz guitarists Charlie Christian, Barney Kessel, Johnny Smith and Kenny Burrell. His first professional gig was at age thirteen. By age fourteen he was backing notable musicians such as Otis Redding and Clyde McPhatter. He played jazz, Dixieland, rhythm and blues, and rock. He joined the Hawketts and developed a reputation as a guitarist. At age seventeen he did session work for Motown acts including the Supremes, Temptations, and Spinners. In 1964 he was drafted and served in the army for two years. During leaves he did session work in New Orleans. After the service he joined Art Neville and the Neville Sounds, at the time a recently founded seven-piece band. By 1968 the band consisted of four members: Nocentelli, Art Neville, George Porter, and Ziggy Modeliste. The band had a fluid style and each instrument was free to go anywhere musically. The band performed dance- style rhythm and blues at the Ivanhoe nightclub six nights a week. On Sundays, Nocentelli, Porter, and Modeliste performed jazz gigs. Nocentelli said his bandmates were his biggest influence and called his experience up to this point in time the learning phase of his career. The band released two singles as The Meters, \\"Sophisticated Cissy\\" and \\"Cissy Strut\\", both originally written by Nocentelli. The commercial success of \\"Cissy Strut\\" became an impetus for the band's subsequent recording career as The Meters. From 1969 to 1977 the band released eight studio albums, with Nocentelli as one of the primary songwriters. He wrote the original versions of funk songs such as \\"People Say\\" and \\"Hey Pocky A-Way\\". Early on, improvisation was a major part of song development. Though the band gained notoriety in the music community, the lack of commercial success along with managerial and artistic factors gave way to their disbandment in late 1970s. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Nocentelli wrote, co-wrote and did session work – mostly in Cosimo, Sansu, and Sea-Saint studios. As songwriter and producer, he learned from and was influenced by Allen Toussaint. He backed a variety of artists such as Dr. John, Robert Palmer, Albert King, Etta James, Joe Cocker, Earl King, Chris Kenner, and Betty Harris. In the early 1980s Nocentelli toured with Jimmy Buffett. He moved to Los Angeles in 1982. He continued to do session work and performed regularly with former bandmate George Porter as GEO/LEO. He also remained close with Modeliste, who had moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. They performed in various quartet formations and released a live album titled Nocentelli: Live in San Francisco. At one of their shows in 1989, Nocentelli and Porter invited Modeliste and Neville on stage. The impromptu performance was the first reunion of the original Meters. The same year Nocentelli, Neville, and Porter formed The Funky Meters with Russell Batiste on drums. Nocentelli performed with the reincarnated lineup until 1993. He briefly moved back to New Orleans in the early 1990s and returned to Los Angeles in 1992. He continued to perform with two Meters-inspired lineups: The Meter Men and The Meters Experience. The Meter Men are Nocentelli, Porter, and Modeliste with Page McConnell on keyboards; variations included keyboardists Rich Vogel, John Gros, and drummer Russell Batiste. The Meters Experience is Nocentelli in various quartets with Bernie Worrell, Bill Dickens, Oteil Burbridge, Al Di Meola, Jason Crosby, George Laks, Albert Margolis, Jamal Batiste, Ricky Cortez, Felix Pollard, and others. Early on, Nocentelli used a Gibson ES-175 hollow body guitar. He switched to a semi-hollow Fender Starcaster in mid-1970s. Around 2001 he switched to the semi-hollow Gibson ES-335. Nocentelli has performed in several reunions with the original Meters lineup. He moved to New Orleans in 2015 and continues to perform. He received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018 as a member of The Meters. Style Nocentelli was self-taught. In his early teens he emulated jazz guitarists while listening to phonograph records. He was drawn to jazz, but to survive professionally he had to become proficient in multiple genres. In 1960s and 1970s he was part of an era in which New Orleans jazz gave way to rhythm and blues, and funk.Berry 1992, Up from the Cradle of Jazz, pp. 16, 192, 196. Nocentelli's band, The Meters, were innovative and set the stylistic tone of New Orleans funk. The band's early works were rooted in improvisation. According to Nocentelli, genres are relative and he alludes to incorporating different genres in his style. He said in funk as well as in rhythm guitar you have to complement and react to what you hear, and said that is not a teachable skill. In addition to live performance and session work, songwriting was a significant part of Nocentelli's contribution.

Biography He studied at St-Sulpice, Paris, was ordained priest by Archbishop de Quelenon, September 20, 1828, subsequently joined the Society of Saint-Sulpice, and in 1830 came to Baltimore. Fr. Verot taught science, philosophy, and theology at St. Mary's College and the seminary until 1853. He served as pastor of Saint Paul Catholic Church in Ellicott's Mills from 1853 to 1858. Nominated Vicar Apostolic of Florida, December 11, 1857, he was consecrated Titular Bishop of Danabe, on April 25, 1858, by Archbishop Francis Patrick Kenrick in the Baltimore Cathedral. Religious conditions in Florida were disheartening, with both civil and ecclesiastical instability. The new vicarate had only three priests, so the new bishop Verot sailed for France in 1859. Returning to his native country for the first time in nearly three decades, he recruited seven additional priests for his newly Americanized diocese.Michael V. Gannon, The Cross in the Sand (University of Florida, 1983) pp. 167-168. The new bishop also secured funds to repair churches at St. Augustine, Jacksonville, and Key West. He erected new churches at Tampa, Fernandina, Palatka, Mandarin, and Tallahassee, and staffed them with resident pastors. Bishop Verot also built Catholic schools and introduced religious communities to staff them. Five sisters from the Order of Mercy in the Diocese of Hartford (itself barely a decade old) opened a girls' academy, and three Christian Brothers from Canada opened a boys' school in St. Augustine.Gannon at pp. 168-169 In July, 1861, Bishop Verot was translated to the larger See of Savannah, but kept vicaral powers over Florida. Bishop Verot continued throughout the social upheaval caused by the American Civil War and Reconstruction. He drew particular attention for his response to President James Buchanan's proclamation of Friday, January 4, 1861 as a day for fasting and prayer. The bishop delivered a sermon defending Southern rights and slavery's legal basis as well as condemning the \\"false and unjust principles of Abolitionism\\" and the Know-Nothing movement which persecuted Catholics. His sermon was published and distributed throughout the South as a Confederate tract.Gannon, p. 170. However, Southern sympathizers did not draw attention to the sermon's second half, which started with a condemnation of the slave trade (consistent with Pope Gregory XVI's decree of 1839, and called for legal revisions to protect the rights of free Negroes, allow slaves freedom to choose marriage partners (and marry), and require masters to treat their slaves with justice, fairness and morality and particularly to provide them adequate food, clothing and shelter and the means to know and practice their religion.Gannon at p. 171 During the war, the bishop also condemned Union troops which looted the church at Amelia Island, and managed to evacuate personally several Sisters of Mercy from Jacksonville to Savannah through both opposing armies.Gannon at p. 174 After the war, Verot published a pastoral letter urging his people to \\"put away all prejudice ...against their former servants\\", advocated a national coordinator for evangelization among blacks, and brought in French sisters from LePuy to work with them (while acknowledging the resulting language problems).Cyprian Davis, History of Black Catholics in the United States (New York: Crossroad Publishing Company 1990) p. 119 Bishop Verot's courage and energy inspired his parishioners with patience and resolution in repairing the great losses they sustained in their religious and material interests. The Florida vicarate was elevated into a diocese in March, 1870. Bishop Verot thus became the first Bishop of St. Augustine, where he could concentrate on the work begun fourteen years previously. Bishop Verot's initiative helped Florida materially as well as religiously. He was amongst the first to advocate it as a health resort, as well as culture of products which have since become valuable. He made an annual visitation of the whole diocese, establishing churches and schools at advantageous points, and aiming to lay a broad and solid foundation on which his successors might build. He loved to revive the memory of Florida's early martyrs, Spanish as well as French. His numerous contributions on religious and historical themes in contemporary periodicals possess permanent value; his best-known writings are his Pastoral on Slavery and his Catechism. He took a prominent part in the Plenary Council of Baltimore and the First Vatican Council. At the Council Bishop Verot called for the condemnation of the heresy that blacks had no souls and were not members of the human race.John W.

Policies related to trade facilitation and economic development reflect the idea that trade can be a powerful engine for accelerating economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. Background World trade has expanded rapidly over the past decades. This has been driven, in large part, by the changing nature of both production and increased competition in international commerce. Another important factor contributing to the growth in trade has been the periodic rounds of successful multilateral trade negotiations. These talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO) have led to a considerable reduction in tariffs on goods crossing national borders. Today, as the role of traditional trade barriers gradually vanishes, the focus of trade policy has shifted to the remaining non-tariff barriers to trade, including trade facilitation. Trade facilitation involves a wide range of activities centered on lowering trade transaction costs for firms in global commerce. These costs include the price of moving freight from the factory to final destinations. Firms must manage border clearance procedures and pay trade services fees, among many other steps after goods and services are produced. As such, trade facilitation involves much more than trucking goods across national borders or shipping a package by sea transport. Cross-country comparisons and performance There is an increasing body of empirical evidence about the impact of trade facilitation on export competitiveness and growth. Studies reviewed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2002) indicate that trade transaction costs amount to up to 15 percent of the value of traded goods globally. A subsequent OECD study (2003) found trade transactions costs to be higher on agricultural and food products, fish, and forest and wood products (since these products are subject to additional border procedures due to sanitary and phytosanitary requirements). These are products for which many developing countries have an advantage. The same study also reported that small and medium enterprises suffer most from poor trade-related practices and poorer developing countries have a larger share of such enterprises. A number of other studies have illustrated the specifics of why trade facilitation matters and specific sources of trade costs. One study, for example, found that barriers to export performance in Africa are closely related to firm characteristics and policies that raise trade costs. This includes non- transparent customs laws and administration. Much less evidence was found that transport infrastructure, in comparison, had a significant impact on export performance (Clarke, 2005). World Bank research The World Bank is conducting extensive research on the issue of trade facilitation and its effects on trade, economic growth, and development. The main part of the research is carried out under the project Trade Costs and Facilitation. This project is focused on contributing to stronger understanding of the concrete relationships between trade costs, trade facilitation, private sector growth, and export competitiveness in developing countries. A major focus of the work is on exploring the dynamic gains associated with lowering trade transactions costs and identifying the relative importance of related reform measures. The World Bank's Doing Business 2007: How to reform report (2007) documents the wide range of reform needed in developing countries to lower trade costs.Doing Business 2007, The World Bank, September 5, 2006. The report outlines procedural requirements for importing and exporting a standardized cargo of goods in 155 countries. While the total cost to import (in US$ per container) was $842 on average in high-income countries, it was $1960 in low-income countries. Typical regulations in low-income countries required 13 documents from domestic regulatory agencies as compared to six signatures in high income countries, nine in upper-middle-income and ten in low-middle-income countries. On average it still costs almost two and a half times in expenses, more than twice as many documents and four times as many signatures to trade in a poor country as it does in rich countries. The Doing Business report provides concrete examples of efficiency savings made possible through trade facilitation reforms. Much of these relate to addressing regulatory reform and other steps—that in contrast to hard infrastructure—constitute the major part of why engaging in trade takes longer in developing countries. Progress in reducing costs, however, has been made. For example, Guatemala with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank changed to an electronic system for export authorization in 2000. Within four years the time for authorization of export documents dropped from one day to around three minutes. Tunisia has also introduced an automated system that provides a one-stop trade documentation-processing platform. Due to this innovation the processing time for trade documentation became reduced from 18 to 7 days which probably had led to substantial productivity gains according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. What are the gains from cutting trade costs? There are important gains to lowering trade costs and facilitating trade with some variation across countries and sectors (Francois et al., 2005; OECD, 2003). Several studies have focused on the impact of trade facilitation on the micro- level (OECD, 2005). They observe that in some developing countries inefficient trade regulations, documents and procedures are hindering firms' participation in export markets. The studies find large potential benefits from streamlining trade regulations and hence cutting the costs for exporting. Analysis by the World Bank suggests that raising global capacity in trade facilitation (port efficiency, customs, regulatory transparency, and information technology used in trade transactions) halfway to the global average would increase world trade by $377 billion (Wilson, et al. 2005). This is an increase of about 9.7 percent in global trade with the majority of the gains due to domestic reform and capacity building. About $107 billion of the total gain comes from the improvement in port efficiency and about $33 billion results from the improvement in customs environment. The gain from the improvement in regulatory environment is $83 billion. The largest gain ($154 billion) comes from an improvement in information technology infrastructure which is increasingly applied all across the trade value and logistics chain. The important work ahead to lower trade costs however is outside the scope of trade policy, therefore, and squarely centered within domestic reform agendas, including services such as transport, telecommunication, and others that affect trade transactions costs. There is also a key role to be played by private sector-led policy reform according to many of these studies. Trade costs and the multilateral trading system Talks are underway on revisions to the WTO rules on trade facilitation in the Doha Development Agenda negotiations. The outlines of a possible agreement includes, among others: (1). New obligations to promote electronic distribution and transmission of government trade regulations on imports and exports; (2). Standardization of certain basic fees for imports; (3). Stronger rules to help ensure freedom of transit for goods crossing national borders. In the WTO secretariat tabulation of proposals from August 11, 2006 there is consideration of more \\"ambitious\\" changes to current obligations, such as establishment of a single window for exporters and importers at customs or accepting copies of documents for import and export in lieu of originals. Since 2002 there have also been talks about explicit ties between a package of technical assistance and development aid as part of any final agreement. Developing countries participated very actively in these negotiations and before the suspension of the Doha Round in late 2006 considerable progress had been achieved (World Bank, 2006). Changes to the multilateral trade rules noted above can help in advancing transparent and predictable trading procedures for exporters. These rules have not been revised in over 50 years and crafting an achievable and focused next step in the Doha Agenda will be helpful to traders. This is especially true for small and medium-sized firms that lack resources and networks to overcome some of the more complex border rules now in place. Meeting trade facilitation goals in a broader and deeper context, however, will require action well outside and beyond the WTO framework. More effective delivery of development aid and technical assistance especially in projects to advance regulatory reform and support public agencies that promulgate and administer trade regulations is needed. A better understanding of conditions under which developing countries are ready to receive such assistance so that aid is effectively delivered is required. The agenda ahead At the most basic level, better data, analysis, and indicators of performance are needed to inform discussions moving forward on how trade costs and facilitation measures affect global commerce. Progress in reaching development goals in trade can only be made with accurate data and analysis to drive policy choice and action. Taking advantage of the energy behind reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), building on the datasets in the global monitoring reports which track progress in reaching poverty reduction goals, among other reports, makes significant sense. In sum, the data gathered to date illustrate the fact that the non-tariff agenda in trade is increasingly important to economic development ahead. References * Clarke, G. 2005.

In the case of golf pro shops, such stores usually provide equipment such as golf balls, clubs, shoes, and tees, as well as golf-themed gift items, and sometimes snacks or refreshments. Aside from golf courses, pro shops are also frequently found at bowling alleys, pool and snooker halls, tennis and racquetball courts, ice and roller hockey rinks, and football (soccer) facilities. Some American football teams, such as the Green Bay Packers and New England Patriots, offer team merchandise and replica apparel for purchase through team stores branded as \\"pro shops\\", either at a store at the team's stadium, a separate shop located in another venue such as a shopping mall, or through an online shopping portal. Pro shops are often managed by a house pro, a professional player, and overseen by a General Manager who is employed by or acts as a consultant contractor to the venue, though shops may instead be run by a retail manager at larger venues (or those too small to attract a pro). House pros are often available to advise on game-related issues such as rules details or the proper equipment for particular needs and conditions, and sometimes also for instruction such as group lessons or one-on-one training (usually for a fee). House pros sometimes also perform paid personal equipment maintenance, such as restringing tennis racquets, drilling and fitting bowling balls, re-tipping pool/snooker cues, skate sharpening, etc., depending upon the sport.

Scaggs has also had numerous collaborations with the Black Eyed Peas, Dilated Peoples, Quantic, Mayer Hawthorne, and Damian Marley. In 2008 she became a co-lead singer of the indie pop and neo-soul band Fitz and The Tantrums, and is featured on their 2010 album Pickin' Up the Pieces, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. She has toured extensively with the band and performed on shows such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Conan, and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Ellen, GMA, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and James Corden. She has been critically acclaimed for her \\"powerhouse vocals\\" and charismatic on-stage presence. Early life Scaggs was born on October 8, 1979, in Denver, Colorado. Her father was a DJ and Scaggs was exposed to his vinyl collection at a young age, including Parliament, Teena Marie, and The Pointer Sisters. She also listened to her parents play artists such as Marvin Gaye and The Temptations during house parties, and was influenced as a young singer by the music of Tina Turner. Early on, Scaggs would perform for friends and family, and at around 9 years of age, became more seriously interested in singing. In elementary school she began practicing daily and signed herself up for all available talent shows. According to Scaggs, \\"I was one of those kids who had friends but got picked on a lot...I felt like I needed an outlet. For me, that outlet was music.\\" Except for a year of vocal training in high school, she was self-taught and only considered becoming a professional musician as she approached graduation from South Pasadena High School. Music career Collaborations After high school Scaggs began working as both a professional songwriter and vocalist. Early on she faced financial hurdles, as well as finding the right producers. As a songwriter, Scaggs has referenced creative influences as diverse as Radiohead and The Bird and the Bee. Her first major label appearance was in 2000, as lead vocalist on the track \\"If There Be Pain\\" on the Interscope compilation project The Rose That Grew from Concrete. In 2001 she contributed vocals to Expansion Team by Dilated Peoples, and in 2003 contributed background vocals to the Elephunk LP by The Black Eyed Peas and Must B 21 by will.i.am. In 2003 she released her first 12\\" LP, The Craft, featuring hip-hop trio Dilated Peoples. She was a primary artist in 2006 on An Announcement to Answer by Quantic, and has since worked as a composer, songwriter, or vocalist with artists such as Orgone, Mayer Hawthorne, The Quantic Soul Orchestra, Guilty Simpson, Koushik, and Evidence. She also worked on Damian Marley's 2010 release with rapper Nas. In July 2008 she performed in four shows on Scion A/V's \\"Live Metro\\" tour featuring hardcore rap duo M.O.P.. Funk band Connie Price and the Keystones and saxophonist James King (later of Fitz and The Tantrums), provided backing. She has also sung backup for Miley Cyrus and modeled in an art piece for Kanye West. In 2008 she hosted the VMA's Nappy Boy TV with T-Pain. She has contributed to a number of film soundtracks as a singer and songwriter, including Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (in which she was also an uncredited actress) and The Nanny Diaries with Scarlett Johansson. She acted as a backup singer in Be Cool with John Travolta. The Rebirth Scaggs soon joined as front-woman and songwriter for The Rebirth, a Los Angeles soul band. In 2005 The Rebirth released their first album This Journey In on independent label Kajmere Sound. She wrote the track \\"Stray Away\\" and a number of other songs on their LP, co-writing with band leader Carlos Guiaco. The first single, \\"This Journey In\\", hit the top 5 of playlists throughout Europe and Japan, and attracted the attention of DJs such as BBC Radio 1's Gilles Peterson, King Britt of the group Digable Planets, and Norman Jay MBE. She toured with the band for ten years. After leaving the band, she took two years off from music. Fitz and the Tantrums Scaggs at a 2010 performance in San Diego In December 2008 she joined the Los Angeles soul/pop band Fitz and The Tantrums for a rehearsal after being recommended to band leader Michael Fitzpatrick by saxophone player James King. According to Scaggs, \\"When I first heard the project I was really attracted to the sound. It was something that wasn't really familiar in the spectrum of not being exactly Motown or something from the '80s.\\" They performed for the first time a week later at Hollywood's Hotel Café, and she decided to remain with the band as a vocalist, songwriter, and lyricist. They released their debut EP Songs for a Breakup, Vol. 1 in August 2009, and the tracks soon received airplay on public radio station KCRW in Los Angeles. Michael Fitzpatrick and ScaggsSix months after their first performance they had slots at Lollapalooza and Telluride Blues & Brews. In late 2009 they toured with Hepcat, Flogging Molly, and opened eight concerts for Maroon 5. The band signed to Dangerbird Records in April 2010, and Scaggs has since appeared with the band on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Conan and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Their first full-length album, Pickin' Up the Pieces was released on August 24, 2010. It received critical acclaim and reached No. 1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, 140 on the Billboard 200, and 18 on the Independent Albums chart. They were called by Vogue Magazine the \\"Hardest Working Band of 2011,\\" and \\"Artist to Watch\\" in Rolling Stone.

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. regarding employment discrimination. Two years after the Supreme Court decided that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not allow employers to be sued for pay discrimination more than 180 days after an employee's first paycheck, the United States Congress passed a fair pay act in her name to remedy this issue, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. She has since become a women's equality activist, public speaker, and author. In 2011, Ledbetter was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Personal life Ledbetter was born Lilly McDaniel in Jacksonville, Alabama, and graduated from Jacksonville High School in 1956. Her father J.C. McDaniel was a mechanic at the Anniston Army Depot. After graduating from high school, Lilly McDaniel married Charles Ledbetter and had two children, Vicky and Phillip. She remained married until Charles's death in December 2008. Ledbetter worked at Jacksonville State University in Jacksonville, Alabama, as the Assistant Director-Financial Aid from May 1974 to December 1975.  Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  In 1979, Lilly Ledbetter was hired by Goodyear, working as a supervisor. After working for Goodyear for nineteen years, Ledbetter received an anonymous note revealing that she was making thousands less per year than the men in her position. Only as she neared retirement did she learn she was being paid significantly less than male colleagues with similar seniority and experience. This letter led her to file a sex discrimination case against Goodyear for paying her significantly less than her male counterparts. She successfully sued Goodyear but the judgment was reversed on appeal by the Eleventh Circuit, and the Supreme Court affirmed that decision in 2007 because the action had not been filed within 180 days. The lawsuit eventually reached the Supreme Court, which denied her claim because she did not file suit 180 days from the date of the discriminatory policy that led to her reduced paycheck, though the paycheck itself was issued during the 180-day period. The Supreme Court did not consider the issue of whether a plaintiff's late discovery of a discriminatory action would excuse a failure to file within the 180-day period because her attorneys conceded it would have made no difference in her case. In dissent, United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote: > Lilly Ledbetter was a supervisor at Goodyear Tire and Rubber’s plant in > Gadsden, Alabama, from 1979 until her retirement in 1998. For most of those > years, she worked as an area manager, a position largely occupied by men. > Initially, Ledbetter’s salary was in line with the salaries of men > performing substantially similar work. Over time, however, her pay slipped > in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority. > By the end of 1997, Ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager > and the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15 male counterparts was > stark: Ledbetter was paid $3,727 per month; the lowest paid male area > manager received $4,286 per month, the highest paid, $5,236. In response, Congress later passed legislation, called the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, that restarted the 180-day clock every time a discriminatory paycheck was issued.  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009  Subsequently, the 111th United States Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009 to loosen the timeliness requirements for the filing of a discrimination suit so long as any act of discrimination, including receipt of a paycheck that reflects a past act of discrimination, occurs within the 180-day period of limitations. The act sought to reverse the Supreme Court's ruling in Ledbetter v. Goodyear, which restricted the time period for filing pay discrimination claims, making it more difficult for workers to file a complaint. Under this bill, every discriminatory paycheck or other compensation can be filed, unrestricted from a time period for filing a claim of pay discrimination. 265x265px Passage of the act did not result in Ledbetter receiving a settlement from Goodyear. Although Lilly will never receive restitution from Goodyear, she said, \\"I'll be happy if the last thing they say about me after I die is that I made a difference.\\" The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was President Barack Obama’s first official piece of legislation as president. He said: “When I came into office, we passed something called the Lilly Ledbetter Act, named after a good friend of mine, Lilly Ledbetter, who had worked for years and found out long into her work that she had been getting paid all these years less than men, substantially. She brought suit. They said, well, it’s too late to file suit because you should have filed suit right when it started happening. She said, I just found out. They said, it doesn’t matter. So we changed that law to allow somebody like Lilly, when they find out, to finally be able to go ahead and file suit.” By 2011, over 350 cases had already cited the Ledbetter decision since it was handed down in 2009. Ledbetter speaks during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a framed copy of the bill, Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, in her chambers. Ledbetter promoting Barack Obama for working-class families in Pennsylvania for his presidential campaign in 2008. Women's equality On August 26, 2008 (Women's Equality Day), Lilly Ledbetter spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, on the topic of pay equity. She said, \\"This cause, which bears my name, is bigger than me. It's as big as all of you. This fight, which began as my own, is now our fight—a fight for the fundamental American values that make our country great.\\" Ledbetter also declared that \\"what we lose can't just be measured in dollars.\\" In February 2012, Ledbetter released , a memoir detailing her struggle for equal pay. Her book chronicles her life from her humble beginnings in Alabama to the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed by President Obama in 2009. Grace and Grit is the first time she shared her life story and journey leading to her national struggle for fair pay. On September 4, 2012, she spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. On October 31, 2012, Lilly Ledbetter appeared as a guest on the Colbert Report to promote her book, Grace and Grit: My Fight for Equal Pay and Fairness at Goodyear and Beyond.

As servers need adequate internet connection, power and can be noisy,Custom designed server , barebone-based approach. they are often located in a colocation center. Servers are available on the market the same way as laptops or desktops are available and can be purchased by individual already pre-configured. Ordinary desktop computers are not suitable to house in colocation centers as servers have specific form factor that allows them to fit many into a standard rack. This group also includes custom-designed experimental servers, made by hobbyistsCustom designed server, design to maximize performance per watt. Virtual server also offer high degree of freedom, superuser access and low-cost service.  Usage as Server Emulator  *Private server can specifically mean a server emulator, a re-implementation of online game server such as MMORPG genres like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XI. Private machines can be used in various experimental projects such as games under development or various innovative startups. * Many private servers are being developed to modify the game play, making the game a lot easier, more difficult, add new or modify existing content such as NPC, Skills, Classes, and Items. * There are different categories of servers, a hard server, easy server, and classic server. * Some servers are created for fun, allowing players to skip the grind of playing the retail server and enjoy the end game content. Most popular private server categories are World of Warcraft, MU Online, Metin2, Silkroad, MapleStory, Conquer Online and many more! * Most private servers are being ran as a business, allowing players to purchase in game items and rewards by \\"donating\\" real money, rather than a fun environment for players. * In order to change the dynamic of a game, private server providers sometimes heavily modify the game. Adding or deleting some NPC or skills, increasing or decreasing the game treasures drop rates, modifying the models in the game, or adding some original functions to the game are all examples. * Private servers may have bugs and stability issues due to being developed by small teams of hobbyists. The official games provide greater stability in most cases. * Most private servers have a short life cycle. Running a private server is unconstrained by the law, so private servers can be set up and closed without notifying users. Additionally, a private server provider can suspend or ban any user's account for any reason. * The housing price tends to be cheaper than for the similar dedicated server as it does not include the price for renting the equipment. * The server activities are only regulated by the law and not by policies of the hosting provider. * Like any program you trust on the internet, a private server game file can contain malwares. But contrary to an old urban legend, it is not in the private server's interest to hurt its players because it needs as many regular players as possible to survive (and to earn any money by selling services following a free to play model).  Disadvantages  * A dedicated machine is overkill for many web projects. Purchasing more limited resources through a web hosting plan may well be cheaper. * The owner must be able to manage software and ensure security (though it is possible to purchase a security audit). * The price of a new server is comparable to the 9price of a used car: several thousand to several tens of thousand dollars, depending on configuration. This may be too expensive for a hobbyist but acceptable for a business start-up, even without an investing company behind it. * With very high end hardware, the traffic speed may become a bottleneck. Multiple servers, scattered through the world, may be able to handle more connections even when each of them is less capable.

She has had over 90 books published whose audiences range from children to adults. One of her best known works is the children's book Amazing Grace, which was a New York Times best-seller at 1.5 million copies and a finalist for the 1991 Kate Greenaway Medal. From 2002 to 2012, she wrote the teen fiction series Stravaganza.  Background  Born in Hampshire, England in 1945, Mary Hoffman was the youngest of three daughters. From a young age, she enjoyed going underground to visit the office of her father who worked for the railway. Hoffman won a scholarship to James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich. From there she went to the University of Cambridge to study English at Newnham College and then spent two years studying Linguistics at University College London. In 1998 she was made an Honorary Fellow of the Library Association for her work with children and schools. She worked at the Open University for nearly five years, contributing to courses for teachers on reading, language and children's literature. For eighteen years she was Reading Consultant to BBC Schools TV's Look and Read series and wrote the teaching scripts. She has been a freelance, self-employed professional writer and journalist since the mid-90s. She has argued for the role of British Children's Laureate to encompass active lobbying against cutbacks to libraries and was a nominee for the 2011–2013 post. Hoffman lives with her husband Stephen Barber, whom she married in 1972. She moved from London to West Oxfordshire in 2001. They have three daughters, including the writer Rhiannon Lassiter. Hoffman frequently works in Italy and speaks Italian. She has also lectured in Latin and Anglo- Saxon. Hoffman is a contributing blogger to Book Maven and The History Girls. In 2016, Hoffman and Barber founded The Greystones Press, an independent book publishing company.  Writing  Mary Hoffman's first book was White Magic in 1975. At the suggestion of Richard Adams, she had it published by Rex Collings after it was rejected by several other publishers. Hoffman has written 24 picture books including the Amazing Grace series. When it was published, she received an award from Waldenbooks. Amazing Grace was adapted to the stage by Shay Youngblood and ranked as one of the 50 best culturally diverse children's books by Seven Stories. The 2015 anniversary edition features and afterword by LeVar Burton. The illustrator, Caroline Binch, hired members of a family in Gambia as models for Grace and other characters. Hoffman has described the trip to visit them as her first trip to Africa. Hoffman began to focus more on teen fiction in the years since, becoming known for the Stravaganza series and the historical novel The Falconer's Knot, which won the French Prix Polar Jeunesse and was shortlisted for The Guardian Children's Book Award and North East Teenage Book Award. Hoffman has written several re-tellings of myths, legends, fairy tales, nursery stories and biblical stories. These include Women of Camelot, which tells the King Arthur stories from the points of view of the female characters. She has also edited collections of stories, including Lines in the Sand (2003) – a response to the allied invasion of Iraq, with all funds raised donated to UNICEF in Iraq. She was nominated for the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award in 2011. Her works for adults are published under a variety of names including Amy Lovell, Suzy Cavendish and Mary Lassiter.

(2014). Theodoxus (Theodoxus) fluviatilis (Linnaeus, 1758). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=821986 on 2014-11-18 This widely distributed neritid snail species occurs from Europe to Central Asia. It has a thick shell with a calcified operculum. The coloration pattern on the shell is very variable. Theodoxus fluviatilis lives in freshwater and in brackish water, in rivers and lakes on stones. It feeds mainly by grazing on biofilms and diatoms. Some of the populations of this species are spreading, and these can reach densities up to thousands of snails per square meter. Females lay egg capsules, each of which contains a large number of eggs, but only one snail hatches from the capsule. The snails reach sexual maturity in a year, and the total lifespan is 2 or 3 years. Taxonomy Theodoxus fluviatilis was originally described under the name Nerita fluviatilis by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Linnaeus' original text (the type description) in Latin was very short, and reads as follows: Which means in English: \\"Nerita fluviatilis, number 632: the shell is wrinkled, there are no teeth in the aperture. It inhabits rivers in Europe.\\" Later, this species was moved to the genus Theodoxus Montfort, 1810. Theodoxus fluviatilis is in fact the type species of the genus Theodoxus. Anistratenko and colleagues designated the lectotype for Theodoxus fluviatilis in 1999 Anistratenko O. Yu., Starobogatov Ya. I. & Anistratenko V. V. (1999). \\"Моллюски рода Theodoxus (Gastropoda, Pectinibranchia, Neritidae) Азово-Черноморского бассейна.

(an English translation was published by Anistratenko in 2005). Subspecies Several subspecies of Theodoxus fluviatilis were described and (inconsistently) recognized by various authors: *Theodoxus fluviatilis fluviatilis (Linnaeus, 1789)\\"Theodoxus (Theodoxus) fluviatilis\\". Fauna Europaea, last update 27 January 2011, accessed 12 April 2011. – was described from a freshwater environment *Theodoxus fluviatilis fluviatilis f. fontinalis Brard, 1815 – is sometimes considered as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis *Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis (Linnaeus, 1789) – was described from brackish water by Linnaeus as a separate species, originally named Nerita littoralis. A study by Zettler (2008) proved that its status as a subspecies is unjustified, being regarded as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis. Although these so-called forms (form fluviatilis and form littoralis) differ in morphology, ecology, reproductive strategy and behaviour, they are probably just ecomorphs. *Theodoxus fluviatilis sardous (Menke, 1830) *Theodoxus fluviatilis subthermalis Issel, 1865 – or Theodoxus subthermalis (Bourguignat in Issel, 1865)Kantor Yu I., Vinarski M.

Cladogram A cladogram shows the phylogenic relationships within the genus Theodoxus: This cladogram shows that the sister group to clade B is clade C. They split in 5–11.5 Ma, when Lake Pannon existed. Theodoxus species living in brackish water include Theodoxus fluviatilis and Theodoxus jordani, but they are apparently not closely related. Distribution The exact type locality for this species is unknown, but it is probably the Main river in Southern Germany. Glöer (2002) considered the type locality sensu Linnaeus as \\"Habitat in fluviis, Upsaliae ad molendinam Ulvam & alibi\\", but this would suggest a brackish water environment. The distribution of this species was considered to be European, Lisický M. J. (1991). Mollusca Slovenska [The Slovak molluscs]. VEDA vydavateľstvo Slovenskej akadémie vied, Bratislava, 344 pp. but in reality the species occurs in the western to central Palaearctic. Its occurrence is scattered throughout Europe and in Western Asia except for the Alps and the regions immediately north of the Alps. This species does not live in Norway or Siberia. Theodoxus fluviatilis has the most widespread distribution of all of the species in the genus Theodoxus. PDF. It is in fact one of the most widely distributed species in the entire family Neritidae. This species is threatened mainly by river engineering and water pollution in densely populated regions. The species' population trend is overall stable, but is declining in some areas (Germany), while in other areas it is expanding (for example in the Danube river). In the Rhine river during the 1970s, Theodoxus fluviatilis came close to local extinction because of water pollution. Subsequently, the water quality improved for more than two decades, leading to a recovery. Even so, the species became extinct in the Rhine for an unknown reason in the late 1990s. Since 2006, Theodoxus fluviatilis recolonized the Rhine, probably via ship transport through the Main-Danube Canal. An analysis based on cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) gene has shown that the recolonization probably originated in the Danube. Europe The Gulf of Odessa is one of the locations where Theodoxus fluviatilis is known to occur. The species occurs widely in Western Europe, and it is also widespread in the north of Ireland, living in 10% of Irish streams and rivers. It lives in Great Britain, including the Orkney Islands, as well as in the Netherlands,Theodoxus fluviatilis, accessed 25 September 2008. Belgium, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, and Monaco. It also is found in France and Switzerland, where it is considered to be critically endangered. More to the south, it occurs in Spain and Portugal, although the species is restricted to karst springs in Central Portugal. In central Europe, this species has been recently introduced in the Austrian Danube, where it was first recorded in Tulln, Lower Austria in 2001. Schultz H. & Schultz O.

Theodoxus fluviatilis also occurs in Poland, in Slovakia where it is non-indigenous since 2002, and in Hungary. Zettler (2008) provided a detailed bibliography of the distribution of T. fluviatilis in Germany. The indigenous distribution of T. fluviatilis included all of the large rivers: Rhine, Main, Moselle, Neckar, Weser, Elbe and Oder. However, this species is now highly endangered in Germany (Stark gefährdet).Glöer P. & Meier-Brook C. (2003). Süsswassermollusken. DJN, pp. 134, pages 29, 108, . In Northern Europe, this species is found in Denmark, in Sweden as far north as 58° N. It can also be found on the coasts of Finland, in the Åland Islands, and is known to be found alive there since 1994. No other Theodoxus species reaches the Baltic Sea. It has the northernmost distribution of the genus Theodoxus and it is also the northernmost species of all Neritidae.

It can also be found in Iran, in the provinces of Kerman, Gilan, Mazandaran, Fars, Hormozgan, Lorestan and Khorasan. However, until 2012, all the records from Iran were listed as Theodoxus doriae. In Africa this species occurs in Algeria, and possibly (or probably) in Morocco, where there are records which some authors consider to be reliable. However, instead of one species, Theodoxus fluviatilis, Brown (1994) recognized three species in northwestern Africa: Theodoxus numidicus, Theodoxus maresi, Theodoxus meridionalis.Brown D. S. (1994).

Bunje (2005) hypothetized that the ancestral range of Theodoxus fluviatilis was the Ponto-Pannonian region (southern Ukraine, Romania and Hungary). Bunje suggested that the species first colonized northern Italy, Greece and Turkey; in the second phase it colonized Spain, France and Germany; and finally in the Holocene it colonized the British Isles, Sweden and the Baltic Sea. In 2002, German malacologist Peter Glöer summarized the distribution of this species during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. Description The shell of Theodoxus fluviatilis is somewhat depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch).Theodoxus fluviatilis. Marine Species Identification Portal, accessed 11 April 2011. Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width of an adult shell is usually 5–9 mm, but can reach up to 11–13 mm. The height of the shell is 4–6.5 mm, or up to 7 mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of the shell of brackish water populations is 9.3 mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8 mm, and the maximum weight of the shell is 124 mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1 mm, and maximum height is 9.3 mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343 mg. The exterior of the shell is basically whitish or yellowish, with a net-like dark reddish or violet pattern. This pattern is very variable (depending on environmental factors), sometimes partly presenting bands, and even occasionally being evenly dark. The shell is very variable in color and color patterns, showing great polymorphism. Shell coloration and patterns are very plastic in all species of the genus Theodoxus and these qualities may be influenced by factors like ionic composition of water, type of substratum and nutrition of individuals in various habitats. Zettler and colleagues (2004) showed that in the outer coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, the nearly black and often corroded shell form of Theodoxus fluviatilis is predominant, whereas in the inner (sheltered) parts of coastal waters, yellowish-green forms prevail. Glöer and Pešić (2015) observed that specimens from a darker stony substrate were black or dark brown. Shells of specimens of Theodoxus fluviatilis from Northern Europe are ornamented with a pattern of white, drop- like spots on a dark or red background. Specimens from South France and Spain are ornamented with a pattern of zigzag stripes, while specimens from the Balkans show all possible combinations of white drop-like spots and zigzag stripes. Animals from lacustrine habitats show dark or light bands on the shell. File:Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis 01.jpg|Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis File:Theodoxus fluviatilis dalmatinus 01.JPG|Theodoxus fluviatilis dalmatinus Images showing variability in the color patterns of shells of Theodoxus fluviatilis: {From Alster, Germany. |From Güstrow, Germany. |Zeta River, Montenegro. |From Neretva River, Bosnia and Herzegovina. |} The shell shape of Theodoxus fluviatilis is similar to that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the aperture of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, which makes them difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad rib (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to the rib. The rib is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the callus is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males. {The outer side of an operculum. |The inner side of the same operculum. |thumb|170px|The inner side of another operculum: la – left adductor, r – rib, rs – rib shield, ca – callus, ra – right adductor. |The rib shield of a male. |The rib shield of a female. |} Aberrations in the shape of operculum have been observed. In a specimen from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double rib was present, but the rib shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only the rib shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by the rib and the rib shield. The rib shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the foot is whitish. Radula A drawing depicting a single row of teeth in the radula of Theodoxus fluviatilis Theodoxus fluviatilis, like all other species in the family Neritidae, has a radula which is of the rhipidoglossan type (a radula with many small marginal teeth which help \\"brush\\" food particles into the gullet). Zettler and colleagues (2004) and Zettler (2008) made SEM micrographs of the radula of this species. Reproductive system Theodoxus fluviatilis has separate sexes (i.e. these snails are dioecious). The diploid number of chromosomes (2n) is 25 in males and 26 in females. There is X0 sex- determination system in Neritidae, and it was confirmed for this species too. Females have two openings located under the edge of the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the vagina and an opening for laying eggs. The vagina accepts the sperm during copulation. The vagina is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid. In males, the semen is forming in the testis. The sperm structure of Theodoxus fluviatilis was examined by Gustaf Retzius.Retzius G. (1904-1921). Biologische Untersuchungen 13. Then semen travels through the prostate, where it mixes with prostatic fluid. Finally it goes through the vas deferens to the penis. The penis is located on the inner side of the right tentacle. The following illustrations show the reproductive system in the female and in the male: {|Drawing of the female reproductive system of the species, as first described (correctly) by Gustave Gilson (1896)Gilson G.

(1983). The colonisation of land: origins and adaptations of terrestrial animals. Cambridge University Press, 290 pp., page 37. That is much lower value than in marine snails in the subfamily Neritinae. The osmotic pressure and the composition of ionts of the hemolymph of the subfamily Neritininae (where does the Theodoxus belong to) is similar to the hemolymph of the land snail family Helicinidae. Ecology Habitat Some populations of T. fluviatilis use the seagrass Zostera marina as a habitat in brackish water environments. Theodoxus fluviatilis prefers lowland habitats (in Switzerland it occurs up to 275 m a.s.l.) and calcium-rich waters. This small snail inhabits the central and lower parts of rivers (up to 13 m deep), including in brackish water in tidal rivers of estuaries. It sometimes lives in lakes on unvegetated bottoms.Falkner G., Obrdlík P., Castella E. & Speight M. C. D. (2001). Shelled Gastropoda of Western Europe. München: Friedrich-Held-Gesellschaft, 267 pp. Rarely, it lives in springs (rheocrenes), in ground water, and in caves. For example, in the Åland Islands, Theodoxus fluviatilis was found living in lakes with a pH of 7.8–8.9. In streams and rivers in Ireland, the species lived in water with a pH of 7.0–8.4. The species easily attaches itself to stones, which allows it to live in fast-running waters and in wave zone in lakes. The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in brackish water demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species. This small snail can live in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. Brackish water populations can live in salinities of up to 15‰ in the Baltic Sea or up to 18‰ in the Baltic Sea and in Black Sea. Populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. Brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive substances in the foot. This species lives on hard benthic substrates, typically rocks. It lives on pebbles, sometimes on boulders, and rarely on dead wood. It tolerates mild organic pollution, low oxygen content (down to below 2 mg/liter) but it does not tolerate long periods of droughts, or ice. It lives in mesotrophic waters, and sometimes in oligotrophic waters. Theodoxus fluviatilis serves an indicator species for river monitoring (in Germany); however the spreading populations also have a high tolerance for degraded habitats. Theodoxus fluviatilis has a large phenotypic plasticity: it was found living on stones and on dead wood in freshwater environments; whereas it lives on stones and on Fucus vesiculosus, Potamogeton spp. and Zostera marina in brackish water in the Baltic Sea. The species can also be found on aggregates of Mytilus. This species, together with the isopod Saduria entomon, have been found to be a dominant part of the fauna biomass in the central and northern Baltic Sea.Kautsky H. (1989). \\"Quantitative distribution of plant and animal communities of the phytobenthic zone in the Baltic Sea\\". Askö Laboratory, Stockholm. abstract. Brackish water populations can reach densities up to 200–1000 snails per m². Theodoxus fluviatilis dalmaticus in Lake Ohrid can reach population densities up to 6412 snails per m². The species was found in population densities of up to 9000 snails per m² in a spring of the Anços river in Central Portugal, where there is a stable temperature of 15.3–16.6 °C, which allows continuous reproduction in Theodoxus fluviatilis. At Gabčíkovo port, in September 2003, a density of 34,932 juvenile snails per m² was recorded. Košel V. (2004). \\"Theodoxus fluviatilis (Gastropoda) – nový invázny druh v strednej Európe?\\". In: Bryja J. & Zukal J. (eds): Zoologické dny Brno, Sborník abstraktů z konference 12.-13. února 2004, page 51. . PDF. Feeding habits Theodoxus fluviatilis feeds mainly on diatoms living on stones, scraping biofilms and also consuming detritus. It can also consume Cyanobacteria and green algae as a poor-quality food supply. Cyanobacteria contain toxins and indigestible mucopolysaccharides, and green algae have cellulose in their cell walls (Theodoxus species have no cellulase enzymes to digest cellulose). They also graze on zygotes and germlings of brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, when the alga is small up to 1 mm. Peters and Traunspurger (2012) studied the effect of the grazing of Theodoxus fluviatilis on epilithic meiofauna and algae. Life cycle One egg capsule on the surface of a shell of a live Theodoxus fluviatilis. Remnants of two egg capsules are visible on the surface of this corroded shell of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The width of the shell is 8 mm and the height is 6 mm. Theodoxus fluviatilis is gonochoristic, which means that each individual animal is distinctly male or female, and cross-fertilization can occur. The sex ratio is 1:1. The structure of the flagellum of the spermatozoon is unique: the flagellum is divided into two parts. T. fluviatilis eggs are usually laid in from mid-April to October, in temperatures above 10 °C. Eggs are laid in egg capsules deposited on stones and sometimes on shells of conspecific individuals.Örstan A. (2007). \\"New year, new snail: Theodoxus fluviatilis\\". Snail's tales. accessed 9 December 2014. Females usually lay a cluster containing 4–5 capsules. A single female will usually lay about 40 capsules during summer, and about 20 capsules during autumn. Fresh capsules are white, but older capsules become yellow or brown and may bear an epiphytic outer layer. The capsules are around 1 mm in diameter (0.9–1.1 mm), but in brackish water they are usually smaller (about 0.8 mm). Empty (sterile) small capsules (0.5–0.8 mm in diameter) can also be laid. The number of eggs per egg capsule changes depending on the environment. There are 100–200 eggs in each capsule in freshwater, as opposed to 55–80 eggs in each capsule in brackish water. Usually, only one egg develops, with the remaining eggs serving as nutrition for the embryo, Beran L. (1998). Vodní měkkýši ČR. Vlašim, 113 pp., . page 45. which results in a single juvenile snail hatching from each capsule. Juveniles with a shell length of 0.5–1 mm hatch after 30 days (in 25 °C), or after 65 days (in 20 °C).Glöer P. (2002). Die Süßwassergastropoden Nord- und Mitteleuropas. Die Tierwelt Deutschlands, ConchBooks, Hackenheim, 326 pp., . pages 46–49, 51–53. The ash-free dry weight of newly hatched snails is 0.012 mg. The protoconch has one whorl.Bandel K. (2001). \\"The history of Theodoxus and Neritina connected with description and systematic evaluation of related Neritimorpha (Gastropoda)\\". Mittelungen aus dem Geologisch-Palaontologischen Institut Universitat Hamburg (85): 65–164. PDF. Capsules laid in spring hatch after 2–3 months, in August–September. Capsules from late summer overwinter because embryonic development ceases in temperatures below 10 °C, thus these capsules hatch in spring after 7–8 months. The shell grows mainly from May to August; there is no shell growth in winter. The snails reach sexual maturity in less than 1 year, when the shell length is 5.5–5.7 mm. The life span of T. fluviatilis is 2–3 years. The age of a few snails was estimated to be 3.5 years. The mortality rate is low in summer. However, it is higher in winter because ice and storms can dislocate the substrate, which can result in mechanical damage to the snails. Parasites and predators One of the known predators of Theodoxus fluviatilis is the common roach, Rutilus rutilus Parasites of Theodoxus fluviatilis include several species of trematodes. The snail serves as first intermediate host to Plagioporus skrjabini . and as second intermediate host to Cotylurus cornutus. Asymphylodora demeli is also found in this small snail,Poulin R. & Chappell L. H. (2002). Parasites in Marine Systems. Parasitology, 124, Cambridge University Press, 216 pp., page S123, S128. . as is Notocotylus zduni.Gibson D. I., Bray R. A. & Harris E. A. (Compilers) (2005). \\"Host-Parasite Database\\". Natural History Museum, London,Kostadinova A. (1993). Trematodes and trematode communities in fish-eating birds from the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Parazitologiia Institut, 5 pp. This small snail is also parasitized by several species of ciliates. It is the main host for the ciliate Trichodina baltica; the snails are usually 100% infected in the mantle cavity Another ciliate found in the mantle cavity is a species of Scyphidia. Two other parasitic ciliate species found in this snail are Protospira mazurica, and Hypocomella quatuor. Predators of Theodoxus fluviatilis include the common roach (a freshwater fish), Rutilus rutilus. Theodoxus fluviatilis is also the prey of some birds.

Originally the two-lane, unpaved road was numbered Iowa 88\\\\. It became part of Iowa 64 in the 1903s and it received its current route number in 1969. Iowa 330 is mostly a four-lane, divided expressway along much of its length. In conjunction with U.S. Route 65 in Iowa (US 65), Iowa 14 and US 20, Iowa 330 is commonly used as a connector between Des Moines and the Waterloo–Cedar Falls area. Route description Iowa 330 and U.S. 65 near Bondurant Iowa 330 begins at an interchange with Interstate 80 (I-80), U.S. Route 6 (US 6), and US 65 in Altoona. The I-80 freeway runs east–west; US 6 comes up from the southwest along Hubbell Avenue and joins eastbound I-80 while US 65 exits eastbound I-80 and turns onto Hubbell heading northeast. For the first of its routing, Iowa 330 shares the same roadway with US 65\\\\. The two routes head northeast on a four-lane expressway through Bondurant and into rural Polk County. In the northeastern corner of Polk County, the roadway breaks from its northeastern path to curve around the Engeldinger Marsh. The routes enter Jasper County and turn back to the northeast. North end of Iowa 330 and US 65 overlap at junction with Iowa 117 US 65 leaves the Iowa 330 expressway at the intersection with Iowa 117 north of Mingo. US 65 and Iowa 117 form the northern and southern branches, respectively, of a crossroad. The expressway portion of Iowa 330 extends on for , passing the communities of Rhodes and Melbourne. It intersects U.S. Route 30 at a diamond interchange just west of Marshalltown. later, now on a two-lane road, Iowa 330 turns north of Albion, bypassing Marshalltown to the west. On the way to Albion, Highway 330 crosses the Union Pacific Railroad main line and the Iowa River. North of Albion, Iowa 330 turns east and travels before ending at Iowa Highway 14. History The highway was originally designated as Highway 330 and paved in the late 1940s.

The ATS/shuttle bus service is free and connects the terminals to parking and rental lots. The entire system uses platform screen doors, which means that all the stations are enclosed with doors along the boarding area. When the train arrives at a station, the doors of the train and the station align and open in sync with each other. This method prevents people from leaving the platform, falling on the tracks or tampering with restricted areas. Climate control is also ensured since the four terminal stations are directly connected to the airport. Trains are operated with either two or three cars depending on the expected load,http://www.flychicago.com/ohare/ServicesAmenities/services/Pages/ATS.aspx and each car can hold 57 passengers, most of them standing, and 8 seated. Stations When available, ATS stations are fully accessible, and provide access to the elevated ATS tracks. The system has two tracks, and each train stops at all five stations traveling in both directions. Its west end is at Terminal 1, at the west end of the terminal core, and makes a counterclockwise loop around the parking garage, with stops at Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. Parking Garage A (the main garage) is accessible from any of the three terminal stations, as is the O'Hare terminal of the CTA's Blue Line. Parking Lots B and C are only accessible from Terminal 1 and 3 stations, respectively. Outside the terminal loop, the ATS travels east to Terminal 5, currently the airport's international terminal. It then turns north, crosses over the main access road and Blue Line, and reaches Parking Lot E. The station also features a Pace bus stop and a \\"Kiss 'n' Fly\\" drop-off area. A shuttle bus also connects this station with the O'Hare Transfer station on the North Central Service, providing Metra service to Union Station inbound and Antioch outbound during service hours.

Remaining members Chris Brokaw and Thalia Zedek recorded Near Life Experience with two different rhythm sections: one half of the album was recorded with drummer Mac McNeilly of the Jesus Lizard and Bundy K. Brown of Tortoise and Gastr Del Sol, the other half recorded with Kevin Coultas and Tara Jane O'Neil of Rodan and The Sonora Pine. Other contributors to the album included Edward Yazijian from Kustomized and Jeff Goddard from Karate, both rock bands hailing from Boston, MA. The title of the album resulted from \\"a slip of the tongue,\\" as Zedek states, she \\"was telling someone [she had] had a 'near life experience,' but meant to say near death experience. Chris [Brokaw] was cracking up at the imagery of that.\\" Thus, the phrase was chosen as the album's title.

The meeting took place under an observed truce with the purpose of negotiating the exchange of captives and ultimately facilitating peace after two years of war. The Comanches sought to obtain recognition of the boundaries of the Comancheria, their homeland, while the Texians wanted the release of Texian and Mexican citizens held prisoner by the Comanches. The council ended with 12 Comanche leaders shot to death inside the Council House, 23 others shot in the streets of San Antonio, and 30 taken captive. Online at Google Books The incident ended any chance for peace and led to years of further hostility and war. Background At the time, the Comanche people were not a unified Indian nation.The Comanche Barrier to South Plains Settlement: A Century and a Half of Savage Resistance to the Advancing White Frontier. Arthur H. Clarke Co. 1933. There were at least 12 divisions of the Comanche, with as many as 35 independent roaming bands,Comanche History and Bands also known as rancherías or villages. Although bound together in various ways, both cultural and political, the bands were not responsible to any formalized unified authority. The absence of a central authority meant that one band could not force another band to return their captives. Chiefs Buffalo Hump and Peta Nocona never agreed to return any captives to the Texian settlers. Captives were often assimilated into the society and adopted into families, and the Comanche made little distinction between people born Comanche and those adopted.Comanche The Comanche practice of taking captives dated back to at least the early 18th century with raids into Spanish New Mexico. On January 10, 1840, after several years of war and a major smallpox epidemic, three Comanche emissaries entered San Antonio and asked for peace, offering to send a large contingent of their leaders in 23 days to secure a new peace. They returned a white boy as a show of sincerity. Colonel Karnes received them, listened to their story, and agreed, but admonished them by saying that a lasting peace could be negotiated only when the Comanches gave up the Anglo captives that they held, estimated at thirteen.Anderson (200) p. 181 Albert Sidney Johnston, the Texas Secretary of War, had ordered San Antonio officials to take the Comanche delegates as hostages if they failed to deliver all captives. In March, Muguara, a powerful eastern Comanche chief, led 65 Comanches, including women and children, to San Antonio for peace talks. Killing of the peace delegates The Comanches arrived in San Antonio on March 19. Expecting a council of peace, the 12 chiefs brought women and children as well as warriors. They were dressed in finery with their faces painted.Noyes (1993), p. 281. The delegation had hoped to negotiate a recognition of the Comancheria as the sovereign land of the Comanche. Among the chiefs who did not attend were Buffalo Hump, the Comanche war chief who would lead the Great Raid of 1840 in retaliation for the killings, and the other two principal Penateka war chiefs, Yellow Wolf, his cousin and alter-ego, and Santa Anna Santa Anna, who sided with him in leading the Raid. The Comanche chiefs brought only one white captive to the meeting, as well as several Mexican children who had been captured separately. Muguara refused to deliver more captives on the grounds that they were held in the rancherías of other chiefs over which he had no authority. The white captive was Matilda Lockhart, a 16-year-old girl who had been held prisoner for over a year and a half. Mary Maverick, who helped care for the girl, wrote almost sixty years after the event that Lockhart had been beaten, raped and had suffered burns to her body. Allegedly, her face was severely disfigured, with her nose entirely burned away, a detail which has been commonly included in Texas history descriptions of the incident since the 1890s. Reports of abuse are, however, conspicuously missing in primary documents authored by eyewitnesses immediately after the event. Colonel Hugh McLeod did not mention any abuse in his report of March 20, 1840 (commenting on the intelligence of the girl but nothing like a missing nose), and neither did any other Texas officials at the time, nor Matilda Lockhart's own sister-in-law in a letter written to her mother shortly after the release. Anderson writes: \\"While published in the 1890s, this description has been used by historians to claim that the massacre came about as a result of the justifiable rage of Texas men. Yet none of the Texas officials claimed this to be the case at the time; evidence of abuse is conspicuously missing in the primary documents. Maverick may have exaggerated Lockhart's condition because of the growing criticism of Texas in the American and European Press. The most significant source on Matilda's condition is a brief statement made in a letter by her sister-in- law, Catherine Lockhart, who was in San Antonio. Catherine describes Matilda's release but says nothing of abuse.\\"Anderson (2005), p. 419 However, disfiguring a woman's nose was a widely recognized practice of the Comanches, even acknowledged by their apologists. Asked about the more than a dozen abducted whites expected to be available for release, Matilda informed the Texians that she knew only about a Mrs. Webster and her two children (who, unknown to her, had just made their escape) and that the Comanche chiefs had decided to ransom them. The Texians believed this was against the conditions for the negotiations, which they insisted had specified that all abducted whites had to be released before the council. The Comanche, of course, had a different view, since the chiefs and bands not in attendance were under no obligation to release anyone, as they had never agreed to a council.Anderson(2005) pp. 181 f. Because the delegation did not bring the expected number of captives, the members were taken to the local jail. The talks were held at the Council House, a one-story stone building adjoining the jail on the corner of Main Plaza and Calabosa (Market) Street.Brice (1987), p. 22. During the council, the Comanche warriors sat on the floor, as was their custom, while the Texians sat on chairs on a platform facing them. Lockhart had informed the Texians that she had seen 15 other prisoners at the Comanches' principal camp several days before. She reported the Indians had wanted to see how high a price they could get for her and, and based on that information, planned to bring in the remaining captives one at a time to maximize their return.Brice (1987), p. 23. The Texians demanded to know where the other captives were. The Penateka spokesman, Chief Muguara, responded that the other prisoners were held by various other bands of Comanche. He assured the Texians that he felt the other captives would be able to be ransomed, but that it would be in exchange for a great deal of supplies, including ammunition and blankets. He then finished his speech with the comment \\"How do you like that answer?\\"Noyes (1993), p. 282. The Texian militia entered the courtroom and positioned themselves at intervals along the walls.Noyes (1993), p. 283. When the Comanches would not, or could not, promise to return all captives immediately, the Texas officials said that the chiefs would be held hostage until the white captives were released. The interpreter warned the Texian officials that if he delivered this message the Comanches would attempt to escape by fighting. He was instructed to relay the message anyway and left the room as soon as he finished translating. After learning that they were being held hostage, the Comanches attempted to fight their way out of the Council House using arrows and knives. The Texian soldiers opened fire at point-blank range, killing both Indians and whites. The Comanche women and children waiting outdoors began shooting arrows at white people after hearing the commotion inside. At least one Texian spectator was killed. When a small number of warriors managed to escape from the Council House, all of the Comanche began to flee. The soldiers who pursued them again opened fire, killing and wounding both Comanche and Texians. Armed civilians also joined the battle but, claiming they could not always differentiate between warriors and women and children, since all of the Comanche were fighting, shot at them indiscriminately.Noyes (1993), p. 284. According to Anderson, such \\"confusion\\" between Native American men and women was convenient to the Texians, who used it as an excuse to kill women and children.Anderson (2005), pp. 181 f. The report by Col. Hugh McLeod written March 20, 1840 claimed that of the 65 members of the Comanches' party, 35 were killed (30 adult males, 3 women, and 2 children), 29 were taken prisoner (27 women and children, and 2 old men), and 1 departed unobserved (described as a renegade Mexican).Hugh McLeod's Report on the Council House Fight, March 1840 - Page 3 - Texas State Library Seven Texians died, including a judge, a sheriff, and an army lieutenant, with ten more wounded. A German surgeon surnamed Weidman helped to treat the citizens who had been wounded in the fight. Weidman was also a naturalist and had been assigned by the Tsar of Russia to make scientific observations about Texas and its inhabitants. Two days after the battle, San Antonio residents discovered that Weidman had decided to take the heads and bodies of two Indians to Russia. To obtain the skeletons, he had boiled the bodies in water, and dumped the resulting liquid into the San Antonio drinking water supply.Marks (1989), p. 92. Captives The day after the fight, a single Comanche woman was released to return to her camp and report that the Comanche prisoners would be released if the Comanche released the 15 Americans and several Mexicans who were known to be captives. They were given 12 days to return the captives. On March 26, a white woman, Mrs. John Webster, came into town with her three-year-old. She had been a Comanche captive for 19 months and had just escaped, leaving her 12-year-old son with the Indians.Marks (1989), p. 93. Two days later, a band of Indians returned to San Antonio.Marks (1989), p. 94. Leaving the bulk of the warriors outside the city, Chief Isanaica (Howling Wolf) and one other man rode into San Antonio and yelled insults. The citizens told him to go find the soldiers if he wanted a fight, but the garrison commander, Captain Redd, declared that he had to observe the 12-day truce. Redd invited the Indians to come back in three days, but, fearing a trap, Isanaica and his men left the area. Another officer accused Redd of cowardice for refusing to fight, and they both died following a duel over the insult.Noyes (1993), p. 285. Of the 16 hostages the Texians were determined to recover, 13 were tortured to death as soon as the news of the Council House Fight reached the outraged Comanches. The captives, including Matilda Lockhart's six-year-old sister, suffered slow roasting among other tortures. Only the three captives who had been adopted into the tribe, and by Comanche custom were truly part of the tribe, were spared. This was part of the Comanche answer to the breaking of a truce.Indian Wars Of Texas: The Council House Fight On April 3, when the truce deadline had ended, another band of Comanches appeared again to bargain for a captive exchange. They had only three captives with them, including Webster's son Booker, a five-year-old girl, and a Mexican boy. Booker told them that the other captives had been tortured and killed when the Comanche woman had returned to camp with news of the Council House Fight. These three captives were returned after their adoptive families agreed to give them up. The Comanche captives were moved from the city jail to the San Jose Mission, then to Camp Cooke at the head of the San Antonio River. Several were taken into people's homes to live and work, but ran away as soon as they could.Brice (1987), p. 26. Eventually, all of the Texians' Comanche captives escaped. Contemporary newspaper account The Texas Sentinel of March 24, 1840, gives an account of \\"a recent battle with the Comanches at San Antonio\\": Aftermath The Comanche were shocked by the actions of the Texians. In his book Los Comanches, historian Stanley Noyes notes that a \\"violation of a council represented an almost unthinkable degree of perfidy. The council was sacred not only to the [Comanche] People but to all Native Americans\\". In response, the captives the Texians sought were killed and Buffalo Hump launched the Great Raid of 1840, leading hundreds of Comanche warriors on raids against many Texian villages. The Texians, for their part, were shocked and disgusted by the actions of the barbaric Comanches in torturing to death the innocent captives. The Texians had endured several years of murder and capture of their children and were reportedly revolted at the condition of Matilda Lockhart upon her release.S.C. Gwynne, \\"Empire of the Summer Moon\\". At least 25 settlers were killed in the Great Raid, with others taken prisoner, including a Mrs. Crosby, a granddaughter of Daniel Boone, who was later murdered by her captors. Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of goods were taken; one city was burned to the ground and another damaged. The Texian militia responded, leading to the Battle of Plum Creek in August 1840, and ultimately stopped the raids.

Without proper resources and training, many countries around the world struggle to maintain books and manuscripts as part of their cultural history. Environmental conditions pose perhaps the greatest threat to these materials. Political instability also endangers library and museum collections. Recent contributions are helping to address specific needs and promote the development of preservation programs.  Overview  All library collections experience damage from use and decay from the aging process. Due to a variety of economic, historic, environmental and political factors, libraries and archival repositories in developing countries face exceptional challenges in book and manuscript preservation. Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East have been identified as areas with materials having critical need for preservation. Local librarians and archivists struggle to provide access for patrons while protecting the structural integrity of materials against damage from over-use, neglect, and extreme climate conditions. This is especially difficult as print materials in developing countries are often created using fragile, non-lasting paper product and ink. Providing information and education about preservation practices and principles is becoming an increasing focus for professionals working in countries with established practices. Going back to at least the year 2000, efforts have been made to establish a decision matrix and guidelines for preservation workers in developing countries to use in implementing preservation and conservation programs. Efforts to improve preservation in developing countries In August 1985, John F. Dean became Cornell University Library's first preservation and conservation librarian. Dean's efforts helped the Department of Preservation and Conservation at Cornell to grow into one of the leading programs of its kind in the United States., Cornell University: The Department of Preservation and Conservation Outline of Development, 1992. Aside from his work at Cornell, Dean has made important contributions towards improving preservation efforts in developing countries. He has created online tutorials for library conservation and preservation in Southeast Asia and Iraq and the Middle East. The tutorials are designed so that librarians and archivists in these and other countries have a set of basic guidelines to refer to when dealing with preservation issues. Specific topics addressed in the tutorials include \\"Management and Planning\\", \\"Preservation\\", \\"Building Capacity\\" and \\"Supporting the Effort\\". Both tutorials are available in English; the tutorial for Iraq and the Middle East is also available in Arabic. Area specific problems and actions India The advancement of technology and IT professions in India has resulted in a large number of digital library projects across the country. The main problem these initiatives are running into are access and copyright laws. Puerto Rico Munoz-Sola points out the impracticality of mounting modern environmental controls in a library to stabilize temperature and humidity in the balmy Puerto Rican climate. The expense involved in creating an ideal environment in both energy and manpower would counteract positive outcomes for the condition of collections. Puerto Rico also has an additional concern with preservation: due to political instability in the past, many libraries and collections have been destroyed, which places a greater need on preserving what is left. Munoz-Sola also points out that many developing countries are in tropical climates, and thus face these problems. Ukraine and Bulgaria Conservators at the Ukraine V. Stefanyk Scientific Library of the National Academy of Sciences make the effort to adapt advanced preservation techniques to their home area by hiring local craftsmen to manufacture necessary tools and equipment. This library has a well-established conservation program, with staff trained at workshops in Europe. The L’viv National University Library in Bulgaria received enough funds from their government to build a new facility to house extra collections and offices. However the new building, with its brand new heating system has caused the collections to deteriorate much more rapidly than those collections stored in the main building which has thick stone walls and a naturally occurring stable environment. These countries are coping with the transition from being under Soviet rule to self-governing states.

The craft is approximately 14.5 feet in length, with a 4.5 foot beam. The sail is a Marconi rig (aka Bermuda rig), with the mast far forward on the hull, as is the norm for a cat boat. The boat has a retractable galvanized steel centerboard, and a shallow-draft aluminum rudder similar in shape to New England-style cat boats. The design was created by Norm Bell and John Larimore in the mid-1950s and used then-current polyester resin and fiberglass construction techniques. The boat was perhaps over-engineered, and is quite robustly built. Many examples, including hull #2 (the second production boat) continue to race every Saturday during the summer months. There were 250+ Inland Cats built by Bell/Larimore and a nearby boatbuilder in the 1950s thru early 1970s. The only concentration of boats is on Lake George proper, which has a few dozen surviving craft. Of these, 20+ come out to race in the \\"Gold\\" and \\"Silver\\" fleets each week during the Summer. Due to its heavy construction and wide beam, the Inland Cat is very stable in heavy air, and not particularly fast. The class has a PHRF rating of 107. It is not uncommon on balmy summer days to see the entire fleet bobbing in light air, tossed about by Jet Ski and other boat wakes.

Early Crusaders have tall, square-cornered or gasket side windows and a shallow roofline, similar to their predecessor. Most had a double-curvature windscreen. Following the construction of one prototype and a demonstrator, the first production batch of Crusaders, on B6LE chassis, were delivered to Mainline in October 1995.

Second generation (1999–2002) The second generation Crusader, known as the Crusader 2, was introduced in 1999 on Volvo B6BLE chassis, the successor to the B6LE. In contrast to early first generation Crusaders, all Crusader 2s have shallower windows with a deeper panel above, bringing them in line with other Wrightbus designs like the Endurance and Pathfinder; some of the later built first generation Crusaders shared this characteristic however, making the two designs indistinguishable except for the different chassis.

She covers Germany as well as the rest of Europe for CNN. Before her promotion she was based in London. Prior to working for CNN, she was a correspondent for The Washington Post and The New Zealand Herald in Indonesia as she speaks both English and Indonesian fluently. She is a graduate of the Class of 1991 of Jakarta International School. She is an Economics graduate of Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. She gave birth to a son in 2009. Career Shubert started her career with CNN as a producer in Jakarta, Indonesia, where she covered the fall of Indonesia’s President Suharto in 1998, East Timor’s transition to independence in 1999. Shubert joined CNN as a reporter for CNN's Jakarta bureau, and was appointed to the position of Tokyo correspondent in 2004. During her time reporting from Tokyo, Shubert covered a number of major news stories in Japan, including the controversial deployment of Japan's Self- Defense Forces, the Japanese hostage situation in Iraq and the verdict of Shoko Asahara (the mastermind behind the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo). In the summer of 2005, Shubert reported live from Hiroshima on the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the 1945 atomic bombing for CNN's special Remembering Hiroshima. She also reported on the nuclear tensions in the Korean Peninsula in 2006, after North Korea tested nuclear weapons. CNN claims that Shubert was one of the first CNN correspondents to report on the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and resulting tsunami, reporting from Aceh, Indonesia, where she was vacationing at the time. Also in Indonesia, Shubert covered a number of major new events that included the 2002 Bali bombings, the fall of Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid and the inauguration of President Megawati Sukarnoputri, East Timor's transition to independence, the resurgence of the Free Aceh separatist movement, the religious conflict in Ambon City and the fall of former Indonesian President Suharto and resulting reform movement. Shubert also briefly covered the Schapelle Corby verdict in Bali; however, due to the time consuming and overall expensive nature of this landmark court case, CNN eventually opted to run stock footage obtained from its Australian network affiliates instead of direct reporting. Shubert has also contributed reports from the Philippines and Singapore. From 2008 until 2015 Shubert was based in the CNN London bureau covering stories from around the UK and Europe. She relocated to Berlin in June 2015 to cover Germany and Europe.  Interview with Julian Assange  In October, 2010, Shubert interviewed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange shortly after his organization released classified US military documents related to the Iraq War. After asking him questions about internal issues related to Wikileaks itself, she began asking questions about his alleged sexual assaults. Assange stated that if this line of questioning continued, as opposed to being asked questions directly related to the leaked documents, he would leave the interview. Shubert persisted in her line of questioning, and Assange walked out of the interview.

The easternmost segment of the route in New Jersey runs from the Commodore Barry Bridge over the Delaware River in Logan Township, Gloucester County, where it continues southeast to Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City, Atlantic County. The portion of the route between the Commodore Barry Bridge and Route 42 is mostly a two-lane undivided road that is concurrently signed with County Route 536, passing through Mullica Hill and Glassboro. From Williamstown, US 322 follows the Black Horse Pike, a four-lane road, southeast to Atlantic City. In Hamilton Township, Atlantic County, US 322 forms a concurrency with U.S. Route 40, continuing with that route all the way to Atlantic City. US 322 intersects several major roads including U.S. Route 130 and Interstate 295 in Logan Township, the New Jersey Turnpike in Woolwich Township, Route 55 in Harrison Township, Route 42 in Williamstown, Route 50 and U.S. Route 40 in Hamilton Township, the Garden State Parkway in Egg Harbor Township, and U.S. Route 9 in Pleasantville. East of Williamstown, US 322 follows the Black Horse Pike, a turnpike between Camden and Atlantic City that was created in 1855. Pre-1927 Route 18S was designated along the portion of the current route east of McKee City in 1923, with the US 40 designation along this portion following in 1926. In 1927, Route 18S became Route 48 and Route 42 was designated along the road between Williamstown and McKee City. US 322 was extended to New Jersey in 1936, running from a ferry dock on the Delaware River in Bridgeport east to Williamstown, where it followed Route 42 and U.S. Route 40/Route 48 to Atlantic City. In 1938, Route 55 was legislated along US 40/US 322 in Atlantic City while in 1939, US 322 between the ferry dock and Route 44 (now US 130) became Route S44 and the route between there and Route 42 became Route 51. In 1953, the state highway designations were removed from US 322. After the Commodore Barry Bridge opened in 1974, the old approach to the ferry dock became Route 324. In 1960, a freeway was proposed for US 322 in Gloucester County, running from the site of the Commodore Barry Bridge to Williamstown. This $59.6 million proposal was canceled by the 1970s due to diversion of funds to mass transit. Subsequent proposals for freeways in 1983 and 1995 also failed. A bypass of Mullica Hill was completed in 2012 for US 322 in order to relieve traffic through that town; the former alignment is now unsigned U.S. Route 322 Business (US 322 Bus.).  Route description   Gloucester County  US 322 enters New Jersey from Chester, Pennsylvania on the Commodore Barry Bridge over the Delaware River. Upon entering New Jersey, the highway runs concurrently with County Route 536. The road heads southeast into swampy areas of Logan Township as a five-lane road maintained by the Delaware River Port Authority, eventually becoming a six-lane divided highway as it passes over the access road to Route 324 and comes to the westbound toll plaza for the bridge. A short distance later, US 322 has a cloverleaf interchange with U.S. Route 130 and continues south through the community of Bridgeport as it narrows into a two-lane undivided road known as Swedesboro-Bridgeport Road. It passes over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Penns Grove Secondary and continues through rural areas of farms and woods prior to an interchange with Interstate 295, at which point the road widens into a four-lane divided highway. After I-295, US 322 continues through a small industrial park, and then makes a turn to the east and crosses into Woolwich Township. At this point, the road narrows back into a two-lane undivided road with no name. Here, the route crosses the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Salem Branch and County Route 551 prior to an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike. View east along US 322 at Rowan Boulevard in Glassboro Past the New Jersey Turnpike, US 322 starts to curve southeast and crosses into Harrison Township, where it passes suburban neighborhoods as Bridgeport-Mullica Hill Road and jurisdiction of the road is transferred to Gloucester County. It continues into Mullica Hill, where it intersects Route 45 and unsigned US 322 Bus. At this point, CR 536 turns south along with US 322 Bus./Route 45 and US 322 heads along the Mullica Hill Bypass concurrent with unsigned CR 536A, running southeast through wooded areas with some farm fields. At the end of the bypass, the route intersects US 322 Bus./CR 536 again and turns east onto Mullica Hill Road, again becoming concurrent with CR 536. US 322 continues through a mix of woods, farms, and homes, passing through Richwood. The route interchanges with Route 55 where state jurisdiction resumes. At the interchange, US 322 is briefly a four-lane road, before entering Glassboro. In Glassboro, the route passes residential areas prior to crossing Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Vineland Secondary and bisecting the campus of Rowan University, where it comes to a roundabout at Rowan Boulevard. A short distance later, US 322 crosses County Route 553 and becomes West Street, before coming to Route 47. Here, it turns south to form a concurrency with that route on three-lane Delsea Drive, passing more homes and businesses. US 322 splits from Route 47 by heading east on High Street, a two-lane road, and enters wooded areas with some development and farmland. After exiting Glassboro for Monroe Township, US 322 continues east and crosses County Route 555 prior to reaching Williamstown, where the road passes residential and business development. Here, US 322 turns north, while County Route 536 splits from the route by continuing southeast on Main Street. A short distance after the split, US 322 intersects Route 42 (Black Horse Pike) and turns southeast onto it. At this intersection, County Route 536 Spur continues to the north. On the Black Horse Pike, a four-lane divided highway line with businesses, the route soon crosses County Route 536 before leaving the Williamstown area and becoming a four-lane undivided road. US 322 continues southeast through predominantly forested areas with occasional development, intersecting County Route 538 and crossing the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Southern Running Track line. In 2006, an average of 10,615 vehicles used the road daily in Gloucester County.  Atlantic County  US 322 eastbound in Folsom Entering Folsom in Atlantic County, US 322 passes a couple lakes and some wooded residences before coming to a bridge over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Beesleys Point Secondary before an interchange with Route 54, where the route has a median. Past this interchange, the road continues southeast through heavily forested areas to an intersection with the southern terminus of Route 73 (signed as County Route 561 Spur). After this intersection, US 322 turns south and enters Hamilton Township, where it encounters County Route 559 at a traffic circle that has been modified to have US 322 run through it. After passing more woods and a clearing for farms, the road widens into a four-lane divided highway and has an interchange with Route 50. A short while after, the route enters a residential and commercial area, passing by Atlantic Cape Community College before heading to the south of the Hamilton Mall. Here, US 322 intersects U.S. Route 40, which merges onto the Black Horse Pike. US 40/US 322 westbound in Egg Harbor Township The two routes continue to the southeast through business areas, meeting County Route 575 and a ramp to the Atlantic City Expressway. CR 575 turns east to form a concurrency with US 40/US 322. The road enters Egg Harbor Township, with CR 575 splitting from US 40/US 322 by turning to the south. The route passes more wooded residential and commercial areas, as well as the Storybook Land amusement park, before intersecting County Route 563. US 40/US 322 forms a concurrency with that route and passes through a business district that includes the Harbor Square shopping center. CR 563 splits from the road by continuing southeast and the Black Horse Pike heads east to an interchange with the Garden State Parkway. The only direct ramp present is between the Black Horse Pike westbound and the Garden State Parkway northbound, with all other movements provided by CR 563. Past here, US 40/US 322 continues east past more businesses, crossing County Route 651 before entering Pleasantville. In Pleasantville, the road crosses U.S. Route 9, where the name changes to Verona Avenue. Upon crossing County Route 585, the Black Horse Pike continues past residences as an undivided road, crossing back into Egg Harbor Township. The road passes more businesses, closely paralleling the Atlantic City Expressway before entering Atlantic City. Here, the name becomes Albany Avenue and it comes to a pair of ramps that provide access to and from the Black Horse Pike eastbound and the Atlantic City Expressway westbound. US 40/US 322 enters marshland, crossing the Great Thorofare onto Great Island before passing over the Beach Thorofare. Past this bridge, the road passes between businesses to the west and the closed Bader Field airport and Surf Stadium to the east. US 40/US 322 crosses the Inside Thorofare on a drawbridge and continues as a county maintained road to its end at Atlantic Avenue and Pacific Avenue, one block from the boardwalk. In 2006, an average of 6,910 vehicles used the road daily in Atlantic County.  History   Before 1953  The former Route 42 designation of the Black Horse Pike shown on the Route 54 bridge in Folsom.What is now U.S. Route 322 east of the Route 42 junction was established in 1855 as the Black Horse Pike, a turnpike that ran from Camden to Atlantic City via Blackwoodtown. In 1902, the Atlantic County Board of Freeholders authorized the construction of a toll-free highway from Pleasantville to Albany Avenue in Atlantic City, which was completed in 1905. In 1923, the portion of present US 322 along the US 40 concurrency was designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 18S, a route that was built to connect Penns Grove to Atlantic City. As a result of the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, U.S. Route 40 was also signed along the alignment Route 18S. A year later, in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the current alignment of US 322 through New Jersey was designated as a part of Route 42 between Williamstown and McKee City, while Route 48 replaced the Route 18S designation along the portion between McKee City and Atlantic City.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. The portion of US 40/US 322 in Atlantic City was legislated as Route 55 in 1938.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1938, Chapter 283. Route 51 (1939-1953)In 1936, US 322 was extended into New Jersey, running from a ferry dock on the Delaware River in Bridgeport and continuing east from there through Mullica Hill and Glassboro to Williamstown, where it followed Route 42 to McKee City and U.S. Route 40/Route 48 to Atlantic City. In 1939, the portion of US 322 between the ferry dock and Route 44 (now U.S. Route 130) was legislated as Route S44, a spur of Route 44, while the route between there and Route 42 in Williamstown was legislated as Route 51.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1939, compiled. It is also this section between Bridgeport and Williamstown that was not in state highway jurisdiction at the time.  1953 to present  In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, several state highways concurrent with US 322 were removed, including Route S44, Route 51, Route 42, Route 48, and Route 55. The section of US 322 between former US 130 and Route 42 became state highway jurisdiction in 1955 after a state takeover. This portion was also designated as part of County Route 536 with the creation of the 500-series county routes in 1952. When the Commodore Barry Bridge opened in 1974 and replaced the ferry across the Delaware River, US 322 was moved to the new bridge approach and the former piece of the route to the ferry dock became Route 324. US 322 eastbound at the east end of the Mullica Hill Bypass, where it intersects the eastern terminus of unsigned US 322 Bus. In the 1960s, plans started forming for a freeway along the US 322 corridor in Gloucester County. A parkway had been planned in 1932 to run from Bridgeport east to the planned Camden-Atlantic City Parkway as part of a network of such roads proposed for the Philadelphia area; however, it was never built. The freeway, which was planned to connect the then-proposed Commodore Barry Bridge to Route 42 in Williamstown, was projected to cost $59.6 million. This freeway was proposed to be incorporated into the Interstate Highway System in 1970; however, this was denied. By the end of the 1970s, the US 322 freeway was canceled due to the desire to use highway funds for mass transit. However, plans resurfaced for a freeway along the US 322 corridor in 1987, when Congressman William J. Hughes made a proposal for a road running from the New Jersey Turnpike to the Atlantic City Expressway, with access to the Route 55 freeway. This proposal was never built though. In 1995, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority planned to build a toll road between the Commodore Barry Bridge and the Atlantic City Expressway, connecting with I-295, the New Jersey Turnpike, and Route 55. This proposal resulted from increased traffic volume on US 322 after the completion of Interstate 476 in Pennsylvania. However, this proposal was soon canceled due to the possible destruction it would cause to residences, businesses, and the environment. The Cardiff Circle along US 40/US 322 at CR 563 and CR 608 in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $3.7 million project completed in 2002. In December 2008, jurisdiction of US 322 from the Woolwich–Harrison township line to the Route 55 interchange and a segment within Glassboro was transferred from the state highway agency, the New Jersey Department of Transportation, to Gloucester County. Construction of a bypass around Mullica Hill began in December 2010 in order to relieve severe traffic congestion through the town. The route originally went through the town's historical district, where it briefly joined Route 45. The new alignment removes the concurrency, so that the routes merely cross at an intersection. The road was estimated to cost $12 million, and is described by a freeholder as being the \\"largest infrastructure project that has ever been undertaken in Gloucester County.\\" In addition to the bypass, a portion of US 322 in the Mullica Hill area was widened. Construction of the bypass portion initially awaited approval from the New Jersey Historical Sites Council to determine if it would impact the Mullica Hill Historic District. The Mullica Hill Bypass opened to traffic on January 11, 2012. With the rerouting of US 322 onto the Mullica Hill Bypass, the former alignment of US 322 to Mullica Hill is now US 322 Bus., which is unsigned.

The team was founded in 1979 by head coach Edward G. Brosky, a member of the Pittsburgh Panthers 1976 national championship team. The Colts initial run lasted from 1979 until 1987, when the team took a four-year hiatus. In 1981, the team advanced to the national championship game located in San Francisco, to play against the Twin City Cougars, who later became the Oakland Invaders of the United States Football League. The team also briefly disbanded after the 2000 season due its board of directors and coaching staff have become the ownership group of the Pittsburgh Ironmen, a new professional indoor football team set to begin competing in February 2001. Brosky also played as a semi-pro football player while playing college football, until then-Panthers coach Johnny Majors found out and ended Brosky's moonlighting. When he left Pitt, Brosky continued to play for semi-pro teams in the area. He started the Colts when those other teams folded. Since 1979, Brosky has either played for or coached the Colts. In 2004 Lisa Horton became the first woman to throw a touchdown pass in a North America Football League game The Colts are part of the Pennsylvania Football League (PFL). History The Colts were founded in 1979 by owner and coach Edward G. Brosky. At the time the Colts played in the Keystone Oaks area. The team was a member of the professional American Football Association in that league's final 1983 season. From 1988-1996 the Colts played in Stonefield Northpark and from 1997-2000 played in Duquesne. Recent Locations include, Uniontown, Chartiers Valley and Carlynton. The Colts were previously members of the American, North American Football League, and Regional American Football League before Edward Brosky formed the Grassroots Football League in 2009. The Colts played in the Semi-Pro Football League from 2010-2014 before joining the Gridiron Developmental Football League for the 2015 season. They also played at Chartiers Valley for the 2015 season. In the mid-1990s, Brosky struck a deal with the Northgate School District. It was during this time that two notables were linked with the team; WTAE-TV field reporter Sheldon Ingram played in the defensive backfield while future music video director Matt Dilmore served as the team's official announcer. The Colts draw talent from the area high schools and local colleges including: Allegheny College, Bethany College, California University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University, Duquesne University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh, Robert Morris College, Slippery Rock University, Washington & Jefferson College, and James Madison University in Virginia. The Colts describe themselves as a \\"throwback team\\" based on a strong work ethic and personal values. The team has been in several communities throughout its history. Most recently the team played at Ambridge High School. The Colts have interacted with the community they are in through numerous youth activities, visiting children's hospital, and having community events downtown. 2007-2009 2007 season The Colts played the 2007 season at two fields: Robert Morris University and Moon Stadium Home Game Dates:June 16( Home opener vs. North Coast Vikings), June 23, July 7, July 14, July 28, August 11.

The passport is issued by the Ministry of Interior or, if the citizen resides abroad, at the embassy. Besides serving as proof of identity and of citizenship, they facilitate the process of securing assistance from Montenegrin consular officials abroad, if needed. Citizens can not have multiple passports at the same time, unless they are of different category. History The first passports issued in Montenegro are from the 18th century, by Prince-Bishop Vasilije III Petrović- Njegoš. After Vasilije ethnicity was never a part of Montenegrin passports again. During the reign of Prince-Bishop Petar I Petrović-Njegoš, a special document known as \\"Passport\\" () was granted to the citizens who wanted extraordinarily to visit foreign countries. During the reign of Prince-Bishop Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, he was granting a special Montenegrin Bill of Passage. From then on, next to every user of the bill and subsequent passports, \\"Montenegrin\\" was added, relating to the country of his or her birth. It also introduced the notification from which clan is the individual. Later, Njegos formally instituted as the official name \\"Montenegrin Passport\\".http://www.njegos.org/passports/pasos1.jpg A component part of it was the Seal of the Cetinje Metropolitanate's Righteous Soviet, a bicephalic white eagle with spread-out wings, an Eastern Orthodox cross between his heads and a passing lion beneath it, altogether on red background. With the secularization of Montenegro as a formal Princedom under Prince Danilo I Petrovic-Njegos, religious affiliation and even physical description of the passport holder were introduced as of the mid 19th century, in attempt to prevent fraud.http://www.njegos.org/passports/pasos3.jpg The Seal was replaced with Danil's Coat of Arms, the lion was moved onto a red shield on the eagle's chest, while an Imperial crown was added. The passports issued by Nikola I Petrovic-Njegos were significantly changed in appearance, also losing any reference to nationality.http://www.njegos.org/passports/pasos4.jpg The same were the unrecognized passports published by the Montenegrin Government in Exile in 1919, after the country's annexation by Serbia. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, passports were issued in order with the \\"Law on Travel Documents of Yugoslav Nationals\\" which came into force on 26 July 1996, although the country came into existence in 1992. They were navy blue in color and have two inscriptions in golden letters - Савезна Република Југославија (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) at the top and the word passport written in three languages: Serbian (Cyrillic script), English and French at the bottom divided by the coat of arms. Following the restructuring of the FRY into the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, passports with the new name were not issued due to the expected breakup of the union, which eventually happened in 2006. Following Montenegro's independence, citizens of Montenegro used the same travel document as Serbia until 2008, the only difference being in issuing authority, in this case, the Ministry of Interior of Montenegro. On 30 November 2006, the Government adopted the Memorandum of Agreement between the Republic of Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia on Consular Protection and Services to the Citizens of Montenegro. By this agreement, Serbia, through its network of diplomatic and consular missions, provides consular services to the Montenegrin citizens on the territory of states in which Montenegro has no missions of its own. On 1 January 2010, the Government officially invalidated all non-biometric Montenegrin passports, even if the expiry date was beyond 1 January 2010. Because non-biometric Montenegrin passports were no longer considered valid travel documents from that date onwards, holders were obliged to apply for new biometric Montenegrin passports in order to travel.INVALIDATED PASSPORTS, EFFECTIVE 1 JANUARY 2010 Appearance Design The current passports are burgundy-red with the Montenegrin coat of arms. The data page is printed in Montenegrin, English and French. Unlike the passports issued through history of Montenegro, which used both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, the current Montenegrin passport uses the Latin alphabet exclusively. Identity information page The passport includes the following data: *Country code ('MNE' for Montenegro) *Nationality ('MNE' for Montenegrin ) *Type ('P' for passport) *Passport serial number *Name of bearer *Place of birth *Date of birth (DD.MM.YYYY.) *Sex *National identity number (JMBG) *Date of issue (DD.MM.YYYY.) *Date of expiry (DD.MM.YYYY.) *Issuing office (Ministry of Interior of Montenegro) *Signature and photo of bearer The information page ends with the Machine Readable Zone and the identity page also contains the RFID chip. Languages The data page is printed in Montenegrin, English and French, while the personal data is entered in Montenegrin. Types Passports that can be issued are: *Ordinary passport is issued to all citizens. :* Valid for 10 years *Collective passport is issued to groups traveling together. :* Valid for a single trip abroad. :* Though it is not primary means of international travel for organised groups, it is often used to facilitate the issuance of visas or to decrease administrative costs if a lot of group members do not have their individual passports. Main users of these passports are high schools and tourist agencies. :* Collective passport can be used for travel only to specific, usually nearby, countries. Some countries that do not accept collective passport as valid travel ID, do issue collective visas, but still stamp individual passports. :* All members of the group must cross the border at the same time and be part of the same organized trip. *Diplomatic passport is issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to diplomats, high-ranking officials, members of the Parliament and persons traveling on official state business, and in some cases to immediate family members of the above. :* Validity is determined by the nature of the position held - diplomats and officials will usually receive the passport covering their mandate in office. *Official passport is identical in all aspects to the diplomatic passport, but lacks the privileges of diplomatic immunity. It is issued to mid and low- ranking officials, as well as to non-diplomatic staff at the embassies and consulates.  Visa requirement for Montenegrin citizens  Visa-free travel for Montenegrin citizens As of 1 January 2017, Montenegrin citizens had visa- free or visa on arrival access to 107 countries and territories, ranking the Montenegrin passport 50th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Colombian passport) according to the Henley visa restrictions index.

In the United States, a power hour event is often associated with a person's 21st birthday when they reach the legal drinking age. Consequences Players may have difficulty completing the specified number of drinks as the rate of consumption can raise their blood alcohol content to high levels. The rate of alcohol consumption makes the players intoxicated within a short period of time.  Variations  The power hour is originally 60 minutes in length, but a Centurion is 100 minutes long. The game is usually played using a minute long song playlist. Therefore, one shot should be taken per song. Another way to play is with a minute-timer. The game could be composed of liquor by taking a shot every 10 minutes. There is another version of a power hour called a Blitzkrieg Power Hour, where the round length successively decreases by one second each round.

Bloch killed three of his family members, for which he was institutionalized in a mental asylum for 31 years, during which all of his mathematical output was produced.  Early life  Bloch was born in 1893 in Besançon, France. According to one of his teachers, Georges Valiron, both André Bloch and his younger brother Georges were in the same class in October 1910. Valiron believed Georges to have the better talent, and due to lack of preparation, André finished last in the class. André was spared from failing the class by convincing Ernest Vessiot to give him an oral exam. The exam convinced Vessiot of Andre's talent and both André and Georges entered the École Polytechnique.G. Valiron, Des Théorèmes de Bloch aux Théories d'Ahlfors, Bulletin des Sciences Mathematiques 73 (1949) 152–162.D. Campbell, Beauty and the beast: The strange case of André Bloch, The Mathematical Intelligencer 7 (1985) 36–38. Both brothers served for a year in the military prior to World War I. Both André and Georges studied for only one year at the École Polytechnique before the outbreak of the war.  World War I  Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, André and Georges Bloch were drafted. André, as a second-lieutenant in the artillery, was assigned to the headquarters of General De Castelnau in Nancy. Both Bloch brothers were injured: André suffered from a fall from an observation post, while Georges sustained a head wound which cost him an eye. Georges was released from service and returned to the École Polytechnique on 7 October 1917. André, however, was allowed to convalesce but not released from duty.  Murder  On 17 November 1917, while on convalescent leave from service in World War I, Bloch killed his brother Georges, and his aunt and uncle. Several conjectures about the motives for Bloch's crime exist among mathematicians.See the article by Campbell for several anecdotal examples. Henri Cartan and Jacqueline Ferrand note that \\"certain of these conjectures are outrageously eccentric\\". Steven G. Krantz (\\"Mathematical Apocrypha: Stories and Anecdotes of Mathematicians and the Mathematical\\", American Mathematical Society, 2002) also lists some conjectures. However, Cartan and Ferrand quote Henri Baruk, who was the medical head of the asylum where Bloch was confined. Bloch told Baruk that the murders were a eugenic act, in order to eliminate branches of his family affected by mental illness.  Commitment and mathematical career  After the murders, Bloch was committed to the asylum at Charenton in Saint Maurice, a suburb of Paris. Bloch continued his mathematical career while confined. All of his publications, including those relating to Bloch's constant, were written while he was committed. Bloch corresponded with several mathematicians, including Georges Valiron, George Pólya, Jacques Hadamard and others, giving his return address as only \\"57 Grande rue, Saint-Maurice\\", never mentioning that this was a psychiatric hospital. Several of his correspondents were thus unaware of his situation. During the German occupation of France, Bloch (who was Jewish) wrote under aliases, in order to avoid advertising his presence to Nazi occupiers. In particular, Bloch is known to have authored papers under the names of René Binaud and Marcel Segond during this time. According to Pólya, Bloch had the habit of dating his letters with 1 April, regardless of when they were written. Bloch was transferred to the Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris on 21 August 1948 for an operation. He died from leukemia in Paris on 11 October 1948. Mathematical work Most important works of Bloch belong to complex analysis. His early contribution is known as Bloch's theorem. This theorem asserts the existence of certain absolute constant which is called the Bloch constant. The exact value of the Bloch constant is still unknown . Research originating from this theorem led to introduction of Bloch's functions which form the so-called Bloch space. (This usage should not be confused with Bloch's functions of Swiss physicist Felix Bloch.) Bloch formulated two important philosophical principles which proved to be useful in research in complex analysis. The more famous of these two is the so-called Bloch's principle. In Bloch's own words it is formulated (in Latin) as follows: \\"Nihil est in infinito quod non prius fuerit in finito\\". Guided by this principle, Bloch was able to discover several important facts which were later proved by other mathematicians, for example, the five-island theorem. There is an intensive current research related to Bloch's principle. Bloch's ideas stimulated much of the research on holomorphic curves in the 20th century and remain central in this subfield. He stated a fundamental theorem on holomorphic curves in complex manifolds whose irregularity exceeds dimension. (This can be considered as a deep and far- reaching generalization of Picard's theorem.) His proof of this theorem contained gaps (which he recognized), and later the theorem was known as \\"Bloch's conjecture\\". Bloch's conjecture, as stated was proved by Takushiro Ochiai, Pit Man Wong and simultaneously by Yujiro Kawamata in 1980, and the related research started a new area which is called holomorphic curves in Abelian varieties (and semi-Abelian varieties). Bloch was the first (jointly with Pólya) to consider the distribution of roots of random polynomials, which is another area of research which is intensively developing since the middle of 20th century.

For ceramics and other brittle materials, the maximum stress that a sample can be measured to withstand before failure may vary from specimen to specimen, even under identical testing conditions. This is related to the distribution of physical flaws present in the surface or body of the brittle specimen, since brittle failure processes originate at these weak points. When flaws are consistent and evenly distributed, samples will behave more uniformly than when flaws are clustered inconsistently. This must be taken into account when describing the strength of the material, so strength is best represented as a distribution of values rather than as one specific value. The Weibull modulus is a shape parameter for the Weibull distribution model which, in this case, maps the probability of failure of a component at varying stresses. Consider strength measurements made on many small samples of a brittle ceramic material. If the measurements show little variation from sample to sample, the calculated Weibull modulus will be high and a single strength value would serve as a good description of the sample-to-sample performance. It may be concluded that its physical flaws, whether inherent to the material itself or resulting from the manufacturing process, are distributed uniformly throughout the material. If the measurements show high variation, the calculated Weibull modulus will be low; this reveals that flaws are clustered inconsistently and the measured strength will be generally weak and variable. Products made from components of low Weibull modulus will exhibit low reliability and their strengths will be broadly distributed. Test procedures for determining the Weibull modulus are specified in DIN EN 843-5 and DIN 51 110-3. A further method to determine the strength of brittle materials has been described by the Wikibook contribution Weakest link determination by use of three parameter Weibull statistics. Definition If the probability distribution of the strength, X, is a Weibull distribution with its density given by :f(x; x_0,\\\\lambda,k) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{k}{\\\\lambda}\\\\left(\\\\frac{x-x_0}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^{k-1}e^{-((x-x_0)/\\\\lambda)^{k}} & x\\\\geq x_0 ,\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & x< x_0 ,\\\\end{cases} then k is the Weibull modulus. The value of k shows the kind of failure being experienced. If k<1, then the failure rate decreases with time. This implies that the weak and defective parts fail in the beginning, with the harder sections surviving. If k=1, the rate of failure remains constant. This implies that there is random failure occurring. Thus, there should be some external factor strong enough to cause random failure irrespective of whether the section is strong or weak. If the value of k>1, the rate of failure increases over time. This points to some kind of ageing process, the weakening of the material with the passage of time. References *Afferrante L. et al.

Brontosaurus was founded in 1974, being the first such an organization in Czechoslovakia. It was named after Brontosaurus, name which was at the time widely used as a synonym for dinosaur among the Czechs. The chosen name was to remind the fate of dinosaurs, which died out during the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The founders were several young enthusiasts from the Institute of Landscape Ecology of Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. Their preparations had started in 1972. The plan was covered in a popular journal for the youth, Mladý Svět, whose illustrator Vladimír Jiránek sketched the logo. In January 1974 \\"Akce Brontosaurus\\" (Action Brontosaurus) started as a batch of ten tasks concentrated on environment education and to be finished within one year. Unexpected success led to an indefinite extension of the programme and appearance of regional branches. Since 1978 Mladý Svět adopted it under name \\"Holidays with Brontosaurus\\" (Prázdniny s Brontosaurem), massively adding to its popularity. In the same year Brontosaurus had to become a collective member of Socialist Union of Youth, a pro-regime political organization aiming to completely cater the youth population. Brontosaurus had organized numerous festivals, propagation tours and competitions and has managed to increase awareness about the numerous ecological problems. After the fall of communist party from power in 1989 Brontosaurus became independent organization and restructured internally. The organization decided to concentrate on free time activities and education and avoid involvement in politics so popular among the other environmental groups in the Czech Republic. In 1992 a group of members left and set up independent \\"Asociace Brontosaura\\" (Association Brontosaurus). In 1996 a conflict between two groups within Brontosaurus almost broke it down; discovery of embezzlement further worsened the situation. The conflict got largely resolved during Autumn 1999 - 2000 but the organization was financially ruined (another embezzlement by a former leader was discovered). The government stepped in providing over 80% of its budget in 2001. As of 2007 Hnutí Brontosaurus has around 1,000 members structured into 30 local groups. Concentrating on children and the youth, they organize weekend trips, summer camps, illustrated humour competition \\"Ekofór\\", education tour and courses and also ecological consultations. Budget in 2005 was around 1.6 million of CZK. About two thirds of the income came as grants by the government and municipalities, about one third was profit from business activities.

In 1995, he was invited by Radio Maryja (a well- known Catholic radio station) to tell the listeners about his experience with alcohol-free weddings. Listeners from all Poland were calling the radio station to say that alcohol-free weddings were organized by many individuals.

Folk groups from other regions appear occasionally as well like from Kujawy, Kurpie, Radom area or Silesia. But also (former or current) pop stars come frequently to give concerts, for example Magda Anioł and her band, Antonina Krzysztoń, Viola Brzezińska with the 'New Day' group as well as Jarosław Wajk, a former vocalist of the \\"Oddział Zamknięty\\" rock band, and Jan Budziaszek of the Skaldowie band.  Alcohol-free weddings  A central reason for the Wedding of the Weddings event is the general resistance in Poland (and also in other countries) against weddings where no alcohol is served. To combat the feeling of being strangers to this culture and in Polish society, many of those couples seeking alcohol-free weddings also sought out other like-minded people with whom to socialize and celebrate. The non-alcoholic weddings differ from the ones where alcohol is served. The wedding ceremony is usually extended by the reading of a special blessing (and acknowledgement) from the local bishop. Through this, the wedding reception does not only become exceptional because of the absence of alcohol and everything associated with alcohol, but it is also marked by other traditions and attractions. As toasts in Poland are almost by definition associated with alcohol, they are either removed entirely or replaced by table speeches, goat's milk toasts, songs in honor of the married couple and their parents and so on. As Polish wedding receptions are usually all night long events, usually the alcohol goes some way into keeping the guests awake and amused late at night. A non-alcoholic wedding differs significantly from this as dishes are served regularly, must be of comparable quality all the time, the orchestra has to play all the time and the party is enriched by various group dances (such as the polonaise, line dances, \\"travel dances\\", skill dances (zorba, mountain folk dances), games and competitions for the participants. Usually professional entertainers, who undertook special courses for non-alcoholic party entertainment ( wodzirej) are employed during the reception to organize and run the entertainment program. The vast majority of non-alcoholic weddings are organized by free-choice abstinents (not to be confused with recovering alcoholics). It is a matter of lifestyle, not of medical treatment.  Non-alcoholic lifestyle  Another aspect shared by the participants of the Wedding of the Weddings is the non-alcoholic lifestyle. All family parties, like the ones connected to birthdays or name days of the parents or children, meetings with friends or friends of children, New Year parties, church-associated celebrations (baptism, first communion, wedding, funeral) are organized without alcohol. Moreover, the couples and their children are also frequently engaged in some abstinence societies.B.

History  On the 3 of April in 1846 it was established by pope Gregory XVI as Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa, on vast territory split off from the Apostolic Vicariate of Egypt and Arabia (now reduce to the Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria) in Egypt. Although it was initially headquartered in Egypt, it covered only the part of Egypt south of Assuan, where the population was primarily Nubian, and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan as well as French colonies Chad and Niger. It also included parts of Adamaua and Sokoto on Lake Chad, and the Nile Province of Uganda Protectorate. In 1851 the Emperor Francis Joseph I of Austria (a Catholic monarchy without overseas colonial interests) took the mission under his protection. It was also known as the Apostolic Vicariate of Sudan (), or in full Vicariate Apostolic of Sudan or Central-Africa, by the early 20th-century. It lost territory on 1880.09.27 to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Tanganyika and again in October 27, 1880 to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Nyanza (now the Archdiocese of Kampala), in Uganda. From 1883 to 1898, the Sudan (then an Egyptian province) was closed by the insurrection of the Mahdi Mohammed Ahmed and his successor Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, and the missionaries were compelled to work outside the circuit of their jurisdiction in Egypt. On 2 September 1898, the Anglo-Egyptian army, which in 1896 had begun operations for the recovery of the lost provinces, completed the overthrow of the Khalifa, although he was not slain until November of the following year. The country suffered long from the effects of the 'Dervish' (Mahdist) oppression, during which it was largely depopulated, wide tracts having gone out of cultivation and trade having been abandoned. In 1899 mission work was recommenced in Sudan. The two religious congregations, the Sons of the Sacred Heart and the Pious Mothers of Nigritia, furnished missionaries and sisters to the vicariate, and the two periodical papers La Nigrizia (The Africaness, in Verona, Italy) and Stern der Neger ('Star of the Africans', in Brixen, then imperial Austria) print articles about this mission. The number of inhabitants is uncertain, perhaps about eight millions. Missionary work was limited to the southern and animist part of the Anglo- Egyptian Sudan (primarily now in South Sudan) with the Shillouki Dinka, Nuer, Jur, Golo, Nyam Nyam and other Nilotic tribes. In the northern Muslim part were some European and Oriental Catholic immigrants. In the early 20th century it included: — stations at Assuan (now in Egypt), Omdurman, Khartoum (central station); Lul and Atigo (White Nile); Wau, Kayango and 'Cleveland' (Bahrel- Ghazal); Omach and Gulu (Uganda); besides twenty-five localities provided excurrendo. The membership under Apostolic Vicar Francis Xavier Geyer was Catholics, 3000; catechumens, 1030; priests, 35; brothers, 28; sisters, 45. On the 30th of May 1913 it was renamed the Apostolic Vicariate of Khartum after its see, the present Sudanese capital, as its southern territory was split off to establish the Apostolic Prefecture of Bahr el-Ghazal, which is now the Diocese of Wau, somewhat approximating the split between Sudan and South Sudan. However it continued to cover Niger, Chad and stretched into modern Nigeria and Cameroon. On 28 April 1914 the Apostolic Prefecture of Adamaua (now the Diocese of Nkongsamba) was formed, taking territory from the Apostolic Vicariate of Khartoum. It lost territories again to establish missionary jurisdictions becoming current dioceses : * on 1933.01.10 the Mission sui juris of Kodok (today the Diocese of Malakal, now in South Sudan) * on 1942.04.28 the Apostolic Prefecture of Niamey (in French colony Niger, now the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Niamey, ) * on 1947.01.09 the Apostolic Prefecture of Fort-Lamy (in French colony Chad, now the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N'Djamena) * on 1960.05.10 the Apostolic Vicariate of El Obeid (now its remaining suffragan Roman Catholic Diocese of El Obeid within Sudan). On 12 December 1974 it was promoted as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Khartoum. In February 1993 in enjoyed a Papal visit from Pope John Paul II.

A full-size mockup was officially unveiled in Paris, France, on June 13, 2007, and is now on display in the Concorde hall of the Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace. The project is the first space tourism entry by a major aerospace contractor. It is a rocket plane with a large wingspan, straight rearwards wing and a pair of canards.Astrium dévoile son projet d'avion-fusée Le Figaro, June 14, 2007, Page 18 Propulsion is ensured by classical turbofan jet engines for the atmospheric phaseSpace jet’s turbofans can cope with vacuum says EADS Rob Coppinger Flightglobal.com June 21, 2007 and a methane-oxygen rocket engine for the space tourism phase. It can carry a pilot and four passengers. The dimensions and looks are somewhat similar to those of a business jet. , EADS Astrium hoped to start development of this rocket plane by 2008, with the objective of a first flight in 2011. There was also a possibility that the Tunisian area of Tozeur might be used for the initial flights. Demonstrator test flight regarding conditions encountered in the end-of-flight phase of a return from space occurred on June 5, 2014. As of 2015, EADS Astrium was waiting for investors.Meet Adeline, Airbus’ Answer To SpaceX Reusability. Peter B. de Selding, Space News. 5 June 2015. Origin of the project The origin of the project is a proposal by a group of young French, German, British and Spanish engineers from EADS Astrium. It was studied in great secrecy for two years and finally approved by the chairman of EADS Astrium, François Auque. The design is similar in concept to the Rocketplane XP. They looked at the main concepts under development and their studies showed that Rocketplane's jet and rocket combination made the most sense.Europe's Tourist Rocket, Popular Science Magazine, October 2007, pg 41 In the following months, a core team came up with a detailed concept and assembled the required expertise from different areas of Astrium and other EADS subsidiaries, such as Socata, as well as several external industry partners.

Acceleration 3 g. Start of weightlessness phase. C: Culmination D: Beginning of atmospheric deceleration. Max acceleration 4.5 g. E: Turbofan ignition. Transition to aeronautical mode. After takeoff the plane reaches an altitude of 12 km. This classical aeronautical phase can last for 45 minutes. The pilot shuts down the jets and starts the methane oxygen rocket engine at the rear of the vehicle. The plane then raises along a vertical trajectory. For 90 seconds of flight with a top speed of Mach 3, the plane is rocketed upwards. The maximum acceleration is 3 g (30 m/s²). At an altitude of 60 km, the rocket engine is shut down and the plane continues to climb up to a maximum altitude of 100 km. This is the weightlessness phase. Then the plane gets down to 15 km at a high angle of attack, being progressively decelerated by the atmosphere; at this altitude, after transition to aeronautical mode, the jets are reignited to bring the plane back to a classical landing strip.Description of the project - Presentation at IAC 2007 Hyderabad by Christophe Chavagnac - Flight profile provided on page 7 Characteristics Interior layout of the vehicle at Paris Air Show 2007 The total mass of the vehicle is 18 metric tons (39,700 lb) at takeoff. The plane has two jet engines, and an oxygen-methane engine with a thrust of 30 tons.EADS Astrium se lance dans le tourisme spatial Air & Cosmos, June 15, 2007, n° 2082 - Pages 150-151 The rocket engine uses the technology of the Vulcain (the main engine of Ariane 5), but is reusable thirty times and burns methane instead of hydrogen (hydrogen would require too much tank volume, as the density of methane is 667.2 kg/m³ and the density of hydrogen is 89.9 kg/m³). The cabin has a diameter of 2.3 m (7 ft 6 in), and provides 3 m³ (10.6 ft³) of cabin space to each passenger. The seats are attached to a pendular system which allows the acceleration to be perpendicular to the back of the passengers. They pivot around the attachment points so that the passengers are aligned rearside to the spacecraft x-axis (body aligned on Gx-axis) during launch acceleration and they are rearside on the negative z-axis during weightlessness and reentry.EADS reinvents Rocketplane The plane is designed for ten years of service at a flight rate of once a week. Industrial organisation The development will be led by EADS Astrium. Its technical responsibility currently resides with the CTO Robert Lainé. In 2007, development cost of $1 billion was projected by some sources. EADS Astrium plans to raise mostly private money for its project. One of the possible public investors mentioned by François Auque is the southern German state of Bavaria, where the engines are to be produced. Astrium could produce up to 5 planes a year and have a fleet of 20 planes, which would require a production of 20 rocket engines a year. They do not exclude selling models to other entrepreneurs such as Sir Richard Branson from Virgin Galactic. The final assembly would be in France, while the other industrial facilities of Astrium would provide the rocket engines (Ottobrunn, Germany) or the carbon fiber structures (Spain). Other European industrial partners are associated with the project. The target of Astrium is to secure 30% of the market of space tourism by 2020, 5000 passengers a year. L'entreprise veut associer capitaux publics et privés pour le financement Le Figaro, June 14, 2007, Page 18 The ticket price will be 200,000 euros, including a round trip to the spaceport, training, and luxury accommodation in a theme park/resort.

During his tenure the club had the most sustained period of success in its history, collecting three leagues and other five international tournaments, with the player being an undisputed starter during his last six years. In January 2002, Méndez moved to Spain to play for RC Celta de Vigo of La Liga, during the Galician team's heyday. He started rarely in his four-and-a-half-year spell (a maximum of 16 games in the 2004–05 season, with the side in Segunda División), but did amass 69 competitive appearances. Méndez returned to his country in 2006, signing with San Lorenzo de Almagro and helping it to the following year's Clausura tournament to conquer his fourth league title. He took part in only a few matches during 2008, however, mostly because of constant injuries and ejections. Méndez was transferred to Club Atlético Banfield for the 2009–10 campaign, and was a key member of the squad that won the 2009 Apertura, appearing in all 19 games. On 13 December 2009, the club celebrated its first-ever Argentine top flight accolade but, shortly after, he announced his retirement from football at the age of 32. Coaching career On 4 April 2010, Méndez returned to San Lorenzo now as a caretaker manager, following Diego Simeone's dismissal. On 21 December he landed his first full-time job, in another of his former clubs, Banfield, where he replaced Julio César Falcioni.

Early life Hayssam arrived in Bucharest as a student at the beginning of the 1980s, graduating from the Railroads, Roads and Bridges Faculty of the Bucharest Constructions Institute. He married Adela, had seven children, and became a Romanian citizen after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Hayssam continued doing business after 1989, which resulted in problems with the Financial Guard. Kidnapping In the kidnapping incident, Prima TV reporter Marie Jeanne Ion, cameraman Sorin Mişcoci, and Ovidiu Ohanesian, a journalist working for the newspaper România Liberă, were abducted on March 28, 2005 in Baghdad, where they were covering the Iraq War. According to reports, the group of kidnappers included Mahmoud Khaled Al-Omar, Abdel Jabbar Abbas Jasem Al-Samani, Ibrahim Yassin Kaathem Al-Jabouri, Omar Jassam Muhammad Ali Al-Salmani, and Yussef Munaf Muhammad Amin Al-Amin (the brother of Mohammad Munaf). On April 1, the kidnappers transferred the three journalists to the Mouadh Ibn Jabal Brigade, who locked them in the same cellar where Florence Aubenas, Hussein Hanoun al-Saadi, and five other hostages were held. The hostage-takers demanded the retreat of the 860 Romanian troops in Iraq in return for the journalists' release. The Romanian journalists were rescued after 55 days in captivity. Hayssam was arrested in Romania on April 5, 2005. Prosecutors charged him and Mohammad Munaf, the journalists' Iraqi guide and Hayssam's business partner, with organizing the abduction to help Hayssam escape organized crime charges. According to the prosecutors, Hayssam organized the kidnapping because he was being investigated in several cases of financial fraud, and was looking for a way to leave the country with a large sum of money. His businesses included mineral water bottling, shops, a car dealership and manufacturing. Romanian media speculated that Hayssam had hoped prosecutors would drop the organized crime charges when he presented himself as a go-between. He would then unblock his bank accounts, which had been frozen as part of the financial investigation, pay a fictitious ransom, and become a \\"national hero\\" when the hostages were released. Disappearance Hayssam disappeared from Romania in 2006 after a local court let him leave a prison hospital to recover at home, following surgery for colon cancer. It has been speculated that he left on July 12, 2006 from the Black Sea port of Midia, aboard a freight boat transporting young rams to the Middle East. His escape triggered the resignation of the chief prosecutor and the heads of Romanian secret services in July 2006. In 2006, Marie Jeanne Ion, Sorin Mişcoci, and Ovidiu Ohanesian filed a civil suit against Omar Hayssam, each one asking for €2 million in damages for the trauma caused by their captivity; on June 13, 2007, the Bucharest Appeals Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. Capture Omar Hayssam was kidnapped by the Romanian special forces and handed over to the Police on July 19th 2013. He was immediately incarcerated at the Jilava Penitentiary to serve a 20 years sentence. He is currently awaiting other pending trials and civil suits.

Since 1963, FMCA has issued more than 500,000 membershipsFMCA's Official website, \\"About Us\\" page to families who look to the association as their source of information about all facets of RV ownership and travel. FMCA is a member-owned association that maintains its headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, and employs a full-time office staff. FMCA is governed by volunteer officers who are elected from within the ranks of the association. Formation On July 20, 1963, 26 families met at the Good Will-Hinckley School in Hinckley, Maine, United States, to socialize and become acquainted with other \\"house car\\" owners. They decided to form a motor coach owners' common interest group. A monument to commemorate the founding was dedicated at the school on July 4, 1994.FMCA's Official website, Fact Sheet Membership Membership in FMCA is contingent upon ownership of a self-contained RV — a recreational vehicle that contains all the conveniences of a home, including cooking, sleeping, and permanent sanitary facilities. These can be original- manufacture RVs, or conversions from other types of vehicle, of which buses are the most common. In 2017, FMCA's members passed a historic vote. Previously, the club was open to motorhome owners only. Through the vote, the membership voted to expand the club's membership criteria. FMCA has more than 100,000 members from every state of the U.S.A as well as Canada, Mexico, Great Britain, and beyond. FMCA also has roughly 2,500 commercial members — dealers, suppliers, manufacturers, campgrounds, service facilities, and other firms servicing the RV owner or the RV industry. Most members are only occasional users, while others live in their coaches full-time. Code of Ethics Every member of FMCA agrees to follow the Association’s Code of Ethics, which requires members to comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the ownership and use of RVs. The Code of Ethics also calls for members to be \\"good neighbors, careful and responsible RV owners and operators, and good citizens of our communities.\\"FMCA's Official website, Ethics page Purpose The purpose of FMCA is to organize social activities, exchange RVing information, and supply benefits made possible, in part, by collective purchasing. The group publishes Family RVing, a monthly magazine. It provides news concerning RV technology, the RV industry, and the association. FMCA members can be identified by the FMCA “goose egg,\\" or membership emblem, displayed on their RV. Chapters and conventions FMCA encourages the development of local, regional and specialty chapters. These chapters — FMCA has approximately 500 of them — organize events of particular interest to their members, including numerous rallies throughout the year. Regional rallies, composed of several chapters from a geographic area, are also held annually. Many FMCA chapters cover specific or general geographic areas. Others are dedicated to an RV brand, a hobby, or a special interest. For instance, special-interest chapters include golf, crafts, amateur radio, single RVers, and handicapped RVers. FMCA holds two international RV conventions each year at various locations in the United States, in which manufacturers, dealers, and RV suppliers display their latest products. The events take place over a four-day period and usually attract 3,000 to 5,000 RVs.FMCA's Official website, Conventions page  See also  * Good Sam Club  References  Motorhome Owners Group Headed to Arizona in March 2017 Family Motor Coach Association website Family Motor Coaching magazine External links * FMCA's Official website Category:Recreational vehicles Category:Transportation organizations based in the United States ","title":"Family Motor Coach Association"},{"id":"11773321","text":"The State of Michigan raised a number of Battalion and Company-sized specialist sharpshooter units in addition to the 1st Regiment Michigan Volunteer Sharpshooters.

It is located 130 km south of Birao. By population it is one of the smallest sub-prefectures in the country (only Bambouti and Djémah are smaller). History The modern town was founded by Captain Souclier in December 1912 after the fall of the last redoubt of resistance in Dar al Kuti. In May 1913, it became a subdivision comprising the area of Birao, and during the following years it came to be a part of the sub- divisions of Haute-Kotto and Dar-Kouti Oriental. In 1914 the town was temporarily abandoned after destruction by fire. After independence the town became a control post within the autonomous sub-prefecture of Birao. The current division was finally imposed in November 1964.\\\\- Subprefectures of the Central African Republic On 10 November 2006, rebels from the previously unknown Union of Democratic Forces for Unity seized Ouanda Djallé. They had started their offensive two weeks earlier at the capital of the Vakaga prefecture, Birao, where 50-60 rebels managed to chase away 60 government soldiers posted in the city. They then took nine vehicles, including two pick- ups mounted with 14.5 mm heavy machine guns that were left by the government troops and continued south towards Ouanda Djallé. During the following weeks the troops seized not only Ouanda Djallé, but also neighbouring sub- prefectures Birao, N'Délé and Ouadda. All of these towns were finally taken back by the Central African Republic military force, supported by French troops on 27 November. At the time of defeat, the rebel soldiers were in Mouka, on their way to Bria.\\\\- Sudan issue brief, Number 5, January 2007 Geography and climate During the last 20 years the Sahel area has spread closer and closer to Ouanda Djallé. In the mid-1990s, the border was said to be halfway between Birao and Ouanda Djallé. Ouanda Djallé is located on the Bongo Massif and its peak Mont Toussoro (1330m) is east of Ouanda Djallé. The town is located close to the Sudanese border, about 75 km from South Darfur. Transport The town is a bit isolated from the rest of the country. Most people live in the western parts of the Central African Republic, and this town is located far from the capital, dependent on bad roads. It has an airfield [ODJ]Info,located parallel to the RN5 main road.

He also was 0–1 with Class C Fresno of the California League. Clear spent most of 1949 with the Pocatello Cardinals (11–6, 5.84) and also was back in Lynchburg for one loss. By his 21st birthday, he had been with seven teams. The 1950 season brought him to the Class A Western League and he went 16–7 with a 3.38 ERA. He was tied for fourth in the circuit in wins, was fourth with 119 walks and the Omaha Cardinals pitcher led the league with four shutouts. He struggled with the Cardinals' three top minor league affiliates in 1951, going 1–2, 8.13 for the Houston Buffaloes, 0–4 with a 9.82 ERA for the Columbus Red Birds and 0–1 for the Rochester Red Wings. After playing on 11 teams by age 24, Clear's career then settled down. He went 9–12, with a 3.44 ERA for Houston in 1952 and 4–6, with a 3.35 ERA for the 1953 Buffaloes. Back in Omaha in 1954, Clear went 20–11 with a 2.93 ERA, led the Western League in wins, was fifth in ERA, tied for second with 22 complete games, tied for third with five shutouts, first with 267 innings and first with 114 walks. In his 11th pro season, at age 27, he was invited to the big-league Cardinals' spring training camp, but he wasn't given the opportunity to pitch.Lowery, Steve (14 August 1986): \\"Clearly, He's an Unsung Angels' Coach,\\" The Los Angeles Times That season, Omaha joined the Triple-A American Association as one of the Cardinals' two top minor league affiliates. Staying with Omaha, but now competing in a higher classification, Clear fell to 1–10, with a 4.42 ERA. He began 1956 in Omaha, but after three games, he was assigned by the parent Cardinals to the Sioux City Soos of the Western League, where on May 15 he became a player-manager at age 27. On the mound, he went 5–4 with a 6.00 ERA for the Soos. Managing career Clear finally left the Cardinals' chain in 1957, joining the Pirates as the player-manager of the Douglas Copper Kings of the Class C Arizona–Mexico League. He batted .313 and, on the mound, went 20–11 with a 3.63 ERA. He was second in the league in ERA behind Don Bruns, tied Candido Andrade for the win lead, and led with 28 complete games (in 31 starts). Still just 29 years old, he had now played for 13 clubs. He won 18 of 26 decisions, with a 4.42 ERA, for Douglas in 1958, and helped make history on August 19 when he was hitting fifth for Douglas in a game in which all nine starters homered against the Chihuahua Dorados in a 22–6 rout. It was Clear's fourth 1958 home run as a hitter; he batted .303 that season and led the Copper Kings to the A–ML championship. He went 13–8, with a 2.81 ERA for the Idaho Falls Russets the next year. He then had arguably his best year yet, going 21–6, with a 2.50 ERA for the Grand Forks Chiefs, leading the Northern League in wins and finishing in the top three in ERA. In 1961, he fell to 4–5, with a 5.05 ERA for Grand Forks. Retiring more or less from pitching, he appeared briefly for the 1965 Kinston Eagles and 1967 Clinton Pirates (1–0, 1.64), wrapping up his pitching career with a 144–117 record for 17 teams. He continued to manage in the Pirates' farm system until 1969, making stops at Batavia in 1962, Gastonia in 1963–1964, Asheville in 1964, Kinston in 1965, back to Gastonia in 1966, Clinton in 1967–1968, and Geneva in 1969. With the California Angels Clear moved to the California Angels' system in 1970, and would remain a member of the organization for the rest of his career. He managed the Idaho Falls Angels of the Rookie-level Pioneer League from 1970 to 1973, winning the league championship in his first season. Then he became a scout and minor-league instructor for 2 seasons, until July of 1976, when he officially donned a Major League Baseball uniform for the first time as the Angels' bullpen coach under newly-named manager Norm Sherry. He held that role for the next 11 full seasons, through , working under Sherry, Dave Garcia, Jim Fregosi, Gene Mauch and John McNamara. The Angels won three American League West Division championships (1979, and ) during his coaching tenure. In and , he was joined on the Angels' roster by his nephew Mark, who worked out of Bob Clear's bullpen for his first two seasons in MLB before being traded to the Boston Red Sox. After 1987, Clear continued in the Angel system as a special- assignments scout and instructor through , his 56th year in professional baseball. He died in Carson, California, at the age of 82.

It includes support for the synthesis and processing of digital audio and CV, JACK/LV2 CV - LinuxMusicians events such as MIDI and OSC, and provides a free alternative to audio plug-in standards such as Virtual Studio Technology (VST) and Audio Units (AU). LV2 succeeds the more limited Linux Audio Developer's Simple Plugin API (LADSPA) standard and replaces the Disposable Soft Synth Interface (DSSI) plugin infrastructure (\\"LADSPA for instruments\\"), adding abilities such as MIDI capability, custom UIs, and a system allowing extensibility of the initial standard.List of LV2 featuresdrobilla.net : LV2: The good, bad, and ugly LV2 plugin listing in the Carla host Over a thousand plugins are now available in LV2 format.List of 1000+ plugin uris site.

It is also the plugin format used by the MOD Duo and MOD Duo X, Zynthian, and Poly Effects Digit/Beebo hardware units.  Concepts  LV2 is an extensible framework, allowing a program to load a plugin to do some processing. Note that the terms used here are generic on purpose because LV2 allows any type of data to be exchanged between the host and the plugin. LV2 plugins in the Ingen host LV2 modular drum synth in Carla  RDF  The LV2 specifications are defined byhttps://gitlab.com/lv2/lv2/-/blob/master/lv2/core/lv2core.ttl and make usehttps://gitlab.com/lv2/lv2/-/blob/master/lv2/core/lv2.h of RDF metadata in Turtle format. Technologies involved include Dublin Core, FOAF, DOAP, XSD, RDFS and OWL.https://github.com/lv2/lv2/tree/master/schemas.lv2 The relational capabilities and properties this syntax supports are powerful but can be hard to understand at first.drobilla.net : Writing an LV2 Book Beyond the core specification there are 21 official extensions providing support for host options, plugin presets, time and units, port buffers, properties, groups and parameter labels, for sending MIDI, patches, UI events and more.http://lv2plug.in/ns/ There are various third-party extensions for supporting expressive events, OSC, and MOD Devices specific hardware and software, with three in the KXStudio LV2 Namespace. The plugin uses this information to provide a list of capabilities to the host, so the host can accommodate those.Programming LV2 Plugins book with example plugins. Similarly, the host can provide a list of LV2 extension capabilities that it supports on initialization of the plugin. In the example below, first the lv2 and doap ontology shortcut prefixes are declared. Next, every plugin must have its own URI. Then the 4 following lines declare that this resource is an lv2:Plugin, a binary object file library with the filename silence.so should be present, that the plugin is known under the name Silence, and is licensed under the GNU GPL. These 4 properties are mandatory for an LV2 plugin; if a plugin does not have all of them a host might not load it. @prefix lv2: . @prefix doap: . a lv2:Plugin; lv2:binary ; doap:name \\"Silence\\"; doap:license ; lv2:port [ a lv2:AudioPort, lv2:OutputPort; lv2:index 0; lv2:symbol \\"output\\"; lv2:name \\"Output\\"; ].  Atoms  \\"Atom\\" data structures are used for messaging between plugin portsLV2 Atoms: A Data Model for Real-Time Audio Plugins (PDF)http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/atom/ for the transfer of MIDIhttp://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/midi/, OSC, Patchhttp://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/patch/, UI and other events between plugin instances. These can also be serialised to Turtle. drobilla.net : LV2 atom and state serialisation - https://github.com/lv2/sratom - a small C library for serialising LV2 atoms to and from RDF, for converting between binary and text or storing in a model.  UI  Host interface to plugin properties Aside from separating metadata from binaries, LV2 mandates a general separation between DSP and user interface processing. Benefits include that UI processing cannot hold back DSP processing, and UI and DSP can be separated across a network. Messaging using Atoms is the preferred method for passing updates between the running DSP and UI binaries. Hosts can also provide an interface for displaying and configuring the properties of plugin instances. There are extensions and properties to help display the correct control types.  Threading  One capability that a host can provide to a plugin is a \\"worker thread\\". In programming terms, this means that the plugin can offload some work to be done in another thread that the host provides. This is generally useful because a plugin is usually run in the real-time audio thread of an application, and hence cannot do any non-real-time safe operations (disk-accesses, system calls, etc.). To make it easy for the plugin to achieve its goals (e.g.: load a file from disk), the host can provide a worker thread. The host provides the LV2_Extension for the worker threadhttp://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/worker/ and the plugin is then able to use it.  Development  There are tools and frameworks available to assist with in creating LV2 plugins. These include DPF (DISTRHO Plugin Framework), two forks of JUCE, Faust, Dplug, iPlug 2 (alpha), and Cabbage (alpha). There is also the ability to load Pure Data patches as well as JIT-run Faust, Rust, Lua or C code in certain LV2 plugins. For information exchange and discussions about LV2 there are user and developer mailing lists, along with the #lv2 and #lad channels on freenode IRC, and forums such as LinuxMusicians.

One of the only European rulers to fully endorse the Crusade was Vlad III, though he was too preoccupied defending his native Wallachia to contribute troops.Treptow, Kurt W. (2000). Vlad III Dracula: the life and times of the historical Dracula. The Center for Romanian Studies. The paper crusade was to last for three years and was to prove ineffectual. Pius would die in Ancona, making one last effort to launch this campaign by his own example.

Artistic legacy The painter Mantegna had been invited to Mantua by Ludovico in 1457; although remaining in Padua, he painted the Agony in the Garden that is in the National Gallery, London, for its Podestà; in Mantegna's picture, the disciples sleep in Gethsemane, while Jerusalem is envisaged as Constantinople, with the rising crescent moon signifying its capture by the Turk.J. H. Whitfield, \\"Mantegna and Constantinople\\" The Burlington Magazine 119 No. 886 (January 1977), p. 41.

The planet was discovered orbiting the orange dwarf star 54 Piscium. The planet's minimum mass is one fifth that of Jupiter, and it orbits the star in a very eccentric orbit about every two months. Discovery On January 16, 2003, a team of astronomers (led by Geoff Marcy) announced the discovery of an extrasolar planet around 54 Piscium using the radial velocity method, a process utilizing the \\"wobbling\\" effect that a star may experience if something is tugging on it. The planet has been estimated to have a mass of only 20 percent that of Jupiter (making the planet around the same size and mass of Saturn). Orbit and mass An artist's impression of the brown dwarf (54 Piscium B) and the planet closer to its sun (54 Piscium b). The planet orbits its sun at a distance of 0.28 astronomical units (which would be within the orbit of Mercury), which takes approximately 62 days to complete. The planet has a high eccentricity of about 0.63. The highly elliptical orbit, however, suggested that the gravity of an unseen object farther away from the star was pulling the planet outward. The eccentric orbit became clear with the discovery of the brown dwarf within the system. Perturbation The orbit of an Earth-like planet would need to be centered within 0.68 AUsquare root of luminosity (around the orbital distance of Venus), which in a Keplerian system means a 240-day orbital period. In a 2006 simulation with the brown dwarf, 54 Piscium b's orbit \\"sweeps clean\\" most test particles within 0.5 AU, leaving only asteroids \\"in low-eccentricity orbits near the known planet’s apastron distance, near the 1:2 mean-motion resonance\\".

It effectively destroyed the political career of the French prime minister, Jules Ferry, and abruptly ended the string of Republican governments inaugurated several years earlier by Léon Gambetta. The suspicion by the French public and political classes that French troops were being sent to their deaths far from home for little measurable gain, both in Tonkin and elsewhere, also discredited French colonial expansion for nearly a decade. The \\"Lạng Sơn telegram\\" Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger (1839–86) General Louis Brière de l'Isle (1827–1896) The \\"Affair\\" (as most French political scandals are still termed), was triggered on 28 March 1885 by the controversial Retreat from Lạng Sơn. The retreat, which threw away the gains of the February Lạng Sơn Campaign, was ordered by Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Gustave Herbinger, the acting commander of the 2nd Brigade, less than a week after General François de Négrier's defeat at the Battle of Bang Bo (24 March 1885). General Louis Brière de l'Isle, the commander-in-chief of French forces in Tonkin, was in Hanoi at the time, and was planning to shift his headquarters to Hưng Hóa, to supervise a planned offensive against the Yunnan Army around Tuyên Quang. Brière de l'Isle concluded that the Red River Delta was in jeopardy and fired off a telegram on the evening of 28 March to the French government, warning that the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps faced disaster unless it was immediately reinforced: > I am grieved to tell you that General de Négrier is seriously wounded and > Lạng Sơn has been evacuated. The Chinese forces advanced in three large > groups, and fiercely assaulted our positions in front of Ky Lua. Facing > greatly superior numbers, short of ammunition, and exhausted from a series > of earlier actions, Colonel Herbinger has informed me that the position was > untenable and that he has been forced to fall back tonight on Dong Song and > Thanh Moy. All my efforts are being applied to concentrate our forces at the > passes around Chu and Kép. The enemy continues to grow stronger on the Red > River, and it appears that we are facing an entire Chinese army, trained in > the European style and ready to pursue a concerted plan. I hope in any event > to be able to hold the entire Delta against this invasion, but I consider > that the government must send me reinforcements (men, ammunition, and pack > animals) as quickly as possible.Thomazi, 259 The news contained in the 'Lạng Sơn telegram', as it was immediately dubbed, ignited a political crisis in Paris: > There was enormous feeling throughout France. This retreat of 2,500 men, who > had returned to their starting positions without even being pursued by the > enemy, took on from a distance the proportions of an irretrievable disaster. > On the stock exchange on 30 March the 3% fell by three and a half francs; it > had only fallen by two and a half francs on the day that war was declared in > 1870. All the newspapers were full of accusations against the Cabinet, of > false accounts of the 'bitter combats' that the 2nd Brigade, enveloped by > the Chinese, must have fought to disengage, of fears for the entire > expeditionary corps, whose situation was depicted as tragic. In the House, > the deputies who were systematically opposed to our establishment in Tonkin > were jubilant, and the proponents of a colonial policy did not dare defend > their views of the previous day.Thomazi, 261 The fall of Ferry's ministry, 30 March 1885 Georges Clemenceau Jules Ferry Brière de l'Isle's cable of 28 March gave the impression that a catastrophe had befallen the Tonkin expeditionary corps, and none of his later reassurances was able to entirely efface this initial impression. Although it knew by the evening of 29 March that Herbinger had halted his retreat at Dong Song and that Brière de l'Isle was stabilising the situation, the army ministry remained stunned by the news that Lạng Sơn had been abandoned, and decided to disclose the contents of both cables to the National Assembly on 30 March. Ferry attempted to use the occasion to demand an emergency credit to reinforce the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. The debate that followed was one of the most vitriolic in France's political history. On the morning of 30 March, a deputation from the Union républicaine and Gauche républicaine, the two groups which accounted for the bulk of Ferry's support during the undeclared war with China, pleaded with the premier to resign before the debate. Ferry was under little doubt that his administration would fall, but he refused to go without a fight. In the afternoon he entered the chamber amid the disapproving silence of his supporters and a storm of imprecations and insults from his opponents, led by Georges Clemenceau. He had not slept the night before and walked towards the rostrum slowly and gravely, his face pale and anxious, like a condemned man to the scaffold. From the rostrum he gave the Chamber of Deputies the latest news on the military situation in Tonkin and explained the measures he had taken in response. 'We must avenge the check at Lạng Sơn,' he said. 'We must do this not only to secure our hold on Tonkin, but also to safeguard our honour around the world.' Georges Périn, one of Clemenceau's supporters, interjected excitedly. 'Our honour, yes! But who was it that compromised it in the first place?' The Chamber broke into a clamour. Eventually, when he could again make himself heard, Ferry demanded an extraordinary credit of 200 million francs, to be split equally between the army and navy ministries. He went on. 'I cannot go into the details of this expenditure in this forum. We will discuss them further with the scrutiny commission.' Clemenceau shouted scornfully, 'Who will ever believe you?' Ferry implored the deputies not to consider the vote on the credits as a vote of confidence. If they wished, they could overturn his cabinet afterwards and choose a new administration. But for the sake of the French troops in Tonkin, they must first vote to send out more ships and more men. He concluded by formally moving that the credits be voted. His opponents erupted in anger. Périn yelled 'Don't keep on exploiting the honour of our flag! You’ve wrapped yourself in our flag for far too long! Enough is enough!' Clemenceau attacked the premier in savage terms. 'We’re completely finished with you! We’re never going to listen to you again! We’re not going to debate the nation's affairs with you again!' The Chamber erupted in applause, and Clemenceau went on. 'We no longer recognise you! We don’t want to recognise you!' There was a new burst of applause. 'You’re no longer ministers! You all stand accused' — there was a roar of applause from the deputies of both the left and the right, and Clemenceau paused dramatically — 'of high treason! And if the principles of accountability and justice still exist in France, the law will soon give you what you deserve!' Ferry's opponents demanded immediate discussion of Clemenceau's interpellation. Ferry countered by moving that the vote on the credits should be taken first. Amid scenes of angry turbulence, the deputies voted on Ferry's priority motion. It was defeated by a handsome margin of 306 votes to 149. This defeat spelled the end for his administration. His opponents greeted the result of the vote with howls of delight. As Ferry sought to leave the Palais Bourbon to return to the Elysée Palace, he had to run the gauntlet of a furious crowd of demonstrators gathered together by Paul de Cassagnac. The demonstrators yelled abuse at the fallen premier, jabbing their fingers towards him violently. 'Down with Ferry! Death to Ferry!' Ferry's friends hustled him past this baying pack. But there was worse to come. The news of the cabinet's fall had gone round Paris like wildfire, and in front of the palais Bourbon an excited mob, estimated by journalists at around 20,000 people, thronged the pont de la Concorde. This crowd had been whipped up to a frenzy by agitators from the far-right parties, and at the sight of Ferry it gave tongue. 'Down with Ferry! Throw him in the Seine! Death to the Tonkinese!' No French premier had ever before faced such an outpouring of hatred.Le Journal des débats, 31 March 1885; Reclus, 334–49; Thomazi, 262 Aftermath The immediate consequence of the Tonkin Affair was to bring about a rapid end to the Sino-French War. The sudden and ignominious end of Jules Ferry's second administration removed the remaining obstacles to a peace settlement between France and China. Ferry's successor, Charles de Freycinet, promptly concluded peace with China. The Chinese government agreed to implement the Tientsin Accord of 11 May 1884, implicitly recognising the French protectorate over Tonkin, and the French government dropped its longstanding demand for an indemnity for the Bắc Lệ ambush. A peace protocol ending hostilities was signed on 4 April 1885, and a substantive peace treaty was signed on 9 June by Li Hongzhang and the French minister Jules Patenôtre.Lung Chang, 369–71; Thomazi, 261–2 The longer-term effect of the Tonkin Affair was to discredit the supporters within France of colonial expansion. In December 1885, in the so-called 'Tonkin Debate', Henri Brisson's administration was only able to secure fresh credits for the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps by the very narrowest of margins. Jules Ferry would never again serve as premier, and became a figure of popular scorn. The collapse of Ferry's ministry was a major political embarrassment for the proponents of the policy of French colonial expansion first championed in the 1870s by Léon Gambetta. It was not until the early 1890s that French colonial party regained domestic political support.See: Ageron, C.R., France coloniale ou parti colonial. Paris, (1978) The consequences to colonial policy stretched beyond Tonkin, or even Paris. Writes one historian of French colonialism in Madagascar, \\"There was a general desire to have done with other colonial expeditions still in progress.\\" Deschamps, Hubert. Madagascar and France, in Desmond J. Clark, Roland Anthony Oliver, A. D. Roberts, John Donnelly Fage eds, The Cambridge History of Africa, The Cambridge History of Africa (1975) p.525 That said, the forces which drove French colonial expansion were little slowed by a loss of political popularity. French Indochina was consolidated under a single administration just two years later, while in Africa, military commanders like Joseph Gallieni and Louis Archinard continually pressured local states, regardless of the political climate in Paris. Large trading houses, such as Maurel and Prom company, continued to expand their overseas operations, and demand military support for this expansion. The formal creation in 1894 of the French Colonial Union, a political pressure group funded by such interests, marked the end of the post Tonkin climate in Paris, which was, as such, short lived.

Life and career Liveright was born into a Jewish family in 1884. He initially followed the career of a bond salesman. He married Lucille Elsas, the daughter of Herman Elsas the owner of a paper company merged into International Paper of which he was subsequently an officer and director. The marriage took place in April 1911, and Liveright used his father-in-law's financial backing to embark on a publishing career.Teachout, Terry. \\"Huckster and Publisher\\", New York Times, 16 July 1995, Accessed 14 June 2007 The Liverights had two children, Herman and Lucy.

Eliot (The Waste Land), Charles Fort (The Book of the Damned), Theodore Dreiser (An American Tragedy), and Bertrand Russell (Marriage and Morals). The company also published the first books by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Hart Crane, Dorothy Parker, and S. J. Perelman. Liveright believed that books could be marketed similarly to other media and was among the first to aggressively sell novels. Liveright was also a vocal campaigner against the strict literary censorship of the period.Trivia-Library. \\" Biography of Famous Alcoholic and Producer Horace Liveright\\". Accessed 14 June 2007. Despite their successes, Liveright and Boni's relationship broke down and the pair chose to part ways. It is reported that they flipped a coin to decide who would buy the other out, and Liveright gained control. In 1923, Liveright's alcoholism started to take its toll. Throwing frequent, lavish parties, he would over-indulge many nights per week. Stage production Liveright started his stage production career in 1924. His initial choices of plays were not successful, and he had to use an increasing amount of money from his publishing company. His faltering financial status meant that he had to sell the Modern Library to then-vice- president Bennett Cerf in 1925. Liveright started to put money from the publishing company into Broadway productions but soon found that the erratic success of the Boni & Liveright publishers was not a secure income; the Modern Library had been the backbone of his finances. In 1928 he lost control of Boni & Liveright and was pushed out entirely by 1930. Liveright achieved success in theatre. His production of Dracula debuted on 5 October 1927, three years after the first authorized adaptation by Hamilton Deane. Liveright had employed John L. Balderston to revise the script for an American audience. He brought in Béla Lugosi to play Dracula (his first major English-speaking role). Edward Van Sloan played Van Helsing. The actors reprised these roles in Tod Browning's 1931 film by the same name. Despite an income of over $2 million from the play, Liveright failed to fulfill his business responsibilities, never paying $678.01 in royalties to Florence Balcombe, the widow of the original author Bram Stoker. Death Liveright died of pneumonia on September 24, 1933, aged forty-nine. Years of alcoholism and his business failures likely contributed to his death. Six people were said to have attended his funeral. Portrayal and biography *Ben Hecht wrote and directed the film The Scoundrel (1935), inspired by Liveright and his friend Tommy Smith.

The painting, believed to be a quarter of the original work, was executed around 1490 and shows two unknown Venetian ladies. The top portion of the panel, called Hunting on the Lagoon is in the Getty Museum, and another matching panel is missing. The painting was formerly considered to show two courtesans. Modern art historians think them more likely members to be of the patrician Torella family, as suggested by their fine clothes and the pearl necklaces, but academic debate continues, as with other similar Venetian paintings of the period.The Lady and the Laurel: Gender and Meaning in Giorgione's \\"Laura\\", Anne Christine Junkerman, Oxford Art Journal, Vol. 16, No. 1 (1993), pp. 49-58 Several objects - the white kerchief, the pearls and the animals (the doves, Venus's bird) are symbols of chastity. Note the chopines, or platform clogs, on the left. Another painted panel, now in the Getty Museum , was published in 1944, and it was later realized that this is part of the same work, fitting above this part: it portrays several boats in a lagoon, and would explain the meaning of the scene, as two women awaiting their husbands' return after an expedition hunting, or fishing with cormorants, in the Venetian lagoon. This discovery was verified by an in depth technical analysis, comparing the two fragmentary panels. Another panel the same size as these two combined would have been on the left; probably the two were hinged together to make a diptych, or a folding door or shutter. The Getty panel has an illusionistic letter rack painted on the back of the panel, which was presumably matched on this panel. This appears to be the earliest small-scale trompe-l'œil painting since antiquity.
