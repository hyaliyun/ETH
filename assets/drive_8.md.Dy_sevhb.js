Asgard from the Turner Glacier Mount Asgard (, Sivanitirutinguak) is a twin peaked mountain with two flat-topped, cylindrical, rock towers, separated by a saddle. It is located in Auyuittuq National Park, on the Cumberland Peninsula of Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada. The peak is named after Asgard, the realm of the gods in Norse mythology. Mount Asgard is perhaps the most famous of the Baffin Mountains. Climbing history Asgard's slightly higher North Peak was first ascended in 1953 by J. Weber, J. Marmet, and H. R√∂thlisberger, Swiss scientists on the Arctic Institute Baffin Island Expedition, led by the Canadian P. Baird. Their route ascended the east side of the north peak, using a climbing traverse across snowfields and rock ribs, to reach the saddle between the two peaks, and thence to the top of the North Peak. The route is graded VI, 5.8/5.9 A1. It is still the most-traveled route and is the standard descent route for climbers making harder ascents on other faces.Doug Scott, \\"Mount Asgard\\", in World Mountaineering (Audrey Salkeld, editor), Bulfinch Press, 1998, . The South Peak was first climbed in 1971 by G. Lee, R. Wood, P. Clanky, J. Pavur, Y. Kamisawa and P. Koch. Since then, at least 13 routes have been put up on the two peaks, most involving highly technical free and aid climbing, with lengths varying from to . One of the most notable routes was put up in 1975 by Charlie Porter as a solo climb. This was \\"the first Baffin modern, multi-day, technical, big-wall climb\\", with 40 pitches rated at Grade VII, 5.10, A4 and it was followed by \\"a 10-day walk-out to the fjord-head without food\\". The fact that this was all done solo was \\"a remarkable achievement\\". In 1976, stuntman Rick Sylvester performed a BASE jump, skiing off the mountain with a Union Flag parachute for the opening sequence of the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, although the fictional setting was the Austrian Alps. The stunt team and film crew had reached the summit by helicopter.

He carried heavy weights in 15 consecutive wins that included the Doomben 10,000 while carrying 10 stone 5 pounds. Bernborough was foaled at Rosalie Plains near the township of Oakey in the Darling Downs in Queensland. The bay colt was by the good sire Emborough (GB) from Bern Maid by Bernard (GB), who was the paternal grandson of Gainsborough, winner of the English Triple Crown in 1918. Racing record Bernborough first raced under the ownership of A.E.Hadwin. A Queensland trainer, J. Roberts, then leased the horse. He came to prominence racing at Toowoomba's Clifford Park when ridden to his first six wins by Les Watterson. Bernborough only raced at Toowoomba in Queensland as he was barred from racing at metropolitan tracks because of ownership doubts.Ahnert, Rainer L. (Ed. in Chief), ‚ÄúThoroughbred Breeding of the World‚Äù, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 His racing colours were orange, purple sleeves, and black cap. His trainer was Harry Plant. . When he was six years old, he was moved to Sydney and following his sale to A.O. Romano for 2,600 guineas, his nominations were accepted. Then he began a winning streak of 15 races. His wins included the Newmarket Handicap at Flemington carrying 9 st 13 lb (63 kg) and the Doomben Cup under 10 st 11 lb (68 kg). He started 37 times for 26 wins, 2 seconds, and 1 third.

Daniel Hays, J. Scott Duvall, C. Marvin Pate By comparison, other Christian eschatological views interpret these passages as past events in a symbolic, historic context (Preterism and Historicism), or as present-day events in a non-literal and spiritual context (Idealism). Futurist beliefs usually have a close association with Premillennialism and Dispensationalism. History Some elements of the futurist interpretation of Revelation and Daniel appeared in the early centuries of the Christian Church. However, the view was not popular. Irenaeus of Lyon (died 202), for instance, subscribed to the view that Daniel's 70th week awaited a future fulfillment.Against Heresies Book 5 Chapter 25, sec. 2‚Äì4 During the Middle Ages and before the Protestant Reformation futurist interpretations were virtually non-existent. Two Catholic Jesuit writers, Manuel Lacunza (1731-1801) and Francisco Ribera (1537-1591), proposed the futurist view. Lacunza wrote under the pen name \\"Ben-Ezra\\", and his work was banned by the Catholic Church. It has grown in popularity in the 19th and 20th centuries, so that today it is probably the most readily recognized. Futurism's Incredible Journey Compare: Book of Revelation The futurist view assigns all or most of the prophecy to the future, shortly before the Second Coming; especially when interpreted in conjunction with Daniel, Isaiah 2:11-22, 1 Thessalonians 4:15‚Äì5:11, and other eschatological sections of the Bible. Futurist interpretations generally predict a resurrection of the dead and a rapture of the living, wherein all true Christians are gathered to Christ prior to the time God's kingdom comes on earth. They also believe a tribulation will occur - a seven-year period of time when believers will experience worldwide persecution and martyrdom. Futurists differ on when believers will be raptured, but there are three primary views: 1) before the tribulation; 2) near or at the midpoint of the tribulation; or 3) at the end of the tribulation. There is also a fourth view of multiple raptures throughout the tribulation, but this view does not have a mainstream following. Pretribulationists believe that all Christians then alive will be taken up to meet Christ before the Tribulation begins. In this manner, Christians are \\"kept from\\" the Tribulation, such as Enoch was removed before God judged the antediluvian world, in contrast with Noah who was \\"kept through\\" wrath and judgement of God in the flood of Genesis. Midtribulationists believe that the rapture of the faithful will occur approximately halfway through the Tribulation, after it begins but before the worst part of it occurs. Some midtribulationists, particularly those holding to a \\"pre-wrath rapture\\" of the church, believe that God's wrath is poured out during a \\"Great Tribulation\\" that is limited to the last 3¬Ω years of the Tribulation, after believers have been caught up to Christ. Post- tribulationists believe that Christians will be gathered in the clouds with Christ and join him in his return to earth. (Pretribulationist Tim LaHaye admits a post-tribulation rapture is the closest of the three views to that held by the early church.) All three views hold that Christians will return with Christ at the end of the Tribulation. Proponents of all three views also generally portray Israel as unwittingly signing a seven-year peace treaty with the Antichrist, which initiates the seven-year Tribulation. Many also tend to view the Antichrist as head of a revived Roman Empire, but the geographic location of this empire is unknown. Hal Lindsey suggests that this revived Roman Empire will be centered in western Europe, with Rome as its capital. Tim LaHaye promotes the belief that Babylon will be the capital of a worldwide empire. Joel Richardson and Walid Shoebat have both recently written books proposing a revived eastern Roman Empire, which will fall with the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire. (Istanbul also has seven hills, was a capital of the Roman Empire as Constantinople, known as the Byzantine Empire, and a body of water in the city is known as the Golden Horn - notable given the eschatological references to the \\"Little Horn\\",.) The various views on tribulation are actually a subset of theological interpretations on the Millennium, mentioned in Revelation 20. There are three main interpretations: Premillennialism, Amillennialism, and Postmillennialism. Premillennialism believes that Christ will return to the earth, bind Satan, and reign for a literal thousand years on earth with Jerusalem as his capital. Thus Christ returns before (\\"pre-\\") the thousand years mentioned in chapter 20. There are generally two subclasses of Premillennialism: Dispensational and Historic. Some form of premillennialism is thought to be the oldest millennial view in church history. pp. 94‚Äì95 Papias, believed to be a disciple of the Apostle John, was a premillennialist, according to Eusebius. Also Justin Martyr and Irenaeus expressed belief in premillennialism in their writings. Amillennialism, the traditional view for Catholicism, believes that the thousand years mentioned are not (\\"a-\\") a literal thousand years, but is figurative for what is now the church age, usually, the time between Christ's ascension and second coming. This view is often associated with Augustine of Hippo. Amillennialists differ on the time frame of the millennium. Some say it started with Pentecost, others say it started with the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy regarding the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem (70), and other starting points have also been proposed. Whether this eschatology is the result of caesaropapism, which may have also been the reason that premillennialism was condemned, is sharply disputed. Postmillennialism believes that Christ will return after (\\"post-\\") a literal/figurative thousand years, in which the world will have essentially become a Christendom. This view was held by Jonathan Edwards. Great Tribulation In the futurist view of Christian eschatology, the Tribulation is a relatively short period of time where anyone who chose not to follow God before the Rapture and was left behind (according to Pre-Tribulation doctrine, not Mid- or Post-Tribulation teaching) will experience worldwide hardships, disasters, famine, war, pain, and suffering, which will wipe out more than 75% of all life on the earth before the Second Coming takes place. According to some Dispensationalists who hold the futurist view, the Tribulation is thought to occur before the Second Coming of Jesus and during the End Times. Another version holds that it will last seven years in all, being the last of Daniel's prophecy of seventy weeks. This viewpoint was first made popular by John Nelson Darby in the 19th century and was recently popularized by Hal Lindsey in The Late Great Planet Earth. It is theorized that each week represents seven years, with the timetable beginning from Artaxerxes' order to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem (the Second Temple). After seven plus 62 weeks, the prophecy says that the messiah will be \\"cut off\\", which is taken to correspond to the death of Christ. This is seen as creating a break of indeterminate length in the timeline, with one week remaining to be fulfilled. This seven-year week may be further divided into two periods of 3.5 years each, from the two 3.5-year periods in Daniel's prophecy where the last seven years are divided into two 3.5-year periods, () The time period for these beliefs is also based on other passages: in the book of Daniel, \\"time, times, and half a time\\", interpreted as \\"a year, two years, and half a year,\\" and the Book of Revelation, \\"a thousand two hundred and threescore days\\" and \\"forty and two months\\" (the prophetic month averaging 30 days, hence 1260/30 = 42 months or 3.5 years). The 1290 days of , (rather than the 1260 days of ), is thought to be the result of either a simple intercalary leap month adjustment, or due to further calculations related to the prophecy, or due to an intermediate stage of time that is to prepare the world for the beginning of the millennial reign.Lahaye, Timothy and Ice, Thomas. Charting the End Times: A Visual Guide to Understanding Bible Prophecy. (Tim LaHaye Prophecy Library(TM)) Harvest House Publishers 2001 75-Day Preparation for the Millennium (page 66) = Events = Among futurists there are differing views about what will happen to Christians during the Tribulation: * Pretribulationists believe that all Christians (dead and alive) will be taken bodily up to Heaven (called the Rapture) before the Tribulation begins.http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Thessalonians%204.13-18 According to this theory, every true Christian that has ever existed throughout the course of the entire Christian era will be instantaneously transformed into a perfect resurrected body, and will thus escape the trials of the Tribulation. Those who become Christians after the rapture will live through (or perish during) the Tribulation. After the Tribulation, Christ will return to establish His Millennial Kingdom. * Prewrath Tribulationists believe the Rapture will occur after the tribulation, but before the seven bowls of the wrath of God. * Midtribulationists believe that the Rapture will occur halfway through the Tribulation, but before the worst part of it occurs. The seven-year period is divided into halves - the \\"beginning of sorrows\\" and the \\"great tribulation\\". * Posttribulationists believe that Christians will not be taken up into Heaven, but will be received or gathered by Christ into the Kingdom of God on earth at the end of the Tribulation. In pretribulationism and midtribulationism, the Rapture and the Second Coming (or Greek, par[a]ousia) of Christ are separate events, while in post-tribulationism the two events are identical or simultaneous. Another feature of the pre- and mid-tribulation beliefs is the idea that after the Rapture, Christ will return for a third time (when also counting the first coming) to set up his kingdom on the earth. Some, including many Roman Catholic theologians, do not believe in a \\"time of trouble\\" period as usually described by tribulationists, but rather that there will be a near utopian period led by the Antichrist. 70th week of Daniel According to Futurism, the 70th week of Daniel will occur at some point in the future, culminating in seven years (or 3.5 years depending on denomination) of Tribulation and the appearance of the Antichrist. Such a thesis is paradigmatic for Dispensational Premillennialism. In contradistinction, Historic Premillennialism may or may not posit Daniel's 70th week as future yet retain the thesis of the future fulfillment of many of the prophecies of Major and Minor Prophets, the teachings of Christ (e.g., Matthew 24) and the book of Revelation. = Dispensationalist interpretation = Dispensationalists typically hold that a 'hiatus', which some refer to as a 'biblical parenthesis', occurred between the 69th and 70th week of the prophecy, into which the \\"church age\\" is inserted (also known as the \\"gap theory\\" of Daniel 9). The seventieth week of the prophecy is expected to commence after the rapture of the church, which will incorporate the establishment of an economic system using the number '666', the reign of the beast (the Antichrist), the false religious system (the harlot), the Great Tribulation and Armageddon. Controversy exists regarding the antecedent of he in Daniel 9:27. Many within the ranks of premillennialism do not affirm the \\"confirmation of the covenant\\" is made by Jesus Christ (as do many Amillennarians) but that the antecedent of \\"he\\" in vs. 27 refers back to vs. 26 (\\"the prince who is to come\\"‚Äîi.e., the Antichrist). Antichrist will make a \\"treaty\\" as the Prince of the Covenant (i.e., \\"the prince who is to come\\") with Israel's future leadership at the commencement of the seventieth week of Daniel's prophecy; in the midst of the week, the Antichrist will break the treaty and commence persecution against a regathered Israel.Sir Robert Anderson, The Coming Prince () All Protestant Reformers used the day year principle of prophetic interpretation. The commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince [Daniel 925] was given by King Artaxerxes in 457 B.C. making it 490 literal years [70X7] to the autumn of 31A.D.see Ezra 7:11-26]. Working back one prophetic week or seven literal years brings us to the baptism of Jesus in 27A.D. In the midst or middle of this last week of the prophecy, Jesus was cut off meaning crucified in 31 A.D.. So this cannot be a future fulfilment of prophecy, but history.The full 490 years brings us to 34 A.D. when Stephen was stoned and persecution began. Because the 70 weeks are a sealed prophecy [see Daniel 9:24], no futurist is authorised to unseal it.

It is a collaboration between a high school district and a community college for high school students who desire a more independent learning environment. Students take a combination of core high school courses and college courses to receive their diploma and graduate. Although students are required to take courses to fulfill their academic requirements, the students have a choice of a variety of classes to fulfill said requirements. Students are allowed to attribute the college credits earned in middle college toward their future college career after they graduate and they are also allowed to combine those together. The core classes are provided by teachers employed by the high school district while all the college courses are taken with real college students at the community college. Many of the middle colleges in the United States today are funded by various organizations, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, along with the high school district themselves. There are many that have been established across the United States. History of the Middle College Program The first Middle College Program began as a charter high school at LaGuardia Community College. It opened in 1974 as an alternative high school under the joint auspices of the New York City Board of Education and LaGuardia Community College of the City University of New York. It was funded by grants from the Carnegie Corporation and the Fund for the Improvement for Post Secondary Education.

It was released in Japan in September 2006, and in Europe in September 2007. Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland stars Tingle, a character who has appeared in several games in The Legend of Zelda series starting from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask for the Nintendo 64. It was commercially successful in Japan, selling 234,862 units by the end of 2007. Gameplay Screenshot of gameplay. The Nintendo DS's dual screens are often used to display a tall view of an area, combining the two screens to display one image. The objective of Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland is to continually build up a tower found under a spring to the west of Tingle's house. To do this, the player must feed Rupees into the tower. Subsequent gameplay is built upon finding as much money as possible, but also mixed with traditional The Legend of Zelda dungeon adventuring and puzzle elements. Among this, however, is a shallow bargaining system for interacting with non-player characters (NPCs), as items and information must be bought via offering what the player thinks is a suitable price. If the price is too low, the player may not receive anything, but if the price offered is too high they may be needlessly spending too much. Dungeons within Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland are found on each of the game's three continents, and are a necessity to complete the game. By completing a dungeon, the player receive what are typically the biggest Rupee rewards and by defeating the end-of-dungeon bosses they receive one of five gems. Even if the player has successfully built the tower to its tallest height, they must have collected all the gems to access the final location. Accessing these dungeons is limited by the height of the tower, as certain areas can only be accessed once the tower is a certain height, and thus after the player has donated enough Rupees into it. Tingle can collect items along his journey, selling them later for profit or using them to aid support characters or other NPCs. Items can be mixed together to create different variations. These are made via the boiling pot in Tingle's home, where the player uses the stylus to stir the mixture. Other items can be used to decorate the top floor of Tingle's house, and completing the game allows the player to change Tingle's clothing. Whenever the player enters a new location within Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland, the player will receive an incomplete map. By filling in and completing the map, via circling (with the stylus) points of interest which are not shown on it, the player can then show the map to an old woman in the nearby port town and receive a fixed sum of money. By selling the completed map, however, the player loses access to the map until they buy it back from the woman. Although completing dungeons can be likened to that in The Legend of Zelda series, the combat is very different. Instead of having a large amount of direct input into the battles, within Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland the player engages an enemy, at which point both Tingle and the enemy character turn into a ball of dust as they fight. Then the player can either tap the screen to rally support for Tingle, or use the buttons to move the fight around the screen. Although Tingle's Rupee count depletes as he fights with an enemy, successfully defeating one results in receiving Rupees and rare items. By engaging multiple enemies in battles by moving the dust cloud over them, the amount of rewards multiply, though Tingle loses more Rupees early on in the battle. Furthermore, to assist Tingle in battles, the player can acquire bodyguards as support characters to help him in combat and dungeons. Bodyguards are found in \\"Bodyguard Salons\\", there are thirty of these characters in all, and they must be bargained with for them to help. These characters come in small, medium and large sizes, reflecting their combat abilities. Plot Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland features three continents divided into eleven islands. Each island is themed differently and sometimes contains its own dungeon or else it has a central puzzle the player must complete. Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland follows Tingle's transformation from a middle-aged man into his green-clothed fairy persona. The story starts when one day a voice calls Tingle from his home to a spring west of his house. There, Uncle Rupee, an old man with a Rupee-shaped head, appears and offers Tingle a life in a paradise called Rupeeland if he continues to feed Rupees to the Western Pool. If enough Rupees are fed, the tower found under the pool will grow upwards towards the sky, and Tingle will be able to enter Rupeeland. Tingle accepts the offer and Uncle Rupee transforms him so that Rupees become his source of life. However, near the end of the game, the player learns that Uncle Rupee has been deceiving Tingle all along, causing Tingle to battle against him. Development Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland was announced in October 2005 under the title Tingle RPG. It was later released on September 2, 2006 in Japan and in Europe on September 14, 2007. Reception Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland has received mostly positive reviews from the few outlets which have reviewed it. Official Nintendo Magazine gave the game a score of 76%, praising the game's uniqueness, humour and \\"fantastically stylised graphics\\", but criticizing it for dull dungeon design and a poor battle system. Nintendo Life praised the game as well, noting the boss battles in particular to be surprising and exciting, though they noted that the game \\"can start to wear after a while,\\" as some aspects were \\"repetitive and/or annoying.\\" Furthermore, Nintendo Life commended Nintendo of Europe for showing the courage to localize the game into English. In its first week of release, it sold more than 45,000 units in Japan. It was the 57th best-selling game of 2006 in Japan, selling 207,525 units. It was the 478th best-selling game of 2007, selling 21,295 units in that year for a total of 234,862 units as of 2007. IGN ranked the cover art the scariest cover art in gaming. Legacy Super Smash Bros. Brawl includes stickers based on artwork from the game, and the game itself is referenced in Tingle's trophy description. However, the game is referred to as \\"Tingle's Rupeeland\\". A sequel, Irodzuki Tingle no Koi no Balloon Trip, was released for the Nintendo DS in Japan.

It is the fourth game in The Legendary Starfy series. As with the other games in the series, Densetsu no Stafy 4 features Stafy, known as Starfy in Western regions, as the main character. He is joined by his sister Starly and his friend Moe the clam. The three of them help out other undersea creatures and fights numerous villains. Plot While Starfy and his family slept in the Pufftop Palace, a nearby land known as the Amy Kingdom was under attack. The heart-shaped Monamool Stone held there was stolen by an evil female snake named Degil. Mattel, a princess from Amy Castle, fled to seek Starfy's help. When Moe the clam saw Mattel and heard about her, he rushed toward Pufftop Palace, burst inside the front door, and told everyone that she would like to speak with them about the Amy Kingdom tragedy. Starfy dozed off, and Moe told him to listen, then Starly petted Moe and talked to him about his love, Ruby the zebra turkeyfish, while Starfy sat and played with his handheld game console that resembles the original Nintendo DS. Later, after their relaxation, Starfy, Starly and Moe went with Mattel to stop Degil and restore peace to the Amy Kingdom. Gameplay Screenshot of Densetsu no Stafy 4. Gameplay in Densetsu no Stafy 4 is quite similar to the previous games in the series. New features were added in this game that make use of the Nintendo DS' advanced hardware. The visuals are still 2-D, albeit with completely redrawn sprites, while the backgrounds are 3-D. Densetsu no Stafy 4 takes advantage of the dual screens, using them to show both the main game and map of the level simultaneously, while it uses the touchscreen to play the bonus stages, scroll the map, interact in the title screen and navigate menus. Some costumes in the costume collections of Densetsu no Stafy 2 and Densetsu no Stafy 3 return in fully rendered 3-D, which allows the player to manipulate the 3D models of Starfy and Starly to see more of their costumes. Development In order to give fans a chance to contribute to the development of Densetsu no Stafy 4, Nintendo and Tose created a costume contest, and gave fans a picture of Starfy (in PDF format) to print, color, and send in. A picture of Starfy in a rocket suit was shown to the Starfy fans as an example on how to color over the coloring picture. The winning costumes also appear on the official Densetsu no Stafy 4 website. Most other artworks were featured in the first credits sequence of Densetsu no Stafy 4. Reception Densetsu no Stafy 4 was the fourth best-selling game in Japan during its week of release at 47,971 copies. Japanese sales totalled 167,136 copies during 2006. Famitsu scored the game a 33 out of 40 based on the opinions of four reviewers.

SR 2 connects Richmond and Fredericksburg via Bowling Green. The state highway runs concurrently with US 301 from Richmond to Bowling Green and with US 17 Business in the Fredericksburg area. Route description SR 2 begins at an intersection with US 1 and US 301 at the northern edge of Richmond. Southbound US 1 and US 301 head south along Chamberlayne Avenue toward downtown Richmond. Northbound US 1 heads west on Azalea Avenue then turns north onto Brook Road a few blocks to the west. SR 2 and US 301 head north on Chamberlayne Avenue, a four-lane divided highway that becomes Chamberlayne Road upon entering Henrico County. A short distance north of the city limits, the carriageways split, with the southbound lanes crossing to the west of Interstate 95 (I-95). Several ramps connect the two highways with I-95 in the forested area around Upham Brook. After I-95 veers northwest and the carriageways rejoin, SR 2 and US 301 pass through the suburb of Chamberlayne. The highways meet the eastern end of Parham Road, the main east- west boulevard of Henrico County, just before crossing the Chickahominy River into Hanover County. SR 2 and US 301 meet I-295 at a cloverleaf interchange just north of the county line. The two highways continue through a suburban area where they pass under CSX's Piedmont Subdivision. North of Hanover High School, SR 2 and US 301 reduce to two lanes and the road's name changes to Hanover Courthouse Road. The highways pass the 18th century Hanover County Courthouse and meet the eastern end of SR 54 (Patrick Henry Road) in the county seat of Hanover Courthouse. SR 2 and US 301 cross the Pamunkey River into Caroline County. The road, now named Richmond Turnpike, intersects SR 30 (Dawn Boulevard) in the hamlet of Bowersville, also known as Dawn. The two highways run straight for ; near the north end of the straight, the highways cross the Mattaponi River. At the north end of the straight, SR 2 and US 301 expand to a four-lane divided highway that lasts until the two highways pass under SR 207 (Bowling Green Bypass). US 301 leaves SR 2 on a two-way ramp to the bypass to head toward the Potomac River Bridge into Charles County, Maryland. SR 2 and US 301 Business continue into the town of Bowling Green as Main Street. At the north end of downtown, the state highway intersects Broaddus Avenue, which heads west as SR 207 Business and east as US 301 Business. SR 2 leaves town as the Fredericksburg Turnpike. On this only stretch of the state highway that does not run concurrently with another highway, the highway passes along the western edge of Fort A.P. Hill and through the hamlets of Villboro, Locks Corner, and Corbin. SR 2 becomes Sandy Lane Drive upon entering Spotsylvania County, where its solo existence ends at its intersection with US 17 (Mills Drive) at New Post. View south along SR 2 just south of US 17 near Fredericksburg SR 2 continues north together with US 17 Business along Tidewater Trail, which crosses Massaponax Creek and passes through a suburban area on the south side of Fredericksburg. The highways become Dixon Street and expand to a four-lane divided highway as they enter the independent city. SR 2 and US 17 Business meet SR 3 (Blue and Gray Parkway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. At Charles Street, Dixon Street veers east, then the two highways turn north onto a one-way pair, Caroline Street northbound and Princess Anne Street southbound. The two streets pass under CSX's RF&P; Subdivision at the southern end of downtown adjacent to the Fredericksburg station, which serves Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express's Fredericksburg Line. Immediately north of the railroad crossing SR 2 and US 17 Business meet US 1 Business (Lafayette Boulevard), which joins the two highways through downtown Fredericksburg. Just north of St. George's Episcopal Church, which abuts Princess Anne Street, SR 2 reaches its northern terminus at SR 3 Business (William Street).

Australian Sharpies are 19 feet, inches long, with a planing hull and a single mast. Sharpies race with a fully battened mainsail, a jib and a spinnaker. They are sailed competitively in all six Australian states. The Australian Sharpie National Titles is run as a carnival each year rotating from state to state. A National Conference is held each year during this event by officials from the Australian Sharpie Sailing Association (ASSA). Famous Sharpie sailors include 1983 America's Cup winner John Bertrand, Sir James Hardy and John Cuneo. Development Heavyweight Sharpie, 12-square-metre class sailed in the 1956 Olympics Development of the Australian Sharpie is strictly controlled by the Australian Sharpie Sailing Association (ASSA), which has chapters in each of the states which have Sharpie fleets. The current craft was initially referred to as a \\"Lightweight Sharpie\\". to distinguish it from an earlier design which was referred to as a \\"Heavyweight Sharpie\\"; however, at a recent national conference the name was officially changed to \\"Australian Sharpie\\". The Lightweight Sharpie was founded by the Addison brothers in Western Australia. Because of the design, the type has limitations that prevent mass- production in fiberglass. Fiberglass, by its nature, is stronger when used for compound curves. The flat bottom and sides of a sharpie are not well suited to this building material. Some designers, such as Bruce Kirby and Reuel Parker have managed to add some curves (typically at the chine) without compromising the qualities of the type, but there are limits as to what can be done before the boat becomes something other than a sharpie. The earlier heavyweight Sharpie is still sailed to this day with fleets in the UK, Holland, Germany, and Portugal. The Australian Sharpie Sailing Association The association consists of representatives from each state with an active sailing Sharpie fleet. Office bearers in the association include an: *Australian Commodore *Australian President *Australian Measurer *Australian Secretary *Carnival Secretary *Regatta Technical Advisor *Australian Regatta Secretary *Australian Publicity Officer Each state division (chapter) of the association also has its own office bearers, typically including a President, Measurer, Secretary, Race Officer and Publicity Officer.

It is the sequel to the Japan-exclusive Game Boy Advance title, Magical Vacation. Magical Starsign is the second game in the Magical Starsign series and was released in Japan and the United States in 2006 and was released in Europe the next year. Nintendo Australia has said that it would not publish the game in the Oceanic region as it expected low sales of the game. Gameplay The player uses the Nintendo DS's touch screen for character control and interaction, while the top screen displays maps and other general information. The battle system is turn-based, and the position of the planets within the game affects the amount of damage wielded or received by each character. All characters in the game are associated with a specific planet, and their magic attack power is boosted when a character's planet is positioned favorably. Players can also boost their attack power by tapping their character when the circle of symbols has disappeared around them during a battle. This is known as a \\"Spell Strike\\", and a large flash of color (the same color assigned to the character's element) appears prior to the attack. The player may also tap their character right before they are hit with an attack to receive less damage. This is known as a \\"Reflex Guard,\\" and puts the character into a guard stance and causes them to glow with blue light. However, some attacks cannot be guarded against in this way. =Astrolog= There are 7 different elements in the game (light, darkness, fire, water, wood, earth, and wind) which each correspond to a planet in the game's solar system. The Astrolog tracks the movement of these planets, which move clockwise around a central point as time passes within the game. The orbital velocity of each planet varies according to their size and location. Magic spells of certain elements are twice as effective while a planet is orbiting within the area assigned to its corresponding element. This bonus applies for both the player's magic spells and enemy spells. The light and dark elements are instead affected by solar activity: light magic is more powerful during the daytime, and dark magic is more powerful during the night (in-game time is viewable as an animated hourglass). A certain spell acquired later in the game allows the player to move the planets to an advantageous position; or potentially align the 5 planets in a straight line (as indicated in the Japanese version's subtitle), which causes far more damage than the standard elemental bonus. The planets may also happen to align without using the spell, but this causes damage to both the player and the enemy. =Multiplayer= Up to six players may connect locally (a game card is required for each player), taking their characters into a dungeon where they work together to defeat monsters while racing to collect treasure. Points are awarded for damage done to enemies and treasure collected from chests, and the player with the most points at the end wins the multiplayer mode. Experience points and treasures gained in this mode are applied to the main game. Tag mode allows players to exchange game data to gain new items. Up to 100 players are recorded on the game's friend list, and the item gained will vary depending on in-game progress or the main character's element. There is also an option to create a short message displayed when tag mode is used, allowing players to exchange messages with each other. Using the tag mode frequently will create an \\"egg character,\\" which becomes stronger each time tag mode is used successfully. The player can use the egg character in the main game, but it will not gain levels with experience like other characters. Synopsis =Plot= The solar system of Magical Starsign consists of 6 planets: the planets of fire, wood, wind, water, earth, and another small planet on the fringes of the solar system called Kovomaka. Kovomaka houses the Will-O-Wisp academy of magic, where 6 aspiring magicians are studying in the same class under the guidance of their teacher, Miss Madeleine. One day, Principal Biscotti receives word that Master Kale, a graduate of the academy, has become the leader of the space pirates, and is planning to destroy the solar system. He sends Miss Madeleine out into space on a mission to prevent Master Kale from achieving his evil plans, but loses all contact with her shortly afterwards. 3 months later, Lassi, one of the current students in the academy, discovers a small spaceship hidden on the roof of the academy building, and goes off into space in search of Miss Madeleine. The hero of the story pursues Lassi in another spaceship, but is forced to crash land on another planet. The player must reunite with the other 5 classmates, rescue Miss Madeleine, and derail Master Kale's evil plans in a wild journey across outer-space. =Setting= The story takes place within the seven planets of the Baklava solar system. Transportation between planets is made possible by using a magical spaceship, and players may freely visit other planets as the story progresses. The planets also play an important role in the game's battle system. The first planet, Kovomaka, is an obscure magic planet located on the fringe of the solar system, which houses the Will-O-Wisp academy of magic. It is not listed on Astrologs because of its small size and location, and the people living on the planet are unaware of the presence of other planets, as other planets are unaware of Kovomaka's existence for the same reason. Erd ( in the Japanese version) is the earth planet, where the player makes a crash landing at the beginning of the game. The planet is covered with stone mountains and desert, and is mostly populated by ancient robots and spiny mole people. Ancient ruins are located all across the planet. The ancient Espresso people lived on this planet before becoming extinct by \\"gummification\\" to power the robot power cells. There were also nine Stone Giants who once roamed the planet, the last one being Tektos, who was killed in an attack against Magnus Muzzleflash and gave the Earth Millennium Gummy to the children as a parting gift. Cassia () is the water planet, which consists of two large islands. The planet is mainly populated by otter people, and another magic academy, Ambergis Prep, established prior to Will-O-Wisp is located on Granule Island. Cassia is frozen cold when the player first arrives. The planet is home to the Aquarino, a water particle that neither freezes or evaporates as a side effect of being set on fire by the \\"Fire Otter\\". The planet is also home to the Holy Water Pyramid, home to the Water Millennium Gummy and the ancient race of water people. Puffoon () is the wind planet, where the headquarters of the Space Police are located. This was the player's intended destination prior to the crash-landing, and endless barren land stretches out beyond highly developed cities, leading to various odd areas such as the rabbit-populated town of Honey Mint White Caramel Fudgeflake with Melty Butter and Syrup and Whipped Cream on Top and the Couscous Ruins, a strange area home to the Wind Millennium Gummy where \\"time just piles up like snow\\". Gren () is the wood planet, which is mostly covered with jungle terrain. The planet is populated with Felin and Salamander people, and the space pirate base is also located here. The giant tree Yggsalad soars above the deepest parts of the jungle. The salamanders used to live in Yggsalad, but the pirates evicted them five years ago. The heroes obtained the Wood Millennium Gummy here, after a Felin named Semolina sacrificed herself to the anthropophagus, a man-eating flower within Yggsalad. The planet was at one point set on fire. Razen () is the fire planet, which cannot be entered by normal spaceships because of its extreme heat. Rivers of lava flow on the planet's surface, and the central mountain houses many dwarves. A stone stage deep in the cave called World's Seam acts as a portal to Nova. Another cave, called Capscium Caverns is home to a (nonexistent) dragon called Scargot and the Fire Millennium Gummy. Two different species live here, living pots and dwarves. Dragons used to live on the planets (as evidenced by skeletons in Capscium Caverns), but became extinct due to unknown reasons (a dwarf believes Scargot killed them all, suggesting that at one point Scargot was an actual dragon.) Nova is the light planet and one of two planets within the Baklava system's sun. It is populated by odd creatures called Dancing Fruit and the people of the light, the Luminites, whose queen dies and lives under mysterious circumstances. The Luminite palace holds a Starway to the other planet in the sun, Shadra. A dungeon called Glissini Caves lies hidden under the planet's surface, holding a powerful version of Shadra called Umbra. Shadra is the dark planet and one of two planets within the sun. The mountainous planet is populated by enigmas, physical embodiments of darkness, varieties including Piskpooka, Dab Hasnel, and Equillekrew (all featured in Magical Vacation). A massive worm, Shadra, that is destined to eat the sun lives in massive caverns called Chromagar Caves, which turns any living thing that lingers there into a gummy to be eaten by Shadra. =Characters= Classmates ;Hero/Heroine :The player can choose the main character's gender and element (light or darkness) at the start of the game. Unlike Magical Vacation, the main character's abilities are the same regardless of gender, but a special event occurs with Lassi when the main character is male, and with Mokka if the main character is female. The main character is considered the leader of the group, and holds the rest of the students in place. After the conclusion of the game, the main character lives with the dwarves on Erd before returning to space again after witnessing a special reaction in far away space. ;Lassi :Lassi is a ditzy, mischievous rabbitmorph girl who wields the wind element. She joins the player on Erd, after going off into space on her own in search of Miss Madeleine. If the main character is male, there is an event where she reveals her love for the main character. She becomes a scientist after the conclusion of the game, and sends Mokka into outer space as a rocket. Her name in the Japanese version is . ;Mokka :Mokka is a robot discovered in a novelty store by Principal Biscotti who became a student at the Will-O-Wisp academy after being fixed up. He specializes in earth magic, and takes a logical and deadpan view on everything. However, he has a strong desire to be in a romantic relationship, and has a crush on the main character if female. He joins the player on Cassia, and his presence as an ancient robot becomes important in the later parts of the story. He is shot off into space by Lassi after the conclusion of the story. Though he bears similarities to , from Magical Vacation, his name and appearance differ slightly in Magical Starsign. His name in the Japanese version is . ;Chai :Chai is a salamandermorph who specializes in wood magic. Salamanders are usually unable to use magic, but Chai naturally gained magic abilities. He also speaks differently from other salamanders in the game, and is viewed as a freak by other salamanders. He knows an important secret concerning the game's story, and goes off into space with Mokka after the conclusion of the game. Chai joins the player on Puffoon, and he bears the same name in both the Japanese and English versions. He might have a little crush on Lassi, but it's hard to tell. ;Pico :Pico is a hot-blooded young boy who specializes in fire magic. He has affection towards Sorbet, and often tries to show off to her. He is the most hardheaded of the classmates, and often attempts to take on a leadership role. He is tremendously bad at schoolwork, and after the conclusion of the game, he quits the magic academy after failing several grades to go off on voyages on his own. He joins the player on Gren, and his name in the Japanese version is . ;Sorbet :Sorbet is the most serious and hardworking girl of the classmates. She specializes in water magic, and comes from a poor family that struggles to pay her tuition for the magic academy. She eventually finds out about Pico's affections and starts a bud of affection towards him. She leaves the school for financial reasons, but returns afterwards as an honors student and graduates to become a high-ranking officer in the Space Police. She joins the player on Razen, and her name in the Japanese version is . Faculty ;Miss Madeleine :The klutzy instructor of the magic academy is one of the only returning characters from the game's prequel, and plays a large role in Magical Starsign. She is sent out to stop Master Kale by Principal Biscotti, but disappears shortly afterwards, causing her 6 students to worry and eventually embark on a long journey to find her. As the game progresses, it is revealed that she is a graduate of the magic academy in Cassia, and that she has lived for over 800 years, even though her appearance is still that of a young woman. Her magic element is always the opposite of the player's element (she uses dark magic if the main character bears the light element, and vice versa). According to Lassi, her strength as a magician even surpasses Principal Biscotti. Her full name in the Japanese version is . ;Principal Biscotti :The principal of the Will-O-Wisp academy is another returning character from the prequel. His name is in both the prequel and the Japanese version of Magical Starsign. Like Miss Madeleine, he is a graduate of the magic academy in Cassia, and it is rumored that he has learned the secret to immortality. 4 other characters from the game's prequel, Magical Vacation, are mentioned throughout the story but do not make actual appearances in the game. is mentioned as a teacher at the Will-O-Wisp academy who is unpopular with students because of his strict teaching style. , , and are also referred to at various points in the story.. Pirates of Cassia The space pirates are a group of villains that have recently started to abduct magicians. Their main base is located on the wood planet, Gren, and most of them are otters who wield the water element. Low- ranking members tend to attack with swords, fishing rods, or ship anchors instead of magic. ;Master Kale :The main villain of the game is an enigmatic wizard whose face is completely hidden, except for his left eye and a wave of blond hair. Master Kale controls both the Pirates of Cassia and the Space Police from behind the scenes, and is currently gathering magicians together for some unknown purpose. It is revealed that he was once a quiet but brilliant student in Miss Madeleine's class at the magic academy. His element is always the opposite of the main character's (dark element if the main character has the light element, and vice versa), and his name in the Japanese version is ; which is a rearrangement of the phonetic Japanese spelling of the orange fruit (orenji). ;Master Chard :The leader of the space pirates is Master Kale's right-hand man, who wears a sea urchin mask to conceal his face. He uses dark magic and martial arts, and battles the player 3 times over the course of the game. He maintains his loyalty to Master Kale to the very end, where he dies in a final suicide attack after losing to the classmates for the third time at the entrance of the final cave. His name in the Japanese version is ; which is a rearrangement of the phonetic Japanese spelling of the cocktail Blue Cura√ßao (bur≈´ kyuras≈ç). Space Police The space police base is located in the wind planet, Puffoon, and they are notorious for redirecting cases to other departments or ignoring them completely. They are secretly in league with the Pirates of Cassia, and generic police officers fight using light magic, bombs, and martial arts. They also have special shields made by the dwarves equipped on their backs, which allow them to fly. ;Biek Fowler :This large chicken-type alien is the combat instructor of the Space Police, and is a minion of Master Kale. He wields dark magic, and is a master of martial arts as well. He is purported to be one of the best magic duelists in the entire universe, and was the one that captured Miss Madeleine at Puffoon. After being defeated by the classmates, he tries to kill everyone around him with a suicide attack, but is thwarted by an unexpected ally of the classmates. His name in the Japanese version is ; which is a rearrangement of , which is a type of Japanese shrimp. ;Gil Mudflap :This Space Police officer wears a shell-shaped shield on his head, and his biggest weapon is his bad odor, which instantly causes those around him to faint. He also attacks by stomping, and calls Abalon Demar his brother. He faces the classmates at Razen, and it is unclear what his fate was after being defeated by them. His name in the Japanese version is ; which is a rearrangement of , the Japanese word for mudskipper. ;Abalon Demar :This Space Police officer rides on large shell-shaped shield, and faces the classmates on Cassia. He is shown wielding a sword at various points in the game, but does not use the weapon during battle. He has the ability to charm opponents, regardless of their species or gender, and is one of the few beings capable of withstanding Gil Mudflap's body odor. Like Gil Mudflap, his fate after being defeated by the classmates remains unclear. His name in the Japanese version is ; which is a rearrangement of , the Japanese word for red salmon. ;Brie Pourri :This high- ranking female officer wields a heart-shaped shield and sword. During the first part of the game, she is the one who captures Chai, who had managed to steal secret files from the police base. However, her true intention is to improve the sorry state of the Space Police force, and assists the classmates after being reunited with her father, former Space Police general Knucklestorm. Her name in the Japanese version is ; which is a rearrangement of , a type of apple. ;Magnus Muzzleflash :Muzzleflash is notorious even among the Space Police for his violent tendencies, and was suspended from the force because of his immense cruelty towards all others. He is brought back into the force by Abalon Demar, and faces the classmates on top of the Stone Giant on Erd. He has two large cannons mounted on his shield, but prefers to test his strength by brawling. The Stone Giant kills Muzzleflash with a massive energy beam after the conclusion of the battle. His name in the Japanese version is ; which is a rearrangement of , the Japanese word for marlin. ;Detective Beignet :The heroes first encounter this officer on a frozen Cassia, but is revealed later in the game to be the only officer in the Police to try and aid the children. He is considered a traitor to the Space Police by high-ranking officials in the Police for this. The female otters on Cassia adore him. ;Lt. Mugwort :Mugwort is a green, purple-haired alien that carries a star-shaped shield. On Puffoon, he temporarily arrested Chai. His in-game description mentions that he took the job as being Demar's lackey so he could massage Demar's shoulders. Localization Like many Japanese games released in other countries, most of the character names and place names of Magical Starsign underwent changes during localization. Characters are named after foods or drinks in both the Japanese and English versions, and each species has its own theme of food for their names. For instance, the mole people encountered on Erd are all named after various cheeses (Bleu, Munster, Cheddar), while dwarves are named after sauces, dressings, and other condiments. Reception Critical reception for Magical Starsign was positive on the whole, with the game scoring an average of 71% on GameRankings. IGN awarded the game 7.5/10, stating \\"anyone looking for a true classic RPG should look no further\\". Eurogamer scored the game 8/10, calling it \\"something which is well worth a look for any RPG fan who's in the market for a handheld adventure\\". Press Start Online said that the game \\"updates the 2D turn-based RPG in a way that fans of the genre will find irresistible\\". And in Japan, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 31 out of 40.NEW GAME CROSS REVIEW - „Éû„Ç∏„Ç´„É´„Éê„Ç±„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥ 5„Å§„ÅÆÊòü„Åå„Å™„Çâ„Å∂„Å®„Åç. Weekly Famitsu. No.915. Pg.59. 30 June 2006.

Career After Eskin graduated from Northeast High School in Philadelphia in 1968, he got his start in local radio at WFIL-AM when evening shift disc jockey George Michael hired him to be his engineer.Ruderman, Wendy. \\"George Michael: broadcasting giant,\\" Philadelphia Daily News, Saturday, December 26, 2009. Eskin eventually made a name for himself in sports radio by breaking stories and stirring public opinion with his commentaries. He brought that same hustle with him to television where, with his efforts, breaking news was often found on the sports desk. The award-winning sportscaster first made the transition to television in 1982 when he joined KYW-TV. One of Eskin‚Äôs managers at KYW jokes that the sportscaster kept the Eagles in Philadelphia by breaking the story in the 1980s that the owner was trying to sell the team. \\"If Howard had not stepped in when he did... Leonard Tose would have snuck the Eagles out of town,\\" says Frank Traynor. \\"Howard broke the Eagles story... and, by doing so, I believe helped to keep the team in town.\\" In the mid-1980s, Eskin co-hosted with John DeBella on WMMR's Morning zoo, their combination was advertised as \\"Sports Rock\\". On television Eskin helped launch Fox Station WTXF-TV's Ten O‚ÄôClock News as part of its original anchor team from 1986 to 1991. On radio, the \\"Sports Rock\\" format proved unsuccessful at WMMR. It began in the Fall of 1992 and lasted until the Spring of 1993. Soon thereafter, Eskin moved to WIP, whose station format would shortly become amongst the first full-time sports-talk radio themes in the United States. In 1992, he rejoined KYW-TV and then moved to WCAU-TV in 1996 where he served as a host and contributor to Sports Final until April, 2005. He returned to the show in 2006. He was also a contributor to The George Michael Sports Machine, hosted by the man who helped Eskin begin his broadcasting career; serves as a frequent commentator on ESPN's First Take; co-hosted a nationally syndicated radio show, Let's Talk Sports, and been called on for his opinions by such diverse programs as NBC‚Äôs Today Show and PBS‚Äôs MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour. In addition to his radio and television presence Eskin wrote a column for the Philadelphia Daily News in the early 1990s. Eskin's breaking stories included one that former Philadelphia Phillies general manager Ed Wade would be fired if the Phillies did not make the playoffs. Wade was subsequently fired by the Phillies on October 10, 2005. He unsuccessfully \\"campaigned\\" for the GM position, that was eventually filled by former Toronto Blue Jays GM Pat Gillick. Eskin also covered the negotiation and subsequent breakdown between Comcast and a group led by Julius Erving and Will Smith to buy the Philadelphia 76ers. Howard's involvement in the negotiation entailed a request help from Allen L. Rothenberg, a prominent Philadelphia attorney, who was a regular at Eskin's synagogue. On September 20, 2007 Howard Eskin logged his 5,000th radio show, more than anyone else in the country, and celebrated his 25th year in television that same year. Guests on the show included Charles Barkley, Terrell Owens, and Billy Cunningham. On September 2, 2011 Howard Eskin hosted his last 3 to 7 PM show after nearly 6,000 shows and 25 years in that slot. Controversy In 1997 Eskin was exposed as the \\"prominent Philadelphia sportscaster\\" who had sent a dozen roses to a woman five days before she was murdered by her husband. The woman had posted a fake profile on a dating site, identifying herself as 25-year-old \\"Brandice\\". A note sent with the roses was read during the guilty plea of Raymond Stumpf by his attorney: \\"Dear Brandice It was absolutely wonderful getting to know you. Hope to get to know you better. You were very thought-provoking and I do love your name. Love, Howard.\\" Eskin subsequently denied ever meeting with her and said the roses were nothing more than an innocent attempt to brighten a lonely woman's day. At his sentencing, in Montgomery County Court, Raymond Stumpf stated \\"I think the worst part was probably the day the roses came.\\" Stumpf was sentenced to a term of 7 1/2 to 15 years for the killing. Howard is best known for his controversial comments in regard to teams, coaches, athletes, sportswriters, broadcasters, and listeners and sometimes non-sports-related issues. It is not uncommon to hear Eskin defend one of his \\"favorites\\" against a popular critical opinion, or disregard a milestone accomplished by someone whom he doesn't \\"like\\". One example of this was when he slammed Roy Halladay in the off-season after Halladay pitched the MLB's 20th perfect game ever and the second ever no-hitter in the 2010 playoffs, for not speaking to the media enough and not disclosing his opinions on matters where his opinions had already been made public and quotes from Halladay had already been released to the media. He was suspended and forced to give an on-air apology to the organizers of the Miss America pageant for saying on the air that the contest was rigged. During a controversy involving former Philadelphia Flyer Eric Lindros selling game tickets to Mafia members, Eskin interviewed reputed Philly mob boss Joey Merlino about the Mafioso's sitting in Lindros' seats at a hockey game at the Flyers' rink. Merlino denied getting the seats from Lindros. Eskin has also been known to lead long-term \\"campaigns\\" to have players traded from Philadelphia teams such as former Philadelphia Phillies' outfielder Bobby Abreu for alleged lackadaisical defense and lack of clutch hitting, and Sixers' guard Allen Iverson for his allegedly selfish play. Eskin's last public stunt was organizing a mock funeral to celebrate Terrell Owens's demise with the Philadelphia Eagles during their 2005 season. In 2007, Eskin criticized the Phillies for not taking chances with their payroll and running their sports franchise like a \\"department store\\". After a 3‚Äì9 start to the team's 2007 season, Eskin had a publicized confrontation with manager Charlie Manuel, implying that he was not tough enough on his players and goading him into yelling and threatening Eskin in the press room, in Manuel's office, and in the Phillies' clubhouse. Eskin often touts his affinity for a wardrobe that includes expensive jewelry and clothing, particularly fur coats for Eagles home games. In his \\"honor\\", Philadelphia Daily News writers dubbed Eskin \\"The King of Bling\\". Eskin sold a bobblehead doll of him wearing a fur coat, with the proceeds going to charity, in 2004 and 2005, which raised 75,000 dollars for charity. The first 100 dolls in the 2005 version came with a special small diamond chip in his \\"bling\\" necklace. He has sponsored numerous charity and fund-raising events off-the-air to benefit a particular humanitarian cause throughout the years, most recently for victims of Hurricane Katrina. On the air, he has advocated for issues such as public smoking bans and medical tort reform. In 2015, after the Eagles preseason, Eskin proudly boasted that Sam Bradford was the best QB in the NFC East. In 2017, Eskin has used his radio show to blast Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney and the 1.5 cents per ounce sugary drinks tax in the city. The tax, authorized by Kenney in 2016, was in full effect starting on January 1, 2017.http://www.phillyvoice.com/jim-kenney-roasts-howard-eskin-sound-one-hand- clapping/ The show Though Eskin regularly initiates calls with comments such as \\"never had a bad day in my life\\" or \\"another day in paradise\\", he is known to be short-tempered and easily angered on his radio show if a particular caller does not agree with his viewpoints. He frequently refers to a caller as a \\"genius\\" or \\"chief\\" (both sarcastically), a \\"dope\\", an \\"idiot\\", a \\"nitwit\\", a \\"creep\\" or a \\"moron\\". He is known to ask female callers about preparing dinner or washing the laundry and he calls obviously black callers \\"dawg\\" while sarcastically closing those conversations with the urban vernacular term \\"holla\\". In addition, Italian callers are often addressed as \\"cuzz\\" and Dallas Cowboys' fans are termed \\"cock-a-roaches\\". Howard at times will tell callers if they are worried about their team, \\"If you're scared, get a dog.\\" Derisively, he baits Pittsburgh Steelers fans by pronouncing them as \\"Stiller\\" fans and stereotypes them as IronCity beer drinkers, smokers, and generally of a low-class demeanor while disdainfully criticizing their winning accomplishments. Eskin's years of infamy in the Philadelphia sports scene allow him to frequently have special guest athletes or other sports figures on his program, with memorable interactions with Charles Barkley, Freddie Mitchell, Terrell Owens, Lenny Dykstra, Andre Iguodala, Bernard Hopkins, Jayson Werth and Cole Hamels. Eskin also has more of an affinity towards sports gambling than other co-hosts. On Friday afternoons during football season, he often has a \\"handicapping expert\\" on as a guest. In addition, he is the self-proclaimed \\"King of Monday Night\\" due to his successful track record in picking Monday Night Football games correctly. When his time slot was Monday evenings, he would often tease and mock his callers waiting for him to announce his Monday Night pick, calling them \\"degenerates\\". Eskin's nickname, \\"King\\", was given to him by Pete Rose. The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Eskin into their Hall of Fame in 2011. Howard's son Brett \\"Spike\\" Eskin was a radio DJ on Philadelphia station WYSP,Derakhshani, Tirdad (May 17, 2006). Newsmakers: New challenge for 'Survivor' champ: prison.

One of the most popular, visible, and amazing attractions is the SOO LINE 0-6-0 class switch engine #353 which pulls a 500-passenger train around the show grounds. Also present is a miniature train, two full-size steam-operated sawmills, the larger called the Briden- Roen Sawmill after its builders and the smaller mill called Earl's Mill. Other main attractions include the steam hammer, the giant Snow Engine, which has an approximately 24 foot flywheel, and an area very popular with children, Miniatureland, which holds several hand-built miniature steam tractors and its own miniature sawmill that saws walking sticks for all the visitors who would like one. On the WMSTR grounds, there are several areas devoted to different types of machinery. There are gas engine buildings, a horsepower area, a construction area, and an expo ground. Several hundred tractors are put on display by the workers. In about the last decade, the Main Street area has grown as an attraction for many of those more interested in the everyday aspects of the past. Main Street has many buildings and demonstrations showing what daily life was like in times past.  Common names  To most locals, the reunion is known by several names. \\"Rollag\\", \\"Steamer Hill\\", \\"WMSTR\\" or simply \\"The Hill.\\"  Gunderson Pond  Gunderson Pond is the pond located in the center of the grounds. It also has its own \\"Pond Monster,\\" a likeness of the Loch Ness Monster floating in the middle of the pond. Steamer Hill Every day during the Reunion, at 10am and 2pm, Steamer Hill hosts a parade consisting of all sorts of machinery, from old cars to the giant steam-powered tractors. The Nelson crew does the whistle calls.

It is named after the nearby Gatun Lake in Panama. It was first discovered in 1972 by geologist Bob Stewart and later studied by Livio L. Tornabene from the University of South Florida Department of Geology. The structure is estimated to have formed about 20 million years ago, during the Miocene epoch. Despite the considerable erosion, it was possible to estimate the original diameter to have been 2.7 to 3 km, assuming the impact hypothesis is correct. Although diagnostic evidence of impact has not been reported, evidence favoring an impact origin include the recovery of possible impact glass at the site.

For many years, a portion was named \\"Historyland Highway\\". Route description =Gloucester to Kilmarnock= SR 3 begins in the community of Gloucester Courthouse, the unincorporated county seat of Gloucester County, on Virginia's Middle Peninsula, at a three-way junction with U.S. Route 17 Business and SR 14. SR 14 continues west from the junction along northbound US 17 Business through the central business district of Gloucester Courthouse. SR 3 follows SR 14 east in a wrong-way concurrency and immediately heads into rural agricultural and residential surroundings as a four-lane divided highway, called the John Clayton Memorial Highway heading northeast. The two state highways run concurrent until they cross into Mathews County, and reach the unincorporated village of James Store, where SR 14 continues east towards the community of Mathews, the unincorporated county seat of Mathews County along an undivided alignment, while westbound SR 3 turns north onto a two-lane undivided highway, known as Windsor Road. Immediately past the split with SR 14, the state highway passes to the west of Fort Nonsense, a state historical park, before it continues north through wooded areas with some farm fields, houses, and churches at the clearings. SR 3 meets SR 198 in the hamlet of Soles, where it turns east onto another wrong-way concurrency and two-lane alignment with eastbound SR 198; SR 198 continues west from SR 3 towards its intersection with US 17. The state highway follows SR 198 east along Buckley Hall Road, passing through another mix of woodland and farmland, to another three-way intersection where the two routes split. SR 198 continues east toward Mathews, while SR 3 turns north onto another undivided alignment that is called Twiggs Ferry Road, at the intersection. The state highway heads north through the unincorporated village of Dixie, before crossing the Piankatank River and leaving Mathews County. Upon crossing the Piankatank River, SR 3 enters Middlesex County in an area of residences with large lots, as it continues to its first junction with SR 33, which heads east from the junction toward the peninsula community of Deltaville. SR 3 turns left on westbound SR 33 to head through the unincorporated village of Hartfield, along a two-lane undivided highway known as the General Puller Highway. The two state highway continue northwest through forested and agricultural surroundings, before expanding again, to a four-lane divided highway. Immediately after the highways widen, SR 3 and SR 33 split, with SR 33 continuing west along the divided highway toward Saluda, the unincorporated county seat of Middlesex County, and Richmond, the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia, while SR 3 narrows as it turns northeast onto a two-lane undivided highway called Greys Point Road. The state highway continues through agricultural areas in the unincorporated village of Topping, before it passes to the southeast of Hummel Field, a local airport that serves Saluda. SR 3 comes into Lancaster County, on its crossing of the Rappahannock River on the Robert O. Norris Bridge, a truss bridge that has a 14-foot vertical clearance. Past the river, the state highway enters the state's Northern Neck peninsula, where its name changes to Mary Ball Road, and comes into the town of White Stone on Rappahannock Drive, where it meets the southern terminus of SR 200. Past White Stone, SR 3 resumes its Mary Ball Road name, and widens to a four- lane divided highway, before becoming undivided again when it enters the town of Kilmarnock, becoming Main Street. Within Kilmarnock, thru trucks are prohibited and the state highway insects SR 200 again, forming a brief concurrency with that route through town. SR 200 heads south from SR 3 back toward the town of Irvington, while it heads north from SR 3 towards the community of Reedville in neighboring Northumberland County, via a connection with US 360. =Kilmarnock to Fredericksburg= SR 3 heads north through commercial areas, passing northeast of the Rappahannock Community College campus in the Kilmarnock Center strip mall. The state highway leaves Kilmarnock and expands to a four-lane divided highway as Mary Ball Road, that heads back into wooded areas. A short distance later, SR 3 narrows to a two- lane undivided highway surrounded by additional farm fields, as it passes through the hamlets of Brook Vale and Milestone, before passing through a residential strip in the unincorporated village of Lancaster, the county seat of Lancaster County. The state highway west through a forested area, before turning north-northwest into open farm fields, where it reaches the unincorporated village of Lively. Here, SR 3 intersects SR 201, in which southbound SR 201 provides access to Belle Isle State Park. The state highway leaves Lively and runs northwest through more rural areas, before it insects another outlet to Belle Isle State Park, SR 354. Past SR 354, SR 3 enters Richmond County as the History Land Highway, passes through the residential hamlet of Robley, before it passes to the southwest of the center of the unincorporated village of Farnham, in an agricultural area. From this point, the state highway runs west-northwest through a residential strip consisting of farmhouses, as well as open farm fields between Farnham and the hamlet of Emmerton. Northwest of Emmerton, SR 3 widens again into a divided highway with four lanes, with a wide, grassy median, that crosses over Totuskey Creek on the Richmond County Veterans Memorial Bridge. From Totuskey Creek, development around the state highway increases again as it curves north into the town of Warsaw, the county seat of Richmond County. Within Warsaw, SR 3 comes to an intersection with US 360 and the southern terminus of SR 3 Business, while it bypasses the center of town to the east; westbound US 360/SR 3 Business provides access to the center of Warsaw as well as Richmond. SR 3 westbound in King George CountyThe state highway continues from US 360 along four-lane bypass until SR 3 Business loops back to road, north of the center of Warsaw, where it narrows back two lanes and becomes undivided again. SR 3 insects the western end of SR 203, which leads east toward the unincorporated town of Kinsale, in the village of Lyells, before it leaves Richmond County; SR 203 also provides access to the villages of Hague and Sandy Point, via connections with secondary state highways SR 616 and SR 604, respectively. Past Lyells, the state highway comes into Westmoreland County where its name changes to King's Highway, through areas of rural residences, before it reaches the agricultural hamlet of Nomini Grove. At this point, SR 3 heads through wooded areas, where it becomes a four-lane divided highway again that has an intersection with western terminus of SR 202, which leads east to the village of Mount Holly as well as Hague. A short distance later, the state highway reaches commercial surroundings and narrows to an undivided road that retains four lanes, heading west into the town of Montross, the county seat of Westmoreland County. SR 3 narrows to two lanes as it approaches the center of Montross, where it reverse turns and passes east of the Historic Westmoreland County Courthouse, before it leaves town and regains it shoulder. It continues north-northwest through rural forested areas with nearby farms and residences, where it insects SR 214, the primary access road to Stratford Hall, in the hamlet of Lerty. East of the hamlet of Baynesville, the route also insects SR 347, which leads into Westmoreland State Park, before it turns northwest again through the hamlet of Potomac Mills, prior to coming to an intersection with SR 204, the primary access road to the George Washington Birthplace National Monument in the hamlet of Wakefield Corner. SR 3 turns nearly due west as it reaches the village of Oak Grove, where it insects the east end of SR 205 that loops away to serve the town of Colonial Beach, as well as providing access to the James Monroe Family Home Site. Past the eastern junction with SR 205, SR 3 heads back into wooded surroundings and then into open farm fields, where it comes into King George County, east of the village of Rollins Fork. From here, the state highway turns northwest and passes through the rural villages of Index and Shiloh, before coming to a four-way intersection with US 301 in the hamlet of Office Hall. From US 301, SR 3 widens to a four-lane divided highway that continues through wooded areas, meeting the western end of SR 205 in the hamlet of Purkins Corner. The state highway curves more west as it passes through the village of King George, the unincorporated county seat of King George County, where it passes a commercial strip, before narrowing to a two- lane undivided road through the middle of the village. Past King George, SR 3 reverts to a four-lane divided highway and reaches an intersection with the western terminus of SR 206, which leads northeast to the unincorporated town of Dahlgren, and also provides access to Caledon State Park, in the community of Arnolds Corner. The state highway comes back into rural surroundings in the hamlet of Comorn, and begins to parallel the Rappahannock River, located a short distance to the south of the road. SR 3 continues through hamlet of Graves Corner, before reaching the village of Sealston, west of which the road enters Stafford County. The state highway continues through a mix of woods and farm fields, passing through the hamlet of Little Falls, prior to heading into residential and commercial areas of suburban development. In this area, SR 3 begins parallels a branch of CSX Transportation's RF&P; Subdivision rail line on the northeast, before drawing away from the tracks at a modified T-intersection, with the westbound direction using a flyover ramp to access a four-lane controlled access expressway known as the Blue and Gray Parkway, that immediately crosses the Rappahannock River into the independent city of Fredericksburg; SR 3 Business continues along King's Highway and loops to the north to serve Downtown Fredericksburg. =Fredericksburg to Culpeper= View west along SR 3 in Spotsylvania County, just west of Fredericksburg Upon entering the city of Fredericksburg, SR 3 continues along the Blue and Gray Parkway as it reaches an interchange with US 17 Business south of downtown, that also provides access to SR 2. The state highway then crosses over the RF&P; Subdivision line before the expressway ends, at an at-grade intersection with Bellman Road. SR 3 passes to the southwest of the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park and the athletic campus of the University of Mary Washington, prior to picking up the western end of SR 3 Business, providing access to the main campus of the university. From here, SR 3 continues west along William Street, taking over that name from SR 3 Business, and continues to full and almost cloverleaf interchanges with US 1, and Interstate 95 and US 17 respectively, in a commercial area. At the I-95/US 17 junction, the highway's name changes to Plank Road and it expands to six lanes, as it heads through more commercial areas and enters Spotsylvania County. SR 3 narrows back to four lanes, as it reverts to rural surroundings with the terrain becoming more hilly, as it crosses the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line from the Tidewater Region to the Piedmont Plateau. Within this area, the state highway passes through the hamlet of Chancellorsville, which is home to Chancellorsville Battlefield site, as well as the rural hamlet of Wilderness Corner, before crossing into Orange County just before intersecting the northern terminus of SR 20, in the village of Wilderness; SR 20 provides access to the town of Orange, the county seat of Orange County, and the city of Charlottesville, as well as being the primary access road to James Madison's Montpelier. Upon entering Orange County, SR 3 becomes Germanna Highway and turns northwest through forested areas, before becoming a commercial strip road serving the planned communities in the suburban development of Lake of the Woods. The state highway heads through more areas of rolling hills before it comes into Culpeper County, at the crossing of the Rapidan River to the northwest of the Germanna site. SR 3 passes to the northwest of the rural village of Lignum before it curves west through the village of Stevensburg. From here, the state highway passes mainly open farm fields, before reaching the eastern end of its concurrency with US 522 in the hamlet of Winfrey. US 522 heads south from Winfrey toward the town of Mineral while northbound US 522 joins westbound SR 3 to reach an interchange with US 15/US 29, a short distance to the west. Past this interchange US 522/SR 3 reduces to a two-lane undivided road, called Fredericksburg Road and follows it into the town of Culpeper, the county seat of Culpeper County. SR 3 reaches its western terminus at US 522's four way intersection with US 15 Business. US 522 continues west and north from this intersection into Downtown Culpeper, towards the village of Sperryville, in adjacent Rappahannock County, and city of Winchester, as well as providing access to the Culpeper National Cemetery. History State Route 7 was defined as part of the original 1918 state highway system from Winchester southeast via Front Royal, and Culpeper to Fredericksburg, and then along the Northern Neck via Warsaw to Reedville. Proposed \\"State Highway System\\" for Virginia, as Recommended by the State Roads Committee, January, 1918 This is now approximated by U.S. Route 522, State Route 3, and U.S. Route 360. In late 1921, the State Highway Commission looked at possible routes between Winchester and Front Royal, specifically via Middletown to Cedarville and via Boyce, White Post, Stone Bridge, and Rockland to Cedarville, and decided on the direct route via Double Toll Gate. SR 7 at first ran from Montross via Templeman to Warsaw and then east via Heathsville to Reedville. By late 1922, a branch northwest from Callao via Hague to Templeman was added and assigned the State Route 7-X designation. In the 1923 renumbering, SR 7 became State Route 37 (and SR 7-X became State Route 371). By the end of that year, SR 37's east end was moved from Reedville to Westland, and the old road between Warsaw and Reedville became part of SR 371.

It airs a classic rock radio format and is owned by Entercom. The studios and offices are located on Madison Avenue in North Highlands (with a Sacramento address).Eagle969.com/contact-us KSEG is co-owned with five other Sacramento Entercom radio stations. KSEG has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 50,000 watts. The transmitter is off North Market Boulevard in Sacramento, near Steelhead Creek.Radio-Locator.com/KSEG KSEG broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. The HD2 subchannel plays Blues music. History =Early years= On October 2, 1959, after beginning testing the previous month, the station signed on. Its call sign was KSFM. It was owned by local radio personality Fred White and KXTV engineer Bob Stofan, doing business as the Audiolab Company,.ref name=\\"hc\\"> KSEG played classical music from studios and a transmitter site in Arden Town. In 1961, the station moved its studios and transmitter to a site on Rosebud Lane, increasing power from 6,400 to 64,000 watts. KSFM went silent for 90 days on October 11, 1963, to permit a financial reorganization of the station. That December, a judge ordered the station to return $16,000 worth of equipment to the Collins Radio Company after not making monthly payments on its purchase. It was announced in August that the Belltone Music Company would assume operations of the silent station, with an affiliated background music service broadcast on its subcarrier. This prompted a lawsuit from Dale Flewelling, founder of KXRQ (98.5 FM). Flewelling, who had bought KSFM's existing background music business in December 1962, charged that KSFM's reentry into that market violated a non-compete clause and sought an injunction to prevent such activity at KSFM until December 1965. The Flewelling lawsuit was dismissed in January 1965. In 1971, KSFM was acquired by PSA Broadcasting, a division of Pacific Southwest Airlines. While there were no changes in personnel as a result of the purchase, PSA changed the station to a beautiful music format, as its other stations had, and the call letters changed to KPSC. (The call letters KSFM were adopted by 102.5 FM in June 1972.) PSA chose call signs for its four stations in California with designations including the letters \\"EZ.\\" KPSC thus became KEZS in 1973. =KROI, KROY-FM, KSAC and KROY again= In 1975, Atlantic States Industries, owners of popular Top 40 station KROY 1240 AM, acquired KEZS. To echo its new sister station, the call letters were changed to KROI. KROY-KROI was acquired in 1978 by Jonsson Broadcasting Corporation, with the two stations fetching $1.65 million and $1.1 million, respectively. While separately programmed from the AM station as an album-oriented rock station, KROI became KROY-FM on April 23, 1979. Management believed the separate KROI designation confused advertisers used to the more familiar KROY call letters. The rapid rise of KZAP after its 1978 sale to Western Cities Broadcasting gave KROY-FM a powerful rock competitor. In 1984, KROY-FM became adult contemporary outlet KSAC, doing what a number of Sacramento radio stations had attempted to do but fail‚Äîsecure the call letters that had belonged to the radio station of Kansas State University since the early days of radio. That station had been KSAC, since the university was known as Kansas State Agricultural College when it was founded. 1984 was its 60th anniversary, and the station's longtime desire to obtain call letters containing KSU, plus a $25,000 offer from the Sacramento station and FCC deregulation, helped secure the change. Dick Tracy, radio columnist for the Sacramento Bee, questioned Jonsson's management of its Sacramento stations, noting that \\"long-range ineptitude\\" had caused listenership to its local stations to decline considerably. Jonsson moved its stations to new quarters in the American River Commons office park. In 1985, Jonsson sold its two Sacramento radio stations to Commonwealth Broadcasting for $12 million. Commonwealth relaunched 96.9 FM as hot adult contemporary/contemporary hit radio KROY-FM (branded as \\"97 KROY\\"), restoring the call letters that Jonsson had moved to a station in Reno, and moved KSAC to 1240 AM. Ratings surged from a 2.2 to a 5.9 in 1987, coming close to beating KSFM (102.5 FM), which had led the market overall prior to the creation of 97 KROY. In 1988, Great American Broadcasting acquired KROY for $11.8 million. =KSEG= On November 12, 1990, KROY became KSEG, flipping from CHR to classic rock; the first song under the new format was \\"Fly Like an Eagle\\" by the Steve Miller Band. The move came as the CHR format was in a decline, and Sacramento had three stations in the format. The flip to classic rock put KZAP on notice and surpassed it in the ratings; ultimately, that station bowed out of the competition and flipped to country in January 1992. KSEG attracted local attention in its early years for giving away condoms in an AIDS education campaign, while in 1993, Governor Pete Wilson took an air shift on its \\"Classic Nine at 9\\" program for his 60th birthday, taking KSEG up on a long-standing offer. In 1993, Great American Broadcasting acquired rock outlet KRXQ (93.7 FM), which targeted a younger audience. After Jacor Communications acquired Great American, it sold both Sacramento stations to Entercom, which at the same time purchased KXOA-FM 107.9; the two Jacor pickups sold for $45 million. In the wake of the sale, KSEG dismissed its morning show team of Jeff McMurray and Mark Davis, ultimately replacing them with The Mark & Brian Show from Los Angeles. KSEG was the Sacramento market affiliate for San Francisco 49ers game broadcasts, directly contracting with San Francisco station KGO for the rights. When the Niners changed flagships to KNBR ahead of the 2005 season, however, KSEG lost the rights alongside KGO and opted not to even pursue a new deal, citing KNBR's strong signal into Sacramento. KSEG-HD2 KSEG's HD2 subcarrier offers a blues format.

Maurice Edmond SaillandSome sources spell it 'Saillant', but the 'd' spelling is used in his autobiography and most other reliable sources. (October 12, 1872, Angers, France - July 22, 1956, Paris), better known by his pen-name Curnonsky (nicknamed 'Cur'), and dubbed the Prince of Gastronomy, was the most celebrated writer on gastronomy in France in the 20th century. He wrote or ghost-wrote over 65 books and enormous numbers of newspaper columns. He is often considered the inventor of gastronomic motor-tourism as popularized by Michelin, though he himself could not drive. He was a student of Henri-Paul Pellaprat. Name The name \\"Curnonsky\\" comes from the Latin cur + non \\"why not?\\" plus the Russian suffix -sky, as all things Russian were in vogue in 1895, when he coined it. He once said that this nickname was \\"my tunic of Nessus, as I am neither Russian, nor Polish, nor Jewish, nor Ukrainian, but just an average Frenchman and wine-guy [sacavin]\\". He was often called the prince-elect of gastronomy (Prince-√©lu de la Gastronomie) or of gastronomes, and he had in fact been duly elected in a poll of 3,000 chefs held by Paris- Soir in 1927. There was at the time a series of 'Princes', including Andr√© de Lorde, the Prince of Terror, and so on. Philosophy A celebrated aphorism of Curnonsky's was: :La cuisine, c'est quand les choses ont le go√ªt de ce qu'elles sont. :Good cooking is when things taste of what they are. He advocated simple food over complicated, rustic over refined, and often repeated the phrase :Et surtout, faites simple! :And above all, keep it simple! which was probably due to Escoffier. Chronology Curnonsky was a ghostwriter for 'Willy', Colette's husband. According to his biographer Arbellot, he coined the name Bibendum for the Michelin Man in 1907--because \\"Michelin tires drink [i.e. 'soak up' or 'eat up'] everything, even obstacles\\"--, and wrote Michelin's weekly column \\"Les Lundis de Michelin\\" in Le Journal starting on November 25, 1907. It was originally signed \\"Michelin\\" but starting on March 2, 1908, it was signed \\"Bibendum\\". Michelin had used the phrase \\"Nunc est bibendum\\" (\\"Cheers!\\" in Latin) on a poster in 1898, showing the Michelin Man swallowing a glass full of nails, but it is unclear when the word \\"Bibendum\\" became applied to this character. In 1921, he started the publication of La France Gastronomique with Marcel Rouff. He was named a knight of the L√©gion d'Honneur in 1929, and promoted to officer in 1938. In 1930, he co-founded the Acad√©mie des gastronomes, modelled on the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, and served as its first president, until 1949. In 1947, he started the magazine Cuisine et Vins de France along with Madeleine Decure. In 1950, he was a co-founder of the Confr√©rie de la Cha√Æne des R√¥tisseurs. To honor his eightieth birthday, eighty restaurants marked his favorite table with a copper plaque reading: Cette place est celle de Maurice Edmond Sailland-Curnonsky Prince √©lu des gastronomes D√©fenseur et illustrateur de la Cuisine fran√ßaise H√¥te d'honneur de cette maison This led to the legend that eighty restaurants reserved a table for him every night in case he should show up, though by that point, he rarely went out at all. Curnonsky died by falling out of the window of his apartment. He was dieting at the time, and hence it was speculated that he had fainted. A year later a commemorative plaque on nr. 14 of the place Henri-Bergson, Paris 8e was installed and a booklet published on this occasion.

DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin receptor present on the surface of both macrophages and dendritic cells. DC-SIGN on macrophages recognises and binds with high affinity to high- mannose type N-glycans, a class of pathogen associated molecular patterns PAMPs commonly found on viruses, bacteria and fungi. This binding interaction activates phagocytosis. On myeloid and pre-plasmacytoid dendritic cells DC- SIGN mediates dendritic cell rolling interactions with blood endothelium and activation of CD4+ T cells, as well as recognition of pathogen haptens.  Function  DC-SIGN is a C-type lectin and has a high affinity for the ICAM3 molecule. It binds various microorganisms by recognizing high-mannose- containing glycoproteins on their envelopes and especially functions as receptor for several viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis C. Binding to DC-SIGN can promote HIV and Hepatitis C virus to infect T-cell from dendritic cells. Thus binding to DC-SIGN is an essential process for HIV infection. Besides functioning as an adhesion molecule, recent study has also shown that DC-SIGN can initiate innate immunity by modulating toll-like receptors, though the detailed mechanism is not yet known. DC-SIGN together with other C-type lectins is involved in recognition of tumors by dendritic cells. DC-SIGN is also a potential engineering target for dendritic cell based cancer vaccine.  Role in HIV infection  This molecule is involved in the initial stages of the human immunodeficiency virus infection, as the HIV gp120 molecule causes co-internalization of the DC-SIGN molecule and HIV virus particle (virion). The dendritic cell then migrates to the cognate lymphoid organ, whereupon recycling of the DC-SIGN/HIV virion complex to the cell periphery facilitates HIV infection of CD4+ T cells by interaction between DC-SIGN and ICAM-3.  Gene family  DC-SIGN/CD209 is an animal \\"C-lectin\\", a large and diverse family of proteins found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes most of which are functional lectins, meaning they bind carbohydrate ligands, and whose ligand- binding affinity requires calcium (hence \\"C-lectin\\"). Among the animal C-lectins, a subfamily known as the ASGR (asialoglycoprotein receptors) group contains several sub-sub-families, many of which are important to innate immunity. A cluster of genes in both humans and mice contains three related members of the \\"DC Receptor\\" class, so named because of their homology to DC- SIGN. Of these, CD23 is, however, not expressed on dendritic cells but is a characteristic surface molecule of B lymphocytes, and LSectin (CLEC4G) is expressed on the sinusoidal endothelium of the liver. The third gene group consists of multiple paralogues of CD209. Thus, both primates and mice have multiple paralogues of CD209 more closely related to each other within the species than to their orthologous counterparts in the other species. Higher primates have at least three DC-SIGN genes, DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNL1 and DC-SIGNL2, although not all three are present in every species; DC-SIGNL2 has not been detected in humans. Eight paralogous of DC-SIGN have been reported in the laboratory mouse strain C57BL/6; these go by the names DC-SIGN, DC- SIGNR2...DC-SIGNR8. DC-SIGNR6 is a pseudogene. The genes labeled \\"DC-SIGN\\" in the human and mouse are thus not unique orthologues, although they resemble each other functionally and by being expressed on dendritic cells. Other members of the mouse CD209 gene group are differentially expressed on different cell types. For example, DC-SIGNR1 is expressed largely on macrophages in the marginal zones of the spleen and in the medulla of lymph nodes.

Jacob Taubes writes that idealist eschatology came about as Renaissance thinkers began to doubt that the Kingdom of Heaven had been or would be established on earth, but still believed in its establishment.Occidental Eschatology By Jacob Taubes, p.86 Rather than the Kingdom of Heaven manifesting itself in society, it is seen as established subjectively for the individual.Occidental Eschatology By Jacob Taubes, p.132 F. D. Maurice (1805-1872) interpreted the Kingdom of Heaven idealistically as a symbol representing society's general improvement, instead of as a physical and political kingdom. Karl Barth (1886-1968) interpreted eschatology as representing existential truths that bring the individual hope, rather than as history or as future-history.Encyclopedia of time By Samuel L. Macey, p.186-187 Barth's ideas provided fuel for the Social Gospel philosophy in America, which saw social change not as performing \\"required\\" good works, but because the individuals involved felt that Christians could not simply ignore society's problems with future dreams.Karl Barth and Christian Unity - The Influence of the Barthian Movement Upon the Churches of the World, by Professor Adolf Keller, p.190-192 Different authors have suggested that the Beast of Revelation represents various social injustices, such as exploitation of workers,Third Way magazine, April 1987, p.23 wealth, the elite, commerce,Who rides the beast?: prophetic rivalry and the rhetoric of crisis in the churches of the apocalypse By Paul Brooks Duff, p. 70, Oxford UP 2001 materialism, and imperialism.Christopher R. Smith, \\"Reclaiming the Social Justice Message of Revelation: Materialism, Imperialism and Divine Judgement in Revelation 18\\", Transformation 7 (1990): 28-33 Various Christian anarchists, such as Jacques Ellul (1912-1994), have identified the State and political power as the Beast. Other scholars merge a preterist view with an idealist perspective. Craig R. Koester, Revelation (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2014), 506, 579, 684; James L. Resseguie, The Revelation of John: A Narrative Commentary (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2009), 183. The beast not only represents the Roman empire of the first century AD; it is a signifier for a universal political/cultural setting. For example, the Lutheran scholar Craig R. Koester suggests that ‚Äúthe vision [of the beast] speaks to the imperial context in which Revelation was composed, but it does so with images that go beyond that context, depicting the powers at work in the world in ways that continue to engage readers of subsequent generations.‚ÄùKoester, 579. And his comments on the whore of Babylon develop this perspective: ‚ÄúThe whore [of Babylon] is Rome, yet more than Rome.‚ÄùKoester, 684.It ‚Äúis the Roman imperial world, which in turn represents the world alienated from God.‚ÄùKoester, 506. Christian eschatological idealism is distinct from Preterism, Futurism and Historicism in that it does not see any of the prophecies (except in some cases the Second Coming, and Final Judgment) as being fulfilled in a literal, physical, earthly sense in the past, present or future.The Concise Dictionary of Christian Theology By Millard J.

It was previously released in Australia as CrossworDS but a new OFLC entry confirms that Nintendo Australia is re- releasing it with a European localization. It was first released in North America, and has since been released in Australia. Crosswords DS features over 1,000 crossword puzzles that the player solves by using the stylus. Despite the title, it also features word search puzzles and anagram puzzles. It makes use of similar handwriting mechanics that the Brain Age titles make use of. Crosswords DS is included in the Touch! Generations series of titles, which includes such popular games as Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day! and Nintendogs. The background music was composed by Fabian Del Priore. In 2012, Nintendo released a sequel for the Nintendo 3DS, called Crosswords Plus. Gameplay Crosswords DS supports up to four players, and features two basic modes - Training and Main Game. The main game includes three classifications of puzzles - Crosswords, Word Searches, and Anagrams. The game uses similar handwriting mechanics to solve the puzzles as the popular Brain Age series of video games, as well as requiring the player to hold the Nintendo DS like a book. All three puzzles have varying difficulty levels, all of them featuring unlockable puzzles and difficulty levels. =Crosswords= The crossword puzzle is displayed on the touch screen and players tap tiles with the stylus to enlarge them, and then proceed to write in the desired letter. If a correct letter is written, it appears in black, and if an incorrect letter is written it appears in red. On higher difficulties, the player has the option to do the puzzle without the game showing if the letter is correct or not. A player can erase a letter or simply draw over it. The game will automatically move to the next tile after a correct letter, and will move either down or right, depending on which mode is toggled, across or down. Each puzzle also has a certain number of hint points that the player can used if stumped, but will also add a minute to the player's time. When a puzzle is completed the game will show the amount of time it took to complete, and give the player a grade. =Word searches= Word searches each have a certain category (i.e. \\"animals\\") that determine what kind of words the player will be searching for. Like a normal word search the word may appear forwards, backwards, or diagonally. The player touches the starting letter of the word, and drags the stylus to the ending letter of the word to highlight it. Once a word is found it is automatically crossed off form the word box on the left. The player's time is displayed, but no grade is given. =Anagrams= Anagrams give the player a certain number of letters, and the player must find every word that can be made out of the letters (2 letter words are not included). Players drag the letter tiles with the stylus into a box to make the words. When a word is found it will appear in its box on the top screen, listed in a group of how many letters the word is and alphabetically. When every word has been found, the player's time is shown, but like word searches, no grade is given. Anagrams comes in three difficulties: Short (4 letter words), Medium (5 letter words) and Long (6 letter words). Each difficulty awards you medals for completing 100, 200 and 300 anagram games. Each difficulty freezes the game once you have reached 583 anagrams of that difficulty. Reception Matt Casamassina of gaming website IGN gave the game an 8.0/10, citing the number of crossword puzzles available and the control scheme as highlights, as well as the low price of the game. Some criticisms were the lack of any \\"bells and whistles\\" or downloadable content.Game Rankings - External Link 1UP gave the game a B-, and GameDaily gave it an 8/10.

Known for most of its length as River Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 250 (US 250) in Afton east to SR 161 in Richmond. SR 6 is one of the main highways of mountainous Nelson County, where the highway runs north-south from its beginning to US 29. From Scottsville to Richmond, the state highway parallels the James River. SR 6 is a major suburban highway through southwestern Henrico County and the main street of Richmond's West End. SR 6 is a Virginia Byway from SR 151 at Avon to SR 650 near Manakin. Route description View west along SR 6 past SR 151 near Avon SR 6 begins at US 250 (Rockfish Gap Turnpike) on the slope of Afton Mountain, the local name for this section of the Blue Ridge Mountains, about east of Rockfish Gap. The state highway heads south as Afton Mountain Road, which descends the mountain curvaceously and passes through the village of Afton, where the highway crosses over a CSX rail line. At the bottom of the descent, SR 6 meets SR 151 (Critzers Shop Road) in the village of Avon. The two highways head south as Rockfish Valley Highway through the namesake valley. Just south of Greenfield, SR 6 leaves SR 151 and heads east as River Road, which follows the Rockfish River through a mountainous area south to US 29 (Thomas Nelson Highway). SR 6 heads east along the four-lane divided highway between several mountains before splitting to the southeast as Irish Road. The state highway crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's Washington District in Faber and enters Albemarle County at a gap between Shiloh Mountain and Butler Mountain. View east along SR 6 at US 15 in Fluvanna County SR 6 continues east along a mountainous area where the highway passes through the communities of Damon, Tillmans, Esmont, and Porters. The state highway enters an area of more gentle terrain on its way to Scottsville, which is on the border between Albemarle and Fluvanna counties. At the north end of the town, SR 6 joins SR 20 in a concurrency on Valley Street. In the center of town, SR 6 heads east as Main Street while SR 20 crosses the James River. The state highway parallels the river and CSX's Rivanna Subdivision through the town before turning north and ascending out of the river valley. SR 6 continues east as River Road through Kidds Store and Cohasset to Fork Union, home of Fork Union Military Academy. The state highway runs concurrently with US 15 (James Madison Highway) northeast from Fork Union before diverging at Dixie. SR 6 passes through Holmhead and crosses the Rivanna River shortly before passing through the town of Columbia, where the highway is named St. James Street. At the east end of the town, SR 6 enters Goochland County and briefly parallels the Rivanna Subdivision through the valley of the James River. The state highway veers away from the river and meets the northern end of SR 45 (Cartersville Road) at Georges Tavern. SR 6 approaches the river again just before arriving in Goochland. At the north end of the county seat, the state highway joins US 522 (Sandy Hook Road) in a concurrency and heads south past the Western Campus of J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College. SR 6 and US 522 pass the county offices and the Virginia Correctional Center for Women before US 522 heads south across the James River as Maidens Road. SR 6 heads through the villages of Manakin and Sabot, between which SR 6 expands to a four-lane divided highway. At Richmond Country Club, River Road splits to the south and the state highway continues east as Patterson Avenue. SR 6 meets the SR 288 freeway at a cloverleaf interchange before crossing Tuckahoe Creek into suburban Henrico County. The state highway intersects Gaskins Road, which heads north as SR 157, and Parham Road in the suburb of Tuckahoe. At Glenside Drive, which leads north to Monument Avenue, SR 6 veers southeast and enters the city of Richmond. The state highway becomes an undivided highway just before intersecting SR 197 (Malvern Avenue). SR 6 crosses over Interstate 195 (Beltline Expressway), which is accessed via Thompson Street, which the state highway intersects as it shifts to two-lane Kensington Avenue. The state highway continues through the Museum District until it reaches its eastern terminus at SR 161 (Boulevard) one block north of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.

Managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the wilderness was designated by Congress in 1975. Home to as many as 30,000 white pelicans, the wilderness preserves habitat for the largest single grouping of pelicans in North America. The pelicans have enjoyed a tremendous rebound from the 50 or so examples that existed in the region when first counted in 1908. Tending to nest on two large islands within the lake for protection from predators, some of the pelicans have been banded and these same birds have been found as far south as the Everglades in Florida during the winter months. Chase Lake is an alkaline lake and supports no fish species, so the pelicans rely on the plentiful tiger salamander as a food source. The white pelican is the largest of all pelicans; they can have a 10-foot (3 m) wingspan and weigh an average of 20 pounds. White pelicans nesting on an island in Chase Lake Many other bird species can also be found here including herons, loons, ibises, ducks, geese, hawks and terns to name but a few. White-tailed deer, weasels, coyote and badger also inhabit the wilderness. No camping is permitted in the wilderness and some areas are completely off limits to people, especially during the nesting season. A few trails allow access for bird watching and visitors are encouraged to remain on designated trails. U.S. Wilderness Areas do not allow motorized or mechanized vehicles, including bicycles. Although camping and fishing are allowed with proper permit, no roads or buildings are constructed and there is also no logging or mining, in compliance with the 1964 Wilderness Act. Wilderness areas within National Forests and Bureau of Land Management areas also allow hunting in season.

The group formed in 1997 and as of 2019 have released 3 albums, Saturdays in 2001, Invisible in 2005 and We Could Leave Tonight in 2014 as well as various other releases on cassettes, 7\\" and compilations. We Could Leave Tonight was released on vinyl 22 July 2014 through Tym Records, and on CD and digitally on 22 August 2014 through Simon Tahiti Records. Early days The band formed initially as a side-project with David Challinor (guitar), David Hobson (bass) and Rohan Geddes (drums) in a recently vacated room in Challinor's moldy and more or less condemned share house in Pennant Hills in Sydney's north west in August 1997. Challinor had been mostly busy playing guitar in the Sydney indie band Sal Paradise (Tooth & Nail Records) since early 1996, and Hobson had been playing bass in Sydney punk/hardcore act Ceasefire since around 1994. Early Sounds Like Sunset tape recordings and gigs showed the band in similar sonic territory as inspiring home-recording-band influences Flying Saucer Attack and other drone/noise/post-rock instrumental bands of the time - however this was something the band quickly distanced themselves from in the hope of melding all the noise & feedback into more concise, hummable melodic pop arrangements. Music The band are often filed under shoegazer and noise-pop music. The group's influences and inspiration range from the Beatles, Beach Boys, The Kinks, Velvet Underground and Love, through to more recent artists You Am I, Dinosaur Jr, Sebadoh, Spacemen3, Stereolab, Bailter Space, Flying Saucer Attack, Sonic Youth, The Cure, My Bloody Valentine and the Jesus and Mary Chain. The members' teenage/formative years share a collective love of punk & Death metal - which occasionally resurfaces, some might say at odds with the delicate melodic nature of the band's current output. Live shows are generally loud, densely layered and orchestrated guitar assaults. PRL Until recently the band regularly fielded a team aptly named \\"The S√∂unds Like Sunset Singlet√∂nes\\" in the PRL (Pretend Rugby League) competition, formed during the early 2000s by Chief Robert F Cranny of numerous celebrated indie bands including Sarah Blasko, Gersey and 78 Saab. The PRL was formed from a number of the community of Sydney indie bands who rehearsed at the beloved and now defunct Troy Horse Studios in Alexandria. The team's PRL career began in 2003 during an alcohol-fuelled player auction event at the Zetland Hotel where the mostly ambivalent Challinor/Hobson auction representatives quickly exceeded the $100 salary cap and were outrageously docked competition points before a ball had even been kicked. Its career highlight was coming Div 1 runners-up in the 2006 season, followed by a Div1 3rd place in the 2007 season with a team selected entirely by Travis Baird of cult Sydney indie instrumental band Founder. Baird was recruited to select a squad when everyone in Sounds Like Sunset once again forgot to attend the player auction. In 2008 the band shocked the PRL community by again failing to attend the 2008 PRL player auction, a move that did not go unnoticed by the PRL hierarchy and the band were forced to relinquish their coveted spot in Div1 of the PRL altogether. The band hope to be eligible to re-register with PRL in 2020 (after again forgetting to attend the 2019 player auction) and aim to start climbing their way back through the lower leagues until again finding PRL glory in Div1. As Phil Gould can often be quoted saying (though perhaps not in direct reference to the Singlet√∂nes) \\"dismiss them at your peril\\". Recent Activity Phil Usher (drums) joined the band in late 2018. Phil has an extensive background in music performance and composition, and currently teaches percussion full time in his hometown of Brisbane. Phil also writes, sings and plays guitar in Brisbane psych act Sacred Shrines, and played the same role in his previous band Grand Atlantic. Phil is also the current drummer for the legendary Brisbane act Screamfeeder. Phil has toured the US extensively in various bands since the mid-90s, and was even at one time called upon to play drums for Barry Manilow for a live stadium performance. Phil has been a dear friend of and enthusiastic advocate of Sounds Like Sunset for many years since watching the band's first ever live performance in 1997, and has arranged numerous Brisbane shows for the band as well as regularly providing booze, smokes, general good vibes and a floor for the routinely intoxicated and/or hungover band to sleep on. Tobey Doctor (drums) has played in various jazz, punk and defiantly \\"unlistenable\\" DIY sludge bands since the late 80s and early 90s. Tobey initially befriended the band when booking SLS for shows at The Phonenix Club, a small underground venue in Darlinghurst before joining Sounds Like Sunset after Vig kind of went missing after a while in the early 2000s. Tobey is arguably the most well known drummer of Sounds Like Sunset, and appeared on the band's second album Invisible and third album We Could Leave Tonight. Tobey provided the loose, wild, energetic Keith-Moon-like wildcard element both on and off the field for what was probably the most cohesive and well- known SLS lineup of Challinor/Hobson/Fevre/Doctor, and continues to be a dear friend and collaborator even years after his departure. Originally from Manly, Tobey made a sudden decision to move from Bondi Beach to the Melbourne suburb of Heidelberg in late 2016, and after spending a short time away from music and adjusting to life in a new city, he has recently been jamming with a number of Melbourne indie bands including the prolific artist/indie music mover & shaker JMS Harrison. Joseph Dews (drums) has played in a number of Sydney indie acts over the years including Founder, MachineMachine and The Woods Themselves, as well as his own ongoing solo projects. He currently plays guitar and sings in the band Peter Fonda, which also features current SLS member Travis Baird. Andrew Fevre (guitar) 1997 - 2008 left Sydney and spent a year traveling Europe before returning to Sydney and moving in with Tobey Doctor in Bondi Beach. Despite living with Tobey, he only rejoined SLS for a very short time before mostly abandoning music altogether and becoming a chef within the empire of celebrity chef Bill Granger. Andrew remains a dear friend of SLS. He is one of the first childhood friends of David Hobson, and taught Hobson his first ever swear words. During Fevre's European absence the band played on with various friends dropping into the lineup for a number of shows, including: * Scott Meikle (guitar) of Ben Aylward's post-Swirl band Beautiful World * Pete Farley (guitar) of the bands Gelbison and Toni Collette & The Finish, and * Travis Baird (guitar, keys) of the bands Founder, Melodie Nelson, El Mopa and The Woods Themselves, as well his ongoing solo project AFXJM which includes Patrick Matthews of Community Radio, Youth Group and (ex of) The Vines. Current band members now live in an area spread as far afield as Tempe, Collaroy Plateau, Concord (Sydney), Paddington (Brisbane) and the NSW Central Coast suburb of Wyoming.

He was the court organist to Charles IX of France and famous for his numerous chansons, which were representative of the late development of the form; his work in this regard was part of the early development of the style known as musique mesur√©e. He was also one of very few 16th century French composers of music for keyboard. In addition, he was a founding member of the Acad√©mie de Po√©sie et de Musique along with poet Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf, and he was one of the earliest composers to experiment with microtonal composition. Life Costeley was born in Fontanges-en- Auvergne, coincidentally the same town as contemporary composer Antoine de Bertrand. Nothing is known of him prior to his arrival in Paris in or before 1554, at which time he met, and became acquainted with the music of, such diverse figures as Jean Maillard, Jacques Arcadelt, and Sandrin. It was through Sandrin, who had recently worked in Italy, that Costeley probably became interested in the latest trends in Italian scholarship, particularly the theories of Nicola Vicentino, some of which involved composition using microtones. Costeley's only microtonal composition, Seigneur Dieu ta piti√©, was apparently written at exactly the time that Sandrin was in Paris. During the late 1550s Costeley rose in prominence in Parisian musical life, being published by Le Roy and Ballard in 1559. Since Le Roy was closely connected to the royal court through the family of Catherine de Clermont, who was to become the Countess of Retz, it is probable that his influence was significant in Costeley's rise. By 1560 Costeley had been appointed to the royal court, as organist, music teacher to the ten-year-old monarch, and composer of chansons for the royal chamber. In 1570 he published Musique de Guillaume Costeley, which contains almost all of his surviving works. In November of this same year King Henry III granted a charter for the formation of the Acad√©mie de po√©sie et de musique, of which Costeley was a founding member; there is, however, no evidence of any musical composition by Costeley between 1570 and his death in 1606. He was lauded by the group and took part in its activities (the king himself was probably a member, and attended some of their meetings, as did his successor Charles IX after 1574). Ba√Øf himself, the founder of the Acad√©mie, wrote several poems in Costeley's honor. However Costeley was no longer resident full-time at Paris. He had purchased a house in Evreux in Normandy, and married; the King only required him to be at court for the first three months of the year. Records of his property purchases indicate that he had become wealthy in service of the king. In 1581 he was made tax assessor at Evreux, and in 1592 his wife died and he married again. In 1597 he was named as an advisor to the king (\\"Conseiller du Roy\\"), and he seems to have remained in Evreux in semi-retirement until his death. Music and influence Costeley's surviving music amounts to about 100 chansons, as well as three motets and a fantasy for organ. Everything that he wrote can be dated to the period between 1554 and 1569.Godt, Grove, vol. 4 p.825-6. His motets, his only known sacred works, are for four and five voices and show the influence of Jean Maillard. A connection between the two is assumed since they both set the same unusual text (Domine salvum fac regem desiderium cordis ejus), and their settings contain apparently deliberate similarities. Costeley's chansons were by far the most famous part of his output, and they are in the Parisian chanson style of the time, with vivid word painting, along with a tendency to think harmonically rather than polyphonically ‚Äì as the age of purely polyphonic writing was coming to an end over most of Europe. The subject matter of the chansons is widely varied, as was true for most composers in the genre; some of the chansons are love songs, some are imitations of war or victory odes, and some are humorous or scatological. A peculiarity of Costeley's style ‚Äì and his notation ‚Äì is that he specified the accidentals he wanted applied to his music with great care and precision, something which was unusual prior to the middle of the 16th century, but which began to occur thereafter. He was fond of unusual melodic intervals, such as the diminished third, and probably wanted to make sure they were performed correctly. Some of his chansons, for example the earthy Grosse garce noire et tendre, use this interval prominently: in this work he uses it in an imitative passage. In other pieces he uses augmented intervals, including seconds, fourths, fifths, and sixths.Godt, Grove, vol. 4 p. 826 Even more unusual than his use of previously prohibited intervals, however, is his pioneering use of microtones. The chanson Seigneur Dieu ta piti√© of 1558 made use of justly tuned enharmonic intervals which, if played on a keyboard instrument, would require nineteen keys per octave; Costeley specifies that tuning such an instrument in equal \\"thirds of a tone\\" would be necessary to perform his chanson. This amounts to a specification of 19 equal temperament for a keyboard version of this chanson.Levy 1955, 215‚Äì16. While he was a member of Jean-Antoine de Ba√Øf's Academie de musique et de po√©sie, few of his works show the influence of, or intent to contribute to, the newly developed genre of musique mesur√©e. Only two compositions in the collection entitled Musique, published in 1570, show the metrical freedom which characterizes the style. One instrumental composition by Costeley has survived, and that only in a reconstructed version from a manuscript prepared by a non-musician. It is a short fantasie for organ (Fantasie [pour] orgue ou espinette faicte par monsieur Coteley [musicien] de la Chappelle du Roy), and is considered significant because it is one of the only surviving bits of keyboard music from late 16th-century France, other than pieces transcribed from vocal originals. The repertory of French keyboard players from the time seems to not have been written down, and certainly remained unpublished. Selected recordings * Airs et chansons au temps du roy Henry.

Sanskrit manuscript, 11-12th century. SudhanakumƒÅra (), mainly known as Sudhana and Shancai or Shancai Tongzi in Chinese, and translated as Child of Wealth, is the protagonist in the last and longest chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra. Sudhana appears in Buddhist, Taoist and folk stories; in most of them he is one of the acolytes of the bodhisattva Avalokite≈õvara (Guanyin) and is paired with Longn√º \\"Dragon Girl\\". He and Longn√º being depicted with Guanyin was most likely influenced by the Jade Maiden () and Golden Youth () who both appear in the iconography of the Jade Emperor. A fictionalised account of Sudhana is detailed in the classical novel Journey to the West, where Sudhana is portrayed as a villain, Red Boy, who is eventually subdued by Guanyin and becomes the bodhisattva's attendant. Gandavyuha Sutra Sudhana was a youth from India who was seeking bodhi (enlightenment). At the behest of the bodhisattva Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´, Sudhana takes a pilgrimage on his quest for enlightenment and studies under 53 \\"good friends\\", those who direct one towards the Way to Enlightenment. The 53 Stations of the T≈çkaid≈ç are a metaphor for Sudhana's journey. Avalokite≈õvara is the 28th spiritual master Sudhana visits at Mount Potalaka. Sudhana's quest reaches it climax at when he meets Maitreya, the Future Buddha, who snaps his fingers, thereby opening the doors to his marvelous tower. Within the tower, Sudhana experiences all the dharmadhatus (dimensions or worlds) in a fantastic succession of visions. The final master he visits is Samantabhadra, who teaches Sudhana that wisdom only exists for the sake of putting it into practice. The pilgrimage of Sudhana mirrors that of Gautama Buddha and the Gandavyuha sutra becomes very popular in China during the Song dynasty when it was adapted and circulated in small amply illustrated booklets, each page dedicated to one of Sudhana's spiritual teachers. Tale of the Southern Seas Chapter 18 of the Complete Tale of Guanyin and the Southern Seas (), a 16th-century Ming dynasty novel, is the first text that established a connection between Shancai and Guanyin. In the tale, Shancai was a disabled boy from India who was very interested in studying the Buddha's teachings. At that time, Guanyin had just achieved enlightenment and had retired to Mount Putuo, an island in the South China Sea. When Shancai heard that there was a bodhisattva on Mount Putuo, he quickly journeyed there to learn from her despite his disability. An altar for Guanyin worship. Guanyin, after having a discussion with Shancai, decided to test his resolve to fully study the Buddhist Dharma. She transformed the trees and plants into sword-wielding pirates, who ran up the hill to attack them. Guanyin took off and dashed to the edge of a cliff and jumped off, with the pirates still in pursuit. Shancai, in his desperation to save Guanyin, jumped off after her. Shancai and Guanyin managed to reascend the cliff, and at this point, Guanyin asked Shancai to look down. Shancai saw his mortal remains at the foot of the cliff. Guanyin then asked him to walk and Shancai found that he could walk normally and that he was no longer crippled. When he looked into a pool of water, he also discovered that he now had a handsome face. From that day onwards, Guanyin taught Shancai the entire Buddhist dharma. Guanyin and Shancai later encountered the third son of the Dragon King, and in the process, Guanyin earned Longn√º as a new acolyte. Precious Scrolls of Shancai and Longn√º A Yuan Dynasty hanging scroll depicting Shancai (walking on waves), the Filial Parrot (above), Guanyin and Longn√º. The Precious Scroll of Shancai and Longn√º (), an 18th or 19th century scroll comprising 29 folios, provides a different account on how Shancai and Longn√º became the acolytes of Guanyin. This tale seems to have a Taoist origin. The story is set in the Qianfu era of the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang. A virtuous minister Chen Bao and his wife Lady Han are still childless when they are getting older. When Chen rejects his wife's recommendation to take a concubine, she suggested that they pray to the bodhisattva Guanyin for help. Guanyin saw that the couple was destined to not have any children, so she ordered a Boy Who Brings Wealth () to be born into the family. Lady Han soon gave birth to a boy, who was named Chen Lian. She died when his son was only five years old. As a child, Chen Lian was not interested in civil or military pursuits, but rather, in religious enlightenment, much to his father's disapproval. At the age of seven, his father finally gave in to his pleas and allowed him to study under the tutelage of the Yellow Dragon Immortal (). Chen Lian was renamed to Shancai and became a dutiful apprentice of the immortal. However, he ignored all of his father's requests to visit home during his apprenticeship. When his father's 60th birthday approached, Shancai was once again asked to go home for a visit. As his master was away, Shancai decided to return home since it was a special occasion. On his way down a mountain path, he heard a voice crying out for help. Upon investigation, he saw that it was a snake trapped in a bottle for the last 18 years. The snake begged Shancai to release her, and after Shancai did so, she revealed her true form as a giant serpent and wanted to eat him. When Shancai protested at the snake's behaviour, she argued that ƒìn (ÊÅ©, an act of kindness) should be repaid with a feud, as is the way of nature. However, the snake agreed to bring the case before three judges. The first judge was the Golden Water Buffalo Star in human form. He agreed with the snake that given her past experiences with humans, she was right to repay Shancai's kindness by devouring him. The Buffalo related how he was forced out of Heaven by the bodhisattva K·π£itigarbha into the human world to help humans plough the fields. K·π£itigarbha vowed that if the humans did not repay one's kindness by showing kindness in return, his eyes would fall out. As the Buffalo landed face first on Earth, he lost all his upper front teeth. He later suffered greatly, and after years of toiling for his human master, he was butchered and eaten. Because of this, K·π£itigarbha's eyes fell out and landed on Earth and transformed into snails, which buffaloes trample on when they plough the fields. The second judge was the Taoist master Zhuang Zhou, who also sided with the snake. He cited an incident where he resurrected a dead man, who repaid his kindness by bringing him to court and accusing him of stealing his money. The third judge was a young girl. The girl told the snake that she could eat her as well if the snake could show them how it was able to fit into the bottle she was released from. As soon as the snake wormed itself back into the bottle, it was trapped. The girl then revealed herself as Guanyin. When the snake begged for mercy, Guanyin told her that if she wanted to be saved she must engage in religious exercises in the Grotto of the Sounds of the Flood (present-day Fayu Temple) on Mount Putuo. Around this time, Guanyin also gained a new disciple, the Filial Parrot. Three years later, when Guanyin returned to Mount Putuo, she appeared to Shancai in the middle of the ocean. Shancai joined her in walking across the sea and became her acolyte. With the confirmation of his faith, Shancai's parents were reborn in Heaven. As for the snake, she committed herself to seven years of austerity and eventually cleansed itself of venom and produced a pearl. She transformed into Longn√º and joined Shancai as an acolyte of Guanyin. As Red Boy Sudhana is the Buddhist name of Red Boy, also known as Honghai'er (), an antagonist in the classical novel Journey to the West. Red Boy was the son of Princess Iron Fan and Bull Demon King. As an exchange for punishment after kidnapping Tang Sanzang and Zhu Bajie, as well as irreverently usurping Guanyin's lotus seat, Red Boy surrendered to Guanyin and became her attendant.

It extends from an interchange with Interstate 95 in the independent city of Richmond north to an intersection with U.S. Route 1 in the Lakeside area of central Henrico County. For a portion of its history, the road served as an early western highway bypass of the downtown area of the City of Richmond through portions of Chesterfield and Henrico counties. Known during that period as the area's \\"Belt Boulevard\\", the name is still applied to some streets along the former bypass routing. SR 161 now located entirely in the City of Richmond and Henrico County. Route description View north along SR 161 at US 33 and US 250 in Richmond =Southside Richmond= SR 161 begins at a partial cloverleaf interchange from I-95 exit 69 to an intersection with Walmsley Boulevard and Commerce Road. The state highway curves right onto Commerce Road then turning left at Bells Road near Phillip Morris USA. The state route curves through the Phillip Morris area then crosses over CSX's Bellwood Subdivision to an intersection with Jefferson Davis Highway (US 1/US 301). SR 161 keeps straight across the Jefferson Davis area, crosses over CSX's Clopton Lead, then turns right onto Belt Boulevard near the Parnell Industrial Area. The state route briefly parallels CSX's North End Subdivision as it passes its former alignment with Terminal Avenue. The state route then pass a partial cloverleaf interchange with Hopkins Road before approaching the Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center at SR 10 (Broad Rock Boulevard). The state route turns right and the two highways run concurrently along four-lane divided Broad Rock Boulevard. The two highways diverge just northwest of McGuire Hospital's entrance. The highway heads northwest towards the former McGuire Circle at US 360 (Hull Street Road) then keeping straight passing Historic Southside Plaza and Circle Shopping Centers. About a mile further northwest is a diamond interchange with US 60 (Midlothian Turnpike) where the highway name changes from Belt Boulevard to Westover Hills Boulevard. The highway keeps straight north past a busy intersection with Forest Hill Avenue in the Westover Hills area before approaching the Toll Boulevard Bridge. The bridge crosses over Norfolk Southern Railway's Richmond District, James River, and CSX's Rivanna Subdivision before reaching the toll plaza. =Northside Richmond= SR 161 crosses through the toll plaza and curves around Maymont Park on the right, Dogwood Dell on the left and through the south side of William Byrd Park as Park Drive. SR 161 turns right onto a four-lane divided Blanton Avenue. It then passes an intersection with Douglasdale Road which has access to I-195 (Beltline Expressway) and toll SR 76 (Powhite Parkway). The highway reduces to two lanes before curving right to Grant Street and then curving left onto S. Arthur Ashe Boulevard where it is once again a four-lane divided highway. Upon departure of Byrd Park near Boat Lake is an interchange only to the eastbound lanes of Toll SR 195 (Downtown Expressway) to downtown Richmond. To access I-195 (Beltline Expressway) northbound, motorist would have to use Idlewood Avenue's west leg after crossing over the Downtown Expressway. SR 161 approaches a one-way pair SR 147 east of Carytown where the eastbound lanes are known as Cary Street and the westbound: Main Street (east leg) and Ellwood Avenue (west leg). The crossing of Main Street is where SR 161 transitions from South to North Arthur Ashe Boulevard. The state highway continues north passing the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (SR 315), the eastern terminus of SR 6 (Kensington Avenue), and around the Stonewall Jackson monument on historic Monument Avenue before reaching US 33/US 250 Broad Street. The state highway continues northeast crossing over CSX's Richmond Terminal Subdivision, passing Greyhound Lines Richmond station on the left and The Diamond on the right. Near the Arthur Ashe Athletic Center is an intersection with Robin Hood Road to the east and Ellen Road to the west. To access I-95 south and I-64 east, motorist would use Robin Hood Road. SR 161 keeps straight crossing under I-95/I-64 to its interchange with the north and westbound lanes (I-95 exit 78). Upon reaching the intersection of Westwood Avenue with the southeast leg being Brookland Parkway, the highway changes names to Hermitage Road. The highway then continues north to an intersection with SR 197 (Laburnum Avenue). There is a monument statue of AP Hill in the center of the intersection. The highway heads north through a residential zone to another interchange with I-95 (southbound only) to I-64 (I-95 exit 80) before crossing into Henrico County near Joseph Bryan Park. =Henrico County= SR 161 enters Henrico County as a four-lane divided highway (Lakeside Avenue) through a local business area to its intersection with Dumbarton Road. The highway heads north through another residential zone and some restaurants toward the intersection with the eastern terminus of SR 356 (Hilliard Road). The north leg of the intersection is the unnumbered Lakeside Avenue to the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. SR 161 turns right onto Hilliard Road and heads east to its northern terminus with US 1 (Brook Road). History = An early highway bypass of Richmond = In the pre-World War II era, the original Robert E. Lee Memorial Bridge (replaced in the 1980s), crossing the James River at Richmond was a toll bridge. Traffic through Richmond on U.S. Route 1 and 301 was often highly congested with Florida-New York and other east coast travelers. In the city, the path of US 1/301 passed miles of tourist homes along Jefferson Davis Highway south of the river and Chamberlayne Avenue north of the river. By 1934, a combination of roads known collectively as the \\"Belt Boulevard\\" formed a western bypass of Richmond's most congested areas along the US 1/301 corridor, crossing the James River on Richmond's privately owned Boulevard Bridge, a toll bridge built in 1925. The Belt Boulevard offered an alternative to downtown Richmond's traffic, with ends at US 1 south and north of the city limits in Chesterfield and Henrico counties, respectively, at that time. (Part of the route south of the James River was annexed from Chesterfield County in 1944; the remainder in 1970, so the road in that area is now entirely in Richmond). The name Belt Boulevard was apparently derived from the \\"Belt Line\\" tracks of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad (RF&P;) and Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) which had also been built some years earlier to bypass a congestion point and river crossing in downtown Richmond at Byrd Street Station. The road very roughly parallels the belt line railroad about a mile or so east for a large portion of its routing. = Route description = The route began at U.S. Routes 1 and 301 at Terminal Avenue, a location known as \\"Stop 9\\" on the Richmond-Petersburg Interurban Electric Railway. A large neon sign and arrow at the intersection of Terminal Avenue and Jefferson Davis Highway on the southwest corner urged northbound motorists to consider the bypass. The sign survived into the 1970s. It followed Terminal Avenue northwesterly in Chesterfield County to a short road section actually named Belt Boulevard, which it followed about a mile, meeting State Route 10 and sharing it around the north side of the former Speedway which was located at the current site of McGuire Hospital. Resuming its own roadway, Belt Boulevard turned almost due north. It met U.S. Route 360 at McGuire Circle and U.S. Route 60 about a mile further north. In the late 1940s, an overpass for U.S. 60 and a partial cloverleaf interchange was built at this location. About 1/2 mile north of U.S. 60, the road crossed the original Belt Line railroad tracks, a routing which was itself bypassed by a newer alignment of the belt line by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad at the time Broad Street Station was opened around 1917. After crossing the railroad, Belt Boulevard connected with Westover Hills Boulevard. It continued north through the newly developed Westover Hills community and the Forest Hill Avenue commercial corridor to reach the high bluffs along the south side of the James River. At this location, Belt Boulevard crossed the Southern Railway (along the south bank), the James River, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and James River and Kanawha Canal (along the north bank) via the Boulevard Bridge, with tolls collected initially at a midpoint on the narrow two-lane bridge itself. The road made landfall just east of Maymont Park and climbing the bluff there, wound around a city reservoir through Byrd Park to connect with the south end of Richmond's major connector street known simply as Boulevard (or \\"The Boulevard\\"), a major north-south thoroughfare. It followed that roadway north past a statue to honor Christopher Columbus and crossed Monument Avenue, where a statue of Confederate Major General Stonewall Jackson had been erected. After crossing U.S. Route 33 and U.S. Route 250 at Broad Street, about a mile further north it reached Westwood Circle. The road followed Hermitage Road north, passing another monument for (and the tomb of) Confederate General Ambrose Powell Hill at Laburnum Avenue. the roadway entered Henrico County on Lakeside Avenue near the main entrance to the city's Joseph Bryan Park. It ran through the Lakeside area to Hillard Road and crossing the Richmond-Ashland Railway (an electric interurban) to end at an intersection with Brook Road in Henrico County north of Richmond. = Route numbering history = The northern portion of the Belt Boulevard route in Richmond from Boulevard and its intersections with Main and Cary Streets north to U.S. Route 1 in Henrico County was originally numbered as Virginia State Route 432. In 1933, it was renumbered as Virginia State Route 161. The SR-161 route numbering was assigned south of State Route 147 during World War II. = Traffic circles = Although promoted as a bypass of heavy traffic near downtown Richmond, the Belt Boulevard route included two of the Richmond area's busier traffic circles. *McGuire Circle was located at the intersection of Hull Street Road (U.S. Route 360) in Chesterfield County, where major shopping centers were developed in the post World War II period, notably Southside Plaza Shopping Center, opened in 1958. McGuire Circle has two lanes in the center and heavy through truck traffic on U.S. Route 360, leading to some spectacular and deadly accidents, with overturned tractor-trailer rigs not uncommon. *Westwood Circle was located at the five-pointed junction of north stub end of \\"the Boulevard\\", and the through streets of Hermitage Road and Westwood Avenue. Although also heavily congested, this circle did not have the through truck traffic of McGuire Circle and was less notorious for serious collisions. = 1958: replaced as a bypass, a new suburban connector = The Belt Boulevard as a bypass of Richmond was largely replaced by the new Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike, a toll road which opened in 1958. However, a portion of the southern end of SR 161 retains the Belt Boulevard name, and it is in current use there. A major intersection was at U.S. Route 360, and after a mile of residential housing, another at U.S. Route 60 (Midlothian Turnpike). The area in between these two points along Belt Boulevard was to become valuable commercial property, anchored by the massive Southside Plaza Shopping Center in 1957. Businesses replacing homes included a Shoney's Big Boy restaurant, a Bill's Barbecue restaurant (a local chain), Ford and Dodge automobile dealerships, a Putt-Putt miniature golf course, and two bowling alleys. In a short time, the equivalent of a small town business district materialized, even as the road changed from a through traffic bypass to a suburban connector street. = Post-1970 changes, current routing = On January 1, 1970, the City of Richmond annexed most of the southern portion, which had been in Chesterfield County. Although it formerly followed Terminal Avenue, in the 1990s, the VA-161 routing was relocated and extended along newly rebuilt sections of Belt Boulevard and Bells Road, which the route now follows across Jefferson Davis Highway (US 1/301) to meet Interstate 95 (at exit 69). Both traffic circles had been replaced by traffic signals by the mid-1970s. The area near the larger is still known locally as McGuire Circle, even though the circle has been gone for over 30 years. In the 1980s, the railroad tracks and grade crossing south of Westover Hills were removed. Two railroad grade crossings remain on the newer Bells Road portion of SR-161, on a spur line (the former ACL main line into Manchester and Richmond) and the former Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) S-line of CSX near the major Phillip Morris complex in South Richmond.

He was a veteran of the War of 1812 and the first Jewish Commodore of the United States Navy.At the time, Commodore was the highest rank in the U.S. Navy; it would be roughly equivalent to the modern-day rank of Admiral. He was instrumental in helping to end the Navy's practice of flogging, and during his half-century-long service prevailed against the antisemitism he faced among some of his fellow naval officers. An admirer of Thomas Jefferson, Levy purchased and began the restoration of Monticello in the 1830s; he also commissioned and donated a statue of Jefferson that is now located in the Capitol Rotunda; it is the only privately commissioned artwork in the Capitol. Early years Levy was born on April 22, 1792, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Michael and Rachel Phillips Levy. He had two older siblings. Uriah Levy was close to his maternal grandfather, Jonas Phillips, who had emigrated to the United States in 1756 from Germany, and fought with the Philadelphia militia in the American Revolution. His maternal great-great grandfather, Dr. Samuel Ribeiro Nunes, a Portuguese physician, was among a group of 42 Sephardic Jews who escaped the Spanish Inquisition of the early 16th century and migrated to England, where they settled. Descendants of that group sailed from London in 1733 and helped found the city of Savannah, Georgia, where they lived for generations.See Marc Leepson, Saving Monticello: The Levy Family's Epic Quest to Rescue the House That Jefferson Built (Free Press, 2001), pp. 47‚Äì50 Levy's younger brother was Jonas Phillips Levy, who became a merchant and sea captain. He was the father of five, including the Congressman Jefferson Monroe Levy. Family stories have it that Levy ran away from home at the age of ten and ended up serving on various vessels as a cabin boy, returning home to Philadelphia at age 13 for his bar mitzvah. Naval career In 1806, he apprenticed as a sailor and was a cabin boy. Later he became a sailing master in the U.S. Navy, and fought in the Barbary Wars. At the age of 21, he volunteered for the War of 1812 and was commissioned as a sailing master on October 21, 1812. He was a supernumerary sailing master on the , which interdicted British ships in the English Channel. The Argus seized more than 20 vessels before being captured on August 14, 1813; her captain was killed, and the crew, including Levy, were taken prisoner. They were imprisoned by Great Britain for sixteen months until the end of the war. During his captivity, Levy had difficulty obtaining a subsidy and parole because his status as a supernumerary was not understood by the British Transport Board. Upon returning to the United States, Levy served aboard the as second master. Levy was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1817. This commission was a rare feat, given that he started as a cabin boy and worked his way to being a sailing master. He became a master commandant in 1837, and captain in 1844. During his service in the U.S. Navy, Levy faced considerable antisemitism. He reacted to slights and was court-martialed six times, and once demoted from the rank of Captain. Twice, he was dismissed from the Navy, but reinstated. He defended his conduct in his handling of naval affairs before a Court of Inquiry and in 1855 was restored to his former position. Later, Levy commanded the Mediterranean Squadron. As a squadron commander he was given the title of commodore, then the highest position in the U.S. Navy. Levy was instrumental in abolishing flogging in the U.S. Navy, although his position was considered controversial at the time. He also helped gain the support of the U.S Congress in passing an anti-flogging bill in 1850. Levy spent only 16 years of his 49 year naval career in active service. The rest of time, he was listed as \\"waiting orders\\", meaning that he could be called to serve at any time. Although Levy served during the first year of the American Civil War, he was not given an active assignment at that time. Levy became wealthy by investing in New York City's real estate market.Leepson, pp. 112‚Äì113 Philanthropic activities Levy undertook various philanthropic endeavors, many of which were in support of Jewish-American life. In 1854 he sponsored the new Jewish seminary of the B'nai Jeshurun Educational Institute in New York. In 1833, New York City gave Levy the Key to the City after he presented the city with a patinated plaster statue of Thomas Jefferson, the one used to cast the bronze version he gave to the U.S. Congress. Before the statue was set up in New York City Hall, Levy installed it in a building on Broadway and charged admission to view it. The proceeds were used to buy bread for the city's poor. Monticello Levy's mother's grave Levy was a great admirer of Thomas Jefferson: > I consider Thomas Jefferson to be one of the greatest men in history, the > author of the Declaration and an absolute democrat. He serves as an > inspiration to millions of Americans. He did much to mould our Republic in a > form in which a man's religion does not make him ineligible for political or > governmental life. The Monticello estate had been owned by more than one person since Jefferson's death, and considerable property had been sold off. In 1834, Levy paid $2,700 for the Monticello‚Äîwhich is equivalent to $ in today's dollars. Levy undertook to have the long-neglected home repaired, restored, and preserved. He also bought hundreds of additional acres that had been part of the plantation, to add to what was left. Levy used Monticello as a vacation home. From 1837 to 1839, his widowed mother Rachel Levy lived there until her death; she is buried along Mulberry Row, the main plantation street adjacent to the mansion.Leepson, pp. 70‚Äì71 Upon his death in 1862, Levy left Monticello to the American people to be used as an agricultural school for the orphans of Navy warrant officers. Because of the American Civil War, Congress refused to accept the donation. The Confederate government seized and sold the property; lawyers for Levy's estate recovered the property after the war. Following two lawsuits by family members over Levy's will, with 47 parties to the suit, in 1879 his nephew Jefferson Monroe Levy bought out the other heirs for $10,050, and took control of Monticello.Leepson, p. 110. He had it repaired and restored. He sold it in 1923 to the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, which has renovated and restored the property as a house museum. Statue of Jefferson in the Capitol. The Levy family's role in preserving Monticello was downplayed by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation through much of the 20th century, which Urofsky suggests was due to anti-Semitic views among some of its board and members. In 1985, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation restored the gravesite of Rachel Levy and honored descendants of the family in a ceremony at Monticello.Leepson, pp. 253‚Äì254. The Foundation also celebrates the roles of Uriah P. Levy and Jefferson Monroe Levy in helping preserve and restore Monticello, including on-site information about their roles. Jefferson statue In another tribute to Jefferson, Levy commissioned a bronze statue of the President while studying naval tactics in France; he donated it to Congress in 1834. The statue, which once stood on the White House North Lawn from 1834‚Äì1873 and currently stands in the Capitol Rotunda, is the only privately commissioned piece of artwork in the Capitol. Personal life Levy's brother, Jonas Phillip Levy, served as the fifth president of the Washington Hebrew Congregation in Washington, DC from 1857-1858. At the age of 61, Levy married his 18-year-old niece Virginia Lopez, whose father had recently died.http://www.marcleepson.com/savingmonticello/levys/genealogy.html According to biographer Marc Leepson (Saving Monticello, 2001), Levy \\"was following an ancient, if obscure, Jewish tradition that obligates the closest unmarried male relative of a recently orphaned or widowed woman in financial difficulties to marry her.\\" (See also letter, levirate marriage) Levy died on March 26, 1862, and was buried in Beth Olam Cemetery, Ridgewood (Queens), associated with the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue.

It was discovered by Professors Tun-Hou Lee and Myron \\"Max\\" Essex of the Harvard School of Public Health in 1988. The 120 in its name comes from its molecular weight of 120 kDa. Gp120 is essential for virus entry into cells as it plays a vital role in attachment to specific cell surface receptors. These receptors are DC-SIGN, Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan and a specific interaction with the CD4 receptor, particularly on helper T-cells. Binding to CD4 induces the start of a cascade of conformational changes in gp120 and gp41 that lead to the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. Binding to CD4 is mainly electrostatic although there are van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds. right Gp120 is coded by the HIV env gene, which is around 2.5 kb long and codes for around 850 amino acids.Kuiken, C., Leitner, T., Foley, B., et al. (2008). \\"HIV Sequence Compendium\\", Los Alamos National Laboratory. The primary env product is the protein gp160, which gets cleaved to gp120 (~480 amino acids) and gp41 (~345 amino acids) in the endoplasmatic reticulum by the cellular protease furin. The crystal structure of core gp120 shows an organization with an outer domain, an inner domain with respect to its termini and a bridging sheet. Gp120 is anchored to the viral membrane, or envelope, via non-covalent bonds with the transmembrane glycoprotein, gp41. Three gp120s and gp41s combine in a trimer of heterodimers to form the envelope spike, which mediates attachment to and entry into the host cell. Variability  Since gp120 plays a vital role in the ability of HIV-1 to enter CD4+ cells, its evolution is of particular interest. Many neutralizing antibodies bind to sites located in variable regions of gp120, so mutations in these regions will be selected for strongly. The diversity of env has been shown to increase by 1-2% per year in HIV-1 group M and the variable units are notable for rapid changes in amino acid sequence length. Increases in gp120 variability result in significantly elevated levels of viral replication, indicating an increase in viral fitness in individuals infected by diverse HIV-1 variants. Further studies have shown that variability in potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGSs) also result in increased viral fitness. PNGSs allow for the binding of long-chain carbohydrates to the high variability regions of gp120, so the authors hypothesize that the number of PNGSs in env might affect the fitness of the virus by providing more or less sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. The presence of large carbohydrate chains extending from gp120 might obscure possible antibody binding sites. The boundaries of the potential to add and eliminate PNGSs are naively explored by growing viral populations following each new infection. While the transmitting host has developed a neutralizing antibody response to gp120, the newly infected host lacks immune recognition of the virus. Sequence data shows that initial viral variants in an immunologically na√Øve host have few glycosylation sites and shorter exposed variable loops. This may facilitate viral ability to bind host cell receptors. As the host immune system develops antibodies against gp120, immune pressures seem to select for increased glycosylation, particularly on the exposed variable loops of gp120. Consequently, insertions in env, which confer more PNGSs on gp120 may be more tolerated by the virus as higher glycan density promotes the viral ability to evade antibodies and thus promotes higher viral fitness. In considering how much PNGS density could theoretically change, there may be an upper bound to PNGS number due to its inhibition of gp120 folding, but if the PNGS number decreases substantially, then the virus is too easily detected by neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, a stabilizing selection balance between low and high glycan densities is likely established. A lower number of bulky glycans improves viral replication efficiency and higher number on the exposed loops aids host immune evasion via disguise. The relationship between gp120 and neutralizing antibodies is an example of Red Queen evolutionary dynamics. Continuing evolutionary adaptation is required for the viral envelope protein to maintain fitness relative to the continuing evolutionary adaptations of the host immune neutralizing antibodies, and vice versa, forming a coevolving system. Vaccine target Since CD4 receptor binding is the most obvious step in HIV infection, gp120 was among the first targets of HIV vaccine research. Efforts to develop HIV vaccines targeting gp120, however, have been hampered by the chemical and structural properties of gp120, which make it difficult for antibodies to bind to it. gp120 can also easily be shed from the surface of the virus and captured by T cells due to its loose binding with gp41. A conserved region in the gp120 glycoprotein that is involved in the metastable attachment of gp120 to CD4 has been identified and targeting of invariant region has been achieved with a broadly neutralising antibody, IgG1-b12. NIH research published in Science reports the isolation of 3 antibodies that neutralize 90% of HIV-1 strains at the CD4bs region of gp120, potentially offering a therapeutic and vaccine strategy. However, most antibodies that bind the CDbs region of gp120 do not neutralize HIV, and rare ones that do such as IgG1-b12 have unusual properties such as asymmetry of the Fab arms or in their positioning. Unless a gp120-based vaccine can be designed to elicit antibodies with strongly neutralizing antiviral properties, there is concern that breakthrough infection leading to humoral production of high levels of non-neutralizing antibodies targeting the CD4 binding site of gp120 is associated with faster disease progression to AIDS.  Competition  The protein gp120 is necessary during the initial binding of HIV to its target cell. Consequently, anything which binds to gp120 or its targets can physically block gp120 from binding to a cell. Only one such agent, Maraviroc, which binds the co-receptor CCR5 is currently licensed and in clinical use. No agent targeting gp120's main first cellular interaction partner, CD4, is currently licensed since interfering with such a central molecule of the immune system can cause toxic side effects, such as the anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody OKT4. Targeting gp120 itself has proven extremely difficult due to its high degree of variability and shielding. Fostemsavir (BMS-663068) is a methyl phosphate prodrug of the small molecule inhibitor BMS-626529, which prevents viral entry by binding to the viral envelope gp120 and interfering with virus attachment to the host CD4 receptor.aidsinfo.nih.gov/drugs/508/bms-663068/0/professional  HIV dementia  The HIV viral protein gp120 induces apoptosis of neuronal cells by inhibiting levels of furin and tissue plasminogen activator, enzymes responsible for converting pBDNF to mBDNF. gp120 induces mitochondrial-death proteins like caspases which may influence the upregulation of the death receptor Fas leading to apoptosis of neuronal cells, gp120 induces oxidative stress in the neuronal cells, and it is also known to activate STAT1 and induce interleukins IL-6 and IL-8 secretion in neuronal cells.

This attitude is the accumulation of a variety of fundamental and technical factors, including price history, economic reports, seasonal factors, and national and world events. If investors expect upward price movement in the stock market, the sentiment is said to be bullish. On the contrary, if the market sentiment is bearish, most investors expect downward price movement. Market participants who maintain a static sentiment, regardless of market conditions, are described as permabulls and permabears respectively. Market sentiment is usually considered as a contrarian indicator: what most people expect is a good thing to bet against. Market sentiment is used because it is believed to be a good predictor of market moves, especially when it is more extreme.Sentiment: A Meaningful Shift For Stock Bulls?  Seeking Alpha Seeking Alpha Very bearish sentiment is usually followed by the market going up more than normal, and vice versa. Market sentiment is monitored with a variety of technical and statistical methods such as the number of advancing versus declining stocks and new highs versus new lows comparisons. A large share of the overall movement of an individual stock has been attributed to market sentiment.Thomas Dorsey, Point and Figure Charting, Sentiment has a \\"66% influence on the overall movement of an individual stock\\" The stock market's demonstration of the situation is often described as all boats float or sink with the tide, in the popular Wall Street phrase \\"the trend is your friend\\". In the last decade, investors are also known to measure market sentiment through the use of news analytics, which include sentiment analysis on textual stories about companies and sectors.  Theory of investor attention  A particular thread of scientific literature connects results from behavioural finance, changes of investor attention on financial markets, and fundamental principles of asset pricing: Barberis et al. (1998), Barberis & Thaler (2003), and Baker & Wurgler (2007). The authors argue that behavioural patterns of retail investors have a significant impact on market returns. At least five main approaches to measuring investor attention are known today in scientific literature: financial market-based measures, survey-based sentiment indexes, textual sentiment data from specialized on-line resources, Internet search behavior, and non-economic factors. = First approach = According to the first approach, investor attention can be approximated with particular financial market-based measures. According to Gervais et al. (2001) and Hou et al. (2009), trading volume is a good proxy for investor sentiment. High (low) trading volume on a particular stock leads to appreciating (depreciating) of its price. Extreme one-day returns are also reported to draw investors‚Äô attention (Barber & Odean (2008)). Noise traders tend to buy (sell) stocks with high (low) returns. Whaley (2001) and Baker & Wurgler (2007) suggest Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX) as an alternative market sentiment measure. Credit Suisse Fear Barometer (CSFB) is based on prices of zero- premium collars that expire in three months. This index is sometimes used as an alternative to VIX index. The Acertus Market Sentiment Indicator (AMSI) incorporates five variables (in descending order of weight in the indicator): Price/Earnings Ratio (a measure of stock market valuations); price momentum (a measure of market psychology); Realized Volatility (a measure of recent historical risk); High Yield Bond Returns (a measure of credit risk); and the TED spread (a measure of systemic financial risk). Each of these factors provides a measure of market sentiment through a unique lens, and together they may offer a more robust indicator of market sentiment. Closed-end fund discount (the case when net asset value of a mutual fund does not equal to its market price) reported to be possible measure of investor attention (Zweig (1973) and Lee et al. (1991)). The studies suggest an evidence that changes in discounts of closed-end funds are highly correlated with fluctuations in investor sentiment. Brown et al. (2003) investigate daily mutual fund flow as possible measure of investor attention.Gloomy fund investors - MarketWatch According to Da et al. (2014), \\"...individual investors switch from equity funds to bond funds when negative sentiment is high.\\" Dividend premium (the difference between the average book-to-market ratios of dividend paying and not paying stocks) potentially can be a good predictor for investor sentiment (Baker & Wurgler (2004) and Vieira (2011)). Retail investor trades data is also reported to be able to represent investor attention (Kumar & Lee (2006)). The study shows that retail investor transactions \\"...are systematically correlated ‚Äî that is, individuals buy (or sell) stocks in concert\\". Initial public offering (IPO) of a company generates a big amount of information that can potentially be used to proxy investor sentiment. Ljungqvist et al. (2006) and Baker & Wurgler (2007) report IPO first-day returns and IPO volume the most promising candidates for predicting investor attention to a particular stock. It is not surprising that high investments in advertisement of a particular company results in a higher investor attention to corresponding stock (Grullon et al. (2004)). The authors in Chemmanur & Yan (2009) provide an evidence that \\"...a greater amount of advertising is associated with a larger stock return in the advertising year but a smaller stock return in the year subsequent to the advertising year\\". Equity issues over total new issues ratio, insider trading data, and other financial indicators are reported in Baker & Wurgler (2007) to be useful in investor attention measurement procedure. All mentioned above market-based measures have a one important drawback. In particular, according to Da et al. (2014): \\"Although market-based measures have the advantage of being readily available at a relatively high frequency, they have the disadvantage of being the equilibrium outcome of many economic forces other than investor sentiment.\\" In other words, one can never be sure that a particular market-based indicator was driven due to investor attention. Moreover, some indicators can work pro-cyclical. For example, a high trading volume can draw an investor attention. As a result, the trading volume grows even higher. This, in turn, leads to even bigger investor attention. Overall, market-based indicators are playing a very important role in measuring investor attention. However, an investor should always try to make sure that no other variables can drive the result. = Second way = The second way to proxy for investor attention can be to use survey-based sentiment indexes. Among most known indexes should be mentioned University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, and UBS/Gallup Index of Investor Optimism. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is based on at least 500 telephone interviews. The survey contains fifty core questions. The Consumer Confidence Index has ten times more respondents (5000 households). However, the survey consists of only five main questions concerning business, employment, and income conditions. The questions can be answered with only three options: \\"positive\\", \\"negative\\" or \\"neutral\\". A sample of 1000 households with total investments equal or higher than $10,000 are interviewed to construct UBS/Gallup Index of Investor Optimism. Mentioned above survey-based sentiment indexes were reported to be good predictors for financial market indicators (Brown & Cliff (2005)). However, according to Da et al. (2014), using such sentiment indexes can have significant restrictions. First, most of the survey-based data sets are available at weekly or monthly frequency. At the same time, most of the alternative sentiment measures are available at a daily frequency. Second, there is a little incentive for respondents to answer question in such surveys carefully and truthfully (Singer (2002)). To sum up, survey-based sentiment indexes can be helpful in predicting financial indicators. However, the usage of such indexes has specific drawbacks and can be limited in some cases. = Third direction = In the 1920s, the market sentiment of railway companies was bullish as it was a new market, and investors saw long-term prospects. Under the third direction, researchers propose to use text mining and sentiment analysis algorithms to extract information about investors‚Äô mood from social networks, media platforms, blogs, newspaper articles, and other relevant sources of textual data (sometimes referred as news analytics). A thread of publications (Barber & Odean (2008), Dougal et al. (2012), and Ahern & Sosyura (2015)) report a significant influence of financial articles and sensational news on behavior of stock prices. It is also not surprising, that such popular sources of news as Wall Street Journal, New York Times or Financial Times have a profound influence on the market. The strength of the impact can vary between different columnists even inside a particular journal (Dougal et al. (2012)). Tetlock (2007) suggests a successful measure of investors‚Äô mood by counting the number of \\"negative\\" words in a popular Wall Street Journal column \\"Abreast of the market\\". Zhang et al. (2011) and Bollen et al. (2011) report Twitter to be an extremely important source of sentiment data, which helps to predict stock prices and volatility. The usual way to analyze the influence of the data from micro-blogging platforms on behavior of stock prices is to construct special mood tracking indexes. The easiest way would be to count the number of \\"positive\\" and \\"negative\\" words in each relevant tweet and construct a combined indicator based on this data. Nasseri et al. (2014) reports the predictive power of StockTwits (Twitter-like platform specialized on exchanging trading-related opinions) data with respect to behavior of stock prices. An alternative, but more demanding, way is to engage human experts to annotate a large number of tweets with the expected stock moves, and then construct a machine learning model for prediction. The application of the event study methodology to Twitter mood shows significant correlation to cumulative abnormal returns (Sprenger et al. (2014), Ranco et al. (2015), Gabrov≈°ek et al. (2017) ). Karabulut (2013) reports Facebook to be a good source of information about investors‚Äô mood. Overall, most popular social networks, finance-related media platforms, magazines, and journals can be a valuable source of sentiment data, summarized in Peterson (2016). However, important to notice that it is relatively more difficult to collect such type of data (in most cases a researcher needs a special software). In addition, analysis of such data can also require deep machine learning and data mining knowledge (Hotho et al. (2005)). = Fourth road = Islamabad Stock Exchange Bull The fourth road is an important source of information about investor attention is the Internet search behavior of households. This approach is supported by results from Simon (1955), who concludes that people start their decision making process by gathering relevant information. Publicly available data on search volumes for most Internet search services starts from the year 2004. Since that time many authors showed the usefulness of such data in predicting investor attention and market returns (Da et al. (2014), Preis et al. (2013), and Curme et al. (2014)). Most studies are using Google Trends (GT) service in order to extract search volume data and investigate investor attention. The usefulness of Internet search data was also proved based on Yahoo! Corporation data (Bordino et al. (2012)). The application of Internet search data gives promising results in solving different financial problems. The authors in Kristoufek (2013b) discuss the application of GT data in portfolio diversification problem. Proposed in the paper diversification procedure is based on the assumption that the popularity of a particular stock in Internet queries is correlated with the riskiness of this stock. The author reports that such diversification procedure helps significantly improve portfolio returns. Da et al. (2014) and Dimpfl & Jank (2015) investigate a predictive power of GT data for two most popular volatility measures: realized volatility (RV) and CBOE daily market volatility index (VIX). Both studies report positive and significant dependence between Internet search data and volatility measures. Bordino et al. (2012) and Preis et al. (2010) reveal the ability of Internet search data to predict trading volumes in the US stock markets. According to Bordino et al. (2012), \\"...query volumes anticipate in many cases peaks of trading by one day or more.\\" Some researchers find the usefulness of GT data in predicting volatility on foreign currency market (Smith (2012)). An increasingly important role of Internet search data is admitted in cryptocurrency (e.g. BitCoin) prices forecasting (Kristoufek (2013a)). Google Trends data is also reported to be a good predictor for daily mutual fund flows. Da et al. (2014) concludes that such type of sentiment data \\"...has significant incremental predictive power for future daily fund flow innovations of both equity and bond funds.\\" One more promising source of Internet search data is the number of visits of finance- related Wikipedia pages (Wikipedia page statistics) (Moat et al. (2013) and Kristoufek (2013a)). To sum up, the Internet search behavior of households is relatively new and promising proxy for investor attention. Such type of sentiment data does not require additional information from other sources and can be used in scientific studies independently. = Fifth source = \\"All boats float or sink with the tide.\\" Finally the fifth source of investor attention can also depend on some non-economic factors. Every day many non- economic events (e.g. news, weather, health condition, etc.) influence our mood, which, in term, influence the level of our risk aversion and trading behavior. Edmans et al. (2007) discuss the influence of sport events on investors‚Äô trading behavior. The authors report a strong evidence of abnormally negative stock returns after losses in major soccer competitions. The loss effect is also valid after international cricket, rugby, and basketball games. Kaplanski & Levy (2010) investigate the influence of bad news (aviation disasters) on stock prices. The authors conclude that a bad piece of news (e.g. about aviation disaster) can cause significant drop in stock returns (especially for small and risky stocks). The evidence that the number of sunlight minutes in a particular day influence the behavior of a trader is presented in Akhtari (2011) and Hirshleifer & Shumway (2003). The authors conclude that the \\"sunshine effect\\" is statistically significant and robust to different model specifications. The influence of temperature on stock returns is discussed in Cao & Wei (2005). According to the results in the mentioned study, there is a negative dependence between temperature and stock returns on the whole range of temperature (i.e. the returns are higher when the weather is cold). A seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is also known to be a predictor of investors‚Äô mood (Kamstra et al. (2003)). This is an expected result because SAD incorporates the information about weather conditions. Some researchers go even further and reveal the dependence between lunar phases and stock market returns (Yuan et al. (2006)). According to Dichev & Janes (2001): \\"...returns in the 15 days around new moon dates are about double the returns in the 15 days around full moon dates\\". Even geomagnetic activity is reported to have an influence (negatively correlated) on stock returns (C. Robotti (2003). To sum up, non-economic events have a significant influence on trader‚Äôs behavior. An investor would expect high market returns on a sunny, but cool day, fifteen days around a new moon, with no significant geomagnetic activity, preferably the day after a victory on a significant sport event. In most cases such data should be treated as supplemental in measuring investor attention, but not as totally independent one.  Currency markets  Additional indicators exist to measure the sentiment specifically on Forex markets. Though the Forex market is decentralized (not traded on a central exchange), various retail Forex brokerage firms publish positioning ratios (similar to the Put/Call ratio) and other data regarding their own clients' trading behavior. Since most retail currency traders are unsuccessful, measures of Forex market sentiment are typically used as contrarian indicators. Some researchers report Internet search data (e.g. Google Trends) to be useful in predicting volatility on foreign currency markets. Internet search data and (relevant) Wikipedia page views data are reported to be useful in cryptocurrency (e.g. BitCoin) prices forecasting.

The dark spot is used to flash an 'evil eye' if danger approaches. Its large eyes at the front of the head provide it with binocular vision and depth perception, which are important for predators. The John Dory's eye spot on the side of its body also confuses prey, which are scooped up in its big mouth.New Zealand Coastal Fish: John Dory.

Several casks of them were pickled. Name Various, often doubtful explanations are given of the origin of the name. It may be an arbitrary or jocular variation of dory (from French dor√©e, gilded), or an allusion to John Dory, the hero of an old ballad. Others suggest that \\"John\\" derives from the French jaune, yellow. The novel An Antarctic Mystery by Jules Verne gives another account, which has some popularity but is probably fanciful: \\"The legendary etymology of this piscatorial designation is Janitore, the 'door-keeper,' in allusion to St. Peter, who brought a fish said to be of that species, to Jesus at his command.\\" Other known names for the John Dory are the \\"St. Pierre\\", or \\"Peter's Fish\\", perhaps explaining why dories were often referred to as \\"Peter Boats\\", Saint Peter being the patron saint of fishermen.see 1:Charlotte Mary Yonge, History of Christian names, Volume 1, pg. 359// 2: Abraham Smythe Palmer \\"Folk Etymology; Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted In Form Or Meaning pg. 196// 3.David Badham, Prose halieutics: or, Ancient and modern fish tattle/ 4: American Notes and Queries, Volume 3 pg. 129// and 5: Fraser's Magazine For Town And Country, January To June 1853 A related legend says that the dark spot on the fish's flank is St. Peter's thumbprint.The legend is noticed in St√©phan Reebs, Fish Behavior in the Aquarium and in the Wild (Cornell 1991:36); Reebs notes that the fish does not occur in the Sea of Galilee, where Peter fished. In the north coast of Spain, it is known commonly as San Marti√±o. Morphology John Dory, by William MacGillivray, c. 1840 The John Dory grows to a maximum size of 65 cm (2 ft) and 5 kg (12 lb) in weight. It has 10 long spines on its dorsal fin and 4 spines on its anal fin. It has microscopic, sharp scales that run around the body. The fish is an olive green color with a silver white belly and has a dark spot on its side. Its eyes are near the top of its head. It has a flat, round body shape and is a poor swimmer. Prey and predators The John Dory catches prey by stalking it, then extending its jaw forward in a tube-like structure to suck the fish in with some water. The water then flows out through the gills; the pre-maxillary bone, the only tooth-bearing bone in this fish, is used to grind the food. The John Dory has a high laterally compressed body ‚Äì its body is so thin it can hardly be seen from the front. The large eyes at the front of the head provide it with the binocular vision and depth perception it needs to catch prey. It has a large dark spot on both sides which it uses to flash an \\"evil eye\\" if danger approaches. This eye spot also confuses prey, which can then be sucked into its mouth.Walrond, Carl (2006) Coastal fish - Fish of the open sea floor, Te Ara: Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Accessed 28 May 2019. Its primarily eats smaller fish, especially schooling fish such as sardines. Occasionally it eats squid and cuttlefish. Its main predators are sharks such as the dusky shark, and large bony fish. Habitat John Dory are benthopelagic coastal fish, found on the coasts of Africa, South East Asia, New Zealand, Australia, the coasts of Japan, and on the coasts of Europe. They live near the seabed, living in depths from 5 metres (15 ft) to 360 metres (1200 ft). They are normally solitary. Reproduction and lifespan When John Dories are 3 or 4 years of age, they are ready to reproduce. This happens around the end of winter. They are substrate scatterers, which means that they release sperm and eggs into the water to fertilize. Typical lifespan is about 12 years in the wild. As food The cookery writer Eliza Acton observes in her 1845 book, Modern Cookery for Private Families, that John Dory \\"though of uninviting appearance, is considered by some person(s) as the most delicious fish that appears at [the] table\\". She recommends simply baking it \\"very gently\\", avoiding drying it out in the oven.

Its fossil was found by Ferdinand V. Hayden in 1870 in southwestern Wyoming. When first found, Notharctus tenebrosus was thought to be a small pachyderm due to the concentration of pachyderm fossils in the area. However, after Walter W. Granger's discovery of a nearly complete skeleton, also in Wyoming, it was firmly established as a primate. Notharctus tenebrosus most resembles modern-day lemurs, although they are not directly related. Notharctus tenebrosus belonged to an extinct primate group known as Adapiformes and fossils have been found in North America. Adapiform primates were among the first primates to exhibit a set of adaptations for life in the trees, such as grasping hands, binocular vision, and flexible backs. In addition to this, small orbits in the genera indicate that they were diurnal. \\"Notharctus\\" means false bear, while \\"tenebrosus\\" means dark or gloomy. Morphology Musee d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris. Notharctus tenebrosus had a fused mandibular symphysis and molar teeth with well-developed shearing crests, while the incisors are peg-like in form. Notharctus tenebrosus had canine teeth that are sexually dimorphic. The upper molars of this species have a pseudohypocone and the snout is moderately long, with a long premaxillary bone. Notharctus tenebrosus had a lacrimal bone that was positioned at the end of the orbit but not anterior to it. The vertebral formula of Notharctus tenebrosus is 7 cervicals, 12 thoracics, 8 lumbars, 3 sacrals, and 19+ caudals. Observing the fossils, Notharctus tenebrosus had long hindlimbs, trunk, and tail. On the hands and feet, the pollex and hallux are large and opposable, and the fingers and toes are long and possess nails, while on the foot the calcaneus is relatively short. There is evidence that the species had a type of grooming claw, thought to be an intermediate between a grooming claw and a nail. Notharctus tenebrosus has an average body mass of 4.2 kilograms and was about 40 cm long without its tail. Diet and locomotion Based on dental morphology, Notharctus tenebrosus most likely had a folivorous diet. Based upon limb bone morphology Notharctus tenebrosus most likely moved by leaping and was an arboreal quadruped.

Early life Santa Montefiore was born Santa Palmer-Tomkinson on 2 February 1970 in Winchester. Her parents are Charles Palmer-Tomkinson, formerly High Sheriff of Hampshire, and Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson (n√©e Dawson), of Anglo-Argentine background. Her father, and other members of her family, represented Great Britain in skiing at Olympic level. The Palmer- Tomkinson family are substantial land-owners in Hampshire and Leicestershire. She had a sister, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, known as a \\"socialite\\" and charity patron. Santa Montefiore said that growing up on the family farm gave her an \\"idyllic Swallows and Amazons childhood\\". She also describes her upbringing as \\"sheltered, Sloaney\\". She was educated at the Hanford School from the age of eight to twelve. She then attended Sherborne School for Girls in Dorset, where, in the sixth form, she became Head of her house (a role of responsibility similar to a prefect) and later Vice Head of School. She studied Spanish and Italian at Exeter University. Career Prior to publishing any novels, she worked in London, first in public relations for the outfitters Swaine Adeney and later for the jeweller Theo Fennell. She also worked as a shop assistant in Farmacia Santa Maria Novella, the perfumery, and in events for Ralph Lauren. She sent her first manuscript to several literary agents, using a nom de plume in order to distance herself from her sister. Only one agent, Jo Frank of A P Watt, expressed an interest, but this led to a bidding war between several publishers, with Hodder & Stoughton giving her a six-figure advance. Montefiore has published at least one novel a year since 2001. Four of her books are set in Argentina, where she spent 1989 as a gap year teaching English. Her books have been characterised as \\"beach-read blockbusters\\", selling over six million copies in 25 translations.\\"Writes of Passage\\".

It was qualified with Armscor in 1984 and then marketed by them for Milkor (Pty) Ltd. Due to international arms embargoes against South Africa due to apartheid, the country was forced to design and manufacture their own weapons. The weapon was intended for use by security forces.  Design details  The weapon has the same T-shape as Uzi- and MAC-10 submachineguns, and is manufactured in semi-automatic for security and automatic for military use. The automatic version fires from the open bolt, while the semi-automatic version fires from the closed bolt. Both versions are blowback operated. The bolt wraps around the rear of the barrel when closed, saving on overall length. The cocking handle is located at the top of the receiver. The BXP has an ambidextrous safety lever and a separate fire mode selector built into the trigger. The military-use version can be fired in single-shot mode by partially pressing the trigger, or in full-auto mode by fully pressing the trigger. There is also an interceptor notch that catches the bolt if it is released during the cocking but prior to activating the sear. The weapon is coated with a rust-resistant coating which doubles as a dry lubricant. Owing to a wide variety of muzzle devices (including silencers, heat shields, and even rifle grenades), the weapon can be used to fire non-lethal and explosive projectiles by the means of blank cartridge, as well as normal ammunition. The BXP also features an underfolding buttstock, made from stamped steel. The standard sights are of open type, but the BXP can be equipped with laser aiming modules and collimating sights. The gun fires at a relatively high rate of about 1000 rounds per minute, and is well-balanced and reasonably accurate with a barrel length of . It can be fired single-handedly by folding the stock forward to form a solid foregrip.  Users  *: Entered service with the South African Armed Forces in 1984.Miller, David (2001).

The BEA created two new budget control processes: a set of caps on annually-appropriated discretionary spending, and a \\"pay-as-you-go\\" or \\"PAYGO\\" process for entitlements and taxes.  Legislative history  The predecessor to the BEA, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, was originally enacted in 1985 and set overall deficit targets as a way to force Congress to enact future deficit reduction. If these deficit targets were not met, the president was required issue a sequestration order to automatically reduce discretionary spending. However, policymakers achieved these targets by using overly optimistic budget projections and other budget gimmicks, and Gramm-Rudman- Hollings was eventually viewed by policymakers as contributing to, rather than solving, the problem of rising deficits. By October 1990, the president's Office of Management and Budget projected a budget deficit for fiscal year 1991 that exceeded the statutory target; if Congress did not enact a deficit reduction plan, sequestration would have cut discretionary spending by about one-third.Megan Suzanne Lynch, Statutory Budget Controls in Effect Between 1985 and 2002, Congressional Research Service, R41901 (2011), https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41901.pdf. In November 1990, Congress and President George H.W. Bush agreed to a bipartisan deficit reduction deal that would achieve roughly $500 billion in savings over five years through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. These savings were enacted through the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and enforced by the budget procedures contained in Title XIII, the BEA, which was signed into law on November 5, 1990.  Provisions  Unlike Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, which set fixed deficit targets in hopes of encouraging future Congressional action, the BEA implemented budget controls meant to prevent Congress from taking actions that would increase the deficit. Specifically, the BEA *Introduced caps on discretionary spending, thus limiting the amount of funds Congress could provide in annual appropriations bills. Members of Congress could enforce these caps while a bill was under consideration by raising a point of order. If the caps were breached through enacted legislation, they would be enforced by a presidential sequester order that would cut discretionary spending across the board. *Introduced statutory \\"pay-as-you-go\\" or PAYGO procedures to govern new legislation that impacted direct spending and/or revenues. PAYGO required that any new spending increase or tax cut be offset by spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere. The Office of Management and Budget would track such legislation throughout the fiscal year on a PAYGO scorecard, and if such spending increases and tax cuts were not completely offset, the President would issue a sequestration order that would cut non-exempt direct spending programs. *Extended and revised the deficit targets from Gramm-Rudman- Hollings, allowing for revisions to the deficit targets to reflect changes in the economy, ensuring that sequestration would not be triggered unless Congress breached the discretionary spending caps or violated PAYGO.Megan Suzanne Lynch, Statutory Budget Controls in Effect Between 1985 and 2002, Congressional Research Service, R41901 (2011), https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41901.pdf.https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st- congress/house-bill/5835Public Law No: 101-508 CRS Summary  Subsequent legislation  The BEA was extended by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993, and again by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It expired in 2002, but the Democratic Majority adopted some of its principles, known as PAYGO, or Pay-As- You-Go, in their rules during the 110th Congress. This was passed as H.

Lynch, Sequestration as a Budget Enforcement Process: Frequently Asked Questions, R42972, Congressional Research Service (2015), https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42972.pdf.  Legacy and impact  The BEA is credited with helping to reduce deficits during the 1990s, and regarded as more successful than its predecessor Gramm-Rudman-Hollings.Congressional Budget Office.

Testimony before the House Budget Committee on Extending the Budget Enforcement Act, June 27, 2001, http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/28xx/doc2896/bea- testimony.pdf Then-director of the Congressional Budget Office, Robert Reischauer, compared the legacy of these two laws in testimony before Congress in 1993, concluding that ‚Äúbudget procedures are much better at enforcing deficit reduction agreements (as the Budget Enforcement Act has done) than at forcing such agreements to be reached.\\" Sequestration was triggered only twice under the BEA, resulting in small discretionary spending cuts in 1991. However, Congress began to weaken the BEA's budget controls when faced with budget surpluses in the late 1990s.

This species, together with the lesser violetear were previously considered conspecific, and together called the green violetear.  Taxonomy  The Mexican violetear belongs to the order Apodiformes. Hummingbirds share this order with the swifts, such as the white-collared swift. The name Apodiformes is derived from the Greek words \\"a pous,\\" meaning \\"without foot.\\" While apodiforms do in fact have feet, they are quite small and their legs are short and relatively weak. Many birds in this order cannot walk, and thus rarely if ever land on the ground, where they are not well-adapted to forage or to escape from predators. Members of this order spend a majority of their active time in the air.  Description  The Mexican violetear is roughly medium- sized by hummingbird standards. It averages around in total length. Its bill is black and mostly straight with only a slight downward curve and measures from . The body mass can vary from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is and the tail is . The bird has a wingspan of 12 cm. It is shining green above with a glittering violet ear-patch on the sides of its neck. Its throat and chest are a glittering green with a shining green belly. The tail is a metallic blue-green with more bronzy central feathers and a prominent black subterminal band. = Vocalizations = Solitary males sing from high, exposed twigs in their territory every day. Their song is a monotonously repeated sharp and dry ‚Äútsu-tzeek‚Äù at a rate of about one call per second.  Distribution and habitat  = Distribution = The Mexican violetear breeds from the highlands of southern Mexico south to Nicaragua. It is a rare but annual nonbreeding visitor to the United States, primarily southern and central Texas, with scattered records as far north as extreme southern Canada. According to IUCN C. thalissinus can be found in much of montane areas of the northern Andes, stretching from Bolivia to Venezuela.https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22687110/93140351#geographic- range = Habitat = Common habitats for the Mexican violetear is in the canopy and borders of subtropical and lower temperate forest, secondary woodland and scrub, and clearings and gardens in the subtropical zone. It is recorded mostly between altitudes of , though they will sometimes wander as far down as in search of food sources. It generally prefers more humid and high-altitude areas, such as cloud forests. = Diet = The Mexican violetear forages alone but tends to gather at flowering trees, especially coffee-shade Inga. They feed at mid-level to canopy and often hold and defend a feeding territory. They primarily feed on nectar and small insects. They are a fairly common species that thrives in deforested areas. = Breeding = Like most hummingbirds, the Mexican violetear is a solitary nester. The male's only involvement in the breeding process is to attract and mate with the female. The female is then responsible for choosing a nest location, generally on a low, small horizontal branch in a protected area. The nest is small and built from various plant materials, spider webs, and down woven together to form a sturdy cup structure. Two small white eggs are laid within the nest and the female incubates them on her own. Incubation time is 14‚Äì18 days. Hatchlings are primarily fed insects due to high nutritional requirements. No information was found on the length of the nestling stage or age at fledgling. Breeding takes place though the wet season into the early dry season, which varies by latitude. = Migration = Seasonal movements of the Mexican violetear are not well understood. Many individuals of northern populations move south or and/or to lower elevations following the end of the breeding season (July to November in Mexico), but regular occurrence hundreds of kilometres north of this range suggests a more complex migration strategy.

At long, the Boulevard Bridge was completed in 1925. It was privately owned and financed by the Boulevard Bridge Corporation for the purpose of providing access to the new Westover Hills neighborhood in South Richmond, where one of the selling points of the homes was free bridge access. It is named for The Boulevard, a main route through Richmond that ends just north of the bridge in Byrd Park. For many years, 5-cent tolls were collected at a toll booth midway on the span, and it became widely known as the \\"Nickel Bridge\\". Some years later, tolls were increased to 10 cents, and the nickname became the \\"Dime Bridge\\". However, despite all subsequent toll increases, it is still known today as the \\"nickel bridge\\" to many locals. Initially, the early toll-barrier was located in the middle of the span (actually above the north shore of the river between the canal and the north end), because all the property on either side except the right-of-way for the roadway itself was owned by others, and the toll barrier at that location could be erected at no additional land acquisition expense. It was certainly not possible to circumvent paying the toll at that location. The toll booths were relocated to a plaza north of the bridge in the mid-1960s. Toll plate issued by Boulevard Bridge Corporation in mid 20th century During the years of ownership by the Boulevard Bridge Corporation, Westover Hills residents were given free access across the bridge by the use of a special license plate that was attached below the state plates on their cars. These plates had to be applied for and were also sold to the general public. They were changed each year, and in the last years before Richmond Metropolitan Authority (RMA) control, windshield stickers were used. On November 24, 1969, the RMA, which was building Richmond's new expressway system at the time, purchased the Boulevard Bridge for $1.2 million. The toll on the bridge was kept at 10 cents until 1988, when it was doubled to 20 cents. In August 1992, the RMA closed the bridge for 18 months to complete extensive renovation work, which included widening the existing lanes, installing new toll booths and equipment on the north end of the bridge, and improving safe access for bicycles and pedestrians. The bridge reopened in October 1993. The toll was increased again in 1998 to 25 cents. In 2008, the RMA increased the tolls on all of its roads, bringing the Boulevard Bridge to its current rate of 35 cents. Despite the renovation work in the early 1990s, weight restrictions on the bridge limit vehicles to under 7,500 lbs.

History Original 19th-century artist illustration of Chudow (Chutow) Castle by publisher Alexander Duncker. The village was first mentioned in 1295 as Chudow attested in the Latin manuscript Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis. Chud√≥w was a privately owned medieval manor purchased in 1532 by the Roman-German Silesian nobility House of Saszowski family, who already owned the neighbouring manor of Giera≈Çtowice.Castle Chud√≥w (Polish Zamek w Chudowie) (in Polish) Chud√≥w is famous for its 16th-century Renaissance castle residence, built by the nobleman and scion John Saszowski von Geraltowitz (alias Geraltowsky in German, Giera≈Çtowski in Polish).Castle Chud√≥w (Polish Zamek w Chudowie) (in Polish)Chud√≥w Castle Foundation (in Polish) The village remained part of the House of Saszowski estates and a residence of its branch scions alias Geraltowsky von Geraltowitz (in Polish: Giera≈Çtowski z Gieraltowic) until it was sold in the first half of the 17th century. Historical sources say, it was one of the most magnificent castle residences in Upper Silesia, host to many banquets and sport hunting activities of the aristocracy, in later times even included its own castle brewery and inn. The original entrance to the castle was via a drawbridge over the moat, which lead directly to the second floor of the castle tower. In 1706 new owners of the castle was the family Foglar√≥w. After 1768, the castle changed owners quite often, losing in importance. In 1837, the castle owner Alexander von Bally, made several reconstructions to the original design of the castle. The castle suffered severe fire damage in 1875, and its last owner left it as a picturesque ruin. Abandoned to ruin since the late 19th century, only parts of the walls, four-sided tower and outline of the moat survived to the present day. In 1995, the newly founded Chud√≥w Castle Foundation, has since began gradual castle restoration and reconstruction work. Since 1966 the castle ruin is under registration No. A/568 categorized as of significant cultural value and tracked as objects of cultural heritage in Poland by the National Heritage Board of Poland. In an already restored tower, there is a small museum that shows one of the most interesting exhibitions of ceramic medieval Gothic cocklestove tiles found in Poland, discovered on the castle grounds during restoration works and archaeological excavations. Since 2000, the Chud√≥w Castle Foundation organizes in August an annual medieval fair along with historical reenactments of medieval tournaments and warfare on Chud√≥w castle grounds.

Its cause has not been established, but its association with asthma exacerbations (usually with a respiratory infection as a trigger) has led to suspicion that the initial viral insult that causes the respiratory infection is also implicated in the subsequent paralysis. Herpes simplex virus type I DNA has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of at least one patient diagnosed with Hopkins syndrome. In several cases, anti-viral antibody titers for echovirus, enterovirus, coxsackievirus and poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were specifically sought; all were negative., There is one reported case in which Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was found in the patient. The syndrome appears to involve the spinal cord: specifically, the anterior horn cells subserving the affected muscles are often damaged. The evidence for anterior horn cell involvement comes from radiological ,, and electromyographical studies. In one case, a biopsy of an affected muscle \\"revealed scattered atrophic fibers, indicating lesions in the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord\\". As the illness is rare, no treatments have been subjected to a randomized controlled trial.

Plot  Having pledged his love for college girl Madhu, Vijay finds himself entwined in a close friendship with Anu, a married woman separated from her husband. Vijay grapples with the definition of love, treading the fine line between trust and attraction, amidst tremendous societal pressure. He is confused about his feelings for Anu, yet wants Madhu as his life partner. Amid all this is his youthful streak of rebellion, ready to take on the world despite the society's extreme reaction, which creates more grief than good.  Cast  * Anil Kapoor as Vijay (Voice dubbed by Ramakrishna) * Lakshmi as Anu * Vikram * Kiran Vairale as Madhu * Suresh Heblikar  Production  After completing his MBA and beginning work as a management consultant, Mani Ratnam was keen to enter the film industry and thus accepted the invitation of his friends Ravishankar and Raman (the sons of director B. R. Panthulu and musician S. Balachander respectively) to co-write the script of a Kannada film they were making, titled Bangarada Gani. Featuring Vishnuvardhan, Lakshmi, Ambareesh and Roja Ramani in the lead roles. The film was never completed and was later shelved. Mani Ratnam then decided to branch out as a director himself and wrote a script entirely in English, during a single month in 1980. With the script of the film which he intended to make in Tamil, Ratnam first met Kamal Haasan to play the film's protagonist, after his friend Kitty arranged a meeting with the actor. Haasan demanded major changes to the script if he were to play the lead role, and introduced Ratnam to his brother Charuhasan, who pledged to help find the script a producer. Ratnam revealed that he was open to the idea of selling the script to a popular director so that he could learn about filmmaking during the production process, but his meetings with K. Balachander, Bharathiraja and J. Mahendran were not successful. Haasan had later claimed that he was unable to work in Pallavi Anupallavi due to his commitment to Raja Paarvai (1981) and around the same time \\"also getting into Hindi films\\". Ratnam subsequently met several producers. The script was rejected by over twenty studios, including Rajkannu of Sri Amman Creations and Gowri Shankar of Devi Films. Subsequently, Ratnam's uncle Krishnamurthy and T. Govindarajan of Venus Films agreed to finance the film under the condition that he made it as a low-budget Kannada film. While P. C. Sreeram was his original choice for cinematography, the producers insisted on an established cinematographer. Ratnam then approached Balu Mahendra. Ratnam also convinced B. Lenin (who was incidentally his neighbour), to work as the editor, since he had been impressed with his editing of Mahendran's Uthiripookkal (1979). Thota Tharani who happened to meet Ratnam during the shoot of Raja Paarvai, which the director had gone to watch, joined the team next. For the music, Ratnam had initially signed a prominent composer who scored music for Kannada films, but wriggled out of the contract after being unimpressed by his work in another film during the period. Ratnam asked Balu Mahendra to introduce him to Ilaiyaraaja, who agreed to do the film for one-fifth of his usual remuneration. While selecting the cast, Ratnam approached Lakshmi, with whom he had worked during the making of Bangarada Gani to portray the lead character with whom the younger man falls in love. Lakshmi was a well- established star at the time, and her coming on board, prompted Krishnamurthy to agree to financing the film. Anil Kapoor was chosen to portray the male protagonist after Ratnam was impressed with his performance in the Telugu film Vamsa Vruksham (1980). Kapoor also helped bring Kiran Vairale on board when Suhasini turned down the role. Rohit, the son of Srinath, was a child actor in the film and appeared in Ratnam's first shot. Ratnam did not know Kannada before directing the film but learned it \\"on the job\\", as he extensively researched literature for the script at the USIS and British Council offices in Chennai. With the help of his associate Shivanand, he was able to convert the English dialogues into Kannada and help Kapoor and Kiran Vairale perform to their respective lines, in a language unfamiliar to them. The film was shot in Coorg and Bangalore, close to Venus Films' distribution centre in the city. Towards the end of production, the film ran into financial difficulties and it took twenty one months to finish the final three days of the shoot, owing to call-sheet conflicts.  Soundtrack  Ilaiyaraaja composed the film's background score and soundtrack, the lyrics for which were penned by R. N. Jayagopal. In his biographical book Conversations with Mani Ratnam, Ratnam revealed that Balu Mahendra introduced him to Ilaiyaraaja. Ratnam told Ilaiyaraaja that he was doing a Kannada film with a very small budget but wanted him to compose the music, while also confessing that he could not afford to pay the latter's market price. Ilaiyaraaja agreed to work for one- fifth the amount he was getting at the time. The composer would go on to collaborate with the director for nine more films, including acclaimed Tamil films like Mouna Ragam (1986), Nayakan (1987), Agni Natchathiram (1988), Anjali (1990) and Thalapathi (1991).  Release  The film was released in January 1983 and experienced moderate success at the box office, performing well in bigger cities and not so well in smaller towns and the villages. Over the years with television becoming popular, it gained cult status owing to the subsequent popularity of the director and the actor.

The longer form of its name translates as Sutra of the Fundamental Vows of the Bodhisattva K·π£itigarbha. The sutra tells of how K·π£itigarbha became a bodhisattva by making great vows to rescue other sentient beings and a description of how he displayed filial piety in his past lifetimes. The sutra also expounds at length the retributions of unwholesome karma, descriptions of Buddhist hells and the benefits of good merit both great and small. History Statue of K·π£itigarbha in Taiwan The K·π£itigarbhas≈´tra was first translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the 7th century during the Tang dynasty by the Tripi·π≠aka master ≈öik·π£ƒÅnanda, a monk from Khotan who also provided a new translation of the Avata·πÉsaka S≈´tra and the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra. Some scholars suspected that instead of being translated, this text may have originated in China since no Sanskrit manuscripts of this text have been found. Part of the reason for suspicion is that the text advocates filial piety, which was stereotypically associated with Chinese culture. Since then, other scholars such as Gregory Schopen have pointed out that Indian Buddhism also had traditions of filial piety. One good example is Lord Buddha's sharing of the Dhamma in the form of Abhidhamma with his late mother that was reborn as a celestial being in the abode of Tavatimsa, which was the greatest gift that he could offer out of fillial piety to his late mother. Currently there is no clear evidence indicating either an Indian or Chinese origin for the text. Contents There are a total of thirteen chapters in the K·π£itigarbhas≈´tra, which are divided into three sections. The teaching is presented in the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and K·π£itigarbha and takes place in the TrƒÅyastri·πÉ≈õa Heaven, located on the top of Mount Meru, in front of a vast multitude of sentient beings. It includes tales of K·π£itigarbha's skill at freeing beings from the hells and instructions on dealing with the dying and the dead. This sutra has multiple aspects for buddhists who are in various condition. For example, # A dharma to 'leave the sea of suffering and realize the happiness of Nirvana' and finally 'Ultimate attainment of Buddhahood'. # A teaching concerning karmic retribution, graphically describing the consequences one creates for oneself by committing undesirable actions. # filial piety - not only that between oneself and one's parents, but also in an ultimate sense of a universal code of duty or responsibility for all living beings. For example, the Buddha frequently mentions the benefits of dedicating any good merit done to all sentient beings: \\"Moreover, if they should be able to dedicate rewards thus gained for the benefit of the entire Dharmadhatu, then their bliss will defy comparison.\\" In the last Chapter 13, Buddha also spoke about 28 kinds of benefits for \\"any good man or good woman who should see Ksitigarbha's image and hear this Sutra and, furthermore, read and recite it, and who should also donate incense, flowers, drink, food, clothing and precious treasures as offerings, in addition to giving praise and making obeisance to Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha\\" Those 28 benefits of reciting K·π£itigarbhas≈´tra are as follows: #‰∏ÄËÄÖ„ÄÅÂ§©ÈæçË≠∑Âøµ They will be protected by heavenly beings and dragons. #‰∫åËÄÖ„ÄÅÂñÑÊûúÊó•Â¢û They will increase in good mind day after day. #‰∏âËÄÖ„ÄÅÈõÜËÅñ‰∏äÂõ† They will accumulate superior wisdom. #ÂõõËÄÖ„ÄÅËè©Êèê‰∏çÈÄÄ They will never regress from Bodhi. #‰∫îËÄÖ„ÄÅË°£È£üË±êË∂≥ They will be opulent in food and clothing. #ÂÖ≠ËÄÖ„ÄÅÁñæÁñ´‰∏çËá® They will never suffer from any disease. #‰∏ÉËÄÖ„ÄÅÈõ¢Ê∞¥ÁÅ´ÁÅΩ They will be far away from flood, fire and disaster. #ÂÖ´ËÄÖ„ÄÅÁÑ°ÁõúË≥äÂéÑ They will not be stolen from or robbed. #‰πùËÄÖ„ÄÅ‰∫∫Ë¶ãÊ¨ΩÊï¨ They will be respected by everyone. #ÂçÅËÄÖ„ÄÅÁ•ûÈ¨ºÂä©ÊåÅ Gods and ghosts will help and support them. #ÂçÅ‰∏ÄËÄÖ„ÄÅÂ•≥ËΩâÁî∑Ë∫´ A woman may be reborn as a male in the next life. #ÂçÅ‰∫åËÄÖ„ÄÅÁÇ∫ÁéãËá£Â•≥ A woman may be born as a king‚Äôs or minister‚Äôs daughter. #ÂçÅ‰∏âËÄÖ„ÄÅÁ´ØÊ≠£Áõ∏Â•Ω They will be born with good-looking features. #ÂçÅÂõõËÄÖ„ÄÅÂ§öÁîüÂ§©‰∏ä They will be reincarnated in heaven. #ÂçÅ‰∫îËÄÖ„ÄÅÊàñÁÇ∫Â∏ùÁéã They may be reincarnated as a king. #ÂçÅÂÖ≠ËÄÖ„ÄÅÂÆøÊô∫ÂëΩÈÄö They will be aware of their former lives. #ÂçÅ‰∏ÉËÄÖ„ÄÅÊúâÊ±ÇÁöÜÂæû They will obtain anything they ask. #ÂçÅÂÖ´ËÄÖ„ÄÅÁú∑Â±¨Ê≠°Ê®Ç Their families and relatives will be joyful. #ÂçÅ‰πùËÄÖ„ÄÅË´∏Ê©´Ê∂àÊªÖ All disasters or accidents will be eliminated. #‰∫åÂçÅËÄÖ„ÄÅÊ•≠ÈÅìÊ∞∏Èô§ They will be rid of all bad karma. #‰∫åÂçÅ‰∏ÄËÄÖ„ÄÅÂéªËôïÁõ°ÈÄö They will go anywhere without problems. #‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫åËÄÖ„ÄÅÂ§úÂ§¢ÂÆâÊ®Ç They will have pleasant and peaceful dreams. #‰∫åÂçÅ‰∏âËÄÖ„ÄÅÂÖà‰∫°Èõ¢Ëã¶ Their deceased relatives will be far away from suffering. #‰∫åÂçÅÂõõËÄÖ„ÄÅÂÆøÁ¶èÂèóÁîü They will receive the blessings from their past lives. #‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫îËÄÖ„ÄÅË´∏ËÅñËÆöÊ≠é They will be praised by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. #‰∫åÂçÅÂÖ≠ËÄÖ„ÄÅËÅ∞ÊòéÂà©Ê†π They will become intelligent and have a good roots. #‰∫åÂçÅ‰∏ÉËÄÖ„ÄÅÈ•íÊÖàÊÑçÂøÉ They will possess a merciful heart. #‰∫åÂçÅÂÖ´ËÄÖ„ÄÅÁï¢Á´üÊàê‰Ωõ They will ultimately realize Buddhahood.

Hyperbolus (, Hyperbolos; died 411 BC) was an Athenian politician active during the first half of the Peloponnesian war, coming to particular prominence after the death of Cleon. In 416 or 415 he was the last Athenian to be ostracised. Life A fragment of Theopompus suggests that Hyperbolus was the son of Chremes, but surviving ostraka prove that his father's name was actually Antiphanes. Some ancient sources claim that Hyperbolus was from a slave family, though the fact that his father had a Greek name makes this unlikely. Hyperbolus was a demagogue, and an allusion in Aristophanes' play The Knights suggests that he ‚Äì like Cleon, another demagogue of the late fifth century ‚Äì supported an ambitious Athenian foreign policy. The precise details of his political career are unknown, but he seems to have been a member of the boule and possibly a trierarch. Hyperbolus was a frequent target of the authors of Old Comedy. The first to satirise him was supposedly Hermippus; Plato the comic poet and Eupolis wrote plays about him; and there are allusions to Hyperbolus in seven of Aristophanes' surviving plays, from Acharnians in 425 to The Frogs in 405 BC. By contrast, only a single \\"contemptuous\\" reference to Hyperbolus is found in Thucydides. In 416 or 415, Hyperbolus proposed an ostracism, and was himself ostracised. In 412/11 he was murdered on Samos. According to Thucydides, the Athenian general Charminus was involved in the killing. Theopompus claims that Hyperbolus' body was stuffed into a wineskin and thrown into the sea; this may be derived from a comedy. Ostracism Sometime in the years 417-415 BC Hyperbolus was ostracised. According to Plutarch, who described the ostracism in three of his Lives, the ostracism was proposed by Hyperbolus himself, intending to have either Nicias or Alcibiades ‚Äì Theophrastus says Alcibiades or Phaeax ‚Äì ostracised; the two politicians put aside their differences and persuaded their supporters to vote to ostracise Hyperbolus instead. The date of the ostracism is uncertain. It was traditionally thought that Hyperbolus was ostracised in 417, six years before he was murdered. However, an inscription naming Hyperbolus as the proposer of an amendment to a law was restored in 1949 by A. G. Woodhead, which suggests that he was still active after an ostracism in 417 ought to have taken place. As Nicias and Alcibiades were potential victims of the ostracism, however, it cannot have taken place any later than 415; 415 and 416 are thus the only possible years that the ostracism can be dated to. P. J. Rhodes suggests that 415 is slightly more likely. Legacy Ostracism does not seem ever to have been used again in Athens after Hyperbolus, though the practice was never formally abolished. According to Plutarch, this was because the Athenians were so disgusted with the outcome of the ostracism that they abandoned the practice. Rhodes argues, however, that ostracism was in fact abandoned because it was too imprecise, and from the late fifth century the Athenians began to use more targeted methods for holding office-holders to account. For instance, 415, the probable date of the last ever ostracism, is also the earliest date the graphe paranomon is known to have been in use.

Born to Chinese immigrants in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Chueh's family relocated to Fresno, California soon after his birth. Taught illustration at a young age, he became obsessed with interpreting the popular culture imagery he was surrounded by. Trained as graphic designer at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, he was hired as an in-house designer & illustrator at the Ernie Ball Company in 1997. His work during this time garnered him several awards as well as features in the 1998 design annuals of both Communication Arts and Print.

When he was three months old, Chueh's family relocated from his birthplace of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Fresno, California. At the age of four, his mother taught him how to draw Mickey Mouse, which began a childhood obsession to paint and illustrate renditions of his favorite things, mainly Star Wars and other \\"science fiction stuff that I was watching all the time.\\" After graduating from Clovis West High School in 1991, the 18-year-old enrolled into the Art & Design program at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. Nearing the completion of his degree, one his professors confided in Chueh that he was \\"a mediocre graphic designer,\\" but explained that he was \\"a great illustrator\\" and \\"should pursue a career in that\\", despite the fact that Chueh had a graphic design concentration and his \\"formal\\" art training was restricted to a \\"couple quarters of Life Drawing and Illustrations classes\\". Hired by the Ernie Ball Company as an in-house designer & illustrator before receiving his bachelor's degree in 1997, Chueh primarily created T-shirt and advertisement designs for the brand. Several of these became award-winning, with the artist himself being featured in the 1998 design annuals of both Communication Arts and Print. During this time, Chueh began spending his nights partying, drinking, and doing drugs. In 2003, an addiction to painkillers resulted in his being fired, which spurred Chueh's relocation to Los Angeles with no job prospects. = Emerging artist = = Artistic breakthrough =  Style & works  = Artistic development = Bear in Mind, 2006. His images have been remarked upon for their juxtaposition of cuteness with the macabre. \\"Traditionally, the sublime is described as the beautiful tinged with pain,\\" said Steppling gallery director Sheila Dollente. \\"Chueh pares that idea to a single spare image borne by figures reminiscent of the soft, innocent stuffed animals of childhood. His paintings are at once intriguing, puzzling, friendly and sorrowful.\\" His paintings and illustrations are noted for bringing together influences as diverse as Mark Rothko and Sanrio. Chueh draws inspiration from deeply personal experiences to popular culture, and has created works that stem from the intolerance he suffered as a child growing up as a Chinese- American. In an interview with Art Prostitute Magazine he stated that he is influenced by his contemporaries utilizing strong illustrative elements.

The Undercliff on the Isle of Wight skirts the southern edge of the island from Niton to Bonchurch. A favourable climate here has resulted in a semi-tropical environment, covered by lush vegetation. The microclimate of warm sunshine, moist air and few winter chills was recognised by leading physicians in Victorian times as a beneficial environment for sufferers of respiratory diseases. This led to the establishment by Arthur Hill Hassall of a chest hospital at Ventnor. The development of Ventnor and St Lawrence during the mid-19th century saw the construction of many fine houses and villas, and the creation of some beautiful gardens.

However, it became heavily overgrown in the 20th century following the cessation of sheep farming and the decline in rabbits due to myxomatosis, and access is now difficult, the terrain being treacherous due to its unstable cliffs, deep gullies and dense undergrowth. Sabine Baring-Gould's 1900 novel Winefred, a story of the chalk cliffs is set in the Undercliff area, with the Great Slip as its climax. The Undercliff was also one of the settings for the novel The French Lieutenant's Woman and a location for its film adaptation. =Hooken= The Hooken Undercliff is on the cliff route between Beer, Devon and Branscombe. A slump in the Chalk cliffs in 1790 separated a tract of land, now a wooded and sheltered habitat with chalk pinnacles on the seaward side. It is reached via a steep footpath leading from the clifftop to Branscombe Beach.

Stargate literary works follow no strict continuity with the series or each other, and are often considered to be non-canon. This is evident in the fact that there is a period of roughly a year between the original idea for a novel and the finalised product, causing problems for authors as they are unaware as to how the franchise will develop and change during the writing process. Despite this, the editors of Stargate literature function as the medium between the author and the production company. There are three series of novels based on the Stargate franchise and short fiction has also been published in the official Stargate Magazine. It becomes difficult to discern what is and what is not canonical because much of the literature is based on the canon, whilst some of even this type of work deviates from the main productions, or is later contradicted. There's no official word from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) about the canonicity of the Stargate written fiction. MGM does, however, approve each stage of novel's production, from initial outline to final draft. It remains up to the fans' discretion whether or not to accept Stargate literature as part of the combined Stargate universe. Stargate literature centers on the premise of a \\"Stargate\\", a ring-shaped alien device that creates a wormhole enabling personal teleportation to complementary devices located cosmic distances away. Under the control of the United States government, the Stargate discovered on Earth is kept a secret from the public. This allows storylines to present no contradiction between depicted events and reality, an effect compounded by setting Stargate in the present day, and depicting Earth accurately, with any unrealistic technology originating solely from alien civilizations. Most of the time, Stargate literature follows SG-1 and the Atlantis flagship team on their journey through different galaxies.  Film novelizations  Cover of Stargate: Rebellion, the first of Bill McCay's novel sequels to the original Stargate film. Written by the movie creators, Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, the novelization of the original film, Stargate was published by Signet Books, an imprint of Penguin Books, in December 1994. Bill McCay had written a series of five novels continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, despite the success of the Stargate television series. McCay used the official notes by Emmerich to write his books. A series of five novels written by Bill McCay were published from 1996 to 1999, based on the story of the 1994 film, Stargate. Each book was also produced as a book on tape read by David Fox. These were produced by consulting the original notes made by film director Roland Emmerich, in an attempt to envision where the film \\"would have gone\\". Neither party has commented on whether McCay's interpretation was correct. The film's producer, Dean Devlin, had his own ideas, but he did not bring them to light until interviewed much later, after the publication of all the novels. The subsequent television series Stargate SG-1 was an entirely independent development, making no attempt to reconcile with the plot line of the books. This marked the first major branching of the franchise. The story continues immediately after the events of the film, with the United States armed forces interested in the mineral that is mined for Ra by the Abydans. As conflict arises in many forms on the planet of Abydos, a new threat comes when other gods from Ra's pantheon (namely Hathor) come looking. Bits of the Ancient Egyptian myth, The Destruction of Mankind, are acknowledged in the novel's construction. The first three books form one complete storyline: *Stargate: Rebellion (October 1995) *Stargate: Retaliation (September 1996) *Stargate: Retribution (October 1997) The last two continue after the events in the first three books, but move the story forwards by dealing with the Abydans and the events that happen at the climax of the trilogy. *Stargate: Reconnaissance (May 1998) *Stargate: Resistance (October 1999) The book canon of the franchise has many differences with the television series Stargate SG-1. In the books, Ra is the last of his race, and all of his lieutenants (such as Hathor and Ptah) are actually loyal humans who pose as the other Egyptian gods created by Ra to enslave the populace. The movie version of Ra inhabits a human body by possessing the human with his soul, rather than as the parasitic snake as seen in Stargate SG-1. The books focus more on politics, with budget issues and human rights considerations playing a large role. The book's version of O'Neil is much more of a straight soldier, while Jackson remains the idealistic maverick scientist. The quartz-like mineral (called Naqahdah in Stargate SG-1) remains unnamed. The city that Kasuf and Sha'uri live in is called Nagada and more cities on Abydos are shown. While the first three books focus on the plight of the Abydan (called Abydonian in Stargate SG-1) people and the war between Ra's humans and the humans from Earth, the last two books introduce other worlds and other races.  Other releases  ROC published four Stargate SG-1 novels written by Ashley McConnell from 1998 to 2001. These novels were available only in the United States. The United Kingdom-based publisher Fandemonium specialises in Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis, publishing the first book in 2005. The Stargate SG-1 novels were originally only available in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa because the company did not hold a licence to distribute them in North America but the Stargate Atlantis books are available worldwide. The company's license was later extended to North America in June 2006. All books are written as canon; that is, they try to recreate the show. MGM reads and approves all the novels. The company held an open submissions policy in November 2004, inviting fans to submit proposals for a Stargate SG-1 novel. This proved popular, and the aim was to find good fanfiction writers who would be able to write professional novels. Fandemonium's company runner and chief editor, Sally Malcolm, started out as a fanfic writer herself. Several future books are works of authors found through this policy. Stargate Atlantis novels continue to be written only by professional authors. The official Stargate Magazine, produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both SG-1 and Atlantis. The magazine is available in the UK and internationally through Diamond Comic Distributors' Previews catalogue. Thomasina Gibson and Sharon Gosling have written official companion guides for all seasons of Stargate SG-1 (seasons 1 through 8 as two seasons per companion guide) and Stargate Atlantis, published by Titan Books. Stepping Through the Stargate: Science, Archaeology, and the Military of Stargate SG-1 is a collection of works which are centered around the science fiction TV series Stargate SG-1. The book takes a thoughtful, but light-hearted look at the popular, award-winning television series. It was edited by P. N. Elrod and Roxanne L. Conrad and published by BenBella Books in 2004. The book is a non-fiction collection of essays, articles, and personal recollections by cast and crew members, scientists, military experts, and various science fiction writers, all of whom are fans of the show. James Tichenor special effects head of Stargate SG-1 and actor Tom McBeath (who played Colonel Harry Maybourne) and Stargate comic book writer James Kuhoric. Even an Air Force Colonel were some of many who helped to write the collection of works. Stargate comics are a series of comic books based on the film, Stargate (1994), and the TV series' Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis. The initial comics were tie-ins with the 1994 film and the later output by Avatar Press has been based on the two TV series. A series of Stargate film-related comics were published by the independent publishing house Entity Comics between 1996 and 1997, under the creative direction of John Migliore and Bill Maus. Along with a four-part comic book adaptation of the Stargate motion picture and three-part adaption of Bill McCay's Stargate: Rebellion, Entity Comics also wrote their own continuation of the Stargate film. Stargate: One Nation Under Ra and Stargate: Underworld were later published as a trade paperback titled Stargate: The New Adventures Collection. There has been no official word as to whether or not the comics are canon. Stargate audiobooks by Big Finish Productions, based on the long-running military science fiction television franchise Stargate. The \\"talking books\\" are each narrated by one of main Stargate characters and feature a second, guest-star voice along with music and sound effects. = Development = Authors interested in writing a Stargate book need to send a manuscript to the e-mail address of the official Stargate literature webpage. Known writers need to send their publishing history and a short synopsis of their planned plot behind the book. German author Sabine C. Bauer wrote the first Stargate SG-1 novel, entitled Stargate SG-1 Trial By Fire. Bauer first noted the Stargate universe when studying theater in the United States, when she traveled back to Great Britain, Stargate SG-1 hadn't premiered yet. So she started to write a Stargate script (which eventually became Trial By Fire). She spent four years writing the book writing a main story arc for the character Jack O'Neill. She garnered a few minor awards for her novel and started writing Stargate novels behind the science idea of quantum physics. Jamie Duncan and Holly Scott have written two Stargate novels, the first being Stargate SG-1 Siren Song and second being Stargate SG-1 Hydra. Scott has commented on the writing process for the books, saying that she and Duncan both learned \\"Several things from [...] process\\" when writing the first book, she felt the most important thing she learnt was \\"Not to be afraid of revising the draft\\". She further commented that this became \\"Very handy\\" when developing their second book (Hydra), since the first draft of the book needed a lot of work, as she said \\"We had to learn to whack scenes that just didn't work.\\" Siren Song is set after the event of Stargate SG-1 episode, \\"Deadman Switch\\", while Hydra is set between \\"Tin Man\\" and \\"Shades of Grey\\". According to Duncan, \\"Deadman Switch\\" was a \\"Relatively stand-alone episode\\" for the series, which made it possible to make an exciting story and a \\"Fun secondary character\\" (Aris Boch) for the book. She further stated that she was able to explore the culture better with the book. Scott called the development of Siren Song a \\"wonderful challenge\\". As Scott explained, she has wanted to write stories for many of the Stargate SG-1 characters, but Aris Boch was at the top of her list, she called her experience in writing the book \\"Remarkable\\" to create a back story for the character and write new interaction between the character and SG-1. Hydra followed the events of \\"Tin Man\\", and as Duncan puts it, the episode came with an \\"unanswered question\\", a \\"paradox\\" even. The main focus of the story was how to live with yourself when you knew that you were not the person you felt you were. The story follows the cloned SG-1 team being ripped off from all their \\"Heroic qualities\\" and what the differences are between them and the real team. The novel itself is told in multiples of view points, and it jumps back and forth in time. When writing the structure for the novel, they created a chart. As Duncan puts it, the story could not been \\"Told in a linear fashion\\", if they wanted to achieve certain story effects within the plot. So they felt that if the story was going to achieve an \\"Emotional\\" status, it needed to be told in a \\"Non-linear structure\\". Scott further stated that some of the \\"Perspective\\" of the SG-1 members could not been told because of being to \\"POV\\" for the book itself. Steven Savile, writer of the Shadow series which consists of the books Shadows, Shapshifter and Trickster were released in 2009. These books were written to stand to true to the nature of Stargate SG-1 and its characters. After writing five about vampires in three years Savile was looking for a new topic to write about without \\"Repeating\\" himself. He then learned that Stargate writer Sally Malcolm was looking for new writers for the franchise. After a few E-mails with Malcolm he got the job as a Stargate writer. When commenting on how to make a good tie-in novel for the franchise, he said it was \\"Tricky on a page-by-page level\\". He further stated that he couldn't create new stories because by the end of the day the Stargate franchise belonged to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). = Reception = The book Stargate Atlantis Exogenesis was nominated in the category \\"Best speculative fiction novel\\" in the Scribe awards written by Sonny Whitelaw and Elizabeth Christensen, but did not win the award. Author Elizabeth Christensen won the Scribe award in the category \\"Best Speculative Original novel\\" at ComicCon 2008 for her book Stargate Atlantis Casualties of War. The award was organized and presented by the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers (IAMTW) which was founded by Max Allan Collins and Lee Goldberg.

Whitwell is a small village located on the south of the Isle of Wight, approximately 5 kilometres north- west of Ventnor, the village's nearest town. At the 2011 Census the appropriate civil parish was Niton and Whitwell. In addition to this, it is about five minutes away from its neighbouring small villages of Godshill and Niton, the latter of which, Whitwell forms a civil parish. According to 2001 census data, the total population of the village was 578. There is a variety of stone and thatched housing, as well as some more modern housing, the most recent of which was completed in 2006. Whitwell's small size has led it to become a very close-knit community with a range of amenities including a garage, a 700-year-old church, the oldest pub on the island, dating back from the 15th century and a post office, which was recently re-located to a new premises inside the church bell tower. A trout farm is located towards Nettlecombe, with three lakes covering . The waters are well stocked with carp, roach and tench. Whitwell is named after the \\"White Well\\" inside the village. The well was visited by many during medieval times on pilgrimages, and now well dressing occurs annually each summer. Across Whitwell, six more old water standards can be seen. They were built in 1887 by William Spindler. Half the cost of installing the wells was covered by William Spindler himself, the remainder by people of the village. The water was supplied by Mr Granville Ward from a spring on his land at Bierley. History \\"White\\" is derived from an Old English word meaning clean or pure, and the village of Whitwell is likely to take its name from a well or spring with a reliable supply of fresh water. The original White Well, located towards the south end of the village was once a place of veneration as a 'holy well' and a site of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages. The waters of the well were believed to contain healing powers for the infirm. The tradition of Well Dressing was started and now occurs annually at the site of the well. Each year the well is dressed and blessed by the local vicar giving thanks for water and a blessing for the village. In the village, six red iron water pumps can be seen at various intervals. These were built in 1887 by William Spindler of St Lawrence whose tomb now lies in Whitwell Graveyard. One is located next to the White Well in Ventnor Road, two along Kemming Road, two along the High Street, and one on Nettlecombe Road. Many of the village's buildings such as the White Horse pub, date back to the 15th century. The Church has portions dating back to as far as the 12th century, with newer additions built in the 13th, 15th and 16th centuries. In comparison to this and the rest of the village, new housing has been built relatively recently along Bannock Road. The latest new housing was completed in 2006. In 2009 Whitwell won the award for the best kept large village, in addition to the award for the overall island's best kept village, an award it has previously won in 2003. Judges from the competition were impressed by maintenance of bus stops, verges seats, commercial premises and gardens and the success of the new post office. Governance Whitwell lies within the parliamentary constituency of the Isle of Wight with the seat held by Conservative member Bob Seely, and within the same area of the Isle of Wight Council. Together with Niton, the village forms a civil parish, chaired by Councillor Tim Addison. The Parish Council has ten members, six for the Niton ward and four for the Whitwell ward, and meets ten times annually. Geography A map of Whitwell and the surrounding area Whitwell is located in the south of the Isle of Wight, slightly to the south of Godshill, and extends to the southern end. The nearest town is Ventnor, about 5 kilometres South of the village. Niton is the nearest village about away, which together, Whitwell and Niton form a civil parish. Also close to the village, is Nettlecombe, the site of a lost medieval village located slightly to the north east. The entire village is surrounded mainly by fields and classed as an 'Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, forming part of the Isle of Wight AONB.' The relief is mainly flat, with some slight hills. It contains of land, in 1905 being arable land, 775¬Ω acres permanent grass, and 74¬Ω acres woodland. The River Yar's infant tributary in Whitwell With the villages co-ordinates at N 50.60223 W 1.29967, its climate is warm, with a sea breeze coming in from the coast. It benefits from Ventnor's micro-climate as a result of being in a sheltered location on the cliff of the island's south coast. This offers the village more sunny days than much of the British Isles, and fewer frosts. The Eastern Yar, with its mouth in the north-east of the island, extends an infant tributary to Whitwell and at one point, a stone sheep wash is still present. The River Yar Trail was set up on 24 May 2002, with a milestone outside the White Horse in Whitwell. Whitwell's built environment is characterised by its mixture of stone and thatched housing. There is a mixture of single and two- story houses, with most single-story housing on Bannock Road, recently developed with a small estate of bungalows. Terraced housing features in the centre of the village. The most notable house in the village is The Old Rectory, close to the church and was formerly a bed and breakfast. Church Whitwell parish church, with its unusual dedication to St Rhadegund The Church of St. Mary and St. Radegund is a Church of England church, located at the south end of the village, adjoining the rectory. It is the only church in the village. Parts of the church date back to different centuries, the earliest being 12th, with later parts added in the 13th, 15th and 16th century. In April 2007, the village's post office was relocated inside the church's bell tower, the first of its kind to actually be located inside the church. Amenities The village used to have a wide range of facilities used by local residents. However over the years, many of these have gone. These include two shops, a playgroup, its Methodist church, the forge, a nursing home and youth hostel. The facilities left include: The White Horse * Post Office ‚Äì The village used to have its own, family owned post office. This was closed in 2006, however later in 2007 was relocated onto a new premises inside the church. * Pub ‚Äì The White Horse in the village centre is a popular pub across the island. It suffered a fire in 1987, then again 20 years later in 2007 which saw its temporary closure. Prior to the two fires, the pub was thatched, however after the fire in 2007, a tiled roof was built, in an attempt to prevent future fires. * Garage ‚Äì The village's garage, named Whitwell garage is one of the few garages left on the island to still sell petrol (excluding supermarkets). It also sells cars, MOTs and servicing, specialising in Ford. * Village hall ‚Äì It is used to host a variety of activities, as well as the Whitwell Village Show, which takes place annually each summer. Due to the village's small size and small population of 578, most amenities are located outside the village. Many are located in the slightly larger neighbouring village of Niton, such as a Pharmacy and doctor's surgery. Others are located in the nearby town of Ventnor.  Events  = Whitfun = In 2012, Whitwell held a traditional street party in celebration of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The Kemming Road was closed to traffic for the day between the High Street and Bannock Road. It was a great success with over 100 children at the street party which was followed by games in the grounds of the Old Rectory and a party, with a hog roast, live music and the 'Red Gun bar', at Prospect Cottage. It was agreed to hold a similar event the following year - as a village party called Whitfun ( it was in Whitwell and held on the Whitsun Bank Holiday weekend). This has been held each year on the Saturday of the Spring Bank Holiday (traditionally Whitsun), moving from the garden of Prospect Cottage to the garden of the White Horse Inn in 2015. It still features a programme of live music and the 'Red Gun bar', despite being in the pub garden. Royal wedding 'carriage procession' at Whitfun 2018 In 2018, Whitfun moved to 19 May to celebrate the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. = Whitwell Church Fete = Each summer the village holds a fete, normally in July, in aid of church funds. This has been held in a number of locations including, in recent years, the Old Rectory grounds and Whitwell Manor Farm. Transport =Rail= An old section of railtrack, leading to Whitwell Station. Whitwell Station, on the Ventnor West branch of the Isle of Wight Central Railway, was opened along with the other stations on the branch on 20 July 1897. It was equipped with a passing loop, two platforms, a signal box and a substantial station building. Located at the top of Nettlecombe Lane, the station is located close to the village and the community it was intended to serve, unlike any other stations on the line. However the track has now closed, and the waiting rooms have now been converted into two cottages and the old up platform has been restored. The site is now a popular tourist destination and is used for holiday accommodation. An old railway tunnel just outside the village is used as a mushroom farm. Another tunnel is still present on Nettlecombe Lane (pictured to the left) leading to the station. =Bus= Southern Vectis bus route 6 links the village with the towns of Newport and Ventnor, including intermediate villages. The last bus from Newport is early at 18:22 providing no evening service for the village. The seasonal 'Island Coaster' also runs through the village during the summer. Wightbus and Southern Vectis take students to school, which has caused some controversy over two bus companies taking a small number of students to school. =Roads= A Map of Whitwell. There are only three roads exiting the village, Ventnor Road leading to Ventnor, Kemming Road leading to Niton and the main High Street which leads to Godshill. The main road leading to Ventnor has recently been widened and resurfaced to cope with the larger number of cars using it, however this has caused controversy with nearby residents with reports of many cars speeding through the village. A sign was later put up, warning motorists if their speed exceeded the 30-mile per hour speed limit. More were later put up across other parts of the village. =Walking= The River Yar trail runs through the village with the milestone outside the village Pub. In addition to this, bridleways are maintained, running to nearby villages Wroxall and Niton. Future plans could see a pedestrian link from Whitwell to Niton along the main road.

It was founded in 1820 by the local Baltic German landlord Graf Karl Friedrich von Rehbinder. Estonian brewing traditions and Saku Brewery Beer was already known in present-day Estonia between 500‚Äì1000 CE, when it was mostly used as a sacrificial drink. By the middle of the 13th century the first breweries were established in the more populous villages. Beer was brewed at home, in abbeys and castles ‚Äî it was the main drink together with small beer and milk. Soon beer became so frequently consumed that fees and penalties were added to its cost. Beer has become the main drink for Estonian farmers since the beginning of the 16th century. Beer was always brewed for bigger holidays and family events like wedding, baptisms and funerals. All kinds of beer songs and jokes relating to it were very popular among the common people. The history of Saku Brewery begins in early 19th century, when the owner of Saku estate at that time, ‚Äî a nobleman of Baltic German descent ‚Äî decided to build a distillery and a brewery on his land. The brewery was first documented in October 1820. It is believed that the production of beer, for the purpose of sale to pubs and taverns, began in the autumn of that year. From the end of 19th century onward, Saku has remained among the leading breweries in Estonia. Currently A view of the Saku Brewery (2004). In 1991, joint venture Saku √ïlletehas was established. Since January 27, 1998, the shares of Saku Brewery were traded in the list on the Tallinn Stock Exchange. On 20 September 2008, the shares of Saku √ïlletehase AS were delisted from Tallinn Stock Exchange. Today 100% of the shares are owned by Carlsberg Breweries. Through large investments, Saku Brewery has become the market leader on the Estonian beer market. According to market research by Nielsen Corporation in March 2009, Saku Brewery held 38.7% of the local market share. The total sales of beer by Saku amounted to 59 million litres in 2007. Beverages of Saku Brewery are exported amongst other countries to Sweden (the only Estonian beer in the Systembolaget is Saku Kuld), Finland, Netherlands, England, Germany, Ireland and Canada. Saku's exports during the first five months of 2009 amounted to 3.12 million litres. The interests of Estonia's three largest breweries are represented by the Estonian Beer Brewers Association: Saku Brewery, A. Le Coq Brewery and Viru Brewery. Products Saku Originaal, the brewery's flagship beer. Saku Originaal is the flagship product of Saku Brewery and is made of yeast, water and selected malt and hops. Brewing of Saku Originaal started in 1993, making it the first Estonian beer to be sold after Estonia regained its independence. According to market research conducted by Emor in 2002, Saku Originaal is the most recognised and popular Estonian beer. In April 2009, Saku Brewery invested over 70 million kroons into a new crystal-filtering technology, the first brewery to employ this technology in Estonia. Saku Originaal was the first beer to be brewed using this technology. Crystal- filtering helps remove bacteria from the beer during brewing, giving the beer a longer lifetime and stronger taste.

It extends from Culver Down, near Yaverland in the northeast of the Island, to just south of Shanklin, near the village of Luccombe in the southwest. At Luccombe, the bay is separated from The Undercliff by a large headland from which Upper Ventnor sits atop. The towns of Shanklin, Lake and Sandown are on the bay's coast, while Luccombe and Upper Ventnor feature panoramic views across both Sandown Bay to the East and the Undercliff to the southwest. Due to the bay being relatively sheltered from offshore winds it is often used as temporary anchorage point for boats, including large cargo ships, before continuing east towards Continental Europe, or north towards The Solent. History The white cliffs of Culver Down painted by A. Heaton Cooper In the past, the bay had significant military importance as the wide beach offered a good landing-point for an armed invasion of the Island. To protect against a French or Spanish invasion, Henry VIII built Sandown Castle in the centre of the bay as part of his chain of coastal defences to protect the South-Coast of England. However, the castle was still under construction during the French invasion of the Isle of Wight of 1545 when it was overwhelmed. This castle fell into disrepair due to coastal erosion and was demolished in 1631, though the remains of the foundations of the castle are still visible along the shore at low tide.; ; Sandown Fort, also known as the Diamond Fort after its arrow-headed bastions, this was built using the remains of the old castle further up the coast. As a result of its sandy beach and good weather, Sandown and Shanklin grew rapidly in the Victorian era as tourists from across both the Island and the country came to enjoy the seaside thanks to new the transportation connections of the railway and paddle steamers. This transformed a relatively sparsely populated area into a series of bustling seaside resorts. New developments included a long promenade, many large seafront hotels and the 875 foot Sandown Pier (originally 360 ft when opened in 1879). A lot of Victorian-influenced architecture can still be seen throughout the bay. Geography Sandown Bay at Lake, looking north-east towards Sandown, with Yaverland and Culver Down in the distance Sandown Bay is an excellent example of a concordant coastline and has well-developed sandy beaches stretching all the way from Shanklin to Culver Down due to Longshore drift. The bay has over 5 miles of unbroken sandy beach, making it one of the longest beaches in the British Isles. The area has weak sandstone cliffs which vary from , these have suffered from erosion and instability in the past. The risk of cliff-failures affecting populated tourist areas led the Isle of Wight Council to commission a report and an extensive structural stabilisation programme in 1988. The bay is best viewed from Culver Down to the north. The Isle of Wight Coastal Path follows the whole bay-line either along the cliff top to the south of Sandown or the concrete seawall north of Sandown. The bay itself has a seabed consisting of a mixture of sand, shells and gravel with shallow waters out till about . The total area of the bay is . Economy and tourism The economy of the bay is dominated by retail and hospitality sectors due to a large amount of tourism it receives, an estimate of 500,000 visitors annually. However, the average earnings of people living around the bay are approximately 10% below the national average. A local action-plan, the Bay Area Action Plan, has been set up in 2016 for the development of the bay for the next 15 years. It plans to get local and national funding with the aim to improve public spaces and increase the level of tourism. The bay has a combined total of 21,374 inhabitants. Maritime incidents The outer bay is used as a sheltered anchorage. Ships requiring salvage have sometimes been towed there, such as the tanker Tarpenbeck in 1979. The wreck of a salvage tug (the Harry Sharman) which assisted the stricken tanker Pacific Glory in 1970, Isle of Wight History and Heritage, the Pacific Glory was visible for some decades at low tide below Culver Cliffs.

Life and work Friedrich von H√ºgel was born in Florence, Italy, in 1852, to Charles von H√ºgel, who was serving as Austrian ambassador to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and a Scottish mother, Elizabeth Farquharson, who was a convert to Roman Catholicism.\\"Friedrich von H√ºgel\\", The Gifford Lectures The young Friedrich was educated privately, and in 1867 moved with his family to England, when he was fifteen, remaining there for the rest of his life. It has been suggested that Count Felix Sumarokov- Elston, an ataman of the Kuban Cossacks, was his elder half-brother; but as the Count was born in 1820 this is most unlikely, and the Count is more likely to have been his uncle, the son of H√ºgel's father.. In 1873 he married Lady Mary Catherine Herbert (1849‚Äì1935), daughter of the statesman Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea, by Elizabeth Ash √† Court-Repington, an ardent convert to Roman Catholicism and a philanthropist. Mary, like H√ºgel's mother and her own, was also a convert. The couple had three daughters: Gertrude (1877‚Äì1915), Hildegarde (1879‚Äì1926), and Thekla (1886‚Äì1970), who became a Carmelite nun. H√ºgel remained an Austrian citizen until he found himself to be a \\"hostile alien\\" after Britain declared war on Austria-Hungary in August 1914. He applied for naturalisation and received it in December of the same year. H√ºgel was a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire, an inherited title, and a frequent visitor to Rome. A self-taught biblical scholar, he was fluent in French, German, and Italian, as well as his adopted English. A master of many subjects, he never held office in the Church, nor any academic post, nor did he ever earn a university degree. However, he is often mentioned alongside John Henry Newman as one of the most influential Roman Catholic thinkers of his day. The scope of his learning was impressive, and the list of his correspondents reads like a \\"who's who\\" of nineteenth- and early twentieth- century European religious leadership (for example, Louis Duchesne, Alfred Loisy, Germain Morin, Maurice Blondel, Henri Br√©mond, John Henry Newman, William George Ward, Wilfrid Philip Ward, Lord Halifax, Cuthbert Butler, Claude Montefiore, George Tyrrell, Maude Petre, Evelyn Underhill, Antonio Fogazzaro, Ernesto Buonaiuti, Rudolf Christoph Eucken, Hans Vaihinger, Franz Xaver Kraus, and Ernst Troeltsch). In Italy, H√ºgel frequently met two future popes, Achille Ratti and Eugenio Pacelli, later Pius XI and Pius XII. In Milan in 1901 Ratti helped him with his research at the Ambrosiana for The Mystical Element of Religion. H√ºgel did much to bring the work of the philosophers Eucken and Troeltsch to the attention of the English-speaking public, despite the hostility during and after the First World War to all things Germany. =Modernism= Baron von H√ºgel was deeply engaged in theological discussions with a wide group of scholars associated with the turn-of-the-century Modernist controversy. \\"He shared with other modernists a belief that science had raised new questions for religious faith and that undermined any na√Øve suppositions that believers could rely purely on dogmatic authority as a source of truth.\\" His scholarly concerns included the relationship of Christianity to history, ecumenism, mysticism, the philosophy of religion, and the rejection of much of the immanentism in nineteenth-century theology. Von H√ºgel supported Alfred Loisy in his troubles with ecclesiastical authorities because he understood Loisy's biblical criticism as valid historical apologetics for the Catholic Church. He was a close friend of George Tyrrell, and the two would exchange and proof each other's writing. Under Pope Pius X, prompted by conservatives such as Cardinal Rafael Merry del Val, there was a backlash against many of the Modernist thinkers, and H√ºgel attempted to negotiate a middle way of restraint, while remaining true to the principles of intellectual rigour and free enquiry. When the University of Oxford granted him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree in 1920, it was the first time since the Reformation that a Roman Catholic had been so honoured by that university. The University of St. Andrews, where the H√ºgel archives. are now located, had awarded him an honorary degree in 1914. H√ºgel died in 1925. He was buried, beside his mother and sister, with the Benedictines of Downside, beside the abbey. His tombstone in an English country churchyard bears the simple inscription: \\"Whom have I in heaven but Thee?\\" The Mystical Element of Religion Friedrich von H√ºgel's major work was The Mystical Element of Religion as Studied in St. Catherine of Genoa and Her Friends (1908). Writing in The Guardian after H√ºgel's death, William Temple gave his judgement of its value: > It is quite arguable that this is the most important theological work > written in the English language during the last half-century. Its greatness, > like all true greatness in this field, consists in its combination of > qualities usually found in separation from each other. It is a masterpiece > of detailed critical study, yet it is a massive presentation of fundamental > principle. It is a penetrating piece of psychological analysis, while it is > also a great achievement in constructive philosophy. The most striking > section of it ‚Äî the introduction ‚Äî has so deeply permeated the thought of > our time that its leading conception has become a commonplace among many who > have never read the book, or even who have never heard of it. This leading > conception is, of course, the necessity of three elements in any religion > which is to be both full and living ‚Äî the mystical, the intellectual, the > institutional. His statement of the necessity of each of these, and of the > consequent need to harmonize and balance them, is unanswerable.The Guardian, > 6 February 1925 H√ºgel's The Mystical Element of Religion is a critical but largely appreciative philosophy of mysticism. Yet, in many ways throughout this work von H√ºgel counsels the reader of mysticism's potential dangers. The mystical impulse is but one of the three elements that together with the other two constitutes the rich complexity of existence. H√ºgel cautions: \\"...mysticism would never be the whole of religion; it would become a dangerous error the very moment it claimed to be this whole; but, at the same time, it would be an element essential to religion in the long run and upon the whole, although it would‚Ä¶ possess its own dangers, its own besetting sins, as indeed also the primitive, na√Øve type of religion possesses its own different dangers and different besetting sins.\\"von H√ºgel, Friedrich. The Reality of God and Agnosticism, 1931, p. 91 The three elements H√ºgel's \\"three elements of religion\\" are his most enduring contribution to theological thinking. The human soul, the movements of western civilisation, and the phenomena of religion itself he characterised by these three elements: the historical/institutional element, the intellectual/speculative element, and the mystical/experiential element. This typology provided for him an understanding of the balance, tension, and 'friction' that exists in religious thinking and in the complexity of reality and existence. It is an organising paradigm that remained central to his project. The effort to hold these sometimes disparate dimensions together is structurally and theologically dominant throughout his writing. His friend George Tyrrell observed, \\"All life, according to [H√ºgel] consists in a patient struggle with irreconcilables‚Äîa progressive unifying of parts that will never fit perfectly.\\" H√ºgel and Yeats William Butler Yeats addressed Friedrich von H√ºgel in the last stanza of \\"Vacillation\\": Must we part, Von H√ºgel, though much alike, for we Accept the miracles of the saints and honour sanctity? The body of Saint Teresa lies undecayed in tomb, Bathed in miraculous oil, sweet odours from it come, Healing from its lettered slab. Those self-same hands perchance Eternalised the body of a modern saint that once Had scooped out Pharaoh's mummy. I ‚Äì though heart might find relief Did I become a Christian man and choose for my belief What seems most welcome in the tomb ‚Äì play a predestined part. Homer is my example and his unchristened heart. The lion and the honeycomb, what has Scripture said? So get you gone, Von H√ºgel, though with blessings on your head. H√ºgel and Flannery O'Connor In The Habit of Being: Letters of Flannery O'Connor, published posthumously in 1979, O'Connor refers often to von H√ºgel, especially in writing to a correspondent in the process of conversion to Catholicism. A Subversive Gospel by Michael Bruner also examines her Catholicism and H√ºgel's influence. Legacy With a deep commitment to the life of prayer, von H√ºgel was an authority on the great mystical writers, particularly of the pre-Reformation period, and sympathetic to the emotional and spiritual burdens of humanity, so that he was sought out by many as a counsellor, guide, and spiritual mentor. His authority as a spiritual writer has endured through the posthumous publication of many of his letters: Selected Letters, 1896‚Äì1924, 1927, Letters from Baron Friedrich von H√ºgel to a Niece, 1928, and Spiritual Counsels and Letters of Baron Friedrich von H√ºgel, 1964. The Von H√ºgel Institute,. a research centre for the study of Christianity and society at St. Edmund's College, the University of Cambridge, was founded in 1987, and is named in honour of Friedrich's brother, Anatole von H√ºgel, the first director of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology at Cambridge. A plaque was erected in 1968 by the Greater London Council outside his former home at 4 Holford Road, Hampstead, London, NW3 1AD, London Borough of Camden.\\"Von H√ºgel, Baron Friedrich\\", English Heritage Works In addition to extensive correspondence, his published works include: * The Mystical Element of Religion: as studied in Saint Catherine of Genoa and her friends, 2 vols, (1908, revised 1923: Vol. I; Vol. II ) * Eternal Life (1912) * The German Soul (1916) * Essays and Addresses on the Philosophy of Religion (Vol. I 1921; Vol II 1926) The Reality of God and Religion and Agnosticism (1931).

Protothreads function as stackless, lightweight threads, or coroutines, providing a blocking context cheaply using minimal memory per protothread (on the order of single bytes). Protothreads are used to accomplish a non- preempted form of concurrency known as cooperative multitasking and, therefore, do not incur context switch when yielding to another thread. Within a protothread, yielding is accomplished by utilizing Duff's device within a thread's function and an external variable used in within the switch statement. This allows jumping (resuming) from a yield upon another function call. In order to block threads, these yields may be guarded by a conditional so that successive calls to the same function will yield unless the guard conditional is true. A feature of protothreads relative to other implementations of coroutines, or proper threads, is that they are stackless. This has advantages and disadvantages. A disadvantage is that local variables within the protothread cannot be trusted to have retained their values across a yield to another context. They must retain their state through the use of static or external, often global, variables.A. Dunkels, O. Schmidt, T. Voigt, and M. Ali, Protothreads: Simplifying Event-Driven Programming of Memory- Constrained Embedded Systems, Proc. ACM SenSys, Boulder, CO, USA, Nov 2006. (PDF, Presentation slides) An advantage is that they are very lightweight and therefore useful on severely memory constrained systems like small microcontrollers where other solutions are impractical or less desirable. Tom Duff, of Duff's device fame, had this to say about the shortcomings of the method: \\"a similar trick for interrupt-driven state machines that is too horrible to go into. [...] I never thought it was an adequate general-purpose coroutine implementation because it‚Äôs not easy to have multiple simultaneous activations of a coroutine and it‚Äôs not possible using this method to have coroutines give up control anywhere but in their top-level routine.

Sodium bisulfate is an acid salt formed by partial neutralization of sulfuric acid by an equivalent of sodium base, typically in the form of either sodium hydroxide (lye) or sodium chloride (table salt). It is a dry granular product that can be safely shipped and stored. The anhydrous form is hygroscopic. Solutions of sodium bisulfate are acidic, with a 1M solution having a pH of around 1. Production Sodium bisulfate is produced as an intermediate in the Mannheim process, an industrial process involving the reaction of sodium chloride and sulfuric acid: :NaCl + H2SO4 ‚Üí HCl + NaHSO4 This step is highly exothermic. The liquid sodium bisulfate is sprayed and cooled so that it forms a solid bead. The hydrogen chloride gas is dissolved in water to produce hydrochloric acid as a useful coproduct of the reaction. Although not of commercial interest, sodium bisulfate can be generated as a byproduct of the production of many other mineral acids via the reaction of their sodium salts with an excess of sulfuric acid: :NaX + H2SO4 ‚Üí NaHSO4 + HX ( X‚àí = CN‚àí, NO3‚àí, ClO4‚àí) The acids HX produced have a lower boiling point than the reactants and are separated from the reaction mixture by distillation. =Chemical reactions= Hydrated sodium bisulfate dehydrates at at which point it separates from the water molecule attached to it. Once cooled again, it is freshly hygroscopic. Heating sodium bisulfate to produces sodium pyrosulfate, another colorless salt: :2 NaHSO4 ‚Üí Na2S2O7 + H2O Uses Sodium bisulfate is used primarily to lower pH. it also is used in metal finishing, cleaning products,John Toedt, Darrell Koza, Kathleen Van Cleef-Toedt Chemical Composition of Everyday Products p.147 and to lower the pH of water for effective chlorination in swimming pools and hot tubs. Sodium bisulfate is also AAFCO approved as a general-use feed additive, including companion animal food. It is used as a urine acidifier to reduce urinary stones in cats. It is highly toxic to certain echinoderms, but fairly harmless to most other life forms; so it is used in controlling outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish. Sodium bisulfate was the primary active ingredient in the toilet bowl cleaners Vanish and Sani- Flush, both now discontinued.SANI-FLUSH¬Æ Powder (Discontinued), Reckitt Benckiser. In the textiles industry, it is sometimes applied to velvet cloth made with a silk backing and a pile of cellulose-based fiber (rayon, cotton, hemp, etc.) to create \\"burnout velvet\\": the sodium bisulfate, when applied to such a fabric and heated, causes the cellulose-based fibers to become brittle and flake away, leaving burned-out areas in the finished material, usually in attractive patterns. Sodium bisulfate is the active ingredient in some granular poultry litter treatments used to control ammonia. Sodium bisulfate has also been shown to significantly reduce the concentration of Campylobacter and Salmonella in chicken houses. =In food= Sodium bisulfate is used as a food additive to leaven cake mixes (make them rise) as well as being used in meat and poultry processing and most recently in browning prevention of fresh- cut produce. Sodium bisulfate is considered generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA. The food-grade product also meets the requirements set out in the Food Chemicals Codex. It is denoted by E number E514ii in the EU and is also approved for use in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Mexico. where it is listed as additive 514. Food grade sodium bisulfate is used in a variety of food products, including beverages, dressings, sauces, and fillings. It has many synonyms including bisulfate of soda, sodium acid sulfate, mono sodium hydrogen sulfate, sodium hydrogen sulfate, sodium hydrosulfate, and sulfuric acid sodium salt (1:1). Sodium bisulfate is considered natural by the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) since it is made from minerals. However, all commercially available sodium bisulfate is produced from sulfuric acid synthesized from elemental sulfur via the contact process. Sodium bisulfate lowers the pH without a sour taste and has been used in the place of citric, malic or phosphoric acids that's commercially available and can also be used as an anti-browning agent.

Production = Background = The pocket books were originally published irregularly (about 6 times a year) until 1987 and monthly since. They are roughly A5-sized (digest size) and about 250 pages thick. Each book has about eight stories, but the numbers of stories can vary widely from issue to issue. As of 10 September 2019, there are 524 issues. Almost all stories come from European publishers - namely Mondadori/Disney Italy from Italy and, more recently, Egmont from Denmark. Most of the artists are from Italy (among the most famous and internationally renowned being Romano Scarpa, Marco Rota, Pier Lorenzo De Vita, Massimo De Vita, Giorgio Cavazzano, Giovan Battista Carpi, Luciano Bottaro) with a minority of Danish artists (such as Flemming Andersen), and very few stories are drawn by Spanish and Argentinian artists. =Production process= Just like their larger, comic book-sized European Disney comic counterparts and as is common with North-American superhero comics, hardly any story published in the pocket books is made by one single person, instead each story is a combined effort. An author writes a story for which the production company assigns an artist whose unique style they think most resembles the story's particular spirit, then the artist's drawings are completed, again as by management directions, first by a particular inker and then a particular colorist. These groupings can at times be only loose and variable from story to story (especially stable author-artist groupings are rare), but particular artist-inker-colorist groupings can last long enough to define what later is recognized as an artist's defined \\"style period\\". It was not until the late 1990s that the production companies began to print at least author and artist of each Disney story in their publications. =B/W vs. color= Until issue #118, a particular limitation of the pocket books out of economical reasons was that only half of the pages were printed in color, while for the other half simply the uncolored line art was printed. This was done in an alternating routine so that one pair of pages (left and right page) one was looking at was black and white, and turning to the next pair of pages they were in color, etc. It was not until issue #119 (spring 1987, shortly before the move to monthly issues) that the pocket books were printed in full color. In later reprints, these early issues were published in all-color. =Mini pocket books= In the late 2000s, \\"mini\\" pocket books have also appeared. These mini pocket books are smaller (A6-sized rather than A5-sized) but have slightly more pages, and consist almost exclusively of reprints of stories in previously appeared full-size pocket books, rather than all-new material. Distinguishing features = Framework stories = A special feature of the early issues of pocket books were the so-called framework stories. In these early days, the stories used to be connected with each other by a framework story, forming a general story line throughout the entire book. For every of those early issues, the publishers mostly chose unrelated stories from a large pool, and it was only after those stories had been chosen that a fitting framework would be written, then drawn in a sub-standard quality style by artist Giuseppe Perego. As the feature gradually fell out of use, Perego was partly replaced by Giancarlo Gatti, an artist whose quality is more on par with that of the usual production level and who like Perego often publishes full-length main stories instead of only doing \\"filler\\" frameworks in between these. The framework feature was gradually dropped during the 1980s (roughly between the issues #80-#100), as nowadays each story is usually completely independent from the other stories in the same issue. = Spine-assembly pictures = Since the same issue as full-color was introduced, the pocket books also feature pictures of Disney characters on their spines, a feature especially appealing to collectors as these pictures make it instantly apparent if an issue is missing when the pocket books are lined up on a cupboard. The first spine-assembly picture ran from 1987 until late 1991/early 1992, since then each spine picture (usually) spans a year (= 12 issues). = \\"Choose your own adventure\\" stories = Some of the stories have a \\"choose your own adventure\\" aspect. The reading order of the story is not completely linear. At the end of approximately every fourth page a choice is presented to the reader about what the character should do next, with two or three options. The reader makes their choice by turning to the page mentioned in the option. Thus, stories of this kind have about six to eight alternative endings. In different countries The same stories, which are mostly written and drawn by Italian writers and artists, are translated into different languages and appear in each country roughly about the same time, but there are differences of one or two months between the publishing schedules of different countries. As there was no connection between issues other than the recurring cast of characters, the early issues (until about #30?) were mostly published in different order all over Europe, so the German #3 for instance is not the same as the Danish, French, or Finnish #3.

It was first characterized in 1909, and is named for George Alfred Carpenter. Presentation Carpenter syndrome presents several features: * Tower-shaped skull (craniosynostosis) * Additional or fused digits (fingers and toes) * Obesity * Reduced height Intellectual disability is also common with the disorder, although some patients may have average intellectual capacity. =Description= Carpenter Syndrome belongs to a group of rare genetic disorders known as acrocephalopolysyndactyly, abbreviated ACPS (RN, 2007). There were originally five types of ACPS, but this number has been decreased because they have been found to be closely related to one another or to other disorders (Paul A. Johnson, 2002). The most common physical manifestation of Carpenter Syndrome is early fusing of the fibrous cranial sutures which results in an abnormally pointed head. The fusion of the skull bones is evident from birth (National Organization for Rare Disorders, Inc., 2008). Babies‚Äô mobile cranial bones form a cone shape as they pass through the birth canal and soon thereafter return to a normal shape; however, a baby affected by carpenter syndrome maintains a cone shaped head. A baby affected by Carpenter Syndrome will also display malformations of the face. An individual affected by the syndrome may have broad cheeks, a flat nasal bridge, and a wide upturned nose with abnormally large nasal openings. Their ears will most commonly be low, unevenly set, and malformed in structure. In addition to these facial abnormalities, individuals also have an underdeveloped maxilla and/or mandible with a highly arched and narrow palate which makes speech a very difficult skill to master. Teeth are usually very late to come in and will be undersized and spaced far apart (Carpenter Syndrome-description). Other physical abnormalities often associated with Carpenter Syndrome include extra digits. Extra toes are more commonly seen than fingers. Often both the toes and fingers are webbed, a process that occurs before the sixth week gestational period. Often their digits will be abnormally short, and the fingers are commonly missing an interphalangeal joint. Roughly half of the babies born with Carpenter Syndrome have some type of heart defect, and seventy five percent of individuals with this disease will experience some degree of development delay due to mild mental retardation (Carpenter Syndrome-description). Genetics Carpenter syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Carpenter syndrome has been associated with mutations in the RAB23 gene, which is located on chromosome 6 in humans. Additionally, three key SNPs in the MEGF8 gene, located on chromosome 19 at 19q13.2, have been identified as primary causes of Carpenter syndrome. Diagnosis The diagnosis of Carpenter Syndrome is made based on the presence of the bicoronal and sagittal skull malformations, which results in a pointed, cone-shaped or short, broad head. The diagnosis is also made based on the presence of extra or fused digits. X rays and/ or CT scans of the skull may be performed in order to accurately diagnose the individual; however, other genetic disorders, which have available genetic tests, are also characterized by skull malformations. A positive result on these tests can rule out a Carpenter Syndrome diagnosis. =Types= The primary diagnostic factor is a malformation of the skull. The two most common types of craniosynostosis are sagittal and bicoronal. Sagittal craniosynostosis manifests itself by causing a long narrow skull, resembling a football. It is quantitatively determined by measuring the anterior to posterior (front to back) diameter of the skull. An increased A-P diameter indicates a malformed fusion of the sagittal suture. Individuals affected with sagittal craniosynostosis have narrow, prominent foreheads and the back of the head is much larger than normal. The ‚Äúsoft spot‚Äù is very small or missing altogether with this particular type of craniosynostosis. The second common type of skull malformation is bicoronal craniosynostosis is characterized by a wide, short skull. In this particular type of craniosynostosis the A-P diameter is smaller than in normal individuals. These individuals have malformed eye sockets and foreheads. The eye sockets are much smaller than normal and often cause visual impairment. Complications may include damage to the optic nerve, resulting in a decrease in visual clarity, bulging eyeballs as a result of shallow eye orbits which usually causes some sort of damage to the cornea (the outer layer of the eye). Bicoronal craniosynostosis may also result in widely spaced eyes and narrowing of the sinuses and tear ducts that may result in inflammation of the mucous membranes of the exposed portion of the eye. In addition to the previously named complications of bicoronal craniosynostosis, many babies will also be affected by hydrocephalus, more commonly known as water on the brain. Hydrocephalus results in increased pressure on the brain which can cause permanent brain damage if not treated promptly. An abnormally highly arched palate is also seen in affected individuals causing dental problems and the thrusting forward of the lower jaw. Individuals affected by Carpenter syndrome often experience cutaneous syndactyly (fusion of the digits) or polydactyly (presence of extra digits) of the toes more often than fingers. Individuals also have short fingers. Approximately one third of individuals born with Carpenter Syndrome have a type of heart defect. Commonly seen heart defects may include: narrowing of the pulmonary artery, transposition of the major blood vessels, or the presence of an abnormally large vena cava, which delivers blood back to the heart from the head, neck, and upper limbs. The testes of males affected by Carpenter Syndrome may also fail to descend (Paul A. Johnson, 2002). Treatment Operations to correct the malformations of the skull should be performed within the first year of infancy in patients affected by Carpenter Syndrome. Performing surgery at a young age increases the likelihood of obtaining a greatly improved appearance of the head because modifying bone is much easier to do when the skull is still constantly growing and changing. In surgery the doctor breaks the fused sutures to allow for brain growth. Doctors remove the cranial plates of the skull, reshape them and replace them back onto the skull in an attempt to reshape the head to appear more normal. Although the sutures are broken during surgery they will quickly refuse, and in some cases holes form in the plates allowing cerebral spinal fluid to escape into cyst like structures on the external surface of the head.Carpenter Syndrom-What is it?, 2007 If an individual with Carpenter Syndrome has a serious heart defect they will require surgery to correct the malformation of the heart. Other elective surgeries may also be performed. Some parents opt to have their child‚Äôs webbed fingers or toes separated which improves their appearance but not necessarily the functionality of the digits. In order to address the occupational challenges of the disease, many children with Carpenter Syndrome go through speech and occupational therapy in order to achieve more independence in everyday tasks and activities (RN, 2007). In order to address the vision problems that are associated with bicoronal craniosynostosis, the individual must seek consultation from an ophthalmologist. If the palate is severely affected dental consultation may be necessary to correct the malformation. Obesity is often associated with Carpenter Syndrome, so a lifelong diet plan is often utilized to maintain a healthy weight. In addition surgery must be performed if the testes fail to descend (Paul A. Johnson, 2002). If the procedure is not performed the individual will become infertile. Occurrence There are approximately three hundred known cases of Carpenter Syndrome in the United States. Only 1 in 1 million live births will result in an infant affected by Carpenter Syndrome (RN, 2007). Carpenter Syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease which means both parents must have the faulty genes in order to pass the disease onto their children. Even if both parents possess the faulty gene there is still only a twenty five percent chance that they will produce a child affected by the syndrome. Their children who do not have the disease will still be carriers and possess the ability to pass the disease onto their offspring if their spouse is also a carrier of the particular gene.Paul A.

A left-arm fast bowler, he is best known for two matters that were unrelated to his skill as a player: He was the batsman run out by Joe Solomon in 1960, causing the first Tied Test in cricket history; and in December 1963, his career was sensationally ended when he was called for throwing in the First Test against South Africa by Australian umpire Col Egar. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, there had been a media frenzy about the perceived prevalence of illegal bowling actions in world cricket. The controversy and speculation that dogged Meckiff in the years preceding his final match caused sections of the cricket community to believe that he had been made a scapegoat by the Australian cricket authorities to prove their intent to stamp out throwing. With an unconventional front-on bowling action, Meckiff progressed through the district cricket ranks at South Melbourne Cricket Club, making his first-class debut for Victoria in 1956‚Äì57. After a productive first season, Meckiff was named in a new-look Australian team for the 1957‚Äì58 tour of South Africa. This was the result of a generational change in the Australian Test team after a decline in performances in the 1950s. The shift saw Meckiff open the bowling in his debut Test, where he performed strongly to take eight wickets. Generating his pace from an unusual bent-arm action which involved a flick of the wrist, Meckiff reached his peak in the Second Test of the 1958‚Äì59 season against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He took 6/38 in the second innings as England were dismissed for 87, setting up an Australian victory. His achievement was engulfed by controversy, as English media and former players accused him of throwing Australia to victory. The controversy over Meckiff's action persisted as throwing was in the spotlight in England, where it was regarded as a growing problem. The issue prompted numerous international discussions and meetings on amending the throwing law and the interpretation thereof. An expected confrontation with English umpires in 1961 was averted when the bowler suffered multiple injuries in the preceding Australian summer and was omitted from the team to tour England, but Meckiff had two strong seasons in domestic cricket that forced the Australian selectors to recall him for the Tests against South Africa in 1963‚Äì64. The Victorian's recall had occurred despite his being no-balled for throwing in two separate Sheffield Shield matches in the previous season. In his first over of the Test, Meckiff was no-balled four times by umpire Egar. Australian captain Richie Benaud chose to not bowl his paceman again, and Meckiff retired from all cricket at the end of the match. The throwing controversy provoked heavy debate among cricket commentators, players and umpires, past and present; some praised Egar's no-ball call while others condemned the umpire and felt that the paceman had bowled in the same way as he had always done. Others felt that Meckiff had been set up so that he would be no-balled in an \\"execution\\" or \\"sacrifice\\" to prove Australia's resolve against throwing. Early life Meckiff was the second of three children born to Vera and Walter Meckiff; he had an older brother Don and a younger sister Margaret. Growing up in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Mentone, the children went to Mentone Primary School before progressing to Mordialloc-Chelsea High School, where both brothers became prefects. All of the children represented their high school for sport‚ÄîDon and Ian in athletics, swimming, football and cricket; and Margaret in softball. The brothers played for Mentone Cricket Club in the Federal District Cricket Association, Ian as a left-arm unorthodox spinner. He routinely dominated the opposition batsmen in the competition, taking 200 wickets at a bowling average of only 4.50 during his career with Mentone. He began playing in Mentone's under-16 team at the age of 11. Early career Having failed as a spin bowler in a trial at Richmond in 1950, Meckiff switched to fast bowling in 1951‚Äì52 when he began his district career in Victorian Premier Cricket with South Melbourne.Cashman, p. 211. He started in the Fourth XI after his brother had to withdraw from a match. The following summer, aged 17, Meckiff was in the senior team and played in South Melbourne's first championship-winning side in his debut season in the First XI, although his club career was sometimes interrupted by national service in the reserves. After receiving requests from cricket administrators, the military authorities scheduled the leave of young players for weekends, so that the impact on their careers would be minimised.Haigh, p. 27. At the time, Australia lacked bowlers of great pace, so a teammate advised Meckiff to bowl as fast as he could, without regard for accuracy‚Äîa plan he successfully adopted.Haigh, p. 108. Meckiff made his first-class debut for Victoria in 1956‚Äì1957 against Western Australia. Coming in to bat with his state's score at 8 wickets for 77 (8/77), he made 19 not out to help them reach 131, before taking three wickets for 45 runs (3/45) to restrict Western Australia to a 34-run first innings lead. His first wicket was future Australian captain Bob Simpson for a duck, and he followed up by removing Test batsmen Barry Shepherd and Ken Meuleman. Meckiff made 11 in the second innings and took 0/40 as Victoria lost by four wickets. Meckiff's most prominent showing in his debut season was in the Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales during the Christmas period of 1956. At the time, the two states were by far the strongest in Australia; in the past decade, the teams had 18 of the 20 top-two Shield placings between them, and New South Wales were in the process of winning nine consecutive titles. The arch-rivals were at full strength as no international matches were held during the season. Coming in at 7/173, Meckiff top-scored with 55‚Äîhis only first-class 50‚Äîas Victoria batted first and made a late recovery to end with 244.Pollard, p. 114. Meckiff took 3/65, including the wickets of Test players Bill Watson and Richie Benaud as New South Wales responded with 281. In the Victorian second innings Meckiff managed only 8 as Victoria left their opponents a target of 161 runs for victory. The paceman took 4/56 and claimed the final wicket, removing Test opener Jim Burke caught for 8 as New South Wales mustered 160, causing the match to end in the first tie in Shield history.Coleman, p. 499. Burke had returned to bat after being injured earlier in the innings, while New South Wales captain Ian Craig, who had been ill, hauled himself out of bed in an attempt to salvage the match after his team had fallen to 7/70. Meckiff's other victims in the final innings included Test players Alan Davidson and Johnny Martin. Strong showings for Victoria earned Meckiff selection in Neil Harvey's XI for the one-off match against Ray Lindwall's XI at the start of January 1957. These annual fixtures were used as trials for the leading players vying for national selection.Pollard, pp. 113‚Äì114. Lindwall's men batted first and made 428; Meckiff was the most successful bowler, taking 6/75 while his fellow-bowlers struggled to make inroads into the opposition batsmen. His first wicket was Test batsman Ken Mackay for 99, and he followed this by removing Bob Simpson, Norm O'Neill and Graeme Hole in the middle-order. Meckiff followed his productive bowling with 47 runs in a tail-wagging performance, adding 71 for the eighth wicket with Wally Grout as Harvey's men responded with 419. The Victorian took 0/18 in the second innings as Lindwall's team fell for 188 to leave Harvey's XI with a victory target of 198, which was achieved with seven wickets in hand. Meckiff had performed strongly in his debut first-class season, ending with 27 wickets at an average of 23.66. He was the ninth- highest wicket-taker for the Australian summer and his average was superior to all eight bowlers who took more wickets. At season's end, he was rewarded with selection for Australia's non-Test tour of New Zealand in February and March 1957. The hosts had Test status at the time, but Australia refused to ratify games against their trans-Tasman neighbours as Test matches, citing the weakness of the New Zealand team.Pollard, pp. 115‚Äì116.Haigh, p. 104. The tour represented a changing of the guard in Australian cricket following the tour of England and the Indian subcontinent in 1956, with the bowling line-up heavily overhauled due to advancing age, injury and loss of form. Australia had lost three Ashes series in a row, and captain Ian Johnson and his deputy Keith Miller retired upon their return home.Perry, p. 192.Perry, p. 198. Johnson was Australia's first-choice spinner while Miller and the 35-year-old Ray Lindwall had formed Australia's new ball pairing for the previous decade.Cashman, pp. 174‚Äì175. In addition, the fast bowling all rounder Ron Archer suffered a long-term knee injury during the 1956 tour,Cashman, pp. 8‚Äì12. while paceman Pat Crawford played only one first-class match in 1956‚Äì57 after his marriage broke down.Cashman, pp. 67‚Äì71. In the wake of Australia's decline in the past five years, the selectors turned to youth in an attempt to rebuild the side, resting several established Test representatives from the side.Pollard, pp. 110‚Äì117. Ian Craig was installed as the nation's youngest ever captain at the age of 22, having previously played only six Tests without securing a regular position in the team.Cashman, p. 67. The New Zealand campaign was a chance for the younger players to establish themselves in the national team. Meckiff took 2/46 and 3/25 in his first-class debut for Australia, an innings win over Otago. He played in the first match against New Zealand, but after taking 0/41 in a drawn encounter, he was dropped for the second game. The paceman forced his way back into the team for the third match after claiming 4/12 and 5/48 to help to set up an innings victory over Auckland. In the final match, New Zealand batted first and Meckiff played a leading role in Australia's victory, taking 4/28 from 27.2 overs to help dismiss the hosts for 198. The fast bowler was not required to bat as the tourists replied with 8/350 declared. He took 2/17 in the second innings as the home team fell for 161 before Craig's men sealed the series with a 10-wicket win. Meckiff ended the tour with 20 first-class wickets at 10.85, placing him top of the tour bowling averages.Pollard, p. 117. Test debut The following season, when the team for the 1957‚Äì58 South African tour was announced, Lindwall's name was omitted, despite his 212 Test wickets, second only to Clarrie Grimmett among Australian bowlers.Perry, p. 204. Meckiff was selected for the tour as part of Australia's generational change, after a single season in first-class cricket, and the squad departed for South Africa in October. On the tour, in five first-class matches ahead of the Tests he took 12 wickets, at 26.25. Meckiff was one of four Australians to make their debuts in the First Test, which was played on a batsman-friendly surface in Johannesburg over the Christmas holiday period.Haigh, p. 112.Pollard, p. 121. Under some pressure due to Australia's decision to discard Lindwall and invest in new talent, he opened the bowling alongside Alan Davidson, who up to that point had taken only 16 wickets at 34.06 in 12 Tests.Cashman, pp. 72‚Äì73. The match began badly for Australia's inexperienced attack as the South African openers Jackie McGlew and Trevor Goddard put on an opening stand of 176. Meckiff claimed his maiden Test wicket, and Australia's first breakthrough, when he bowled Goddard for 90. He then removed McGlew for 108 and later dismissed Russell Endean and Roy McLean for 50 apiece. South Africa amassed 470, and Meckiff had the best figures, taking 5/125 in the hosts' first innings, all five being specialist batsmen. When the tourists batted, Meckiff came in at 8/313 and held up his end as centurion Richie Benaud did the majority of the scoring in their 42-run partnership. The debutant ended with 11 in his first Test outing with the bat as Craig's team ended on 368. Meckiff took 3/52 in the South African second innings, including McGlew for the second time, as the match ended in a draw. This fine start to the Victorian's international career was halted in the Second Test at Cape Town, where he broke down with injury early in the first innings and took no further part in an Australian innings victory. He did not take a wicket. Meckiff missed the Third Test in Durban and spent a month on the sidelines, before returning against a combined team from Orange Free State and Border at the end of January. He took 6/29 in the first innings, his best return of the tour, and earned a recall for the final two Tests of the five-match series. He was not as effective as he was on debut, taking two and one wickets for the matches respectively, and scoring 26 runs in his only innings of the Fourth Test. Overall, the Victorian paceman had made a steady start to his international career, with 11 Test wickets at an average of 32.09, and 56 runs at 18.66. In the entire tour, he took 33 first-class wickets at 23.09. However, there was a hint of the controversy that was to end his career six years later. A year after the series, the South African Test umpire Bill Marais said he was prepared to no-ball Meckiff and his teammate Jim Burke for throwing.Haigh and Frith, p. 119. There were reports that Craig had been tipped off about Marais's intentions and therefore operated the two bowlers exclusively from the end at which Marais was not officiating. Career peak and start of throwing controversy The Victorian paceman's international career peaked in 1958‚Äì59 during the English tour of Australia. He started the season with a match for Victoria against the tourists, taking 4/69 and 1/16 in a losing effort. His wickets included English Test batsmen Peter Richardson (twice), Arthur Milton and Raman Subba Row. The Test team was now under the leadership of Benaud‚ÄîCraig had been forced to withdraw from cricket due to hepatitis; Meckiff retained his place in the side.Perry, p. 210. Prior to the Tests, English all-rounder Trevor Bailey privately described Meckiff as \\"the worst bowler ever to represent Australia\\", and felt he posed little threat to the visitors.Haigh, p. 124. However this proved to be questionable. The Benaud era started well for Australia and Meckiff, with a comfortable eight-wicket victory in the First Test in Brisbane. The paceman took 3/33 and 2/30, removing Milton, Colin Cowdrey and captain Peter May early on the first day to help Australia take the initiative after the tourists had batted first. The match also marked the start of behind-the-scenes rumblings about the bowler's action.Pollard, pp. 128‚Äì129. Meckiff's career peaked at the Second Test, which began on New Year's Eve, 1958 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It was his first international fixture in front of his home crowd, and also marked the start of his career-long public problem with accusations of throwing. The match was dominated by the Victorian and his left-arm pace partner Davidson; the pair took 18 of the 20 English wickets to fall. England's first innings was headlined by Davidson's 6/64; Meckiff took 3/69, including the wicket of England captain May for 113 with a swinging ball, which breached the batsman's defence and crashed into the stumps.Piesse, p. 189. This ended a century partnership with Cowdrey, and triggered a collapse that saw England be dismissed for 259, the last six English wickets falling for 49 runs. Meckiff rated the ball as the best of his career. He made a duck as the hosts replied with 308 to take a 49-run lead. It was in England's second innings that Australia's left-arm pacemen were at their most potent; apart from one over from Benaud the pair bowled unchanged to dismiss England for 87 in the 32nd over, Meckiff taking 6/38.Whimpress, p. 69. Backed a by a vocal home crowd, the Victorian dismissed opener Richardson for three, before removing Bailey, Tom Graveney and Cowdrey in quick succession. He followed this by removing the English skipper for a second time to leave England at 7/71. This set up a comfortable Australian victory as they reached their target of 39 with the loss of two wickets. The Australian pace duo were aided by a series of difficult, diving catches.Pollard, p. 129. The pair combined forces when Davidson caught May, and then Graveney, in the leg trap behind square from the bowling of his fellow left-armer, who called the reflex catches \\"absolutely unbelievable\\". Meckiff described the hometown atmosphere as \\"electrifying\\", and attributed his performance to the crowd support. The match ended on the eve of Meckiff's 24th birthday, but Australian celebrations were marred by English journalists, who levelled accusations of throwing against him and some of his colleagues. The evening edition of the Melbourne Herald carried a column by former English spinner Johnny Wardle, accusing Meckiff of \\"throwing England out\\".Whimpress, p. 70. Wardle's piece was written confrontationally, as a series of sentences starting with \\"I accuse\\". This was followed by more anti-Meckiff comments in the English press, including one that dubbed the bowler \\"the greatest ogre of international cricket since Larwood\\". The Evening News proclaimed: \\"Meckiff's throwing was devastating\\" and The Star said: \\"at least two of his wickets were obtained by deliveries which looked to be thrown\\". Former England spinner Ian Peebles asserted that Meckiff and Gordon Rorke threw \\"the greater number of balls they deliver\\",Haigh and Frith, p. 120. while former English paceman Alf Gover claimed that none of the left- armer's deliveries were legal; it was \\"ridiculous that a player of his action should be the agent of England's destruction\\".Pollard, p. 181. According to Australian writer Jack Pollard, such headlines relegated the Cold War, which usually occupied the front pages, to the interior of the English newspapers. By contrast to the strident condemnation of Meckiff in the English press, Australian opinion was mixed. The former Test opener and leading commentator Jack Fingleton said: \\"when he [Meckiff] delivered to Bailey, his fastest ball looked most suspect\\" and that the left-armer should have been called for throwing. Fingleton claimed to know of five former Australian Test cricketers who felt that Meckiff threw, but only named the 1930s paceman Ernie McCormick. Former Australian player Tommy Andrews claimed: \\"if they stop throwing in Australia, cricket will die\\". Former Australian captain Ian Johnson argued that if Meckiff were to be cited for an illegal action for jerking his wrist, then leading English bowlers such as Trueman, Brian Statham and Tony Lock, who played against Australia during the season, should also be sanctioned.Pollard, p. 134.Whimpress, p. 72. As with Meckiff, Lock was under scrutiny at the time and later tried to change his bowling action but the new style coincided with a downturn in results. Johnson also noted that any successful spinner would be called for throwing if the law were enforced strictly because of their flicking of the wrist and fingers during the delivery of the ball, as they could not otherwise extract spin.Whimpress, p. 73. In 1993, Robert Coleman, the historian of the Victorian Cricket Association, decried the anti-Meckiff campaign as \\"Fleet Street bleating\\",Coleman, p. 588. and said: \\"there have been no more hysterical outbursts on the subject [of throwing] than occurred during England's 1958‚Äì59 tour\\".Piesse, p. 190. Writing decades after the event, Pollard said \\"Meckiff, in fact, went to the crease with a beautifully relaxed approach, paused momentarily with his arm absolutely straight, and then let the ball go with a blurred swing of the arm that was impossible to follow from 60 yards away, even with the aid of good binoculars.\\" Journalists who wrote books about the 1958‚Äì59 season made thinly veiled references to the controversy in the names of their work. Fingleton's account on the series was entitled Four Chukkas to Australia, while E. N. Wellings labelled his tome The Ashes Thrown Away, and accused Meckiff, along with Burke, Rorke and Keith Slater of throwing for Australia in the Tests.Haigh and Frith, p. 118. An Australian television debate program featured an entire session where English journalists Wellings and Crawford White discussed the throwing issue with former Australian Test cricketers Keith Miller and Sid Barnes. In the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground Meckiff took one wicket‚ÄîBailey‚Äîin the first innings, before breaking down with an injury in the second. This ruled him out of the Fourth Test,Perry, p. 243. and he missed a month of cricket before returning for the final Test in Melbourne in mid February, where he removed specialist batsmen May and Ted Dexter. On the field it had been a successful series for the Victorian; he had taken 17 wickets at 17.17, as Australia claimed the series 4‚Äì0. These efforts placed him top of the Test bowling averages for the series. When Lindwall was recalled for the Fourth Test in place of the injured Meckiff he was reported to have said \\"I'm the last of the straight-arm bowlers\\". The veteran paceman played alongside Meckiff in later matches, including the Fifth Test. Meckiff was also prominent in the two Shield matches against New South Wales, when both teams were at full strength. In the first contest he had match figures of 5/129, his victims including Test teammates Burke, O'Neill and Davidson (twice), but his efforts were unable to prevent defeat. In the return fixture, Meckiff took a total of 7/162; five of his victims were Australian Test batsmen. Victoria held the upper hand, and were 45 runs short of victory in the second innings when time ran out. Within the wider cricket community there was a steady crescendo of comment condemning the prevalence of bowlers with suspect actions. Prior to the alteration of the bowling law by the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1960, the law stated:Whimpress, p. 71. =Reaction by players and officials= In contrast to the heated debate in the media, players and administrators refrained from publicly questioning or condemning Meckiff. Neither the England captain May nor manager Freddie Brown raised any concerns about Meckiff's action after the Test. However, it was later revealed that Brown had wanted to lodge an official complaint with the Australian Board of Control, but May had refused, fearing accusations of sour grapes. Years later, Richardson and some of his fellow batsmen accused the Australian fast bowler of throwing them out, while England paceman Fred Trueman said: \\"Meckiff's action was totally illegal and that he should never have been allowed to play\\". Richardson's off spinning teammate Jim Laker likened Meckiff's and Burke's arm actions to those of dart- throwers. Benaud said he was \\"completely satisfied that [Meckiff's] delivery was fair and legitimate\\",Pollard, p. 182. while the selection panel of Don Bradman, Dudley Seddon and Jack Ryder continued to pick the paceman, implying that they regarded his action as legal.Whimpress, p. 74. Bill Dowling, the chairman of the Australian Board of Control, denounced the media attention on suspect bowling actions as excessive and \\"magnified out of all proportion\\".Haigh, p. 125. Off the field, the throwing controversy was beginning to affect Meckiff adversely. In his 1961 autobiography, prophetically titled Thrown Out,Coleman, p. 591. he said the accusations took a deep personal toll on him and his family, and prompted him to shun the public. He became known by the derisive nickname \\"Chucker\\" and was credited on the front cover of his autobiography as \\"Ian 'Chucker' Meckiff\\". Meckiff reported that from the Melbourne Test onwards, his son was verbally abused by classmates; Meckiff's parents were persistently told their son bowled illegally. He added that doctors believed his anxiety was contributing to stomach ailments. At the time, players were not allowed to talk to the media during the season, and Meckiff was upset because he could not rebut his accusers while they were free to attack him. He denied ever throwing, but admitted he may have been open to suspicion after bowling 15 to 20 overs in a day's play, as his body would begin to fall away in the delivery stride due to fatigue. He had a permanently bent bowling arm; he generated his pace from his wrist action, and asserted that his thin wrists gave the impression that his whole arm was bending. Subcontinent tour In 1959‚Äì60, the season started with a Test trial between the XIs of Lindwall and Benaud. Meckiff claimed a match total of 4/90 for Lindwall's men and was selected for the Test tour of Pakistan and India. Before the team departed, Meckiff demonstrated his new bowling action, which used a rigid left arm during the run-up,Haigh, p. 181. before swinging the arm over during the delivery stride.Whimpress, p. 80. Over the next two years, sceptics and sporting opponents mostly regarded his action as fair, and said so in public. He was not called for throwing in either India or Pakistan, meaning that he had played in five nations without being sanctioned. Meckiff was wicketless in Australia's win in the First Test against Pakistan on a matting wicket in Dacca (now in Bangladesh). In the first innings of the Second Test in Lahore, he took three wickets, including that of opposition captain Hanif Mohammad; the match was Australia's last Test win on Pakistani soil for 39 years. Before the Third Test, he helped the tourists beat the President's XI in a low-scoring game in which none of the four innings totalled over 140. Meckiff claimed four wickets in the match, and was batting (he scored two not out) when Australia reached their victory target with three wickets in hand. He missed the drawn Third Test in Karachi. In the next leg of the tour, Meckiff returned to the Australian side for the First Test against India in Delhi. After claiming 1/52 in the first innings, he compiled his Test best score of 45 not out. He came in to bat with his team's score at 8/402 and helped Lindsay Kline and Rorke push Australia's score to 468, a first innings lead of 333. Meckiff was unable to capture a wicket in the Indian second innings as Benaud's men won by an innings and 117 runs. He bowled with little success in the Second Test in Kanpur, taking 1/52 in a spin-dominated match in which Jasu Patel claimed 14 wickets to bowl India to their first-ever Test win over Australia. Meckiff was unbeaten on 14 when India secured the final wicket. In his first two Tests on Indian soil, Meckiff's only victim had been Chandu Borde, whom he dismissed twice. Meckiff's most successful Test during the Indian tour was the drawn third match at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, where he captured 4/79 and 3/67. In the Indian first innings, after removing opener Nari Contractor for 108, Meckiff captured four of the next five wickets as India collapsed from 3/199 to 8/246‚Äîthey were eventually all out for 289. In the second innings he secured three quick wickets as the hosts slumped from 0/99 to 4/116 before a recovery which prevented their defeat. Meckiff continued to hold the upper hand over Borde, dismissing him in both innings. The Victorian bowler had little success in the final two Tests, taking only three wickets as Australia won the series 2‚Äì1. He ended the subcontinental tour with 15 wickets at 35.73, and scored 70 runs at 23.33. He had particular success against Borde, dismissing him five times in as many Tests. Meckiff returned to Australia in time to play his solitary Sheffield Shield match for the 1959‚Äì60 season, taking the only ten- wicket match haul of his career. He took 5/41 and 5/84 to set up an easy win over Western Australia. His first innings effort helped dismiss Western Australia for 141, and Victoria replied with 431 to move into a match-winning position. He also helped South Melbourne to another district title, taking 9/51‚Äîincluding a hat-trick‚Äîin the last match of the regular season against Fitzroy. This victory allowed South Melbourne to climb from seventh to fourth in the table and become the last qualifier for the semi-finals. They subsequently won their semi-final and the grand final to secure the title.Coleman, p. 497. Alterations to the throwing law In 1960, at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference in London, cricket's \\"throwing law\\" was changed to forbid the straightening of the arm at the instant of the ball's delivery. The Australian Board of Control were so concerned about the controversy and its possible impact on the Australian game that they sent Board chairman Dowling and Board member Sir Donald Bradman to the meeting, rather than the customary Britain-based representative.Coleman, p. 590. Despite the agreed change in the law, because of conflicting interpretations in different countries a compromise was agreed, which specified an amnesty during the forthcoming 1961 Australian tour to England. It was agreed that on the tour, umpires would privately report any concerns about bowling actions to the teams concerned, for them to remedy. After the tour, umpires would \\"call\\" bowlers whenever they felt the new law to have been breached.Whimpress, pp. 73‚Äì75. On his return to Australia, Dowling angrily accused the English cricket community of pre-judging Meckiff. Dowling said the strident press attacks on Meckiff had amounted to intimidation of umpires through the media,Pollard, p. 143. and claimed that some administrators had privately told him that the Australian paceman would be called if he toured England. The president of the Marylebone Cricket Club, Sir Hubert Ashton, said he hoped Australia would not choose Meckiff for their 1961 tour. Tied Test against the West Indies, 1960‚Äì61 The Victorian was not called during the 1960‚Äì61 Australian season, but his performances were ineffective and he was repeatedly hampered by injuries. In particular, a strained achilles tendon restricted his speed and penetration, particularly in the lead-up to the opening Test.Haigh, p. 140. Meckiff played in the First and the Third Tests, taking two wickets at 117.00 and scoring 12 runs at 6.00; he was unable to complete either match, sustaining injuries during the second innings of both fixtures.Whimpress, p. 79. These fitness problems resulted in his omission for the three other Tests. During the summer, Meckiff's bowling was passed by Col Egar, who later ended his career. He noted that the umpire had told him there was little point in changing his action. Meckiff took match figures of 4/90 as Victoria started the season with a nine-wicket win over South Australia, but he managed only 2/122 as his state lost by an innings to the touring West Indies in the next fixture. The paceman removed Rohan Kanhai, who made 252 of the visitors' 493, and captain Frank Worrell, who contributed 82. During the heavy defeat, Meckiff equal top-scored with 24 not out in the first innings, as the hosts struggled against the mysterious spin of Sonny Ramadhin.Pollard, p. 145. Despite his unpenetrative performance with the ball, the paceman was retained for the First Test in Brisbane. The Caribbean team batted first and attacked Meckiff, taking more than seven runs per over from his bowling. The paceman ended with 1/129 from 18 overs as the visitors amassed 453;Pollard, p. 148. his only wicket was that of Gary Sobers for 132. The West Indian batsman had been particularly severe on Meckiff and was ironically dismissed by \\"the day's worst ball\\"‚ÄîHaigh, p. 142. a leg side full toss that he hit to mid-on. In the second innings, Meckiff broke down after only four overs, but came out to bat on 14 December, late in Australia's climactic run-chase, for which he was often remembered. At the end of a dramatic final day, Australia needed seven runs from the final over for victory, and they had three wickets in hand. The home side had seemed destined for a win after Davidson and Benaud had fought back with a century stand for the seventh wicket in the final session. Both were well set and had passed 50, but the tourists halted Australia's momentum by running out Davidson with a direct hit from the last ball of the previous over.Fiddian, p. 90. Benaud was caught behind on the second ball of the final over attempting a hook and Meckiff came to the crease to join Wally Grout. Five runs were needed from six balls with two wickets in hand. The injured paceman blocked the first ball he faced‚Äîthe third of the over‚Äîand ran a bye after missing the next. The West Indian wicket-keeper tried to run Meckiff out, but missed the stumps at the non-striker's end with the batsman many metres out of his ground.Haigh, p. 146. Grout top-edged the following ball straight up into the air, but the two fielders who converged beneath it collided and dropped the catch, allowing the Australians to take another run. The hosts thus needed three runs from the last three balls. Meckiff faced the sixth ball; it was a half volley and he lofted it over square leg. The ball looked as though it would reach the boundary for a match-winning four runs; however, after landing close to the fence, it stopped rolling a metre short on the slow outfield.Haigh, p. 147. Grout attempted a third run, which would have won the match, but an accurate long throw saw him run out. The last man Lindsay Kline came in for the final two balls, with scores level, and the Australian pair agreed to run under all circumstances. Meckiff backed up significantly in anticipation of a quick single, and set off for the winning run after his partner hit the ball to square leg. However, he was run out by roughly a metre when Joe Solomon directly hit the stumps from side on, causing the first tie in Test history.Coleman, p. 594. Umpire Col Hoy said of his decision to give Meckiff out: \\"God, it was easy. He was miles out.\\" The entire stadium‚Äîplayers and spectators alike‚Äîinvaded the ground in excitement, but nobody was sure of the exact scores. It was only later that they realised the match was the first Tied Test; Meckiff initially thought Australia had lost and blamed himself for the result.Pollard, p. 149.Haigh, p. 149. After missing the Australian victory in the Second Test due to injury, Meckiff returned for the Third Test and he was again attacked, taking 1/74 from 13 overs in the first innings, his sole victim being Conrad Hunte. He then broke down after five overs in the second innings. Davidson also left the field with injury and the tourists took advantage; they attacked the remaining bowlers, levelling the series 1‚Äì1.Pollard, p. 152. The Victorian did not recover in time for the rest of the Tests. Persistently hampered by ankle and back injuries, Meckiff aggregated only 19 first-class wickets at 40 for the summer. His best innings performance was 4/39 against Queensland and he was unable to claim more than five wickets in any single match. In one match against arch-rivals New South Wales, the Victorian took a total of 5/155, all of his wickets being Test batsmen. Meckiff was not selected for the Ashes tour. His lack of form saved the Australian selectors the difficult choice of whether to omit him because of his action and avoid a potential run-in with umpires in England. Critics claimed that his new bowling action adopted in 1959‚Äì60 had made him legitimate but reduced his pace and effectiveness. No-balled in the Sheffield Shield, 1962‚Äì63 The throwing controversy subsided during the 1961 English season, and the 1961‚Äì62 Australian season was purely domestic, with no touring international teams. As a result, there were no pressing diplomacy imperatives involving throwing. Meckiff was Victoria's leading bowler with 28 wickets at 27.14 in eight matches and was not called. His best performance was 5/53 in the first innings of the match against Queensland at the MCG, which ended in defeat for the home team. Despite healthy results for the season overall, the paceman struggled and took match figures of 2/136 and 3/112 as Victoria lost both their matches against the dominant New South Wales XI, who won their ninth successive Shield. At the end of the season, Meckiff was part of an International XI that toured New Zealand and played against the hosts' national team and against teams from India and Pakistan. He had little success, taking four wickets at 53.00 in three matches. In 1962‚Äì63, Meckiff was again under the spotlight when Ted Dexter's Englishmen toured Australia. He topped the bowling averages for the Australian first-class season with 58 wickets at 19.86 from ten matches, as Victoria won the Sheffield Shield, ending New South Wales' run of titles. Meckiff and Alan Connolly formed an effective pace pairing, helping Victoria to win four of its eight Shield games, and take first innings points in two others.Coleman, p. 599.Pollard, p. 179. Meckiff was hoping to regain his Test place, and started his 1962‚Äì63 campaign in a Sheffield Shield match against South Australia. After Victoria made 174, the paceman took 4/65 to dismiss South Australia for 141 in the first innings. In the second innings he took 3/76 to help seal a win. He continued his early season form in taking match figures of 7/179 against Western Australia, but was unable to prevent defeat. Despite these performances, Meckiff was overlooked for the First Test. He had another chance to vie for national selection when Victoria played England after the opening Test, and took match figures of 4/90 as the tourists completed a five-wicket victory. He dismissed Ray Illingworth, Geoff Pullar and Alan Smith as Victoria took a four-run first innings lead, but the hosts collapsed in their second innings and Dexter's men reached their target of 180 with five wickets in hand. Victoria then played the first of their two matches for the season against their arch-rivals New South Wales, just before the Second Test. Meckiff took 3/33, removing Grahame Thomas, Benaud and Martin as Victoria dismissed the reigning champions for 132. He contributed 32 runs at the end of the Victorian first innings reply, helping to extend his team's first-innings lead to 135 runs. In the New South Wales second innings Meckiff took 3/73, removing Test players Simpson, Davidson and Benaud, to leave his team with a target of 95 runs to win, which they reached with eight wickets in hand. Despite this effort, he was not selected for the Second Test. His season was then marred when he was called for throwing for the first time in any competition. In January 1963, Victoria played South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. After Victoria had made 218, Meckiff removed both openers‚ÄîLes Favell and Ken Cunningham‚Äîfor the cost of 19 runs before Jack Kierse no-balled the fourth ball of his fourth over. He continued to bowl; his remaining deliveries were deemed legal by the umpires, and he ended with 5/84 in South Australia's reply of 8/408 declared. The hosts had a target of only 108 in the second innings for victory, but Meckiff removed Favell, Cunningham and Neil Dansie with the new ball to destabilise the run-chase. He ended with 3/25 as the South Australians stumbled to 7/86 and held on for a draw.Whimpress, p. 81. Meckiff took a total of 3/50 in a seven-wicket defeat of Western Australia before the return match against New South Wales, in which Victoria were 34 runs short of victory with seven wickets in hand when time ran out, Meckiff's match figures being 6/121. He had a final chance to push for Test selection in the second of his state's two matches against England. The tourists batted first and made 375; Meckiff took 5/93, dismissing Pullar, Peter Parfitt, Fred Titmus, David Allen and top-scorer Tom Graveney, who had made 185. He took 2/47 in the English second innings, removing Barry Knight and Ken Barrington. England set Victoria 287 for victory, and the hosts faced defeat before Meckiff batted late in the order to score 38 and help his side to a draw with one wicket in hand. Despite this continued run of prolific wicket-taking and his success against England, Meckiff was overlooked for the Fifth Test. In his absence, Australia struggled to make inroads into the English batting, and the series ended 1‚Äì1. Victoria's season ended with consecutive matches against Queensland. In the first, Meckiff took a total of 5/88 as his side completed an innings victory at home. In the final match in Brisbane, his slower ball was no-balled in his fifth over of the second innings by umpire Bill Priem. Meckiff bowled 14 further overs without incident and ended the innings with 4/74.Whimpress, p. 82. Victoria drew the match and sealed their Sheffield Shield victory. Meckiff had been the state's leading wicket-taker and one of the key figures in their triumph, but his bowling action was the main talking point at the end of the match. Test no-ball Meckiff's performances as the leading wicket-taker during the 1962‚Äì63 season meant that he could not be justifiably denied national selection on grounds of productivity, so the matter of his legitimacy had to be resolved. Meanwhile, the retirement of pace spearhead Davidson left a vacancy in the Australian team ahead of the 1963‚Äì64 home Test series against South Africa. In the opening Shield matches of the season in Melbourne, Meckiff took match figures of 5/102 and 6/107 against South and Western Australia respectively. His wickets included Test batsmen Les Favell, Garry Sobers, Keith Slater and Barry Shepherd. In the latter match he took the first five wickets in the innings to reduce Western Australia to 5/54. Despite his contributions, Victoria were unable to secure victories against either of their opponents. However, as a result of these strong personal performances, Meckiff was selected for the First Test in Brisbane.Whimpress, p. 83. At the start of the season, the Australian Board of Control had issued a directive calling on the umpires to \\"get tough\\" in enforcing the laws of cricket, and asked the state associations to \\"back the umpires to the fullest extent\\". In the lead-up to the Test, Meckiff was the centre of media attention, and one report described him as cricket's \\"bogey man\\". The South Africans were reportedly stunned by Meckiff's selection, giving the impression that they considered him an illegitimate bowler.Gibbs, p. 20. Reaction in England was also hostile, ahead of Australia's forthcoming tour in the English summer of 1964. Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie wrote in the News of the World: \\"there is no room in cricket for throwers. Let us hope that...the Australian selectors realise this...otherwise the throwing war will be waged in earnest\\".Haigh, p. 183. The Brisbane Test was dubbed \\"Meckiff's Test\\" by the Australian media; speculation abounded that the bowler was being chosen so he could be no-balled as a public relations effort to promote Australia's anti-throwing credentials. Keith Miller described the left-armer's selection as having \\"peppered this once drab-looking series into a curry hot- pot, with all the excitement and trimmings of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller\\". Miller further predicted that the umpires Egar and Lou Rowan would be having sleepless nights and predicted that the selectors would be biting their fingernails, adding that he hoped Meckiff was not being used as a scapegoat for the anti-throwing movement. Former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly‚Äîa correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald‚Äîdescribed the selection as \\"one of the most fantastic somersaults in cricket policies in our time\\".Hopps, pp. 214‚Äì216. As a close friend of the fast bowler, umpire Egar was in a difficult situation; the duo had won a pairs lawn bowling competition just a few months earlier. Nevertheless, the paceman and umpire socialised freely at the pre- match function. =Incident= In the Test match, which began on 6 December 1963, Australia batted first; Meckiff contributed seven runs before being bowled by Peter Pollock. On the second day, after the Australian innings ended on 435, South Africa began to bat just after the luncheon interval. Bowling from the Stanley Street End, Graham McKenzie conceded 13 runs from the first over. Meckiff took the ball for the second over, bowling from the Vulture Street End to South African captain Trevor Goddard.Haigh and Frith, p. 133. At the same time, the South African manager Ken Viljoen set up a camera square of the wicket among the spectators and began filming the left-armer's bowling action. Meckiff was no-balled four times by Egar‚Äîwho was standing at square leg‚Äîin what would be his only over of the match. After the Victorian bowled a gentle \\"loosener\\" as his first ball (and escaped a front-foot no-ball call), \\"the drama began\\".Haigh, p. 184. Egar ruled the second, third, fifth and ninth balls to be throws, and therefore illegitimate. After the third and fifth balls‚Äîthe latter a full toss that Goddard hit for four‚ÄîBenaud came over to consult his fast bowler. After the ninth ball, Meckiff and Benaud had another meeting, and the remaining three balls were deemed to be fair. In the meantime, the crowd roared loudly, heckling Egar and supporting the beleaguered bowler.Haigh, p. 185. Meckiff had previously been passed in five countries, having played Tests in four of these nations. Egar had cleared his bowling on five previous occasions, in three Shield matches and two Tests; the Victorian had bowled 119.1 overs in these games without incident. Egar later said \\"My only judgement was what I saw at the time\\".Whimpress, p. 84. Benaud removed his paceman from the attack and Meckiff did not bowl again in the match, later saying he could not remember the over because he was absorbed by a feeling of complete deflation. Meckiff conceded eight runs‚ÄîGoddard's boundary and the four no-balls‚Äîfrom his solitary over and the tourists were eventually out for 346. Meckiff did not bat in the second innings of the weather-interrupted match; Australia declared at 1/144 before South Africa reached 1/13 when the match ended as a draw. After his single over, Meckiff's participation in the match was limited to his fielding, during which he caught Goddard from the bowling of Benaud in the South African first innings.Coleman, p. 592. He retired from all forms of cricket at the end of the game, but continued to proclaim that his bowling action was fair.Haigh and Frith, p. 113. Barry Gibbs, the secretary of the Queensland Cricket Association and the manager of the Australian team, called the \\"humiliation\\" of Meckiff \\"without a doubt the most dramatic and emotion-charged\\" sporting moment he had witnessed.Gibbs, p. 19. Egar's actions also ignited \\"one of the most emotional crowd displays in Test history\\", as the public backed the paceman. During Meckiff's over, the crowd expressed strong disapproval of the umpire's calls.Gibbs, p. 21. Half an hour before the close of the day's play, proceedings were suspended for two minutes as the crowd repeatedly chanted \\"We want Meckiff\\". When play ended, spectators stormed the field and carried the fast bowler off the arena on their shoulders, hailing him as a hero. They returned to the field and formed two lanes, booing Egar from the ground.Whimpress, p. 87. After this incident, the Queensland Police escorted the umpire to and from the match venue. The police presence at the ground was increased because of fears the crowd might attack Egar or Benaud. During the Second Test, which was held in Meckiff's home town of Melbourne, Egar was given a police escort throughout the match after receiving death threats.Piesse, p. 204. =Reaction= During a rest day after the second day's play the media dissected the events of the previous afternoon. The majority of reporters believed all of Meckiff's deliveries had been bowled with an identical action. Louis Duffus of the Johannesburg Star expressed \\"sympathy for Meckiff as well as admiration for Egar.\\"Whimpress, p. 85. The South African writer Charles Fortune said that Meckiff's action was \\"not according to the laws of cricket\\" although he would not call the Australian bowler a \\"chucker\\". England captain Dexter implicitly accused Meckiff of throwing, saying: \\"One courageous Australian umpire has brought it to a timely end\\". Team manager Gibbs reported that at the end of the first day's play the Australian dressing room was stunned into silence. Egar asked Benaud for permission to enter, and after the Australian captain allowed him in, the umpire sat quietly for a period before speaking to some other players and then to Meckiff. The pair were close friends, and shook hands before putting their arms around one another's shoulders. The condemned bowler did not take Egar's judgment personally and did not have hard feelings about the incident.Haigh, p. 186.Gibbs, pp. 20‚Äì21. Egar claimed to be \\"the second most upset person in the world\\",Tibballs, pp. 134‚Äì137. and later added that he thought Meckiff's first ball was suspect. He said that he could have called more deliveries, but was worried whether the over would ever end. When asked why he had not asked Meckiff to bowl at the other end to gauge the judgment of the other umpire, Lou Rowan, Benaud replied \\"over the years I have always accepted the umpire's decision\\".Whimpress, p. 88. The Australian captain was criticised for being acquiescent, and one of his predecessors Lindsay Hassett believed Meckiff should have been used at reduced speed. Rowan later indicated his concurrence with Egar, writing in his book The Umpire's Story, \\"There is nothing I can now say that will alter the opinions already expressed that his [Meckiff's] delivery was unfair\\".Gibbs, p. 23. For his part, Meckiff said: \\"the game is bigger than the individual\\" and he backed Benaud's decision because doing otherwise \\"could only have added fuel to the controversy\\". Retired Test umpires Col Hoy and Les Townsend were watching at the ground when Meckiff was called. The day after the incident, both asserted that they would not have no- balled the paceman. Hoy said he had never had any problem with the bowler's action during matches in which he officiated. He described Meckiff's action as \\"slightly different\\" but attributed this to an accentuated wrist action used in an attempt to get more life out of dead pitches, rather than his elbow. Townsend watched the paceman through binoculars and deemed all of his 12 deliveries to be identical. Townsend regarded Meckiff's arm action as \\"peculiar\\" but felt he did not throw.Whimpress, p. 89. Former Test spinners Ian Johnson and Doug Ring said Meckiff's action was fair. After his retirement, Meckiff agreed to put his name to a series of ghost-written articles about the no-ball incident.Haigh, p. 187. He said that Egar's calls \\"hit him like a dagger in the back\\", but described the umpire as \\"a fair and just man who acted according to his convictions\\". =Allegations of a conspiracy= Sections of the cricket community believed Meckiff was no-balled to prove that Australia was serious about dealing with the wave of complaints regarding suspected throwing in the 1950s and 1960s. Leading cricket historian David Frith wrote: \\"Meckiff was a popular Australian, and won much sympathy among those who believed him innocent or to have been victimised in a 'clean- up campaign'.\\" A dinner hosted by Don Bradman at his Adelaide home in January 1963 for visiting state captains was later cited to suggest that Meckiff may have been a sacrificial offering. At the dinner, attended by Bill Lawry of Victoria, Barry Shepherd, Ken Mackay and Benaud,Whimpress, p. 90.Haigh, p. 182. Bradman had showed frame-by-frame slow motion film of Meckiff and other suspect Australian bowlers, which purportedly depicted incriminating actions. This indicated Bradman's doubts over Meckiff's legitimacy, yet Bradman was one of the selectors who agreed to the bowler's inclusion in the Brisbane Test team.Whimpress, p. 91. Many members of the Australian media alleged a conspiracy against Meckiff. Ian McDonald of Melbourne's Sporting Globe said the bowler's action had not changed in the previous eight years and stated: \\"the whole affair smacks of a set-up\\". Sydney's Mirror labelled the paceman \\"the most obvious fall-guy in Australian cricket history\\". On the third morning of the match, former first-class cricketer Percy Beames, writing for Melbourne's The Age, claimed Meckiff had been used as a \\"sacrificial goat\\" and called for the selectors' resignation.Whimpress, p. 86. Keith Miller wrote a column calling for Bradman's and Jack Ryder's removal from the selection panel, noting that they had watched Meckiff's performance against Western Australia which prompted his Test selection. Miller felt that if the selectors deemed the bowler illegitimate, then they should not have allowed him to be \\"executed\\" by the umpires. Jack Pollard said: \\"there is little doubt Meckiff was sacrificed to end the long-running controversy and the way it was done irked many cricket-lovers.\\" Cricketer-turned-journalist Dick Whitington asserted that Benaud was aware his fast bowler had been set up, claiming that the Australian captain knew of Bradman's views on Meckiff's action. Whitington further cited the fact that Egar and Bradman had travelled from Adelaide to the Brisbane Test together as evidence of a plot. Others saw Bradman's tea- time conversation with Benaud after the no-balling as proof of a conspiracy.Haigh, p. 188. Benaud repudiated allegations claiming he was involved in a set-up. Former Australian captain Hassett hinted at a conspiracy when he stated that, as the selectors must have considered Meckiff to be legitimate, then > If the selectors are right, Egar is wrong, and if he is incapable of > interpreting the laws correctly, he should not stand in first-class cricket. > On the other hand if the selectors as a body threw Meckiff into this arena > merely to be tested by the opinion of a single umpire, they are very much > guilty of passing the buck, and of exposing both the bowler and the umpire > to extreme embarrassment. The records of the Australian Board of Control attest to board member Clem Jones's protestations against Meckiff's inclusion when the selectors' proposed team list was submitted for approval. Jones cited the bowler's questionable action but the Chairman Ewart Macmillan rejected his objection as unconstitutional. Two other board members attempted to overrule the chairman, but their motion was defeated. More than 40 years after the Meckiff incident, Jones was sure the bowler's fate had been predetermined. He said \\"They'd decided to do it a week before the game, so the poor bloke had no hope...I was chairman of the umpires selection committee.\\" Jones remained convinced of Bradman's intention to have Meckiff called for throwing, something Bradman flatly denied.Haigh and Frith, p. 124. Gibbs remains suspicious of the motives for selecting Meckiff. He pointed out that although the pitch was conducive to spin bowling, Australia chose five specialist batsmen, two spinners and three fast bowlers. Gibbs speculated that the selection of an extra fast bowler‚Äîthe most common strategy is to use four bowlers and six batsmen‚Äîinstead of another batsman betrayed fears that Meckiff would be unable to complete the match.Gibbs, pp. 22‚Äì24. Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy, saying \\"I wasn't amazed [by Egar's call]...There was a good reason for that which I can't disclose and won't disclose.\\" Tom Veivers, who made his Test debut for Australia in Meckiff's last match, hinted at the same. He recalled Rowan's words at the pre-match function: \\"It's going to be a very interesting game\\". Outside cricket After finishing high school, Meckiff worked as a hardware salesman and lived in Mentone until he married and moved to Beaumaris.Coleman, p. 589.Haigh, p. 180. The couple had a son. After his retirement, the former paceman worked in advertising, and as a cricket commentator. As of 2001, he was a senior executive with Boyer Sports Media and frequently worked with cricket administrators. However, he refused to play the sport‚Äîeven at social level‚Äîafter the incident in Brisbane. Meckiff played Australian rules football for Mentone in the Federal League, helping them win the premiership in 1956. He received offers to play in the Victorian Football League, the top-tier competition at the time, but declined contracts so he could pursue his cricket career. Meckiff also played golf in pennant competition and captained the Victoria Golf Club.Gibbs, p. 25. In retirement, the throwing issue continued to dog the former paceman. Former Australian captain and teammate Simpson wrote a book titled Captain's Story in which he assailed various cricketers‚ÄîMeckiff chief among them‚Äîfor throwing. Meckiff sued for libel in a five-year case, which ended with an out-of-court settlement and apology from Simpson.Perry, p. 241. Despite this, Meckiff has continued to socialise with people involved in his last Test, including Simpson, Egar, Gibbs, Rowan and Peter van der Merwe, South Africa's vice-captain. He says that he never brings up the topic of the no-ball with them. Victorian and Test teammate Lawry rated Meckiff \\"along with Graham McKenzie, Brian Booth, Peter Burge and one or two others as really nature's gentlemen\\" and said his exit was \\"one of the saddest [days] of [Lawry's] life\\". Lawry credited his fellow Victorian for being dignified despite the torment and said the bowler was a \\"pretty fair example of the old expression that good guys run last\\".Coleman, p. 593. Connolly said \\"'Meckie' was one of the nicest guys. It was to his great credit that he wasn't soured by the whole incident.\\"Piesse, p. 190.

While both of these uses can be described as instructional animations, when the goal is to support learning, the term educational animation may be preferred. Educational materials Educational psychology Educational technology Animation ","title":"Instructional animation"},{"id":"2853233","title":"Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii"},{"id":"2853240","text":"Educational animations are animations produced for the specific purpose of fostering learning. It is associated with educational technology with the way it supports teaching and learning through the use of technological tools to facilitate learning and to improve performance.  Background  YukiClip2A The popularity of using animations to help learners understand and remember information has greatly increased since the advent of powerful graphics- oriented computers. This technology allows animations to be produced much more easily and cheaply than in former years. Previously, traditional animation required specialised labour-intensive techniques that were both time-consuming and expensive. In contrast, software is now available that makes it possible for individual educators to author their own animations without the need for specialist expertise. Teachers are no longer limited to relying on static graphics but can readily convert them into educational animations.  Animations for education  Educators are enthusiastically taking up the opportunities that computer animation offers for depicting dynamic content. For example, PowerPoint now has an easy-to-use animation facility that, in the right hands, can produce very effective educational animations. Because animations can explicitly depict changes over time (temporal changes), they seem ideally suited to the teaching of processes and procedures. When used to present dynamic content, animations can mirror both the changes in position (translation), and the changes in form (transformation) that are fundamental to learning this type of subject matter. In contrast with static pictures, animations can show temporal change directly (rather than having to indicate it indirectly using auxiliary markings such as arrows and motion lines). Using animations instead of static graphics removes the need for these added markings so that displays can be not only simpler and less cluttered, but also more vivid, engaging, and more intuitively comprehended. In addition, the learner does not have to interpret the auxiliary markings and try to infer the changes that they summarise. Such interpretation and inference may demand a level of graphicacy skills that the learner does not possess. With animated depictions, information about the changes involved is available to be read straight from the display without the learner needing to perform mental animation. It's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's more like being kissed instead of reading about a kiss. Some animations challenge the learner's processing capacities Research evidence about the educational effectiveness of animations is mixed. Various investigations have compared the educational effectiveness of static and animated displays across a number of content domains. While there have been some findings that show positive effects of animations on learning, other studies have found no effects or even negative effects. Some propose that the efficacy depends on the way the animation characteristics engages the psychological functioning of the learner. In general, it can be concluded that animations are not intrinsically more effective than static graphics. Rather, the particular characteristics of individual animations and how they are used to play a key role in the effects that they have on learning.  Do animations make learning faster?  Well- designed animations may help students learn faster and easier. They are also excellent aid to teachers when it comes to explaining difficult subjects. The difficulty of subjects may arise due to the involvement of mathematics or imagination. For instance, the electric current is invisible. The operation of electric circuits is difficult for students to understand at the beginning. With the aid of computer animations, learning and teaching might become easier, faster and amusing. Animation training of itschool1 According to V.M. Williamson and M.R. Abraham, animation helps students learn in two ways. It facilitates the creation of mental representations of concepts, phenomenon, and processes and it also replaces difficult cognitive processes (e.g. abstraction, imagination). There are also studies that revealed that learning is facilitated as animation create positive attitude among the learners, leading to positive learning outcomes.  Educational effectiveness  Animations may lack educational effectiveness if target learners can't process the presented information adequately. For example, it seems that when the subject matter is complex, learners may be overwhelmed by animated presentations. This is related to the role of visual perception and cognition in human information processing. Our human perceptual and cognitive systems have limited capacities for processing information. If these limits are exceeded, learning may be compromised. For example, the pace at which the animation presents its information may exceed the speed at which the learner can process it effectively. The accompanying animation (part of a pumping system) is problematic for this reason. But the solution is obvious: slow the animation down and accompany it with a written explanation. It is unlikely that superior learning is achieved by thoughtlessly substituting animation for a static graphic but by having it accompany textual explication. Another suggestion for addressing such problems is to provide user control for the learner over how the animation plays. User controllable animations allow learners to vary aspects such as the playing speed and direction, labels and audio commentary to suit themselves.  Perceptual salience versus thematic relevance  Complexity of the subject matter may not be the only reason for difficulties that learners sometimes have with animations. It seems that problems can also arise from the perceptual effects of such presentations. In a poorly designed animation, the information that learners notice most readily in the animation may not be the information that is of greatest importance. Conversely, information that is relatively inconspicuous may be very important. Obviously, perceptibility of information does not necessarily correspond with its actual relevance to the learning task to be performed. Features of the animated display that are most conspicuous because of their contrast with the rest of the display are not always the best place for learners to direct their attention. In other words, there can be a poor correspondence between the perceptual salience ('noticeability') of a feature and its thematic relevance, and an accompanying text is needed to correct this. This correspondence problem can occur with both static and animated graphics. On a purely perceptual level, our attention tends to be attracted by some parts of a static display more than by other parts due to their visuospatial properties. For example, an object that is centrally placed, relatively large, unusually shaped, and of a sharply contrasting colour or texture is likely to 'jump out' of the display so that we notice it very easily. Other items in the display may receive correspondingly less attention as a result. Well-designed static educational graphics take advantage of these perceptual effects. They manipulate the characteristics of the display in order to direct learner attention to the most relevant information. This helps to ensure that the learner will extract the required information from the display. There is a problem in the design of the animation shown above in this respect. Unfortunately, there are many 'educational' graphics being produced that fail to provide learners with sufficient support of this type. Designers of animation need to take such consideration into account.  Dynamic contrast  The correspondence problems due to perceptual characteristics of a display are compounded when we go from a static to an animated graphic. Because of their dynamic character, educational animations introduce a further challenge to information extraction beyond those found with static graphics. Certain aspects of a display that changes over time have the potential to capture learner attention. If there is sufficient dynamic contrast between one or more items in the display and their surroundings, the effect can be very compelling in a perceptual sense. It seems that a fundamental level, our perceptual system is attuned to detect and follow such changes, irrespective of their importance in terms of the subject matter. As with static displays discussed above, items that are perceptually compelling (in this case because of their dynamic character) may not necessarily be of great thematic relevance to the given learning task. The big orange float in the accompanying animation is far more perceptible than the small grey air valve because of both its visuospatial characteristics, and its high level of dynamic contrast with the rest of the display. The misleading effects of the dynamic contrast are likely to be particularly problematic for learners who lack background knowledge in the content domain depicted in an animation. These learners can be largely in the thrall of the animation's raw perceptual effects and so tend to process the presented information in a bottom-up manner. For example, their attention within the display is likely to be directed to items that have conspicuous dynamic characteristics. As a result, there is a danger that they will attend to unimportant information merely because it is perceptually compelling. However, learners who already have considerable domain specific background knowledge are likely to be less influenced by perception alone. This is because their attention is also directed to a considerable extent by their knowledge of which aspects of the subject matter are of most relevance (irrespective of their perceptibility). As a result, their processing of information in the display has a more top-down character. In the pumping system animation example, the air valve would be noticed by those who are already familiar with pumps in general because their existing background knowledge would put them on the lookout for crucial (but visually insignificant) parts of the mechanism.

Very pure uranium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of uranium halides on a hot filament. The uranium isotope 235U is used as the fuel for nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. It is the only isotope existing in nature to any appreciable extent that is fissile, that is, fissionable by thermal neutrons. The isotope 238U is also important because it absorbs neutrons to produce a radioactive isotope that subsequently decays to the isotope 239Pu (plutonium), which also is fissile. Uranium in its natural state comprises just 0.71% 235U and 99.3% 238U, and the main focus of uranium metallurgy is the enrichment of uranium through isotope separation.

Both algorithms work on formulae in Boolean logic that are in, or have been converted into conjunctive normal form. They start by assigning a random value to each variable in the formula. If the assignment satisfies all clauses, the algorithm terminates, returning the assignment. Otherwise, a variable is flipped and the above is then repeated until all the clauses are satisfied. WalkSAT and GSAT differ in the methods used to select which variable to flip. GSAT makes the change which minimizes the number of unsatisfied clauses in the new assignment, or with some probability picks a variable at random. WalkSAT first picks a clause which is unsatisfied by the current assignment, then flips a variable within that clause. The clause is picked at random among unsatisfied clauses. The variable is picked that will result in the fewest previously satisfied clauses becoming unsatisfied, with some probability of picking one of the variables at random. When picking at random, WalkSAT is guaranteed at least a chance of one out of the number of variables in the clause of fixing a currently incorrect assignment. When picking a guessed-to-be-optimal variable, WalkSAT has to do less calculation than GSAT because it is considering fewer possibilities. The algorithm may restart with a new random assignment if no solution has been found for too long, as a way of getting out of local minima of numbers of unsatisfied clauses. Many versions of GSAT and WalkSAT exist. WalkSAT has been proven particularly useful in solving satisfiability problems produced by conversion from automated planning problems. The approach to planning that converts planning problems into Boolean satisfiability problems is called satplan. MaxWalkSAT is a variant of WalkSAT designed to solve the weighted satisfiability problem, in which each clause has associated with a weight, and the goal is to find an assignment‚Äîone which may or may not satisfy the entire formula‚Äîthat maximizes the total weight of the clauses satisfied by that assignment.

He was a Muslim Chinese Indonesian sociologist and was a lecturer at the Universitas Kristen Satya Wacana, Salatiga, Indonesia until 1996. From 1997 for about ten years, he was a professor in Indonesian studies in University of Melbourne, Australia. He was a vocal critic of Indonesian politics. For example, he is quoted in Adam Schwarz's book A Nation in Waiting (1994 edition) as having elucidated the following analysis of third world democracy in 1992, while Suharto was still in power: \\"The first is what I would call loan democracy. This democracy exists when the state is very strong so it can afford to be criticised. A sort of democratic space then emerges in which people can express their opinions freely. However, when the state thinks the criticism has gone too far, it will simply take back the democracy that it has only lent. The people have no power to resist. There is, second, limited democracy. This democracy exists only when there is a conflict among the state elites ... People can criticise one faction of the 'powers that be' and be protected by the opposite faction ... However, when the conflict within the elite is over, this democratic space will probably disappear also.\\" On 23 April 2020, Budinan died after a battle with Parkinson's disease.https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2020/04/23/arief- budiman-dissident-academic-under-new-order-dies-at-79.html Works * co- author with Richard Dobbs, Raoul Oberman, Fraser Thompson and Morten Rosse (2012) The archipelago economy: Unleashing Indonesia's potential KcKinset Global Institute. * as editor with Damien Kingsbury and Barbara Hatley (1999) Reformasi: Crisis and Change in Indonesia Centre for Southeast Asian Studies, Monash University. * as editor with Damien Kingsbury (2001) Indonesia : the uncertain transition Hindmarsh, S.

The film, inspired by the lives of M. G. Ramachandran and M. Karunanidhi, is set against the background of cinema and politics in Tamil Nadu. It stars Mohanlal and Prakash Raj as friends turned political opponents, with Aishwarya Rai, Revathi, Gautami, and Tabu portraying the women in their lives. Rai, who was crowned Miss World 1994, made her screen debut through the film playing dual characters. The high-budget film had its original soundtrack composed by A. R. Rahman and the cinematography was by Santosh Sivan. It was dubbed and released in Malayalam in the same name and in Telugu as Iddaru. This film marked Mohanlal's debut in Tamil cinema after having only a cameo in Gopura Vasalile. The film was screened in the Masters section at the 1997 Toronto International Film Festival. Iruvar went on to become a critical success winning the Best Film award at the Belgrade International Film Festival and two National Film Awards. In 2012, Iruvar was included by critic Rachel Dwyer in the 2012 British Film Institute Sight and Sound 1000 greatest films of all time.BFI In a 2013 interview, Ratnam said he consider Iruvar as his best film. Plot Set in the 1940s, the film begins with Anandan (Mohanlal), a struggling actor, seeking opportunities which will give him a big break in the film industry. Under his uncle's help, Anandan is given an opportunity to audition for the lead role in a forthcoming film. He arrives in the studio and practices his combat skills with sword props provided on the sets while waiting for the director and the crew. At this, he meets Tamizhselvan (Prakash Raj), a small- time writer who enters the studio with some sarcastic poetry and this prompts both into a little debate. The debate turns into a mutual respect for each other, and impressed by Tamizhselvan's skills, Anandan requests Tamizhselvan to write dialogues for him to recite during the audition. With the help of Tamizhselvan's dialogues, Anandan floors the director during the audition and is hired as the hero of the film. Anandan's friendship with Tamizhselvan grows as a result, and Anandan is introduced to Tamizhselvan's political party which is led by Ayya Veluthambi (Nassar). He grows to the party's ideology as time passes by. Anandan then marries a village belle, Pushpavalli (Aishwarya Rai) while Tamizhselvan marries another village girl, Maragatham (Revathy) under the supervision of the party leader. When Anandan returns to Madras, he is greeted by the bad news that the production of the film has been cancelled due to financial difficulties. As Tamizhselvan jubilates at his party's victory, a depressed Anandan is forced to return to old ways of playing extras in the movies. He even loses motivation and doesn't act some parts out well, causing further demotion in his roles. Anandan also sends Pushpa back to her village due to his financial difficulties. At one of the shootings, Anandan is greeted by his mother and uncle with the news that Pushpa has died due to a fever. Tamizhselvan travels down to console a grief-stricken Anandan of his wife's death. A few days later, Anandan's assistant Nambi (Delhi Ganesh) informs him that he has been called up for an audition of the same director's new project (the director who hired him for the stalled movie). Meanwhile, Tamizhselvan, who abandons his pregnant wife while she is giving birth to attend a party meeting. After hearing the casting news from an elated Anandan, he writes dialogues for Anandan once again and the movie starts rolling. Anandan is paired with a rising actress Ramani (Gautami) for the film. The film receives tremendous response upon release and becomes a huge success, propelling Anandan into fame. At this time, Tamizhselvan encourages Anandan to use his popularity to help the party gain attention. While shooting for his next venture, Anandan and Ramani have some romantic brushes, which causes Ramani's uncle (Nizhalgal Ravi), who lusts over her, to beat her up. Ramani comes to Anandan seeking refuge, and Anandan marries her. At this juncture, the party starts to contest in elections. Before elections, Ayya Veluthambi gives Anandan an important mantle in the party, and a seat to contest, much to the displeasure of Tamizhselvan, who thinks Anandan is just a film star, and is not passionate about the party. But before the election, during a fine shoot, Anandan is shot in neck by a freak accident. The party sweeps elections with 152/234 with both Anandan and Tamizhselvan winning from their respective constituencies as new MLAs by huge margins. Ayya Veluthambi denies the CM post, and Tamizhselvan is made CM, worth full support of Anandan, but from then Tamizhselvan starts to see Anandan as a threat to his chair. He, however, keeps Anandan only as a party spokesperson and doesn't provide him a cabinet position. Anandan asks Tamizhselvan for the health minister position, as he is an MLA, which Tamizhselvan refuses, by saying that the executive committee forbids him to do so. That's because a minister cannot pursue cinema while in Office and Anandan has to give up any one. During the return car trip with fellow members, Anandan's aides start breeding hatred by Anandan on Tamizhselvan, saying that Tamizhselvan purposely did not include Anandan in the cabinet. An infuriated Anandan chases the flamers away from his car, but has doubts in his mind nevertheless. That time, Ayya Veluthambi dies and Tamilzhselvan becomes supreme leader of the party, with help of Anandan. Tamizhselvan is later shown to have an extramarital affair with Senthamarai (Tabu), a village girl who loves literature, whom he first met while fighting for his party's causes before the party became successful. He marries her as his second wife subsequently. Meanwhile, Anandan, after his marriage with Ramani, calls up a new actress to audition to be his next heroine (it was a norm for an actor to work with same actress repeatedly during those days). The actress Kalpana (Aishwarya Rai again) resembles the late Pushpa, making Anandan uncomfortable. Ramani however insists that the actress is very talented and should be hired. Their association starts and the open nature of Kalpana's approach towards him makes Anandan more uncomfortable. Anandan finally reveals the truth about Pushpa, and this sparks off an affair between Anandan and Kalpana. In an ensuing party function held to pay tribute to Ayya Veluthambi, Anandan creates controversy by revealing some inside truths of discomfort within the party, prompting Tamizhselvan to sack him from the party. Anandan retaliates by forming his own party to stand in the election. His party priorities see him distancing himself from Kalpana, to whom he has promised to marry. An infuriated Kalpana walks out and starts doing social work. Anandan's heavy star power enables him to win the next general election with 145/234 seats, as he had used his films to spread his political propaganda. As he becomes the new chief minister, a key MLA Madhivanan, jumps from Tamizhselvan's party to Anandan's party, in the belief that Anandan's reign will see less dirty politics, and is made the finance minister. This sparks off a cat and mouse game as Tamizhselvan and Anandan start devising tactics to outdo each other. This includes Anandan having to order Tamizhselvan's arrest after some riots broke out. It slowly dawns that Anandan's reign is no different from Tamizhselvan's and the deputy points out that the same corruption exists in Anandan's reign, to which Anandan says it's the nature of politics. Anandan meets Kalpana again while she is doing social work after a while, and sends Minister Nambi to bring her back. While in the car, Kalpana, Nambi, and his driver all meet with a fatal accident. A distraught Anandan loses motivation after that as life begins to dawn upon him. Tamizhselvan, who just gets released from jail, also slows down in his tactics to dethrone Anandan as age catches up with both of them. During the wedding of Ayya Veluthambi's granddaughter, Anandan and Tamizhselvan meet each other and share a gracious handshake. The wedding takes place in the same place where they first met, prompting some memories and sly smiles from both of them. At the conclusion of the wedding, Anandan loses his footing and falls. The next morning, Ramani tries in vain to wake up Anandan, but he had died in his sleep. Tamizhselvan receives the news that Anandan has died. Initially he thinks that as a rumour but later is proved true. He attends the funeral but is unable to see the body as it is being dressed for the funeral parade. Realizing that people there will always assume him as an enemy of Anandan, he heads back to the place they first met and in an emotional monologue, recites poetry mourning his friend's death which depicts the depth of their friendship. The film ends as Anandan's body is paraded across the streets, mourned by a legion of film fans and politicians, finally coming to the crematorium and being cremated.

Initial speculation suggested that the film would visualise the duel between Vellupillai Prabhakaran and his former Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam deputy Mahattiya, who was executed in 1995 for an alleged plot to kill his mentor, with Aishwarya Rai reported to be playing Indira Gandhi. Mani Ratnam was quick to deny any political backdrop claiming that the film would be about the Indian movie industry, however this proved to bluff the public as the film was to be set within a political canvas. The film was later retitled Iruvar (The Duo) and the idea to make a film on the lives of 1980s Tamil Nadu political icons M. G. Ramachandran and M. Karunanidhi and their influential relationship between Tamil cinema and Dravidian politics by Mani Ratnam was sparked by a conversation he had with renowned Malayalam author, M. T. Vasudevan Nair. =Casting= When interviewed about the difficulties of casting, Mani Ratnam revealed he \\"struggled\\" citing that casting \\"is most important as far as performance is concerned\\" and that \\"fifty per cent of the job is done if you cast correctly\\". Mohanlal was approached to play Anandan, a character inspired by the former actor-politician M. G. Ramachandran and about his performance in the film, Mani Ratnam claimed that Mohanlal had \\"the ability to make everything absolutely realistic with the least amount of effort\\". He described that debutant Aishwarya Rai, the former Miss World beauty pageant winner, who appeared in two different characters - one inspired by actress-politician Jayalalitha, as a \\"tremendous dancer\\" and \\"having a lot of potential\\". The director revealed that the only difficulty Mohanlal and Aishwarya had was the language, both being non-Tamil speakers adding that the pair had to work hard over the dubbing trying to get as close to the Tamil tongue. The actor to play the role of Tamizhselvan, inspired by politician M. Karunanidhi, took substantially longer to finalise with the initial choice, Nana Patekar, withdrawing after several discussions about his remuneration. Later, Mohanlal's Malayalam counterpart Mammootty was offered the role but declined, as did leading Tamil actors Kamal Haasan and Sathyaraj. Negotiations with R. Sarathkumar and Mithun Chakraborty were also unsuccessful as the pair demanded a higher remuneration, while Arvind Swamy was briefly signed on to play the role and had recorded two poems for the soundtrack, before opting out due to other commitments.https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/soc.culture.tamil/J68fuQkdCtw Mani Ratnam also called R. Madhavan, then a small-time model for the screen test, but left him out of the project citing that he thought his eyes looked too young for a senior role.https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/soc.culture.tamil/sandya$20sitaraman/soc.culture.tamil/1EPmpEGDWEg/8xqXWn0UH2YJ Subsequently, Prakash Raj, who had played a small role in Mani Ratnam's 1994 film Bombay was signed up to essay the character. Prakash Raj initially told Mani Ratnam that he was unprepared to essay such a delicate role in such short notice, with Prakash Raj later revealing that Mani Ratnam nurtured the character and brought self-confidence into the actor. Renowned for being a perfectionist film-maker, Mani Ratnam made Prakash Raj take 25 takes for his first shot, lasting over six hours. Actress Tabu was also signed to play an important role in the film and shot for Iruvar alongside her Tamil debut film, Kadhal Desam. =Filming= The film was shot across 1996 and schedules were canned all across India from Kerala to Leh with Mohanlal stating that it was the longest duration he had shot for a film. The film was briefly stopped by the FEFSI strike of 1996, making technicians unavailable for use, but Mani Ratnam carried on filming and completed a song using only natural light. After the shooting for Iruvar was completed, Mani Ratnam asked Prakash Raj to dub in Tamil himself for the first time, with his work taking four days to complete. Release The censors saw the film on 31 December 1996 and opined that various characters in the film reflected the personal lives of some politicians and accordingly a certificate was denied. Following the producer's protest, it was seen by an eight-member revising committee on 2 January 1997 which suggested deletion of some objectionable portions and cleared the film for U/A certification. Four dialogues from the film were subsequently cut. However the objective scenes were muted with a background playing rather than a complete muting of the scenes. The Telugu dubbed version of film, Iddaru, was also muted in a similar fashion with a background score playing. Two days before the release of the film, Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani threatened to mobilise public opinion against its screening in theatres, because he felt that it contained \\"objectionable\\" footage denigrating the Dravidian movement founded by Periyar. The politician threatened legal action, if the film was screened in theatres without removing what he perceived as the \\"offending\\" portion, but Mani Ratnam dismissed that Veeramani was making rushed conclusions without having seen the film. A month after release in February 1997, the regional chief of the censor board G. Rajasekharan brought up the issue again and referred the film to the Indian Home Office for \\"advice\\", threatening that if more scenes were not deleted, it might ultimately, lead to a law and order problem. Controversy Though the movie starts with a note saying \\"Idhu Unmai Kadhai Alla (meaning: this is not a true story),\\" the movie deals with a very sensitive subject of the two men whose lives were chronicled that enjoy an enormous fan following. The dash and flair and captivating oratory abilities of M. Karunanidhi has attracted many millions over the 50 years of his political life and M. G. Ramachandran enjoys a semi-divine status in of his own, in Tamil Nadu. On account of this the movie invited much criticism from both the camps. Moreover, the personal lives of the lead characters (their extramarital relations, ego problems) have been portrayed with near accuracy in the film. M. G. Ramachandran is shown as a person who meets his match in the wiles of J. Jayalalithaa. When the movie was released, various political parties staged demonstrations to prevent theaters from showing the movie. Both M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa denied the relevance of the film to their lives and never admitted to the film being a bio-pichttp://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/2016/dec/07/how- mani-ratnams-iruvar-put-the-spotlight-on-jaya-1546363.html Legacy The film is still regarded as one of Mani Ratnam's best works. Mani Ratnam himself has named Iruvar as his best film, in an interview to National Award-winning film critic Baradwaj Rangan. The movie enjoys enormous fan following among the Tamil diaspora and has achieved cult status over the years. Baradwaj Rangan also named the film the best work of Mani Ratnam, in his list ‚ÄúAll Mani Ratnam Movies Ranked‚Äù . The film was also noted for its vignette style of making, with many single-shot scenes, where a fluid camera setup captures the entire action. Director Gautham Menon mentioned Iruvar as his inspiration, along with Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas, for long single-shot scenes in Neethaane En Ponvasantham.http://behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-events/neethane-en- ponvasantham-press-meet-elred-kumar-gautham-menon.html Awards ;National Film Awards 1997 * Best Supporting Actor - Prakash Raj * Best Cinematography - Santosh Sivan ;International honors * Belgrade International Film Festival - Best Film in the Festival of the Auteur Films * Toronto International Film Festival - Masters section Soundtrack The film's soundtrack features six songs composed by A.

Merging MARC records from the UC campuses into a union catalog was first done in a microfiche format. Online access began in 1980 as a prototype for library staff. In 1981, library patrons were able to access an online electronic catalog of UC library books using a computer terminal. Since no network existed to connect the libraries of the nine campuses to the central site hosting the union catalog, options for a networking solution were analyzed, with X.25 and TCP/IP being considered. By 1984, a TCP/IP network linking the campuses using satellite technology was operational. At the time, Melvyl ran on a mainframe computer, and the UC Division of Library Automation performed development work to implement TCP/IP in order to provide telnet access. A world wide web version was also later developed. The mainframe system, retired in 2003, was replaced using commercial software from the integrated library system vendor Ex Libris.

The film explores the tensions of married life between two young people who elope and the maturing of love among urban Indians who are conflicted between tradition and modernity. The score and soundtrack were composed by A. R. Rahman. This movie marks the Tamil debut of Madhavan, who acted in two films before this, one in English-language and one in Kannada. The film's story is mostly recollected in flashbacks by Karthik (Madhavan), on how he and Shakthi (Shalini) fall in love against the backdrop of Chennai and its suburban trains, against the wishes of their parents. The film was well- received by critics and it did well at the Tamil and dubbed Telugu version box-offices primarily for its music and realistic portrayal of romance and married life. The film made its European premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2001. It was shown at various film festivals nationally and internationally. It also carried a very popular soundtrack, composed by A. R. Rahman. Alaipayuthey was also dubbed and released in Telugu as Sakhi and was later remade and released in Hindi in 2002, as Saathiya, directed by Ratnam's former assistant Shaad Ali.  Plot  Karthik Varadarajan is an independent and free-spirited software engineering graduate from a rich family who owns a startup along with his friends. At a friend's wedding, he meets Shakthi Selvaraj, a medical student from a middle-class family. The duo constantly bump into each other on the local commuter trains they both use and eventually fall in love. Karthik pursues Shakthi aggressively and proposes marriage. Shakthi, however, is reluctant. Karthik manages to convince Shakthi and request his parents to formally ask Shakthi's parents for her hand in marriage. However, when the parents meet, they do not get along, and Shakthi calls off the relationship altogether and leaves for an extended medical camp in Kerala. While apart, both Karthik and Shakthi realise that they are desperately in love and decide to get married without the knowledge or consent of their parents. They continue living separate lives after marriage, meeting outside of their homes and hoping that their parents will see eye to eye at some point in the future, and can be informed of the marriage. However, when the family of a Hyundai executive named Raghuraman arrive at Shakthi's house one day to discuss about a prospective wedding alliance between Raghuraman and Shakthi's elder sister Poorni, developments ensue resulting in Shakthi's parents attempting to fix her marriage to Raghuraman's younger brother Shyam. Shakthi confesses to her parents and Raghuraman's family that she is already married, leading to the alliance being called off, and her parents throw her out of the house. Karthik too divulges the same to his parents and is also asked by his father to leave his house. Karthik and Shakthi start living together in a partially-constructed apartment and while all goes well for a while, they soon find that marriage is not as easy as they expected, and living under the same roof results in a large number of conflicts. The marriage gets increasingly tense as both have to cope with frustrations and disappointments. Shakthi soon learns that her father is diagnosed with jaundice and requests Karthik to visit him at the hospital. Karthik declines, citing her father's hatred of him as the main reason. He eventually agrees to meet him the following day, but by the time they reach her house, Shakthi's father passes away. Wracked with guilt, the two return home, their relationship taking a turn for the worse. The two stop talking to each other. Meanwhile, Karthik takes it upon himself to fix Poorni's broken alliance with Raghuraman. He arranges a blind date between the two, which initially fails. However, with more meetings, Poorni and Raghuraman become closer. This development takes place without Shakthi's knowledge. Karthik waits until Poorni and Raghuraman's marriage is confirmed before deciding to tell Shakthi. But, Shakthi witnesses Poorni hugging Karthik in gratitude at the railway station, and misunderstands that he is having an affair with Poorni, worsening their relationship. Shakthi eventually learns from Poorni about her husband's efforts in getting her married and is overcome with guilt. Karthik sets off on the same evening to the railway station to pick up his wife as is their usual routine. In her rush to get home and makeup with Karthik, Shakthi meets with a serious accident. Karthik waits for her, and as she fails to turn up searches desperately for her throughout the city, ultimately discovering her in the ICU of a hospital. Karthik learns that Shakthi is registered under another name and is in a coma after having undergone brain surgery. An IAS officer Ram admits that he caused the accident and admitted Shakthi in the hospital. As Karthik vents out his frustration on Ram, his wife intervenes and lets Karthik know that she was the person who caused the accident and injured Shakthi, and her husband was merely trying to protect her by taking the blame himself. Karthik observes Ram and notes that he has a lot to learn from the latter. He proceeds to Shakthi and admits that he could have been a better husband. Shakthi wakes up from her coma and the two reconcile.

Mani Ratnam opted to make a romantic film with relative newcomers after his 1998 Hindi film Dil Se.. and signed on small screen actor Madhavan to make his acting debut in Tamil films. Madhavan had done a sandalwood talc ad for Santosh Sivan in 1996 and the veteran cinematographer gave photographs of the actor to Mani Ratnam during the casting process of Iruvar. The director had made Madhavan audition for a role in the film but turned him down citing that \\"he thought his eyes were too young\\" and assured \\"that they would work together some other time\\". In 1999, Mani Ratnam rang Madhavan up suddenly and told him to \\"Come down and we will do a photo session. I am starting a film with you\\", much to the actor's surprise. Mani Ratnam initially wanted to cast a debutant in the lead female role as well and carried out a screen test with Vasundhara Das, before signing on Shalini to play the role in the film in April 1999. Swarnamalya was selected to play the role of Poorni after the director spotted her on a television show and subsequently asked her to screen test for the film. The actress appeared without make-up in the film and also dubbed her own lines. Theatre actor, Karthik Kumar of Evam, also marked his film debut with a minor supporting role as a potential suitor to Shakti. Prior to the release of his breakthrough film Sethu (1999), actor Vikram was approached by Mani Ratnam to play the role of Swarnamalya's fianc√© in the film but turned down the offer. Television actress Sriranjini made her film debut with this film appearing as Madhavan's sister-in-law while Raviprakash appeared as Shalini's father thus making his acting debut with the film. Venu Aravind and Pondy Ravi appeared as police officers. Mani roped in producer Pyramid Natarajan to portray the character of Madhavan's father. Azhagam Perumal who was one of the assistant directors in the film was chosen to portray the small role of a house owner as Mani was looking for \\"someone like Jagathy Sreekumar to play the quirky house owner\\". The film also required two leading actors to appear in supporting roles with Kushboo roped in to do a role. After considering either Shahrukh Khan, Mammooty or Mohanlal, Mani Ratnam signed Arvind Swamy to play another role, with Alaipayuthey becoming the pair's fourth production together. P. C. Sriram renewed his collaboration with Mani Ratnam after seven years, with the director toggling between Santosh Sivan and Rajiv Menon for his other projects. A. R. Rahman was initially signed on just to compose the background score for the film as the film was originally planned to be \\"songless\\", however after a change of heart, nine songs were recorded. The film began without an official launch, like other Mani Ratnam projects, and it was initially expected that filming would be wrapped up under four months. During the first seven days of the shoot, Mani Ratnam filmed portions featuring Shalini and made Madhavan stay on the sets and watch his process of film- making. The first scene the actor shot was the post-interval scene featuring Shakthi's mother played by Jayasudha. The song sequences Evano Oruvan, and September Matham was shot at Western Plywood Guesthouse and the Dharmadam Island respectively. The team shot at Srinagar in late for 25 days, becoming the last production team to shoot in the area until 2003 as a result of the Kashmir conflict. A \\"meet the stars\\" publicity event was held at Music World in Spencer Plaza in March 2000, with the gathering being described as a success. About the production process, Madhavan revealed that he learnt about the technical aspects of film-making from the director and mentioned that he even learned the entire script of the film, irrespective of whether I was in the scene or not, claiming that working with Mani Ratnam inspires that sort of involvement and dedication.  Release and reception  Alaipayuthey was released on 14 April 2000, during Puthandu (Tamil New Year). The Hindu cited the film saying, \\"The wavy movements are not restricted to the title card alone. Alaipayuthey goes backward and forward in time and the movement holds a thin thread of suspense too. The oscillation from joy and levity to seriousness and sorrow creates impressive waves\\", The lead pair performance was praised saying, \\"Shalini once again proves that she is a natural performer while Madhavan sails through the litmus test with ease\\". Similarly Indolink.com mentioned that \\"Mani's directorial mind and heart sways beautifully like his film\\" and that the film is \\"worth seeing with the whole family\\". However Rediff.com gave the film a middling review citing that the film is \\"old wine in an old bottle\\" and that \\"the only person who scores good marks in the film is P. C. Sreeram\\", describing \\"he has used his camera as a paintbrush and the strokes are so stunningly beautiful that, once the film is over, one remembers only the visual treat\\". In regard to performances, the critic mentions that Madhavan \\"looks pleasant and handsome and does his job splendidly until the end, where he looks totally lost in the most crucial scene\\" and that Shalini \\"is very beautiful but not as open as she used to be as a child star\\". Alaipayuthey was dubbed and released as Sakhi in Telugu and was later remade in Hindi cinema as Saathiya, by Mani Ratnam's assistant Shaad Ali in 2002, starring Rani Mukherjee and Vivek Oberoi. It was the first time where the director had sold off production rights' of his films to be remade in another language as he had previously opted to dub and release the film himself.  Legacy  The film began a successful film career for Madhavan and launched him as a \\"romantic hero\\". He has since gone on to become a regular part of the cast in Mani Ratnam's productions and featured in leading roles in Dumm Dumm Dumm (2001), Kannathil Muthamittal (2002), Aaytha Ezhuthu (2004) and Guru (2007). Meanwhile, Shalini had already agreed to call time on her career before release due to her pending marriage with Ajith Kumar and Alaipayuthey became her penultimate release. Swarnamalya also received several film offers after her critically acclaimed performance, but consecutive failures of eight of her ten movies since failed to catapult her into the leading bracket of actors. Post-release, the actress had also expressed her disappointment at several of her scenes being edited out of the film. In July 2011, Janani Iyer said she considered a role like Shalini's character from the film as \\"really challenging\\". Gautham Menon revealed that the scene prior to the song \\"Evano Oruvan\\" was \\"almost straight out of real life\\" and that he \\"tried to incorporate such moments\\" in his films. The film created an interest for weddings held in temple.  In popular culture  Several other directors have made cultural references to Alaipayuthey, with both scenes and songs being alluded in their films. The scene where Madhavan proposes Shalini in the train was spoofed in Boss Engira Bhaskaran (2010) where Bhaskaran (Arya) tries to do the same with Chandrika (Nayantara) but fails. When Madhavan saw that film, he said \\"It was a pleasant shock to see this clip feature in BEB. It was such a sweet tribute to me. After watching this sequence, I was quite amused to see how thin I was back then!\\" In Budget Padmanabhan (2000), Vivek speaks to Bhuvaneswari through cups attached with wires. Vivek utters Madhavan's dialogue from the film by mimicking his voice, he then hurts Theni Kunjarammal's eye by singing the film's song.Budget Padmanabhan (DVD) In Shahjahan (2001), Vivek and Kovai Sarala sings \\"Snegithane\\" in a humorous vein.Shahjahan (DVD) The Hindi television series Beintehaa was dubbed in Tamil as Alaipayuthe. Songs from the film inspired several film titles ‚Äì Snegithiye (2000), Dumm Dumm Dumm (2001), Kadhal Sadugudu (2003), Evano Oruvan (2007), Pachai Nirame (2008), Ragasiya Snehithane (2008) and Endrendrum Punnagai (2013). Posters of Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya (2010) were inspired from various films including Alaipayuthey.  Soundtrack  The music score that accompanies the film was composed by A. R. Rahman. Upon release, the album met with widespread critical acclaim, selling over six lakh cassettes, and went on to win the Filmfare Award for Best Music Director in 2000. The soundtrack features 10 songs composed by Rahman, with lyrics by Vairamuthu, except for the title song \\"Alai Payuthey\\" (which was created by the 18th-century Carnatic music composer Oothukkadu Venkata Kavi, who also set it to the raagam Kannada). The song \\"Yaro Yarodi\\" later appeared in the 2008 Hollywood film, The Accidental Husband. The audio rights were sold to Saregama, a prominent music label in the 1999s. Karthik worked as chorus singer for the film while Clinton Cerejo made his debut as playback singer. Song \\"Kadhal Sadugudu\\" provided major breakthrough for its singer S. P. Charan.

A defender in his playing days, he captained the Nigeria national team to its first win in the African Nations Cup. Playing career As a player, he became the captain of Enugu Rangers football club and the Nigeria national team in the late 1970s. He was the first Nigerian captain to lift the African Nations Cup trophy after a 3‚Äì0 victory over Algeria in the final of the 1980 tournament. Coaching career Chukwu started his coaching career in Lebanon in the mid-1990s, before being appointed coach of the Kenya national team in 1998. Later, from 2003 to 2005, he coached Nigeria, leading them to reach semifinals at the 2004 African Cup of Nations. During the 2006 World Cup qualification phase, Chukwu was blamed for inept coaching and management of the Nigerian national football team, and two matches before the qualifying campaign was over, he was suspended. In two matches ‚Äì home and away ‚Äì against eventual group winners Angola, Nigeria failed to win either one of those two encounters. This was blamed on Chukwu and those two crucial failures eventually led to Nigeria failing to qualify for the World Cup, after having appeared at all World Cup finals tournaments since their debut in 1994. Chukwu coached Enugu Rangers to 6th place in the 2008‚Äì2009 edition of the Nigeria Premier League. However, he was sacked on 5 August 2009 for failing to reach the club's targets for the season. Later life In April 2019 the Nigeria Football Federation announced that they would help Chukwu pay for his medical bills for treatment in the United States, while billionaire Femi Otedola said he would also contribute. It was later announced that he would travel for treatment in May after the required funds were raised he was cured.

Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting point of iron. Reduced iron derives its name from these processes, one example being heating iron ore in a furnace at a high temperature of in the presence of the reducing gas syngas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.  Process  Direct reduction processes can be divided roughly into two categories: gas-based, and coal-based. In both cases, the objective of the process is to drive off the oxygen contained in various forms of iron ore (sized ore, concentrates, pellets, mill scale, furnace dust, etc.), in order to convert the ore to metallic iron, without melting it (below ). The direct reduction process is comparatively energy efficient. Steel made using DRI requires significantly less fuel, in that a traditional blast furnace is not needed. DRI is most commonly made into steel using electric arc furnaces to take advantage of the heat produced by the DRI product.R. J. Fruehan, et al. (2000). Theoretical Minimum Energies to Produce Steel (for Selected Conditions) = Benefits = Direct reduction processes were developed to overcome the difficulties of conventional blast furnaces. DRI plants need not be part of an integrated steel plant, as is characteristic of blast furnaces. The initial capital investment and operating costs of direct reduction plants are lower than integrated steel plants and are more suitable for developing countries where supplies of high grade coking coal are limited, but where steel scrap is generally available for recycling. India is the world‚Äôs largest producer of direct-reduced iron. Many other countries use variants of the process. Factors that help make DRI economical: * Direct-reduced iron has about the same iron content as pig iron, typically 90‚Äì94% total iron (depending on the quality of the raw ore) so it is an excellent feedstock for the electric furnaces used by mini mills, allowing them to use lower grades of scrap for the rest of the charge or to produce higher grades of steel. * Hot- briquetted iron (HBI) is a compacted form of DRI designed for ease of shipping, handling and storage. * Hot direct reduced iron (HDRI) is DRI that is transported hot, directly from the reduction furnace, into an electric arc furnace, thereby saving energy. * The direct reduction process uses pelletized iron ore or natural \\"lump\\" ore. One exception is the fluidized bed process which requires sized iron ore particles. * The direct reduction process can use natural gas contaminated with inert gases, avoiding the need to remove these gases for other use. However, any inert gas contamination of the reducing gas lowers the effect (quality) of that gas stream and the thermal efficiency of the process. * Supplies of powdered ore and raw natural gas are both available in areas such as Northern Australia, avoiding transport costs for the gas. In most cases the DRI plant is located near a natural gas source as it is more cost effective to ship the ore rather than the gas. * The DRI method produces 97% pure iron. * To eliminate fossil fuel use in iron and steel making, renewable hydrogen gas can be used in place of syngas to produce DRI. = Problems = Direct reduced iron is highly susceptible to oxidation and rusting if left unprotected, and is normally quickly processed further to steel. The bulk iron can also catch fire since it is pyrophoric. (dead link 24 October 2019) Unlike blast furnace pig iron, which is almost pure metal, DRI contains some siliceous gangue (if made from scrap, not from new iron from direct reduced iron with natural gas), which needs to be removed in the steel- making process.  History  Producing sponge iron and then working it was the earliest method used to obtain iron in the Middle East, Egypt, and Europe, where it remained in use until at least the 16th century. There is some evidence that the bloomery method was also used in China, but China had developed blast furnaces to obtain pig iron by 500 BCE. The advantage of the bloomery technique is that iron can be obtained at a lower furnace temperature, only about 1,100 ¬∞C or so. The disadvantage, relative to a blast furnace, is that only small quantities can be made at a time.  Chemistry  The following reactions successively convert hematite (from iron ore) to magnetite, magnetite to ferrous oxide, and ferrous oxide to iron by reduction with carbon monoxide or hydrogen. 3 Fe2O3 + CO/H2 -> 2 Fe3O4 + CO2/H2O Fe3O4 + CO/H2 -> 3 FeO + CO2/H2O FeO + CO/H2 -> Fe + CO2/H2O Carburizing produces cementite. 3 Fe + CH4 -> Fe3C + 2H2 3 Fe + 2CO -> Fe3C + CO2 3 Fe + CO +H2 -> Fe3C + H2O  Uses  Sponge iron is not useful by itself, but can be processed to create wrought iron or steel. The sponge is removed from the furnace, called a bloomery, and repeatedly beaten with heavy hammers and folded over to remove the slag, oxidise any carbon or carbide and weld the iron together. This treatment usually creates wrought iron with about three percent slag and a fraction of a percent of other impurities. Further treatment may add controlled amounts of carbon, allowing various kinds of heat treatment (e.g. \\"steeling\\"). Today, sponge iron is created by reducing iron ore without melting it. This makes for an energy-efficient feedstock for specialty steel manufacturers which used to rely upon scrap metal.

Cricket career In cricket, Slater was an all-rounder who played in only one Test match, against England in 1958-59, but he played 67 first-class matches for Western Australia between 1955 and 1968. He had his best batting season in 1963-64, scoring 655 runs at an average of 38.52, and scored his only century, 154 against Queensland, when he opened the batting and helped Western Australia avert defeat. His best bowling season was 1960-61, when he took 30 wickets at an average of 32.43. He toured New Zealand with the Australian team in 1959-60, playing in two of the four matches against New Zealand.Wisden 1961, pp. 847-53. His international career was shortened by doubts over his bowling action. Slater wasn't selected for the 1961 Ashes tour of England, even though he had been widely expected to go. The chairman of selectors, Don Bradman, explained it to him as a policy of the Imperial Cricket Conference to exclude bowlers with doubtful actions. He later showed Slater a film of his bowling to illustrate. Slater was indeed called for throwing while playing against New South Wales in 1964‚Äì65. Australian rules football career Slater was a star footballer for Swan Districts and Subiaco and played in the 1961 WANFL grand final with Swans against East Perth and his display in containing ‚ÄúPolly‚Äù Farmer won him the Simpson Medal in a huge upset victory.Devaney, John; Full Points Footy‚Äôs WA Football Companion; p. 293. He continued to play for Swans for the following two seasons before Subiaco, who had between 1947 and 1956 constantly occupied the bottom two places with Swans and whose president Frank Exell had approached Slater a season before, lured him as their captain-coach after two disappointing seasons.Spillman, Ken; Diehards: The Story of the Subiaco Football Club 1946‚Äì2000, p. 99. In Slater's first season the Maroons made only their fourth open-age finals appearance since 1936, but were unexpectedly defeated by the equally unsuccessful Claremont in a rainy first semi-final. The following two seasons proved very disappointing, with the Maroons winning only eight games in 1965 and six (plus one draw) in 1966, when they lost their last nine matches. This led to questioning of Slater's coaching methods, notably his taking the Maroons on a trip to Singapore during the 1964/1965 off-season, and his contract was not renewed for 1967.Spillman; Diehards 1946‚Äì2000; pp. 103‚Äì108 Slater returned to Swan Districts for 1967 but retired following that season. Later life After he retired from playing, Slater ran a sports store, Slater Gartrell, in Perth, and was also a television and radio sports commentator. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2020 Australia Day Honours for \\"significant service to cricket, Australian rules football, and baseball, in Western Australia\\".

D. Chakravarthy, Prakash Raj and Pasupathy portraying other pivotal characters. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by A. R. Rahman, while Ravi K. Chandran handled the cinematography. Mani Ratnam presents the story of a child of Sri Lankan Tamil parentage adopted by Indian parents, whose desire is to meet her biological mother in the midst of the Sri Lankan Civil War. It was released on 14 February 2002. The film premiered at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival, It also received a strong reception when screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 2003.The film received high critical acclaim upon release and went on to win six National Film Awards, three Filmfare Awards South, six Cinema Express Awards, seven Tamil Nadu State Film Awards and Best Film awards at six international film festivals. The film has won a total of 40 awards since its release. Plot The film begins in a small village in Sri Lanka called Mankulam, where M. D. Shyama (Nandita Das) is married to Dileepan (J. D. Chakravarthy), who along with a few other Sri Lankan Tamils in the village, is part of the LTTE. While having a quiet moment, the couple hears sounds of Sri Lankan Army troops approaching. He asks Shyama to leave while he remains in the forest. Shyama realizes that she is pregnant and waits in vain for Dileepan‚Äôs return. Her villagers begin fleeing to India to seek refugee due to the war. Shyama is initially stubborn to leave her husband behind, but her relatives convince her to seek refuge for her unborn child's sake. The villagers board a boat to the shores of Rameswaram. On the journey, one of the rebels says that he has seen her husband, Dileepan, with bullet wounds in the forest. Shyama wants the boat to turn around but it is too late. In Rameswaram, while a local collector takes down the names of the refugees, Shyama gives birth to a baby girl. However, the urge to find her possibly wounded husband and reunite with her people back home overwhelms Shyama and she leaves behind the newborn girl, hoping that the girl will lead a better life. Nine years later in Chennai, a young girl, Amudha (Baby Keerthana) narrates her family life. She introduces her father, writer Thiruchelvan (R. Madhavan), who uses the pen name 'Indira' for his books. Indira (Simran) is Amudha's mother, while she has a younger brother named Vinay and another younger brother called Akhil. Amudha's ninth birthday approaches and both of her parents take her to the temple. Indira later reminds Thiruchelvan of their promise to reveal 'the truth' to Amudha on her ninth birthday. After their prayers, Thiruchelvan brings Amudha to Marina Beach and reveals the truth that she was adopted from a refugee camp in Rameswaram and is not their biological daughter. Amudha is heavily disturbed after hearing the news and begins distancing herself from the family. Indira's father criticizes them for revealing the truth to her, but Thiruchelvan and Indira are certain they have taken the right decision. Amudha asks her adoptive parents about her adoption. The film then flashes to nine years ago in Rameswaram, where Thiruchelvan, then a budding writer, constantly travels to the refugee camp and writes stories inspired by the people there. At one such instance, Thiruchelvan sees a newborn baby girl and writes a short story about her. Indira is his neighbour, and has always expressed an interest in him. Thiruchelvan, after a while, finds the urge to adopt the girl, but realizes that he will not be allowed to do so until he is married. He then proposes to Indira in order to be able to adopt the baby. Indira suggests the name 'Amudha' after seeing the baby once, and then adopt the baby after they marry each other. Vinay was born few years after their marriage, followed by Akhil, and thus, the family happened. Even after hearing this, Amudha is dissatisfied. She requests to meet her mother despite Indira's insistence that they can't possibly find her even if they wanted to. She and her cousin then go secretly to Rameshwaram to the orphanage from where she was adopted, to check the records. The family chases them there and is shocked to see her stubbornness. Thiruchelvan gives in and agrees to take Amudha to Sri Lanka to find her birth mother. Leaving the two boys under the care of Indira's father, the trio travel to Sri Lanka and are greeted by Dr. Herold Vikramasinghe (Prakash Raj), a Sinhalese friend of Thiruchelvan, who also helps them to find Amudha's birth mother. Amudha and Indira's relationship strains as Amudha becomes increasingly rude at her adoptive mother while urging to find her birth mother. While taking a walk in the nearby jungle, Thiruchelvan and Vikramasinghe are captured by a group of LTTE rebels. Thiruchelvan immediately recites Tamil poetry and is identified as Indira by the group's leader (Pasupathy). Thiruchelvan explains his motives of coming to the country, mentioning the only evidence that he has regarding Amudha's birth mother is that her name is Shyama. The group leader arranges a meet and says he will bring Shyama to the spot. It is later revealed that Shyama is the group leader's sister who is also a part of the LTTE rebels living in seclusion. The next day, Vikramasinghe, Amudha, Indira, and Thiruchelvan wait at the spot, but a sudden series of bombings break out at the place as the Sri Lankan army tries to infiltrate the hideout of the rebels. Indira gets shot in her arm in the process. The family finally leaves the place, and Amudha, apologizes to Indira and asks all of them to return to India. The next day, the family leaves for the airport but unexpectedly, Indira requests that they drive through the meeting spot one more time. As they wait, Shyama arrives. Amudha gives Shyama a photo album and asks Shyama a series of questions, some which Shyama is unable to answer. As the emotional meeting comes to an end, Amudha begs Shyama to come back with her to Madras but Shyama tearfully refuses saying that she has work to do in Sri Lanka and that someday there will be peace in the country and when that day comes Amudha should come back to her then. The film ends with Thiruchelvan, Amudha, and Indira hugging each other as Shyama leaves, and a teary-eyed Amudha kisses her parents, re-affirming her love for them.

The film was reported of a trilogy of films based on love and peace in the backdrop of war after Roja (1992) , Bombay (1995) and Dil Se (1998). The film was originally conceived as a taut racy thriller that centres on a script based on a female leader of a guerilla group - with Mani Ratnam later choosing to base the film on human relationships with the backdrop of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Madhavan was signed up to play a leading role in the film, with the venture becoming his third straight Mani Ratnam project after Alaipayuthey and the Mani Ratnam production, Dumm Dumm Dumm. For the role of Indira, Mani Ratnam considered casting either Soundarya or relative newcomer Bhumika Chawla , before finalising Simran to portray the character. Madhavan and Simran thus shot for two films simultaneously together, as they had also been cast in K. Balachandar's Paarthale Paravasam as a married couple. Nandita Das was also roped in for the film, making her debut in Tamil films, and in a later interview mentioned that the team shot for nearly thirteen hours a day. P. S. Keerthana, the second daughter of actors Parthiban and Seetha, was cast the child artiste in the film, while Prakash Raj was also roped in to play a Sinhalese character. Mani Ratnam approached actor Vikram to make a special appearance as Keerthana's biological father in the film, but his refusal meant that J. D. Chakravarthy was later handed the role.http://www.caravanmagazine.in/arts/man-steel?page=0,3 The title of the film was finally announced as Kannathil Muthammittal (A peck on the cheek) in July 2001, after a famous phrase from a poem written by Subramanya Bharathi. Parts of the film shown to be Colombo in the film were shot in Puducherry. Further schedules were carried out in the forests of Kerala to depict the base of the LTTE in northern Sri Lanka. As most of the cast were non-native Tamil speakers, dubbing artistes were used with actresses Sukanya and Deepa Venkat lending their voices for Nandita Das and Simran respectively. Furthermore, Mounika lent her voice for Easwari Rao's character, while Thalaivasal Vijay spoke lines for Chakravarthy.

This is achieved by taking two pieces of dense timber, typically oak, each of a length a little more than twice the widest width of the strake. A coach bolt (see carriage bolt) is fitted through the middle and adjusted so that the gripe will fit onto the land (the joint between the adjacent strakes) while admitting the point of a wedge between the free ends of the two parts of the gripe. The wedge is then tapped in so that the gripe grips the land, using the bolt as a fulcrum. The name is pronounced with the 'i' as a long diphthong and is a form of the word 'grip'.

The organisation was known as Strummerville until December 2014.Strummerville is now The Joe Strummer Foundation  Organisation  Joe Strummer The Joe Strummer Foundation is a registered charity that supports aspiring musicians and funds projects which promote new music. The foundation's chief director, Trish Whelan, described it as an effort to cultivate interest and interactivity among young artists. \\"We are not a label, so there's no ulterior motive for us. It's not a training ground for pop stars, it's about helping people express themselves through music.\\" The foundation extends encouragement and material support to all unsigned musicians. The foundation operates the \\"Strummerville Studio\\", a free workshop and rehearsal space (decorated with handwritten lyrics by Strummer himself) at The Roundhouse in London. Other charitable facilities include two studios located in Belfast at the Oh Yeah music centre and one in Bogota, built in partnership with the international non-profit Fairtunes. In 2007, the foundation began operating one of the stages at the Glastonbury Festival, the annual performing arts event that had become one of Strummer's passions in his later life, dubbing it The Strummerville Bandstand. Also at Glastonbury is a small campsite named for Strummer that is the scene of intimate fireside performances. The foundation has given support to hundreds of musicians including some, like Bastille and Anna Calvi, that have gone on to find wide audiences.

H. Price, was a Welsh philosopher, known for his work on the philosophy of perception. He also wrote on parapsychology. Biography Born in Neath, Glamorganshire, Wales, Price was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford. He obtained first-class honours in Literae Humaniores in 1921. He was a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, 1922‚Äì4, Assistant Lecturer in philosophy at the university of Liverpool (1922‚Äì23), Fellow and Tutor of Trinity College, Oxford (1924‚Äì35), Lecturer in philosophy at Oxford (1932‚Äì35) and Wykeham Professor of Logic and Fellow of New College (1935‚Äì59). Price was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1943 to 1944. He was elected to the British Academy in 1943. Price is perhaps best known for his work on the philosophy of perception. He argues for a sophisticated sense-datum account, although he rejects phenomenalism. In his book Thinking and Experience, he moves from perception to thought and argues for a dispositionalist account of conceptual cognition. Concepts are held to be a kind of intellectual capacity, manifested in perceptual contexts as recognitional capacities. For Price, concepts are not some kind of mental entity or representation. The ultimate appeal is to a species of memory distinct from event recollection. He died in Oxford. Parapsychology Price had written various publications on parapsychology, often advocating new concepts and theories. He was President of the Society for Psychical Research (1939‚Äì40, 1960‚Äì1) =Afterlife= Price had speculated on the nature of the afterlife and developed his own hypothesis about what the afterlife may be like. According to Price after death the self will find itself in a dream world of memories and mental images from their life. Price wrote that the hypothetical \\"next world would be realms of real mental images.\\" Price however believed that the self may be able to draw upon its memories of previous physical existence to create an environment of totally new images. According to Price, the dream world will not follow the laws of physics just as ordinary dreams do not. In addition, he wrote that each person will experience a world of their own, though he also wrote that the dream world doesn't necessarily have to be solipsistic as different selves may be able to communicate with each other by dream telepathy.Price, H.

He wrote that this hypothesis would explain where the memories would be stored for hauntings as well as for clairvoyance, ghosts and other paranormal phenomena. Price proposed that a universal psychic ether coexisting dimension exists as an intermediary between the mental and ordinary matter. According to Price the psychic ether consists of images and ideas. Price wrote that apparitions are actually memories from people and that under the right conditions they can be seen as hallucinations. Price believed that the dreamlike world of the afterlife exists in the psychic ether.Price, H. H. (1939).

He won $4,250,000 as the result of this second place finish. Accounting career Dannenmann has been a certified public accountant, financial advisor and mortgage loan officer in his own firm since 1991. After his second place Main Event finish, Dannenmann said that he would not quit his job because it has taken a long time to establish his business and finds much passion advising his clients to make sound financial decisions. Poker career Arriving as a fresh face on the poker scene, during one WSOP segment he claimed to be merely \\"the fourth best player in his home game\\" prior to his entry in the Main Event. In fact the 2005 WSOP Main Event was his very first recorded tournament cash. Before this, he mainly played in his home game with friends. He did not want to pay the entire main event fee himself so he split the $10,000 entry fee 50/50 with his friend Jerry Ditzel. After finishing 2nd in the Main Event, Dannenmann split the $4,250,000 prize with him. Dannenmann feels that Dan Harrington's book on the end-game of No Limit Hold-Em tournaments helped him greatly with his success. He read volume II just days before playing the Main Event. On the way to second place, he knocked out 1994 WSOP champion Russ Hamilton and Mike Matusow. His finish in the main event qualified him for the 2005 WSOP Tournament of Champions, where he finished in fifth place and won $100,000. During the final table, he lambasted Phil Hellmuth Jr for his behaviour toward the tournament director by refusing to stack his chips and purposely and continuously slowing the tournament down. Dannenmann considers himself to be superstitious. He refuses to ride in a cab unless the cab ended in an even number that year, wore the same shirt 7 days in a row during the tournament, and used his lucky globe as a card protector.

It stars Suriya, Madhavan, Siddharth, Trisha, Meera Jasmine, and Esha Deol in the lead roles, while Bharathiraja appears in another pivotal role. The title of the movie was taken from the name of a Tamil letter, ‡ÆÉ ‚Äì three dots corresponding to the film's three different personalities from completely different strata of society. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by A. R. Rahman, while Ravi K. Chandran was the cinematographer and Sreekar Prasad was the editor. The film was simultaneously shot in Hindi as Yuva with an entirely different cast retaining Deol, while a dubbed version in Telugu, Yuva was also released. The film was produced by Ratnam's home banner, Madras Talkies and was released on 21 May 2004. Plot The film begins with Inba Sekar (Madhavan) shooting Michael Vasanth (Surya) on his bike, resulting in him falling off the Napier Bridge into the water below which is witnessed by Arjun Balakrishnan (Siddharth). The flashback of the characters prior to the incident then unveils. Inba Sekar grew up to be a goon as his brother Gunasekaran had left him to fend for himself, and he had no option of earning. He loves, marries and abuses his wife Sashi (Meera Jasmine). He gets into a contract under Guna's recommendation to run errands and work as a hitman for Selvanayagam (Bharathiraja), a politician. Michael is an influential student leader who wants politicians like Selvanayagam to keep away from college elections. Michael is in love with his neighbor Geetha (Esha Deol), who lives with her uncle and aunt. Selvanayagam is worried when he hears news of students standing in the election. He uses every possible tactic to get them out of politics. Firstly, he provides scholarship to study at a prestigious foreign university to Michael. When Michael refuses the bribe, Inba takes control under Guna's orders. Inba beats some students but faces very strong retaliation from Michael and other students. Inba and his thug friend Dilli (Sriman) meet Michael face-to-face and fall into a tussle after Inba threatens the latter to leave politics. Arjun Balakrishnan (Siddharth) is the carefree and spoiled son of an IAS officer. He wants to relocate to the US for a better future. He falls in love with Meera (Trisha), whom he just met. One day, Arjun proposes to Meera on the road, and she gets into an auto while telling him to prove it, playfully. Arjun hitches a ride from Michael, who is riding in the same direction, to catch up with Meera. Suddenly, Michael is shot by three rounds fired by Inba but Arjun saves him. Critically injured, Michael is rushed to the hospital by Meera and Arjun. Inba finds out that Michael is recovering from his injuries and this is witnessed by Arjun, who follows him to apprehend him, only for Inba to beat him up badly and leave him with a broken arm. After staying by his side until his recovery, Arjun changes his mind and joins hands with Michael to contest in elections. Inba later kills Guna when he finds out that he had been instructed by Selvanayagam to take him out due to Inba leaving an eyewitness (Arjun) behind the bridge incident. He confronts Selvanayagam, who brainwashes him to work for him and orders him to kidnap Arjun, Suchi and Trilok. However, they escape with the help of Dilli, who has a change of heart after realizing that their profession was interfering with their personal lives, causing Sashi to leave Inba for her hometown. He convinces Inba, however to no avail and is killed by him when he aids Arjun's escape. While running, Arjun calls Michael for help, but Inba easily catches and beats him up. Michael arrives at the nick of time to rescue Arjun at the Napier Bridge. A fight ensues between the three men where Inba is overpowered by Michael, who spares him and leaves him for the police. Inba is handed to the police. Michael, Arjun, Suchi and Trilok win the four seats they had contested for and thus enter into politics.

Kannan as a villager (uncredited) Production A Still of the Napier Bridge where the film's climax was shot The film began pre-production in early 2003 in a typical manner adapted by the director, Mani Ratnam, who keeps his projects under wraps until completion. The director chose to make two different versions of the film as he did not want the film to be dubbed, explaining that the essence of the script would be lost if they had done so. The project was named Aayitha Ezhuthu after the last letter of the Tamil alphabet,http://www.thehindu.com/lf/2004/02/18/stories/2004021810140202.htm which is denoted by three dots in a triangle and the director revealed that the film was about three individuals. Early reports indicated that the film would be based on the 2000 neorealist Mexican film, Amores perros by Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, but eventually only the idea of hyperlink cinema was common in both films. However, Mani Ratnam revealed that the film was closer to Akira Kurosawa's 1950 Japanese film Rashomon as both films dealt with a cause-effect and a third-view called Rashomon effect. Suriya, who made his debut in the 1997 Mani Ratnam production Nerukku Ner, revealed that he agreed \\"blindly\\" to star in the film without even listening to the story or his character. The actor revealed in an interview about Mani Ratnam's choice that \\"when the master calls for the student you just say ‚Äúyes‚Äù.\\" Suriya stated that his character was based on a real person from Andhra Pradesh and to prepare, he read a lot of books and collected a lot of information before the shoot. Madhavan was signed on to appear in Mani Ratnam's fourth successive project after playing the lead roles in his Alaipayuthey (2000) and Kannathil Muthamittal (2002) as well as his 2001 production, Dumm Dumm Dumm. The actor bulked up and sported a shaven look for the first time in his career to resemble his character of a ruffian. Initially actor Vikram was considered to do the role of Madhavan, but unable to sign in due to his other commitments. For a third lead role, Mani Ratnam called Srikanth and requested him to audition for the project in December 2002. The actor had scored back-to-back successes in his first two films, Roja Koottam and April Madhathil, and was subsequently selected to be a part of the film. However, the actor soon after suffered an injury and was unable to commit to the dates Mani Ratnam suggested. Shaam was next approached for the role of Arjun, but date clashes with Iyarkai, meant that he was unable to sign the project. Karthi, the brother of Suriya, was then offered the role but declined the offer to make his debut and worked as an assistant director on the film because he wanted to become a film director and preferred directing to acting. Siddharth, who had previously apprenticed as an assistant director under Mani Ratnam in Kannathil Muthamittal before his making his acting debut in Shankar's Boys, was subsequently signed on for the film. Prior to release, Siddharth felt he was cast as he \\"looked, talked and behaved like Arjun\\" and mentioned that the sync sound technique used worked in favour of him as he was an experienced theatre actor. Veteran director Bharathiraja was signed on to play a politician in the film, while Sriman and Janagaraj were given supporting roles. Leading Kannada actor Sudeep was also initially slated to form a part of the cast after meeting Mani Ratnam for the script discussion, but was ultimately discarded from the film. Krishna and Suchitra, a singer and radio jockey, also were chosen to play the roles of student leaders in the film. Malayalam actress Meera Jasmine was signed on to play a slum dweller in the film portraying Madhavan's wife and it was reported that she spent hours perfecting her Tamil for the film, trying to get rid of her native Malayalam accent to adapt to the sound sync technique used. Relative newcomer Trisha was also signed on to play a youngster in the film and dubbed for her own voice for the first time. Initially Simran was signed on to play the roles of Geetanjali in both versions, but opted out after she began to have problems speaking Tamil as the sound for the film was recorded live. Esha Deol, daughter of actress Hema Malini, was then selected to play the role in the Tamil version of the film after Suhasini enquired whether she could speak Tamil. After finishing her work in Aaytha Ezhuthu, Deol was signed on for the Hindi version of the film too after Simran also opted out of that role and thus Deol became the only common leading actor between the versions. To prepare for her role, Deol worked on certain pronunciations of Iyer Tamil with Mani Ratnam's assistant Kannan mentoring her progress. It was also reported that actress Nadhiya had signed the film and would make a comeback to films after a ten-year sabbatical, but did not eventually form a part of the final cast.https://web.archive.org/web/20040702154359/http://chennaionline.com/reeltalk/01reeltalk29th.asp The director initially opted against using songs in the film, but wanted to create an album with A. R. Rahman for the project. However, after the songs were recorded, Mani Ratnam had a change of heart and chose to include them. For the art direction in the film, Sabu Cyril studied each character in depth, giving them a distinct colour, mood and background to suit their temperament. For Michael's house in the film, Cyril followed the arrangement in his own house and used some his own photographs for decorations. He also expressed that he had great difficulty in re-creating the streets of Kolkata for the Hindi version of the film in Chennai. G. Ramesh was selected to be the hairdresser for the three lead actors in the film. The scene filmed at Napier Bridge in Chennai was canned in early December 2003, causing severe traffic and congestion in the area. Mani Ratnam began the Tamil version after Vivek Oberoi suffered an injury during the making of Yuva, giving him time to extract more out his actors in the Tamil version. Production work for the film began in September 2003, with the technical crew who were mostly from the Tamil film industry including the production house were part of the Hindi version and were retained for the Tamil scenes. The Tamil version finished subsequently much earlier than the Hindi version. Some scenes featuring Suriya were also shot at the University of Madras, Mani Ratnam's alma mater. Release The satellite rights of the film's Tamil Version were sold to Kalaignar TV.https://www.exchange4media.com/TV/DMK-backed-Kalaignar-TV-goes- on-air;-news-channel-on-the-cards_27787.html Reviews Aayutha Ezuthu received positive reviews.

The laws were made against Chinese Indonesians. Most of these laws are revoked following Reformation era under president Abdurrahman Wahid. 1950 In the early 1950s the Government of Indonesia implemented the Benteng program (fortress program), under which only Native Indonesians (pribumi) were allowed to have licenses to import certain items. This rule gave rise to the term \\"Ali Baba\\", referring to illicit co-operation between Chinese businessmen and native Indonesians who had connections in the government bureaucracy. Presidential Regulation 10 of 1959 Presidential Regulation 10 of 1959 () was a law directive issued by Indonesian government and signed by Minister of Trade, Rachmat Mujomisero. The law prohibited foreign nationals from doing retail business in rural areas and required them to transfer their businesses to Indonesian nationals by 1 January 1960 or relocate to urban areas. This directive was approved by President Sukarno. The rule became controversial since its implementation resulting in several people being killed in West Java (also known as racial riot of Cibadak) and triggered a huge exodus of Chinese Indonesians back to China. Although the regulation merely mentioned that only \\"foreign citizens\\" were required to do the relocation and closure of business, the law affected many Chinese nationals and Chinese Indonesians. From the 86,690 foreign business retailer listed, about 90 percent of these were Chinese. =Background= Right after the Indonesian Independence in 1945, the Indonesian people was overwhelmed by the euphoria of \\"freedom\\" and took over a lot of foreign companies: this action was referred to as \\"Anti-Dutch sentiment\\". Among others, one was a Dutch company Koninklijke Paketvaart- Maatschappij (KPM), a company serving in sea transportation from Netherlands to Indonesia. Marhaen, a labour group that later on become a political party, took over this company. Other foreign capital seized were oil fields, by the oil labourers claiming themselves as \\"Laskar Minyak\\" (The Oil Defenders). After a while, the Government of Indonesia realised that unskilled and inexperienced Indonesians were unable to run the company. The Indonesians, referred to as Kaum pribumi, also did not have enough capital, and it was almost impossible to compete with foreign investment and the Chinese capital (before independence, the ethnic Chinese had more chances to do business from colonialist ruler). These companies suffer losses after the seizure. As a solution, the Government of Indonesia signed an agreement during Dutch- Indonesian Round Table Conference in Den Haag, Netherlands, which stated that the government of Indonesia would return all seized foreign investment assets to its previous owner. In return, to strengthen up the weak Indonesians (pribumi), the Government of Indonesia had the right to issue a law or directive to protect the national interest and those who were \\"economically feeble\\". On 19 March 1956, during Indonesian National Importer Congress in Surabaya (Kongres Importir Nasional Indonesia), Asaat Datuk Mudo made an opening oration that the Chinese had become monopolistic in doing their business by closing all possible entry routes for Indonesian nationals to join the trade market. As a closing statement, Assat also added that he believes this was the time to have a special economy initiative to protect Indonesian (pribumi). Asaat's speech became the beginning of \\"Asaat movement\\" or \\"Pro Indonesian (term used was for Indonesian was Pribumi) movement\\" and had a huge impact on the following rules favouring it. In November 1959, PP Nomor 10 Tahun 1959 was issued. In the 1950s, almost all retail stores in Indonesia were owned by Chinese or Chinese-Indonesians from grocery stores, hardware stores and even restaurants. Alwi Sahab, a Betawi culture expert stated that during his youth in Kwitang, Central Jakarta, the economic centre was in Jakarta fully dependent on the Chinese or Chinese Indonesian businessman. =Implementation, protest and counter action= Tempo magazine investigation published in year 2009 mentioned that during the implementation, the law affected 86,690 foreign retailers listed (90 percent Chinese) to about 500,000 were affected. However, Waspada Daily in their commemorative anniversary published their story printed in the 1960s during the happening, and it had a different number, according to Waspada Daily only about 25,000 small groceries booths by foreign retailers (mainly) Chinese affected by PP No. 10. Berita Peristiwa 60 Tahun Waspada: Penduduk Cina Dipulangkan (1960). PP No.10 dan Masalah Pemulangan Hoakiao Hal 39 The sanctions specified in the directive were only property confiscation (all items had to be given to Koperasi), fines, and forced relocation, but, in practice, there were also some offenders executed (Cimahi and Cibadak, West Java). \\"Sistem Nilai Kita Sudah Dirusak.\\" Indonesia Media online. September 2000. Accessed 25 February 2008. In some places, the law was enforced by the military. The military shot dead two Chinese women, which triggered a riot in Cimahi, Jawa Barat. It was also noted that the Chinese were forced to leave their home and properties. However, while, nationwide, the implementation of this law went smoothly, in some places like Bandung and Medan, there were Chinese merchants trying to stop the implementation of PP 10 by hiding or emptying the stores and piling the goods in warehouses, causing price increases of main food materials. Specially, after another government directive was issued about price adjustments, according to the Attorney General Special Instruction, in some areas, including North Sumatra, Economic Survaillance Teams were formed to watch certain issues in economy such as stabilising prices and making appropriate actions to everyone who withhold the food program implemented by the government. The Economic Surveillance Team in North Sumatra manage to secure 200 warehouses in Medan consisting of food materials, the merchants being punished by imprisonment. The law was meant to strengthen the national economy in Indonesia, yet this law resulted in a tense diplomatic relation between Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China (PRC). During a meeting between State Minister Subandrio and Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia (Huang Chen) in Jakarta, the PRC insisted that PP No. 10 should be reviewed, and the request was denied. Later on during a parliamentary hearing, State Minister Subandrio restated that there is no element of anti-Chinese related in the implementation of PP No. 10, the law being solely the beginning of nationalisation and socialisation in the Indonesian economy, and as part of the Indonesian revolution movement. On the nationalisation part, PP No. 10 stated that foreign retailers must be closed outside ibukota kabupaten and the merchant had to live only in his property, which was not allowed to conduct any business activities. Foreigners had to close their business at the latest on 1 January 1960 and give all their assets to Koperasi. The Government of PRC was upset. On 10 December 1959, Peking radio announced a campaign for Chinese citizen to return to \\"The Warmth of Motherland\\". The PRC Embassy in Jakarta soon listed all Chinese citizens interested in returning to China. About 199,000 applied, but only 102,000 managed to be placed in a ship sent by the PRC government. Arsip. Majalah Tempo 24 November 1990 dimuat pada Majalah Tempo edisi 13-19 Agustus 2007. The tension between PRC Government and Government of Indonesia reduced after PRC Prime Minister Zhou Enlai met President Sukarno. =Pro and cons= According to Mestika Zed from Andalas University, Padang, West Sumatera, Asaat Datuk Mudo was a real nationalist and always reacted according to facts and reality. The economy of pribumi (Native Indonesian) after independence was weak with no one defending them. Meanwhile, even during Dutch Imperialism, the Chinese always had a better economy than the pribumi. After Indonesian independence, they took over the economy from small, middle, and large scale. Assaat's ideas were later adopted by Tunku Abdul Rahman and Mahathir Mohamad as the Malaysian economy policy to protect the majority and indigenous ethnic Malay in Malaysia, which was then faced with a similar economic situation. From historical perspective, even in the beginning of Indonesian Independence the Chinese was always been suspected because they are divided into three groups: \\"Pro-Dutch\\", \\"Pro-Chinese Government\\", and \\"Pro-Indonesian Nationalist Movement\\". There are also Indonesian Chinese who agree that it was needed to do an assimilation or pribumization of Indonesian Chinese (also known as the Tionghoa) through religion (Islam and PITI) as Moslem organization. They have given their support and chances to Chinese-Indonesians to prove that they want to become a \\"good Indonesian citizen\\". There is also a lot of co-operation between the Chinese and the Indonesians noted during Indonesian national movement. Even some of the prominent Chinese figures were trying hard to make the Chinese- Indonesian return to Indonesia. Yap Thiam Hien, a Chinese-Indonesian lawyer, famous for his Indonesian nationalist idealism, established Baperki (Indonesian Citizenship Discussion Body) in 1954. The organization's purpose was to make Chinese-Indonesians willing to be Indonesian citizens, specially to those that take the Indonesian side, as opposed to the Dutch and the Chinese Government. This body also gave a lot of contribution in proposing the Indonesian Citizenship Law 1958, which was implemented on the beginning of 1960. The discriminative rule also noted as an attempt to maintain politics of divide and conquer. Leo Suryadinata, a Chinese-Indonesian now teaching in National University of Singapore (NUS), thinks that both fortress rules or PP 10/ 1959 is a beginning anti-Chinese movement in Indonesia. According to Suryadinata, during colonialism by the Dutch, the Chinese-Indonesians were mostly small retailers, but after Indonesian independence, their position was strengthened, which is why pribumi think that they cannot compete and would like to take over the power by using the government. Cabinet Presidium Decision 127 of 1966 Cabinet Presidium Decision 127 of 1966 (', 127/U/Kep/12/1966) was an Indonesian law passed in 1966 that suggested Indonesian-sounding names to be adopted by Indonesian Chinese. It was considered to be part of the anti-Chinese legislation in Indonesia. The resident Chinese community in Indonesia resented it because it forced them to lose traditional family names. However, some people thwarted the government efforts to some degree by incorporating their Chinese name into their new Indonesian name. For example, the Chinese family name \\"Tan\\" was easily embedded in the Indonesian name \\"Sutanto\\". Presidential Decision 240 of 1967 Presidential Decision 240 of 1967 (', Keppres No. 240/1867) mandated assimilation of \\"foreigners\\" and supported a previous directive, 127/U/Kep/12/1966, for Indonesian Chinese to adopt Indonesian-sounding names. Presidential Instruction 14 of 1967 Presidential Instruction No. 14/1967 (Inpress No. 14/1967) on Chinese Religion, Beliefs, and Traditions effectively banned any Chinese literature and cultures in Indonesia, including the prohibition of Chinese characters. Although Chinese names were not explicitly mentioned, \\"newly naturalized\\" Indonesian Chinese were strongly advised to adopt non-Chinese names. (Annulled by former president Abdurrahman Wahid in Keppres No. 6/2000;Keputusan Presiden Republik Indonesia Nomor 6 Tahun 2000 annulment supported by former president Megawati Sukarnoputri in Keppres No 19/2002 by declaring Chinese New Year as national holiday.) 1967 Laws affecting Chinese Indonesians proliferated under the New Order regime under former President Suharto's reign. Suharto was a strong advocate for Chinese assimilation rather than integration. As part of 1967's 'Basic Policy for the Solution of the Chinese Problem' and other measures, only one Chinese-language newspaper was allowed to continue, all Chinese religious expressions had to be confined to their homes, Chinese-language schools were phased out, Chinese script in public places was banned, and Chinese were pushed to take on Indonesian-sounding names. Most of this legislation were revoked following Suharto's fall from power in 1998. Ampera Cabinet Presidium Circular 6 of 1967 Ampera Cabinet Presidium Circular 6 of 1967 () was released on 28 June 1967. One of the points of contention is the selection of a proper term to describe Indonesian residents of Chinese descent. Accompanying explanatory text to Article 26 of the 1945 Constitution used the term Tionghoa to describe this group. Penjelasan Undang-Undang Dasar Republik Indonesia 1945. In 1948, the Communist Party of Indonesia began using Tionghoa in its terminology, prompting the beginning of an unofficial ban on its use. By 1967, a cabinet circular enforced the use of the term Cina over Tionghoa and Tiongkok. Surat Edaran Presidium Kabinet Ampera Nomor 06 Tahun 1967. Other examples * Cabinet Presidium Instruction No. 37/U/IN/6/1967, prohibiting further residency or work permits to new Chinese immigrants, their wives, or children; freezing any capital raised by \\"foreigners\\" in Indonesia; closure of \\"foreign\\" schools except for diplomatic corps and their families; requiaring the number of Indonesian students to be the majority and in proportion to \\"foreigners\\" in any state schools; and making implementation of the \\"Chinese issue\\" be the responsibility of the minister for political affairs. * Resolution of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly No. 32, 1966 (TAP MPRS No. 32/1966), effectively banning the use of Chinese characters in newspapers and magazines. * Home Affairs Ministry No. 455.2-360/1988 on Regulation of Temples, effectively and severely restricting building or repairing Chinese temples. * Circular of the Director General for Press and Graphics Guidance in the Ministry of Information No. 02/SE/Ditjen-PPGK/1988, further restricting the usage of Chinese language and/or characters. * Instruction of the Ministry of Home Affairs No. X01/1977 on Implementing Instructions for Population Registration and the confidential instructions No.3.462/1.755.6 of the Jakarta government 28 January 1980, both authorising special codes in national identification cards to indicate ethnic Chinese origin, the code being A01 * Cabinet Presidium Circular SE-06/Pres-Kab/6/1967 on Changing the Term China and Chinese, requiring the usage of the term \\"Cina\\" (considered a derogatory term by many Chinese Indonesians) instead of \\"Tionghoa\\" or \\"Tiongkok\\" (used by ethnic Chinese themselves). * the status of Confucianism as one of Indonesia's six official religions was revoked. In 1978, the Minister of Home Affairs issued a directive that there were only five religions, excluding Confucianism. On 27 January 1979, a presidential cabinet meeting took place and it firmly decided that Confucianism was not a religion. Another directive from Minister of Home Affairs was issued in 1990 re-iterating about there being only five official religions in Indonesia. Anomalies and exceptions There are exceptions to laws and regulations that ban the use of Mandarin. The use of Mandarin in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, for example, is not prohibited, since legal proceedings related to this case have been suspended after lobbying made to the Attorney General (Jaksa Agung) of Indonesia by INI (Ikatan Naturopatis Indonesia). Current practice During his tenure as president, Abdurrahman Wahid ended restrictions on Chinese culture and language, and made Chinese New Year a national holiday. Today, Indonesian Chinese hold the same rights as other ethnic groups. They can practice their culture throughout their daily lives, with the use of the Chinese language no longer being forbidden. Metro TV became the first to air its news in Chinese. Chinese schools are now able to be established as either International or \\"National- plus\\" schools. Mandarin Chinese is also taught as an optional extracurricular subject in many schools.

A foundry is a factory that produces metal castings. Metals are cast into shapes by melting them into a liquid, pouring the metal into a mold, and removing the mold material after the metal has solidified as it cools. The most common metals processed are aluminium and cast iron. However, other metals, such as bronze, brass, steel, magnesium, and zinc, are also used to produce castings in foundries. In this process, parts of desired shapes and sizes can be formed. Process A Foundryman, pictured by Daniel A. Wehrschmidt in 1899. In metalworking, casting involves pouring liquid metal into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowing it to cool and solidify. The solidified part is also known as a casting, which is ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process. Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods., p. 277. =Melting= Melting metal in a crucible for casting A metal die casting robot in an industrial foundry Melting is performed in a furnace. Virgin material, external scrap, internal scrap, and alloying elements are used to charge the furnace. Virgin material refers to commercially pure forms of the primary metal used to form a particular alloy. Alloying elements are either pure forms of an alloying element, like electrolytic nickel, or alloys of limited composition, such as ferroalloys or master alloys. External scrap is material from other forming processes such as punching, forging, or machining. Internal scrap consists of gates, risers, defective castings, and other extraneous metal oddments produced within the facility. The process includes melting the charge, refining the melt, adjusting the melt chemistry and tapping into a transport vessel. Refining is done to remove harmful gases and elements from the molten metal to avoid casting defects. Material is added during the melting process to bring the final chemistry within a specific range specified by industry and/or internal standards. Certain fluxes may be used to separate the metal from slag and/or dross and degassers are used to remove dissolved gas from metals that readily dissolve in gasses. During the tap, final chemistry adjustments are made. Furnace Several specialised furnaces are used to heat the metal. Furnaces are refractory-lined vessels that contain the material to be melted and provide the energy to melt it. Modern furnace types include electric arc furnaces (EAF), induction furnaces, cupolas, reverberatory, and crucible furnaces. Furnace choice is dependent on the alloy system quantities produced. For ferrous materials EAFs, cupolas, and induction furnaces are commonly used. Reverberatory and crucible furnaces are common for producing aluminium, bronze, and brass castings. Furnace design is a complex process, and the design can be optimized based on multiple factors. Furnaces in foundries can be any size, ranging from small ones used to melt precious metals to furnaces weighing several tons, designed to melt hundreds of pounds of scrap at one time. They are designed according to the type of metals that are to be melted. Furnaces must also be designed based on the fuel being used to produce the desired temperature. For low temperature melting point alloys, such as zinc or tin, melting furnaces may reach around . Electricity, propane, or natural gas are usually used to achieve these temperatures. For high melting point alloys such as steel or nickel-based alloys, the furnace must be designed for temperatures over . The fuel used to reach these high temperatures can be electricity (as employed in electric arc furnaces) or coke. The majority of foundries specialize in a particular metal and have furnaces dedicated to these metals. For example, an iron foundry (for cast iron) may use a cupola, induction furnace, or EAF, while a steel foundry will use an EAF or induction furnace. Bronze or brass foundries use crucible furnaces or induction furnaces. Most aluminium foundries use either electric resistance or gas heated crucible furnaces or reverberatory furnaces. =Degassing= Degassing is a process that may be required to reduce the amount of hydrogen present in a batch of molten metal. Gases can form in metal castings in one of two ways: # by physical entrapment during the casting process or # by chemical reaction in the cast material. Hydrogen is a common contaminant for most cast metals. It forms as a result of material reactions or from water vapor or machine lubricants. If the hydrogen concentration in the melt is too high, the resulting casting will be porous; the hydrogen will exit the molten solution, leaving minuscule air pockets, as the metal cools and solidifies. Porosity often seriously deteriorates the mechanical properties of the metal. An efficient way of removing hydrogen from the melt is to bubble a dry, insoluble gas through the melt by purging or agitation. When the bubbles go up in the melt, they catch the dissolved hydrogen and bring it to the surface. Chlorine, nitrogen, helium and argon are often used to degas non-ferrous metals. Carbon monoxide is typically used for iron and steel. There are various types of equipment that can measure the presence of hydrogen. Alternatively, the presence of hydrogen can be measured by determining the density of a metal sample. In cases where porosity still remains present after the degassing process, porosity sealing can be accomplished through a process called metal impregnating. =Mold making= In the casting process, a pattern is made in the shape of the desired part. Simple designs can be made in a single piece or solid pattern. More complex designs are made in two parts, called split patterns. A split pattern has a top or upper section, called a cope, and a bottom or lower section called a drag. Both solid and split patterns can have cores inserted to complete the final part shape. Cores are used to create hollow areas in the mold that would otherwise be impossible to achieve. Where the cope and drag separates is called the parting line. When making a pattern it is best to taper the edges so that the pattern can be removed without breaking the mold. This is called draft. The opposite of draft is an undercut where there is part of the pattern under the mold material, making it impossible to remove the pattern without damaging the mold. The pattern is made of wax, wood, plastic, or metal. The molds are constructed by several different processes dependent upon the type of foundry, metal to be poured, quantity of parts to be produced, size of the casting, and complexity of the casting. These mold processes include: *Sand casting ‚Äî Green or resin bonded sand mold. *Lost-foam casting ‚Äî Polystyrene pattern with a mixture of ceramic and sand mold. *Investment casting ‚Äî Wax or similar sacrificial pattern with a ceramic mold. *Ceramic mold casting ‚Äî Plaster mold. *V-process casting ‚Äî Vacuum with thermoformed plastic to form sand molds. No moisture, clay or resin required. *Die casting ‚Äî Metal mold. *Billet (ingot) casting ‚Äî Simple mold for producing ingots of metal, normally for use in other foundries. *Loam molding - a built up mold used for casting large objects, such as cannon, steam engine cylinders, and bells. =Pouring= Bronze poured from a crucible into a mold, using the lost-wax casting process In a foundry, molten metal is poured into molds. Pouring can be accomplished with gravity, or it may be assisted with a vacuum or pressurized gas. Many modern foundries use robots or automatic pouring machines to pour molten metal. Traditionally, molds were poured by hand using ladles. =Shakeout= The solidified metal component is then removed from its mold. Where the mold is sand based, this can be done by shaking or tumbling. This frees the casting from the sand, which is still attached to the metal runners and gates ‚Äî which are the channels through which the molten metal traveled to reach the component itself. =Degating= Degating is the removal of the heads, runners, gates, and risers from the casting. Runners, gates, and risers may be removed using cutting torches, bandsaws, or ceramic cutoff blades. For some metal types, and with some gating system designs, the sprue, runners, and gates can be removed by breaking them away from the casting with a sledge hammer or specially designed knockout machinery. Risers must usually be removed using a cutting method (see above) but some newer methods of riser removal use knockoff machinery with special designs incorporated into the riser neck geometry that allow the riser to break off at the right place. The gating system required to produce castings in a mold yields leftover metal ‚Äî including heads, risers, and sprue (sometimes collectively called sprue) ‚Äî that can exceed 50% of the metal required to pour a full mold. Since this metal must be remelted as salvage, the yield of a particular gating configuration becomes an important economic consideration when designing various gating schemes, to minimize the cost of excess sprue, and thus overall melting costs. =Heat treating= Heat treating is a group of industrial and metalworking processes used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material. The most common application is metallurgical. Heat treatments are also used in the manufacture of many other materials, such as glass. Heat treatment involves the use of heating or chilling, normally to extreme temperatures, to achieve a desired result such as hardening or softening of a material. Heat treatment techniques include annealing, case hardening, precipitation strengthening, tempering, and quenching. Although the term \\"heat treatment\\" applies only to processes where the heating and cooling are done for the specific purpose of altering properties intentionally, heating and cooling often occur incidentally during other manufacturing processes such as hot forming or welding. =Surface cleaning= After degating and heat treating, sand or other molding media may remain adhered to the casting. To remove any mold remnants, the surface is cleaned using a blasting process. This means a granular media will be propelled against the surface of the casting to mechanically knock away the adhering sand. The media may be blown with compressed air, or may be hurled using a shot wheel. The cleaning media strikes the casting surface at high velocity to dislodge the mold remnants (for example, sand, slag) from the casting surface. Numerous materials may be used to clean cast surfaces, including steel, iron, other metal alloys, aluminium oxides, glass beads, walnut shells, baking powder, and many others. The blasting media is selected to develop the color and reflectance of the cast surface. Terms used to describe this process include cleaning, bead blasting, and sand blasting. Shot peening may be used to further work-harden and finish the surface. =Finishing= Modern foundry (circa 2000) The final step in the process of casting usually involves grinding, sanding, or machining the component in order to achieve the desired dimensional accuracies, physical shape, and surface finish. Removing the remaining gate material, called a gate stub, is usually done using a grinder or sander. These processes are used because their material removal rates are slow enough to control the amount of material being removed. These steps are done prior to any final machining. After grinding, any surfaces that require tight dimensional control are machined. Many castings are machined in CNC milling centers. The reason for this is that these processes have better dimensional capability and repeatability than many casting processes. However, it is not uncommon today for castings to be used without machining. A few foundries provide other services before shipping cast products to their customers. It is common to paint castings to prevent corrosion and improve visual appeal. Some foundries assemble castings into complete machines or sub-assemblies. Other foundries weld multiple castings or wrought metals together to form a finished product. More and more, finishing processes are being performed by robotic machines, which eliminate the need for a human to physically grind or break parting lines, gating material, or feeders. Machines can reduce risk of injury to workers and lower costs for consumables ‚Äî while also increasing productivity.

Biography = Early life and career = Born in Hanceville, Alabama, Staton and her sister Maggie were sent to Nashville, Tennessee at around age 11 or 12 for school. While attending Jewell Christian Academy, Staton's vocal abilities were quickly noticed by her peers and the school's pastor. Amazed by her voice, the pastor paired Staton and her sister with a third girl, Naomi Harrison, and they formed the Jewell Gospel Trio. As teenagers, the group toured the traditional gospel circuit during the 1950s with the Soul Stirrers, C. L. Franklin and Mahalia Jackson.from an interview on episode 191 of the Americana Music Show, published May 12, 2014. They recorded several sides for Nashbro, Apollo and Savoy Records between 1953 and 1963. Solo career Staton onstage at Guilfest 2012. In 1968, Staton was introduced to Rick Hall by Clarence Carter and launched her solo career as a Southern soul stylist, garnering 16 R&B; hits for Rick Hall's Fame Studios and gaining the title of \\"First Lady of Southern Soul\\" for her Grammy-nominated R&B; renditions of the songs \\"Stand by Your Man\\" and \\"In the Ghetto\\". Staton appeared on the September 23, 1972, edition (Season 2, Episode 1) of Soul Train. In 1976, Staton began collaborating with producer David Crawford on disco songs such as \\"Young Hearts Run Free\\", which reached No. 1 on the US R&B; charts, No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart and went Top 20 on the Pop Hot 100 during the summer of 1976. It was remixed and re-released in 1986, reaching the UK Top 50. Follow up song \\"Destiny\\" hit the Top 50 in the UK. and her version of \\"Nights on Broadway\\" hit the UK Top 10 in 1977;. In 1978, Staton scored another Top 50 hit in the UK with \\"Honest I Do Love You\\". In 1979 from her album Chance, Staton released the single \\"When You Wake Up Tomorrow\\" (co- written by Patrick Adams and Wayne K. Garfield) and the title song \\"Chance\\", a top 20 R&B; charted record. Other dance club chart hits included \\"When You Wake Up Tomorrow\\" and \\"Victim\\". In 1982, Staton again hit the UK chart with a version of Elvis Presley's \\"Suspicious Minds\\". In 1996, singer Kym Mazelle recorded \\"Young Hearts Run Free\\" for the film adaption Romeo + Juliet of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Kym Mazelle's cover of \\"Young Hearts Run Free\\" for the movie Romeo and Juliet. In 1982, Staton returned to gospel music. Staton and her then-husband, John Sussewell, founded Beracah Ministries in Atlanta, Georgia, with help from Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker's PTL Ministries. Staton has since recorded twelve gospel albums, two of which received Grammy Award nominations. Staton appears on the United Nations Register of Entertainers, Actors And Others Who Have Performed in Apartheid South Africa. =Later and present= In 1991, Staton returned to UK popular charts by lending her vocals to the Source's British hit, \\"You Got the Love\\". Staton signed with Intersound Records in 1995. In 2000, she released her eleventh album, Here's a Blessing. In 2004, the British record label Honest Jon's released a compilation album of her country-soul work from the late 1960s and early 1970s, the self-titled Candi Staton. Staton followed it up with a secular project in 2006 entitled His Hands, produced by Mark Nevers of Lambchop and with the title track written by Will Oldham. Two of Staton's children, Cassandra Williams-Hightower (background vocals) and Marcus Williams (drums), joined her on the album. A second studio album for Honest Jon's, titled Who's Hurting Now?, appeared in 2009. She and Rick Hall reunited to make a half dozen more tracks for Staton's 2014 southern soul album, Life Happens. The lead Americana radio single, \\"I Ain't Easy to Love\\", featured Jason Isbell and John Paul White (formerly of The Civil Wars). The trio performed the track on The Late Show with David Letterman. Staton's television show New Direction aired on TBN. Staton has also made appearances on the Praise the Lord telecast with the late Paul Crouch and his late wife Jan Crouch, as well as regularly performing on Robert Tilton's Success-N-Life show.

Following Sweden's independence, similar documents were also issued by its kings. In many ways it is a Scandinavian parallel to the English Magna Carta.  History  The haandf√¶stning was the result of the strength of the power of the nobility. The first Danish king who was forced to sign this kind of charter was King Eric V in 1282. It was used as a regular coronation charter for the first time in 1320. Between 1440 and 1648 it was a normal condition for the recognition of a new king. When absolute monarchy was introduced in 1660 the last haandf√¶stning was mortified. Unlike in England there was no permanent charter to sign; every new king had to accept a new one that applied to his own reign. On the other hand, all haandf√¶stninger were based on the same model. The king had to promise that he would rule as a just king; that he would co-operate with the nobility; that he would never imprison any free man; that all leading offices (what one would today call \\"cabinet minister posts\\") and all local administration would be filled only by noblemen; and that questions of war and peace depended on the acceptance of the nobility. The charters did not necessarily transform the kings into puppets; most of them were able to create a solid base of power during their reign. And hardly any Danish king of the period totally kept the rules of the h√•ndf√¶stning. The severity of the demands of the nobility also wavered from time to time.  End of the era  Absolutism was underpinned by a written constitution for the first time in Europe in 1665 Kongeloven (\\"King's Law\\") of Denmark-Norway, which ordered that the Monarch \\"shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, neither in spiritual nor temporal matters, except God alone\\".A partial English translation of the law can be found in Ernst Ekman, \\"The Danish Royal Law of 1665\\" pp. 102-107 in: The Journal of Modern History, 1957, vol. 2. This law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power. Most important was the abolition of the Council of the Realm.  Legacy  Some modern historians have regarded the haandf√¶stninger as (primitive) predecessors of the modern constitutions. This might be true as for the limitations of the royal power but it would not be fair to call them real democratic constitutions. First of all their purpose seems to have been to secure the power of the nobility and they expressly tried to keep commoners and other people of \\"low birth\\" away from any kind of political influence. Unlike their English parallel they therefore do not seem to have inspired any kind of modern Danish constitutional theory.

It was built on the former site of Manningham Hall using a gift of ¬£40,000 donated by Samuel Lister and it is named after Edmund Cartwright. The gallery which opened in 1904 initially had a display of artworks loaned from other galleries and private collections until it was able to purchase a permanent collection of Victorian and Edwardian works using money raised by the 1904 Bradford Exhibition. Cartwright Hall stands in Lister Park and enjoys scenic views of the city. Cartwright Hall has been held to represent \\"Bradford Baroque\\", a style of architecture typical of Bradford. It is however designed by the same architects as Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum (Sir John W. Simpson and E.J. Milner Allen), also in the Baroque style. The purpose-built gallery is home to a collection of permanent works, from Old Masters to 20th- century British paintings and sculpture. Cartwright Hall also has a biennial open exhibition and contemporary and historical exhibitions by local, national and international artists. Since the mid 1980s the Bradford museum group has collected works that are associated with the cultural background of many post- war migrants to the Bradford area. Acquisitions include contemporary South Asian Art - Islamic calligraphy, phulkari style illustrated textiles and items of contemporary Sikh art, including a portrait of Guru Nanak. In 1983 Cartwright Hall was briefly used as part of the musical number 'every sperm is sacred' in the Monty Python film, The Meaning of Life. In 2003 an Unreal Tournament map was created featuring the inside of the hall as part of a contest for PC Format Magazine.

Structurally, it is a bipyridine N-oxide compound somewhat related to the herbicide diquat. History Orellanine first came to people's attention in 1957 when there was a mass poisoning of 135 people in Bydgoszcz, Poland, which resulted in 19 deaths. Orellanine comes from a class of mushrooms that fall under the genus Cortinarius. Although not all the species in this genus are poisonous/contain orellanine, it was found that Cortinarius orellanus, rubellus, henrici, rainerensis and bruneofulvus contain orellanine. Poisonings pertaining to these mushrooms were predominately in Europe where foraging was a major source of nourishment, although there are cases of orellanine poisoning in North America as well. Orellanine has been found to cause acute kidney injury and there are many cases where people have taken this mushroom mistaking it for causing hallucinogenic effects. It wasn't until 1962 until the first isolation of orellanine was done. The first methanolic extraction and isolation of orellanine was done by Stanis≈Çaw Grzymala and isolated from the mushroom Cortinarius orellanus. Along with the isolation of orellanine, Grzymala was also able to demonstrate the nephrotoxicity of Cortinarius orellanus and determine various physical and chemical properties of orellanine. He found that the toxicity of the mushrooms was linked to delayed and acute kidney injury, as well as when the isolated white crystalline substance was heated above 150 ÃäC it began to slowly decompose. After this first isolation of orellanine, the structure of orellanine was first discovered by Antkowiak and Gessner in 1979. Orellanine‚Äôs structure was found to be 3,3',4,4'-tetrahydroxy- 2,2'-bipyridine-l,l'-dioxide. Antkowiak and Gessner were also able to determine that orellanine was the mono-N-oxide of orelline, which was the decomposition product of orellanine. It was also found that orelline was non-toxic. The first successful synthesis of orellanine was done in 1985. Tiecco, M. et. Al. completed a total synthesis of orellanine using commercially available 3-hydroxypyridine. After the first successful synthesis, the structure was confirmed in 1987 by Cohen-Addad et al. in 1987 by X-ray crystallography. Synthesis The chemical constitution of orellanine remained unknown until the Polish chemists Antkowiak and Gessner in the last half of the 1970s discovered that it was a bipyridine dioxide. Orellanine undergoes tautomerization, and the more stable tautomer is the amine oxide form. An interesting feature of orellanine is its ability to bind aluminium ions to form chelation complexes. Orellanine tautomerization The first synthesis of orellanine was done in 1985 and Tiecco, M. et. Al. were able to synthesize orellaine from 3-hydroxy pyridine. This synthesis was completed in 8 steps with a 79-87% yield. When synthesized the two pyridyl rings are nearly perpendicular and the molecule is chiral. When it is isolated from the mushroom, it is an optically inactive racemic mixture. Other synthetic strategies have also been attempted. For example, orellanine was also synthesized in 9 steps by Dehmlow and Schulz in 1985 using 3-aminopyridine and the desired product was synthesized with 30% yield. In the synthesis done by Tiecco, M. et al. can be seen in the scheme below. In the first step, 3-hydroxy pyridine was first treated with bromine in an alkaline solution to obtain 2. The product of that step was then subjected to O-alkylation using DMF as a solvent to obtain 3. 3 was the oxidized with m-chloroperbenzoic acid in chloroform to give 4. That product was then nitrated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid to obtain a mixture of 5 and 6. These two molecules were separated by combining the mixture of products with water. 5 is insoluble in water, whereas 6 is soluble in water. 6 was then subjected to sodium methoxide in methanol to obtain the other methoxy group seen in product 7 and 7 was deoxygenated using phosphorus tribromide to obtain 8. To obtain tetramethyl orelline, structure 9, triphenylphosphine, NiCl2¬∑6H2O, and zinc powder were used to conduct the homocoupling of halopyridines through the use of nickel-phosphine complexes. Once 8 with the bipyridyl structure had been obtained, the synthesis of orellanine could be conducted. The bipyridyl product from number 8 is then dealkylated with hydrobromic acid to give orelline, which was found to be a yellow crystalline solid (10). Orelline is then oxidized with hydrogen peroxide using heat to obtain the desired product, orellanine (11). This scheme describes the total synthesis of orellanine done by Tiecco, M., et al. in 1985. Another way to synthesize orellanine from 9 was to subject it to excess m-chloro perbenzoic acid in chloroform to obtain 12, tetramethyl orellanine. Tetramethyl orellaine was then demethylated using hydrobromic acid to yield orellanine. This scheme shows another alternative route for the synthesis of orellanine done by Tiecco, M., et al. in 1985. Toxicity Bipyridines with positively charged nitrogen atoms were already known to be poisonous before the structure of orellanine was elucidated. The herbicides paraquat and diquat are toxic not only to plants, but also to humans and livestock. Bipyridines with charged nitrogen atoms disrupt important redox reactions in organisms, 'stealing' one or two electrons and sometimes bypass the electrons into other, often undesirable, redox reactions. The terminal product can be peroxide or superoxide ions, the latter of which are harmful to the cells. It is likely that orellanine works in the same way, although the process that leads from disturbed redox reactions to serious clinical kidney damage has not been properly resolved. In humans, a characteristic of poisoning by the nephrotoxin orellanine is the long latency; the first symptoms usually do not appear until 2‚Äì3 days after ingestion and can in some cases take as long as 3 weeks. The first symptoms of orellanine poisoning are similar to the common flu (nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, headaches, myalgia, etc.), these symptoms are followed by early stages of kidney failure (immense thirst, frequent urination, pain on and around the kidneys) and eventually decreased or nonexistent urine output and other symptoms of kidney failure occur. If left untreated death will follow. The of orellanine in mice is 12 to 20 mg per kg body weight; this is the dose which leads to death within two weeks. From cases of orellanine-related mushroom poisoning in humans it seems that the lethal dose for humans is considerably lower. Treatment Although there is no known antidote against orellanine poisoning, early hospitalization can sometimes prevent serious injury and usually prevent death. Research is ongoing. Some treatments make use of anti-oxidant therapy and corticosteroids to help victims recover from their kidney failure.

The album was released in 1990. 10 peaked at No. 15 and spent four weeks in the UK Albums Chart. There was a big band sound to this album, possibly due to the production work of Roy Thomas Baker and the continued use of a horn section. One of the highlights was the cover version of Question Mark & the Mysterians' hit \\"96 Tears\\" (which reached No. 17 in the UK Singles Chart). Cornwell has expressed satisfaction with the way this album turned out, whereas the rest of the band, including live guitarist John Ellis, who joined the band on the next album, have all expressed negative feelings about 10. The album sleeve shows the members of the band dressed up as ten of the most notable world leaders of the time (l-r: Yasser Arafat, Rajiv Gandhi, Pope John Paul II, Mikhail Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher, George H.

A safari park is larger than a zoo and smaller than a game reserve. For example, African Lion Safari in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada is . For comparison, Lake Nakuru in the Great Rift Valley, Kenya, is , and a typical large game reserve is Tsavo East, also in Kenya, which encompasses . Many parks have conservation programmes with endangered animals like elephants, rhinos, giraffes, lions, tigers, cheetahs and wild dogs.  General overview of a safari park  The main attractions are frequently large animals from Sub-Saharan Africa which people can see in wildlife reserves such as giraffes, lions, white lions, rhinocerotes, elephants, hippopotamus, zebras, ostriches, buffalo, oryx, sometimes dromedary camels, pelicans, geese, ibis, geese, ankole cattle, cheetahs, hyenas, baboons, wild dogs, barbary sheep, addax, crowned cranes, egyptian geese, white storks, bongo, crocodiles (in a side paddock), nubian ibex, sitatunga, gemsbok and antelope (eland, lechwe, wildebeest, nyala, impala, waterbuck, sable antelope, kudu and roan antelope just to name a few). Also in the reserves are animals not from Africa: Asian species include gaur, nilgai, blackbuck, banteng, sambar deer, hog deer, yaks, tigers, white tigers, asian black bears, fallow deer, eld's deer, chital, barasingha, painted storks and bactrian camels, American Species include american black bears, brown bears, wolves, bison, elk, arctic wolves, llamas, guanacos, rheas and white-tailed deer, Australian species include Kangaroos, Wallabies and Emus, and European species include Bison, Brown Bears, Wolves, Fallow Deer, Red Deer and Moose. Most safari parks have a \\"walk-around\\" area with animals too small or too dangerous to be roaming freely in the reserves, like Tapir, Small Antelope, Squirrel Monkey, Penguins, Marmosets, Tamarins, Mongoose, Meerkats, Lemurs, Wallabies, Small Birds, Gorillas, Reptiles, Hornbills, Small Monkeys, Chimpanzee, capybara, llamas, emus, red pandas, snow leopards, otters and Warthogs. Some also have Children's Zoos, aquariums, butterfly houses and reptile and insect houses. Besides animals, in the walk-round area this is where public facilities like toilets, snack bars and cafes, play areas and sometimes amusement rides. There can be walk-through exhibits with animals like kangaroos, lemurs and wallabies. The Knowsley Safari in England keeps Amur Tigers and Giraffes in their walking area. Safari parks often have other associated tourist attractions: golf courses, carnival rides, cafes/restaurants, ridable miniature railways, boat trips where people could see animals in the water like sea lions, life-sized recreations of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, plant mazes, playgrounds, monorails, cable cars and gift shops. These are commonly found in the walk around area. On river safari areas, there can also be islands with primates, longleat keeps gorillas and colobus monkeys on their islands, which used to house chimpanzees and siamang gibbons and african lion safari in canada has black-and-white ruffed lemurs, ring-tailed lemurs, white-handed gibbons, siamang gibbons, colombian spider monkeys and black handed spider monkeys and african pink-backed pelicans and black swans in the waters.

History and List Of Parks Giraffes being fed by visitors in the West Midland Safari Park, England The predecessor of safari parks is Africa U.S.A. Park (1953‚Äì1961) in Florida.Life, Vol.49, No.5, August 1, 1960, pp.1,30. The first lion drive-through opened in 1963 in Tama Zoological Park in Tokyo. In double-glazed buses, visitors made a tour through a one-hectare enclosure with twelve African lions. The first drive-through safari park outside of Africa opened in 1966 at Longleat in Wiltshire, England.The lions and loins of Longleat The Sunday Times Retrieved February 18, 2011 Longleat, Windsor, Woburn and arguably the whole concept of safari parks were the brainchild of Jimmy Chipperfield (1912‚Äì1990), former co- director of Chipperfield's Circus, although a similar concept is explored as a plot device in Angus Wilson's \\"The Old Men at the Zoo\\" which was published five years before Chipperfield set up Longleat. Longleat's Marquess of Bath agreed to Chipperfield's proposition to fence off of his vast Wiltshire estate to house 50 lions. Knowsley, the Earl of Derby's estate outside Liverpool, and the Duke of Bedford's Woburn estate in Bedfordshire both established their own safari parks with Chiperfield's partnership. Another circus family, the Smart Brothers, joined the safari park business by opening a park at Windsor for visitors from London. The former Windsor Safari Park was in Berkshire, England, but closed in 1992 and has since been made into a Legoland. There is also Chipperfield's \\"Scotland Safari Park\\" established on Baronet Sir John Muir's estate at Blair Drummond near Stirling, and the American-run \\"West Midland Safari and Leisure Park\\" near Birmingham. One park along with Jimmy Chipperfield at Lambton Castle in the North East England has closed. Between 1967 and 1974, Lion Country Safari, Inc. opened 6 animal parks, one near each of the following American cities: West Palm Beach, Florida; Los Angeles, California; Grand Prairie, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Richmond, Virginia. The first park, in South Florida, is the only Lion Country Safari still in operation. Burgers' Zoo at Arnhem, Netherlands, opened a \\"safari park\\" in 1968 within a traditional zoo. In 1995, Burgers' Safari modified this to a walking safari with a board walk. Another safari park in the Netherlands is SafariparkBeekse Bergen. Most safari parks were established in a short period of ten years, between 1966 and 1975. *Europe **Belgium : Aywaille (Le Monde Sauvage, (1975) **Great Britain Longleat (1966), Windsor (1969‚Äì1992), Woburn (1970), Knowsley (1971), Lambton (Lion Park, 1972‚Äì1980), Bewdley (West Midland Safari Park, 1973), Blair Drummond (1970), Highland Wildlife Park (1972) **France : Thoiry (R√©serve Africaine, 1968), Peaugres (Safari de Peaugres, 1974), Sigean (R√©serve africaine de Sigean, 1974), Saint- Vrain (Parc du Safari de Saint-Vrain, 1975‚Äì1998), Obterre (Haute Touche Zoological Park, 1980) owned by the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, Port-Saint-P√®re (Plan√®te Sauvage, 1992) **Netherlands : Hilvarenbeek (Safaripark Beekse Bergen, 1968) **Germany : Gelsenkirchen (L√∂wenpark, 1968‚Äì1989), T√ºddern (L√∂wen-Safari,1968‚Äì1990), Stuckenbrock (Safariland Stuckenbrock, 1969), Hodenhagen (Serengeti Park, 1974) **Italy : Bussolengo (Parco Natura Viva), 1969), Fasano (Zoosafari, 1973), Pombia (Safari Park, 1976), Murazzano (Parco Safari delle Langhe, 1976), Ravenna (Safari Ravenna, 2012) **Denmark : Givskud (L√∏veparken, 1969), Knuthenborg (Knuthenborg Safari Park, 1969), Ebeltoft (Ree Park ‚Äì Ebeltoft Safari, 1991) **Sweden : Kolm√•rden (Safari Park, 1972‚Äì2011), Sm√•landet (Markaryds √Ñlg & Bison Safari,?) **Austria : G√§nserndorf (Safaripark, 1972‚Äì2004) **Spain : Cab√°rceno (Parque de la Naturaleza, 1990) **Portugal : Badoca Safari Park (Badoca Safari Park) **Russia : Kudykina Gora (–ö—É–¥—ã–∫–∏–Ω–∞ –≥–æ—Ä–∞) *Americas **United States ***Arizona : Camp Verde (Out of Africa Wildlife Park, 1988) ***Arkansas : Gentry (Wild Wilderness Drive-Thru Safari, 1970) ***California : Escondido (San Diego Zoo Safari Park, formerly San Diego Wild Animal Park, 1972) ***Florida : Loxahatchee (Lion Country Safari, 1967) ***Louisiana : Epps (High Delta Safari Park) ***Maryland : Largo (The Largo Wildlife Preserve, 1973‚Äì1978, now the site of Six Flags America) ***Nebraska : Ashland (Lee G.

Early life Balestre was born at Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne. He studied law in Paris, and afterwards worked as a journalist on a number of publications. =World War II= Details of Balestre's activities during World War II are unknown. He was a member of the French SS, but later claimed to have been an undercover agent for the French Resistance, and received the Legion of Honour for services to France in 1968. Career After the war, he worked as a journalist for Robert Hersant at a successful French automobile magazine called L'Auto-Journal. Balestre continued to work with Hersant as he expanded his publishing operations, which made Balestre a wealthy individual. He was a founding member of the F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise du Sport Automobile, a French national motorsport organization, in 1950, and in 1961 became the first president of the International Karting Commission of the FIA. He was elected president of the FFSA in 1973 and president of the FIA's International Sporting Commission in 1978. He was instrumental in transforming the International Sporting Commission into the F√©d√©ration Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) in 1978. In the late 1970s, photographs began to circulate of Balestre wearing a German SS uniform, and he took unsuccessful legal action to suppress their publication. Balestre was heavily involved in what is colloquially called the FISA‚ÄìFOCA war, a political battle over finances and control of the Formula One World Championships between 1980 and 1982. Balestre and his opponent, Bernie Ecclestone, settled the dispute after Enzo Ferrari brokered a compromise. Balestre signed the first Concorde Agreement, under which FOCA was granted the commercial rights to Formula One while the FIA retained control of all sporting and technical regulations. In 1986, a few hours after the death of Henri Toivonen and Sergio Cresto in a crash, Balestre announced the unilateral decision of FISA to ban Group B rallying in favour of the slower, less technically advanced Group A. Despite this decision, WRC driver fatalities peaked in 1989. Balestre is credited with establishing specific crash test requirements for Formula One cars, significantly improving the safety of the sport. He was also a key proponent of the switch to naturally aspirated engines in 1989, also arguing that such a move was essential for safety reasons. However, Balestre has also been accused of using his power for more than it was intended. In , after Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost collided at Suzuka, there were implications in Autosport magazine that Balestre was involved in manipulating the World Championship in favor of Prost, as Senna was disqualified from race victory, fined, and suspended. This ultimately led to Max Mosley's decision to run for the FISA presidency. Senna fell out with Balestre who threatened to revoke his super license but was included on the 1990 entry list. However, when Senna controversially collided with Prost in 1990 at the same Suzuka circuit, Balestre did not intervene or sanction the Brazilian. Years later, after leaving the presidency of FIA, Balestre admitted to having acted to benefit Prost in 1989. Balestre was elected as president of the FIA, while remaining president of FISA, in 1986. He was replaced as president of FISA in 1991 when he lost the election to Max Mosley in October by a vote of 43 to 29. Facing certain defeat in the re- election to the FIA presidency in October 1993, Balestre elected to stand down, and proposed that FISA be abolished and Mosley replace him as president of the FIA. Balestre maintained the presidency of the FFSA until the end of 1996. Death Balestre died on 27 March 2008, aged 86.Balestre est d√©c√©d√© , L'√âquipe.

Normally, the backbone's capacity is greater than the networks connected to it. A diagram of a typical nationwide network backbone. A large corporation that has many locations may have a backbone network that ties all of the locations together, for example, if a server cluster needs to be accessed by different departments of a company that are located at different geographical locations. The pieces of the network connections (for example: ethernet, wireless) that bring these departments together is often mentioned as network backbone. Network congestion is often taken into consideration while designing backbones. One example of a backbone network is the Internet backbone. History The theory, design principles, and first instantiation of the backbone network came from the telephone core network when traffic was purely voice. The core network was the central part of a telecommunications network that provided various services to customers who were connected by the access network. One of the main functions was to route telephone calls across the PSTN. Typically the term referred to the high capacity communication facilities that connect primary nodes. A core network provided paths for the exchange of information between different sub-networks. In the United States, local exchange core networks were linked by several competing interexchange networks; in the rest of the world, the core network has been extended to national boundaries. Core networks usually had a mesh topology that provided any-to-any connections among devices on the network. Many main service providers would have their own core/backbone networks that are interconnected. Some large enterprises have their own core/backbone network, which are typically connected to the public networks. Functions Core networks typically provided the following functionality: # Aggregation: The highest level of aggregation in a service provider network. The next level in the hierarchy under the core nodes is the distribution networks and then the edge networks. Customer-premises equipment (CPE) do not normally connect to the core networks of a large service provider. # Authentication: The function to decide whether the user requesting a service from the telecom network is authorized to do so within this network or not. # Call Control/Switching: call control or switching functionality decides the future course of call based on the call signalling processing. E.g. switching functionality may decide based on the \\"called number\\" that the call be routed towards a subscriber within this operator's network or with number portability more prevalent to another operator's network. # Charging: This functionality of the collation and processing of charging data generated by various network nodes. Two common types of charging mechanisms found in present-day networks are prepaid charging and postpaid charging. See Automatic Message Accounting # Service Invocation: Core network performs the task of service invocation for its subscribers. Service invocation may happen based on some explicit action (e.g. call transfer) by user or implicitly (call waiting). It's important to note however that service \\"execution\\" may or may not be a core network functionality as third party network/nodes may take part in actual service execution. # Gateways: Gateways shall be present in the core network to access other networks. Gateway functionality is dependent on the type of network it interfaces with. Physically, one or more of these logical functionalities may simultaneously exist in a given core network node. Besides above-mentioned functionalities, the following also formed part of a telecommunications core network: * O&M;: Operations & Maintenance centre or Operations Support Systems to configure and provision the core network nodes. Number of subscribers, peak hour call rate, nature of services, geographical preferences are some of the factors which impact the configuration. Network statistics collection (Performance Management), alarm monitoring (Fault Management) and logging of various network nodes actions (Event Management) also happens in the O&M; centre. These stats, alarms and traces form important tools for a network operator to monitor the network health and performance and improvise on the same. * Subscriber Database: Core network also hosts the subscribers database (e.g. HLR in GSM systems). Subscriber database is accessed by core network nodes for functions like authentication, profiling, service invocation etc. Distributed backbone A distributed backbone is a backbone network that consists of a number of connectivity devices connected to a series of central connectivity devices, such as hubs, switches, or routers, in a hierarchy.Tamara Dean. Network+ Guide to Networks. Course Technology, Cengage Learning, 2010, p. 202. This kind of topology allows for simple expansion and limited capital outlay for growth, because more layers of devices can be added to existing layers. In a distributed backbone network, all of the devices that access the backbone share the transmission media, as every device connected to this network is sent all transmissions placed on that network.BICSI Lan Design Manual - CD-ROM, Issue 1, Distributed backbone network, p.20 , 1996, accessed May 7, 2011. Distributed backbones, in all practicality, are in use by all large-scale networks.Dooley, Kevin. Designing Large-Scale Networks, p.23 , O'Reilly Online Catalog, January, 2002, accessed May 7, 2011. Applications in enterprise-wide scenarios confined to a single building are also practical, as certain connectivity devices can be assigned to certain floors or departments. Each floor or department possesses a LAN and a wiring closet with that workgroup's main hub or router connected to a bus-style network using backbone cabling .Distributed Backbone , accessed May 7, 2011. Another advantage of using a distributed backbone is the ability for network administrator to segregate workgroups for ease of management. There is the possibility of single points of failure, referring to connectivity devices high in the series hierarchy. The distributed backbone must be designed to separate network traffic circulating on each individual LAN from the backbone network traffic by using access devices such as routers and bridges. Collapsed backbone A collapsed backbone (inverted backbone, backbone-in-a-box) is a type of backbone network architecture. The traditional backbone network goes over the globe to provide interconnectivity to the remote hubs. In most cases, the backbones are the links while the switching or routing functions are done by the equipment at each hub. It is a distributed architecture. In the case of a collapsed or inverted backbone, each hub provides a link back to a central location to be connected to a backbone-in-a-box. That box can be a switch or a router. The topology and architecture of a collapsed backbone is a star or a rooted tree. The main advantages of the collapsed backbone approach are # ease of management since the backbone is in a single location and in a single box, and # since the backbone is essentially the back plane or internal switching matrix of the box, proprietary, high performance technology can be used. However, the drawback of the collapsed backbone is that if the box housing the backbone is down or there are reachability problem to the central location, the entire network will crash. These problems can be minimized by having redundant backbone boxes as well as having secondary/backup backbone locations. Parallel backbone There are a few different types of backbones that are used for an enterprise-wide network. When organizations are looking for a very strong and trustworthy backbone they should choose a parallel backbone. This backbone is a variation of a collapsed backbone in that it uses a central node (connection point). Although, with a parallel backbone, it allows for duplicate connections when there is more than one router or switch. Each switch and router are connected by two cables. By having more than one cable connecting each device, it ensures network connectivity to any area of the enterprise-wide network. Parallel backbones are more expensive than other backbone networks because they require more cabling than the other network topologies. Although this can be a major factor when deciding which enterprise-wide topology to use, the expense of it makes up for the efficiency it creates by adding increased performance and fault tolerance. Most organizations use parallel backbones when there are critical devices on the network. For example, if there is important data, such as payroll, that should be accessed at all times by multiple departments, then your organization should choose to implement a Parallel Backbone to make sure that the connectivity is never lost. Serial backbone A serial backbone is the simplest kind of backbone network.CompTIA Network+ In depth, Chapter 5 p. 169 Serial backbones consist of two or more internet working devices connected to each other by a single cable in a daisy-chain fashion. A daisy chain is a group of connectivity devices linked together in a serial fashion. Hubs are often connected in this way to extend a network. However, hubs are not the only device that can be connected in a serial backbone. Gateways, routers, switches and bridges more commonly form part of the backbone.Dean, T. (2010) Network+ Guide to Networks, Fifth Edition The serial backbone topology could be used for enterprise-wide networks, though it is rarely implemented for that purpose., Backbone Networks  See also  * Backhaul * Internet backbone References  External links  * IPv6 Backbone Network Topology Computer networks by scale ","title":"Backbone network"},{"id":"2853531","text":"The Flammenwerfer 35, or FmW 35 (flame thrower) was a one-man German flamethrower used during World War II to clear out trenches and buildings.

It is a secondary amide between glucosamine and acetic acid. It is significant in several biological systems. It is part of a biopolymer in the bacterial cell wall, which is built from alternating units of GlcNAc and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc), cross-linked with oligopeptides at the lactic acid residue of MurNAc. This layered structure is called peptidoglycan (formerly called murein). GlcNAc is the monomeric unit of the polymer chitin, which forms the exoskeletons of arthropods like insects and crustaceans. It is the main component of the radulas of mollusks, the beaks of cephalopods, and a major component of the cell walls of most fungi. Polymerized with glucuronic acid, it forms hyaluronan. GlcNAc has been reported to be an inhibitor of elastase release from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (range 8‚Äì17% inhibition), however this is much weaker than the inhibition seen with N-acetylgalactosamine (range 92‚Äì100%). Medical uses It has been proposed as a treatment for autoimmune diseases and recent tests have claimed some success. O-GlcNAcylation O-GlcNAcylation is the process of adding a single N-acetylglucosamine sugar to the serine or threonine of a protein. Comparable to phosphorylation, addition or removal of N-acetylglucosamine is a means of activating or deactivating enzymes or transcription factors. In fact, O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation often compete for the same serine/threonine sites. O-GlcNAcylation most often occurs on chromatin proteins, and is often seen as a response to stress. Hyperglycemia increases O-GlcNAcylation, leading to insulin resistance. Increased O-GlcNAcylation due to hyperglycemia is evidently a dysfunctional form of O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAcylation decline in the brain with age is associated with cognitive decline. When O-GlcNAcylation was increased in the hippocampus of aged mice, spatial learning and memory improved.

It was designed by Charles H McLay and built from 1886 to 1889 at a cost of ¬£38,346 by John Petrie & Son. It was originally used for the collection of customs duty and was opened in 1889, when Queensland was a British colony, replacing the original Customs House located at Petrie Bight. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005. The collection of custom duties on imported products was particularly important to Queensland where the manufacturing sector was slow to develop. Brisbane was declared a port city in 1846. In 1908, seven years after federation, the building was acquired by the federal government. Customs House is within reach of the CityCat catamaran ferry service, as well as the Free Loop Bus.  History  The Brisbane Customs House was erected at the northern end of the Town Reach of the Brisbane River, near Petrie's Bight, between 1886 and 1889 to a design prepared by Charles McLay of the Queensland Colonial Architect's Office. The 1880s building replaced an earlier and much smaller customs house on the site. The location had been chosen in 1849 following the declaration of Moreton Bay as a port of entry in 1846 and after considerable discussion as to the most suitable location for a customs house. At the time shipping activity was centred on the South Brisbane Reach and the decision to locate a customs house at the northern end of the Town Reach acted as an impetus for the development of wharves along this part of the river. A small building was erected for customs purposes in 1850 and in the following decades became increasingly inadequate as Brisbane emerged as the principal commercial centre and port of Queensland. In 1884 the Queensland Government decided to construct a new customs house. In March 1886 a design by Charles McLay was selected from many proposals in the Colonial Architect's Office for a new Brisbane Customs House. McLay completed the specification in May 1886 and construction commenced in September that year. Charles McLay was the major designer under the colonial architect George Connolly and was appointed Chief Draftsman in 1889. His works include the Bundaberg Post Office, probably the Fortitude Post Office and the Lady Norman Wing Brisbane Children's Hospital (with John James Clark), of which the Brisbane Customs House is by far the most ambitious and prominent design. The contract was let to one of Brisbane's oldest and most respected contractors, John Petrie & Son, who tendered with a price of . The contract time was 30 months but because of difficulties with the supply of some materials, especially stone for the foundations, and alterations to the original plans, the building took longer than anticipated to complete and it was opened on 2 September 1889. Retaining walls, fencing, a double staircase down to the river and nearby earth closets were also constructed. The completed building in the Victorian Free Classical style incorporated pedimented gables and a massive colonnade. Heraldic scenes in the pediments were precursors to the official Queensland coat of arms, which was not granted until 1893. A curved iron balustrade to the balconies included the initials of the reigning sovereign, Victoria Regina, in the cast. Red cedar was used extensively for desks, counters, cabinets and tables as well as for a massive and elegant staircase. The Brisbane Customs House was built during a period of economic prosperity and a construction \\"boom\\" in Queensland and was amongst the more impressive of a number of notable public and commercial buildings erected in Brisbane during the 1880s, which included the first stage of the Treasury Building (1886-1889). Public pride in the new customs house was considerable. On 7 September 1889, a few days after the building was opened for business, the local Brisbane Courier newspaper drew attention to \\"the handsome and imposing appearance, especially as seen from the river or from Petrie's Bight\\" and predicted that the Brisbane Customs House with its tall columns, pilasters and large copper-sheathed dome would \\"become one of the features of the city\\". In 1891 stables, additional retaining walls and fencing, and more earth closets were erected at a cost of . By the mid-1890s gardens and a driveway had been developed. The mature fig tree now at the site was possibly planted about this time. Minor repairs were carried out throughout the 1890s, including some work in 1895 after of water inundated the basement during the 1893 Brisbane River floods. As a consequence of the Federation of Australia, the Brisbane Customs House, valued at ( for the structure and for the site), was transferred to the Australian Government by December 1908. In 1906 the inadequacies of the original flat roof were overcome by the installation of a new hipped roof. Rearrangement of counters and partitions in the Long Room was carried out in 1911 and again in 1919. Frequently minor repairs, cleaning and maintenance work was carried out to the interior of the building in succeeding decades. In 1947 major internal alterations were undertaken: all but two of the internal masonry walls were demolished; the timber floors were replaced by concrete slabs; the cedar staircase was removed and a new terrazzo one was installed at another location; mezzanine floors were erected in the Long Room; and the roof was replaced - without the original chimneys. In 1978 part of the exterior was cleaned, repaired and sealed and painted. In the mid-1980s the Australian Customs Department moved out of the building to Australia House. The building became redundant when port facilities moved to the Port of Brisbane at the mouth of the Brisbane River, resulting in its closure in April 1988. The building remained vacant from 1988 until leased by the University of Queensland. The university refurbished the building from 1991 to 1994 at a cost of A$7.5 million. At this period some of the interior masonry walls that had been removed in 1947 were replaced and the original timber stair was reconstructed. Non-significant partitions added after 1948 and parts of the 1940s fit out were removed except for some good quality intact 1940s office cabinetry which survived and part of the 1940s main stair which provided access to the basement. Two of the 1940s galleries added to the Long Room were removed and one, at the southwest end, retained and adapted. Timber window and door joinery was conserved and plaster mouldings reconstructed where they were missing. Following the renovation, there is a restaurant and function centre within the building, and regular concerts and an art gallery occupies the lower floor. The Long Room was once the place customs business was transacted. Today the room is used various events, such as lectures and dinners. In October 2015, it was announced that a 47-storey tower block would be built adjacent to the Customs House. Protests erupted over concerns that the tower would be too close to the Customs House causing over-shadowing and the likely destruction of the fig tree. University of Queensland announced it would lodge a legal challenge against the approval of the project by Brisbane City Council, stating that the tower would be only from the Customs House boundary, despite the council's own provisions in the City Plan 2014, which would require a setback. However, the university lost its court case in July 2016. In November 2016, the university reached agreement with the tower's designers to alter the tower's profile to preserve views, reduce external car parking and restrictions on the pruning of the fig tree.  Description  Construction was finished in three years at a cost of ¬£38,346. The downstream end of the Brisbane central business district was selected to spur the development of wharves in the precinct known as Petrie Bight. The lower floor contained a secure warehouse where goods not having been passed customs were stored. Customs House is a Brisbane landmark known for its distinctive copper dome. The building was designed by Charles McLay of the Queensland Colonial Architect's Office. Despite no government in the country having a coat of arms at the time, the building features a depiction on its facade of a shield between an emu and kangaroo. An iron balustrade was shipped from England with the initials VR for Victoria Regina wrought on it in honour of Queen Victoria. Inside the structure features black and white marble with cedar fittings. The Brisbane Customs House, located at the northern end of Queen Street and beside the Brisbane River at the northern end of the Town Reach, is an imposing two- storeyed rendered brick building in the classical style. The site is prominent due to the proximity to the river, the bend in Queen Street and the general topography which opens up many views to and from the building. A prominent feature is the large copper dome at the semi-circular northern end which is a focal point viewed from both directions along Queen Street and from the river for ships arriving from Moreton Bay. The architectural form of the building announces the northern edge of the city centre and is sympathetic to the landscape features of cliffs and river bends. The architectural form clearly demonstrates the intended purpose of the building with the double entrance from both the city and the river, which is a response to the siting of the building between the river and the town. The riverside setting allows long views across and along the river to the building. Other features of the Brisbane Customs House which demonstrate its former use are more characteristic of late 19th century customs houses in Australia, especially the general design and planning arrangement of the building to include an imposing masonry facade, an impressive public space (the former Long Room now used for functions), a secure bonded warehouse (the former Queens Warehouse, now converted to an art gallery), offices and a secure boundary fence. The Brisbane Customs House is a well proportioned and skilfully designed example of a Victorian building in the Renaissance mode executed to take best advantage of its dominant site and solve the practical problems of dual access from the town and from the river. It has considerable unity in its scale, form and use of materials. The main structure of the building is of brick on a stone foundation. The columns, pilasters, balusters to the colonnade, the parapet and side entrances are of Murphy's Creek sandstone. There are cast iron balustrades on the recessed verandahs and external stairs. The main roof is clad with corrugated iron. Timber window and door joinery survives reasonably intact on the exterior walls. The exterior of the building is very intact except for the loss of the original roof, which was replaced by the present steel trussed roof in the 1940s, the removal of chimneys and the widening of the northwestern end of the balconies in the 1940s. The interior fabric is less intact due to the alterations and additions carried out during its use as a customs house and to the most recent refurbishment, which removed much of the 1940s fabric but recovered aspects of the 19th century form, including reconstruction of the original timber staircase. Inside the building the most imposing space is that of the Long Room beneath the dome. Fluted Corinthian pilasters of painted plaster are below the coffered ceiling of the dome, which has a central glazed section. In the basement some of the original walls with arched openings remain. The 1890-91 Moggill sandstone retaining wall carries around the perimeter of the site reasonably intact and incorporates a wrought iron balustrade, masonry piers, stairs and rooms for the former underground privies at the river's edge. There is a small ground with a mature fig tree and sunken garden, which contribute to the building's riverside setting. The view from the river and the secure wharf area has been compromised by the riverside walkway.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Brisbane Customs House, constructed between 1886 and 1889 to a design prepared by Charles McLay of the Queensland Colonial Architect's Office, was in use by the customs service for nearly a century. It is important historically as an expression of the importance of the customs service to Queensland and to Australia and for its site, which relates to the establishment of Brisbane as a port of entry and the development of major wharfage along the Town Reach of the Brisbane River and Petrie's Bight. The Brisbane Customs House was built during a period of economic prosperity and a construction \\"boom\\" in Queensland and was amongst the more impressive of a number of notable public and commercial buildings erected in Brisbane during the 1880s. It is important in demonstrating part of the pattern of Queensland's history. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Brisbane Customs House is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its class of cultural places: late 19th century masonry customs houses. These characteristics include: the imposing form; general arrangement of spaces to include Long Room, Bond Store and offices; and secure fencing. It is a fine example of the work of architect Charles McLay and a good example of one of a series of customs houses designed in the Queensland Colonial Architect's office and of the work of contractor John Petrie. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Brisbane Customs House has aesthetic value as a well proportioned and skilfully designed Victorian building in the Renaissance mode, executed to take best advantage of its dominant site and solve the practical problems of dual access from the town and from the river. It has considerable unity in its scale, form and use of materials. With its copper dome and two storey colonnade it makes an imposing and important contribution the streetscape and to the townscape. Its location on the riverbank adds to its aesthetic values, allowing distant views from along and across the river. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has strong associations for the Brisbane community as a landmark and as a rare surviving marker of the Port of Brisbane before it moved to the mouth of the river. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It has a special association with the Australian Customs Service, which occupied the building for nearly 100 years.

Biography Born in Ottawa, Illinois, and raised in Chillicothe, Illinois, McCulley started as a police reporter for The Police Gazette. He served as an Army public affairs officer during World War I. An amateur history buff, he went on to a career in pulp magazines and screenplays, often using a Southern California backdrop for his stories. Many of his novels and stories were written under the pseudonyms Harrington Strong, Raley Brien, George Drayne, Monica Morton, Rowena Raley, Frederic Phelps, Walter Pierson, and John Mack Stone, among others. Aside from Zorro, McCulley created many other pulp characters, including Black Star, The Spider, The Mongoose, and Thubway Tham. Many of McCulley's characters‚ÄîThe Green Ghost, The Thunderbolt, and The Crimson Clown‚Äîwere inspirations for the masked heroes that have appeared in popular culture from McCulley's time to the present day. Works The Argosy McCulley's \\"Road to Jeopardy\\" was the cover story for the February 1934 issue of Black Book Detective. =McCulley's characters= Zorro The cover of \\"The Curse of Capistrano\\" McCulley's Zorro character, reminiscent of Baroness Orczy's Scarlet Pimpernel, was first serialized in the story The Curse of Capistrano in 1919 in the pulp magazine All-Story Weekly. Zorro became his most enduring character. The appearance of the 1920 Douglas Fairbanks silent movie The Mark of Zorro, based on the first novel, was the direct cause for McCulley's reviving what had originally been a one-time hero plot. The popularity of the character led to three novellas appearing in Argosy: The Further Adventures of Zorro (1922), Zorro Rides Again (1931), and The Sign of Zorro (1941).The Vintage Library. In between, he wrote many other novels and stories set in early Spanish California which did not have Zorro as the lead character. Republic optioned the character for a serial, Zorro's Fighting Legion, which was released in 1939 and was well received. Over the coming decade Republic released three other serials connected in some way with the Zorro character. In 1940, The Mark of Zorro remake starring Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell made the character much more widely known to the public at large, and McCulley decided to bring Zorro back with new stories. McCulley made an arrangement with the pulp West Magazine to produce a brand new Zorro short story for every issue. The first of these stories appeared in July 1944 and the last one appeared in July 1951, the final issue of the publication. Fifty-three adventures in all were published in West. An additional story (possibly a story originally written for West which went unpublished when West folded) appeared in Max Brand's Western Magazine in the May 1954 issue. The final Zorro story appeared in Short Story Magazine in April 1959, after McCulley's death and after Walt Disney's Zorro television program starring Guy Williams had become nationally popular. Black Star Probably his second most popular character from the pulps was \\"The Black Star\\", a criminal mastermind who is pursued by Roger Verbeck-Flagellum and Muggs, a millionaire bachelor and his ex-thug partner. Black Star first appeared in the Street & Smith pulp Detective Story Magazine on 5 March 1916. Black Star was what was once termed a \\"gentleman criminal\\", in that he does not commit murder, nor does he permit any of his gang to kill anyone, not even the police or his arch enemy Roger Verbeck. He does not threaten women, always keeps his word, and is invariably courteous, nor does he deal with narcotics in any of his stories. He is always seen in a black cloak and a black hood on which is embossed a jet black star. The Black Star and his gang used \\"vapor bombs\\" and \\"vapor guns\\" which rendered their victims instantly unconscious, a technique which pre- dated the Green Hornet's gas gun by several decades. These stories were very popular with the readership of Detective Story Magazine and some of them were reprinted by Chelsea House, a division of Street & Smith, in a series of inexpensive hardback books. The character lasted through the end of 1930. The Spider The Spider was another long-running villain character, considered by some a significant pulp supervillain. The Spider appeared in 11 short stories and three short-story collections between 1918 and 1930. He was injured as a young man and used a wheelchair, but he used his mental abilities to run an international crime ring from his office, \\"The Spider's Den\\". The Crimson Clown The Crimson Clown appeared in Detective Story Magazine beginning in 1926 and immediately attracted reader interest, so much so that Street & Smith published two hardback collections of his adventures. The Crimson Clown (1927) was rushed to press just as soon as there was enough material available to fill a hardback volume. This was followed by The Crimson Clown Again (1928). The Crimson Clown is Delton Prouse, a wealthy young bachelor, able veteran of The Great War, explorer, and all-around adventurer who functions as a modern Robin Hood, stealing from the unjustly rich and returning money to helpless victims or worthy organizations. He dresses in a mostly red clown suit and uses a syringe of knockout drug (later this is replaced by a \\"gas gun\\"). Like McCulley's earlier \\"Man in Purple\\", who also stole from the unjustly rich, he frequently had to destroy his outfits to evade capture. McCulley retired Delton Prouse at the end of 1931, but \\"The Crimson Clown‚Äôs Return\\" (Popular Detective, Oct 1944) brought him back for one final adventure. Though an original story, it lifted the title from another Clown story in the October 18, 1930 issue of Detective Story Magazine. =Filmography= Many of Johnston McCulley's stories were made into films.

It was invented by English computer scientist Allan Plaskett in the mid-1990s. The snickometer was introduced by Channel 4 in the UK, who also introduced the Hawk-Eye and the Red Zone, in 1999.  Uses  The Snickometer is often used in a slow motion television replay by the third umpire to determine if the cricket ball touched the cricket bat on the way through to the wicketkeeper. The commentators will listen and view the shape of the recorded soundwave. If there is a sound of leather on willow, which is usually a short sharp sound in synchrony with the ball passing the bat, then the ball has touched the bat. Other sounds such as the ball hitting the batsman's pads, or the bat hitting the pitch biscuit , and so on, tend to have a fatter shape on the sound waveform. If, in the umpire's opinion, this is the case, and the ball was a legal delivery that was caught before touching the ground, then the batsman is given out by the umpire. The umpire does not have the benefit of the Snickometer, and must instead rely on his senses of sight and hearing, as well as his judgement. When the Umpire DRS (Decision Review System) was introduced to Test Cricket, Snicko was not considered accurate enough, and so another edge detecting tool Hot Spot was used. Channel 4 in the UK and Channel Nine of Australia, amongst others, have used it to help determine if the batsman was out or not. In 2013, Allan Plaskett was operating it for Sky TV.

He served in the House of Representatives from 1952 to 1980, representing the Division of Lyne for the Country Party. He was Deputy Speaker for a record span of over 13 years. Early life Born in Eltham, Kent, on 16 January 1916, Philip Lucock emigrated to New Zealand in 1923, where he was educated. In 1937, after working in the retail trade, 21-year-old Lucock emigrated again, this time to Australia. Pastoral career He studied for the ministry at St Andrew's College in Sydney, but suspended his studies to serve in the Royal Australian Air Force between 1941 and 1943 during World War 2. In 1948 Lucock was ordained as a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Australia. He became the minister at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Wingham, New South Wales. Political career One year after he was ordained, Lucock stood as one of four candidates for the Country Party of Australia in the newly created seat of Lyne. He polled third behind Jim Eggins, who won the seat for the Country Party, and the Labor candidate Edward Hayes. Lucock did not stand at the 1951 poll, but on the death of Jim Eggins in January 1952 a by-election was called. Lucock and Donald Lancaster stood for the Country Party against Edward Hayes. The presence of two Country Party candidates split the vote and Hayes took three thousand votes more than either Lucock or Lancaster, but with preferences from Lancaster, Lucock easily won the seat. When he was sworn in as the member for Lyne on 22 March 1952 Philip Lucock became the first member of the House of Representatives to swear allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II who had ascended to the throne on 6 February. Once elected Philip Lucock served in the government of Sir Robert Menzies as Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. Lucock also served in this role under Prime Ministers Harold Holt, John Gorton, William McMahon and Malcolm Fraser. At the 1954 election Donald Lancaster, Lucock's running partner for the 1952 by election, stood against him as the Labor Party candidate. Although he gained 11.4 percent of the vote Lancaster's presence did not stop Lucock from gaining re-election. In 1969 the seat of Lyne underwent redistribution, with the electorate area moving southward. Although the Labor Party increased its vote by 2 thousand, this did not have any great effect on the result of the election, with Philip Lucock winning by more than ten thousand votes.

Endelson and starring William Sanderson and Robert Judd. It was presented at the Quentin Tarantino Film Festival in the QT Six Lineup showing held in October 2005. The story revolves around three criminals (a White, Mexican, and Asian male) who hold a Black family hostage and forces them to fight for their lives.  Synopsis  Sanderson plays Kane, a hate-fuelled racist redneck who absconds from jail with his sidekicks (an Asian and a Mexican). They hole up in the secluded house of Ted Turner, a black minister, and his family, where harsh epithets are exchanged and the minister is forced to take action to defend his family.

TV Guide called it \\"a vile low- budget film that couldn't have found a receptive audience even during the height of tough blaxploitation pictures.\\" Allmovie called it an \\"outrageous sleazefest\\" and \\"amazingly racist\\".  Censorship  Fight For Your Life was denied a British theatrical release in 1981, but a video release the following year allowed the public brief access to the film before it wound up on the video nasties list and was outlawed. It is notable for being the only 'video nasty' to appear on the list due to language, specifically the racism displayed by Sanderson's character.  Availability  Briefly available in the United Kingdom on the independent video label Vision On, released circa 1982, but outlawed with the advent of the Video Recordings Act (1984), Fight For Your Life was denied a British cinema release when it was rejected by the BBFC in October 1981. Fight For Your Life was issued in the U.S. by Blue Underground as a remastered DVD. The original film negative, having been stored by the film rights holder in a New Jersey basement, was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

It was released to complete their contract with EMI, who had acquired the band's back catalogue on the United Artists and Liberty labels. It peaked at No. 12 in the UK Albums Chart in 1982. The album collected together several of the band's most popular singles and album tracks, and also included a \\"new\\" track, \\"Strange Little Girl\\". The inclusion of \\"Strange Little Girl\\" was an ironic move on the band's part: EMI had been indifferent to the band when they acquired their catalogue the previous year, not regarding them as a commercial proposition. The band proved them wrong by having a hit single with \\"Golden Brown\\", despite lacklustre promotion from EMI. When required to deliver a final single, the band re-recorded the song \\"Strange Little Girl\\", which had originally been on a demo tape they had given to EMI in 1974.

The game has twelve monster trucks and tasks the player with beating computer opponents. Checkpoints, multiple hidden shortcuts, and interactable objects commonly appear in the tracks. In the garage, the player modifies the truck to account for terrain surfaces. Online multiplayer is accessed with a modem, a local area network (LAN), or TCP/IP. Terminal Reality designed Monster Truck Madness to accurately simulate monster truck events and replicate the titular off-road vehicles. The developer hired announcer Armey Armstrong to perform sports commentary. The game received a massive following, and video game publications generally praised its gameplay, graphics, and physics. It is the first entry in Microsoft's Madness series of racing titles, which included Motocross Madness and Midtown Madness. Monster Truck Madness was followed by a sequel, Monster Truck Madness 2. Terminal Reality developed another off-road truck racing game, 4x4 Evo. Gameplay The player driving Bigfoot on A Crazy Eight. Monster Truck Madness offers twelve monster trucks, including Bigfoot, Grave Digger and Snake Bite, and tasks the player with beating computer opponents in four single-player modes: Drag, Circuit, Rally, and Tournament. Drag focuses on traditional monster truck events set in arena and stadium venues like BC Place and Tacoma Dome; the player qualifies to participate in knockout races that involve jumping over rows of cars. Circuit has five short race tracks, and Rally has long exotic tracks themed after Arizona, the highlands, and the Yucat√°n. In Tournament, the player participates in a custom series of events with computer opponents. Checkpoints, multiple hidden shortcuts (like a broken bridge), and interactable objects (such as cactuses, road signs, and fences) commonly appear in the tracks. The finder directs the truck towards the checkpoint. The player can call the helicopter to put the truck back on the road. In the garage, the player modifies the truck's tires, suspension, and acceleration-to-speed ratio to account for terrain surfaces such as mud and grass. The player can compete in multiplayer using DirectPlay and with a modem, LAN, or TCP/IP. The game includes multiple camera angles like blimp and cockpit, as well as the ability to watch and save replays of the events. Development and release Samson (pictured in the 2011 Monster Jam event) is one of the twelve monster trucks in Monster Truck Madness. American video game studio Terminal Reality, Inc. designed Monster Truck Madness to accurately simulate monster truck events such as drag tracks and enclosed circuit races, and replicate the titular off-road vehicles on land, when jumping, and during collisions. Sound effects of the trucks were recorded and digitized from such races. The game's twelve monster trucks were used under license from companies like Bigfoot 4√ó4, Inc., the owner of Bigfoot and Snake Bite. The developer hired announcer Armey Armstrong to perform sports commentary, resulting in lines such as \\"Bigfoot is doing it in the air!\\" and \\"when it's going your way, it's going your way.\\" On May 16, the game was displayed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), and Microsoft announced its autumn release date. It was released in North America on August 31. Monster Truck Madness was one of the first titles to provide force feedback and Direct3D support and required a video card for smooth, quickly processed graphics. It even included an online manual and full motion videos (FMVs) of monster truck events. Reception =Sales= Monster Truck Madness was a commercial success, accumulating a massive worldwide following. The game peaked at number 10 at PC Data's PC games sales charts during October, subsequently dropping to number 18 for November. It debuted at number 73 at NPD Group's Top Entertainment Titles chart in September, reaching number 13 in October. =Critical reviews= Monster Truck Madness received mainly positive reviews from printed and online video game publications. Praise was given by Jeff Lundrigan, a review editor for Next Generation, who stated it exploits the capabilities of Windows 95, since it can achieve high frame rates without 3D graphics accelerator cards. He was entertained by the game's physics model but saw it as unrealistic, citing an example of a monster truck jumping almost 100 feet above a hill. While GameSpot's Rebecca Anderson perceived monster truck racing as immature, she enjoyed playing the game and praised Armstrong's commentary. However, she spotted visual glitches appearing near static objects. The game's official website quoted a review from Bernard Dy of the website Game Briefs; Dy accoladed it as one of the greatest Windows 95 games, viewing its graphics as similar to Papyrus Design's NASCAR Racing and saying the physics were \\"designed for fun\\". Although he cautioned that players expecting realism would be disappointed at the lack of a printed manual and an absent damage model, he opinioned its sound design and online manual benefit the game. All three writers considered the significant number of customizable performance variables to befit all \\"skill level[s]\\". PC Zone likened the game to a hybrid of Stunt Car Racer and NASCAR Racing. Writing for Computer Gaming World, M. Clarkson commented that the game puts an emphasis on simplicity over detail, and added that players would be amused over jumping in the air and traversing the mud. Jason C. Carnevale of Game Revolution was surprised at its graphical quality, saying driving through the circuits is visually pleasant with billboards, stands, automobiles, barbeque pits, and Winnebagos. He viewed the controls as comfortable and appreciated the game's multiple shortcuts. Carnevale recommended Monster Truck Madness for players desiring a short game of excitement. Reviewing the game for PC Gamer, Colin Williamson was enthused over the design of the trucks and enjoyed its gameplay, but criticized Armstrong and felt a higher number of tracks would be satisfactory. He said the tracks are sizeable and diverse and favored the Rally races for their openness. Williamson stated that Microsoft minimized the realism to lessen the game's difficulty. Rob Smith of PC Games commented about the trucks' slowness and noticed that their big tires allow them to bounce when \\"stray[ing] from the beaten track\\". According to Smith, auto-shift and auto-braking \\"on corners\\" assist players well. He was impressed that up to eight players can participate in the game's online multiplayer mode. Smith summarized that the game lacked originality, but provided a solid arcade-style racing experience. Monster Truck Madness was nominated for Computer Games Strategy Plus 1996 Racing Simulation of the Year award, but lost to NASCAR Racing 2. Legacy Monster Truck Madness is the first entry in the Madness series of racing titles distributed by Microsoft. Terminal Reality developed the game's 1998 sequel, Monster Truck Madness 2; it features more trucks and tracks and uses the Photex2 game engine for improved graphics and physics. Microsoft subsequently published the motorcross-centered Motocross Madness in 1998, and the open world Chicago-themed Midtown Madness in 1999, both of which also received sequels. In collaboration with Microsoft, THQ and Tantalus Media created a 2003 Game Boy Advance game dubbed Monster Truck Madness, sporting 2.5D graphics, powerups, and time trial mode. Terminal Reality developed another off-road truck racing game, 4x4 Evo. In its Career Mode, the player participates in races to earn money for purchasing trucks. Its sequel, 4x4 EVO 2, introduces Adventure Mission mode, where the player performs treasure hunts and rescue operations to obtain additional money.

The M2 protein is encoded on the seventh RNA segment together with the M1 protein. Proton conductance by the M2 protein in influenza A is essential for viral replication. Influenza B and C viruses encode proteins with similar function dubbed \\"BM2\\" and \\"CM2\\" respectively. They share little similarity with M2 at the sequence level, despite a similar overall structure and mechanism.  Structure  In influenza A virus, M2 protein unit consists of three protein segments comprising 97 amino acid residues: (i) an extracellular N-terminal domain (residues 1‚Äì23); (ii) a transmembrane segment (TMS) (residues 24‚Äì46); (iii) an intracellular C-terminal domain (residues 47‚Äì97). The TMS forms the pore of the ion channel. The important residues are the imidazole of His37 (pH sensor) and the indole of Trp41 (gate). This domain is the target of the anti influenza drugs, amantadine and its ethyl derivative rimantadine, and probably also the methyl derivative of rimantadine, adapromine. The first 17 residues of the M2 cytoplasmic tail form a highly conserved amphipathic helix. The amphipathic helix residues (46‚Äì62) within the cytoplasmic tail play role in virus budding and assembly. The influenza virus utilizes these amphipathic helices in M2 to alter membrane curvature at the budding neck of the virus in a cholesterol dependent manner. The residues 70‚Äì77 of cytoplasmic tail are important for binding to M1 and for the efficient production of infectious virus particles. This region also contains a caveolin binding domain (CBD). The C-terminal end of the channel extends into a loop (residues 47‚Äì50) that connects the trans membrane domain to the C-terminal amphipathic helix. (46‚Äì62). Two different high-resolution structures of truncated forms of M2 have been reported: the crystal structure of a mutated form of the M2 transmembrane region (residues 22‚Äì46), as well as a longer version of the protein (residues 18‚Äì60) containing the transmembrane region and a segment of the C-terminal domain as studied by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The two structures also suggest different binding sites for the adamantane class of anti-influenza drugs. According to the low pH crystal structure a single molecule of amantadine binds in the middle of the pore, surrounded by residues Val27, Ala30, Ser31 and Gly34. In contrast, the NMR structure showed four rimantadine molecules bind to the lipid facing outer surface of the pore, interacting with residues Asp44 and Arg45. However, a recent solid state NMR spectroscopy structure shows that the M2 channel has two binding sites for amantadine, one high affinity site is in the N terminal lumen, and a second low affinity site on the C terminal protein surface. Proton conductance and selectivity The M2 ion channel of both influenza A is highly selective for protons. The channel is activated by low pH and has a low conductance. Histidine residues at position 37 (His37) are responsible for this proton selectivity and pH modulation. When His37 is replaced with glycine, alanine, glutamic acid, serine or threonine, the proton selective activity is lost and the mutant can transport Na+ and K+ ions also. When imidazole buffer is added to cells expressing mutant proteins, the ion selectivity is partially rescued. Acharya et al. suggested that the conduction mechanism involves the exchange of protons between the His37 imidazole moieties of M2 and waters confined to the M2 bundle interior. Water molecules within the pore form hydrogen-bonded networks or 'water wires' from the channel entrance to His37. Pore-lining carbonyl groups are well situated to stabilize hydronium ions via second-shell interactions involving bridging water molecules. A collective switch of hydrogen bond orientations may contribute to the directionality of proton flux as His37 is dynamically protonated and deprotonated in the conduction cycle. The His37 residues form a box-like structure, bounded on either side by water clusters with well-ordered oxygen atoms near by. The conformation of the protein, which is intermediate between structures previously solved at higher and lower pH, suggests a mechanism by which conformational changes might facilitate asymmetric diffusion through the channel in the presence of a proton gradient. Moreover, protons diffusing through the channel need not be localized to a single His37 imidazole, but instead may be delocalized over the entire His-box and associated water clusters.  Function  The M2 channel protein is an essential component of the viral envelope because of its ability to form a highly selective, pH-regulated, proton-conducting channel. The M2 proton channel maintains pH across the viral envelope during cell entry and across the trans-Golgi membrane of infected cells during viral maturation. As virus enters the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification occurs. This low pH activates the M2 channel, which brings protons into the virion core. Acidification of virus interior leads to weakening of electrostatic interaction and leads to dissociation between M1 and viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Subsequent membrane fusion releases the uncoated RNPs into the cytoplasm which is imported to the nucleus to start viral replication. After its synthesis within the infected host cell, M2 is inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the cell surface via trans-Golgi network (TGN). Within the acidic TGN, M2 transports H+ ions out of the lumen, and maintains hemagglutinin (HA) metastable configuration. At its TGN localization, M2 protein's ion channel activity has been shown to effectively activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Other important functions of M2 are its role in formation of filamentous strains of influenza, membrane scission and the release of the budding virion. M2 stabilizes the virus budding site, and mutations of M2 that prevent its binding to M1 can impair filament formation at the site of budding. =Transport reaction= The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by the M2 channel is: :H+ (out) ‚áå H+ (in) Inhibition and resistance The anti- influenza virus drug, amantadine, is a specific blocker of the M2 H+ channel. In the presence of amantadine, viral uncoating is incomplete, and the RNP core fails to promote infection. Aminoadamantanes, including amantadine and rimantadine have been widely abandoned due to virus resistance, but thermodynamic considerations allow design of new derivatives. Two different sites for drug interaction have been proposed. One is a lipid-facing pocket between 2 adjacent transmembrane helices (around Asp-44), at which the drug binds and inhibits proton conductance allosterically. The other is inside the pore (around Ser-31), at which the drug directly blocks proton passage. However, the M2 gene is susceptible to mutations. When one of five amino acids in the transmembrane region gets suitably substituted, the virus becomes resistant to the existing M2 inhibitors. S31N mutation is responsible for more than 90% resistance to the drugs amantadine and rimantadine. As the mutations are relatively frequent, presence of the selection factors (e.g., using amantadine for treatment of sick poultry) can lead to emergence of a resistant strain. The US CDC has released information stating that most strains are now resistant to the two drugs available, and their use should be discontinued.  Influenza B and C M2 proteins  Influenza B and C viruses encode virion proteins with similar proton-transducing function dubbed \\"BM2\\" and \\"CM2\\" respectively. They share little similarity with M2 at the sequence level, despite a similar overall structure and mechanism. =BM2= The M2 protein of influenza B is 109 residue long, homo-tetramer and is a functional homolog of influenza A protein. There is almost no sequence homology between influenza AM2 and BM2 except for the HXXXW sequence motif in the TMS that is essential for channel function. Its proton conductance pH profile is similar to that of AM2. However, the BM2 channel activity is higher than that of AM2, and the BM2 activity is completely insensitive to amantadine and rimantadine. The structure of the influenza B channel at resolutions of 1.4‚Äì1.5 √Ö, published in 2020, revealed that the channel opening mechanism is different from that of the influenza A channel. =CM2= CM2 may play a role in genome packaging in virions. CM2 adjusts intracellular pH, and is able to replace influenza A M2 in this capacity.

He was born in Paris, then the Kingdom of France, but his father was Swiss, and Pugin himself was to spend most of his life in England. Pugin left France during the Revolutionary period for unclear reasons about 1798 and later entered the Royal Academy Schools in London to improve his skills. Shortly afterwards he obtained a position as an architectural draughtsman with the architect John Nash. After considering and abandoning a career in architecture Pugin married and settled on a career as a commercial artist working primarily for publishers of illustrated books. He was a skilful watercolourist as well as an accomplished draftsman. Drawings Pugin produced views of London, jointly creating the illustrations for the Microcosm of London (1808-1811) published by Rudolph Ackermann, followed by plates for Ackermann's books about Westminster Abbey, Oxford and Cambridge universities, and Winchester College. He often collaborated with other artists, notably Thomas Rowlandson. His later works included illustrations for Specimens of Gothic Architecture (1821‚Äì23), The Royal Pavilion at Brighton (1826), Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain (1826), Specimens of the Architectural Antiquities of Normandy (1827), Illustrations of the Public Buildings of London (1825 to 1828), and Paris and its Environs (1829 to 1831), and Examples of Gothic Architecture (1831). He also produced a book of furniture designs called Gothic Furniture, and assisted architects with detailing for their gothic designs. He ran a drawing school at his house in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury. His students included W. Lake Price, James Pennethorne, Talbot Bury, J. D'Egville, B. Ferrey, the architect Francis T. Dollman, and the comedian Charles James Mathews.Pugin, Augustus Charles DNB Pugin, along with J. Morgan, also designed the Diorama building in Regent's Park in 1823, to house and display the Dioramas of Louis Jacques Mand√© Daguerre (1787‚Äì1851), a year after the debut of his Paris original in 1822. These exhibitions in London displayed eight of the Daguerre Dioramas (1823-1832), which were also exhibited on tour in Liverpool, Manchester, Dublin and Edinburgh (1825-1836). Pugin married Catherine Welby of the Lincolnshire Welby family of Denton and his developing interest in the Gothic was to be magnified in the career of their son Augustus Welby Pugin, an architect who was the leading advocate of Gothicism in 19th century England and the designer of the Palace of Westminster, home of the United Kingdom Parliament. Catherine Welby's brother Adlard Welby was great-great-grandfather to Joyce Lussu and Max Salvadori. His son also sometimes assisted him in some of his publications. {  Diorama Building, 1823, by A.

It was the final sketch of the thirteenth and final episode of the second season, and was perhaps the most notorious of the Python team's television sketches. Plot The sketch begins when a quietly spoken man (Cleese) takes his dead mother to an undertakers' office. The tactless undertaker (Chapman) suggests they can \\"burn 'er, bury 'er, or dump 'er in the Thames\\", but rules out the last option after Cleese confirms that he liked his mother. Of the other two, the undertaker says both are \\"nasty\\" and describes the sordid details. When the son shows the undertaker his mother's body, which is in a sack, he sees that the dead woman \\"looks quite young\\". He tells his assistant, Fred (Eric Idle) that he thinks they've \\"got an eater\\", to which Fred responds that he'll get the oven warm. The grieving son is shocked by the idea of eating his mother's corpse, but eventually succumbs to \\"feeling a bit peckish\\". He still feels uneasy, but when the undertaker suggests digging a grave for him to throw up into (in case he feels \\"a bit guilty afterwards\\"), he agrees. Production The BBC were wary of the sketch, and reluctantly agreed to let it go ahead on the condition that the studio audience were heard to protest loudly, then invade the set at the sketch's conclusion. This was poorly executed: the audience began booing and shouting too early (those who were not heckling were laughing), and because of studio fire regulations, only a limited section of the crowd were allowed to rush onto the studio floor; the rest simply sat there looking awkward. (As Roger Wilmut pointed out in the book From Fringe To Flying Circus, a genuinely shocked (British) audience would have reacted with an embarrassed silence.) Following its initial broadcast of the sketch in 1970, the BBC wiped the sketch from the master tape and replaced it with the \\"Spot the Braincell\\" sketch from episode 7 of the second series (\\"The Attila the Hun Show\\"). However, when the second series was released on BBC Video in 1985, episode 13 was \\"restored\\", thanks to the discovery of a (low quality) copy of the sketch that appears to be sourced from either an off-air recording of a foreign duplicate of the original show, or possibly Terry Jones' own home tape copy. This restored episode was finally shown again on television in 1987 as part of a complete (if frequently interrupted) run of second and third series repeats. Context The sketch was part of a longer running joke within the episode, which was that they expected Queen Elizabeth II to watch the show at some point. Having had interjections throughout the show (\\"She's switched to ITV!\\"), the final scene, after the desultory audience invasion, has the entire studio coming to a halt (including the portion of the audience that had rushed the stage) and standing at attention while the music to \\"God Save the Queen\\" is played, and the end credits roll. To juxtapose the joke that the Queen would be watching, the episode also deliberately featured many of Monty Python's most tasteless sketches. This sketch, the last in both the episode and the second series, immediately followed the \\"Lifeboat sketch\\" (also about cannibalism) and some graphically cannibalistic animation from Terry Gilliam. Nevertheless, it was this sketch which was most notorious for its tastelessness, and Cleese made specific reference to it alone in his eulogy for Chapman, when recalling Chapman's talent for pushing the boundaries of bad taste. Miscellany This sketch should not be confused with the \\"Undertakers film\\" from episode 11 of series 1. The Undertakers film showed, in several snippets throughout the episode, a team of increasingly fatigued undertakers struggling to carry a coffin through the streets. An audio version of the sketch, minus audience interruptions, was recorded in 1971 for the team's second album Another Monty Python Record.

He was born in the Santurce barrio. His father Roberto Clemente was the first Latin American player to compile 3,000 hits in Major League Baseball history. His mother Vera Clemente hosted a telethon in Puerto Rico in order to raise funds for the Ciudad Roberto Clemente, a sporting complex located in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Biography right Despite playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates and being established in Pittsburgh for many years, Roberto Clemente insisted his wife Vera return to Puerto Rico so Roberto Jr. could be born there a day before his own birthday. The first seven years of Clemente's life were spent between Puerto Rico and Pittsburgh. His father died in a plane crash on December 31, 1972, while taking relief supplies to Nicaragua earthquake victims. After his father‚Äôs death, Roberto Jr. became the spokesperson for the family when his mother Vera was not available. Clemente was one of the youngest speakers in the history of Congress when he spoke about his father's dream of a Sports City, a place both young and old could be instructed in sports, but more importantly, spend quality time with family and become involved citizens. In 1978 he was chosen to carry the torch and light the Pavilion for the Pan Am Games. Clemente excelled in sports at the junior high and high school levels. He was captain of the volleyball team and participated in track and field and basketball, and was offered a spot on a professional basketball team. After high school, Clemente moved to Bradenton, Florida to attend a community college. In 1984, he was spotted by a Philadelphia Phillies scout, and signed by the organization, joining their division-A team in 1985, the same year in which he made his debut in the Puerto Rican winter baseball league, with the Arecibo Wolves. A series of injuries prevented Clemente from making it to the major leagues. After playing two seasons with the Phillies, he joined the San Diego Padres after Sandy Alomar Sr. arranged it with the organization in 1986, but he had a knee injury during spring training and was not able to make the team. Clemente insisted on making the major leagues and after three knee surgeries in three years he traveled to Venezuela in 1989, where he homered on the first pitch thrown to him in over three years. He became a well-known player in Venezuela, but after signing a Triple-A contract with Baltimore Orioles before the 1989 season, he suffered a career-ending injury to his back and had to retire from professional baseball. Clemente returned to Puerto Rico and helped his mother make his father's dream a reality the Roberto Clemente Sports City. In 1992, he brought Major League Baseball's RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities) program to Puerto Rico, which has won 10 RBI World Series championships. Clemente moved to Pittsburgh to establish the Roberto Clemente Foundation in 1993 to help bring to the RBI program where there was none. When Kevin McClatchy became the Pirates' new owner in 1995, the major league team embraced and promoted RBI Baseball. In 1997 Clemente accepted an offer to broadcast New York Yankees games on television and radio, becoming a Spanish-language announcer for the Yankees on MSG Network, Telemundo, and WADO. WADO inaugurated a weekly talk show with Clemente Jr. as show host in 1997. By 1998 Roberto was splitting the duties as Spanish play by play announcer for the New York Yankees and earned three World Series rings with the 1998, 1999 and 2000 teams. Clemente added more broadcast duties by joining ESPN Deportes as a sideline reporter for the baseball post season and was part of the ESPN Family for another seven years as a color commentator. In 2001, Clemente hosted the Spanish version of MLB's network television show, Baseball Max, and by 2002, was conducting game interviews for ESPN Deportes Radio. Also in 2002, he was named honorary chairman for the ‚Äú'Baseball Assistance Team (BAT)annual fundraising dinner, and he is known for his work with the American Diabetes Association. In 2004 Clemente decided to complete his father's fatal trip with supplies. He joined forces with Project Club Clemente President Eliezer Rodriguez, but the tsunami in southeast Asia forced them to reschedule after Clemente decided to send the aid to where it was needed. In 2005, Clemente hosted a Saturday afternoon show on WFAN in New York City called The Latin Beat. This was his first English-language radio job, as he also became the first Latino host in the history of the station. In 2013 Roberto became a member of the board for The National Hispanic Health Foundation because of his work in the forefront of new Brain Technology. He is currently the Ambassador for RC21X. Clemente was selected to serve as Commissioner of President George W. Bush's south lawn Tee-Ball League. He co- hosted the T-Ball tournament at Gracie Mansion with NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg from 2006 to 2013.

In the United States of America, Conservative Friends belong to three Yearly Meetings, Ohio, North Carolina, and Iowa. English Friends affiliated with the Conservative branch tend to use the term Primitive, or (less frequently) Plain. There is no single unifying association of Conservative Friends, unlike three of the other branches of Quakerism in America, represented by Friends United Meeting, Evangelical Friends International, and Friends General Conference.  Characteristics of Conservative Friends  Conservative Friends are often seen as occupying a middle ground between the theologically liberal wing and the evangelical wing of the Society of Friends. Their origin is found in early 19th-century schisms, first with liberal, \\"Hicksite\\" Friends and then with evangelical- oriented \\"Gurneyite\\" Friends. In the latter schism, what are now called Conservative Friends were known as \\"Wilburite\\". Through the schisms, they sought continuity of traditional practices and theological emphases, over new ideas based on outside influences. These Friends have tended to follow the overt customs of plain speech and dress more than other branches of the Society of Friends. While a minority of Conservative Friends wear traditional plain dress (it is not mandated), they are most associated today with that traditional Quaker folkway. Conservative Friends also maintain the type of business meeting which was in use among all branches of Friends until the middle of the twentieth century. Each Yearly Meeting publishes a small book called The Discipline which includes the polity and beliefs of the body. This book is called by the more progressive members Faith and Practice, following the late-twentieth century example of liberal yearly meetings. The Discipline includes provisions for business organization; the naming of ministers, elders, and overseers; marriage procedures; and the Advices and Queries. The Queries are read on the local monthly meeting level, with the next higher levels (Quarterly and Yearly Meetings) summarizing the answers from the subordinate meetings.  The Hicksite‚ÄìOrthodox schism  Friends in the United States became divided during the early years of the nineteenth century. In the mid-1820s, wealthy Friends in leadership positions in Quaker organizations in Philadelphia began to \\"express disunity\\" (openly disagree) with the ministry of Elias Hicks, a rural traveling minister from Long Island, New York, whose ministry emphasized direct experience of God over reliance on scripture. Hicks himself was concerned that urban, successful and wealthy Friends particularly in Philadelphia but also in the United Kingdom had strayed from the testimonies and early practices of Friends. Of particular concern to Hicksite Friends was the adoption of Protestant notions of the authority of scripture over the Light of the Inward Christ, endorsement of justification and sanctification over the more traditional Quaker sense of gradual convincement, and the use of Trinitarian language. Also of concern for both sides was the relative authority of the Yearly Meeting (favored by the Orthodox) and the Monthly Meetings (favored by Hicksite Friends). Hicks, who like his followers was from rural farming stock, was adamant that Friends stay a \\"peculiar people\\" behind the \\"hedge\\" of Quaker plainness while the Orthodox Friends were eager to integrate with modern urban society. Both groups were active in traditional Friends social justice movements, such as the abolition of slavery and right ordered care for the mentally ill. Orthodox Friends ministers, Joseph Hoag and Stephen Grellet, spoke widely about statements made by Hicks in ministry which suggested that portions of the Bible were not accurate, particularly Hicks's view that the virgin birth was historically suspect and not necessary to salvation. Hicks always maintained that he spoke the words given him by God in what Friends called immediate revelation much as did the early Friends, but this proved unacceptable to Orthodox Quakers drawn to Protestant forms. Hicksite Quakers left PYM (1827‚Äì28) to form a new Yearly Meeting, with other yearly meetings soon to follow in division. Many scholars have written about various aspects of these controversies. A good short summary is Larry Kuenning's \\"Quaker Theologies in the 19th Century Separations\\", but for more depth, see H. Larry Ingle, Quakers in Conflict: The Hicksite Reformation (Philadelphia: Pendle Hill, 1998).  Second (Gurneyite‚ÄìWilburite) separation  Within a decade, a rift was beginning to divide the Orthodox coalition. Most ministers and elders were placing additional emphasis upon the writings of the earliest Friends (called at the time the \\"primitive\\" Friends), while other Friends were becoming influenced by the growing Evangelical movement, in particular a group of British Friends ministers associated to varying degrees with Isaac Crewdson and the Beacon movement which began in 1830 in England. The ministers and elders who emphasized the \\"primitive\\" Friends testimony became increasingly uneasy with the growing Evangelically-oriented ministry. The first official action in the movement took place when Elisha Bates, a former Clerk of Ohio Yearly Meeting, travelled to England without the official credentials (an endorsed travelling minute). On this trip, Bates participated in a baptism ceremony. (Quakers had avoided external rites like baptism and eucharist/communion.Ohio Quakers ) When he returned to Ohio, he was not only \\"read out of meeting\\" (stripped of his membership), he was disowned by the Friends (a public declaration of removal from membership). One of the evangelical English ministers, Joseph John Gurney, travelled to America to support Bates and to meet with Hicksite Friends. Instead of healing the wounds, Gurney's visit exacerbated the growing rift among the Orthodox Friends. Gurney believed that the position of the scriptures had been lowered too much among Friends; although he did not totally discount the influence or necessity of the Holy Spirit, Gurney placed the two as separate influences. He encouraged Friends to participate in government, including voting in elections (at the time, most Friends did not participate in politics). Gurney had decided as a young man not to wear the traditional Quaker clothing, stating once that he only wore a broad-brimmed hat one day of his life. He was a powerful minister and a prolific writer. Travelling among Orthodox Friends at a time when ministers were considered to be examples for the youth, he provided an example which was troubling to those Friends who were dedicated to the \\"primitive\\" movement. During Gurney's visit to North America in 1837-1838, there was opposition to his ministry throughout the Orthodox yearly meetings. A minister-schoolteacher in Rhode Island, John Wilbur, objected to Gurney's use of the early Wesleyan understanding of sanctification, which did not include the continual and daily interaction with the Holy Spirit for a growth in grace. Wilbur wrote an anonymous article that argued for the \\"primitive\\" Quaker understanding of continual interaction with the Spirit. Thomas B. Gould, another Friend from Newport, RI, also spoke with Gurney during his visit and outlined where his views departed from those of the early Friends. Other opposition to Gurney was based in the two Orthodox yearly meetings already known for their stand on the importance of an inward transformation (Ohio and Philadelphia). The first division between the so- called Wilburite and Gurneyite Friends took place in Rhode Island in 1842. When the pro-Gurney majority of the Orthodox yearly meeting objected to Wilbur's writings about Gurney, they re-organized the structure of Friends meetings in western Rhode Island and stripped Wilbur of his membership. When Wilbur appealed his disownment, his quarterly meeting divided. New England Yearly Meeting (Orthodox) was unable to decide which quarterly meeting to recognize, which precipitated a division throughout all of New England. The Wilbur-Gurney divisions continued for 15 years. New York Yearly Meeting (Orthodox) divided in 1847, and a Wilbur-influenced body was formed in Indiana. The major event in the divisions, however, was the division in Ohio Yearly Meeting (Orthodox) in 1854. This event led to divisions in Baltimore and Iowa later in 1854. Philadelphia Yearly Meeting (Orthodox) initially recognized the Conservative Ohio Yearly Meeting but ended all official relations with other yearly meetings in order to prevent its small Gurneyite minority from leaving. However, Philadelphia's Haverford College continued to educate Conservative Friends as other Quaker colleges (except for the Hicksite Swarthmore) were under the care of Gurneyite yearly meetings. Brady, John. A Short History of Conservative Friends. Richmond, Ind.: Friends United Press, 1992  Conservative Friends in the twentieth century  By 1905, there were seven Conservative Friends Yearly Meetings left in America and Canada as well as an unaffiliated but Conservative-leaning Orthodox meeting in Philadelphia. Of these, two have been laid down (Kansas Yearly Meeting, and Western Yearly Meeting) and two reunited with Gurneyite yearly meetings and Hicksite yearly meetings (Canada and New England); the undivided Philadelphia Yearly Meeting reunited with its Hicksite counterpart. In addition, most Primitive Friends communities at the beginning of the twentieth century in New York, New England, and Pennsylvania, had merged into other Quaker bodies by 1955. According to a website representing \\"Friends in Christ... a small group of Primitive Friends (Plain Quakers)\\" \\"plain\\" Quakers can today be found in the United Kingdom, in addition to some other countries.\\" Ripley Quaker Meeting is a small group of conservative Friends also located in the UK, who follow Ohio Yearly Meeting's Book of Discipline.Ripley Quaker Meeting website In the USA, three Conservative Friends Yearly Meetings remain as distinct Conservative Friends bodies in Ohio, North Carolina and Iowa; with Ohio Yearly Meeting (Conservative) being the most traditional Christian in belief and practice, of the three Conservative Friends Yearly Meetings; A small Conservative Friends remnant continues in some of the united yearly meetings (Canada and New England).

It was originally called the azimuth intercept method because the process involves drawing a line which intercepts the azimuth line. This name was shortened to intercept method and the intercept distance was shortened to 'intercept'. The method yields a line of position (LOP) on which the observer is situated. The intersection of two or more such lines will define the observer's position, called a \\"fix\\". Sights may be taken at short intervals, usually during hours of twilight, or they may be taken at an interval of an hour or more (as in observing the Sun during the day). In either case, the lines of position, if taken at different times, must be advanced or retired to correct for the movement of the ship during the interval between observations. If observations are taken at short intervals, a few minutes at most, the corrected lines of position by convention yield a \\"fix\\". If the lines of position must be advanced or retired by an hour or more, convention dictates that the result is referred to as a \\"running fix\\".  Summary  The intercept method is based on the following principle. The actual distance from the observer to the geographical position (GP) of a celestial body (that is, the point where it is directly overhead) is \\"measured\\" using a sextant. The observer has already estimated his position by dead reckoning and calculated the distance from the estimated position to the body's GP; the difference between the \\"measured\\" and calculated distances is called the intercept. 500px The diagram on the right shows why the zenith distance of a celestial body is equal to the angular distance of its GP from the observer's position. The rays of light from a celestial body are assumed to be parallel (unless the observer is looking at the moon, which is too close for such a simplification). The angle at the centre of the Earth that the ray of light passing through the body's GP makes with the line running from the observer's zenith is the same as the zenith distance. This is because they are corresponding angles. In practice it is not necessary to use zenith distances, which are 90¬∞ minus altitude, as the calculations can be done using observed altitude and calculated altitude. Taking a sight using the intercept method consists of the following process: * Observe the altitude above the horizon Ho of a celestial body and note the time of the observation. * Assume a certain geographical position (lat., lon.), it does not matter which one so long as it is within, say, 50 NM of the actual position (or even 100 NM would not introduce too much error). Compute the altitude Hc and azimuth Zn with which an observer situated at that assumed position would observe the body. * If the actual observed altitude Ho is smaller than the computed altitude Hc this means the observer is farther away from the body than the observer at the assumed position, and vice versa. For each minute of arc the distance is one NM and the difference between Hc and Ho expressed in minutes of arc (which equal NM) is termed the \\"intercept\\". The navigator now has computed the intercept and azimuth of the body. * On the chart he marks the assumed position AP and draws a line in the direction of the azimuth Zn. He then measures the intercept distance along this azimuth line, towards the body if Ho>Hc and away from it if Hosin(Hc) = sin(lat) cdot sin(dec) + cos(lat) cdot cos(dec) cdot cos(LHA) : tan(Zn) = frac{sin(LHA)}{sin(lat) cdot cos(LHA) - cos(lat) cdot tan(dec)} or, alternatively, : cos(Zn) = frac{sin(dec) - sin(lat) cdot sin(Hc)}{cos(lat) cdot cos(Hc)} Where :Hc = Computed altitude :Zn = Computed azimuth :lat = Latitude :dec = Declination :LHA = Local Hour Angle These computations can be done easily using electronic calculators or computers but traditionally there were methods which used logarithm or haversine tables. Some of these methods were H.O. 211 (Ageton), Davies, haversine, etc. The relevant haversine formula for Hc is : operatorname{hav}(overline{Hc}) = operatorname{hav}(LHA) cdot cos(lat) cdot cos(dec) + operatorname{hav}(lat pm dec) Where ' is the zenith distance, or complement of Hc. ' = 90¬∞ - Hc. The relevant formula for Zn is : operatorname{hav}(Zn) = frac{ cos(lat - Hc) - sin(dec)}{2 cdot cos(lat) cdot cos(Hc)} When using such tables or a computer or scientific calculator, the navigation triangle is solved directly, so any assumed position can be used. Often the dead reckoning DR position is used. This simplifies plotting and also reduces any slight error caused by plotting a segment of a circle as a straight line. With the use of astral navigation for air navigation, faster methods needed to be developed and tables of precomputed triangles were developed. When using precomputed sight reduction tables, selection of the assumed position is one of the trickier steps for the fledgling navigator to master. Sight reduction tables provide solutions for navigation triangles of integral degree values. When using precomputed sight reduction tables, such as H.O. 229, the assumed position must be selected to yield integer degree values for LHA (local hour angle) and latitude. West longitudes are subtracted and east longitudes are added to GHA to derive LHA, so AP's must be selected accordingly. When using precomputed sight reduction tables each observation and each body will require a different assumed position. Professional navigators are divided in usage between sight reduction tables on the one hand, and handheld computers or scientific calculators on the other. The methods are equally accurate. It is simply a matter of personal preference which method is used. An experienced navigator can reduce a sight from start to finish in about 5 minutes using nautical tables or a scientific calculator. The precise location of the assumed position has no great impact on the result, as long as it is reasonably close to the observer's actual position. An assumed position within 1 degree of arc of the observer's actual position is usually considered acceptable. The calculated altitude (Hc) is compared to the observed altitude (Ho, sextant altitude (Hs) corrected for various errors). The difference between Hc and Ho is called \\"intercept\\" and is the observer's distance from the assumed position. The resulting line of position (LOP) is a small segment of the circle of equal altitude, and is represented by a straight line perpendicular to the azimuth of the celestial body. When plotting the small segment of this circle on a chart it is drawn as a straight line, the resulting tiny errors are too small to be significant. Navigators use the memory aid \\"computed greater away\\" to determine whether the observer is farther from the body's geographic position (measure intercept from Hc away from the azimuth). If the Hc is less than Ho, then the observer is closer to the body's geographic position, and intercept is measured from the AP toward the azimuth direction. The last step in the process is to plot the lines of position LOP and determine the vessel's location. Each assumed position is plotted first. Best practise is to then advance or retire the assumed positions to correct for vessel motion during the interval between sights. Each LOP is then constructed from its associated AP by striking off the azimuth to the body, measuring intercept toward or away from the azimuth, and constructing the perpendicular line of position. To obtain a fix (a position) this LOP must be crossed with another LOP either from another sight or from elsewhere e.g. a bearing of a point of land or crossing a depth contour such as the 200 metre depth line on a chart. Sights Until the age of satellite navigation ships usually took sights at dawn, during the forenoon, at noon (meridian transit of the Sun) and dusk. The morning and evening sights were taken during twilight while the horizon was visible and the stars, planets and/or moon were visible, at least through the telescope of a sextant. Two observations are always required to give a position accurate to within a mile under favourable conditions. Three are always sufficient. Running fix A fix is called a running fix when one or more of the LOPs used to obtain it is an LOP advanced or retrieved over time. In order to get a fix the LOP must cross at an angle, the closer to 90¬∞ the better. This means the observations must have different azimuths. During the day, if only the Sun is visible, it is possible to get an LOP from the observation but not a fix as another LOP is needed. What may be done is take a first sight which yields one LOP and, some hours later, when the Sun's azimuth has changed substantially, take a second sight which yields a second LOP. Knowing the distance and course sailed in the interval, the first LOP can be advanced to its new position and the intersection with the second LOP yields a running fix. Any sight can be advanced and used to obtain a running fix. It may be that the navigator due to weather conditions could only obtain a single sight at dawn. The resulting LOP can then be advanced when, later in the morning, a Sun observation becomes possible. The precision of a running fix depends on the error in distance and course so, naturally, a running fix tends to be less precise than an unqualified fix and the navigator must take into account his confidence in the exactitude of distance and course to estimate the resulting error in the running fix. Determining a fix by crossing LOPs and advancing LOPs to get running fixes are not specific to the intercept method and can be used with any sight reduction method or with LOPs obtained by any other method (bearings, etc.).

She has received negative reception for some of her work. For 2008 Mumbai attacks, she was blamed for sensationalising the events, putting lives at risk and causing deaths by identifying on live television where the hotel guests might be located. Britta Ohm wrote in 2011 that Dutt is criticised for \\"secular shrillness\\", betraying the cause of Kashmiri Pandits, over-the-top nationalism in the reporting of Kargil conflict, and for soft- pedalling Hindutva. Dutt who was group editor of NDTV moved to the role of consulting editor in February 2015 and after 21 years, she left in January, 2017.NDTV Statement On Barkha Dutt, 15 Jan 2017 Barkha used to write columns for many national and international newspapers, such as The Washington Post.

Dywizja Piechoty Legion√≥w) was a tactical unit of the Polish Army between the World Wars. Formed on February 20, 1919, partially of veterans of the I Brigade of the Polish Legions, the unit saw extensive action during the Polish-Bolshevik War and World War II. Regarded by the soldiers of the Wehrmacht as the Iron Division, it distinguished itself in the Invasion of Poland.PAWE≈Å PIOTR WIECZORKIEWICZ, WRZESIE≈É 1939 - PR√ìBA NOWEGO SPOJRZENIA Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy As one of the most experienced and best equipped Polish divisions, it fought in many of the most notable battles of the Polish-Bolshevik War of 1919 and 1920. Among them was the operation of liberation of Wilno and Battle of Dyneburg in Daugavpils, Latvia (as part of Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy's Third Army and under his personal command, although the actual commanding officer was Micha≈Ç Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski). During the Kiev Offensive of spring of 1920, the division formed the core of Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy Operational Group and took part in the battle of Zhytomyr (April 25), capturing the city of Kiev itself (May 7). After the Polish withdrawal, the unit took part in heavy retreat battles and shielded the retreat of the rest of the Polish forces. After several clashes with the 1st Cavalry Army, the division broke off and reached the area of the Wieprz River, from where it started the counter-offensive during the Battle of Warsaw (see Battle of Dƒôblin and Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki). On the second day of the Polish offensive, August 16, the division managed to outflank the Bolshevik Mozyr Group by a forced march of over 56 kilometres. After that the division, commanded by Stefan DƒÖb-Biernacki, was attached to the Second Army and took part in the second biggest battle of the war, the Battle of the Niemen River. During the battle, the unit formed core of the Wilno Group and took part in a successful outflanking manoeuvre of the Bolshevik forces centered on the city of Grodno. After that the division was moved to the rear and took part in shielding the border with Lithuania during Lucjan ≈ªeligowski's forming of the Central Lithuanian Republic (see ≈ªeligowski's Mutiny). After the war, the division was partially demobilized and stationed in Wilno as an en cadre divisional core. In the Second Polish Republic, the division consisted of three infantry regiments (1st, 5th and 6th, all garrisoned in Wilno), and other units, such as light and heavy artillery regiments, a company of cyclists, military engineers and a mounted squadron. Before the outbreak of World War II, the division, commanded by General Wincenty Kowalski, was partially mobilized in March 1939. As a part of the Wyszk√≥w Operational Group it was to shield the northern approaches of Warsaw from the German assault from East Prussia. After the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War, the division became fully mobilized and on September 4, 1939, it made contact with enemy troops in the forests around D≈Çugosiod≈Ço. On September 7 it took part in heavy fighting near Pu≈Çtusk, but was outnumbered 3 to 1 and ordered to retreat southwards to defend the Bug River line between Kamie≈Ñczyk and Wyszk√≥w. Reinforced by 98th Heavy Artillery Detachment and 61st Light Artillery Detachment, the division successfully repelled a German assault near Bra≈Ñszczyk, after which it began delaying actions while retreating towards Ka≈Çuszyn. On September 11 that town was seized by German units and had to be retaken by force during heavy street fighting in the dark. From there, General Wincenty Kowalski planned a counter- assault of his division. In what became known as the Battle of Ka≈Çuszyn, on September 13, the division started an all-out assault on German positions in nearby villages. After heavy fighting the division broke through the third line of German defences in the villages of Lipiny, Debowiec, Wola Wody≈Ñska and Ole≈õnica. It finally broke through the German lines at Jagodno, but also suffered heavy casualties and lost most of its artillery and logistical support. Dispersed units crossed the German lines and joined several different Polish units, some of them formed ad hoc. The biggest group was rallied by the division commander, but now numbered only three infantry companies out of an original three regiments. These troops broke through the forests near Radzy≈Ñ Podlaski to reach the units of Gen. Stefan DƒÖb-Biernacki and on September 22 took part in the successful Battle of Falk√≥w against parts of the German 8th Infantry Division. Shortly afterwards the division effectively ceased to exist.

The population of the district at the time of the United Kingdom census, 2011 was 19,316. History The Oswell was a cold water well with alleged magical powers that could cure sore eyes. In 1500, the name changed to honour St Ann, whose cult was ascendant at the time. St Ann was the patron saint of lacemakers, pregnancy and women who had difficulty in conceiving. Water from the well fed a beck (stream) that ran through \\"The Spring\\" to the river. There are several ancient names attached to area Peas Hill (1230), Hunger Hills (1304) and Clay Fields. In the 1750s Charles Morley started manufacturing brown earthenware, specialising in beer mugs. In the 1830s Clay fields was divided into plots. With The Enclosure Act of 1845 allowed the city to take of the Clay fields. It was used for housing, and by 1880 the build of 'New Town' was complete. It was specifically built for the working poor. They were very basic cottages, with a butcher, a baker, a large number of public houses, a market place and, for the first time in Britain, allotments where the poor could grow their vegetables. The Public Health Act 1875 enabled local authorities to make byelaws to regulate such building. Here all the houses were pre-Public Health Act terraced houses, on a gridiron plan arranged around courts of ten houses. These were later demolished under slum-clearance legislation of the 1960s. The estate was a town within a town, the local constabulary refused to enter St Ann's estate, so policing was managed by the residents relying on 'family affiliation'. It was an area of hard work and low pay that culturally was separate from Nottingham. But it was an area of 10,000 houses where only 9% had an inside toilet, and 50% had no hot water system- many of the yards had shared toilets and open sewers leading to dysentery and cholera. Infant mortality was three times the national average. The latest immigrants, and in 1968 that meant West Indians and Jamaican in particular, had been allocated the worst housing. Clearances of houses such as these started in 1930, but because of the war 'New Town' continued until 1970. The houses were flattened and the residents dispersed. Tulip Avenue house, from Hungerhill Road, looking towards Robin Hood Chase park (2016) In 1970, the Victorian streets were replaced with a Radburn style estate. While this introduced a more modern housing stock, the confusing pattern of facing houses with differing street names and the maze of undistinguishable walk-ways made the new estate impenetrable to outsiders. The houses were built by Wimpey, using prefabricated techniques. The first residents were proud of the houses, but critical of the design of the estate. The Chase Neighbourhood Centre (2009) Government St Ann's lies within the unitary authority of Nottingham, and so is governed by Nottingham City Council. Geography St Ann's lies east of Nottingham city centre, with Thorneywood to the north east and Carlton Road forming the unofficial boundary with Sneinton to the south. Demography In common with other parts of the city, the largely working-class population is still affected by the collapse of manufacturing industry and much of the area scores badly on government measures of deprivation. It is ethnically mixed with a strong sense of community. The population in 2005 was around 15,000. St Ann's is home to people from all over the world, such as: Pakistan, Afghanistan, the West Indies, Iran, Romania, Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Brazil, Mexico, Guinea, Thailand, China, Japan and South Korea. The area has a Pakistani Community Centre and the African Caribbean National Artistic Center (ACNA). Economy In the nineteenth century, the local industries were lace and textile manufacturing, like most of Nottingham. There is the St Ann's market, which has won EU backing of ¬£200,000,000 to regenerate the market back into its former heyday. There are several ethnic run supermarkets from Jamaican to Pakistani, from Somali to Portuguese and from Italian to Greek. The two main ethnic supermarkets are Murat (which is Iranian) and Asiana, which is the largest oriental retail outlet in the East Midlands. Culture and community The area takes its name from St Ann's Well, a spring once thought to have magical healing powers, at the junction of The Wells Road and Kildare Road. It was also known as The Brodewell, the Owswell, Robin Hood's Well, in records dating back to 1301. The people of Nottingham used to walk to St Ann's Well on Easter ('Black') Monday and celebrate with a party. It was covered by a spired structure from 1856 to 1887, which was demolished to make way for the railway and later built over by what became The Gardeners pub. Stonebridge City Farm, which charges no admission fee, is an urban farm that is active in the community. The last pub in the area was the Sycamore Inn, which closed in April 2014. Landmarks The terraces north of Victoria Park have been listed as representing a style of domestic architecture that was once widespread but has been largely lost to bomb damage and slum clearance.Historic England The St Ann's Allotments is the oldest and largest allotment site in England, created in the 1830s and now Grade 2* listed as being of \\"Special Historic Interest\\". The allotments have received National Lottery funding for restoration, and were featured on the BBC's The One Show and Radio 4. Transport The Nottingham Suburban Railway ran through the area, connecting Trent Lane junction in Sneinton with Daybrook, but bomb damage closed the Sneinton end in 1941 and the line ceased operations completely in 1951.http://www.nottinghampost.com/Bygones- Nottingham-Suburban-Railway/story-12200216-detail/story.html = Bus services = ;Nottingham City Transport 39: Nottingham ‚Üí St Ann's (Beacon Hill Rise) ‚Üí Thorneywood ‚Üí Carlton Valley 40: Nottingham ‚Üí St Ann's ‚Üí Sherwood ‚Üí City Hospital Campus 40B: Nottingham ‚Üí St Ann's ‚Üí The Wells Road Top 41: Nottingham ‚Üí St Ann's 42: Nottingham ‚Üí St Ann's ;Silverdale Tours S11: St Ann's ‚Üí Carlton ‚Üí Netherfield Education Blue Bell Hill Primary School is on Gordon Road.

Sport There are few sports facilities actually in St Ann's, but across the ring road is the National Ice Centre, an Olympic-sized ice rink that is both home to the Nottingham Panthers, and also acts a major music venue of Nottingham. Nottingham Racecourse, the local horse racing track, and the Nottingham Greyhound Stadium are also nearby.

It relates a conflict over healing on the Sabbath, the commissioning of the Twelve Apostles, a conflict with scribes and a meeting of Jesus with his own family. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 35 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Vaticanus (325-350; complete) *Codex Sinaiticus (330-360; complete) *Codex Bezae (~400; complete) *Codex Alexandrinus (400-440; complete) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (~450; complete).  Healings  Continuing the theme of the Sabbath from the previous chapter, Mark 3 begins with Jesus healing a man with a shriveled or withered hand on the Sabbath in the Synagogue. The word ŒµŒæŒ∑œÅŒ±ŒºŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑ŒΩ (exƒìrammenƒìn) is translated as \\"paralyzed\\" in the International Standard Version.: International Standard Version Mark uses the adverb œÄŒ¨ŒªŒπŒΩ (palin, again), indicating this is the synagogue in Capernaum, the same as the one in ,Brown et al. 603 although the New American Standard Bible reads \\"a synagogue\\".: NASB According to Mark, \\"some\\" people were there specifically waiting to see if Jesus would heal someone on the Sabbath so that they could accuse him of breaking it. Rabbis of the time would allow healing on the Sabbath only if the person was in great danger, a situation his hand would not qualify for. The Jewish Encyclopedia article on Jesus notes: \\"... stricter rabbis allowed only the saving of life to excuse the slightest curtailment of the Sabbath rest (Shab. xxii. 6).\\" He asks the people \\"Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?\\" () They do not answer and he angrily looks around at the crowd and is \\"distressed at their stubborn hearts\\" (). Methodist founder John Wesley suggested that his adversaries were already seeking occasion to kill him.Wesley, J., Wesley's Notes on Mark 3, accessed 5 June 2017 He tells the man to put out his hand which he does and then, seemingly instantaneously, it is healed. Many other stories of healing at the time involved the healer doing work in some way to effect a cure as compared to this quick almost effortless action here.Kilgallen 63 Mark could be highlighting how great he viewed Jesus' powers as being. Jesus also equates not doing good with doing evil and says it is more important, even or perhaps especially, to not let evil and suffering occur through inaction.Kilgallen 66-67 According to Mark, this miracle is the spur which sets the Pharisees, as well as the Herodians, against Jesus, having them go out after this and plot to kill him. Thus the reaction of a substantial number of Jews has gone from being amazed to one of outright opposition. Mark has already begun to foreshadow Jesus' death, with this as well as the saying about the bridegroom and fasting in .Kilgallen 67 Some find it improbable these two groups worked together, as the Pharisees opposed Rome and Herod was backed by and supported Rome, see also Iudaea Province. Mark however may be highlighting the dual nature and seriousness of the opposition to Jesus.Kilgallen 68-69 This also occurs in Matthew 12:9-14, although Jesus asks about how one would save a sheep on the Sabbath and how helping a person is more important than helping a sheep. Luke 6:6-11 is almost the same as this section of Mark although Luke does not state that they planned to kill him, only that they were \\"furious\\" and talked about what to do about Jesus. Jesus then \\"withdraws\\", anech≈çrƒìsen, and goes down by a lake, presumably the Sea of Galilee, and people follow him there. Some see the word as meaning flight as it comes after Mark talks about the plot against Jesus, but it could just as easily mean leaving Capernaum to go to the sea. Mark says the people had come from \\"...Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon\\". () Mark thus shows that people are coming from many areas, not just Galilee. Whether these people were non-Jews is unclear as the non-Jewish areas listed also contained Jewish populations. Another group of the time to consider is the Jewish Proselytes. He has the disciples prepare a boat for him to avoid \\"crowding\\" because \\"... he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.\\" () and then he heals many of the sick. Evil (or unclean) spirits in the people brought before him fall down and call him the Son of God, but he tells them not to tell people who he is, continuing the theme of the Messianic Secret.  Choosing of the Twelve Apostles  After highlighting the growing crowd following Jesus, Mark says Jesus went up a mountain and called twelve, whom he appointed Apostles, with the power to preach and \\"drive out demons\\". Some manuscripts of Mark do not have Jesus call them Apostles in verse . Verse may be the only time he uses the word, which is most frequently (68 out of 79) used by Luke the Evangelist and Paul of Tarsus, see Strong's G652. It is perhaps symbolic that this occurs on a mountain, a height where people can be met by God in the Jewish tradition,Kilgallen 71 such as Moses talking to God on Mount Sinai, see also the Sermon on the Mount. Mark pictures Jesus as drawing large multitudes to his teaching, and shifts from mountains to lakes to houses at will, creating an evocative landscape that some find lacking plausibility,Miller 19 although the area contains such geographic features. = Verse 16 = : And Simon he surnamed Peter; He appoints Simon, called Peter, James, John, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, a second James, Thaddaeus, Simon whom Mark calls a Zealot, and lastly Judas Iscariot. Luke's lists in Luke and Acts do not include a Thaddaeus, but instead list \\"Judas, son of James\\" or \\"Judas the brother of James\\" in the KJV,: KJV which some have asserted are two names for the same person, Jude Thaddaeus. Luke also has the story of the Seventy Disciples. Matthew's list is the same as Mark in , although a few western manuscripts of Matthew have a Lebbaeus.Brown 130 This might also indicate that by the time of the writing of the Gospels the exact recollection of the \\"minor\\" Apostles had become uncertain, and that there is no \\"Jude Thaddaeus\\", a creation of later hagiography. John lists no Bartholomew, although John's Nathanael is usually equated with him. Mark says that the brothers James and John were given the title Boanerges, which Mark tells us means \\"Sons of Thunder\\", although many modern scholars disagree with this translation.Kilgallen 70 Many explanations have been given for this title but none commands a consensus.Brown et al. 604 Mark does not explain why Jesus gave Simon the name Peter, meaning rock. has his naming in connection with the church and has it relate to his character. It could also have an ironic meaning, as even Peter denies Jesus in the end.Miller 20 Philip and Andrew are both Greek names, also Thaddaeus and Lebbaeus. Some Jews, especially from places like Galilee where there were substantial non-Jewish populations, did have a Greek name as well as a Jewish name. The second Simon is called a kananaios, probably derived from the Aramaic word qan'ƒÅnƒÅ, meaning a Zealot, which might mean he belonged to a political movement in rebellion against Rome, but might also mean he was religiously zealous. Luke uses the Greek term zƒìl≈çtƒìs. Iscariot might be Judas' last name or might be a reference to where he came from, meaning \\"man of Kerioth\\" It may also be derived from sicarii. The fact that there are twelve Apostles is seen as being related to the Twelve tribes of Israel. Jesus will \\"send them out\\", the Greek verb apostolien (Strong's G649) meaning to send out, to do the work he has been doing but without him being present. Many churches interpret this as his founding of the church, as he creates a special group to work in his name without him. See also the Great Commission.  A house divided  Jesus goes to someone's house and a large crowd follows him there. According to Mark, this prevented Jesus and his disciples from being able to eat. \\"When his family (hoi par' autou) heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, 'He is out of his mind'.\\" (), or \\"beside himself\\", exestƒì (Strong's G1839), which could be read as Jesus' family accusing him of being crazy or describing what others had said about Jesus. Either way they go to assert their control over him, perhaps to stop him from embarrassing the family. Hearing Jesus is being followed by so many people does not seem to accord with their view of him.Kilgallen 72 Whether it was Jesus teaching and attracting large crowds or not eating that disturbs them so much is not clear. A few early manuscripts have \\"the scribes and the others\\" instead of his family, but these are usually seen as alterations perhaps designed to tone down the impression of Jesus' own family toward him. Beelzebub as depicted in Jacques Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal (Paris, 1863). Scribes from Jerusalem, who Matthew says were Pharisees, come and accuse him of something worse than being crazy, using Beelzebub, and/or the \\"prince of demons\\" to drive out demons. His power over the demons, they assert, comes from evil power itself.Kilgallen 73 Beelzebub is thought to mean perhaps \\"lord of the flies\\" or \\"lord of dung\\" or \\"lord of the height or dwelling\\", but no certainty exists as to its exact meaning. They do not dispute that he did in fact drive out the demons. They seem to believe Jesus' power is beyond human capabilities and must be supernatural in origin. The charge of Jesus using evil powers was probably made against him to his followers for quite some time after his death. The Jesus Seminar feels the version in is \\"red\\" (\\"authentic\\") and calls it \\"the Beelzebul controversy\\". is determined to be \\"pink\\" (\\"a close approximation of what Jesus did\\") and is called \\"Jesus' relatives come to get him\\" as are , , and the Gospel of Thomas 99:1-3 where they are called \\"True relatives\\". Mark often has Jesus using analogies, metaphors or riddles, called parables by Mark. Jesus replies: :How can Satan cast out Satan? And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. :No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house. :Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation () If Jesus is working against what is evil, such as the demons, then this cannot be the work of Satan, as Satan would be working against himself. Jesus then compares himself to a thief going into a \\"strong man's house\\", and binding him to \\"spoil his house\\", i.e. to rob him. The ‚Äústrong man‚Äù is Satan.Maclear, G. F. (1893), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Mark 3, accessed 20 March 2020 Satan, says Jesus, is strong and must be restrained in order to be robbed. He is robbing Satan of the possession of the people,Kilgallen 74 or the house could be seen as the world itself.Brown 131 The New Living Translation adds the interpretation that there is \\"someone even stronger\\".: NLT G. F. Maclear asserts that \\"the Stronger than the Strong is Christ\\". Jesus thus implies what he has been doing is directly against Satan and that his motives are Satan's utmost ruin. His power, he asserts, is good and so must also come from a good source, God. Jesus also makes the claim that all sins can be forgiven, except for an eternal sin, such as blasphemy against the Holy Spirit (). Mark inserts his own explanation as to why Jesus said this, stating \\"He said this because they were saying, \\"He has an evil spirit.\\" (), thus Jesus according to Mark is saying that accusing him of using Satan for his power is in effect calling the work of God evil and failing to see the work of God in Jesus' actions. The parallels in and and the Gospel of Thomas 44 call this the unforgivable sin. Unforgivable sins are also listed in Hebrews and as well as 1 John . There is also a possible link with 1 Corinthians . His first answer to the charge, that a \\"house divided\\" cannot stand, has become a common piece of wisdom, the most famous modern example is Lincoln's use of this phrase during the 1858 senatorial election campaign against Stephen Douglas. Lincoln used the metaphor of a \\"house divided\\" to describe the situation of the United States on the eve of the Civil War. Jesus' family Jesus' mother and brothers arrive and send someone in to get him. He replies, speaking to the crowd around him, \\"Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother\\" (). Jesus' answer to his family, that those who follow him are his family is, according to Kilgallen, Jesus' way of underlining \\"... the fact that his life has been changed to such a degree that family ties no longer come before those whom he teaches about the kingdom of God\\".Kilgallen 75 Jesus puts loyalty to God above loyalty to family. Family ties were considered very important in the society of the time,Brown et al. 605 and some people even today are troubled by this seeming conflict between Jesus and his family. Jesus however states that his ties, and his respect and love due to his family, will go to those who obey God. Jesus' family is mentioned again in Mark . The story of Jesus and his family is also found in the Gospel of Thomas as saying 99. In Mark , Peter says they have left everything to follow Jesus and he lists the great rewards as well as persecutions they will get for following him. These incidents occur in all the Synoptic Gospels. In Matthew they occur in 12:22-50, and in Luke they are split up between 8:19-21 and 11:14-28. Neither Matthew nor Luke though state that Jesus' family thought he was \\"... out of his mind.\\" John, while mentioning none of these incidents, relates in chapter 7 how \\"... even his own brothers did not believe in him\\" because he would not go to the Feast of Tabernacles with them and perform miracles, although he later goes there in secret. says \\"many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him\\". The negative view of Jesus' family may be related to the conflict between Paul and Jewish Christians. \\"Wilson (1992) [Wilson, A.N. Jesus: A life. 1992. New York: Norton & Co.] has hypothesized that the negative relationship between Jesus and his family was placed in the Gospels (especially in the Gospel of Mark) to dissuade early Christians from following the Jesus cult that was administered by Jesus‚Äô family. Wilson says: ‚Äú... it would not be surprising if other parts of the church, particularly the Gentiles, liked telling stories about Jesus as a man who had no sympathy or support from his family (p. 86)‚Äù. Butz (2005) [Butz, Jeffrey. The brother of Jesus and the lost teachings of Christianity. 2005. Rochester, Vermont: Inner Traditions] is more succinct: ‚Äú... by the time Mark was writing in the late 60s, the Gentile churches outside of Israel were beginning to resent the authority wielded by Jerusalem where James and the apostles were leaders, thus providing the motive for Mark‚Äôs antifamily stance... (p. 44).‚Äù Other prominent scholars agree (e.g., Crosson, 1973 [Crosson, John Dominic. ‚ÄúMark and the relatives of Jesus‚Äù. Novum Testamentum, 15, 1973]; Mack, 1988 [Mack, Burton. A myth of innocence: Mark and Christian origins. 1988. Philadelphia: Fortress]; Painter. 1999 [Painter, John. Just James: The brother of Jesus in history and tradition. 1999. Minneapolis: Fortress Press]).\\" There is much disagreement over whether these \\"brothers\\" referred to here are Jesus' actual brothers or merely stepbrothers or cousins. The official Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox doctrine is that Mary was a perpetual virgin, and so could not have had any other children besides Jesus, thus making these Jesus' half brothers, sons of Joseph from another, unrecorded, marriage, or cousins. Only Tertullian seems to have questioned this in the early Church. Islam also holds that Mary was a perpetual virgin, as did many of the early Protestants, although many Protestants today do not hold to the doctrine of perpetual virginity, and would thus believe that these are Jesus' full brothers. A few early manuscripts also have \\"and your sisters\\" in verse . This section gives a clear example of Mark's sandwich technique, where one story is interspersed into the center of another. Mark has highlighted two reactions to Jesus and his teaching and acts: one of faith, such as that of his followers, and one of disbelief and hostility. Jesus explains the nature of the effect of his teachings on others in the Parable of the Sower in .

Originally several fossilized parts discovered separately (the mouth, frontal appendages and trunk) were thought to be three separate creatures, a misapprehension corrected by Harry B. Whittington and Derek Briggs in a 1985 journal article. Anomalocaris is thought to be one of the earliest examples of an apex predator, though others have been found in older Cambrian lagerst√§tten deposits. Discovery Anomalocaris has been misidentified several times, in part due to its makeup of a mixture of mineralized and unmineralized body parts; the mouth and frontal appendage was considerably harder and more easily fossilized than the delicate body. Anomalocaris fossils were first collected in 1886 or 1888 by Richard G. McConnell of the Geological Survey of Canada. The specimens were described and named in 1892 by GSC paleontologist Joseph Frederick Whiteaves. The specimens are now known to represent isolated frontal appendages, but Whiteaves interpreted them as the abdomens of phyllocarid crustaceans. Noting its unusual anatomy for the abdomen of a crustacean, Whiteaves gave it the name Anomalocaris, meaning \\"unlike other shrimps\\". In 1928, Danish paleontologist Kai Henriksen proposed that Tuzoia, a Burgess Shale arthropod then known only from the carapace, represented the missing front half of Anomalocaris. The artists Elie Cheverlange and Charles R. Knight followed this interpretation in their depictions of Anomalocaris. Unknown to scientists at the time, the body parts of relatives of Anomalocaris had already been described but not recognized as such. The first fossilized anomalocaridid mouth was discovered by Charles Doolittle Walcott, who mistook it for a jellyfish and placed it in the genus Peytoia. Walcott also discovered a frontal appendage but failed to realize the similarities to Whiteaves' discovery and instead identified it as feeding appendage or tail of the extinct Sidneyia. In the same publication in which he named Peytoia, Walcott named Laggania, a taxon that he interpreted as a holothurian. In 1966, the Geological Survey of Canada began a comprehensive revision of the Burgess Shale fossil record, led by Cambridge University paleontologist Harry B. Whittington. In the process of this revision, Whittington and his students Simon Conway Morris and Derek Briggs would discover the true nature of Anomalocaris and its relatives, but not without contributing to the history of misinterpretations first. In 1978, Conway Morris recognized that the mouthparts of Laggania were identical to Peytoia, but concluded that Laggania was a composite fossil made up of Peytoia and the sponge Corralio undulata. In 1979, Briggs recognized that the fossils of Anomalocaris were appendages, not abdomens, and proposed that they were the walking legs of a giant arthropod, and that the feeding appendage Walcott had assigned to Sidneyia was the feeding appendage of Anomalocaris. Later, while clearing what he thought was an unrelated specimen, Harry B. Whittington removed a layer of covering stone to discover the unequivocally connected frontal appendage thought to be a shrimp tail and mouth thought to be a jellyfish. Whittington linked the two species, but it took several more years for researchers to realize that the continuously juxtaposed Peytoia, Laggania and frontal appendage actually represented a single, enormous creature. The two genera are now placed into the order Radiodonta, which commonly known as radiodont or anomalocaridid. Because Peytoia was named first, it became the correct name for the entire animal. The original frontal appendage, however, came from a larger species distinct from Peytoia and \\"Laggania\\", which retains the name Anomalocaris. In 2011, six fossils of compound eyes, the first for Anomalocaris, were recovered from a paleontological dig at Emu Bay on Kangaroo Island, Australia, proving that Anomalocaris was indeed an arthropod as had been suspected. The find also indicated that advanced arthropod eyes had evolved very early, before the evolution of jointed legs or hardened exoskeletons. Stephen Jay Gould cites Anomalocaris as one of the fossilized extinct species he believed to be evidence of a much more diverse set of phyla that existed in the Cambrian Period, discussed in his book Wonderful Life, a conclusion disputed by other paleontologists. Anatomy Size of Anomalocaris compared to an average-sized human hand For the time in which it lived, Anomalocaris was gigantic, up to long. It propelled itself through the water by undulating the flexible flaps on the sides of its body. Each flap sloped below the one more posterior to it, and this overlapping allowed the lobes on each side of the body to act as a single \\"fin\\", maximizing the swimming efficiency. The construction of a remote-controlled model showed this mode of swimming to be intrinsically stable, implying that Anomalocaris would not have needed a complex brain to manage balance while swimming. The body was widest between the third and fifth lobe and narrowed towards the tail; it was thought to have at least 11 pairs of flaps in total. It is difficult to distinguish lobes near the tail, making an accurate count difficult. Later studies reveal that it had 13 pairs on the trunk region and additional 3 pairs of small flaps on the neck region. Reconstruction of Anomalocaris canadensis, showing multiple head sclerites and setal blades run across the dorsal trunk region. Oral cones of Anomalocaris (A), Peytoia (B) and Hurdia (C). The former showing unique triradial, tuberculated and wrinkled structures. Anomalocaris had an unusual disk-like mouth known as oral cone. The oral cone was composed of several plates organized triradially. 3 of the plates were quite large. 3-4 medium sized plates could be found between each of the large plates, and several small, wrinkled plates between them. Such oral cone is very differrent to those of a typical hurdiid radiodont like Peytoia and Hurdia, which is smooth and tetraradial. The mouth resembled a pineapple ring with the center replaced by a series of serrated prongs. The mouth could constrict to crush prey, but never completely close; there was always an opening about 5 millimeters in diameter when the mouth was shut; a centimeter in exceptionally large individuals. Two large frontal appendage (up to in length when extended) were positioned in front of the mouth, at the front of the head. As a shared character across radiodonts, Anomalocaris also possessed three sclerites on the top and side of its head. The top one known as a head shield, dorsal carapace or H-element. it was shaped like an oval, with a distinct rim on the outer edge. The remaining two lateral sclerites known as P-elements also ovoid, but connected by a bar-like outgrowth. The P-elements were previously misinterpreted as two huge compound eyes. Frontal appendages of Anomalocaris, with examples from four different species. Anomalocaris canadensis possessed 14 segments (podomeres) on each frontal appendage, almost each one tipped with two barb-like ventral spines (endites). The ventral spines themselves were both equipped with 2 smaller auxiliary spines, which branches off from the main spine at the center of its length. The tail was large and fan-shaped, composed of three pairs of large, lateral fin-shaped lobes and one terminal lobe-like tailpiece. Along with undulations of the lobes, it was probably used to propel the creature through Cambrian waters. The gills of the animal, in the form of long, thin, hair-like structures known as lanceolate blades, arranged in a row which forming setal blades. The setal blades were attached by their margin to the top side of the animal, two setal blades per body segment. A divide ran down the middle, separating the gills. Based on fossilized eyes from the Emu Bay Shale, which belonged to Anomalocaris briggsi (Which, based on morphological and phylogenetic evidence, was more closely related to Tamisiocaris), the eyes of Anomalocaris were 30 times more powerful than those of trilobites, long thought to have had the most advanced eyes of any contemporary species. With 16,000 lenses, the resolution of the eyes would have been rivalled only by that of the modern dragonfly, which has 28,000 lenses in each eye. Additionally, Anomalocaris had dichromatic colour vision. Paleobiology =Diet= Reconstruction of Anomalocaris canadensis. A long- standing view holds that Anomalocaris fed on hard-bodied animals, including trilobites‚Äîmaking it one of the first predators‚Äîand its mid-gut glands strongly suggest a predatory lifestyle. However, its ability to penetrate mineralised shells has been questioned. Some Cambrian trilobites have been found with round or W-shaped \\"bite\\" marks, which were identified as being the same shape as the mouthparts of Anomalocaris. Stronger evidence that Anomalocaris ate trilobites comes from coprolite, which contain trilobite parts and are so large that the anomalocarids are the only known organism from that period large enough to have produced them. However, since Anomalocaris lacks any mineralised tissue, it seemed unlikely that it would be able to penetrate the hard, calcified shell of trilobites. Rather, the coprolites may have been produced by a different organisms, such as the trilobites of the genus Redlichia. The lack of wear on anomalocaridid mouthparts suggests they did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells, and were possibly better suited to feeding on smaller, soft-bodied organisms by suction, since they would have experienced structural failure if they were used against the armour of trilobites. A. canadensis may have been capable of feeding on organisms with hard exoskeletons due to the short, robust spines on its appendages. However, as opposed to Peytoia whose mouthpiece is more rectangular with short protruding spines, the mouthpiece of A. canadensis has a smaller and more irregular diamond-shaped opening, not permitting strong biting motions, and indicating a suction-feeding behavior to suck in softer organisms. Reconstruction of Anomalocaris magnabasis. Phylogenetic analyses have also found A. briggsi to belong to the closely related, filter-feeding family Cetiocaridae, which suggests that may have been a filter-feeder as well. One suggested possibility is that anomalocaridids fed by grabbing one end of their prey in their jaws while using their appendages to quickly rock the other end of the animal back and forth. This produced stresses that exploited the weaknesses of arthropod cuticles, causing the prey's exoskeleton to rupture and allowing the predator to access its innards. This behaviour was originally thought to have provided an evolutionary pressure for trilobites to roll up, to avoid being flexed until they snapped. Anomalocaris magnabasis, a large species of Anomalocaris discovered south of the Burgess Shale, had spinules projecting from the spine base. These small, thin spines would have allowed Anomalocaris magnabasis to be a more effective hunter of soft bodied prey, able to pick up and quickly ensnare priapulids and other animals that lacked a hard shell. Paleoecology Anomalocaris canadensis lived in the Burgess Shale in relatively great numbers, though comparable fossils have been found elsewhere, suggesting a more expansive range over the Laurentian continent. In the Burgess Shale, Anomalocaris is more common in the older sections, notably the Mount Stephen trilobite beds. However, in the younger sections, such as the Phyllopod bed, Anomalocaris could reach much greater sizes; roughly twice the size of its older, trilobite bed relatives. These rare giant specimens have previously been referred to a separate species, Anomalocaris gigantea; however, the validity of this species has been called into question, and is currently dubious. Other species attributed to Anomalocaris live in vastly different environments. Anomalocaris saron and Anomalocaris kunmingensis lived in the Maotianshan Shales, a shallow tropical sea in what is now modern China. Anomalocaris briggsi lived in a comparable environment; the shallow, tropical waters of Cambrian Australia. The Maotianshan Shale and the Emu Bay Shale are very close in proximity, being separated by a small landmass, far from the Burgess Shale.

The band consisted of future Guns N' Roses members Slash, Steven Adler and Duff McKagan. They auditioned a number of singers while writing material. However they disbanded the same year with no releases. Following his firing from Guns N' Roses in 1990, Adler joined Vain in 1991, with the band renaming themselves Road Crew the same year. The new lineup consisted of former members of California glam rockers Vain: Davy Vain, Ashley Mitchell, Jamie Scott, and Shawn Rorie. They recorded an album and gained some label attention. However, due to Adler's drug abuse, Road Crew disbanded once more without releasing the album. History =Early years, formation and disbanding (1984)= Following the breakup of his previous group Tidus Sloan, Slash found himself without a band. His childhood friend Steven Adler, who had learned to play drums suggested that they form a band together. After trying out for London they decided to form their own band, taking out an ad in The Recycler for a bass player before auditioning for singers. Though they received a few calls, only Duff McKagan wanted to meet with them. McKagan had moved from Seattle to Los Angeles at this point having already been a member of the bands The Fartz, Fastbacks and 10 Minute Warning while he also played one show drumming for Johnny Thunders. Shortly after his move, he answered the ad and met with Slash and Adler at Canter's Deli. Describing McKagan's appearance upon meeting him at Canter's, Slash said that he was \\"this bone- skinny six-foot-plus guy, with short spiked blonde hair [who] rolled in wearing a Sid Vicious-style chain and padlock around his neck, combat boots, and a red-and-black leather trench coat in spite of the seventy-five-degree weather. No one had predicted that.\\" Soon after meeting, the trio formed a group together, named Road Crew (after the Mot√∂rhead song \\"(We Are) The Road Crew\\") and began auditioning singers. They auditioned a number of singers, including Ron Reyes who was briefly the singer for Black Flag, while working on material which included the main riff to what would become \\"Rocket Queen\\" (though Adler stated in a later interview stated that no Road Crew material was used until the recording of the Use Your Illusion albums). Despite there being a good chemistry between the trio, Slash disbanded the group citing not being able to find a singer as well as Adler's constant partying and lack of work ethic compared to himself and McKagan. Slash would go on to play with Black Sheep and audition for Poison, while both Slash and Adler became members of Hollywood Rose. Hollywood Rose would break-up and reform (without Slash and Adler) eventually becoming Guns N' Roses. Slash, McKagan and Adler would replace Guns N' Roses members Tracii Guns, Ole Beich and Rob Gardner respectively. Along with Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin, the lineup would be known as the \\"classic lineup\\" of Guns N' Roses. =Second incarnation (1991)= After being fired from Guns N' Roses in 1990, Adler would join the heavy metal group Vain. The band, who had by then recorded two albums, and whose lineup consisted at that time of singer Davy Vain, guitarists Jamie Scott and bassist Ashley Mitchell, as well as guitarist Shawn Rorie who had joined after the second album was completed, renamed themselves Road Crew and proceeded to record an album. However, despite gaining attention from a record label, the group disbanded due to Adler's drug problems at the time. Following the breakup, Adler briefly joined BulletBoys, before forming the group Suki Jones, which eventually became Adler's Appetite, performing on and off with the band since 2003. Following the breakup of Adler's Appetite, he formed the eponymous group Adler in 2011. On April 14, 2012, Slash, McKagan and Adler were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as members of the classic lineup of Guns N' Roses. They headlined the induction ceremony with fellow inductee Matt Sorum, as well as former member Gilby Clarke and Alter Bridge singer Myles Kennedy.

Background Born August 24, 1914, in Vernon, Texas, son of attorney Samuel A. Morgan Sr. and Verna Johnson Morgan, Year: 1930; Census Place: Amarillo, Potter, Texas; Roll: 2384; Page: 12A; Enumeration District: 0012; Image: 601.0; FHL microfilm: 2342118. Source: Ancestry.com. 1930 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2002. Original data: United States of America, Bureau of the Census. Fifteenth Census of the United States, 1930. Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1930. T626, 2,667 rolls. Morgan graduated from a military school in 1931 and then attended several colleges, including Amarillo College, New Mexico Military Institute, West Texas State Teachers College, and the University of Texas at Austin. While at Texas he learned to fly aircraft, and in 1934 dropped out of college. He worked in the Fiji Islands as a foreman on a pineapple plantation until 1938, when he returned to enlist as an aviation cadet in the U.S. Army Air Corps. However, because of his poor education record, he was refused enlistment. Working at an oil-drilling site for Texaco, Morgan suffered a broken neck in an industrial accident, and as a result was later classified 4-F by the Selective Service System. Military service In August, 1941, Morgan joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, and after completion of flight training in Saskatchewan, Ontario, and RAF Church Lawford, England, was posted as a Sergeant Pilot with RAF Bomber Command. On March 23, 1943, he was transferred to the U.S. Army Air Forces as a Flight Officer and assigned to the 92nd Bomb Group's 326th Bomb Squadron, RAF Alconbury, England. Morgan, on his fifth U.S. mission, was co- pilot of a crew flying a B-17F, ser. no. 42-29802, to a target in Hanover, Germany, on July 28, 1943. It was for his participation in this mission that he received the Medal of Honor (citation shown below in full), which was awarded on December 18, 1943. =Medal of Honor action= Morgan's experience began as his group formation neared the German coast. The B-17, nicknamed Ruthie II, was attacked by a large number of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters and had part of its oxygen system to the gunners' positions in the rear of the aircraft knocked out. The first burst of fire also smashed the cockpit's windshield, damaged the interphone, and split open the skull of pilot Lt. Robert Campbell. The pilot's upper body slumped over his control wheel, causing it to start out of control. F/O Morgan seized the controls on his side and by sheer strength pulled the plane back into formation. The disabled pilot continued to try to wrest the controls away from Morgan and smashed at the co- pilot with his fists, knocking some teeth loose and blackening both his eyes. Meanwhile, the top turret gunner was also seriously injured when a 20 mm shell tore off his left arm at the shoulder. He fell out of the turret position, and was found by the navigator bleeding to death. The navigator bailed the gunner out of the aircraft in a successful effort to save his life. Unknown to Morgan, the waist, tail and radio gunners became unconscious from lack of oxygen and were threatened with death by anoxia. Morgan, unable to call for assistance because of the damaged interphone, had to decide whether to turn back immediately or try to fly all the way to the target and back within the protection of the formation. He also had to decide whether or not to subject Campbell to anoxia by cutting off his oxygen to disable him. In spite of wild efforts by the fatally wounded pilot to seize the controls, Morgan chose to complete the mission and not cut off his pilot's oxygen supply. For two hours he held position in the formation ‚Äì flying with one hand, fighting off the pilot with the other. At length the navigator entered the flight deck and relieved the situation. The navigator and bombardier secured the dying pilot in the nose compartment of the airplane. F/O Morgan's B-17 reached the target at Hanover and successfully dropped its bombs. With all his fuel gauges reading empty, Morgan landed the bomber at RAF Foulsham. Lt. Campbell died an hour and half later, and the five surviving gunners recovered from various degrees of frostbite. The B-17 was declared damaged beyond economical repair and never flew again. =Subsequent career= Morgan's grave at Arlington National Cemetery F/O Morgan transferred to the 482nd Bomb Group in October 1943 to fly B-17 H2X radar aircraft and was promoted to second lieutenant in November. He remained on combat duty, flying in 25¬Ω missions. On March 6, 1944, Morgan was the pilot of a B-17 leading the first major USAAF attack against Berlin when he was shot down and captured, held in Stalag Luft I, Barth, Germany, for the remainder of the war, the only person to become a POW after being awarded the Medal of Honor. In 1948 Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay, Jr. published their novel Twelve O'Clock High and used Morgan as a model for a primary character, Lt. Jesse Bishop. The wording of his actions appearing in his citation was used as dialogue in the script to describe the actions of Bishop under similar circumstances, and like Morgan, Bishop's character was awarded the Medal of Honor and later became a POW. The circumstances also became a featured part of the 1949 film adaptation. After the war, Morgan returned to work for Texaco in California selling aviation fuel. Called back to active duty when the Korean War broke out, he took a leave of absence from Texaco (1950‚Äì53) and applied for combat duty. The Air Force denied his request but allowed him to fly cargo planes in the United States for two years. He completed his final year on active duty in the office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force. He retired from the Air Force, a lieutenant colonel. Morgan is survived by his only child Sam Morgan, who himself retired from the US Air Force after 20 plus years of service. Morgan has four grandchildren and three step grandchildren of which three are currently serving in the Army and Marine Corps. Mark, the oldest, has served in every operation since Desert Storm in 1991 minus the Balkan Campaigns. John, Wade and Rachel have all served one or more tours in Iraq or Afghanistan since the attacks on 9/11. Morgan died on January 17, 1991, from complications associated with Alzheimer's and a stroke and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. When questioned of his valor and heroism, Morgan replied, \\"There's no such thing as a hero. ‚Ä¶I was pushed into circumstances where I was forced to act. You can never say how you're going to react to something until it happens, but I think most people would have done the same.\\" Medal of Honor citation Citation: > For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty, > while participating on a bombing mission over enemy-occupied continental > Europe, 28 (sic) July 1943.

She then moved into the Palace of Eternal Spring in the western part of the Forbidden City. She gave birth on 3 November 1728 to Hongli's first daughter, who would die prematurely on 14 February 1730, on 9 August 1730 to his second son, Yonglian, who would die due to small pox on 23 November 1738, and on 31 July 1731 to his third daughter, Princess Hejing of the First Rank. =Qianlong era= The Yongzheng Emperor died on 8 October 1735 and was succeeded by Hongli, who was enthroned as the Qianlong Emperor. On 23 January 1738, Lady Fuca, as the emperor's primary consort, was instated as Empress. That same year the Death of Crown Prince Yonglian struck, the Empress was left heartbroken but since she was the role model of the inner court, she remained strong and continued her duties as Empress of the Great Qing and Fuca Clan but deep inside she was filled with sorrow as her son's death still lingered in her mind for many years. She managed to hide the fact that she was upset from everyone but one, her mother-in-law, Empress Dowager Chongqing, who mentioned once that the Empress' eyes often looked sad. In the Draft History of Qing, Lady Fuca is described as a respected and virtuous person. She looked after the Qianlong Emperor and the people in the palace, and served her role as Empress well. She was praised and favoured by the emperor.Qing Shi Gao vol. 214. It is also said that Lady Fuca did not like spending money for her own good. Instead of wearing jewellery, she would wear artificial flowers in her hair. The Qianlong Emperor once told her a story that Manchus were too poor to make their own pouches from cloth and had to settle for simple deer hide instead. She immediately made one for him. He was touched by the gift. Lady Fuca also made other pouches for him.Ho & Bronson (2004). Lady Fuca took her duties seriously when it came to Confucian rituals. As head of the women's quarters in the palace, she supervised the emperor's consorts when performing a ritual. One of these was a rite concerning sericulture that was presided over by the Empress. This rite, which had been practised since the Zhou dynasty, was gradually restored during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. For the purpose of this rite, a sericulture altar was constructed in 1742. In 1744, a new Altar to Sericulture was completed,Naquin (2000), p. 308. largely at Lady Fuca's urging.Qing liechao houfei zhuan gao, F. 86. Qingchao yeshi daguan, 1.55. That year, Lady Fuca became the first empress in the Qing dynasty to personally lead the women in the palace in these rites. They made offerings of mulberry and presented them to silkworm cocoons, all of them working industriously. The whole rite was painted on four scrolls in 1751 in memory of Lady Fuca.The painting \\"Empress supervising the rites of sericulture\\" hangs in the Palace Museum, Beijing. On 27 May 1746, Lady Fuca gave birth to the emperor's seventh son, Yongcong, Emperor Qianlong had high hopes for Yongcong and crowned him Crown Prince shortly after his birth. However, Yongcong too would die prematurely on 29 January 1748 due to small pox, similar to Yonglian. The death of Yongcong caused the Empress to be heartbroken once more, all hope for Empress Fuca collapsed, the death of her second son left her depressed and also deteriorated her health. Death In 1748, during one of the Qianlong Emperor's southern tours, she became seriously ill and eventually died on 8 April, 3 months after the death of Yongcong. The Empress' funeral was lavishly done. The Emperor was deeply affected and did not take it well. When he found out that two of his sons, Yonghuang and Yongzhang did not mourn for the Empress, he came out with a decree that the both of them would not be allowed to ascend the throne. Court Officials who shaved their hair, which was considered disrespectful as it was forbidden to do so throughout the mourning period, were either heavily punished or executed.

The main character is Zeno Cosini, and the book is the fictional character's memoirs that he keeps at the insistence of his psychiatrist. Throughout the novel, we learn about his father, his business, his wife, and his tobacco habit. The novel was self-published in 1923. The original English translation was published under the title Confessions of Zeno. Plot summary The novel is presented as a diary written by Zeno, published by his doctor (who claims that it is full of lies). The doctor has left a little note in the beginning, saying he had Zeno write an autobiography to help him in his psychoanalysis. The doctor has published the work as revenge for Zeno discontinuing his visits. The diary, however, does not follow the chronological order; instead, it is structured in large chapters, each one developing a particular theme (The smoke addiction, My father's death, History of my marriage and so on). Only the last chapter is a real diary, with pages related to single dates in the period of the First World War. Zeno first writes about his cigarette addiction and cites the first times he smoked. In his first few paragraphs, he remembers his life as a child. One of his friends bought cigarettes for his brother and him. Soon, he steals money from his father to buy tobacco, but finally decides not to do this out of shame. Eventually, he starts to smoke his father's half-smoked cigars instead. The problem with his \\"last cigarette\\" starts when he is twenty. He contracts a fever and his doctor tells him that to heal he must abstain from smoking. He decides smoking is bad for him and smokes his \\"last cigarette\\" so he can quit. However, this is not his last and he soon becomes plagued with \\"last cigarettes.\\" He attempts to quit on days of important events in his life and soon obsessively attempts to quit on the basis of the harmony in the numbers of dates. Each time, the cigarette fails to truly be the last. He goes to doctors and asks friends to help him give up the habit, but to no avail. He even commits himself into a clinic, but escapes. The whole theme, while objectively serious, is often treated in a humorous way. When Zeno reaches middle age, his father's health begins to deteriorate. He starts to live closer to his father in case he passes away. Zeno is very different from his father, who is a serious man, while Zeno likes to joke. For instance, when his father states that Zeno is crazy, Zeno goes to the doctor and gets an official certification that he is sane. He shows this to his father who is hurt by this joke and becomes even more convinced that Zeno must be crazy. His father is also afraid of death, being very uncomfortable with the drafting of his will. One night, his father falls gravely ill and loses consciousness. The doctor comes and works on the patient, who is brought out of the clutches of death momentarily. Over the next few days, his father is able to get up and regains a bit of his self. He is restless and shifts positions for comfort often, even though the doctor says that staying in bed would be good for his circulation. One night, as his father tries to roll out of bed, Zeno blocks him from moving, to do as the doctor wished. His angry father then stands up and accidentally slaps Zeno in the face before dying. His memoirs then trace how he meets his wife. When he is starting to learn about the business world, he meets his future father-in- law Giovanni Malfenti, an intelligent and successful businessman, whom Zeno admires. Malfenti has four daughters, Ada, Augusta, Alberta, and Anna, and when Zeno meets them, he decides that he wants to court Ada because of her beauty and since Alberta is quite young, while he regards Augusta as too plain, and Anna is only a little girl. He is unsuccessful and the Malfentis think that he is actually trying to court Augusta, who had fallen in love with him. He soon meets his rival for Ada's love, who is Guido Speier. Guido speaks perfect Tuscan (while Zeno speaks the dialect of Trieste), is handsome, and has a full head of hair (compared with Zeno's bald head). That evening, while Guido and Zeno both visit the Malfentis, Zeno proposes to Ada and she rejects him for Guido. Zeno then proposes to Alberta, who is not interested in marrying, and he is rejected by her also. Finally, he proposes to Augusta (who knows that Zeno first proposed to the other two) and she accepts, because she loves him. Very soon, the couples get married and Zeno starts to realize that he can love Augusta. This surprises him as his love for her does not diminish. However, he meets Carla, a poor aspiring singer, and they start an affair, with Carla thinking that Zeno does not love his wife. Meanwhile, Ada and Guido marry and Mr. Malfenti gets sick. Zeno's affection for both Augusta and Carla increases and he has a daughter named Antonia around the time Giovanni passes away. Finally, one day, Carla expresses a sudden whim to see Augusta. Zeno deceives Carla and causes her to meet Ada instead. Carla misrepresents Ada as Zeno's wife, and moved by her beauty and sadness, breaks off the affair. Zeno goes on to relate the business partnership between him and Guido. The two men set up a merchant business together in Trieste. They hire two workers named Luciano and Carmen (who becomes Guido's mistress) and they attempt to make as much profit as possible. However, due to Guido's obsession with debts and credit as well as with the notion of profit, the company does poorly. Guido and Ada's marriage begins to crumble as does Ada's health and beauty, due to Morbus Basedowii (Basedow's disease). Guido fakes a suicide attempt to gain Ada's compassion and she asks Zeno to help Guido's failing company. Guido starts playing on the Bourse (stock exchange) and loses even more money. On a fishing trip, he asks Zeno about the differences in effects between sodium veronal and veronal and Zeno answers that sodium veronal is fatal while veronal is not. Guido's gambling on the Bourse becomes very destructive and he finally tries to fake another suicide to gain Ada's compassion. However, he takes a fatal amount of veronal and dies. Soon thereafter, Zeno misses Guido's funeral because he himself gambles Guido's money on the Bourse and recovers three quarters of the losses. Zeno describes his current life. It is during the Great War and his daughter Antonia (who greatly resembles Ada) and son Alfio have grown up. He spends his time visiting doctors, looking for a cure to his imagined sickness. One of the doctors claims he is suffering from the Oedipus complex, but Zeno does not believe it to be true. Not a single doctor is able to treat him. In May 1915 ‚Äì Italy is still neutral, as Zeno wants it to be ‚Äì Zeno and his family spend a vacation on the green banks of the Isonzo. Zeno does not yet guess that area will soon become a major battlefield. Renting a house in the village of Lucinico, Zeno sets out on a casual morning stroll without his hat and jacket ‚Äì when the outbreak of the war between Italy and Austro-Hungary turns the area into a war zone and Zeno is separated from his wife and children by the frontline. He must go back alone to Trieste, only much later finding that Augusta and the children reached Turin safely. The final entry is written in March 1916, when Zeno ‚Äì left alone in wartime Trieste ‚Äì had made much money out of speculation and hoarding, but it did not make him feel happy or pleased with life. He comes to a realization that life itself resembles sickness because it has advancements and setbacks and always ends in death. Human advancement has given mankind not more able bodies, but weapons that can be sold, bought, stolen to prolong life. This deviation from natural selection causes more sickness and weakness in humans. Zeno imagines a time when a person will invent a new, powerful weapon of mass destruction and another will steal it and destroy the world, setting it free of sickness. Trivia * Italo Svevo published the novel with his own money when various companies rejected the manuscript. * James Joyce was a friend of Italo Svevo, to whom he gave English lessons.

With songs by Cole Porter, it stars Judy Garland and Gene Kelly with costars Walter Slezak, Gladys Cooper, Reginald Owen, and George Zucco. Plot Manuela Alva (Judy Garland), who lives in the small Caribbean village of Calvados, dreams of being swept away by the legendary Pirate, Mack \\"the Black\\" Macoco. However, her aunt and uncle (who have raised her) insist that she marry the town mayor, the rotund and bullying Don Pedro (Walter Slezak). Shortly before her wedding, Manuela visits a nearby town, Port Sebastian. A traveling circus has arrived, and Serafin (Gene Kelly), its handsome leader, flirts with all the girls in the song \\"Ni√±a\\". When he encounters Manuela, however, he falls in love with her at first sight. He compliments her beauty and begs her not to marry Don Pedro, but, angered, she hurries away. That night, however, she can't sleep, and sneaks out to go see Serafin's show. At the show, Serafin hypnotizes Manuela, thinking that she will admit that she loves him. Instead, she wildly sings and dances about her love for \\"Mack the Black.\\" Serafin awakens her with a kiss, and she flees in horror. On Manuela's wedding day, the traveling players arrive in Calvados. Serafin begs her to join his troupe, and asks her to admit that she loves him. Don Pedro, hearing noise in her room, arrives at her door, and asks her to go away so that he can teach Serafin a lesson. Serafin recognizes Don Pedro as Macoco, retired and obese. He blackmails Macoco with this information, swearing to tell it to Manuela if Don Pedro forbids the performers from putting on a show. Serafin then decides to pretend to be Macoco in order to win over Manuela. He reveals himself before the whole town as Macoco, then asks Manuela if she will come with him; she again refuses. Still, watching from her window as he dances, she begins to daydream about him. The next day, he threatens to burn down the town if he can't have her. Finally, she happily agrees to go with him. One of Serafin's troupe accidentally reveals his plan to Manuela. To get her revenge, she first pretends to seduce him, then attacks him with words and throws objects. She accidentally knocks him out, then she realizes that she loves him, and sings \\"You Can Do No Wrong.\\" Meanwhile, Don Pedro convinces the viceroy that Serafin is the real Macoco and should hang for it. He plants treasure in Serafin's prop trunk to make him look like a pirate. The army arrests him, and Manuela's protests can't free him. On the night of his hanging, Manuela finally gets to look at the false evidence, and recognizes a bracelet with the same design as the wedding ring that Don Pedro gave her, and realizes that he is the pirate. Serafin asks to do one last show before he is hanged, and sings and dances \\"Be a Clown\\" with two fellow troupe members (the Nicholas Brothers). As a finale, he plans to hypnotize Don Pedro into admitting he is Macoco, but Manuela's aunt uses her parasol to break the mirror that Serafin uses to hypnotize people. Panicked, Manuela pretends to be hypnotized and sings \\"Love of My Life,\\" vowing everlasting devotion to Macoco. Don Pedro, jealous, reveals himself as the true Macoco and seizes her. Serafin's troupe attacks him with all the items and juggling balls, and the lovers embrace. Manuela joins Serafin's act and the film ends with them singing a reprise of \\"Be a Clown.\\" Cast Gene Kelly and Judy Garland * Judy Garland as Manuela * Gene Kelly as Serafin * Walter Slezak as Don Pedro Vargas, a.k.a.

N. Behrman, which had starred Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. Opening at the Martin Beck Theatre on November 25, 1942, The Pirate played for 176 performances before the screen rights were purchased by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $225,000. While the Lunts themselves expressed interest in bringing the story to the screen, MGM envisioned the property as a comedy for William Powell and either Myrna Loy or Hedy Lamarr. Over the next two years, more than a half-dozen scenarists, producers, and directors worked on ideas for developing the property. It was the play's original scenic designer, Lemuel Ayers, who suggested to MGM's preeminent musical producer Arthur Freed that The Pirate would make an effective musical. Freed presented the idea to Judy Garland, his top musical star, and her husband, director Vincente Minnelli. Garland was then at the top of her box-office stature in Hollywood, and Minnelli was the logical choice as director, as he had successfully helmed most of her recent movies (Meet Me In St. Louis, Ziegfeld Follies, and The Clock). Garland was eager to demonstrate her talents as a sophisticated leading comedienne in the same class as Katharine Hepburn, and MGM saw a perfect opportunity to reunite her with Gene Kelly, newly returned from his navy service in World War II and an Academy Award nominee for Best Actor for Anchors Aweigh. Freed engaged legendary composer Cole Porter to write the score for a $100,000 fee, and entrusted Anita Loos and Joseph Than with the film's scenario. They fashioned a role for Lena Horne, that of Conchita, a local dressmaker and Garland's confidante. After five months of work, Loos and Than offered a reading of their script to Freed, Minnelli, Garland, Kelly, and Porter. To the horror of the listeners, the team had produced an awkward, unusable reversal of Behrman's original premise. Although the female lead remained an impressionable Caribbean girl besotted by dreams of a legendary pirate, the leading man was no longer a touring actor impersonating her daring seaman, but a dancing pirate who pretended to be an entertainer. Producer Freed immediately replaced Loos and Than with the great husband and wife team of Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. In two months, they turned in a witty and workable adaptation of the Behrman original, geared to Porter's songs. The role for Horne was dropped from their script. By October 1946, Cole Porter had turned in eight songs and departed for New York. One of these, \\"[It's Chic In] Martinique\\" was dropped when Horne's role was eliminated, but seven other Porter numbers were slotted in the new script. The choreographer, conductor, orchestrator, and vocal arranger comprised a solid crew from the Freed Unit at MGM: Robert Alton, Lennie Hayton, Conrad Salinger, and Kay Thompson. Garland began prerecording the score at the studio on December 27, 1946. Madame Barbara Karinska, the famous costumiere, was engaged to execute the costume designs of Tom Keogh. \\"One of Judy's eight costume designs,\\" said Keogh, \\"was a replica of an 1830 Worth gown. It cost $3,462.23 to make. Another was a white satin wedding dress, with handmade antique lace from France and embroidered with a thousand pearls; it cost $3,313.12. Each of the girl's costumes had five petticoats and all the embroidery was done by hand. The total wardrobe cost was $141,595.30.\\" Leading man Gene Kelly approached his role with enthusiasm. His inspirations for the character of Serafin were his boyhood cinema heroes: the swashbuckling athleticism of Douglas Fairbanks and the hammy flamboyance of John Barrymore. He was also eager to express his characterization through dance on film, using ballet more than he previously had. \\"I wanted the opportunity to do a different kind of dancing,\\" said Kelly, \\"a popular style with a lot of classic form, acrobatics and athletics.\\" An aspiring film director, Kelly also worked closely with Minnelli to learn the technical end of filmmaking behind the camera. Everyone involved in the film's production possessed exemplary credentials: Walter Slezak and Gladys Cooper were cast, respectively, as Don Pedro and Manuela's Aunt Inez; supporting roles were filled with veteran players Reginald Owen, George Zucco, Ben Lessy, and the astounding Nicholas Brothers. Behind the scenes were cameraman Harry Stradling and art director Jack Martin Smith. Principal photography on The Pirate began on February 17, 1947. Almost immediately, the film was beset by problems. Unhappy with Kay Thompson's arrangement of the opening number, \\"Mack The Black\\", Freed ordered the song re-recorded and re-shot. Garland termed Thompson's treatment of the song, \\"insanity\\", and Cole Porter diplomatically offered that the number \\"has me in a dither.\\" Minnelli wanted to expand Kelly's role, and new scenes had to be written and re-shuffled. Elaborate sets were built to Minnelli's exacting instructions. For Kelly's number Nina, a plaza in the town of Calvados was built on a soundstage at MGM, with a pavilion in the middle and the streets unevenly paved with cobblestones for realistic effect. The cost was $86,660.00. Paramount among the problems plaguing the shooting schedule was Judy Garland's increasing inability to perform. Years of overwork at MGM, postpartum depression after the birth of her daughter Liza Minnelli nine months earlier, and a heavy reliance on prescription medication finally caught up with the twenty-five year old star, and she often failed to show up on time for work, if at all. According to her biographer John Fricke, Garland was also unhappy with the way The Pirate was shaping up. Despite her initial enthusiasm to play a character outside her usual winsome all-American roles, Garland \\"began to feel adrift in the imaginative self-indulgence that suddenly surrounded her on the set of The Pirate. Her instincts told her that Minnelli, Kelly, and [Kay] Thompson were unwittingly producing a motion picture for themselves- and for an audience that might not exist.\\" Her marriage to Minnelli began to unravel during the shoot, and her consumption of prescription stimulants and sedatives increased. After suffering a panicked breakdown on the set during the filming of one musical number, Garland was hospitalized for a couple of weeks. The crew and her co-workers were sympathetic to the young woman's travails, testifying that she was not a temperamental star but a talented artist struggling with health issues. Out of 135 days of rehearsals and shooting, Garland was absent for 99. Several songs were cut, and others moved around. Garland and Kelly were to perform a tempestuous dance to \\"Voodoo\\". The sequence was filmed, but MGM executives felt its choreography was too openly sexual for audiences to accept, and they ordered the number removed. When MGM chieftain Louis B. Mayer saw the footage he was so outraged he ordered the negatives to be burned. \\"If that exhibition gets on the screen\\", he shouted, \\"we'll be raided by the police!\\" No known footage of the number is known to exist today. Mayer also protested the erotic flavor of Kelly's \\"The Pirate Ballet\\". Garland's rendition of \\"Love of My Life\\" was excised, leaving only her reprise of the number near the end of the film. Her show-stopping performance of \\"Mack The Black\\" was restaged in a more straightforward musical comedy style. The dancing Nicholas Brothers joined Kelly for the incredible first version of \\"Be A Clown\\", but theater owners in the South removed the number from their prints because white audiences wouldn't watch two African-American dancers performing with a white dancer as equals. The score was nominated for an Academy Award for Original Music Score, losing out to another MGM musical, Easter Parade, also starring Garland and produced by Arthur Freed. The film was shot in Technicolor. Reception On June 11, 1948, the picture finally went into release, costing $3,768,496. It went over its budget by $553,888. Audiences failed to respond to the film's high-brow ambitions, and while many critics hailed its sophistication, box office results failed to follow suit. The British author David Shipman, in his book The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years, described it as being overall \\"a neat moneymaker, but otherwise probably the least successful of Garland's MGM films.\\"David Shipman The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years, London: Macdonald, 1989, p. 249 The New York Times offered, \\"The Pirate, which came yesterday to the Radio City Music Hall, is a dazzling, spectacular extravaganza, shot through with all the colors of the rainbow and then some that Technicolor patented. It takes this mammoth show some time to generate a full head of steam, but when it gets rolling it's thoroughly delightful.\\" The New York Herald Tribune wrote, \\"At the Music Hall there is more dancing than script; more production pomp than sensible staging. But with Gene Kelly hoofing like a dervish, Judy Garland character was to show it was bouncing and how beautiful was.\\" The Chicago Tribune thought, \\"Certainly no effort was spared; the cast is star-studded, and the settings and costumes are strikingly handsome. Yet The Pirate is disappointing, especially in regards to its music. The film has its moments, especially those in which Kelly dominates the screen. Judy Garland handles a song as well as ever and has several excellent comedy scenes.\\" Time advised, \\"As an all-out try at artful movie making, this is among the most interesting pictures of the year. Unluckily, much of the considerable artistry that has gone into this production collides head-on with artiness or is spoiled by simpler kinds of miscalculations. Miss Garland's tense, ardent straightforwardness is sometimes very striking. The total effect of the picture is entertainment troubled by delusions of art and vice-versa.\\" Two years later, director Vincente Minnelli said in an interview to the French film magazine Cahiers du Cinema, \\"I was very pleased with the way the film turned out. Judy gave one of her best performances and the Cole Porter songs were excellent. Unfortunately, the merchandising on the film was bad, and it failed to go over when it was released.\\" Star Gene Kelly told Tony Thomas in 1974, \\"I had decided on this Fairbanks-Barrymore approach to the role at the very start and Minnelli entirely agreed with it. It didn't occur to us until the picture hit the public that what we had done was indulge in a huge inside joke. It was done tongue-in-cheek but it didn't really come off, and that's my fault. But I thought Judy was superb- and what Minnelli did with color and design in that film is as fine as anything that has ever been done.\\" Producer Arthur Freed said in 1969, \\"When we did The Pirate Judy wasn't feeling well. I think it's one of the best pictures she's done. It didn't lose money, but it wasn't the success I hoped it would be. I think one of the reasons was the public didn't want to see Judy as a sophisticate. I think today The Pirate would be a hit. It was twenty years ahead of its time.\\" Composer Cole Porter said later that he felt The Pirate was \\"a $5,000,000 Hollywood picture that was unspeakably wretched, the worst that money could buy.\\" According to MGM accounts, the film earned $1,874,000 in the US and Canada and $782,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss to the studio of $2,290,000.\\"Top Grossers of 1948\\", Variety 5 January 1949 p 46 Garland and Kelly were slated to begin a new musical, Easter Parade after wrapping up their work on The Pirate. With a score by Irving Berlin, and with Freed again producing and Minnelli directing, rehearsals began. But Garland's therapist felt it was unwise to have her husband direct her in another film so soon after The Pirate, so Minnelli was removed as director by Arthur Freed and replaced by Charles Walters. Soon thereafter, Gene Kelly broke his ankle playing softball at home. Freed called Fred Astaire, who had recently retired from the movies. Astaire jumped at the chance of working with Judy Garland for the first time. The shooting of the film went smoothly, coming in ahead of schedule and under budget. When released in July 1948, Easter Parade was a smash-hit, breaking box-office records and putting Garland, Astaire, and everyone involved on a new level of success.

It is situated at the end of the New Brighton branch of the Wirral Line west of Liverpool Lime Street on the Merseyrail network. History The station was built as the terminus of the Wirral Railway's route from Birkenhead Park station, opening in 1888. Through services via the Mersey Railway Tunnel to Liverpool commenced in 1938, when the London Midland and Scottish Railway electrified the line. The station had a goods yard, which closed on 30 October 1965. Between 1960 and 1971, diesel services on the Borderlands Wrexham to Bidston line ran through to New Brighton. This arrangement started when the service was converted to diesel trains and the branch to Seacombe station which was used as the terminus in North Wirral was closed. The service on the last leg from Bidston to New Brighton was very little used, apart from on peak summer days, as most passengers from the west of the Wirral and North Wales were heading for Liverpool or Birkenhead. From 4 January 1971, the service was terminated at Birkenhead North and, from 2 October 1978, the terminus was cut back one more station to Bidston. From 1960, there was a direct diesel service from Chester Northgate station to New Brighton using mainly the Borderlands Line. The service ceased on 9 September 1968, before the closure of Northgate station. The diesel trains normally used the northern face of the island platform at New Brighton, with the electric services using the southern face. In 1983, work started on converting the old station master's house into a music recording studio. The studio opened for business in 1985 and was called Station House Studios.Liverpool Echo, Wednesday January 9th, 1985https://www.discogs.com/label/664783-Stationhouse-Studios  Incidents  In 1986, Gary Kelly, a 16-year-old boy, died from electrocution at the station after fleeing from Akinwale Arobieke, who was believed to have been intimidating him. Arobieke was convicted of manslaughter, but the conviction was quashed on appeal after it was ruled that Arobieke had committed no crime in \\"standing and looking into trains\\". Facilities The station is staffed, during all opening hours, and has platform CCTV. There is a payphone, a station cafe and a vending machine, as well as a waiting room and toilets. There is, also, a booking office, live departure and arrival screens, for passenger information, and the terminus island platform also has a further sheltered waiting area. The station has a drop-off point, and a cycle rack with four spaces and secure cycle storage for 10 cycles. The station has car parking for three vehicles. Both platforms and the ticket office are fully accessible to wheelchair users. Services Current service levels are every 15 minutes to Liverpool during Monday to Saturday daytime, and every 30 minutes at other times. These services are all provided by Merseyrail's fleet of Class 507 and Class 508 EMUs.

It is a conglomerate history of several ethnic groups of Chin people who migrated from Chin State of Burma. But information of their patterns of westward migration are based on oral history and archaeological inferences, hence nothing definite can be said. The recorded history started relatively recently around the mid-19th century when the adjoining regions were occupied by the British monarchy. The land is now inhabited by a mixture of people from Chin Hills and Bangladesh and its history is therefore largely reflected by those of Lusei, Hmar, Lai, Mara and Chakmas tribes. Following religious, political and cultural revolutions in the mid-20th century majority of the people agglomerated into a super tribe, Mizo. Hence the officially recognised settlement of the Mizos became Mizoram. The earliest documented records of Mizoram were from the British military officers in the 1850s, when they encountered series of raids in their official jurisdiction in Chittagong Hill Tracts from the neighbouring natives. By then they referred the land to as Lushai Hills. As a consequence of relentless tribal encroachment and often resulting in human mortality, British rulers were compelled to subjugate the tribal chiefdoms. Punitive British military expeditions in 1871 and 1889 forced the annexation of the entire Lushai Hills. After the Indian independence from British Empire in 1947, the land became Lushai Hills district under the Government of Assam. In 1972 the district was declared a union territory and was given a more culturally inclusive name Mizoram. Ultimately Mizoram became a full-fledged federal state of India in 1986. Origin of the inhabitants The ancestors of Mizos were without any form of written language before the advent of British. They were anthropologically identified as members of the Tibeto-Burman ethnicity. Folk legends unanimously claim that there was Chhinlung or Sinlung at the cradle of the Mizos. Oral history provided contrasting accounts on the origin. # One popular legend tells that the Mizos emerged from under a large covering rock known as Chhinlung (literally \\"rock cover\\"). # Another version says that Chhinlung refers to the Chinese city of Sinlung or Chinlingsang situated close on the Sino-Burmese border. According to Mr. K. S. Latourette, there were political upheavals in China in 210 B.C.E. when the dynastic rule was abolished and the whole empire was brought under one administrative system. The Mizos left China as part of one of those waves of migration. However this is pure speculation. #According to Vumson's Zo history, the earliest ancestor of the mizos was Thlapa,the eldest son of Ngaihte,whose son was Lamhlir and grandson was Seipui/Lusei. # A different story presented by Historians such as Liangkhaia, Hrang·π≠hiauva and Lal Chungnunga is that in Tibet there was born a three brothers named Mizoa, Mirua and Marua. Leading nomadic life they mostly settled in Chinzua (Chen-Yuan) in China. The descendants of Mizoa migrated to Sakai in Burma. In due course of time they had a great chief called Chhinglunga, and his chiefdom came to be known as Chhinlung. Speculated to be in around the 5th century they settled in the Shan State after having overcome the resistance put up by the indigenous people. They thrived in Shan state for about 300 years before they moved on the Kabaw Valley around the 8th century. It was in the Kabaw Valley that Mizos had cultural influence with the local Burmese. It is conceivable that the Mizos learnt the technique of cultivation from the Burmese at Kabaw as many of their agricultural implements bore the prefix Kawl, a name given by the Mizos to the Burmese. Khampat (now in Myanmar) was known to have been the next Mizo settlement. They are said to have planted a banyan tree before they left Khampat as a sign that the town was made by them. In the early 14th century, they moved westward to Indo- Burmese border. They built villages and called them by their clan names such as Seipui, Saihmun and Bochung. The hills and difficult terrains of Chin Hills forced division into several villages and ethnic diaspora arose. Mizo Hills The earliest Mizo people to enter the present Mizoram were known as Kukis, the second batch of Mizo immigrants were called New Kukis. The Lushais were the last of the Mizo tribes to migrate to the Lushai Hills. By the time they crossed the Tiau River bordering Myanmar, the descendants of Zahmuaka, who came to be known as the ruling Sailo clan, had proven their mettle as able and assertive chiefs. The traditional system of village administration, too, had been perfected. As the head of the village, the Chief or Lal allocated lands for cultivation, settled all disputes in the villages, fed and cared for the poor and offered shelter to anyone seeking refuge. The Mizo history in the 18th and 19th centuries is marked by many instances of tribal raids and retaliatory expeditions. Before the British Raj, the various Mizo Tribes and clans lived in autonomous villages. The chief, in the Mizo and other indigenous tribes enjoyed an eminent position in the society. Some chiefs were even raised to the position of a paramount chief or a paramount ruler or king. Under a paramount chief, there were a number of chiefs, of which most of them were brothers and there were few who were adopted as sons by a paramount chief. The position of chieftainship and paramount chieftainship (ruler) is based entirely on hereditary. The youngest son of the paramount chief (king) inherited the land, properties and tributes given to his father and his father's slaves, while the elder brothers got independent rule from their father at different areas of the neighbouring land. His elder brothers who got independent were expected to give warriors to the paramount chief (king) when called for by the paramount chief (king). Warriors of the sons of the paramount chief were called upon, especially when invading other lands. When a tributary chief failed to comply with the request of the paramount chief (king) or failed to pay tributes, their lands were invaded by the combined sons of the paramount chief. Invasion of the British Indian region during the 17th to 19th Century were also carried out by warriors of a paramount chief. These invasions to the British subjects were the result of the British expansion to the elephant hunting grounds of the Mizos. If the paramount chief(king) or chief died before his youngest son was becoming of age, the wife of the paramount chief or wife of the chief would rule the land as regent. Among the Mizo chiefs, the Sailos grew to paramountcy and ruled most of the land of the present day of Mizoram, including various parts of Assam, Manipur, Tripura, Myanmar and Bangladesh. When the British invaded their land, they successfully subjugated every paramount chiefs and chiefs as a result of advancement of the British. The various clans and subclans practiced slash- and-burn, locally called jhum cultivation - a form of subsistence agriculture. The chiefs were the absolute rulers within their territories (ram), the chief and their warriors claimed their territories and also increased their territories by conquest. While claiming their land, the mizo warrior would always invade some parts of modern Assam, Tripura and Manipur. The British Administrators and authors often wrote about the Head-hunting practices of the Mizos. Most of the territories claimed by the mizo chiefs are present in the state of Mizoram. But some territories are in the present Assam, Tripura, Manipur, Bangladesh and Myanmar. There were many instances of tribal raids and head-hunting led by the village chieftains. Head-hunting was a practice which involved ambushing, taking slaves and decapitating heads of fighters from the enemy tribe, bringing it back home, and displaying it at the entrance of the tribal village. British rule =Initial encounters= By the mid-19th century British Empire had occupied all the surrounding Chittagong and Burma but had little or no interest in the tribes or their hilly land. They were merely mentioned in passing as \\"irreclaimable savages\\". The tribals then lived in small and isolated clusters of chiefdoms, each often raising warfare against another. Their religious lives were dominated by paganism and they led animistic world view, with unique concept of afterlife called Pialral. They practised elaborate rituals including animal sacrifice, and worshipped or feared almost all conceivable inanimate objects, diseases and unusual natural phenomena. The first Lushai (the British misnomer for Lusei) raid recorded in British governed Assam was in 1826. From that year to 1850 the local officers were unable to restrain the fierce attacks of the hillmen on the south. Raids and outrages were of yearly occurrence, and on one occasion the Magistrate of Sylhet reported a series of massacres by \\"Kookies\\" in what was alleged to be British territory, in which 150 persons had been killed. The raid was most severe in 1871 when a series of attacks caused several deaths on both sides, with extensive damage on the plantations. A number of workers and soldiers were taken prisoners, and among them a six-year-old Mary Winchester. Mary Winchester was taken as hostage by Bengkhuaia warriors, while other prisoners were executed on the way. =British military expeditions= To retaliate the British military organised punitive expedition named Lushai Expedition in 1871‚Äì1872. The campaign consisted two columns, the right advancing from Chittagong and the left from Cachar. General Brownlow, C.B., commanded the former, with Captain T.H. Lewin, Superintendent of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, as Civil Officer. The Cachar column was led by General Bourchier, C.B., with Mr. Edgar, Deputy Commissioner, Cachar, as Civil Officer. In addition, a contingent of Manipuris accompanied by Colonel James Nuttall, the Political Agent of Manipur, made a demonstration across the southern border to co- operate with General Bourchier's portion of the expedition. The expedition started on 15 December 1871. The Mizo villages were crushed one by one, and Mary Winchester was rescued. Mizo chiefs made a truce not to make further attacks. Frontier posts were built to protect the border and bazaars were opened to encourage the Lushais to trade After a decade the truce was broken, and there erupted intermittent raids again. In 1889 British military organised another punitive expedition code named \\"The Expedition of 1889\\". It was commanded b Col. F.V.C. Tregear. From their camping site at Chawngte they started on 19 December 1888. They easily penetrated the southern villages with little resistance. They fortified at Lunglei and prepared locations and roads for the next expedition. After their completing their mission, they returned in April 1889. Then the major campaign called The Chin-Lushai Expedition 1889-90 immediately followed. Again divided into two columns, Chittagong column was commanded by Col. Tregear, and Cachar column by W.W. Daly. The Chittagong column occupied most of the southern region including Chin Hills by the end of 1889. The Cachar column camped at Aijal (now Aizawl) on 30 January 1890. They subjugated all the major chiefdoms, captured the chiefs and got permanently fortified in Aizawl and Lunglei, as the administrative centres. =Lushai Hills= Mizo Hills were formally declared as part of British India by a proclamation in 1895. North and south hills were united into Lushai Hills district in 1898 with Aizawl as its headquarters. The process of the consolidation of the British administration in tribal dominated area in Assam started in 1919 when Lushai Hills, along with some of the other hill districts, was declared a \\"Backward Tract\\" under the 1919 Government of India Act. The tribal districts of Assam including Lushai Hills were declared \\"Excluded Area\\" in 1935. It was during the British regime that a political awakening among the Mizos in Lushai Hills started taking shape the first political party, the Mizo Common People's Union was formed on 9 April 1946. The Party was later renamed the Mizo Union. As the day of Independence drew nearer, the Constituent Assembly of India set up an advisory committee to deal with matters relating to the minorities and the tribal members. A sub- committee, under the chairmanship of Gopinath Bordoloi was formed to advise the Constituent Assembly on the tribal affairs in the North East. The Mizo Union submitted a resolution of this Sub-committee demanding inclusion of all Mizo-inhabited areas adjacent to Lushai Hills. However, a new party called the United Mizo Freedom Organisation (UMFO) came up to demand that Lushai Hills join Burma after Independence. Christianity and education The Mizo ancestors had no written language and in terms of religion they worshiped nature and revered natural phenomena. The first missionary who came to Lushai Hills was Rev. William Williams, a Welsh missionary who at that time was working in Khasi Hills (now Meghalaya). However he came only on an investigative visit for a week in March 1891. On 11 January 1894, F.W. Savidge and J.H. Lorrain, commissioned by Arthington Aborigines Mission, arrived at Aizawl. This marked the origin of formal education and Christianity in Mizoram. They made camp at Thingpui Huan Tlang (\\"Tea Graden\\"), MacDonald Hill, Zarkawt. They immediately worked on creating Mizo alphabets based on Roman script. After only two and half months, Savidge started the first school on 1 April 1894. Their first and only pupils were Suaka and Thangphunga. They translated and published the Gospels of Luke and John, and Acts of the Apostles. They also prepared A Grammar and Dictionary of the Lushai language (Dulien Dialect) which they published in 1898, and became the foundation of Mizo language. In 1903 Baptist Missionary Society (BMS) of London set up Baptist church by sending Lorrain and Savidge at Serkawn, near Lunglei. From there they expanded the church, education and health services. Rev. Reginald Arthur Lorrain, younger brother of Rev. J.H. Lorrain and founder of the Evangelical Church of Maraland was the first pioneering missionary to the Mara people at the southern extreme of Lushai Hills. He entered Maraland (now includes southern end of Mizoram and adjoining Chin State of Burma) and settled at Serkawr (Saikao) village on 26 September 1907. Lorrain created alphabets, prepared Bible and textbooks in Mara. With his mission the task of evangelising and educating the mass of the Mizo people was complete. Lushai Hills District Following the Bordoloi sub-committee's suggestion, a certain amount of autonomy was accepted by the government and enshrined in the Six Schedule of the Indian Constitution. The Lushai Hills Autonomous District Council came into being in 1952 followed by the formation of these bodies led to the abolition of chieftainship in the Mizo society. The autonomy however met the aspirations of the Mizos only partially. Representatives of the District Council and the Mizo Union pleaded with the States Reorganization Commission (SRC) in 1954 for integration of the Mizo-dominated areas of Tripura and Manipur with their District Council in Assam. The tribal leaders in the northeast were laboriously unhappy with the SRC recommendations. They met in Aizawl in 1955 and formed a new political party, Eastern India Union (EITU) and raised their demand for a separate state comprising all the hill districts of Assam. The Mizo Union split and the breakaway faction joined the EITU. By this time, the UMFO also joined the EITU and then understanding of the Hill problems by the Chuliha Ministry, the demand for a separate Hill state by EITU was kept in abeyance. Mautam famine In 1959, Mizo Hills was devastated by a great famine known in Mizo history as 'Mautam Famine'. The cause of the famine was attributed to flowering of bamboos which resulted in boom in the rat population. It caused mass destruction of food stores and crops. A number of people died of starvation. Earlier in 1955, Mizo Cultural Society was formed with Pu Laldenga as its secretary. In March 1960, the name of the Mizo Cultural Society was changed to 'Mautam Front' to fight against the famine. In September 1960, the Society adopted the name of Mizo National Famine Front (MNFF). The MNFF gained considerable popularity as a large number of Mizo Youth assisted in transporting rice and other essential commodities to interior villages. Insurgency After recovery from the disaster the Mizo National Famine Front was changed to a new political organisation, the Mizo National Front (MNF) on 22 October 1961. The specified goal was sovereign independence of Greater Mizoram. It resorted to armed insurrection with the 28 February 1966 uprising against the Government, attacking the government installations at Aizawl, Lunglei, Chawngte, Chhimluang and other places. In Aizawl, on 5 and 6 March 1966, the Government of India bombed the city of Aizawl with Toofani and Hunter Jet fighters, this was the first time India used its air force to quell a movement of any kind among its citizens. \\"The next day, a more excessive bombing took place for several hours which left most houses in Dawrpui and Chhinga veng area in ashes\\", recollected 62-year- old Rothangpuia in Aizawl.http://www.newslink.in/2007/03/06/memories-of- inferno-still-remain-fresh The Mizo National Front was outlawed in 1967 and the demand for statehood increased. The Mizo District Council delegation met prime minister Indira Gandhi in May 1971 and demanded full-fledged statehood for Mizoram. The Indian government offered to convert the Mizo Hills into a Union Territory (U.T.) in July 1971. On 21 January 1972 official declaration of UT was made with the name Mizoram. Mizoram was allotted two seats in Parliament, one each in the Lok Sabha and in the Rajya Sabha. Birth of Mizoram state Election of Rajiv Gandhi to the office of Prime Minister of India in 1984 incited the beginning of a new era in Indian politics. Laldenga met the prime minister on 15 February 1985. Terms of negotiations were resolved between the two parties. The Mizoram Peace Accord (the official document entitled Mizoram Accord, 1986, Memorandum of Settlement) was therefore signed between the Mizo National Front and the Union Government on 30 June 1986. Signatories were Pu Laldenga from MNF, the Union Home Secretary R.D. Pradhan on behalf of the government and Lalkhama, Chief Secretary of Mizoram. Statehood was a prerequisite of the accord so that Mizoram became a federal state of India on 20 February 1987.

Though there is evidence to suggest that a martyr named Pantaleon existed, some consider the stories of his life and death to be purely legendary. Life of Pantaleon According to the martyrologies, Pantaleon was the son of a rich pagan, Eustorgius of Nicomedia, and had been instructed in Christianity by his Christian mother, Saint Eubula; however, after her death he fell away from the Christian church, while he studied medicine with a renowned physician Euphrosinos; under the patronage of Euphrosinos he became physician to the emperor, Galerius. St Pantaleon on a tenth-century Byzantine ceramic tile in the State Historical Museum, Moscow Church of St. Panteleimon in Gorno Nerezi, Skopje, North Macedonia Church of St. Panteleimon, built in 1735‚Äì1739, is one of the oldest in St. Petersburg He was won back to Christianity by Saint Hermolaus (characterized as a bishop of the church at Nicomedia in the later literature), who convinced him that Christ was the better physician, signalling the significance of the exemplum of Pantaleon that faith is to be trusted over medical advice. St. Alphonsus Liguori wrote regarding this incident: > He studied medicine with such success, that the Emperor Maximian appointed > him his physician. One day as our saint was discoursing with a holy priest > named Hermolaus, the latter, after praising the study of medicine, concluded > thus: \\"But, my friend, of what use are all thy acquirements in this art, > since thou art ignorant of the science of salvation? By miraculously healing a blind man by invoking the name of Jesus over him, Pantaleon converted his father, upon whose death he came into possession of a large fortune. He freed his slaves and, distributing his wealth among the poor, developed a great reputation in Nicomedia. Envious colleagues denounced him to the emperor during the Diocletian persecution. The emperor wished to save him and sought to persuade him to apostasy. Pantaleon, however, openly confessed his faith, and as proof that Christ was the true God, he healed a paralytic. Notwithstanding this, he was condemned to death by the emperor, who regarded the miracle as an exhibition of magic. According to the legend, Pantaleon's flesh was first burned with torches, whereupon Christ appeared to all in the form of Hermolaus to strengthen and heal Pantaleon. The torches were extinguished. Then a bath of molten lead was prepared; when the apparition of Christ stepped into the cauldron with him, the fire went out and the lead became cold. Pantaleon was now thrown into the sea, loaded with a great stone, which floated. He was thrown to wild beasts, but these fawned upon him and could not be forced away until he had blessed them. He was bound on the wheel, but the ropes snapped, and the wheel broke. An attempt was made to behead him, but the sword bent, and the executioners were converted to Christianity. Pantaleon implored Heaven to forgive them, for which reason he also received the name of Panteleimon (\\"mercy for everyone\\" or \\"all- compassionate\\"). It was not until he himself desired it that it was possible to behead him, upon which there issued forth blood and a white liquid like milk. St. Alphonsus wrote: > At Ravello, a city in the kingdom of Naples, there is a vial of his blood, > which becomes blood every year [on his feastday], and may be seen in this > state interspersed with the milk, as I, the author of this work, have seen > it. Early veneration The vitae containing these miraculous features are all late in date and \\"valueless\\" according to the Catholic Encyclopedia. Yet the fact of his martyrdom itself seems to be supported by a veneration for which there is testimony in the 5th century, among others in a sermon on the martyrs by Theodoret (died c. 457);Graecarum affectionum curatio, Sermo VIII, \\"De martyribus\\", published in Migne, Patrologia Graeca, LXXXIII 1033 Procopius of Caesarea (died c. 565?), writing on the churches and shrines constructed by Justinian IDe aedificiis Justiniani (I, ix; V, ix) tells that the emperor rebuilt the shrine to Pantaleon at Nicomedia; and there is mention of Pantaleon in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum.Bollandists' Acta Sanctorum for November, II, 1, 97 Veneration in the East Panteleimon, is shown here with a lancet in his right hand. This tile probably formed a frieze on a church wall or altar screen. The Walters Art Museum. The Eastern tradition concerning Pantaleon follows more or less the medieval Western hagiography, but lacks any mention of a visible apparition of Christ. It states instead that Hermolaus was still alive while Pantaleon's torture was under way, but was martyred himself only shortly before Pantaleon's beheading along with two companions, Hermippas and Thermocrates. The saint is canonically depicted as a beardless young man with a full head of curly hair. Pantaleon's relics, venerated at Nicomedia, were transferred to Constantinople. Numerous churches, shrines, and monasteries have been named for him; in the West most often as St. Pantaleon and in the East as St. Panteleimon; to him is consecrated the St. Panteleimon Monastery at Mount Athos, Agios Panteleimon Monastery in Crete, St Panteleimon monastery in Myrtou, Cyprus, and the 12th-century Church of St. Panteleimon in Gorno Nerezi, North Macedonia. Armenians believe that the Amaras Monastery in Nagorno Karabakh contains relics of St. Pantaleon, who was venerated in eastern provinces of Armenia. Veneration in Western Europe After the Black Death of the mid-14th century in Western Europe, as a patron saint of physicians and midwives, he came to be regarded as one of the fourteen guardian martyrs, the Fourteen Holy Helpers. Relics of the saint are found at Saint Denis at Paris; his head is venerated at Lyon. A Romanesque church was dedicated to him in Cologne in the 9th century at the latest. =England= In the British Library there is a surviving manuscript, written in Old English, of The Life of St Pantaleon (British Library, MS Cotton Vitellius D XVII), dating from the early eleventh century, possibly written for Abbot √Ülfric of Eynsham.Joana Proud, 'The Old English 'Life of Saint Pantaleon' and its manuscript context' in Bulletin of the John Rylands Library (1997, vol. 79, no. 3, pp.119-132 The Canons' Vestry off the south transept of Chichester Cathedral was formerly a square-plan chapel dedicated to Saint Pantaleon - it was possibly under construction just before the cathedral's great fire of 1187. =France= In France, he was depicted in a window in Chartres Cathedral. In southern France there are six communes under the protective name of Saint-Pantal√©on. Though there are individual churches consecrated to him elsewhere, there are no communes named for him in the north or northwest of France. The six are: * Saint-Pantal√©on, in the Lot d√©partement, Midi-Pyr√©n√©es * Saint-Pantal√©on, in the Vaucluse d√©partement, Provence - a wine-growing village * Saint-Pantal√©on-de-Lapleau, in the Corr√®ze d√©partement, Limousin * Saint-Pantal√©on-de-Larche, in the Corr√®ze d√©partement, at the border of P√©rigord and Quercy * Saint-Pantal√©on-les-Vignes, in the Dr√¥me d√©partement, Rh√¥ne-Alpes ‚Äì a wine-growing villagehttp://www.cave-st-pantaleon.com that is part of the C√¥tes du Rh√¥ne vinyard region * Saint-Pantal√©on, in the Sa√¥ne-et- Loire d√©partement, Bourgogne ‚Äì administratively linked to Autun, bishopric see =Germany= In Cologne a 10th Century Romanesque church, partly built by the daughter of the Byzantine emperor, Theophanu, who married the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II in 972 * Saint Pantaleon, in Cologne At the Basilica of the Vierzehnheiligen near Staffelstein in Franconia, St. Pantaleon is venerated with his hands nailed to his head, reflecting another legend about his death. =Italy= In Italy, Pantaleon gives favourable lottery numbers, victories and winners in dreams. A phial containing some of his blood was long preserved at Ravello. On the feast day of the saint, the blood was said to become fluid and to bubble (compare Saint Januarius). Paolo Veronese's painting of Pantaleon can be found in the church of San Pantalon in Venice; it shows the saint healing a child. Another painting of Pantaleon by Fumiani is also in the same church. He was depicted in an 8th-century fresco in Santa Maria Antiqua in Rome, and in a 10th-century cycle of pictures in the crypt of San Crisogono in Rome. In Calabria, there is a small town named Papanice, after Pantaleon. Each year on his feast day, a statue of the saint is carried through the town to give a blessing for all those who seek it. San Pantaleone or Pantalone was a popular saint in Venice, and he therefore gave his name to a character in the commedia dell'arte, Pantalone, a silly, wizened old man (Shakespeare's \\"lean and slippered Pantaloon\\") who was a caricature of Venetians. This character was portrayed as wearing trousers rather than knee breeches, and so became the origin of the name of a type of trouser called \\"pantaloons,\\" which was later shortened to \\"pants\\". =Portugal= Saint Pantaleon (S√£o Pantale√£o in Portuguese) is one of the patron saints of the city of Porto in Portugal, together with John the Baptist and Our Lady of Vendome. Part of his relics were brought by Armenian refugees to the city after the Turkish occupation of Constantinople in 1453. Later, in 1499, these relics were transferred from the Church of Saint Peter of Miragaia to the cathedral, where they have been kept to this day.

He was best known as a former member and lead singer of boy band Five. He was the oldest member of the band, which also included Sean Conlon, Ritchie Neville, Abz Love and Scott Robinson. In 2012, it was announced that Five, along with 911, Atomic Kitten, B*Witched, Honeyz and Liberty X, would be reuniting for the ITV2 reality series The Big Reunion, and although Brown initially agreed to take part in the reunion, he later backed out, claiming that he no longer wants to be in the public eye. Early life and Five Brown was born at the Cambridge Military Hospital at Aldershot, and as a child he lived in Germany, Canada and all over the north of England. He spent his teenage and young adult life in Warrington and Newton-le-Willows before joining Five. Five were internationally successful, selling more than 20 million records over a period of five years. As the oldest member of Five, Brown took a leading role as a dominant figure within the band, and he performed several rap verses on their songs. After the group's dissolution in 2001, it was alleged by Sean Conlon that Brown's treatment of him partially contributed to him leaving the band prior to the release of their third album Kingsize. Attempted comeback and I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! After Five disbanded in late 2001, Brown kept a low profile, although he was involved in several protests in the London area, notably against UK involvement in the wars in the Middle East. In 2006 he joined up with three of his former bandmates, Robinson, Neville and Love (fifth member Conlon was committed to a Sony contract and decided not join them) for a planned relaunch of the band. However, not enough record company interest was generated, and Five's comeback was abandoned less than nine months later. Soon after Five's relaunch plan was abandoned, Brown became a contestant on the seventh series of ITV's I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. He made it into the final along with Christopher Biggins and Janice Dickinson, and finished in third place. He also appeared as a part of Anthony McPartlin's team on Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway (February ‚Äì March 2008). Soon after he appeared on Fiver's Generation Sex, he has recently become involved in writing/producing for other musicians. Second Five comeback After Brown's ex-bandmate Conlon appeared on The Voice UK on 24 March 2012 and failed to make it past the audition stage, discussions were had between the former bandmates about the possibility of a second reunion. Five later announced that they would be reforming for the ITV2 series The Big Reunion, but at the last minute, Brown pulled out of the reunion and refused to be part of the show, claiming that he no longer wants to be in the public eye. The Big Reunion: On Tour, an additional mini-series featuring the bands as they embarked on their arena tour, began airing on ITV2 on 5 September 2013. Brown refused to appear in the first series of The Big Reunion and only popped up in the second for a right- to-reply interview, where, aside from speaking about his shock and confusion at the anger aimed towards him, he also revealed a suicide attempt. He acknowledged his behaviour could have been seen as loud and overbearing, but he denied bullying Conlon. During a meeting with former bandmate Abz Love, Brown explained he has moved on and that he does not feel comfortable returning to Five.

The centre is named in honour of Sir Peter MacCallum. Since June 2016, the centre has been located within the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre (VCCC) in . The centre is Australia's first public hospital dedicated to cancer treatment, research and education. Research programs at the centre include the Australian Cancer Research Foundation (ACRF) Cancer Cell Biology Program and the ACRF Victorian Centre for Functional Genomics in Cancer. History In 1949 the Victorian Cancer Institute was established and the following year its outpatient services were named the \\"Peter MacCallum Clinic\\". It was named after the (then) dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Melbourne University, Peter MacCallum who, with Rutherford Kaye-Scott, had a significant role in its founding. At the time it was a common practice not to inform patients that they had cancer. It was thought that because radiotherapy was also quite commonly used at that time to treat non-cancerous conditions such as severe acne, \\"strawberry birthmarks\\", frozen shoulders, keloid scars and also to provide a valuable and non-invasive means for medical sterilisation, the name \\"Peter MacCallum Clinic\\" was considered less threatening because the clinic could be positioned as a specialist radiotherapeutic centre rather than it being thought of as a dedicated cancer hospital. The clinic was originally located in a single room of the Queen Victoria Hospital in central Melbourne. Its main facility was based at the corner William Street and Little Lonsdale Street, near Flagstaff Gardens where the County Court of Victoria buildings were later built. (The site was also at one time home to the Jessie McPherson Private Hospital.) The Institute established Australia's first training school for radiotherapists. In 1986, the institute (and the clinic) were collectively renamed as the \\"Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute\\". By 1994, the institute was operating out of 11 sites across Melbourne. At this time, it moved into St Andrew's Hospital in , having been purchased from the Uniting Church of Australia and Presbyterian Church of Victoria by the state government in 1990. Location The former Peter Mac site in In June 2016, the institute moved to the purpose- built building at the entrance to Melbourne's Parkville bio-medical precinct, located at 305 Grattan Street, Melbourne, with satellite services at the Bendigo Base Hospital, Epworth Eastern, the Monash Medical Centre (Moorabbin campus in East Bentleigh) and Sunshine Hospital in St Albans. It involves some shared services with the nearby Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Royal Women's Hospital and the Royal Children's Hospital.

Operations Clarence Frederick Booth founded the business in 1920, as a metal purchaser and trader. Over the company's history, there have been a number of associated sites and businesses including: a rail served site in Doncaster (closed); and a site in Aston, near Rotherham, which concentrated on dismantling buses. Today the company's main site is the Clarence Metal Works, located on the residual southern section of the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway adjacent to the Rotherham Ring Road. Obtained in the 1960s, the railway embankment was removed and the ground level access allowed for easier dismantling of redundant diesel and electric locomotives. This work continues at present, although a number of the vehicles bought are now resold for preservation. Many wagons, carriages, underground and departmental stock are also processed here. C F Booth was involved in one of the most high-profile scrapping contracts for British Rail of all time, with the media descending on the site for the arrival and scrapping of several vehicles from the APT fleet in 1987. Rail vehicles can still be brought in through a connection to Network Rail, although much is now brought in by road. Cable and electrical equipment is also a significant part of the business, but the interest in the railway activities and the proximity of the railway sidings to roads give this side of the business a high-profile. Present The Clarence Works site is essentially a scrapyard for ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and non-ferrous Melting Shop. The company's gantry cranes and three Derrick cranes make the site quite distinctive. In 1989 the company introduced a copper alloy melting division, to service the foundry industry with copper-based ingots for re-melting purposes. Today it is one of the largest manufacturers of copper based products in the United Kingdom. The firm also provides machining services on large billet and slab metal sections, which supply customers in the marine, oil and gas and defence industries. In 2012 the company achieved the Queens Award for International Trade. Company turnover is circa ¬£170 million. Millmoor In 1987, Ken Booth bought Rotherham United F.C. out of administration. For 17 years, the Booth family owned the club, with Booth chairman. After the collapse of the ITV Digital deal, and with club debts at ¬£3 million, the family sold the club for a nominal ¬£1 in December 2004 to a group of supporters led by solicitor Peter Ruchniewicz, in returning for gaining ownership of the club's ground at Millmoor (located adjacent to the firms main scrapyard, the Clarence Metal Works), the Tivoli nightclub in front of it and the Hooton Lodge training ground. The club paid the Booths ¬£200,000 per annum in rent, and were responsible for the grounds maintenance and up keep. The club started a ground upgrade programme, but came into dispute with the Booth's over the lease period and additional fees, which included: 30 free tickets to every home match, with entertainment; advertising in the ground; and first call on away tickets and FA Cup final tickets. In May 2008, Rotherham United left Millmoor after talks with Ken Booth broke down. The team moved to the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield until 2012, when the club moved into a new community stadium in Rotherham. Millmoor is currently unused apart from its car park which has been used by C F Booth as an overspill and storage area for former tube trains awaiting scrapping.

There, at the age of 18, he joined the ZwiƒÖzek Walki Czynnej and the ZwiƒÖzek Strzelecki. After the outbreak of The Great War, on September 1, 1914, he joined the Polish Legions. In 1915 he was promoted to first lieutenant and then to captain. He commanded a company of infantry in the 2nd Legions Infantry Regiment and then in 5th Infantry Regiment. Wounded in July 1916, during the battle of Op≈Çowa he was taken prisoner of war by the Russians. However, Zulauf managed to escape from captivity and cross the front lines to rejoin the Polish Legions. After the Oath Crisis of 1917 he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army. After Poland was reestablished in 1918, Juliusz Zulauf returned to his hometown, where he joined the Polish Army and took part in the defence of Lw√≥w during the Polish-Ukrainian War. On May 11, 1919, he was given the command of the Polish 4th Legions Infantry Regiment and took part in the opening stages of the Polish-Bolshevik War. Heavily wounded in August of that year, he quickly recovered. However, he did not reassume his former post and instead became the commanding officer of the garrison of Radom on October 1 of that year. After the cease fire agreement, on March 23, 1921, he became a peacetime commander of the 28th Kani√≥w Rifles Infantry Regiment and, since September 28 of that year, commanding officer of the 19th Infantry Regiment. Promoted to colonel in 1923, between 1926 and 1927 Zulauf commanded the 3rd Infantry Regiment, only to be promoted to the commander of infantry of the 5th Infantry Division. He held that post until April 1930, when he was promoted to commanding officer of the prestigious Polish 2nd Legions Infantry Division stationed in Kielce. For his service on January 1, 1932, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. From 1937 on, he commanded the Lw√≥w-based 5th Infantry Division and with that unit he was active during the Invasion of Poland. After heavy fighting, his division was reduced to only one regiment, but managed to break through to Warsaw and took part in the defence of the Polish capital as part of the Warszawa Army. From September 14, Zulauf commanded the eastern perimeter of Warsaw's defences, in the city's easternmost district, Praga. After Warsaw's capitulation (September 28), Zulauf was taken prisoner of war by the Germans. He died May 21, 1943 at Oflag VIIA in Murnau. His daughter Irena has donated many of Zulauf's personal belongings to the Kielce municipal museum.

Course of events The 19:31 freight train from Ellesmere Port to Mold Junction consisted of 38 wagons hauled by a Class 24 diesel locomotive no. 5028. The first five wagons were tank wagons containing kerosene, petrol and gas oil. At around 20:50 the train was approaching Chester on a 1 in 100 falling gradient when the driver discovered that the brakes had failed. It ran past a signal at danger and through a set of points which were set for no. 11 bay platform, where an empty diesel multiple unit was standing. As there was nothing more he could do, the driver jumped out onto the platform with the train still travelling at around 20 mph. It ploughed straight into the DMU and completely destroyed the first coach. The second coach was torn from its bogies and thrown up onto the platform where it demolished the refreshment room wall. There were very few people on that part of the station, although the staff in the refreshment room had to shelter themselves from falling masonry. A major fire broke out when the burst fuel tanks of the trains ignited, but the fire brigade were based nearby and arrived within a couple of minutes. They were able to rescue a trapped postal worker and evacuated several passengers from an adjacent lightly loaded train before it too was engulfed by the fire. Damage caused to the trains was severe, especially after petrol from two of the tank wagons began to boil and was forced out of the pressure relief valves, whereupon it ignited. The fire was not extinguished until 00:20 the following day. The trains involved were all written off and a section of the station roof was damaged and consequently removed. Causes The first eight wagons were equipped with the vacuum brake but the pipes had not been connected. The train had run from Ellesmere Port as an unbraked freight train and stopped at Helsby, where it needed to reverse. The guard had forgotten to connect the vacuum pipes when the locomotive coupled up to the opposite end of the train, so that extra brake power was not available on the falling gradient into Chester. The driver had also omitted to carry out a brake test before departure. External links * YouTube video showing the damage caused by the crash.

It sounds as if either the tape was manually altered during recording of the song live or (more likely), in the studio. It's akin to a power drop affecting the recording. Also the e.q. and sound levels throughout the album are inconsistent. Again it's noticeable more from transitions from some songs. E.g. '..shadows' to 'walk on by' have completely different e.q. and balance. Although this can be a bit jarring in places, it adds to the rough hewn (and punky) feel of the album as a whole.

Early in the 11th century, Sigmundur, whose family had flourished in the southern islands but had been almost exterminated by invaders from the north, was sent back to the Faroe Islands, whence he had escaped, to take possession of the islands for Olaf Tryggvason, king of Norway. Sigmundur was the first Faroe-man to convert to the Christian faith, bringing Christianity to the Faroes at the decree of Olaf Tryggvason. Initially Sigmundur sought to convert the islanders by reading the decree to the Alting in T√≥rshavn, but was nearly killed by the resulting angry mob.

She was named for Charles W. Flusser. History Flusser was launched 28 September 1935 by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, New Jersey; sponsored by Mrs. F. W. Packard; and commissioned 1 October 1936, Commander F. L. Lowe in command. Flusser sailed from New York 1 December 1936 for a shakedown cruise which found her operating with Squadron 40-T, a unit formed to protect American interests in the Western Mediterranean during the Spanish Civil War. She returned to Hampton Roads 9 February 1937, and for the next 5 months operated along the east coast as far north as Maine. On 16 July, she arrived at San Diego, California, her base for Pacific and Caribbean operations until October 1939, aside from a 2-week visit to Washington earlier that year. World War II Based at Pearl Harbor, she took part in intensive training operations with ships of all types, and on 5 December 1941 put to sea screening Lexington (CV-2). Thus away from base at the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Flusser's force sought the retiring Japanese after the attack, then returned to their devastated home port 12 December. Through April 1942, Flusser sailed on convoy escort duty between Pearl Harbor and the west coast, and then cleared for Palmyra Atoll, where on 21 April she landed a small marine garrison. Continuing on, she began a period of escort and patrol service out of various southwest Pacific ports, on several occasions putting into Australian ports. Overhauled at Pearl Harbor between July 1942 and February 1943, Flusser returned to escort, antisubmarine, and training operations in the southern Solomon Islands. After replenishing at Pearl Harbor between 25 July and 4 August 1942, Flusser returned to Efate 17 August to resume escort and patrol operations to the Fiji Islands, Espiritu Santo, Samoa, and Tonga, returning to Pearl Harbor for overhaul between September and February 1943. Once more at Espiritu Santo 17 February, Flusser again escorted convoys of auxiliaries as well as warships among southwest Pacific bases, to and from Australia, and to Guadalcanal. She returned from Australia to Milne Bay 22 August, and based here for the New Guinea operation. Participating in the landings at Lae and Finschhafen, she conducted preinvasion bombardment, gave fire support cover to the assaults, escorted reinforcement and re-supply convoys, and on 22 September, attacked and sank three Japanese barges at Finschhafen. Flusser next participated in the bombardment and landing at Arawe, New Britain, and had similar duty in the occupation of Cape Gloucester and Saidor. =1944 ‚Äì 1945= From 11 January 1944 to 30 January, Flusser had a brief overhaul; she then took part in exercises in Australian waters, returning to Milne Bay for duty escorting convoys to Saidor and Cape Gloucester, and taking part in the landings on Los Negros, Admiralty Islands. Her constant activity in the New Guinea area made a west coast overhaul imperative, and she received this at Mare Island between April and June. Departing Pearl Harbor 1 August 1944, Flusser escorted a convoy to Eniwetok, and arrived at Majuro 16 August for 6 weeks of duty patrolling off the bypassed Japanese-held atolls in the southern Marshall Islands. On 7 September, in an engagement with a shore battery on Wotje, nine of her men were wounded. Leaving Majuro 1 October on escort duty to Eniwetok, Ulithi, and Hollandia, she sailed north for San Pedro Bay, arriving 29 October for patrol duty in Leyte Gulf and Surigao Strait. On 18 November, she shot down a kamikaze plane, which crashed so close aboard that the pilot's parachute landed on the ship's forecastle. Continuing her support of the Philippines operation, Flusser escorted reinforcement convoys to Leyte from Hollandia, and on 4 December 1944, received damage from the near miss of a Japanese suicide plane. A heavy air attack was launched at her group the next day, during which Flusser downed several planes, and rescued survivors of LSM-20 following a kamikaze attack. The destroyer sailed from Leyte 6 December to cover the landings at Ormoc Bay, and next day her group was attacked by the first of many waves of suicide planes. Flusser shot down at least one of these, and aided survivors of stricken ships, screening Lamson (DD-367) back to San Pedro. Flusser sailed to Hollandia and Biak to prepare for the Lingayen operation, and arrived in Lingayen Gulf escorting the second group of reinforcements 13 January 1945. She covered the landings at Nasugbu on 31 January, then participated in the assault at Puerto Princesa, Palawan, as well as convoying escort forces between Leyte, Mindoro, and Palawan. Flusser remained in the Philippines, joining in the landings on Cebu 26 March 1945 and escorting support convoys to that island, then escorted resupply convoys from Morotai to Polloc Harbor and Davao Gulf until 1 July. She participated in the Balikpapan operation, covering the landings, and escorting ships from Morotai, until 20 July, when she arrived at Manila. After brief overhaul, she sailed 31 August for escort duty to Okinawa, then arrived at Sasebo 16 September for occupation duty. Her officers served on teams inspecting Japanese naval and merchant shipping at Sasebo until 29 October, when the destroyer departed for San Diego, arriving 19 November. Fate During the summer of 1946, Flusser took part in Operation Crossroads, the atomic weapons tests in the Marshalls. She returned to Pearl Harbor from this duty 14 September, and on 12 November arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, where she was decommissioned 16 December 1946 and sold 6 January 1948. Flusser received eight battle stars for World War II service.

Born in Malvern, South Australia, Egar umpired 29 Test matches between 1960 and 1969.  First-class debut  Egar started his career as an umpire of Australian rules football and he quickly gained a reputation for being a forthright arbiter. He became an umpire in district cricket, and gained a reputation for his willingness to no-ball suspicious bowlers for throwing. In his district career, he called bowlers on eight occasions, not counting multiple no-ball calls against a bowler in the same match.Whimpress, p. 135. Egar made his first-class umpiring debut during the 1956‚Äì57 season when he stood in South Australia's home Sheffield Shield match against Queensland at the Adelaide Oval. This was Egar's only appointment for the season. At the time, there were no neutral umpires, and the host association provided the officials, so Egar's Sheffield fixtures all took place at the Adelaide Oval. During that era, the Shield program consisted of eight matches for each state, with four home games.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/AUS/1957-58_AUS_Sheffield_Shield_1957-58.html The following season, Egar became more of a regular, standing in three of the four matches at Adelaide Oval. In 1958‚Äì59, Egar stood in all but one of South Australia's three home Shield matches, and officiated a game involving an international team for the first time. He oversaw two matches between South Australia and the touring England cricket team of Peter May, but he was not appointed in any of the five Tests. At the end of this season, the veteran Australian Test umpire Mel McInnes retired after a controversial season and a series of questionable decisions that prompted May and English manager Freddie Brown to call for his standing down.Haigh, p. 123. This left a vacancy for an Australian Test umpire. During the 1959‚Äì60 Australian summer, there were no home Tests as the national team was in the Indian subcontinent. In the meantime, Egar stood in all four Shield matches at the Adelaide Oval. The 1960‚Äì61 season saw the first Tests on Australian soil since McInnes's retirement. Egar stood in South Australia's matches against Victoria, the West Indies and Tasmania, before being selected to make his Test debut. In the match against Victoria, he made his first throwing call against a bowler at first-class level. During the match, Egar no-balled South Australian fast bowler Brian Quigley twice on the first day as Victoria batted first. He did so from the bowler's end as Quigley was trying to extract extra pace from the slow pitch. As the calls were made from the bowler's end, almost all of the spectators thought it was for Quigley overstepping the bowling mark, the most common mode of infringement;Whimpress, p. 73. the fact that Egar made called the bowler for throwing only became apparent to most in the newspapers the next day. Quigley changed his action, but his results thereafter were not enough to gain selection.  Test debut in the Tied Test  His first match was between Australia and the West Indies at Brisbane on 9‚Äì14 December 1960. The game resulted in the first tie in Test match history when Egar's partner Col Hoy adjudged Ian Meckiff run out during the final over of the match. Hoy and Egar stood in every match of that most dramatic of all Test series, and the West Indies captain Frank Worrell was full of praise for the umpiring in that tension-filled series. Hoy wrote in the newspapers about his experiences at the end of the season; at the time, the practice of player and officials concurrently doing media work was heavily frowned upon and he never umpired a Test again.Haigh and Frith, p. 175. Due to his Test commitments, Egar stood in only two Shield matches for the season. In the following summer, 1961‚Äì62, Egar stood in all four Adelaide Oval Shield matches as well as a match against a touring New Zealand team. There were no Tests during the season. In the match against New Zealand, he no-balled South Australian paceman Gordon Brooks for throwing in the sixth ball of his first over. It was Brooks' tenth first-class match, having made his debut in the same season. Egar had ruled Brooks legitimate in four previous matches at first-class level, but had no-balled him in a district match in Adelaide.Whimpress, p. 79. However, Brooks played in a further 16 matches for South Australia over the following three years without incident. During the 1962‚Äì63 season, Egar officiated in Ashes Tests against England for the first time, standing in four of the five Tests, missing the Third Test at Sydney. He stood in four of South Australia's home matches, two in the Shield, and the others against England.  Ian Meckiff  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was increasing concern in the cricket community about illegal bowling actions, especially as during that period there were only home umpires, rather than officials from third nations. Several conferences were held to discuss issues of enforcement and modifications to the laws of cricket. One of the main points of controversy was the Australian fast bowler Ian Meckiff, whose action had particularly angered the English press and parts of the cricket community.Whimpress, pp. 72‚Äì80. During the Tests in 1960‚Äì61, as well as in other first-class matches, Egar officiated over Meckiff's bowling, and deemed his bowling legitimate. The bowler noted that the umpire had told him that there was little point in changing his action.Whimpress, p. 74. Meckiff was not selected in Tests after some poor performances in 1960‚Äì61. In 1962‚Äì63, Meckiff was again under the spotlight. He topped the bowling averages for the Australian first-class season with 58 wickets at 19.86 from ten matches,Whimpress, p. 80. as Victoria won the Sheffield Shield.Coleman, p. 591. Meckiff was hoping to regain his Test place, but was not selected despite his success. Problems arose when he was no-balled in separate matches, by Jack Kierse in a match hosted by South Australia,Whimpress, p. 81. and another hosted by Queensland. In both matches he continued bowling without further incident.Whimpress, p. 82. Meckiff's performances as the leading wicket-taker during the 1962‚Äì63 season meant that he could not be justifiably denied national selection on grounds of productivity, so the matter of his legitimacy had to be resolved. Meanwhile, the retirement of pace spearhead Alan Davidson left a vacancy in the Australian team ahead of the 1963‚Äì64 home Test series against South Africa. In the first two matches of the season in Melbourne, Meckiff took 11 wickets and was recalled to the team for the First Test in Brisbane.Whimpress, p. 83. At the start of the season, the Australian Board of Control had issued a directive calling on the umpires to \\"get tough\\" in enforcing the laws of cricket, and asked the state associations to \\"back the umpires to the fullest extent\\".Pollard, p. 182. In the lead-up to the Test, Meckiff was the centre of media attention, and one report described him as cricket's \\"bogey man\\". The South Africans were reportedly stunned by Meckiff's selection, giving the impression that they considered him an illegitimate bowler.Gibbs, p. 20. Reaction in England was also hostile, ahead of Australia's forthcoming tour in the English summer of 1964. They unequivocally called Meckiff a thrower.Haigh, p. 183. The Brisbane Test was dubbed \\"Meckiff's Test\\" by the Australian media; speculation abounded that the bowler was being chosen so that he could be no- balled as a public relations effort to promote Australia's anti-throwing credentials. Keith Miller predicted that the umpires Egar and Lou Rowan would be having sleepless nights and claimed that the selectors would be biting their fingernails, and that he Meckiff might be a scapegoat for the anti- throwing movement. Many were taken aback by the circumstances of the selection. As a close friend of the fast bowler, umpire Egar was in a difficult situation; the duo had won a pairs lawn bowling competition just a few months earlier. Nevertheless, the paceman and umpire socialised freely at the pre-match function. = Incident = In the match, Australia batted first. On the second day, South Africa began to bat just after the luncheon interval. Graham McKenzie conceded 13 runs from the first over. Meckiff then took the ball for the second over, bowling from the Vulture Street End to South African captain Trevor Goddard.Haigh and Frith, p. 133. At the same time, the South African manager Ken Viljoen set up a camera and began filming the left-armer's bowling action. Meckiff was no-balled four times by Egar‚Äîwho was standing at square leg‚Äîin what would be his only over of the match. After the Victorian bowled a gentle \\"loosener\\" as his first ball, the drama began.Haigh, p. 184. Egar ruled the second, third, fifth and ninth balls to be throws, and therefore illegitimate. After the third and fifth balls‚Äîthe latter a full toss that Goddard hit for four‚ÄîBenaud came over to consult his fast bowler. After the ninth ball, Meckiff and Benaud had another meeting, and the remaining three balls were deemed to be fair. In the meantime, the crowd roared loudly, heckling Egar and supporting the beleaguered bowler.Haigh, p. 185. Meckiff had previously been passed in five countries, having played Tests in four of these nations. Egar had cleared his bowling on five previous occasions, in three Shield matches and two Tests; the Victorian had bowled 119.1 overs in these games without incident. Egar later said \\"My only judgement was what I saw at the time\\".Whimpress, p. 84. Benaud removed his paceman from the attack and Meckiff did not bowl again in the match. He retired from all forms of cricket at the end of the game, but continued to proclaim that his bowling action was fair.Haigh and Frith, p. 113. Barry Gibbs, the secretary of the Queensland Cricket Association and the manager of the Australian team, said that the \\"humiliation\\" of Meckiff was \\"without a doubt the most dramatic and emotion- charged\\" sporting moment he had witnessed.Gibbs, p. 19. Egar's actions also ignited \\"one of the most emotional crowd displays in Test history\\", as the public backed the paceman. During Meckiff's over, the crowd expressed strong disapproval of the umpire's calls.Gibbs, p. 21. Half an hour before the close of the day's play, proceedings were suspended for two minutes as the crowd repeatedly chanted \\"We want Meckiff\\". When play ended, spectators stormed the field and carried the fast bowler off the arena on their shoulders, hailing him as a hero. They then returned to the field and formed two lanes, booing Egar from the ground.Whimpress, p. 87. After this incident, the Queensland Police escorted the umpire to and from the match venue. The police presence at the ground was increased because of fears that the crowd might attack Egar or Benaud. During the Second Test, which was held in Meckiff's home town of Melbourne, Egar was given a police escort throughout the match after receiving death threats.Piesse, p. 204. = Reaction = During a rest day after the second day's play the media dissected the events of the previous afternoon. The majority of reporters believed that all of Meckiff's deliveries had been bowled with an identical action. Louis Duffus wrote that he felt \\"sympathy for Meckiff as well as admiration for Egar.\\"Whimpress, p. 85. The South African Charles Fortune wrote that Meckiff's action was \\"not according to the laws of cricket\\" although he would not call the Australian bowler a \\"chucker\\". England captain Ted Dexter implied that Meckiff was throwing, saying that \\"one courageous Australian umpire has brought it to a timely end\\". Team manager Gibbs reported that at the end of the first day's play the Australian dressing room was stunned into silence. Egar asked Benaud for permission to enter, and after the Australian captain allowed him in, the umpire sat quietly for a period before speaking to some other players and then to Meckiff. The pair were close friends, and shook hands before putting their arms around one another's shoulders. The condemned bowler did not take Egar's judgment personally and did not have hard feelings about the incident.Haigh, p. 186.Gibbs, pp. 20‚Äì21. Egar said that he was \\"the second most upset person in the world\\", and later added that he thought Meckiff's first ball was suspect. He said that he could have called more deliveries, but was worried that the over would never end. Benaud received criticism for not bowling Meckiff again at the other end,Whimpress, p. 88. but Rowan later indicated that he would have agreed with Egar, writing in his book that the action was illegitimate.Gibbs, p. 23. Retired Test umpires Hoy and Les Townsend were watching at the ground when Meckiff was called. The day after the incident, both asserted that they would not have no-balled the paceman, claiming that Meckiff's action, though unusual, was legitimate.Whimpress, p. 89. Meckiff later agreed to a series of ghost-written articles about the no-ball incident.Haigh, p. 187. He said that Egar's calls \\"hit him like a dagger in the back\\", but described the umpire as \\"a fair and just man who acted according to his convictions\\". = Allegations of a conspiracy = Sections of the cricket community believed that Meckiff was no-balled to prove that Australia was serious about dealing with the wave of complaints regarding suspected throwing in the 1950s and 1960s.Cashman, p. 231. A dinner hosted by board member Don Bradman in January 1963 for visiting state captains was later cited to suggest that Meckiff may have been a sacrificial offering. At the dinner,Whimpress, p. 90.Haigh, p. 182. Bradman had showed film of Meckiff among others, which purportedly depicted incriminating actions. This indicated Bradman's doubts over Meckiff's legitimacy, yet Bradman was one of the selectors who oversaw Meckiff's inclusion.Whimpress, p. 91. Many members of the Australian media alleged a conspiracy against Meckiff, using words such as \\"the whole affair smacks of a set-up\\", \\"obvious fall-guy\\", and \\"sacrificial goat\\".Whimpress, p. 86. Several called for Bradman and his colleagues to resign. Cricketer-turned-journalist Dick Whitington cited the fact that Egar and Bradman had travelled from Adelaide to the Brisbane Test together as evidence of a plot.Haigh and Frith, p. 124. Gibbs later claimed that the selection of an extra bowler for the match hinted at fears that Meckiff would not be able to bowl.Gibbs, pp. 22‚Äì24. Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy, saying \\"I wasn't amazed [by Egar's call]...There was a good reason for that which I can't disclose and won't disclose.\\"Piesse, p. 190. Tom Veivers, who made his Test debut for Australia in Meckiff‚Äôs last match, hinted at the same. He recalled that Rowan had said \\"It's going to be a very interesting game\\" at the pre- match function. For his part, Egar always denied any conspiracy had occurred or that he agreed to a premeditated course of events against Meckiff. Egar stood in all five Tests as well as four of South Australia's home matches during 1963‚Äì64. The following season, he stood in Australia's only Test against Pakistan and four matches at Adelaide Oval.  Eddie Illingworth  During the same season, 1964‚Äì65, Egar no-balled a fourth and final bowler during his career, Victoria's Eddie Illingworth. The bowler had made his first-class debut two and a half years. This had been controversial as he had twice been no-balled for throwing by two different umpires in Victorian Premier Cricket prior to his selection.Whimpress, p. 84. Despite taking a total of 7/71 on debut, Illingworth was overlooked for further state selection for over two years. Illingworth's best performance in a Sheffield Shield match was against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval in November 1964, the same match in which he was called. Illingworth took 4/92 in South Australia's first innings but was no-balled a total of three times by Egar and his partner Jack Ryan, both standing at square leg. He was called twice by Egar on the second and fourth deliveries of his eleventh over, and once by Ryan on the sixth ball of his fourteenth over. In the same fourteenth over, Illingworth had dismissed former Pakistani Test batsman Duncan Sharpe and Australian Test wicket-keeper Barry Jarman from the first and fourth deliveries respectively. Victorian captain Bill Lawry chose not to remove Illingworth and continued to bowl him. The state selectors were reluctant to pick Illingworth for Victoria because of the throwing allegations that surrounded him and he played in only two more matches. In 1965‚Äì66, Egar had the busiest season of his career. He stood in all five Anglo-Australian Tests, two matches between South Australia and England, and three of his state's home Shield matches. The following summer, Egar stood in all four Shield matches at Adelaide Oval while the Test team were away in South Africa. In 1967‚Äì68, Egar stood in all four Tests against India in addition to three Shield matches and two fixtures between South Australia and India and New Zealand respectively. Egar stood in all five Tests of the West Indian tour of Australia in 1968‚Äì69. He also officiated in two Shield matches and two games between South Australia and the West Indies at Adelaide Oval. Egar's last match, also against the West Indies, was at Sydney from 14‚Äì20 February 1969. The match was won by Australia by 382 runs after Bill Lawry, the Australian captain, delayed his second-innings declaration until Australia led by 734 runs. In this match Doug Walters became the first batsman to score a double century and a century in the same match, with scores of 242 and 103. Egar's colleague was Lou Rowan. The following season, the Test team were in India and South Africa, and Egar stood in all four of South Australia's home Shield fixtures. In 1970‚Äì71, Egar stood in one Shield match and then the tour game between South Australia and Ray Illingworth's touring Englishmen in October, and retired after the match, not standing in the Tests. During the 1960s he umpired 29 out of 30 Test matches played in Australia.  Administration  Following his umpiring career, Egar turned to cricket administration, managing a number of Australian Test teams, and was the Australian Cricket Board's chairman from 1989-92. Ironically, in the Australian tour of Pakistan in 1988, Egar protested to the Pakistan Board of Control over the umpiring of Mahboob Shah, following an innings loss on a grassless pitch which captain Allan Border described as a conspiracy from the word go. Steve Waugh, a member of the team, quoted Egar as claiming the umpiring is totally unacceptable. The tour was in danger of being abandoned, but Egar insisted it progress as scheduled.Haigh and Frith, pp. 274‚Äì276.  Criticism of throwing  Egar remained outspoken about bowling actions that he considered to be dubious in his later life. He was strongly critical of the action of the Sri Lankan world record-breaking spinner Muttiah Muralitharan.http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/368405.html In 2002, he criticised Wisden for ranking Muralitharan the best bowler in Test history, citing his bowling action. After Muralitharan broke the world record for career Test dismissals, Egar said \\"As far as I am concerned they should have a separate record for bowlers with illegal actions...I've got a photo at home of Murali's arm bending at 48 degrees.\\" Egar criticised laboratory tests on Muralitharan at the University of Western Australia as \\"rubbish...The only tests that matter are those conducted under match conditions...The administrators of the game have got to take the blame for letting his action go.\\" A public bar at the Adelaide Oval is named the \\"Col Egar Bar\\" as a tribute to him. Egar died in September 2008 following a long illness.Cricinfo Profile, Cricinfo. Retrieved on 5 September 2008.

Known as K, he was described in Who's Who as \\"Commandant, War Department Constabulary\\".H. Montgomery Hyde, \\"A matter of official secrets\\", The Times, 4 December 1976 Early life Born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in 1873, Kell was the son of Major Waldegrave Kell of the 38th Foot and his wife, Georgiana Augusta Konarska. She was a daughter of a Polish √©migr√©, Alexander Konarski, a surgeon with the 1st Podhalian Rifle Regiment who had fought in the November Uprising and had been awarded the Virtuti Militari Gold Cross, by his marriage to an English wife. Military service After graduating from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Kell was commissioned into the South Staffordshire Regiment on 10 October 1894. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 December 1896, was seconded in January 1900, and fought in the Boxer Rebellion later that year. He could speak German, Italian, French and Polish with equal facility, and after serving and studying in China and Russia, he learned their respective languages too. While he was on the intelligence staff in Tientsin he was also the foreign correspondent of The Daily Telegraph. He was promoted to the supernumerary (temporary) rank of captain in his regiment on 24 September 1901. After his return to London from China in 1902 Kell was employed to analyse German intelligence at the War Office until 1906. He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 1 October 1903, and was appointed a staff captain on 9 February 1904. Rising public fears in Great Britain of German espionage precipitated the creation of a new government intelligence agency. In 1909 Kell was selected by the War Office and the Admiralty as one of two officers, alongside Mansfield Smith- Cumming, to head the newly formed Secret Service Bureau.Christopher Andrew, The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of Mi5 (London, 2009), p.21. He retired from active duty on 16 October 1909, but remained in the reserves. Intelligence service Kell and Cumming decided to divide the intelligence work, Kell taking responsibility for domestic concerns, while Cumming was to oversee foreign matters. However, their working relationship was fraught, as Cumming advocated the separation of the Bureau's work into two distinct departments. The separation took place in 1910.Christopher Andrew, The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of Mi5 (London, 2009), pp.25‚Äì27. These two distinct sections were later retitled as the Security Service and the Secret Intelligence Service (now commonly known as MI5 and MI6 respectively). Kell was promoted to the rank of major in the reserves on 20 August 1913. Following the outbreak of war in 1914, Kell was restored to active duty as a GSO 2, and was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel on 5 September. On 1 March 1915, he was appointed a GSO 1, retaining his temporary rank. For his service, he received a brevet promotion to lieutenant-colonel on 3 June 1916, and received a temporary promotion to colonel on 21 December. First World War During the First World War, Kell headed MI5(g), a section dealing with the Indian seditionist movement in Europe. Among Kell's officers were ex-ICS officers Robert Nathan and H. L. Stephenson. Kell also worked closely with the Special Branch of Scotland Yard, then headed by Basil Thomson, and was successful in tracing the work of Indian revolutionaries collaborating with the Germans during the war. Between the wars Kell was promoted to the rank of colonel in the reserves on 1 April 1924. Upon reaching the age of 60 on 21 November 1933, he was struck from the reserve list. Kell received an honorary promotion to major-general on 27 September 1939. In December 1938, having reached retirement age, Kell asked to remain in post on a year-to-year basis.Christopher Andrew, The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5 (London, 2009) With the onset of war, MI5 finally got the hiring and financial resources of which it had been starved for years. However, MI5 proved unable to deploy them without confusion and Kell and his deputy, both in their mid-60s, got the blame. On 10 June 1940 Kell was dismissed on the instructions of Winston Churchill, after 30 years in post. He was the longest-serving head of any British government department during the 20th century. He was knighted for his services shortly before his death in 1942. Honours Kell was awarded the following orders and decorations: =British= *Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division (KBE; 1919 Birthday Honours) *Companion of the Order of the Bath, Military Division (CB; 1 January 1917) =Other= *Officer of the Order of Leopold (Kingdom of Belgium; 24 September 1917) *Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur (France; 24 September 1917) *Officer of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus (Kingdom of Italy; 1 April 1919) *Campaign medal for ChinaPortrait photograph of Kell at Plate 1 of Christopher Andrew's Authorised History of MI5 (partly obscured) *1914 War Medal Popular culture Kell was the basis for a major character in Bert Coules's radio adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's His Last Bow. He was portrayed as a highly talented officer and a polyglot who had immense respect for Sherlock Holmes, claiming to have read all his publications. Kell convinces Holmes to join the war effort and to seek out the mastermind of a German espionage organisation. Kell is depicted as an ally of a secret society of bodyguards attached to the radical women's suffrage movement in the graphic novel trilogy Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst's Amazons (2015). The depiction is considered rather fantastic. Kell is a major character in the novel called Blackest Of Lies. Written by novelist Bill Aitken, which is set during the First World War and concerns the death of Lord Kitchener. In Dennis Wheatley's 1950 novel \\"The Second Seal\\", Kell investigates the book's hero, the Duke de Richleau. When the Duke meets a highly placed official at a London party in the Spring of 1914, he spins a fantastic yarn to the official about a plot by the Serbian Black Hand to stir up trouble in the Balkans and maybe promote a World War. Kell is given the job of verifying the Duke's background and reliability.

The species occurs in mulga and heath communities on sandhills and rocky ridges in all mainland states of Australia, except Victoria. Description Acacia brachystachya grows as a tall, bushy inland shrub to five metres with twisted, spreading stems, and is branched at the base.Pedley, L. (n.d.) Flora of Australia online. Retrieved from http://www.anbg.gov.au/abrs/online- resources/flora/stddisplay.xsql?pnid=41839 Like most Acacia species, it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. These may be up to 18 centimetres long, are mostly one to three millimetres wide and a grey-green colour.Armitage, A. (1978). Acacias of New South Wales. Sydney: N.S.W. Region of the Society for Growing Australian Plants The flowers are yellow, and held in cylindrical clusters about two centimetres long (up to 25 millimetres). The pods are long and straight, up to 12 centimetres long and 8 millimetres across. It has peduncles up to 10mm with short, stiff hairs. Distribution and Habitat Acacia brachystachya is a shrub or small tree found in inland Australia. It is found in New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. Within NSW it is usually found in the Central Western Slopes, the Western Plains, and North Far Western Plains. Acacia brachystachya is commonly found on sandy loam soils near Acacia aneura, and on sandy soils between dunes. In addition to this, in the eastern section of its range, it occurs on shallow stony soils. Its environmental requirements are much alike to those of Acacia ramulosa, albeit with a narrower geographic range. Although A. brachystachya is both related to and confused with A. aneura and A. ramulosa, it is distinguishable in the difference of the pods. Taxonomy Acacia brachystachya of the families Fabaceae or Mimosaceae has been categorised as being part of the subfamily Mimosoideae. The species name Acacia brachystachya was coined in 1864 by George Bentham, an English man who never travelled to Australia but wrote Flora Australiensis. Bentham has been referred to as one of the greatest systematic botanists, having contributed considerably to Australian botany. The type specimen, K000806612, was collected during the Bourke and Wills expedition in the Mutanie Ranges, and came from Ferdinand von Mueller's herbarium.JSTOR Global Plants: Type of Acacia brachystachya Benth. This species is of the Acacia genus with the specific species name being brachystachya. The plant is called brachystachya due to its short spikes, brachys (short), and stachys (spike). Acacia brachystachya is classed as a group 1 Acacia under the informal groupings outlined by D.A Morrison and S.J Davies.Harden, G.J. (ed.) (1991) Flora of New South Wales, 2 Group 1 plants are identified as having phyllodes, as well as being the only group which features flowers in cylindrical heads. Reproduction Acacia Mill. sect. Juliflorae Benth., commonly referred to as mulga includes A. brachystachya.Randell, B. R. (1992). Mulga. A Revision of the Major Species. Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens, 14(2), 105-132. Most Acacias have been studied comprehensively, however many mulgas have not. It has been concluded that it is likely that mulga plants are insect pollinated as this is often the case with arid zone Acacias. Although it generally flowers in April‚ÄìAugust, A. brachystachya does flower irregularly depending on weather and climatic conditions. These flowers are hermaphroditic and grow after heavy rainfall at any time of year. Despite the potential year round flowering, reproduction does not always follow. Mature pods are usually only developed when summer rain is the cause of flowering followed by rain in the subsequent winter. Because A. brachystachya is most easily distinguished from similar species by assessing the pods, it can be difficult to correctly identify without having experiencing the appropriate climatic conditions.

It was formerly run by Jordanhill College of Education as its demonstration school, and was previously known as Jordanhill College School. Uniquely among Scottish schools, it is funded directly by the Scottish Government (rather than through the local authority, in this case Glasgow City Council). The school consists of a primary department and a secondary department. In the primary, P1 & P2 have three classes of twenty-two pupils each while P3-P7 have two classes of thirty-three. Pupils in upper Primary spend up to 60% of their week working in the Secondary department. The secondary school takes in an additional thirty- three pupils in S1 to bring the number per year up to 99. The school is categorised as non-denominational. The school is state-funded by direct grant from the Scottish Government, and is non fee-paying. The school catchment area encompasses predominantly owner-occupied housing in West Glasgow. The school regularly records among the best exam results in Scotland. History The college was an out-of-town location that sought to merge two teacher training centres that were heavily influenced by education training pioneer David Stow, a Glasgow merchant. These were the Free Church Normal Seminary and the Dundas Vale Normal Seminary, two of the earliest teacher training colleges in Scotland. This merger was a government-sponsored initiative of 1905, when it was decided that teacher training should be taken away from the church and placed under the control of a provincial committee. The site of the college - and now the school - was on the old Jordanhill Estate grounds. The old Jordanhill House was demolished around 1915, with the Glasgow Provincial Committee buying the land to build their new college, though the plot had been for sale since 1911. The school buildings were completed in 1921,Donnelly, Max (1987) \\"Jordanhill - A Historical Sketch\\" (2nd ed) (Glasgow: Self-published (printed at Strathclyde University)) although the school was founded a year earlier, in 1920. Headmasters include Andrew Walker (1891‚Äì1974), who led Jordanhill College School from 1936 to 1956, having earlier served from 1921 to 1932 as a mathematics and science master and - initially - the only teacher in the new secondary department, formed in 1921 with twenty pupils. His successor, William T Branston (1915‚Äì1984), at the time of his 1956 appointment was the youngest headteacher in Scotland and whose tenure - Branston retired in December 1980 - saw successive challenges, from sustained upheaval in Scottish school curricula to a serious bid to shut Jordanhill College School in 1969. (It survived, the controversy concluding in December 1970, with the school adjusting readily to non-selective and non fee-paying status) A former naval officer and veteran of the Second World War, committed to good works from amateur dramatics through the YMCA (he chaired the Glasgow organisation) to the Scottish National Orchestra Chorus and influential lay service in the Church of Scotland, William Branston was to most pupils an 'astonishingly remote, God-like figure'. He enforced regular religious observance - such as morning assembly - and the school was noted through the 1970s for its rigid uniform code and highly conservative, rote-learning traditional teaching methods, notably in arithmetic and English grammar. The school remained under control of the College until 1988, when it switched to its current directly funded status. This move caused controversy at the time, with various other options considered (including becoming a Council-run establishment or, indeed, a fee-paying school). In the end a combination of a spirited \\"Save Our School\\" campaign spearheaded by Branston's successor, Alistair Cram and ingenious political machinations led to the school becoming directly funded by the Scottish Office (and later the Scottish Executive). Cram resigned in 1988, and in 1989 'College' was dropped from the school name, at the insistence of Jordanhill College. In 1993 the college merged with the University of Strathclyde, with the Jordanhill Campus serving as home to the Education Faculty. The campus has now fallen into disrepair, and is now being redelveloped as new housing by CALA Homes Ltd.

In early 2005 the school acquired the former Laurel Park games hall on Anniesland Road, in partnership with the Glasgow Academy. Work on the multi-million modern two-storey \\"South Campus\\" was completed in mid 2009. It accommodates mainly secondary school classes and some upper primary classes. The building covers four departments: art, mathematics, modern languages, and social sciences . It is connected to the original \\"North Campus\\" via a walkway parallel to the sports pitch. The sports pitch was upgraded from blaze to artificial grass and a MUGA pitch (Multi-Use Games Area) around the same time; which has now been converted to artificial grass. Miscellaneous The school's Latin motto, beneath its coat of arms is \\"Ad summa nitor\\", which translates to \\"Strive for the highest\\". The school uniform consists of dark trousers for boys (brown shorts were obligatory in the Primary Department until 1977, when the option of 'longs' was ceded to Primary Seven boys) a brown skirt (or pinafore for primary girls) for girls, a white shirt (the option of cream was permitted into the early 1990s) and a brown blazer. Girls for a long time were not allowed to wear trousers (despite movements and petitions by student bodies to end girls not being allowed to wear trousers, which had all been controversially blocked by the board of managers and the SMT for several years). Female pupils are allowed to choose to wear trousers or skirts as of 2018. Blazers are compulsory for all pupils, regardless of weather, making them unusual for a Scottish state school. The tie is yellow, brown and green for everyone except the seniors (S5-S6), who wear a brown tie with the school crest. S4-S6 pupils achieving excellence in extra-curricular activities (for example representing their country at their chosen sport) are awarded a green Honours tie. Similarly, pupils in S5 and S6 may be awarded Colours and/or dates on their blazer. Half-Colours is a gold trim that extends around the cuff and bottom of the blazer, compared to full- Colours which also lines the collar. Colours and dates are awarded for excellence and/or achievement in music or sport. In academia, pupils who receive 5 As at Higher in S5 are awarded full Colours in S6. The school is categorised as non-denominational, however students are required to attend 3 Christian Church services at the end of each term at Jordanhill Parish Church. In 2015, the school controversially denied a place to a child with complex additional support needs. The school claimed, due to its unique method of funding, it did not have suitable equipment for the child. Jordanhill's Senior Management Team (SMT) consists of: * Rector Paul Thomson; * Depute Rector Christine Robertson; * Depute Head Teacher (responsible for Junior (S1-S3) Secondary) TBA; * Depute Head Teacher (responsible for Senior (S4-S6) Secondary) Susan McDade; * Head of Primary Richard Buchan; * Depute Head of Primary Robin G. Paton. The railway station closest to the school is Jordanhill railway station. The school was used as a filming location for Trainspotting, the film of the 1993 Irvine Welsh novel. The school has also been used for the filming of BBC dramas; Shetland in 2012 & 2016 and Single Father in summer 2010.

Romanianization in Transylvania  = In the period between the two World Wars = After the end of World War I, in 1 December 1918, the Romanian National Council (elected representatives of the Romanian population) and ‚Äì soon afterwards ‚Äì the representatives of the German population had taken the decision of the unification with Romania. The decision was contested by the Hungarian minority. In 1920, the Treaty of Trianon established the Romanian border with the new Hungarian state. However, Transylvania had a large Hungarian minority, of 25.5% according to the 1920 census. A portion of them fled to Hungary after the union;Raffay Ern≈ë: A vajdas√°gokt√≥l a birodalomig-Az √∫jkori Rom√°nia t√∂rt√©nete = From voivodates to the empire- History of modern Romania, JATE Kiad√≥, Szeged, 1989, pages 155‚Äì156); Kovrig, Bennett (2000) ‚ÄòPartitioned nation: Hungarian minorities in Central Europe‚Äô, in: Michael Mandelbaum (ed.), The new European diasporas: national minorities and conflict in Eastern Europe, New York: Council on Foreign Relations Press, pp. 19‚Äì80. Ern≈ë indicates an exodus of about 197,000 Transylvanian Hungarians fled to Hungary in 1918‚Äì1922, Kovrig estimates a further 169,000 over the remainder of the interwar period. however, most of them remained in Romania and in the 1930s their number increased to 26.7% of the whole Transylvanian population. The increase in the proportion of the Hungarian minority in Transylvania was induced by the immigration of the Hungarians from Hungary and by the significant improvement of living standards of the Hungarian minority in Romania comparative with the living standards of the interwar Hungary's population. While Romania included large national minorities, the 1923 Constitution declared the country to be a nation-state, following the French model which was popular in many European nations at that time. After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the post-war mass actions of the Romanians directed against primarily the Hungarian aristocracy and at times Jews.Eugenia Barlea: Perspectiva lumii rurale asupra primului razboi mondial. Editura Argonaut, Cluj-Napoca, 2005. The takeover did not happen without the reduction of the cultural and economic life of the Hungarians. While in accordance with the Agricultural Act of 1921 a number of Hungarian estates and lands were confiscated, the land reform openly favored the Romanians, the national group which used to be the victim of the unjust land allocation systems practiced under the Hungarian Kingdom's administrations. Although Romania won the war, the Anti-Hungarian sentiments were not remitted. During the 1930s (in response to the Hungarian Revisionism) Anti-Revisionist demonstrations began in Romania,A Romanian point of view: Mikl√≥s Zeidler: Ideas on territorial revision in Hungary, 1920‚Äì1945.

However, on 12 November 1944 the Soviet Red Army expulsed the returning Romanian authorities from Northern Transylvania with reference to the massacres committed by members of Iuliu Maniu's so-called Maniu Guard, and the Romanian authorities were not allowed to return until the government of Petru Groza was formed on 6 March 1945.Vincze G√°bor: A kisebbs√©gpolitikus M√°rton √Åron. Magyar Kisebbs√©g. Retrieved 25 September 2012.(The Hungarian-Romanian conflicts in 1940 and 1944 are still controversial.) = After the second World War = Since 1947 the Romanian authorities gradually eliminated the old Hungarian institutions, after the Treaty of Trianon borders had been restored. However Hungary was a Socialist country as well, after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 Hungarians in Transylvania many times were accused of separatism and revisionism,Stefano Bottini ‚Äì Zolt√°n Csaba Nov√°k: Az 1956. √©vi forradalom saj√°tos rom√°niai k√∂vetkezm√©nyei (forr√°sk√∂zl√©s).

Volume 54. p. 61-73. the major part of Hungarian intellectual and spiritual leaders (among others Catholic Bishop √Åron M√°rton) were arrested and convicted for years. On the other hand, during the Communist era the former civil organization possibilities of the interwar period were eliminated. After 1948, the industrialization of towns made the number of inhabitants in some urban areas to double or even triple, most of the newcomers being ethnic Romanians from the rural areas. The urbanization policy, natural phenomenon as the urbanization being required by the economic development and by the intention of transforming the predominantly agrarian country into an industrialized one, was followed throughout Romania, including in areas inhabited by minorities although much less significant. By the late 1950s the regime of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej increasingly manipulated Romanian nationalism as a popular legitimizing device applying more repressive policies toward the Hungarian minority.Bugajski, p. 200 After the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 the Magyar Autonomous Region was dissolved and most key posts were filled by loyal Romanians. In 1959, the Hungarian university in Cluj was merged with the Romanian one to become an almost exclusively Romanian-language institution. The event was marked by the suicide of several Hungarian professors. The Romanianization of education had begun earlier, in 1958 through the forced merger of Magyar primary schools with Romanian ones. The Cs√°ng√≥s for their part lost their last Hungarian school in 1958. After Nicolae Ceau»ôescu came to power in the 1960s, the assimilationist drive was pursued with new vigor. The remaining minority \\"privileges\\" were lost, Hungarian representation in the local bureaucracies was limited to the proportion of Hungarians in the total population. Mass resettlement of Romanians into Transylvania took place. Hungarian intellectuals were coerced into leaving Transylvania and were compelled to take jobs in non-Hungarian areas which also contributed to Romanianization. = Results = According to census data, the Hungarian population of Transylvania decreased from 25.5% in 1920 to 19.6% in 2002. Changes were more significant in cities/larger settlements, where Hungarians used to be majoritarian, especially in Northern Transylvanian cities such as Oradea and Cluj-Napoca. It is possible that the population of Hungarians in these cities dropped since many Romanians declared themselves to be Hungarians when Transylvania was under the control of Austria-Hungary. Many Romanians would magyarize their last names since Romanians were considered second-class citizens in Austria-Hungary. Romanianization of the Transylvanian population was also affected by the fact that 300,000 Germans emigrated into West Germany. The West German state paid to Romania the equivalent of $2,632 per ethnic German emigrant, as of 1983.\\"Relations with Noncommunist States\\" in Library of Congress Country Study: Romania, based on data as of July 1989. \\"In 1979 West Germany's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt visited Bucharest and extended credit guarantees of approximately US$368 million in return for Romanian pledges to facilitate the reunification of ethnic German families. The issue resurfaced in 1983 when the so called education tax would have increased West Germany's payment of the equivalent of US$2,632 per ethnic German emigrant to US$42,105. After visits by Bavarian premier Franz Josef Strauss and West German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, an agreement was reached whereby the West German government increased its payment per emigrant to approximately US$5,263.\\" Accessed online 12 November 2006. Also, about 50,000 Jews who survived the Holocaust emigrated to Israel on similar terms. These mass emigrations were, however, an example of positive discrimination towards the German and Jewish populations, as the rest of the Transylvanian population (Romanians, Hungarians, Romas) had no opportunity to take part in this economical emigration. Romanianization was less sustained in the compact Sz√©kely areas of south-eastern Transylvania (the Sz√©kely Land), where in 2002 Hungarians made around 61% of the population. The capital city of the former Hungarian Autonomous Province (covering mostly the Sz√©kely areas) is an exception: the percentage of Hungarians in T√¢rgu Mure≈ü decreased to 46%, as the industrialization of the city led many people from the surrounding rural areas (largely Romanian) to move into the city.A secret document from the Romanian Communist Party archives that requires the city of Tirgu Mures to change its ethnic composition through settlements = Recent events = Ethnic map of Harghita, Covasna, and Mure»ô Counties based on the 2011 data, showing localities with Hungarian majority or plurality. In the aftermath of the Romanian Revolution of 1989, ethnic-based political parties were constituted by both the Hungarians, who founded the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, and by the Romanian Transylvanians, who founded the Romanian National Unity Party. Ethnic conflicts, however, never occurred on a significant scale, even though some violent clashes, such as the T√¢rgu Mure»ô events of March 1990, did take place shortly after the fall of the Ceau»ôescu regime. In 1995, a basic treaty on the relations between Hungary and Romania was signed. In the treaty, Hungary renounced all territorial claims to Transylvania, and Romania reiterated its respect for the rights of its minorities. Relations between the two countries improved as Romania and Hungary became EU members in the 2000s. The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) is the major representative of Hungarians in Romania, and is a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization. The aim of the UDMR is to achieve local government, cultural and territorial autonomy and the right to self- determination for Hungarians. UDMR is a member of the European Democrat Union (EDU) and the European People's Party (EPP). Since 1996, the UDMR has been a member or supporter of every governmental coalition. Political agreements have brought the gradual implementation of Hungarian language in everyday life: Public administration Law 215/2002 stipulates \\"the use of national minority languages in public administration in settlements where minorities exceed 20% of the population\\"; minority ethnics will receive a copy of the documents in Romanian language and a translation in their language; however, official documents are preserved by the local administration in Romanian only; local administration will provide inscriptions for the names of localities and public institutions under their authority, and display public interest announcements in the native language of the citizens of the respective ethnic minority under the same 20% rule. Even though Romania co-signed the European laws for protecting minorities' rights, the implementation has not proved satisfactory to all members of Hungarian community. There is a movement by Hungarians both for an increase in autonomy and distinct cultural development. Initiatives proposed by various Hungarian political organizations include the creation of an \\"autonomous region\\" in the counties that form the Sz√©kely region (Sz√©kelyf√∂ld), roughly corresponding to the territory of the former Hungarian Autonomous Province as well as the historical Sz√©kely Land that had been abolished by the Hungarian government in the second half of the 19th century, and the re-establishment of an independent state-funded Hungarian- language university. However, the situation of the Hungarian minority in Romania has been seen as a model of cultural and ethnic diversity in the Balkan area: In an address to the American people, President Clinton asked in the midst of the air war in Kosovo: Who is going to define the future of this part the world... Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, with his propaganda machine and paramilitary forces which compel people to give up their country, identity, and property, or a state like Romania which has built a democracy respecting the rights of ethnic minorities?Tom Gallagher, \\"Modern Romania: the end of communism, the failure of democratic reform, and the theft of a nation\\", p. 216, NYU Press, 2005 The process is, with a lower intensity, active even in our days, irrespective of the political affiliation of the current government, partly because each party uses the ethnic minorities as scapegoats for their own electoral benefit. The measures include: * the appointment of openly nationalist politicians or former military officials in leading public functions in Hungarian-majority areas, * punishment of public use of the Hungarian national symbols of the Hungarian minority, * stigmatization of minority organisations by the press and government officials as enemies of the state, * withdrawal of state decorations from people publicly talking about minority rights abuses of the Romanian state. In June 2019 Romanian crowd broke into the former Austro-Hungarian military cemetery in √öz Valley despite heavy police presence and a human chain of ethnic Hungarians protesting peacefully. The cemetery was established in 1917 by Austrians and Hungarians as the burial place for the fallen heroes of WWI battles - and since has been also used during WWII for the same purpose. The local council in DormƒÉne»ôti, a town of 8,600 inhabitants located some distance away in BacƒÉu county and which does not have jurisdiction over the cemetery ‚Äì began a so-called ‚Äúrenovation‚Äù on the cemetery grounds, erecting concrete crosses and a memorial to Romanian war heroes that are in fact buried in the former village of Poiana Uzulu nearby. The council of DormƒÉne»ôti, however, scheduled the inauguration of the newly and illegally erected Romanian war memorial. Eager to protect the burial site of their fallen heroes, some 1,000 ethnic Hungarians formed a human chain in silent prayer around the graveyard. Despite police presence, several from the Romanian crowd eventually broke through the police cordon and the fence and tore open the cemetery gate. Some members of the Hungarian group were physically attacked and injured. The Romanian Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Defense have said that the new crosses and memorial violate the law. Policies toward the Ukrainian minority in Romania The territories of Bukovina (today split between Romania and Ukraine) and Bessarabia (today by 2/3 in the republic of Moldova and 1/3 in Ukraine), historically populated by the Romanians and Ukrainians for hundreds of years. In 1775, Bukovina was annexed by the Habsburg Monarchy, which offered certain currency in the public life for the two nations,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Ukraine, Section:: History:: Western Ukraine under the Habsburg monarchy:: Bukovina however the general policy on churches and education disfavored the Christian Orthodox population.Keith Hitchins, The Romanians 1774‚Äì1866, Oxford University Press, 1996, , p. 227-229 Austrian control favored immigration to develop the economy of the region.Keith Hitchins, The Romanians 1774‚Äì1866, Oxford University Press, 1996, , p. 226Raimund Friedrich Kaindl, Das Ansiedlungswesen in der Bukowina seit der Besitzergreifung durch √ñsterreich, Innsbruck, 1902, pp. 1‚Äì71 Due to Bukovina being administratively linked to the province of Galicia, the ethnic composition of the province was altered by waves of Ruthenian (Ukrainian), German and Jewish immigrants. According to Keith Hitchins, \\"In 1774 the estimated population was 75000; in 1810 it was 198,000, and in 1848 378,000. The changes in the province's ethnic composition were dramatic. In 1774 the Romanians constituted an overwhelming majority, roughly 64,000 to 8,000 Ruthenians (Ukrainians) and 3,000 others. By 1810 the Romanian share had fallen from 85 per cent to 75 per cent (150,000 to 48,000 non-Romanians), and in 1848 there were 209,000 Romanians (55 per cent), 109,000 Ukrainians (29 per cent) and 60,000 others (16 per cent). The Jewish population rose from 526 in 1774 to 11,600 in 1848.\\" In 1918, following the collapse of Austria-Hungary, control over the whole of Bukovina fell under the Kingdom of Romania; same situation happens in Bessarabia after the relinquishment of Russian Empire. The takeover was followed by the policy of Romanianization of ethnic minorities, mostly Ukrainians, pursued by the Romanian authorities. The policies were built on an increasing sentiment spread in Romanian media and historic works that all of Bukovina was inherently a Romanian ethnic territory. Ion Nistor, a prominent Romanian historian and one of the most vocal proponents of Greater Romanian nationalism,Oleksandr Derhachov (editor), \\"Ukrainian Statehood in the Twentieth Century: Historical and Political Analysis\\", Chapter: \\"Ukraine in Romanian concepts of the foreign policy\\", 1996, Kiev Mariana Hausleitner, \\"Cernauti University, 1919‚Äì1940: Concepts and Consequences of Romanization\\".

Enrollment of Ukrainians in the university fell from 239 out of 1671 in 1914 to 155 out of 3,247 in 1933, while Romanian enrollment in the same period increased to 2,117 out of 3,247.A. Zhukovsky, Chernivtsi University, Encyclopedia of Ukraine, 2001, Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies. Accessed 11 Feb 2006. The Romanianization policies brought the closure of the Ukrainian public schools (all such schools were closed until 1928) and the suppression of most of the Ukrainian (Ruthenian) cultural institutions. The very term \\"Ukrainians\\" was prohibited from the official usage and some populations of disputable Ukrainian ethnicity were rather called the \\"citizens of Romania who forgot their native language\\" and were forced to change their last names to Romanian-sounding ones. Among those who were Romanianized were descendants of Romanians who were assimilated to Ukrainian society in the past. As such, according to the Romanian census, of the total population of 805,000, 74% were called Romanians; the number included the Ukrainians and other possibly related Ukrainian ethnic groups Hutsuls referred to as \\"Romanians who forgot their native language\\"Harvard Ukrainian Studies, Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, 1988, p.191 According to the 1930 census, Ukrainians made up 3.2% of the population of Romania. The declines in Ukrainian population between the censuses of 1919 and 1930 is illustrated as follows: the first census indicates a population of 16,250,000, of which 763,750 (4.7%) were Ukrainians; in 1930, as the total population had increased by 11% (to 18,025,896), the Ukrainian community had dropped to 576,828 members (75.5% of the previous total). Other ethnic minorities Other ethnic minorities who were Romanianized are Bulgarians who first arrived during the First and Second Bulgarian Empires in the 7th and 11th centuries respectively, Turks who arrived during Ottoman Empire, and Russians who arrived in Wallachia and Bessarabia. These ethnic minorities were not forcibly Romanianized, but voluntarily as many of them speak their own languages.

Early life  At the age of one, his family moved from Reykjavik to √çsafj√∂r√∞ur. When he was six his family then moved to a series of islands on the West African Coast by the name of Cape Verde. His father was there as part of a volunteer program teaching locals how to fish. Mugison spent an idyllic childhood in Cabo Verde owning various pet monkeys and spending vast amounts of time swimming. He did not start school until the age of nine. From the age of 10 to 14, he lived in and around many parts of Reykjav√≠k . At 14 he moved to a small island in the North of Iceland called Hr√≠sey . During the winter, he was sent to a boarding/dorm school from 14-17. This is where Mugison began to explore and discover music. Prior to moving to Hr√≠sey he had been a keen swimmer and football player, not overly interested in the arts.  Career  = Early career = During the summer of 1990, whilst working on Hr√≠sey, he saw a poet/musician play a gig which was a major turning point in his life. The artist in question was Kjartan H Gr√©tarsson. Mugison was so fascinated by Kjartan's mysterious presence, most notably his hair, that he sought him out and requested the musician teach Mugison how to become an artist. Kjartan agreed and they met every Wednesday in order for him to impart his widom and expose Mugison to all kinds of weird and wonderful music and literature including Frank Zappa, The Beat Poets and key Icelandic poetry. He told Mugison that this knowledge was crucial, as it could lend itself to conversations all over the world, no matter where you were from or where you were. Another aspect of the teacher/pupil scenario included a field trip on how to look at women, an invaluable lesson. This union has led to a lifelong friendship with Kjartan H Gr√©tarsson creating subsequent cover art for the album Mugiboogie. Having learnt the tricks of the trade from Kjartan H Gr√©tarsson, Mugison moved to Reykjav√≠k in 1993 at the age of 17. This was the year Nirvana released In Utero and Bj√∂rk put out Debut, both highly influential albums in Mugison's life. He attended Hamrahl√≠√∞ask√≥li Menntask√≥li. He chose this particular school as so many artists had graduated from there, most notably P√°ll √ìskar who Mugison was a huge fan of. During his time at Hamrahl√≠√∞ask√≥li he befriended an influential character called Kiddi Kan√≠na who owned the iconic record shop Hlj√≥malind. Kiddi was very involved with the early careers of Sigur R√≥s and Bj√∂rk and turned Mugison onto artists such as Sonic Youth and Pavement. This was an important friendship which solidified Mugison's love of music and encouraged him to participate and explore. In 2000 Mugison went to London's Middlesex University SAE to complete a BA (Hons) in Recording Art. During his time in the UK he experimented with creating music on computers. Interested in creating more portable music options, Mugison visited an Apple Store to enquire when the laptop would be big enough to handle music, only to be told by a salesperson, unequivocally, that laptops wouldn't ever be big enough to make music. At the same time Bj√∂rk was predicting that all music would be made on laptops in the near future in various interviews she gave. Sharing the same vision as someone as influential as Bj√∂rk made Mugison even more determined that he was on the right path, so he purchased a second hand Apple 3G PowerBook with the sole intention to create music on it. During his studies in London, Digigram released the VX Pocket Soundcard. This new technology was so expensive that after Mugison purchased his prize possession he could not afford to pay rent for the rest of his semester, so had to sleep on friends sofas for the rest of his term in London. The investment was worth it and he began working on his debut album; Lonely Mountain. Whilst working on his debut album Mugison spent a lot of time listening to Andy Votel and Matthew Herbert, these electronic artists were very important to him and they both ran small record labels (Twisted Nerve Records & Accidental Records) and influenced his own music making. Upon completing the record, he made 10 burnt copies and sent them out to various labels in hope that a record label would release it. The CD was sent to all the usual suspects (4AD Records, XL Recordings etc.). He ran out of copies but wanted to contact Twisted Nerve Records so he rather charmingly farted in a mayonnaise jar, sealed the lid and posted it to the label accompanied by a note stating, if you like the smell of this fart, you'll love my music. Amazingly enough Andy Votel wrote back pledging to release his first split 7\\" single with Andy also featuring on the vinyl record. He also sent a copy to Matthew Herbert who ran Accidental Records, rather, it was more akin to a love letter as Mugison was a great admirer of his work. Matthew responded to the record and agreed to release his debut album on Accidental. The artwork for the record and all subsequent Mugison CDs were all handmade. The CD packaging was ambitious with Mugison and his family hand-stitching over 10,000 copies before putting them all on a boat to England. Matthew Herbert took Mugison under his wing and nurtured his talent, becoming another mentor to him. At this point Mugison had never played a live gig. In 2003 Herbert was booked on a three-week DJ tour of Japan, during this tour Herbert insisted he perform live, as his support act, thus Mugison began to finesse his live performance one man show. The Mugison show in the early days consisted of himself, alone with a guitar and various gadgets. Sometimes a little tipsy. Always shambolic. He built himself 'The Mugibox', a box, no bigger than a suitcase, that contained all the equipment he needed to go out on the road (including his pants). He had discovered Ableton Live by this point, and played around with looping and various other tricks that the software enabled him to conjure up. He played wild, crashing guitar while mixing vocals and distorted breathing through a laptop. There weren't many other performers at this time using Ableton Live, thus giving him a slight edge in that particular area. Mugison was booked to play at S√≥nar 2003 in Barcelona which turned out to be a monumental turning point in his career. Having grown disillusioned in his short time period of playing live, he treated S√≥nar as his last live gig. Playing in a basement parking garage, there were a handful of people to watch him, when suddenly, seconds after he started playing, the entire basement filled up with hundreds of people. Wishing to 'go out in a blaze of glory' Mugison played the gig of his life. The crowd lapped it up, and consequently became the talk of the festival. Unbeknownst to Mugison, the reason for the sudden influx of people was because it had begun raining outside, however, the set was a hit and spurred him on to persevere with the live element of his career. S√≥nar 2003 was a turning point and because of the good publicity and general industry buzz created as a direct result of the show he was booked to tour many headline tours around France, UK, Netherlands and Denmark. Touring became part of his life, one particular highlight was touring around Europe with fellow Icelandic band M√∫m during 2004. A fortuitous chance encounter with Gruff Rhys from Super Furry Animals in London during 2003 led to Mugison Supporting the Welsh band at The Royal Festival Hall. This was a particular highlight during his early career. After many tours during 2003/4 Mugison returned to Isafjordur and was asked to create the soundtrack to an Icelandic Film Niceland. Having no studio to create, the town kindly lent him the church in which he could record. By early autumn 2004 Mugison had finished his second album Mugimama Is This Monkey Music? which was recorded in an abandoned house in Isafjordur, also generously donated by the town. He moved to Reykjavik to release the album and perform at Iceland Airwaves Festival 2004. His official gig at NASA was packed and he could feel that something was happening, something big. Mugison was getting popular with the gig going fraternity. He also had his album release party at the (now defunct) NASA venue, which completely sold out. The album gained critical and commercial success. = Aldrei F√≥r √©g Su√∞ur Festival = Aldrei f√≥r √©g su√∞ur (I Never Went South) Festival is a music festival Mugison first held in 2004. It is the brainchild of Mugison and his father, Gu√∞mundur Kristj√°nsson, who came up with the idea after playing on a music festival in London in 2003, and is named after Bubbi Morthens song of the same name. Mugison got the idea while in London one summer performing at a Rough Trade music festival that lineup included a host of up-and-coming talent. He thought it would be fun to put on a similar festival only a bigger and more weird in Isafj√∂rdur. Mugison talked to some musician friends and everyone got excited about the idea. They even talked to Bj√∂rk [about playing] when they met her downtown when they were drunk. She said they were ‚Äúcutie pies\\" and for a long time they thought that meant ‚Äúyes\\". Even though Bj√∂rk declined to perform, plenty of other people got excited about the idea of an all-day music festival where the only remuneration would be a damn good time. They figured Sigur R√≥s were too big so they asked them if they could just come over and do an acoustic set. And they showed up in cowboy hats and were doing hillbilly versions of all their old tunes. Mugison invited popular acts to perform, but he also extended the invitation to musicians with far lower profiles everyone from the local elementary-school choir to high-school garage bands to Isafj√∂rdur leather-sporting hair-metal act The Nine Elevens. The festival rules for playing there are strict. No soundchecks and no backstage allowed, and each performing act would be informed of their playing order until just 10 minutes of getting on stage. There would be no monetary compensation, as all entrance would be free. The inaugural festival in the spring of 2004 took place in a fish factory, followed the next year by a different factory that was in the middle of being converted to a theatre but still had fire-hazardous plastic sheets covering the inside walls. = Mirstumenti Project = The Mirstumenti is an electronic music instrument conceived by Mugison and his sound engineer. The idea for the Mirstument came during a tour in Europe in 2003, shortly after Sonar 2003. At the time Mugison was a one-man-band. Mugison and Palli (the sound-engineer) were fantasising about an alternative setup which didn't involve just putting a lot of controllers on a table, hooking up adapters and cables to all the midi stuff. They thought it should be more of an instrument, so that people could see what was going on, and with just have one on/off button. The main component is the 192 button keyboard which is an AXIS 64, using the \\"harmony table\\" or \\"Melodic table\\", with button controllers fitted around it. Mugison and his engineer also built a floor- station switch with many buttons, hiding the computer (\\"out of sight, out of mind\\"). The duo have also built a light-system that syncs with everything. Mugison will premier the instrument at the inaugural Sonar Reykjavik in February 2013. = Further career = 2005 saw Mugison go global with the musician playing approximately 200 gigs in one year whilst supporting his second album Mugimama Is This Monkey Music? . Gig highlights included supporting Fant√¥mas in London at the HMV forum and playing Roskilde festival. He also shared stages with Jos√© Gonz√°lez and Hot Chip. The album was released in North America by Mike Pattons label IPECAC Records and Accidental Records released the album throughout Europe. He also created another soundtrack for a film by the name of A Little Trip To Heaven During 2006 Mugison established his record label Mugiboogie, he was also growing tired of the computer troubadour label and wanted to play some rock and roll with a band. He moved back to The Westfjords with his young family, bought a house, converted the garage into a studio and started jamming with friends, this was going to be the basis of the next record. Gig highlights of 2006 include: playing G-festival in the Faroe Islands and playing SPOT Festival for the second time (first time with a band) 2007 saw the release of Mugiboogie, his third studio album in October. Mugison wanted the album to sound timeless, so that you could not identify when it was recorded, the album comprises many different rock influenced styles including heavy, light and George Harrison-esq sounds. The idea was for it to sound like a 'Best Of' album. Following the release of Mugiboogie in Europe on his own label and Ipecac Records in North America, a booking agent from William Morris approached him to represent his touring interests in North America. Mugiboogie sold over 10,000 records in Iceland alone, with no radio support. Gig highlights in 2008 supporting his third studio album include: supporting Queens Of The Stone Age during their 2008 Canadian Tour. First US tour - from NY to LA in three weeks. 2 piece band- setup with his good friend Dav√≠√∞ √û√≥r J√≥nsson Popkomm in Berlin - the day Iceland went bankrupt The Nightmare Before Christmas Curated by The Melvins and Mike Patton (ATP Festival) Three headline tours around Europe plus a second appearance at Roskilde Festival 2008. 2009 saw Mugison release a live album called 'A Reminder' which contained a few songs which had been modified over the years. He sold this through his website and completed a sold-out tour of Iceland with Bj√∂rgvin G√≠slasson Mugison was also asked to participate in an Amnesty International charity event whereby he played all 5 Boroughs in New York- in one day. 2011 saw the release of his fourth and most successful to date studio album; Hagl√©l. The album sold in excess of 30,000 during 2011. Recorded entirely in Icelandic, and recorded on a simple two-track soundcard the album was casually recorded with friends in various houses and home made studios. Due to the phenomenal success of the record, Mugison was able to pay off various debts and as a thank you gesture to the people that bought the album he did three free concerts in Reykjavik at Harpa in December 2011. He performed the three concerts in one day, and they were all at maximum capacity. The middle performance was filmed live to air on RUV and transpired to be the highest rated TV show on RUV during 2011. Mugison also travelled around the country and performed free concerts in the following towns: Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur, Vestmannaeyjar, Bolungarvik and Akureyri (where he did 2 concerts). All Mugison's albums are handmade, so to create 30,000 became a full-time job for some of his friends and family.

His father is a karaoke singer and as the crowds at the karaoke bars in the small fishing villages they were touring had problems pronouncing his name they came to call him Mugison. Mugison is the Icelandic naming convention for the surname of someone who is the son of Muggi.\\"Interview with Mugison\\". De sorte spejdere at Iceland Airwaves, 19 October 2007. Retrieved on 11 November 2007. After returning to Isafjordur in 2002, Mugison met his partner R√∫na Esrad√≥ttir. They currently live in the Westfjords in a town called S√∫√∞av√≠k with their two sons, next door to R√∫na's mother's house. Family is extremely important to Mugison. His wife always plays on his records as well as his extended family. He had been away from my family and friends since he went to study in London. So he made a manifesto for Mugimama - that everyone that works with him on the album should be close to the musician, that was really practical.

Description Black mulga typically grows to a height of about and often has a weeping habit. It usually has just one trunk and has grey fissured bark on the trunk and larger branches. Like most Acacia species, it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. These are a grey-olive colour, and may be up to long and about wide. The flowers are yellow, and held in cylindrical clusters. The pods are around long and have a lemon-green felty covering. From a distance black mulga is similar to mulga but it can be distinguished by its dark bark. Distribution The tree is endemic to the Pilbara and northern parts of the Mid West regions of Western Australia, it occurs along creeks and rivers in the semi-arid land north of Carnarvon and Meekatharra where it is often situated in rocky river and creek beds, on stony plains and on rocky ridges growing in stony loam or clay loam, alluvium or red sandy soils.

Life Born in London, Sillitoe was educated at St Paul's Cathedral School (then St Paul's Cathedral Choir School). By 1908 he had become a Trooper in the British South Africa Police and in 1911 transferred to the Northern Rhodesia Police. During the First World War he took part in the German East Africa campaign. After serving as a political officer in Tanganyika from 1916 to 1920, he returned to England with his family. In 1923 he was appointed Chief Constable of Chesterfield, a position he held for the next two years. After a further year as Chief Constable of the East Riding of Yorkshire in 1925, he became in 1926 the Chief Constable of Sheffield, where he was credited with authorising \\"reasonable force\\" to break the hold of criminal gangs.(2004-09-23).

During his time as Chief Constable of Glasgow, he was also credited with the introduction of wireless radios allowing communication between headquarters and vehicles, which previously relied completely upon the use of police boxes, use of civilians in police-related roles, and the introduction of compulsory retirement after 30 years service. He is further credited with the introduction of the Sillitoe Tartan which is more commonly recognized as the black and white diced pattern on police cap bands, originally based on that used by several Scottish regiments on the Glengarry. In 1944 Sillitoe was made the Chief Constable of Kent and he employed Barbara Denis de Vitre to lead the women's force. When she arrived Kent had two policewomen and the following year there were nearly 150. Sillitoe went on to head MI5. His reputation was damaged by the 1951 defection to the Soviet Union of the spies Guy Burgess and Donald Duart Maclean, and by the investigation afterwards, which showed that MI5 had been unaware and slow to act.Anthony Blunt: His Lives, by Miranda Carter, 2001.

History  In 1988 there were ninety-seven public corporations, reduced from 111 in the early 1980s as a result of administrative reforms. Public companies at the national level were normally affiliated with one of the economic ministries, although the extent of direct management and supervision varied. The government divided the national-level corporations into several categories. The first included the main public service and monopoly corporations: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation, Japanese National Railways, and Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corporation (now Japan Tobacco). However, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation was privatized in 1985, and the Japanese National Railways in 1987, and Japan Tobacco and Salt Corporation in 1988. The second category included the major development corporations devoted to housing, agriculture, highways, water resources, ports, energy resources, and urban development projects. The Japanese Highway operators were changed into public-owned private corporations in 2005. In 2003, Japan Post was formed out of the former government-run postal services, but privatization is still pending and a major issue in Japanese politics. Other categories of corporations included those charged with special government projects, loans and finance, and special types of banking. Local public corporations were involved with utilities. Public corporations benefited the economy in several ways. Some, like Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation before privatization, were important sources of technology development funds or centers around which private industry could cluster. Others provided vital public services that private industry would find impossible to finance. The development banks, particularly the Japan Development Bank, were sources of long-term investment funds and instrumental in shaping the pattern of industry, especially in the early postwar period. Because public corporations also added revenue to the national budget and were, theoretically, self-financing they required little from the government in the way of financial support. They also provided employment for retired bureaucrats. The reemployment of retired bureaucrats as advisers to these corporations as well as to many private-sector firms was rather common, especially in the late 1960s and early 1970s, under the title amakudari (descent from heaven). The practice was most prevalent in the highly regulated banking, steel, and transportation industries but was also found throughout the Japanese economy.

It is the largest public hospital in Uganda. Location The hospital is on Mulago Hill in the northern part of the city of Kampala, immediately west of the Makerere University College of Health Sciences. It is approximately , by road, north- east of Kampala's central business district. The geographical coordinates of the hospital are 0¬∞20'16.0\\"N, 32¬∞34'32.0\\"E (Latitude:0.337786; Longitude:32.575550). Overview This hospital, together with adjacent, affiliated hospitals and institutions constitute Mulago Hospital Complex, the teaching facility of the Makerere University College of Health Sciences. The hospital offers services in most medical and surgical subspecialties, in addition to dentistry, emergency medicine, pediatrics, and intensive care. History Old Mulago Hospital was founded in 1913 by Albert Ruskin Cook. New Mulago Hospital was completed in 1962. The hospital has an official capacity of 1,790 beds, although it often houses over 3,000 patients. In 2012, the annual hospital budget was USh33.2 billion. \\"Apparently, to run effectively, Mulago needs thrice its current budget.\\" Mulago Hospital Complex Mulago Hospital Complex is a term used to refer to the hospitals on Mulago Hill and the adjacent and affiliated medical institutions that serve as the teaching entity for Makerere University College of Health Science. As of April 2020, the complex housed an estimated 1,800 hospital beds. These units of the complex include the following: * Old Mulago Hospital with 200 beds * Mulago Women's Referral Hospital with 450 beds * Mulago National Specialized Hospital with 1,000 beds * Infectious Diseases InstituteUganda Heart Institute*Uganda Cancer Institute** with 80 beds Note 1*: Infectious Diseases Institute is a component of Makerere University. Note 2**: Uganda Cancer Institute and Uganda Heart Institute are self- accounting bodies, separate from Mulago Hospital. Some credible sources reserve the term to refer to only the combination of (a) Old Mulago Hospital (b) Mulago Women's Referral Hospital and (c) Mulago National Specialized Hospital. Renovations In October 2014, major renovations and rehabilitation works commenced at the hospital, the purpose of which was to bring about structural and performance improvements. These works, estimated to last 24 months, were the largest renovation works to the facility since the New Mulago (Lower Mulago) hospital block was completed 52 years earlier. The work was budgeted to cost US$29 million and the equipment was budgeted to cost US$20 million (sub-total US$49 million), financed by a loan from the African Development Bank. The government of Uganda had to co-fund US$9.5 million, bringing total cost to US$54.5 million. As part of the planned changes, the intensive care unit was enlarged from 7 beds to 41 beds, of which 27 are adult beds and 14 are pediatric beds. The mortuary was expanded from 16 to 160 slots; and, the number of operating theatres were increased from 7 to 22. Other changes include the decrease of total beds from 1,500 to 1,000. Of those, 900 beds are general inpatient beds, 6 are platinum beds for high net- worth individuals, 45 are gold rooms, and 49 are VVIP rooms. There will be a fee for service, the nature and amount to be determined by cabinet. In May 2019, the Cabinet of Uganda authorized the release of USh35.5 billion (US$9.5 million) to complete the renovations to the hospital. As of that date, the pending work, estimated at 8 percent of the total, included new windows, an ICT network installation, 6 new sub-terrain tanks, and expansion of the road network within the hospital complex. Once the funds are released, work is expected to take five months to completion.

Vision was formed in the months leading up to the 2005 municipal election.  Formation  A centre-left civic party, Vision was founded by former Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) members first elected to Vancouver City Council in 2002. Following that election, Mayor Larry Campbell and Councillors Jim Green, Raymond Louie and Tim Stevenson were dubbed \\"COPE Light\\" by the local media due to their moderate positions on taxation and development, as opposed to the more leftist \\"COPE Classic\\" councillors. Ongoing disagreements between the two factions led to Campbell and his allies forming an independent COPE caucus in December 2004. At the same time, supporters of Campbell and his allies created a fundraising organization independent of COPE called \\"Friends of Larry Campbell\\". This group and its backers eventually formed a new party called \\"Vision Vancouver\\", initially to be led by Campbell. However, when Campbell announced that he would not seek a second term as mayor, he called on Jim Green to run to succeed him. The party decided in August 2005 to run only five of a possible ten Council candidates and did not contest school board and park board slate elections. In the November 2005 election for Vancouver City Council, four Vision Vancouver candidates (Raymond Louie, Tim Stevenson, Heather Deal and George Chow) were elected, but the party's mayoral candidate, Jim Green, was defeated by the Non-Partisan Association's (NPA) Sam Sullivan. Six members of the Non-Partisan Association were elected along with one for COPE.  In power (2008‚Äì2018)  For the November 2008 election, Vision was seen as a serious contender for control of the city due to the perceived unpopularity of the Sam Sullivan's NPA team. In June 2008, Vision held an election to nominate their mayoral candidate. The choices were Gregor Robertson (a local \\"green\\" businessman, owner of the Happy Planet juice company and a provincial New Democratic Party member of the Legislative Assembly for Vancouver-Fairview), Raymond Louie (serving as a Vision city councillor), and Allan De Genova (an independent Vancouver Park Board commissioner who defected from the NPA because of his dislike of Sullivan's leadership). The original dynamic for this contest shifted when the NPA voted to change their mayoral candidate, replacing the incumbent Sullivan with longtime councillor and businessman Peter Ladner, the editor of the Business in Vancouver newspaper. Gregor Robertson was nominated to be Vision's mayoral candidate in 2008 despite his perceived similarity to NPA rival Sam Sullivan. Under the direction of mayoral candidate Gregor Robertson, Vision Vancouver responded to COPE's requests (dating back to a change in leadership at COPE in May 2007) to negotiate an electoral coalition with COPE and the Green Party of Vancouver (who ran joint slates with COPE in previous years). Vision Vancouver, COPE and the Greens agreed to support Gregor Robertson as mayor, avoid running competing slates and coordinate other elements of the election. On November 15, 2008, Gregor Robertson was elected mayor of Vancouver and the Vision‚ÄìCOPE‚ÄìGreen coalition came to power. The only Vision Vancouver candidate who was not elected was Kashmir Dhalliwal. In the 2011 Vancouver municipal election, held on November 19, Gregor Robertson was re-elected mayor of Vancouver. All Vision Vancouver candidates were elected. In the 2014 election, held on November 15, Gregor Robertson was re-elected mayor of Vancouver. The slate also retained its majority on City Council, the School Board, and the Park Board. In 2017, Vision lost one seat on council in a by-election to Hector Bremner of the NPA. Vision ran a slate of candidates in the 2018 electionincluding Heather Deal, Catherine Evans, Diego Cardona, Tanya Paz and Wei Qiao Zhangfor City Council. Ian Campbell was intended to be the slate's mayoral candidate, but several days before nominations were due, he withdrew from the race. The election resulted in Vision losing their majority on all three elected bodies and losing all but one race, for a seat on the Vancouver School Board which was held by incumbent Allan Wong.

CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank (FCIB) is a financial services company based in Barbados and the Caribbean subsidiary of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). The bank was founded in 2002 as FirstCaribbean International Bank through the merger of the Caribbean operations of Barclays Bank and CIBC, and in March 2006 both CIBC and Barclays announced that Barclays wished to exercise their option to exit the Caribbean venture completely resulting in CIBC gaining majority-control of the bank. In June 2011, it was announced the bank would be renamed CIBC FirstCaribbean Bank \\"to be more closely aligned to the CIBC brand, while still maintaining the FirstCaribbean name and local identity.\\" The majority of the bank's revenues are generated by its operations in Barbados, the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. History Prior to 2002, the operations of what is now FirstCaribbean were run as the separate businesses of Barclays Bank and CIBC West Indies, part of CIBC's group of companies. Barclays had been active in the region since 1836 and CIBC's foray into the region began with branches in Jamaica in 1920. In March 2006, CIBC officials announced their intention of buying majority control of their publicly held Caribbean joint venture the FirstCaribbean International Bank. The deal costing just over US$1billion (Bds$2 billion) would purchase the current 43.7% owned by Barclays Bank PLC and would raise CIBC's current ownership to 87.4%, from 43.7%. Upon closure of the deal, the top four Caribbean commercial banks would be consolidated merely to a top three, with those being Scotiabank, the FirstCaribbean International Bank, and the Royal Bank of Canada with a possible distant fourth-place bank varying in each territory. Following the deal, the regional head-office for FCI is expected to remain located in Barbados, with that regional centre continuing to report to the Toronto CIBC head-office. The deal closed on December 23, 2006. =CIBC shares acquisition= On March 13, 2006, CIBC and Barclays announced that they had signed a non-binding letter of intent enabling CIBC to acquire 43.7% of the shares of FCIB from Barclays. Upon completion of the transaction, CIBC's ownership was to increase to approximately 87.4% of FCIB. CIBC announced on 22 December 2006 that it had purchased 599,401,230 shares of FirstCaribbean from Barclays for US$988,652,389 (representing US$1.62 per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends). Barclays also retained their option to tender all or a part of the remaining holdings of 66,600,137 shares. Thereafter, CIBC proceeded with a mandatory purchase offer to all remaining shareholders at US$1.62 per share and wound up holding 91.5% of First Caribbean International Bank. FirstCaribbean is not the only Canadian controlled bank in the region: Scotiabank, and the Royal Bank of Canada also have extensive commercial banking businesses in the region and treat the region as a native market. = Cancelled plans for United States IPO= In March 2018, CIBC announced that it had filed a Registration Statement on Form F-1 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission relating to a proposed initial public offering (IPO) in the United States of CIBC FirstCaribbean's common shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Through the IPO, CIBC would divest itself of most of its 91.5% stake in FCIB to refocus capital and management resources on its other North American operations. Due to a lack of interest in the American markets for FCIB's share, the application for an IPO was withdrawn by the company on April 19, 2018.

He is the central character in That Yellow Bastard, and has a small cameo in Just Another Saturday Night. Miller has announced he will be the main character of another story, set before That Yellow Bastard.  Appearance  At the start of That Yellow Bastard, Hartigan is \\"pushing 60.\\" He has a distinguishing cross-shaped scar on his forehead. He is presented as a muscular and imposing man, capable of holding his own in almost any fight. He also suffers from angina, which consistently affects his work, despite his attempts to ignore and fight through it. He is almost always dressed professionally, most commonly wearing an oxford shirt, tie, and dress slacks, along with his signature trenchcoat.  Personality  A veteran police detective of Basin City, Hartigan is gruff, stoic, and cynical. He is also completely selfless; he cares little about his own well-being as long as he can protect his fellow citizens. He risks his own safety and reputation to achieve safety for those he cares about, but this dedication eventually destroys his life. Hartigan possesses a seemingly indomitable will, able to withstand multiple bullet wounds without collapsing, and most notably being capable of willing himself back to life after being hanged. Hartigan has a distinctive way of narrating: he often talks to himself in his head, referring to himself as \\"stupid old man\\". Det. John Hartigan on the cover of Sin City: That Yellow Bastard 2nd Edition.  In That Yellow Bastard  Hartigan's last case prior to his retirement is the investigation of a serial killer and rapist who preys on prepubescent girls. He eventually discovers that the killer is in fact Roark Junior, the son of Basin City's most powerful family. Despite rampant corruption in the legal system and numerous attempts on his life by Senator Roark (the killer's father), he pursues the case. On his last night on the job, Hartigan is called to rescue Junior's newest intended victim, 11-year-old Nancy Callahan. His partner Bob (who is secretly on the Roark family's payroll) begs him to let the case go, but Hartigan refuses, punching Bob out and proceeding to the crime scene alone. Once there, he dispatches Roark Junior's henchmen and brutally punishes Roark Junior, shooting off the rapist's left ear, right hand, and genitals. Before Hartigan can kill Junior, however, Bob arrives on the scene and shoots Hartigan in the back several times, and in the chest shortly thereafter. That night, Senator Roark visits Hartigan in the hospital, telling Hartigan that he will be framed for raping Nancy, and threatens to kill anyone who knows the truth. He pays to cure Hartigan's angina to ensure the detective will suffer as long as possible. Hartigan never confesses to the crime during the trial, but he does not say a word concerning Junior's guilt and allows himself to be convicted as a child molester. Over the next eight years, everyone he loves abandons him ‚Äî except for Nancy, who worships him and writes him a letter every week. Nancy becomes his only reason to live; he accepts his fate so long as he believes she is safe. Eight years later, the letters stop coming. At first, Hartigan suspects Nancy has simply outgrown him. However, someone then sends him a letter containing a human finger, and a stranger with bright yellow skin and a horrible odor visits Hartigan in person. Afraid for Nancy's safety, Hartigan confesses to raping her at his next parole hearing so he can protect her. With Senator Roark's approval, Hartigan is granted parole. Hartigan then seeks out Nancy at her last known address, a strip club known as Kadie's Bar. Nancy rushes into his arms and kisses him upon his arrival, and after their brief reunion, Hartigan realizes that he has been tricked into revealing Nancy's location. He flees the bar with Nancy, hiding in a cheap motel to try to evade the Roarks. During their stay at the motel, Hartigan resists Nancy's advances, albeit reluctantly. The stranger from earlier then finds and kidnaps both of them, revealing himself to be none other than Junior, alive but horribly disfigured by the medical treatments he underwent to repair the damage Hartigan caused. He leaves Hartigan at the end of a noose to die. Through sheer force of will, he escapes from the trap and pursues Junior and Nancy back to the Roark family farm, where he rescues Nancy and then re-castrates Junior (this time with his bare hands) before beating him to death. After sharing a kiss with Nancy, he instructs her to leave the farm, telling her he will expose the Roarks and clear his name. However, upon her departure, he commits suicide with his own gun, narrating that this is the only way to truly protect Nancy from the Roark family.  Film appearance  Bruce Willis as Hartigan. Hartigan is portrayed by Bruce Willis in the 2005 film adaptation of Sin City. According to many interviews, Willis, upon seeing one or two minutes of The Customer is Always Right short that Robert Rodriguez had brought with him as a proof of concept tool to get actors and other talent (most notably Frank Miller) on board, paused the DVD, turned to Rodriguez and said that whatever he saw from that point onwards, he wanted to be part of the project. Michael Douglas was considered for the role before Willis came on board. Willis reprised the role in 2014's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, where he portrayed Hartigan's ghost. He continues to watch over Nancy, attempting to dissuade her from avenging his death. He ultimately saves her from her would- be murderer, Senator Roark, by distracting him just long enough for her to kill the Senator.

For several centuries this name stood for an area stretching approximately between the Adda river in the east and the Sesia river in the west, and between the San Gottardo Pass in the north and the Po river in the south, thus it was a synonym of the Milan region and the countryside areas gravitating towards it. Flag of the Duchy of Milan and modern symbol of Insubria History Polybius claims the Insubres founded the city of Milan around 600 BC. They were a Celtic or Ligurian people which dwelt in the 4th‚Äì5th century BC in the area of pre-Alpine lakes (the Italian Lakes) and Milan. The name Insubres is visible in the middle portion of the Tabula Peutingeriana. The symbol of Insubria (when conceived as the Duchy of Milan) is the Milanese Ducal flag, the Visconti child-swallowing serpent quartered with the Imperial eagle. For further details, see the Duchy of Milan. Regio Insubrica Euroregion At present, the meaning of the term Insubria is perceived as more restricted, as it indicates the territory of the cross- boundary cooperation community Regio Insubrica, which was set up in 1995 by the Italian provinces of Varese, Como, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola together with the Swiss Canton Ticino: that is to say, the lakes area between Italy and Switzerland where the Italian language is spoken. The Regio Insubrica was recently extended to the territories of the provinces of Novara and Lecco. It is a Euroregion (complying with the Madrid Agreement by the Council of Europe) which promotes cross-boundary cooperation in the Italian-Swiss region of the three pre-Alpine lakes (i.e., Lake Como, Lake Lugano and Lake Maggiore). Linguistics From an ethnolinguistic viewpoint, Insubria also comprises the provinces of Novara, Lecco, Milan, and Lodi, that is, those areas in which the Western Lombard or Insubrian variety of Lombard language is spoken and which correspond to the territory of the former Duchy of Milan until its takeover by the Habsburg Empire as a result of the Treaty of Baden in 1714 or, better said, of the Treaty of Campo Formio (1797), which marks the end of the first Austrian domination. Modern and contemporary uses The word \\"Insubria\\" was considered for long a mere synonym of Lombardy, especially in the Ducal age, that is, from the late Middle Ages to the Renaissance. From the 14th to the 17th century, among the men of letters at the Milan Ducal Court, the terms \\"Insubre\\" and \\"Insubria\\" were used to give awareness of unity and a higher national identity to the still vital autonomous communes. \\"Insubria\\" thus denoted the core of the then extensive Duchy of Milan, as attested in the writings of Benzo d'Alessandria, Giovanni Simonetta, Thomas Coryat, Bernardino Corio and Andrea Alciato. In the 17th century Gabriele Verri reaffirmed that concept using the following motto, which he placed as a heading in all his works: \\"Insubres sumus, non latini\\" (\\"We are Insubrians, not Latins\\"). In 1797, following the occupation of the Duchy of Milan by the French, Napoleon I had the Milan mint strike a commemorative medal with the dedication \\"All'Insubria Libera\\" (\\"To Free Insubria\\") and an allegory of the French Republic, which was represented as a woman wearing a headpiece and helped on the right hand by Peace, who places the Phrygian cap onto Insubria's head. Insubria is led by a putto and has a horn of plenty at her feet. In the 1930s, a review called Insubria was published, whose aim was promoting tourism and culture of the pre-Alpine lakes area. The term fell into oblivion until the 1990s, when Insubria came into favour again because of a series of events, the first of which was the founding (in 1995) of the above-mentioned \\"Regio Insubrica\\", a cross-boundary cooperation community whose aim is to promote the cultural, economic and social elements which draw Italian Switzerland and the border provinces together. The newspaper La Prealpina, followed by others, added a daily page headed \\"Insubria\\" reporting local political news. In 1996 the Terra Insubre Cultural Association was officially set up in Varese; its purposes are the spreading and promotion of the history and natural environment of the Insubrian territory to a vast audience. At present (2006) the association has about 1500 members and two detached branches (Milan and Marcallo con Casone), as well as a quarterly review also named Terra Insubre. In those same years (i.e. July 14, 1998) the University of Insubria was set up as the university pole of the towns of Varese and Como. Insubrism In recent years, some politicians have begun to debate the possibility of institutionally constituting Insubria and/or gaining its political autonomy. However, as of today there exist no political parties striving for that goal, but only some cultural and opinion movements. At the beginning of 2002 the \\"Movimento degli Indipendenti Insubrici\\" (\\"Insubrian Independence Movement\\") was constituted in the Ticino Canton, and later in the Graub√ºnden Canton. It was led by Werner Nussbaumer, a physician from Gravesano, former member of the Greens and known for his actions aimed at promoting Cannabis indica for therapeutical purposes. The \\"Indipendenti Insubrici\\" had Nussbaumer as their representative in the Gran Consiglio of the Ticino Canton from January 2003 to the following elections in the same year, though he had been originally elected in 1999 among the Greens. The president of the movement in the Insubrian Graub√ºnden was Giancarlo Gruber. Following internal party problems and Nussbaumer's arrest on May 22, 2003, the group disappeared from the political scene. The activities of Dom√† Nunch opinion group, the promoter of the \\"El Dragh Bloeu\\" online review, started in 2005. The movement was officially presented in Piazza Insubria, Milan, on February 6, 2006. Dom√† Nunch has no institutional representatives, but it mainly organizes conferences, rallies and popular fairs; among them the annual Insubrian National Day every September 5, to celebrate the foundation of the Duchy of Milan; the Forum on the Environmental Emergencies in Insubria, which took place in March 2007 in Uboldo; the Forum on the Milanese Language in April 2007 in Nerviano, which reconciled the biggest linguistic associations of the region; the summit Olona: A Broken Valley in March 2008 in Gorla Minore; the three-day Olona Valley Festival in June 2008; and the rallies against the Pedemontana highway project on November 2009 and February 2010. Dom√† Nunch draws its inspiration from the principles of eco-nationalism, that is to say, a synthesis of environmentalism and requests for the protection of Insubrian cultural identity; it promotes the project of an Insubrian Confederation, based on the Swiss state model. \\"Dom√† Nunch\\" could be translated from Insubric language as \\"Only Us\\" or \\"Only Our\\", \\"El Dragh Bloeu\\" as \\"The Blue Dragon\\".

It targets Nordic countries and has a separate channel in Sweden (C More Film). The main competitors of C More Entertainment are Viasat Film and Viasat Sport, which are part of Nordic Entertainment Group (NENT) since 2018. Since 30 October 2012, the C More channels in Finland are bundled with MTV Oy's premium channels.MTV ‚Äì Media uudistaaa maksu mtv.fi Retrieved 1 October 2018 The combined package was initially named MTV3 Total (later MTV Total) but was changed back to C More in 2017. Ownership history South African company MultiChoice launched the Nordic version of FilmNet in 1985, and SuperSport followed in 1995. The channels were renamed Canal+ in 1997 after MultiChoice sold most of its European operations to French company Groupe Canal+. In 2003, two private equity firms, Baker Capital and Nordic Capital, acquired 100% of Canal+ Television from the international media conglomerate Vivendi Universal. At the same time, the company changed its legal name to C More Entertainment, but it retained the right to use the ‚ÄúCanal+‚Äù trademark. On February 9, 2005, SBS Broadcasting Group announced the acquisition of C More Entertainment. Belgian SBS channels VT4 and VIJFtv launched their VOD offering under the C-More brand in October 2006. On June 16, 2008, Swedish TV4 Gruppen announced it had acquired C More Entertainment from German ProSiebenSat.1 Media (which acquired SBS) for ‚Ç¨320 million. In May 2010 Telenor bought 35% of shares in C More Entertainment from TV4 Gruppen for SEK787 million, but sold them back in 2014. Programming C More Entertainment operated over 20 SD channels in the Nordic region and eleven HD channels in September 2012. = 1990s = C More Entertainment was originated from the Filmnet channel created in 1985. In the early 1990s, Filmnet became two channels: Filmnet Plus and The Complete Movie Channel: Filmnet. They were later rebranded as Filmnet 1 and Filmnet 2. Canal+ bought Filmnet in 1996 and the two channels were renamed on September 1, 1997. Filmnet 1 became \\"Canal+\\" with localized versions for the different Nordic countries and Filmnet 2 became the pan-Nordic \\"Canal+ Gul/Canal+ Kulta\\" (English: \\"Canal+ Yellow\\", following the colour naming pattern used by Canal+ in France and other countries). A third channel \\"Canal+ Bl√•/Canal+ Sininen\\" (Blue) was created on September 3, 1999. = 2000s = \\"Canal+ Zap/ R√∏d/Punainen\\" (Red) was launched on September 22, 2001, allowing cable and satellite viewers to choose an alternative match to watch during fixtures of the FA Premier League and National Hockey League. The channels were redesigned on May 1, 2004. The three colour-coded mixed channels were replaced with four themed channels. The Canal+ line-up consisted of the main Canal+ channel, Canal+ Film 1 and Canal+ Film 2 showing new movies, the all-sports channel Canal+ Sport, and C More Film, a channel showing older films. C More Film was the first channel to use the C More name. The line-up was extended on September 1, 2005, when Canal+ Film 3, C More Film 2, and C More HD were launched. C More HD was the first HD channel for the Nordic region. Canal+ Film 1 was renamed \\"Canal+ Film\\". Canal+ Sport was split into country-specific channels. Canal+, which had been country-specific, became pan-Nordic. At the same time, IPTV operators in association with satellite operator Canal Digital launched an interactive VOD service called \\"Canal+ Play\\", accessed from the customer's set-top box, letting the viewers watch any seasons from any show ebroadcast on Canal+ and any movie that was showing on the channels. On satellite it has since been merged to the Canal Digital Go service, covering every channel on the platform and also available without a box online (much like its British equivalent Sky Go). On November 1, 2006, the C More Film and C More Film 2 channels were merged with Canal+ Film 2 and the main Canal+ channel was replaced by a bonus channel Canal+ Mix, showing series, entertainment, music, sports, children‚Äôs programmings, documentaries and movies. C More also introduced a new sports channel called Canal+ Sport 2. Three channels were renamed: Canal+ Film was renamed back to \\"Canal+ Film 1\\", Canal+ Sport became Canal+ Sport 1\\", and C More HD became \\"Canal+ HD\\". Customers previously could only subscribe to all channels, but customers were now able to only subscribe to the sports or movie channels. The \\"Canal+ Film\\" package consisted of Canal+ Film 1, 2 and 3 and \\"Canal+ Sport\\" consisted of Canal+ Sport 1 and 2. The full package was called \\"Canal+ Total\\" and contains Canal+ Mix and Canal+ HD as a bonus. On February 1, 2007, Canal+ HD was split to 2 channels in HD: Canal+ Film HD airs movies in HD and Canal+ Sport HD airs sports events in HD. In September 2007 a pay- per-view sports service called C Sports was launched in Sweden, Denmark and Norway. It was never launched in Finland or available in Finnish but could also be viewed there. The service initially showed single matches from Canal+ channels on a PPV basis, but soon after launch customers could also subscribe to a season ticket. This allowed them to view all matches from a chosen league during its season. In 2009 it was expanded to cover an archive of all shown matches and the ability to watch live streams of all Canal+ Sport's channels. The service is still available in all countries except for Finland, where the content of the service is now available through parent company MTV3's VOD service Katsomo. The channel were again redesigned on November 1, 2007. The movies and series channels were all renamed and recategorised. Canal+ Film 1 became \\"Canal+ First\\", specialized in new movies, as well as series and Canal+ Film 2 was replaced by \\"Canal+ Hits\\", specialized in classic and old movies. Canal+ Film 3 and Canal+ Mix were renamed \\"Canal+ Action\\", specialized in action movies and series and \\"Canal+ Drama\\", specialized in TV shows and movies related to drama and romantic and were joined by Canal+ Comedy which broadcasts movies in different genres. Canal+ Sport 1 and 2 kept their names but were joined by Canal+ Sport Extra which time-shared overnights with Canal 69, specialized in pornographic movies. In July 2009, C More Entertainment launched Canal 9, a new sports channel, and another program for men. Canal 9 was free for Canal+ Sport and Canal+ Total customers on cable, satellite and IPTV and shared many sports rights with Canal+ channels, along with its independently purchased rights commissioned by TV4 Gruppen. The station was modeled on the Finnish MTV3 Max. There have been discussions to rename MTV3 Max as Canal 9 Suomi. In November 2011 Canal 9 also launched in Norway. On October 1, 2009, Canal+ launched the SF-kanalen, a channel which broadcasts Swedish movies and miniseries from the libraries of Svensk Filmindustri. After TV4's purchase of the company, Canal+ and Svensk Filmindustri became part of the same corporation. SF-kanalen replaced Canal 69, which ceased operations the day before. = 2010s = On April 1, 2010, Canal+ Comedy was replaced by Canal+ Series. It was similar to Canal+ Hits, but it showed series from 8pm to midnight instead of movies, while from midnight to 8pm it showed movies. On May 14, 2010, C More Entertainment launched three sports channels named Canal+ Sport 3, Canal+ Football and Canal+ Hockey. Canal+ Sport 3 was only available in Norway. At the same time, many new sports rights were announced. Later that year Canal+ announced it would launch a second Finnish-language sports channel called Canal+ Aitio (English: Canal+ Skybox) in December, since it retained the Finnish rights to Premier League and UEFA Champions League matches. The new channel allowed broadcasting a second simultaneous match from the Premier League, previously only possible on FTA channels. Canal+ also launched a new channel for Finnish viewers called \\"Canal+ Urheilu\\". HD versions of the channels have since appeared on all platforms. On June 1, 2011, Canal+ launched two movies and series channels named Canal+ Family and Canal+ Emotion. Canal+ Family consists of family-oriented movies and children‚Äôs programmings. At the same time, Canal+ Drama was renamed as Canal+ Emotion. In May 2012, C More Entertainment announced it would rebrand itself as C More. While most channels kept their previous names (apart from replacing the Canal+ suffix with C More), some sports channels were renamed. Canal+ Sport 1 was changed to C More Sport, Canal+ Sport 2 was changed to C More Tennis, Canal+ Sport Extra to C More Extreme, and Canal+ Extra channels were renamed to C More Live. The only channels unchanged during the rebrand are Canal 9 and the Danish Canal 8 Sport, which was launched in August 2012 as the successor of Canal+ Sport 1 Denmark. C More Entertainment also announced that it would add documentaries as a new type of programming to complement their film programming. On 30 October 2012, C More channels in Finland were merged with MTV3 Kanavapaketti to form MTV3 Total. C More Urheilu (Sport), C More Aitio and C More Premier HD were renamed MTV3 MAX Sport 1, MTV3 MAX Sport 2 and MTV3 MAX Premier HD, respectively. The package was renamed MTV Total in the corporate-wide rebrand at MTV Oy in 2013, and then changed back to C More in 2017. As a result of the 2017 rebrand, MTV Oy's MTV Junior and MTV Max were renamed C More Juniori and C More Max, respectively. In October 2012, C More launched Filmnet in Sweden, an online streaming service to compete with Netflix and HBO Nordic. Filmnet was available in Norway and Finland in early 2013. In Denmark, C More worked with YouSee on a similar service called YouBio. The Filmnet-branded services were moved to the main C More website on 30 June 2015.

The British intended to sink obsolete ships in the canal entrance, to prevent German vessels from leaving port. The port was used by the Imperial German Navy as a base for U-boats and light shipping, which were a threat to Allied control of the English Channel and southern North Sea. Several attempts to close the Flanders ports by bombardment failed and Operation Hush, a 1917 plan to advance up the coast, proved abortive. As ship sinkings by U-boats increased, finding a way to close the ports became urgent and the Admiralty became more willing to consider a raid. An attempt to raid Zeebrugge was made on 2 April 1918 but was cancelled at the last moment, after the wind direction changed and made it impossible to lay a smokescreen to cover the ships. Another attempt was made on 23 April, with a concurrent attack on Ostend. Two of three blockships were scuttled in the narrowest part of the Bruges Canal and one of two submarines rammed the viaduct linking the shore and the mole, to trap the German garrison. The blockships were sunk in the wrong place and after a few days the Germans had opened the canal to submarines at high tide. However, valuable lessons were learned during the operation that would be put to use two decades later. Background =Strategic developments= At the end of 1916 a combined operation against Borkum, Ostend and Zeebrugge had been considered by Admiral Lewis Bayly, commander of the Coast of Ireland Station. The plan was rejected due to the difficulty of supplying a landing force and the vulnerability of such a force to a land counter-attack; subsequent proposals were rejected for the same reasons. A bombardment of the Zeebrugge lockgates under cover of a smoke screen was studied by Vice Admiral Sir Reginald Bacon, commander of the Dover Patrol and the Admiralty in late 1915 but was also rejected as too risky. In 1916, Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt proposed an attack to block Zeebrugge, which was rejected. Tyrwhitt suggested a more ambitious operation to capture the mole and the town as a prelude to advancing on Antwerp. Bacon was asked to give his opinion and rejected the plan, as did the Admiralty. Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes was appointed director of the Plans Division at the Admiralty in October 1917 and on 3 December, submitted another plan for the blocking of Zeebrugge and Ostend using old cruisers in a night attack in the period from Bacon also proposed an operation on 18 December, which combined Tyrwhitt's landing on the mole with a blocking operation. A monitor, , was to land on the mole, the monitor was to bombard the lock gates and fortifications from short range; blockships were to enter the harbour in the confusion. The raid was proposed in 1917 by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe but was not authorised until Keyes adapted Bacon's plan for a blocking operation, to make it difficult for German ships and submarines to leave the port. The raid was approved in January 1918 and volunteer crews were obtained from the Grand Fleet \\"to perform a hazardous service\\". =Tactical developments= The possibility of a landing on the Belgian coast was not abandoned, despite the number of rejected plans and early in 1917, Bacon assisted in the planning of Operation Hush, landings by the three brigades of the 1st Division around Middelkerke at the northern extremity of the Western Front. The operation was dependent on the advance of the British armies in the Third Battle of Ypres and had no influence on events at Zeebrugge and Ostend. If landings at the ports were successful, the forces involved would be doomed unless they were relieved by the advance of the armies in Flanders. Bacon devised a plan to destroy the lock gates at Zeebrugge by bombardment with the 15-inch guns of the monitors , and . The bombardment would have to be undertaken at long range, because of the danger of return fire from the Kaiser Wilhelm battery at Knokke and meant aiming at a target in area at a range of , using directions from an artillery-observation aircraft. Bacon calculated that would be necessary and that it would take at least to fire them. If the attempt began with surprise and the bombardment ships were obscured by a smoke screen, the German guns at Knokke might not have time accurately to return fire before the bombardment ended. Bacon thought that the destruction of the lock gates was worth the sacrifice of a monitor but that risking all three for no result was impossible to avoid. The plan needed a rare combination of wind, tide and weather; to obtain surprise the monitors would need to be in position before dawn. Mist and low cloud would make artillery observation from an aircraft impossible and the wind would have to be blowing from a narrow range of bearings or the smoke screen would be carried over the ships and out to sea, exposing them to view from the shore. Such conditions were unlikely to recur for several days, making a bombardment on the following day most unlikely. The bombardment force sailed for Zeebrugge three times but changes in the weather forced a return to England each time. On 11 May, Bacon ordered another attempt for the next day; a buoy was laid to the north-west of the mole as a guide and a second buoy was placed in the bombardment position. A bearing was taken from the buoy to the base of the mole at Zeebrugge by a ship sailing from the buoy to the mole, despite a mist which reduced visibility to a mile and the ship advancing perilously close to German shore batteries. The ship returned to the buoy by with the bearing and distance. The bombardment ships had taken position, the Motor Launches had formed a line, ready to generate the smokescreen and the escorts formed a square round the monitors. Five destroyers zigzagged around the fleet as a screen against U-boats, the minesweepers began operating around the monitors and the covering force cruised in the distance, ready to intercept a German destroyer sortie. Zeebrugge bombardment, 12 May 1917 The bombardment opened late because of the need to tow Marshal Soult, slowing the armada, and also by haze off the harbour. Two Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) artillery-observation aircraft from Dunkirk, which had taken off at , had to wait from over Zeebrugge for almost two hours. The aircraft were met by seven Sopwith Pups from 4 (Naval) Squadron RNAS, which patrolled the coast from as six Sopwith Triplanes of 10 (Naval) Squadron RNAS flew over the fleet. One of the artillery-observation aircraft had engine trouble and force-landed in the Netherlands; the other ran short of petrol. Firing from the monitors commenced just after and at first fell short; many of the shells failed to explode, which left the aircraft unable to signal the fall of shot. The bombardment became very accurate soon after and Marshal Soult hit the target with its twelfth shell and Erebus with its twenty-sixth. Terror was most hampered by the loss of one of the aircraft and by dud shells; only forty-five of the fired were reported and the observation aircraft had to return because of lack of fuel at leaving the last half-hour of the bombardment reliant on estimated corrections of aim. Two relieving aircraft also had engine trouble and failed to arrive. In the first hour of the bombardment, the German response was limited to anti-aircraft fire and attempts to jam the wireless of the artillery-observation aircraft. When the Pups from 4 (Naval) Squadron arrived, twice their number of German Albatros fighters engaged them and some of the aircraft from over the fleet, which joined in the dogfight. The British claimed five German aircraft shot down and the fleet was able to complete the bombardment. A third patrol later shot down a German seaplane into Ostend harbour and lost one fighter. At the ships weighed anchor, just as the Kaiser Wilhelm battery opened fire. Two seaplanes which attempted to approach the fleet were driven off by fighter seaplanes, which escorted the fleet home. Bacon returned with the impression that the bombardment had succeeded, but aerial photographs taken the following week revealed that about fifteen shells had landed within a few yards of the lock gates on the western side and four shells had fallen as close on the eastern side. The basin north of the locks had been hit and some damage caused to the docks but Zeebrugge remained open to German destroyers and U-boats. The Admiralty concluded that had the monitors been ready to fire as soon as the observer in the artillery-observation aircraft signalled, or if the shoot had been reported throughout, the lock gates would have been hit. Bacon made preparations to bombard Ostend harbour. Ostend bombardment, 5 June 1917 Attempts to bombard Ostend on 26 and 27 May were abandoned because of poor weather but on 4 June, the bombardment ships sailed for the Ratel Bank off Ostend; the bombardment force was smaller and the covering force larger than for the Zeebrugge operation, since surprise was less likely. The Harwich Force provided four light cruisers, a flotilla leader and eight destroyers as a covering force off the Thornton Bank and a second wave of four light cruisers and eight destroyers to guard against an attack from the Schouwen Bank. The firing buoy and its bearing and range from the target were established using the Zeebrugge method and the escorting ships formed a square around the bombardment ships. German destroyers were sighted east of the Ratel Bank at by and which were steering towards Ostend, to establish the range and bearing of the target from the sighting buoy. The German destroyers frustrated two attempts to enter the harbour, which left the fleet without sighting data and reliant on dead reckoning. At about gunfire was heard from the direction of the covering force to the north and at about the bombardment force Motor Launches began to lay a smokescreen. At dawn the coast became visible and Bacon corrected the position by a bearing on Sint-Petrus-en-Pauluskerk. The bombardment commenced at German coastal guns replied within minutes and fired accurately at Erebus and Terror but with no effect. The British bombardment ceased at the fleet weighed anchor at and withdrew northwards. The covering force guarded the ships from a point distant, having engaged two German destroyers as they tried to reach Zeebrugge, sinking . Ostend was a larger target than Zeebrugge and could be seen from the sea, which made accurate shooting easier. The dockyard was hit by twenty out of and intelligence reports noted the sinking of a lighter, a UC-boat, damage to three destroyers and that the German command had been made anxious about the security of the coast. Had Bacon been able to repeat the shore bombardments at short intervals, naval operations from the Flanders coast by the Germans would have been much more difficult to organise. More bombardments were planned but these were all postponed because essential conditions of tide and weather were not met. After several months, the bombardments resumed but the Germans had been able to repair the damage. As the long methodical bombardments of Ostend and Zeebrugge had proved impractical, Bacon attached a large monitor to the forces which patrolled coastal barrages, ready to exploit opportunities of favourable wind and weather to bombard Zeebrugge and Ostend, which occurred several times but had no effect on the working of the ports. Prelude =German defences= By 1917 the German defences on the Flanders coast included , a heavy artillery battery at Knokke, east of the Bruges Canal, of four guns, with a range of and the battery of four guns, with a range of , west of Ostend. Two more batteries were being built in early 1917 and between the main defences were many mobile guns, entrenchments and machine-gun nests. The only vulnerable part of the German defensive system was the lock gates at Zeebrugge, the destruction of which would make the canal to Bruges tidal and drastically reduce the number of ships and submarines that could pass along it. =British preparations= An appeal was made to the Grand Fleet for volunteers for special service on 23 February 1918. Very few of the participants were aware of the objective. The cruisers involved in the blockade, including , were equipped in Chatham by over for the special fitting out or (in the case of the ships to be sunk) stripping out of unnecessary equipment, including their masts. Iris, Daffodil and the submarines were converted in Portsmouth. The fleet made its rendezvous at Swin Deep, about south of Clacton. The first opportunity for the raid was early April 1918 and on 2 April the fleet sailed and Zeebrugge was bombed by 65 Squadron from Dunkirk. The success of the raid depended upon smokescreens to protect the British ships from the fire of German coastal artillery but the wind direction was unfavourable and the attack was called off. Zeebrugge was visible to the fleet and the fleet to the Germans in Zeebrugge; seventy-seven ships of all sizes, some with their lights already switched off, had to make a sharp turn to the west to return to their bases. Raid A second attempt was made on 23 April, in conjunction with a raid on the neighbouring harbour of Ostend. The raid began with a diversion against the mile-long Zeebrugge mole, led by the old cruiser, Vindictive, with two Mersey ferries, Daffodil and Iris II. The three ships were accompanied by two old submarines, which were filled with explosives to blow up the viaduct connecting the mole to the shore. Vindictive was to land a force of and a battalion of Royal Marines, at the entrance to the Bruges‚ÄìOstend Canal, to destroy German gun positions. During the landing the wind changed and the smokescreen to cover the ship was blown offshore. The marines immediately came under massed fire and suffered many casualties. Vindictive was spotted by German gunners and forced to land in the wrong place, resulting in the loss of the marines' heavy gun support. Eventually the submarine commanded by Lieutenant Richard Sandford, destroyed the viaduct when its demolition charge exploded. The attempt to sink three old cruisers to block the flow of traffic in and out of the Port of Bruges-Zeebrugge failed. The failure of the attack on the Zeebrugge mole resulted in the Germans concentrating their fire on the three blocking ships, , and , which were filled with concrete. Thetis did not make it to the canal entrance, after it hit an obstruction and was scuttled prematurely. The two other ships were sunk at the narrowest point of the canal. The submarines C1 (Lieutenant A. C. Newbold) and C3 were old, manned by volunteer crews of one other officer and four ratings. They had five tons of amatol packed into their fore-ends and were to be driven into the viaduct and then blown up, to prevent reinforcement of the German garrison on the mole. The crews were to abandon their submarines shortly before the collision with the viaduct, leaving the submarines to steer themselves automatically. During the passage from Dover, C1 parted with its tow and arrived too late to take part in the operation. Sandford elected to steer C3 into the viaduct manually instead of depending on the automatic system. Aftermath =Analysis= In 1931, the official historian, Sir Henry Newbolt, wrote that before the raid, two submarines entered or left the Flanders bases each day and continued at that rate during the week after the raid. The block ships were sunk in the wrong position and the canal was only obstructed for a few days. The Germans removed two piers in the western bank of the canal near the block ships and dredged a channel through the silt near their sterns. At high tide, U-boats could move along the new channel past the block ships. The average number of passages was maintained until June, when the rate fell to about one submarine per day, to an extent due to a bombardment of Zeebrugge on 9 June. After the damage was repaired, the rate of U-boat traffic did not return to the pre-raid level. Newbolt considered that the reduced traffic was caused by the recall of some U-boats to Germany in June, after reports that operations in the Dover Straits had become too dangerous. The usual remedy of increased destroyer raids was not possible, because of the difficulty in using Zeebrugge as a harbour. Newbolt wrote that the raid on Zeebrugge was part of an anti-submarine campaign which had lasted for five months, using patrols and minefields to close the straits and which continued despite the most destructive sortie achieved by the Germans during the war. The British anti-submarine measures inflicted a steady attrition on the Flanders U-boats and the attack on Zeebrugge came when the German blockade of Britain was supposed to have reduced drastically the resources and endurance of the British Empire. News of the raid was skilfully exploited to raise Allied morale and to foreshadow victory (\\"They can because they think they can\\"). Bacon wrote in 1931 that he was a seagoing commander with intimate knowledge of the tidal and navigational conditions in the Ostend and Zeebrugge areas; operational failures were due in part to the appointment of Keyes (an Admiralty man) and his changes to plans Bacon had laid. =Casualties= Of the involved in the operation, S. F. Wise recorded in 1981 that wounded and more than Kendall gave figures of and The destroyer, was sunk. Among the dead was Wing Commander Frank Brock, the man who devised and commanded the smoke screen. Most of the casualties were buried in England either because they died of their wounds en route or because the survivors recovered their bodies to repatriate them. The Zeebrugge plot of St James's Cemetery, Dover has nine unidentified men and fifty named men who died on 23 April 1918 but most fatalities were returned to their families for local burials. German casualties were eight dead and sixteen wounded. Victoria Cross The Zeebrugge Raid was promoted by Allied propaganda as a British victory and ultimately resulted in the awarding of eight Victoria Crosses. The 4th Battalion Royal Marines was awarded the Victoria Cross for the action. Under Rule 13 of the Victoria Cross warrant, a ballot was stipulated select the recipients. Victoria Cross rules specify that four Victoria Crosses should be awarded this way (one to an officer, one to an NCO and two to other ranks) they were not observed and only two Victoria Crosses were awarded. This was the last time that Victoria Crosses were awarded by ballot, although the rule remained within the Victoria Cross warrant. In a mark of respect to those involved in the raid the Royal Marines have never raised another 4th Battalion. A ballot was similarly held for the crews of the assault vessels for the Zeebrugge Mole (Vindictive, Royal Daffodil and Iris II) and the embarked raiding parties. Following the ballot, Victoria Crosses were awarded to Albert Edward McKenzie and Alfred Carpenter. Commemoration On 23 April 1964, some of the of the raid, families, the Mayor of Deal and a large Royal Marines honour guard held a service of commemoration for their fallen comrades at the Royal Marines barracks in Deal; a tree was planted near the officers' quarters in remembrance. A message from Winston Churchill to the ex-servicemen was read to those assembled and the event was reported in The Deal, Walmer and Sandwich Mercury newspaper on 23 and 30 April 1964. In Dover there are two memorials, the Zeebrugge Bell with memorial plaque in the Town Hall, given to Dover by the King of the Belgians in 1918 and the Zeebrugge Memorial in St James's Cemetery, where a regular memorial service is held.

Early life N. S. Berry was born on September 1, 1796, in Bath (in modern-day Maine, then a part of Massachusetts). His father died when Berry six years old, and after his mother's remarriage the family relocated to Bath, New Hampshire, where Berry attended the local schools. At age 16 Berry became an apprentice in a leather goods manufacturing factory, where he learned the tanning, currier and saddle making trades. Start of career After completing his apprenticeship at age 21, Berry relocated to Bristol, New Hampshire, where he purchased a tannery. In the 1820s and 1830s Berry was active in the New Hampshire Militia. He received a commission as a second lieutenant in the 34th Regiment, and advanced through the ranks to become regimental commander with the rank of colonel. Berry later relocated to Hebron, New Hampshire, where he continued to operate a successful leather goods business until it was destroyed in an 1857 fire. A Democrat, Berry served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1828, 1833, and 1834. He served in the New Hampshire State Senate in 1835 and 1836. Berry was also a delegate to the 1840 Democratic National Convention. Unhappy with the Democratic Party's support for slavery, and also interested in other reform movements including temperance, Berry became involved in the movement which led to the creation of the Free Soil Party. He ran unsuccessfully for Governor as a Free Soil Democratic candidate in every annual election from 1846 to 1850, enabling the election of Whig nominee Anthony Colby by splitting the Democratic vote in 1846. In some elections Berry's candidacy prevented the \\"regular\\" Democratic nominee from receiving the majority of the popular vote required by New Hampshire's constitution, and the state legislature had to choose the winner. Berry served as a Judge of the Grafton County Court of Common Pleas from June 1841 to June 1850. He was a Judge of Grafton County's Probate Court from 1856 to 1861. He became a Republican when the party was created in the mid-1850s. Governorship In March 1861 Berry was the successful Republican nominee for Governor. He was reelected in March 1862, and served from June 1861 to June 1863. Serving during the American Civil War, Berry was a strong supporter of the Union. During his governorship New Hampshire provided to the Union Army fifteen infantry regiments, three companies of sharpshooters, four companies of cavalry and one company of heavy artillery. In June 1862, Abraham Lincoln desired to issue a call for more recruits to join the Union Army, but hesitated because he wanted to demonstrate that the war effort still had popular support, following a perceived ebb in Union state morale as the result of several battlefield reverses. Berry was one of the organizers of an effort to send Lincoln a letter from the state governors to inform him that the states would respond positively if he issued a call for additional troops. Now able to demonstrate popular support for continuing the war effort, Lincoln requested the states to provide additional soldiers. Berry was also an active participant in the September 1862 War Governors' Conference. During this meeting Union state governors indicated their continued support for Lincoln's wartime policies, including the Emancipation Proclamation Lincoln indicated he intended to issue at an opportune moment. Later life Berry did not run for reelection in 1863. He resided first with his wife's family in Andover, Massachusetts, and later with his daughter in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He later returned to Hebron, where he lived until moving to Bristol in 1888 to reside with his son. Death and burial Berry died in Bristol on April 27, 1894, at age 97. He was buried at Homeland Cemetery in Bristol.

Design and development As a possible replacement for the pre-war Vickers Wellington medium bomber, Vickers had proposed a series of designs. The first, to meet the same specification as the Bristol Buckingham and Air Ministry Specification B.11/41, was for a high speed twin- engined medium bomber, with remote controlled turrets in engine nacelles and guns in the nose. This was considered to be neither fast enough to be a fast bomber nor well armed enough to be a normal medium bomber. A four-engined development of the same design was also drawn up. The official position was that the Wellington was becoming obsolete but as the Vickers factories were set up only for geodetic construction any design would need to be based on that method. Buttler, p116-117 Vickers were working on a Wellington with a pressurised cabin for high altitude work and the Ministry was interested in a pressurized version of the Warwick; this was supported by Lord Beaverbrook. The proposed design changed the twin-engined Warwick wing for an elliptical wing with four Merlin engines. The aircraft was expected to manage having delivered of bombs. The contract for two prototypes of the Warwick was covered by Specification B.5/41 and development and construction work proceeded until September 1942. In mid-1942, the Wellington replacement and B.5/41 were merged as a result of a new specification, B.3/42 for a Lancaster replacement but without high altitude performance. Vickers could take the work already done along and fit the four-engine wing to a new design of fuselage and a contract was raised for what would become the Windsor. The wings of the first prototypes were built to the earlier specification and so had lower weight limits imposed. The Windsor was designed to Air Ministry Specification B.5/41 (later modified to Spec. B.3/42) for a high-altitude heavy bomber with a pressurised crew compartment and an ability to fly at at .Andrews and Morgan 1988, pp. 387‚Äì388. Notable features of the Windsor included its pressurised crew compartment. To spread the load across the elliptical planform high aspect ratio wings, the undercarriage was of four mainwheel oleo struts - one in each engine nacelle - with a single balloon-tyred wheel on each. The defensive guns were mounted in barbettes at the rear of each outboard nacelle, which were to be remotely operated by a gunner in a pressurised compartment in the extreme tail. The Windsor used Wallis's geodetic body and wing structure that Vickers had previously used in the Wellesley, Wellington and Warwick bombers. The wing structure had no spars but a hollow geodetic tube from tip to tip, passing through the fuselage truss. To better resist the compression and tension efforts, the elements were assembled at 16 degrees next to the root, reverting to the more conventional ninety degrees on the tips, longitudinal elements locking everything in place. The thicknesses of the elements was also reduced towards the tips. No two joints had the same angle on the wing, an authentic production engineer's nightmare. Instead of doped Irish linen covering used on the earlier geodetic aircraft, a stiff and light skin was used on the Windsor. This was made from woven steel wires and very thin (1/1000 inch thickness) stainless steel ribbons, doped with PVC or other plastic, specially designed to avoid ballooning. To properly fit the skin to the frame, a tuning fork had to be used. The wing was designed so that the tips had a noticeable droop on the ground, but was straight in flight, so the skin had to be fitted tighter on top than on the bottom to be evenly tight in flight. Operational history Only three examples (the original plus successive prototypes known as Type 457 and Type 461) were built. This was due to refinements in the existing Lancaster bomber, rendering it suitable for the role for which the Windsor had been designed. The first prototype flew on 23 October 1943, the second on 15 February 1944, and the third on 11 July 1944. All three were built at Vickers' secret dispersed Foxwarren Experimental Department between Brooklands and nearby Cobham. The two latter prototypes were tested until the end of the Second World War, when further development and production were cancelled.

It is also used to treat osteoporosis, HIV/AIDS wasting syndrome, and to promote weight gain and muscle growth in certain situations. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of oxymetholone include increased sexual desire as well as symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, and voice changes. It can also cause liver damage. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has strong anabolic effects and weak androgenic effects. Oxymetholone was first described in 1959 and was introduced for medical use by 1961. It is used mostly in the United States. In addition to its medical use, oxymetholone is used to improve physique and performance. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non- medical use is generally illicit. Medical uses The primary clinical applications of oxymetholone include treatment of anemia and osteoporosis, as well as stimulating muscle growth in malnourished or underdeveloped patients. However, in the United States, the only remaining -approved indication is the treatment of anemia. Following the introduction of oxymetholone, nonsteroidal drugs such as epoetin alfa were developed and shown to be more effective as a treatment for anemia and osteoporosis without the side effects of oxymetholone. The drug remained available despite this and eventually found a new use in treating HIV/AIDS wasting syndrome. Presented most commonly as a 50 mg tablet, oxymetholone has been said to be one of the \\"strongest\\" and \\"most powerful\\" AAS available for medical use. Similarly, there is a risk of side effects. Oxymetholone is highly effective in promoting extensive gains in body mass, mostly by greatly improving protein synthesis. For this reason, it is often used by bodybuilders and athletes. Non-medical uses Oxymetholone is used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters. Side effects The common side effects of oxymetholone include depression, lethargy, headache, swelling, rapid weight gain, priapism, changes in skin color, urination problems, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain (if taken on an empty stomach), loss of appetite, jaundice, breast swelling in men, feeling restless or excited, insomnia, and diarrhea. In women, side effects also include acne, changes in menstrual periods, voice deepening, hair growth on the chin or chest, pattern hair loss, enlarged clitoris, and changes in libido. Because of its 17Œ±-alkylated structure, oxymetholone is hepatotoxic. Long term use of the drug can cause a variety of serious ailments, including hepatitis, liver cancer, and cirrhosis; therefore periodic liver function tests are recommended for those taking oxymetholone. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Like other AAS, oxymetholone is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). It is not a substrate for 5Œ±-reductase (as it is already 5Œ±-reduced) and is a poor substrate for 3Œ±-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3Œ±-HSD), and therefore shows a high ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity. As a DHT derivative, oxymetholone is not a substrate for aromatase and hence cannot be aromatized into estrogenic metabolites. However, uniquely among DHT derivatives, oxymetholone is nonetheless associated with relatively high estrogenicity, and is known to have the potential to produce estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia (rarely) and water retention. It has been suggested that this may be due to direct binding to and activation of the estrogen receptor by oxymetholone. Oxymetholone does not possess any significant progestogenic activity. =Pharmacokinetics= There is limited information available on the pharmacokinetics of oxymetholone. It appears to be well-absorbed with oral administration. Oxymetholone has very low affinity for human serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), less than 5% of that of testosterone and less than 1% of that of DHT. The drug is metabolized in the liver by oxidation at the C2 position, reduction at the C3 position, hydroxylation at the C17 position, and conjugation. The C2 hydroxymethylene group of oxymetholone can be cleaved to form mestanolone (17Œ±-methyl-DHT), which may contribute to the effects of oxymetholone. The elimination half-life of oxymetholone is unknown. Oxymetholone and its metabolites are eliminated in the urine. Chemistry Oxymetholone, also known as 2-hydroxymethylene-17Œ±-methyl-4,5Œ±-dihydrotestosterone (2-hydroxymethylene-17Œ±-methyl-DHT) or as 2-hydroxymethylene-17Œ±-methyl-5Œ±-androstan-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a 17Œ±-alkylated derivative of DHT. History Oxymetholone was first described in a 1959 paper by scientists from Syntex. It was introduced for medical use by Syntex and Imperial Chemical Industries in the United Kingdom under the brand name Anapolon by 1961. Oxymetholone was also introduced under the brand names Adroyd (Parke-Davis) by 1961 and Anadrol (Syntex) by 1962. The drug was marketed in the United States in the early 1960s. Society and culture =Generic names= Oxymetholone is the generic name of the drug and its , , , , and , while oxym√©tholone is its . =Brand names= Oxymetholone has been marketed under a variety of brand names including Anadrol, Anadroyd, Anapolon, Anasterona, Anasteronal, Anasterone, Androlic, Androyd, Hemogenin, Nastenon, Oxitoland, Oxitosona, Oxyanabolic, Oxybolone, Protanabol, Roboral, Synasterobe, Synasteron, and Zenalosyn. =Availability= United States Oxymetholone is one of the few AAS that remains available for medical use in the United States. The others (as of November 2017) are testosterone, testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone undecanoate, methyltestosterone, fluoxymesterone, nandrolone, and oxandrolone. Other countries The availability of oxymetholone is fairly limited and seems to be scattered into isolated markets in Europe, Asia, and North and South America. It is known to be available in Turkey, Greece, Moldova, Iran, Thailand, Brazil, and Paraguay. At least historically, it has also been available in Canada, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland, Israel, Hong Kong, and India. =Legal status= Oxymetholone, along with other AAS, is a schedule III controlled substance in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act.

The company was founded in 1996 and has manufacturing facilities in Tahiti, Japan, China, Germany, and Utah. Morinda, formerly known as Tahitian Noni International and Morinda Bioactives, was a subsidiary of Morinda Holdings, Inc. prior to merging with and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of New Age Beverages Corporation in December 2019. Products Morinda's main product is a noni juice blend sold under the brand name Tahitian Noni. The company also markets various dietary supplements, personal care products, and essential oils. Tahitian Noni juice consists of a blend of pasteurized reconstituted noni puree (89%) mixed with grape and blueberry juice concentrates (11%), which is pasteurized prior to bottling. The manufacturer's recommended serving size is 30 mL/day (1 ounce). According to the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food, the nutritional content (i.e., macronutrients, vitamins and minerals) of Tahitian Noni juice is comparable to the ranges known for typical fruit juices, and the agency concluded that there was no evidence that the juice had any special health benefits beyond those of other fruit juices. The nutritional content of noni juice is roughly comparable to that of apple juice. Controversy =Attorneys General (AZ, CA, NJ, TX) vs. Morinda Holdings, Inc.= On August 26, 1998, the Attorneys General of Arizona, California, New Jersey, and Texas announced a multi-state settlement with Morinda, Inc., the charges stating that Morinda had made \\"unsubstantiated claims in consumer testimonials and other promotional material that its Tahitian Noni juice could treat, cure or prevent numerous diseases, including diabetes, clinical depression, hemorrhoids and arthritis.\\" Such claims rendered the beverage an unapproved new drug under state and federal food and drug laws and should not have been sold until it received approval. Under the terms of the agreement, Morinda agreed to: *No longer make drug claims, or claims that the product can cure, treat, or prevent any disease until \\"Tahitian Noni\\" is approved and cleared for those uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. *Not make any other claims, whether health claims or others, regarding the benefits of Tahitian Noni unless such claims are true and the company can substantiate the claim by reliable scientific evidence. *Not use testimonials which imply that the advertised claimed results are the typical or ordinary experience of consumers in actual conditions of use, unless Morinda possesses and relies upon adequate substantiation that the results are typical or ordinary. The settlement also called for Morinda to pay $100,000 for investigative costs and to provide a refund for the full purchase price to any consumer who submitted a written refund request. =Tahitian Noni & XanGo settlement= Tahitian Noni sued XanGo and several of its top executives in February 2003 in 4th District Court in Provo, Utah, alleging that executives stole Tahitian Noni's concept for a mangosteen-based supplement while they were employed by TNI's parent-company, to which XanGo counter-sued. In a joint statement, Tahitian Noni and XanGo did not disclose particulars regarding the settlement, only stating that they have \\"agreed to resolve their disputes and the litigation between them and their founders.\\" =Possible contamination in Spain= Residents of Spain were alerted in February 2007 to avoid consuming certain improperly labeled bottles of Tahitian Noni Juice while the health department there awaited toxicology reports for a man who died after drinking the juice. According to reports in Spain, a 40-year-old man from Ogijares drank some noni juice for breakfast and began to experience strange sensations in his mouth and blurred vision. He died shortly thereafter, and another family member, who also drank some juice, reported similar symptoms. Reports stated that there were large amounts of cocaine found in the bottles and the body of the deceased man. The bottles recovered from the deceased man's home were submitted to the Spanish Institute of Toxicology, where it was confirmed the bottles were contaminated with cocaine. The bottles in question bore labels from Mexico, and the lot number and expiration dates were illegible. Spanish authorities urged consumers to check the labels on their bottles of juice and report any irregularities. Consumers were also asked not to purchase bottles of juice outside the company's normal distribution channels. =Hepatotoxicity= Following several medical case reports of hepatotoxicity among consumers of noni juice, a 2009 study on Tahitian Noni by the European Food Safety Authority advised that data available at the time of the case reports were not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between consumption of the juice and hepatotoxicity; however, an increasing number of subsequent case reports suggested that some individuals may be particularly sensitive to hepatotoxic effects of noni fruit products.

He worked as a prosecutor in several important cases, including murder of Georgiy Gongadze and investigation of United Energy Systems of Ukraine. Political career On March 2006 he was elected as a people's deputy of the Verkhovna Rada from Party of Regions list as ‚Ññ96 - but he was not a party member. Piskun was elected in parliament for Party of Regions again in 2007. He became a full member of Party of Regions in October 2008.

In the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election Khoroshkovskyi tried to return to national politics this time from the party of Strong Ukraine (placing 16th on the parties election list). But in the election the party failed to clear the 5% election threshold (it got 3.11% of the votes) and thus Piskun was not elected into parliament. Piskun was only allowed to take part in the election after a court decision validated his entrance in the election, at first the Central Election Commission of Ukraine had refused to register him because in the last 5 years leading up to the election he had not lived in Ukraine. Dismissals as Prosecutor General of Ukraine According to Piskun, his dismissal by President Yushchenko in October 2005 came because he stopped criminal proceedings against Yulia Tymoshenko and refused to drop proceedings against Petro Poroshenko. He was criticized for closing the criminal case related to the United Energy Systems of Ukraine while serving under Viktor Yushchenko's government in 2005. and dropping criminal cases regarding back-then Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.

Members were encouraged instead to join the Labour Party (though they were subsequently expelled). The influx of communists (both from Jim Larkins party and the Communist Party of Ireland) to the Labour party and union movement cause a split in Labour with the formation of National Labour. During the time the communists still ran a revolutionary book shop New Books and produced a publication Irish Review.

He also served on the town council and was mayor of Rimouski. In 1869, he married Aim√©e Plamondon. Fiset was elected five times as the Liberal Member of Parliament representing the Quebec electoral district of Rimouski in the House of Commons of Canada. He was first elected in the Canadian federal election of 1872, and was re-elected in 1874 and 1878. Although he was defeated in 1882, he regained his seat in 1887. This pattern repeated when he lost once again in 1891, but regained his seat a final time in 1896. A notable moment in his career in the house took place on 30 March 1874 when Fiset guided a hooded Louis Riel into the parliament buildings so that he might sign the parliamentary registry and thereby become an official Member of Parliament. Despite having been elected to parliament as the member for Provencher, Riel at that time was a fugitive because of his role in execution of Thomas Scott during the Red River Rebellion of 1869-1870.

It was a project by Austro-Canadian industrialist Frank Stronach to build an experimental model community for people displaced by Hurricane Katrina. Canadaville occupied 3.69 square kilometres (912 acres) of land near the Atchafalaya River and opened in early December 2005. Rather than simply providing temporary shelter to the evacuees, Stronach intended Canadaville to help its residents integrate into a long-term holistic farming community that would raise livestock and seafood to be served at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, Florida. The community was technically called Magnaville but the community members themselves decided that they preferred to be known as Canadaville. The 75 mobile housing units are 1420 square feet (132 square meters) in size, and have three bedrooms and two bathrooms, air conditioning, washers, dryers, and other amenities. As former Canadian MP Dennis Mills described it, \\"this is no FEMA Village\\". Residents, which numbered over 200 by August 2006, Katrina's first anniversary, were able to stay rent-free for five years, with the requirement that (if able-bodied) they contribute to the community by learning new skills or using their existing skills. Since many of the Katrina evacuees were extremely poor and generally not well-educated, Canadaville's backers hoped that the Canadaville experience would help the evacuees gain self-reliance that they didn't have before.

Such covers are named after Jean Leray. Sheaf cohomology measures the extent to which a locally exact sequence on a fixed topological space, for instance the de Rham sequence, fails to be globally exact. Its definition, using derived functors, is reasonably natural, if technical. Moreover, important properties, such as the existence of a long exact sequence in cohomology corresponding to any short exact sequence of sheaves, follow directly from the definition. However, it is virtually impossible to calculate from the definition. On the other hand, ƒåech cohomology with respect to an open cover is well-suited to calculation, but of limited usefulness because it depends on the open cover chosen, not only on the sheaves and the space. By taking a direct limit of ƒåech cohomology over arbitrarily fine covers, we obtain a ƒåech cohomology theory that does not depend on the open cover chosen. In reasonable circumstances (for instance, if the topological space is paracompact), the derived-functor cohomology agrees with this ƒåech cohomology obtained by direct limits. However, like the derived functor cohomology, this cover-independent ƒåech cohomology is virtually impossible to calculate from the definition. The Leray condition on an open cover ensures that the cover in question is already \\"fine enough.\\" The derived functor cohomology agrees with the ƒåech cohomology with respect to any Leray cover. Let mathfrak{U} = {U_i} be an open cover of the topological space X, and mathcal{F} a sheaf on X. We say that mathfrak{U} is a Leray cover with respect to mathcal{F} if, for every nonempty finite set {i_1, ldots, i_n} of indices, and for all k > 0, we have that H^k(U_{i_1} cap cdots cap U_{i_n}, mathcal{F}) = 0, in the derived functor cohomology.Taylor, Joseph L. Several complex variables with connections to algebraic geometry and Lie groups. Graduate Studies in Mathematics v. 46. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI. 2002.

After capturing Busan and Dongnae, the Japanese army under Konishi Yukinaga advanced at a rapid rate of almost 20 kilometer per day towards the Joseon capital of Hanseong (present-day Seoul) . Background Joseon General Yi Il arrived at Sangju on 2 June with only a force of 60 cavalrymen. On receiving his formal assignment to block the Japanese advance from Busan towards Hanseomg while he was still in Gyeongsang Province, he found that his company of 300 supposedly first-rate troops consisted largely of untrained students and clerks conscripted out of government offices to replace men whose names were on the military lists, but who were either missing, already deceased, or claiming exemption due to illness. Rather than attempting to march this untrained force into battle, he took only his veterans, and hoped to recruit forces from the local garrison. On arriving in Sangju, he found that the garrison was completely depleted, as all of the soldiers had been called away to defend the provincial capital of Daegu to the south. With no soldiers, Yi decided to use grain from the government warehouses to recruit local peasants, and managed to gather a force of 900 men. These men were untrained and were little more than a mob, and Yi thought that he might have perhaps a week to train them. however, the Japanese army under Konishi Yukinaga arrived the following day. Battle When one of Yi's peasant conscripts brought word that the Japanese advance contingent had been spotted, Yi refused to believe it and had the man beheaded for spreading rumors. He felt that it was impossible that the Japanese could have advanced from Busan to Sangju in only ten days. However, the report was soon verified, and Yi deployed his force on a hill behind Sangju. Konishi divided his army into two groups. The first, led by Konishi and Matsura Shigenobu took the town of Sangju without a fight. The second, consisting of 6700 men led by S≈ç Yoshitoshi, ≈åmura Yoshiaki, and Got≈ç Mototsugu, headed directly to confront Yi. They approached through a forest, observed but out of range of Yi's archers. The archers failed to send warning to Yi, fearing the same fate as the man who had just been beheaded, and Yi was unaware of the Japanese approach until the vanguard emerged from the forest and shot down a scout less than a 100 meters from his position. The Japanese army then fanned out in three groups and rushed the Koreans. At 50 meters Yi's untrained forces broke and were cut down. Aftermath Yi managed to escape north, discarding his armor and his horse in the process. He continued through the strategic Choryong Pass, which could have been held to good effect against the Japanese, and joined his superior, General Sin Rip at Chungju. The Japanese army continued its advance towards Chungju.

Early life and education Walker was the only surviving son of civil servant Reginald Plumer Walker and his wife, Gladys. He born at Bungsai Hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where his parents were married in 1929. The Walkers had once owned considerable lands in northern Nottinghamshire around Mattersey and Lound, but, according to his research, lost it all \\"thanks to a combination of incompetence and the agricultural slump\\" at the end of the 19th century. His paternal grandfather, Plumer Cosby Walker, worked for the Great Northern Railway. After three years in Malaysia, the family moved to Nairobi, Kenya, where his father was chief accountant of East African Railways. At age 13, Walker left Kenya to be educated at The King's School, Canterbury, followed by Trinity College, Oxford. Career Walker joined MI5 from the Ugandan Colonial Service in 1963.The Defence of the Realm, by Christopher Andrew, Page 560, Published by Allen Lane, 2009, Walker worked extensively in counter-terrorism. At the behest of Sir Maurice Oldfield (MI5) and incoming RUC Chief Constable John Hermon, in January 1980 he was asked to review the practices and organisation of intelligence gathering by the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland.P.J.

Recommendations from the report were implemented via a memo issued in February 1981.The Walker Report (RUC memo), 23 February 1981. via Pat Finucane Centre website. Retrieved 20 January 2019. The report established primacy of RUC Special Branch over all areas of intelligence gathering, and the Branch would also absorb weapons and firearms analysis. All intelligence contacts were to be offered to Special Branch, and all proposed arrests were to be cleared with the Branch. As a \\"basic rule\\" Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officers were not to discuss a Special Branch operation or investigation with other members of CID without express permission from the Branch. It is claimed by critics that the Walker Report cemented the position of RUC Special Branch as a force within a force, beyond normal checks and balances; established a policy of primacy of intelligence requirements over criminal investigation; led to a perception of informants as an untouchable \\"protected species\\"; and to an acceptance of cover-up and fabrication of evidence, such as that revealed after the so-called \\"shoot-to- kill\\" killings by police in 1982, that formed the subject of the Stalker inquiry.Policing the Police, Insight, Ulster TV, 1 May 2001; transcript via Relatives for JusticeRichard Norton-Taylor and Nick Hopkins, Security service told RUC that it could put spying on terrorists ahead of solving crime, The Guardian, 14 June 2001Ian Cobain, Northern Ireland: when Britain fought terror with terror, The Guardian, 9 July 2015Alan Simpson, How Special Branch betrayed the police, The Belfast Telegraph, 5 July 2016Ian Cobain and Owen Bowcott, RUC told to put intelligence before arrests, reveals secret MI5 report, The Guardian, 26 June 2018 The implementing memo became known in 2001; the underlying report itself was declassified in June 2018.

He was confirmed as a member of the Church of England by Ven. Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury, at 16 years old while attending school. He would convert to Roman Catholicism two years after marrying his wife, Susan Hastings, in April 1955, making him the first Roman Catholic to serve as DG of MI5. They had three children and nine grandchildren. In 2009, Walker wrote an autobiography of his days in Africa, Towards Independence in Africa: A District Officer in Uganda at the End of Empire.

Telephone counseling ranges from individual, couple or group psychotherapy with a professional therapist to psychological first aid provided by para-professional counselors. In-person therapists often advise clients to make use of telephone crisis counseling to provide the client with an avenue to obtain support outside of therapy if they cannot be reached in an emergency or at the conclusion of a therapeutic relationship. Telephone counseling is also provided by crisis hotlines, quitlines, and child helplines. Professional counseling by telephone Researchers have begun observing a growing trend in which licensed psychotherapists and psychologists are now seeing at least some of their clients via the telephone.Barnett, J.; Scheetz, K. (2003). Technological advances and telehealth: Ethics, law, and the practice of psychotherapy. Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training. 40(1-2), 86-93 A body of research exists comparing the efficacy of telephone counseling to in-person counseling and to no treatment. A recent study found that more than half of clients (58%) who had experienced both in- person and phone counseling preferred phone counseling.Reese, R., Conoley, C., Brossart, D. (2006) The Attractiveness of Telephone Counseling: An Empirical Investigation of Client Perceptions. Journal of Counseling & Development. 84:1, 54-60. A 2002 study found that phone counseling clients rate their counseling relationship similarly to in-person clients.Reese, R; Conoley, C.; Brossart, D.(2002). Effectiveness of Telephone Counseling: A Field-Based Investigation. Journal of Counseling Psychology, 49:2, 233-242 Phone counseling has been established as an effective treatment for diagnoses ranging from depressionLynch DJ, Tamburrino MB, Nagel R. (1997). Telephone counseling for patients with minor depression: preliminary findings in a family practice setting. J Fam Pract. 44(3):293-8. to agoraphobia.Tutty S, Simon G, Ludman E. (2000). Telephone counseling as an adjunct to antidepressant treatment in the primary care system. A pilot study. Eff Clin Pract. 3(4):191-3. Crisis hotlines Crisis hotlines, also known as helplines, provide telephone support services which often serve the primary function of suicide prevention. However, many of these helplines also accept calls from people who are not in active suicidal crisis, and the term \\"emotional support helpline\\" is sometimes used to avoid the implication that a caller must be in crisis to use these services. Some emotional support services employ email and messaging technologies. Crisis hotlines may be state-funded or provided by churches or charities. Quitlines Quitlines are helplines that offer advanced treatment for addiction and behavior change. Quitlines should not be confused with centralized call centers offering advice in a wide spectrum of fields for the purpose of receiving and transmitting a large volume of requests. Child helplines Child helplines are help and support services for children, run by civil society organizations and or government bodies. Child helplines specialize in offering information, support, advice or counseling to people 18 years of age or younger. Child Helpline International, an international network of child helplines, was formed in 2003 to support the development of child helplines and enable the information gathered by child helplines around the world on children's rights and welfare issues to be assembled for advocacy purposes.  Advantages over in-person therapy  Unlike other forms of counseling, telephone counseling is potentially free of certain constraining factors that affect traditional therapy, including geography, time, duration, and cost, making this form of counseling more accessible for a number of people who would be unable to attend traditional psychotherapy. It also provides a degree of anonymity that is comforting to some callers, reducing the intimidation that some people may feel at the prospect of seeking treatment with a traditional in-person therapist and encouraging disclosure. Also research shows telephone counseling to have better results among patients with depression.Gregory E. Simon et al, \\"Telephone Psychotherapy and Telephone Care Management for Primary Care Patients Starting Antidepressant Treatment\\", Journal of American Medical Association, August 25, 2004, Vol 292, No. 8 Disadvantages over in-person therapy Being physically present with your counselor may help you feel more connected with him or her; the telephone may contribute to \\"distance\\" in the therapeutic relationship. Some people feel safer letting themselves become emotional in the physical presence of another person. Because the client often calls from a location that is part of their day-to-day life, calls often center around, or are interrupted by, situational pressures that the person is currently immersed in. This can have both positive and negative effects on the counseling provided; by allowing the counselor some insight into the person's situation, the counselor can be more objective. Conversely, the disruptions and pressures of situational factors may make it difficult for the client to adopt a reflective state or maintain full focus on the counseling session. In the case of para-professional counseling (meaning a non-licensed therapist), there may not be guaranteed privacy; the electronic technologies involved make it difficult to prevent multiple phone connections, loudspeakers, or recording of the interactions. This fact may present a problem to a paranoid personality who suspects that others are monitoring his or her calls. If the counseling is provided by an organization staffed by a number of employees or volunteers, a repeat caller cannot develop a relationship with a counselor in the same way as in traditional therapy, which may impede progress. These organizations typically limit calls in time and frequency, preventing deeper analysis and thus the use of therapeutic modalities that depend on it (i.e. psychoanalysis). Phone counseling is not appropriate for people who are homicidal, suicidal, self injuring, or requiring more care than one session per week. Phone counselors may not be acquainted with local emergency service options. Counselors at locally operated suicide hotlines are trained in emergency services and acquainted with local resources.

It is the northernmost peninsula in South America and has an area of extending from the Manaure Bay (Colombia) to the Calabozo Ensenada in the Gulf of Venezuela (Venezuela), and from the Caribbean to the Serran√≠a del Perij√° mountains range. It was the subject of a historic dispute between Venezuela and Colombia in 1891, and on arbitration was awarded to the latter and joined to its Magdalena Department. Nowadays, most of the territory is part of Colombia, making it part of La Guajira Department. The remaining strip is part of the Venezuelan Zulia State. The northernmost part of the peninsula is called Punta Gallinas (12¬∞ 28¬¥ N) and is also considered the northernmost part of mainland South America.USGS: Caribbean Coast: Guajira Peninsula coast USGS Accessed 24 August 2007.  Climate  The scenery of Guajira is very picturesque, with wide desert plains and green, foggy mountains. The daytime temperature in the plains is very high, but it is more temperate in the mountains. The region receives the flow of the trade winds from the northern hemisphere. The northeastern coast of Venezuela and the Antilles have Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub. The trade winds cause a resurgence of the deep littoral waters and make the sea more rich in living species on the western side of the peninsula. The northeastern flank of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range acts as a barrier that generates abundant rainfall in its steppes, forming the headwaters of the Rancher√≠a River, the only major river in the area. Climate and vegetation varies from south to north, presenting hyper-humid jungle weather in the southern part (with 3000 mm of rainfall a year) to the desertic areas in the north (300 mm a year). In the northern area, a small range of mountains known as the Macuira reaches 900 m above sea level; they trap some of the trade winds and mist forms. Most of the mountain range is a protected area called National Natural Park of Macuira. Nearby there is also the 80 km¬≤ Flamingos Fauna and Flora Sanctuary. Economy Jep√≠rachi wind farm in the Guajira Peninsula. The peninsula is inhabited mainly by members of the native tribe of the Wayuu, who use the plains to raise cattle, sheep, goats and horses. The descendants of Spanish colonists settled in the southeastern part of the peninsula (sometimes referred to as the Padilla Province). This has more fertile land, due to the proximity to other river basins, such as the Cesar river basin. It has been developed for large plantations of cotton and sorghum, and for cattle ranching. Since the 1980s the central area of the peninsula was subject to the exploration and exploitation of coal and natural gas in the area of Cerrej√≥n and of oil in the littoral. A popular ecotourism destination in the area is Cabo de la Vela, a headland and village on the peninsula on the Colombia side.  Missionary history  The mission of Goajira was carried out since the 1880s by Capuchin friars. It was elevated by Pope Pius X on 17 January 1905, into a vicariate Apostolic, dependent on the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. Mgr Attanasio Maria Vincenzo Soler-Royo, O.F.M. Cap., was appointed to the vicariate, as titular Bishop of Citharizum, on 18 April 1907. The early 20th-century missionaries described the inhabitants of the area as > \\"tall and well made. Formerly they were very intractable, but the Capuchins, > who were in charge of the Catholic missions, have had a great influence over > them, and large numbers have been converted. The chief towns are > Paraguaipoa, Calabacito, Maricha, Marocaso and Soldado.\\" The Capuchins established three major orphanages, where they educated Wayuu children in Catholicism, Spanish, and European culture. In the 21st century, the government no longer requires Catholic education for the indigenous peoples. They are allowed to educate their children in the Wayuu traditions and language (Wayuunaiki. In the novel Papillon (1970), Henri Charri√®re writes: > \\"The Goajira Indians are seafarers who fish for pearls. Their primary diet > is said to consist of fish, turtle meat, turtle eggs and big green lizards, > most likely Iguanas. Men and women are dressed only in a loincloth which > covers their crotch.\\" The women wear dresses of woven cotton; and the men often wear shirts and pants to protect their legs from desert winds and plants.

The Sempill Mission was a British aeronaval technical mission led by Captain the Master of SempillDaily Telegraph, 06 Jan 2002, \\"The Highland peer who prepared Japan for war\\" and sent to Japan in September 1921, with the objective of helping the Imperial Japanese Navy develop its aeronaval forces. The mission consisted of a group of 30 instructors and support staff,Cheesman, Frank Prelude to Pearl Harbour article in Aircraft Annual 1964 UK Ian Allan 1963 pp. 24-29. the mission was headed by Colonel Sempill, and stayed in Japan for 18 months. Background The Imperial Japanese Navy had closely monitored the progress of aviation of the three Allied naval powers during World War I and concluded that Britain had made the greatest advances in naval aviation, they had also learned a good deal about naval aviation through their contacts within the Royal Navy. In 1920, a representative had also been sent to Britain to observe air operations off the decks of . In 1921, the Japanese government formally requested that the British dispatch a naval air mission, in order to develop and to provide a professional edge to Japanese naval aviation. There were reservations on the part of the Admiralty about granting the Japanese unrestricted access to British technology, yet after refusing the Japanese a total of ten times, the British government relented and sent an unofficial civil aviation mission to Japan. Arrival of the mission The Sempill Mission was led by Captain William Forbes-Sempill, a former officer in the Royal Air Force experienced in the design and testing of Royal Navy aircraft during World War I. The mission consisted of 30 members, who were largely personnel with experience in naval aviation and included pilots and engineers from several British aircraft manufacturing firms. The British technical mission left for Japan in September with the objective of helping the Imperial Japanese Navy develop and improve the proficiency of its naval air arm, the British government also hoped it would lead to lucrative an arms deal. The mission arrived at Kasumigaura Naval Air Station the following month, in November 1921, and stayed in Japan for 18 months. Although civilians, the Japanese granted active commissions to all members of the mission and a suitable uniform was provided. Sempill was given the rank of a naval captain by the Japanese while other members of the team were given lesser ranks. The Japanese were trained on several new British aircraft such as the Gloster Sparrowhawk; as the mission also brought to Kasumigaura, well over a hundred aircraft comprising twenty different models, five of which were then currently in service with the Royal Air Force, including the Sparrowhawk. These planes eventually provided the inspiration for the design of a number of Japanese naval aircraft. Technicians become familiar with the newest aerial weapons and equipment-torpedoes, bombs, machine guns, cameras, and communications gear. While naval aviators were trained in various techniques such as torpedo bombing, flight control and carrier landing and take-offs; skills that would later be employed in the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The mission also brought the plans of the most recent British aircraft carriers, such as and , which influenced the final stages of the development of the carrier H≈çsh≈ç. Although H≈çsh≈ç was already launched by that time, she became the first aircraft carrier laid down as such in the world when she was commissioned in 1922, one year before Hermes. Impact By the time the last members of the mission had returned to Britain, the Japanese had acquired a reasonable grasp of the latest aviation technology and the Sempill mission of 1921‚Äì1922, marked the true beginning of an effective Japanese naval air force. Japanese naval aviation also, both in technology and in doctrine, continued to be dependent on the British model for most of the 1920s. The Imperial Japanese Navy were also aided in their quest to build up their naval forces by Sempill himself, who had later become a Japanese spy. Over the next 20 years, the British Peer provided the Japanese with secret information on the latest British aviation technology. His espionage work helped Japan rapidly develop its military aircraft and its technologies before the Second World War.

It was founded in 1851 following the Synod of Thurles in 1850, and in response to the Queen's University of Ireland and its associated colleges which were nondenominational; Cardinal Cullen had previously forbidden Catholics from attending these \\"godless colleges\\".Johnston, Roy 1993. Causeway, the Belfast 'Cultural Traditions' quarterly, Vol 1 no 1, September 1993 \\"The Practical Arts in Irish Culture\\" . Retrieved on 1 September 2006. Establishment After the Catholic Emancipation period of Irish history, the Archbishop of Armagh attempted to provide for the first time in Ireland higher-level education both accessible to followers of the Catholic Church and taught by such people. The Catholic Hierarchy demanded a Catholic alternative to the University of Dublin / Trinity College, whose Anglican origins the Hierarchy refused to overlook. The Hierarchy also wanted to counteract the \\"Godless Colleges\\" of the Queen's University of Ireland ‚Äì established in the cities of Galway, Belfast and Cork. The University of Dublin had since the 1780s admitted Catholics to study; a religious test, however, hindered the efforts of Catholics in their desire to obtain membership of the University's governing bodies. Thus, in 1850 at the Synod of Thurles, it was decided to open in Dublin ‚Äì especially for Catholics ‚Äì a new institution. The Synod findings were supported by Pope Pius IX and the Holy See gave approval in 1852, and then issued a papal encyclical on 20 March 1854 supporting the establishment of the University.Universities - vii-Ireland www.catholic.com On 18 May 1854 the Catholic University of Ireland was formally established, with five faculties - of law, letters, medicine, philosophy and theology - with John Henry Newman (later Cardinal) as the Rector. Lectures commenced on 3 November 1854, with the registration of seventeen students, the first being Daniel O'Connell, grandson of the notable Catholic politician Daniel O'Connell. In 1856 the University Church opened. As a private body, the Catholic University was never given a royal charter, and so was unable to award recognised degrees, and suffered from chronic financial difficulties. Newman left the university in 1857, after which the school went into a serious decline. Bartholomew Woodlock was appointed Rector in 1860 and served until he became Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise in 1879. In 1861, Dr Woodlock tried to secure land for a building near Holy Cross College Clonliffe, the establishment to be known as St. Patrick's University. Plans were drawn up by an architect, J.J. McCarthy, and a foundation stone laid.A proposal for a Roman Catholic University of Ireland in Clonliffe www.archseek.com Cardinal Cullen was against the idea of educating lay and clerical students on the same premises. However this plan was shelved because of the expansion of the railway line,UCD Timeline and a church and monastery was built on the site. Under the name St. Patrick's University night classes were advertised by the University, under Dr. Woodlock's name Some feeder secondary schools were established for the CUI. The nearby Catholic University School was joined by St. Flannan's College in Co. Clare and Catholic University High School in Waterford. In 1863 the CUI awarded its first Doctorate of Divinity to James Vincent Cleary (Professor in St. John's College, Waterford, and future Bishop of Kingston, Canada), using its papal charter to award theological degrees.James Vincent Cleary Dictionary of Canadian Biography In 1880, the Royal University of Ireland was established. The Royal University‚Äôs charter entitled all Irish students to sit the Universities examinations and receive its degrees. The University was renamed as University College - Dublin in 1882. Recognition The Catholic University was neither a recognised university so far as the civil authorities were concerned, nor an institution offering recognised degrees. Newman had little success in establishing the new university, though over ¬£250,000 had been raised from the laity to fund it. Though they held the foundation money as trustees, the hierarchy in 1859 sent most of it to support an Irish Brigade led by Myles O'Reilly to help defend Rome in the Second Italian War of Independence. Newman left the university in 1857. According to Lytton Strachey (in his book, Eminent Victorians, p. 72)Lytton Strachey (1918) Eminent Victorians, The Modern Library, New York > \\"Eventually he realised something else: he saw that the whole project of a > Catholic University had been evolved as a political and ecclesiastical > weapon against the Queen's Colleges of Peel, and that was all. As an > instrument of education, it was simply laughed at ; and he himself had been > called in because his name would be a valuable asset in a party game. When > he understood that, he resigned his rectorship and returned to the Oratory.\\" Subsequently the school went into a serious decline; in 1879 only three students had registered. The situation changed in 1880 when the recognised Royal University of Ireland came into being and students of the Catholic University were entitled to sit the Royal University examinations and receive its degrees.University Education (Ireland) Act 1879 After the 1880 reforms the Catholic University consisted of a number of constituent colleges, including St Patrick's College, Maynooth and Cecilia St. Medical School (see below), with much of the original university then merging into another of its colleges, University College Dublin. Following the 1879 Act all Catholic Colleges including Carlow College, Holy Cross College and Blackrock College (The French College) came under the Catholic University.Page 96, Ireland Since the Famine by F.S.L. Lyons, Fontana Press, (1971) Subsequently other seminaries such as St. Kieran's College, Kilkenny, the Carmelite College, Terenure became affiliated to the Catholic University and hence the new Royal University. University College was passed to the control of the Jesuits in 1883, when it housed the faculties of the Catholic University except medicine. National University of Ireland, 1909 In 1909 the Catholic University essentially came to an end with the creation of the National University of Ireland, with University College Dublin as a constituent, however the Catholic University of Ireland remained a legal entity until 1911.Post Famine Ireland- Social Structure Ireland as it Really Was, by Desmond Keenan, 2006. In 1915 the NUI awarded honorary doctorates to a number of former students of the CUI.Catholic University of Ireland NUI Honorary Degrees 1915 www.nui.ie Catholic University Medical School The Catholic University Medical School had commenced lectures for medical students in 1855, in Cecilia Street, Dublin. The recognition of its graduates by chartered institutions (the RCSI) ensured its success, unlike the associated Catholic University.National University of Ireland ‚Äì History of the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland This ensured that the medical school became the most successful constituent college of the Catholic University and by 1900 the medical school had become the largest medical school in Ireland. The 1908 reforms reconstituted the Catholic University Medical School as the Faculty of Medicine of University College Dublin, with Dr. D. J. Coffey, M.B.(RUI), Professor of Physiology, Catholic University Medical School, becoming the first president of UCD.

The purpose of ESI is to tackle the problem of web infrastructure scaling. It is an application of edge computing. It is fairly common for websites to have generated content. It could be because of changing content like catalogs or forums, or because of personalization. This creates a problem for caching systems. To overcome this problem a group of companies (Akamai, Art Technology Group, BEA Systems, Circadence Corporation, Digital Island, Inc., Interwoven, Inc., Open Market, whose ESI-related technology is now owned by FatWire Software, Oracle Corporation and Vignette Corporation) developed the ESI specification and submitted it to the W3C for approval. The proposal editor was Mark Nottingham. ESI Language Specification 1.0 was submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for approval in August 2001. The W3C has acknowledged receipt, but has not accepted the proposal. ESI is implemented by some content delivery networks, such as Akamai, and by some caching proxy servers such as Varnish, Squid and Mongrel ESI, although many do not implement the complete specification. Akamai also adds additional features to the version they support.  Syntax  ESI element tags are inserted into HTML or other text based content during creation. Instead of being displayed to viewers, these ESI tags are directives that instruct an ESI processor to take some action. The XML based ESI tags indicate to the edge-side processing agent the action that needs to be taken to complete the page's assembly. One simple example of an ESI element is the include tag which is used to include content external to the page. An ESI include tag placed in-line within an HTML document would look like: In this case the ESI processor would retrieve the src URL, or failing that the alt URL, or if that failed do nothing. The ESI system is usually a caching proxy server so it may have a local copy of these files which it can insert without going back to the server. Alternatively the whole page with the ESI tags may be cached, and only the ESI requests may be made to the origin server. This allows different caching times for different parts of the page, or different degrees of personalisation.  Features  There are four main features in ESI: * inclusion of page fragments, as illustrated above; * variables which can be set from cookies or HTTP headers and then used in other ESI statements or written into markup; * conditions so that different markup can be used based on variables, for example if a cookie is set or not; * error handling, so that a failover can be used if an origin server is unavailable.  Alternatives  The main alternatives to ESI are * to do assembly on the origin server using Server Side Includes and many types of server-side scripting. * to use client-side scripting and techniques collectively known as Ajax (see: Dynamic web page) in the browser * to establish a protocol between origin and edge such that recurring content will be included on the edge automatically, as with Cloudflare's Railgun protocol https://www.cloudflare.com/railgun/ * to do assembly in the browser using web components.

The previous day John had discovered an IRA arms cache under a fallen tombstone when he was visiting a family grave and reported the weapons to his father, his father then contacted the Royal Ulster Constabulary who rather than removing the weapons, passed the information to the British Army, who placed SAS operatives at the site. The next day, John returned to the graveyard (assumingly out of curiosity to see if the weapons were still there). He was then shot dead by the British soldiers, who alleged he picked up a rifle and aimed it towards them, however a leaked RUC document confirmed 16 year old John was shot in the back and his fingerprints were not on any of the recovered weapons. 2 soldiers were put on trial for the killing, but both were acquitted and the Boyle family never received any form of apology from the security forces.

The long-distance Tuscarora Trail traverses the southern ridge and northern bench of the mountain. Together with Third Hill Mountain to the east, the two mountains form a blind valley that contains Sleepy Creek Lake and the Sleepy Creek Wildlife Management Area. Sleepy Creek and Third Hill Mountains are distinctive for their height in the relatively level terrain of the far Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. Geography The southern end of Sleepy Creek Mountain, Shockeys Knob (), lies in northern Frederick County, Virginia and is shared by Berkeley and Morgan counties in West Virginia. The mountain continues along southwest-northeast orientation between the two counties and peaks again at High Rock (). Sleepy Creek Mountain is conjoined with Third Hill Mountain at \\"Locks-of-the-Mountain\\". From \\"Locks-of-the- Mountain\\", the Meadow Branch of Sleepy Creek is formed flowing northward between the two mountain ridges. North of this point, Sleepy Creek Mountain reaches its highest summit at . East of Johnsons Mill, Whites Gap () is formed in mountain.

It was written by Wolfgang Baur and Monte Cook. It was later converted to d20 Modern rules and published as a stand-alone book in 2006. Development Wolfgang Baur did considerable research into the occult, UFO, and government conspiracy theories in preparation for writing the Dark‚Ä¢Matter game. Background In the setting, the Hoffmann Institute is an organization which investigates strange creatures and phenomena. The players take on the roles of members of this organization, and delve into the supernatural and mysterious. The premise of the game is that nearly every strange or supernatural story ever widely told is true, but a web of conspiracies and secret organizations hide this truth from the average person. This premise was not unique to Dark‚Ä¢Matter, having first been used as the basis for a role-playing game in Bureau 13. Contents The original book was hardbound with 288 pages illustrated in color. It was divided into chapters covering the background of the Dark‚Ä¢Matter setting to include an introduction to the Hoffmann Institute, hero creation, magic and psionics, history of the setting, the Illuminati, and places of interest. Highlights include: * The true and secret history of Earth. * Detailed descriptions of 13 powerful conspiracies and secret societies pulling the strings of power, plus nearly 20 more minor organizations. * Dozens of mysterious sites and hidden strongholds, from the ancient enigma of the Pyramids to the rotten fa√ßade of Washington, D.C. * New skills and careers for heroes, including options for advanced characters. * New rules for using FX (magic) in your Alternity game, including 45 new Arcane Magic and Faith FX spells. * Nearly two dozen strange creatures. * Gamemaster tips and tricks for running paranormal- and conspiracy-based games. * Raw Recruits, an introductory adventure. * Alternity Fast-Play Rules. Accessories and novels There were four accessories produced for the setting. Three of them were published in perfect bound paperback format and one was published as an electronic PDF file. There were also various articles published in Dungeon magazine, Amazing Stories, and Dragon magazine. The Dark‚Ä¢Matter Arms and Equipment Guide provided a more detailed list of equipment appropriate to the setting. The Xenoforms Book provided many more supernatural and alien creatures from myth and folklore to add to a campaign. The Killing Jar was the first adventure published after those provided in the main rulebook. The final book, which was provided as an electronic PDF, is The Final Church. It is a combination sourcebook and adventure. It provides information on the organization known as The Final Church and pits the characters against them. There were five novels written for the setting although only four of them actually saw print. The fifth was offered as an electronic PDF file for a short period of time. In order the books were: # In Hollow Houses, by Gary A. Braunbeck # If Whispers Call, by Don Bassingthwaite # In Fluid Silence, by G. W. Tirpa # Of Aged Angels, by Monte Cook # By Dust Consumed, by Don Bassingthwaite (only available for a short period of time as a PDF file) d20 Modern system Some of the Dark‚Ä¢Matter material has since been incorporated into the d20 Modern role-playing game and its d20 Menace Manual supplement. Dark‚Ä¢Matter was first converted into a d20 Modern campaign in Dungeon #108/Polyhedron #163 as Dark‚Ä¢Matter: Shades of Grey. In September 2006, Dark‚Ä¢Matter was officially made into a d20 Modern campaign setting with the publication of d20 Dark‚Ä¢Matter.

It is housed in an Oratory House, next to the Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (Brompton Oratory) in the Brompton Road, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London, SW7. There are four other Oratories in the UK, the Birmingham Oratory, the Manchester Oratory, the Oxford Oratory and the York Oratory. Origins The London Oratory was founded in 1849, the year after John Henry Cardinal Newman established the Birmingham Oratory, when Newman sent Frederick Faber and some companions, including Thomas Francis Knox, to start an Oratory in London. The original premises (a former whisky store) were in King William Street (now William IV Street), near Charing Cross. In 1854 the community moved to its present Brompton Road site, adjacent to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The site had previously been owned by Robert Pollard, who had set up a boys‚Äô boarding school there, known as Blemell House. Newman was not initially enthusiastic with a location he considered in, what was then, the suburbs. \\"The London Oratory.\\" Survey of London: Volume 41, Brompton. Ed. F H W Sheppard.

F. ‚ÄòThe Oratory in London‚Äô, Oratory Parish Magazine, April, May 1924, pp. pp. 502, 517‚Äì18. An Oratory House was built in 1854, followed by a large temporary church. The house contained the congregations' chapel, known as \\"the Little Oratory\\", decorated in 1871 by John Hungerford Pollen, who, at that time, was connected with the nearby South Kensington Museum.Concise Dictionary of National Biography The church was replaced in 1884 by the present neo-baroque building, designed by Herbert Gribble. Until the opening of Westminster Cathedral in 1903, the London Oratory was the venue for all great Catholic occasions in London, including the funeral of Cardinal Manning in 1892. Together with their Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the community of the Oratorian Fathers is often popularly, though less accurately, referred to as the 'Brompton Oratory'.\\"Funding the Oratory\\", The London Oratory The Oratory parish is part of the Roman Catholic metropolitan diocese of Westminster, at whose request the Oratory parish is run by the Fathers of the Oratory.

There are several masses offered each day and private masses are available by arrangement, as are weddings and funerals. Confessions are also heard daily and priests are always available for counsel and advice. The London Oratory, which is currently served by three choirs, is famous in particular for the solemn celebration of the Roman liturgy, especially in Latin, and for its preservation of the traditional place of music in the liturgy.

They lived to the north of, and were closely associated with, the Woiwurrung speaking Wurundjeri people. Their territory was to the north of the Great Dividing Range in the watersheds of the Broken, Delatite, Coliban, Goulburn and Campaspe Rivers. They were also known by white settlers as the Devil's River Tribe or Goulburn River Tribe. History The Taungurong people used the King and Howqua River valleys as a major route for trade or war between tribes. The Howqua River valley contains a number of archaeological sites of significance including at least two quarry sites for greenstone, an exceptionally hard rock used for stone axes, spears and other cutting tools which the Taungurong traded with other tribes. There are many other significant cultural both tangible and in tangible across their country. A raiding party of up to 40 Taungurong is believed to have been killed in May‚ÄìJune 1839 on Dja Dja Wurrung territory at the Campaspe Plains massacre. In February 1859 some Wurundjeri elders, led by Simon Wonga (aged 35) and brother Tommy Munnering (aged 24) petitioned Protector William Thomas to secure land on behalf of the Taungurong clans for the Kulin at the junction of the Acheron and Goulburn rivers in Taungurong territory. Initial representations to the Victorian Government were positive, however the intervention of the most powerful squatter in Victoria, Hugh Glass, resulted in their removal to a colder site, Mohican Station, which was not suitable for agricultural land and had to be abandoned. In March 1863 after three years of upheaval, the surviving leaders, among them Simon Wonga and William Barak, led forty Wurundjeri, Taungurong (Goulburn River) and Bun warrung people over the Black Spur and squatted on a traditional camping site on Badger Creek near Healesville and requested ownership of the site. This became Coranderrk Station. The Taungurung Clans Aboriginal Corporation was registered as a Registered Aboriginal Party by the Victorian Aboriginal Heritage Council on 16 July 2009.

Usage The 802.11w standard is implemented in Linux and BSD's as part of the 80211mac driver code base, which is used by several wireless driver interfaces; i.e., ath9k. The feature is easily enabled in most recent kernels and Linux OS's using these combinations. OpenWrt in particular provides an easy toggle as part of the base distribution. The feature has been implemented for the first time into Microsoft operating systems in Windows 8. This has caused a number of compatibility issues particularly with wireless access points that are not compatible with the standard. Rolling back the wireless adapter driver to one from Windows 7 usually fixes the issue. Wireless LANs without this standard send system management information in unprotected frames, which makes them vulnerable. This standard protects against network disruption caused by malicious systems that forge disassociation requests (deauth) that appear to be sent by valid equipment http://www.ieee802.org/21/doctree/2005_Meeting_Docs/2005-09_meeting_docs/21-05-0381-00-0000-802-11-liaison- September05.ppt such as Evil Twin attacks.

She is known primarily for her documentary work and contributions to the women's movement in the seventies and eighties. Sander's work is characterized by her emphasis of the experimental over the narrative arc. Sander is considered to have started the \\"new\\" feminist movement in Germany with her passionate speech at the Socialist German Students Conference. A lot of Sander's work is about portraying female perspectives and showing the every day struggles that women go through to survive. In her essay \\"Feminists and Film (1977),\\" Sander states the motivation for her work: \\"To put it in other terms: women's most authentic act today--in all areas including the arts--consists not in standardizing and harmonizing the means, but rather in destroying them. Where women are true, they break things.\\" Sander's work is concerned with the breakage of conventional ideas and forms. \\" Early life and education Born in Berlin, Sander was living in Dresden during the firestorm bombing of Dresden during WWII. By the time she graduated from high school, she had been to 15 schools around Germany. She received her Abitur in Remscheid in 1957 and went on to study acting at the Ida Ehre School in Hamburg. In 1959, Sander married Finnish writer Markku Lahtela in 1959, and had a son, Silvio Lahtela. After the birth of Silvio, Sander and her family moved to Helsinki where she studied Germanistics and psychology at the University of Helsinki. Sander also directed and performed in Ernst Toller's play \\"Der deutsche Hinkemann and Grass' \\"Noch zehn Minuten bis Buffalo.\\" On the side, she also taught classes on drama and improvisation. From 1966 to 1969, she studied at the newly founded film school 'Deutsche Film und Fernsehakademie'. Sander's work in cinema is very closely linked to her political engagement as a feminist. In 1965 Sander returned to the BRD where she worked at the German Film and Television Academy as a reporter and translator struggling to support herself and her son. She found it frustrating that a woman who works as much as she did still struggled to survive and became active in the Socialist German Student Organization (SDS). Here she would go on to find the \\"Aktionsrat zur Befreiung der Frauen‚Äù (Action Council for the Liberation of Women) in January 1968, which started the movement for Kinderl√§den which converted shops into childcare centers. Career and activism Sander decided to continue her education at the Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie in Berlin (Berlin Film and Television Academy) where she would go on to become one of the institutions first ever graduates. Sander became very active in the Students' movement during this time and started the \\"Aktionsrat zur Befreiung der Frau\\" (Action Council for the Liberation of Women) in 1968. In 1968, she gave a powerful speech at the SDS (Socialist German Students) conference in Frankfurt where she stressed how women are only truly accepted in society when they \\"adapt.\\" She asked for the SDS to support the women's political agenda. When her male colleagues tried to ignore this plea and to return to business as usual, Sigrid R√ºger hurled her famous tomato, and the second wave of the German women's movement was born. In 1971, Helke Sander organized the women's group 'Brot und Rosen'. The platform centered on the idea that birth control was not safe for women. In 1972, Helke Sander continued work on her birth control project. Her film Macht die Pille frei? (Does the Pill Liberate Women?) who she produced with Sarah Schumann, was a campaign against anti-abortion laws. Together with Claudia von Aleman, she organized the feminist film conference 'Erste internationale Frauenfilmseminar' which took place in 1973 in Berlin. This was the first ever European feminist film festival. The festival premiered 40 different European female filmmakers. In 1974, she founded Frauen und Film (journal), the first feminist European film journal, where she was chief editor and author until 1982. Frauen und film was the only feminist film journal in Europe at the time and was a hub for analyzing and critiquing sexism in film as well as a forum to discuss female films. Her first full- length film \\"Die allseitig reduzierte Pers√∂nlichkeit ‚Äì REDUPERS\\" (The All- Around Reduced Personality) is among the most important German feminist films of the 1970s. The film blends techniques of both documentary and fictional film. The story follows a gifted woman artist in Berlin who faces demands from all aspects of society, emphasizing the struggles women face professionally, financially, politically, and personally. This film helped create \\"a new filmic language\\" in which her experimental style and use of filters began to take over this new wave of filmmaking. [7] [8] Sander's critical eye towards postwar German culture was expanded in her 1984 satire on sexual politics, \\"Der Beginn aller Schrecken ist Liebe\\" (Love is the Beginning of All Terror) in which she stars in. The story is about a man who comes between two women that present a female perspective full of wit and irony. In 1985, through an election process, Helke Sander joined the West Berlin Academy of Arts. Sander would later file a resignation from the Academy citing \\"misogyny, nepotism, and corruption\\".[3] In 1989 Sander, Margarethe von Trotta, Christel Buschmann and Helma Sanders-Brahms produced . Bericht aus Bonn (The Germans and their Men ‚Äì Report from Bonn) was a docu-fiction film produced in 1989 in which Sander investigates the impact of feminist thought after twenty years of women's activism; male parliamentarians, ministerial officials, the federal Chancellor and the man in the street are all interrogated.[9] Starting in 1981 Sander was a professor at the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste, an Academy of Fine Arts, in Hamburg. She left the institution in 2001.[3] Helke Sander was honored by the Arsenal Institute for Film and Video Art (Berlin) in 2003. A retrospective of her collected works in film was shown in their Arsenal Cinema.[3] Sander is also an author and publicist for \\"Die Geschichten der drei Damen K\\" (The Three Women K) where stories about irony within heterosexual relationships are told from a female perspective. In 2005 Sander made \\"Mitten im Malestream\\" (In the Midst of the Malestream) in which she reviews and investigates the second wave of German feminism that she helped kickstart back in 1968. This film explores the central conflicts and questions that seem to be left unanswered. Sander's entire career of activism can be summarized throughout this film, but it also offers more than just a summary and pushes the boundaries of experimental film.  Filters and Films  Helke Sander's work is characterized by the use of filters, which function as a visual cue to remind the audience of the subjectivity presented. The use of the filter draws attention to the properties of a documentary and the ideology being communicated, allowing the audience an awareness of the rhetoric being delivered. Sander's use of filters ushered in a new wave of experimental filmmaking, where the visual style of the film became equally as important as the subject itself. = Redupers: The All-Round Reduced Personality (1977) = Redupers is a documentary about the Berlin Wall, the border between East and West Berlin, and the central character's relationship to Berlin . Through authorial inscription, Helke Sander portrays the central character of the film, a woman who must come to terms with the political and private sphere of being a woman against the backdrop of unrest. Helke Sander also focuses on photographer Edda Chiemnyjewski's efforts. Feminist interpretations of Helke Sander's film, Redupers, posit that the Berlin Wall functions not only as a representation of the divide geographically, but also as a stand-in for the psychic and sexual differences between men and women. = The Subjective Factor (1980) = The Subjective Factor chronicles the origins of the women's movement and the Berlin student movement, set against the backdrop of a commune, and deals with issues of anarchism, terrorism, and phallocentrism. Sander's portrayal shows Leftist males run the commune while women are relegated to domestic duties and are denied rights to speak out. The film is set during the late sixties and consists of a combination of fictional footage and newsreel footage. The use of filter in the film draws attention to the properties of the documentary itself, the views that are presented. Sander's use of the female voice over in The Subjective Factor was a marker of progressive film making at the time. = Liberators Take Liberties: War, Rapes, Children (1992) = Her 1992 documentary film, BeFreier und BeFreite (Liberators Take Liberties), examines the mass rape of German women committed by soldiers of the Red Army at the end of World War II. Sander's film was particularly controversial because there were concerns that the film placed too much emphasis on German suffering, thereby lessening guilt for the Holocaust. Defenders of the film argue that Sander's project is a complex reflection on rape as a weapon of war. They argue that the film resists presenting a one-sided depiction of German victimization citing the film's attention to German war crimes and self-reflexive qualities. This documentary won the Nestor Almendros Prize in the 1993 Human Rights Festival. The film situated Sander as a researcher historian contributing to history, because Sander uncovered and catalogued events previously unvisited. This documentary uses an arrangement of interviews to create an overall thematic message. Questions have been raised regarding Sander's use of filters in this documentary, especially as it relates to the portrayal of ethnic qualities, which were overemphasized within the interviews.

Background  William Lloyd Warner was born in Redlands, California, into the family of William Taylor and Clara Belle Carter, middle-class farmers. Warner attended San Bernardino High School, after which he joined the army in 1917. He contracted tuberculosis in 1918 and was released from the service. In 1918 he married Billy Overfield, but the marriage lasted only briefly. Warner enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied English and became associated with the Socialist Party. In 1921, he transferred to New York to pursue a career in acting. The plan did not work well, and Warner returned to Berkeley to complete his studies in English. At Berkeley, he met Robert H. Lowie, professor of anthropology, who encouraged him to turn to anthropology. Warner became fascinated by the work of Bronislaw Malinowski and A. R. Radcliffe-Brown, who introduced him to the British functionalist approach to social anthropology. He also developed friendships with anthropologists Alfred L. Kroeber and Theodora Kroeber. Warner received his B.A. from Berkeley in 1925. Research in Australia From 1926 to 1929, Warner spent three years as a researcher for the Rockefeller Foundation and the Australian National Research Council, studying the Murngin people of Arnhem Land in northern Australia with his base at the Milingimbi Methodist Mission. He formed a deep friendship with Mahkarolla, his main Murrgin informant, whom he described in an appendix to his 1947 book. From 1929 to 1935, Warner studied at Harvard in the department of anthropology and the Business School, trying to obtain his Ph.D. He used his study among Murngin for his dissertation, which was later published in his first book, A Black Civilization: A Social Study of an Australian Tribe (1937). He never defended the thesis, and accordingly, did not receive his doctoral degree. While at Harvard, Warner taught at the Graduate School of Business Administration. From 1930 to 1935, he conducted his most influential study, which was known by the name The Yankee City project. In 1932, he married Mildred Hall, with whom he had three children. Career at Harvard Warner enrolled at Harvard (1929‚Äì1935) as a graduate student in the Department of Anthropology and the Graduate School of Business School Administration. His first book, A Black Civilization: A Social Study of an Australian Tribe (1937), followed the conventional anthropological path of studying so-called \\"primitive people.\\" During his years at Harvard, he became a member of a group of social scientists, led by Australian social psychologist Elton Mayo, the father of the Human Relations Movement, best known for his discovery of the Hawthorne Effect in the course of his motivational research at the Western Electric Company. Mayo was exploring the social and psychological dimensions of industrial settings, and stimulated Warner's interest in contemporary society. Warner became involved in Mayo's project of studying the workplace and organizational structure, using the Western Electric Hawthorne plant in Chicago as its location. Warner's contribution consisted in the introduction of anthropological techniques of observation and interviewing, an innovation that helped cultural explanations to emerge from data analysis. He was largely responsible for the design of the third phase of the Hawthorne project known as the Bank Wiring Observation Room (BWOR) which examined how workers actually performed their jobs, as opposed to what they stated they would do during interviews. Career in Chicago In 1935, he was appointed professor of anthropology and sociology at the University of Chicago, where he remained until 1959, when he was appointed professor of social research at Michigan State University. During his Chicago years, Warner's research included important studies of black communities in Chicago and the rural South, of a New England community (\\"Yankee City\\"/Newburyport, MA), and a Midwestern community (\\"Jonesville\\"). In addition to these community studies, Warner researched business leaders and government administrators, as well as producing important books on race, religion, and American society. Warner's Yankee City study lasted nearly a decade and produced 5 volumes: The Social Life of a Modern Community (1941), The Status System of a Modern Community (1942), The Social Systems of American Ethnic Groups (1945), The Social System of a Modern Factory (1947), and The Living and the Dead: A Study in the Symbolic Life of Americans (1959). Criticisms Despite his impressive productivity and wide range of interests, Warner's work has long been out of fashion. The noted Marxist sociologist Oliver Cromwell Cox's vigorous critique of Warner's framing of race in the Southern US as caste contributed to the disappearance of this once-fashionable conception.Herbert M. Hunter, Sameer Y. Abraham, \\"Race, class, and the world system: the sociology of Oliver C. Cox\\", Monthly Review Press, 1987 An empiricist in an era when the social disciplines were increasingly theoretical, fascinated with economic and social inequality in a time when Americans were eager to deny its significance, and implicitly skeptical of the possibilities of legislating social change at a time when many social scientists were eager to be policymakers, Warner's focus on uncomfortable subjects made his work unfashionable. Warner's interest in communities (when the social science mainstream was stressing the importance of urbanization) and religion (when the fields' leaders were aggressively secularist) also helped to marginalize his work. More positive assessments of his work have recently emerged. Sources * Easton, John. 2001. Consuming Interests. University of Chicago Magazine 93(6) * Marquand, John P. 1939.

He made a series of sound recordings from the 1960s to 1980s, recounting bizarre and funny experiences from his long career, and tales of his hobbies of motorcycling, hunting and shooting. He was much in demand as an after-dinner speaker. His tales feature coarse language and their content is equally strong stuff for the period. Once, for instance, he was hired to clear out a farm's septic tank using explosives, an episode Bates described as \\"The Shower of Shit Over Cheshire\\" On another occasion he surprised a young couple in what he described as 'a compromising position' whilst clearing trees for the Oulton Park racing circuit, an incident which gave the Knickerbrook corner its name. Bates served with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War as a Handley Page Halifax bomber pilot, and then learned his explosives skills as a bomb disposal specialist. After the war he returned to his previous employer Rolls Royce, hoping to resume his old job, but was told \\"We're cutting down, you know\\". Bates then started his own demolition business, drawing on his wartime expertise. He later noted that it was a good decision, as \\"over the years I've managed to do all right while Rolls Royce have gone steadily bust\\". He was known for carrying sticks of explosive in his pockets, even producing them while giving testimony in trials, to the horror of the court. Most high explosives are harmless unless used with a detonator, but this is not generally understood. Bates had diabetes. In August 2006 he was admitted to hospital with congestive heart failure, and on 1 September 2006 he died, aged 83. He was buried at St Mary's church in Sandbach town centre.

They may be free or require payment. Casio electronic dictionary  Information Most of the early electronic dictionaries were, in effect, print dictionaries made available in digital form: the content was identical, but the electronic editions provided users with more powerful search functions. But soon the opportunities offered by digital media began to be exploited. Two obvious advantages are that limitations of space (and the need to optimize its use) become less pressing, so additional content can be provided; and the possibility arises of including multimedia content, such as audio pronunciations and video clips.De Schryver, Gilles-Maurice, ‚ÄòLexicographers‚Äô dreams in the electronic dictionary age‚Äô, in International Journal of Lexicography, 16(2), 2003:143-199Atkins, S. & Rundell, M. The Oxford Guide to Practical Lexicography, Oxford University Press 2008: 238-246 Electronic dictionary databases, especially those included with software dictionaries are often extensive and can contain up to 500,000 headwords and definitions, verb conjugation tables, and a grammar reference section. Bilingual electronic dictionaries and monolingual dictionaries of inflected languages often include an interactive verb conjugator, and are capable of word stemming and lemmatization. Publishers and developers of electronic dictionaries may offer native content from their own lexicographers, licensed data from print publications, or both, as in the case of Babylon offering premium content from Merriam Webster, and Ultralingua offering additional premium content from Collins, Masson, and Simon & Schuster, and Paragon Software offering original content from Duden, Britannica, Harrap, Merriam- Webster and Oxford.  Writing systems  As well as Latin script, electronic dictionaries are also available in logographic and right-to-left scripts, including Arabic, Persian, Chinese, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Cyrillic, and Thai.  Dictionary software  Dictionary software generally far exceeds the scope of the hand held dictionaries. Many publishers of traditional printed dictionaries such as Langenscheidt, Collins-Reverso, OED ‚Äì Oxford English Dictionary, Duden, American Heritage, and Hachette, offer their resources for use on desktop and laptop computers. These programs can either be downloaded or purchased on CD-ROM and installed. Other dictionary software is available from specialised electronic dictionary publishers such as iFinger, Abbyy Lingvo, Collins-Ultralingua, Mobile Systems and Paragon Software.

The well-known brands, such as Instant-Dict (Âø´Ë≠ØÈÄö), Besta (ÁÑ°Êïµ), and Golden Global View (ÊñáÊõ≤Êòü), includes basic functions like dictionaries, TTS, calculator, calendar etc. They also have functions other than just dictionary, for example, MP3 player, Video player, web browser (WiFi), and simple games. Some also support Adobe Flash (SWF files). Most of them usually will have a touch screen, Qwerty keyboard, a speaker, SD card slot, and sometimes microphone and camera also, for example, MD8500 from Instant-Dict. Their functions can even be comparable to smartphones, with the exception of phone capabilities since they do not have radios to make or receive phone calls.

Because they are intended to be fully portable, the dictionaries are battery-powered and made with durable casing material. Although produced all over the world, handheld dictionaries are especially popular in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, and neighbouring countries, where they are the dictionary of choice for many users learning English as a second language.Chen, Yuzhen, 'Dictionary use and EFL learning: a contrastive study of pocket electronic dictionaries and paper dictionaries', in International Journal of Lexicography23 (3), 2010:275-306 Some of the features of hand held dictionaries include stroke order animations, voice output, handwriting recognition for Kanji and Kana, language-learning programs, a calculator, PDA-like organizer functions, encyclopedias, time zone and currency converters, and crossword puzzle solvers. Dictionaries that contain data for several languages may have a \\"jump\\" or \\"skip-search\\" feature that allows users to move between the dictionaries when looking up words, and a reverse translation action that allows further look-ups of words displayed in the results. Many manufacturers produce hand held dictionaries that use licensed dictionary contentFranklin MWS-1840 that use a database such as the Merriam Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus while others may use a proprietary database from their own lexicographers. Many devices can be expanded for several languages with the purchase of additional memory cards. Manufacturers include AlfaLink, Atree, Besta, Casio, Canon, Instant Dict, Ectaco, Franklin, Iriver, Lingo, Maliang Cyber Technology, Compagnia Lingua Ltd., Nurian, Seiko, and Sharp. = In Japan = The market size as of 2014 was about 24.2 billion yen (= $227.1 million as of May/2016), although the market has been shrinking gradually from 2007 because of smartphones and tablet computers. The targeted customer base has been being shifted from business users to students. Sony and Seiko have withdrawn from the market. As of 2016, Casio had 59.3% of the market share, followed by Sharp with 21.5% and Canon with 19.2%. At 2016, Seiko announced that their mobile device apps on iPad iOS has been launched.  Dictionaries on mobile devices  Dictionaries of all types are available as apps for smartphones and for tablet computers such as Apple's iPad, the BlackBerry PlayBook and the Motorola Xoom. The needs of translators and language learners are especially well catered for, with apps for bilingual dictionaries for numerous language pairs, and for most of the well-known monolingual learner's dictionaries such as the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English and the Macmillan English Dictionary.

Many have additional content, such as blogs and features on new words. Some are collaborative projects, most notably Wiktionary and the Collins Online Dictionary. And some, like the Urban Dictionary, consist of entries (sometimes self-contradictory) supplied by users. Many dictionaries for special purposes, especially for professional and trade terminology, and regional dialects and language variations, are published on the websites of organizations and individual authors. Although they may often be presented in list form without a search function, because of the way in which the information is stored and transmitted, they are nevertheless electronic dictionaries.  Evaluation  There are differences in quality of hardware (hand held devices), software (presentation and performance), and dictionary content. Some hand helds are more robustly constructed than others, and the keyboards or touch screen input systems should be physically compared before purchase. The information on the GUI of computer based dictionary software ranges from complex and cluttered, to clear and easy-to-use with user definable preferences including font size and colour. A major consideration is the quality of the lexical database. Dictionaries intended for collegiate and professional use generally include most or all of the lexical information to be expected in a quality printed dictionary. The content of electronic dictionaries developed in association with leading publishers of printed dictionaries is more reliable that those aimed at the traveler or casual user, while bilingual dictionaries that have not been authored by teams of native speaker lexicographers for each language, will not be suitable for academic work. Some developers opt to have their products evaluated by an independent academic body such as the CALICO. Another major consideration is that the devices themselves and the dictionaries in them are generally designed for a particular market. As an example, almost all handheld Japanese-English electronic dictionaries are designed for people with native fluency in Japanese who are learning and using English; thus, Japanese words do not generally include furigana pronunciation glosses, since it is assumed that the reader is literate in Japanese (headwords of entries do have pronunciation, however). Further, the primary manner to look up words is by pronunciation, which makes looking up a word with unknown pronunciation difficult (for example, one would need to know that Á∂≤ÁæÖ \\"comprehensive\\" is pronounced „ÇÇ„ÅÜ„Çâ, moura to look it up directly). However, higher end Japanese dictionaries include character recognition, so users (native speakers of Japanese or not) can look up words by writing the kanji. Similar limitations exist in most two or multi-language dictionaries and can be especially crippling when the languages are not written in the same script or alphabet; it's important to find a dictionary optimized for the user's native language.  Integrated technology  Several developers of the systems that drive electronic dictionary software offer API and SDK ‚Äì Software Development Kit tools for adding various language-based (dictionary, translation, definitions, synonyms, and spell checking and grammar correction) functions to programs, and web services such as the AJAX API used by Google. These applications manipulate language in various ways, providing dictionary/translation features, and sophisticated solutions for semantic search. They are often available as a C++ API, an XML-RPC server, a .NET API, or as a Python API for many operating systems (Mac, Windows, Linux, etc.) and development environments, and can also be used for indexing other kinds of data.Semantica S.A.Ultralingua Inc.

The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by South Western Railway. It is one of two stations in the town, the other, named Farnborough North, is situated on the North Downs Line. The station is usually known as Farnborough (Main) in order to distinguish it from Farnborough North, including by National Rail and South Western Railway, although it is often signposted simply as Farnborough. It is from Railways in the United Kingdom historically are measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to one mile. and is situated between and . History Farnborough railway station was opened in 1838 by the London and South Western Railway (then the London and Southampton Railway), on the line from London to Winchfield (then Shapley Heath). The next year, the line was extended to Basingstoke, then the next year it was connected to Southampton. Throughout its life, Farnborough has been a through station. In 1849, South Eastern Railway built the North Downs Line, and opened a station also known as Farnborough, but it was not renamed as its existing name Farnborough North until 1923. The main line railway station was often known as Farnborough (Main) and this has become its official name. It is referred to as simply 'Farnborough' on platform and road signs, but National Rail and South Western Railway officially use the suffix (though not on timetables). It was sometimes advertised as 'Farnborough for Aldershot' at an early stage. As with Hook and Winchfield, there is a wide gap between the tracks. Originally, an island platform stood between them. When the railway was quadrupled, the existing up track became the down fast. The former up platform, an island which had a loop line running behind it was demolished with the loop line becoming the up fast. The new up slow line and a new platform for up services were built at this time (early 1900s). One source suggests that it may have been used by Queen Victoria to get to Windsor Castle, though the main station she used for Windsor was Slough until Windsor got its own station. In 2011, the forecourt underwent refurbishment to add two lifts to the platforms plus a new transport interchange complete with taxi rank, three new bus stops and a large bicycle shelter. In 2012, the station booking hall underwent an extensive refurbishment and the booking hall was modernised and enlarged as a result. Furthermore, a double level car park was built in the station during 2014, which has greatly increased car parking capacity at the station.

He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group and from 1971 onwards a member of Deutsche Bank's Management Board. An advisor to Helmut Kohl and a proponent of a unified European economy, he was also an influential figure in shaping the policies towards developing nations.Protzman, Ferdinand. \\"Head of Top West German Bank Is Killed in Bombing by Terrorists\\", The New York Times, 1 December 1989.

He was assassinated, probably by the West German far-left terrorist group Red Army Faction, when an explosively formed projectile penetrated his armored convoy. Assassination Logo of the Alfred Herrhausen Society Herrhausen was killed by a sophisticated roadside bomb shortly after leaving his home in Bad Homburg on 30 November 1989. He was being chauffeured to work in his armoured Mercedes-Benz, with bodyguards in both a lead vehicle and another following behind. The 7 kg bomb was hidden in a bag on a bicycle parked next to the road that the assassins knew Herrhausen would be traveling in his three-car convoy. The bicycle had been consistently parked sans explosive in the same location along Herrhausen's route for extended period of time before the assassination itself, and it was therefore ignored by Herrhausen's security. The bomb was detonated when Herrhausen's car interrupted a beam of infrared light as it passed the bicycle. The bomb targeted the most vulnerable area of Herrhausen's car ‚Äì the door where he was sitting ‚Äì and required split-second timing to overcome the car's special armour plating. The bomb utilized a Misznay‚ÄìSchardin mechanism. A copper plate, placed between the explosive and the target, was deformed and projected by the force of the explosion. The detonation resulted in a mass of copper being projected toward the car at a speed of nearly two kilometers per second, efficiently penetrating the armoured Mercedes. Herrhausen's legs were severed and he bled to death. Aftermath No one has ever been charged with the murder. For a long time, the German federal prosecutor's office listed Andrea Klump and Christoph Seidler of the Red Army Faction as the only suspects. The Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany) presented a chief witness, Siegfried Nonne, who later retracted his statements in which he claimed to have sheltered four terrorists in his home. His half-brother Hugo F√∂ller furthermore declared that no other persons had been at the flat at the time. On 1 July 1992 German television broadcast Nonne's explanations of how he was coached and threatened by the Verfassungsschutz, the German internal intelligence agency, to become the main witness. In the same year, the Alfred Herrhausen Society was established to honour his memory. In 2004 the federal prosecutor dropped the charges against the Red Army Faction; the investigation was to continue without naming a suspect. Certain German and US media connected the assassination of Alfred Herrhausen to the Staatssicherheitsdienst (Stasi) of the GDR. The 2001 German documentary film Black Box BRD retells the lives and deaths of Alfred Herrhausen and Wolfgang Grams, a RAF member who was a major suspect in the attack on Herrhausen.Thomas Moser: Andreas Veiel: Black Box BRD.

Genetic use restriction technology (GURT), also known as terminator technology or suicide seeds, is the name given to proposed methods for restricting the use of genetically modified plants by activating (or deactivating) some genes only in response to certain stimuli, especially to cause second generation seeds to be infertile. The development and application of GURTs is primarily an attempt by private sector agricultural breeders to increase the extent of protection on their innovations. The technology was originally developed under a cooperative research and development agreement between the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture and Delta and Pine Land company in the 1990s and is not yet commercially available. (Position Paper Supporting V-GURT development) GURT was first reported on by the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and discussed during the 8th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Curitiba, Brazil, March 20‚Äì31, 2006. Process A GURT process that uses biological signals to make enzymes that cut out the blocker sequence. Because of the continued development of the technology and the continued protection of patents that develop it, many descriptions of GURT differ from others. Even so, the basic description of many GURTs are similar. The process is typically composed of four genetic components: a target gene, a promoter, a trait switch, and a genetic switch, sometimes with slightly different names in different papers. For example, a typical GURT works similarly to as follows: a plant with GURT technology has a target gene in its DNA that expresses when activated by a promoter gene. However, it is separated from the gene by a blocker sequence that prevents the promoter from accessing the target. When the plant receives a given external input, a genetic switch in the plant takes the input, amplifies it, and converts it into a biological signal. When a trait switch receives the amplified signal, it creates an enzyme that cuts the blocker sequence out. Finally, with the blocker sequence eliminated, the promoter gene is able to make the target gene to express itself in the plant. Yi Sang Reginald J. Millwood C. Neal Stewart Jr. \\"Gene use restriction technologies for transgenic plant bioconfinement\\" 04 June 2013https://www.biofortified.org/2015/12/gmos- and-patents-part-1-terminator-genes/ Retrieved 19 October 2018 In other versions of the process, an operator must bind to the trait switch in order for it to make the enzymes that cut out the blocker sequence. However, there are repressors that bind to the trait switch and prevent it from doing so. In this case, when the external input is applied, the repressors bond to it instead of the trait switch, allowing for the enzymes to be created that cut the blocker sequence, and the trait is expressed.Luca Lombardo. \\"Genetic use restriction technologies: a review\\" 17 July 2014 Other variations of GURT range widely, including systems such as letting the genetic switch directly affect the blocker sequence and bypass the need for a trait switch. Variants There are conceptually two types of GURT.Patrick Heffer. Biotechnology: a modern tool for food production improvement in Seed Policy and Programmes for the Central and Eastern European Countries, Commonwealth of Independent States and Other Countries in Transition. FAO Plant Production and Protection Paper 168. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2001Jefferson RA et al. Genetic Use Restriction Technologies: Technical Assessment of the Set of New Technologies which Sterilize or Reduce the Agronomic Value of Second Generation Seed, as Exemplified by U.S. Patent No. 5,723,765, and WO 94/03619. Expert paper, prepared for the Secretariat on 30 April 1999 V-GURTs were developed first, with patents ranging throughout the 1990s, while T-GURTS were developed later and are sometimes considered the second generation of V-GURTS. The differences between the two types of GURT mainly rely on what the target gene does when it is activated. =Variety specific= Variety specific genetic use restriction technologies (V-GURT) produce sterile seeds, so the seed from the crop could not be used as seeds, but only for sale as food or fodder. When a plant reaches a given reproductive stage in its cycle, the process of activating the target gene begins. In V-GURTs, the target gene is known as a disrupter gene, and is usually a cytotoxin that degrades the DNA or RNA of the plant. This results in a non- functioning seed that cannot grow into a plant. V-GURTs would not have an immediate impact on the large number of primarily western farmers who use hybrid seeds, as they do not produce their own planting seeds, and instead buy specialized hybrid seeds from seed production companies. However, currently around 80 percent of farmers in both Brazil and Pakistan grow crops based on saved seeds from previous harvests.Haider Rizvi, \\"BIODIVERSITY: Don't Sell \\"Suicide Seeds\\", Activists Warn\\", Inter Press Service News Agency, March 21, 2006 Consequentially, resistance to the introduction of GURT technology into developing countries is strong. The technology is restricted at the plant variety level, hence the term V-GURT. =Trait specific= Trait specific genetic use restriction technologies (T-GURT) are a second type of GURT that would modify a crop in such a way that the genetic enhancement engineered into the crop does not function until the plant is treated with a specific chemical. Retrieved October 17 2018 The chemical acts as the external input, activating the target gene. One difference in T-GURTs is the possibility that the gene could be toggled on and off with different chemical inputs, resulting in the same toggling on or off an associated trait. With T-GURTs, seeds could possibly be saved for planting with a condition that the new plants do not get any enhanced traits unless the external input is added. The technology is restricted at the trait level, hence the term T-GURT. Potential uses There are several proposed uses for GURTs that could benefit both businesses and farms. Non-viable seeds produced on V-GURT plants may reduce the propagation of volunteer plants. Volunteer plants can become an economic problem for larger-scale mechanized farming systems that incorporate crop rotation. Furthermore, under warm, wet harvest conditions non V-GURT grain can sprout, lowering the quality of grain produced. It is likely that this problem would not occur with the use of V-GURT grain varieties. Use of V-GURT technology could also prevent escape of transgenes into wild relatives and help lessen impacts on biodiversity. Crops modified to produce non-food products could be armed with GURT technology to prevent accidental transmission of these traits into crops meant for foods. One of the original proposed uses for GURTs was to use them as alternatives to keep farmers from reusing patented seeds in the case that typical biological patents do not exist or are not enforced. The use of T-GURTs by companies has been proposed to allow for the selling of a traditional seed that gets special functions only when sprayed with a certain activator chemical sold by the company. Controversy As of 2006, GURT seeds have not been commercialized anywhere in the world due to opposition from farmers, consumers, indigenous peoples, NGOs, and some governments. Using the technology, companies that manufacture genetic use restriction technologies could potentially be able to make much more revenue because the seeds sold would not be able to be resown. Another concern is that farmers purchasing the seeds would be greatly impacted, given they would have to buy new seeds every year. It has been argued that this would result in higher prices in food. GURT seeds are worried to cause a significant decrease in biodiversity and threaten native species of plants.https://intercontinentalcry.org/women-are-on-the- frontlines-of-a-race-against-time-to-save-native-seeds/ Retrieved October 17 2018 However, proponents of the technology dispute these claims, making the cases that because non-GMO hybrid plants are used in the same way and GURT seeds could help farmers deal with cross pollination, the benefits outweigh the potential negatives.https://fafdl.org/gmobb/the-myth-and-reality-of- terminator-seeds/ Retrieved October 17 2018 In 2000, the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity recommended a de facto moratorium on field- testing and commercial sale of terminator seeds; the moratorium was re- affirmed and the language strengthened in March 2006, at the COP8 meeting of the UNCBD. Specifically, the moratorium recommended that, due to a lack of research on the technology's potential risks, no field testing of GURTs nor products using them should be allowed until there was a sufficiently justified reason to do so. India and Brazil have passed national laws to prohibit the technology. See also * Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety * Diamond v.

Early life Barrie was born in Hong Kong to English parents. Her father was a successful lawyer and King's Counsel, F.C. Jenkins and her mother Sarah Cohen was a Russian Jewish actress and performed in the world's first professional Yiddish-language theater troupe. She received her education at a convent school in England and a finishing school in Switzerland. While still in her teens, she began pursuing a career as an actress, helped by her red-gold hair and blue eyes. She adopted the stage name Wendy Barrie in honour of Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie, who was her godfather. She began her acting life in English theatre. Film With James Stewart in Speed (1936) In 1932, Barrie made her screen debut in the film Threads, which was based upon a play. She went on to make a number of motion pictures for London Films under the Korda brothers, Alexander and Zoltan, the best known of which is 1933's The Private Life of Henry VIII, in which she portrayed Jane Seymour. In 1934, she appeared in Freedom of the Seas and was contracted by Fox Film Corporation for a film directed by Scott Darling that was made in Britain. The following year, she moved to the United States and made her first Hollywood film for Fox opposite Spencer Tracy in the romantic comedy It's a Small World, followed by Under Your Spell with Lawrence Tibbett. Loaned to MGM, Barrie starred opposite James Stewart in the 1936 film Speed. In 1939 she starred with Richard Greene and Basil Rathbone in the 20th Century Fox version of The Hound of the Baskervilles, and with Lucille Ball in RKO's Five Came Back. During the early 1940s, Barrie made several of The Saint and The Falcon mystery films with George Sanders. She made her final motion picture in 1954. Radio Barrie was a member of the cast of The Jack Haley Show on NBC (1937-1938) and CBS (1938-1939). She was an assistant on the Star for a Night program on the Blue Network (1943-1944), and she was one of the quizmasters on Detect and Collect on CBS (1945) and ABC (1945-1946).Dunning, John. (1998).

She continued to appear on network television on panel shows and as a guest star in the early 1950s, and also as a spokesperson for commercial products, including a stint as the original Revlon saleswoman on The $64,000 Question during its first months on air. Her pitching of Living Lipstick saw that product being sold out across the country. Barrie continued on local TV in New York City. Hollywood Walk of Fame star at Hollywood and Vine (background Broadway Hollywood Building) Advertisement for the premiere of The Wendy Barrie Show In 1953, three television stations owned by Taft Broadcasting Company and Cox Communications formed the short-lived \\"Tri-State Network\\" to compete with entertainment programming produced by Crosley Broadcasting Corporation on Crosley television stations in the Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton, Ohio broadcast markets. On 11 January 1954, a new The Wendy Barrie Show premiered from the studios of WHIO-TV in Dayton, simulcast on Taft Broadcasting's WKRC-TV in Cincinnati and WTVN-TV (now WSYX) in Columbus. Wendy Barrie's contract was terminated in October, 1954. Recognition After appearances in more than 15 films in Britain and more than 30 in Hollywood, Barrie's contribution to the industry was recognized with a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1708 Vine Street, near the corner of Hollywood and Vine. Her star was dedicated 8 February 1960. Personal Life and Death Barrie became a naturalized American citizen in 1942. She was reportedly engaged to and had a daughter named Carolyn with the infamous gangster Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel, and at one time married to textile manufacturer David L. Meyer. She died in Englewood, New Jersey, in 1978, aged 65, following a stroke that had left her debilitated for several years. She was buried in the Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.

Return Fire is a vehicular shooter from a 3D bird's eye view, in which the player's goal is to capture the enemy flag and return with it to their base. It was met with critical acclaim for its unusual gameplay concept, enjoyable multiplayer mode, and classical soundtrack, and is remembered as one of the 3DO's \\"best games\\" in its Home of the Underdogs entry. Gameplay Return Fire has four specialized vehicles, each one with unique abilities. Each vehicle can carry a limited amount of fuel and ammo (which can be refilled at ammo tents and fuel depots) and can withstand different amounts of damage. If a land vehicle runs out of fuel it stops and the driver jumps out and runs away. The tank has a 360¬∞ rotating turret and the ability to fire at land or air targets. The helicopter cannot resupply itself with fuel and ammunition unless it returns to base, but can strafe at an angle. The HRSV/M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System is the most armored vehicle, but the slowest moving. It has the ability to lay mines which can instantly destroy any land vehicle. The jeep/buggy is the fastest land vehicle and solely possesses the strategic ability to pick, move, and drop flags. Jeeps have the ability to over-inflate their tires and travel across deep water. They are the weakest vehicles, requiring only one hit to destroy. Only rotating missile turrets and drones are a regular threat to the player in the single player mode. If the player exceeds the boundaries of the map, a submarine emerges and fires a heat- seeking missile against the player.  Production  = Audio = The game soundtrack consists exclusively of public domain music such as Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries when using the helicopter (in homage to Apocalypse Now), Flight of the Bumblebee when driving the jeep, Holst's Mars from The Planets when driving the tank or the William Tell Overture by Gioacchino Rossini when riding with the flag. When driving in the Armored Support Vehicle, Edvard Grieg's In the Hall of the Mountain King plays. During the opening title screen Verdi's \\"Dies Irae\\" plays as the \\"Return Fire\\" logo appears, engulfed in flame. At the completion of each level, a sequence of unrelated vintage black and white short clips greets the player. = Video sequences = When a level is completed in the PC or PlayStation version a short video clip is shown. One of these is a clip featuring Lou Gehrig's famous Luckiest Man on the Face of the Earth speech.  Release  A version for the Sega Saturn was developed and completed but never released, until a complete build of the port was leaked online in 2007. Reviews for the Saturn version were published shortly before its targeted release date of May 1997; most reviewers described it as an unacceptably poor conversion of an outstanding game, suffering from a much lower frame rate than the 3DO and PlayStation versions. Another version of the game was also in development by Alexandria Inc. for the Atari Jaguar CD, but development on the port was terminated sometime in 1995 and it was never released for unknown reasons. The PlayStation release of Return Fire was the final game release by Time Warner Interactive before it was absorbed into Williams Entertainment (later became Midway Home Entertainment) by its new owners WMS Industries. Reception GamePro gave the 3DO version a positive review, describing it as \\"a combination of the best parts of playing Capture the flag, Desert Strike, and Micro Machines.\\" The reviewer complimented the easy-to-master controls, the graphics, and the strong sense of humor. The review team of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it their \\"Game of the Month\\" award, applauding the two-player mode, classical soundtrack, graphics, and general fun of the game. Ed Semrad summarized that \\"In an industry flooded with sports and fighting carts, this comes as a breath of fresh air.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation also praised the classical soundtrack and the two-player mode, though he added that with its huge number of levels, the game is great fun to play even in single-player mode. He further stated that the graphics and sound effects make causing destruction in the game more fun. A different reviewer for GamePro covered the PlayStation version, calling it \\"a brilliantly conceived thrill-a-minute war sim\\" and \\"an unprecedented blend of action and strategy\\". He cited the easy- to-learn controls and game mechanics, frenzied and enduring multiplayer action, and high level of visual detail. He made special note of the game's classical soundtrack, saying that \\"Never before has sound been so instrumental to a game's success\\". Next Generation described it as a near-identical conversion of the 3DO game, and offered it similar praises. The Return Fire: Maps O' Death expansion pack was also well received. Maximum gave it 4 out of 5 stars, saying that for an exceptionally low price tag, the player is treated to \\"horribly difficult theatres of war with less vehicles available and some decidedly odd scenery (such as the chessboard and SOS levels), all of which makes the Return Fire sequel an excellent 3DO addition.\\" GamePro stated that it \\"breathes new life into the year-old game, offering more than 100 fresh levels filled with the carnage and insanity Fire fans love.\\" In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked the 3DO version number 63 on their \\"100 Best Games of All Time\\", citing its high replayability and the way it \\"capture[s] the frenetic feeling of combat\\" to an extent that few games do. They said they chose the 3DO version specifically because the gameplay was tighter than that of the PlayStation version and unreleased Saturn version. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible.

However, the New Book of Tang also indicated that he was in his 70s when he was summoned to the capital in 689 which, if true, would make him born in the 610s. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 91 and New Book of Tang, vol. 120.-706), courtesy name Mengjiang (Â≠üÂ∞á), formally Prince Wenzhen of Hanyang (Êº¢ÈôΩÊñáË≤ûÁéã),Historical accounts about Zhang and his fellow coup leaders generally referred to them as the \\"five princes,\\" and, as their titles were restored after Emperor Ruizong's ascension, they were generally considered to have been restored to their princely ranks, although Zhang's biography in the Old Book of Tang quoted an edict of Emperor Ruizong's honoring him as the Duke of Hanyang, and therefore it is not completely clear whether Zhang Jianzhi, posthumously, was formally referred to as a duke or a prince. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 91. was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty and Wu Zetian's Zhou Dynasty, serving as chancellor during the reigns of Wu Zetian and her son Emperor Zhongzong. He was a key figure in the coup that overthrew Wu Zetian and restored Emperor Zhongzong in 705, but was later exiled due to false accusations instigated by Wu Zetian's nephew Wu Sansi and died in exile.  Background  Zhang Jianzhi was born in 625, during the reign of Emperor Gaozu. His family was from Xiang Prefecture (Ë•ÑÂ∑û, roughly modern Xiangfan, Hubei). In his youth, he was a student at the imperial university, and he was said to have a broad study in the Confucian classics and history, but particularly favored studying the Three Rites (i.e., the Classic of Rites, the Rites of Zhou, and the Yili \\"Etiquette and Rites\\"). He was respected by the principal of the imperial university Linghu Defen. After he passed the imperial examinations, he was made the magistrate of Qingcheng County (ÈùíÂüé, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). However, little further is known about his career until 689, other than that in or before 676, he was serving as the cashier for Li Sujie the Prince of Xun, a son of Emperor Gaozong (Emperor Taizong's son) and Emperor Gaozong's concubine Consort Xiao, who was killed in 655 due to machinations by Emperor Gaozong's second wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian). Li Sujie, denied the privilege of seeing his father after his mother's death, had written an essay entitled Commentary on Faithfulness and Filial Piety (), and Zhang secretly submitted the essay to Emperor Gaozong. After Empress Wu read it, it drew her ire, and she falsely accused Li Sujie of corruption and had him demoted and put under house arrest. In 689, by which time Empress Wu was serving as empress dowager and regent over her son Emperor Ruizong, she held a competition for scholars willing to offer suggestions for the imperial administration. Zhang participated in the competition and was ranked first among the thousands of contestants. She promoted him to be an imperial censor.  During Wu Zetian's reign  Early in Wu Zetian's Shengli era (697-700) (when she was ruling as Empress Regnant of a new Zhou Dynasty, interrupting Tang Dynasty), Zhang Jianzhi was promoted to be Fengge Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (È≥≥Èñ£, Fengge). Around that time, he had a debate with the imperial scholar Wang Yuangan () over whether the traditional three-year mourning period for a parent's death should be three full years (as Wang advocated) or 25 months‚Äîi.e., two full calendar years, extending into the first month of the next year (as Zhang advocated). The people at the time were said to be largely approving Zhang's interpretation. In 698, Wu Zetian was set to enter into a marriage treaty with Ashina Mochuo, the khan of Eastern Tujue, where her grandnephew Wu Yanxiu () the Prince of Huaiyang would marry a daughter of Ashina Mochuo. Zhang opposed, stating, \\"In ancient times, no Chinese imperial prince had ever married a barbarian woman as his wife.\\" This opposition drew displeasure from Wu Zetian, as she wanted peace with Eastern Tujue, and she demoted Zhang to be the prefect of He Prefecture (ÂêàÂ∑û, modern northern Chongqing). (However, the marriage treaty would be doomed, as Ashina Mochuo, not actually having any intent to give a daughter to Wu Yanxiu or to make peace with Wu Zetian, used the excuse that he had intended to marry his daughter to a prince of the Tang imperial Li clan to instead detain Wu Yanxiu and launch a major attack on Zhou.) Later that year, Zhang was serving as the prefect of Shu Prefecture (ËúÄÂ∑û, in modern Chengdu), when he made the suggestion that Shu Prefecture, which was required to send 500 conscript soldiers to take up garrison at Yao Prefecture (ÂßöÂ∑û, roughly modern Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan), no longer be required to do so, as the road was treacherous and the conditions were so severe that many would die‚Äîand further that no garrison be put up at Yao Prefecture at all, treating it as vassal territory rather than part of Zhou proper. Wu Zetian did not accept his suggestion. At some time prior to 700, Zhang was serving as the secretary general of Jing Prefecture (ËçäÂ∑û, roughly modern Jingzhou, Hubei), when, on one occasion, Wu Zetian was having a conversation with the senior chancellor Di Renjie, asking Di's recommendation for someone with extraordinary talent, to serve as chancellor or general. Di responded, \\"As far as literary talent is concerned, Your Imperial Majesty already have them in Su Weidao and Li Jiao [Di's fellow chancellors], but if you truly want extraordinary talent, I know Zhang Jianzhi, the secretary general of Jing Prefecture. Even though he is old, he is capable of being chancellor.\\" In response, Wu Zetian promoted Zhang to be the military advisor to the prefect of the capital prefecture Luo Prefecture (Ê¥õÂ∑û, roughly modern Luoyang, Henan), sending Yang Yuanyan () to replace him. (When Yang reached Jing Prefecture, Zhang and Yang rowed a boat on the Yangtze River together, and they secretly discussed Wu Zetian's overthrow of Tang Dynasty. During the conversation, Yang expressed sentiment that he wanted to see Tang's restoration‚Äîa sentiment that Zhang kept in his mind for later.) A few days after Zhang's promotion, Wu Zetian was again asking Di for a recommendation, and Di responded, \\"I had just recommended Zhang Jianzhi, and Your Imperial Majesty has not yet promoted him.\\" She responded, \\"I already did.\\" Di responded, \\"I recommended a chancellor, not a military advisor.\\" Wu Zetian then, while not promoting Zhang to be chancellor at that time, promoted him to be the deputy minister of justice (ÁßãÂÆò‰æçÈÉé, Qiuguan Shilang). In 704, as the chancellor Yao Yuanzhi was set to briefly leave Luoyang to serve as the commander of the forces in the Lingwu region, Wu Zetian also asked him to recommend a talented official. Yao responded, \\"Zhang Jianzhi is deep-thinking and capable of ruling on great things. He is already old. Please promote him quickly.\\" Wu Zetian therefore gave Zhang the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto at the age of 79. In spring 705, with Wu Zetian being ill, Zhang entered into a plot with a number of officials and generals, including Cui Xuanwei, Huan Yanfan, Jing Hui, and Yuan Shuji, to kill Wu Zetian's lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, who had become powerful much to the distaste of the chancellors. Zhang reminded Yang of his prior desire to restore Tang, and put him, Huan, Jing, and a general who agreed to the plot, Li Dan (), in charge of some of the corps of the imperial guards. He further persuaded the ethnically Mohe general Li Duozuo to join the plot as well, persuading Li Duozuo, who felt indebted to Emperor Gaozong for having promoted him, that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were endangering the positions of Emperor Gaozong's sons with Wu Zetian, Li Xian the Crown Prince and Li Dan the Prince of Xiang (note different character than the general). He also received agreement from Yao. With agreement from Li Xian as well, the coup leaders acted on February 20,ÂÖ©ÂçÉÂπ¥‰∏≠Ë•øÊõÜËΩâÊèõ killing Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, and then surrounding Wu Zetian. She, in fear, asked, \\"Who is disturbing me?\\" Zhang Jianzhi responded, in a formalistic manner: Wu Zetian subsequently tried to have Li Xian returned to the palace of the Crown Prince, but the coup leaders ignored her. While the coup leaders allowed Wu Zetian to retain the title of \\"emperor,\\" they had her put under house arrest at the secondary palace Shangyang Palace () and forced her to yield the throne to Li Xian, who was formerly emperor, and he was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong).  During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign  Zhang Jianzhi, along with Cui Xuanwei, Huan Yanfan, Jing Hui, and Yuan Shuji, were recognized as leaders in Emperor Zhongzong's restoration, and they were put into key positions and created dukes, with Zhang becoming the minister of defense (Â§èÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Xiaguan Shangshu)Zhang's biographies in the Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang both indicated that he was made the minister of civil service affairs (Â§©ÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Tianguan Shangshu), but the chronicle of the second reign of Emperor Zhongzong in the Old Book of Tang indicated that he was made the minister of defense, and the Zizhi Tongjian followed that account. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 91 and New Book of Tang, vol. 120 with Old Book of Tang, vol. 7 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 207. and remaining chancellor with the Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi designation, and carrying the title of Duke of Hanyang. He and the other coup leaders instituted a regime of restoring Tang institutions and deprecating Zhou ones, and when Yao Yuanzhi displayed distress at Wu Zetian's removal to Shangyang Palace, Zhang and Huan had him demoted out of the capital. Soon, however, Emperor Zhongzong became full heavily influenced by his wife Empress Wei and her lover Wu Sansi the Prince of Liang (Wu Zetian's nephew and Emperor Zhongzong's cousin). (One of the coup participants, Xue Jichang (), had advocated to Zhang Jianzhi and Jing the killing of Wu Sansi in the aftermaths of the killing of Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, but neither Zhang Jianzhi nor Jing paid Xue's suggestion much heed until it was too late.) After realizing that Wu Sansi's power was on the rise, Zhang Jianzhi tried to persuade Emperor Zhongzong to reduce the power of the Wu clan on the whole, but was unable to get Emperor Zhongzong to listen. Meanwhile, Zhang Jianzhi was made Zhongshu Ling (), the head of the legislative bureau (now returned to the prior name of Zhongshu Sheng (). In summer 705, Under the full influence of his wife Empress Wei, by which time Emperor Zhongzong's trust in Zhang and his colleagues had completely been lost, Emperor Zhongzong, following Wu Sansi's recommendation, created the five coup leaders princes‚Äîin Zhang's case, Prince of Hanyang‚Äîbut stripped them of chancellor positions. Zhang soon requested to retire back to his home prefecture Xiang Prefecture, and Emperor Zhongzong agreed, making him the prefect of Xiang Prefecture, but not putting him in actual responsibility of the prefecture. His son Zhang Yi () was made a low level imperial official but ordered to follow his father to Xiang Prefecture. In spring 706, with all five of the coup leaders already out of the capital, Wu Sansi and Empress Wei made accusations against them, and they were demoted to more remote prefectures (although Zhang was not moved). Wu Sansi then had his strategist Zheng Yin further accuse the five of them of having participated in the plot of Emperor Zhongzong's son-in-law Wang Tongjiao () -- who was executed early in 706 after having been accused of plotting to kill Wu Sansi and deposing Empress Wei. The five were further demoted with the provisions that they would never be allowed to return to the capital Chang'an, with Zhang becoming the military advisor to the prefect of Xin Prefecture (Êñ∞Â∑û, roughly modern Yunfu, Guangdong). Wu Sansi then had accusations that Empress Wei was having affairs posted publicly in Luoyang (now eastern capital, with the capital moved back to Chang'an), with the intent of incensing Emperor Zhongzong‚Äîand then accused the five coup leaders of being behind this public humiliation. He then had his associates propose that the five be killed. Emperor Zhongzong, citing that the five had been previously awarded iron certificates that guaranteed that they would not be executed in recognition of their contribution, ordered that they be reduced to commoner rank and permanently exiled to the Lingnan region with their families‚Äîin Zhang's case, to Long Prefecture (ÁÄßÂ∑û, in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi). At the suggestion of Cui Shi, Wu Sansi then sent the censor Zhou Lizhen () to the Lingnan region under guise of reviewing the affairs of the region but with instructions to kill the five. By the time that Zhou reached the region, though, Zhang had already died. After Emperor Zhongzong's death in 710 and Li Dan, himself a former emperor, was restored (as Emperor Ruizong), Zhang and his colleagues were posthumously honored.

His book Risk is an analysis of how humans assess and respond to perceived risks. Areas of interest =Risk compensation= Adams is known for a theory of risk compensation, that states that a 'risk thermostat' guides much human behavior. Humans experiencing a 'safe' lifestyle seek out risky activities; but when doing them, overcompensate before returning to safety. This behaviour operates like a thermostat, regulating human behavior. He argues that because of the thermostat effect, banning risky activity will not work completely, and risk -seeking accompanies many aspects of everyday life. He spoke on this at the Shared Space conference held in Ipswich in June, 2005, where in his talk titled \\"Risk Compensation versus the obedient automaton theory of human behaviour\\" he discussed how understanding risk compensation was essential to the understanding of why shared space principles work for the design of public spaces such as road layouts in towns. =Hypermobility= He has also coined the term and written extensively on the phenomenon of hypermobility, particular the misplaced belief that new road building solves traffic problems, rather than worsening them. =Climate change= Adams has not always voiced mainstream views on climate change.

They are primarily distinguished by their size, carrying a larger cross-section of water than most water-supply aqueducts. Although Roman aqueducts were sometimes used for transport, aqueducts were not generally used until the 17th century when the problems of summit level canals had been solved and modern canal systems were developed. The long steel Briare aqueduct carrying the Canal lat√©ral √† la Loire over the River Loire was built in 1896. It was ranked as the longest navigable aqueduct in the world for more than a century, until the Magdeburg Water Bridge in Germany took the title in the early 21st century. Early aqueducts such as the three on the Canal du Midi had stone or brick arches, the longest span being on the Cesse Aqueduct, built in 1690. But, the weight of the construction to support the trough with the clay or other lining to make it waterproof made these structures clumsy. In 1796 Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct, the first large cast iron aqueduct was built by Thomas Telford at Longdon-on-Tern on the Shrewsbury Canal. It has a total length of across three intermediate piers. Within ten years Telford had completed the far more ambitious Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in Wales on the Llangollen Canal over the River Dee valley, with a total length 307 metres. Other cast-iron aqueducts followed, such as the single-span Stanley Ferry Aqueduct on the Calder and Hebble Navigation in 1839, with its innovative through arch design. Notable navigable aqueducts Out-of-use cast-iron Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct * Benjamin Outram's single-span Holmes Aqueduct on the Derby Canal in Derby was the world's first navigable cast iron aqueduct, narrowly pre-dating Thomas Telford's Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct on the Shrewsbury Canal, sometimes described as the world's first large-scale navigable cast iron aqueduct. The oldest currently navigable cast-iron aqueduct is Outram's Stakes Aqueduct on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal at Stalybridge, built c1801 to replace an original, stone-built, four arch structure, which had been swept away in the floods of August 1799. * Pontcysyllte Aqueduct () carries the Llangollen Canal over the River Dee valley in north Wales; it was designed by Thomas Telford and opened in 1805. The same canal, which includes a tunnelled section, crosses a second valley on the Chirk Aqueduct (1796‚Äì1801). This navigable canal also supplies water to the former borough of Crewe and Nantwich. * The Union Canal in Scotland has many aqueducts, including the Slateford Aqueduct that takes the canal over the Water of Leith, the Almond Aqueduct over the River Almond at Ratho, and the very impressive Avon Aqueduct over the River Avon. The Avon is the second- longest aqueduct in the United Kingdom (). * The Agen aqueduct (1849) in France is long and carries the canal de Garonne across the Garonne River. *Sir Arthur Cotton planned the aqueduct at P. Gannavaram to cater for the needs of farmers in the Konaseema area while he was constructing the Dowleswaram barrage. Originally a non-navigable aqueduct first constructed in 1859 with a length of . In 2000, a new navigable aqueduct and road bridge was constructed across the River Vynateya (a tributary of the Godavari River) near Gannavaram, to facilitate the crossing of the Gannavaram Canal and also to irrigate a farming land. *The Briare aqueduct (1896) near Ch√¢tillon-sur-Loire, France, carries the Canal lat√©ral √† la Loire in a steel channel over the Loire River. At , it was the longest canal aqueduct in the world for a century. * In recent years the building of the Lichfield Canal Aqueduct ran into construction difficulties.

The concept is that GUI widgets can send signals containing event information which can be received by other widgets / controls using special functions known as slots. This is similar to C/C++ function pointers, but signal/slot system ensures the type-correctness of callback arguments. The signal/slot system fits well with the way graphical user interfaces are designed. Similarly, the signal/slot system can be used for other non-GUI usages, for example asynchronous I/O (including sockets, pipes, serial devices, etc.) event notification or to associate timeout events with appropriate object instances and methods or functions. It is easy to use and no registration/deregistration/invocation code need to be written, because Qt's metaobject compiler (MOC) automatically generates the needed infrastructure. A commonly used metaphor is a spreadsheet. A spreadsheet has cells that observe the source cell(s). When the source cell is changed, the dependent cells are updated from the event. Alternative implementations There are some implementations of signal/slot systems based on C++ templates, which don't require the extra metaobject compiler, as used by Qt, such as libsigc++, sigslot, vdk-signals, nano-signal-slot, neosigslot, Signals, boost.signals2, Synapse, Cpp::Events, Platinum and JBroadcaster. Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) languages such as C# also supports a similar construct although with a different terminology and syntax: events play the role of signals, and delegates are the slots. Another implementation of signals exists for ActionScript 3.0, inspired by C# events and signals/slots in Qt. Additionally, a delegate can be a local variable, much like a function pointer, while a slot in Qt must be a class member declared as such. The C based GObject system also provides similar functionality via GSignal. In D it is implemented by std.signals.

The game was released in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance handheld game system. \\"Guru Logi\\" is an abbreviation of \\"Guruguru Logic\\", \\"guruguru\\" („Åê„Çã„Åê„Çã) being a Japanese onomatopoeia for a rotating motion. The game's story mode sees the Champs, small yellow bird-like creatures who attempt to help the inhabitants of their neighbourhood out of various troubles. To do so, they must complete a series of logic puzzles. There are a total of 335 puzzles in the game, and if they are all completed a totally different mini-game is unlocked. Each stage requires the player to complete an image by placing and removing blocks on the board. The puzzles are set up so that there is no simple solution; often the player is blocked by other immovable areas and so must improvise a solution by constantly constructing and deconstructing their own barriers. The board itself may be rotated so that the player can construct the solution from all four sides. An additional Battle Mode exists in which two players must race to finish puzzles in the fastest time. Battle mode requires a Game Link Cable and only one game pak cartridge. The game itself is best compared to Picross and Magical Drop. Similar to Picross, a board consisting of a set of blocks creates an image. Similar to Magical Drop, gameplay involves throwing blocks vertically into the play area and sucking them back off again. There are a number of unofficial remakes of the game: * A port to the MSX2 is currently under development by TNI. * An English 80-level remake available for the PC. This is still a work in progress and has no sound. * There are also completed freeware remakes for the GP2X Wiz and GPH Caanoo by the same programmer (Ian Price) as the PC remake According to late-2001 GameSpot ads, the game was scheduled to be released in the United States on December 22, 2001, but this was scrapped due to a poor Japanese-to-English translation. In various screenshots of a Beta for the English-language \\"Guru Logic Champ\\" (the official North American title), many language errors are present.  Snapdots  A reworking of the game concept was released by D4 Enterprise for DSiWare under the name , known as Snapdots outside Japan. It was released on December 2, 2009 in Japan and October 18, 2010 in North America. New to Snapdots is the presence of a human-like alien character named Dotty, who acts as your guide during the tutorial and provides commentary on each puzzle that you solve. In addition, the game now displays the number of moves it took you to solve each puzzle along with the time, and it also features a Time Attack mode in which players are tasked with solving as many puzzles as they can, chosen randomly, in a specific time frame. The basic rules and gameplay mechanics remain unchanged from Guru Logi Champ, however, and many of the puzzles in Snapdots were identical to puzzles found in the previous game.  Clones  PopCap released a web game called Pixelus (and the downloadable version Pixelus Deluxe) that featured the same gameplay mechanics as Guru Logi Champ, but dressed up in an Ancient Roman graphical theme.

Just outside the municipal limits of Colombo, in the city of Kelaniya, the university has two major campuses, seven locations, six faculties and four institutions. History The University of Kelaniya has its origin in the historic Vidyalankara Pirivena, founded in 1875 by Ratmalane Sri Dharmaloka Thera as a centre of learning for Buddhist monks. With the establishment of modern universities in Sri Lanka in the 1940s and 1950s, the Vidyalankara Pirivena became the Vidyalankara University in 1959, later the Vidyalankara Campus of the University of Ceylon in 1972, and, ultimately, the University of Kelaniya in 1978. The University of Kelaniya has pioneered a number of new developments in higher education. It was one of the first universities to begin teaching science in Sinhala and the first to restructure the traditional Arts Faculty into three faculties: Humanities, Social Sciences, and Commerce and Management. It has several departments not generally found in the Sri Lankan University system and some Kelaniya innovations have been adopted subsequently by other universities. These include the Departments of Industrial Management and Microbiology in the Faculty of Science; Departments of Linguistics, Fine Arts, Modern Languages and Hindi in the Faculty of Humanities; and Mass Communication and Library and Information Sciences in the Faculty of Social Sciences. Symbols =Coat of arms= The coat of arms of the University of Kelaniya is circular and consists of three concentric bands, the outermost of which contains the name of the University in Sinhala and English. The motto of the institution, \\"Pannaya Parisujjhati\\" (\\"Self- purification is by insight\\"), is a quotation from the Alavaka-sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya, given in Sinhala characters in the same band. The middle band containing a creeper design encloses the innermost, which shows a full-blown lotus, signifying purity. These two designs are reminiscent of those occurring in the well-known moonstones at Anuradhapura. University of Kelaniya.  Faculties  = Faculty of Science = The Faculty of Science started functioning in October 1967 with Prof. Charles Dahanayake as the Dean of Science. The intake of the first batch of students was 57. Formal approval for the Faculty was given by the Minister of Education in 1968. The faculty was housed in the main building known as the \\"Science Block\\". Due to the continued increase in the student intake from year to year, a new lecture theatre complex and an auditorium were constructed in 1992, which enabled the intake of students to be increased to 450 in 2003. A new laboratory complex for the Chemistry Department and three buildings for the Departments for Industrial Management, Microbiology and Zoology have now been completed. The faculty was the first among the Sri Lankan universities to initiate the changeover from the traditional three subject (General) degree with end of year examinations to a more flexible course unit system, i.e., a modularized credit-based system in a two-semester academic year with the end of semester examinations. It offers a variety of course pathways designed to provide flexibility in the choice of subjects. Under this system students have the option of reading for a traditional three subject degree or for a degree consisting of two principal subjects and a selection of course units drawn from other subject areas. The BSc (Special) degree courses, begun in 1974, adopted the course unit system in 1986. Faculty of Science The faculty consists of eight departments. * Department of Botany * Department of Chemistry * Department of Industrial Management * Department of Mathematics * Department of Microbiology * Department of Physics * Department of Statistics & Computer Science * Department of Zoology & Environmental Management = Faculty of Medicine= The Faculty of Medicine of the University of Kelaniya is on a campus at Ragama. It is one of eight medical schools in Sri Lanka. The faculty began classes with the admission of 120 students in September 1991 after the government, in 1989, nationalised the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC), the first privately funded medical school in Sri Lanka established in 1980. The first batch of students, of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya completed their five-year course and graduated MBBS in September 1996. Prof. Carlo Fonseka was the first dean of the faculty. Subsequent deans were Prof. Janaka de Silva, Prof. Rajitha Wickremasinghe and Prof. Nilanthi de Silva. The current dean is Prof. Prasantha S. Wijesinghe . The faculty now has over 1,000 medical students. This number includes international students, mainly from other South Asian countries, who have been admitted on a fee- levying basis. The faculty also welcomes students for elective appointments. Students from medical schools in Europe, USA and Australia have spent their elective periods with the university. In addition to the MBBS course, it conducts a BSc programme in speech and hearing sciences. There is a permanent academic staff of over 120 and in addition 40 temporary academic staff and over 60 visiting staff that includes consultants who are based in the affiliated teaching hospitals. =Faculty of Social Science= The Faculty of Social Sciences, in student population, is the largest faculty in the University of Kelaniya. Department of Library and Information Science = Faculty of Humanities= The faculty includes disciplines associated with Buddhist and Asian cultures, such as Pali and Buddhist Studies, Sinhala, Tamil, Sanskrit, Hindi, Japanese and Chinese, while teaching courses in modern European languages such as English, French, German and Russian. = Faculty of Commerce and Management= The faculty consists of four departments: * Department of Commerce * Department of Accountancy * Department of Marketing Management * Department of Human Resource Management * Department of Finance Department of commerce was the first to be established and contribute graduates to industry. BCOM degree is unique to Department of Commerce. Department provides special degree in Financial Management(BCOM (special) Degree in Financial management), Business technology(BCOM (special) Degree in Business Technology), Entrepreneurship(BCOM (special) Degree in Entrepreneurship) and Commerce(BCOM (special) Degree in Commerce). = Faculty of Computing and Technology= University of Kelaniya established its 7th Faculty - the Faculty of Computing and Technology (FCT) on 30 December 2015 and the Faculty commenced its operations on 18 January 2016.

Felicity Kendal originated the role of Flora, originally in the radio play and then on stage, which Irish actress Niamh Cusack played in London's Aldwych Theatre in the West End. Synopsis In 1930, the year of Gandhi's Salt March, British poet Flora Crewe travels to India for her health. Flora is a thoroughly modern girl who has modeled for Modigliani, hobnobbed with communists, and been accused of obscenity for the racy book A Nymph and Her Muse. In India her portrait is painted by the Indian artist Nirad while she fends off the attentions of a dashing but dimwitted scion of the British Raj. But her bravado hides the knowledge that she is severely ill with tuberculosis. In the 1980s, American academic Eldon Pike seeks out Flora's younger sister Eleanor to discover the truth about the end of the poet's life ‚Äî she died in India soon after meeting Nirad. Eleanor, who married an Englishman she met at Flora's grave and became a staunch Conservative, reveals little to the scholar, sending him off on a wild goose chase tracing Flora's path through India. But she is more welcoming to Nirad's son Anish, who also comes looking for answers. Eleanor shows Anish a painting by Nirad done partly in a classical Indian style, and partly in the style of Western realism. The painting's erotic symbolism convinces him that his father and Flora were lovers before she died. Themes Among the play's themes is the contrast of Indian and European styles of poetry and visual art. Nirad explains to Flora the classical Indian theory of nine rasas, which are tonal schemes uniting all forms of art. Each rasa is associated with a colour, a mood, and a musical scale. The play's title refers to Shringara, the rasa of erotic love, which is associated with an inky blue-black colour and the god Krishna, who is always painted with dusky blue skin. Flora is at first puzzled by this artistic tradition, but on falling in love with Nirad she realizes, \\"It is the colour he looked by moonlight.\\" The play shares with other Stoppard plays of the 90s the theme of nostalgia and romantic loss, with Flora as the lost beloved corresponding to Thomasina in Arcadia and Moses in The Invention of Love. And like those two plays, it cuts back and forth between characters in two time periods sharing the same set. Stoppard has given director Peter Wood partial credit for developing the structure of the play with its two intertwined storylines. Reception Ben Brantley expressed a lukewarm view of Indian Ink, deeming it \\"enticing if overpacked\\". He praised Stoppard's language and found the dialogue witty, but argued that the work contains an overabundance of characters and that \\"all the mini-history lessons and intellectual name- dropping in Indian Ink keep us from latching on emotionally to the play‚Äôs central relationships.\\" The Indian theater director Gopal Gandhi wrote a moderately positive review in The Independent. Gandhi argued that Das had mastery of English geography and literature but expositions of the rasa and Hindu scripture that seemed \\"to come not from Stoppard but some teach yourself guide\\", and wrote in response to this, \\"Indians have for decades, if not a century or two, been able to relate to things British without, in the least, compromising their brand of Indianess. They need no atavistic reversals into 'themselves'. What is Stoppard trying to do in Indian Ink?\\" However, Gandhi also felt that \\"there was [Stoppard]'s bitter-sweet topping to enjoy, for the sadness it evoked, for the regrets it reminded me of\\", and recommended the play overall. Matt Wolf of Variety criticized the play as \\"clunky\\" and \\"overwritten\\", and also stated that Flora Crewe is \\"crucially lacking in either a creative or erotic dimension, notwithstanding the fact that Flora‚Äôs principal topic seems to have been sex.\\" Jesse Green stated in Vulture that although the various elements and time periods don't satisfactorily emulsify, \\"there's no denying the astonishing craft of the individual scenes\\". Green referred to the play as \\"second-tier Tom Stoppard but excellent by almost any other standard\\".

Their traditional territory spread from Wollombi in the south, to the Lower Hunter River near Newcastle and Lake Macquarie in the north. The name Kuringgai, also written Guringai, has often been used as a collective denominator of the Awabakal and several other tribes in this belt, but Norman Tindale has challenged it as an arbitrary coinage devised by ethnologist John Fraser in 1892. For Tindale, Kuringgai was synonymous with Awabakal. Arthur Capell however asserted that there was indeed evidence for a distinct Kuringgai language, which, in Tindale's schema, would imply they were a distinct people from the Awabakal. Name In their language, awaba was the word for Lake Macquarie, meaning flat or plain surface, and by extension referred to the people native to that area. The Awabakal were bounded to the north‚Äìwest by the Wonnarua, the Worimi to the north‚Äìeast, and the Darkinung peoples to the west and south. Awaba is now the name of a small town in the region. Language Traditional lands of Australian Aboriginal tribes around Newcastle, New South Wales Awabakal language was recorded by Lancelot Edward Threlkeld and Awabakal Leader Birabahn in 'An Australian grammar : comprehending the principles and natural rules of the language as spoken by the Aborigines in the vicinity of Hunter's River, Lake MacQuarie & New South Wales' -'and this is the first, and most comprehensive record of any indigenous language in Australia. Country Tindale estimated Awabakal territory to cover some . More recent estimates are that Awabakal territory covers 2870 square kilometres. Practices The eaglehawk or wedge-tailed eagle has special significance for the Awabakal people. Kon, their \\"celestial entity\\", looks like an Aboriginal man, but in flight resembles an eagle-hawk. The Awabakal people played a significant part in shaping the environment of their region. They practised fire-stick farming extensively, which helped them to hunt and to navigate through dense prickly scrub along the coast. Newcastle's main city thoroughfare, Watt Street was built over an Awabakal path from the shore to the top of a hill. Fishing, particularly for shellfish, was a significant part of the Awabakal people's diet and culture pre- colonisation. The Awabakal, in pre-colonisation times, were noted as being strong and determined defenders of their territory, the means by which the defence occurred need to be explored to deepen understanding of the culture. They had possession of their rich coastal territory for thousands of years, during which time they successfully repelled incursions by the neighbouring Gamilaraay people and established places of defence, \\"virtual armouries\\", high in the Watagan Mountains. =Today= Descendants of the traditional owners, that is, descendants of those Awabakal forebears who survived the British invasion/colonisation massacres, especially during the land grab of 1826, are direct descendants of Margaret and Ned or Mahrahkah. These descendants are connected through their families/family culture together and represented by the Awabakal Descendants of the Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation. These people, the traditional owners of the Awabakal region have lived on, loved and looked after the magnificent Awabakal land and water systems continuously for millennia, at least since the last Ice Age, 11,800 years ago. Their extraordinary resilience, is in part due to their excellence in civic relations, as demonstrated by their forebear, the most important Indigenous Intellectual of Australia in C19th, Birabahn and this is seen in their consideration of newly settled Aboriginal people on Awabakal lands and water places. Recently settled aboriginal people in this region partake in community support organisations like 'The Awabakal Newcastle Aboriginal Cooperative Limited', which is a not-for-profit community controlled organisation operating in the Newcastle, Lake Macquarie and Hunter Region. It was established in 1976. It is responsible for the delivery of community and health services to Aboriginal people in this region, including: * the Awabakal Medical Centre; * the Awabakal Disability Service which provides \\"short to medium term support to young people living with a disability\\"; * culturally appropriate care for older people; * and child care services. =Centres= The Awabakal Environmental Education Centre began operating in 1976. It is an NSW Department of Education and Communities facility. The centre provides opportunities for teachers and students in the Hunter Region to learn about the environment and human interactions with the natural world. Wollotuka, meaning an 'eating and meeting place' originally began as a support programme in 1983 to assist and promote university studies for indigenous people. Wollotuka's all indigenous staff moved into their new building, Birabahn in 2002, and the Wollotuka Institute was officially established in 2009. Native title In 2013 an association of Awabakal and Guringai descendants laid claim to native title over land from Maitland to Hornsby. The claim was opposed by representatives of the Worimi and Wonnarua as asserting rights over their own traditional territories. In 2017 the claim was withdrawn after the NSW government claimed that, while the claim group, the Descendants of the Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation had shown descent from the original people indigenous to the area, it was argued that they had failed to demonstrate continuous preservation of customary laws and practices since the onset of white colonization.

VanderLans studied at the Royal Academy of Art in the Hague and graduated in 1979. He worked as an apprentice designer at Total Design in Amsterdam, and as a junior designer at Form Vijf and Tel Design in The Hague. In 1983, he moved to California and studied photography at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1984, VanderLans, with his wife Zuzana Licko, founded Emigre graphics. From 1984 until 2005 VanderLans published, edited, and designed Emigre magazine, a quarterly publication devoted to visual communication. Shortly after Emigre magazine was launched, in 1984, the Macintosh computer was introduced. VanderLans, together with his wife Zuzana Licko, became early adopters to the new technology and they used the computer to experiment and created some of the very first digital layouts and typeface designs causing great consternation within the realm of graphic design. Eventually, exposure of the typefaces in Emigre magazine resulted in demand for the fonts which lead to the creation of the Emigre Type foundry. This growing library of digital typefaces, both experimental and traditional, is currently the principle activity and mainstay of Emigre. As a parallel interest to his design ventures, VanderLans has been photographing the California environment since he moved there from the Netherlands in 1981. He has authored a total of six photo books on the topic, and staged two solo exhibits at Gallery 16 in San Francisco.

The film is set during a civil war in the fourteenth century. Nobuko Otowa and Jitsuko Yoshimura play two women who kill soldiers to steal their possessions, and Kei Sat≈ç plays the man who ultimately comes between them. Plot The film is set somewhere in Japan, in the mid-fourteenth century during a period of civil war. Two fleeing soldiers are ambushed in a large field of tall, thick reeds and murdered by an older woman and her young daughter-in-law. The two women loot the dead soldiers, strip them of their armour and weapons, and drop the bodies in a deep pit hidden in the field. The next day, they take the armor and weapons to a merchant named Ushi and trade them for food. The merchant tells them news of the war, which is driving people across the country to desperation. As they leave, Ushi makes a sexual proposition to the older woman, who rebuffs him. A neighbor named Hachi, who has been at war, returns. The two women ask about Kishi, who was both the older woman‚Äôs son and younger woman‚Äôs husband and drafted along with Hachi. Hachi tells them that they deserted the war and that Kishi was later killed when they were caught stealing food from farmers. The older woman warns the younger woman to stay away from Hachi, whom she blames for her son's death. Hachi begins to show interest in the younger woman and, despite being warned to stay away from Hachi, she is seduced by him and sneaks out of her hut every night to have sex. The older woman learns of the relationship and is both angry and jealous. She tries to seduce Hachi herself, but is coldly rebuffed. She then pleads with him to not take the young woman away, since she cannot kill and rob passing soldiers without her help. One night, while Hachi and the younger woman are together, a lost samurai wearing an Hannya mask forces the older woman to guide him out of the field. He claims to wear the mask to protect his incredibly handsome face from harm. She tricks him into plunging to his death in the pit where the women dispose of their victims. She climbs down and steals the samurai's possessions and, with great difficulty, his mask, revealing the samurai's horribly disfigured face. As she leaves, the older woman then gets an idea to keep her daughter-in-law away from Hachi. At night, as the younger woman goes to see Hachi, the older woman blocks her path, wearing the samurai's robes and mask, frightening the woman into running home. During the day, the older woman further convinces the younger woman that the \\"demon\\" was real, as punishment for her affair with Hachi. The younger woman avoids Hachi during the day, but continues to try and see him at night. During a storm, the older woman again terrifies the younger woman with the mask, but Hachi, tired of being ignored, finds the younger woman and has sex with her in the grass as the devastated old woman watches from afar. Hachi returns to his hut, where he discovers another deserter stealing his food; the deserter abruptly grabs his spear and stabs Hachi, killing him. The older woman discovers that, after getting wet in the rain, the mask is impossible to remove. She reveals her scheme to the younger woman and pleads for her to help take off the mask. The younger woman agrees to remove the mask after the older woman promises not to interfere with her relationship with Hachi. After failing to pull it off, the young woman breaks off the mask with a hammer. Under the mask, the older woman's face is now disfigured, as the samurai's had been. The younger woman, thinking the older woman has turned into a demon, flees; the older woman runs after her, crying out that she is a human being, not a demon. The young woman leaps over the pit, and as the older woman leaps after her the film ends. Cast Most of the cast consisted of members of Shindo's regular group of performers, Nobuko Otowa, Kei Sat≈ç, Taiji Tonoyama, and J≈´kichi Uno. This was Jitsuko Yoshimura's only appearance in a Shindo film. The two women do not have names even in the script, but are merely described as \\"middle-aged woman\\" and \\"young woman\\". *Nobuko Otowa as Older Woman *Jitsuko Yoshimura as Younger Woman *Kei Sat≈ç as Hachi *Taiji Tonoyama as Ushi *J≈´kichi Uno as The Masked Warrior Production The story takes place shortly after the Battle of Minatogawa which began a period of over 50 years of civil war, the Nanboku-ch≈ç period (1336 to 1392). Hachi tells of an attack from general Takauji Ashikaga, who came to power in the 1330s. The story of Onibaba was inspired by the Shin Buddhist parable of yome-odoshi-no men (Â´Å„Åä„Å©„Åó„ÅÆÈù¢) (bride-scaring mask) or niku-zuki-no-men (ËÇâ‰ªò„Åç„ÅÆÈù¢) (mask with flesh attached), in which a mother used a mask to scare her daughter from going to the temple. She was punished by the mask sticking to her face, and when she begged to be allowed to remove it, she was able to take it off, but it took the flesh of her face with it. Kaneto Shindo wanted to film Onibaba in a field of susuki grass. He sent out assistant directors to find suitable locations. Once a location was found near a river bank at Inba-Numa in Chiba, they put up prefabricated buildings to live in. Filming started on 30 June 1964 and continued for three months. Shindo built things such as a makeshift turtle water slide to entertain the crew and keep things cool during harsh conditions of filming out in the fields of nowhere. The crew members were doing laundry and living in the fabricated buildings during the filming. The crew members grouping and eating together things like onigiri and soba noodles was caught on camera. They had a rule that if somebody left they would not get any pay, to keep the crew motivated to continue. Shindo included dramatized scenes of the dissatisfaction on the set as part of the 2000 film By Player. To film night scenes inside the huts, they would put up screens to block the sun, and changing the shot would require setting the screens in a completely different spot. Kaneto Shindo said that the effects of the mask on those who wear it are symbolic of the disfigurement of the victims of the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the film reflecting the traumatic effect of this visitation on post-war Japanese society. A makeshift tower where crew members could climb to look down and film using crane shots was built. The tower was tall enough to get a look around the entire field. The film contains some sequences filmed in slow motion.: a sudden slowing in the shot The scenes of the older woman descending in to the hole had to be shot using an artificial \\"hole\\" built above ground with scaffolding, since holes dug in the ground at the location site would immediately fill with water. =Score= Onibaba's score is by Shindo's long-term collaborator Hikaru Hayashi. The background and title music consists of Taiko drumming combined with jazz. Release Onibaba was released in Japan on November 21, 1964 where it was distributed by Toho. The film was released in the United States by Toho International with English subtitles on February 4, 1965. An English-dubbed version was produced by Toho, but any actual release of it is undetermined. On the films initial theatrical release in the United Kingdom, the film was first rejected by the BBFC on its first submission, and then released in a heavily edited form after its second submission.\\" =Home media= It was released as a Region 1 DVD on March 16, 2004 in the Criterion Collection. A Region 2 DVD was released in 2005 as part of the Masters of Cinema series. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Onibaba received an approval rating of 83% based on 12 reviews, and an average rating of 6.7/10. From contemporary reviews, the Monthly Film Bulletin noted that \\"Shindo obviously likes to milk his situations for all they are worth‚Äîand then some,\\" noting that \\"Onibaba has the same striking surface as [Ningen and The Naked Island],\\" and that the film \\"has the same tendency to fall apart if examined too closely.\\" The review praised Kuroda's \\"fine photography\\" but noted that nothing else \\"in the film quite matches this opening among the reeds, or its aftermath in the ruthless stripping of the victims and disposal of their corpses, except perhaps the encounter between the old woman and the General.\\" \\"Wear\\" of Variety described it as the \\"sexiest pic to be unveiled in New York so far,\\" noting that Nobuko Otowa is superb as the older woman while Jitsuko Yoshimura contribs an excellent characterization as the daughter-in-law.\\" The review declared it \\"sometimes high adventure and exciting, at other times dull in its so-called symbolism. Too often, this turns out to be a potpourri of ravenous eating and blatant sex.\\" A. H. Weiler of the New York Times described the film's raw qualities as \\"neither new nor especially inventive to achieve his stark, occasionally shocking effects. Although his artistic integrity remains untarnished, his driven rustic principals are exotic, sometimes grotesque figures out of medieval Japan, to whom a Westerner finds it hard to relate.\\" The review noted that Shindo's \\"symbolism, which undoubtedly is more of a treat to the Oriental than the Occidental eye and ear, may be oblique, but his approach to amour is direct... the tale is abetted by Hiyomi Kuroda's cloudy, low-key photography and Hikaru Kuroda's properly weird background musical score. But despite Mr. Shindo's obvious striving for elemental, timeless drama, it is simply sex that is the most impressive of the hungers depicted here.\\" Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian said \\"Onibaba is a chilling movie, a waking nightmare shot in icy monochrome, and filmed in a colossal and eerily beautiful wilderness.\\" Jonathan Rosenbaum of The Chicago Reader described it as \\"creepy, interesting, and visually striking.\\" Genre classification Many critics have been divided on the genre of the film. While Onibaba is regarded a \\"period drama\\" by David Robinson, or \\"stage drama\\" by Japanese film scholar Keiko I. McDonald,: Onibaba strikes us as kind of stage drama taking its cues from folklore Phil Hardy included it in his genre compendium as a horror film, and Chuck Stephens describes it as an erotic-horror classic. Writing for Sight & Sound, Michael Brooke noted that \\"Onibaba's lasting greatness and undimmed potency lie in the fact that it works both as an unnervingly blunt horror film (and how!) and as a far more nuanced but nonetheless universal social critique that can easily be applied to an parallel situation\\" Keiko I. McDonald stated that the film contained elements of the Noh theatre. She notes that the han'nya mask \\"is used to demonize the sinful emotions of jealousy and its associative emotions\\" in Noh plays, and that the differing camera angles at which the mask is filmed in Onibaba are similar to the way in which a Noh performer uses the angle of the mask to indicate emotions. Other reviewers also speculate about Noh influences on the film.: \\"Shindo's use of the hannya mask and reliance on heavy drumming punctuated by human cries for Onibaba's score [‚Ä¶] are direct quotations of Noh style.\\": \\"Die Filme [Onibaba and Kuroneku] folgen in ihrer Schauspielkunst, Erz√§hlstruktur und Inhalt den klassischen japanischen N√¥-St√ºcken.\\" (\\"These Films [Onibaba and Kuroneku] follow classic Japanese Noh Plays in the ways of acting, narrative structure and content.\\") References =Bibliography=  External links  Onibaba at the Japanese Movie Database Kei Sat≈ç's *Onibaba: Black Sun Rising an essay by Chuck Stephens at the Criterion Collection 1964 films 1964 horror films Japanese films Japanese drama films Japanese horror films Jidaigeki films Japanese black-and-white films Japanese-language films Japanese supernatural horror films Films set in the 14th century Films directed by Kaneto Shindo Films with screenplays by Kaneto Shindo 1960s historical horror films Period horror films ","title":"Onibaba (film)"},{"id":"2854850","text":"Doctor Who ‚Äì The Ultimate Adventure was a 1989 stage play written by Terrance Dicks, based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. The play was staged at twenty theatres around Britain, commencing 23 March 1989. It initially starred Jon Pertwee (who had played the Third Doctor in the series) as the Doctor. On 29 April Pertwee was ill, so understudy David Banks, who portrayed the Cyber Leader in the series from Earthshock onwards, played the Doctor for the matinee and evening performances. Pertwee continued in the role until 3 June and two days later Colin Baker, who had played the Sixth Doctor, took over the lead until the run ended on 19 August. The play was adjusted accordingly to conform with the Sixth Doctor's persona. Synopsis The story involves an alliance between the Daleks and the Cybermen who have joined forces to kidnap the American Envoy and ruin a peace conference on Earth. The Doctor's companion is a Frenchman named Jason. After failing to stop the Cybermen from taking the US Envoy from a nightclub, they are joined by a singer named Crystal, who works there. Following a trip to Altair Three and then the Bar Galactica, they meet Madame Delilah but are forced to flee along with a small furry creature called Zog. The time travellers are captured briefly by the Daleks and navigate their ship through an asteroid field before making a series of short trips, arriving finally to confront the Dalek Emperor. The Doctor tricks the Emperor into revealing that the Daleks intend to betray the Cybermen and a battle breaks out between the two. Returning to Earth, the Doctor realises the US Envoy is under Dalek influence and programmed to destroy London with a Dalekanium bomb. The Doctor breaks his conditioning and defuses the bomb by putting it in a teapot. The play featured a female Prime Minister named in the script 'Mrs. T' (a reference to Margaret Thatcher). The Third Doctor addresses her as Margaret in the play whilst the Sixth Doctor addresses her as Maggie. The Third Doctor also mentions Denis, a reference to Denis Thatcher, Margaret Thatcher's husband. The play also features some musical numbers, including two from Crystal and \\"Business is Business\\" from Madam Delilah, the title of which acted as a catchphrase running throughout the play.

The story also required a Dalek casing to be borrowed by one of the heroes to fool the Daleks, a ploy used in television stories The Daleks (1963) and Planet of the Daleks (1973). Other ties to the television series included a Draconian and a Vervoid which make cameo appearances as mercenaries in the Bar Galactica scenes. Five new Dalek props were built for the production. Specific design differences from the props used in the Doctor Who television series at the time included a more cylindrical shape and a single vertical column of hemispheres on the skirt side panels. They also had larger rectangular dome lights, no discs along the eye stalks and no shoulder slats as were present on post-1966 Daleks. The Dalek Emperor prop was a faithful reproduction of the model that appeared in The Evil of the Daleks (1967). The TARDIS set was also different, featuring roundels in a square rather than a hexagonal grid and a miniature console in which the central column was retracted completely out of view. The Cybermen costumes were identical to those used in Attack of the Cybermen (1985). When Colin Baker took over as the Doctor, he was provided with a redesigned version of his Sixth Doctor costume by the production crew. The new version incorporated shades of purple and blue, colours which could not have been used on TV due to interference with blue screen effects. The production used a large screen that displayed visual effect sequences and also incorporated lasers into the action. The screen showed such things as the TARDIS spinning through space and a meteor shower. The lasers were used to depict the effect of the Dalek guns, a force field and a time tunnel.

Montagne and Inskeep succeeded longtime host Bob Edwards, initially as interim replacements, and Greene joined the team in 2012. Montagne had served as a correspondent and occasional host since 1989. She usually broadcasts from NPR West in Culver City, California, a Los Angeles suburb. Early life Montagne was born in December 1948 in Oceanside, California, into a Marine Corps family. As is common in the lives of children of career military families, she moved often while growing up, including living in Hawaii and various places on the West Coast. An alumna of Cupertino High School, she was inducted into the school's Hall of Fame in 2012. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California, Berkeley in 1973 with a degree in English. Career Montagne got her start in radio as news director for KPOO community radio in San Francisco while attending UC-Berkeley. She also worked for Pacific News Service in San Francisco. From 1980 through 1986, she worked in New York City as a freelance reporter and producer for both NPR and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. During this period, she covered the arts and science for NPR. From 1987 to 1989, she was co-host with Robert Siegel of NPR's evening news magazine, All Things Considered. In 1990, Montagne covered the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in South Africa. She remained in South Africa for three years focusing on the area, where she won, along with the NPR reporting team, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award for their coverage of South Africa's first fully democratic elections. Montagne (far left) interviewing British Brigadier General David Paterson in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2010 In May 2004, Montagne and Steve Inskeep became interim co-hosts for NPR's Morning Edition, replacing long-time host Bob Edwards who was reassigned as a senior correspondent. They became permanent co-hosts in December 2004. The following year, Montagne went to Rome to cover the funeral of Pope John Paul II for NPR's Morning Edition. She also has traveled frequently to Afghanistan to report on the war that began in 2001. She has been recognized by the Overseas Press Club for her work from Afghanistan. In 2011, Montagne was among the news anchors who attended the traditional off- the-record luncheon with the U.S. president (in this case, Barack Obama) in advance of his State of the Union Address. The announcement went public on July 18, 2016 that Montagne would be leaving NPR's Morning Edition after co- hosting it with Steve Inskeep for 12 years. Her final Morning Edition as co- host was November 11, 2016. A month later, as Special Correspondent/Occasional Host for NPR News, Montagne embarked on a new project: an NPR/collaboration called Lost Mothers. Montagne, along with ProPublica reporting partner Nina Martin, spent the next year investigating why women are far more likely to die due to giving birth in the U.S. than all other developed nations. Their investigation focused on why the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. is going up while it‚Äôs going down in nearly every other nation; why African-American women are 3-to-4 times more likely to die than white women; and what‚Äôs being done to reverse these dire statistics. The series set off a national conversation at a time when few Americans knew that, in the U.S., even a healthy woman with a perfect pregnancy and good health care risks dying, or nearly dying, in childbirth. The stories, aired and published from 2017 through mid-2018, has been credited with inspiring laws in several states, as well as bills at the federal level aimed at protecting birthing mothers. In a 2018 Forbes op-ed arguing for a federal law to end America‚Äôs ‚Äúmaternal death epidemic,‚Äù Senator Tammy Duckworth cited the NPR/ProPublica investigation Lost Mothers. Duckworth also linked directly to Montagne‚Äôs NPR story on how California succeeded in cutting in half its maternal mortality rate. On 12/21/2018 HR 1318 ‚ÄúPreventing Maternal Deaths Act‚Äù was signed into law ‚Äì a law that incorporated the Senate bill Duckworth had championed in the op-ed.

Origin and career Dolfin Dolfin, was born into the powerful Dolfin family of Venice, one of the oldest and most recognized noble families of the Serenissima. From a young age, he followed the \\"cursus honorum\\" of young Venetian noblemen, training in the army, the naval fleet, the law, and affairs of State. When the time came, Dolfin began to serve the Venetian navy, which had the most powerful fleet of its day. His family had a long tradition in the Navy, reaching special notoriety when Giovanni Dolfin broke the Hungarian siege of Treviso in order to be crowned as Doge in 1356. In the 15th century, Venice controlled most of the Mediterranean, and had important interests in the rump Byzantine Empire. Therefore, when the Ottomans began their siege of the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, the Venetian fleet was immediately involved in its defence. During the siege, Dolfin was commanded to defend the north gate of the city walls, which he managed with great success. When Giacomo Coco, admiral of the Christian fleet died while trying to burn the Turkish fleet, Dolfin was put in charge of it. Dolfin Dolfin survived the fall of the city.

S.\\" Aubin (born July 19, 1977) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Pittsburgh Penguins, Toronto Maple Leafs and the Los Angeles Kings. Playing career Aubin was born in Montreal, Quebec. As a youth, he played in the 1990 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Mercier, Quebec. Aubin played his junior career in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, following in the footsteps of so many other Quebec-born goaltenders. He played for three different teams, spending the most time with the Sherbrooke Faucons. He was drafted in the third round of the 1995 NHL Entry Draft, 76th overall, by the Pittsburgh Penguins. His professional career began in the East Coast Hockey League, but he worked his way on to the Penguins' farm team, and then into the NHL itself. In the 1998‚Äì99 season, Aubin was recalled by the Penguins and made his NHL debut in a 5-0 defeat to the Tampa Bay Lightning on October 21, 1998. Two weeks later Aubin recorded his first career win on November 5, in a 4-2 victory over the Ottawa Senators.

She is best known for her feature film Sambizanga (1972) on the 1961‚Äì1974 war in Angola. Early life and education Born Sarah Durados in 1929 in Condom, Gers, the daughter of emigrants from Guadeloupe, she chose her artist's name in remembrance of Les Chants de Maldoror by Lautr√©amont. She attended a drama school in Paris. Together with her husband, Angolan nationalist M√°rio Pinto de Andrade, she received a scholarship and studied film with Mark Donskoi in Moscow in 1961‚Äì62 where she met Ousmane Semb√®ne. Career After her studies, Maldoror, worked as an assistant on Gillo Pontecorvo's acclaimed film, The Battle of Algiers (1966). She also worked as an assistant to Algerian director Ahmed Lallem. Maldoror's short film, Monangambee (1968), was set in Angola, based on a story by Angolan writer Jos√© Luandino Vieira. The title of this 17-minute film, Monangamb√©e, refers to the call used by Angolan anti-colonial activists to signal a village meeting. The film was shot with amateur actors in Algeria. It tells the story of a poor woman who visits her husband, who is imprisoned in the city of Luanda. The film was selected for the Director's Fortnight at Cannes in 1971, representing Angola. Her first feature film, Sambizanga (1972), was also based on a story by Vieira (A vida verdadeira de Domingos Xavier), and is set in 1961 at the onset of the Angolan War of Independence. Guardian film writer Mark Cousins included Sambizanga in a 2012 list of the ten best African films, calling it \\"as bold, as well-lit as Caravaggio paintings\\". Maldoror is one of the first women to direct a feature film in Africa; therefore, her work is often included in studies of the role of African women in African cinema. Maldoror died on 13 April 2020, at the age of 90, from COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in France.

While he wrote in English and Spanish, his published works in Cebuano language earned him the title, \\"Dean of Cebuano Writers.\\"  Early life  He was born in Barangay San Roque, Cebu City, Philippines on July 4, 1883. Little is known about his wife, although she was described to have the maiden surname of Calsas. Their family had 11 children namely Corazon, Filomena, Lourdes, Manuel, Marciano, Rosario, Socorro, Teresita, Uldarico Jr, Victor, and Virtud,. Starting his writing career at the age of 19, he wrote under the pseudonyms Artagnan, Alvi, Sikatuna, M. Anabell, and arguably, Felix Gerardo, author of Justicia Social. He witnessed firsthand the imperial conflicts, from Spanish colonization to the American occupation and then later to Japanese invasion, at an age old enough to understand what was going on.  Career  A Cebuano speaker educated in Spanish, Uldarico Alviola Sr. edited several bilingual publications (Spanish and Cebuano) such as El Nacionalista, El Precursor, and Respectador. He was also the editor of the Vicente Sotto-owned, periodical Ang Suga when it first saw print in 1901. Additionally, he was a pioneering and acclaimed novelist and fiction writer. He wrote Felicitas that was published in 1912. It was the second Cebuano novel, the first being Juan Villagonzalo's Walay Igsoon (Without a Brother). Critic Erlinda Alburo described the novel as a flat, poorly written novel; nonetheless, it exhibited elements of medieval mortality play. It was also characterized with a didactic tone. Additionally, his English works were also published in The Cebu Advertiser, Vicente Rama-owned periodical Progress, The Star, and the Philippine Free Press.  Political career  As a civil servant, Alviola worked as a municipal treasurer of the town of Oslob, Cebu. He also served in various capacities in the government including being the Secretary of the Provincial Council, Deputy Governor of Cebu, and Secretary of the then Municipality of Cebu, now the Cebu City Council.  Award  In 1962, he received the major lifetime award, the LUDABI award from Lubas sa Dagang Bisaya, a leading national organization for writers in Cebuano language, for his contributions to Cebuano culture. He died on April 29, 1966.  Historical commemoration  * A distinguished lexicographer, he is credited to have coined the words, \\"bugnong lugaynon\\" (electorate battle), a translation to the English word election, although other alternative, equally plausible etymologies exist. *The Alviola Street in Barangay Tinago is in his honor.

Early life Lord was born in the small town of Hartford, Vermont, the son of a Protestant clergyman. He was still an infant when his family moved to Meriden, Connecticut, where his father accepted the pastorship of a local church. As a boy, Lord spent his summers with relatives in Maine, and after completing high school he studied at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, before going to Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. While still in college he established myriad businesses, including a book-selling operation, a shoe repair service, and a taxi cab company. After graduation, the 22-year-old was hired as the principal at the high school in the small town of Plainville, Connecticut, reportedly the youngest person in the United States to ever hold such a position. He soon grew bored with the job and headed to New York City, where, after a series of jobs in publishing, he began writing scripts for radio. The Seth Parker years Lord was still in his twenties and living in New York City when he became a national radio personality. Creating the character \\"Seth Parker\\", a clergyman and backwoods philosopher based on his real-life grandfather, Hosea Phillips, Lord wrote stories for radio of rural New England humor that included the playing of old- time songs. On his own initiative, he communicated with several stations across the U.S. and sold them scripts he labeled as \\"Seth Parker's Singing School\\". An instant hit, Lord was soon contacted by NBC Radio, which contracted to buy scripts for a show to run six days a week that NBC called \\"Sunday Evening at Seth Parker's\\". Lord as Seth Parker in 1939 This was followed by other magazine publications that acquired his scripts, and before long Lord was earning close to $100,000 a year. Not limited in his scope, during this time he wrote other successful radio programs that were designed to conclude after a specific number of episodes were broadcast. Lord's growing popularity resulted in his publishing two books in 1930, titled Seth Parker's Album and Seth Parker's Hymnal, that led to the release of 78rpm gospel records by the \\"Phillips Lord Trio\\". Lord and the radio show gained a wide audience and the September 1931 issue of The American Magazine had a feature article on him under the heading: \\"At 29 He Has Made a Million Friends\\". In 1932, Lord published a book titled Seth Parker & His Jonesport Folks: Way Back Home from which he also wrote a stage play titled Seth Parker's Jonesport Folks; an entertainment in two acts. The book was published to coincide with the release of his 1932 motion picture produced by RKO Radio Pictures Inc., which used the shorter title from the book, Way Back Home. Starring opposite Bette Davis, Lord was billed as \\"Seth Parker, Preacher\\". Because the radio program was unknown in England, the motion picture was released there with the title Old Greatheart. In 1933, Lord came up with the idea of buying a sailing ship and broadcasting his show via short-wave radio while sailing to exotic places around the world with a team of celebrities. He purchased the 188-foot, 867-ton four-masted schooner Georgette, which he renamed Seth Parker. Its masts were 125 feet tall.Frigidaire Sales Corporation (1934). Aboard the Seth Parker. Dayton, OH: Frigidaire. Much promotional material was released in advance of the adventure, including that Mr. Eugene Nohl would be bringing the \\"Hell Below\\", a diving shell to be used for undersea exploration. Equipped with the necessary under-water photographic equipment donated by the Path√© film studios, the hype surrounding the voyage promised that Eugene Nohl would photograph \\"the sunken civilizations of the South Seas Islands, of its deep marine life and formations\\" and of course \\"search for sunken treasure and bring back film of shipwrecks\\". Sponsored by the Frigidaire appliance company, in December 1933 the schooner Seth Parker set sail for the South Pacific via the Panama Canal. Departing from Portland, Maine,\\"Frigidaire from Vessel 'Seth Parker': Weekly Sponsored Broadcasts to originate on Sea Voyage; Phillips Lord Going to Far Corners of Globe.\\" (November 15, 1934). Broadcasting with Broadcast Advertising, p.13. the ship docked at various ports along the eastern seaboard such as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Jacksonville, Florida, from where they broadcast their short-wave radio program that was retransmitted by NBC. For the listening public, this was a grand adventure by a group of wholesome Americans led by the creator of Rev. Seth Parker. However, the broadcasts revealed a bit of the frivolity behind the scenes of a voyage filled with wine, women and the kind of songs that were not found in any Seth Parker hymnal. In February 1935, disaster struck in the form of a tropical storm off the coast of American Samoa. The ship was severely damaged to the point where the expedition had to be abandoned, which spelled the end of the radio program. The ship's distress signal on February 11 was answered by , which was carrying the Duke of Gloucester home to the United Kingdom. With little visible damage, Lord declined the offer of support, only to summon back the Australia with another distress call early the next morning. In heavy seas, the Australia took on board nine of the schooner's crew. In response to speculation that the distress signals were a hoax, the Australian government confirmed in May that they were genuine and that no action would be taken against Lord. Despite everything, the shortened expedition proved immensely popular with the listening audience, and the Frigidaire company promoted a 32-page illustrated booklet called Aboard the Seth Parker to publicize the voyage and as an advertisement for Frigidaire equipment on the ship. The schooner was eventually sold and its new owner managed to sail it to Coconut Island in Kane'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawaii, where it was permanently anchored for use as a bar and movie theater by Fleischmann Yeast heir Christian Holmes II. It can be seen in the 1948 Republic Pictures movie Wake of the Red Witch starring John Wayne and Gail Russell. In 1999, broadcast historian Elizabeth McLeod listed the Cruise of the Seth Parker as one of the top 100 old-time radio moments of the 20th century. The Gang Busters era After returning from his sailing adventure, Lord immediately set about writing and creating a new radio program. He switched from the kindly Seth Parker persona to a dark and ominous narrator's voice for his Gang Busters program, billed as \\"The Crime Fighters of American Broadcasting\\". A law enforcement reality series using authentic case histories, during the 1930s the program was hosted by Col. H. Norman Schwarzkopf and featured various actors such as Art Carney. The thirty-minute program ran on Wednesday nights at 10:00 p.m. on CBS radio and opened with the portentous sounds of machine gun fire, police whistles screaming and tires screeching, causing the phrase \\"coming on like gangbusters\\" to be coined. Copied years later by the television show America's Most Wanted, each episode of Gang Busters had up-to-the-minute reports of criminals wanted by the FBI or other law enforcement officials, many of whom were later arrested due to tips from listeners. To accomplish this, Lord hired actor/writer/civil servant Helen Sioussat (1902‚Äì1995), who later became the head of the Talks and Public Affairs Department at CBS. Such was the influence of Lord that Sioussat was given a Washington D.C. office next to J. Edgar Hoover at the Justice Department, where she was allowed access to official information from files upon which the radio series was based. The Gang Busters radio show was an enormous long-running success with 1,008 radio broadcasts over twenty-one years from July 20, 1935, to November 20, 1957. It also spawned a long-running DC Comics comic book of the same name, and was the basis for a motion picture with the same title as well as a half-hour weekly television series in 1952, both of which were narrated by Lord. In 1954, several episodes of the television series were used to create another documentary-style motion picture of the same title. The film proved successful enough that a second was put together in 1957 from more of the old television episodes and released under the title Guns Don't Argue. In 1998, Gang Busters was part of the 30-hour audio cassette called CBS's 60 Greatest Old-Time Radio Shows. Other accomplishments Among his numerous other radio creations, with World War II and the Battle of Britain raging in Europe, between December 1939 and August 1940 Lord produced a radio show about aviators that opened with an interview of a real-life pilot recounting an exciting adventure in the air after which the show moved to a dramatization played by radio actors. From 1939 to 1952, he produced Mr. District Attorney, a 30-minute crime show inspired by the real-life exploits of New York's racket-busting district attorney Thomas Dewey. The radio broadcast spawned a 1941 motion picture from Republic Pictures of the same name and a 1947 Columbia Pictures production. A comic book series, Mr. District Attorney, was published by DC Comics from 1948-1959. Lord produced the radio series By Kathleen Norris, making Norris \\"the first nationally famous writer to have her works brought to radio listeners as a daily serial program.\\" The program was broadcast on CBS October 9, 1939 - September 26, 1941. Lord's contribution to the radio industry was recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6912 Hollywood Blvd. He died in 1975 in Ellsworth, Maine. In 2004, his story was told by author Martin Grams, Jr. in the book Gang Busters: The Crime Fighters of American Broadcasting. Phillips Lord was also instrumental in raising awareness and money for the restoration of the USS Constitution. In later years, he retired to a home he built in Surry, Maine, and developed The Gatherings Campground nearby; it is still extant today. It is also known as The Gatherings Family Campground, but the locals just call it \\"The Gatherings\\". Marriages and children Phillips Lord's first wife was Sophia Mecorney, and they had two children, Jean Phillips Lord and Patricia Ann Lord. They were divorced sometime after the second child was born. After her marriage to Phillips Lord, she acted in the role of Lizzy Peters in his Seth Parker radio show in the 1930s and appeared as Lizzie in the Seth Parker movie \\"Way Back Home\\", which also starred Bette Davis. Phillips Lord married Donnie Boone circa 1942. They had only one child, Phillipa Susan Lord. The couple divorced in 1950.

Early life and education  Irving Kenneth Zola, born in 1935, in Newton, Massachusetts. He came from a working class Jewish family. His mother was of Polish origin and his father Russian, both arriving in the US as immigrants as young children. He graduated from Boston Latin School and went on to enroll at Harvard College in 1956, and four years later went on to receive his Ph.D. in Sociology from Harvard University Department of Social Relations.  Personal life  He married Leonora Katz in 1957. Their marriage ended in a divorce after 16 years.  Health  At the age of 16, Irving Zola was stricken by polio, which led to him using canes to assist him in walking. He also got into an automobile accident at the age of 19 which led to further health complications and increased disabilities. His personal disabilities led him to lead a career in championing the disabled, and he stated that \\"until we own our disability as an important part, though not necessarily all, of our identity, any attempt to create a meaningful pride, social movement or culture is doomed.\\"  Death  The cause of Zola's death was a heart attack; he died while being transported to the hospital on an ambulance on December 1, 1994. He is survived by wife Judy Norsigian, son Warren Keith Zola, and daughters Amanda Beth Mosola and Kyra Zola Norsigian. Career In 1982 Zola and a group of American academics founded the Society for Disability Studies, and the first editor of Disability Studies Quarterly. Soon after receiving his Ph.D. he briefly worked at Massachusetts General Hospital as a research sociologist before joining the Brandeis University Department of Sociology the next year in 1963, where he was the Mortimer Gryzmish Professor of Human Relations and taught until his death in 1994. During his time at Brandeis University, he worked with Everett C. Hughes, an American sociologist, who had a great impact on Zola's sociological perspective. During the thirty years that he spent in the department, Zola held the position of chairman three different times over a span of eleven years. For fifteen years, he held a joint appointment in the Florence Heller Graduate School for Advanced Studies in Social Welfare at Brandeis. Zola was one of the co-founders of Boston Self Help Center, an organization that is focused on advocating and counseling people with diseases and disabilities. From 1982 to 1987, he also served on the center's board as executive director. He also held the chairman position of the American Sociological Association medical sociology section, a consultant position of the World Health Organization, a member of President Clinton's transition team, and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Books  His best- known book, which first came out in 1982, is Missing Pieces: A Chronicle of Living With a Disability. It has been reissued in 2003. The 'Dr. Irving Kenneth Zola Collection,' a repository of most of Zola's works, can be found at The Samuel Gridley Howe Library at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. Zola had taught at Brandeis since 1963. His writings included an autobiography, \\"Missing Pieces: A Chronicle of Living with a Disability,\\" published in 1982. He edited \\"Ordinary Lives: Voices of Disability and Disease,\\" a 1982 anthology that was praised as a diverse collection of fictional and personal accounts.

It is a file format (filename extension .sid) developed and patented by LizardTech (in October 2018 absorbed into Extensis) for encoding of georeferenced raster graphics, such as orthophotos. MrSID originated as the result of research efforts at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Common uses =Geographic information systems= MrSID was originally developed for Geographic Information Systems (GIS). With this format, large raster image files such as aerial photographs or satellite imagery are compressed and can be quickly viewed without having to decompress the entire file. The MrSID (.sid) format is supported in major GIS applications such as Autodesk, Bentley Systems, CARIS, ENVI, ERDAS, ESRI, Intergraph, MapInfo, and QGIS. =Fingerprints= According to the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (which releases GDAL), MrSID was developed \\"under the aegis of the U.S. government for storing fingerprints for the FBI.\\" =Other uses= In a 1996 entry for the R&D; 100 Awards, LANL identified other uses for the format: \\"it can be used as an efficient method for storing and retrieving photographic archives; it can store and retrieve satellite data for consumer games and educational CD-ROMs; and it is well suited for use in vehicle navigation systems. Moreover, MrSID holds promise for being used in image compression and editing for desktop publishing and nonlinear digital video software.\\" For certain downloadable images (such as maps), American Memory at the Library of Congress began using MrSID in 1996; in January 2005 it also began using JPEG 2000. Depending on image content and color depth, compression of American Memory maps is typically better with MrSID, which on average achieves a compression ratio of approximately 22:1 versus the 20:1 achieved with JPEG 2000. Software Extensis offers a software package called GeoExpress to read and write MrSID files. They also provide a free web browser plug-in for the Microsoft Windows operating system. (A Macintosh OS version of this viewer, introduced in 2005, was discontinued.) Most commercial GIS software packages can read some versions of MrSID files including those from GE Smallworld, ESRI, Intergraph, Bentley Systems, MapInfo, Safe Software, Autodesk, with ERDAS IMAGINE being able to both read and write MrSID files. GeoExpress can also generate JPEG 2000 (.jp2) data. When combined with LizardTech's Express Server, .sid and .jp2 data can be served quickly to a variety of GIS applications and other client applications either through direct integrations or via WMS. There is no open source implementation of the MrSID format. Some open source GIS systems can read MrSID files, including MapWindow GIS and those based on GDAL. The Decode Software Development Kit (SDK) is made available as a free download from Extensis. This enables the capability to implement MrSID reading capability in any application. Some image editing and management software systems can also read MrSID files, including XnView and IrfanView. Technology =Encoding= MrSID technology uses lossless wavelet compression to create an initial image. Then the encoder divides the image into zoom levels, subbands, subblocks and bitplanes. After the initial encoding, the image creator can apply zero or more optimizations. While 2:1 compression ratios may be achieved losslessly, higher compression rates are lossy much like JPEG-compressed data. =Decoding= MrSID uses selective decoding meaning that the decoder does not have to decode the entire file to view a specific zoom level, image quality or scene for example.

Although her earlier music is almost exclusively electronic, since the 2000s she has incorporated classical instrumentation into her work for performances, recordings, and installations. Biography Born in South Africa, Chantal Passamonte moved to London in 1991. She began to work at a record shop and took up organizing parties and DJing. She worked at the labels 4AD and Warp Records, where she held the position of a publicist from 1994 to 1997. Mira Calix's earlier music specialised in mixing her intimate vocals with jittering beats and experimental electronic textures and natural sounds. In 2003 she collaborated with the London Sinfonietta for the first time. Nunu premiered at the Royal Festival Hall in London at a concert titled \\"Warp Works and 20th Century Masters\\". The piece then toured internationally, performed by live insects, orchestra and Calix on electronics. Since then, Calix has incorporated orchestration and live classical instruments in her performances and recorded work. She has worked with visual artists and musicians from other disciplines to create music for dance, theatre, film, opera and installations. Mira has been commissioned to write new works for the London Sinfonietta, Bang on a Can, the Aldeburgh Festival, The Royal Shakespeare Company, Opera North, Streetwise Opera and the Manchester International Festival. In 2004 she formed Alexander's Annexe ‚Äì a band/ensemble with pianist Sarah Nicolls and sound designer David Sheppard. Their debut performance was at the Ravello Festival in Italy, followed by performances at the Aldeburgh Festival and Parco della Musica in Rome. Alexander's Annexe released the album, Push Door To Exit, on Warp in November 2006. In early 2008 Mira was commissioned to set Shakespeare's Sonnet 130 to music. The project was curated by composer Gavin Bryars for The Royal Shakespeare Company. During 2007 there were two theatrical works; the first, an opera titled Elephant and Castle, for the Aldeburgh Festival, was a collaboration with composer Tansy Davies, directed by Tim Hopkins, Libretto by author Blake Morrison. The second, Dead Wedding premiered at the first Manchester International Festival. Extracts from these performances appear on the album The Elephant in the Room: 3 Commissions. The album also includes pieces from a video installation work titled Natures, a collaboration with video artist Quayola and cellist Oliver Coates. In December 2008, My Secret Heart premi√®red at the Royal Festival Hall in London with 100 members of Streetwise Opera. The installation piece, inspired by Gregorio Allegri's 17th century choral work Miserere, is a collaboration with British video artists Flat-E. In December 2009, Mira Calix won a British Composer Award, for My Secret Heart. It was described by the judges as \\"transformational, capturing raw humanity and giving voice to the disenfranchised in a sound-world which is original, absorbing and unsettling\\". My Secret Heart also won a Royal Philharmonic Society Award in 2009 and was nominated for a National Lottery Arts Award in 2010. The installation toured in other countries too, both with The Creators Project and The British Council. In February 2009, she collaborated with United Visual Artists on Chorus for the opening of the Howard Assembly Rooms in Leeds. The installation piece, which was also exhibited at Durham Cathedral and The Wapping Project won an Award of Distinction in the Interactive Category at Prix Ars Electronica in 2010. Calix has continued to work with UVA, most recently in 2011 with The Orchestrion an installation at the Coachella Festival for Vice/Intel's The Creators Project. In 2009, she contributed a cover of a Boards of Canada song; In A Beautiful Place Out in the Country, featuring cellist Oliver Coates to the Warp20 compilation. Later in the year she worked with Malcolm Middleton of Arab Strap on a session for BBC Radio 3's Late Junction. In 2010, Calix worked with poet Alice Oswald on another commission for Opera North and collaborated for the first time with the ensemble Bang on a Can. Mira Calix and the ensemble premiered Spring Falls Back at the World Financial Center Winter Garden in New York. Mira also spent the year working on a R&D; project to develop her skills in orchestration with composers Tansy Davies and Larry Goves. Exchange and Return an 18-month-long collaborative project was awarded a Grant for the Arts by Arts Council England. In 2011, Mira wrote a choral score for Fables ‚Äì A Film Opera working once more with visual artists Flat-e and Streetwise Opera. The film soundtrack, based on the fable of \\"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\\" was nominated for a British Composers Award that year. As a live performer and DJ, Mira Calix has supported and toured with Radiohead, Boards of Canada, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Autechre, and other artists. She has performed at Sonar, Glastonbury, All Tomorrow's Parties, Coachella, Latitude and other concert halls and festivals. Commissioned Work Mira Calix has a long history of work done for film, theater and other various types of media. In 2015, Calix was commissioned to score a Paris Opera film titled \\"Metamorphosis\\". The film was directed by Matthew Clark of the United Visual Artists. In late 2015, Calix was commissioned to score Rory Mullarkey‚Äôs adaptation of The Oresteia for Shakespeare‚Äôs Globe. The score is made up of a combination of electronic, wind and brass instruments. In 2016, Calix collaborated with students from Nanjing University of The Arts to make the temporary sound art installation \\"Moving Museum 35\\". It was described as a museum in a public bus. The exhibit ran on the Route 35 bus in Nanjing, China. In 2017, Calix was commissioned to create work for the Organ Reframed event. The premise of the event is composers showcasing the variations and sounds of a traditional organ. Calix alongside other composers showcased their pieces made with organs from October 13‚Äì15, 2017 in the Union Chapel in London.

Total degree days from an appropriate starting date are used to plan the planting of crops and management of pests and pest control timing. Weekly or monthly degree-day figures may also be used within an energy monitoring and targeting scheme to monitor the heating and cooling costs of climate controlled buildings, while annual figures can be used for estimating future costs. A degree day is computed as the integral of a function of time that generally varies with temperature. The function is truncated to upper and lower limits that vary by organism, or to limits that are appropriate for climate control. The function can be estimated or measured by one of the following methods, in each case by reference to a chosen base temperature: * Frequent measurements and continuously integrating the temperature deficit or excess; * Treating each day's temperature profile as a sine wave with amplitude equal to the day's temperature variation, measured from max and min, and totalling the daily results; * As above, but calculating the daily difference between mean temperature and base temperature; * As previous, but with modified formulae on days when the max and min straddle the base temperature. A zero degree-day in energy monitoring and targeting is when either heating or cooling consumption is at a minimum, which is useful with power utility companies in predicting seasonal low points in energy demand. Degree days are a useful metric for estimating energy consumption required for household heating and cooling, and in this context are formally referred to as heating degree days. Since the escape or entrance of heat due to conduction is proportional to the difference between the indoor and outdoor temperature, the amount of energy needed to maintain the base temperature indoors for some period of time is roughly proportional to the number of degree days. For example, if the base temperature is 18 ¬∞C (64 ¬∞F) and the outdoor temperature is constant at 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F) for one day, this counts at 8 degree days (14 degree days in Fahrenheit). Note that the base temperature used for these calculations is 2‚Äì3 ¬∞C (4‚Äì5 ¬∞F) lower than a typical indoor temperature setting, since a building will naturally be slightly warmer than the surrounding air due to body heat of its occupants and absorption of solar radiation. Canada =Growing degree days= Growing degree days are based on 5¬∞C as typical plant growth stops below that temperature. Plants growth has been observed to relate stage of growth to the number of degree days. Many plants will fruit after a certain number of degree days. Strawberries for instance. Other plants however, called deterministic, will fruit based on the time of year which the plant determines from the number of hours of sunlight in a day. Think of Easter lilies or Christmas cactus. The paper referenced shows the complexity of plant growth and degree days. http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2013/aac- aafc/agrhist/A53-1635-1977-eng.pdf =Black Fly= Canadians use Growing Degree Days to predict when mosquitoes and black fly emerge and cease. For insect growth however degree days above freezing are used. (0¬∞C) http://www.enr.gov.nt.ca/sites/enr/files/wildlife_manuscript_report_246.pdf United States In the United States, a simplified method is used to calculate both heating and cooling degree days. The mean (that is, ) daily temperature in Fahrenheit and a nominal temperature of (for heating) and (for cooling) are used. * If the mean daily temperature is 65 ¬∞F, no degree days are counted. * If the mean daily temperature is below 65 ¬∞F, the mean degrees Fahrenheit below 65 ¬∞F are counted as the heating degree day. * If the mean daily temperature is above 80 ¬∞F, the mean degrees Fahrenheit above 80 ¬∞F are counted as the cooling degree day. The heating and cooling degree days are tallied separately to calculate monthly, seasonal, and yearly total heating and cooling degree days. Heating and cooling degree days closely correlate with heating and cooling demand. Standardization The degree day is not an SI derived unit; although the day is acceptable for use in the SI, it is not a decimal multiple of its base unit, the second. (The degree, in Celsius and measured relative to a base temperature, is identical to the kelvin, the SI base unit). Expressed as a proper SI unit, a quantity of kelvin second is four orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding degree day (1 Celsius degree-day is 8.64√ó104 K¬∑s; 1 Fahrenheit degree-day is 4.8√ó104 K¬∑s).

Campaign Vietnam Combat Artists Team IX (CAT IX 1969-70). Painting shows army soldiers airdropping Psy Op leaflets during the Vietnam War. Defection was urged by means of a propaganda campaign, usually leaflets delivered by artillery shell or dropped over enemy- controlled areas by aircraft, or messages broadcast over areas of South Vietnam. A number of incentives were offered to those who chose to cooperate, along with psychological warfare to break enemy morale. Safe conduct pass. A Chieu Hoi BagTo further this aim, invitations to defect, which also acted as safe conduct passes, were printed on clear plastic waterproof bags used to carry ammunition for the US soldiers' M16 assault rifle. Each bag held one magazine and was sealed to prevent moisture from the jungle's humid climate from damaging the contents. When the magazine was needed during a firefight with the enemy, the bag would be torn open and discarded, in the hope that it would later be discovered by enemy troops who would read the text and consider defection. By 1967, approximately 75,000 defections had been recorded, but analysts speculate that less than 25% of those were genuine. The program had some difficulty catching on, due in part to culture gap--errors, such as misspellings and unintentionally offensive statements--and worsened by communist reprisals against defectors and their families. To make matters worse, as testified by Sergeant Scott Camil during the 1971 Winter Soldier Investigation, the passes were sometimes ignored by U.S. forces, and their holders shot while surrendering.Testimony of Scott Camil, Winter Soldier Investigation Overall, however, the Chieu Hoi program was considered successful. Those who surrendered were known as \\"Hoi Chanh\\" and were often integrated into allied units as Kit Carson Scouts, operating in the same area where they had defected. Many made great contributions to the effectiveness of U.S. units, and often distinguished themselves, earning decorations as high as the Silver Star. The program was relatively inexpensive, and removed over 100,000 combatants from the field (assuming the accuracy of the numbers recorded and the sincerity of the defections).

In 1979, he published his Himalayan Handbook, an index of all the-then named peaks of 6096 meters (20000 feet) and above in Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent, giving chronological entries of expeditions up to 1975 to each peak with a brief summary of results and references to expedition reports, after a decade of solitary research. He was inspired in this formidable undertaking by the pronouncement of the late Soli S. Mehta, Hony. Local Secretary of The Himalayan Club, that the task had never been attempted before and was well- nigh impossible. This book, introduced by the famous British mountaineer- explorer J. O. M. Roberts, one of Sircar's idols, was the first one of its kind. Printed in 500 copies only, it received excellent international noticesThe Alpine Journal, 1980,p.255, The Alpine Club, London and became a basic reference resource.High Asia : an illustrated guide to the 7000 metre peaks by Jill Neate, The Mountaineers, 1989 In 1982, Sircar was the first to suspect and draw public attention to the covert competition between India and Pakistan over the Siachen Glacier and coined the term Oropolitics to describe the use of mountaineering expeditions as a cloak for establishing territorial claims. His essay on this topic was published in abbreviated form in an article in The Telegraph newspaper of Calcutta.The Telegraph - Calcutta : Nation The full essay titled \\"Oropolitics\\" came out in Himalaya Sameeksha, a limited circulation magazine published by Kamala Mukherjee in Calcutta, and was subsequently reprinted in the prestigious Alpine Journal of London in 1984.. India sent troops into the Siachen Glacier the same year. Sircar surmised the existence of a feasible pass in Himachal Pradesh, India on the Himalayan divide between Kullu and Spiti Districts. He led three expeditions to the high range separating the Upper Parvati valley from the unexplored Debsa Glacier in 1992, 1993 and 1995. The Debsa Pass (5340 metres), named by him, was reached in 1993 and crossed on 21 September 1995, and the team descended the unexplored West Debsa Glacier and followed the Debsa stream to the Parahio Valley and from there to the Spiti Valley.Expedition report Backdoor to Spiti: Debsa 1992-1995 by J. Sircar, Royal Geographical Society archives The pass has become a regular route as it saves 2‚Äì3 days over the traditional Kullu-Spiti route by the Pin Parvati Pass (5319 metres). Sircar has taken part in a number of other mountaineering expeditions, likes travelling to remote places, and is a poet, essayist, and wildlifer. He drew the attention of the Bombay Natural History Society in 2001 to the presence of large numbers of the endangered Bar-Headed Goose at Gharana Wetland Reserve, Jammu, which eventually led to this neglected sanctuary on the Indo-Pak border being classified as an Important Bird AreaImportant Bird Areas of India by M. Zafar-ul Islam and Asad Rahmani, IBCN & BNHS, Bombay, 2004 He is also avidly interested in history and military matters, particularly aviation, and was the first to compose a brief biography of the World War II Beaufighter ace Flying Officer A.M.O. Pring, DFM , a childhood hero who flew and died in combat defending Calcutta from Japanese air attack and is buried at Calcutta. He followed this up with an expanded essay called Sergeant Pring and the Calcutta Hurricane in which an outline biography of Maurice Pring is combined with the pioneering study of a rare and little-known night-fighter, the Hawker Hurricane II C(NF) equipped with the pilot-operated AI Mark VI radar. Both essays have won praise from aviation cognoscenti. He has followed these pieces up with an article conclusively demonstrating that the Hurricane II C(NF) was, in fact, the first radar-equipped single-seater night-fighter.A selection of his English poetry is available in Poemhunter In a recent article, Sircar has claimed to have solved the mystery of the Lake of No Return, Myanmar, which he visited in 2002.

Storylines Len was from Liverpool, born on 5 November 1924. His parents were killed in the Blitz, after which Len joined the Merchant Navy. After de-mob, he came to Weatherfield, where he married Nellie and had a son Stanley (played by Peter Noone, later of the British pop group Herman's Hermits). The marriage was not a happy one and on 22 November 1963, Nellie told him she wanted a divorce. Nellie later died of cancer and Stanley never forgave his father for how he had treated her ‚Äî they were never reconciled. A builder by profession ‚Äî he owned his own yard ‚Äî he also spent many years as an Independent councillor for Weatherfield. Len's idea of a real woman was his next door neighbour, Elsie Tanner (Patricia Phoenix): attractive, sexy, with a ribald sense of humour. However she was more of a friend than a lover, and when Len suggested that their relationship should go to the next level, Elsie always refused, not wanting to spoil the special bond they had. When Elsie remarried, to a handsome G.I., Master Sergeant Steve Tanner (Paul Maxwell), Len was consumed with jealousy, to such an extent that when Steve was found dead in suspicious circumstances, Len was accused of murdering him. Len had reconciled himself to being on his own for the rest of his life ‚Äî and then he met Rita Bates (Barbara Knox), who earned her living as a cabaret singer in the rather downmarket Gatsby Club. Although she claimed she was married to Harry Bates (William Simons), they were in fact only a common-law couple; her name was actually Rita Littlewood. Rita had a lot in common with Elsie. She was feisty, independent and was never afraid to stand up to Len, and this was what he wanted in a woman. Elsie was initially very cool towards Rita, but they became firm friends later. After a rocky courtship, Len and Rita married and honeymooned in Tenerife, where Rita had a secured herself a singing job. After a while, Rita started to feel frustrated by Len and his lack of motivation. Feeling he was taking her for granted, Rita left him, upon which Len went to pieces. Once she had agreed to return, the couple attempted to adopt a child, but were told they were too old. Instead, they fostered, first a boy called John, then, on a more long-term basis, Sharon Gaskell (Tracie Bennett). Len was amused that she preferred woodwork to needlework and that she liked playing football ‚Äî this caused an instant bond between them, much to Rita's delight. Sharon became the Faircloughs' surrogate daughter, and Len was proud of her. When he came home unexpectedly one night and found a boy in the house trying to entice Sharon upstairs, he threatened to hit him. Rita was angry, believing that Len had mishandled the situation, but he was able to say from the heart that he had only done it because he cared about Sharon. Eventually, Sharon moved away, after getting a job as a kennel maid in Sheffield. Life seemed to be going well for the Faircloughs; they had two businesses, Len's building yard and The Kabin, a newsagents. However, an off-screen scandal, when Peter Adamson, who played Len, was accused of indecent assault, resulted in a decision by the producers to discontinue the character, despite Adamson eventually being found not guilty. For several months Len did not appear, his absence explained by a storyline that he was working long hours on a contract away from home. Rita's world came crashing down when Len fell asleep at the wheel of his van and collided with a motorway bridge. He was killed instantly. Rita was devastated, but was comforted when Sharon came back from Sheffield to attend the funeral. Rita was later to discover, however, that Len had been having an affair with a woman in Ashton. As a result, her memories of Len remained bitter-sweet. When Rita subsequently began a relationship with Alan Bradley (Mark Eden), Alan stole evidence of Len's identity and pretended to be him in order to obtain a loan to support his own business. It was Rita's discovery of the deception that caused her violent final break-up with Alan. Creation and casting Adamson was a former extra and theatre actor who had turned to TV drama with the Granada series Skyport and Knight Errant. When casting began for the new TV serial Florizel Street, Adamson auditioned for the parts of Dennis Tanner (later Philip Lowrie) and Ken Barlow (later William Roache), however at thirty he was considered too old for either part and instead he was cast as insurance man Harry Bailey. Adamson was one of several actors cast for the dry runs who did not appear on screen; when the series was commissioned, further casting and rewrites took place, and Harry Bailey was dropped from the episode (the character later appeared in Episode 5, renamed Ron Bailey and played by Ray Mort). When the series was extended beyond its initial run, Adamson tried again, auditioning for the part of Harry Hewitt's (Ivan Beavis) drinking buddy by the name of Len Fairclough. He secured the part and made his on-screen debut in Episode 14 on 25 January 1961. Despite a sketchy character brief, Len's role grew, and with the departure of Ivan Beavis from the cast in 1964 Len took over as the programme's leading alpha male. Then-script editor H.V. Kershaw credited this to Adamson's skill as an actor: \\"The character of Len Fairclough was formed in the first few weeks or Coronation Street mainly as a social partner for Harry Hewitt who had been a central character since the second episode. So assertively was the character played by Peter Adamson that it rapidly achieved an importance of its own and by the beginning of 1964 the character led the male defence against the monstrous battalions of the Street's women.\\" Bill Podmore, producer throughout the 1970s, said \\"Peter had a great rugged quality, the right face and exactly the right build. His toughness only gave more weight to his acting skills. Off the set he could be as abrasive as the man he played, it was an underlying part of his nature which he passed on to Len. He turned him into a wonderfully earthy character who didn't mince words but was never unattractive to the legions of fans.\\"Coronation Street: The Inside Story, Bill Podmore, 1990 An early sign of the character's success was that Adamson was the only non- original cast member contracted for the duration of the Equity actors' strike between November 1961 and April 1962. As noted in Life in the Street (Graeme Kay, 1991), the public reaction to the character varied from demands by viewers to drop the \\"loud-mouthed, hard-drinking bully\\", to male viewers offering Adamson a fight to \\"find out how tough he really was\\". Development When he first appeared in the serial, Len was characterized as a neglectful husband and father, although his wife Nellie never appeared on- screen. For many years, Len was programme's central male character, appearing in more episodes than anyone else in 1962, 1965, 1966 and 1972. A key element of the character was his relationship with Elsie Tanner. Despite a mutual attraction between the pair, the writers never allowed Len and Elsie to get together, as writer Adele Rose explains: \\"The value of their relationship was always in the spikiness underneath the genuine affection they had for each other. It was far more profitable in terms of story and character to keep them with the love-hate relationship going on. He was the one who could say things to her that nobody else could and vice versa. If we ever brought it to any kind of conclusion, that would have been the end of both the characters' value to the show.\\"50 Years of Coronation Street: The (very) Unofficial Story, Sean Egan, 2010 Len was the first character to swear in Coronation Street. As recalls Kershaw: \\"Coronation Street resisted the use of the word 'bloody' until Episode 190 when Len Fairclough, suffering under the stress of the kidnapping of his friend's baby, used the word to Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) and immediately apologised. Those days have gone forever.\\" The other woman in Len's life was Rita Littlewood. The character of Rita, initially named Rita Bates, was specifically devised as a love interest for Len, although when Barbara Mullaney was cast the character was linked with her prior one-episode role from 1964. Five years later, producer Bill Podmore decided that they would finally tie the knot. He was surprised to be met with opposition from the actors: \\"Peter and Barbara argued that a wedding could be the beginning of the end for their characters. Len and Rita were cornerstones of the Street, and they imagined that a marriage could chip the bedrock away. Their individual independence within the programme would disappear first and that, they feared, would be swiftly followed by a watering down of their story-lines. Frankly, they didn't want to share.\\" The wedding was watched by 16.90 million viewers - the programme's highest audience figure of the decade - and the TV Times celebrated with a wedding souvenir magazine. =Adamson's behaviour= The character was absent between October and December 1969, as Peter Adamson was suspended for two months without pay to deal with his alcoholism. H.V. Kershaw made the decision after Adamson was so inebriated during the recording of a scene that, for the first time in the programme's history not due to a technical problem, the scene had to be remounted the following week so that close-ups could be shot which were then edited into the previous week's footage. Adamson's drinking had been a continuing problem behind the scenes. Bill Podmore, who directed the episode in question, says: \\"Peter had been pretty tipsy on set many times before but we had always got away with it and I don't think a single viewer ever suspected. If they did, they let it pass. Harry Kershaw was not prepared to be so generous this time. For him it was the last straw.\\" Kershaw: \\"Peter Adamson's drunkenness hung around like an albatross around the programme's neck and my responsibilities as producer were beginning to weigh very heavily indeed ... At each story conference during this period we would include the character in our projected plots, hoping that Peter Adamson's problem would miraculously disappear. This was wishful thinking at its most stupid and it rapidly became evident as matters grew worse that drastic action needed to be taken.\\" On Adamson's reaction to his suspension, \\"His immediate reaction, as I recall it, was to call me a crafty bastard ... He had always banked on Granada's reluctance to tear up three months of planning and get rid of him. The cunning which leads alcoholics to hide their bottles in inaccessible places had led him to believe that his financial future at least was secure and the shattering of this belief was in fact the first step towards his recovery.\\" Kershaw wrongly claims that the suspension occurred in 1964) According to Kershaw and Podmore, Adamson beat the bottle at the first attempt. =Departure= Len's last appearance before Adamson's leave of absence in Episode 2307 stood as the character's swansong, and seven months later he was killed off, dying off- screen in a motorway collision while returning home from his hitherto secret mistress Marjorie Proctor. \\"Of course the public saw this as another twist of the knife,\\", said Bill Podmore, \\"and Peter traded on their sympathy. He had been a professional actor long enough to realise that if a character of Len's fame was to be killed off, the sacrifice would only be made with the help of the most dramatic story-line possible. Instead he chose to believe that Coronation Street had taken revenge for his shame.\\"Coronation Street: The Inside Story, p79 Writers John Stevenson and Adele Rose back up Podmore's claim that Len cheating on Rita was motivated only by the objective of maximum drama.^ 50 Years of Coronation Street: The (very) Unofficial Story, p156 References Fairclough, Len Fairclough, Len Fairclough, Len Fairclough, Len Fairclough, Len Fairclough, Len ","title":"Len Fairclough"},{"id":"2855046","text":"MailScanner is an open source email security system for use on Unix email gateways and was first released in 2001.

Its original Japanese title was . The series premiered in 1962 on TBS and ran continuously until 1965 for ten self-contained story arcs (seasons), usually of 13 episodes each. Also created were two black-and-white feature films by Toei Company, made in 1964 by the same crew which created the TV series, and a stage show. The Samurai proved to be highly successful despite its initially very limited budget. It was the first Japanese TV program ever screened in Australia, where it premiered in 1964 and built up a remarkably large fan-base among the local young audience at the time, rapidly becoming a cult favourite. Despite its massive popularity in Australia as well as success in Japan, New Zealand and the Philippines, the series was not widely screened elsewhere and its fame remains largely restricted to those countries. It was followed in 1965 by the spin-off series , featuring a completely new main character, ran only 39 episodes, compared to the 128 episodes of the original series. In 1973, a colour TV series was also made for 26 new episodes in an abortive attempt of a remake and then a short- lived reboot. All of the TV series were sponsored by Takeda Pharmaceutical.  1962 series  =Story= The series portrayed the adventures of a roving samurai detective/spy, Akikusa Shintar≈ç (ÁßãËçâÊñ∞Â§™ÈÉé) (played by Koichi Ose), whose real identity is Matsudaira Nobuchiyo - the older half-brother of Tokugawa Ienari, the 11th Tokugawa shogun, who is still a minor. Because he is the son of a concubine, Nobuchiyo has no claim to power, so he assumes the guise of a wandering swordsman named Shintar≈ç to seek out and eliminate plots by rival feudal lords and thus protect his younger brother. Originally it was planned to make only four distinct stories, with a different hero in each, however Shintar≈ç was received so well that he remained for the rest of the series in which, acting on secret orders from the r≈çj≈´ (high councillor) Lord Matsudaira Sadanobu, he gathers information mostly in the various fiefdoms of the central Honsh≈´ and battles rival warriors and spies, often aided by his faithful ninja assistant Tombei the Mist (Èúß„ÅÆÈÅÅÂÖµË°õ, Kiri no Tonbei) (played by Fuyukichi Maki). Characters Akikusa Shintar≈ç appeared as the main character in all ten stories of The Samurai, making his last appearance in the final episode \\"The Duel\\", where he was last seen on a boat with his arch-rival Kong≈ç of K≈çga, presumably about to engage in a duel to the death out on the lake. He lives among the ordinary people while posing as a r≈çnin (masterless samurai), working undercover to protect Ienari's position as the shogun. Shintar≈ç is a master swordsman, using the two traditional swords of the samurai (the long katana and the short wakizashi). He is usually shown wearing a kimono, sometimes with a hakama, and has a ponytail (a top-knot and half-shaven head in the first season). The series' second main character is Tombei the Mist, an Iga Ninja master considered to be the best of the Oniwabansh≈´ employed by the shogun to guard his castle, who first appears in the third story arc (second season in the Australian TV broadcast) and promptly becomes Shintar≈ç's regular sidekick. Tombei is a master of disguise, skilled with shuriken, swords (using the reverse-grip technique) and scaling hooks, also able to call-in the additional Men of Iga, and the two saved each other's lives numerous times. His outfit is a grey version of the shinobi sh≈çzoku Iga outfit (as opposed to the black-clad ninja opponents) and he has a chonmage top-knot hair, sometimes covered by a grey ninja hood. Later Shintar≈ç is also accompanied by young boy with a pet monkey - Baba Sh≈´saku (played by ≈åmori Shunsuke, replaced by Mitsuru Takeuchi for the first film). Some of the series other most memorable characters were its ninja antagonists, especially those played by the recurring Bin Amatsu. Plot ;Spy Swordsman (Onmitsu Kenshi) The opening arc is distinctly western-inspired, with much horseback riding and gun fighting. It portrays the native Ainu people sympathetically as they substitute for American Indians in the frontier-like Ezo (modern Hokkaid≈ç). Fuyukichi Maki appears in several episodes as the Ainu rebel leader Kamokuin, while Bin Amatsu plays two minor roles. It was actually aired as the last season in the Australian run of the series, as it was less representative of the show as a whole. Shintar≈ç has been ordered to investigate the resources of the Matsumae clan and write a report about them. The lord of Matsumae suspects that this will lead to the shogunate taking control of his fiefdom and sends his fanatically loyal but rightful retainer, Kiba Jinj≈´r≈ç (played by Toshiyuki Katsuki), who vows to kill Shintar≈ç. During his investigation, Shintar≈ç struggles to help the downtrodden local Japanese villagers and the oppressed Ainu, and also fights local bandits and smugglers, often inadvertently aided by his just rival Kiba. ;Koga Ninjas (Ninp≈ç K≈çgash≈´) The second story (aired as the first season in Australia) introduces ninja to the series, setting a theme that would then dominate The Samurai. Set in Kai Province (modern Yamanashi Prefecture), the story follows the plot of a society of 13 master K≈çga Ninja and their followers to use the lost gold mine of a 16th-century warlord Takeda Shingen to further their own ambitions - and Shintar≈ç's efforts to foil them. The K≈çga Ninja are led by K≈çga Ry≈´shir≈ç, a descendant of the founder of the K≈çga, and include Genz≈ç the Spider (played by Bin Amatsu, the first time in a ninja role), Kurobei who eventually defects to Shintaro, and the female ninja Oyo. Also introduced to the series is Sh≈´saku, a descendant of the great Takeda general Baba Nobukatsu, a real historical figure, whose father has been kidnapped by the K≈çga Ninja. ;Iga Ninjas (Ninp≈ç Iga J≈´nin) Set in May 1788, the story concerns the mission of Shintar≈ç, aided by Tombei and his group of Iga Ninja, to stop Momochi Genkur≈ç (played by Toshiyuki Katsuki), the best swordsman in Japan, and the leader of a renegade group of ten master Iga Ninja from the Manji Valley who are hired by the Lord of Owari to assassinate Matsudaira Sadanobu on the T≈çkaid≈ç road in the region between Edo and Kyoto. Unknown to his employer, Momochi himself has a secret agenda, to plunge the country back into civil war and revive the golden age of ninjutsu. His group includes a woman ninja Okayo, who at first wants to avenge the death of her brother Koheita, but later develops feelings for Shintar≈ç (a similar character, Kazeba the sister of Nuinosuke, appears in the follow-up story), and Gensai the Wolf (Okami no Gensai) played by Amatsu. ;Black Ninja (Ninp≈ç Yami H≈çshi) This story was shown in Australia after the final story even though it follows directly from Iga Ninja later on in 1788. It sees the return of Gensai the Wolf, who joins the Black Ninja (Yami H≈çshi - literally Black Priest) group of K≈çga Ninja led by Hakuunsai. The story revolves around an attempt to sign up disgruntled daimy≈ç (feudal domain lords, called \\"landowners\\" in the series) in a political plot against the central government to install the young lord of the Owari clan as the new shogun. To further their aims the Black Ninja begin killing \\"secret samurai\\" in Edo and in the provinces to expose the elaborate system of spies that the shogunate employs to keep tabs on the domain lords. The Black Ninja hope that by doing this they can foment anger and dissatisfaction with the government and induce the clans to join in the plot. Shintar≈ç foils all of the Black Ninja's plans, obtains the scroll containing the signatures of the plotters and eventually uncovers the instigator of the conspiracy and the true identity of Hakuunsai. Finally, in a great act of chivalry he saves the Owari clan from certain annihilation by destroying the proof of the plot against the shogunate. ;Fuma Ninja (Ninp≈ç F≈´ma Ichizoku) Set in 1790 in and between Edo and Odawara, the story introduces F≈´ma Kotar≈ç (the chief antagonist being again portrayed by Amatsu), a descendant and namesake of the infamous 16th century ninja F≈´ma Kotar≈ç. He is obsessed with finding the buried treasure of the H≈çj≈ç clan lost at the end of the 16th century when Odawara Castle fell to Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and using the million pieces of gold it contains to revive the fortunes of the F≈´ma. Three mirrors hold the clues to its location: the Wind Thunder, the Water Tiger and the Fire Dragon mirrors. Most of the story is concerned with the efforts of the F≈´ma Ninja to find them and later to recover them from Shintar≈ç and Tonbei who had taken them for safe-keeping. The younger sister of F≈´ma Kotar≈ç, Oboro is introduced along the way and her attempts at obtaining the mirrors form a large part of the story. It ends with the apparent death of F≈´ma Kotar≈ç when, wounded by Shintar≈ç, he falls from a cliff. ;Fuma Ninja Continued (Zoku Ninp≈ç F≈´ma Ichizoku) This story continues the search for the H≈çj≈ç treasure which takes both Shintar≈ç and the F≈´ma around the former Musashi and Sagami provinces. As in the case of two of the previous stories, a major enemy falls in love with Shintar≈ç - this time it's the ninja princess Oboro (Naoko Saga, a pop singer from King Records), Kotar≈ç's younger sister who has been introduced in the first part of the Fuma story and would also return in Contest of Death. Her attempts to aid Shintaro are discovered by Kotar≈ç who orders his men to kill her. She is used as bait to trap Shintar≈ç but he rescues her from certain death. In the end, Kotar≈ç and Shintar≈ç duel until Kotar≈ç, apparently mortally wounded, blows himself up together with the treasure. ;Ninja Terror (Ninp≈ç Negoru-Sh≈´) This story is set in Kii Province (modern Wakayama Prefecture) in December 1789 and concerns the succession of the new lord of Wakayama. The rightful heir is Prince Yorikata, supported by the retainer Oribe Hida and guarded by six Kish≈´ Ninja led by Geny≈ç. Opposed to him is another retainer, Nait≈ç Daigaku, who wants to put Yorikata's younger brother Yoshitsuna in his place so he would become the regent and control Kii. Nait≈ç eventually wants to also assassinate Ienari and install Yoshitsuna as the 12th shogun and control the entire country. To this end he employs the Negoro Ninja, led by Gary≈´d≈çshi (played by Yoshio Yoshida), to carry out his plans, while Shintar≈ç and Tonbei aid Yorikata and the Kish≈´ Ninja. ;Phantom Ninja (Ninp≈ç Mabaroshi-Sh≈´) This story is set in and around Edo and concerns the mysterious Lord of Night (Kurayami no Gotair≈ç) and his attempt to bring about Matsudaira Sadanobu's downfall by destroying those closest to him. To this end he hires Kong≈ç of K≈çga (actually Kotar≈ç, returning due to popular demand from fans, and once again played by Amatsu) who in turn hires the seven Phantom (Maboroshi) Ninja from Phantom valley in Koga to assassinate those whose names appear in the so-called Book of Death. These include Tonbei and the other Iga Ninja as well as Shintar≈ç. Shintar≈ç thwarts all but one of the attempts to assassinate the others in the book and one by one he kills off the Phantom ninja, foiling their plot to disgrace Lord Sadanobu. In the end he is able to unmask the Lord of Night as Lord Rokkaku, one of the shogun's advisors. This story is notable because the Phantom Ninja \\"baddies\\" are portrayed with some depth and sensitivity. It also portrays a woman Phantom ninja named Chidori as being in every way equal to her male companions with interesting ninja weapons and techniques of her own. She is also one of only three female ninja in the series who manage to resist Shintar≈ç's charms and remain true to their cause (the other two being Oko in Ninja Terror and Namiji in Fuma Ninja Continued). ;Puppet Ninja (Kugotsu Ninp≈çch≈ç) Set in Ky≈´sh≈´, this story is about Shintar≈ç's battles with a group of Puppet Ninja, led by the ancient master Genshin. Tonbei is sent to Hizen Province (modern Nagasaki and Saga prefectures) to spy on the lords there because of suspected smuggling. When he fails to report, Shintar≈ç goes after him and discovers Genshin of the Shiranui clan has been bringing in guns smuggled from abroad and distributing them to other lords in Hizen with the ultimate aim of toppling the central government and taking control of Japan. Kong≈ç reappears in this story, stalking Shintar≈ç and even saving him from the hands of the Puppet Ninja once so he can kill him himself later. This story was shorter than usual (only 10 episodes) because of the broadcast of the 1964 Summer Olympics. ;Contest of Death (Ayakashi Ninp≈çch≈ç) The originally final season of the whole series. Set in 1790, it tells of Kong≈ç's attempts to have Shintar≈ç assassinated by ninja of different schools, until they eventually turn on him instead. They see him, no less than Shintaro himself, as an obstacle to their ambitions. The season ends with Kong≈ç and Shintar≈ç leaving together in a boat sailing, as Shintaro says, into the far distance. There is in fact no duel between Shintaro and Kongo, because he and Kongo have already duelled successfully with the five ninja masters who believe (in vain) that they can bring back civil disruption and hence the glory days of the ninja clans. Wearied of fighting, Shintaro, with the disenchanted Kongo (who now sees the dream of restoring the past of bloodshed and violence to be futile), leaves for another life, his mission achieved and society at peace. As he and Kongo depart, Sh≈´saku, Tombei the Mist, and Oboro (Kotar≈ç/Kong≈ç's sister from the Fuma Ninja stories) remain behind on the shore, sadly crying out their farewells. A true hero‚Äîa true embodiment of Samurai chivalry‚ÄîShintaro retires into a glorious anonymity, his quests all accomplished. =Music= The music accompanying The Samurai was composed by Hirooki Ogawa and was quite innovative for the time. It uses both Western and traditional instruments, with percussion playing a large part. There is a series theme song which is played frequently using both vocal and instrumental variations, in various keys and tempos. There are also a number of leitmotifs which recur throughout the series. Individual stories often have their own musical themes, the most notable of these being the \\"running\\" music and the \\"House of Death\\" theme in Phantom Ninjas and the \\"puppet player\\" song in Puppet Ninja. =Reception= Presumably responding to the increasing interest in Japan that accompanied the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, a few episodes of The Samurai were screened by Channel 9, Sydney in early 1964. After this first screening Channel 9 took the unprecedented step of inviting viewers to write in if they wanted to see more; the result was one of the largest viewer responses in the station's history, with thousands of letters sent in requesting more episodes. The entire series was shown, though the storylines were presented out of their original sequence as shown in Japan, which denied the Australian audience the intended effect of a mysterious, open-ended conclusion to the show. By 1965 it was the TV hit of the year, becoming the most popular programme in TCN-9's history up to that time, surpassing even The Mickey Mouse Club and sparking the first wave of ninja-mania outside Japan. The level of popularity it attained is remarkable given there was still much resentment of Japan in Australia at the time, although it may be explained by the fact that most of the fans were children and teenagers. The program proved so popular that a promoter brought out star Ose Koichi and a large supporting troupe to appear in a specially written 90-minute stage play based on the show, which played to capacity houses in both at the Sydney Stadium and Melbourne, and it was reported that more people (over 7,000, many of them in costume) turned out to greet Ose when he arrived at Essendon Airport in Melbourne than greeted The Beatles when they visited there in June 1964. The success of The Samurai led Sydney TV channel ATN-7 to screen Phantom Agents (Ninja Butai Gekk≈ç), another ninja-themed TV series but set in the 1960s Japan, which then developed its own cult following. Novelist Ruth Manley took names, even characters and incidents from the show and recast and wove them into her three children's novels based on Japanese myths and folklore, The Plum Rain Scroll (1978), The Dragon Stone (1982) and The Peony Lantern (1987). In 2009 SBS One broadcast a TV documentary titled Shintaro! The Samurai Sensation That Swept a Nation that reviewed the Australian impact of the show and then was itself released on DVD in 2010. =Home releases= Two VHS tapes were released in Japan in 1999/2000, one of The Samurai (containing the episodes \\"The Man From Edo\\", \\"The Stolen Case\\" and \\"The Duel\\") and one of The New Samurai (the episodes \\"The Search for Kage\\", \\"An Enemy Returns\\" and \\"The Star Sword\\"). The whole series was released on DVD (20 discs in a boxed set) in June 2003, later re-released as separate stories in April 2004. The discs are Region 2 and in Japanese only. Siren Visual released six story arcs of The Samurai on DVD in Australia between September 2002 and February 2006. In February 2010 Siren Visual Entertainment began releasing the complete series in English (remastered, with optional original Japanese sound track with subtitles) for the first time.  Films  The first film, titled simply Onmitsu Kenshi and released on March 28, 1964, concerns a group of daimy≈ç led by the Lord of Owari involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the shogun. The lead ninja antagonist, K≈çga Ry≈´shir≈ç from the second story, was again played by Bin Amatsu and the new character of his sister Kasumi was played by Junko Fuji. An English-subtitled version of the film entitled Detective Fencer has aired on the NGN (Nippon Golden Network) channel in Hawaii. A fan-subbed version entitled Spy Swordsman was also made available on DVD. The second film, titled Zoku Onmitsu Kenshi (\\"Spy Swordsman Continued\\") and released on August 2 of the same year, concerns the search for a buried treasure in seven gold mines in the Izu Peninsula and features the F≈´ma and the Iga ninja clans as well as the Tokugawa clan. Other TV series = The New Samurai = The sequel series, made by the same creators (again produced by Shinichi Nishimura, written by Masaru Igami, scored by Hirooki Ogawa and directed by Funatoko Sadao and T≈çru Toyama), run from 1964 and 1965. The New Samurai (Shin Onmitsu Kenshi) was originally aired in three story arcs on TBS between October 7, 1973 to March 31, 1974, however it failed to repeat the success of the first series. In Australia, where the first-run episodes of the new series replaced its predecessor on NWS-9 in January 1972, the new show was itself taken over just two weeks later by Josie and the Pussycats. The story of the second series is taking place in the turbulent Satsuma Domain in southern Ky≈´sh≈´. This time the main character is Kage Shinnosuke (ÂΩ±‰ø°‰πã‰ªã) (played by Shinichir≈ç Hayashi), the head of the Kage (Shadow) Ninja group, aided by a ninja girl Kanae (played by Mizue Shiratori), a boy named Daisaku (played by Hideki Ninomiya), and the returning Tonbei the Mist (played again by Maki) who has been sent to investigate the mysterious unrest there. Bin Amatsu also returned in his usual role of a villain, playing Togakure Genki, chieftain of the Black Tide band of ninja pirates. = 1973 series = The Samurai was revived in conjunction with Toei in October 1973 as a new, colour series starring Shinichi Ogishima as Shintar≈ç. As by this time Sadao Funatoko had died, the direction was given to his former assistant director, Akira Kikuchi. Traditionally, the head villain (the Akame ninja leader Gar≈ç Tess≈ç) was played by Amatsu and Maki was also cast in his usual role of Shintar≈ç's ninja companion, this time named Kayazaru (Ë≥ÄÂ§úÁåø), but otherwise the cast was new, including Ky≈çko Yoshizawa as Shintar≈ç's love interest and Masahide Yamada as his new boy sidekick. Two distinctively different seasons were made, each containing 13 episodes. The series began on TBS on October 7, 1973 under the title Onmitsu Kenshi in the style of the original show. However, due to the failing ratings, in its second story arc the series has been renamed as Onmitsu Kenshi: Tsuppashire! (Èö†ÂØÜÂâ£Â£´Á™Å„Å£Ëµ∞„ÇåÔºÅ) and pitted the hero against a variety of supernatural enemies such as demons, ghosts and dragons. Just as the previous attempt, this one also failed to achieve the success level of the original, and so the franchise's final episode was aired on March 31, 1974.

Age class structure in fisheries and wildlife management is a part of population assessment. Age class structures can be used to model many populations include trees and fish. This method can be used to predict the occurrence of forest fires within a forest population. Age can be determined by counting growth rings in fish scales, otoliths, cross-sections of fin spines for species with thick spines such as triggerfish,O‚ÄôSullivan, Sandra (2007).

Development of non-lethal methods for determining age and habitat use of sawfishes from northern Australia. Australia: Australian Department of the Environment and Energy. Each method has its merits and drawbacks. Fish scales are easiest to obtain, but may be unreliable if scales have fallen off the fish and new ones grown in their places.\\"MANUAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCE Part 2 - Methods of Resource Investigation and their Application\\". www.fao.org. Retrieved 2018-03-24. Fin spines may be unreliable for the same reason, and most fish do not have spines of sufficient thickness for clear rings to be visible. Otoliths will have stayed with the fish throughout its life history, but obtaining them requires killing the fish.Lux, Fred E. \\"Age Determination in Fishes\\". Washington, DC, United States: United States Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. Available at http://spo.nmfs.noaa.gov/Fishery%20Leaflets/leaflet488.pdf. Accessed 24/03/2018. Also, otoliths often require more preparation before ageing can occur. Analyzing fisheries age class structure An example of using age class structure to learn about a population is a regular bell curve for the population of 1-5 year-old fish with a very low population for the 3-year- olds. An age class structure with gaps in population size like the one described earlier implies a bad spawning year 3 years ago in that species[citation needed]. Often fish in younger age class structures have very low numbers because they were small enough to slip through the sampling nets, and may in fact have a very healthy population.Haines, Terry A.

Etymology The name Ilkhchi (also spelled as Ilkhichi and Ilkhechi) is a Turkic word consisting of two parts: 1-\\"Ilkhi\\" meaning wild horse, and 2-\\"chi\\" which is a grammatical suffix meaning \\"attributed to\\". Altogether, the complete name means horse tamer. That itself attests to the fact that in ancient eras this town was a place for horse domestication by Turkic residents. Similar variants of the words Ilkhichi or Ilkhi can be seen among other Turkic languages: For example, Yƒ±lkƒ± and Yƒ±lkƒ±cƒ± in Turkish, or –∂—ã–ª“õ—ã in Kazakh Language which is equivalent to Ilkhi.

She was the second daughter of Pedro I of Brazil and IV of Portugal and his first wife, Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria. Early life Dona Janu√°ria was born at the Imperial Palace of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o in Rio de Janeiro as an Infanta of Portugal during the reign of her grandfather John VI of Portugal. She was the second surviving daughter of Pedro, the Prince Royal of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves and Leopoldina, Archduchess of Austria after the birth of her older sister, Queen Maria II of Portugal, in 1819. Princess Janu√°ria grew up alongside her siblings Emperor Pedro II, Princess Paula and Princess Francisca. Her name was chosen by his father as a way of honoring the province of Rio de Janeiro. Janu√°ria, was born only one month after the death of her brother Jo√£o Carlos, Prince of Beira. She lost her mother at the age of four and saw her father leave for Kingdom of Portugal with his stepmother and his older sister at nine to fought the Liberal Wars. She grew up under extremely strict education. In 1833, Princess Paula Mariana died before she was 10 years old. Princess Januaria, through a letter, reported the event to her father: Beloved, Daddy. Despite our constant supplications to heaven, our dear sister Paula Mariana left. We found no consolation. Our beloved sister is no longer with us. In addition, little Pedro became seriously ill. We came to think that he had caught the same fever as Paula Mariana, but thank heavens he has improved and is already sitting in his study room. To express our gratitude, we, sister Chica and I, your daughter Janu√°ria, will not eat sugar until Pedro's birthday, December 2. Dear Dad, we are desperate and in great dismay. You miss us a lot and we also miss our sister Maria da Gl√≥ria and all those who are with you in Lisbon. With the promise of always being obedient and loving children, Januaria, Francisca and Pedro. Heiress  From 1835 until 1845, she held the title Princess Imperial of Brazil, as the heir presumptive of her brother Emperor Pedro II. When her sister Maria was excluded from the Brazilian line of succession by law no. 91 of 30 October 1835, Janu√°ria became heir presumptive to the throne of the Empire of Brazil. Her younger brother Pedro II was then a minor, and consideration was given to declaring her regent, though this never materialized. On August 4, 1836, Janu√°ria (then 14 years old) entered the hall of the palace of the Senate, wearing a rich gold dress on which was distinguished the insignia of the Grand Cross of the Imperial Order of the Southern Cross and, In the presence of the deputies, with his hand on the missal, solemnly declared in a moving voice: I swear to keep the Catholic, Apostolic, Roman religion; Observe the Political Constitution of the Brazilian Nation and be obedient to the laws and the Emperor. In this way, she became the Princess Imperial of Brazil (heir to the throne) until the birth of Prince Afonso, son of Pedro II. Marriage Janu√°ria with her sons Luigi and Filippo, c. 1857. The Count and Countess of Aquila (seated, left) with her younger brother Emperor Pedro II (right) and his wife Empress Teresa Cristina, c. 1871. As only a Brazilian member of the Imperial House could inherit the throne, it became critically important for marriages to be arranged for Janu√°ria Maria, Pedro II, and their sister Francisca. Spouses for both Janu√°ria and Pedro II were found in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Her marriage to Prince Louis of the Two Sicilies, Count of Aquila (brother of Pedro II's new wife, Empress Teresa Cristina) was celebrated on 28 April 1844 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Her husband was a son of Francis I of the Two Sicilies and his second wife, Maria Isabella of Spain. Friction developed between the Count of Aquila and the Emperor, and Janu√°ria Maria and Aquila were eventually permitted to leave Brazil in October 1844. In 1845, Janu√°ria Maria's position as heir presumptive, and the restrictions it entailed, was lost with the birth of Pedro II's first child, Afonso, Prince Imperial of Brazil. At the time of their marriage, according to article 2, it was guaranteed that even with the birth of the children of Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil the couple would enjoy the honor of being treated by His Imperial Highness. Art. II. As soon as the marriage takes place, His Royal Highness Prince Luiz Carlos Maria, Count of Aquila, husband of Her Imperial Highness the Princess Imperial of Brazil D.

He will take the title of Imperial Prince, who now belongs to his future Augusta Wife; When, however, His Majesty the Emperor has descendants, the two august spouses will take the title of Prince and Princess of Brazil, preserving with all the treatment of Imperial Highness. =Issue= Janu√°ria and Louis had six children: * Prince Luigi, Count of Roccaguglielma (18 July 1845 ‚Äì 27 November 1909).

Its commanders were Lt.Col. Jan W≈Çodarkiewicz (until 1942) and Lt.Col. Adam Remigiusz Grocholski. Originally formed in 1941, shortly after the outbreak (22 June 1941) of the Nazi-Soviet war, the organization was subordinate to ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej and bore the cryptonym 18, later changed to 27. The final name, Wachlarz, resulted from the subdivision of the organization into several branches, each trying to spread its influence from certain portions of the Polish border deep into Soviet territory. Wachlarz had five different sectors, each acting independently and formed along several main supply-lines of the German war-machine: # Lw√≥w- Tarnopol-Zhmerynka-Dnipropetrovsk # R√≥wne-Zhytomir-Kiev # Brze≈õƒá nad Bugiem- Pi≈Ñsk-Homel # Lida-Minsk-Borisov-Orsha # Wilno-Daugavpils-Polotsk The main aim of the organization was to prepare reconnaissance, intelligence, sabotage and diversion between the Eastern Front and the pre-war Polish borders, from the Baltic Sea to southern Ukraine. The organization was to be prepared to isolate the German front-lines by cutting the supply lines and disrupting troop movement during the planned pan-Polish national uprising. The aim was to separate the German army from its supply depots and to allow the Polish underground forces to liberate Poland while the Germans in the USSR were crushed both from the east and from the west. Operations Initially the unit was formed of officers of the Tajna Armia Polska organization, incorporated into the ZWZ in 1941. After its formation, the Armia Krajowa took the command over Wachlarz. Although at its height the organization had roughly 1000 highly trained members, most of whom were trained in commando warfare as the Cichociemni and after 1942 it carried over more than 100 major acts of sabotage, including the destruction of over 30 major supply depots,Based on Wachlarz operation map (p.205) from Iwo Cyprian Pogonowski, Poland a Historical Atlas, Hippocrene Books, 1987, its effectiveness was seriously hindered by both the Gestapo and the Soviet partisans. The most notable success was cutting all railway lines leading to and from Minsk in May 1942 and a similar action in Brze≈õƒá in August of the same year. Between December 1942 and February of the following year a large part of the 4th sector was arrested by the Gestapo.

Early life Ketchum was born on February 5, 1796 at Waterford in Saratoga County, New York. He was the fourth child of Amos Ketchum (1765‚Äì1835) and Arabella (n√©e Landon) Ketchum. Among his siblings were Mary Ketchum (wife of Dr. Samuel Akerly who founded the New York Institute for Special Education in 1831) and Hiram Ketchum. Career In 1832 he partnered with Thomas Rogers and Jasper Grosvenor to form the manufacturing firm of Rogers, Ketchum and Grosvenor; this firm eventually grew into Rogers Locomotive Works, the second most popular steam locomotive manufacturing company in North America. Ketchum was also a director of the Illinois Central Railroad. During his time on the board, he was able to funnel many of that railroad's locomotive orders to Rogers. p. 24. In the 1860s, he partnered with Peter Cooper, John Jacob Astor Jr., Hamilton Fish and others to form a new committee, the Special Council of Hygiene and Public Health. Joseph Smith served as president and Dr. Willard Parker was vice-president. Morris Ketchum, with his son Edward B. Ketchum, led the financial firm of Ketchum, Son and Company in New York City. His son Edward was later found to have embezzled nearly $2.5 million to cover his losses in the 1860s; it was Morris's good reputation that kept the public from suspecting Edward of embezzlement for a time. Morris had to resign as president of the Fourth National Bank of New York. =Later career= After giving up his fortune to make good on his sons forgeries in 1865, Ketchum moved south and became interested in the Savannah Banking and Trust Company of Savannah, Georgia and the Central Railroad. Personal life Ketchum was married three times. His later marriage was to Margaret Miller (1807‚Äì1893), a daughter of Judge Sylvanus Miller of Long Island. He was the father of three sons and two daughters that survived him, including: * Charles Jessup Ketchum (1839‚Äì1893) * Landon Ketchum (1842‚Äì1910), who married Ann Augusta Burritt (1842‚Äì1867), a daughter of Francis Burritt.

It lies south of London, north of Brighton, and east north east of the county town of Chichester. Nearby towns include Crawley to the north west and Haywards Heath to the south south east.  History  The name Balcombe may mean \\"Mining Place Camp\\". Bal is a Cornish word meaning a mining place as in Bal Maidens, and the same word may have existed in Ancient British Celtic. Although Coombe or Combe can mean a valley, it can also come from the Roman \\"camp\\". So possibly from its name Balcombe could have once been a Romano-British mining settlement. South of Balcombe on the London to Brighton railway line is the Ouse Valley Viaduct. Designed and engineered by John Urpeth Rastrick (1780‚Äì1856) in consultation with the talented architect David Mocatta, it was completed in 1842. It is high and 500 yards long. It has 37 arches and was built with 11 million imported Dutch bricks. The village has a series of murals about World War I in its Victory Hall. Lady Gertrude Denman commissioned artist Neville Lytton to paint the thirty-four feet (10 m) long by ten feet (3 m) high frescoes. The murals were featured on a television programme about the war in 2005. Balcombe was the birthplace of Colour Sergeant (later Lieutenant Colonel) Frank Bourne DCM, who fought at the battle of Rorke's Drift in the Zulu War. He was the last British survivor of that battle when he died in Dorking in 1945.Rorke's Drift, Adrian Greaves, Cassell, 2003, See also 1861 Census for Balcombe. Famous residents included actor Paul Scofield. The River Ouse was once navigable from the south coast to Balcombe, for the delivery of Dutch bricks to the viaduct. Landmarks =Listed buildings= Balcombe civil parish contains 59 listed buildings. Of these, two are Grade I, four are Grade II* and the remaining 53 buildings are Grade II. The Grade I listed buildings are: *The Parish Church of St Mary (List Entry Number 1354797) - see below. *Stone Hall (List Entry Number 1286412), a late C17 house. It was the dower-house of the Balcombe Place estate. The Grade II* buildings are: *Balcombe Place (List Entry Number 1025775), a Tudor style country House, built in 1856 by Henry Clutton for John Hankey of Naylands. *Kemp's House (List Entry Number 1192986), a late C17 house. *Edmund's Farmhouse (List Entry Number 1193049), a C15 timber-framed building, with a C16 wing added behind. *Ouse Valley Railway Viaduct (List Entry Number 1366101), designed by John Rastrick and David Mocatta; constructed in 1839‚Äì41. =Scheduled monuments= The parish contains no scheduled monuments. St Mary's Church St. Mary's church, Balcombe St Mary's Church is Balcombe's parish church, located to the north of the village, on London Road (B2036), at . The original church was built in the late 13th or early 14th century; it consisted of a chancel (now the south chapel) and a narrow nave (now the south aisle). The west tower, with a shingled broach spire, was added in the 15th century. The church was rebuilt in 1847‚Äì50, adding a north aisle (now the nave); and again in 1872‚Äì72, when the current north aisle and chancel were built. The church is built of local sandstone, with a Horsham Stone roof. The church is a Grade I listed building, listed for the tower (List Entry Number 1354797, first listed 28 October 1957). The church is in the Church of England Diocese of Chichester, Archdeaconry of Horsham. Rail transport The village has a railway station which lies just north of Haywards Heath on the Brighton Main Line. Balcombe railway station helped expand a predominantly farming community into one of the popular London commuter villages. The station offers direct services to London Victoria and Bedford, via London Bridge, and Brighton. To the north of the village is Balcombe tunnel. Oil exploration Test drilling and possible fracking for petroleum deposits was proposed in 2012. A protest group was formed and a picnic was held. There was considerable opposition in the local population to exploration plans. Cuadrilla Resources, the company that proposes to drill the well, engaged in public relations efforts attempting to convince villagers that the project was both useful and safe. Previous exploration by Conoco in the same area in 1986 was abandoned. In July 2013 a licence to drill the well was granted by the Environment Agency and Cuadrilla began transporting equipment and supplies to the test site. The well would be deep with a possible horizontal leg. As of August 2013 Balcombe had emerged as a focus of opposition to fracking in the Weald Basin of southeast England and vigorous protests were in progress. In March 2014, a group of residents set up a renewable energy co-operative called REPOWERBalcombe, with a view to healing the rifts that emerged during the protests. REPOWERBalcombe aims to match the village's domestic electricity demand with community owned solar power. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Balcombe was used as the location for Arthur Dent's house in the first episode of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) in May 1980. Dent wakes up to find bulldozers about to demolish his house. The show's producers said they spent two months searching for the ideal location, before finding the farmhouse at Edmonds Farm in Balcombe.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dwid0171bwhttps://medium.com/justin- k-prim/filming-locations-for-the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-and- more-8018c4fb9437 References  External links  * Balcombe History Society * Frack Free Balcombe Residents Association Villages in West Sussex Civil parishes in West Sussex Mid Sussex District ","title":"Balcombe"},{"id":"2855162","text":"Cave Hill can refer to: *Cave Hill, Saint Lucy, Barbados, a populated place *Cave Hill, Saint Michael, Barbados, a suburban area, home to a campus of University of the West Indies ","title":"Cave Hill, Barbados"},{"id":"2855163","text":"Some of the buildings in the FFCLRP facilities The Faculdade de Filosofia, Ci√™ncias e Letras de Ribeir√£o Preto (abbreviated FFCLRP, and also known as Fil√¥), is a liberal arts college (according to the French university tradition, in Brazil they nominate philosophy, sciences and letters as their undergraduate subjects, although some of these courses are not offered) of the University of S√£o Paulo campus at Ribeir√£o Preto, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. It was created in 1959, and incorporated into the University in 1974. The school offers undergraduate courses (bachelor's and licentiate degrees) in several different areas such as visual arts education, biology, chemistry, health informatics, library and information sciences, medical physics, mathematics applied to business, music, pedagogy and psychology. It also harbors graduate programs in areas such as applied computing, chemistry, comparative biology, education, entomology, physics applied to biology and medicine, psychobiology, and psychology. History The FFCLRP was created by a decree of the State Government of S√£o Paulo in October 1959, and its first activities began in March 1964. The official and definitive authorization came two years later, with a second governmental decree published in May 1966. Eventually, it was incorporated into the University of S√£o Paulo in 1974. The Biology, Psychology and Chemistry courses began in 1964, with the collaboration of the Medical School of Ribeir√£o Preto (FMRP), one of the medical schools of the University of S√£o Paulo. The FMRP provided not only rooms for the operation of the courses, but mainly staff and professors. The first director of the FFCLRP was a medical professor, Dr. Lucien Lison. Later, the FFCLRP built its own premises in Ribeir√£o Preto, which currently occupy an area of 40.499.59 m¬≤. Two characteristics were noteworthy at the beginning of the FFCLRP activities: the Propedeutic Cycle and the Course Conclusion Monograph. The Propedeutic Cycle was a one-year course comprising academic disciplines common to all courses. At the end of this cycle, each student should choose their respective area of specialty. Already at that time there was a concern with the basic interdisciplinary training of students, which would have a strong influence on their future research work. The students' preparation for scientific research was the second outstanding characteristic of the FFCLRP. Until 1971, students were required to develop research guided by one of the school professors. The results of these guided research acitivies were presented in the form of a monograph. Although the monograph was extinguished from the curricular structure as of 1972, the departments of Biology and Psychology and Education still maintain it as a requirement for the awarding of bachelor's or licentiate's degrees. In the Chemistry Department, the monograph was replaced by a 240-hour compulsory internship. In 2010, the University Council of the University of S√£o Paulo approved the restructuring of the Departments of the FFCLRP, which included the incorporation of the Department of Music, adding to a total of seven departments. =Former directors= * Lucien Alphonse Joseph Lison (1963-1969) * Ot√°vio Baracchini (1968-1968) * Geraldo Garcia Duarte (1978-1972) * Andr√© Ricciardi Cruz (1972-1976) * Renato H√©lios Migliorini (1977-1981) * Ernesto Giesbrecht (1981-1984) * Ronaldo Zucchi (1984-1988) * Andr√© Jacquemin (1988-1992) * Lionel Segui Gon√ßalves (1992-1996) * Jos√© Aparecido da Silva (1996-2000) * Oswaldo Baffa Filho (2000-2004) * Francisco de Assis Leone (2004-2008) * Sebasti√£o de Sousa Almeida (2008-2012) * Fernando Luis Medina Mantelatto (2012-2016) Departments Currently, the FFCLRP comprises seven departments: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science and Mathematics, Education, Information and Communication, Music, Psychology, and Physics.

Tsunamura‚Äôs succession led to the Date S≈çd≈ç or \\"Date Disturbance\\" of 1671, which has been retold in theatre, and has become one of the more well-known tales of unrest and disunity among the daimy≈ç of the Edo period. Biography Tsunamura was the eldest son of Date Tsunamune by a concubine. His childhood name was Kamechiyo-maru (‰∫ÄÂçÉ‰ª£‰∏∏). He was later styled , but his name was changed to Date Tsunamura during his genpuku ceremony, which was held by sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ietsuna. In later life, his courtesy title was Sakonoe-gon-sh≈çsh≈ç (General of the Left Guards) and Mutsu-no-kami and his Court rank was Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade. Tsunamura became daimy≈ç at the age of 2, when his father was relieved of his position due to political manipulations by his uncles, Date Munekatsu, daimy≈ç of Ichinoseki Domain and Date Masamune‚Äôs 10th son, and Tamura Muneyoshi, daimy≈ç of Iwanuma Domain.Turnbull, Stephen (1989). Samurai Warlords, London: Blandford Press, p. 117. From 1660 to 1671, the two uncles acted as guardians for the infant Tsunamura, usurping his authority and becoming notorious for their greed, corruption and misgovernment. The domain was beset by constant peasant rebellions and (according to popular history) Tsumanura narrowly avoided assassination by his uncles on several occasions. Events came to a head with the Date S≈çd≈ç, which also became a favorite theme of popular fiction, including bunraku and kabuki. Aki Muneshige, a relative from a cadet branch of the Date clan and retainer of Date Tsunamune managed to register a complaint to the shogunate officials about the mismanagement of the domain. Aki and various domain officials were summoned before the council of r≈çj≈´ and the Tair≈ç Sakai Tadakiyo. Testimony between Aki and the retainers of Munekatsu and Muneyoshi did not agree, and the testimony of Munekatsu‚Äôs retainer Harada Munesuke made a particularly poor impression. Harada then murdered Aki before further testimony could be given, before being killed himself by the guards. The court ruled in favor of Aki. Tsunamura was allowed to remain daimy≈ç; however, his uncles Munekatsu and Muneyoshi were removed from office.Sansom, George (1963). A History of Japan: 1615‚Äì1867 Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. p. 65. Once Tsunamura actually was able to exercise his own authority, one of his first actions was to order the construction of windbreaks and irrigation and flood control works on rivers. He also emphasized the study of Confucianism, bringing several noted scholars to Sendai, as well as sponsoring the construction of numerous Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. From 1689 to 1690 he assisted in the repair of the Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ along with Ii Naooki of Hikone Domain. Through these efforts, he gained the reputation of being a good ruler; however, the fiscal burden of all of these public works and temple building drove the domain into debt. In 1683, the domain issued a paper currency; however, with rampant inflation, the domain money was not well received. In 1693, his senior retainers had enough, and through senior clan members issued a petition to Tsunamura warning against rule by tyranny. Tsunamura was reportedly rendered speechless with rage, but was unable to gather support. In Autumn 1697, with no sign that he would voluntarily reign from office, his retainers plotted to have him forcibly placed into retirement, but no agreement could be reached. Tsunamura remained in office until 1703, when he resigned in favor of his cousin, Date Yoshimura, as he had no son by his wife (the daughter of Inaba Masanori). Tsunamura died in 1719, and his grave is at Dainenjiyama in Sendai, rather than the Date clan mausoleum. In 1924, he was posthumously elevated to Senior Third Rank.

Through her father, Emperor Dom Pedro I, she was a member of the Brazilian branch of the House of Braganza (Portuguese: Bragan√ßa) and was referred to using the honorific \\"Dona\\" (Lady) from birth. Her mother was the Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria, daughter of Franz II, the last Holy Roman Emperor. Through her, Francisca was a niece of Napoleon Bonaparte and first cousin of Emperors Napoleon II of France, Franz Joseph I (Francis Joseph I) of Austria-Hungary and Don Maximiliano I (Maximilian I) of Mexico. Francisca married Prince Fran√ßois of Orl√©ans, third son of Louis Philippe I and his Italian Queen Maria Amalia of Naples. Fran√ßois, called the Prince of Joinville, and Francisca married in Rio de Janeiro on 1 May 1843. The bride was 19, the groom 25. Her portrait was painted when she arrived in Paris, in 1844, by Ary Scheffer (coll. Mus√©e de la Vie romantique, Paris). Their only daughter Princess Fran√ßoise of Orl√©ans married her first cousin Prince Robert, Duke of Chartres and became the mother of the Orl√©anist pretender Prince Jean, Duke of Guise. Her son Pierre never married, but had two illegitimate children by a married woman. When the Orl√©ans family fled France, they settled in England living at Claremont; It was there that Francisca gave birth to a still born daughter in 1849; the next year, the exiled King Louis Philippe I died himself. After the fall of the House of Bonaparte of the Second Empire, the Orl√©ans family returned to France; Francisca herself died in Paris aged 73. Her husband outlived her by two years, dying in Paris in 1900.

In the 19th Century A. viridus, or green amaranth was an item of food in Australia. The botanist Joseph Maiden wrote in 1889: \\"It is an excellent substitute for spinach, being far superior to much of the leaves of the white beet sold for spinach in Sydney. Next to spinach it seems to be most like boiled nettle leaves, which when young are used in England, and are excellent. This amarantus should be cooked like spinach, and as it becomes more widely known, it is sure to be popular, except amongst persons who may consider it beneath their dignity to have anything to do with so common a weed.\\" Green amaranth also has clusters of nutty edible seeds, which can be eaten as snacks or used in biscuits. A porridge can be made by boiling the seeds in water. Unlike other amaranths, the seeds can be easily harvested by scraping the ripe spikes of seeds between the fingers.

Ornamental garden varieties sold under the latter name are either Amaranthus cruentus or a hybrid between A. cruentus and Amaranthus powellii. In indigenous agriculture, A. cruentus is the Central American counterpart to South American A. caudatus. During the Victorian era, specific flowers had different meanings. Love-lies-bleeding stood for hopeless love or hopelessness in the Victorian language of flowers.  Cultivation  A. caudatus can grow anywhere from in height, and grows best in full sunlight. It can handle a variety of conditions, both humid and arid. It is easily grown from seed. In most of its range, it is planted as a summer annual.

XL features programmer-reconfigurable syntax and semantics. Compiler plug-ins can be used to add new features to the language. A base set of plug-ins implements a relatively standard imperative language. Programmers can write their own plug- ins to implement application-specific notations, such as symbolic differentiation, which can then be used as readily as built-in language features. Language XL is defined at four different levels: * XL0 defines how an input text is transformed into a parse tree. * XL1 defines a base language with features comparable to C++. * XL2 defines the standard library, which includes common data types and operators. * XLR defines a dynamic runtime for XL based on XL0. XL has no primitive types nor keywords. All useful operators and data types, like integers or addition, are defined in the standard library (XL2). XL1 is portable between different execution environments. There is no such guarantee for XL2: if a particular CPU does not implement floating-point multiplication, the corresponding operator definition may be missing from the standard library, and using a floating-point multiply may result in a compile-time error. The Hello World program in XL looks like the following: use XL.TEXT_IO WriteLn \\"Hello World\\" An alternative form in a style more suitable for large-scale programs would be: import IO = XL.TEXT_IO IO.WriteLn \\"Hello World\\" A recursive implementation of factorial in XLR looks like the following: 0! -> 1 N! -> N * (N-1)! Syntax Syntax is defined at the XL0 level. The XL0 phase of the compiler can be configured using a syntax description file, where properties like the text representation and precedence of operators are defined. A basic syntax file defines common mathematical notations, like + for addition, with the usually accepted order of operations. The parse tree consists of 7 node types, 4 leaf node types (integer, real, text and symbol) and 3 internal node types (infix, prefix and block). * integer nodes represent an integer literal, such as \`2\`. The \`#\` sign can be used to specify a base other than 10, as in (\`2#1001\`). A separating underscore can be used to improve readability, as in \`1_000_000\`. * real nodes represent non-integral numbers, such as \`2.5\`. Based-notations and separators can be used, as for integer nodes, for example \`16#F.FFF#E-10\` is a valid real literal. * text nodes represent textual contents. They are normally surrounded by simple or double quotes, like \`\\"Hello\\"\` or \`'a'\`, but the syntax file can be used to add other separators, including for multi-line textual contents. * symbol nodes represent names or operators. Names are sequence of alphanumeric characters beginning with a letter, like \`Hello\`. XL0 preserves case, but XL1 ignores case and underscores, so that \`JohnDoe\` and \`john_doe\` are the same name. Operators are sequences of non-alphanumeric characters, like \`*\` or \`=/=\`. * infix nodes represent two nodes related by an infix symbol, like \`A+1\` or \`2 and 3\`. Infix nodes are in particular used to separate lines, with an infix \\"new-line\\" symbol. * prefix nodes represent two consecutive nodes, like \`Write \\"Hello\\"\`. It is also used for postfix notations, like \`3!\` or \`Open?\`. * block nodes represent a node surrounded by grouping symbols, like \`(A)\`, \`[Index]\`. Indentation is internally represented by a block node. With the default syntax file, the following is valid XL0, irrespective of any semantics. A = B + \\"Hello\\" It parses as: infix(\\"=\\", symbol(\\"A\\"), infix(\\"+\\", symbol(\\"B\\"), text(\\"Hello\\"))) Semantics of XL1  The XL1 phase is defined as a sequence of operations on the XL0 parse tree. These operations are provided by various compiler plug-ins, that are triggered based on the shape of the parse tree. Special constructs, \`translate\` and \`translation\`, are provided by a plug-in designed to facilitate the writing of other plug-ins. The \`quote\` construct generates a parse tree. Here is how these notations can be used to implement a plug-in called \`ZeroRemoval\` that eliminates superfluous additions and multiplications by zero. translation ZeroRemoval when 'X' + 0 then return X when 'X' * 0 then return parse_tree(0) A plug-in can be invoked on a whole file from the command line, or more locally in the source code using the pragma notation, as follows: X := {Differentiate} d(sin(omega * T) * exp(-T/T0)) / dT The XL1 phase contains a large set of plug-ins, notably \`XLSemantics\`, that provide common abstractions like subroutine, data type and variable declaration and definition, as well as basic structured programming statements, like conditionals or loops. =Type system= XL1 type checking is static, with generic programming abilities that are beyond those of languages like Ada or C++. Types like arrays or pointers, which are primitive in languages like C++, are declared in the library in XL. For instance, a one- dimensional array type could be defined as follows: generic [Item : type; Size : integer] type array A validated generic type is a generic type where a condition indicates how the type can be used. Such types need not have generic parameters. For instance, one can declare that a type is \`ordered\` if it has a less-than operator as follows: // A type is ordered if it has a less-than relationship generic type ordered if A, B : ordered Test : boolean := A < B It is then possible to declare a function that is implicitly generic because the type \`ordered\` itself is generic. // Generic function for the minimum of one item function Min(X : ordered) return ordered is ... compute Y of type ordered ... return Y This also applies to generic types that have parameters, such as \`array\`. A function computing the sum of the elements in any array can be written as follows: function Sum(A : array) return array.Item is for I in 0..array.Size-1 loop result += A[I] =Type-safe variable argument lists= Functions can be overloaded. A function can be declared to use a variable number of arguments by using \`...\` in the parameter list (historically, the keyword \`other\` was used for that purpose). In such a function, \`...\` can be used to pass the variable number of arguments to another subroutine, a feature now called Variadic templates: // Generic function for the minimum of N item function Min(X : ordered; ...) return ordered is result := Min(...) if X < result then result := X When such a function is called, the compiler recursively instantiates functions to match the parameter list: // Examples of use of the Min just declared X : real := Min(1.3, 2.56, 7.21) Y : integer := Min(1, 3, 6, 7, 1, 2) =Expression reduction: operator overloading= Operators can be defined using the \`written\` form of function declarations. Below is the code that would declare the addition of integers: function Add(X, Y: integer) return integer written X+Y Such written forms can have more than two parameters. For instance, a matrix linear transform can be written as: function Linear(A, B, C : matrix) return matrix written A+B*C A written form can use constants, and such a form is more specialized than a form without constants. For example: function Equal(A, B : matrix) return boolean written A=B function IsNull(A : matrix) return boolean written A=0 function IsUnity(A : matrix) return boolean written A=1 The mechanism is used to implement all basic operators. An expression is progressively reduced to function calls using written forms. For that reason, the mechanism is referred to as expression reduction rather than operator overloading. =Iterators= XL iterators allow programmers to implement both generators and iterators. import IO = XL.UI.CONSOLE iterator IntegerIterator (var out Counter : integer; Low, High : integer) written Counter in Low..High is Counter := Low while Counter <= High loop yield Counter += 1 // Note that I needs not be declared, because declared 'var out' in the iterator // An implicit declaration of I as an integer is therefore made here for I in 1..5 loop IO.WriteLn \\"I=\\", I Development status and history XL is the result of a long language design work that began around 1992. The language was designed and implemented primarily by Christophe de Dinechin. Historically, the XL compiler was written in C++. It had achieved a point where most of the features described above worked correctly, but writing plug-ins was a nightmare, because C++ itself is not extensible, so implementing \`translate\`-like statements was impossible. The parse tree was more complicated, with dozens of node types, because it was designed for cross-language support. Moka was a Java-to-Java extensible compiler using the same infrastructure. Abandoning the cross-language objectives and complex parse-tree structure, a complete rewrite of the compiler was started in 2003. The parse tree was vastly simplified down to the seven XL0 nodes types now in use. This new compiler bootstrapped in 2004, and all new development is now written in XL. However, this new compiler still has somewhat incomplete XL1 support, although its abilities already exceed C++ in a few areas. =Ancestry= XL1 was inspired by a large number of other languages. In alphabetical order: * Ada inspired some of large-scale program support, exception handling, tasking, and supportability aspects. * BASIC the more modern variants that dispense of line numbers and support structured programming, showed how simple the syntax of a programming language could be. * C was used as the standard to expect in terms of runtime and machine-level support. XL will not require a virtual machine to run. * C++ and the standard template library demonstrated the need for good support of generic types, including implicit instantiation of generics (which Ada lacks). * Fortran's continued performance lead over C and C++ for numerical-intensive applications helped identify which language constructs would prevent useful optimizations. * Java demonstrated the importance of a large, portable support library. Java containers also showed the limitations of an approach not based on generic programming. Interfacing with Java code remains an interesting challenge for XL. * Lisp extensibility was considered as a key factor in its survival and relevance to this day. Lisp was the first language to normalize object- oriented features, despite having been designed years before object-oriented ideas were invented. * Prolog demonstrated that alternative programming models are sometimes useful and highly productive. Every effort was made to ensure that a Prolog-style plug-in could be written for XL. * Visual Basic showed how the parse tree representation can be dissociated from its visual presentation. Few people edit VB Forms textually. It is expected that XL edit-time plug-ins will one day provide similar abilities, by directly manipulating the parse tree. Semantics XLR is a dynamic language, originally intended as a back- end for the XL1 compiler, hence the name, which stands for XL runtime. It shares the basic XL0 syntax with XL1, but its behavior is much closer to a functional language, whereas XL1 is intended to look mostly like an imperative language. XLR has practically only one built-in operator, \\"->\\", which denotes a rewrite. The notation on the left of the rewrite is transformed into the notation on the right of the rewrite. This mechanism is used to implement standard notations: if true then TrueBody else FalseBody -> TrueBody if false then TrueBody else FalseBody -> FalseBody The XL programming language uses a programming approach focusing on how concepts, that live in the programmer's mind, translate into representations that are found in the code space.  Pseudo-metrics  Concept programming uses pseudo-metrics to evaluate the quality of code. They are called pseudo-metrics because they relate the concept space and the code space, with a clear understanding that the concept space cannot be formalized strictly enough for a real metric to be defined. Concept programming pseudo-metrics include: * Syntactic noise measures discrepancies between the concept and the syntax used to represent it. For instance, the semi-colon at the end of statements in C can be considered as syntactic noise, because it has no equivalent in the concept space. * Semantic noise measures discrepancies between the expected meaning or behavior of the concept and its actual meaning or behavior in the code. For instance, the fact that integer data types overflow (when mathematical integers do not) is a form of semantic noise. * Bandwidth measures how much of the concept space a given code construct can represent. For instance, the overloaded addition operator in C has higher bandwidth than the \`Add\` instruction in assembly language, because the C operator can represent addition on floating-point numbers and not just integer numbers. * Signal/noise ratio measures what fraction of the code space is used for representing actual concepts, as opposed to implementation information.  Rule of equivalence, equivalence breakdown  The rule of equivalence is verified when the code behavior matches the original concept. This equivalence may break down in many cases. Integer overflow breaks the equivalence between the mathematical integer concept and the computerized approximation of the concept. Many ways to break the equivalence have been given specific names, because they are very common: * A domain error is a condition where code executes outside of the domain of equivalence, which is the domain where the concept and the implementation match. An integer overflow is an example of domain error. * A concept cast (also concept recast or concept recasting) is a rewrite of a concept as a different concept because the original concept cannot be represented by the tools. In C, using pointers for output arguments because C doesn't support output arguments explicitly is an example of concept cast. * A priority inversion is a form of syntactic or semantic noise introduced by some language-enforced general rule. It is called a priority inversion because the language takes precedence over the concept. In Smalltalk, everything is an object, and that rule leads to the undesirable consequence that an expression like 2+3*5 doesn't obey the usual order of operations (Smalltalk interprets this as sending the message * to the number resulting from 2+3, which yields result 25 instead of 17).  Methodology  To write code, concept programming recommends the following steps: # Identify and define the relevant concepts in the concept space. # Identify traditional notations for the concepts, or invent usable notations. # Identify a combination of programming constructs that allows the concepts to be represented comfortably in code - That includes finding a code notation that matches the notation identified in the previous step as closely as possible. # Write code that preserves, as much as possible, the expected behavior and semantics of the relevant aspects of the original concept. Many programming tools often lack in notational abilities, thus concept programming sometimes requires the use of preprocessors, domain- specific languages, or metaprogramming techniques.  Languages  XL is the only programming language known to date to be explicitly created for concept programming, but concept programming can be done in nearly any language, with varying degrees of success. Lisp and Forth (and their derivatives) are examples of pre-existing languages which lend themselves well to concept programming. Similar works There are projects that exploit similar ideas to create code with higher level of abstraction.

It goes by the common name of tropical amaranth. polygonoides ","title":"Amaranthus polygonoides"},{"id":"2855244","title":"Nimmi"},{"id":"2855245","text":"Amaranthus palmeri is a species of edible flowering plant in the amaranth genus. It has several common names, including carelessweed, dioecious amaranth, Palmer's amaranth, Palmer amaranth, and Palmer's pigweed. It is native to most of the southern half of North America. Populations in the eastern United States are probably naturalized. It has also been introduced to Europe, Australia, and other areas. The plant is fast-growing and highly competitive. Uses Amaranth muesli mix The leaves, stems and seeds of Palmer amaranth, like those of other amaranths, are edible and highly nutritious. Palmer amaranth was once widely cultivated and eaten by Native Americans across North America, both for its abundant seeds and as a cooked or dried green vegetable. Other related Amaranthus species have been grown as crops for their greens and seeds for thousands of years in Mexico, South America, the Caribbean, Africa, India, and China. The plant can be toxic to livestock animals due to the presence of nitrates in the leaves. Palmer amaranth has a tendency to absorb excess soil nitrogen, and if grown in overly fertilized soils, it can contain excessive levels of nitrates, even for humans. Like spinach and many other leafy greens, amaranth leaves also contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful to individuals with kidney problems if consumed in excess. Because of its toxicity to livestock, and scarce familiarity in the United States with the uses of amaranths as food, Palmer amaranth is rarely consumed as of 2020, despite its ubiquity and resistance to drought. Unlike the grain and leaf amaranths of other regions, it has not been cultivated or further improved by recent agricultural breeding. As a result, the primary economic importance of Palmer amaranth to American farmers has been as a noxious weed and a competitor to more marketable crops, rather than as a crop in its own right. As a weed Palmer amaranth is considered a threat most specifically to the production of cotton and soybean crops in the southern United States. In many places, the plant has developed resistance since at least 2006 to glyphosate, a widely used broad-spectrum herbicide. Glyphosate-resistant pigweed not only dominates in cotton fields, but also has wide-ranging effects on other crops and productions. In 2001, Palmer amaranth was found in the southern quarter of Illinois and appeared to be moving to northern Illinois in 2006. In 2014, the Texas Department of Agriculture asked the United States Environmental Protection Agency for permission to use the restricted chemical herbicide propazine on 3 million acres (1.2 million hectares) of cotton threatened by Palmer amaranth. The request was denied due to unacceptable risks to drinking water. In 2019, Kansas State University researchers documented a population of Palmer amaranth with resistance to 2,4-D and Dicamba in Kansas. Previously, Palmer amaranth in Kansas has developed resistance to ALS, atrazine, glyphosate and HPPD herbicides‚Äîmesotrione, Huskie, Laudis, Impact, and Armezon‚Äîleaving growers with very few postemergence options to manage this weed. =Growth= Palmer amaranth may be the most aggressive pigweed species with respect to growth rate and competitive ability. Palmer amaranth in particular is highly competitive. It will outgrow cotton and is much more efficient. Growers of crops have not been able to provide adequate moisture to offset prolonged temperatures above 85 ¬∞F with 112 ¬∞F heat indices. In these conditions, many herbicides break down over time and Palmer amaranth will keep thrusting. It can grow from 2 to 5 inches (51‚Äì127 mm) in three days, or less. In only a few weeks, it can grow from 12 to 18 in (305‚Äì457 mm) compared to cotton at 5 to 8 in. (127‚Äì203 mm). =Spread= Pollen is most commonly spread by wind. The male produces the pollen and the female plant produces the seed. The wind carries the pollen from resistant male plants to female plants. In addition, the seed is spread by traditional means, such as harvesting, inadequate cleaning of equipment, and the spreading of infested materials, such as manure.

In 1940 the Glasgow Company was absorbed into the newly raised 12th AA Divisional Signals, and in 1941 the remainder was converted into a mixed unit. In 1942 AA Command was reorganised and the unit was amalgamated into 6th AA Group (Mixed) Signals, covering Scotland and North East England. Following demobilisation in 1945 it was reformed in 1947 with two companies in Edinburgh and two in Glasgow. It was known as 13th AA (Mixed) Signal Regiment TA, part of 3rd Anti-Aircraft Group. In 1955 when AA Command was abolished the regiment was converted into Scottish Command (Mixed) Signal Regiment TA (part of Scottish Command).

In particular, there are several physical and practical limits to the amount of computation or data storage that can be performed with a given amount of mass, volume, or energy. Hardware physical limits = Processing and memory density = * The Bekenstein bound limits the amount of information that can be stored within a spherical volume to the entropy of a black hole with the same surface area. * Thermodynamics limit the data storage of a system based on its energy, number of particles and particle modes. In practice, it is a stronger bound than the Bekenstein bound. = Processing speed = * Bremermann's limit is the maximum computational speed of a self-contained system in the material universe, and is based on mass-energy versus quantum uncertainty constraints. = Communication delays = * The Margolus‚ÄìLevitin theorem sets a bound on the maximum computational speed per unit of energy: 6 √ó 1033 operations per second per joule. This bound, however, can be avoided if there is access to quantum memory. Computational algorithms can then be designed that require arbitrarily small amounts of energy/time per one elementary computation step. = Energy supply = * Landauer's principle defines a lower theoretical limit for energy consumption: consumed per irreversible state change, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the operating temperature of the computer. Reversible computing is not subject to this lower bound. T cannot, even in theory, be made lower than 3 kelvins, the approximate temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation, without spending more energy on cooling than is saved in computation. However, on a timescale of 109 - 1010 years, the cosmic microwave background radiation will be decreasing exponentially, which will make it possible to eventually get 1030 as much computations per unit of energy. Building devices that approach physical limits Several methods have been proposed for producing computing devices or data storage devices that approach physical and practical limits: * A cold degenerate star could conceivably be used as a giant data storage device, by carefully perturbing it to various excited states, in the same manner as an atom or quantum well used for these purposes. Such a star would have to be artificially constructed, as no natural degenerate stars will cool to this temperature for an extremely long time. It is also possible that nucleons on the surface of neutron stars could form complex \\"molecules\\", which some have suggested might be used for computing purposes, creating a type of computronium based on femtotechnology, which would be faster and denser than computronium based on nanotechnology. * It may be possible to use a black hole as a data storage or computing device, if a practical mechanism for extraction of contained information can be found. Such extraction may in principle be possible (Stephen Hawking's proposed resolution to the black hole information paradox). This would achieve storage density exactly equal to the Bekenstein bound. Seth Lloyd calculated the computational abilities of an \\"ultimate laptop\\" formed by compressing a kilogram of matter into a black hole of radius 1.485 √ó 10‚àí27 meters, concluding that it would only last about 10‚àí19 seconds before evaporating due to Hawking radiation, but that during this brief time it could compute at a rate of about 5 √ó 1050 operations per second, ultimately performing about 1032 operations on 1016 bits (~1 PB). Lloyd notes that \\"Interestingly, although this hypothetical computation is performed at ultra- high densities and speeds, the total number of bits available to be processed is not far from the number available to current computers operating in more familiar surroundings.\\" * In The Singularity is Near, Ray Kurzweil cites the calculations of Seth Lloyd that a universal-scale computer is capable of 1090 operations per second. The mass of the universe can be estimated at 3 √ó 1052 kilograms. If all matter in the universe was turned into a black hole, it would have a lifetime of 2.8 √ó 10139 seconds before evaporating due to Hawking radiation. During that lifetime such a universal-scale black hole computer would perform 2.8 √ó 10229 operations. Abstract limits in computer science In the field of theoretical computer science the computability and complexity of computational problems are often sought-after. Computability theory describes the degree to which problems are computable, whereas complexity theory describes the asymptotic degree of resource consumption. Computational problems are therefore confined into complexity classes. The arithmetical hierarchy and polynomial hierarchy classify the degree to which problems are respectively computable and computable in polynomial time. For instance, the level Sigma^0_0=Pi^0_0=Delta^0_0 of the arithmetical hierarchy classifies computable, partial functions. Moreover, this hierarchy is strict such that at any other class in the arithmetic hierarchy classifies strictly uncomputable functions. =Loose and tight limits= Many limits derived in terms of physical constants and abstract models of computation in computer science are loose. Very few known limits directly obstruct leading-edge technologies, but many engineering obstacles currently cannot be explained by closed-form limits.

Fluvio-glacial refers to the meltwater created when a glacier melts. Fluvio-glacial processes can occur on the surface and within the glacier. The deposits that happen within the glacier are revealed after the entire glacier melts or partially retreats. Fluvio-glacial landforms and erosional surfaces include: outwash plains, kames, kame terraces, kettle holes, eskers, varves, and proglacial lakes.  Landforms  = Outwash Plain = An outwash plain is both an erosional and depositional surface created by meltwater coming from the glacier. These plains are found in front of the glaciers and are typically characterized by small braided streams. The streams are usually small and braided because the sediment size varies and the original stream gets broken up. Since these streams meander around, the erosion happens laterally (left to right) instead of vertically (up and down). These plains are usually found beyond the end moraine deposited by the glacier. = Kame and Kame Terrace = Kames are small hills that consist of sediments ranging from sands to gravels. Intraglacial movement of water carries sediments and deposits them inside cavities, or holes, in the glacier; once the glacier melts or retreats, the kames is left behind as a deposit. These hills can range in size and be up to 50 m tall and 400 m wide. A kame terrace is a relatively flat surface of sediment that was deposited between the valley surface and the glacier. When kames, kame surfaces, and other fluvio-glacial landforms are combined into one landscape, it is called a kame complex or glacial karst topography. = Kettle Holes = Kettle holes are typically formed when a chunk of ice that came from the glacier is buried under fluvio-glacial sediments. Once the ice melts, the sediments fall and form a depression that can later be filled with rainwater and form kettle lakes. Kettle holes can often be found in the outwash plain of a glacier. Kettle holes can be anywhere from 5 m to 30 km wide. = Eskers = Eskers can be describes as long, curved ridges made up of sands and gravels. These surfaces were created by intraglacial streams carrying and depositing sediments as they flow through the glacier. These landforms can range from 100 m to 500 km long and 3 m to 200 m tall. = Varves = Varves are a depositional feature of a fluvio-glacial movement. They are layers of annular sediment deposits. The sizes of the sediments vary and depend on the volume of the streams, but are usually associated with mud deposits (silt and clay). The color and amount of the sediment deposited also varies depending upon the season; summer deposits typically have larger volumes of deposition and are characterized as being light, whereas winter deposits are usually the opposite. Winter deposits are fairly uncommon because the water is frozen into ice again. = Proglacial Lakes = Proglacial lakes form as meltwater trapped behind a glacial feature such as an end moraine. These lakes have an intake of sediment deposited by streams within the glacier and their deposits are recorded within the varves.

Ch√¢teau de Clermont, now in the commune of Chirens. Clermont- Tonnerre is a French noble family, members of which played some part in the history of France, especially in Dauphin√©, from about 1100 to the French Revolution (1789‚Äì99). Sibaud, lord of Clermont in Viennois, who first appears in 1080, was the founder of the family. His descendant, another Sibaud, commanded some troops which aided Pope Calixtus II in his struggle with the Antipope Gregory VIII. In return for this service, it is said that the pope allowed him to add certain emblems, two keys and a tiara to the arms of his family. A direct descendant, Ainard (died 1349), called Viscount of Clermont, was granted the dignity of captain-general and first baron of Dauphin√© by his suzerain Humbert, dauphin of Viennois, in 1340; and in 1547 Clermont was made a county for Antoine (died 1578), who was governor of Dauphin√© and the French king's lieutenant in Savoy. In 1572, Antoine's son Henri was created a duke, but as this was only a brevet title it did not descend to his son. Henri was killed before La Rochelle in 1573. In 1596 Henri's son, Charles Henri, count of Clermont (died 1640), added Tonnerre to his heritage; but in 1648 this county was sold by his son and successor, Fran√ßois (died 1679). A member of a younger branch of Charles Henri's descendants was Gaspard de Clermont-Tonnerre (1688‚Äì1781). This soldier served his country during a long period, fighting in Bohemia and Alsace, and then distinguishing himself greatly at the battles of Fontenoy and Lawfeldt. In 1775, he was created Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre, and made a peer of France. As the senior marshal (c. 1747) of France, he assisted as constable at the coronation of Louis XVI in 1774. His son and successor, Charles Henri Jules, governor of Dauphin√©, was guillotined in July 1794, a fate which his grandson, Gaspard Charles, had suffered at Lyon in the previous year. A later duke, Aim√© Marie Gaspard (1770‚Äì1865), served for some years as a soldier, afterwards becoming minister of marine and then minister of war under Charles X, and retiring to private life after the revolution of 1830. Aim√©'s grandson, Roger, duke of Clermont-Tonnerre, was born in 1842. Fran√ßois de Clermont-Tonnerre (1629‚Äì1701) Among other distinguished members of this family was Catherine (c. 1545 ‚Äì 1603), daughter of Claude de Clermont-Tonnerre. This lady, dame d'honneur to Henry II's queen, Catherine de' Medici, and afterwards wife of Albert de Gondi, duc de Retz, won a great reputation by her intellectual attainments, being referred to as the tenth muse and the fourth grace. One of her grandsons was the famous Cardinal de Retz. Other noteworthy members of collateral branches of the family were: Fran√ßois (1629‚Äì1701), bishop of Noyon from 1661 until his death, a member of the French Academy, notorious for his inordinate vanity; Stanislas Marie Adelaide, comte de Clermont-Tonnerre; and Anne Antoine Jules (1749‚Äì1830), cardinal and bishop of Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, who was a member of the states-general in 1789, afterwards retiring to Germany, and after the return of the Bourbons to France became Archbishop of Toulouse. In addition, Aim√© Marie Gaspard de Clermont-Tonnerre was Minister of War during the last days of the Bourbon Restoration, in the cabinet of the Count de Vill√®le (see fr:Aim√© Marie Gaspard de Clermont- Tonnerre).

It is still the designated Church of the city council of Rome, which uses the ancient title of Senatus Populusque Romanus. The present Cardinal Priest of the Titulus Sanctae Mariae de Aracoeli is Salvatore De Giorgi. Interior of the church. Fresco of Madonna and the Child by Pietro Cavallini. The shrine is known for housing relics belonging to Saint Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine, various minor relics from the Holy Sepulchre, both the canonically crowned images of Nostra Signora di Mano di Oro di Aracoeli (1636) on the high altar and the Santo Bambino of Aracoeli (1897).  History  Originally the church was named Sancta Maria in Capitolio, since it was sited on the Capitoline Hill (Campidoglio, in Italian) of Ancient Rome; by the 14th century it had been renamed. A medieval legend included in the mid-12th-century guide to Rome, Mirabilia Urbis Romae, claimed that the church was built over an Augustan Ara primogeniti Dei, in the place where the Tiburtine Sibyl prophesied to Augustus the coming of the Christ. \\"For this reason the figures of Augustus and of the Tiburtine sibyl are painted on either side of the arch above the high altar\\" (Lanciani chapter 1). A later legend substituted an apparition of the Virgin Mary.Lang, Peter. \\"Santa Maria in Aracoeli\\", University of Washington In The History of Money, anthropologist Jack Weatherford goes into some detail about the church's previous incarnation as the temple of Juno Moneta‚Äîon the Arx‚Äîafter whom Money is named. > According to Roman historians, in the fourth century B.C., the irritated > honking of the sacred geese around Juno's temple on Capitoline Hill warned > the people of an impending night attack by the Gauls, who were secretly > scaling the walls of the citadel.

Centuries ago, church architects incorporated the ruins > of the ancient temple into the new building. The church is also thought to have replaced the auguraculum, the seat of the augurs. The foundation of the church was laid on the site of a Byzantine abbey mentioned in 574. Many buildings were built around the first church; in the upper part they gave rise to a cloister, while on the slopes of the hill a little quarter and a market grew up. Remains of these buildings - such as the little church of San Biagio de Mercato and the underlying \\"Insula Romana\\") - were discovered in the 1930s. At first the church followed the Greek rite, a sign of the power of the Byzantine exarch. Taken over by the papacy by the 9th century, the church was given first to the Benedictines, then, by papal bull to the Franciscans in 1249‚Äì1250; under the Franciscans it received its Romanesque-Gothic aspect. The arches that divide the nave from the aisles are supported on columns, no two precisely alike, scavenged from Roman ruins. Ceiling. During the Middle Ages, this church became the centre of the religious and civil life of the city. in particular during the republican experience of the 14th century, when self-proclaimed Tribune and reviver of the Roman Republic Cola di Rienzo inaugurated the monumental stairway of 124 steps in front of the church, designed in 1348 by Simone Andreozzi, on the occasion of the Black Death. Condemned criminals were executed at the foot of the steps; there Cola di Rienzo met his death, near the spot where his statue commemorates him. In 1571, Santa Maria in Aracoeli hosted the celebrations honoring Marcantonio Colonna after the victorious Battle of Lepanto over the Turkish fleet. Marking this occasion, the compartmented ceiling was gilded and painted (finished 1575), to thank the Blessed Virgin for the victory. In 1797, with the Roman Republic, the basilica was deconsecrated and turned into a stable.  Interior  Central fresco by Pinturicchio in the S. Bernardino Chapel (1486). The original unfinished fa√ßade has lost the mosaics and subsequent frescoes that originally decorated it, save a mosaic in the tympanum of the main door, one of three doors that are later additions. The Gothic window is the main detail that tourists can see from the bottom of the stairs, but it is the sole truly Gothic detail of the church. The church is built as a nave and two aisles that are divided by Roman columns, all different, taken from diverse antique monuments. Among its numerous treasures are Pinturicchio's 15th-century frescoes depicting the life of Saint Bernardino of Siena in the Bufalini Chapel, the first chapel on the right. Other features are the wooden ceiling, the inlaid cosmatesque floor, a Transfiguration painted on wood by Girolamo Siciolante da Sermoneta, and works by other artists like Pietro Cavallini (of his frescoes only one survives), Benozzo Gozzoli and Giulio Romano. Madonna Aracoeli It houses also Madonna Aracoeli (Our Lady of the Golden Hands), (Byzantian icon, the 10-11th-century) in the Altar. This Marian image was Pontifically crowned on 29 March 1636 by Pope Urban VIII. Pope Pius XII consecrated the people of Rome to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary and her Immaculate Heart in front of this image in 1948, May 30. In the transept there is a sepulchral monument by Arnolfo di Cambio. The church was also famous in Rome for the wooden statue of the Santo Bambino of Aracoeli, carved in the 15th century of olive wood coming from the Gethsemane garden and covered with valuable ex-votos. Many people of Rome believed in the power of this statue. It had been taken by the French in 1797, was later recovered, yet stolen again in February 1994.

It was the home of United States founding father and U.S. president John Adams and First Lady Abigail Adams, and of U.S. president John Quincy Adams and his First Lady, Louisa Adams. It is now part of the Adams National Historical Park. The Stone Library requested by John Quincy Adams is directly next door. It was built by John Quincy's son Charles, a Peacefield resident, after the deaths of the two presidents. History Peacefield was the home and farm of John Adams and his wife, Abigail Smith Adams. Later, it was also the home of John Quincy Adams, his wife Louisa Catherine Adams, their son Charles Francis Adams, and Charles' sons, historians Henry Adams and Brooks Adams. The oldest portion of the house was built in 1731 by Leonard Vassall, a sugar-planter from Jamaica, and acquired by John and Abigail Adams in 1787 after its loyalist owners had abandoned Massachusetts during the Revolutionary War. The Adams were at that time still resident in London, but returned in 1788 to occupy the house and its of farmland and orchards. They were disagreeably surprised by the house, however, after their years in England. The house at that time consisted of only two low-ceilinged rooms on the ground floor, two bedrooms, and an attic. Abigail Adams wrote \\"it feels like a wren's nest.\\" During the subsequent 12 years, with Adams resident in Philadelphia first as Vice President and then as President, Abigail Adams attended to the house and farm. She greatly expanded it, adding what is now the right side of the front facade, with a fine hallway and large parlor on the ground floor and a large study above. The additions were built in the Georgian style with a gambrel roof creating a nearly full attic story. Adams returned to the house full-time in 1801 after his defeat for a second presidential term. His son John Quincy Adams also returned to the house at that time, after completing his ambassadorial term in Berlin. Further extensions to the house were made by his son, Charles Francis Adams.

() is one of Hong Kong's three radio broadcasting corporations. It was founded on 1 July 1991, and is owned by the Hong Kong-listed Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited and Hutchison Whampoa Limited now. Services Metro Broadcast operates three radio channels: Metro Finance (FM104), Metro Info (FM99.7), Metro Plus (AM 1044, the only English channel). The company also offered Metro Finance Digital (DAB+), Metro Music Digital (DAB+) and Metro Life Digital (DAB+) until the company announced its intention to return its digital audio broadcasting license in September 2016. The digital audio broadcasting license was terminated in November that same year. Metro also offers multimedia broadcasting service through mobile phones, via the mobile phone service provider 3 Mobile. In addition, Metro offers eSHOP, an online shopping website. In 2003, the Hong Kong Government renewed Metro's broadcasting license for 12 years, with the renewal taking effect in 2004. The license was renewed for a further 12 years on March 22, 2016, with the extension taking effect on August 25 of the same year. History In 1990 the Hong Kong government reformed radio broadcasting regulations, allowing the introduction of a third radio station. It released the license to Metro Radio. In 1991 Metro Radio set up its headquarters in Site 11 Whampoa Garden in Hunghom, Kowloon (È¶ôÊ∏Ø‰πùÈæçÁ¥ÖÁ£°ÈªÉÂüîËä±Âúí Á¨¨ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÊúü). At that time, Metro Radio had two Chinese channels- channel FM99.7 (ÂãÅÊ≠åÂè∞) and channel FM104 (ÈáëÊõ≤Âè∞) and an English channel - AM 1044 (Metro News). In 1994 Philip Chan Yan Kin (ÈôàÊ¨£ÂÅ•) took over as General Manager and revised many of its programs. In 1996 Metro Radio carried out a strategic shift of focus from news services to entertainment. The names of channel FM99.7 (ÂãÅÊ≠åÂè∞) and channel FM104 (ÈáëÊõ≤Âè∞) were changed to Hit Radio (Êñ∞Âüé997) and FM Select (Á≤æÈÅ∏104) respectively, and Metro News became Metro Plus. In the same year, Chan Hoi-kei (Èô≥Êµ∑Áê™) resigned as leader, and was replaced by Bak wan- kam (ÁôΩÈüªÁê¥). In 1997 due to an expansion, the head office of Metro Radio moved to Basement 2 Site 6 Whampoa Garden, Hunghom, Kowloon (È¶ôÊ∏Ø‰πùÈæçÁ¥ÖÁ£°ÈªÉÂüîËä±ÂúíÁ¨¨ÂÖ≠ÊúüÂú∞Â∫´‰∫åÂ±§).

In 2004 Metro Radio expanded its broadcasting in the Pearl River Delta by entering into a shared programming agreement with Radio Guangdong (Âª£Êù±ÈõªÂè∞). On 2 January 2008, Metro Showbiz was renamed to Metroinfo (Êñ∞ÂüéÁü•Ë®äÂè∞). Metroinfo broadcast both entertainment and financial programs.

Early life and career Born in Mandres-aux-Quatre-Tours in the Duchy of Bar, Stanislas is the eldest son of Fran√ßois-Joseph, marquis de Clermont-Tonnerre (1726-1809) and his first wife, Mary Anne de Lentilhac de Gimel, and the grandson of Gaspard, duc de Clermont-Tonnerre (1688-1781), marshal of France. Following in the family tradition, he became colonel of the 1st Cuirassier Regiment. In 1782, he married Mary Louise Josephine Delphine de Rosi√®res de Sorans (December 1766 - October 26, 1832, Paris), lady-in-waiting to Princess √âlisabeth of France; the sister of Louis XVI. She bore him three children, of whom only the eldest daughter survived into adulthood, marrying Esprit Louis Charles Alexandre Savary de Lancosme (1784-1853) in 1803. Prior to the beginning of the French Revolution he was a Freemason, a noted orator (having acquired practice in speaking in the Masonic Lodge), and a Liberal. He spent time with reformists such as Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave and Jacques Pierre Brissot outside of the Assembly as they all shared the common interest of keeping the monarchy in place. French Revolution He was elected to the Estates-General of 1789 by the Second Estate of Paris, and was the spokesman of the minority of Liberal nobles (including the duc d'Orl√©ans and the marquis de Lafayette) who joined the Third Estate on the 25th of June. In July 1789, Stanislas wrote and shared two propositions based on varying cahiers from across the Assembly, one known as the Rapport du Comit√© de Constitution. Both liberals and conservatives alike felt the proposals were not rooted in the best interest of either faction. He was chiefly concerned with keeping the kingdom intact, yet he voted for the motion of the vicomte de Noailles to abolish feudalism in France 4‚Äì5 August 1789. Clermont-Tonnerre desired to model the new constitution of France on the organic laws of England. He served on the first incarnation (established 17 July 1789) of the eight-member Constitutional Committee. When the National Assembly rejected its proposals for a bicameral legislature and an absolute veto for the Crown (10‚Äì11 September 1789), he resigned along with five fellow conservatives (including Jean Joseph Mounier). For the remainder of his tenure in the National Assembly he attached himself to the party of moderate Royalists, known as monarchi gens, led by Pierre Victor, baron Malouet. He was twice elected president of the National Constituent Assembly in rapid succession (17‚Äì31 August 1789; 9‚Äì28 September 1789). Conflict with the Jacobins His political views earned him the animosity of radical politicians of the Palais Royal; yet in spite of threats and abuse he continued to advocate a moderate liberal policy, especially in the matter of removing restrictions for the Jews and Protestants and extending the system of trial by jury. In January 1790, he collaborated with Pierre Victor, baron Malouet in founding the Club des Impartiaux and the Journal des Impartiaux, the names of which were changed in November to the Soci√©t√© des Amis de la Constitution Monarchique and Journal de la Soci√©t√©, in order to emphasize their opposition to the Jacobin Club. Their Soci√©t√© des Amis was denounced by Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave in the Assembly (January 21, 1791), and on March 28 it was attacked by a mob, whereupon it was closed by order of the National Assembly. Stanislas's efforts to pass legislation in the Assembly ultimately failed as he would end up dead at the hands of the riots. Many of his fellow nobles such as Barnave and Brissot would ultimately meet the same fates under 40 brought upon them by the revolutionaries. Last Days Clermont-Tonnerre was arrested after the Flight to Varennes (21 June 1791). He was released on 10 August 1792, only to be murdered by the people of Paris during the Storming of the Tuileries Palace. He attempted to contact King Louis XVI through the rioting, but was apprehended by one of Robespierre's mobs while hiding in Madame de Brassac's home. Their animosity toward any sympathizer of the King led them to believe he should be executed immediately. Stanislas was then forced through a fourth- floor window and fell to his death.

He authored many Jain texts such as: Samayasara, Niyamasara, Pancastikayasara, Pravachanasara, Astapahuda and Barasanuvekkha. He occupies the highest place in the tradition of the Digambara Jain acharyas. All Digambara Jains say his name before starting to read the scripture. He spent most of his time at Ponnur Hills, Tamil Nadu and later part of life at Kundadri, Shimoga, Karnataka, Names His proper name was Padmanandin, he is popularly referred to as Kundakunda possibly because the modern village of Kondakunde in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh might represent his native home. He is also presumed to be the one being alluded to by names such as Elacarya, Vakragriva, Grdhrapiccha or Mahamati, but these names have caused confusion and are likely incorrect because they have been used for other Jain scholars such as Umaswati in texts and others in inscriptions. Biography The Digambara Shruta tradition Kundakunda belonged to the Digambara sect. Natubhai Shah places him in the second-century CE. Jayandra Soni places him in either the 2nd‚Äì or 3rd‚Äìcentury CE. Western scholars, however, place him much later primarily because of ideas he refers to and because his hagiography and quotations from his influential and important work begin to appear around 8th- century CE. For example, Paul Dundas dates him to about mid-8th-century. In the Digambara tradition, Kundakunda's texts are among the most important and treasured. The reverence for his scholarship is such that some later texts such as Pravachanasara list him third in importance, right after Mahavira and Mahavira's disciple Indrabhuti Gautama. A.N. Upadhye in his critical edition of the Pravachansara suggests Kundakunda to have lived in the middle of the 2nd century CE. Thought In texts such as PravacanasƒÅra (‚ÄòThe Essence of the Doctrine‚Äô) and SamayasƒÅra (‚ÄòThe Essence of the Soul‚Äô), Kundakunda distinguishes between two perspectives of truth: *vyavahƒÅranaya or ‚Äòmundane perspective‚Äô, also delusion (moha) *ni≈õcayanaya or ‚Äòultimate perspective‚Äô, also called ‚Äúsupreme‚Äù (paramƒÅrtha) and ‚Äúpure‚Äù (≈õuddha) For Kundakunda, the mundane realm of truth is also the relative perspective of normal folk, where the workings of karma operate and where things emerge, last for a certain duration and perish. The mundane aspect is associated with the changing qualities of the soul mainly the influx of karmic particles. The ultimate perspective meanwhile, is that of the pure soul or atman, the jiva, which is \\"blissful, energetic, perceptive, and omniscient\\". Delusion and bondage is caused by the confusion of the workings of karma with the true nature of the soul, which is always pure, in other words, it is caused by taking the view of vyavahƒÅranaya, not the higher ni≈õcayanaya which is the absolute perspective of a Jina - Kevala Jnana. His view has become the mainstream view in Digambara Jainism. Works Pancastikayasara of Kundakunda Niyamsara, another text by Kundakunda The works attributed to Kundakunda, all of them in Prakrit, can be divided in three groups. The first group comprises four original works described as \\"The Essence\\" (sara)‚Äînamely, the Niyamasara (The Essence of the Restraint, in 187 verses), the Pancastikayasara (The Essence of the Five Existents, in 153 verses), the Samayasara (The Essence of the Self, in 439 verses), and the Pravachanasara (The Essence of the Teaching, in 275 verses). The second group is a collection of ten bhaktis (devotional prayers), short compositions in praise of the acharya (Acharyabhakti), the scriptures (Srutabhakti), the mendicant conduct (Charitrabhakti), and so forth. They form the standard liturgical texts used by the Digambara in their daily rituals and bear close resemblance to similar texts employed by the ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara, suggesting the possibility of their origin in the canonical period prior to the division of the community. The last group consists of eight short texts called Prabhrta (Pkt. pahuda, i.e., a gift or a treatise), probably compilations from some older sources, on such topics as the right view (Darsanaprabhrta, in 36 verses), right conduct (Charitraprabhrta, in 44 verses), the scripture (Sutraprabhrta, in 27 verses), and so forth.

It has a land area of approximately . The east where such Art Skyes coast is relatively straight with one deep inlet, Port Pilar. The coastline is marked by a succession of reefs, small points and white, sandy beaches. The neighboring islands and islets have similar landforms. The island is within the jurisdiction of the province of Surigao del Norte and is composed of the municipalities of Burgos, Dapa, Del Carmen, General Luna, San Benito, Pilar, San Isidro, Santa Monica and Socorro. Currently, General Luna is the most popular and well visited municipality by both local and foreign tourists. It is where you will find most of the resorts, restaurants, cafes and other establishments in the island. Etymology The name originates from Visayan siargaw or saliargaw (Premna odorata), a mangrove species that grows on the islands. History The first recorded sighting by Europeans of Siargao Island was by Spanish navigator Bernardo de la Torre on board of the carrack San Juan de Letr√°n in 1543, when attempting to return from Sarangani to New Spain. It was charted as Isla de las Palmas (Palm Island in Spanish).Brand, Donald D. The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations New York: The American Geographical Society (New York, 1967) p.123,131. Geography Siargao Island contains one of the largest mangrove forest reserves in Mindanao, covering an area of 4,871 hectares in Del Carmen.http://minda.gov.ph/news/226-minda-siargao-lgu-partner- for-mangrove-conservation Long stretches of wetlands indicate a potential for commercial seaweed propagation. The extensive mangrove forests of the western coast in the Del Carmen area are home to the Indo-Pacific saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). A large specimen measuring 14 feet, 9 inches (4.5 meters) was found dead in 2016 Siargao Island is greatly influenced by the winds and currents coming uninterrupted from the Pacific Ocean, intensified by the Mindanao current running westward through the Siargao Strait. The tide of Siargao is diurnal with tidal curves typically present, especially on the east coast of the island. Offshore, a classic tropical island lies protected within its surrounding coral reef with dozens of coconut palms dressed in the center circle of the island. Off to the right, well within the massive coastal reef, lies a shining white sand bar, (Pansukian, or Naked island) some 200 meters long. The island's Pacific-facing reefs are situated on the edge of the Philippine Trench, and the extremely deep offshore waters assure the ocean swells have undiluted power when they encounter the many coral and rock reefs. Siargao has excellent surfing conditions, particularly during the southwest \\"habagat\\" monsoon from August to November, when the prevailing wind is offshore. There are small islands surrounding Siargao, namely Guyam Island, Pansukian or Naked Island, and Dako Island. These are typically included in island-hopping tours that are popular activities being offered to tourists visiting the island. In the past, the island could be reached via a direct domestic flight from Manila to Surigao City and then by a ferry to the coastal towns of Dapa or Del Carmen. Now, Cebu Pacific has flights from Cebu-Siargao, vice versa as well as a direct Manila-Siargao route (it stops briefly in Cebu and passengers then switch to a smaller aircraft). In March 2017, both Cebu Pacific and SkyJet Airlines commenced direct flights to Sayak Airport (SOS) Siargao island from Manila Airport (MNL), the first direct flights to the island from the capital. Additionally, Philippine Airlines has been offering direct flights from Clark International Airport to Sayak Airport since July 1, 2018.https://www.rappler.com/business/206165-philippine-airlines-flight-clark- siargao-july-1 There are plans to extend the runway of Sayak Airport in Siargao, to cater to the demands of growing tourists who will be visiting this island paradise. =Cloud 9= One of the well-known surfing spots in Siargao and the Philippines, with a reputation for thick, hollow tubes is \\"Cloud 9\\". This right-breaking reef wave is the site of the annual Siargao Cup, a domestic and international surfing competition sponsored by the provincial government of Surigao del Norte. The wave was discovered by travelling surfers in the late 1980s. It was named by American photographer John Seaton Callahan after a chocolate bar of the same name and was featured in the United States- based Surfer magazine in March 1993. This surf trip to Siargao Island was named by Surfer as one of the \\"Ten Best Surf Trips of All Time\\" in 1995. Cloud 9 also has a reputation for being a relatively cheap destination for surfers with many accommodations, restaurants and bars to choose from.Cloud 9 Spot Check on Surfline http://www.surfline.com/templates/article_html.cfm?n=3&id;=15607&p;=1 There are several other quality waves on Siargao and nearby islands, but Cloud 9 has received more publicity than any other surf spot in the Philippines. While it is not the only wave in the Tuason Point and General Luna areas easily accessible via the long pier from the shoreline and without the need for a boat, it is easily the most popular, leading to overcrowding and the nickname of \\"Crowd 9\\" among surfers. When you hear the word \\"tower\\" or \\"boardwalk\\", the locals are definitely referring to the famous Cloud 9. Eager foreign and locally owned accommodation and tourist facilities have profited from the magazine publicity and the influx of visitors drawn by the annual Siargao Cup competition in September and the General Luna area currently has nearly 100 accommodation options for visitors. A short motorbike ride outside of town yields even more lodgings, restaurants and bars. Siargao, particularly the municipality of General Luna and the Tuason Point area, is well known as \\"The Surfing Capital of the Philippines\\" with a reputation among surfers within the Philippines and the International scene. The island of Siargao was a hideout for convicted American drug smuggler and surfing entrepreneur Mike Boyum, who arrived on the island in late December 1988 and who died on Siargao from a 44-day \\"spiritual cleansing fast\\" in April 1989.Mike and Bill Boyum http://encyclopediaofsurfing.com/entries/boyum-mike-and-bill Eddie Florano has also written a song called \\"Surfin' in Siargao\\" from the 2006 Ukulele World: Acoustic & Power Ukulele compilation album. Red Hot Chili Peppers' frontman Anthony Kiedis was also inspired to write a song after his 2014 visit to the island. Incidents * In March 2018, journalist Karen Davila, anchor of late-night newscast Bandila, narrated in social media her family's \\"traumatic\\" experience on the island. Her son's whole chest bled from abrasions from hitting the rocks on the shallow waters while their surfing \\"trainer\\" \\"suddenly disappeared\\" after supposedly assisting the family. The journalist called out to the Siargao management, as well as the Mayor, that surfing instructors needed to be professionalized. *In July 2019, singer Yeng Constantino complained about local medical facilities in a Facebook post. She criticized a Siargao hospital for allegedly not attending to her husband properly after he sustained a head injury while cliff diving in Sugba Lagoon.

From through , he played for the Brooklyn Grooms/Superbas (1892‚Äì1901), New York Giants (1902) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1903). A four-time twenty game winner, Kennedy batted and threw right-handed. Career A native of Bellaire, Ohio, Kennedy posted a 187‚Äì159 record with 799 strikeouts and a 3.96 ERA in 3030 innings pitched over a twelve-year big-league career. Kennedy was a dominant pitcher in his first four seasons with Brooklyn, winning 25 games in 1893 and 24 in 1894. After averaging 17.5 victories over the next four seasons, he rebounded to win 22 in 1899 and 20 a year later. However, while pitching in 1901, he was bothered by arm problems and finished 3‚Äì5 in eight starts. He signed with the New York Giants at the end of the season. In 1902, Kennedy made his first start with the Giants and pitched a shutout against his former team, 6‚Äì0, on four hits, his only win in a Giants uniform. Kennedy was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates from the Giants. In 1903, Kennedy went 9‚Äì6 in 18 starts for the Pirates team that won the National League pennant. On his thirty-sixth birthday, Kennedy pitched in the first World Series. In Game Five, with Pittsburgh up three games to one, Kennedy faced Cy Young and the Boston Americans. Kennedy and Young each pitched five scoreless innings, until Honus Wagner committed two errors and Boston scored six runs. After giving up another four runs in the seventh, Kennedy was replaced; this wound up being his final career game, as he did not pitch again in the majors. Death Kennedy died from tuberculosis in his hometown of Bellaire, Ohio, at the age of 47. Nicknames Though most modern-day references and sources continue to list Kennedy under his nickname \\"Brickyard\\", during his playing career, Kennedy was actually referred to as \\"Roaring Bill\\" Kennedy far more frequently than he was called \\"Brickyard\\". He acquired the nickname \\"Roaring Bill\\" due to his loud, booming voice, as well as his tendency to become temperamental on the field.

The river's watershed drains the eastern North Cascades, with a population of about 5,000 people. The Methow's watershed is characterized by relatively pristine habitats, as much of the river basin is located in national forests and wildernesses. Many tributaries drain the large Pasayten Wilderness. An earlier economy based on agriculture is giving way to one based on recreation and tourism. History The river was named after the Methow Native Americans (today part of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation). The name \\"Methow\\" comes from the Okanagan placename /m…ôtx ∑√∫/, meaning \\"sunflower (seeds)\\". The Native American name for the river was Buttlemuleemauch, meaning \\"salmon falls river\\". In 1841 the Wilkes Expedition named the river \\"Barrier River\\". Alexander Ross said the native name was Buttle-mule-emauch. In 1811 David Thompson met the tribe living along the river and wrote their name as Smeetheowe. In 1853 George Gibbs called the river Methow or Barrier. Course The Methow River, along with its tributaries the Twisp River, Cedar Creek, and Early Winters Creek, originates in a cluster of high mountains including Golden Horn, Tower Mountain, Cutthroat Peak, Snagtooth Ridge, Kangaroo Ridge, Early Winters Spires, and Liberty Bell Mountain. Several mountain passes are associated with the Methow River and its tributaries, such as Methow Pass and Twisp Pass. State Route 20 utilizes Washington Pass and Rainy Pass, also in the general areas of headwater streams. The Pacific Crest Trail follows the uppermost reach of the Methow River, until the river turns east, flowing into the Methow Valley near Mazama. Along the way, it collects the tributary streams of Robinson Creek and Lost River. In the Methow Valley, between Mazama and Winthrop, the Methow River is joined by Early Winters Creek, Cedar Creek, Goat Creek, and Wolf Creek. The Chewuch River joins at Winthrop. One of the Methow's larger tributaries, the Chewuch River, and its many tributaries drain large parts of the Pasayten Wilderness to the north. One of its headwater streams, Cathedral Creek, reaches nearly to British Columbia, Canada. The Methow Valley continues below Winthrop to Twisp, where the Methow River is joined by another important tributary, the Twisp River. Flowing from the west, the Twisp River drains the mountains south of Washington Pass as well as the eastern slopes of Sawtooth Ridge, a major mountain range with some of Washington state's highest peaks (such as Star Peak and Mt Bigelow). Downriver from Twisp, the Methow River passes by the communities of Carlton and Methow, receiving several minor tributaries, before joining the Columbia River at Pateros. This part of the Columbia is the impoundment of Wells Dam, a lake known as Lake Pateros. Ecology and conservation In Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council (a 1989 Stevens decision) the Rehnquist Court concluded Since 2007, the Methow Beaver Project has translocated over 240 \\"problem\\" beaver (Castor canadensis) into 51 suitable sites in various headwater tributaries of the Methow watershed. The sites were selected using satellite imagery and computer modeling. Translocation success was optimized by putting pairs of beavers together in man-made lodges that tended to keep them in the desired sites so that the beaver ponds would store rainwater, trap sediment and repair channel incision/erosion, serve as nurseries for salmonids and other species, and act as firebreaks in the fire-prone eastern Cascades. One beaver that was PIT (passive integrated transponder) tagged and released in the upper part of the Methow Valley swam to the mouth of the Methow River, then up the Okanogan River almost to the Canada‚ÄìUS border, a journey of . The Methow Beaver Project is a partnership between the U.S. Forest Service, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Methow Salmon Recovery Foundation.

Although manufacturing these integrated circuits required additional processing steps, improved switching speed and the elimination of the extra power supply made this logic family the preferred choice for many microprocessors and other logic elements. Some depletion-load nMOS designs are still produced, typically in parallel with newer CMOS counterparts; one example of this is the Z84015See http://www.zilog.com/index.php?option=com_product&Itemid;=26&mode;=showProductDetails&familyId;=20&productId;=Z84015. and Z84C15.See http://www.zilog.com/index.php?option=com_product&Itemid;=26&mode;=showProductDetails&familyId;=20&productId;=Z84C15. Depletion-mode n-type MOSFETs as load transistors allow single voltage operation and achieve greater speed than possible with pure enhancement-load devices. This is partly because the depletion-mode MOSFETs can be a better current source approximation than the simpler enhancement-mode transistor can, especially when no extra voltage is available (one of the reasons early pMOS and nMOS chips demanded several voltages). The inclusion of depletion-mode n-MOS transistors in the manufacturing process demanded additional manufacturing steps compared to the simpler enhancement-load circuits; this is because depletion-load devices are formed by increasing the amount of dopant in the load transistors channel region, in order to adjust their threshold voltage. This is normally performed using ion implantation. History and background Following the invention of the MOSFET by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, they demonstrated MOSFET technology in 1960. They fabricated both pMOS and nMOS devices with a 20¬µm process. However, the nMOS devices were impractical, and only the pMOS type were practical working devices. In 1965, Chih-Tang Sah, Otto Leistiko and A.S. Grove at Fairchild Semiconductor fabricated several NMOS devices with channel lengths between 8¬µm and 65¬µm. Dale L. Critchlow and Robert H. Dennard at IBM also fabricated NMOS devices in the 1960s. The first IBM NMOS product was a memory chip with 1kb data and 50100 ns access time, which entered large-scale manufacturing in the early 1970s. This led to MOS semiconductor memory replacing earlier bipolar and ferrite-core memory technologies in the 1970s. =Silicon gate= In the late 1960s, bipolar junction transistors were faster than (p-channel) MOS transistors then used and were more reliable, but they also consumed much more power, required more area, and demanded a more complicated manufacturing process. MOS ICs were considered interesting but inadequate for supplanting the fast bipolar circuits in anything but niche markets, such as low power applications. One of the reasons for the low speed was that MOS transistors had gates made of aluminum which led to considerable parasitic capacitances using the manufacturing processes of the time. The introduction of transistors with gates of polycrystalline silicon (that became the de facto standard from the mid-1970s to early 2000s) was an important first step in order to reduce this handicap. This new self-aligned silicon-gate transistor was introduced by Federico Faggin at Fairchild Semiconductor in early 1968; it was a refinement (and the first working implementation) of ideas and work by John C. Sarace, Tom Klein and Robert W. Bower (around 1966‚Äì67) for a transistor with lower parasitic capacitances that could be manufactured as part of an IC (and not only as a discrete component). This new type of pMOS transistor was 3‚Äì5 times as fast (per watt) as the aluminum-gate pMOS transistor, and it needed less area, had much lower leakage and higher reliability. The same year, Faggin also built the first IC using the new transistor type, the Fairchild 3708 (8-bit analog multiplexer with decoder), which demonstrated a substantially improved performance over its metal-gate counterpart. In less than 10 years, the silicon gate MOS transistor replaced bipolar circuits as the main vehicle for complex digital ICs. =nMOS and back-gate bias= There are a couple of drawbacks associated with pMOS: The electron holes that are the charge (current) carriers in pMOS transistors have lower mobility than the electrons that are the charge carriers in nMOS transistors (a ratio of approximately 2.5), furthermore pMOS circuits do not interface easily with low voltage positive logic such as DTL-logic and TTL-logic (the 7400-series). However, pMOS transistors are relatively easy to make and were therefore developed first ‚Äî ionic contamination of the gate oxide from etching chemicals and other sources can very easily prevent (the electron based) nMOS transistors from switching off, while the effect in (the electron-hole based) pMOS transistors is much less severe. Fabrication of nMOS transistors therefore has to be many times cleaner than bipolar processing in order to produce working devices. Early work on nMOS integrated circuit (IC) technology was presented in a brief IBM paper at ISSCC in 1969. Hewlett-Packard then started to develop nMOS IC technology to get the promising speed and easy interfacing for its calculator business.These calculators (like the Datapoint 2200 and others) were in many ways small desktop computers, but preceded the Apple II and the IBM PC by many years. Tom Haswell at HP eventually solved many problems by using purer raw materials (especially aluminum for interconnects) and by adding a bias voltage to make the gate threshold large enough; this back-gate bias remained a de facto standard solution to (mainly) sodium contaminants in the gates until the development of ion implantation (see below). Already by 1970, HP was making good enough nMOS ICs and had characterized it enough so that Dave Maitland was able to write an article about nMOS in the December, 1970 issue of Electronics magazine. However, nMOS remained uncommon in the rest of the semiconductor industry until 1973.Shown by its mere mention in a large roundup article written by GE engineer Herman Schmid that appeared in the December, 1972 issue of IEEE Transactions on Manufacturing Technology. Although it cites Maitland‚Äôs 1970 article in Electronics, Schmid‚Äôs article does not discuss nMOS fabrication in detail but it does cover pMOS and even CMOS fabrication extensively. The production-ready nMOS process enabled HP to develop the industry‚Äôs first 4-kbit IC ROM. Motorola eventually served as a second source for these products and so became one of the first commercial semiconductor vendors to master the nMOS process, thanks to Hewlett-Packard. A while later, the startup company Intel announced a 1-kbit pMOS DRAM, called 1102, developed as a custom product for Honeywell (an attempt to replace magnetic core memory in their mainframe computers). HP‚Äôs calculator engineers, who wanted a similar but more robust product for the 9800 series calculators, contributed IC fabrication experience from their 4-kbit ROM project to help improve Intel DRAM‚Äôs reliability, operating-voltage, and temperature range. These efforts contributed to the heavily enhanced Intel 1103 1-kbit pMOS DRAM, which was the world‚Äôs first commercially available DRAM IC. It was formally introduced in October 1970, and became Intel‚Äôs first really successful product.http://See www.hp9825.com/html/prologues.html =Depletion-mode transistors= Characteristics of depletion-mode MOSFET Early MOS logic had one transistor type, which is enhancement mode so that it can act as a logic switch. Since suitable resistors were hard to make, the logic gates used saturated loads; that is, to make the one type of transistor act as a load resistor, the transistor had to be turned always on by tying its gate to the power supply (the more negative rail for PMOS logic, or the more positive rail for NMOS logic). Since the current in a device connected that way goes as the square of the voltage across the load, it provides poor pullup speed relative to its power consumption when pulled down. A resistor (with the current simply proportional to the voltage) would be better, and a current source (with the current fixed, independent of voltage) better yet. A depletion-mode device with gate tied to the opposite supply rail is a much better load than an enhancement-mode device, acting somewhere between a resistor and a current source. The first depletion-load nMOS circuits were pioneered and made by the DRAM manufacturer Mostek, which made depletion-mode transistors available for the design of the original Zilog Z80 in 1975‚Äì76.Zilog relied on Mostek and Synertek to produce the Z80 and other chips before their own production facilities were ready. Mostek had the ion implantation equipment needed to create a doping profile more precise than possible with diffusion methods, so that the threshold voltage of the load transistors could be adjusted reliably. At Intel, depletion load was introduced in 1974 by Federico Faggin, an ex- Fairchild engineer and later the founder of Zilog. Depletion-load was first employed for a redesign of one of Intel's most important products at the time, a +5V-only 1Kbit nMOS SRAM called the 2102 (using more than 6000 transistorsEach bit demands six transistors in a typical static RAM.). The result of this redesign was the significantly faster 2102A, where the highest performing versions of the chip had access times of less than 100ns, taking MOS memories close to the speed of bipolar RAMs for the first time.See for instance: http://www.intel4004.com/sgate.htm or http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Faggin_Federico/Faggin_Federico_1_2_3.oral_history.2004.102658025.pdf Depletion-load nMOS processes were also used by several other manufacturers to produce many incarnations of popular 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit CPUs. Similarly to early pMOS and nMOS CPU designs using enhancement mode MOSFETs as loads, depletion-load nMOS designs typically employed various types of dynamic logic (rather than just static gates) or pass transistors used as dynamic clocked latches. These techniques can enhance the area-economy considerably although the effect on the speed is complex. Processors built with depletion-load nMOS circuitry include the 6800 (in later versions \\"Motorola is redesigning the M6800 microprocessor family by adding depletion loads to increase speed and reduce the 6800 CPU size to 160 mils.\\"), the 6502, Signetics 2650, 8085, 6809, 8086, Z8000, NS32016, and many others (whether or not the HMOS processors below are included, as special cases). A large number of support and peripheral ICs were also implemented using (often static) depletion-load based circuitry. However, there were never any standardized logic families in nMOS, such as the bipolar 7400 series and the CMOS 4000 series, although designs with several second source manufacturers often achieved something of a de facto standard component status. One example of this is the nMOS 8255 PIO design, originally intended as an 8085 peripheral chip, that has been used in Z80 and x86 embedded systems and many other contexts for several decades. Modern low power versions are available as CMOS or BiCMOS implementations, similar to the 7400-series. =Intel HMOS= Intel's own depletion-load NMOS process was known as HMOS, for High density, short channel MOS. The first version was introduced in late 1976 and first used for their static RAM products,See http://lark.tu-sofia.bg/ntt/eusku/readings/art_1.pdf it was soon being used for faster and/or less power hungry versions of the 8085, 8086, and other chips. HMOS continued to be improved and went through four distinct generations. According to Intel, HMOS II (1979) provided twice the density and four times the speed/power product over other typical contemporary depletion- load nMOS processes.See for instance: Leo J.Scanlon The 68000 Principles and programming. This version was widely licensed by 3rd parties, including (among others) Motorola who used it for their Motorola 68000, and Commodore Semiconductor Group, who used it for their MOS Technology 8502 die-shrunk MOS 6502. The original HMOS process, later referred to as HMOS I, had a channel length of 3 microns, which was reduced to 2 for the HMOS II, and 1.5 for HMOS III. By the time HMOS III was introduced in 1982, Intel had begun a switch to their CHMOS process, a CMOS process using design elements of the HMOS lines. One final version of the system was released, HMOS-IV. A significant advantage to the HMOS line was that each generation was deliberately designed to allow existing layouts to die-shrink with no major changes. Various techniques were introduced to ensure the systems worked as the layout changed. HMOS, HMOS II, HMOS III, and HMOS IV were together used for many different kinds of processors; the 8085, 8048, 8051, 8086, 80186, 80286, and many others, but also for several generations of the same basic design, see datasheets. =Further development= In the mid-1980s, faster CMOS variants, using similar HMOS process technology, such as Intel's CHMOS I, II, III, IV, etc. started to supplant n-channel HMOS for applications such as the Intel 80386 and certain microcontrollers. A few years later, in the late 1980s, BiCMOS was introduced for high-performance microprocessors as well as for high speed analog circuits. Today, most digital circuits, including the ubiquitous 7400 series, are manufactured using various CMOS processes with a range of different topologies employed. This means that, in order to enhance speed and save die area (transistors and wiring), high speed CMOS designs often employ other elements than just the complementary static gates and the transmission gates of typical slow low-power CMOS circuits (the only CMOS type during the 1960s and 1970s). These methods use significant amounts of dynamic circuitry in order to construct the larger building blocks on the chip, such as latches, decoders, multiplexers, and so on, and evolved from the various dynamic methodologies developed for pMOS and nMOS circuits during the 1970s. Compared to CMOS Compared to static CMOS, all variants of nMOS (and pMOS) are relatively power hungry in steady state. This is because they rely on load-transistors working as resistors, where the quiescent current determines the maximum possible load at the output as well as the speed of the gate (i.e. with other factors constant). This contrasts to the power consumption characteristics of static CMOS circuits, which is due only to the transient power draw when the output state is changed and the p- and n-transistors thereby briefly conduct at the same time. However, this is a simplified view, and a more complete picture has to also include the fact that even purely static CMOS circuits have significant leakage in modern tiny geometries, as well as the fact that modern CMOS chips often contain dynamic and/or domino logic with a certain amount of pseudo nMOS circuitry.Pseudo nMOS means that an enhancement-mode p-channel transistor with grounded gate is used in place of the depletion-mode n-channel transistor. See http://eia.udg.es/~forest/VLSI/lect.10.pdf  Evolution from preceding NMOS types  Depletion-load processes differ from their predecessors in the way the Vdd voltage source, representing 1, connects to each gate. In both technologies, each gate contains one NMOS transistor which is permanently turned on and connected to Vdd. When the transistors connecting to 0 turn off, this pull-up transistor determines the output to be 1 by default. In standard NMOS, the pull-up is the same kind of transistor as is used for logic switches. As the output voltage approaches a value less than Vdd, it gradually switches itself off. This slows the 0 to 1 transition, resulting in a slower circuit. Depletion-load processes replace this transistor with a depletion- mode NMOS at a constant gate bias, with the gate tied directly to the source. This alternative type of transistor acts as a current source until the output approaches 1, then acts as a resistor. The result is a faster 0 to 1 transition.  Static power consumption  An nMOS NAND gate with saturated enhancement-mode load device. The enhancement device can also be used with a more positive gate bias in a non-saturated configuration, which is more power efficient but requires a high gate voltage and a longer transistor. Neither is as power efficient or compact as a depletion load. Depletion-load circuits consume less power than enhancement-load circuits at the same speed. In both cases the connection to 1 is always active, even when the connection to 0 is also active. This results in high static power consumption. The amount of waste depends on the strength, or physical size, of the pull-up. Both (enhancement-mode) saturated-load and depletion-mode pull-up transistors use greatest power when the output is stable at 0, so this loss is considerable. Because the strength of a depletion-mode transistor falls off less on the approach to 1, they may reach 1 faster despite starting slower, i.e. conducting less current at the beginning of the transition and at steady state.

Frederick Smyth (March 9, 1819 ‚Äì April 22, 1899) was an American banker, railroad executive, and politician from Manchester, New Hampshire. Born in 1819 in Candia, New Hampshire, he became City Clerk of Manchester at the age of 30. A Republican, he served four terms as mayor of Manchester from 1852 to 1854 and again in 1864, and was twice elected Governor of New Hampshire. Early life Smyth was the third of five children. Around 1838, he and Thomas Wheat began running a country store in Candia under the name of Wheat and Smyth. The store was owned by Wheat's father. They soon left to attend Phillips Andover Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. Financial difficulties forced them to leave Phillips Academy after one term. Smyth moved to Manchester, New Hampshire, where he found a job working for George Porter in Porter's general store and mercantile business. After three years, Smyth was made a partner in the business. On December 11, 1844, Smyth married Emily Lane of Candia, daughter of John Lane and Nabby Emerson. Emily Lane Smyth died on January 14, 1885. Smyth's second wife was Marion Hamilton Cossar of Manchester, daughter of James Cossar and Jessie Finlay. They were married on February 22, 1886 at Carmichael, Lanarkshire, Scotland. He continued to be a merchant until 1849, when he sold his share of the business following his election to the post of Manchester city clerk, at the age of 30. He was reelected to that post in 1850 and 1851. In 1852, he was elected to his first term as mayor of Manchester. He was reelected in 1853 and 1854. Many of the decisions he made as mayor remain today, including many \\"firsts\\", such as overseeing the construction of the city's first highways, the first water and sewer systems, the first sidewalks, and streetlights. He is credited with the idea to plant trees along city streets to provide shade and maintain the natural beauty of the city. In 1857 and 1858, he was a member of the New Hampshire General Court, representing Manchester's Ward 3. He was active in the New Hampshire Agriculture Society, serving as treasurer for 10 years. He was a director in the American Agriculture Society and a vice-president of the American Pomological Society. He served as one of the commissioners on the part of the General Government of New Hampshire at the International Exhibition of 1862, in London. When Abraham Lincoln visited the state in 1860, Smyth introduced him to a crowd as the \\"next president of the United States\\". As governor He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of New Hampshire in 1860, but was elected in 1865, and again in 1866. Smyth's terms as governor were consumed by efforts to straighten out the state's wartime finances, which were in substantial disarray because of Civil War expenditures. He borrowed $1.2 million to fund the state's war debt, and settled all state claims against the federal government on terms favorable to the state. He is credited with putting New Hampshire's credit on a sound financial footing, and \\"mustered out\\" soldiers remaining in wartime military units. He oversaw a revision of state statutes, and was a strong supporter of passage of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (passed 1868), which guarantees due process and equal protection to all United States citizens. He also undertook to restore fish to certain state rivers, and he began publication of state papers. Founding of the University of New Hampshire On July 7, 1866, during his second term as governor, Smyth signed a bill providing for the incorporation of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts. Smyth had advocated legislation to create the school in his inaugural address. The bill provided that the college be established as part of Dartmouth College and that it should be governed by a nine-member board of trustees. The agricultural college was originally located in Hanover, New Hampshire. In 1893, it moved to Durham and became the University of New Hampshire in 1923. On July 19, 1866 the trustees appointed Smyth a trustee of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts. He continued to serve as a trustee until October 7, 1897. At the first meeting of the board, on September 28, 1866, he was elected treasurer. He held the post until August 20, 1895 when he relinquished the post due to ill health. On April 10, 1895, Smyth was elected president of the board. However, business commitments and declining health prevented him from ever presiding as president, even though he held the post until his term as a trustee expired in 1897. =The Smyth Prize= In addition to his service as a trustee, Smyth established and provided funds for the Smyth Prize for Writing, Reading and Elocution for students of the agricultural college. The Smyth Prizes were awarded from 1881 until 1904. After Smyth's death in 1899, the prize money came from provisions in his will and then was funded by his wife, Marion C. Smyth. Prizes ranged from $25 to $10. The essay and elocution competitions were open to the senior and middle class while the reading competition was only open to first-year students. Civic involvement Smyth served as one of the board of managers of the National Homes for Disabled Soldiers. He was a delegate-at-large to the 1872 Republican national convention, and President Hayes appointed him honorary commissioner to the 1878 International Exposition at Paris. Smyth was a principal stockholder and president of the Concord and Montreal Railroad. He was a trustee of the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, and served as president of the New Hampshire Orphans' Home at Franklin. He died in Manchester on April 22, 1899, at the age of 80. He is buried there at Valley Cemetery, where his family has one of the cemetery's 13 mausoleums. Some sources say he died at his winter home in Hamilton, Bermuda. Smyth's name was honored when, in 1949, Smyth's wife Marion C. Smyth founded the Smyth Trust. The trust provides scholarships to music students in the greater Manchester area.

This practice is condemned by a variety of animal-welfare groups as a form of animal cruelty.  The training crush  As reported in the UN Report Gone Astray, in Myanmar and Thailand the \\"training crush\\" method involves placing an elephant in a strong, large stall or cage, tied with ropes to keep the elephant from moving, including being unable to kick, raise or swing its head. This method is supposed to crush the elephant's spirit. Proponents argue that this allows the elephant to properly and safely learn the basic command \\"Still!\\" or \\"Quiet!\\", and enable it to adapt to its new environment. National Geographic reports on the use of nails and sticks stabbed into the ears and feet of an elephant, the subject of a crush, in Thailand. Other reports cite the use of beatings with sticks, chains or bullhooks, sleep-deprivation, hunger, and thirst to \\"break\\" the elephant and make them submissive to their owners. It is not clear whether all training crushes involve the use of corporal punishment. As quoted in Gone Astray, a 1967 report on a training crush, \\"An elephant born in captivity is brought up amongst human beings and its training is humane from the day it begins; but a wild beast parted from the herd and its mother must suffer agonies before its will is broken.\\" As it is illegal to take elephants from the wild and the elephant identification system has now made it very difficult to bring in elephants illegally. = Thailand = Elephants working in the tourist trade, Chiang Rai, Thailand. Working and performing elephants in Thailand are often poached from Myanmar and trafficked into Thailand. There are around 6,500 elephants currently living in Thailand, with around 2,500 of them being caught from the wild. Trafficked animals can be passed off as being locally reared, with birth and ownership documentation falsified. Animal welfare advocates have called for better legislation and systems to document the origin of elephants in tourist camps and other locations across Thailand. Undercover video footage taken in 2019 shows that elephant crushing is still commonly used in Thailand. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/25/baby- elephant-abuse-raises-concerns-thailands-tourism-practice/  Alternatives  Zoos, including those in countries such as the USA, used corporal punishment and negative reinforcement to train elephants until the mid-1970s. A new technique, called protected contact or non-dominance is used in modern zoos. The new training uses rewards, not punishment to encourage the behavior of the animal toward the target behavior. Another alternative is to use trained elephants (called Kumkis in India) to tame, train or chase wild elephants. This practice is widely used in countries such as India.

It is the main river flowing into Lake Chelan. Miners arrived in Stehekin River Valley in the late 19th century. They were followed by homesteaders in the early 20th century. Today, the Stehekin River Valley is still a remote area that can only be reached by way of a 55-mile boat ride up Lake Chelan. The river's name comes from the Columbia-Moses word stxw√≠kn', which means \\"the way through.\\" Course The Stehekin River originates in the North Cascades near Cascade Pass in North Cascades National Park. It collects the waters of numerous headwater tributaries such as Pelton Creek, Doubtful Creek, and Basin Creek. Major peaks near the source of the Stehekin River include Boston Peak, Buckner Mountain, Booker Mountain, Sahale Mountain, Magic Mountain, Mix-up Peak, and Hurry-up Peak. The Stehekin River flows generally west and southwest from these mountains, south of Park Creek Ridge to its confluence with Park Creek. Shortly below Park Creek the river receives Bridge Creek, one of its main tributaries. Bridge Creek joins from the north and drains northernmost Chelan County in North Cascades National Park. Bridge Creek and its tributaries drain a number of significant peaks including Goode Mountain, Storm King, Mount Logan, Black Peak, and others. Bridge Creek's source is located near Rainy Pass and Washington Pass along Washington State Route 20. The Stehekin River continues generally southeast below McGregor Mountain to the northwest end of Lake Chelan. Shortly above the lake it receives Agnes Creek, another significant tributary, from the west. Agnes Creek drains the northernmost part of Wenatchee National Forest. Its final mile marks the boundary between North Cascades National Park and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. At the Agnes Creek confluence the Stehekin River exits the national park and enters the national recreation area. The Stehekin River enters Lake Chelan near Stehekin, a small community accessible only by boat. Roads from Stehekin follow the river up much of its valley. There are numerous campgrounds. The Pacific Crest Trail enters the Stehekin River basin from the south via Suiattle Pass, down South Fork Agnes Creek and Agnes Creek to the Stehekin River, then up the Stehekin to Bridge Creek and up Bridge Creek to Rainy Pass.Course info mainly from USGS topographic maps and  Settlement  Because the region is so remote, the Stehekin River valley remained unsettled until the 1880s, when miners began infiltrating the region in search of mineral wealth. Between the years 1887‚Äì1910, a significant number of miners arrived looking for mineral deposits in the North Cascades. By 1890, there was a relatively large hotel Stehekin on Lake Chelan at the mouth of the Stehekin River. The hotel served tourists and fishermen as well as miners.Luxenberg, Gretchen A., \\"Corridors of Settlement: Stehekin Valley\\", Historic Resource Study, North Cascades National Park Service Complex, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Seattle, Washington, 1986. Over the centuries, the changing course of the Stehekin River deposited rich, alluvial sediments along the valley floor; however, it also left behind large boulders that made farming difficult. Nevertheless, early homesteaders began farming in the valley around 1910. The most desirable homesteads were located along the Stehekin River and its tributaries since these sites provided a reliable water supply for farming and natural transportation routes leading to Lake Chelan. The Buckner Homestead was one of the earliest farms along the Stehekin River. It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Luxenberg, Gretchen A., \\"Buckner\\", Historic Resource Study, North Cascades National Park Service Complex, National Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Seattle, Washington, 1986. Because of the harsh winters, few early settlers remained in the valley year around. In the fall most homesteaders would leave the area, choosing to spend the winter in less isolated communities like Chelan. In the spring, families would return the Stehekin Valley to work their farms. Many of the early homesteaders supplemented their incomes by guiding miners into the backcountry and packing goods to remote mining claims. In 1902, the valley's first school was opened in a cabin located at the head of the Lake Chelan. It was later replaced by structure known as the Kronk cabin. Today, the cabin is the oldest school building in the Stehekin Valley. As new families arrived, the need for a real schoolhouse became clear. In 1921, valley residents select a site for a new school. The school was a log structure, built by local volunteers. The Stehekin School still exists, and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. As mining declined, subsistence farming, logging, and tourism sustained the residents of the Stehekin Valley. Apples were an important crop in the first half of the 20th century. In the winter, hunting and trapping a part of life for year around residents. Perhaps most important to the valley's economy was the arrival of the United States Forest Service. With the establishment of the Stehekin Ranger District in 1905, reliable seasonal work became available to valley residents. Today, the Stehekin Valley is still quite isolated. There are fewer than one hundred year-around residents, most employed by the National Park Service. The only way into the valley is a 55-mile boat ride from Chelan. Two boats provided daily service between Chelan and Stehekin during the summer. In the winter, boat service is limited to two trips a week.  Recreation  During the summer tourism is important since the area in now part of the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. The Stehekin River is scenic and remote, offering whitewater rafting and kayaking opportunities. There are many camp sites available along the river. The Stehekin River is known as for its excellent fly-fishing. Rainbow and cutthroat trout fishing is best in the spring, and fishermen come for sockeye salmon in the fall.\\"Stehekin River\\", Washington State Tourism Office, experiencewa.com, Bellingham, Washington, 18 June 2009.

Violent dispersals of various FQS protests were among the first watershed events in which large numbers of Filipino students of the 1970s were radicalized against the Marcos administration. Due to these dispersals, many students who had previously held ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù positions (i.e., calling for legislative reforms) became convinced that they had no choice but to call for more radical social change. Similar watershed events would later include the February 1971 Diliman Commune; the August 1971 suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in the wake of the Plaza Miranda bombing; the September 1972 declaration of Martial Law; the 1980 murder of Macli-ing Dulag; the August 1983 assassination of Ninoy Aquino; and eventually, allegations of cheating during the 1986 Snap Elections which led to the non-violent 1986 EDSA Revolution. Sociopolitical Context Presidential elections had been held on November 11, 1969 and Ferdinand Marcos had been reelected for a second term. This made him the first and last Filipino president to win a second full term. = Inflation and social unrest = Marcos won the November 1969 election by a landslide, and was inaugurated on December 30 of that year. But Marcos's massive spending during the 1969 presidential campaign had taken its toll and triggered growing public unrest. During the campaign, Marcos spent $50 million worth in debt-funded infrastructure, triggering a Balance of Payments crisis. The Marcos administration ran to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help, and the IMF offered a debt restructuring deal. New policies, including a greater emphasis on exports and the relaxation of controls of the peso, were put in place. The Peso was allowed to float to a lower market value, resulting in drastic inflation, and social unrest. Marcos's spending during the campaign led to opposition figures such as Senator Lorenzo Ta√±ada, Senator Jovito Salonga, and Senator Jose Diokno to accuse Marcos of wanting to stay in power even beyond the two term maximum set for the presidency by the 1935 constitution. The nation was experiencing a crisis as the government was falling into debt, inflation was uncontrolled and the value of the peso continued to drop. The slight increase of the minimum wage was countered by continuous price increases and unemployment. Benigno \\"Ninoy\\" Aquino Jr. remarked that the nation was turning into a 'garrison state' and President Marcos himself described the country as a 'social volcano.' = Constitutional Convention = Various parties had begun campaigning to initiate a constitutional convention which would revise change the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines in 1967, citing rising discontent over wide inequalities in society. On March 16 of that year, the Philippine Congress constituted itself into a Constituent Assembly and passed Resolution No. 2, which called for a Constitutional Convention to change the 1935 Constitution. Marcos would eventually surprised his critics by endorsing the move, but later historians would note that the resulting Constitutional Convention laid the foundation for the legal justifications Marcos used to extend his term past the two four- year terms allowable under the 1935 Constitution. = \\"Moderate\\" and \\"radical\\" opposition = The media reports of the time classified the various civil society groups opposing Marcos into two categories.Talitha Espiritu Passionate Revolutions: The Media and the Rise and Fall of the Marcos Regime Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, 2017. The \\"Moderates\\", which included church groups, civil libertarians, and nationalist politicians, were those who wanted to create change through political reforms. The \\"radicals\\", including a number of labor and student groups associated with the National Democracy movement, wanted broader, more systemic political reforms.  The \\"moderate\\" opposition  With the Constitutional Convention occupying their attention from 1971 to 1973, statesmen and politicians opposed to the increasingly more- authoritarian administration of Ferdinand Marcos mostly focused their efforts on political efforts from within the halls of power. Student demonstrators, for example, made a manifesto for the constitutional convention, containing the following provisions: * the non-partisan election of delegates to the national convention * the non-partisan composition of poll inspectors and provincial board of canvassers * public officials who will run as candidates should be made to resign or forfeit their seats upon filing of candidacy * the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) must regulate the election propaganda and expense of the candidates * the delegates to the convention must be made ineligible to run for any public office in the elections immediately after the convention * the age requirement of delegates should be lowered from 25 to 21 years old. Student groups considered \\"moderate\\" at the time included: * the National Union of Students in the Philippines (NUSP), * the National Students League (NSL), and * the Young Christian Socialists Movement (CSM), communitarian-socialist organization. A few days before the rally on January 26, Manuel F. Martinez, former Dawn (the weekly student newspaper of the University of the East) editor commented: > Now is the time for all trouble makers to come to the aid of the country. > For the only chance for exploiters to triumph is for revolutionaries to do > nothing [...] We must make trouble in the constitutional convention, trouble > for vested interest, trouble for the profligate rich, trouble for the > denizens of this detestable establishment and abominable status quo [...] > The convention must be scuttled or wrecked if it is dominated by the very > same interests against which stands the very spirit of change inherent in > convening a constitutional convention. For conceived in greed, born in > mischief and nurtured in iniquity, the spirit of wanton capitalism has never > failed to bend human institutions to the service of injustice and sin. To clarify, he explained that the word 'trouble' was used not in its literal sense, but rather that the youth should get involved in the coming convention, which they have been striving to do. Later \\"moderate\\" groups would include the Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties or MCCCL, led by Senator Jose W. Diokno. The MCCCL's rallies are particularly remembered for their diversity, attracting participants from both the moderate and radical camps; and for their scale, with the biggest one attended by as many as 50,000 people.  The \\"radical\\" opposition  The other broad category of student groups who participated in the first quarter storm were those who wanted broader, more systemic political reforms, usually as part of the National Democracy movement. These groups were branded \\"radicals\\" by the media, although the Marcos administration extended that term to \\"moderate\\" protest groups as well. Groups considered \\"radical\\" at the time included: * the Kabataang Makabayan (KM), * the Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan (SDK), * the Student Cultural Association of the University of the Philippines (SCAUP), * the Movement for Democratic Philippines (MDP), * the Student Power Assembly of the Philippines (SPAP), and * the Malayang Pagkakaisa ng Kabataang Pilipino (MPKP). = Kabataang Makabayan = Kabataang Makabayan (KM) is a political organization founded by Jose Maria Sison on November 30, 1964, intended to be a nationwide \\"extension\\" of the Student Cultural Association of the University of the Philippines (SCAUP), which is also an organization of student activists founded by Sison in 1959 that moved towards \\"academic freedom in the University against the combined machinations of the state and the church.\\" The KM advocated for unity against and liberation from American imperialism, which \\"made the suffering of [the] people more complex and more severe.\\" Their first demonstration, which took place at the U.S. Embassy on January 25, 1965, was held to this effect. The KM had since been active in various rallies and demonstrations such as those condemning the Laurel-Langley agreement, Parity Amendments, Mutual Defense treaty, the state visit of South Vietnam Premier Cao Ky in 1966, the state visit of President Marcos to the U.S., the Oct. 24, 1966 Manila Summit conference, the killings of Filipinos in American bases, and the visit of President Nixon‚Äîevents which they believe contribute to the feudalistic nature of the country. The rally held against the Manila Summit Conference on October 24 to 25, 1966 was among those that ended in violence. The media and government officials reminded the public to be polite to the country's visitors and display 'traditional Filipino hospitality,' expecting the KM to stage a demonstration. Furthermore, the Manila mayor's office announced that permits to demonstrate against the Manila Summit will not be issued. On the day before the beginning of the summit, as summiteers began to arrive, a group of students waved around name-calling placards, defending that they were not demonstrating, just picketing. They were taken by police and informed that they would be charged with demonstrating without a permit. On October 24, KM held a demonstration in front of Manila Hotel to protest against American involvement in Vietnam which resulted in a violent dispersal. One student had died, several were injured, and seven were arrested, charged with breach of the peace. December of the same year, Sison was in Ateneo de Manila University to talk about the events of the October 24 movement. Sison highlighted the parallels between the state at current time and the state during the 1896 Philippine Revolution against Spain: > If the brilliant students - Dr. Jose Rizal, Emilio Jacinto and Gregorio del > Pilar - had merely concentrated on stale academic studies, and pursued > successful professional careers and married well - in the accomplished style > of Se√±or Pasta in El Filibusterismo - they would be worthless now to this > nation, as worthless [...]. Our elders who take pride on their sheer age and > their sense of caution should learn from the [...] revolutionary and > nationalist youth movement of 1896 and of today. The elders [...] should not > now assume the function of censors and the black judges who condemned [...] > patriots of the old democratic revolution as subversive heretics. In general, during 1968, there have been many local student riots and demonstrations trying to address internal issues, \\"ranging from stinking toilets to increased tuition fees.\\" \\"At the Araneta University, for example, according to Cesar Bercades, president of its student council, the demonstrations there resulted in the damage of school property amounting to P56,920.34 and the dismissal of eight students from the university and all schools.\\"  Major Demonstrations of the First Quarter Storm  While the period from January to March 1970 was one of significant social unrest in the Philippines and there is no definitive record of all protests or demonstrations in the country, seven protests in the area of Metropolitan Manila have come to be considered the historically notable demonstrations of the time, even being branded the \\"7 deadly protests of the First Quarter Storm\\" in some media accounts. = January 26: 1970 State of the Nation Address protest = Jan. 26, 1970 - Rioters crowd Marcos and company as they enter his limousine. From Manila Bulletin. The beginning of what is now known as the \\"First Quarter Storm\\" was marked by a demonstration in January 26, 1970, at the opening of the Seventh Congress, during which President Ferdinand Marcos gave his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA).Lacaba, Jose F. (February 7, 1970) The January 26 Confrontation: A Highly Personal Account. The Philippines Free Press. The protest was primarily organized by the National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP), and was meant to coincide with the first State of the Nation Address of Marcos' second term. It included \\"moderate\\" groups such as the NUSP, who wanted Marcos to promise he would not seek power beyond the two terms allowed him by the 1935 Philippine Constitution; and more \\"radical\\" groups such as the Kabataang Makabayan, who wanted greater systemic political reforms. The protest was largely peaceful until the end of the planned program, when a disagreement broke out between the moderate and the radical groups for control over the protest stage. This disagreement was ongoing when Marcos, having finished his speech, walked out of the legislative building. He and the First Lady Imelda Marcos were greeted by an agitated crowd that jeered and hurled at them with pebbles, paper balls, and effigies, one resembling a crocodile (a representation of greed) and another a coffin (symbolizing the death of democracy). The two escaped to the presidential limousine, leaving the police - consisting of the Manila Police District (MPD) and elements of the Philippine Constabulary Metropolitan Command (METROCOM) - to disperse the crowd. This led to hours of bloody confrontation between the protesters and the police, ending with at least two students confirmed dead and several more injured. = January 30: Battle of Mendiola = Four days after the SONA, to condemn \\"state fascism\\" and police brutality, protesters, mostly students, marched back to the Congress. The rally lasted until 5pm. As one of the leaders was saying the closing remarks with a microphone, shouts of \\"Malaca√±ang! Malaca√±ang!\\" were heard mainly from the side of the students from Philippine College of Commerce and University of the Philippines. This led to many people getting pushed by a wave of protesters as they sang protest songs and chanted \\"Makibaka, huwag matakot!\\" They began to move towards Ayala Bridge, with the Philippine flag raised, and decided to march directly to Malaca√±ang and protest in front of Marcos' doorsteps, hearing gunfire as they slowly closed by the Palace. Some of the more militant rallyists were charging the metal fence that separates them from the Palace. While this was happening, different student leaders were already in Malaca√±ang having a meeting with Ferdinand Marcos to make the following demands: \\"the holding of a nonpartisan constitutional convention; the commitment that Marcos, a two-term president, would not suddenly change the rules forbidding a president from seeking a third term; the resignation of the Manila Police District top brass; and the disbandment of paramilitary units in Central Luzon.\\" Since half past three in the afternoon, Portia Ilagan of Philippine Normal College, Edgar Jopson, other student leaders, and other members of the NUSP were allowed to be present in an audience with Marcos to urge the president to have a nonpartisan constitutional convention and to avoid running for the presidency for the third time. Marcos said that he was not interested in a third term and Jopson demanded that he put that down in writing, which led to Marcos lash out at him by calling him as merely the son of a grocer. The President did not agree to their terms and their meeting ended at around 6pm. As they headed to the front door of Malaca√±ang Palace, they heard the sounds of glass breaking and pillboxes exploding. As the students' dialogue with the president was happening inside the Palace, the students outside the Palace were confronted with their own difficulties. Due to a loud call from someone outside the Palace to turn the lights on, the Palace did just that to accommodate the request, which led to a rock crashing to one of the lamps. Thinking that this was a rock thrown from inside the Palace and aimed at the students outside, the students threw rocks at the Palace in return. Protesters claimed that Malaca√±ang guards started the violence by throwing pellets at them from inside, which led them to take over a fire truck and smashed it into Malaca√±ang's Gate 4. Once the gate broke and gave way, bold protestors charged into the Palace grounds tossing rocks, pillboxes, Molotov cocktails. The Presidential Guard Battalion then came out in full force with their guns. The protestors drew back but not before inflaming the fire truck and a government car. left Protesters ran towards Arguelles Street to evade the explosions in front of the Palace. Student protesters were steadily driven out of J.P. Laurel and farther down Mendiola, where they built a barricade to stop the riot police and armed soldiers from the Palace. As students from nearby dormitories joined them, protesters grew in numbers. Everything was improvised and they did not have any organized plan. The protestors fought the armed forces and defended themselves with sticks and pillboxes. Eventually, the troops succeeded in separating the protestors, putting an end to the rally. Many were severely injured, and since police forces retaliated with live bullets, it led to bloodshed. Bullets were shot at the protesters, killing four students. The armed forces were claimed to attack unarmed students. It was a seesaw battle between the youth and the military. Students and military alternatively held Mendiola Bridge, until nine o'clock in the evening, when finally it finally fell to the military. While troops were able to disperse the militants, they failed to clear the streets of M. Aguila, Legarda, and Claro M. Recto and in Quiapo from other rallyists. Doors were opened to these rallyists, and through gestures from people at second-floor windows, they were warned about the presence of armed forces in the streets. The January 30, 1970 rally received mixed reactions overseas. Eastern Sun, a newspaper from Singapore, wrote an editorial on the January 30 riots. This article mentioned that President Marcos was right for 'taking the hard line' in dealing with the demonstrators. Although the charge that these demonstrations were part of a Communist Chinese inspired insurrection were seen as exaggerated, they found the exaggeration to be necessary to emphasize this point. Independent Chinese newspaper in Hong Kong, however, found the idea that these students were in the January 30 riot to take over the government is excessive. While the article does not deny the possibility of the involvement of some communists in the violence, \\"to say that they were trying to occupy the presidential Palace in an armed uprising to set a Chinese-Communist type of ruling power was more than an exaggeration.\\" President Ferdinand Marcos saw the January 30 protest and siege in Malaca√±ang not only as a personal assault but also as an assault to the presidency itself. He thought of the protests as an insurrection, and only a part of a plot to overthrow the government by force. Juan Ponce Enrile, who was then Secretary of Justice, recalled in his memoir that at the time of the January 30 Malaca√±ang attack, President Marcos nearly announced Martial Law. President Marcos suspected that a coup was being arranged against him as none of his generals are present, and he immediately evacuated Imelda and their children to a navy ship in Manila Bay. = February 12:Rally at Plaza Miranda = After the violence of the Battle of Mendiola, the Movement for a Democratic Philippines (MDP) organized a rally at the Plaza Miranda outside the Quiapo Church on February 12, 1970. With ten to fifty thousand people present, it became known for being the largest rally to take place in Plaza Miranda. This really was nearly called off when some conservative MDP leaders initially agreed to have a discussion with the President Marcos that evening, about concessions he was supposedly willing to offer if the leaders would call off the rally. However, KM leaders insisted on proceeding and made assurances that provocateurs would be kept out of the proceedings. The protesters sat on the streets, climbed trees, and stood on the roofs of low buildings to spend hours listening to speakers discuss and oppose the concepts of imperialism, feudalism, and fascism. = February 18: First \\"People's Congress\\" and demonstration at the U.S. Embassy = The MDP-organized protest on February 18, 1970 was dubbed the \\"People's Congress,\\" and involved about five thousand protesters who gathered at Plaza Miranda. At some point during this gathering, a group of protesters left the Plaza Miranda venue to stage a demonstration at the U.S. Embassy, which was nearby. Chanting \\"Makibaka! Huwag matakot!,\\" some of them broke off from the crowd and marched toward the U.S. Embassy. This group attacked the embassy with rocks and pillboxes as a way of expressing their denunciation of U.S. imperialism, and accusing the US of being fascist and of supporting Marcos. This continued for hours, lasting until the evening before the police arrived. The next day, the American ambassador sent a note to the government protesting the \\"wanton vandalism\\" that took place the night before, and the Philippine government replied with a note of apology within three hours. = February 26: \\"Second People's Congress\\" demonstration = MDP militants planned what they dubbed a second \\"People's Congress\\" on February 26, 1970 despite not being granted a permit to rally. The radicals insisted on their right to assembly, insisting that the rally would go on with or without a permit. The Manila police and Philippine Constabulary Metropolitan Command (METROCOM) attacked the rallyists even before they settled down at Plaza Miranda, causing the militants to disperse. So the activists reassembled at the Sunken Garden outside the walls of Intramuros, and after a few speeches continued to march to the U.S. Embassy. They stoned the Embassy and fought against the police that arrived. The activists then fled and regrouped hours later on Mendiola to reenact the protest of January 30. The police retaliated by breaking into the Philippine College of Commerce, hitting the students and professors, and ransacking the offices and classrooms. = March 3: The People's March from Welcome Rotonda to Plaza Lawton = The protest of March 3, 1970 was organized by the MDP students and urban groups in support of jeepney drivers who held a citywide strike on that date to protest \\"tong\\"(bribe)-collecting traffic policemen. Dubbed the ‚ÄúPeoples‚Äô March,‚Äù it involved a protest march from Welcome Rotonda on the boundary of Quezon City and the City of Manila, and passed by Tondo and Plaza Lawton before ending up at the U.S. Embassy. According to reports, this march ended in one-sided battles between gun-toting police riot squads and stone-hurling demonstrators, seems to give people an endless number of reasons to hold mass gatherings of students, farmers, and laborers. Even though the protest involved long walks from one assembly point to another, the organizations participating in the march multiplied. When the protesters reached the U.S. Embassy, where they again struggled with the police. The police were more aggressive this time, chasing the activists all over the city. Enrique Sta. Brigida, a student of the Lyceum of the Philippines, was caught and tortured to death by the police. Poet Amado V. Hernandez wrote a poem, ‚ÄúEnrique Sta. Brigida: Paghahatid sa Imortalidad,‚Äù (Tagalog \\"Deliverance to Immortality\\") which was read at Sta Brigida's funeral on March 10. = March 17: Second \\"People‚Äôs March\\" and \\"People‚Äôs Tribunal\\" at Plaza Moriones = Militants organized a second \\"People‚Äôs March\\" on March 17, in what would come to be recognized as the last major demonstration during the First Quarter Storm proper. This second March was longer than the March 3 event. Since the protest focused on the issue of poverty, the march's route took it through the poor ghettoes of Manila. Finding police already positioned at the Embassy when they arrived, and wanting to avoid a confrontation, the activists instead proceeded to Mendiola, where they made bonfires in the middle of the road. But the police followed them to Mendiola, dispersing the activists by releasing tear gas.  Dissipation after March 17  The March 17 demonstration is generally acknowledged as the last of the major events of the First Quarter Storm, because the demonstrations had largely been led by student groups, who had at that point reached the end of the Philippines' school semester. Many of the students left Manila to go home to the provinces for summer vacation, leading to a lull in protest actions.Bonner, Raymond. Waltzing with a Dictator: The Marcoses and the Making of American Policy. New York, NY: Times Books, 1987. However, numerous protests, including the Diliman Commune and the Movement of Concerned Citizens for Civil Liberties rallies led by Senator Jose Diokno continued in the period between the dissipation of the First Quarter Storm and the 1972 declaration of Martial Law. Aftermath = Radicalization of the moderate opposition = Violent dispersals of various FQS protests were among the first watershed events in which large numbers of Filipino students of the 1970s were radicalized against the Marcos administration. Due to these dispersals, many students who had previously held ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù positions (i.e., calling for legislative reforms), such as like Edgar Jopson, became convinced that they had no choice but to call for more radical social change. Similar watershed events would later include the February 1971 Diliman Commune; the August 1971 suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in the wake of the Plaza Miranda bombing; the September 1972 declaration of Martial Law; the 1980 murder of Macli-ing Dulag; the August 1983 assassination of Ninoy Aquino; and eventually, allegations of cheating during the 1986 Snap Elections which led to the non-violent 1986 EDSA Revolution. In the aftermath of these events, Marcos lumped all of the opposition together and referred to them as communists, and many former moderates fled to the mountain encampments of the radical opposition to avoid being arrested by Marcos' forces. Those who became disenchanted with the excesses of the Marcos administration and wanted to join the opposition after 1971 often joined the ranks of the radicals, simply because they represented the only group vocally offering opposition to the Marcos government. = Leadup to Martial Law = The demonstrations that took place during the first quarter storm are historically remembered as the first stirrings of the social unrest which would eventually lead to Martial Law - what Petronilo Daroy referred to as \\"a torrent of mass protest actions against everything that was construed as ‚Äòestablishment.‚Äô\\" In an editorial published in Philippine Panorama, Fred Reyes remarked that these bloody demonstrations may be the signs of an upcoming revolution, shying away from 'traditional Filipino values' such as bahala na, pakikisama, and utang na loob that have long hindered radical change. He also stressed that while it seems to be clear to all that change was needed, no one seemed to know what change was needed. He also noted the slight difference in tone regarding communism, as people seemed to be more understanding of their cause. He had also noted that despite the government's accusations, no communists were produced from the riot groups. The First Quarter Storm was followed by a year of demonstrations, varying from picketing, long marches, live theater, people's tribunal, and parliament of the streets. These demonstrations contributed to the image of a communist insurgency, which was used as justification for the declaration of Martial Law. = Pro-Marcos responses =  Veterans' March for Democracy  The Veterans Federation of the Philippines arranged a \\"March for Democracy\\" where the veterans strode around Intramuros, Rizal Park, Luneta grandstand, and then to the Sunken Garden, where speeches and a pledging ceremony were held. Col. Simeon Medalla, head of the Veterans Federation of the Philippines, explains that the rally was not Marcos-inspired, contrary to allegations sprung from rumors of American officials or allies being seen at the rally and the fact that the President himself was the most decorated veteran of the previous war. Their purpose, rather, was to \\"preserve the ideals and principles for which the people fought during the war,\\" a statement inscribed on the large banner carried during the march. When the veterans' march was cast in a negative light by media the following morning, Medalla remarked in jest, \\"Was it because there was no violence in our rally?\\" On that note, Ben Florentino, head of the United Disabled Veterans Association of the Philippines, commented that if the 'young radical activists' had experienced the hardships of war as they had, then they would not be advocating violence. Florentino and Medalla further stressed that veterans were the first group to stage demonstrations for the sake of demanding legitimate reforms from the government. They also felt the need to call for reforms but believed that these should be achieved peacefully and undergoing democratic processes. COMELEC Chairman Jamie N. Ferrer attributed the student demonstrations to the rampant corruption in the political system, while Civil Service Commissioner Abelardo Subido attributed them to the lack of dialogue between the youth and their elders, calling on parents to tell their children \\"what we need is a change through peaceful means to achieve economic independence.\\" Although many veterans were gladdened by the spark of student activism, they denounced the emergence of some sectors seeking to harness student power for their own ends.  1970 Philippine Independence Day Celebration  On the evening of June 12, 1970, media reported that the 72nd anniversary of the declaration of Philippine independence would be celebrated differently from previous years. It was reported that there would not be a grand, colorful parade, in line with the Marcos administration's policy of fiscal restraint, but instead there would be a simple, public \\"military show\\" by the Philippine Military Academy, the Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, and the Blue Diamonds of the Philippine Air Force at eight o'clock in the morning. Furthermore, rather than tedious speeches in the middle of the day, the President would read a loyalty pledge to the Republic and the flag at seven o'clock in the morning, a time when demonstrators against the current regime could be avoided.  Discussions on Violence  = Demonstrations as 'portents of things to come' = When the news of the January 30 riots broke out, spectators, especially parents of the students participating in the demonstration, were appalled by the military behavior in these riots, questioning the need for armed military men at Mendiola. Participating groups of the said riots claimed that the violence was sparked by Malaca√±ang guards, who threw pellets at the protesters from the inside, thus provoking demonstrators to retaliate and to ram a fire truck into the Malaca√±ang No. 4 gate. These incidents of violence were heightened to bloodshed by the arrival of METROCOM and the Philippine Constabulary as some groups, such as Kabataang Makabayan, claim that the armed forces attacked the students, who were virtually unarmed. This brought into question the necessity of arms in instilling the change that these students were demanding. Dr. Nemesio Prudente, an educator and an ardent defender of students, predicted then that the January 26 and 30 riots were 'mere portents of what is yet to come if the leadership does not meet the demands of our students,' - demands which are clean, honest competent leadership, reforms, social justice, elimination of poverty, quality and inexpensive education for all, and the right to participate in decision making. He commented on the violence, saying that it will continue until there is no proper understanding and open communication between government leaders and student groups. These encounters exhibited the then growing prevalence of student activism, parallel to demonstrations in other countries wherein students played a large role such as the toppling of the Sukarno regime in Indonesia and the collapse of the Soviet Union and the 1991 August Coup and that through the Prague Spring. = Kabataang Makabayan's stand on violence = Since KM was founded under the aspiration of resuming and completing the Philippine Revolution of 1896, now fighting \\"a new type of colonialism,\\" it sought to inspire nationalism once more in a time wherein it was considered as a dangerous concept. The organization's positive aspirations, however, are overlooked by due to the negative image of communism, brought about by the news of communist insurgents in other parts of the world and individual actions of KM members themselves, including the dissident movement in Negros, the capture of Leoncio Co and other youths in their alleged involvement in a Stalin university in Tarlak, and the rumored activism of founder Jose Maria Sison, alias Commander Guerrero, in the Huk movement in Central Luzon. As said by Astorga-Garcia: > The KM aims to break this monopoly of power by allying with workers, > peasants, progressive intellectuals, professionals and the nationalist > bourgeoisie in an effort to arouse and mobilize the masses towards the > attainment of national freedom and democracy. This outlook, more than > anything else, explains the persistent anti-American imperialist and anti- > landlord tone in the programme, pronouncements and protest mass actions of > the KM. This explains why it is for the scrapping of the parity, the > abrogation of the Laurel-Langley, bases treaty, military assistance treaty, > mutual defense treaty‚Äîin short, the elimination of RP-US 'special > relations.' The KM stand on these and other important national issues have > always been pursued by its members with a militance no other youth > organization has equalled. That is why the military has long ago started a > hate-KM campaign that has been equally militant, although oftentimes > ridiculous and silly. Whenever violence erupts in a demonstration > participated in by the KM, the military authorities are quick in pinpointing > the KM as the instigator of violence. However, the group justifies this violence by considering it as an objective reality while maintaining their position that, while KM has taken part in numerous demonstrations that had led to violence, the riots have been incited by the police and not their members. The KM was more concerned with the \\"politicalization of the masses,\\" and if they wanted to stage an armed revolution, they would have come bearing arms to rallies.Torrevillas-Suarez, Domini. \\"Violence in the Streets: The Battle of Mendiola.\\" Philippine Panorama, February 15, 1970, 4-6.

He is best known as the lead vocalist, guitar and keyboard/synthesizer player for the long-running band Blue √ñyster Cult, with work on more than 20 albums. Much of his lyrical content relates to his lifelong interest in science fiction. Early life A native New Yorker, Bloom was born in Brooklyn, the youngest of three children, and grew up in Queens. His mother was a housewife, active in local charities and family life. His father ran a picture frame and print company in Manhattan. Bloom attended JHS 216 (George J. Ryan Junior High School), and then moved on to Woodmere Academy and Cheshire Academy in Connecticut. It was there that he purchased his first guitar, a $52 Harmony full-bodied electric. After graduating from Cheshire Academy in 1962, he went to Spain for the summer, studying at Menendez Pelayo University in Santander, before starting college in the fall. Bloom, known as \\"Manny\\" Bloom in college, attended Hobart College in Geneva, New York, studying modern languages. In 1964 he left early to work for a family car-importing company, but he returned a year later, partially out of concerns that if he was not in school, he would be picked up in the Vietnam draft. The group \\"Lost and Found\\", 1966. From left: Peter Haviland, Jeff Hayes, John Trivers, Bloom, and George FaustIn college, Bloom was involved with the casual forming of a couple of short-term bands for playing at local venues. One of these was Rick and the Ravons (Bloom being Rick). He also organized music for various fraternity parties. For one of them, he hired a band that later asked him to join. They renamed it as Lost and Found, with whom he performed off and on for a few years. The band was composed of George Faust on guitar, John Trivers on bass, Peter Haviland on lead guitar, Jeff Hayes as drummer, and Bloom singing. In 1963, Bloom was also exposed to the music of Wilmer and the Dukes, who made a profound impression on him. He attended over 100 of their performances, and he and his band Lost and Found opened for them when they came to play at Hobart. Other major influences were James Brown, and Ronnie James Dio. In Bloom's senior year, he was encouraged by his friends to join their Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He also found himself volunteering to do sound engineering at local college events (such as a performance by Iron Butterfly), simply because he could not stand how bad the sound was. It was through his efforts that the college finally updated to a better sound system, after he graduated in 1967 (receiving a BA in modern languages). Career = Summer of Love: 1967 = After college, Bloom toured with the band in upstate New York (he was the only one who had a van to transport equipment). The band had some membership changes and was renamed as Rock Garden. They made one attempt to record a single but could not land a contract, so they continued on with live performances and cover tunes, until the band broke up in July 1967. Though Bloom had applied and been accepted for graduate school at San Diego State University, he decided instead to spend the Summer of Love of 1967 as a drifter, pan-handling or selling sketches for $1 in Provincetown (P-town), Cape Cod, until he got a job washing dishes. On Labor Day, his college friend Trivers invited him to perform in Clayton, New York the next night. Despite the short notice, Bloom packed up and left Provincetown for good. Lost and Found re-formed and played through the rest of the season. = Soft White Underbelly: 1968‚Äì1971 = Soft White Underbelly promo, Dec 1968In 1968, Bloom moved to Plainview, Long Island to live with his sister. He obtained a job at Sam Ash Music in Hempstead, selling music equipment. One day in late 1968 some members of the band Soft White Underbelly, Donald Roeser (later Buck Dharma), Allen Lanier and Andrew Winters, entered the store. One of them spotted a photo that Bloom had put up as a joke‚Äîhe had placed an 8x10 glossy of his old band Lost and Found up on the wall with all the major bands such as the Rolling Stones and The Who. One of the SWU members recognized it because Les Braunstein, their lead singer, had also been a Hobart College alumnus, and had told his bandmates about the other college band. As Bloom talked with them about the photo, they struck up a friendship. Bloom ended up doing some sound engineering for them at the Electric Circus in Greenwich Village, and they mutually impressed each other enough that in November 1968, the band's manager, Sandy Pearlman, asked if Bloom would like to become their tour manager. Bloom moved into the group's house in Great Neck, New York in December 1968. = Blue √ñyster Cult: 1972‚Äìpresent = In April 1969, when lead singer Braunstein dropped out of the group, Bloom became the band's vocalist. The band went through several name changes, but in 1971 settled on Blue √ñyster Cult. Their first album was released by Columbia Records in 1972, and they were voted \\"Best New Band\\" by Creem magazine. In 1976 their platinum album Agents of Fortune with its hit \\"(Don't Fear) the Reaper\\" launched the band into international fame, though that particular song was sung and written by lead guitarist Buck Dharma. Both Creem readers and Rolling Stone critics voted \\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\" as the top single of the year. Bloom bought his own house in Great Neck in 1976, where he still resides to this day. Bloom has been one of the longtime members of the band throughout the decades, along with original member Buck Dharma (it is estimated that they have given over 4,000 live performances). He has co- written many of the band's songs, and often collaborates with writers both inside and outside the music industry. =Outside work= Bloom is known for being an avid reader, especially science fiction and fantasy novels. He once sent a fan letter to English science-fiction author Michael Moorcock, and then collaborated with him on three songs. \\"Black Blade\\" was written from the point of view of Moorcock's Elric character, and the other two were \\"The Great Sun Jester\\" and \\"Veteran of the Psychic Wars,\\" the latter of which was used in the original Heavy Metal movie. In 1987, Bloom and Moorcock performed the song live at the Dragon*Con convention in Atlanta, Georgia. Bloom also collaborated with author Eric Van Lustbader on the song \\"Shadow Warrior,\\" and in 1998 and 2001 with cyberpunk author John Shirley on the Heaven Forbid and Curse of the Hidden Mirror albums. In 2006, Bloom began a partnership with artist Philippe Renaudin, to create and sell six elaborately painted custom-made guitars, each one of which interprets a different Blue √ñyster Cult song, and each of which was played during B√ñC performances.

Early history Goliath Atlas (1934) The first models were three- wheeler trucks derived from the motorcycle based Blitzkarren, Goliath Rapid, and Standard previously built by Borgward. In 1926 appeared the Goliath K1 four-wheeler freight truck with open cab, followed by the 1929 Goliath Express, and with closed driver cab the 1932 Goliath Atlas, also sold as Hansa-Lloyd Atlas. The first passenger car was the Goliath Pionier in 1931, which still had three wheels and a one-cylinder engine. Until 1934, 4,000 of these small cars were produced in various types of body. In 1933, Goliath F200 and F400 three-wheeler trucks derived were derived from Goliath Pionier. The Pionier was redesigned to its successor marketed under the brand Hansa as models 400 and 500 four-wheel passenger car with a sheet metal body. In 1938 also changed to a sheet metal body were the FW200 and FW400 as successor of the F200 and F400.

It includes \\"Sitamoia\\" and \\"Little Darling\\", both featuring Gary Moore during his first brief stint with the group, the first of which was previously unreleased. The time frame of the album stretches from 1971 to 1974.

History = 1976‚Äì79 = The Fleshtones were formed in 1976 in Whitestone, New York, by Keith Streng (born September 18, 1955, New York, New York) and Jan Marek Pakulski (born August 23, 1956, Lewiston, Maine), two roommates who discovered that a previous tenant had left behind some instruments in the basement of the house they were renting. Streng, on guitar, and Pakulski, on bass, were soon joined by neighborhood friends Peter Zaremba (born September 16, 1954, Queens, New York), on harmonica, keyboards, and vocals, and Lenny Calderon (born 1958, New York City), on drums. The Fleshtones debuted at CBGB on May 19, 1976. Starting in 1978, the group was often joined onstage, as well as on record, by Action Combo, brothers Gordon (alto sax and harmonica) and Brian (tenor sax) Spaeth. Gordon Spaeth (September 21, 1951 ‚Äì March 8, 2005) became an official band member in 1983. In the late 1970s, The Fleshtones earned a local following and played often in Manhattan at CBGB and Max's Kansas City. Later, they found a favorite venue at Club 57 on St. Mark's Place. The Fleshtones were the first band to be booked or to play at several famous venues, including Irving Plaza and Danceteria in Manhattan, Maxwell's in Hoboken, New Jersey, and the original 9:30 Club in Washington D.C. The Fleshtones shared a rehearsal space with The Cramps on the Bowery in 1977. The following year, The Fleshtones signed with Marty Thau's Red Star Records, and recorded their first album. In addition, filmmaker/artist M. Henry Jones and the band produced Soul City, a performance-animation video composed of hand-painted cutouts that is a historic representation of the band and Jones' art form. The Fleshtones' first single, \\"American Beat\\" was issued on Red Star in 1979. = 1980‚Äì89 = Tickets for the Fleshtones concerts at the Gibus club in Paris, March 1985, where the Speed Connection album was recorded In 1980, with the Red Star Records album not released (but later issued on cassette on ROIR, and subsequently on CD and vinyl), the Fleshtones were signed by Miles Copeland III at I.R.S. Records, where they worked with producers Richard Mazda and Richard Gottehrer. It was at this time that the band replaced Calderon with drummer Bill Milhizer (born September 21, 1948, Troy, New York), and appeared in the British punk/new wave film Urgh! A Music War, and released its first EP Up-Front. Four albums on I.R.S. followed: Roman Gods (1982), Hexbreaker!! (1983), and the live Speed Connection and Speed Connection II (1985). In 1982, they appeared on Dick Clark's American Bandstand TV show. In 1984 they re- recorded \\"American Beat\\" as part of the soundtrack of the Tom Hanks's movie Bachelor Party. Despite having a large cult following, the band never achieved commercial success: Roman Gods debuted at No. 174 on Billboard‚Äôs album chart, the highest position that a Fleshtones album has attained. Zaremba was the host of I.R.S. Records Presents The Cutting Edge on MTV from 1984 to 1987. The I.R.S. Records-produced show featured up and coming underground artists. The program was short-lived but the format prefigured 120 Minutes. Zaremba's MC talents surfaced again in the late 1990s at New York City's \\"Cavestomp\\" Garage Rock festivals. In the mid-1980s, The Fleshtones regularly played at the Pyramid Club on Avenue A in the East Village, and were instrumental in helping to start Wigstock, the drag queen festival that became a New York City staple. In the late 1980s, The Fleshtones were without major-label support, though they continued to tour America and Europe steadily, including shows opening for Chuck Berry and James Brown. In 1987, The Fleshtones made an appearance on the final episode of Andy Warhol's Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes, an MTV program, during which they backed up famed English stage actor Ian McKellen as he recited William Shakespeare's Twentieth Sonnet. The Fleshtones recorded the title track to the 1987 camp-horror film I Was a Teenage Zombie. They released the albums Fleshtones vs. Reality (studio) in 1987 and Soul Madrid (live) in 1989. I.R.S. Records released a best-of compilation, Living Legends, in 1989. In late 1986, Pakulski left the Fleshtones. He was replaced by Robert Burke Warren, who left the band in 1988. Fred Smith of Television and Andy Shernoff of The Dictators were interim bass players in the studio and on tour until 1990. =1990‚Äì2000= Ken Fox (born February 16, 1961, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) joined the Fleshtones on bass in July 1990. Fox had formed Raving Mojos in Toronto and also played with Joan Osborne and in Jason & the Scorchers. Since Fox joined, the Fleshtones lineup has remained stable. In 1992, the Fleshtones signed with Ichiban Records, where they stayed until the label's demise, releasing the albums Powerstance (1992), Beautiful Light (1994), Laboratory of Sound (1995), and More Than Skin Deep (1998). The Fleshtones worked with musician-producers Dave Faulkner, Peter Buck, and Steve Albini. =2001‚Äìpresent= The Fleshtones were one of the last bands to play at Windows on the World atop the World Trade Center; they played a show, there five weeks before the 9/11 attacks, and in 2002 played at a Night of Remembrance and Hope festival at CBGB. In the 2000s and 2010s, in addition to self-producing in Paul Johnson's Compactor basement studio in Brooklyn, New York, The Fleshtones worked with musician-producers Rick Miller, Jim Diamond, Lenny Kaye, and Ivan Julian. The Fleshtones played at a CBGB 30th Anniversary show along with The Dictators in December 2003, and in August 2004 played Little Steven's Underground Garage Festival at Randalls Island in New York City with 39 other bands, including The New York Dolls, Iggy Pop, The Strokes, and Bo Diddley. The Fleshtones signed with Yep Roc Records in 2003, which has released the albums Do You Swing? (2003), Beachhead (2005), Take A Good Look (2008), Stocking Stuffer (2008), Brooklyn Sound Solution (2011), Wheel Of Talent (2014), The Band Drinks For Free (2016), and Live at Yep Roc 15 (2020), as well as the EP Quatro X Quatro (2012), the compilation Budget Buster (2017), and several singles. In September 2016, the Fleshtones toured China for the first time in the band's career. The tour was organized by Shanghai- based punk band Round Eye. Book, tribute, feature documentary and reissues *In 2007, Continuum Books (now Bloomsbury) published Sweat: The Story of The Fleshtones, America's Garage Band, an authorized biography by Joe Bonomo. Camion Blanc released a French-language edition, The Fleshtones: Histoire d‚Äôun Groupe Garage Am√©ricain, in 2012. *Vindicated! A Tribute to The Fleshtones was released in 2007 on vinyl by Larsen Records (France) and on CD by Dirty Water Records (UK). The album features 23 international bands (including Hoodoo Gurus, the Nomads with Handsome Dick Manitoba, the Slickee Boys, the Woggles, Snax, the Swingin' Neckbreakers, Richard Mazda, the Subway Surfers, the Insomniacs, and others) covering songs spanning the Fleshtones' career. *A feature documentary directed by Geoffray Barbier, Pardon Us For Living, But The Graveyard Is Full, was released from Cold Cuts Productions in 2009. *In 2010, the Australian label Raven released a CD compilation of the Fleshtones' I.R.S.

Sail twist is a phenomenon in sailing where the head of the sail is at a different angle of incidence from the foot of the sail in order to change the lift distribution with height. Twist is measured by comparing the angle of a straight line between the leading edge (luff) and trailing edge (leech) with that of the boom. Some twist is desirable, but too much can induce weather helm or ruin the slot between the mainsail and jib. Three sail shape controls which control the leech tension, and therefore sail twist, are the mainsheet, the boom vang and the traveler. The mainsheet pulls the boom (and therefore the foot of the sail) primarily inwards at lower points of sail and downwards at higher points of sail. Manipulation of the traveler can counteract this because it always pulls the boom laterally. The vang on the other hand does the opposite, it always changes the height of the boom. Computer cut sails can produce the amount of twist specified by the sailmaker, and in different conditions, different amounts of twist may be desirable. Less twist is generally desirable in light air conditions and slackening the luff tension will tighten the leech of the sail. This moves the center of effort on the sail toward the trailing edge and reduces twist thus making the sail more powerful but vulnerable to stalling.

Operational career The locomotive was built at GWR's Swindon Works, out-shopped in June 1930. For most of its working life it was allocated to Newton Abbot and Laira (Plymouth), working express passenger trains to and from Devon to London Paddington. Withdrawn from Cardiff in June 1962, it was sent to Swindon for breaking up. However, in light of the installation of a new bridge west of Bristol towards South Wales, it was coupled to its twin, 6024 King Edward I, and towed to the bridge for weight testing purposes. With both locomotives now closer to South Wales than Swindon, the decision was made to sell them to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry Island. Preservation Whilst King Edward I was saved in 1974, King Edward II remained at the scrapyard due to the rear driving wheels being flame-cut following a derailment at Woodham's. However, as part of the 150th anniversary of GWR's formation in 1985, the hulk was acquired by Harvey's of Bristol, and was moved to a bay platform at Bristol Temple Meads railway station called the Fish Dock. Restoration King Edward II at Woodhams' Scrapyard, in 1982 The Brunel Engineering Centre Trust, under a Manpower Services Commission (MS) scheme, completely dismantled 6023 and restoration began. Work continued until the autumn of 1988, when the MS scheme funding was withdrawn and the future of 6023 was cast into doubt. 6023 was then bought by the Great Western Society (GWS) and moved to Didcot in March 1990 for its restoration to continue. The restoration has included the casting of new rear driving wheels in 1994, followed by re-wheeling the chassis in 1995. The casting is notable since it is thought to be the first wheels to be created for a standard gauge locomotive in preservation. The damaged wheels were also acquired by the GWS at Didcot and can today be seen on display there. Unlike the other preserved \\"King\\" class locomotives, the GWS decided to restore 6023 to its as-built single-chimney configuration. All \\"Kings\\" had been converted to double chimneys under British Railways ownership, which improved performance and efficiency but changed the original appearance. On 12 April 2010, King Edward IIs boiler passed its steam test, and on 20 January 2011 it moved for the first time under its own power since 1962. It was due to re- enter service on 2 April 2011. Initially, King Edward II has been painted in the early BR express passenger blue livery, rather than the later standard BR Brunswick Green livery currently carried by 6000 King George V and 6024 King Edward I. Return to service King Edward II hauling a train on the Mid- Norfolk Railway, in 2011 The locomotive re-entered passenger service on the Mid-Norfolk Railway on 4 June 2011, as part of a running-in programme leading to the engine's return to the main line. During the road journey to Dereham, the locomotive lost its safety valve cover, with the Mid-Norfolk offering a cash reward for its safe return. The cover was restored to the locomotive by Sunday 5 June. On return to Didcot, it was found that the firebox and boiler stays had broken, resulting in the need for a large amount of remedial work to the boiler. On 6 September 2012, the locomotive was moved to Loughborough on the Great Central Railway for firebox repairs, which were completed during early 2013.Didcot Railway Centre newsletter, October 2012 The locomotive then made a series of appearances on the Great Central Railway, for both testing and running-in purposes but was later returned to Didcot where it was to be prepared to operate on the main line. In 2014, the GWS was given derogation by Network Rail to use a portable GSM-R radio unit on 6023. This unit could then also be used on other GWS locomotives yet to work on the mainline, such as 2999 Lady of Legend and 4079 Pendennis Castle. Owing to height restriction rules the locomotive had to be reduced in height to comply with the current Network Rail loading gauge (the max permitted height for steam engines being 13ft 1in and the original height of the kings being 4 inches over at 13ft 5in). This required the fitment of a cutdown cab and shorter safety valve cover alongside a shorter chimney. The shorter chimney however adversely affected the draughting. A new design of blastpipe with four nozzles was designed and fitted to the engine which after early indications had eliminated the draughting issues on the engine. The other preserved \\"King\\" class locomotives 6000 King George V and 6024 King Edward I are both fitted with double chimneys and therefore it was not possible simply to use the same proven blastpipe and chimney arrangement on 6023. Owing to the amount of time the rectification work took alongside how short the amount of time was left on the engine's current boiler ticket, it was originally decided to postpone the engine's mainline certification until after the engine's next overhaul was completed. An announcement from Didcot later on regarding the ceasing of mainline operations owing to costs and wishing to get more use of their engines, 6023 would now not be undergoing certification to run on the mainline.https://www.railadvent.co.uk/2019/12/steam-locomotive-6023-king- edward-ii-retired-from-mainline-work.html/amp 6023 retired from mainline work With mainline equipment no longer needed the engine will be re-fitted with its original cab and later on its original height safety valve cover and chimney which will also include re-fitting its original blastpipe. It is not however expected to undergo an overhaul straight away until space is available following completion of additional loco overhauls.

The wilderness borders Lake Chelan National Recreation Area and North Cascades National Park and the Stephen Mather Wilderness to the northwest. It was designated with the passage of the Washington Wilderness Act of 1984, on lands occupied by the old Chelan Division of the Washington Forest Reserve, now part of both the Okanogan and Wenatchee national forests. Habitat There are 63 lakes, many too small to have ever been named, often located in the high country without trail access. The wilderness encompasses a diverse mixture of dense forest, meadows, alpine slopes, geology, and high country. The open forest below tree line is home to bears and mule deer. Snow often covers much of the area from mid or late October through late June. Trails Approximately 194 miles of trails traverse the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness. Trails tend to be steady climbs into high basins and glacial cirques with lakes. The south facing portion of the range has more open, rolling high country that falls off very steeply into the Lake Chelan valley. All trailheads on the south side, on Lake Chelan, must be gained via a regularly scheduled ferry boat or a private craft. Trails entering from the west first cross North Cascades National Park or Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.

Although part of the wilderness lies in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, the largest section falls within the boundaries of Okanogan National Forest, which has responsibility for the wilderness's management. The wilderness is bordered by the Stephen Mather Wilderness to the west. The northern boundary of the wilderness is the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Across the border are Manning Provincial Park and Cathedral Provincial Park. The wilderness area is adjacent to the Ross Lake National Recreation Area to the west, and North Cascades National Park beyond that. The Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail has its northernmost section in this wilderness. The western part of the wilderness features dramatic views and peaks of the northern Washington Cascade Mountains while the eastern section is known for its grasslands and Alpine tundra. The tallest point in the Pasayten is Jack Mountain. The Pasayten is traditional hunting territory of the Nlaka'pamux peoples of the Fraser Canyon and Nicola Country along with adjoining parts of the Cascade Range, although there are no Nlaka'pamux populations on the Washington side of the border. Habitat Rugged ridges in the west flatten into more open plateaus toward the east, with deep drainages on both sides. Its diverse forest changes from fir, cedar, western hemlock in the west to fir, pine, and larch in the east. This region provides habitat for deer, moose, mountain goats, mountain lions, bighorn sheep, the gray wolf, and is home to the largest population of lynx in the Lower 48. Snow falls between October and May, and the hard packed snow may block the high western-side trails sometimes until early August. Eastern-side trails are usually free of snow by early July. Trails More than 600 miles of trails provide access to the wilderness, many of them deceptively gentle at the start and become progressively difficult as they climb up multiple switchbacks into the higher elevations. The Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) crosses the area north-south for about 32 miles. The Boundary Trail begins in the southeast corner of the wilderness and meanders north and west for over 73 miles near the Canada‚ÄìUS border to eventually join the Pacific Crest Trail. Some trails are regularly used by horsemen who frequent the wilderness. Stock animals are used to supply camping gear, provide transportation, and carry tools and equipment for trail repair and improvement as the wilderness does not allow motorized or even wheeled equipment. Although popular trails are cleared and maintained every year, it is important to note that a large amount of trails are abandoned, closed, or otherwise not maintained. Some of these trails are still listed in the United States Forest Service maps of the area, while other simply appear as unmarked trail junctions. Because of the lack of maintenance of certain trails and size of the wilderness, some areas are very seldom visited except by the most intrepid of individuals. For the general public, it is recommended that one possess a strong knowledge of map use and other navigational tools to explore the wilderness in depth.

He has played as a touring member of Green Day since 1997. He is also the guitarist/vocalist for the Californian punk band Pinhead Gunpowder, and co-founder of Adeline Records alongside Billie Joe Armstrong, and guitarist and lead vocalist for the Green Day side project The Coverups. In late 2014, he was diagnosed with tonsil cancer, which has since been treated. Career = Other musical acts (1992‚Äìpresent) = White performs with The Big Cats. In the summer of 1992, White filled in guitar duties at the last minute for Bay Area punk band Monsula, who were performing at Little Rock, AR club Vino's. After the performance, Jason toured as guitarist for the band and eventually relocated to the Bay Area after the breakup of Chino Horde in summer 1993. White joined the Big Cats in 1996, after the temporary departure of bassist Josh Bentley, and took over guitar duties in 2000 after the death of guitarist Shannon Yarbrough. The group is a side project of many musicians, playing live very rarely. Their newest record, On Tomorrow, was released in 2007. Because of Pinhead Gunpowder's infamy for sporadic get-togethers, White and Gunpowder bassist Bill Schneider began looking to form another band that would be a group the two could focus on. After recruiting Schneider's brother Greg Schneider to join and finally convincing Willie Samuels to play drums, The Influents were formed. White and Greg would become the focus of the band, splitting songwriting duties, as well as singing time. Bill Schneider left the band on good terms after the group's first album Check Please to focus on his drum shop and was soon replaced by Johnnie Wentz. The new line-up soon recorded a follow up, Some of the Young, and went on tour. In 2006, Jason recorded a cover of The Replacements \\"Torture\\" for the Replacements Cover compilation, \\"We'll Inherit the Earth\\". He's also featured in the May 2007 release, Towncraft, a documentary covering twenty years of the punk music scene in Little Rock, AR, White's home. That same year, White played with Green Day in the video for the cover of \\"Working Class Hero.\\" =Green Day and related work (1994‚Äìpresent)= As a friend of punk rock trio Green Day, he appeared in the \\"When I Come Around\\" video, where he is seen kissing a girl (his real-life girlfriend at the time). In 1994, White joined punk quartet Pinhead Gunpowder after the departure of singer/guitarist Sarah Kirsch (with whom White had played the previous year in Sixteen Bullets). When Green Day/Pinhead Gunpowder lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong founded Adeline Records in 1997, White helped him run it. He re-appeared with Armstrong for two Green Day shows in 1999, both of which raised money for the Bridge School Benefit. With the release of American Idiot, White was required again to play with the band during the supporting tour of the album. In February 2005, Jason got married. That year, he played with Green Day in their video, \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\"‚Äîthe first time that any musician outside the trio appeared as a performer in a Green Day video. He also appears along the band in their 2005 live CD/DVD Bullet in a Bible. In April 2007, White and his wife joined Armstrong and his family in their Spring Break working with Habitat For Humanity and writing a diary for fan site GreenDay.net. In 2008, White joined Green Day's side project Foxboro Hot Tubs as lead guitarist along with Kevin Preston of Prima Donna on rhythm guitar. In 2009, he toured with Green Day in support for their latest record, 21st Century Breakdown. White made his fourth appearance on a Green Day video for \\"21 Guns\\" and his fifth in \\"Last of the American Girls\\"; prior to this, and not including his live appearances on \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"East Jesus Nowhere\\", he had appeared in three videos: \\"When I Come Around\\", \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\", and \\"Working Class Hero\\". On July 13, 2010, Max Recordings released White's debut 45 single‚Äî\\"Hungover\\" b/w \\"I'm a Mess\\". He appeared once again as Green Day's sideman for their 2011 live album Awesome As Fuck. White is credited with contributing \\"Guitar\\" in the press release of Green Day's ninth, tenth, and eleventh studio albums ¬°Uno!, ¬°Dos!, and ¬°Tr√©!. In addition, he appears in photographs with the band. He was not inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. In 2016, the band said that he would not appear on their upcoming album.

The park district is fully supported by a levy, which voters are periodically asked to approve. Rangers are commissioned peace officers who provide safety and security by enforcing the park district's rules, regulations, state, and local laws. History Akron Metropolitan Park District is now Summit Metro Parks In times of war, people often look for ways to escape the news and demands of the era. During World War I, Americans increasingly looked to parks and natural areas for temporary diversions. Congress responded by creating the National Park Service in 1916, and the Ohio General Assembly made possible the formation of metropolitan park districts the following year. In July 1917, Cleveland Metroparks became the first metropolitan park district in the State of Ohio. On December 31, 1921, Metro Parks (then called the Akron Metropolitan Park District) became the second park system established under Chapter 1545 of the Ohio Revised Code. F.A. Seiberling, founder of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, was named commissioner in 1925. Progress was slow in the appointment of the first commissioners, perhaps due to the post-war economy. After more than a year, Summit County Probate Judge Lewis D. Slusser finally appointed James Shaw, Maude I. Milar and Charles B. Raymond. The trio's first meeting was May 15, 1923. The board considered several recreation projects, but things were generally slow-moving until 1925, when Shaw was replaced by Edmund D. Eckroad, chief engineer for the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company, a predecessor of Ohio Edison, and Raymond was replaced by Frank A. Seiberling, founder of Akron's Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. With new board members in place, famous landscape architects the Olmsted Brothers were asked in May 1925 to create a countywide park plan and identify sites that were suitable for park use. Their famous father, Frederick Law Olmsted, designed major parks throughout the country, most notably New York's Central Park. The accomplished Olmsted Brothers, John C. and Frederick Jr., worked on parks in Baltimore, Seattle and New York. In June, as Akron celebrated its centennial, Seiberling publicly accepted the first gift of land ‚Äì a small, triangular plot on N. Portage Path with 150 feet of frontage at the intersection of Merriman Road. The land, donated by Joseph Courtney of the Courtney Dairy Company, was named Courtney Park. A boulder and bronze plaque were later dedicated by the Daughters of the American Revolution to commemorate the site. This bronze relief at the intersection of North Portage Path and Merriman Road commemorates the site of Courtney Park. In 1926, the superintendent of Akron's city parks, Harold S. Wagner, was appointed the first director-secretary of the young park district. In his formative years, Wagner worked in Boston with the Olmsted Brothers, and later on projects owned by Seiberling. Between the late 1920s and the end of 1930, more than 1,000 acres were donated. Thanks to the generosity of prosperous local land owners, the young park system now included 1,600 acres in five reservations. To fund park projects and land acquisition, voters passed a .10-mill levy in November 1928. Less than a year after the passage of the levy, the stock market crashed. Losses would reach $15 billion nationwide. Factories closed, banks failed and jobs became increasingly scarce. The Hoover administration took several steps to combat the Great Depression, but instability continued. After the 1932 presidential election, Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal would boost the economy, and the creation of a Civilian Conservation Corps, which put millions of laborers to work nationwide, enabled Metro Parks to launch new parks and complete many projects. Today, Metro Parks manages , including 14 developed parks, six conservation areas and more than of trails, with of the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail. Annual attendance averages 4.5 million visitors. Parks The Valley from N Main Street *Cascade Valley/North in Akron Named for Sherman and Mary Schumacher, who donated 171 acres to Metro Parks in 1968, Schumacher Valley remains one of the most rugged areas within the city of Akron. Located in the valley's pre-glacial bedrock canyon are steep-cut ravines indicative of the Cuyahoga River's tributary streams. A canopy of oak, American beech, sassafras and black cherry provides cover for smaller shrubs. There are herbs and wildflowers, including spring beauty, Jack-in-the-pulpit, rue anemone and jewelweed. Great horned owls, chickadees and six species of woodpecker take cover here. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Schumacher Trail 1.2 miles; Valley Link Trail 2.8 miles), Picnicking *Cascade Valley/South in Akron In 1833, hydraulic engineer and entrepreneur Eliakim Crosby built the Cascade Race, a waterway that powered the mills and businesses along the Ohio & Erie Canal. The Cascade Race helped transform Akron into a boomtown. Years later, Crosby built the failed Chuckery Race; traces of it can still be seen in this Metro Park. Today, fish here are prey for belted kingfishers and great blue or green- backed herons. Beautiful white trillium grows in the floodplain woods each spring beside wild ginger and several types of violets. Summer and fall wildflowers also flourish, illuminating the landscape. Several rare and unique natural features can be found within the Chuckery Area. South of the entrance drive, near the intersection of the Chuckery Trail, is a meadow that harbors many unusual plants and several species of showy wildflowers. Just up the hill from the meadow is prairie, where wild lupines bloom about mid-May. Other rare species can be found individually throughout the park, including butternut trees ‚Äì a species surviving despite the butternut canker disease threatening their range. Less conspicuous, but no less rare, are crinkled hairgrass, satin brome and southern hairy rock cress. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Chuckery Trail 2.4 miles; Highbridge Trail 3.2 miles; Overlook 0.5 miles; Oxbow Trail 1.2 miles), Baseball/Softball, Cross-country Skiing, Fishing, Picnicking, Sledding, Soccer *Cascade Locks in Akron Here, along the Towpath Trail, the Cascade Locks tell the story of Akron's early industry. The steepest section of the Ohio & Erie Canal was between Akron and the Little Cuyahoga River. In a single mile, 15 locks, or \\"steps,\\" were necessary to enable boats to climb the Continental Divide. Locks 10 through 16 form the Cascade Locks Area. The two buildings north of the parking lot and adjacent to Lock 15 are some of the oldest structures in Akron. The Mustill House and store, built between 1825 and 1850, served the local community and the people traveling the canal. The area was designated as National Historic District in 1992 and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Present throughout the area are native wildflower species, flowers brought by immigrants from Europe, and weeds carried by man, horse and canal boat. The tree population reflects both invasive plants and native trees that are able to flourish in inner-city conditions. Birds seen in this area include robins, blue jays, sparrows, cardinals and red-tailed hawks. ACTIVITIES: Hiking, Picnicking *Deep Lock Quarry in Peninsula Within Deep Lock Quarry lies Lock 28, which at 17 feet was the deepest lock on the Ohio & Erie Canal, and an old quarry from which blocks of Berea sandstone were cut for the canal locks and other local structures. Ferdinand Schumacher, who is credited with introducing oatmeal to America by supplying it to Union troops during the Civil War, purchased a portion of the quarry in 1879. The sandstone found in the quarry was ideal for mill stones, which were used to remove the outer hulls of oats processed at Akron's American Cereal Works (later Quaker Oats). Stone was last taken from the quarry in the 1930s, when the Civilian Conservation Corps used the sandstone to construct several Metro Parks facilities, including Pioneer Shelter in Goodyear Heights Metro Park. Deep Lock Quarry became a Metro Park in 1934. Today, the park is home to more Ohio buckeye trees than any other Metro Park in Summit County. The old canal bed is home to frogs, turtles and salamanders. A shallow swamp has developed on the quarry floor, where rose pink (an herb) and the invasive narrow-leaved cattail grow. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Buckeye Trail; Cuyahoga Trail 13.1 miles; Quarry Trail 1.2 miles), Fishing, Picnicking *Firestone in Akron Dairy cows once grazed the hillsides of the area known today as Firestone Metro Park. In 1949, Metro Parks received a gift of 89 acres from the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Acquisitions of nearby parcels expanded the park to 258 acres. In 1956, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources completed construction of a nearby dam, intended to create a reservoir for industrial water needs. As the reservoir of the adjacent Firestone Golf Course filled, the water table rose downstream, forming the large wetland and marshy meadows of Firestone Metro Park. Along with the Tuscarawas River and Tuscarawas Race, which once channeled water to the Ohio & Erie Canal, the area is home to fish, crayfish, frogs and turtles. The meadows and forest shelter foxes, coyotes, raccoons, skunks, muskrats, rabbits, mice, voles and moles, along with many beautiful summer and fall wildflowers. More than 175 bird species have been sighted in Firestone Metro Park, including various types of wrens, thrushes, warblers, woodpeckers, herons and ducks. A number of different raptors ‚Äì including bald eagles ‚Äì have also been spotted. A note to visitors: Poison sumac is found in the wet areas of Firestone Metro Park. This small tree/shrub contains a powerful skin irritant, similar to that of poison ivy. To avoid it, stay on designated trails. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Redwing Trail 1.1 miles; Walking Course 0.9 miles; Willow Trail 1.6 miles), Cross-country Skiing, Fishing, Picnicking, Sledding *Furnace Run in Richfield The 890-acre Furnace Run Metro Park began in 1929 when the family of Charles Francis Brush Jr. donated 272 acres to Metro Parks. Much of the park was developed by work relief crews during the 1930s. Brushwood Lake, a once-popular swimming spot before erosion and sedimentation forced its closing in 1956, was created by diverting the natural flow of the Furnace Run. Every March and April, thousands of daffodils bloom along the H.S. Wagner Daffodil Trail. Wagner, the first director of Metro Parks, owned the land off Brush Road and planted the first bulbs along the trail. After he retired in 1958, he sold the property to Metro Parks and the land became part of Furnace Run Metro Park. Today, along the Old Mill trail, be sure to look for the Brush Family marker, which reads: \\"To all those who love as he loved the far sky and smiling land.\\" Just south of Brushwood Lake flows a recently restored stretch of stream. The award-winning environmental project recreated several thousand feet of habitat for aquatic wildlife and native fish, including a thriving population of rainbow darters, a sensitive species. The park contains beech-maple woods, acres of spring wildflowers ‚Äì including trillium and Virginia bluebells ‚Äì and deep ravines. Birds spotted in Furnace Run Metro Park include a variety of owls, hawks, herons, warblers and waterfowl. Downstream from the lake, the wet woods of sycamores, black walnuts, willows and shrubs welcome an occasional family of beavers. Brushwood Lake is home to fish, frogs and other aquatic wildlife. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Daffodil Trail 0.6 miles; Old Mill Trail 1.0 miles; Rock Creek Trail 1.2 miles), Cross-country Skiing, Fishing, Ice Skating, Picnicking, Sledding *Goodyear Heights in Akron Goodyear Heights Metro Park opened in 1930 after land was donated by Akron's Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and the park district purchased 37 acres from resident Gilbert Waltz. During the Depression, Metro Parks acquired additional acres by paying delinquent taxes on surrounding properties. In the 1950s, the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company donated more land. Thousands of pines and tulip trees were planted in the park. During World War II, Victory Gardens were planted along Newton Street on the former Waltz farm. In 1957, the Charles Goodyear Memorial Pavilion was constructed. It served as the park district's headquarters until 1974, when the offices were moved to Sand Run Metro Park. Today, the pines planted in this 410-acre park are slowly giving way to black cherries, oaks and tuliptrees through natural succession. Elsewhere, beech trees, sugar maples, basswoods, pin oaks, red maples and blackgum trees grow. In the north-central section, acidic soils support sassafras and sarsaparilla, species that were once used in beverage making. Along the edge of Alder Pond, a cattail marsh provides good wildlife habitat. The pond supports sphagnum moss and yellow birch trees, muskrats, nesting Canada geese and mallards. Late spring is a great time to view snapping turtles, some up to 20 pounds, basking in the sun. The park's woods are home to owls and other wildlife. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Alder Trail 1.4 miles, Parcours Trail 1.8 miles, Piney Woods Trail 2.0 miles), Baseball/Softball, Cross-country Skiing, Fishing, Picnicking, Sledding *Gorge in Cuyahoga Falls In 1759, a 12-year-old girl was captured in Pennsylvania by Delaware Indians and reportedly brought to a cave in present- day Gorge Metro Park, where she lived as a child of Chief Netawatwees. Young Mary Campbell, for whom the cave is named, unwittingly became the first white child in what was then the wild frontier of the Western Reserve. Mary later settled with the tribe in a village along the banks of the Cuyahoga River, not far from the cave. She was released in 1764 after a treaty ended the French and Indian War. Thousands of years before Mary's adventures, the Gorge was cut when glacial debris blocked the former route of the Cuyahoga River (near present-day downtown Akron) and caused the river to find a new course. Today, the rushing water flows over a shale riverbed, between ledges made of Sharon conglomerate sandstone. Oak, blackgum, tulip and yellow birch trees are common in the woods that cover the valley walls. This 155-acre Metro Park was made possible in 1930, when the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company, the predecessor of Ohio Edison, donated 144 acres of land to Metro Parks. Previously, the area hosted a park of a different sort ‚Äì the High Bridge Glens Amusement Park, which opened in 1882 and featured a thrilling roller coaster and a dance hall. It contains the FirstEnergy Dam. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Glens Trail 1.8 miles, Gorge Trail 1.8 miles, Highbridge Trail 3.2 miles), Fishing, Ice Skating, Picnicking *Hampton Hills in Akron and Cuyahoga Falls In 1964 the City of Akron needed flat land on which to build a water tower. It leased 116 acres of woods and ravines to Metro Parks in exchange for land within Goodyear Heights Metro Park. Three years later, Rhea H. and E. Reginald Adam donated 162 acres of adjacent farm land to Metro Parks, and the 278-acre Hampton Hills Metro Park was born. In 2010, the park district signed a lease for the adjacent Hardy Road landfill, bringing the park to its current size of 655 acres. More than 10,000 years ago, glaciers retreated from Northeast Ohio, carving ravines and valleys. The glacially-formed Adam Run Valley is home to an unusual plant called rush, which lines the banks of the stream. Along the trails, oak, elm, sycamore and black walnut trees provide habitat for a variety of birds and other wildlife. A grove of white pine, planted by Girl Scouts in the late 1960s, offers visitors a cool, scented respite. Today, at the Top O' the World Area, open fields contain milkwort, ironweed, Queen Anne's lace, goldenrods and asters. Bluebird boxes, which are monitored by volunteers, rise above the meadow grasses. Each summer, bluebirds sit perched atop the nest boxes, watching for their insect prey. Other notable bird species include woodcocks, wild turkeys and large birds of prey like red- tailed hawks. The hawks can be seen soaring above the meadows as they hunt for small voles and mice. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Adam Run 3.2 miles, Spring Hollow Trail 1.6 miles), Picnicking, Soccer *Liberty in Twinsburg Long before Liberty Park was formed, humans in prehistory camped here, drank the clean, cold springs and hunted game. Upon European settlement, trees were cleared for farming, but maples were spared for their sweet sap. Today, the 1,759-acre Liberty Park is a unique partnership between the City of Twinsburg and the park district. The city manages the park's 100-acre recreation area, including the play fields and playground. Metro Parks manages the remaining acreage, including two trails and the Pond Brook Conservation Area. Both areas are open 6 am to sunset. Large trees exist on rock ledges and in wetlands within the conservation area, where fens and bogs are \\"protected\\" by poison sumac and swamp rose. Metro Parks has designated this a Low Impact Area, meaning mowing, trails and other park improvements will be kept to a minimum. This protects the various species that live in the area's wetlands and vernal pools. Liberty Park harbors countless rare and endangered species, including Indiana bats, marsh wrens, ospreys and bald eagles. Other creatures seen here include beavers, long-tailed weasels, dragonflies, butterflies, red-backed salamanders, wood frogs and turtles. In July 2006, Audubon Ohio named Liberty Park an Important Bird Area. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Buttonbush Trail 1.6 miles, Sugarbush Trail 0.6 miles), Baseball/Softball, Picnicking, Play Equipment *Munroe Falls in Munroe Falls Before Metro Parks purchased 222 acres from the Renner family in 1978, John Renner owned and operated a swimming park here. In the 1930s, the family built a two-room summer cabin and dug a small fishing lake near the present park entrance. By 1935 they constructed a house and lived here year-round, and they soon realized their lake was popular with swimmers. To discourage visitors, they started charging 10 cents per visit, but this only attracted more people. To accommodate the new business, they created the current 13-acre lake in 1937 and named the place Renner Park. John Renner, an engineer who built many homes in Akron's Goodyear Heights area, also tried raising pigs on the southeast side of the lake. Price restrictions enacted during World War II made his farming venture unprofitable. In 2007, Metro Parks acquired the adjacent 287-acre former County Home property, bringing this park to its current 509 acres. Today, the sandy, acidic soils of Munroe Falls Metro Park permit the growth of flora that is typically uncommon in Summit County. Blueberries, shiny club moss, ground pine and a colony of Ohio haircap moss flourish here. Trees include black gum, sassafras and tulip. Beavers, frogs, turtles, salamanders and crayfish are seen in both Beaver and Heron ponds. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Indian Spring Trail 2.2 miles), Basketball, Boat Rental, Cross-country Skiing, Fishing, Picnicking, Play Equipment, Sledding, Swimming, Tennis, Volleyball *F.A. Seiberling Nature Realm in Akron Many parks exist due to the foresight of a few visionary individuals, including F.A. Seiberling. He donated more than 400 acres to expand Sand Run Metro Park. Land that he owned from 1920 to 1948 was purchased by Metro Parks in 1964 to become the Nature Realm. Native son Seiberling founded Goodyear Tire & Rubber in 1898. The company produced bicycle and carriage tires and went on to capture the automobile tire business. Seiberling's interests went well beyond tires. He helped form the original Akron Metropolitan Park District and was a member of the Board of Park Commissioners from 1924 to 1935. Today, the Nature Realm is a special-use area that has been set aside for the study and enjoyment of nature. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Cherry Lane Trail 0.6 miles, Fernwood Trail 0.5 miles, Seneca Trail 1.4 miles), Picnicking *O'Neil Woods in Bath William O'Neil, founder of General Tire and Rubber Company, and his wife Grace donated their 242-acre family farm to Metro Parks in 1972. Their son, M. Gerald O'Neil, served on the Board of Park Commissioners from 1969 to 1978. The O'Neil family had cattle and horses, and their old barn still stands; the structure is an ideal bat \\"condo.\\" Other winged creatures in O'Neil Woods include eastern bluebirds, which nest in boxes maintained by staff and volunteers throughout the park. Eastern woodcocks, barred owls, pileated woodpeckers, song sparrows, kingfishers and ruffed grouse have been spotted among the park's oak, black willow, eastern cottonwood, sycamore and black walnut trees. Ferns and wildflowers carpet the ground. Yellow Creek, the cleanest tributary to the Cuyahoga River, harbors turtles, frogs and a variety of fish. Biologists believe this creek's fish will eventually re-colonize the polluted river as cleanup efforts continue. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Buckeye Trail, Deer Run Trail 1.8 miles), Picnicking *Sand Run in Akron The 1000-acre Sand Run Metro Park opened in 1929, but the area has been welcoming visitors for centuries. The land surrounding Mingo Pavilion was a campsite for Mingo Indians. Portage Path was once an important Native American trail between the Cuyahoga and Tuscarawas rivers; later, it was the western boundary of the United States. A high ridge above the Wadsworth Area was a lookout point for General Elijah Wadsworth, who made his camp near the present-day Old Portage Area during the War of 1812. In the 1930s, Sand Run Parkway and many of the surrounding shelters and structures were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps. In 1974, the park district's Administrative Offices were moved here from Goodyear Heights Metro Park. Today, visitors can drive through the ford crossing where Sand Run meanders across Sand Run Parkway. In the cool, shady ravines of Sand Run and its tributary streams, hemlocks, ferns, skunk cabbage and large colonies of horsetails grow. Each spring, large-flowered trilliums and other seasonal blooms appear, including bishop's cap, foam flower, bloodroot and pale violet. The towering forest is home to red, gray, black and fox squirrels; screech, barred and great horned owls; and pileated woodpeckers. Red-tailed hawks roost in the treetops when they are not soaring over the ridges. Many rare species inhabit the park, including sharp-shinned hawks, butternut trees, and native orchids. Near the intersection of Sand Run Parkway and Merriman Road is a small wetland that has become a highly productive amphibian breeding area. Every spring, the parkway is closed on nights when spotted salamanders migrate to this area for mating. The phenomenon has become a popular attraction for robust nature enthusiasts who often stand in the rain to witness hundreds of salamanders crossing the road. Other amphibians that breed in this area include spring peepers, wood frogs, American toads and green frogs. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Buckeye Trail, Dogwood Trail 1.8 miles, Jogging Trail 6.0 miles, Mingo Trail 3.3 miles, Parcours Trail 1.4 miles, Valley Link Trail 2.8 miles), Ice Skating, Picnicking, Sledding, Soccer *Silver Creek in Norton The 624-acre Silver Creek Metro Park is tucked away in a quiet, rural area near Norton. Observant visitors will see traces of the past. Open fields, fence rows and a stately old barn, part of which dates back to the Civil War, are evidence of the park's former life as the Harter Dairy Farm. Other secrets are less visible. Buried beneath the surface is a maze of tunnels and shafts ‚Äì remnants of a 19th-century mining operation. The one-time farm has changed a great deal since Metro Parks acquired the land in 1966. Thousands of trees have been planted, and the bathhouse and 50-acre lake ‚Äì fed by a spring from an old mine near Wall Road ‚Äì were built in the early 1990s. Today, iron-laden water from the mine shafts feed into Silver Creek, coating the bottom of the stream with reddish-brown iron-oxide, yet fish, frogs and other animals thrive. The open fields are home to woodcocks, meadowlarks and eastern bluebirds. Many butterflies flutter among the flowers and grasses. Hawks circle overhead to hunt rabbits, mice and voles living in the grasses and weeds below. Deer travel among the woods, fields and wetlands. Tall sycamores grow in soggy areas, and hickory woods grow in drier spots. The beech-maple woods contain spring wildflowers. One of the largest northern red oaks in Summit County ‚Äì 20 feet in circumference ‚Äì stands in this park. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Bridle Trail 7.9 miles, Chippewa Trail 2.0 miles, Pheasant Run Trail 1.2 miles), Boat Rental, Cross-country Skiing, Fishing, Picnicking, Play Equipment, Swimming *Springfield Bog in Springfield Township This much- anticipated Metro Park, is the first in southeast Summit County, and is now open. The trail is marked and the parking lot is completed. However, there are no restrooms, and more changes will be coming in the next few years during this \\"Watch Us Grow\\" phase. In the future, the restored prairie will attract butterflies and birds like bobolinks, meadowlarks and rails ‚Äì all grassland nesting species. ACTIVITIES: Hiking (Prairie Trail) *Tallmadge Meadows in Tallmadge, Ohio, Summit County This Metro Park was recently built off of 91. There are two trails, Meadow Loop and Meadow Trail. Meadow Loop is an easy .35 miles of flat land. Meadow Trail is right next to the parking lot and is 2.0 miles through the woods and passes the County Home cemetery.http://events.ohio.com/tallmadge_oh/venues/show/6016825-munroe-falls- metro-park-tallmadge-meadows ACTIVITIES: Hiking =Other= *Bike & Hike Trail, a completely paved multipurpose trail, one of the first \\"rails to trails\\" conversions in the countyBike & Hike Trail with trailheads in Sagamore Hills, Northfield Center, Boston Heights, Stow, Munroe Falls, and Hudson The 33.5-mile Bike & Hike Trail was one of the first \\"rails to trails\\" conversions in the country. It follows the course of the old Akron, Bedford & Cleveland (ABC) Railroad, which was the longest electric railroad of its kind when it was built in 1895. Until service was discontinued in 1932, riders could travel for 50 cents from Akron to Cleveland's Public Square in about 2.5 hours. Today, east of Route 91 in Munroe Falls, the Bike & Hike Trail parallels a scenic section of the Cuyahoga River where great blue herons, Canada geese and a variety of ducks can be seen. A small pond along the north side of the trail annually hosts a chorus of spring peepers. South of Boston Mills Road in Boston Heights, the Sharon Conglomerate rock walls of the Boston Ledges rise along the trail. Farther north, the trail travels along Brandywine Road. A parking area adjacent to the bridge over I-271 offers rest and a view of Brandywine Falls which, at 75 feet, is one of the highest waterfalls in Ohio. ACTIVITIES: Biking, Cross-country Skiing, Hiking, Picnicking, Rollerblading *Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail, a multipurpose trail that follows the abandoned Ohio and Erie Canal, with trailheads in Akron, Barberton, New Franklin, and Clinton The Ohio & Erie Canal was a technological marvel. The inland waterway incorporated a series of sandstone locks that enabled boats to climb differences in elevation along the Continental Divide. The steepest section of the canal was between Akron and the Little Cuyahoga River. In a single mile, 15 locks, or \\"steps,\\" were necessary. Canal boats, which were pulled by mules on the towpath, made it possible to ship goods from the Great Lakes (Lake Erie) to the Gulf of Mexico (via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers). Locally, the canal, which opened between Cleveland and Akron in 1827, can be directly credited with the growth of Akron. The city's population swelled thanks to the bustling activity surrounding the tight bundle of canal locks. By 1878 the canal's significance was in decline due to the introduction of railroads. After the Great Flood of 1913 the canal was abandoned ‚Äì less than 100 years after it opened. For many years the canal was largely forgotten about or ignored. The concept of restoring the towpath for use as a multipurpose trail began to emerge in the 1980s, and the first section of the Towpath Trail opened in 1993. Almost overnight, visitation doubled in Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Restoration of the towpath quickly spread to municipalities and neighboring park districts, including Metro Parks, Serving Summit County. Akron Area (Botzum to the Innerbelt/SR-59): Along this 9.28-mile stretch the Cuyahoga and Little Cuyahoga rivers provide habitat for a variety of aquatic wildlife. Birds include herons, geese, ducks and kingfishers. Frogs and salamanders mate and lay eggs in the pools that collect in the flood plains. Water-loving native and non-native trees and shrubs dominate the area. Native species include cottonwood, sycamore, elm and silver maple; their chewed stumps signal beaver activity. Wildflowers abound along the sunny, shrub-less sections of the trail. Barberton Area (Waterloo Road to Snyder Avenue): Plants that thrive in disrupted soils dominate along this 5.11-mile stretch; they include both native and invasive species. Shrubs include sumac, blackberry and the invasive Japanese knotweed while trees include boxelder, black locust and the invasive tree-of-heaven. Summer and fall wildflowers include Queen Anne's lace, yarrow, teasel, evening primrose and common mullein. The Tuscarawas River and the water-filled canal provide habitat for a variety of aquatic wildlife. Beavers, muskrats, painted and musk turtles, and several types of frogs may be observed along the canal. Kingfishers and great blue herons may be seen stalking fish. PPG Industries (Eastern Road to Center Road): This 4.54-mile section is built on land leased from PPG Industries. From 1899 until 1973, liquid and solid waste products from the company's chemical plant ‚Äì mostly lime and water slurry with some sand and salts ‚Äì were pumped into six settling ponds here called Lime Lakes, covering a total of more than 600 acres. Water was drained from the Lime Lakes, leaving behind fine-grained lime deposits up to 50 feet deep. The resulting flat, barren landscapes were too alkaline and nutrient-poor for plants to grow. In the early 1980s PPG began restoring the local environment, amending the lime deposits with nutrient-rich bio-solids, or sludge, from municipal wastewater treatment plants, a practice often used in farming. Next, vegetation was planted in the artificial soil to reduce the amount of rain that filtered through. The result: Wildlife, including painted turtles, ring- necked pheasants and white tailed deer, has returned to the reclaimed Lime Lakes. Clinton Area (Center Road to the Stark County line): Along this 2.6-mile section the rich, often-saturated soil of the river floodplain supports an abundance of wildflowers from spring to fall, luring a variety of insects including many butterflies. A number of tree species can be found along the trail, especially those which thrive in wet areas, including hackberry, elm, silver maple and swamp white oak. ACTIVITIES: Biking, Camping, Cross-country Skiing, Fishing, Hiking, Picnicking Conservation Areas In addition to 13 developed parks and more than 120 miles of trails, Metro Parks manages several conservation areas for the purpose of preserving Summit County's natural resources. While these conservation areas are not officially open to the public, most are accessible via neighboring trails. *Columbia Run Conservation Area Surrounded by Cuyahoga Valley National Park, this 366-acre conservation area is characterized by steep ravines and nearly- mature forests. Columbia Run flows through the area and supports several communities of coldwater fish, including southern redbelly dace, a rare minnow. Rare birds have been observed here as well, including cerulean warblers, an Ohio species of concern. This area is accessible via the statewide Buckeye Trail. *Kniss Conservation Area The smallest of our named conservation areas, the 73-acre Kniss Conservation Area was donated by the Nature Conservancy in 1974. It is adjacent to Bath Nature Preserve, which is managed by the Bath Township Park System. At one time, these woods were considered one of the best local examples of a beech-maple forest ecosystem. *Riding Run Conservation Area This 705-acre conservation area includes fields and forests that support rare plants. One such species is the butternut tree, which is being attacked by a fungus throughout its range. Black-throated green warblers have been observed here, and Furnace Run ‚Äì one of the cleanest tributaries to the Cuyahoga River ‚Äì flows through parts of this area. Portions of Riding Run are leased for sweet corn production and continue a long tradition of agriculture in the valley. Corn can be seen growing off Everett Road and will eventually find its way to Szalay's Farm, a regional attraction for many people traveling through Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The conservation area is accessible via neighboring bridle trails. *Waldo Semon Conservation Area This 122-acre conservation area was donated in 1974 by Waldo Semon, an employee of Akron's B.F. Goodrich Company who invented a way to make PVC (vinyl) useful. The woods are accessible via trails maintained by Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The Stanford Trail has a short spur that takes visitors to Averill Pond, home to beavers, herons and many amphibian species. Several rare plant species grow here, including satin brome and wild rice. *Wetmore Conservation Area In 1974, the National Park Service acquired thousands of acres that were managed by Metro Parks, including Virginia Kendall Park. Despite this acquisition, Metro Parks retained 572 wooded acres ‚Äì today's Wetmore Conservation Area. It includes great forests, steep ravines and high- quality stream corridors. The land is accessible via bridle trails maintained by Cuyahoga Valley National Park.

A woman bound to a X Cross. The X-cross, X-frame or saltire cross is a common piece of equipment in BDSM dungeons. It typically provides restraining points for ankles, wrists, and waist. When secured to a saltire, the subject is restrained in a spreadeagle position. Saltires are versatile and easy to manufacture. They are usually firmly attached to a wall, and is distinguished from a BDSM-style Catherine Wheel, which has a central hinge and allows occupants to be turned upside down. The submissive may be attached to the cross with either the back or front facing the cross. Being restrained facing the cross is the position often used for whipping. Being attached with one's back to the cross is usually more of a sexual bondage position or used for sexual teasing. The Cross may be purchased from BDSM companies, but many users make their own. Freestanding saltires have a frame which supports the cross. Some homemade freestanding crosses have a tendency to be unstable; a writhing subject can sometimes tip them over, so great caution needs to be exercised in their use. Some freestanding crosses include footrests that greatly improve safety and stability.  Literature  * Jay Wiseman: SM 101: A Realistic Introduction.

Following Brabham's retirement as a driver at the end of the 1970 season, Tauranac owned and managed the Brabham team until 1972, when he sold it to Bernie Ecclestone. He remained in England to assist with a redesign of a Politoys Formula One chassis for Frank Williams in 1973 and helped Trojan develop a Formula One version of their Formula 5000 car. After a brief retirement in Australia, Tauranac returned to England to establish the Ralt marque (a name he and his brother Austin had used for some 'specials' in Australia in the 1950s, winning the NSW Hillclimb Championship in 1954 with the Ralt 500). The first \\"modern\\" Ralt was the Ralt RT1 chassis, to be raced in Formula Three, Formula Two and Formula Atlantic. The chassis proved successful, winning the European Formula Three championship in 1975 in the hands of Australian driver Larry Perkins. The 1978 season also proved successful for the RT1 chassis, winning the European F3 championship for Jan Lammers. Tauranac designed the Theodore Racing F1 car for the 1978 season. Two new designs were created for the 1979 season: the RT2 for Formula Two and the RT3 for Formula Three. The RT3 chassis won the 1983 European F3 championship for Pierluigi Martini and five consecutive British F3 titles. A joint venture with Honda resulted in the RH6 chassis, which won the 1981, 1984 and 1985 titles. In October 1988, Tauranac sold the Ralt business to March Engineering for ¬£1.25 million. Tauranac remained involved with various aspects of the sport since departing from Ralt, including racing-school cars for Honda, a Formula Renault car, consulting work for the Arrows Formula One team, and continued relationships with Honda. Tauranac was the design judge at the Formula SAE Australasia competition in Melbourne, Australia. In the 2002 Australia Day Honours, Tauranac was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia for \\"service to motor racing, particularly through the engineering design, construction and production of Formula 1 racing cars, providing young drivers with opportunities to compete at top levels, and sharing knowledge with others for the advancement of the sport\\".

Invented in 1991 by Rick Trebino and Daniel J. Kane, FROG was the first technique to solve this problem, which is difficult because, ordinarily, to measure an event in time, a shorter event is required with which to measure it. For example, to measure a soap bubble popping requires a strobe light with a shorter duration to freeze the action. Because ultrashort laser pulses are the shortest events ever created, before FROG, it was thought by many that their complete measurement in time was not possible. FROG, however, solved the problem by measuring an \\"auto-spectrogram\\" of the pulse, in which the pulse gates itself in a nonlinear-optical medium and the resulting gated piece of the pulse is then spectrally resolved as a function of the delay between the two pulses. Retrieval of the pulse from its FROG trace is accomplished by using a two-dimensional phase-retrieval algorithm. FROG is currently the standard technique for measuring ultrashort laser pulses, and also popular, replacing an older method called autocorrelation, which only gave a rough estimate for the pulse length. FROG is simply a spectrally resolved autocorrelation, which allows the use of a phase-retrieval algorithm to retrieve the precise pulse intensity and phase vs. time. It can measure both very simple and very complex ultrashort laser pulses, and it has measured the most complex pulse ever measured without the use of a reference pulse. Simple versions of FROG exist (with the acronym, GRENOUILLE, the French word for FROG), utilizing only a few easily aligned optical components. Both FROG and GRENOUILLE are in common use in research and industrial labs around the world. Theory thumbright300pxA schematic of a typical experimental, multishot SHG FROG setup. FROG and autocorrelation share the idea of combining a pulse with itself in a nonlinear medium. Since a nonlinear medium will only produce the desired signal when both pulses are present at the same time (i.e. ‚Äúoptical gating‚Äù), varying the delay between the pulse copies and measuring the signal at each delay gives a vague estimate of the pulse length. Autocorrelators measure a pulse by measuring the intensity of the nonlinear signal field. Estimating the pulse length requires assuming a pulse shape, and the phase of the pulse electric field cannot be measured at all. FROG extends this idea by measuring the spectrum of the signal at each delay (hence ‚Äúfrequency-resolved‚Äù), instead of just the intensity. This measurement creates a spectrogram of the pulse, which can be used to determine the complex electric field as a function of time or frequency as long as the nonlinearity of the medium is known. The FROG spectrogram (usually called a FROG trace) is a graph of intensity as a function of frequency omega and delay tau. The signal field from the nonlinear interaction is easier to express in the time domain, however, so the typical expression for the FROG trace includes a Fourier transform. : I_text{FROG}(omega,tau) = left E_text{sig}(omega,tau) right^2 = left FT[ E_text{sig}(t,tau)] right^2 = left int_{-infty}^infty E_{sig}(t,tau) e^{-i omega t} ,dt right^2. The nonlinear signal field E_text{sig}(t,tau) depends on the original pulse, E(t), and the nonlinear process used, which can almost always be expressed as E_text{gate}(t - tau), such that E_text{sig}(t,tau) = E(t)E_text{gate}(t - tau). The most common nonlinearity is second harmonic generation, where E_text{gate}(t - tau) = E(t - tau). The expression for the trace in terms of the pulse field is then: :I_text{SHG FROG}(omega,tau) = left int_{-infty}^infty E(t) E(t - tau) e^{-i omega t} ,dt right^2. There are many possible variations on this basic setup. If a well- known reference pulse is available, then it may be used as a gating pulse instead of a copy of the unknown pulse. This is referred to as cross- correlation FROG or XFROG. In addition, other non-linear effects besides second harmonic generation may be used, such as third harmonic generation (THG) or polarization gating (PG). These changes will affect the expression for E_text{gate}(t - tau). Experiment In a typical multi-shot FROG setup, the unknown pulse is split into two copies with a beamsplitter. One copy is delayed by a known amount relative to the other. Both pulses are focused to the same point in a nonlinear medium, and the spectrum of the nonlinear signal is measured with a spectrometer. This process is repeated for many delay points. A FROG measurement can be performed on a single shot with some minor adjustments. The two pulse copies are crossed at an angle and focused to a line instead of a point. This creates a varying delay between the two pulses along the line focus. In this configuration, it is common to use a home-made spectrometer, consisting of a diffraction grating and a camera, to capture the measurement. Retrieval algorithm Although it is theoretically somewhat complex, the method of generalized projections has proven to be an extremely reliable method for retrieving pulses from FROG traces. Unfortunately, its sophistication is the source of some misunderstanding and mistrust from scientists in the optics community. Hence, this section will attempt to give some insight into the basic philosophy and implementation of the method, if not its detailed workings. First, imagine a space that contains all possible signal electric fields. For a given measurement, there is a set of these fields that will satisfy the measured FROG trace. We refer to these fields as satisfying the data constraint. There is another set that consists of the signal fields that can be expressed using the form for the nonlinear interaction used in the measurement. For second-harmonic generation (SHG), this is the set of fields that can be expressed in the form E_text{sig}(t,tau) = E(t) E(t - tau). This is referred to as satisfying the mathematical form constraint. These two sets intersect at exactly one point. There is only one possible signal field that both has the correct intensity to match the data trace and fits the mathematical form dictated by the nonlinear interaction. To find that point, which will give the pulse we are trying to measure, generalized projections is used. The generalized projections algorithm operates in this electric field space. At each step, we find the closest point to the current guess point that will satisfy the constraint for the other set. That is, the current guess is ‚Äúprojected‚Äù onto the other set. This closest point becomes the new current guess, and the closest point on the first set is found. By alternating between projecting onto the mathematical constraint set and projecting onto the data constraint set, we eventually end up at the solution. Projecting onto the data constraint set is simple. To be in that set, the magnitude squared of the signal field has to match the intensity measured by the trace. The signal field E_text{sig}(t,tau) is Fourier-transformed to E_text{sig}(omega,tau). The closest point in the data constraint set is found by replacing the magnitude of E_text{sig}(omega,tau) by the magnitude of the data, leaving the phase of E_text{sig}(omega,tau) intact. Projecting onto the mathematical constraint set is not simple. Unlike the data constraint, there is not an easy way to tell which point in the mathematical constraint set is closest. A general expression for the distance between the current point and any point in the mathematical constraint set is created, and then that expression is minimized by taking the gradient of that distance with respect the current field guess. This process is discussed in more detail in this paper. This cycle is repeated until the error between the signal guess and the data constraint (after applying the mathematical constraint) reaches some target minimum value. E(t) can be found by simply integrating E_text{sig}(t,tau) with respect to delay tau. A second FROG trace is usually constructed mathematically from the solution and compared with the original measurement. Measurement confirmation One important feature of a FROG measurement is that many more data points are collected than are strictly necessary to find the pulse electric field. For example, say that the measured trace consists of 128 points in the delay direction and 128 points in the frequency direction. There are 128√ó128 total points in the trace. Using these points, an electric field is retrieved that has 2√ó128 points (128 for magnitude and another 128 for the phase). This is a massively overdetermined system, meaning that the number of equations is much larger than the number of unknowns. Thus the importance of each individual data point being absolutely correct is greatly reduced. This is very helpful for real-world measurements that can be affected by detector noise and systematic errors. Noise is extremely unlikely to affect the measured trace in a way that could be confused with a physical phenomenon in the pulse. The FROG algorithm tends to ‚Äúsee through‚Äù these effects due to the amount of extra information available and the use of a mathematical form constraint in finding a solution. This means that the error between an experimental FROG trace and a retrieved FROG trace is rarely zero, although it should be quite small for traces without systematic errors. Consequently, significant differences between measured and retrieved FROG traces should be investigated. The experimental setup may be misaligned, or there may be significant spatio-temporal distortions in the pulse. If the measurement averages over several or many pulses, then those pulses may vary significantly from each other.

From 1944 to 1947 Dunning created many original short films and developed his skills animating articulated, painted, metal cut-outs. In 1948, he spent a year working for UNESCO in Paris under the mentorship of Czech-born animator Berthold Bartosch. Then in 1949, he and fellow NFB grad Jim McKay created one of Toronto's first animation studios, Graphic Associates, where he produced commercials and gave Michael Snow his first job in film. Dunning later moved on to New York City working on UPA's The Gerald McBoing-Boing Show and in 1956 he moved to England to manage UPA's new London office. After the office went under, he hired many of the UPA staff to work for him and his newly established production company, T.V. Cartoons Ltd. (renamed TVC London). Among the animators working for TVC were Richard Williams and Jimmy Murakami. By 1961, TVC was producing about one hundred commercials a year. During this time Dunning also managed to make many personal short films noted for their surrealistic atmosphere and Kafkaesque themes. The Flying Man earned him the Annecy Cristal Grand Prix in 1962 while The Apple won the 1963 BAFTA Award (UK equivalent of an Oscar). Dunning also oversaw the cartoon series The Beatles for ABC, and this led to his involvement with Yellow Submarine (1968). Dunning was also responsible for the opening credits of Blake Edwards' A Shot in the Dark, along with a series of shorts and inserts including \\"the digger\\", for the BBC's Vision On series for children.

It is a hardy vine with some bunch-rot disease resistance. In warmer climates it should be picked at lower sugars to avoid overripe, sometimes labrusca-like, flavors; however this has not been observed in cooler climates such as the Finger Lakes and Pacific Northwest, where desirable, Riesling-type flavors are tasted in fully ripe Cayuga fruit. Picked at the proper time, it can produce a very nice sparkling wine with good acid balance, structure, and pleasant aromas, or a fruity white wine similar to a Riesling or Viognier. One advantage of Cayuga is that, if harvested unripe (e.g., in a shorter summer in cool climates), it can still make a good wine, albeit one with more green apple flavors in that case. This grape, when grown on mature vines in fertile soil, can produce astonishing yields. If allowed to set fully on thirty-year-old vines in Aurora, Oregon, Cayuga's yield has been measured at over 13 tons per acre, though in that case a \\"green harvest\\" (removing much of the fruit before the final phase of the ripening cycle) is advised, so that the vine can more fully ripen the remaining fruit. Cayuga is relatively easy to make wine from. In cooler climates, it retains enough acid that a residual sugar level is advised, in order to achieve balance in the palate. Cayuga is grown in small regions in Ohio. In one informal survey of grape breeders who grow hybrid grapes and make wine from them, Cayuga was the most-popular answer to the question \\"Which hybrid grape is the easiest to grow and make good wine from?\\" It can also be seen in the vineyards in Rhode Island, such as Greenvale, a similar climate to the Finger Lakes for wine grape growing.

It is in Avebury, near Marlborough, Wiltshire, England, in the centre of the village next to St James's Church and close to the Avebury neolithic henge monument. History The manor house was built on or near the site of a Benedictine cell or priory of St Georges de Boscherville, founded in 1114. Subsequently the site passed into the ownership of Fotheringhay College in 1411. Fragments of the religious foundation were incorporated into the later house. William Sharington bought and surveyed the manor in 1548, suggesting alterations to the existing building. The earliest parts of the present house were probably built after William Dunch of Little Wittenham in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) purchased the estate in 1551. It was some way from most of his lands which centred on Wittenham, but he appears to have purchased it because of an interest in ancient monuments such as the Avebury stone circles. Around that time, a stone dovecote was erected in the grounds. In the 1580s, Dunch passed it on to his younger son, Walter, whose daughter, Deborah, Lady Moody, grew up at the manor before emigrating to America and founding Gravesend in Brooklyn in 1645. Walter Dunch's widow, Deborah, subsequently married Sir James Mervyn (who served as High Sheriff of Wiltshire in 1596), and the couple were responsible for a major extension or remodelling of the house around 1601. In 1640 the Dunch family sold it to John Stawell, and the estate was sequestered when he was accused of treason in 1646. It was sold to George Long in 1652 but restored to Stawell in 1660 on his release from the Tower of London. = 20th century = The house has had many extensions and changes over the centuries, including the addition of a racquets court in the 18th century, the final addition being the West Library which was added by the family of Leopold C. D. Jenner who occupied the house in the early 20th century and completely redesigned the gardens. The house was leased and restored by Alexander Keiller, heir to the James Keiller & Son marmalade business, who took an intense interest in Avebury henge in the late 1930s. In 1955 the rate of destruction of country houses had reached its peak, at one house every five days. The fate of Avebury Manor was in serious doubt when Keiller, whose excavations of the henge had been ended by the outbreak of war in 1939, put it up for sale. Few at the time were interested in the national heritage and the prospects for the manor were bleak. At this point Sir Francis Knowles stepped in and purchased Avebury Manor from Keiller. The Times described Knowles as \\"a fundamental scientist of outstanding calibre\\". Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society Vol 21, 1975, E. J. W. Barrington FRS He immediately set about the restoration of the house which became an absorbing love as he learnt much about its construction, and claimed to have uncovered the signs of Gothic arches in the north east corner which had been filled in during Elizabethan times. The family lived partly in cottages on the estate and partly in the house over the following three years, as the works progressed with substantial financial help from the Ministry of Works. In May 1956, the house was amongst the first of the smaller houses to be opened to the public. In 1958 it was designated Grade 1. In 1948 Knowles had married Ruth Jessie Brooke-Smith, the daughter of the Rev Arther Brooke-Smith. They brought up a large family at the manor: one son, Charles Francis (b. 1951) who later succeeded to the baronetcy, and three daughters, as well as a stepdaughter born to Ruth and her first husband, Dickie Hulse, an RAF fighter pilot killed in action during the Second World War. The Knowles children recall it as a magical place in which to grow up, with acres of space to roam. They helped in all aspects of the early years of rather amateurish historic house tourism: using a surplus World War II field telephone between the tour guide (often an au pair with a vivid imagination) and the ticket office, serving teas, and helping themselves to coins from the wishing well to buy ice-creams from Sumbler's, the butchers just outside the gates. \\"Many would remember Francis as a most excellent host. Particularly memorable, however, was his hospitality at his beautiful Elizabethan house at Avebury, where he and his wife, Ruth, entertained so many people\\".\\" R. L. Holmes - J. Anat. (1975), 119, 2, pp. 385‚Äì387. Set against this background, remote from academic biology, he appeared to one of his colleagues as 'a fascinating man who would really have been more at home in the eighteenth century'. To another he gave proof that 'one could be both a distinguished scholar and a warm, vibrant person'. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography - E. J. W. Barrington FRS By 1974 the rate of destruction of the country house had come to a near standstill. This was due not just to stricter application of legislation, but also the high-profile Destruction of the Country House exhibition held in 1974 by the Victoria and Albert Museum. Having preserved the house for future generations, Knowles died suddenly that year in London on 13 July 1974 at the age of 59. He is buried in the churchyard of St. James Avebury, next to the house which he had lovingly restored to ensure its survival. Two years later, in 1977, the manor was sold to Michael Brudenell-Bruce, 8th Marquess of Ailesbury, whose father, Cedric, by coincidence had died only days after his friend Sir Francis Knowles. Visitor attraction The manor house is no longer privately occupied but is owned by the National Trust charity and is open to the general public. The garden was completely redesigned in the early 20th century. The topiary and other formal gardens are contained within walls and clipped box, creating numerous \\"rooms\\". In 2011, Avebury Manor was the subject of the BBC One television series The Manor Reborn, in which the house was refurbished by a group of experts in collaboration with the National Trust. , visitors are encouraged to touch and experience the furnishings and objects in the rooms which now represent periods in the house from the 16th century to the early 20th century. The house is reputedly haunted.

Morrissey, Four Courts Press, 2007, pg 1 O'Brien moved with his family to Dublin in 1897, and quickly became involved in the Irish Socialist Republican Party (ISRP). O'Brien is described as \\"a very significant figure in the ISRP\\" by the historian of the ISRP, David Lynch. He was a member of the Socialist Party of Ireland, serving on its executive.Barberis et al, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p.207-208, 251 A close friend and associate of James Connolly, O'Brien helped establish the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union in 1909, and was instrumental in the Dublin Lock-out strike in 1913. A member of the Irish Neutrality League, and Anti-Conscription Committee, during the World War I, O'Brien was interned on several occasions by the Dublin Castle government. During one of these instances, he stood in the 1920 Stockport by- election, but was refused a release to campaign in it. With the formation of the Irish Free State, O'Brien was elected as Teachta D√°la (TD) for Dublin South at the 1922 general election, and again for Tipperary in June 1927 and again in 1937. An important figure in the Labour Party in Ireland in its formative days, O'Brien resisted James Larkin's attempt to regain control of the Party on release from prison. Taking Larkin to court over his occupation of ITGWU headquarters, the Larkin-O'Brien feud resulted in a split within the labour and trade union movements, and the formation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Ideologically, O'Brien was a Reformist and Democratic Socialist, believing that Irish socialists should bring about socialism via the ballot box, not through violence or direct action. Despite his Easter Rising links, he consistently avoided endorsing militancy as a tool of the labour movement in Ireland. This viewpoint contrasted strongly to the beliefs of Jim Larkin and was partially why the two could not agree to co-operate. Only once did O'Brien seriously consider militancy; during the dawn of the Irish Civil War and fearing the worst, O'Brien and other Labour leaders turned towards the Irish Citizen Army, proposing the concept of a \\"Workers' Army\\", of which the ICA would form the nucleus. However, this idea was rebuffed. O'Brien was once asked if was disappointed that the Irish electorate hadn't used their new parliamentary democracy to push for a stronger socialist presence, O'Brien reaffirmed his view by stating: In 1930, O'Brien sought to have Leon Trotsky granted asylum in Ireland, but the head of the Free State government, W. T. Cosgrave, refused to allow it. Active in politics and the trade union movement into his 60s, O'Brien retired in 1946 and died on 31 October 1968.

Early life Crocker was born on 19 January 1861 in Sacramento, California. He attended Phillips Academy, Andover and Yale University, where he was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter). After the 1906 earthquake and fire had left the Crocker mansions in ruins, in 1907 he donated the Crocker family's Nob Hill block for Grace Cathedral. Career He was a member of the University of California Board of Regents for nearly thirty years and funded the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory's million-volt x-ray tube at the UC hospital and the \\"medical\\" Crocker cyclotron used for neutron therapy at Berkeley.J. L. Heilbron and Robert W. Seidel, Lawrence and His Laboratory (Berkeley: University of California, 1989) Crocker also chaired the Panama-Pacific Exposition Committee and SE Community Chest, and was a key member of the committee that built the San Francisco Opera House and Veterans Building. Crocker was the founder of Crocker Middle School located in Hillsborough, California. When much of the city of San Francisco was destroyed by the fire from the 1906 earthquake, William Crocker and his bank were major forces in financing reconstruction. His father, Charles Crocker (1822-1888), had been a builder of the Central Pacific Railroad. Crocker's wife Ethel (n√©e Sperry) was the leading patron of French Impressionist art in California at that time. In the 1890s, Crocker's wife, and California Impressionist Lucy Bacon, who studied in France under Pissarro, lent William Kingston Vickery, owner of the San Francisco art gallery Vickery, Atkins & Torrey, a number of French Impressionist paintings. Vickery then supervised a series of these loan exhibitions in San Francisco and introduced Impressionism to California in the form of paintings by Monet, Eug√®ne Boudin, Paul C√©zanne, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas. Mrs. Crocker also sponsored the studies of the Zoellner Quartet with C√©sar Thomson in Belgium. After six years in Europe, the quartet returned to the United States, and became a tireless force promoting classical music outside established centers and in Southern California.Cariaga, Daniel, \\"Not Taking It with You: A Tale of Two Estates\\", Los Angeles Times, December 22, 1985, accessed April 2012. In 1936, Crocker contributed $75,000 toward the building of a laboratory for Ernest O. Lawrence at the University of California, Berkeley, which was subsequently named \\"Crocker Radiation Laboratory\\" in his honor. This laboratory became home to the Berkeley 60\\" cyclotron. In the 1960s, parts of this cyclotron were moved to the University of California, Davis, where they served as the basis for the Crocker Nuclear Laboratory, which inherited its name from the original.

Personal life William and Ethel Crocker had four children: Charles, William Willard, Helen (Russell), and Ethel Mary (de Limur). Death and legacy William Crocker died on 25 September 1937 at his home in Hillsborough, California. His uncle's home in Sacramento, California, was converted into the Crocker Art Museum and was the first art museum to open in the West. His nephew, Harry Crocker, was a movie star in the 1920s and, at one time, the personal assistant of Charlie Chaplin. His cousin, Aimee Crocker, was a Bohemian mystic who garnered publicity for her extravagant parties in New York, San Francisco and Paris, for her five husbands and many lovers, for her tattoos, and for living 10 years in the Far East, not as a tourist, but as if a native. His grandson, also named William, is a retired anthropologist who worked at the Smithsonian Institution specializing in Canela Indians of Brazil. The public middle school in Hillsborough, California is named after him, Crocker Middle School. His Skyfarm mansion was purchased by W Clement Stone, and was donated to the Nueva School in 1971; the mansion currently houses Nueva's lower school division.

The parallel-medium, co-educational school, situated to the west of the N2 national road, was opened at its current site by Dr G. G. (Gawie) Cillie, Chairman of the School Board, in February, 1930. A portion of the land on which it now stands having been given by Mesdames Beynon and Osler, daughters of an early Somerset West shopkeeper and property owner. At this time the school had an enrollment of 220 pupils and a staff of 11 under Mr A. J. Ackerman. The school motto \\"Sibi Fidelis Ipsi\\" is Latin for \\"True To Oneself\\". Prior to 1930, the school operated under the name Somerset West Public School. As of 2013, it has 1,232 students and 52 teachers. It has students registered in grades 8 through 12. The school enjoys a strong sporting rivalry with its neighbour high schools, Ho√´rskool Strand and Parel Vallei High School. The school is a site for students in the Scientific and Industrial Leadership Initiative (SAILI), a non-profit programme for promising science and engineering pupils which was set up in 2002 by the heads of the four universities in the province after they became frustrated at the low skills levels of first-year students. SAILI identifies students in low-income families in the second-last year of primary schooling and provides catch-up and reinforcement classes, after which they can enter good quality high schools such as Hottentots Holland. They continue to take classes every two Saturdays at venues such as the MTN Sciencentre for the first two years of high school, after which they take booster lessons at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology.

The design became the basis for what later became the ORIC ATMOS and later computers, which has similar keyboard addressing and tape I/O as in the Microtan 65. The Microtan 65 has a single step function that can be used for debugging at the hardware level. The computer was available as ready-built boards or as kits consisting of board and components requiring soldering together. The Microtan 65 was intended as a general purpose microcomputer which could be used by laboratories, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM)s and the computer enthusiast, and it was designed with expandability in mind. In this way the customer could customise the system, be it as a specialised control system, as a learning tool, or as a general purpose computing device. Price of the Microtan 65 board in 1981 was ¬£79.35 (inc. VAT) in kit form or ¬£90.85 ready- assembled. The system was not generally available in the shops. To accompany the hardware and to offer further support to users, a magazine was created, the Tansoft Gazette (name inspired by the Liverpool Software Gazette). This was edited by Tangerine employee Paul Kaufman who continued as editor when the magazine was renamed Oric Owner. Tansoft also became the name of Tangerine Computer's official software house which supplied a number of software products and book for the Microtan system and subsequently for the Oric range of computers.  Main Board  The Microtan 65 Main Board The Microtan 65 was quite simple by today's standards, with: * an NMOS 6502 CPU running at 750 kHz clock rate * 1K byte of RAM, used both for display memory and user programs * 1K byte of ROM for the monitor program * video logic and a television RF modulator, for the 16 rows of 32 characters display * a software scanned hexadecimal keypad * an optional ASCII keyboard = Display = The major advance that the Microtan 65 had over a lot of the competition at that time was that the video display was flicker free. At the time a lot of microcomputers would either access the screen memory asynchronously to the video timing (causing flicker and splats on the screen), or would write to the screen memory during a non-display period (which was slow). The Microtan 65 got over this problem by making use of an incidental feature of the 6502. The 6502 (unlike most other CPUs) has a regular period in each instruction cycle when all CPU activity is inside the chip, leaving the external memory available without using complex external arbitration logic. This made video display design simpler and meant that video accesses could be made at maximum speed. This technique is also used on the Oric-1 and Atmos, and in the unrelated Apple II. The 32√ó16 characters was the reason that the 6502 was clocked at 750 kHz. To get the circuitry to work at a (nearly) standard video rate meant that the pixel clock had to be 6 MHz. When the Microtan 65 was designed only a 1 MHz 6502 was available, and so 750 kHz was used (6 MHz divided by 8). The Microtan 65 Hex Keypad = Software = The 1K byte monitor program (later increased to a 2K) is called TANBUG. The software facilities were rudimentary: * M = Memory modify / examine * L = List a block of memory * G = Go command (Run a program) * R = Registers display / modify * S = set Single step mode * N = set Normal mode (cancel S command) * P = Proceed command (execute next instruction in Single step mode) * B = set Breakpoints * O = calculate Offset for use in branch instructions * C = Copy a block of memory = Memory Map = The Microtan 65 memory map is shown below ($ representing a hexadecimal memory address): * $0000 Zero Page * $0100 Stack * $0200 Screen RAM * $0300 * $0400 End of Microtan 65 RAM - map continued from $0400 to $0700 as RAM on TANEX * $8000 I/O * $C000 * $F800 TANBUG V2 * $FFFF The screen memory occupies the space between $200 and $3FF. In addition to the standard 8 bits of screen RAM, there was an additional single bit RAM shadowing the $200 to $300 space. This was configured as a 9th bit write-only plane, and was used by the Microtan 65 for rudimentary, or \\"chunky\\", graphics. Setting the 9th bit displayed a Minitel type block graphic. The display is 32 characters across by 16 lines down, with memory address $200 representing the top left hand displayed character, $220 the second row, etc. The character representation is standard ASCII. Several pieces of Microtan 65 software write to the bottom line by writing to memory starting at $3E0 - the leftmost character on the bottom line, rather than vectoring through TANBUG. = Input/output = I/O in the Microtan 65 is decoded into a 16 KB space to simplify the hardware. In fact the 1 KB of RAM is mirrored through the bottom 32 KB, the I/O through the next 16 KB, and the EPROM through the top 16 KB. If you added an expansion board (see TANEX below) the decoding was modified and the wasted space reclaimed. In common with other 6502 designs, I/O is mapped into the memory space. There is no dedicated I/O space as on the Z80, 8086 etc. The I/O ports are (when fully decoded): *Write to $BFF0 Clear Keyboard Flag (Keyboard would generate an IRQ) *Read from $BFF0 Turn Graphics On (enables \\"9th bit\\" graphics writes) *Write to $BFF1 Used by the hardware single step *Write to $BFF2 To write a scan pattern to the hex keypad (if fitted) *Write to $BFF3 Turn off Graphics (disable \\"9th bit\\" graphics writes) *Read From $BFF3 Read Keyboard Port (either keypad or ASCII keyboard)  TANEX expansion board  The Microtan 65 Tanex board. The EPROM chip with the green spot (centre) contains the XBUG monitor extension, the other three EPROMs the Microsoft Extended BASIC. The bottom row of chips are the 7K static RAM - 14 X 2114. The 6522 VIA is at left, with an empty socket for an additional 6522 alongside. The empty green socket at top centre is for the 6551 UART. Adding a TANEX board provided a number of features: * an add-on to TANBUG called XBUG * space for an additional 7K bytes of RAM * five EPROM sockets * two 6522 VIAs * a 6551 UART, providing a cassette interface for storing and retrieving programs (300 baud CUTS, and 2400 baud), and a serial interface Without a TANEX board, and due to deliberately ambiguous address decoding, the address $F7F7 would appear to the 6502 to have the same data as $FFF7. In TANBUG, this is a jump to an internal monitor routine. With TANEX installed, $F7F7 is decoded properly, and that address is an entry point into XBUG. XBUG provided features such as cassette tape loading and saving, a simple assembler / disassembler, hex calculator. The ROM sockets on TANEX could be used to run a 10K Microsoft Extended BASIC, a two-pass assembler, or even (and more likely given the hardware bias of the Microtan 65) code written for a specific hardware control application. Price of the TANEX board in 1981 was ¬£49.45 as a \\"minimum configuration\\" kit - lacking one of the 6522 VIAs and the 6551 and with 1K of RAM - and ¬£60.95 for a similar board fully assembled. TANEX was also available with the board fully populated with chips (although excluding XBUG, ROMs & BASIC) and in this form the costs were ¬£103.16 for the kit and ¬£114.66 ready assembled. Further Expansion The interior of a System Rack Microtan 65 with the front panel removed and the Microtan 65 & Tanex boards at the left The Microtan 65 was designed as a modular system able to be expanded as required, and for this each board included an 80-pin connector at one end allowing it to be plugged into a backplane-type motherboard. A simple two- socket \\"Mini Motherboard\\" connected the Microtan 65 and TANEX boards for minimum expansion and in this form the system was also available ready-built from Tangerine, complete with case and full ASCII keyboard, as the Tangerine Micron, costing ¬£395.00 in 1981. For further expansion the builder could purchase the full \\"System Motherboard\\" which featured an additional ten sockets, bringing the total available sockets to twelve. For housing this, a \\"System Rack\\", rack-based case was available, in black and silver with a black front panel trimmed in Tangerine's trademark orange. Additional boards became available with time, including a 40K memory board - TANRAM, made up of 32K of dynamic and 8K of static RAM, bringing the total non-paged memory to 48K, a dedicated parallel I/O board featuring 16 parallel input/output ports; a similar dedicated serial I/O board featuring 8 serial input/output ports, a disk controller board for use with disk drives, a Disk Operating System - TANDOS 65, a high resolution graphics board featuring 8K of static graphics RAM giving a resolution of 256 √ó 256 pixels, a dedicated 32K ROM board, (aimed mainly at OEM and general purpose applications or for use with AIM, KIM and SYM systems), capable of holding either 8 √ó 2732 or 16 √ó 2716 EPROMs; and a 32K RAM board featuring two 16K banks of 4116 dynamic RAM, again intended for similar purposes to the 32K ROM board. In addition, several third-party suppliers offered boards designed for use with the Microtan 65 system. In addition to the BASIC programming language Tangerine also released on disk TANFORTH, an extended version of FIG FORTH featuring a full FORTH compiler and editor.

Schoolboy football Benali was born in Southampton and attended Bellemoor School. He played for Winsor United in the Southampton Tyro League. At this level he was playing as a forward and was a prolific goal- scorer, being an early developer and quicker and stronger than most footballers of his age. He was selected to represent Southampton and Hampshire Schools, and progressed to the England schoolboy team, scoring on his debut against Northern Ireland and making nine appearances at this level. Career Benali made his first team debut on 1 October 1988, coming off the bench against Derby County, in a 0‚Äì0 draw at The Dell. His first start came soon after on 25 October 1988 at White Hart Lane against Tottenham Hotspur in a 2‚Äì1 win. He soon became a mainstay in the Saints team, going on to make a total of 389 appearances for the club, including 243 Premier League appearances. His only FA Premier League goal came on 13 December 1997 with a header from a Matthew Le Tissier free-kick against Leicester City at The Dell. After losing his first-team place to Wayne Bridge, in January 2003, Benali returned to the starting line-up making two league appearances against Sunderland and Manchester United as well as two in the F.A. Cup against Millwall. Although Benali did not appear in the F.A. Cup Final on 17 May 2003, he was awarded a runners-up medal for his two appearances in Round 4. The replay against Millwall turned out to be his final competitive appearance for Southampton. His final appearance in the Southampton first-team came as a substitute in the inaugural Ted Bates trophy match in January 2004 against Bayern Munich. Benali was named as one of \\"Southampton's Cult Heroes,\\" in a book by Jeremy Wilson in October 2006.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Southamptons-Cult-Heroes-Saints- Greatest/dp/1905449011 Coaching In July 2003, Benali joined the coaching staff at St. Mary's and took charge of the under-12 side at the Academy. On the departure of manager Harry Redknapp in December 2005, Benali and Matthew Le Tissier put themselves forward as joint candidates for the vacant position, but were not interviewed by chairman Rupert Lowe. Benali had a two-year spell coaching at Romsey Town first coaching his son Luke in the under-18s before managing the club's reserve side.

Charitable activities Benali has been a patron of the following charities: * The Children's Fire and Burn Trust * The Dave Wellman Cancer Trust In August/September 2014, Benali completed a three-week 1,000-mile (1,600 km) challenge running to all 20 Premier League grounds, raising in excess of ¬£100,000 for the charity Cancer Research UK. As a result, he became the first recipient to be awarded with the Spirit of the Game award in December 2014. He was also awarded the Just Giving Celebrity Fundraiser of the Year award in September 2015. In October 2016, Benali completed another ultra-challenge, running and cycling to all 44 Premier League and Championship stadiums in 2 weeks. He ran a marathon and cycled 75 miles each day and in the process raised over ¬£350,000 for Cancer Research UK. Following this, he was awarded the freedom of the city of Southampton. In April 2019 it was announced that Benali would race seven Ironmans in seven days, as part of his aim to raise ¬£1million for Cancer Research UK. Despite being hospitalised, Benali completed five Ironmans, raising ¬£1million.

The word is sometimes said to be synonymous with \\"botanist\\" or \\"horticulturist\\", but that would indicate a professional involvement, whereas \\"plantsman\\" reflects an attitude to (and perhaps even an obsession with) plants. A horticulturist may be a plantsman, but a plantsman is not necessarily a horticulturist. Defining the word In the first edition (June 1979) of The Plantsman (a specialist magazine, published by the Royal Horticultural Society from 1994 until June 2019, when it was announced that the title would be changed to The Plant Review), Sandra Raphael (then a senior editor in the Dictionary Department of the Oxford University Press) contributed a short article on the history and meaning of the word. Her first example came from an issue of the Gardeners' Chronicle of 1881, when it seemed to mean \\"A nurseryman, a florist\\" (in the early sense of \\"florist\\" as a grower and breeder of flowers, rather than the more recent meaning of someone who sells or arranges them). She added that a modern definition should point out that \\"plantsman\\" :\\"‚Ä¶is usually intended to mean a connoisseur of plants or an expert gardener.\\" In her article, Raphael also quotes botanist David McClintock (writing in the Botanical Society of the British Isles' BSBI News, December 1976) on how to distinguish a botanist from a plantsman, beginning with the simple definition: :\\"A plantsman is one who loves plants for their own sake and knows how to cherish them. This‚Ä¶ concept‚Ä¶ may include a botanist: it certainly includes a host of admirable amateurs who may not know what a chromosome looks like or what taxonomy means, but they know the growing plant, wild or cultivated, first-hand. To my mind they are the cream of those in the plant world, a fund of invaluable first-hand information.\\" He stresses the value of practical experience, saying: :\\"It is much to be regretted that so few botanists, amateurs or professional, know even how to take cuttings or propagate a plant. How much better to do this, circumspectly, and so get to know the living plant better, than just press and dry the specimen.\\" Notable plantsmen and women John Tradescant the elder (ca 1570s-1638) and his son, John Tradescant the younger (1608-1662), must head the list of historic plantsmen. Charles de l'Ecluse, better known as Carolus Clusius (1526-1609), and Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) are other examples. These early botanists, who certainly grew (and sometimes had also collected) many of the plants they described, can therefore be described as plantsmen (though such a term did not exist in their lifetimes). By contrast, adventurous plant-hunters such as David Douglas (1799-1834), who dedicated (and lost) his life to searching out and collecting plants from the wild, were seldom gardeners and rarely grew the plants they had collected, so perhaps do not count as plantsmen, despite their great knowledge and dedication. Augustine Henry (1857-1930) was a pioneering plant-collector in Western China in the late 19th century who became a professor of forestry in later life. On the other hand, EH Wilson (1876-1930), also famed for his work in China (to the extent that he was known as Ernest \\"Chinese\\" Wilson), began as a gardener and, after working at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, became a plant collector, first for James Veitch & Sons (nurserymen) and later for the Arnold Arboretum. Irish nurseryman William Baylor Hartland (1836-1912) specialised in daffodils in the late 19th century from his nursery in Cork. He was also an authority on apples. Because of their in-depth knowledge, specialist plant-breeders may be considered as plantsmen in their own fields (though the term is often taken to imply a more encyclopaedic interest in a wide range of plants). Influential garden writers such as William Robinson (1838-1935) and garden-designer Gertrude Jekyll (1843-1932) disseminated their knowledge of plants through their writing, as did a later generation of plant-lovers including Margery Fish (1892-1969) and Vita Sackville-West (1892-1962), whose garden at Sissinghurst Castle, created with her husband Harold Nicolson, is now owned by the National Trust and one of the most popular in Britain. Reginald Farrer (1880-1920) was a notable plant-hunter and influential writer in the more specialised area of alpine plants and rock gardening. =Modern plantsmen= Notable modern British plantsmen include Roy Lancaster, the late Christopher Lloyd of Great Dixter (1921‚Äì2006) and the late Beth Chatto (1923‚Äì2018). American nurserymen and plant-collectors who qualify for the title include plant-breeder Dan Heims of Terra Nova Nurseries (who styles himself a \\"hortiholic\\"), Dan Hinkley, co- founder of Heronswood (now an independent author, lecturer and horticultural consultant), and Tony Avent, owner of the renowned Plant Delights Nursery. European candidates include the late Princess Greta Sturdza of Le Vasterival, near Dieppe; the late Robert and Jelena de Belder, the principal creators of Arboretum Kalmthout, Belgium; and influential Dutch garden designer Piet Oudolf, who has pioneered the use of \\"prairie-style\\" planting with bold drifts of perennials and grasses at gardens such as Scampston Hall, North Yorkshire and the RHS Garden, Wisley, Surrey in the UK and at Enk√∂ping in Sweden.Enk√∂pings parker The parks in Enk√∂ping Retrieved 2019-04-16.

Such a collapse is believed unlikely, so the theorem is generally viewed by complexity theorists as evidence for the nonexistence of polynomial size circuits for SAT or for other NP-complete problems. A proof that such circuits do not exist would imply that P ‚â† NP. As P/poly contains all problems solvable in randomized polynomial time (Adleman's theorem), the Karp‚ÄìLipton theorem is also evidence that the use of randomization does not lead to polynomial time algorithms for NP-complete problems. The Karp‚ÄìLipton theorem is named after Richard M. Karp and Richard J. Lipton, who first proved it in 1980. (Their original proof collapsed PH to Sigma_3, but Michael Sipser improved it to Sigma_2.) Variants of the theorem state that, under the same assumption, MA' = AM, and PH collapses to ' complexity class. There are stronger conclusions possible if PSPACE, or some other complexity classes are assumed to have polynomial-sized circuits; see P/poly. If NP is assumed to be a subset of BPP (which is a subset of P/poly), then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to BPP.S. Zachos, Probabilistic quantifiers and games, 1988 If coNP is assumed to be subset of NP/poly, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level.  Intuition  Suppose that polynomial sized circuits for SAT not only exist, but also that they could be constructed by a polynomial time algorithm. Then this supposition implies that SAT itself could be solved by a polynomial time algorithm that constructs the circuit and then applies it. That is, efficiently constructible circuits for SAT would lead to a stronger collapse, P = NP. The assumption of the Karp‚ÄìLipton theorem, that these circuits exist, is weaker. But it is still possible for an algorithm in the complexity class Sigma_2 to guess a correct circuit for SAT. The complexity class Sigma_2 describes problems of the form :exists xforall y;psi(x,y) where psi is any polynomial-time computable predicate. The existential power of the first quantifier in this predicate can be used to guess a correct circuit for SAT, and the universal power of the second quantifier can be used to verify that the circuit is correct. Once this circuit is guessed and verified, the algorithm in class Sigma_2 can use it as a subroutine for solving other problems.  Self-reducibility  To understand the Karp‚ÄìLipton proof in more detail, we consider the problem of testing whether a circuit c is a correct circuit for solving SAT instances of a given size, and show that this circuit testing problem belongs to Pi_1. That is, there exists a polynomial time computable predicate V such that c is a correct circuit if and only if, for all polynomially-bounded z, V(c,z) is true. The circuit c is a correct circuit for SAT if it satisfies two properties: *For every pair (s,x) where s is an instance of SAT and x is a solution to the instance, c(s) must be true *For every instance s of SAT for which c(s) is true, s must be solvable. The first of these two properties is already in the form of problems in class Pi_1. To verify the second property, we use the self-reducibility property of SAT. Self-reducibility describes the phenomenon that, if we can quickly test whether a SAT instance is solvable, we can almost as quickly find an explicit solution to the instance. To find a solution to an instance s, choose one of the Boolean variables x that is input to s, and make two smaller instances s0 and s1 where si denotes the formula formed by replacing x with the constant i. Once these two smaller instances have been constructed, apply the test for solvability to each of them. If one of these two tests returns that the smaller instance is satisfiable, continue solving that instance until a complete solution has been derived. To use self-reducibility to check the second property of a correct circuit for SAT, we rewrite it as follows: *For every instance s of SAT for which c(s) is true, the self-reduction procedure described above finds a valid solution to s. Thus, we can test in Pi_1 whether c is a valid circuit for solving SAT. see Random self-reducibility for more information  Proof of Karp‚ÄìLipton theorem  The Karp‚ÄìLipton theorem can be restated as a result about Boolean formulas with polynomially-bounded quantifiers. Problems in Pi_2 are described by formulas of this type, with the syntax :phi = forall x exists y ; psi(x, y) where psi is a polynomial-time computable predicate. The Karp‚ÄìLipton theorem states that this type of formula can be transformed in polynomial time into an equivalent formula in which the quantifiers appear in the opposite order; such a formula belongs to Sigma_2. Note that the subformula :s(x)=exists y ; psi(x, y) is an instance of SAT. That is, if c is a valid circuit for SAT, then this subformula is equivalent to the unquantified formula c(s(x)). Therefore, the full formula for phi is equivalent (under the assumption that a valid circuit c exists) to the formula :exists cforall (x,z);V(c,z)wedge c(s(x)) , where V is the formula used to verify that c really is a valid circuit using self-reducibility, as described above. This equivalent formula has its quantifiers in the opposite order, as desired. Therefore, the Karp‚ÄìLipton assumption allows us to transpose the order of existential and universal quantifiers in formulas of this type, showing that Sigma_2=Pi_2. Repeating the transposition allows formulas with deeper nesting to be simplified to a form in which they have a single existential quantifier followed by a single universal quantifier, showing that PH=Sigma_2.  Another proof and S2P  Assume mathsf{NP} subseteq mathsf{P/poly}. Therefore, there exists a family of circuits C_n that solves satisfiability on input of length n. Using self- reducibility, there exists a family of circuits D_n which outputs a satisfying assignment on true instances. Suppose L is a Pi_2 set :L = {z : forall x. exists y. phi(x,y,z)} , Since exists y. phi(x,y,z) can be considered an instance of SAT (by Cook-Levin theorem), there exists a circuit D_n, depending on n = z, such that the formula defining L is equivalent to Furthermore, the circuit can be guessed with existential quantification: Obviously () implies (). If (1) is false, then eg exists y. phi(x,y,z). In this case, no circuit D can output an assignment making phi(x, D(x, z), z); true. The proof has shown that a Pi_2 set L is in Sigma_2. What's more, if the Pi_2 formula is true, then the circuit D will work against any x. If the Pi_2 formula is false, then x making the formula (1) false will work against any circuit. This property means a stronger collapse, namely to S complexity class (i.e. Pi_2 subseteq mathsf{S}_2^P subseteq Sigma_2). It was observed by Sengupta.Jin Yi-Cai. S_2^P subseteq mathsf{ZPP}^{mathsf{NP}} , section 6 = AM = MA = A modificationV. Arvind, J. K√∂bler, U. Sch√∂ning, R. Schuler, If NP has Polynomial-Size Circuits, then MA = AM of the above proof yields :mathsf{NP} subseteq mathsf{P/poly} implies mathsf{AM} = mathsf{MA} (see Arthur‚ÄìMerlin protocol). Suppose that L is in AM, i.e.: :z in L implies Pr olimits_x[exists y. phi(x,y,z)] geq tfrac{2}{3} :z otin L implies Pr olimits_x[exists y. phi(x,y,z)] leq tfrac{1}{3} and as previously rewrite exists y. phi(x,y,z) using the circuit D_n that outputs a satisfying assignment if it exists: :z in L implies Pr olimits_x[phi(x,D_n(x,z),z)] geq tfrac{2}{3} :z otin L implies Pr olimits_x[phi(x,D_n(x,z),z)] leq tfrac{1}{3} Since D_n can be guessed: :z in L implies exists D. Pr olimits_x[phi(x,D(x,z),z)] geq tfrac{2}{3} :z otin L implies forall D. Pr olimits_x[phi(x,D(x,z),z)] leq tfrac{1}{3} which proves L is in the smaller class MA.  Application to circuit lower bounds ‚Äì Kannan's theorem  Kannan's theorem states that for any fixed k there exists a language L in Sigma_2, which is not in SIZE(nk) (This is a different statement than Sigma_2 ot subseteq mathsf{P/poly}, which is currently open and states that there exists a single language that is not in SIZE(nk) for any k). It is a simple circuit lower bound. Proof outline: There exists a language L in Sigma_4 - mathsf{SIZE}(n^k) (the proof uses diagonalization technique). Consider two cases: * If mathsf{SAT} otin mathsf{P/poly} then mathsf{SAT} otin mathsf{SIZE}(n^k) and theorem is proved. * If mathsf{SAT} in mathsf{P/poly}, then by Karp‚ÄìLipton theorem, Sigma_4 = Sigma_2 and therefore L in Sigma_2 - mathsf{SIZE}(n^k). A stronger version of Karp‚ÄìLipton theorem strengthens Kannan's theorem to: for any k, there exists a language L in mathsf{S}_2^P - mathsf{SIZE}(n^k). It is also known that PP is not contained in mathsf{SIZE}(n^k), which was proved by Vinodchandran.N. V. Vinodchandran, A note on the circuit complexity of PP Proof:S. Aaronson, Oracles Are Subtle But Not Malicious * If mathsf{PP} ot subseteq mathsf{P/poly} then mathsf{PP} ot subseteq mathsf{SIZE}(n^k). * Otherwise, mathsf{P^{#P}} subseteq mathsf{P/poly}. Since ::mathsf{P^{#P}} supseteq mathsf{PP} supseteq mathsf{MA} (by property of MA) ::mathsf{P^{#P}} supseteq mathsf{PH} supseteq Sigma_2 supseteq mathsf{MA} (by Toda's theorem and property of MA) ::mathsf{P^{#P}} = mathsf{MA} (follows from assumption using interactive protocol for permanent, see P/poly) : the containments are equalities and we get mathsf{PP} = Sigma_2 ot subseteq mathsf{SIZE}(n^k) by Kannan's theorem.

WSJS was number one in the Triad, and management feared losing that status if the FM became popular.

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 240 He was a full-time member of the bands New York Gong, Shockabilly, Bongwater and Dogbowl & Kramer, has played on tour (usually on bass guitar) with bands such as Butthole Surfers, B.A.L.L., Ween, Half Japanese and The Fugs (1984 reunion tour), and has also performed regularly with John Zorn and other improvising musicians of New York City's so-called \\"downtown scene\\" of the 1980s. Kramer's most notable work as a producer has been with bands such as Galaxie 500 (whose entire oeuvre he produced), Low (whom he discovered and produced), Half Japanese, White Zombie, GWAR, King Missile, Danielson Famile, Will Oldham, Daniel Johnston, and Urge Overkill, including their hit cover of \\"Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon\\". Early music career Kramer's first experience in the New York music scene came when he played in the band New York Gong, led by Daevid Allen, in 1979 and 1980. Kramer played organ on one song on their 1979 album About Time. In 1980, Kramer joined the band The Chadbournes, led by Eugene Chadbourne, which also included David Licht, Tom Cora and John Zorn. They played together until Chadbourne, Kramer and Licht formed the band Shockabilly, which toured from 1982 until 1985. The pressures of living on the road led to personal differences between Kramer and Chadbourne. The band dissolved while on a US tour early in 1985. That tour included a brief tour of Texas with the then-unknown Butthole Surfers. Forging a close friendship with co-founding Butthole Surfers members Gibby Haynes and Paul Leary, Kramer was available when the band needed to replace their bassist. Kramer bought a H√∂fner Beatle bass and joined the Butthole Surfers' debut European tour in 1985. Production and studio After touring, Kramer took over a New York recording studio named \\"Noise New York\\", using a loan of $5,000 from an uncle. The studio was to serve as a mainstay for artists and bands both local and international, and Kramer became one of the busiest indie music producers in NYC. The first recording at Noise New York was the Buttholes' rendition of \\"American Woman\\". Kramer formed the record label Shimmy-Disc two years later in 1987, and enjoyed critical acclaim, releasing albums including Songs from the Pink Death. The label remained a favorite at college radio stations for the next decade. Shimmy-Disc artists included Bongwater, King Missile, GWAR, Naked City, Ruins, Boredoms, Damon & Naomi, Daniel Johnston, White Zombie, Yellow Plastic Bucket and Ween. Bongwater In the early 1980s Kramer met Ann Magnuson, New York City performance artist, when he ran the sound for a band she was in, Pulsallama, during their frequent performances at Club 57. After Pulsallama disbanded in 1984, the two began to collaborate, and in 1986 they formed Bongwater. Together they released five LPs, including Double Bummer, and culminating with their 1991 swansong, The Big Sell-Out. In 1991 they began a romantic relationship while Kramer was separated from his estranged wife, who was at that point three months pregnant with their daughter. After several months, Kramer decided to end the romantic relationship and reconcile with his wife, and the end of the relationship also spelled the end of the band. Several months later, Magnuson sued Kramer for $4.5 million for breach of contract, among other charges, and Kramer responded with a counter-suit. The subsequent legal battle resulted in the financial crippling of the Shimmy-Disc label, which never recovered. The lawsuits were eventually settled out of court in 1997 for undisclosed terms. Association with Penn & Teller A pivotal moment in Kramer's early career came when Jad Fair of Half Japanese introduced him to Penn & Teller. Kramer soon found himself working eight shows per week as Sound Consultant on Penn & Teller's 1987 Broadway show, and composing the music for their Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends special. In 1992, Kramer formed the band the Captain Howdy with Penn Jillette, and together with guest artists Debbie Harry (of Blondie) and Billy West, they made two highly eclectic CDs together, both released on Shimmy- Disc. Following Penn's permanent relocation to Las Vegas in 1997, the group disbanded. Collaboration with other artists In 1988 Kramer and Fair released the record Roll Out the Barrel together on Kramer's Shimmy-Disc label. They reunited in 1998 and published the record The Sound of Music. An Unfinished Symphony in 12 Parts that year. In 1990 Kramer first met the two- man band Ween when they played a show at a small New York club, the Pyramid Club. Kramer struck up a friendship with the two, who had already been fans of the Shimmy-Disc label, and he convinced them to release their home-recorded demos on Shimmy-Disc, on what became the 1991 album The Pod. In 1992 the three went on a brief tour of England, where Kramer played bass. The tour did not go well, due to personality and creative differences between Kramer and the two members of Ween, although Ween band member Mickey Melchiondo said in a 2007 interview that \\"we're still friends\\". Changes in ownership of studio and record label In 1992 Kramer sold his Noise New York recording studio and moved just across the Hudson River, where he'd found a house going into foreclosure with a state-of-the-art 24-track recording studio built in. He dubbed the studio Noise New Jersey, and continued to produce recordings there, including, most famously, Urge Overkill's cover of \\"Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon\\". However, family illness and personal challenges weighed on him during these years, and the pressures of balancing his profile as an artist with his work as a producer and label head proved too heavy. Though it was during this time that he produced some of his greatest recordings, including the three- record box set \\"The Guilt Trip,\\" the consistency of his output had begun to suffer. It was at this point in time that Kramer began to look for a way to move the day-to-day management of Shimmy-Disc into what he had hoped in vain would be more able hands. Shortly following the sale of Shimmy Disc and his recording facility to the Knitting Factory in 1998 (in which he was contracted to play a continuing role in the label as producer and Director of A&R;), Kramer sued the Knitting Factory for breach of contract and soon found himself without a creative base for the first time in his professional career. This experience left him emotionally devastated and looking to exit the music business without delay. He did so immediately following his last European tour in November 1999, dubbed \\"The Last Tour of the Century\\", which, according to Magnet magazine, was \\"a creative flop and a financial bust.\\" Film and theater Envisioning a complete about-face, Kramer turned to his lifelong passion in film and theater, and in late 2000 he began studying directing under film and stage director Arthur Penn, whom he had met in 1989 when Penn directed Penn & Teller Get Killed. Kramer spent the better part of four years at New York's Actors Studio, where, in addition to learning directing, he did sound design and music for various productions at the Actors Studio Free Theater on 42nd street. This phase of Kramer's career culminated in 2002 when he composed the music for Fortune's Fool, the Tony Award-winning Broadway play directed by Arthur Penn and starring Alan Bates and Frank Langella, both of whom swept the Broadway acting awards for that year. Kramer had just been appointed assistant director on Arthur Penn's next Broadway play (Sly Fox) when his mother Rosalyn was stricken with a debilitating stroke, which drew him to Florida in 2003. She died 16 months later of complications thereof. Work with the James Randi Educational Foundation After moving to Ft. Lauderdale area, Kramer worked for the James Randi Educational Foundation from 2004 until February, 2006. His main job was to manage the foundation's One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge with a million dollar prize to anyone who could demonstrate paranormal ability (the money remains unawarded.) Kramer also maintained the foundation's video library and oversaw the digital transfer of over 700 archival VHS tapes to DVD, comprising the most complete document of the life and career of James Randi. Recent activities Kramer is associated with the formation of the so-called \\"slowcore\\" movement, thanks mainly to his production work for two seminal bands of the era: Low and Galaxie 500. He continues to produce, mix and master a great variety of artists worldwide. Kramer operates a private CD/LP mastering and mixing studio in Florida. In 2006 he announced the return of his record company, under the new name \\"Second-Shimmy\\". The debut release in October 2006 was I Killed the Monster - 21 Artists Performing the Songs by Daniel Johnston, featuring performances by Dot Allison, Fair & Kramer, Daniel Smith & Sufjan Stevens, Kimya Dawson, R. Stevie Moore, Major Matt Mason USA, Jeff Lewis, Joy Zipper, among others. In 2006, Kramer worked on the LP Exaltation of Larks, a solo release from Dot Allison. The LP was released in September 2007 on Cooking Vinyl in the UK and P-Vine in Japan. Kramer premiered his composition \\"Things to Come\\" in Tokyo in 2007. Hoping to perform the piece annually, he has subsequently performed it in Tel Aviv in 2008, Melbourne in 2009 and Paris in 2010. In January 2008 Kramer toured with Fair; 14 cities in 14 days in Japan with Mike Watt and Samm Bennett in a \\"dueling bass\\" trio called Brother's Sister's Daughter. In 2012 Kramer released The Brill Building on Zorn's Tzadik label, an album of cover songs written in the Brill Building in the early 1960s. In 2017, Tzadik followed up that release with Kamer's The Brill Building, Book Two, featuring guitar work by Bill Frisell. Also in 2017, Kramer launched a new vinyl-only record label, Shimmy-500, to release limited edition vinyl. The first and only release on the new label (on June 9, 2017) was the third Jad Fair & Kramer collaboration, The History of Crying. In January 2020, Kramer was named one of the 12 curators of the Joyful Noise Recordings White Label Series, alongside David Lynch, Lydia Lunch, Son Lux and others. On April 29 2020, Joyful Noise Recordings also named Kramer their 2020 Artist-In-Residence, and simultaneously announced a new partnership with Kramer for the rebirth of his Shimmy-Disc label. The first releases by the newly revived label are 3 singles by Kramer's new recording project with U.K. vocalist Xan Tyler, Let It Come Down. Their debut LP performing as Let It Come Down, entitled 'Songs We Sang In Our Dreams' was released on June 12th, 2020. The A.I.R. series culminates in a 5-LP box set of Kramer projects, and officially launches the new Shimmy-Disc label's activities.

P. Taylor, first published privately in 2002. It is a Christian allegory in the form of a fantasy adventure, akin to C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia. Taylor wrote the book to counteract what he saw as a rise in atheist propaganda in children's books such as His Dark Materials.Meet the vicar who's \\"Hotter than Potter\\", BBC, 2003 It is the first of four books generally referred to as The Shadowmancer Quartet. The book was a number one best seller in the UK and the US. Two thematic sequels named Wormwood and Tersias were also released soon after. A direct sequel named The Shadowmancer Returns: The Curse of Salamander Street that follows on where Shadowmancer left off was released in 2006. The book has garnered some controversy for its negative portrayal of witches and pagans, whom it claims have been tricked by and worship the Devil.Taylor claims pagans hate his work, BBC, 2003 Despite this, Taylor claims to be \\"an authority on Wicca and paganism\\". Blog on the book Plot summary The fantasy story takes place in Whitby and concerns the evil sorcerer Reverend Obadiah Demurral who is seeking two powerful amulets, called the Keruvim, which he plans to use to control the elements and dominate the world. At the start of the book he purchases the first Keruvim (which takes the form of a golden statuette of a cherub) from an Ethiopian mercenary named Gebra Nubera. He then uses the Keruvim to destroy a ship upon which the next Keruvim is prophesied to arrive, but when he surveys the wreckage he finds nothing. The next day an Ethiopian boy named Raphah arrives searching for the Keruvim. He befriends the main character, an urchin named Thomas and reveals that he is a messenger from God (referred to as Riathamus here), and that Demurral is a Shadowmancer, a sorcerer who can control the dead. Despite not believing in God, Thomas agrees to assist Raphah in regaining the Keruvim because he wants revenge on Demurral for evicting him and his dying mother from their home. They pursue Demurral and the Keruvim with the assistance of Thomas's tomboy friend Kate and the mysterious smuggler, Jacob Crane. During the story, Raphah, Kate and Jacob Crane, who all for their own individual reasons did not believe in God, do come to believe in him. Eventually it is revealed that, in using the Keruvim, Demurral has unleashed a demonic race called the Glashan who were imprisoned at the dawn of time for rebelling against God. Led by the evil Pyratheon (the Devil), they join forces with Demurral so that they can find the other Keruvim and harness its power to overthrow God and rule the universe. It is eventually revealed that Raphah is the other Keruvim, so Demurral and Pyratheon try to capture him, so that they can kill him and turn him into an Azimuth (a slave spirit) to activate the Keruvim's full power. At the climax of the story Thomas, Kate and Raphah meet an angel referred to as a Seruvim (a play on the word Seraphim) named Raphael, who goes by the alias Abram Rickards. A showdown takes place in Demurral's church during which Raphah is killed and Pyratheon obtains the Keruvim. He recites the incantation to activate its power and the world is temporarily plunged into night. Pyratheon thinks he has succeeded in stealing the power of God and gloats. However Abram then reveals that while Raphah is dead it has no power and all Pyratheon has done is meddle with time. After Abram restores life to Raphah, the sun rises, Abram is revealed in his true form and Pyratheon and Demurral flee. Abram tells Thomas, Kate and Jacob Crane to take the Keruvim away to another land so they leave aboard Crane's ship, The Magenta. However, in the closing page of the book it is revealed that they are being stealthily pursued by sea-demons known as Seloth. Characters * Thomas Barrick: A rebellious but nihilistic street-urchin who harbours great resentment towards Obadiah Demurral for evicting himself and his sick mother from their home. He is the main character as most of the story is told from his point of view. His tough exterior masks a more vulnerable side. Ultimately he comes to accept God from his time spent with Raphah. * Kate Coglan: Tom's tomboy best friend who has always played the role of a big sister to him. It is stated that she \\"never cries\\" but soon after her introduction, when she encounters the demons at Demurral's command, her strong exterior disintegrates and she is revealed to be weak and ineffective when faced with true adversity. Throughout the book, she is shown to initially be cowardly, useless and dependent on others, until her resolve strengthens through her friendship with Thomas Raphah. * Raphah: A young holy man from Ethiopia with divine powers from God. A healer with a gentle, humorous disposition, he reveals a fiery side to his personality whenever confronted with evil or injustice. He is searching for the Keruvim, unaware that he himself is its twin. * Jacob Crane: A charismatic and sardonic smuggler who dresses in an elegant, dandified manner, Crane is strong, independent and opportunistic. Despite his veneer of selfishness and cynicism, he is an honourable man and genuinely cares about saving the world. * Obadiah Demurral: The books main antagonist, an evil sorcerer with an embittered, abrasive personality. While he was once a devout man of God, self-loathing and hardship drove him into evil. Demurral is shown to possess a deeply sadistic nature but is given to surprising moments of empathy. It is implied that he is not quite as powerful as he pretends to be. * Pyratheon: The satanic figure in the story, described as a tall, \\"beautiful\\" man with red hair and blue eyes. He is the leader of the Glashan, a demonic race who were imprisoned for trying to steal the power of God and is worshipped as a deity by witches and sorcerers. He has power over all dark creatures on earth and is described by Demurral as \\"the dark god of the universe.\\" A Machiavellian figure, he is shown to be charming, witty, cold, calculating but with occasional fits of rage that cause him to act impulsively. In Wormwood, it is revealed that he is the younger brother of Lilith. * Abram Rickards/Raphael: A sharp-tongued angel with an eye for fashion, Raphael joins Thomas, Kate, Raphah and Jacob Crane during the latter part of their journey and wields a potent weapon known as the Sword of Mayence. He is a formidable fighter with misanthropic tendencies and an acerbic sense of humour. Other media =Special edition= A special edition of Shadowmancer was released in 2003 containing an extra chapter that carried on where the book had left off. In the extra chapter Raphah and the Keruvim are snatched by the Seloth. Special editions of Wormwood and Tersias were also released. =Film rights= In 2004, a $4 million deal with Taylor was announced for the making of a $100 million film version by Fortitude Films, backed by Universal Pictures. Fortitude made it known that they wanted Mel Gibson to direct, with Donald Sutherland playing Demurral and Sean Bean as Jacob Crane.

He was the leading and central name in the first generation of Swedish modernists from 1910 up until his death in 1946, in other words during almost his entire career spanning four decades. He was a highly productive painter as well as a writer and public speaker. Biography The Crane (1915) by Isaac Gr√ºnewald Having studied at an influential Swedish art school for three years, at age 19 Gr√ºnewald travelled to Paris where he soon began studies at Henri Matisse's academy. In 1909 he gained recognition in his homeland when he exhibited his work with a group of Scandinavian artists known as The Young Ones. He met his future wife Sigrid Hjert√©n in 1909 and encouraged her to study painting with him in Paris. Having married in 1911, Gr√ºnewald and Hjert√©n from 1912 on regularly exhibited together at home and abroad. Art historians nowadays often cite them as being responsible for introducing modernism to Sweden. At a time in history when anti-Semitism was both widespread and politically correct and women artists were frowned upon, their works were often the subject of ridicule in the press. In fact, recent research has shown that Gr√ºnewald who became the center of public controversy numerous times was the number one target of anti- Semitism in the Swedish press between 1910 and 1926.Lars M Andersson. En jude √§r en jude √§r en jude. Nordic Press. (2000) Despite or because of his role as the leading and most controversial pioneer in Swedish modernism in his days, in Swedish journalism and literature, he is still sometimes being portrayed as, in effect, the embodiment of a classic Jewish caricature, with insinuations of his not having earned his success fairly; being an insignificant Matisse imitator as an artist but a genius as a businessman. In the 1920s, Gr√ºnewald began reaping major commercial successes. He created stage designs for the Royal Swedish OperaEva Sundler. Isaac Gr√ºnewalds scenografi 1920-1930 (1975) and other theaters. In 1925-26, he decorated the walls and ceiling in the minor hall (since renamed Gr√ºnewald Hall) at the Stockholm Concert Hall, site of the Nobel Prize ceremony, and in 1928 the walls of the Matchstick Palace. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. 250x250px Gr√ºnewald was a professor at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts between 1932 and 1942 and in 1941 he opened his own art school. During the Second World War Gr√ºnewald worked at the renowned R√∂rstrand porcelain factory. He was awarded the Prince Eugen Medal in 1945. His wife Sigrid Hjert√©n suffered from lifelong mental health problems that resulted in her being hospitalized for extended periods in the 1930s. Gr√ºnewald divorced Hjert√©n, who was then hospitalized permanently, in 1937 and remarried. In 1946 he and his second wife M√§rta Grundell were killed in an airplane crash. Gr√ºnewald was the father of three sons born in 1910, 1911 and 1940.

He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Irish Parliamentary Party in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and later a Nationalist Party MP in the Parliament of Northern Ireland. Early years Born at 10 Hamill Street, in the Lower Falls area of Belfast, he was the fifth child of Charles Devlin (died 1906) who ran a hackney cab, and his wife Eliza King (died 1902) who sold groceries from their home, were both Roman Catholics.Hepburn, Anthony C.: in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Vol. 15, Oxford University Press, (2004), p.983 Until he was twelve he attended the nearby St. Mary's Christian Brothers' School in Divis Street, where he was educated in a more 'national' view of Irish history and culture than offered by the diocesan schools or the state system.Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary: p.983 While working briefly as a clerk and in a pub, he showed an early gift for public speaking Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary: p.983 when he became chairman of a debating society founded in 1886 to commemorate the first Irish nationalist election victory in West Belfast. From 1891‚Äì1893 he was a journalist on the Irish News, then on the Freeman's Journal when he became associated with the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH), which he helped to establish in the 1890s.Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary: p.983 He became a lifelong opponent of its loyalist counterpart, the Orange Order. He then worked at Samuel Young MP's brewery company, for whom he managed a Belfast pub until 1902.Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary: p.983 Skilled politician During the 1890s he was active as organiser in the anti-Parnellite Irish National Federation in eastern Ulster. When William O'Brien founded the United Irish League (UIL) in County Mayo in 1898, Devlin founded the UIL section in Belfast which became his political machine in Ulster. He was elected unopposedThe Constitutional Year Book, 1904, published by Conservative Central Office, page 190 (214 in web page) as Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) Member of Parliament for Kilkenny North in the February 1902 by-election. His first political assignment came that year when the Party sent him to Irish Americas on the first of several successful fund- raising missions. It was there that he encountered the power of the Hibernian Orders and on his return set about claiming it for constitutional nationalism, when in 1904 he became lifelong Grandmaster of the AOH in Ireland. Members of his Order, largely composed of earlier members of the Molly Maguires, a militant secret society also known as the Mollies, also became members of the Irish Party, deeply infiltrating it.Garvin, Tom: The Evolution of Irish Nationalist Politics (2005) pp. 107‚Äì110: The Rise of the Hibernians Already secretary of the London-based United Irish League of Great Britain Devlin became General Secretary of O‚ÄôBrien's UIL, replacing John O'Donnell, through the initiative of deputy IPP leader John Dillon MP, with whom he held a close alliance and who had fallen under his influence. This \\"coup\\" gave them nationwide control of the 1200 UIL branches, the organisational base of the IPP, depriving O'Brien of all authority. Devlin had risen in the ranks of the League from being a local Nationalist organiser in Belfast to becoming the only newcomer to the parliamentary party who was accepted politically, as an equal by the established leaders. He was devoted to Dillon who had helped him greatly to his rise to prominence, and Dillon in turn relied greatly on him, not alone for both his control of the UIL and the AOH, but also because he was an outstanding representative of Ulster Nationalism.Lyons, F. S. L.: John Dillon, Ch. 10, p. 288, Routledge & Kegan Paul, London (1968), SBN 7100 2887 3 Immense influence He became a distinguished parliamentarian and had reached the top by the skilful use of two remarkable talents, his persuasive and very powerful oratory, and secondly, that he was a great organisation man, not merely as General Secretary of the United Irish League, but because he also dominated the Ancient Order of Hibernians.Lyons, F. S. L.: p.324 He was the only member of the younger generation to belong to the innermost circle of the IPP leadership and was widely seen as eventual heir-apparent.Maume, Patrick: The long Gestation, Irish Nationalist Life 1891‚Äì1918, p.45, Gill & Macmillan (1999) For some years Devlin had been in bitter conflict with the bishops' Catholic Association who wanted politics based on Catholic rights rather than on nationalism. Now in control of the three nationalist political organisations all sides succumbed to Devlin's influence. The AOH continued the O'Connellite link between Catholicism and nationalism but under a lay controlled organisations. To the Irish party's opponents the AOH was synonymous with Catholic sectarianism, jobbery and patronage.Miller, David W.: Church, State and Nation in Ireland 1898‚Äì1921 pp.208‚Äì15, Gill & Macmillan (1973) Hepburn, A.:, Oxford Dictionary p.983 Devlin represented the main urban and national business interests, which contrasted with his advocacy of social reforms when he took up labour issues especially working conditions in the linen mills and textile trades. In the 1906 British general election, Devlin was re-elected to Kilkenny North, and also to Belfast West which he regained from the Unionists by 16 votes. Choosing to retain the Belfast seat, he served as its MP beyond 1918, when his popularity in Belfast and east Ulster survived the downfall of the IPP. Devlin became governor of the nationalist hinterland after his AOH political machinery rapidly saturated the country, acting through the UIL as the militant support organisation of the Irish Party. Devlin could assure John Redmond leader of the IPP, that at Redmond's bid, his organisation could provide full attendance of suitable \\"supporters\\" at any meeting, demonstration or convention throughout Ireland,Garvin, T.: p.108 something Redmond and his party often availed of. The AOH was vehemently opposed by one nationalist organisation, the Munster based All-for-Ireland League (AFIL), an independent party founded by William O'Brien who held Devlin's AOH as being at the root of widespread religious intimidation and sectarianism. He and his followers were attacked at a UIL Convention in Dublin in February 1909 by 400 militant \\"Mollies\\" organised by Devlin to silence him and his followers at what became known as the \\"Baton Convention\\".O'Brien, Joseph V.: William O'Brien and the course of Irish Politics, 1881‚Äì1918, The All-for-Ireland League p. 187, University of California Press (1976) Home Rule compromised With the involvement of Ireland on the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Devlin sided with Redmond's decision in supporting recruitingHepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary: p.984 for Britain's and the Allied war effort and voluntary enlistment of National Volunteers in Irish regiments of the New Service Army. Redmond's plan was that, post-war, an intended 'Irish Brigade' and the National Volunteers would provide the basis for an Irish army, capable of enforcing Home Rule on reluctant Ulster Unionists.Bowman, Timothy: Irish Regiments in the Great War \\"Raising the Service battalions\\" p.62 (Note 2: Dooley, T. P. The Irish Sword XVIII, 72, (1991) p. 209) Manchester University Press (2003) After the 1916 Easter Rising Devlin compromised with Northern Nationalists on a temporary six-county exclusion to assist Lloyd George's abortive home rule negotiations, organising a convention which endorsed exclusion by a vote of 475 to 265.Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary p.984 On the other hand, during the Irish Convention he sided with the bishops in blocking Redmond's compromise with Southern Unionists on Home Rule.Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary: p.984 In April 1918 Devlin was signatory to the anti- Conscription Crisis of 1918 pledge. At the end of the war he was elected Nationalist MP for Belfast Falls in the 1918 general election (in which he defeated √âamon de Valera of Sinn F√©in), one of the very few Irish Parliamentary Party MPs to retain their seats against the Sinn F√©in landslide. Minority leader During 1919‚Äì1921 his leadership was reduced to six Nationalist MPs. His attempts to achieve a united nationalist front was undermined because of resentment by west Ulster nationalists of his acceptance of temporary partition as the price for a Home Rule settlement in 1916.Maume, Patrick: Who's Who p.225 He avoided any involvement in All-Ireland politics having accepted that the mandate had passed to Sinn F√©in. Although, when he tried to bring up the Croke Park killings that occurred on Bloody Sunday at Westminster, he was shouted down and physically attacked by Conservative MP John Elsdale Molson; the Speaker had to suspend the sitting. In the first election in 1921 for the Northern Ireland House of Commons after the Government of Ireland Act 1920 was enacted, so as not to allow the Ulster Unionists a \\"walk-over\\" he agreed a pact with de Valera that Nationalists would not stand against Sinn F√©iners; both parties co-operated during the election and won 6 seats each, the Unionists 40. Devlin, who represented a more moderate nationalist view, was elected for both Antrim and Belfast West. He chose to sit for Belfast West although his seat in the seven member Antrim constituency was left vacant for the rest of the Parliament. He continued to sit at Westminster as leader of the Nationalist Party of Northern Ireland, as both small parties did not recognise the Stormont parliament. His Belfast Falls seat was abolished in 1922, when Devlin unsuccessfully fought Liverpool Exchange; he returned to Westminster in 1929. Devlin was re-elected in Belfast West in 1925 when he decided to lead his small party out of abstentionism and sat for the first time in the Parliament of Northern Ireland as head of a powerless opposition, but so as to highlight Catholic grievances, especially in relation to education. He was returned for the four member constituency until Proportional Representation by the Single Transferable Vote was abolished for territorial constituencies and single member seats were introduced for the 1929 election. From 1929 until his death, Joe Devlin was the Northern Ireland MP for Fermanagh and Tyrone. He won amendment to the Northern Ireland Education Act of 1930 which improved the funding of Catholic schools. Otherwise they were years of demoralisation for northern Catholics, and the party abstained after 1932 due to the abolishment of proportional representation, when frustration finally drove him and his followers out of the Belfast parliament again, when his party abstained. Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary p.984 Personal background \\"Wee Joe\\" as he was popularly known,Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary: p.984 was held in high affection by his constituents for his charming and effervescent personality. He was a fluent and powerful orator. In later years he was comfortably off as director of the Distillery Company and chairman of the Irish News and enjoyed organising summer f√™tes ‚Äì \\"days of delight\\" ‚Äì for Belfast children. His approach in life was 'getting things done'. He lived most of his life in Belfast, though he spent some earlier years in London. He never married. An acknowledged spokesman and leader of Catholic nationalists in Ulster for decades, Devlin died in Belfast on 18 January 1934. He was buried at Milltown Cemetery. His funeral at St. Peter's, Belfast, was attended by leading members of both governments. The AOH hall in Ardboe, County Tyrone, is named after him.Hepburn, A.: Oxford Dictionary: p.984 Notes  Sources  * Parliamentary Election Results in Ireland, 1801‚Äì1922, edited by B.M.

The street begins at the southern end of Broadway, at the intersection with Stone Street. Whitehall Street stretches south to the southern end of FDR Drive, adjacent to the Staten Island Ferry's Whitehall Terminal, on landfill beyond the site of Peter Stuyvesant's 17th- century house. The street is one-way southbound for three blocks from Bowling Green to Pearl Street, and one-way northbound up from the FDR Drive to Pearl Street. The southernmost block, adjacent to the ferry terminal, provides access from FDR Drive to the Battery area.  Nearby structures  Alexander Hamilton Custom House, seen from across Whitehall Street Near the foot of the street is the site of the Governor's house built by Peter Stuyvesant; when the British English took over New Amsterdam from the Dutch, they christened the street and the building \\"Whitehall\\" for England's seat of government, Whitehall, London. On the Castello map (1660, illustration) Whitehall, with its white roof, stands on a jutting piece of land at Manhattan's tip, facing along the waterfront strand that extends along the East River. The only extensive pleasure gardens in seventeenth-century Nieuw Amsterdam/New York are seen to extend behind it, laid out in a patterned parterre of four squares. Other grounds in the center of blocks behind houses are commons and market gardens. The mansion is long gone, and now the name survives only as the short north-south Whitehall Street. In the 2000s the Metropolitan Transportation Authority renovated the Topps Corporation office building at 2 Broadway, to use as a new headquarters. There are several other office buildings and low- density shops on that street. Army Building From 1884 to the end of the Vietnam War, the Army Building, used as offices, a military recruiting center, and an Armed Forces Examination and Entrance Station (i.e., induction center), was located at 39 Whitehall Street, at the intersection of White Hall, Pearl, and Water Streets. Nearly three million Americans were inducted at the Army building before being closed after two bombings by war resisters (in 1968 and 1969). The damage was superficial, however, and the building has been repurposed as a glass-skinned condominium, with retail space and the alternate address: 3 New York Plaza. Transportation Staten Island Ferry's Whitehall Terminal There is an active passenger ferry terminal at the southern tip of Whitehall Street: the Whitehall Terminal, which serves the Staten Island Ferry. However, its facilities in use have shifted over the decade, as have the destinations served. The original Whitehall Terminal served Brooklyn, Governors Island, Staten Island, and Jersey City, New Jersey, and it was originally served mainly by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company's elevated train lines at South Ferry station. Furthermore, the terminal once served vehicular traffic.Staten Island Museum website, retrieved February 22, 2011. However, the subways have replaced the els, and cars now use fixed crossings such as the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. The structure was renovated in the 1950s and reopened in 1956. It was destroyed by fire in 1991. It was renovated in 1992-2005. The Battery Maritime Building, housing the ferry to Governors Island, is located just east of the Whitehall Terminal. It is open to the public from April through October. The terminal was renovated in 2001-2005. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Whitehall Street‚ÄìSouth Ferry station () of the New York City Subway is located on Whitehall Street. Entrances are located at the northern and southern ends of the street (at Stone Street and the Staten Island Ferry terminal, respectively).

She soon became a success in 10 stage productions in New York City before sailing in 1894 to London, where she performed in The Shop Girl. Her performances there led critics to compare Ward favorably to actress Maude Adams. In 1898, however, she married a wealthy diamond merchant and retired from the stage.

In addition to starring in The Hardest Way in 1921, Ward also appears in several shorts released in the 1920s: the Phonofilm short Father Time (1924) in which she sings; another Phonofilm production, The Perennial Flapper (1924); and in the Vitaphone short The Miracle Woman (1929). In 1926, trading on her ever-youthful public image, Ward opened a Paris beauty shop, \\"The Fountain of Youth\\". Personal life and death Ward in Burr McIntosh Monthly, July 1907 Fannie Ward was married twice. Her first husband was Joseph Lewis, a British money lender and diamond dealer. They married in 1898. In 1909, in an interview with newspaper reporter Marguerite Martyn, Ward stated, \\"My husband hates my work\\", and then she questioned why women are treated differently than men professionally: On January 14, 1913, less than four years after the noted interview, Ward and Lewis divorced. The following year she married her second husband, John Wooster Dean (born John H. Donovan, 1874‚Äì1950), an actor who had frequently co-starred with her on stage and in films. Ward's only child, Doroth√© Mabel Lewis (1900‚Äì1938), was the result of an affair with the Viscount Castlereagh, who in 1915 became The Most Hon. The 7th Marquess of Londonderry (1878-1949), an Anglo-Irish aristocrat from Ulster. On January 21, 1952, at age 79, Ward suffered a stroke in her Park Avenue apartment and was found unconscious by a neighbor. She remained in a coma until her death six days later at Lenox Hill Hospital. The New York Times reported that Ward died without a will and left an estate with an estimated value of $40,000.\\"Fannie Ward's Estate\\", The New York Times, 5 February 1952, p. 23. ProQuest Historical Newspapers. The newspaper also reported that she was survived by \\"three English grandsons\\": Lord Patrick Plunkett, the Hon. Shaun Plunkett, and the Hon. Robin Plunkett.

Steve Roper and Mike Nomad was an American adventure comic strip that ran (under various earlier titles) from November 23, 1936, to December 26, 2004. Originally Big Chief Wahoo, the focus and title character of the strip changed over time to Chief Wahoo (1940-1945), Chief Wahoo and Steve Roper (1945-1946), Steve Roper and Wahoo (1946-1948), Steve Roper (1948-1969) and finally Steve Roper and Mike Nomad (1969-2004). Initially distributed by Publishers Syndicate and then by Field Newspaper Syndicate, it ended at King Features Syndicate. Despite the changes in title, characters, themes and authors, the entire 68-year run formed a single evolving story, from an Indian who teamed up with an adventurous young photojournalist to two longtime friends ready to retire after their long, eventful careers.The Great Gusto at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on April 13, 2012. Created by Allen Saunders and Elmer Woggon, the strip was written by Saunders for more than forty years until it was taken over by his son John Saunders, who wrote it for another 24 years. Woggon illustrated the strip from its inception until the mid-1940s; other artists who spent considerable time on the strip included Pete Hoffman (11 years), William Overgard (31 years), and Fran Matera (19 years).  Origins  The strip was originally proposed by Elmer Woggon as The Great Gusto, drawn by himself and written by Allen Saunders (who would also write Mary Worth and Kerry Drake). J. Mortimer Gusto was a freeloading opportunist based on the film persona of W.C. Fields. In his autobiography, Saunders said Fields was flattered. But the syndicate preferred his sidekick Wahoo, so the proposal was revamped to center on him, and the strip debuted on November 23, 1936, as Big Chief Wahoo.Big Chief Wahoo at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. from the original on August 27, 2015.Steve Roper at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on August 27, 2015. In 1937 and 1938, the Sunday page had a topper strip, which featured the following panels in various combinations: Big Chief Wahoo's Dizzy Dictionary, Chief Wahoo Kut-Um Outs, Indian Slango, Oscar the Octopus and Wahoo Jig-Saw Do-Jiggers. Whitman Publishing produced three \\"Big Chief Wahoo\\" Big Little Books: Big Chief Wahoo (1938), Big Chief Wahoo and the Magic Lamp (1940) and Big Chief Wahoo and the Lost Pioneers (1942). Characters and story Wahoo was a short Native American in a ten-gallon hat who was played for laughs but showed courage, loyalty, and common sense. It was whites who were often the targets of the jokes (Wahoo: \\"Paleface full of prunes!\\"), and of vigorous defenses of Native Americans (e.g., December 16, 1941). Wahoo was rich due to the discovery of oil on his land back in Te(e)pee Town (spelled both ways in the strip), and headed to New York City to find his girlfriend Minnie Ha-Cha, who had gone away to college and was now a beautiful singer in a nightclub. On the way, he was joined by Gusto, who liked Wahoo's medicine so much that he bottled it up for sale as Ka-Zowie Kure-All. Gusto continued as a support character through August 1939, and then was dropped. Other original characters included Pigtails (\\"44 pounds of dynamite wrapped in calico!\\") and Lulu Hipps (\\"The bee-utiful belle of the boarding-house\\"). (For more on Wahoo, see Elmer Woggon article; for a drawing of Wahoo, Gusto, and Minnie, see Woggon's biography card at the National Cartoonists Society.) The strip initially revolved around humorous tales, such as stories about people trying to cheat Wahoo out of his money or fish-out-of-water tales of Wahoo in New York or Hollywood. But from the beginning, it was a continuity strip, and had already moved into serious adventure by 1940, when a dashing young photojournalist named Steve Roper was introduced. (Sundays continued to do gags until rejoining the main plot line in 1944.) By World War II, Roper was the lead in war-oriented adventures, and the strip was retitled Chief Wahoo and Steve Roper in 1945, then Steve Roper and Wahoo in 1946, and in 1948 simply Steve Roper, as Wahoo and Minnie were written out (last seen on February 21 and November 19, 1947, respectively). As a very different kind of strip now, its artwork lost its earlier cartoonishness, ghosted by artists like Woggon's brother Bill Woggon, Don Dean, and (from December 1945 to July 1954) Pete Hoffman. But Woggon remained the strip's letterer and researcher until 1977, shortly before his death in 1978. 1946‚Äì70 After his World War II service in Navy intelligence, Roper got a job at Spotshot magazine (renamed Spotlight in 1950), and from then on the main action was set in New York City. As good with his fists as with his cameras and typewriter, he built a reputation as a racket-busting ace reporter and editor. The strip's popularity grew: after the March 1948 birth of a son to Roper's friends Sonny and Cupcake Brawnski, there was a national write-in of suggested names from readers. In 1951, Steve got engaged to his \\"boss lady,\\" Kit Karson, but when he was framed on a story in 1953 and broke jail, she abandoned him. (The experience left him a \\"confirmed bachelor.\\") Vindicating himself in a major crime ring bust, he was snapped up by the competition, crusty Major J. Calhoun McCoy at Tell magazine (soon renamed Proof). He continued exposing crimes and frauds, even on routine assignments like covering rock stars or beauty pageants, but his sense of moral outrage kept landing him in fiendish criminal traps (\\"deathtraps\\") that nearly finished him ‚Äî and some of the crooks he sent \\"up the river\\" to prison with his expos√©s came back for revenge. Meanwhile, on the domestic side, in 1953 he took in a Korean war orphan, So-Hi Chong, as his ward, intending to adopt him. But after 1958, So-Hi was not seen again in the strip, apparently going off to live with the Brawnskis. On July 12, 1954, the artwork was taken over by William Overgard, who on June 17, 1956 introduced a character whom he had tried unsuccessfully to feature in a strip of his own. Mike Nomad (born Nowak in Krak√≥w, Poland) had served in World War II as a U.S Marine commando. After working in oil fields, he looked up Roper to verify his Proof photo of a smuggler he thought he had killed. They solved the case together, and then Roper got him a job at Proof as a truck driver. In 1962, Nomad got his own room over the restaurant of Chinese wisdom-quoting Ma Jong, and she became a permanent member of the cast as his landlady.Mike Nomad at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on August 27, 2015. Another recurring character was Nomad's girlfriend, Tiger Towers. The two men were different: pipe-smoking Roper was a fast-thinking, stylish, college- educated \\"straight arrow,\\" the adopted son of a wealthy San Francisco family, while flat-topped Nomad was a tough, street-smart antihero, loyal to friends and family but not averse to deceiving, and often AWOL from work as he barged into risky situations without thinking them out. But as McCoy pointed out (1957), a \\"Nomad\\" was a \\"wanderer,\\" and Roper was likewise kept on the move by his career. Their friendship and interaction as men became a lasting theme of the strip. In the next 25 years, they alternated or joined forces in stories about people (especially the memorable women each attracted) whose problems often drove them to crime. The dual protagonists were recognized in April 1969 by the last name change, Steve Roper & Mike Nomad. For a drawing of Roper and Nomad ca. 1965, see Overgard's National Cartoonists Society biography card.National Cartoonists Society: William Overgard 1970‚Äì2004 In February 1970, Roper was promoted by McCoy to editor-in-chief at Consolidated Publications, Inc., though he continued to do investigative reporting. Then, in August 1976, after years of lecturing his pal to look before he leaped, he leaped for love in his late forties and married young reporter Trudy Hale. Meanwhile, Nomad, who remained footloose and single despite four close calls, was laid off from Proof and got new jobs, with new dangers, as a cab driver (1976) and then independent trucker (1981). In 1983, Roper lost his wife (traumatized in an explosion, committed to a mental hospital, and soon divorcing him), got fired for taking dangerous risks in an expos√© of political bribes, and then moved to Florida to make a new start as a TV news anchor. In 1979, Allen Saunders retired and gave the writing of Steve Roper and Mary Worth to his son John Saunders (not the Canadian-born sportscaster), a Toledo TV broadcaster who sometimes assisted him. There has been conflicting information on this transition. John (1986) said he had helped since 1949 and had done the \\"writing chores\\" since the early 1950s; and in its release on his death in 2003, King Features Syndicate (in turn cited by Markstein) said he had had \\"full responsibility\\" over Steve Roper since 1955. This claim is not supported in Allen's own candid discussions of \\"the strips that I write\\" (articles in 1953, 1971, and 1983-85 autobiography), and the scripting continued to show his unique writing style, characterization, and plotting until 1979. The strip itself first acknowledged John as assistant on December 25, 1976, and as the writer on October 28, 1979. As the obituary in his hometown newspaper (Toledo Blade, 2003) put it, \\"John Saunders began working on the strips (i.e., Steve Roper and Mary Worth) periodically during the 1950s, but took over in 1979.\\"Saunders, Allen. 1983-85 (13 installments). Autobiography: \\"Playwright for Paper Actors,\\" in Nemo, the Classic Comics Library, no. 4-7, 9, 10, 14, 18, 19. In early 1985 (his last strip was for April 7), Overgard left to focus on his own comic Rudy and other work, and the artwork was then taken over by Fran Matera. The strip was now focused on Nomad, who won a state lottery and was cajoled into a detective business with cop Francis Hogan (1989)‚Äîusually as a bodyguard-chauffeur with a penchant for stumbling into crime rings. Their main client (beginning December 1991) was a motel chain owner, the inimitable Emma Stopp. Nomad got engaged to social worker Meg Carey in a long, bumpy relationship that would break up in 2000. Meanwhile, finishing his broadcasting work with some freelancing, Roper retired in Florida and was kept out of sight for ten years. But in 1997 he returned: after brooding over his losses, he had gone to work on a newspaper, and was later fired (1998) for upholding truth over employee loyalty. Tired of the \\"prison of journalism,\\" he joined Nomad and Hogan in detective work, and by the end of the strip he had again become the leading character. John Saunders continued to write the strip until his death on November 15, 2003. Officially, Matera took over the writing until it was discontinued by the syndicate, although it was ghosted by Keith Brenner, J.S. Earls and Geoffrey Brenneman in the final years. In the strip's last days the dailies featured stories involving Mike, while the Sundays focused on Steve. It has been reported that the dailies of that period were combinations of reprinted and some new art, remaking older stories. One late story dealing with the widow and child of an Iraq-fighting Marine had been told during the 1980s, when the Marine had met his death in Lebanon. Analysis and conclusion Mike Nomad and Steve Roper on December 10, 2004, only days before the end of the strip (December 26, 2004). Aside from selected reprints in U.S. and foreign comic books, Steve Roper (under all its titles) stayed in the newspapers, where it had an especially strong appeal to male readers (Saunders, in Ridgeway interview). Particularly during its peak decades, it showed attractive photorealistic art and well-written stories with plot twists, suspense, danger, and touches of ironic wit and male \\"soap.\\" Allen Saunders was known for his \\"sophisticated scripts with literate dialogue\\" (Browne Popular Culture Library 2007); his Steve Roper characters referred to art, literature, and music and often spoke in other languages (he had been a French professor before becoming a journalist). The action was tense and fast-paced with four stories per year, until it slowed down drastically after the 1979 reduction from three or four daily panels to just two. By the 1990s, a single conversation easily took an entire month of dailies. This change was reversed in December 2003 by Matera, recapturing some of the strip's original narrative pace, but by then it had lost its earlier quality and almost 90% of its newspapers. Steve Roper explored human foibles and two men's responses to a variety of issues; and through the life story of Roper, it also showed two journalists' views (Allen and John Saunders) of changes in their profession over the course of the 20th Century. Roper and Nomad upheld a male code of honor in their work and personal lives, but unlike the idealized heroes of other adventure strips, they had well-developed, believable personalities with flaws, moods, and complex depths. They were good at what they did, but also miscalculated sometimes and dealt realistically with the consequences. Allen Saunders (1949 Brandenburg article) said his characters became \\"awfully real\\" to him, and in 1971 he quoted Milton Caniff as saying Nomad was \\"the most real character that ever appeared in a comic.\\" Also unlike story strips that always reset to the same status quo, Roper and Nomad developed through their successes, losses, and changes in life over the years, and they gradually aged‚Äîfrom a cocky, adventurous Roper at 22 to both men in their sixties, seasoned and ready for a change. They got one: an ending that fell back through past stories to return them to a key December 1986 talk of a voyage together, this time leading to a new outcome and retirement. The final strip (Sunday December 26, 2004) wordlessly showed Roper visiting his ex-wife's grave with a daughter whom she had borne in the hospital without telling him‚Äîand who was now likewise a journalist.

He is best remembered today for appearing in two classic Hollywood musical films with the popular dancing team of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers: The Gay Divorcee (1934) and Top Hat (1935). Early years The son of Mr. and Mrs. Ernest A. Sharpe, he was born at El Reno, Indian Territory, now Oklahoma, Rhodes attended Central High School and the University of Oklahoma. While he was a student at the university, he earned a scholarship that enabled him to spend a year in New York studying voice. During World War II, Rhodes was a language specialist in the intelligence service of the Army Air Force. Career Rhodes started performing on the Broadway stage in A Most Immoral Lady (1928) using his birth name, Ernest R. Sharpe. This was followed by two musicals, The Little Show (1929) and Hey Nonny Nonny! (1932). He first used the name Erik Rhodes when he appeared on Broadway in Gay Divorce (1932) and again in London in 1933. In this show, he gave a memorable comic portrayal of a spirited, feather-brained, thick-accented Italian character that impressed RKO executives enough to bring him to Hollywood to reprise the role in the film version, The Gay Divorcee (1934).The different spellings of Gay Divorce (Broadway play, 1932) and The Gay Divorcee (film, 1934) are not a typographic error. When the film was made, film censors objected to the description of a divorce as \\"gay\\" (in the traditional meaning of the word ‚Äì happy, cheerful). Hence, the title change. Between 1947 and 1964, he was back on Broadway in The Great Campaign, Dance Me a Song, Collector's Item, Shinbone Alley, Jamaica, How to Make a Man, and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. In the Cole Porter musical Can- Can, he appeared as a lecherous art critic, and introduced the song \\"Come Along With Me\\". In 1946, he was called in to take over a role in the Vernon Duke musical Sweet Bye and Bye during its tryout, but the show closed before reaching Broadway. Rhodes also acted in regional theater, including Playhouse on the Mall in Paramus, New Jersey, and the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia.

The Entercom outlet broadcasts at 93.1 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW. The station's studios are located near the Piedmont Triad International Airport, and a transmitter site is near Stokesdale, North Carolina. History The station's original calls were WAIR-FM (sister station and simulcast partner to current WPOL). The station was known as \\"Fresh Air 93\\". In the late-1960s the station began separate programming with religious during the day and beautiful music at night, with the call letters WGPL.Sid Bost, \\"New Radio Voice Coming Into Triad,\\" Twin City Sentinel, Feb. 14, 1976. In 1979, the station returned to a partial simulcast of a Top-40 format with WAIR, but the 93.1 station took on the calls WSEZ and the combination was collectively known as Z-93. In the 1980s WSEZ completely separated from WAIR, playing Top 40 and later album-oriented rock. In 1985, one-fourth of WAIR programming was a simulcast of WSEZ.Robin Adams, \\"Black- Oriented Radio Stations Make Gains,\\" Winston-Salem Chronicle, August 8, 1985. On March 6, 1987, the station became WMQX \\"93-Mix\\", an adult contemporary station playing hits of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s with \\"less talk, more variety\\".Bradley Johnson, \\"Aiming for an Audience,\\" Greensboro News & Record, July 20, 1987. The WMQX letters stayed during the station's entire tenure as an Oldies station, which began in 1990. The format change, along with a name change to Oldies 93-Point-Fun, boosted the station's popularity. Later the name changed to simply, Oldies 93.Leigh Preslley, \\"WMQX Changes Name, Attracts Listeners,\\" Greensboro News & Record, August 18, 1991. In 1997, a man named Kris Abrams became program director of the station & billed it as \\"The Triad's '60s Specialists\\". The station's slogan became \\"All Oldies, All The Time\\". Features on the station were \\"Waking Up with Jack Armstrong, \\"The All-request Lunch\\", and \\"The Top 5 at 5\\". DJs on the Station at this time were Jack Armstrong, Kris Abrams, Dave Solomon, Gary Ross and Max McGann. In January 1999, Kris Abrams left for Milwaukie to program Oldies 95.7 WZTR (now WRIT) and Solomon became program director. That's when the music started to change leaning to more 1970s music. The Station's slogan then became \\"Good Times & Great Oldies\\". A year later Solomon left to program Oldies 100.7 WTRG in Raleigh. Randle C. Bliss came in as program director about 4 months later in 2000. The station's slogan changed one last time to \\"Rock 'N Roll Favorites\\". Later Jack Armstrong left and Max Mcgann returned to do mornings. News Director, Ed Snow was gone and the traffic reporters, Lane Closure & Rhoda Block were removed as well. On October 3, 2006, the station began stunting with a \\"Wheel of Formats\\". The following day, WMQX flipped to country as \\"93.1 The Wolf\\". The move now gives the region three country outlets as they take on heritage rival WTQR and market fringe country stations WBRF and WAKG. As of the week ending November 25, 2006, WMQX officially changed its call letters to WPAW. The call letters were formerly assigned to 99.7 FM in Vero Beach, Florida which were in use from 1995, until March 5, 2001. The call letters WPAW also were assigned to WPAW-AM in the Syracuse, NY area during the late-1960s. The Syracuse station now has the call sign of WSIV and broadcasts on AM 1540. They currently air Black Gospel programming. The Rebirth of Oldies 93 In January 2007 WPAW signed on a hybrid analog/digital transmitter, allowing the radio station to transmit an HD2 signal, with an expanded, commercial-free version of then off-air Oldies 93 format. The Oldies 93HD runs an expanded playlist with no jocks. Listeners in the Triad can listen to Oldies 93HD if they purchase an HD Radio. The Oldies 93 HD plays more 1970s and 1980s music.

According to his friend, Ronald Martland, who succeeded him on the Supreme Court, Nolan did not have a good relationship with his father, possibly because of his father's struggles with alcohol. Martland said that Nolan \\"very seldom ever spoke of his father\\", who had not treated Nolan's mother well. Nolan was determined not to follow the path set by his father. Nolan's wife stated that Nolan's father had not had any sort of relationship with Nolan, and had not even answered Nolan's schoolboy letters.Dictionary of Canadian Biography: Nolan, Patrick James. Nolan received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alberta in 1914 and was awarded a Rhodes scholarship for Alberta in 1915. However, he enlisted in the army during World War I and received a Military Cross in 1918 for his service. He was wounded at Cambrai, in France. After the war, he received a second Bachelor of Arts in 1921 from University College, Oxford. He was called to the English and Alberta bars. He returned to Calgary to practice law, as an associate with the firm of Bennett, Hannah & Sanford, founded by Richard Bedford Bennett. In 1928, he married Doris Margery McCarter.

The game was released for Amiga, Amiga CD32, Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993 and February 1994, in Europe and North America, respectively. A Europe-exclusive remake of the game, entitled Alfred's Adventure, was developed by M√∂bius Entertainment and released by SCi for Game Boy Color in June 2000.http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/05/23/alfreds-adventure Another remake, named Alfred Chicken, was also developed by Monkey King, a division of M√∂bius Entertainment, and released by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation in 2002. Gameplay The player takes the role of a chicken named Alfred who must find his way through bizarre levels full of balloons, telephones, cheese, and other strange elements. While he is on the ground, Alfred can walk, jump, and peck balloons and ground switches. While he is in the air he can dive bomb enemies or springs. Dive bombing enemies will destroy them. Dive bombing springs will bounce Alfred much higher so he can reach platforms well above his normal jumping ability. If he does not hit an enemy or a spring, Alfred will get stuck in the ground for a short time. To complete a level, Alfred must find and peck all the balloons. The last balloon will take him to a boss fight. If Alfred dies, he starts as an egg located at the last balloon pecked. In Super Alfred Chicken for the Super Nintendo, finding the big balloon results in a Stage Clear. Alfred can receive a few power-ups during the game. For one power-up, he must answer a telephone in secret areas to make Mr. Pekles (a giant flower) give him a pot of jam. The jam gives Alfred the ability to shoot a bomb (about the size of Alfred himself) which bounces around the screen collecting items and hurting enemies. Another power-up is a worm that spins around Alfred destroying enemies that it touches. The player must find a can of worms to get this power-up. Release The Game Boy game was the original version. Two revisions exist; the monochrome original, and a Super Game Boy version with a level select feature; the latter was developed by Hookstone and released by Sunsoft in Japan. The NES edition of the game is essentially a watered-down port of the Game Boy version. It features only 5 levels, which were originally in the Game Boy game. The Amiga version is the same as the Game Boy game and is identical except for its color graphics and increased screen resolution. The game for the original PlayStation was released only in the PAL region. It features 2.5D action and is a brand-new game rather than a port. It was developed by M√∂bius Entertainment and released by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe in 2002. Marketing Karl Fitzhugh, the Product Manager of the Amiga version of the Alfred Chicken video game, ran as the Alfred Chicken Party candidate in the 1993 by-election in the Christchurch, Dorset constituency. The exercise was done to promote the original game's release. Fitzhugh finished second last with 18 votes, two votes ahead of the Rainbow Party candidate.British Parliamentary Election Results 1983-1997 The marketing attempt was partially successful. The Alfred Chicken Party was cited, along with other \\"frivolous or 'commercial' candidates\\", as a reason to increase the number of signatures required for an individual to be nominated as a political candidate at an election.Parliament.uk - Memorandum by the Director of Campaigns and Elections of the Liberal Democrats There was also a toll-free number set up after the US release, which could be called to hear Alfred himself give a promotional speech about the game. Reception Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Super NES version a 6.6 out of 10, calling it \\"a slow-moving game requiring more strategy than being able to run, jump and grab items! It takes a while to get into the swing of it, though.\\" They gave the NES version a 5 out of 10, explaining that it retains the large levels and good controls of the Super NES version, but that the drastically lower quality graphics and sounds make the game less enjoyable. Reviewing the NES version, GamePro praised the challenging gameplay, the \\"cartoony\\" graphics, the \\"bouncy, loopy audio\\", and the \\"crisp controls\\", and determined the game to be a must-have for NES fans in light of how few games were being released for the system at that point. On release, Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the Game Boy version of the game a 22 out of 40. In Nintendo Power, the NES version was scored a three out of five. While they did like the big sizes of each level and occasionally comical graphics, they ultimately found it to be just another typical platformer.

New Game Plus is also known as \\"replay mode\\", \\"remorting\\", \\"challenge mode\\", or \\"New Game Ex\\". The genre where they are most prevalent is role-playing video games. Origin The term was coined in the 1995 role-playing video game Chrono Trigger, but examples can be found in earlier games, such as Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei, The Legend of Zelda, Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Super Mario Bros.. This play mode is most often found in role-playing video games, where starting a New Game Plus will usually have the player characters start the new game with the statistics and/or equipment with which they ended the last game. Key items that are related to the story are normally removed so they cannot ruin the game's progression, and are given back to the player at the time they are needed; likewise, characters that the player acquires throughout the story will also not appear until their scheduled place and time, but will get the enhanced stats from the previous playthrough. Examples Games with multiple endings, such as Chrono Trigger, may feature a New Game Plus mode which allows the player to explore alternate endings. Many games increase the difficulty in a New Game Plus mode, such as those in the Mega Man Battle Network series and Borderlands series. Others use the feature to advance the plot. In Astro Boy: Omega Factor, the player uses the game's Stage Select mechanism, explained in-story as a form of time travel, to avert disaster, while in Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, the player defeats three different final bosses, one in each playthrough, to access the true ending. Some New Game Plus variations alter established gameplay. This includes unlocking new characters, such as in Castlevania: Lament of Innocence, new areas, such as in Parasite Eve, new items, such as in the Metal Gear series, and new challenges, such as in the .hack series. Games that connect to online marketplaces may require the player to complete a New Game Plus game to obtain certain achievements, such as the \\"Calamity Kid\\" achievement in the game Bastion. Others may require or be required by additional purchases in the form of downloadable content, such as in Assassin's Creed Origins. A slight variation of the New Game Plus is the clear game, also known as a \\"post-game scenario\\". The player may continue after the main story is completed, allowing them to see the effects of their choices upon the game world and narrative, and to complete any remaining side quests. EarthBound is an early case of the clear game, later used in major franchises such as Fallout, Pok√©mon, and Star Ocean.

Corona was born in 1970 in Tijuana, Mexico and raised in Ensenada. He was for a time a member of the Tijuana-based Nortec Collective of electronic musicians under the Terrestre project name. In 2000 he returned to Tijuana. Since 2006 Corona lives in Barcelona, Spain. Music Murcof's music is sparse, minimalist, electronica. Many of his compositions are founded on abstract, glitchy, sometimes complex electronic percussion. Harmonic and melodic influences come from classical music (modern classical music, musique concr√®te, holy minimalism, micropolyphony, baroque music, etc.), ambient music, drone music, berlin school synthesizer music, ethnic music and free improvisation. Rhythms are derived from minimal techno, dub, glitch, industrial music and IDM, and are often aligned around a 4/4 beat. The more recent works in the Murcof catalogue no longer include electronic beats. His earlier works, like the 2001 EP Monotonu, feature orchestral instruments sampled from recordings of works by modern composers such as Arvo P√§rt and Morton Feldman. Some of his later works, like the 2005 album Remembranza, incorporate samples of Corona and his friends playing classical instruments. Besides his personally initiated albums, Corona worked as Murcof on the 2008 commission project The Versailles Sessions, in which he reinterpreted recordings of a baroque ensemble. Live shows of Murcof featured guest musicians from varied musical backgrounds, like jazz trumpet player Erik Truffaz, tabla player Talvin Singh, crossover electronica-classical pianist Francesco Tristano and contemporary composer Philippe Petit. Biography and influences =Early youth (1970)= Murcof was born as Fernando Corona in 1970 in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. His earliest contact with music came from his home, where his father sang, played bass and accordion. Corona tried some of these instruments as his father bought a very cheap organ for him and his sister. He began to wonder how these sounds were made, becoming primarily interested in the sound design aspect of music. His father's record collection included Bach, The Beatles and The Carpenters. His mother listened more to traditional Mexican music. Corona was taught by his father to pay attention to the compositions and arrangements of both classical and pop music, which helped him to better understand what elements in music he liked or not. On his eight-year (1978) he moved to Chula Vista, close to the United States border. He went to school and learned English across the U.S. border, in San Diego. A few years later (around 1980) he moved 100 miles south, to a small port called Ensenada. At the age of eleven (1981) Corona was introduced to electronic music by a friend of his father's who gave him a tape of Jean Michel Jarre's Oxyg√®ne. Soon afterwards he got fascinated by electronic‚Äêclassical crossover through a present from his father, an album on which Jon Santos plays Bach on a classic Moog synthesizer. This resulted in him purchasing other electronic music from artist such as the Berlin School synthesizer gurus Tangerine Dream, Japanese electronica composer Isao Tomita and Mexican ethnic crossover (new age) composers Jorge Reyes and Antonio Zepada (link in Spanish). The US was Corona's \\"window to the world\\", as he had to cross the US border to obtain records and magazines. =First electronic instruments (1985)= Around his fifteenth Corona started to play music, taking piano and music theory lessons from 1985 to 1989. He bought his first keyboard in 1985, one out of the Casio Sample Keyboard series, which made him excited as he could use it to record and transform snippets of everyday sounds. For a while Corona enjoyed an alternative club in Tijuana, called Iguanas. There he developed a taste for mid 80s industrial (Play It Again Sam, Wax Trax! Records and Nettwerk labels, Skinny Puppy, Front 242, Front Line Assembly, KMFDM, and In The Nursery) and synthpop (e.g. Depeche Mode‚Äôs A Broken Frame (1982) and Black Celebration (1986)). Around 1988 Corona acquired some more sophisticated equipment. His first professional keyboard was a synthesizer, the Kawai K1. Corona was ‚Äúblown away‚Äù by the concept of designing his own sounds with oscillators and waveforms. He also began to program sounds on the Commodore 64. He started to write his own compositions influenced by techno pop (e.g. Kraftwerk), acid house and industrial. He continued in that style by forming the live act Vortex together with two of his friends. The group was active from 1988 to 1991. Besides electronic music Corona was also listening pre‚Äê1900 classical music during his whole teens. His uncle employed him as a warehouse manager around the mid 80s. In 1988 he started his study to become a computer programmer, but dropped out in 1990. By then he was focusing on DJing with his mobile DJ system and later as a resident DJ in a club in Ensenada. From 1992 to 2000 he worked in a nursing agency that dealt primarily with the elderly and terminally ill in San Diego (USA). =Prog-rock (1991)= In this period of time Corona played keys (and occasionally guitar, drums and flute) in the rock band Sonios, which was first influenced by British pop music like The Smiths, but later went into the direction of prog rock, jazz fusion, ambient and post rock. Corona states that this was a learning school for him about the various elements of music. He took influences from the local rock scene. The 1998 Sonios album ‚Äò200 Fonios‚Äô was released on Tijuana indie label Nimboestatic, won various prizes from cultural institutions in the Baja California region, was rated one of the best rock albums of 1998 by the Mexican press and reached a cult status in many places of Mexico and Latin America. =Electro-acoustic projects (1994)= Whilst in Sonios, Corona also engaged in other musical co‚Äêoperations like Elohim (1994‚Äê1995), an experimental multimedia group, and Arvoles (1995‚Äê1997), an acoustic‚Äêambient crossover project including a female vocalist. Then Corona got to compose for modern dance ensembles in Ensenada, an experience that led him to develop a taste for modern academic music, from the dodecaphonism and minimalism of the early 20th century to the experimentalists and serialists of the mid 1900s. Also, he grew tired of pre‚Äê1900 classical music having listened to it for all his teens and adolescence. Upon hearing Xenakis‚Äô Oresteia, plus later Pleiades and Metastasis, as well as Ligeti‚Äôs Lux Aeterna his perception of music altered immediately and drastically. Some of the other composers he became interested in where Igor Stravinsky, Wolfgang Rihm, Giya Kancheli, Arnold Schoenberg, Morton Feldman, Giacinto Scelsi, Sofia Gubaidulina, Alfred Schnittke, Luciano Berio, Krzysztof Penderecki, Stefano Scodanibbio (piece: Voyage That Never Ends). Corona took his electronic experiments in a more extreme direction, playing with feedback effects to create walls of noise. He began to digitally process samples of classical music and mix them up with doom metal, death metal, ambient and noise. Non‚Äêclassical music he listened in that time were for example Steve Roach‚Äôs dark ambient record The Magnificent Void (1996). As well as Squarepusher‚Äôs mix of jazz, D&B; and acid (IDM) on Hard Normal Daddy (1997). And the at that time freshly emerging glitch genre initiated by the Raster-Noton label (formed in 1990 by Alva Noto, Frank Bretschneider and Olaf Benders (byetone)). Also capturing Corona's attention were the ambient noise of Deathprod (active from 1994). And the Icelandic post‚Äêrock band Sigur R√≥s (active since 1997). Corona studied cello at the Centro de Estudios Musicales in Ensenada in the years 1993 and 1994. In 1995 and 1996 Corona had private lessons in audio engineering in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico. In 1998 and 1998 he studied audio engineering and music arrangement at Harper's Music, Chula Vista, California, USA. =Terrestre and Nortec (1999)= Early 1999 Corona leaves Sonios to fully focus on his solo electronic project Terrestre, for which his goal was to bring together the worlds of ambient electronica, pre‚ÄêHispanic music and other ethnic sounds. For this project Corona sampled from vinyl records in the styles of tambora (small bass drum music), danz√≥n (traditional Cuban dance music which also flourishes in Mexico) and salsa (the broad and internationally used term for popular Cuban dance music like Cuban son montuno, guaracha, chachach√°, mambo, bolero, etc.). In a later period of 1999 he gets an e‚Äêmail from three Tijuana based electronic musicians (Fusible, Bostich and Panoptica) inviting electronic musicians to work with some norte√±a and tambora tracks downloaded from a studio in Tijuana. This way he became a part of the team of electronic musicians, DJs and graphic artists who would soon develop the Nortec Collective. Nortec's objective is to blend traditional Mexican norte√±o‚Äêtex‚Äêmex border culture with electronic dance music and visual projections. It grew from being a local phenomenon to getting some worldwide recognition (e.g. by Time Magazine, NY Times). =Murcof - MF Relay / Martes / Monotonu (2001)= In 2001, during his Terrestre activities, Corona's Murcof project comes alive out of the need to explore modern classical territories, like the holy minimalism of Henryk G√≥recki and Arvo P√§rt and the post‚Äêmodern atmosphere of Valentyn Sylvestrov. In 2002, whilst experimenting with digital effects on samples of Arvo P√§rt and Morton Feldman he creates his first Murcof track: MF Relay, a track with glitchy minimal techno percussion, a synth drone and ‚Äúsliced and diced‚Äù samples from orchestral percussion, choir, piano, strings and woodwinds. Somewhere around here Corona started to listen to Deathprod‚Äôs electro‚Äêacoustic free improv (jazz) band Supersilent, particularly their releases 4 (1998) and in later times 6 (2003) and 7 (2005). He also took influences from Oren Ambarchi (a musician in the free improv and noise spectrum) and ambient/dub/electronica producer Biosphere. Martes, the first Murcof album, came out in the year Corona became a father. With this album Corona continued to work in the MF Relay style of minimal dance rhythms interwoven with samples from holy minimalism and other modern classical sources. Corona later stated that the composing wasn‚Äôt a hard job for him: \\"It almost composed itself\\". Corona left Nortec in 2002. He then teamed up with artists and personal friends Rub√©n Tamayo (Fax) and Eji Val (Ejival) from Nimboestatic (the label that released Sonios ‚Äê 200 Fonios) to create the Electronic label Static Discos, which in 2002 released Martes as a CD in Mexico. Corona was at Barcelona's S√≥nar Festival in 2001 to perform with the Nortec Collective when a friend of his insisted he would give his Murcof demo CD to Tony Marley of UK based independent record label The Leaf Label. So he went to meet Tony in a club and gave him the demo. This led to the worldwide vinyl and CD release of Martes, three months after its Mexican CD debut with Static Discos. The pioneering MF Relay track did not become a part of Martes, but was published, also in 2002, by Context Free Media (label by multidisciplinary artist Seth Joshua Horvitz) on the Monot√≥nu 12‚Äù. Martes received an almost instant universal praise from well known magazines like The Wire UK and consecutively Murcof got to play at festivals like Montreal's Mutek and the next edition of S√≥nar.The Static Discos Story  http://josemarquez.com/clients/epitonic/  Jos√© M√°rquez  January 2003 Martes was reissued by The Leaf Label in 2015 as part of the label's 20th anniversary celebrations. This was a special triple LP release combining the original album with unreleased tracks and the 2004 album Utopia.Leaf 20  http://www.theleaflabel.com/en/news/view/490/DM  The Leaf Label  October 2016 =Terrestre commissions (2002)= A friend of Corona's, Argentinian Latin‚Äêcrossover composer and multi-instrumentalist Gustavo Santaolalla, was involved in the production of Nuevo, an album of Mexican compositions performed by modern classical string ensemble Kronos Quartet. Santaolalla asked Nortec to get involved, resulting in Terrestre finding its spot on the 2002 Nortec remix EP of Kronos Quartet ‚Äê El Sinaloense. Corona also got commissioned to remix Miles Davis. Later Corona moved into the domain of film scores when he got commissioned as Terrestre to compose the soundtrack of the film Nicotina, a dark comedy by the producers of one of Mexico's biggest ever films, Amores Perros. The film was released in 2003 and the CD came out in 2004. Other commissions included music for a Heineken commercial focused on the Latin American market (USA, 2002), an Edwin Jeans commercial (JP, 2002) the documentary Iraq - Counting The Cost (UK, 2004), a trailer for the Edinburgh Film Festival (UK, 2004), Barratt Urban Development (USA, 2004), Valencia Biennale (2003). Mexican electronica netlabels Mandorla, Cyan Recs, Umor Rex and Soundsister caught Corona's around this time attention. =Murcof - Ulysses / Utop√≠a (2003)= In 2003 followed another Murcof release on The Leaf Label, the Ulysses EP. Corona's focus began to shift from sampling records to recording musicians, the violin and double bass on this record were recorded from Tijuana musicians, giving parts of the music a more live feel. Utop√≠a saw the daylight in 2004 when it was published as a CD by The Leaf Label. This album came to realization as a result of the success of Martes. It contained seven remixes and four new Murcof tracks. Corona has stated that it was exciting and inspiring for him to select people to remix his works. He also called Utop√≠a a self-indulgent record. On his four new tracks he experimented with placing the aesthetics of Martes into less conventional structures. Corona later claimed to be extremely proud of this record and to regularly relisten it. He sees Utop√≠a as an important transition from the Martes style into the style of his upcoming album Remembranza. The remixers were Sutekh (Californian multimedia artist Seth Joshua Horvitz (Sutekh) of Context Free Media), Jan Jelinek (German experimental minimalist who released on labels such as Berlin's ~scape), Deathprod (Norwegian ambient noise composer Helge Sten, who earlier produced Motorpsycho), Icarus (UK based experimental electronica duo Ollie Bown and Sam Britton), Fax (Ruben Alonso Tamayo, Mexican minimal techno producer and co‚Äêfounder of Static Discos), Aeroc (Geoff White, melodic IDM producer releasing on the renowned electronica label Ghostly International) and Colleen (the French C√©cile Schott, sample transforming and cello playing colleague from The Leaf Label). =Terrestre - Secondary Inspection (2004)= It took Corona from 1999 to 2004 to release his first full-length Terrestre record. Secondary Inspection became a creepy mix of electronic dance music, Latin percussion and ambient electronics. It contained processed sounds of Tijuana street musicians, which Corona \\"reduced to a pulp of post 9/11 paranoia\\". =Murcof - Remembranza (2005)= The second full-length Murcof album Remembranza came out in 2005 and helped Corona cope with the turmoil of his mother passing away. Remembranza was produced during her illness until her death and became a requiem for her. The Murcof aesthetic moved a bit away from minimalism towards more complex and melancholic harmonic progressions, slightly reminiscent of his prog-rock past. Recordings of his friends or himself playing classical instruments played a significant role on this album. Corona stated that he could hardly play them, but that did not bother him too much as he was mainly interested in texture and vibe. In 2005 Native Instruments released the sample pack Synthetic Drums 2 for use with their software drum instrument Battery or software sampler Kontakt. It included samples by Speedy J, Jake Mandell, Plaid, Telefon Tel Aviv, Atom Heart, Murcof and other artists. =Live with Singh, Truffaz and Tristano (2006)= A trio with Talvin Singh on tabla and Erik Truffaz was formed in this year. Both of these artists had a firm background in acoustic‚Äêelectronic crossover. The trio played sporadically in the following years, at for example Montreux Jazz 2006 and in Mumbai in 2010. Corona got to master the album Not For Piano by Luxembourg crossover electronic‚Äêclassical pianist/synthesist Francesco Tristano. In 2007 Corona and Tristano started the Not For Piano live duo, which for example toured the UK in 2010. =Murcof - Cosmos (2007)= In 2007 Corona released the third Murcof album Cosmos. It was a spacious dark ambient record which included dense walls of textures (hinting at Ligeti), abstracted sounds of synth pioneers, intense climaxes and on some tracks glitchy dub and techno beats. Corona stated that it expressed some personal changes in his life, including his move from Ensenada to Barcelona in 2006. Before moving to Europe, Corona sold his hardware instruments, including a Roland Juno‚Äê106 and Moog Prodigy. Corona described the album as follows: ‚ÄúCosmos is a celebration of our existence, of the universe: we must see beyond the skyscrapers around us, look above, look the star and the sky.‚Äù =Murcof - The Versailles Sessions (2008)= In the summer of 2007 Corona got invited by Les Grandes Eaux Nocturnes (an annual festival of sound, light and water at Ch√¢teau de Versailles in France) to compose a 6 speaker composition for the grand evening fountain display in the Jardin du Roi. The Versaille Sessions is an aural document of that installation. GetSound, who commissioned the project, hired a Parisian group of musicians specialized in baroque music. Murcof and the musicians resided in the GetSound studio in Paris for two days to record the musicians‚Äô interpretations of compositions from the baroque time, from for example Jean-Baptiste Lully, Henry Purcell and Fran√ßois Couperin. The pieces were played traditionally as well as with note and instrument experimentation. They experimented with modifying the score, tempo, pitch and by inserting random pauses. Texturally they explored the instruments by throwing all sorts of material inside the harpsichord and pounding on the viola da gamba's body, capturing a wide range of timbres, giving Corona many composing options. Corona stated it was a great learning experience for him thanks to the musicians‚Äô open mindedness and fun approach. Corona described the composition process as partially different from the usual Murcof composition method. He was processing previously recorded acoustic material as usual, but this time the source material was very specific 17th century baroque and the experiments in the studio were already a part of the composing process. Two weeks before the opening Corona went to the site wanting to get an impression of the sound, but could not make the necessary tests due to pouring rain. He did realize though that he was going in the wrong musical direction. He thought the big space demanded a different sound: more openness, more time for the sounds to develop and resonate. So in the remaining two weeks he reworked the whole commission into The Versailles Sessions. =Projects with AntiVJ (2008)= Early 2008 Corona was commissioned by the Contemporary Music Network of England to create the live audio-visual Oc√©ano show for a UK tour. \\"Blackout Arts\\" member Flicker (Roderick Maclachlan) created visuals live on stage by using camera feeds from micro-installations of dust, smoke, plants, dark water and live scratch animations. He used feedback effects to manipulate the video and his visuals responded to the music. Live instrumentation was served by Spanish classical ensemble BCN 216 and consisted of cello, viola and trombone. June 2008 Corona played a space themed audio-video show in The Planetarium of Bristol, during the Venn Festival. Visuals were improvised by Joanie Lemercier of visual arts label AntiVJ. =Infographic overview of Corona's music making history= Infographic of Corona's musical history.

According to Liuwe Tamminga, Niehoff was born in Leeuwarden, the capital of Province Friesland. (Tamminga has been organist since the 1980s on the ancient organ {1471-75} of Lorenzo da Prato at the Basilica of San Petronio in Bologna and also was born in a nearby Friesland village.) Following Jan van Covelen's death in 1532, Hendrik Niehoff established his shop in 's-Hertogenbosch to continue building new and upgrading organs throughout the Netherlands and in major Hanseatic cities and, thus, can be considered the most significant organbuilder in northwestern Europe in the middle third of the 16th century due both to the fabulous visual architectural quality of the cases and the exquisite sounds these instruments make for the eye and ear. The pipes in Niehoff's organs are remarkable in that they use an alloy of over 98% lead, with only about 1.3% tin and minimal amounts of antimony, copper and bismuth - the latter probably due to the not highly refined ores available to the builders of that time. (The use of lead plate to make organ pipes probably stems from its use to fabricate the roofs of European churches of the time.) Pipes made of this alloy are noted for producing sounds with the \\"vocale\\" characteristic of the organs of the high Renaissance/early Baroque period. To enhance their appearance, the fa√ßade pipes usually were covered with thin, bright tin foil that was held to the underlying lead pipe with a glue made of duck egg white. American organbuilder John Brombaugh (b. 1937, retired 2005) used several surviving examples of pipes from the 1539 Schoonhoven Niehoff organ given to him in 1971 by Dr. Maarten A. Vente as models for many instruments his firm made after their first new examples were made and used in the organ at Central Lutheran Church, Eugene, Oregon, that was dedicated in 1976. (Respected Belgian organologist, Koos van der Linde, disputes Vente's assertion that Niehoff made Brombaugh's sample Dutch pipes; he contends they were made by the hand of Peter Janz. de Swart, who built the Leiden Hoogslandskerk organ ca. 1565. Could de Swart have been an apprentice with Niehoff when the Schoonhoven pipes were being made?) This instrument also uses vertical pallets in its Ruckpositive windchest, a method that was normal in Niehoff's organs but seldom found anytime since. It gives a remarkable light touch to the keys - like a harpsichord. Major Niehoff projects - BOLD entried organs still extant in 2006 Painting, c. 1850 by J. Bosboom: Organ in Delft, Oude Kerk * 1534 Breda - Groote / OLV (Onze Lieve Vrouwe - Our Lady's) Kerk. The positive case on the current organ survives from 1534; information on the 1534 case is taken from a book about the organs in this church which was published in 1989. Jan van Biezen states this organ was built by Jan Graurock; whether or not Niehoff helped is debatable. * 1528 Franeker - St.-Maarten. Van Biezen and Vente say this instrument was a Jan van Covelen project but, upon his death in 1532 and at the request of van Covelen's widow, Niehoff brought it to completion in 1534. This project is likely the beginning of Hendrik Niehoff's career as an independent organbuilder. * 1539-1540 Schoonhoven - St.-Bartholome√ºs. The case of this organ since 1958 houses the Marcussen organ located in the south transept of the Groote / Laurenskerk in Rotterdam. (Dr. Vente recovered the case when the Schoonhoven congregation abandoned this historic organ in the 1930s to purchase a new organ. He gave it to the war desecrated Rotterdam congregation to use in its new replacement organ as the demolished church was being restored.) * 1539-1545 Amsterdam - St.-Nicolaas / Oude Kerk.

Some pipes of that organ are still extant in the new organ that Hans Wolf Schonat built ca. 1658 and Ahrend & Brunzema restored in 1964-65. * 1545-1549 Zierikzee - St.-Lievensmonster.

Niehoff's organ case remains, but the organ was rebuilt by the van Hagerbeer and Duyschot families ca. 1645 and 1679-83. Some of its pipes are still extant in the organ at the St.-Pancras / Zuiderkerk church in Enkhuizen. ::Go here for further information on the church. * 1548-1550 Hamburg - an upgrading rebuild of the existing organ at the Petrikirche. Following the terrible Hamburg fire of 1842, nothing remains of this organ. * 1551-1553 L√ºneburg - Johanniskirche, built together with Jasper Johansen. In 1699, Georg B√∂hm became organist here and, beginning soon after (according to Christoph Wolff) gave Johann Sebastian Bach lessons on this instrument during Bach's student tenure at the Michaeliskirche from 1700 through 1702. B√∂hm had the Niehoff organ considerably rebuilt and upgraded in 1714 by Arp Schnitger's student, Matthias Dropa. It has been restored on several occasions by Rudolf von Beckerath's shop (Hamburg); it probably has the most of Niehoff's work remaining in any of his large organs. ::Go here for further history of the L√ºneburg Johanniskirche organ * before 1553 Schiedam - St.-Jan The center case and some pipes from Niehoff are still extant in a new instrument the Flentrop firm built in 1975 and upgraded in 1994. * 1555 Bergen op Zoom - St.-Geertruida Kerk * 1556-1558 Gouda - St.-Jans Kerk The drastically altered remnants of this organ's case were placed in the 19th century Roman Catholic parish church in Abcoude. * 1557 Brouwershaven - St.-Nicolaas , built together with his son, Nicolaas Niehoff.

It provides wireless services to 10 million subscribers in the United States. Cricket Wireless was founded in March 1999 by Leap Wireless International. AT&T; acquired Leap Wireless International in March 2014 which merged Cricket Wireless with Aio Wireless. History Typical Cricket retail store in Thomasville, Georgia Former Cricket Wireless logo, before acquisition by AT&T; Cricket Wireless was founded in March 1999 by Leap Wireless International. AT&T; acquired Leap Wireless International in March 2014 and merged Cricket Wireless with Aio Wireless. Before AT&T;'s acquisition, the company had 4.5 million subscribers. Cricket's first market was Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1999 and through much of its early growth became known as a network focused on small, rural markets. In September 2007, MetroPCS, Cricket Wireless's competing carrier at the time, announced a $5.3 billion bid to merge with Leap Wireless. Leap informally rejected the bid less than two weeks later. MetroPCS officially withdrew the bid less than two months later. In December 2007, Cricket acquired Hargray Communications Group's wireless telecommunications business. In September 2008, Cricket and MetroPCS entered into a 10-year roaming agreement covering both companies' existing and future markets. The companies also entered into a spectrum exchange agreement covering licenses in certain markets. In November 2008, they launched \\"Premium Extended Coverage\\", a roaming partnership with 14 wireless companies. In August 2010, Cricket and Sprint signed a five-year wholesale agreement (MVNO) which allowed Cricket to utilize Sprint's nationwide 3G EVDO network in the United States. In July 2013, AT&T; agreed to buy Cricket Wireless' parent for $1.2 billion. The FCC approved the acquisition between AT&T; and Leap Wireless in March 2014. Cricket Wireless, alongside AT&T;, shut down their 2G networks on December 31, 2016. Customers were required to upgrade their devices to use on newer networks. Cricket Wireless deployed its 5G network nationwide on August 21, 2020. Coverage network Prior to its acquisition by AT&T;, Cricket's CDMA network used its home network and roaming agreements with Sprint, among other CDMA carriers. However, Cricket's CDMA network was shut down and the spectrum was reframed for use on AT&T;'s HSPA+ and LTE networks. Following the acquisition by AT&T;, Cricket Wireless released devices that use AT&T;'s 3G, 4G, and 4G LTE networks. Cricket Wireless noted on their old website that CDMA service would be terminated as early as September 2015. Most devices prior to the merger would not be compatible on the GSM network except the iPhone 4s, iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, and iPhone 5s. Compatible iPhone devices would only require a new SIM card. Controversies =STARTTLS stripping attack= In October 2014, Cricket Wireless (and its parent company, AT&T; Inc.) came under scrutiny for intercepting and modifying its customers' email traffic to downgrade and prevent encryption of the conversation and its metadata. An engineer at a digital security and privacy firm, Golden Frog, first noticed the issue in September 2013 via their Aio Wireless connection (later acquired by Cricket). Upon further investigation by the privacy firm in June 2014, Golden Frog determined that Cricket masked the STARTTLS command in email server responses, thereby \\"putting its customers at serious risk by inhibiting their ability to protect online communications.\\" In October, a Washington Post investigation revealed that \\"Cricket did not address repeated questions about the issue and did not alert customers, many of whom rely on Cricket as their sole Internet service, that they would not be able to protect their e-mails from prying eyes. AT&T;, which absorbed Cricket when it acquired Leap Wireless that spring, did not respond to a request for comment.\\" The EFF also published a technical analysis condemning ISPs like Cricket from tampering with customer internet traffic.{{cite web date=2014-11-11 url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/starttls-downgrade-attacks title=ISPs Removing Their Customers' Email Encryption website=Electronic Frontier Foundation last=Hoffman-Andrews See also * AT&T; Mobility, another subsidiary of AT&T; * AT&T; PREPAID, AT&T; Mobility's prepaid service References External links Cricket Newsroom * Official Instagram site Telecommunications companies established in 1999 Retail companies established in 1999 American companies established in 1999 AT&T; subsidiaries Mobile phone companies of the United States Mobile virtual network operators Companies based in Atlanta 1999 establishments in Illinois 2014 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Cricket Wireless"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:N}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const B=d(P,[["render",I]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/8.md","filePath":"drive/8.md"}'),H={name:"drive/8.md"},D=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{L as __pageData,D as default};
