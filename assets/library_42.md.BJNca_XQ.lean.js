Early life and career Dobbs was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, where his mother had been sent because of political and religious unrest. He was the eldest son of Richard Dobbs of Carrickfergus, County Antrim, who was soon to become Sheriff of Antrim in 1694 and Mary Stewart from Ballintoy. The first English ancestor to settle Carrickfergus was John Dobbs (Arthur‚Äôs great-great grandfather), an officer who had arrived in 1596 with Sir Henry Dockwra. In 1599 John Dobbs built a home known as Castle Dobbs. He married Margaret Dalway and had two sons. He was a neighbour and family friend of Jonathan Swift despite their political differences. He served briefly in a dragoon regiment in the Irish Army, and afterward managed his family estate. Dobbs became an engineer and Surveyor-General of Ireland, supervising the construction of the Irish Parliament House in Dublin, as well as other Irish public buildings. He was appointed High Sheriff of Antrim in 1720, and in 1727, was elected Member of Parliament for Carrickfergus, a seat he held until 1760. Whilst a member of the Irish Parliament, Dobbs purchased 400,000 acres (1,600 km2) in North Carolina in 1745 and encouraged settlement in the colony, especially by Scots Irish. Following the death of North Carolina governor Gabriel Johnston, Dobbs was confirmed to succeed him on 25 January 1753. However, he did not arrive to assume his duties until October of the following year. Governor of North Carolina While Governor of North Carolina, Dobbs sought unsuccessfully to establish a permanent capital, to be called George City, near Tower Hill and the Neuse River. Plans were drawn up for a Palladian governor's mansion similar to Tryon Palace, which Dobbs' successor, William Tryon, would erect 10 years later in New Bern. Dobbs' governorship was overshadowed by the French and Indian War and the start of the American Revolution. Shortly after his arrival, Dobbs visited the western frontiers of North Carolina, organised the construction of Fort Dobbs, and attempted to raise troops to fight in the French and Indian War. Dobbs moved to Brunswick Town, North Carolina in 1758 where he lived for the rest of his life. In 1759, and 1760, Governor and Assembly were often at odds. Debt, Indian affairs, public complaints about Lord Granville's agents and about Dobbs' failure to put down riots in Edgecombe County and elsewhere, and Dobbs' frequent vetoes of Assembly bills led to intense tensions. Dobbs even dissolved the Assembly in 1760 and ordered new elections, but this plan backfired; a secret committee drew up outlandish charges against the governor to be sent to the King. Only the succession of King George III, which brought additional powers to Dobbs, saved him from further conflict with the Assembly. Other interests Discovery of the Venus flytrap In 1759, the North Carolina colonial governor, Arthur Dobbs, recorded the first written description of the plant. \\"We have a kind of Catch Fly Sensitive which closes upon anything that touches it. It grows in Latitude 34 but not in 35. I will try to save the seed here.\\" In a letter he wrote to botanist Peter Collinson, Dobbs went into greater detail about the plant dated Brunswick, 24 January 1760. This seems to be the earliest notice of the plant and is before the letters from John Ellis (who gave it the name Dion√¶a muscipula) to The St James‚Äôs Chronicle, a London newspaper and Carl Linnaeus on the subject.Directions for Bringing over Seeds and Plants, from the East Indies and Other Distant Countries, in a State of Vegetation: Together with a Catalogue of Such Foreign Plants as Are Worthy of Being Encouraged in Our American Colonies, for the Purposes of Medicine, Agriculture, and Commerce. To Which is Added, the Figure and Botanical Description of a New Sensitive Plant, Called Dion√¶a muscipula: or, Venus's Fly-trap - (London, printed and sold by L. Davis, 1770). Northwest Passage Apart from his North Carolina interests, Dobbs was heavily involved in attempts to find a Northwest Passage in the Canadian Arctic during the 1740s. He actively worked to have the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company‚Äôs trade monopoly revoked on the grounds that they showed little or no interest in promoting discovery expeditions relating to the Northwest Passage. Dobbs felt that others might finance exploration if they had some expectation of trade. Revoking the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company‚Äôs trade monopoly was his solution for stimulating exploration. From 1741 to 1747, Dobbs managed to stimulate exploration, the result of which convinced most people that such a passage did not exist. A British Parliamentary inquiry in 1749 ended attempts to revoke the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company‚Äôs charter. Dobbs' involvement in the Canadian Arctic exploration resulted in a substantial increase in geographical knowledge as well as increased awareness of the economic potential. Dobbs was also an amateur scientist and published several astronomy articles as well as a pamphlet on honeybees. Personal life He had married in 1720 Anne, daughter and heir of Captain Osborne of Timahoe, County Kildare and the widow of Captain Norbury. They had three sons and a daughter. Google Books In 1762, Dobbs, then seventy-three, married fifteen- year-old Justina Davis at St. Philip's Church, Brunswick Town in Brunswick. A few months later he suffered a stroke and was bound to a wheelchair. In the fall of 1763 he attended a conference of Southern governors and Indian tribes in Augusta, Georgia, which resulted in the Treaty of Augusta. In 1764 Dobbs look a leave of absence to return to England, and Tryon arrived as lieutenant- governor to fill his place. Dobbs later decided to retire and return to Ireland, but while packing, suffered a fatal seizure on 28 March 1765, just two weeks before he was to depart. He was buried at St. Philip's. Today no sign of his grave remains. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Conway Richard Dobbs.

If one works with CW complexes, one can reformulate this condition: an aspherical CW complex is a CW complex whose universal cover is contractible. Indeed, contractibility of a universal cover is the same, by Whitehead's theorem, as asphericality of it. And it is an application of the exact sequence of a fibration that higher homotopy groups of a space and its universal cover are same. (By the same argument, if E is a path-connected space and p\\\\colon E \\\\to B is any covering map, then E is aspherical if and only if B is aspherical.) Each aspherical space X is, by definition, an Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space of type K(G,1), where G = \\\\pi_1(X) is the fundamental group of X. Also directly from the definition, an aspherical space is a classifying space for its fundamental group (considered to be a topological group when endowed with the discrete topology). Examples * Using the second of above definitions we easily see that all orientable compact surfaces of genus greater than 0 are aspherical (as they have either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic plane as a universal cover). * It follows that all non-orientable surfaces, except the real projective plane, are aspherical as well, as they can be covered by an orientable surface of genus 1 or higher. * Similarly, a product of any number of circles is aspherical. As is any complete, Riemannian flat manifold. * Any hyperbolic 3-manifold is, by definition, covered by the hyperbolic 3-space H3, hence aspherical. As is any n-manifold whose universal covering space is hyperbolic n-space Hn. * Let X = G/K be a Riemannian symmetric space of negative type, and Œì be a lattice in G that acts freely on X. Then the locally symmetric space \\\\Gamma\\\\backslash G/K is aspherical. * The Bruhat‚ÄìTits building of a simple algebraic group over a field with a discrete valuation is aspherical. * The complement of a knot in S3 is aspherical, by the sphere theorem * Metric spaces with nonpositive curvature in the sense of Aleksandr D. Aleksandrov (locally CAT(0) spaces) are aspherical. In the case of Riemannian manifolds, this follows from the Cartan‚ÄìHadamard theorem, which has been generalized to geodesic metric spaces by Mikhail Gromov and Werner Ballmann. This class of aspherical spaces subsumes all the previously given examples. * Any nilmanifold is aspherical. Symplectically aspherical manifolds In the context of symplectic manifolds, the meaning of \\"aspherical\\" is a little bit different. Specifically, we say that a symplectic manifold (M,œâ) is symplectically aspherical if and only if :\\\\int_{S^2}f^*\\\\omega=\\\\langle c_1(TM),f_*[S^2]\\\\rangle=0 for every continuous mapping :f\\\\colon S^2 \\\\to M, where c_1(TM) denotes the first Chern class of an almost complex structure which is compatible with œâ. By Stokes' theorem, we see that symplectic manifolds which are aspherical are also symplectically aspherical manifolds. However, there do exist symplectically aspherical manifolds which are not aspherical spaces.Robert E. Gompf, Symplectically aspherical manifolds with nontrivial œÄ2, Math. Res.

There are over 100 species in this genus, and all but two are native to the south west region of Western Australia. A significant number of the species accumulate monofluoroacetate (the key ingredient of the poison known commonly as 1080), which caused introduced/non native animal deaths from the 1840s in Western Australia. The controversy over the cause of the stock poisoning in that time involved the botanist James Drummond in a series of tests to ascertain the cause of the poisoning, which was determined to be caused primarily by the plants York Road poison (G. calycinum) and Champion Bay poison (G. oxylobioides). In the 1930s and 1940s C.A. Gardner and H.W. Bennetts identified other species in Western Australia, leading to the publication of The Toxic Plants of Western Australia in 1956.

From the Mamma Haidara Commemorative Library, Timbuktu. A manuscript page from Timbuktu showing a table of astronomical information Timbuktu Manuscripts (or Tombouctou Manuscripts) is a blanket term for the large number of historically important manuscripts that have been preserved for centuries in private households in Timbuktu, Mali. The collections include manuscripts about art, medicine, philosophy, and science, as well as copies of the Quran. The number of manuscripts in the collections has been estimated as high as 700,000. The manuscripts are written in Arabic and local languages like Songhay and Tamasheq. The dates of the manuscripts range between the late 13th and the early 20th centuries (i.e., from the Islamisation of the Mali Empire until the decline of traditional education in French Sudan). Their subject matter ranges from scholarly works to short letters. Early scribes translated works of numerous well-known individuals (such as Plato, Hippocrates, and Avicenna) as well as reproduced a \\"twenty-eight volume Arabic language dictionary called The Mukham, written by an Andalusian scholar in the mid-eleventh century.\\" Original books from Timbuktu have been written by local scientists, historians, philosophers, and versemakers. Legal experts in the city gathered numerous amounts of scholarship about Islamic jurisprudence, or fikh, as well as obligatory alms, or zakat. Astronomers studied the movement of stars and relation to seasons, crafting charts of the heavens and precise diagrams of orbits of the other planets based on complex mathematical calculations; they even documented a meteor shower in 1593‚Äî\\"‚ÄúIn the year 991 in God‚Äôs month of Rajab the Godly, after half the night had passed stars flew around as if fire had been kindled in the whole sky‚Äîeast, west, north and south...It became a nightly flame lighting up the earth, and people were extremely disturbed. It continued until after dawn.‚Äù Physicians documented instructions on nutrition and therapeutic properties of desert plants, and ethicists debated matters such as \\"polygamy, moneylending, and slavery.\\" \\"There were catalogues of spells and incantations; astrology; fortune-telling; black magic; necromancy, or communication with the dead by summoning their spirits to discover hidden knowledge; geomancy, or divining markings on the ground made from tossed rocks, dirt, or sand; hydromancy, reading the future from the ripples made from a stone cast into a pool of water; and other occult subjects...\\" A volume titled Advising Men on Sexual Engagement with Their Women acted as a guide on aphrodasiacs and infertility remedies, as well as offering advice on \\"winning back\\" their wives. \\"At a time when women‚Äôs sexuality was barely acknowledged in the West, the manuscript, a kind of Baedeker to orgasm, offered tips for maximizing sexual pleasure on both sides.\\" The manuscripts were passed down in Timbuktu families and were mostly in poor condition.\\"Towards an omnilingual word retrieval system for ancient manuscripts\\". Pattern Recognition Volume 42, Issue 9, September 2009, Pages 2089‚Äì2105. Most of the manuscripts remain unstudied and uncatalogued, and their total number is unknown, affording only rough estimates. A selection of about 160 manuscripts from the Mamma Haidara Library in Timbuktu and the Ahmed Baba collection were digitized by the Tombouctou Manuscripts Project in the 2000s. Beginning in 2013, the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library (HMML) at Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota, partnered with SAVAMA-DCI for a large-scale digitization effort that has photographed more than 150,000 manuscripts. This effort has been supported by the Arcadia Fund. These are being made available through HMML's online Reading Room. In 2017, HMML and the British Library's Endangered Archives Programme launched the Endangered Libraries in Timbuktu (ELIT) project to digitize manuscripts that remained in Timbuktu with the three principal mosques. With the demise of Arabic education in Mali under French colonial rule, appreciation for the medieval manuscripts declined in Timbuktu, and many were being sold off. Time magazine related the account of an imam who picked up four of them for $50 each. In October 2008 one of the households was flooded, destroying 700 manuscripts. Research Digitizing ancient documents at the Ahmed Baba Institute of Higher Learning and Islamic Research, 2007 In 1970, UNESCO founded an organization which included among its tasks preservation of the manuscripts, but it went unfunded until 1977. In 1998, Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates visited Timbuktu for his PBS series Wonders of the African World. The series raised public and academic awareness of the manuscripts, which led to a pool of funding opening up. The Timbuktu Manuscripts Project was a project of the University of Oslo running from 1999 - 2007, the goal of which was to assist in physically preserving the manuscripts, digitize them and building an electronic catalogue, and making them accessible for research. It was funded by the government of Luxembourg along with the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), the Ford Foundation, the Norwegian Council for Higher Education's Programme for Development Research and Education (NUFU), and the United States' Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation. Among the results of the project are: reviving the ancient art of bookbinding and training a solid number of local specialists; devising and setting up an electronic database to catalogue the manuscripts held at the Institut des Hautes √âtudes et de Recherche Islamique ‚Äì Ahmad Baba (IHERI-AB); digitizing a large number of manuscripts held at the IHERIAB; facilitating scholarly and technical exchange with manuscript experts in Morocco and other countries;Les Chemins du Savoir / MasƒÅlik al-Ma ørifa: Manuscrits de Tombouctou: patrimoine partag√© / al-turƒÅth al-mushtarak min khilƒÅl makh·π≠≈´·π≠ƒÅt Tinbukt≈´.

Since the end of this project, the cooperation of Grand-Duch√© de Luxembourg has funded a new project called Timbuktu Manuscripts. This project aims at protecting and promoting Timbuktu Manuscripts, for economic, social and cultural development of the area. It is implemented by the Lux-Development agency and the goals are: #a better conservation of the manuscripts (100 listed manuscripts, 10 described manuscripts, 2 digitalized manuscripts, 10 restored and protected manuscripts) #a better scientific utilisation of the manuscripts #use of manuscripts to promote economic, social and cultural development of the area Since the events in the North of Mali in 2012, the project MLI/015 works with its main partners in Bamako on result 1. These key partners are the IHERI-AB (Institut des Hautes Etudes et de Recherche Islamique Ahmed Baba) and the SAVAMA DCI (Association de Sauvegarde et de Mise en Valeur des Manuscrits et de D√©fense de la Culture Islamique). Beginning of 2013, they had completed an important work of describing 10,000 manuscripts through standardized registration forms. The Timbuktu Manuscripts Project is a separate project run by the University of Cape Town. In a partnership with the government of South Africa, which contributed to the Timbuktu trust fund, this project is the first official cultural project of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. It was founded in 2003 and is ongoing. They released a report on the project in 2008. As well as preserving the manuscripts, the Cape Town project also aims to make access to public and private libraries around Timbuktu more widely available. The project's online database is accessible to researchers only. In 2015 it was announced that the Timbuktu trust fund would close after receiving no more funds from the South African government. A book about Timbuktu, published in 2008, contains a chapter with some discussions of a few of the texts. Digital images of thirty-two manuscripts from the private Mamma Ha√Ødara Library are available from the United States Library of Congress; a subset of these are also accessible from the United Nations' World Digital Library website. The Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures (CSMC) at the University of Hamburg has supported conservation and inventorying efforts at SAVAMA-DCI since 2013, coordinated with HMML's digitization efforts. HMML is now leading a major cataloging project based on the CSMC's initial metadata, supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Journalistic coverage A movie about the Timbuktu Manuscript Project, The Ancient Astronomers of Timbuktu, was released in 2009 with funding from the Ford Foundation and Oppenheimer Memorial Trust. The French/German cultural TV channel ARTE produced a feature- length film about Timbuktu's manuscript heritage in 2009 entitled Tombouctou: les manuscrits sauv√©s des sables Timbuktus verschollenes Erbe: vom Sande verweht.directed by Lutz Gregor / Gruppe 5. The full film can be viewed online: Part 1 Part 2 Part 3. Another film on the subject entitled \\"Manuscripts of Timbuktu\\" was also released in 2009. The film was made by South African director Zola Maseko, executive produced by the South African Broadcasting Corporation and distributed by California Newsreel. In 2013 BBC Four has produced a documentary called \\"The Lost Libraries of Timbuktu.\\" Although unavailable at BBC, the movie is available at others online video platforms, as \\"Youtube\\" In 2016 a book about the manuscripts and the efforts to save them in the midst of the assault and occupation of northern Mali by Islamists jihadis was published. The book, The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu by Joshua Hammer, provides vivid details about the collection of the manuscripts into libraries, and subsequent efforts to remove them to safety during the dangerous conflict, in which the Islamist jihadis threatened to destroy them. In 2017 Charlie English published The Storied City: The Quest for Timbuktu and the Fantastic Mission to Save Its Past which tells in alternating chapters the history of European expeditions (1795 ‚Äì 1860) in search of the mystical city and the Herculean rescue efforts undertaken by Haidara and others to save the manuscripts from destruction by the jihadis (2012). [33] Destruction and evacuation of manuscripts Empty manuscript boxes at IHERI-AB, Timbuktu Many of the manuscripts were reported destroyed in January 2013, along with many other monuments of medieval Islamic culture in Timbuktu, by the Islamist rebels of Ansar Dine in the Northern Mali conflict. The Ahmed Baba Institute and a library, both containing thousands of manuscripts, were said to have been burnt as the Islamists retreated from Timbuktu. Journalists, however, found that at least one of the libraries was largely undamaged, and that only a few small piles of ash were present, suggesting that at least some of the documents survived. Aboubacry Moussa Lam was a signatory to an appeal to preserve the Timbuktu Manuscripts. A former Malian presidential aide, as well as several other people involved with preserving the manuscripts, said that the documents had been evacuated into a safe location in 2012 before the fighters invaded Timbuktu. U.S. based book preservation expert Stephanie Diakit√© and Dr. Abdel Kader Haidara, curator of one of the most important libraries of Timbuktu, a position handed down in his family for generations, organized the evacuation of the manuscripts to Bamako in the south of Mali. Timbuktu has a long tradition of celebrating and honoring family manuscript collections. It is traditional for a family member to ‚Äúswear publicly that he will protect the library for as long as he lives.‚Äù Yochi Dreazen, ‚ÄúThe Brazen Bibliophiles of Timbuktu: How a Team of Sneaky Librarians Duped Al Qaeda and Saved Some of the Ancient World‚Äôs Greatest Artifacts,‚Äù The New Republic (April 2013), 34. During the evacuation process, Haidara relied on local families to hide the Ahmed Baba Institute's manuscript collection in their homes before the texts were ultimately transported to Bamako. The evacuation was supported by international organizations, such as the Prince Claus Fund for Culture and Development, whose initial commitment was followed by financial support from other organisations such as the Doen Foundation and Ford Foundation. Abdel Kader thanked SAVAMA-DCI and their partners in a letter for enabling the evacuation of the manuscripts to the cities in the south of the country and supporting their storage. Manuscripts of the Ahmed Baba Centre However, once in the south the manuscripts faced new dangers: mold and humidity. Stephanie Diakit√© and Dr. Abdel Kader Haidara began a campaign to raise money for the preservation of the books including a crowd-funding campaign called \\"Timbuktu Libraries in Exile,\\" which is currently hosted by the crowdfunding site T160K.org. Whereas many institutions have provided funding, equipment and/or training, the leading role in all the proceedings is played by the local people.

He formerly played for Guyana from 1993 to 1995. He made his Canadian debut on 2 October 2003 playing against the Windward Islands. He made his ODI debut for Canada on 16 May 2006 against Zimbabwe, and has played 44 ODIs in his long career. He has also played for Canada in seven ICC Intercontinental Cup games, and represented them in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Guyana From 1993-1995, Dhaniram represented his home country of Guyana in a few of the prime years of West Indian Cricket. During that time, he played 12 first class matches for Guyana, and scored 270 runs in that period, including a high score of 57 against Leeward Islands in 1994. . His last match representing Guyana was against Barbados in 1995. Dhaniram made painful scores of 4 and 2 in that match. He was never really a bowler for Guyana, like he regularly did with Canada, but he did roll his arm over for 5 overs, which went for 16 runs in his time with Guyana. An interesting fact was that, in that time, Shivnarine Chanderpaul was a regular bowler for Guyana, and the West Indies as well. International career Early years Dhaniram migrated to Canada, and in 2003, he was picked as an all-rounder for Canada. He made his debut in a List A match against Windward Islands, and he troubled the Windward Islands batsmen throughout his spell, as only runs 15 runs came off his 10 overs while he also picked up 3 wickets. He came in at No.4 to bat and made 18 runs, before Darren Sammy took his wicket. Dhaniram was dismissed for a two-ball duck on his first-class debut for Canada - against USA - but recovered to record 65* in the second innings. In the next few years, Sunil kept producing consistent results, including picking up a 5-for against Cayman Islands, and scoring a 141* against UAE. 2007 World Cup Dhaniram was a part of the squad that Canada sent to the West Indies to participate in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Canada didn't win any matches, but it wasn't a bad tournament for them, and Dhaniram. In Canada's first match, Sunil made 34*, and bowled 9 overs for 34 runs, while also picking up the wicket of Kenya's wicketkeeper. The second match against England was probably one of the highlights of his career. Dhaniram bowled all 10 overs of his spell for 41 runs while also picking up 3 wickets. That includes the price wicket of Kevin Pietersen, definitely a wicket that will always leave a happy memory in his head. He also made 30 runs with the bat to complete an excellent all-round effort. The last match in that World Cup for Canada was against New Zealand. His bowling effort was forgettable as the New Zealand batsmen smacked him around for 72 runs in his 8 overs. In his batting innings, he was going good on 17, when a delivery from Jacob Oram struck him hard on his hand and forced him to retire hurt. It was a successful tournament for Dhaniram as he made 81 runs in 3 matches, and picked up 4 wickets at an economy rate of 5.44. Captaincy & late career Sunil was named captain for Canada's Intercontinental Cup matches against Kenya and Namibia in October 2007, when Ashish Bagai was ruled out because of work commitments. Canada lost both of those matches. However, Dhaniram put out great performances with both bat and ball in those two matches, which includes a 78 against Kenya. In 2008, Dhaniram captained Canada in the famous 2008 Quadrangular Twenty20 tournament, in which big guns Sri Lanka and Pakistan came to Canada to play in a 4-team tournament that also included Zimbabwe. Canada put up a fight, but they didn't win any matches, and Dhaniram had a couple of decent performances with bat- and-ball. Sunil enjoyed a prolific year, in general with the ball in 2008, picking up his third five-wicket haul for Canada in a limited-overs match against Bermuda and picking up 26 wickets across all formats. He remained a consistent allround performer for Canada, despite his age, and in 2009 was one of six players to receive central contracts. Dhaniram achieved his best score of 144 against a tough opposition in Netherlands, at age 39. That match ended in a draw. A year later, Dhaniram made a 130 against Afghanistan, in a match which Canada went on to lose. The way he was performing, it didn't seem like he would retire that same year. However, at age 41, Sunil played his last match for Canada against Ireland in August 2010, and had scores of 17 and 6, while also called upon from captain, and long time teammate Ashish Bagai to bowl an over in the 2nd innings that went for 4 runs. That turned out to be the end of a prolific career as he announced his retirement after that match. Sunil Dhaniram is the world's oldest cricketer to pick up his maiden fifer in ODI history at the age of 39 years and 256 days for Canada. Post- Retirement Sunil Dhaniram now represents Our Own SC in the Ontario Masters Softball Cricket League. In the 2014 edition, while representing Guyana Sports Club, he scored an incredible 499 runs in 8 matches which includes a 146. Family Dhaniram's brother, Sudesh, who formerly played for Guyana just like his brother, joined Sunil in immigrating as well, but he migrated to USA, a team that he played for himself and they actually faced off against each other in a couple of matches.

The name was also applied to the Marcher lordship which controlled the area in the period between the Norman conquest and the formation of Monmouthshire under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535‚Äì1542. Origins of the name The name--which was spelled in various alternative forms, including Estrighoiel and Strigoiel in the Domesday Book--probably derives from the Welsh word ystraigyl meaning 'a bend in the river'. An alternative suggestion is that it derives from Welsh words ystre, meaning boundary or dyke, and gwyl, meaning watch or guard; a combined word ystregwyl could mean \\"well-guarded border (or dyke)\\", perhaps referring to the location's proximity to the southern end of Offa's Dyke. Frank Olding, Editor's Note: Striguil, Gwent Local History no.79, 1995, p.1 In the medieval period the town which grew up between the port, the castle, and the priory church became known as Chepstow, from the old English or Saxon ceap / chepe stowe meaning market place.Rick Turner and Andy Johnson (eds.), Chepstow Castle - its history and buildings, 2006, The castle and lordship retained the name Striguil until about the 14th century, when they adopted the English name of the town. The lordship was also known, in some medieval documents, as Netherwent, that is the lower (southern) part of the former Welsh Kingdom of Gwent. The Lordship of Striguil ::See also Chepstow and Chepstow Castle The Marcher lordship of Striguil was established by William fitz Osbern, who started the building of the castle at Chepstow. On his death in 1071 the lordship passed to his son, Roger de Breteuil, but he plotted against King William, was captured and imprisoned, and had his estates forfeited. The lordship then reverted to the English crown until about 1115, when it was granted to Walter fitz Richard de Clare, the son of Richard fitz Gilbert. It remained with the de Clare family, including Richard de Clare known as \\"Strongbow\\", before passing to William Marshal on his marriage to Richard's daughter Isabel in 1189. It then passed in turn to Marshal's sons, the last of whom, Anselm, died without issue in 1245. The Lordship of Striguil was then divided into several parts, with Chepstow and Netherwent being allotted to Marshal's grandson, Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, and the castles at Trellech and Usk, and their surrounding areas, forming new lordships under other members of the family. The area of the lordship extended east of the River Wye to take in the manors of Tidenham, Woolaston, Beachley and Lancaut, which became part of Gloucestershire in 1535 under the Laws in Wales Act. Cas Troggy As a result of confusion over references in Camden's Britannia, some early maps, such as those by Morden, wrongly used the name Striguil, or similar names such as Strogli, to refer to the small castle known as Cas Troggy in the parish of Newchurch. This was built by Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk around 1303 but was abandoned a few years later. It is located on the northern slopes of Wentwood some 12 km west of Chepstow at Pen y cae-mawr, beside the old road between Chepstow and Usk.

Photographed at Gembrook in 2006. The former Victorian Railways, the state railway authority in Victoria, Australia, built a number of experimental narrow-gauge lines around the beginning of the 20th century. Although all were closed by the early 1960s, parts of two have been reopened as heritage railways.  Background  A depression in the early 1890s brought a halt to the rapid expansion of railways in Victoria. Politicians promoted narrow-gauge lines as a way to link remote communities, particularly in hilly country, without the expense of the railways. Railways officials opposed them, citing the inconvenience and expense of a break-of-gauge. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways examined 14 regions for potential railways: # Bass River District: Without recommending a specific route, the Committee considered a narrow gauge line through the Bass River district to exploit timber resources along the river, coal deposits around Kilcunda and farming around \\"Wonthaggie\\", eventually recommending examination a low cost broad gauge option. Instead the Wonthaggi railway line was built as broad gauge in 1910. # Beech Forest District: From Colac to Beech Forest. # Carrajung District: From Traralgon to Alberton via Carrajung. # Gembrook District: From Fern Tree Gully to Gembrook. # Gunbower and Cohuna District: From Rochester or Elmore to Gunbower or Cohuna. Instead the Cohuna railway line was built as broad gauge in 1915. # King River District: From Wangaratta to Whitfield. # McDonald's Track District: From Nyora or Monomeith to Thorpdale. The broad gauge Strzelecki railway line partly covered this district in 1922. # Mitta Mitta River District: From Tallangatta to Eskdale. # Moondarra and Walhalla District: From Moe to Walhalla. # Orbost and Snowy River District: An isolated line from Cunninghame to Orbost as an alternative to proposed extension of the broad gauge Gippsland line from Bairnsdale to Orbost via Bruthen. Instead the broad gauge line was extended to Orbost in 1916. # Poowong East District: From Drouin or Warragul to Korumburra via Poowong. # Tolmie District: The Committee stated that the suggested line to Whitfield must, at some future time, be extended to Tolmie and Mansfield. # Upper Murray District: Tallangatta to Cudgwea and Towong, or from Bethangra to Walwa. Instead the broad gauge railway from Tallangatta was extended to Cudgewa between 1916 and 1921. # Wandin and Warburton District: From Croydon to Warburton. In considering the McDonald's Track and Poowong East Districts together, the Committee also examined shorter routes from the existing Thorpdale railway line and Mirboo North railway line to Leongatha. The Committee recommended that four experimental lines be built. They were: * Croydon to Warburton * Wangaratta to Whitfield * Upper Ferntree Gully to Gembrook * Colac to Beech Forest The Warburton line was built in broad gauge, however authority was given for the construction of the other three lines. Subsequently, a further two lines were built, the Moe to Walhalla line, and an extension from Beech Forest to Crowes. Initial plans were for the railways to be constructed in gauge, but following correspondence with British railway engineer Everard Calthrop, amongst others, a change was made to gauge.http://www.lrrsa.org.au/govt_ng.htm None of the lines constructed ever made a profit. Freight rates were the same for broad and narrow-gauge railways, despite higher direct costs. Most of the loadings were goods such as timber, potatoes and lime, which were charged at a low rate. Most freight was outbound, so many trains travelled towards the terminals almost empty. And despite originating the traffic, the lines were only credited with a portion of the freight charge. The amount credited to the lines did not cover the cost of running trains, and the more traffic the larger the loss. However, particularly in the 1920s, the traffic generated by the narrow-gauge lines was appreciated by the railways and the lines survived for up to 60 years before closure.  Right of way and safeworking Embankment on the Colac ‚Äì Beech Forest line A number of studies were made of overseas narrow-gauge railways such as the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in India and the Ffestiniog railway in Wales. An initial decision to build the lines in gauge was changed to gauge for the Victorian lines. This gauge was being adopted on other lines in the British Empire at this time, such as the Kalka-Shimla Railway and the Sierra Leone Government Railway. The railways were constructed using rail, initially obtained from broad-gauge lines that were being upgraded. A maximum grade of 1 in 30 (3.33%) was adopted, while the minimum radius of curves was 2 chains i.e. . Apart from a couple of experiments with other systems, all lines were operated by the Staff and Ticket method of safeworking, as was standard Victorian Railways practice for this system.  Locomotives and rolling stock  Restored Garratt G42 on the Puffing Billy Railway Seventeen 2-6-2 tank locomotives and two Garratt locomotives, plus a range of passenger and goods vehicles, were built to operate on the narrow-gauge lines. Six of the locomotives, including one of the Garratt locomotives, as well as at least one example of each type of rolling stock, have been restored to working order on the Puffing Billy Railway. Apart from light maintenance that could be done locally, the locomotives and rolling stock were maintained at the Victorian Railways' Newport Workshops in the suburbs of Melbourne, requiring the transport of the vehicles by broad-gauge flat wagons. The locomotives and other vehicles would be moved around the various narrow-gauge lines as appropriate, so that no equipment was dedicated to particular lines. However the G class Garratts were only used on the Crowes and Walhalla lines, while the NBH excursion coaches remained on the Gembrook line while that line was in operation.  Parameters  The trains were all fitted with Westinghouse air brakes and, originally, with chopper couplers. In the mid-1920s the couplers were replaced with small MCB,MCB or \\"knuckle\\" couplers.  Locomotives  Belgrave on the Puffing Billy Railway. Baldwin Locomotive Works in the United States supplied the first two 2-6-2 tank locomotives, as well as parts for a further two locos. One each of the supplied locos and the parts kits was a simple loco, and the other a compound. The new class was classed \\"A\\", however confusion with the broad-gauge A, AA and A2 classes lead to them being referred to as narrow- gauge A class for a short while followed by a prefix \\"N\\" being applied to written records, making it the NA class. The Victorian Railways Newport Workshops assembled the parts to give an additional two locos, and subsequently built a further 13 of the simple cylinder version. The last one, number 17, was built in 1915. The locomotives weigh and produce a tractive effort of , allowing them to haul loads of up grades of 1 in 30 (3.33%). Nos. 6, 7, 8, 12, and 14 have been restored and operate on the Puffing Billy Railway, and No. 3 is also on the Puffing Billy Railway, awaiting eventual restoration. The remaining locomotives have all been scrapped. By the mid-1920s, traffic was growing with up to 7 trains a day on the Beech Forest line. To decrease train mileage and therefore costs, two G class Garratt locomotives were purchased from Beyer-Peacock in England. Weighing 69 tons (70.1 t), these 2-6-0+0-6-2 locomotives produce a tractive effort of , making them among the most powerful steam locomotives ever built for gauge. They were designated as the \\"G\\" class and given the numbers 41 and 42, and entered service in 1926. G41 spent its entire life on the Crowes line, whilst G42 was originally allocated to the Walhalla line, then transferred to the Crowes line, and is currently running on the Puffing Billy Railway. G41 was scrapped, after having been extensively cannibalised for parts to keep G42 running in the last years of the Crowes line.  Rolling stock  1NB, the first passenger carriage used on the Victorian narrow gauge, preserved on the Puffing Billy railway and restored to 1910 condition A range of passenger and goods vehicles were also built at Newport or by contractors. While most Victorian Railways broad-gauge goods vehicles of the time were 4 wheel trucks, all the narrow-gauge rolling stock were bogie vehicles and most were built on a standard underframe. The initial stock were all built on a long underframe, with the carriages being the open saloon type with balconies for end loading. Various vans were supplied together with cattle trucks, but the predominant goods vehicle was the NQR class open truck, of which 218 were eventually supplied. Later some side opening carriages were built to cope with increasing traffic. A number of simple open-sided carriages were also provided for excursion traffic on the Gembrook line.  Lines   Wangaratta to Whitfield  The first line, from Wangaratta to Whitfield, was unlike the other lines in that it was built through mostly flat, open, agricultural country, following the King River. The line was built as a narrow-gauge line because it was thought that it might be extended into the mountainous country to the south, but this extension never happened. The line was opened in March 1899, and was the first line to close, in October 1953. The line relied mostly on local agricultural traffic, and opened with a daily mixed train. By the 1930s this had been reduced to a weekly goods service, and stayed at this level until the railway closed. There was only one lineside industry, a dairy at Moyhu, and the majority of stations were nameboards at road crossings.  List of stations  *Wangaratta (Junction station with broad gauge.) *Targoora *Laceby *Oxley *Skehan *Docker *Byrne *Moyhu *Angleside *Claremont *Dwyer *Edi *Hyem *King Valley *Jarrott *Pieper *Whitfield  Upper Ferntree Gully to Gembrook  The Monbulk Creek trestle bridge remains a feature of the Gembrook line The Gembrook line, running through the southern foothills of the Dandenong Ranges, just east of Melbourne, opened on 18 December 1900. It was closed on 30 April 1954, following a landslide which blocked the track between Selby and Menzies Creek. However, the Puffing Billy Preservation Society was formed in 1955 and, with the co-operation of the Victorian Railways, began to operate tourist services over the remaining usable section of the line between Upper Ferntree Gully and Belgrave stations. Those services came to an end in 1958 when the line was closed to allow conversion of the track to a broad-gauge electric line, as an extension of the suburban railway system of Melbourne. Through the efforts of the Puffing Billy Preservation Society, the landslide was bypassed, and the remainder of the narrow-gauge line from Belgrave to Gembrook was progressively restored, with trains on the line operating daily for tourists. The railway is now administered by the Emerald Tourist Railway Board. The Gembrook line always had a much higher passenger loading than the other narrow-gauge lines. The break-of-gauge station of Upper Ferntree Gully was a terminus for Melbourne suburban electric trains, so the line was popular with day-trippers and weekend visitors from Melbourne. Fifteen special excursion carriages, classed NBH, were built to cater for the tourist traffic. Travelling through a region with rich soils and high rainfall, agricultural products such as potatoes formed much of the freight traffic. Over the years, Nobelius Nurseries dispatched thousands of fruit trees from a packing shed located on the company's own siding between Emerald and Nobelius stations. Sawn timber was also an important item of freight, and sidings were located at Gembrook to serve several private and gauge tramways that brought the timber down from the surrounding hills.

The line from Colac to Beech Forest opened in March 1902, and it was extended to Crowes in June 1911. Nearly long, this was the longest of the narrow-gauge lines. It was also the last to close, finally succumbing in June 1962, although the line had been truncated in 1954. Both the Colac and Crowes lines entered Beech Forest yard from the same end, creating a junction. Trains had to be turned to run down the Crowes branch and a balloon loop was provided at the other end of the yard. A tennis court occupied the land within the loop. Crowes, the terminus of the line, was the most southerly railway station on the Australian mainland. The primary traffic was sawn timber and firewood, with many sawmills located adjacent to the railway, or accessed by short tramways. Seasonally heavy potato traffic and a lime kiln added to revenue. Traffic grew to require up to 7 trains a day each way by the mid-1920s. The introduction of the Garratt locomotive allowed a new timetable with two trains each way between Colac and Beech Forest, and a third train each way to Gellibrand. The Crowes branch saw a single mixed train daily. The arrival of the Great Depression and competition from motor vehicles saw traffic decline to a point where only one train each way operated over the line three days a week. Increased wartime loadings saw traffic increase to two trains each way daily, however this improvement was only temporary. By the time the railway closed, the timetable listed only one train each way a week, and most of the traffic was pulpwood. The line opened using the Staff and Ticket method of safeworking. However Train Section Orders were adopted between 1927 and 1939, after which Staff and Ticket working was resumed.

Walhalla had a history of gold mining dating back to the 1870s, and was one of the largest towns in Gippsland. Local residents had long lobbied for a railway, as all goods had to be brought in by bullock cart over rough terrain. However, the gold mine in Walhalla closed in 1914, and the town quickly fell into steep decline. It was reputed that the major source of traffic from Walhalla were the houses of residents leaving the town. The line did pick up significant traffic from sawmills in the area, some of which had their own sidings. A connection was made with the Tyers Valley Tramway at Collins siding, between Watson and Erica. While the tramway used the same gauge as the railway, there was no physical connection, timber being transhipped by hand. A temporary connection had to be put in place to move locomotives to and from the tramway. A small copper mine and two lime kilns near Platina provided additional traffic. A series of \\"Back to Walhalla\\" days in the 1930s caused the railways to put on special passenger trains for these occasions, and such was the demand some were double-headed. The line was truncated to Platina in 1944 then to Erica in 1952, before finally closing in 1954. The section of the line from Thomson to Walhalla has been rebuilt and now operates as the Walhalla Goldfields Railway.

This line, also known as the Welshpool Jetty line, was opened in 1905 and closed in 1941.

It owned the Sam's Warehouse and Crazy Clark's brands, operating 143 stores. It is owned by Australian-New Zealand businesswoman Jan Cameron. It was announced on 1 July 2014 that the chain has entered receivership for the fourth time in 8 years. History Australian Discount Retail was formed in 2005 after the sale of the discount division of Miller's Retail (now known as Specialty Fashion Group) and the sale of The Warehouse Australia by The Warehouse Group New Zealand to private equity firms Catalyst and CHAMP. Catalyst and CHAMP reportedly paid A$200 million which was funded by NAB Capital, ANZ and BOS International. The combined entity was Australia's leading discount variety retailer with revenues nearing $1 billion and a store presence in every state and territory in the country. The company traded under the household names Go-Lo /Crazy Clark's (275 stores), Chickenfeed (39 stores), and Sam's Warehouse (99 stores). In 2008 the company rebranded all The Warehouse stores as Sam's Warehouse as a condition of sale from The Warehouse New Zealand. The main competitors of Australian Discount Retail included Kmart, Homeart and The Reject Shop. On 20 January 2009 the Board of Australian Discount Retail has placed the company in voluntary administration. Staff were assured their entitlements are safe, but the future of their employment would not be known for months as a buyer was sought for the business. The size and scale of ADR makes this the biggest retail collapse Australian business in over five years. On 23 March 2009 it was announced that the company had been sold to Retail Adventures Pty Ltd, a company owned by Australian millionaire Jan Cameron, the former owner of Kathmandu, for an undisclosed sum. The sale guaranteed the 2,500 permanent and 7,500 casual jobs under ADR. On 27 October 2012, Retail Adventures Pty Ltd was placed into administration. Owner Jan Cameron was granted license to operate the viable section of the business. 950 staff were expected to lose their jobs, while 5000 full-time staff at 238 stores were to remain. The only brands that survived were Crazy Clark's and Sam's Warehouse; Chickenfeed shut down its stores across Tasmania and Victoria, with the remaining 6 stores sold to The Reject Shop in May 2013. In March 2013, Jan Cameron purchased the remaining viable sections of the business from the administrators for $59 million AUD following extensive restructing, forming a new company DSG Holdings Australia Pty Ltd which traded under the name the Discount Superstores Group. Project Simplify Project Simplify was a long- term strategic plan initiated by Jan Cameron and David Young since the acquisition of ADR in 2009. Young and his colleagues believed that the business was too complicated, and were planning a number of changes to be carried out by 2013. Stocking strategy Retail Adventures focuses on the Pareto principle, rather than strategies like sales per square meter and department performance. David Young explains \\"That core range is built on the 80-20 principle: 20 percent of our range will give us 80 percent of our business.\\" In this way, the company focuses on their core merchandise range and seasonal demand is what drives the rest of the business platform. This in turn means that the specific stock will vary around the country, due to each individual store's ability to be flexible in promotion, planning and stock display. Chickenfeed brand Each of the four subsidiaries of Retail Adventures entered the acquisition with individual strategies and slogans. Retail Adventures had plans to merge all of their counterparts into Chickenfeed, with the slogan \\"Bargains with a Smile\\". Chickenfeed retailers on average outperformed all the other markets owned by Retail Adventures by at least 30% per square meter. Chickenfeed utilized catalog advertising approximately 25% less than its counterparts, and used television advertisements as their main marketing venture, working with 4‚Äì5 different product commercials. The success seen from these community strategies that Chickenfeed had utilized is what Retail Adventures planned to use for each of its brands. However, considering the company is now in administration (see Retail Adventures#Administration), the company will instead be rebranding all Chickenfeed stores as Crazy Clark's. Employee retention The retail industry generally suffers from a high staff turnover rate. As part of \\"Project Simplify\\", Retail Adventures is beginning to offer training, development programs and potential career development to its employees. Employment opportunities which open up within the company are usually notified to the current staff through emails and company bulletins to encourage them to move up while staying within the company. Supply chain As part of \\"Project Simplify\\", Retail Adventures plans to utilize its unused physical space. The company is looking to either add 150 Chickenfeed stores to the brand, or become a third-party logistics provider. Retail Adventures takes advantage of parallel importing as a way to help keep overall costs down because of the lack of trading complexities. Whilst maintaining currently buying techniques, the company is in the process of upgrading its technologies to better manage aspects such as allocation, forecasting and replenishment of its merchandise. Administration In October 2012, it was announced the company was going into voluntary administration and that most Go-Lo and Chickenfeed will be rebranded as Crazy Clark's. Earlier in October, news outlets had reported that Retail Adventures owed landlords thousands of dollars in unpaid rent.http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2012/10/19/364123_tasmania-news.html The move to administration was not unexpected - in late 2012 Retail Adventures had begun closing several stores across Tasmania, Queensland and Victoria, including almost 20 Chickenfeed stores. Some of these closures were forced, after Chickenfeed stores in Launceston and Hobart were reclaimed by landlords because of unpaid rent.http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2012/10/20/364225_tasmania-news.html However, prior to rebranding occurring, it was announced that all Tasmanian Chickenfeed stores would close. The administrators allowed Discount Superstores Holdings Pty Ltd to enter into a license agreement to run the majority of the stores until an agreement between the administrators, the business and its creditors finalised the debt that Retail Adventures owed. Discount Superstores Group, ran by Jan Cameron, purchased the entire remaining assets of Crazy Clark's and Sam's Warehouse for $59 million AUD in February 2013. In July 2014, it was announced Discount Superstores Group had also collapsed, entering receivership.The end of the line for Jan Cameron‚Äôs Retail Adventures 11 August 2014 See also *Big W *Homeart *Target Australia References External links * Retail Adventures Corporate Website * Australian Discount Retail Corporate Website Category:Department stores of Australia Category:Defunct retail companies of Australia Category:Australian companies established in 2013 Category:Retail companies established in 2013 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2014 Category:Discount stores of Australia Category:Companies based in Sydney Category:Australian companies disestablished in 2014 ","title":"Discount Superstores Group"},{"id":"7147505","text":"Juli√£o Mateus Paulo is an Angolan politician and former Secretary-General of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).

Roskov√°nyi was succeeded by Anthony Peitler, 1859‚Äì85, who founded the library at V√°c. In 1900 Count Charles Cs√°ky became bishop. In 1514, when the Ottoman Turks conquered V√°c, the cathedral chapter ceased to exist, but was re-established in 1700. In the early 20th century, the diocese included parts of the counties of N√≥gr√°d, Pest, Csongr√°d and J√°sz- Nagykun-Szolnok, divided into three archdeaconries and nineteen vice- archdeaconries. Within the diocese were five titular abbeys, four provostships and six titular provostships. The chapter had twelve canons and six titular canons.

He was the first Chief Minister of Jharkhand and current Leader of the Opposition in the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly. Giant-killer will be Jharkhand CM He was the founder and national President of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik). He was the Member of Parliament in 12th, 13th 14th and 15th Lokasabha from Jharkhand. He was the Union State Minister (MoS) for Forests & Environment of India in the BJP - led National Democratic Alliance Government in 1998 to 2000.  Early life  Babulal was born in a remote Kodia Bandh village under Tisri block of Giridih district of the now Jharkhand province. He belongs to Santal family. After passing high school, he moved to Giridih College from where he did his intermediate and graduation. It was there that he came in contact with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Later, he moved to Ranchi where he did his post-graduation in Geography from Ranchi University. He worked as a teacher in a village primary school for a year before giving up the job to work for the Sangh Parivar. He served as the organising secretary of the Jharkhand region of Vishva Hindu Parishad. In 1983, he moved to Dumka and worked in the Santhal Pargana division, which he toured extensively. Where he come close to Bishnu Prasad Bhaiya, his the then companion and there he used to spent some time at his Jamtara's Residence but mainly he used to live in the RSS office in Dumka. And after that his journey to Ranchi and then Delhi begins. Political career In 1991, the Bharatiya Janata Party gave him the ticket to contest from the Dumka (Lok Sabha constituency), but he lost. In 1996, he lost to Shibu Soren by just 5,000 odd votes. The BJP, in the meantime, made him president of the party's Jharkhand unit. It was under Marandi's leadership that the party won 12 out of 14 Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand region in the 1998 election. Marandi, a Santal, led the tally by defeating Jharkhand Mukti Morcha supremo Shibu Soren, another Santhal. The victory gave an immense boost to Marandi's profile and he was included in the Union Council of Ministers, one of four ministers from Bihar. First NDA rule of Jharkhand After bifurcation of Bihar in 2000 in states of Bihar and Jharkhand, NDA came to power in Jharkhand with Marandi as the 1st Chief Minister of Jharkhand. Political analysts believe that this government initiated many developmental schemes in the state, the most visible being, improvement of the road network in the state. He also put forward the idea to develop Greater Ranchi to reduce the crowding in the city. However, Marandi's tenure proved rather short-lived, as he had to resign and make way for Arjun Munda for the post in 2003 following pressure exerted by coalition allies primarily Janta Dal United. Thereafter, he increasing moved away from political mainstage of Jharkhand irrespective of NDA being in power in Ranchi. In the 2004 Lok Sabha Elections, he contested from Kodarma (Lok Sabha constituency) as a BJP candidate. He won the seat while all the other sitting MPs of NDA from Jharkhand including union ministers Yashwant Sinha and Reeta Verma lost their respective seats. His differences with the state leadership continued to increase and he even started criticising the state government in public. Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) Marandi resigned from both Kodarma (Lok Sabha constituency) seat and the primary membership of Bharatiya Janata Party in 2006 and floated a new political outfit named Jharkhand Vikas Morcha. He was followed by 5 MLAs of Bharatiya Janata Party. In the subsequent by- elections for the Kodarma (Lok Sabha constituency) seat, he contested as an independent candidate and emerged victorious. Marandi, who was the incumbent MP from Kodarma (Lok Sabha constituency), contested the elections on Jharkhand Vikas Morcha ticket in 2009 general election, and retained the seat. But in the Narendra Modi wave of 2014, Marandi's party failed to win any seat in the state as BJP won 12 out of 14 seats; from Koderma, BJP's Ravindra Kumar Ray was elected to Lok Sabha. Personal life Babulal Marandi is married to Shanti Murmu.

It is the sequel to The Hollow Chocolate Bunnies of the Apocalypse, winner of the 2003 SFX Magazine Best Novel Award. It follows the adventures of Eddie Bear and his sidekick Jack.  Synopsis  Eddie Bear has been deposed as the mayor of Toy City and the toymaker has taken away his modifications. Jill has left Jack and he is now working in Nadine's Diner. One day, a drunk Eddie witnesses bright flashing lights and a copy of him appear in an alleyway. He attributes it to being drunk. Soon after, the toys in the toy city are dying. When touched, the toys crumble to dust. Jack and Eddie start investigating even though Jack doesn't plan on it. Their investigations end up getting them in trouble with Inspector Bellis who arrests them on trumped up charges but lets them go in return for them promising to solve the mystery. With the help of the Phantom of the Opera and a calculating pocket called Wallah that Jack steals from Tinto, Jack and Eddie discover that a pair of their doppelg√§ngers are sucking the souls of the toys. They try to stop them in the opera but fail. While pursuing the doppelgangers by following their smell, Jack and Eddie come to the old and dead Toy Town. There they discover that the hiding place of the doppelgangers is Bill Winkle's old house. They get captured by a UFO (flying saucer) trying to get away from Bill's house and experiments are done on them by the aliens, including implanting implants up their bottoms. Eddie decides to get Jack hypnotised by a hypnotist at the circus. After listening to what Jack had to say, the hypnotist becomes catatonic and Jack and Eddie escape with the hypnotists wallet. With proof of alien's involvement, they decide go back to Bill's house in Toy Town and follow the doppelgangers. This time again the flying saucer tries to attack them and Jack destroys it by firing at it and throwing grenades that he stole from Bill's house. The doppelgangers go through \\"The Second Big O\\" ‚Äì the second O in the sign that reads \\"TO TO LA\\" which stood for TOYTOWNLAND. Eddie and Jack go through the second big O themselves and end up on the other side in the world of men. When they look back, the sign reads HOLLYWOOD. In the land of them, the instruments they brought with them from Toy City stop working. After meeting with an aspiring actress named Dorothy they visit Golden Chicken Diner for a cup of coffee and discover that the dead toys from Toy City are being given away for free in the diner. To find out the person responsible behind the chain, they decide to infiltrate the chain of diners by joining it at a low level and rising up the level (following the American Dream). Meanwhile, Eddie is kidnapped by the other Jack and taken to Area 52. As an assistant chef, Jack's boss, the head chef, tells him that it is impossible to breed as many chickens and eggs that men eat and proves that all chickens served in the diner are artificial. The following day, at the conference, Jack tries to take over the conference and find out the leader but instead gets captured by LAPD. He escapes their custody and frees Dorothy. Together, they steal a squad car and drive madly to escape the chase given by LAPD. They end up close to Area 52 and go in to investigate. Inside Area 52, the other Eddie reveals to Eddie, who is dying as he is out of Toy City, about the plan by the chickens to take over the land of men (by making them addicted to chicken and then making them fight each other) and Toy City (by sucking the souls of the toys and enslaving the men in Toy City just like the men in the land of men). When LAPD gets to Area 52, Eddie tells the other Eddie to let Jack go outside and give himself up. The police beat up the other Jack for all the problems caused by Jack and this pleases Eddie as the other Jack was very abusive towards him. At the police station, the other Jack is revealed to be a robot and he escapes the police station, steals a sulphuric acid truck and drives towards Area 52, chased by the LAPD in an armed helicopter and a lone Air Force jet. The chickens fly out with a dozen flying saucers to cross over to Toy City through the Hollywood sign and Jack followed by LAPD and the lone Air Force jet follow them. There is a big collision at the entrance and half a dozen flying saucers are destroyed along with the robot Jack. The portal is destroyed as well. Once in Toy City, Eddie regains his full strength and Jack and Dorothy who survived the falling elevator in Area 52 (the other Eddie tried to kill them there) attack the other Eddie. Jack shoots the other Eddie as his identity is revealed when he uses a corroborative noun (\\"as simple as blinking\\"). The head chicken, a queen, emerges from the body of the other Eddie and Dorothy wrings her neck and kills her. This is very fortunate because the next queen automatically reverses the previous queen's policies and that is not because she wants to but because of tradition. Toy City is prepared as well because Eddie sent a telepathic message to a space man in a space suit who informed Inspector Bellis who instructed all the toy tanks and others to be armed. All the flying saucers are shot down. Eddie, Jack and Dorothy come out of the lead flying saucer alive. Dorothy is revealed to be a vegetable from a different world, so Jack buries her he expects she will set roots and grow. The book ends with Inspector Bellis telling Eddie that he can influence enough people to get Eddie the position of City Mayor.

It is part of Libraries Tasmania. Libraries Tasmania includes a state-wide network of library services, community learning, adult literacy and the State‚Äôs archives and heritage services. History The first \\"Tasmanian Public Library\\" opened in 1849, in a house in Hobart, funded by a government grant and yearly subscription of members. It became accessible to the public in 1860, but was forced to close in 1867 owing to debts. In 1870 a new, free public reference library opened in the Hobart Town Hall. American philanthropist Andrew Carnegie funded the move to new premises in 1907, with the requirement that a free lending service should be established at the same time. The Libraries Act (1943) established the State Library of Tasmania, administered by the Tasmanian Library Board. At this time, the Library included many branches across the state, which grew in number over time until such time as some were closed in government rationalisations. From October 2006, the State Library, the Archives Office, Adult Education and online access centres were integrated as the Community Knowledge Network, renamed LINC Tasmania in 2009. The system was part of the Tasmanian Department of Education. The name changed from LINC Tasmania to Libraries Tasmania in mid-2018. Location and description The headquarters of Libraries Tasmania, which also houses the State Library, is located at the corner of Murray and Bathurst Street in Hobart. The public Reading Room is located on the second floor of the building. The State Library contains over 200,000 books, periodicals, maps and directories. Reference and research services are provided to on-site and off-site clients using a range of print and online resources. Heritage Collections The library operates several collections and archives of historical publications and documents, particularly those related to Tasmania. In addition, the library maintains a newspaper index, an image library and a database of sheet music. Tasmaniana Library A collection of historical and modern published material related to Tasmania, in a range of formats from paper to digital. All Tasmanian-related material is collected including all works published in Tasmania, all works published about Tasmania, and all works by Tasmanian authors. W.L. Crowther Library A collection of historical books, documents, photographs, works of art and objects collected by Sir William Crowther, whose great-grandfather arrived in Hobart in 1825. The library contains about 15,000 books and manuscripts, as well as photographs and artworks, and whaling ephemera including a collection of scrimshaw. Allport Library and Museum of Fine Arts Another collection of historical material, bequeathed to the people of Tasmania by the Allport family to the library in 1965. It includes about 6,000 books, and outstanding collection of about 2,500 colonial-era artworks (by family members and others) and collections of Georgian era furniture, British, French and Chinese porcelain. Digital collections In 1998, the State Library developed a service to capture and store selected Tasmanian websites, known as Our Digital Island. The sites were downloaded and then reinstalled onto a State Library server, where they would operate independently of the original site, and held in perpetuity. The legal deposit obligations within the Tasmanian Libraries Act 1984 allowed the Library to capture the websites without having to gain permission their Tasmanian publishers. While the service did not capture all Tasmanian websites, it had captured about 600 by 2003. The publicly available store of Our Digital Island contains websites as preserved from 2001 until 2012. The 3000 website records (with over 9000 captures taken at different times) are available through the Libraries Tasmania online catalogue. Over time, Our Digital Island began to also store electronic documents as separate entitities (annual reports, policy documents, etc.), but it became clear that the format did not allow for easy accessibility and use, so the Library set out to create a different type of online depository and archive. The Stable Tasmanian Open Repository Service (STORS) was a joint initiative of the State Library and Service Tasmania that was officially launched in late 2003. Its scope was limited to self-contained electronic resources with a defined title (i.e. excluding websites) which were able to be used by current web browser software. collected all material published in Tasmania, as per legal deposit requirement. The purpose of STORS was to act as a repository for and to provide access to contemporary electronic documents, and to serve the function of an archive by retaining these documents forever. Publishers submitted their digital publications directly to STORS, which by the end of 2017 held about 33,000 items. STORS was terminated on 31 May 2019, when it was replaced by the National edeposit system (NED), a collaboration between Australia‚Äôs nine national, state and territory libraries. As a member library of National and State Libraries Australia, the organisation collaborated on the creation of NED, which enables publishers from all over Australia to upload electronic publications as per the 2016 amendment to the Copyright Act 1968 and other regional legislation relating to legal deposit, and makes these publications publicly accessible online (depending on access conditions) from anywhere via Trove.

It was developed as part of the CALS DOD initiative. History and Rationale The CALS Table Model was developed by the CALS Industry Steering Group Electronic Publishing Committee (EPC). The EPC subcommittee, of which Harvey Bingham was co-chair and a major contributor, designed the CALS Table Model in 1989-1990. The EPC was made up of industry and military service representatives. Some represented traditional military document printing agencies. Others represented electronic publishing organizations. SGML itself was new. At that time, the CALS intent for all their technical manuals was to use that DTD to achieve system-neutral interchange of content and structure. Its basis was a minimal description and example of a table from the prior Mil-M-38784B specification for producing technical manuals. The incomplete specification of the semantics associated with the table model allowed too much freedom for vendor interpretation, and resulted in problems with interchange. SGML-Open (now OASIS) surveyed the implementing vendors to identify differences, as the initial step toward reaching a common interpretation. The next step was an updated CALS Table Model DTD and semantics. Both are now available from OASIS.http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/tablemodels.php As implementations of the CALS Table Model were developed, a number of ambiguities and omissions were detected and reported to the EPC committee. The differences in interpretation had led to serious interoperability problems. To resolve these differences, OASIS identified a subset of the full CALS table model that had a high probability of successful interoperability among the OASIS vendor products. This subset is the Exchange Table Model DTD.http://www.oasis- open.org/specs/tr9503.html Example (IUPAC) name pyro-EGTA 2,2',2,2'-(2,2'-(1,2-phenylene bis(oxy))bis(ethane-2,1-diyl)) bis(azanetriyl)tetraacetic acid EGTA ethylene glycol- bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid EDTA 2,2',2,2'-(ethane-1,2-diyldinitrilo)tetraacetic acid (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) AATA 2,2'-(2-(2-(2-(bis(carboxymethyl)amino)ethoxy)ethoxy) phenylazanediyl)diacetic acid APTRA 2-carboxymethoxy-aniline-N,N-diacetic acid BAPTA 1,2-bis(-2-aminophenoxy)ethane- N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid HIDA N-(2-hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetic acid Carboxyglutamate 3-Aminopropane-1,1,3-tricarboxylic acid See also OASIS is the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards, a global consortium that develops data representation standards for use in computer software.

Gaius Sosius was elected quaestor in 66 BC and praetor in 49 BC. Upon the start of the civil war, he joined the party of the Senate sometimes called optimates by modern scholars (even though the term belongs to the era of Sulla and Marius). Upon the flight of Pompey to Greece, Sosius returned to Rome and submitted to Julius Caesar. After the assassination of Caesar, Sosius joined the party of Mark Antony, who in 38 BC appointed him governor of Syria and Cilicia in the place of Publius Ventidius. As governor, Sosius was commanded by Antony to support Herod against Antigonus the Hasmonean, when the latter was in possession of Jerusalem. In 37 BC, he advanced against Jerusalem and after he became master of the city, Sosius placed Herod upon the throne. In return for this service, he was awarded a triumph in 34 BC, and in 32 BC he became consul along with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. When civil war broke out between Antony and Octavian, Sosius espoused the cause of Antony and violently attacked Octavian in the senate, for which he was forced to flee to the east. In 31 BC, Sosius commanded a squadron in Mark Antony's fleet with which (according to Dio 50.14) he managed to defeat the squadron of Taurius Rufus and put it to flight, but, when the latter was reinforced by Marcus Agrippa, Sosius's ally Tarcondimotus I, the king of Cilicia, was killed and Sosius himself was forced to flee. At the Battle of Actium, Sosius commanded the left wing of the fleet. After the battle, from which he managed to escape, Sosius' hiding place was found and he was captured and brought before Octavian but, at the intercession of Lucius Arruntius, Octavian pardoned him. He returned to Rome and completed his building project on the temple of Apollo Medicus (begun in 34 BC), dedicating it to Octavian's name. It is unknown if Sosius had sons, but two daughters are known: Sosia and Sosia Galla, possibly by an Asinia,Gaius Stern, Women Children and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae, University of California Berkeley dissertation 2006, page 353, n.88 a Nonia or an Aelia, based on the name of Sosia Galla.

Discussion about the need for a new supersonic interceptor had been ongoing for some time in the early 1950s, and several designs introduced, but improving radar systems and weapons mooted the need for better aircraft in the short term. Information about new Soviet supersonic bomber designs emerged in 1954, sparking serious consideration for the first time. The Requirement emerged as a much larger and longer-range system than previously studied. The Requirement called for aircraft to be in service by 1962, the same date as the Tupolev Tu-22. A number of designs were entered into the competition, many of them based on earlier projects. They generally featured two engines, mounted a powerful new Airborne Interception radar, and would be armed with improved versions of the de Havilland Firestreak missile or an even larger radar-guided design known as \\"Red Hebe\\". In overall terms, the F.155 designs were similar to the Convair F-106 or Avro Arrow, although longer range was desired. Serious design work had only just started when the entire effort was cancelled as part of the 1957 Defence White Paper. This paper considered the introduction of new Soviet medium range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) that were being deployed in East Germany; these were armed with chemical warheads but it was clear it that nuclear-armed versions would be available by the mid-1960s. In this case, shooting down bombers would have no ultimate effect on the outcome of the battle. The paper led to the cancellation of nearly all manned fighter projects as well as most other air defence programs as a radical change had occurred in strategic threats with the expectation that missiles and low-level strike would replace high-flying bombers. Gloster Javelin all-weather fighter in service at the time. Background During the early 1950s, the RAF's front line defence was converting from Gloster Meteor (a design that first flew during the Second World War) to Gloster Javelin all-weather fighters with the anticipation of new interceptors coming into service in the near-future. These included the English Electric Lightning (point defence interceptor) and Saunders-Roe SR.177 interceptors in development. While the Lightning embodied largely conventional jet engine technology, the SR.177 was a \\"mixed\\" rocket/jet design that used rocket power for delivering high speed and maximum altitude performance. Due to the length of design and development, for the interim the RAF also considered purchase of the Canadian Avro CF-105 Arrow projected to be operational by 1961. Requirement Operation Requirement F.155 specified exacting demands: * The capability of making an intercept within 20 minutes of target contact (250 miles from the UK) * target speed would be Mach 1+ * ceiling: * Armament: a mixture of infra-red guided missiles and radar guided missiles * Crew: Two (pilot, weapons systems/navigation); a crew of two was specified because of the anticipated workload. The Ministry of Supply made clear in the requirement that the plane and missiles should be treated as a \\"weapon system\\" i.e., a cohesive whole. The armament specifications were covered by a separate Operational Requirement: OR.1131. Two missiles were identified in OR.1131: *Blue Vesta to be developed by de Havilland and *Red Hebe by Vickers, a scaled down version of their Red Dean missile. A smaller version of Red Hebe would eventually also come into the equation. Blue Vesta was a infra-red guided weapon for attack from a pursuit angle. The Blue Vesta was largely displaced by the development of Blue Jay Mark 4 (which would enter service as Red Top). Red Hebe was nearly but being radar guided, it would be able to hit its target from any firing angle including a collision course intercept. Designs Most British manufacturers provided their own suggestions for planes that would meet the specification. At the same time the engine manufacturers were encouraged to develop the necessary powerplants. These included the de Havilland Gyron and Rolls-Royce RB.106. Saunders-Roe came up with the P.187: a logical progression from the SR.53 and SR.177 mixed power (rocket and jet engines) interceptors. This gave both rapid acceleration and the capability to operate at high altitudes where jets would be inefficient due to the thin air. Saunders-Roe judged that a big aircraft would be needed to carry 2 IR and 2 radar-guided missiles and the fuel required. A highly streamlined futuristic-looking design (using a drooped nose) it would have been powered by 2 PS.52 jets, a projected development of the Gyron giving 35,000 lb (155.6 kN) of thrust, and 4 Spectre rockets, giving a speed of Mach 2.5 at 76,000 ft (23,165 m). It was judged, at 98,000 lb (3 times the weight of the SR.177) and , as too big. Fairey's successful FD2 experimental aircraft Fairey drew on their experience with the Fairey Delta 2 (FD2). Their first proposal was a single-engined fighter development of the existing FD2, which was felt to have good export potential although it did not meet the RAF criteria laid down in O.R. F.155. A larger twin-engined design tailored to the operational requirement followed on from this, which became known simply as the \\"Delta III\\". A fighter-bomber derivative of this aircraft was also envisaged, with Bristol Olympus 21R engines coupled with a large ventral drop tank giving a much-improved radius of action at low altitude. Fairey, like some of the other manufacturers, felt that carrying 4 missiles was too onerous especially given the size of the radar guided Red Hebe and provided designs based on a payload of only two missiles. They also took the mixed power route for both the FD2 based and the new 'FD3' designs, with both making provision for the fitting of de Havilland rocket engines. Hawker P.1103 company schematic drawing Going on the basis of the smallest aircraft that could do the job, Hawker's design (the P1103) used a single, albeit powerful, engine ‚Äì a 25,000 lb (111.1 kN) development of the Gyron. Alternative engines in the form of the Rolls-Royce RB.122, Armstrong-Siddeley P.173 and the Canadian Orenda PS.13 were also options. Two detachable rocket boosters, to give a 3.7-minute boost, were carried in midwing nacelles. Armstrong-Whitworth AW.169 manufacturer's model Armstrong-Whitworth put forward their AW.169. A razor-thin straight wing carried the engines in nacelles ‚Äì one Gyron Junior on each side ‚Äì with a rocket booster under the long narrow fuselage. Two missiles were carried, one on each wingtip. Vickers Type 559 Vickers-Armstrong submitted the Type 559; an unorthodox canard design with a massive chin air intake, split vertically, for two reheated Gyron engines to 1.950k (placed as in the English Electric Lightning, one above the other). Two Spectre Junior rockets were situated each side of the jets at wing level. Two Red Hebe or Blue Jay missiles were mounted alongside the upper part of the fuselage between the canard and the mainplane, which had end-plates incorporating twin rudders. De Havilland submitted a relatively small design when compared to the giants from Fairey and Saunders-Roe. The DH.117 was to be powered by two Gyron Junior turbojets and a Spectre booster rocket in the tail, with a crew of two seated in tandem. Provision was not made for Red Hebe, the de Havilland team preferring the company's own line of missiles that would culminate in Red Top. English Electric submitted a design based on their successful P.1B short-range interceptor that would become the Lightning. The P.8 was larger overall, carried a crew of two, moved the weapons to the wingtips and undercarriage to the fuselage but featured the same vertically-stacked engine and nose intake layout as the Lightning. The radar package was to be the same AI-23 AIRPASS system as the Lightning but with a larger scanner dish to improve detection range. At the time, English Electric engineers were far from convinced of the ability of fighter aircraft to carry both radar- and infrared-guided weapons, so designed the P.8 to only carry the de Havilland Blue Jay Mk.4, which would enter service as Red Top. The AW.169 and Fairey's Delta III design were considered to be the best two contenders taking into account the design of the aircraft, the development risks, the capabilities of the design teams and the manufacturers' workloads ‚Äì Bristol had not been invited to tender because of the importance of the Bristol 188 high speed research plane they were working on. Initially further work was contracted on both designs but by the end of the year the AW.169 was dropped and the Fairey design become a firm choice. However, in April the following year, the 1957 Defence White Paper terminated nearly all manned fighter development projects.https://www.aerosociety.com/media/8134/the-1957-defence-white-paper- cancelled-projects.pdf Proposed specifications SR.187 AW.169 Fairey 'Delta III'  Notes   References   Bibliography  * Buttler, Tony.

He was largely responsible for the golden age of Bengali theatre.Kundu, Pranay K. Development of Stage and Theatre Music in Bengal. Published in Banerjee, Jayasri (ed.), The Music of Bengal. Baroda: Indian Musicological Society, 1987. He cofounded the Great National Theatre, the first Bengali professional theatre company in 1872, wrote nearly 40 plays and acted and directed many more, and later in life became a noted disciple of Sri Ramakrishna. House of Girish Ghosh Biography Girish Chandra Ghosh, with Swami Adbhutananda, Mahendranath Gupta and other disciples and devotees of Ramakrishna Early days Born in Bagbazar, Kolkata, on 28 February 1844, the eighth child to his parents Nilkamal and Raimani, he received his early education at Oriental Seminary, and later studied at Hare School in the city but not completed education. After the death of his father he married Promodini Devi, the daughter of Nabin Chandra Deb and re-entered in class - I in Oriental Seminary. His father Nilkamal Ghosh was a generous and kind hearted person and Girish retained some of his father's large heartedness. He lost his parents early in life and went up to educate himself. Girish after leaving school in 1862 acquired an apprenticeship with a British Company in book keeping. It was around this time that Girish became acquainted with Ishwar Chandra Gupta and began writing plays, songs and poetry. Professional career Girish was a prominent actor in the Bagbazar Amateur Theatre where he had Ardhendu Sekhar Mustafi, another great contemporary actor, as his partner. Together they performed in Sadhabar Ekadashi by the famous playwright Dinabandhu Mitra, which became very popular. Later Bagbazar Amateur was renamed in 1871 as the National Theatre. Girish however left National Theatre and went to form the Great National Theatre in 1873 which he became manager of in 1880. In 1877 Girish staged his first play Agamani at The Great National Theatre. Later he also worked in Minerva Theatre and went to become a manager in Star Theatre. The maiden show at the Star Theatre was Daksha Jagna by Girish Chandra Ghosh on the auspicious day of 21 July 1883. With Binodini Dasi, he staged his play, Chaitanyalila, at the Star Theatre on 20 September 1884, with, Sri Ramakrishna in the audience. Girish wrote about 86 plays, most of which were based upon stories from Purana, Ramayana and Mahabharata. Among his famous works were Buddhadev Charit, Purna Chandra, Nasiram, Kalapahar, Ashoka, Shankaracharya, Chaitanyalila, Nimai Sannyas, Rup- Sanatan, Vilwamangal, Prahlad Charit. Most of his plays were performed in Star Theatre in Calcutta.Girish Chandra Ghosh Girish also translated Shakespeare's Macbeth play into Bangla in 1893. Influence of Sri Ramakrishna Girish first met Sri Ramakrishna in the ancestral home of his neighbour Kalinath Bose. On 21 September 1884 Sri Ramakrishna went to watch Chaitanya Lila in Star Theatre. It is said that Girish's first meeting with Sri Ramakrishna, was not very cordial. He saw Sri Ramakrishna in divine ecstasy and thought it to be some kind of a trick. But later when Ramakrishna met him the Master told him that the incident was no trick and Girish was extremely surprised to find master reading his thought. Later when the Master went to watch his theatre he and Girish repeatedly went on exchanging salutes and ultimately Girish had to give up. Girish later said about this incident that in Iron Age the best weapon is \\"pranamastra\\" or the \\"salute weapon\\" with which god kills His enemies. In his play Nasiram, Girish used much of the teachings of Sri Ramakrishna.Contemporary Bengali Literature ‚Äì I, by Hiranmoy Mukherjee, Vedanta Kesari, April 2010 There are many scenes in The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna involving Girish and Sri Ramakrishna. Sri Ramakrishna went to watch several of his plays in Star Theatre. He also blessed Binodini Dasi, one of the lead actresses.

It opened as Haidhausen station in 1871 on the new Munich‚ÄìM√ºhldorf and Munich‚ÄìRosenheim railway lines. The station is operated by DB Station&Service;, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn AG, and is classified as a Category 1 station, one of 21 in Germany and two in Munich, the other being M√ºnchen Hauptbahnhof. It is the city's third interregional station besides M√ºnchen Hauptbahnhof in the city centre and M√ºnchen-Pasing in the west.  History  A first station, built according to plans designed by Friedrich B√ºrklein, was inaugurated on 1 May 1871 as part of the newly built railway line to Neu√∂tting via M√ºhldorf am Inn. The line to Rosenheim opened on 15 October 1871. Initially named Haidhausen after the eponymous quarter, it received its present name M√ºnchen Ost on 15 October 1876. The station was given additional significance as a railway hub with the opening of the Munich East‚ÄìDeisenhofen line in 1898; followed by train connections to Ismaning and Schwabing in 1909, the first to be electrified in 1927. The station was severely damaged by the bombing of Munich on 24/25 April 1944 and had to be entirely rebuilt after World War II. A provisional counter hall was erected in 1952. A motorail (Autoreisezug) yard opened on 22 June 1959. In May 1972, shortly before the Summer Olympics, Munich East became part of the Munich S-Bahn network as eastern terminus of the Stammstrecke to Munich Pasing in the west. The present-day entrance building was erected in 1985. Three years later, in 1988, the station also received access to the Munich U-Bahn network. Further refurbishments of the station building took place in 1999 and in 2008.  Operational usage  Railway tracks, view from Technisches Rathaus The station has 17 tracks. Tracks 1-5 are used by the S-Bahn, tracks 6-8 and 11-14 are used by regional and interregional traffic. Tracks 9, 10 and 15 are through tracks. Tracks 16 and 17 are used by Motorail. Mainly InterCity as well as international EuroCity and Railjet services via Rosenheim to Salzburg and Innsbruck in Austria, to Italy and Southeastern Europe depart from this station. Some ICE services to Vienna and Innsbruck also stop here. Several Regional-Express and Regionalbahn services depart from Munich East to many destinations in Chiemgau and southeastern Bavaria. Trains are operated by the S√ºdostBayernBahn network of Deutsche Bahn AG as well as by the private Bayerische Oberlandbahn railway company (Meridian).  S-Bahn  The Ostbahnhof (the name of the S-Bahn part of the station) was refurbished under the Takt 10 project. As an endpoint of the backbone tunnel of Munich's S-Bahn system all lines pass through the station, except S20. Lines S2, S4, S6 and S8 continue via platform 5 further east. The lines S3 and S7 change direction at platform 4 and continue further south to Giesing. The trains to the tunnel depart from platforms 1-3. U-Bahn station  U-Bahn  Since 1988 there is a U-Bahn service to Ostbahnhof by the line U5. It continues south to Neuperlach S√ºd via Innsbrucker Ring and west to Laimer Platz via Max-Weber-Platz, Hauptbahnhof and Theresienwiese. The line services the station every ten minutes (five in rush-hours).  Tramway  The Ostbahnhof stop of the Munich tramway is located on Orleansplatz, and served by route .

He was a member of the Wild Bunch gang led by Butch Cassidy and Elzy Lay. He was arrested for robbery and served about 10 years of his 15-year sentence. Upon his release from prison, he returned to crime and was killed by a hostage during a train robbery. Early life Kilpatrick was born in Coleman County, Texas, in 1874, the third of nine children of a Tennessee-born farmer, George Washington Kilpatrick (or \\"Killpatrick\\"), by his wife, Mary, a native of South Carolina, according to the 1880 Federal Census.1880 Federal Census for Precinct 11, Coleman County Texas (Coleman County Enumeration District 45, Sheet 6, Lines 1-8) shows \\"Benjamen A. Killpatrick\\" as a six-year-old native of Texas He worked as a cowboy for a time in Texas and became acquaintances with Tom and Sam Ketchum and Bill Carver. Outlaw life After Cassidy's release from prison, Lay and he organized the Wild Bunch gang, and the gang began the most successful train-robbing career in history. Kilpatrick is thought to have been a friend of Lay, but he may have had minimal or no involvement with crimes involving Butch Cassidy or the Sundance Kid. Kilpatrick became involved with Kid Curry, but where or how they met is uncertain. Escape The gang would commit their robberies, split up, and then head in several different directions, meeting some time later in the Hole in the Wall hideout in Wyoming. Bullion and he made their way to Nashville, Tennessee, where they met with Kid Curry and his girlfriend Della Moore. Moore was arrested shortly thereafter for passing money traced back to one of the gang's robberies. Arrest Kilpatrick was captured on November 5, 1901, in St. Louis, Missouri, and received a 15-year sentence. Death Photograph shows the bodies of Ben Kilpatrick and Ole Hobek being held up by others after being killed near Sanderson Tex., Mar. 13, 1912 He was released from prison in June 1911. On March 12, 1912, Kilpatrick and outlaw Ole Hobek were killed while robbing a train near Sanderson, Texas. The duo is thought to have participated in several train robberies outside of Memphis in November 1911 and February 1912, as well as other small robberies in West Texas. In March 1912, Kilpatrick boarded a Southern Pacific Express train near Sanderson, Texas, alongside a former inmate whom he had befriended. Attempting a robbery, Kilpatrick held up the express messenger, David Trousdale, in the Wells Fargo baggage and mail car. While Kilpatrick looted the safe and any other valuables he could find, Trousdale managed to hide an ice mallet underneath the back of his jacket. Trousdale then told Kilpatrick that there was a valuable package lying on the ground. Kilpatrick rested his rifle against his leg while he leaned over to pick up the package. As he did, Trousdale pulled the mallet from beneath his coat and struck Kilpatrick three times in the back of the neck and head. Kilpatrick died instantly of a broken neck and crushed skull. The beating with the mallet was so brutal that Kilpatrick's brains stained the walls of the car.

It is the trading name of British Gas Services Limited and British Gas New Heating Limited, both subsidiaries of Centrica. Serving around twelve million homes in the United Kingdom, British Gas is the biggest energy supplier in the country, and is considered one of the Big Six dominating the gas and electricity market in the United Kingdom. History 1812‚Äì1948 The Gas Light and Coke Company was the first public utility company in the world. It was founded by Frederick Albert Winsor and incorporated by Royal Charter on 30 April 1812 under the seal of King George III. It continued to thrive for the next 136 years, expanding into domestic services whilst absorbing many smaller companies including the Aldgate Gas Light and Coke Company (1819), the City of London Gas Light and Coke Company (1870), the Equitable Gas Light Company (1871), the Great Central Gas Consumer's Company (1870), Victoria Docks Gas Company (1871), Western Gas Light Company (1873), Imperial Gas Light and Coke Company (1876), Independent Gas Light and Coke Company (1876), the London Gas Light Company (1883), Richmond Gas Company (1925), Brentford Gas Company (1926), Pinner Gas Company (1930) and Southend-on-Sea and District Gas Company (1932). On 1 May 1949, the GLCC became the major part of the new North Thames Gas Board, one of Britain's twelve regional gas boards after the passing of the Gas Act 1948 by Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government. 1948‚Äì1973 In the beginning of the 1900s, the gas market in the United Kingdom was mainly run by county councils and small private firms. At this time the use of a flammable gas (often known as \\"town gas\\") piped to houses as a fuel was still being marketed to consumers, by such means as the National Gas Congress and Exhibition in 1913. The gas used in the 19th and early 20th centuries was coal gas, but in the period of 1967‚Äì77, British domestic coal gas supplies were replaced by natural gas. Great Peter Street In 1948, Clement Attlee's Labour government reshaped the gas industry, bringing in the Gas Act 1948. The act (on the vesting date of 1 April 1949) nationalised the gas industry in the United Kingdom and 1,062 privately owned and municipal gas companies were merged into twelve area gas boards, each a separate body with its own management structure. The twelve gas boards were: Eastern, East Midlands, Northern, North Eastern, North Thames, North West, Scottish, Southern, South Eastern, South West, Wales, and West Midlands. Each area board was divided into geographical groups or divisions which were often further divided into smaller districts. These boards simply became known as the \\"gas board\\", a term still sometimes used when referring to British Gas. In addition, the Gas Act established the Gas Council, its constitution was such that control lay effectively with the area boards. The council consisted of a chairman and deputy chairman, both appointed by the minister, and the chairmen of each of the twelve area boards. The council served as a channel of communication with the minister; undertook labour negotiations; undertook research; and acted as spokesperson for the gas industry generally. The Gas Act 1965 shifted the balance of power to the centre: it put the Gas Council on the same footing as the area boards, with the powers to borrow up to ¬£900 million, to manufacture or acquire gas and to supply gas in bulk to any area board. In May 1968, the Gas Council moved to large new offices at 59 Bryanston Street, Marble Arch, London. 1973‚Äì1986 In the beginning of the 1970s, the gas industry was again restructured after the Gas Act 1972 was passed. The act merged all the area boards and created the British Gas Corporation, and abolished the Gas Council. From its inception, the corporation was responsible for development and maintenance of the supply of gas to Great Britain, in addition to satisfying reasonable demand for gas throughout the country. Its leadership, like that of the area boards, was appointed and supervised by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry until 1974, when those powers were vested in the newly created position of Secretary of State for Energy. 1986‚Äì1997 The Conservative Government, led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher introduced the Gas Act 1986, which led to the privatisation of the company, and on 8 December 1986, its shares floated on the London stock market as British Gas plc. In the hope of encouraging individuals to become shareholders, the offer was advertised with the \\"If you see Sid... Tell him!\\" campaign. The initial public offering of 135p per share valued the company at ¬£9 billion. 1997‚Äìpresent A newly designed van of British Gas (2013) In February 1997, eleven years after it had been privatised, British Gas plc demerged to become the entirely separate BG Group and the Gas Sales and Gas Trading, Services and Retail businesses. The Gas Sales and Gas Trading and Services and Retail businesses, together with the gas production business of the North and South Morecambe gas fields, were transferred to Centrica, which continues to own and operate the British Gas retail brand. British Gas acquired Dyno-Rod in October 2004. In May 2007, British Gas signed a landmark deal which saw 1,000 Volkswagen Caddy vans being supplied to the firm, which were fitted with a bespoke racking system and a speed limiter, designed by Siemens. The deal was renewed in September 2015. In April 2016, it was announced that 224,000 residential customers had left the company, citing customers coming to the end of their fixed deals and then moving on to other suppliers as the main reason for this loss. Polyethylene plastic main being placed in a trench. In the same month (April 2016) British Gas also announced they would be closing a call centre and office in Oldbury (West Midlands), with a loss of approximately 680 jobs. In May 2018, Centrica announced that British Gas had lost 100,000 customers since the start of the year. However, the parent company was still likely to hit its targets of 2018, and pay dividends of 12p per share. British Gas is now led by chief executive, Sarwjit Sambhi, who oversees a business that provides energy and services to around ten million homes, and employs over 28,000 staff based across the United Kingdom. A further seven hundred job cuts in the United Kingdom have been announced by Centrica in July 2019, amid growing marketplace challenges, which include the loss of 742,000 customers in 2018, and the government's price cap. Advertising, sponsorship and marketing British Gas has actively been involved in sports sponsorship, including a six-year deal with the British swimming team which commenced in March 2009, and is expected to net the team ¬£15 million, and from 2006 to 2009, it sponsored the Southern Football League of England. The company's extensive television advertising has featured many high-profile individuals, and in the beginning of the 1990s, one advertisement included Cheryl Tweedy as a small child, more than ten years before the beginning of her pop music career. In November 2012, the Information Commissioner's Office publicly listed British Gas as one of a number of companies that it had concerns about due to unsolicited telephone calls for marketing. The concerns were based on complaints. In response, British Gas said that \\"We uphold the highest standards when contacting people in their homes, and only use contact information if we have express permission to do so.\\" In July 2014, regulator Ofgem reached an agreement with British Gas for the company to pay ¬£1 million in compensation to hundreds of people, who had been advised to switch from other suppliers to British Gas by British Gas advisers using exaggerated claims. On 20 September 2015, British Gas launched an advert, including their new mascot, Wilbur the Penguin. Distribution network operators British Gas is an energy supplier for homes across the country. The infrastructure (pipes) which delivers the gas to consumers is owned and maintained by other companies. They do not, however, manage the network of towers and cables that distributes electricity ‚Äì these are maintained by distribution network operators (DNOs) which vary from region to region.

In 56 BC, Tullus gave his support to the group who were pushing to grant Pompey a special commission to bring about the restoration of Ptolemy XII Auletes in Egypt. In 54 BC, he was one of the consulars who supported Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, who was standing trial for extortion. Largely abandoning politics after his consulate, he tried to stand aloof when the conflict between Pompey and Julius Caesar reached a crisis point in late 50 BC. In January 49 BC, he proposed sending peace envoys to Caesar to try to defuse the situation.Holmes III, pg. 3 He, like many other senators, obeyed Pompey‚Äôs instructions and fled Rome, but returned when Caesar summoned all members of the Senate to return.Holmes III, pg. 41 Beyond this, he took no part in the struggle, but remained quietly in Italy. Cicero, however, noted that he was an enemy of Gaius Claudius Marcellus Minor, whom Caesar pardoned in 45 BC. Tullus was the father of Lucius Volcatius Tullus, consul in 33 BC. Notes Sources * T.

It is chambered in 9√ó19mm Parabellum and is rated to accept +P ammunition. It became well known for its low retail price of under $200. The C9 is undergoing revisions in 2019 and the next generation of the design will be sold as the Hi-Point YC9. Model C-9 The Model C-9 is a compact, single-stack magazine, model of Hi-Point's 9√ó19mm handgun. It consists of a polymer frame, zinc-alloy slide and bolt (with steel reinforcing inserts), and a steel breech, chamber and barrel. Its low price and small and compact design prompted many to purchase it for concealed carry. Some decline to carry the C9 in Condition One (\\"cocked and locked\\" - generally considered to be the preferable condition for defensive carry) because of the striker fired design which lacks a firing pin block. Hi-Point's handguns use a blowback design similar to that used in the Walther PPK and Russian Makarov PM. In blowback weapons the mass of the slide and bolt absorbs the rearward force generated by the propulsion of the bullet. As the pressure drops to a safe level, the slide moves back (along with the bolt), an extractor hooks the empty casing and pulls it out of the chamber, after which the case is ejected from the weapon by the ejector. When the slide has completed its rearward travel, the recoil spring moves the slide forward, chambering another round. Many, if not most, modern handguns use a locked-breech design and therefore do not require the amount of slide mass that the blowback design requires in order to remain comfortable to shoot, safe to fire, and easy to control during the firing process. Model C-9 Comp. The C-9 Comp. (short for \\"Compensated\\") is the larger version of Hi-Point's 9 mm handgun. Its major difference from the C-9 Compact is that it has a specially designed \\"compensator\\" attached to the end of the barrel. The compensator works by forcing some of the hot gases escaping behind the bullet to go upward through specially drilled holes in the top of the compensator. The escaping gases push the end of the gun downward; helping to eliminate some of the upward motion caused by the natural recoil of the gun. The underside of the C-9 Comp. has been machined with rails to accept the addition of accessories such as a flashlight or laser sights for better target identification. Another difference between the C-9 and C-9 Comp. is the barrel length. Its 4\\" barrel is 1/2\\" longer than its sister weapon's providing for better accuracy and balance. The compensator and extra bulk also increase the weight. Weighing in at 35 oz., it is 6 oz. heavier than the new model, and 2 oz. heavier than the older model of the C-9 Compact. Criticisms Though the C-9, C-9 Compensated, and other Hi-Point handguns have been criticized for their weight, the empty or unloaded weight of the C-9 has been trimmed from to by using a polymer frame, making its weight comparable to other pistols with similar magazine capacities.

Administratively it was part of both Municipio II and Quarter VI Tiburtino. It occupies roughly the two sides of the early stretch of Via Tiburtina, starting from Termini railway station and ending at the Verano area. The latter includes the ancient basilica of San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, which the district takes its name from. Originally a working-class neighbourhood (its inhabitants were mostly workers of the Wuehrer Brewery and the freight yard), it has been a popular, left-oriented area. During World War II San Lorenzo was heavily bombed by Allied planes (on 1943-07-19); the only massive bombing of Rome during the war (though not the only air raid on the city), it aimed at disrupting the railway communication pivoting on the nearby huge freight yard; however, it caused also extensive damage to the buildings of the district (including the Policlinico Umberto I and the basilica itself) and killing some 1,500 people. Maria Montessori's first 3-6 age program was started in San Lorenzo in 1907. Today San Lorenzo, due to the vicinity of the La Sapienza University, is increasingly assuming the character of a student and young artist district. Every evening, hundreds of young people descend on the area, much to the chagrin and protests of the inhabitants of the area.

His nickname \\"News\\" was given to him because he enjoyed seeing his name in newspaper stories of his gang's exploits. He was ambushed and killed by Sheriff deputies in 1901. Biography Early life, outlaw life Carver was born in Coryell County, Texas, in 1868. He worked, for a time, as a cowboy on the \\"Half Circle Six Ranch\\" in Tom Green County, before venturing west to Wyoming and Utah. He met and married Viana E. Byler, who was the aunt to future female outlaw Laura Bullion. Byler died from fever less than six months into their marriage, and Carver entered into a life as an outlaw. He became involved romantically with female outlaw Josie Bassett, sister to female outlaw Ann Bassett, then later with Byler's niece, Bullion, less than a year after his wife's death. By 1896 he was riding with the \\"Black Jack\\" Ketchum gang, taking part in numerous robberies in New Mexico, and becoming friends with outlaw Ben Kilpatrick. After a failed robbery, he fled to \\"Robbers Roost\\" in Utah, where he began riding with Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang. He gained the nickname \\"News\\" for supposedly enjoying seeing his name in newspaper stories of the gang's exploits. He reportedly maintained a close relationship with Josie Bassett throughout that time. By early 1900, Carver was involved with a prostitute named Lille Davis, whom he'd met at Fannie Porters brothel in San Antonio, a place frequented by members of the Wild Bunch gang. This led to friction between him and Bullion, who in turn became involved with Kilpatrick. Within a year, Carver and Bullion were again involved romantically, and Cassidy was planning another big robbery. The gang headed north, and into Wyoming. Laura Bullion 1893 Pinkerton mugshot On August 29, 1900, Carver, Kid Curry, Cassidy, and the Sundance Kid robbed a Union Pacific train near Tipton, Wyoming, with a take that exceeded $30,000. The gang split up to avoid pursuing posses, and Carver fled south. Carver was later involved in the robbery of a \\"Great Northern\\" train near Wagner, Montana. He was shot and killed in Jack Owens' Bakery the night of April 2, 1901 in Sonora, Texas, by Sheriff E.S. \\"Lige\\" Briant and his deputies. With guns drawn on entry, they attempted to arrest Carver and George Kilpatrick on suspicion of the murder of Oliver Thornton in Concho County. Kilpatrick made a fumbling motion and Carver's gun never cleared the holster before he was shot six times. Before he died, he was heard muttering \\"Die game, boys!\\" Kilpatrick lived, and later cleared Carver of the murder. It was later thought that Harvey \\"Kid Curry\\" Logan was responsible for Thornton's murder. Will Carver's grave marker only has the date he was killed.

Instances of this are: # The whole topological information of a smooth manifold M is encoded in the algebraic properties of its \\\\mathbb{R}-algebra of smooth functions A=C^\\\\infty (M), as in the Banach‚ÄìStone theorem. # Vector bundles over M correspond to projective finitely generated modules over A, via the functor \\\\Gamma which associates to a vector bundle its module of sections. # Vector fields on M are naturally identified with derivations of the algebra A. # More generally, a linear differential operator of order k, sending sections of a vector bundle E\\\\rightarrow M to sections of another bundle F\\\\rightarrow M is seen to be an \\\\mathbb{R}-linear map \\\\Delta: \\\\Gamma (E) \\\\rightarrow \\\\Gamma (F) between the associated modules, such that for any k + 1 elements f_0,\\\\ldots, f_k\\\\in A: [f_k[f_{k-1}[\\\\cdots[f_0,\\\\Delta]\\\\cdots =0 where the bracket [f,\\\\Delta]:\\\\Gamma(E)\\\\rightarrow \\\\Gamma(F) is defined as the commutator [f,\\\\Delta](s)=\\\\Delta(f\\\\cdot s)-f\\\\cdot \\\\Delta(s). Denoting the set of kth order linear differential operators from an A-module P to an A-module Q with \\\\mathrm{Diff}_k(P,Q) we obtain a bi-functor with values in the category of A-modules. Other natural concepts of calculus such as jet spaces, differential forms are then obtained as representing objects of the functors \\\\mathrm{Diff}_k and related functors. Seen from this point of view calculus may in fact be understood as the theory of these functors and their representing objects. Replacing the real numbers \\\\mathbb{R} with any commutative ring, and the algebra C^\\\\infty(M) with any commutative algebra the above said remains meaningful, hence differential calculus can be developed for arbitrary commutative algebras. Many of these concepts are widely used in algebraic geometry, differential geometry and secondary calculus. Moreover, the theory generalizes naturally to the setting of graded commutative algebra, allowing for a natural foundation of calculus on supermanifolds, graded manifolds and associated concepts like the Berezin integral.

The term is considered as a direct translation of the French term droit d‚Äôauteur (also German Urheberrecht). It was first (1777) promoted in France by Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, who had close relations with Benjamin Franklin. It is generally used in relation to the copyright laws of civil law countries and in European Union law. Authors' rights are internationally protected by the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and by other similar treaties. ‚ÄúAuthor‚Äù is used in a very wide sense, and includes composers, artists, sculptors and even architects: in general, the author is the person whose creativity led to the protected work being created, although the exact definition varies from country to country. Authors‚Äô rights have two distinct components: the economic rights in the work and the moral rights of the author. The economic rights are a property right which is limited in time and which may be transferred by the author to other people in the same way as any other property (although many countries require that the transfer must be in the form of a written contract). They are intended to allow the author or their holder to profit financially from his or her creation, and include the right to authorize the reproduction of the work in any form (Article 9, Berne Convention). The authors of dramatic works (plays, etc.) also have the right to authorize the public performance of their works (Article 11, Berne Convention). The protection of the moral rights of an author is based on the view that a creative work is in some way an expression of the author's personality: the moral rights are therefore personal to the author, and cannot be transferred to another person except by testament when the author dies. The moral rights regime differs greatly between countries, but typically includes the right to be identified as the author of the work and the right to object to any distortion or mutilation of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation (Article 6bis, Berne Convention). In many countries, the moral rights of an author are perpetual.  Distinction between common law copyright and civil law authors‚Äô rights  It is common to draw a distinction in the treatment of authors and other interested parties between common law jurisdictions and civil law systems. Both copyright and authors‚Äô rights arose in the eighteenth century to address similar problems: the inequality in relations between authors and publishers (and between publishers themselves) if intellectual property is not recognized and protected, and the need to provide an income for authors other than patronage. Both systems provide for a monopoly right granted to the author for a limited term which can be transferred to another person, which was initially the right to copy or otherwise reproduce the work (hence ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù) but has since been expanded to take account of technological developments. It is an essential feature of authors‚Äô rights and of many copyright laws that the object which is protected must arise from the creativity of the author rather than from his or her simple effort or investment (see Feist v. Rural in the United States): both French and German copyright laws protect ‚Äúworks of the mind‚Äù (oeuvres de l'esprit and pers√∂nliche geistige Sch√∂pfungen, respectively). This has led civil law systems to adopt a strong link between the rights (at least initially) and the person of the author: the initial ownership rights by a corporation are severely restricted or even impossible (as in Germany). Common law jurisdictions are more willing to accept corporate ownership of copyright, as in the U. S. work for hire principle. Although the following comparison is simplistic and dependent on the exact laws of individual countries, it is difficult to see an effective (economic) difference in the two situations: *Common law: employer owns the copyright in work created by employees *Civil law: employer enjoys an exclusive licence to the economic rights in work created by employees Civil law systems have also been forceful in protecting the moral rights of authors, arguing that their creativity deserves protection as an integral part of their personality. The protection of the personality in common law jurisdiction has for long been separate from the law of copyright, embodied in such torts as defamation (also passing off and malicious falsehood). Moral rights were not, therefore, explicitly mentioned in UK copyright law until 1988, over a century after the United Kingdom signed the Berne Convention. The difference runs both ways: UK and Irish copyright laws protect the privacy of the subject of certain photographs and films as a moral right under copyright law, while civil law systems treat this as a separate portrait right. The different protections of industrial design rights cut across the divide between the two systems of law.  Use in European Union law  The term ‚Äúauthors‚Äô rights‚Äù is used in European Union law to avoid ambiguity, in preference to the more usual translation of droit d‚Äôauteur etc. as ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù. The equivalent term in British and Irish law is ‚Äúcopyright (subsisting) in a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work‚Äù; the term in Maltese and Cypriot law is similar, except that dramatic works are treated as a subset of literary works.  Germany  Under a bill proposed by the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel approved by the Bundestag, Germany infringement of copyright is equivalent to the crime of theft. The prison sentences for violations of copyright, exactly equal to those provided for the theft, are five years in prison and are the strictest in Europe. For the offense may be indicted even children under 18 years. In addition, following the judgment of 20 October 1993 on the case Phil Collins, it was launched Article 12 (in the Treaty establishing the European Community), according to which states cannot discriminate against goods from other countries.  France  Since October 2009, as required under the Creation and Internet law n. 311, High Authority for the dissemination of works and protection of rights on the Internet (HADOPI) may order the ISP (Internet Service Provider), following a process of investigation and a series of warnings, to temporarily or permanently suspend the 'internet access to those who are caught downloading material illegally.  Italy  The Italian copyright law is governed primarily by Law 22 April 1941 n. 633, on \\"Protection of copyright and other rights associated with its exercise,\\" and Article 2575 and following of the Civil Code (Book Five - Title IX: Of Intellectual property rights and on industrial inventions). Article 54 L.218 / 95 states as the proprietary rights are regulated by state law to use, although the advent of the internet complicate the identification of the place where the activity was carried out.  Related (or neighbouring) rights  Related rights (in German verwandte Schutzrechte), often referred to as neighbouring rights as a more direct translation of the French Droit Voisins, are property rights granted to people who are not the ‚Äúauthor‚Äù of the work in the creative sense of the term. Typically these include performers, producers of phonograms (records, CDs, etc.), producers of films (as opposed to directors or scriptwriters) and broadcasting organisations. Related rights are generally more restricted than authors‚Äô rights in civil law countries, although they may be equivalent in common law countries where both fall under the same concept of ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù. They are not directly covered by the Berne Convention, but are internationally protected by other treaties such as the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations.

The islands of Kambing, Giliraja, Genteng, and Ketapang lie in the Strait. The Suramadu Bridge, the longest in Indonesia, spans the strait between Surabaya on Java and Bangkalan on Madura. In some old Western and old Indonesian sources, the strait commonly appears as Surabaya Strait (Indonesian: Selat Surabaya), but this name is not accepted in the official cartography. Geography The Madura Strait is located in the east of the province of northern East Java, precisely in the southwest, north, and east of the city of Surabaya; east of Sidoarjo Regency; west and south of the island of Madura; and north of the Pasuruan, Probolinggo, and Situbondo area. In this strait there are also small islands, including Kambing Island, Giliraja Island, and Genteng Island near the island of Madura, and Ketapang Island in the coastal waters of Probolinggo Regency. As a maritime waterway, the Madura strait connects various seas along the Java sea, Bali sea, and Bali strait. A remarkable story about the origin of the Madura Strait is contained in the Javanese historical poem of Nagarakertagama, dating from circa 1365. According to the author of the poem, the strait between Java and Madura, which originally were supposedly a single island, was formed in 202 as a result of a powerful earthquake. This version does not have any scientific confirmation. Culture and economic importance Tanjung Perak The Madura Strait coastal community, like other coastal communities also has coastal culture, one of its cultures, is when every specific date, based on the Islamic calendar, is held a tradition called Pethik Laut, which is in the form of releasing offerings carried together and released to middle of the beach. The majority of the people's livelihoods throughout the Madura Strait coastline are fishermen and salt farmers, even the strait coastal area is also one of the largest salt producers in Indonesia. The Madura Strait is also used as an object of tourism, industry and transportation. One of power plant industries, namely PLTU Paiton, is located on the coast of the strait, namely in the Paiton sub-district, Probolinggo Regency and is one of the largest power plants on the island of Java. Tourism objects on the Madura Strait coast, including the famous ones are Kenjeran Beach in Surabaya, Bentar Beach in Probolinggo District, and Pasir Putih Beach in Situbondo Regency. Sea transportation facilities are ferry boats, which connect the Madura Strait on two lines, namely the connecting line Ujung Port (Surabaya) with the Port of Kamal (Bangkalan, Madura), and the connecting line Kalianget Port (Sumenep, Madura) with Pelabuhan Jangkar (Situbondo, East Java ) Other transportation facilities, namely the Suramadu Bridge is a means of land transportation connecting Java-Madura and has a very large impact on the economy of the two islands.

The regiment also has an ammunition inspectorate role supporting the Inspector Explosives (Army). With headquarters in Didcot, the Regiment has sub units geographically based throughout the UK to provide a nationwide high readiness response capability in support of the police. History The regiment's history commences in the period immediately after World War II. At the time, the regional Commands HQs across the UK established Ammunition Inspectorates to oversee the drawdown of the vast stockpiles of ammunition in numerous sub depots across the country, much of it was still stocked alongside many of the roads in the countryside. These Command Ammunition Inspectorates, Northern Command, Southern Command etc. were eventually grouped into one unit, 1 Ammunition Inspection and Disposal Unit RAOC, (1 Ammo IDU) which formed on 15 March 1972 at Old Sarum in Wiltshire. In April 1982, 1 Ammo IDU became 11 Ordnance Battalion (EOD) and was relocated to Didcot. Some 11 years later the battalion was retitled to 11 EOD Regiment RLC following the formation of the RLC on 5 April 1993. In June 2018 the Regiment was renamed to 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Search Regiment RLC in recognition of the importance of Search within the Explosive Ordnance Disposal community. Role The unit is responsible for providing EOD (Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (IEDD), Conventional Munitions Disposal (CMD), Biological and Chemical Munitions Disposal (BCMD) and Radiological and Nuclear Munitions Disposal) and Ammunition Technical support to Defence and Other Government Departments in order to support Land Forces Command Capability on UK mainland (Great Britain & Northern Ireland) and overseas.

Due to its long and close association with the town, the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Didcot on 17 September 2007 and were conferred \\"the honour and distinction of exercising all customary Regimental Privileges when parading in or marching through the Town of Didcot\\". The Regiment exercised its right to march through the town of Didcot on 22 September 2007 led by the Commanding Officer Lt Col RL Maybery QGM RLC. On 19 November 2010, in a ceremony at Didcot Parkway railway station, a High Speed Train locomotive, no. 43087 operated by Great Western Railway (FGW), was named 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment Royal Logistic Corps. The ceremony was attended by Lt Col Gareth Bex (Commanding Officer); soldiers of the Regiment; Mark Hopwood, of FGW; Keith Mitchell, leader of the county council; and the MP for Wantage, Ed Vaizey. On 15 March 2018 the regiment were awarded the Firmin Sword of Peace, one of the highest accolades that can be bestowed upon a military unit.

Hinds, Douglas Dumbrille, Morris Ankrum, and directed by Arthur Lubin. The film focuses on Abbott and Costello as they play the role of two peanut vendors on the run from their boss. Despite their lack of knowledge in the trade, they get jobs as cowboys on a dude ranch. The film is set in the West. Plot The author of best-selling western novels, Bronco Bob Mitchell (Dick Foran), has never set foot in the west. A newspaper article has exposed this fact to his fans, and his image is suffering because of it. He decides to make an appearance at a Long Island charity rodeo to bolster his image. When a steer escapes while he is riding a horse nearby, he is thrown. Not knowing what to do, a cowgirl, Anne Shaw (Anne Gwynne), comes to his rescue and saves his life by bulldogging the steer. During the rescue, she is injured and cannot compete and loses her chance to obtain the $10,000 prize. Although Bob is grateful, she quickly becomes angry due to his city slicker hotshot personality and returns to her father's dude ranch in Arizona. Bob follows her with the hopes of making amends, and actually learns how to be a real cowboy. Meanwhile, Willoughby (Lou Costello) and Duke (Bud Abbott) are vendors at the rodeo. They are not very good at their job, and soon cause enough havoc that they hide from their boss. Their hiding place winds up being a cattle car and they soon find themselves on their way out west. When they arrive, Willoughby accidentally shoots an arrow into an Indian tepee. Custom says that this is a proposal, but Willoughby and Duke soon run in fear when the Indian maiden inside the tent turns out to be plump and unattractive. They wind up at the same Dude ranch that Anne and Bob are at, and soon given jobs by the foreman, Alabam (Johnny Mack Brown). Anne concedes and begins to instruct Bob on the ways of cowboy life, while Willoughby and Duke are still menaced by the Indians. Eventually Anne decides that Bob has improved enough to enter him on their team at the state rodeo championship. Unfortunately a gambler, Ace Henderson (Morris Ankrum), has made large bets against the ranch and has his gang kidnap Bob and Alabam. Willoughby and Duke unwittingly come to the rescue while they are running from the Indians, and everyone returns to the rodeo in time. Bob, finally a true cowboy, rides a bronco long enough to win the championship. The Indians catch up to Willoughby there, but as a joke, his bride turns out to be Duke. Music and Dance Ella Fitzgerald, in her first screen role, plays Ruby, who fills several roles as one of the employees of the ranch. At the opening rodeo, she is dressed as a rodeo clown, and comes to Anne's side when she is hurt. Later in the film, she can be seen removing an apron before singing. Ella sings \\"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\\" in the bus, as the ranch crew drives from the railway station to the ranch. Ruby and the other employees interact playfully during the song. Musical numbers were staged by Nick Castle.IMDB entry Cast Production Ride 'Em Cowboy was filmed from June 30-August 9, 1941 on location at both the B-Bar A and the Rancho Chihuahua dude ranches.Furmanek, Bob and Ron Palumbo (1991).

The name Allegheny is sometimes spelled Alleghany. It is an evergreen subshrub, growing to at most 30 cm high, usually less. The leaves are 5‚Äì10 cm long, with a coarsely toothed margin. The flowers are small, white, produced several together on a terminal raceme 2‚Äì3 cm long.  Description  Pachysandra procumbens is a shrubby ground cover which grows 8-12\\" tall and spreads indefinitely by rhizomes to form a dense carpet of matte blue-green leaves mottled with purple and white. It is native to woodlands from North Carolina and Kentucky south to Florida and Texas. Ovate to suborbicular leaves (to 3\\" long) are coarsely toothed at the apex but untoothed at the base. Leaves are typically deciduous in USDA Zones 5 and 6 but semi-evergreen to evergreen in Zones 7 to 9. Even where evergreen, the leaves may appear worn and tattered by mid winter. Tiny, fragrant, greenish white to white flowers bloom in terminal spikes (2-4\\" long) in early spring before the new leaves arrive. Genus name comes is in reference to the male parts of the flower (thick stamens). Specific epithet from Latin means trailing in reference to the rhizomatous ground cover habit. It spreads slowly to form a dense carpet 8-10‚Äù tall. Allegheny pachysandra performs well in a variety of soils from moist to dry and a range of soil pH as long as it is growing in partial to full shade. This woodland plant is also considered by many to be very deer and drought resistant.

At age 13 he began to study under Higaonna Kanry≈ç until Higaonna's death 4 years later. Higaonna had three students at the time: Juhatsu Kyoda (1887-1968), Chojun Miyagi (1888-1953), and Seko Higa (1898-1966). Kyoda went on to create his style, To'on Ryu, and Miyagi assumed the mantle of Higaonna's legacy. Higa, a policeman at the time, continued his studies with Miyagi Ch≈çjun for 38 years until Miyagi's death. In 1931, Higa retired from the police force and opened his dojo in the Kumoji section of Naha. Only three students of Miyagi's were allowed to open a dojo while the master was still alive: Seko Higa, Jin'an Shinzato, and Jinsei Kamiya. In 1935, Higa went to the island of Saipan to teach Goju-ryu at the request of a friend. The move was not successful and Higa returned to Okinawa two years later. Among Higa's students were Choboku Takamine, his son Seikichi Higa (who carried on his father's dojo in Okinawa), Kanki Izumigawa who spread Goju-Ryu in mainland Japan Kawasaki area, Seiichi Akamine (creator of the Ken-Shin-Kan, spread Karate-do in South America). Seikichi Toguchi (creator of the Shoreikan), Zenshu Toyama (creator of the Shinjikan), Choyu Kiyuna, Seitoku Matayoshi, Seiko Fukuchi (1919-1975), Eiki Kurashita, Zensei Gushiken, Izumi, Hokama Tetsuhiro and others that carried on the Goju-ryu Kokusai Karate Kobudo Renmei. The Goju-ryu Kokusai Karate Kobudo Renmei (\\"Goju-ryu International Karate Kobudo Federation\\") is a tightly knit organization founded by Seko Higa and run with corporate efficiency with a president, vice-president, and secretary. Its first president was Seiko Higa himself, who ran it from 1960 to 1966. The next president was Uemon Tetsuo, who ran it from 1966 to 1967; the third generation was Takamine Choboku, who held office from 1967 to 1989. Higa's son, Sekichi, was president in 1990. The fifth-generation president was Eiki Kurashita until 2007. Zensei Gushiken took office in 2008. He held his office till 2019 when Akira Gushi was appointed to be the current president of the Renmei. True to its name and to the founder's vision, Higa's Federation is international in scope: it has branch dojos in Japan, Hong Kong, France, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Russia and North America. In recent years branch directors (Shibucho) were appointed in Canada (Yaro Tarana), Czech Republic (Mirek Brokes) and Slovakia (Erik Stefak).

One of the largest museums in Amsterdam, the museum accommodates eight permanent exhibitions and an ongoing series of temporary exhibitions, including modern and traditional visual arts and photographic works. The Tropenmuseum is part of the Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen (Museum of World Cultures), a combination of three ethnographic museums in the Netherlands. History Frederick van Eeden, father of the writer Frederik van Eeden, and secretary of the Maatschappij ter bevordering van Nijverheid () established the Koloniaal Museum () in Haarlem in 1864, and opened the museum to the public in 1871. The museum was founded in order to show Dutch overseas possessions, and the inhabitants of these foreign countries, such as Indonesia. In 1871 the institute began research to increase profits made off the colonies. This included attempting to develop improved means of producing coffee beans, rotan and paraffin. The museum came under the influence of ethnologists, who added information on the economy, manners, and customs of the inhabitants. In 1926, they inaugurated the current building in East Amsterdam. At the time, they had 30,000 objects, and a sizable collection of photographs. Following the independence of Indonesia in 1945, the scope of the museum changed from just the colonial possessions of the Netherlands, to that of many undeveloped colonial states in South America, Africa, and Asia. In the 1960s and 1970s the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs encouraged the museum to expand its scope to more social issues such as poverty and hunger. In the early 1970s a new wing for children was added. This wing is now called Tropenmuseum Junior. Until March 2014 the museum was owned and operated by the Royal Tropical Institute, a foundation that sponsored the study of tropical cultures around the world. The museum had 176,000 visitors in 2009.

Facility The original building, built in 1926, was designed by Johannes Jacobus van Nieukerken and Marie Adrianus van Nieukerken. It was richly decorated for the time, and took 11 years to build due to World War I and various labor strikes. All of the artwork in the building was created in the first half of the 20th century. In 2003, the museum was listed as a historical building in Amsterdam. Collections Clove model of a two-wheeled horse-drawn coach with coachman. The museum houses 175,000 objects, 155,000 photographs and 10,000 miscellaneous drawings, paintings, and documents. It inherited 15,000 of these from the Ethnographisch Museum Artis. These objects are split up into many collections. The museum houses collections for many geographical areas such as Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia & North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. They also have several collections in storage that fall outside of their scope. These include collections for China, Japan, Korea, and Europe. The photography collection consists mainly of historical photographs of the former Dutch Colonies from 1855‚Äì1940.

This musical united Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey as a comedy team and made them famous. It premiered on Broadway on February 2, 1927, at the new Ziegfeld Theatre and, after moving to the Lyric Theatre and Majestic Theatre, closed on April 7, 1928 after 494 performances, a very long run for its time. In Sydney, Gladys Moncrieff appeared in a successful production at the St James Theatre. The musical premiered in London's West End on April 3, 1930, at the then newly opened Prince Edward Theatre. The musical was made into a film in 1929, Rio Rita, starring Bebe Daniels and John Boles along with the team of Wheeler & Woolsey. Based on the success of this film, Wheeler & Woolsey were also given contracts to star in a series of comedies. Another film based on the musical was made in 1942.  Background  Rio Rita may be said to be one of the last, great, \\"light musical comedies\\" or \\"Follies-based\\" type of musical. With the introduction of Show Boat, later in 1927‚Äîas well as the subsequent introduction of George Gershwin's musicals that year and through the early 1930s‚Äîthe American musical became much more a dramatically cohesive \\"musical play\\". This form reached its maturity in the Rodgers and Hammerstein productions, beginning with Oklahoma! and culminating with South Pacific. Synopsis The captain of the Texas Rangers, Jim Stewart, is in San Lucar Mexico on the Rio Grande, in disguise in order to catch the notorious bandit Kinkajou. While there, he falls in love with Rita Ferguson, an Irish-American-Mexican girl who sings in the local hotel after being displaced, along with her brother, from her family ranch. General Esteban, the Governor of the San Lucar District, also loves Rita and hates all gringos. He hatches a plot to set Jim and Rita at odds by making Rita doubt both her own brother, who may be the Kinkajou, and Jim, who may be spying on her brother through her. Amid all of this intrigue, Chick Bean, a soap salesman, and Dolly, an American cabaret girl, arrive in San Lucar and get married. Unbeknownst to Dolly, Chick also went to Mexico to obtain a quick divorce from his unfaithful first wife, Katie. But then hours after Chick and Dolly are wed, Ed Lovett, a lawyer of dubious reputation, informs Chick that his divorce is not recognized by the U.S. Government. Complications ensue.

It is used in opposition to the term \\"authors' rights\\". Neighbouring rights is a more literal translation of the original French droits voisins. Both authors' rights and related rights are copyrights in the sense of English or U.S. law. Related rights vary much more widely in scope between different countries than authors' rights. The rights of performers, phonogram producers and broadcasting organisations are certainly covered, and are internationally protected by the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations signed in 1961. Within the European Union, the rights of film producers (as opposed to directors) and database creators are also protected by related rights, and the term is sometimes extended to include the sui generis rights in semiconductor topologies and other industrial design rights. A practical definition is that related rights are copyright-type rights that are not covered by the Berne Convention. International protection of related rights Apart from the Rome convention, a number of other treaties address the protection of related rights: * Convention for the Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized Duplication of Their Phonograms (Geneva Phonograms Convention, 1971) * Convention Relating to the Distribution of Programme‚ÄìCarrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (Brussels Convention, 1974) * Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits (IPIC Treaty, 1989) * Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS, 1994) * WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT, 1996) Apart from the TRIPS Agreement, these treaties cannot truly be described as global: the Rome Convention had 83 signatories as of 2006, compared with 162 for the Berne Convention. Relation to authors' rights Related rights are independent of any authors' rights, as is made clear in the various treaties (Art. 1 Rome; Art. 7.1 Geneva; Art. 1.2 WPPT). Hence a CD recording of a song is concurrently protected by four copyright-type rights: * Authors' rights of the composer of the music * Authors' rights of the lyricist * Performers' rights of the singer and musicians * Producers' rights of the person or corporation that made the recording Performers The protection of performers is perhaps the strongest and most unified of the related rights. A performer (musician, actor, etc.) has an intellectual input in their performance over and above that of the author of the work. As such, many countries grant moral rights to performers as well as the economic rights covered by the Rome Convention (Arts. 7-9), and the rights of paternity and integrity are required by the WPPT (Art. 5). Performers' rights should not be confused with performing rights, which are the royalties due to the composer for a piece of music under copyright in return for the licence (permission) to perform the piece in public. In other words, performers must pay performing rights to composers. Under the Rome Convention (Art. 7), performers have the right to prevent: * the broadcast or communication to the public of their performance, unless this is made from a legally published recording of the performance; * the fixation (recording) of their performance; * the reproduction of a recording of their performance. The WPPT extends these rights to include the right to license: * the distribution of recordings of their performance, for sale or other transfer of ownership (Art. 8); * the rental of recordings of their performances, unless there is a compulsory licence scheme in operation (Art. 9); * the \\"making available to the public\\" of their performances (Art. 10), in effect their publication on the internet. Article 14 of the Rome Convention set a minimum term for the protection of performers' rights of twenty years from the end of the year in which the performance was made: the TRIPS Agreement (Art. 14.5) has extended this to fifty years. In the European Union, performers' rights last for fifty years from the end of the year of the performance, unless a recording of the performance was published in which case they last for fifty years from the end of the year of publication (Art. 3(100 } In the United States, there is no federal statutory right in unfixed works such as performances, and no federal exclusive right to record a performance; some states, notably California, have performer rights laws, but as of 1988 these remain untested.  Performers rights in the United States of America  The US Copyright Statute does not explicitly recognize a copyright that is vested in the performer for their work. Therefore as a matter of statutory law, a performer, being either an actor, dancer, sportsperson or musician cannot claim a separate copyright. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Garcia v. Google however found that the absence of a statutory provision conferring an independent copyright on the performance did not imply that performances were not entitled to a protection. The Court observed that if the originality threshold, as was enunciated by the SCOTUS in Feist was met, then such original performances be in musical, dramatic or other performances were entitled to copyright, if they were themselves not unauthorized or otherwise infringing.Garcia v. Google, 786 F.3d 733 (9th Cir. 2015) at 1264. It is important to note that Court did not consider the fact that the performance of a work was itself a covered right under copyright to be repugnant with the conclusion that performers could enjoy copyright protection.See Smith J.'s Dissenting Opinion, Garcia v. Google, 786 F.3d 733 (9th Cir. 2015) at 1270 for the contrary view. Despite the recognition of copyrights in performances, the US, for various stated reasons, Bonnie Teller, Note, Toward Better Protection of Performers in the United States: A Comparative Look at Performers‚Äô Rights in the United States, Under the Rome Convention And in France, 28 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 775 (1990) is still not Party to the Rome Convention. Unlike many other Trade Agreements, the Rome Convention allows for reciprocity Article 16(1)(a), Rome Convention and the failure of the US to ratify the Rome Convention has disentitled various American performers to copyright protection in other jurisdictions. The US does not explicitly recognize the related rights as a distinct category of copyright protection. As a consequence a host of remedies that would be available under the Copyright Statutes in different jurisdictions are sought through other common law remedies.  Fixation of Live Performances  Remedies for unauthorized fixation of performances are sought under the common law right of publicity. Haelan Laboratories, Inc. v. Topps Chewing Gum, 202 F.2d 866 (2d Cir. 1953) The SCOTUS in Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co ruled that the Ohio State Legislation gave an individual the right to possess autonomy over the dissemination of their performance. Accordingly the Court held that the unauthorized recording and live telecasting of an individual's \\"human cannonball\\" performance was in violation of the right of publicity. It is important to note that this did not imply an unambiguous Performer's Right as the Court found that the unauthorized performance of the Plaintiff's entire work, in the absence of fair remuneration, was the only situation in which the Performer's \\"right to publicity\\" was violated. Zacchini v. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co., 433 U.S. 562 (1977) at 574-575 It therefore remains to be seen whether the fixation of a portion of the performance would violate such a right. While the source of the right was founded in the law of unfair trade practices, Courts in the United States have found that the doctrine of Fair Use nevertheless applied to the fixation of live performances. Accordingly in Italian Book Company v. ABC Italian Book Co. v. ABC, 458 F. Supp. 65 (S.D.N.Y. 1978). it was observed that small portions of live performances that were captured to communicate the mood and feel of an event were protected as it was fair use of the live performances.  Unauthorized reproduction of fixed performances  It must firstly be noted that in the United States, the work for hire doctrine disentitles performers who act under a contract of employment from possessing an entitlement to work in which their performance is fixed. Consequently, such performers may not assert a copyright over their performance that is distinct from the copyright in the work that their performance was fixed in. The decision of the Court of Appeal for the 2nd Circuit in Baltimore Orioles, Inc held that the performance of baseball players were not protected as being a distinct copyright and rather, that they were works for hire. Nevertheless, certain State Governments have enacted statutes that explicitly recognize the right against sales and reproductions of fixed performances that were unauthorized. For example the New York Civil Code was relied upon in Giesking Giesking v. Urania Records,155 N.Y.S.2d 171 (1956) to preserve the rights of a musician against unauthorized reproduction. Finally, as regard sound recordings, owing to Section 114 owners of copyrights in sound recordings do not have a right to prohibit the performance of their works (except in so far as demanding nominal remuneration for the same). Therefore the performances that are contained in the recording are not protected either. This position has however received staunch criticism. Bard & Kurlantzick, A Public Performance Right in Recordings: How to Alter the Copyright System Without Improving It, 43 GEO. WASH. L. REv. 152 (1974)  Unauthorized imitations of live performances  Another issue that merits mention in this context is the unauthorized featuring of popular persons, actors or the characters they have portrayed and voices of popular singers. While no remedy has been found within the statutory copyright regime, remedies have been granted under a common law right. For instance, in Milder v Ford Milder v Ford Motor Co., 849 F.2d 460 (9th Cir. 1988) the 9th Circuit observed that she had a \\"common law property right to her own voice\\".  Unauthorized recording or transmission of live musical performances  Of further note is the anti-bootlegging provision that was incorporated into the US Copyright Statute17 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101(c) (1994) by way of amendment in order to ensure consistency with the TRIPS Agreement. This provision, while not recognizing the existence of a copyright, nevertheless proscribes the unauthorized recording or transmission of performances of live musical works in sound recordings or videos, or transmitting such copies. US regime provides for various kinds of protection of the rights of performers, it however is a complicated regime that is highly dependent on State laws and is far from being harmonized and consolidated like other regimes in Continental Europe.  Performers rights in India  Performer's right has been defined in India as \\"where a performer appears or engages in any performance, he shall have a right known as the 'performer‚Äôs right' in relation to such performance\\".Section 38, The Copyright Act, 1957 The term performance has been used to refer to ‚Äúany visual or acoustic presentation made live by one or more performers‚Äù.Section 2(q), The Copyright Act, 1957 In relation to the performance, a 'performer' has been sought to include \\"an actor, singer, musician, dancer, acrobat, juggler, conjurer, snake charmer, a person delivering a lecture or any other person who makes a performance\\".S.2(qq), The Copyright Act, 1957 Provisions regarding the violation of the Performer's rights as per the 2012 amendment are prescriptive in nature. It lays down the exclusive rights of the performer in relation to the performance. However, once the performer consents to the incorporation of his performance in a cinematograph film he will have no right regarding the incorporated performance.Indian Performing Rights Society v Eastern India Motion Pictures 1977 SCR (3) 206 Section 2(q) of the Act which defines a performance states that, in relation to performer's right, a performance must be made 'live'. However, a live performance has not been separately defined.  Judicial approach towards performer‚Äôs rights- Cinematograph and entertainment industry  = Indian Performing Rights Society v Eastern India Motion Pictures Association = IPRS v EIMPA dealt with whether the work incorporated in the sound track of a cinematograph film vests in the composer of that musical work or whether it became the property of the cinematograph film producers with no copyright subsisting in them, if the composers were engaged under a contract of service. It was held that with respect to the musical work incorporated in the sound track of the film, the copyright in a cinematograph film or a record does not affect the separate copyright in any work in respect of which or a substantial part of which, the film, or as the case may be, the record is made.Indian Performing Rights Society v Eastern India Motion Pictures 1977 SCR (3) 206 However, the film producer acquires, on completion of the cinematograph film, a copyright which gives him the exclusive right inter alia of performing the work in public i.e. to cause the film in so far as it consists of visual images to be seen in public and in so far as it consists of the acoustic portion including a lyric or a musical work to be heard in public without securing any further permission of the author (composer) of the lyric or a musical work for the performance of the work in public.Indian Performing Rights Society v Eastern India Motion Pictures 1977 SCR (3) 206 In other words, a distinct copyright in the aforesaid circumstances comes to vest in the cinematograph film as a whole. Furthermore, it was observed by Justice Krishna Iyer that while a composer has a copyright in the musical work, the singer has none.Indian Performing Rights Society v Eastern India Motion Pictures 1977 SCR (3) 206 = Fortune Films v Dev Anand = In Fortune Films v Dev Anand the Court had to decide whether an artiste's work in the film would be entitled to protection as falling within the definition of a \\"work\\" protected by copyright. It was observed by the Court that the artiste's performance does not constitute either an artistic work or a dramatic work as conceptualized under the Act.Fortune Films International v Dev Anand AIR 1979 Bom 17 The Act does not recognize the performance of an actor as constituting a 'work' which is subject to protection under the Copyright Act.AIR 1979 Bom 17 However, the position has changed with the recognition of performer's rights via an amendment in 1994.Sagar, Entertainment Media and IP Rights = Neha Bhasin v Anand Raj = This case addressed the question of what would constitute a ‚Äòlive performance‚Äô . The Court observed that ‚ÄúEvery performance has to be live in the first instance whether it is before an audience or in a studio. If this performance is recorded and thereafter exploited without the permission of the performer, then the performer‚Äôs right is infringed.‚Äù2006 (32) PTC 779 Del = Super Cassettes Industries v Bathla Cassette Industries = In this case the issue was whether by performing/singing a song which has already been written down and performed, gives the new singer any exclusive rights over the underlying song. It was held that in such a scenario, the performer himself does not have any rights over the underlying song and hence cannot restrain others from performing that song.2003 VIIIAD Delhi 572  Exclusive rights of performers  The performer has been granted the exclusive rights of making a sound recording or a visual recording of the performance.S.38A, The Copyright Act, 1957 This right of the performer extends to reproducing the performance in any material form including storing of it in any medium, issuing the copies of the performance to the public, communicating it to the public, selling or giving on commercial rental or offer for sale of any copy of the recording; communicating or broadcasting the performance to the public except where it has already been broadcast.S.38A, The Copyright Act (1957)  Acts not infringing the performer's rights  A performer‚Äôs right is not infringed by any adaptation or modification which does not constitute copyright violation under section 52. Moreover, any recording, whether in the sound or visual form, done solely for personal use or for teaching or research purposes does not violate performers right. Also, any use of the performance, whether in the form of broadcast, reporting, bona fide review, teaching or research etc, which is consistent with the fair dealing does not constitute the violation of performers right.  Moral rights of performers  In addition to the exclusive right of exploitation of the performance, the performer has also enjoys certain moral rights. The performer has \\"the right to be identified as the performer of his performance\\"S.38B(a), The Copyright Act, 1957; and \\"to restrain or claim damage in respect of any distortion, mutilation or other modification of his performance that would be prejudicial to his reputation\\".S.38B(b), The Copyright Act, 1957 Phonogram producers The term phonogram is used to refer to any sound recording: under the Rome Convention, it must be composed exclusively of a sound recording, although some national laws protect film soundtracks with the same measures to the extent that they are not also protected by other rights. The producers of phonograms, that is the person who makes the recording rather than the person who performs, has the right to prevent the direct or indirect reproduction of the recording (Art. 10 Rome Convention, Art. 2 Geneva Phonograms Convention). The WPPT adds the rights to license: * the distribution of their phonograms, for sale or other transfer of ownership (Art. 12); * the rental of their phonograms, unless there is a compulsory licence scheme in operation (Art. 13); * the \\"making available to the public\\" of their phonograms (Art. 14), in effect their publication on the internet. Once a phonogram has been published, the producer cannot prevent its broadcast: an equitable fee for the licence may be either agreed between phonogram producers and broadcasters or imposed by law. The Rome and Geneva Phonograms Conventions specify a maximum level of formality required for protection of the phonogram (Art. 11 Rome; Art. 5 Geneva): countries are free to set a lower level, or not to require formalities at all. The maximum conditions are that each copy of the phonogram should be clearly marked with: * the symbol (P), that is a capital P within a circle; followed by * the year of first publication; * the name of the owner or exclusive licensee of the producers' rights; * for Rome Convention countries only, the name of the person who owns (the licence in) the performers' rights in the country where the recording was made. Countries signing the WPPT shall not require any formality for the protection of producers' rights. The Conventions (Art. 14 Rome; Art. 4 Geneva) set a minimum term of protection of producers' rights of twenty years from the end of the year in which the phonogram was first published (or from its creation for unpublished recordings): the TRIPS Agreement (Art. 14.5) extended this minimum to fifty years from the end of the year in which the recording was made. The term of protection in the European Union is fifty years from the end of the year in which the phonogram was first published, or from the end of the year of its creation for unpublished recordings (Art. 3(2), Directive 93/98/EEC). For phonograms recorded in the United States the situation is more complicated: * recordings made before 1972-02-15: these are covered by state, not federal, copyright law, although all rights will end on 2067-02-15 at the latest [17 U.S.C. ¬ß301(c)]; * recordings made between 1972-02-15 and 1977-12-31 and published: ninety-five years from the date of publication [17 U.S.C. ¬ß303(a)]; * recordings made and published on or after 1978-01-01: ninety-five years after the date of recording if the recording was made \\"for hire\\", seventy years after the death of the producer otherwise [17 U.S.C. ¬ß302(a), (c)]; * recordings made on or after 1972-02-15 and unpublished: 120 years after the date of recording if the recording was made \\"for hire\\", seventy years after the death of the producer otherwise [17 U.S.C. ¬ß302(a), (c)].  Broadcasting organisations  Article 13 of the Rome Convention specifies that broadcasting organisations shall have the right to prohibit (or license): * the rebroadcasting of their broadcasts; * the fixation (recording) of their broadcasts; * the reproduction of fixations of their broadcasts; * the communication of their broadcasts to the public in places where an entrance fee is charged. Article 14 of the Rome Convention sets a minimum term for the protection of broadcasters' rights of twenty years from the end of the year in which the broadcast was first made, confirmed by the TRIPS Agreement (Art. 14.5). However, the Rome Convention is limited to broadcasts intended for the public [Art. 3(f)]: the Brussels Convention closes this loophole by providing for protection of satellite broadcasts not intended for direct public reception. In the European Union, broadcasters' rights last for fifty years from the end of the year the broadcast was first made (Art. 3(4), Directive 93/98/EEC). Film producers Directive 2006/115/EC and Directive 2001/29/EC provide rights to producers of the first fixation (\\"master copy\\") of a film or other audiovisual work under European Union law. These rights, similar to the rights of phonogram producers, are especially important in Europe, where the producer is not usually the initial owner of the copyright in the film itself. Film producers have the right to prevent: * the direct or indirect reproduction of the film (either the master copy or copies thereof) (Art. 2, Directive 2001/29/EC); * the distribution of the film (or copies thereof) to the public for sale (Art. 9, Directive 92/100/EEC); * the \\"making available to the public\\" of the film (Art 3, Directive 2001/29/EC). These rights last for fifty years from the end of the year the film was first published or otherwise made available to the public, or for fifty years from the end of the year the master copy was made if the film is not released (Art. 3(3), Directive 93/98/EEC). Database creators Directive 96/9/EC creates a sui generis protection in the European Union for databases that do not meet the criterion of originality for copyright protection. This is particularly important for databases that aim to be complete, as these lack the element of selection that might qualify them for protection as \\"compilations\\" under Article 2.5 of the Berne Convention (although their arrangement can still be considered creative). It is specifically intended to protect \\"the investment of considerable human, technical and financial resources\\" in creating databases (para. 7 of the preamble), whereas the copyright laws of many Member States specifically exclude effort and labour from the criteria for copyright protection. To qualify, the database must show \\"qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents\\" [Art. 7(1)]. Their creators have the right \\"to prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part, evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively, of the contents of that database.\\" This is taken to include the repeated extraction of insubstantial parts of the contents if this conflicts with the normal exploitation of the database or unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the creator of the database [Art. 7(5)]. Database rights last for fifteen years from completion of the database (the point when the criterion of substantial investment is fulfilled), or from *the date when the database is publicly available, whichever is later. The protection period runs until 31 December of the year when it expires. If there is a \\"substantial change\\" in the database that qualifies as a \\"substantial new investment\\", a new protection period is granted (Art. 10). Photographers Each new technology for creative work has led to debate over what protection should be accorded to such works, as has been the case most recently for software copyright and database rights. Similar debates occurred over the copyright protection of photographs. The Berne Convention allows a shorter period of protection than for other works (twenty-five years from creation rather than fifty years post mortem auctoris, Art. 7.4), and many countries apply a different period of copyright protection to photographs than to other works. An alternative approach, adopted notably by Germany and Italy, has been to offer full copyright protection to photographs that are clearly \\"artistic works\\" and protect all photographs, whatever their creative value, by a shorter sui generis related right. This focuses the debate on those photographs that still have value at the end of the sui generis protection (no-one would bother to try to protect photographs without value), which are the photographs most likely original. However it also means that photographs are subject to a higher test of originality than other works of art, with copyright being reserved only for those the courts felt to be particularly meritorious, in contravention of the spirit (if not the letter) of the Berne Convention. The sui generis protections are found at ¬ß 72, UrhG for Germany (50 years) and Arts. 87-92, Legge 22 aprile 1941 n. 633 for Italy (20 years). The different treatment of photographs and other artistic works was eliminated by European Union Directive 93/98/EEC (Art. 6), which states that the only applicable criterion for copyright protection is that the photograph be \\"original in the sense that they are the author's own intellectual creation\\", a lower criterion than used until then, but equivalent to the criterion used for other copyright works. The sui generis protection may be retained for photographs that do not meet this criterion (e.g., photographs taken automatically such as for a passport). Designers Design rights fall between copyright and patent law: they are sometimes considered to be industrial property and sometimes a related right to copyright. The Berne Convention requires the protection of \\"applied art\\", but allows a shorter protection period of twenty-five years after creation. Although it requires protection to the same minimum standards as for copyright, the Convention does not require that the protection be called \\"copyright\\", a fact used by many countries to protect applied art and certain artistic designs by a related design right. In countries where applied art can be protected by normal copyright term (e.g., Germany), an extremely high level of originality and creativity is demanded. Insofar as designs are considered to be industrial property, their international protection falls under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. Semiconductor designers A common sui generis design right protects the design or topography of semiconductor materials, particularly integrated circuits. These are protected internationally by the IPIC Treaty of 1989, (see Integrated circuit layout design protection), and in the European Union by Directive 87/54/EEC. The reproduction of a protected topography is prohibited, as is the import of infringing materials (Art. 5). Protected topographies may be identified by a capital T in a variety of forms, including T* (Art. 9). The exclusive rights of the designer last for ten years from the first commercial exploitation, or for fifteen years from the first creation for topographies that are not exploited (Art. 7).

The Regiment delivers training from two locations: Marlborough Barracks, MoD Kineton near Kineton, Warwickshire and St George's Barracks, MoD Bicester, near Bicester, Oxfordshire. History In 2009 the Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Munitions and Search School (DEMSS) was formed, bringing together the School of Ammunition, the Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal School and the National Search Centre, initially as DEMSS (North), at Kineton, and DEMSS (South), at Chattenden, Kent. DEMSS was renamed DEMS Training Regiment in December 2012 when the Chattenden facility was closed and relocated to new premises at Bicester, only 30 miles from Kineton, in order to 'enable closer and more integrated training across all disciplines taught at DEMSS'. Each of the schools coming together to form the Regiment have a history that encompasses a number of sites in the UK, with ammunition management having been the preserve of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (later amalgamated into the Royal Logistic Corps) and Bomb Disposal having been the responsibility of the Royal Engineers since the Second World War. The education and training to support this requirement has been delivered from: Army School of Ammunition Army School of Ammunition, Bramley An element of the Training Establishment, Royal Army Ordnance Corps was established in 1922 at Bramley Central Ammunition Depot, a site established during the First World War to manufacture and store ammunition. Known for a time as 'B wing', it was placed under direct specialist control in 1950 and renamed the Army School of Ammunition. Marlborough Barracks, near Kineton A Base Ammunition Depot was built at Temple Herdewyke, near Kineton, in 1942. The Army School of Ammunition moved from Bramley to Kineton in 1974, as the former site became too small for the munitions natures being developed at the time. Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal School School of Military Engineering, Ripon The Royal School of Military Engineering was based in Chatham, Kent, but during the Second World War was split into two training Battalions, one of which was located at Harper Barracks (later Claro Barracks), Ripon, North Yorkshire. This site was identified as a home for the School of Bomb Disposal, formed in 1941, and reflecting the nomination of the Royal Engineers as being responsible for the discipline. Joint Service Bomb Disposal School, Broadbridge Heath The Joint Service Bomb Disposal School at Broadbridge Heath in West Sussex closed in 1966 and training moved to Lodge Hill, Chattenden, Kent. DEODS Lodge Hill The Royal School of Military Engineering took over the former Royal Naval Armaments Depots at Chattenden and Lodge Hill Military Camps in 1961. Both these adjacent sites became training areas for the relocated Joint Service Bomb Disposal School (renamed the Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal School), which opened its new premises in Lodge Hill Camp in 1966. It shared its site and facilities with the National Search Centre, a joint Ministry of Defence/Home Office facility which provided specialist search and counter-terrorism training for the police and civil agencies. Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Munitions and Search School The combined Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Munitions and Search School (DEMSS) was set up in 2009, bringing activity at Kineton (which became DEMSS (North)) and Lodge Hill (DEMSS (South)) together under the same command. At the time, DEMSS (North) focused on munitions management training and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (IEDD) training, whilst DEMSS (South) focused on Conventional Munitions Disposal training, search training and Biological and Chemical Munitions Disposal training. DEMSS (South) moved to Bicester in 2013; the Lodge Hill site was put up for sale in 2016. Organisation and training DEMS Training Regiment delivers a number of courses to students from the Royal Navy, British Army, Royal Air Force, civilian bodies in government and to international partners. Four training squadrons deliver courses with munitions, search and conventional munitions or Explosive Ordnance Disposal at DEMSS South and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal at DEMSS North. Regimental HQ is based at Bicester, with two training wings at Bicester and two at Kineton. The four training squadrons are: *Munitions Wing - All aspects of academic elements of munitions theory, maintenance, storage, accounting, investigation processes and logistic disposal. *Conventional Munitions Disposal Wing - Disposal of unexploded ordnance and remnants of war *Specialist Search Wing - Location and identification of emplaced devices and concealed contraband material *Improvised Explosive Device Disposal Wing - All aspects of Improvised explosive device disposal in controlled and hostile environment References External links Category:Bicester Category:Education in Oxfordshire Category:Education in Warwickshire Category:Explosive ordnance disposal units and formations Category:Royal Logistic Corps Category:Stratford-on-Avon District Category:Training establishments of the British Army ","title":"Defence Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Munitions and Search Training Regiment"},{"id":"7148148","text":"Ramil Kamilevich Aritkulov (, born 1 March 1978) is a Russian middle distance runner who specializes in the 800 metres.

Description  The speckled mousebird is about 35 cm (14 inches) long, with the tail comprising approximately half the length, and weighs about 57 grams (2 oz). It is well- named, because it is dull-mousy brown in overall color on the back and on the head (including a prominent crest). The bill is black on the upper part and is a pinkish color on the lower part. The rare white-headed mousebird can be confused with this species, but the differently colored mandibles and the lack of a bare grey orbital patch render the Speckled species distinctive. The speckled mousebird is not known for its voice, as songbirds are, although it is a noisy creature. They make a warbling tsu-tsu call while in flight, and are known for their tisk-tisk alarm call while in flight. Speckled mousebird (Colius striatus kiwuensis).jpg|C. s. kiwuensis, Uganda Speckled mousebirds (Colius striatus kikuyensis) pair.jpg|C. s. kikuyensis, Kenya  Range and habitat  It is distributed from Cameroon east to Eritrea and Ethiopia, south through eastern Africa to southern South Africa. Most habitats are suitable for this species, except the rainforests and more arid areas. This mousebird prefers open bushveld habitats. It is widespread in savanna and open woodlands, as well as areas with tangled thickets. It is a common \\"backyard bird,\\" often seen in urban areas that contain gardens and orchards.  Ecology  The speckled mousebird is a frugivore which subsists on fruits, berries, leaves, seeds and nectar, and is fairly strict in its choice of food from area to area. These are conspicuously social birds, feeding together and engaging in mutual preening. They also accompany each other when they go to ground to dust bathe (also to occasionally to swallow pebbles to assist in grinding up vegetation as they digest it). Upon nightfall, they roost in very tight groups of 20 or so birds and on cold nights they can become torpid. Being in a torpid state could make them easy prey, but the large groups are apparently effective enough to deter most nocturnal predators.  Breeding  The speckled mousebird may breed at any time of the year. The nest is a large (for the bird) and untidy cup made of vegetable and animal material (sometimes including cloth and paper) and is constructed by both the male and female. Clutch size ranges from one to seven eggs (apparently based on latitude), but usually averages 3‚Äì4. Nestlings are fed by both parents and also by helpers, which usually are juveniles from previous clutches. The incubation period is fourteen days and the offspring will leave the nest for the first time at about seventeen or eighteen days. After a little over a month, the nestlings will begin foraging for themselves. References Further reading *Sinclair, I., et al. SASOL Birds of Southern Africa. Struik. 2002.

Biography He studied philosophy in Barcelona and Granada and eventually became professor of the philosophy of law and of international law at the University of Madrid. He was strongly influenced by the ideas of the Kantian German philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause (as imported into Spain by Juli√°n Sanz del R√≠o and became an important exponent of \\"Krausismo\\" in Spain. He openly criticized the government for its attempts to stifle academic freedom. As a consequence, in 1875, he lost his chair at the university, which led to what can be seen as his major achievement: the 1876 foundation of the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza (Institute of Free Teaching), a private school of higher learning. He dedicated his life to the formation of human beings along coeducation; rationalism; and freedom of teaching, research, and literary communication. The goal was a society in which free citizens would be governed by free citizens on the basis of an adequate education. Because of his \\"rational realist\\" approach to law, he can also be seen as one of the forerunners of the sociology of law. Giner continued his work outside the university, even after he was reinstated in his university chair in 1881. Among the many important people who were at one time or another associated with the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza and the related Residencia de Estudiantes were Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Salvador Dal√≠, Antonio Machado, Luis Bu√±uel and Miguel de Unamuno.

It is organised by pornographer Steve Crow, and started in Auckland in 2003 after two local women were arrested for baring their breasts in a public protest. Crow considered this to be a breach of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, which specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and Crow argued that if it is legal in New Zealand for a male to bare his breast in public, the same must apply to women. Several legal attempts to stop the parade, most notably by Auckland City Council, have failed in court and the parade has been ruled legal under New Zealand legislation. Crow has run his Boobs on Bikes parade a number of times since 2003. The event normally precedes Crow's Erotica Expo,http://www.eroticaexpo.co.nz or as it is more correctly known, Erotica Lifestyles Expo, an adults-only adult lifestyles exhibition. International porn stars who travel to New Zealand for the expo are typically part of Boobs on Bikes.  2006 Auckland  In 2006, the parade, then much smaller and less known, made headlines in Auckland, when Steve Crow asked for permission from the city council, which was granted. Strong political opposition later materialized from parts of the public and some politicians, including mayor Dick Hubbard and most of the Auckland City Councillors.Bid to ban \\"degrading\\" porn-star pageant ‚Äì The New Zealand Herald, Wednesday 16 August 2006 Legal experts, however, concluded that the parade could not be denied by current laws (bare-breasted women not being an indecency in New Zealand in this age, as a police spokesman noted). Also, the organizers had technically asked only for assistance with traffic control for the parade and declared themselves determined to go ahead even in the face of opposition. The acrimonious debate about the parade ensured that when the parade took place several weeks later, Queen Street was packed with spectators. Rough counts estimate around one hundred thousand people,Picture: Wide eyed at topless parade - The New Zealand Herald, Thursday 24 August 2006 of which about one fifth were reported to be female. The 2006 parade contained about fifteen to twenty female pornstars on 26 bikes and two decommissioned army tanks.  2007 Christchurch  Boobs on Bikes event, 2007 The 2007 Christchurch \\"Boobs on Bikes\\" parade was held on 2 March. This parade received less national media attention than the Auckland parade the year before, as unlike in Auckland, there was no attempt by city councillors to prevent it. However, Christchurch City Council did release a press statement stating that they had \\"not approved or received an application to hold the proposed 'Boobs on Bikes' parade on Friday, 2 March, from Erotica event organisers.\\" The press release stated that the council must be consulted for any procession that will interfere with traffic, or may require crowd management. Erotica Lifestyle Expo organiser Steve Crow has brushed this off, saying that it is a promotion, not a parade, and all rules of the road will be observed. City council and organizers of the event say they had received numerous complaints about the parade; however, it isn't in the city's jurisdiction to act, as female toplessness is not illegal in New Zealand. Council transport and streets manager Michael Aitken told NZPA that the \\"standard of dress of participants is not a matter that the Council can control.\\" Police inspector Gary Knowles commented that it was a \\"moral not a criminal issue. We have taken legal advice and unless there is a breach of the peace, we cannot intervene.\\"Chch police urged to stop \\"boobs on bikes\\" ‚Äì New Zealand Press Association via Stuff.co.nz, Monday 26 February 2007 Opposition in Whanganui In March 2010, the Protect Our Youth Association began soliciting signatures for a petition against the parade, however, the petition effort was abandoned after then Whanganui Mayor Michael Laws stated to P.O.Y.A. representative Holly Dahya that he would ignore any petitions against the parade, and rejected any alternative recourse to council. Laws also rejected Wanganui City Councillor Allan Anderson's attempts to open discussion on the issue within Council itself, recognising that repeated attempts by Auckland City Council to prevent the event had failed. Crow also angered Palmerston North RSA members when he announced his parades in Palmerston North, Whanganui and Levin would take place over ANZAC weekend, with the Erotica Lifestyle Expo in Palmerston North scheduled for ANZAC day itself. In response to critics, Crow stated that it was an 'unfortunate clash of date' outside his control as that weekend (ANZAC weekend) was the only weekend available for the use of the venue.

Carrinas, as a leading member of the Marian party, fought in the civil war against Lucius Cornelius Sulla. He is perhaps best known for commanding Populares forces at the Battle of the Asio River and the Battle of the Colline Gate where he was captured and executed by Optimate forces. In 83 BC, Carrinas commanded with little success troops against the then young Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus. The following year he served as a legate to Gnaeus Papirius Carbo. Again given an independent command, Carrinas was defeated by Metellus Pius in Umbria and again by Pompey and Marcus Licinius Crassus near Spoletium. After this defeat Carrinas found himself besieged in the city yet succeeded in escaping with his troops by taking advantage of a dark and stormy night. After Carbo had left Italy, Carrinas joined his troops with those of Brutus Damasippus and the Samnites under Pontius Telesinus, after which they marched towards Praeneste, where Gaius Marius the Younger was besieged by a detachment of Sulla's troops. Unsuccessful in relieving Praeneste, the army marched upon Rome where it was met in battle by Sulla at the Colline Gate. After being defeated in the battle, Carrinas and the other Marian leaders took to flight, but they were captured and put to death by order of Sulla. Their heads were cut off and sent to Praeneste, where they were carried round the walls to inform Marius of the destruction of his friends and the hopelessness of his cause. Carrinas was the father of Gaius Carrinas, consul suffectus in 43 BC. Havercamp supposed Carrinas to be a cognomen of the Albia gens,Havercamp, Thesaurus Morelliantes, p. 497. but as the names never appear together in inscriptions, and Umbrian nomina frequently end in ,Chase, p. 118. it seems that the Carrinates were a separate gens of Oscan or Umbrian origin.

First camp meeting What later became known as the Revival of 1800 began as a traditional Presbyterian sacramental occasion at the Red River Meeting House in June of the same year. As the revival spread to the congregations of McGready's two other area congregations, several hundred people attended the meetings, held from Friday through Tuesday.C.S. Lewis Institute, accessed September 25, 2006 McGready's other congregations were located at Muddy River, and Gasper River. The meeting was a chance for the settlers to end their relative isolation for several days and to engage with new people. A letter from McGready to a friend dated October 23, 1801, described the meeting.Historical Foundation of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, accessed September 25, 2006 PB Ministries, accessed September 25, 2006 > In June, the sacrament was administered at Red River.

The historian Paul Conkin downplays the significance of the Red River meeting in relation to the religious revival. He says that McGready was one of several preachers at the event. The preacher wrote an account that was widely circulated, and which was instrumental in forming people's perceptions of the events at the meeting. Conkin thinks that McGready's account was exaggerated.Paul Conkin, Border States, Journal of the Kentucky-Tennessee American Studies Association, No. 10 (1995), accessed September 25, 2006 History The first settlers of European descent in the area were Ambrose Maulding and his family in 1780.Ambrose Maulding biography, accessed September 25, 2006 They established what became known as Maulding's Station or Maulding's Fort.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. The group has approximately 4,400 employees across the UK, North America and Australia. In January 2020, Ultra launched its new brand. History Early activities Ultra R906 radio The company that would eventually become Ultra Electronics was started by wireless specialist Teddy Rosen as Edward E. Rosen & Co. during 1920. The firm was initially focused upon the manufacture of high quality headphones and loudspeakers. During 1923, the company relocated to new premises at Harrow Road, London. In 1925, a new company, known as Ultra Electric Ltd., was formed; the Ultra name had been previously used for one of its products, the first commercial moving iron loudspeaker. During 1930, Ultra launched its first all-electric radio receiver. During 1931, the firm introduced its first mains-powered wireless set, known as the Ultra Twin Cub. That same year, Ultra received its first order from the aviation industry, having been placed by the Japanese Kawasaki Company. As a result of further expansion, the company moved to larger premises at Erskine Road, Chalk Farm, NW3 in 1932; three years later, a new factory at Western Avenue, Acton.\\"Vintage Technology: Ultra Electric.\\" vintage-technology.info. During the 1930s, Ultra manufactured a wide range of domestic radio receivers including the Blue Fox, Lynx, Panther and Tiger models. In 1939, the company presented a television receiver to the market for the BBC High Definition Television Service which was transmitted on 405 lines from the studios at Alexandra Palace, north London.\\"History of the BBC.\\" BBC. During the Second World War, Ultra diversified into aviation; the Short Stirling was the first aircraft to incorporate their products, the company acting as a subcontractor to produce tails and bomb doors for the bomber.\\"One firm's war.\\" Flight Magazine, 29 July 1960. Ultra would produce a wide range of aerostructures for numerous aircraft throughout the conflict. The firm solely focused on wartime demands, only relaunching itself into the civilian market during 1947, although it would continue to have an interest in the military sector during the post-war period. Post-war Ultra continued to manufacture products for the aviation industry after the war. Various engines, including the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba and the Rolls-Royce Avon, incorporated components such as temperature regulators, fuel flow valves, and throttle controls produced by Ultra. Electronic control systems would become a key part of the company's product range. In 1953, Ultra started manufacturing television sets. During 1956, the firm opened a new factory at Gosport for the production of both televisions and radio sets; Ultra acquired rival company Pilot Radio & Television in 1959. During the following year, Ultra reorganised itself, splitting into two divisions, one specialising in domestic radio and television and the other focused on all other electronic products.\\"Ultra Electric Re-organisation.\\" Flight Magazine, 15 January 1960. In 1961, Ultra's consumer electronics interests became part of Thorn Electrical Industries, who continued to manufacture products using the Ultra brandname until 1974. As a result of the acquisition, the remainder of the company became Ultra Electronics Ltd. Amongst its varied product range at this time, it produced the \\"Jezebel\\" and \\"Mini-Jezebel\\" sonobuoys. In 1962, Ultra developed their Search and Rescue and Homing (SARAH) radio beacon, this would be widely used throughout the world. Various subsystems of Concorde, include the droop nose controls and the full authority engine controls, incorporated Ultra technologies. During 1977, Ultra Electronics was bought by the Dowty Group. In 1982, the firm became a component of Dowty Group's newly founded Electronic Systems Division. During 1990, the division was relocated to Loudwater, Buckinghamshire. Reemergence In 1993, Ultra was the subject of a management buyout, led by Julian Blogh, of seven Dowty Group plc companies which formed the Dowty Group Electronic Systems Divisions, which had been previously acquired by TI Group during 1992. The newly independent company relocated to Greenford, Middlesex during 1994. In September 1995, Ultra Electronics received its first major export order from the American government, to supply support equipment for its McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II fleet. It was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. During the late 1990s, Ultra Electronics began to vigorously promote its active noise control systems, marketed as UltraQuiet; the firm argued that aircraft manufacturers can deploy it to decrease cabin noise, which has been a traditionally prevalent drawback of turboprop-powered aircraft, such as regional airliners, in comparison to their jet-powered counterparts. It also developed further noise reduction technologies during this period. Various companies, including Bombardier Aerospace and Airbus, have chosen to incorporate Ultra Electronics' noise reduction and vibration dampening products onto their aircraft. According to Flight International, since regaining its independence in the 1990s, the corporate strategy of Ultra Electronics appears to have been slanted towards maintaining a diverse product range, avoiding any large exposures to a single market, as well as being intentionally widely dispersed geographically. In 2000, Ultra Electronics acquired Datel Ferranti Group. It also acquired American voice communications provider Audiopack Technologies in 2004. By 2005, Ultra Electronics was ranked as the 66 biggest aerospace company in the world; at this point in time, the American market accounted for around one-third of the business' turnover. Operations The Ultra Electronics facility at Loudwater, Buckinghamshire The company operates under five strategic business units; Maritime, Intelligence & Communications, Precision Control Systems, Energy and Forensic Technology. It has facilities in the UK, North America and Australia.

The Powerhouse Museum said that they \\"formed a key element of an emerging subculture\\" that was fashion-aware, gay-friendly, appreciated dance music and open, outrageous celebration. Along with the rise of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, the success of RAT Parties marked a groundswell of acceptance of Sydney's gay & lesbian community. RAT parties are credited with introducing the visual performance art of VJing to Australia. RAT Team Forty Rat Parties were organised by the Recreational Arts Team between 1983 and 1992. The core of the team was Jac Vidgen, Billy Yip and Reno Dal. Jac Vidgen was a gregarious organiser who became the promoter and business leader. Billy Yip was a creative artist who created the themes and design concepts which characterized the parties, and his cleverly co-ordinated posters, fliers and ads became noticed around Sydney. Reno Dal was the team's original technical designer and producer involved from 1983 until 1986. Mark Taylor was the technical producer for the peak period 1986-1990, Wayne Gait- Smith was a technical designer. Tim and Mic Gruchy were the video designers from 1987-1992. As a young fashion student and a close friend of Vidgen, Akira Isogawa contributed to many of the lavish costumes that now survive in a well catalogued retrospective of the RAT era kept at Sydney's Powerhouse Museum. Vidgen was working as a waiter, holding extravagant parties for his friends in houses he shared until Dal, who had supplied the lighting for one of those parties, suggested they cover the costs by charging people. Vidgen and his boyfriend Yip agreed, and they set about organizing the first RAT party. Growth of the concept Vidgen threw his first public party (entitled \\"RAT Rock Wreck\\") for 200-250 guests in inner-city Surry Hills on 2 October 1983. Subsequent parties each had a special name, usually conceived by Billy Yip, incorporating the word 'rat' in its title. The next official RAT party, titled 'RATsurrect' and advertised through word-of-mouth, was held at the Bondi Pavilion on 22 April 1984. The early parties, particularly 'RATizm' at the Paddington Town Hall April 1985 attracted an inner-city party crowd of heterosexual bohemians as well as gay men and drag queens. RAT parties typically had audio-visual presentations, bizarre props, party drugs, innovative lighting, underground cabaret groups, the best DJs in town and unusual live performances. The later large Sydney Showground events would feature amusements and rides, break out/chill out areas and a selection of food and beverage alternatives. In 1987 Vidgen registered Recreational Arts Team Pty Ltd as a company. The events became larger, and were no longer exclusive eastern suburbs affairs where it was necessary to know the right people to obtain a ticket. The parties became famous for their spectacular entertainment and celebrity guests. Massive New Year's Eve parties were held for four consecutive years filing the Hordern Pavilion and Royal Hall of Industries at Sydney's Showground where up to 15,000 partygoers could be accommodated. 'A Ratty New Year', was the first held on New Year's Eve 1988 the event was broadcast live on JJJ and featured a 4am live performance by Grace Jones. Jones was due on stage much closer to midnight but refused to perform until Vidgen could provide a paper-trail of evidence that the performance fee had been transferred into her US account. New Year's Eve 1989 headlined Adeva at the same venue. Magazines and newspapers regularly featured RAT Parties in their social pages - fashions worn by partygoers and performers were captured by a number of high-profile photographers, among them Robert Rosen, Tom Stack,John Webber, Sonny Vandevelde and most notably William Yang. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation summed up the events by saying \\"Parties became an art form in Sydney's Oxford street. Jack Vidgen's private house parties grew into the notorious RAT parties. Events that set the tone and style of Australian dance music culture.\\" Media responses to the novelty of these events was mixed. At one time the Herald said that \\"RAT parties are a concept that has obviously worked\\", while another article in the same newspaper described them as \\"resolutely and profoundly superficial\\" with \\"unapologetic selfishness ... and shabby glitter.\\" The RAT events gradually became a part of mainstream Sydney culture; the parties were praised for their record of non-violence and the RAT team was sponsored by the New South Wales Government to produce the \\"young people's event\\" for their 1987 Carnivale. Starting with the party on New Year's Eve 1986, some RAT parties were brought under the organization umbrella of the Festival of Sydney, produced in partnership with ABC Radio's JJJ, which broadcast the events live featuring well-known radio personalities including Andy Glittre and Maynard F# Crabbes. Although the budgets had grown from $5,000 to $400,000, costs and expectations also skyrocketed. Business was risky, profits were slim, and money made on one party was frequently lost on the next one. DJs and copycats The RAT parties and Sydney Gay Mardi Gras Party and Sleazeball were forerunners of the dance parties and raves of the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the early 1980s pub rock in Sydney was still the mainstream, and dance music was a relatively underground phenomenon, with venues such as Stranded and later Patchs in Sydney pioneering dance parties in established venues. Dance party enthusiasts left the pub scene behind, preferring recorded electronic music provided by pioneering DJs like Tim Ritchie, Robert Racic, Stephen Allkins, Bill Morley, Pee Wee Ferris, Scott Pullen, Andy Glitre and Mark Alsop. Spearheaded by these DJs, dance music took off in Sydney during the 1980s. Promoters behind events by FUN, Sweatbox, Bacchanalia and the standard setting twice yearly public parties produced by the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, booked inner city warehouses and tired old venues and transformed them into vibrant, packed palaces. By the end of the 1980s parties flourished all around the country, with promoters booking a constant flow of influential overseas DJs such as Paul Oakenfold. While established rock venues suffered from lack of attendance, dance parties were frequently sold out. By the end of the 1980s it seemed that a massive dance party was being held every weekend at an accessible Sydney venue and competition was fierce. The RAT team pulled back to focus their efforts on a single New Year's event each year that would be likely to generate a return. But their profound impact on Sydney's bacchanalian awakening had already been made. Cultural impact and legacy The RAT parties altered Sydney's night life, starting a craze for giant dance parties that lasted into the 1990s. They provided a diverse range of entertainment based on visual and aural stimulation, provided a creative outlet for talented people and set the tone and style of Australian dance music culture. RAT parties are credited with introducing the visual performance art of VJing to Australia. In 2009, the Sydney Powerhouse Museum hosted an exhibition to \\"revive memories of Sydney's notorious RAT parties\\". Vidgen donated many of the articles on display there, and he described in an interview how the creative freedom and interactions from the RAT days built the careers of a number of people in various creative fields.

New South Wales railways 48 class, c. 1880 NER 1001 Class N¬∞1275, now in the National Railway Museum, York The long boiler locomotive was the object of a patent by Robert Stephenson and the name became synonymous with the pattern. Its defining feature is that the firebox is placed behind the rearmost driving axle. This gives a long boiler barrel, with long fire-tubes. There is thus a generous heating surface area, giving a boiler that is both powerful and efficient. It is generally perceived that it arose out of attempts to match the power of broad gauge locomotives within the limitations of the standard gauge of Stephenson railways. However, the patent originally arose from a problem which became apparent as trains travelled longer distances, specifically on the North Midland Railway in England around 1841, where fire tubes and smokeboxes were becoming destroyed by the heat. Experiments Experiments at the North Midland's Derby Works showed temperatures as high as , determined by placing a small cup of zinc within the smokebox beneath the chimney. Stephenson extended the boiler, and hence the firetubes, from the usual nine feet to thirteen or fourteen feet. Placing tin in the smokebox, he found that it just began to melt, indicating a temperature of . Stephenson's patent Having tested the design on the North Midland line between Derby and Leeds, Stephenson took out a patent in 1842 for what he referred to as a \\"Long Boiler\\" engine. To protect his patent, he realised that he should not specify an exact length. Meanwhile, the prevailing view was that the centre of gravity should be as low as possible, which limited the size of the driving wheels, and incidentally precluded the use of inside cylinders. Development Circa 1852. A LNWR passenger locomotive typical of the long boiler design. The initial locomotives were of 2-2-2 wheel arrangement to accommodate the extra length. However, with the outside cylinders, the engines were extremely unsteady, swaying from side to side. This led Stephenson to bring the rear wheels forward in the 4-2-0 formation, with the cylinders between the leading wheels. Such an engine was the \\"Great A\\" which took part in the Gauge Trials. This however, left the firebox behind the wheels and was therefore limited in size and weight. Moreover, the long rigid chassis made bends difficult to negotiate and damaged the track. The classical long-boiler locomotive, then, was powerful but slow. Typically of 0-6-0 arrangement, it was ideal for goods trains, one example surviving is the NER 1001 Class another being Consett A Class A No.5. Gray and Joy The opposite point of view was taken by John Gray, who designed a number of engines for the London and Brighton Railway. His engines were the inspiration for David Joy in his design for the Jenny Lind locomotive, which compensated for the size of its boiler by greater efficiency and a pressure of some 120 psi. Crampton The long boiler design, on the other hand, was taken to its extreme by Thomas Russell Crampton in the Crampton locomotive which utilised a larger driving wheel by placing it behind the firebox.

The points are not co-circular, so Ptolemy's inequality is strict for these points. In Euclidean geometry, Ptolemy's inequality relates the six distances determined by four points in the plane or in a higher-dimensional space. It states that, for any four points , , , and , the following inequality holds: :\\\\overline{AB}\\\\cdot \\\\overline{CD}+\\\\overline{BC}\\\\cdot \\\\overline{DA} \\\\ge \\\\overline{AC}\\\\cdot \\\\overline{BD}. It is named after the Greek astronomer and mathematician Ptolemy. The four points can be ordered in any of three distinct ways (counting reversals as not distinct) to form three different quadrilaterals, for each of which the sum of the products of opposite sides is at least as large as the product of the diagonals. Thus the three product terms in the inequality can be additively permuted to put any one of them on the right side of the inequality, so the three products of opposite sides or of diagonals of any one of the quadrilaterals must obey the triangle inequality.. As a special case, Ptolemy's theorem states that the inequality becomes an equality when the four points lie in cyclic order on a circle. The other case of equality occurs when the four points are collinear in order. The inequality does not generalize from Euclidean spaces to arbitrary metric spaces. The spaces where it remains valid are called the Ptolemaic spaces; they include the inner product spaces, Hadamard spaces, and shortest path distances on Ptolemaic graphs. Assumptions and derivation Ptolemy's inequality is often stated for a special case, in which the four points are the vertices of a convex quadrilateral, given in cyclic order... However, the theorem applies more generally to any four points; it is not required that the quadrilateral they form be convex, simple, or even planar. For points in the plane, Ptolemy's inequality can be derived from the triangle inequality by an inversion centered at one of the four points. attributes the inversion-based proof to textbooks by R. A. Johnson (1929) and Howard Eves (1963).. Alternatively, it can be derived by interpreting the four points as complex numbers, using the complex number identity :(A-B)(C-D)+(B-C)(A-D)=(A-C)(B-D) to construct a triangle whose side lengths are the products of sides of the given quadrilateral, and applying the triangle inequality to this triangle.. One can also view the points as belonging to the complex projective line, express the inequality in the form that the absolute values of two cross-ratios of the points sum to at least one, and deduce this from the fact that the cross- ratios themselves add to exactly one.. A proof of the inequality for points in three-dimensional space can be reduced to the planar case, by observing that for any non-planar quadrilateral, it is possible to rotate one of the points around the diagonal until the quadrilateral becomes planar, increasing the other diagonal's length and keeping the other five distances constant. In spaces of higher dimension than three, any four points lie in a three- dimensional subspace, and the same three-dimensional proof can be used. Four concyclic points For four points in order around a circle, Ptolemy's inequality becomes an equality, known as Ptolemy's theorem: :\\\\overline{AB}\\\\cdot \\\\overline{CD}+\\\\overline{BC}\\\\cdot \\\\overline{DA} = \\\\overline{AC}\\\\cdot \\\\overline{BD}. In the inversion-based proof of Ptolemy's inequality, transforming four co-circular points by an inversion centered at one of them causes the other three to become collinear, so the triangle equality for these three points (from which Ptolemy's inequality may be derived) also becomes an equality. For any other four points, Ptolemy's inequality is strict. In general metric spaces A cycle graph in which the distances disobey Ptolemy's inequality Ptolemy's inequality holds more generally in any inner product space, and whenever it is true for a real normed vector space, that space must be an inner product space... For other types of metric space, the inequality may or may not be valid. A space in which it holds is called Ptolemaic. For instance, consider the four-vertex cycle graph, shown in the figure, with all edge lengths equal to 1. The sum of the products of opposite sides is 2. However, diagonally opposite vertices are at distance 2 from each other, so the product of the diagonals is 4, bigger than the sum of products of sides. Therefore, the shortest path distances in this graph are not Ptolemaic. The graphs in which the distances obey Ptolemy's inequality are called the Ptolemaic graphs and have a restricted structure compared to arbitrary graphs; in particular, they disallow induced cycles of length greater than three, such as the one shown.. The Ptolemaic spaces include all CAT(0) spaces and in particular all Hadamard spaces. If a complete Riemannian manifold is Ptolemaic, it is necessarily a Hadamard space..

Despite this, it was demolished in 2015. Efforts to conserve the house In August 2013, the home was still in the Reasoner family, which hoped to have it relocated and saved when the underlying land was sold for commercial development. The home was scheduled to be demolished for construction of a RaceTrac gas station. On June 30, 2015, the Reasoner house was demolished. After standing for 119 years, it was torn down in approximately one hour.

History Holy Family was established in 1925 by the Sisters of Saint Joseph to provide Catholic higher education for the city of Bayonne. Holy Family's first building was the Clark residence at 115 West Eighth Street. The first students, six boys and forty-three girls, continued the commercial course they had begun at St. Mary's and graduated in June 1926. Enrollment increased and the properties at 109 and 119 West Eighth Street were acquired to meet the need. A four-year program was initiated and the school, after being accredited, graduated its first four-year class in June 1929. HFA graduated its last co-ed class in 1949. In 1954, the most recent building at 239 Avenue A was dedicated. (The Marist Brothers began a school for young men in the Eighth Street buildings.) In 2008 the Sisters of Saint Joseph announced that they were no longer able to own, operate or support Holy Family Academy. In July 2009, Holy Family Academy was renamed Holy Family Academy of Bayonne and governance was assumed by a Board of Trustees. Though the school was still operating under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, it became independent from the Sisters of Saint Joseph. Holy Family Academy of Bayonne was accredited by the Middle States Association Commissions on Elementary and Secondary Schools in 2012‚Äì2013. The final class of girls graduated in June 2013. On August 17, 2013 the contents of the building were sold through a listing on Craig's list and through advertisements in newspapers and through social media. Academics HFA's building had a gymnasium/auditorium, chapel, two science labs, three computer labs, a guidance building, and a library media center. Students at Holy Family were required to take four English courses, four mathematics courses, three science courses (four recommended), two World Language (Latin, Spanish or French) courses (four strongly recommended), two United States History courses, one World History course, one Physical Education course, one Health/Driver's Education course, and four Theology courses. The school offered Advanced Placement classes, two college classes through Saint Peter's University, (English Literature and Calculus) and one college course through Caldwell College (Forensic Science), along with a strong Honors program.

Attractions may include amusement rides, games of chance and skill, and food and merchandise vendors. When there is a beer festival, it is common to build one or more beer tents (), usually sponsored by a brewery, and set up beer gardens where it is possible to order traditional food and try the (beer specially brewed for the season). A large beer tent will have hundreds of wooden benches with a seating capacity in the thousands and offer live music, being a favourite place for patrons to spend the evening. The Oktoberfest is the world's biggest Volksfest and occurs yearly in Munich. Admission Admission to a Volksfest and the beer tents is free. However, rides or games are paid for separately. In contrast to traveling carnivals in the USA, each Volksfest ride is independently run, so tickets for several rides are uncommon. Inside the beer tents, there are usually tables that can be reserved, while the rest are on a first-come, first-served basis. Duration and location There is at least one Volksfest in many of the larger towns in Germany every year, each lasting from one to three weeks. In some towns there are two or more per year. A Volkfest is local in nature, attended mostly by people original from the hosting town and surrounding areas, but it may also attract international tourists. Sindelfingen is the only town to have given up its Volksfest. A Volksfest takes place nearly at the same date every year. A number of these have a long tradition and feature a variety of events like parades in historical costumes or traditional shooting competitions. One of the oldest Volksfests in Germany is the Lullusfest in Bad Hersfeld. A Volksfest usually takes place in a special location. Some of these sites are well known such as the Cannstatter Wasen in Stuttgart and Theresienwiese in Munich; however there are some Volksfest events which take place partly in the streets of towns. As the Volkfest is temporary in nature, most mechanical attractions, games and beer tents are assembled in the weeks or months prior to the start of the festival, and dismantled once it is over. Clothing Especially in Bavaria, it is common during the Volksfest for people to wear the Tracht, or traditional outfit, such as Lederhosen and white or chequered shirts for men, and the Dirndl for women.

After the establishment of the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC, Carrinas together with Publius Ventidius Bassus was appointed consul suffectus for the remainder of the year. In 41 BC, Octavian made Carrinas governor of Spain, where he warred with Bocchus II. In 36 BC, Octavian sent him with three legions against Sextus Pompeius in Sicily. In 31 BC Carrinas was made proconsular governor of Gaul, where he successfully fought against the rebellious Morini and drove the invading Suebi back across the Rhine, for which he was honoured with a triumph in 29 BC. Carrinas was the son of the Marian commander Gaius Carrinas.

Aims and objectives  An AIDSO worker is addressing in a public gathering The primary objective of the AIDSO is to organise student movements against the anti- education policies of the central and state governments as well as other authorities concerned, and for the \\"establishment of a scientific, secular, democratic education system\\".  Movements and protests  The AIDSO was formed on 28 December 1954. In the late 50s, a large student movement formed in West Bengal against a seat restriction scheme. The AIDSO played a crucial role In this movement. In 1974, AIDSO held the Cuttack Conference where the organisation emerged in a new form with an All India character, with representation from 8 states. The AIDSO played a role during the Emergency of 1975-76. Several members were involved in protesting against bus and tram fare increases in West Bengal in the 1980s. Manik Burman, a school student and AIDSO worker, and Rabi Ghosh, a leading AIDSO organiser, sustained severe bullet injuries. In Purulia Habul Rajak an AIDSO worker, and Sovaram Modak, died after being shot by police. AIDSO opposed NPE 86 and organised national protests. In Kerala, the AIDSO was part of a protracted movement against the DPEP or SSA. Recently the AIDSO has organised a national movement against the government policies of commercialisation of education, bringing education under the purview of GATS, the introduction of sex education at school level and the policy of SEZ (Special Economic Zones). AIDSO actively supported VTU students movement to abolish year back and critical year back system for students studying in old scheme and also providing supplementary for students of CBCS scheme.

The operation targeted 11 of India's airfields and also included artillery strikes on Indian positions in Kashmir. The targets were the Indian Airbases of Amritsar, Ambala, Agra, Awantipur, Bikaner, Halwara, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Pathankot, Bhuj, Srinagar and Uttarlai and air defence radars at Amritsar and Faridkot. In an address to the nation on radio that same evening, then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi held the air strikes to be a declaration of war against India and the Indian Air Force responded with initial air strikes the same night, which were expanded to massive retaliatory air strikes the next morning. Statements released by both nations the next day confirmed the \\"existence of a state of war between the two countries\\", although neither government formally issued a declaration of war. Background In March 1971, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) declared independence from Pakistan, starting the Bangladesh Liberation War following rising political discontent and cultural nationalism among the people of East Pakistan and the brutal suppressive force from West Pakistan in response (see Operation Searchlight and 1971 Bangladesh atrocities). Pakistan came under increasing criticism from India, the Soviet Union, Japan, and Europe as the plight of the refugees and their impact on the Indian economy were highlighted by Indira Gandhi in the UN and on a number of global tours. However, the United States and China showed little interest in the situation and actively opposed aid, intervention or support to the Mukti BahiniRemarks of President Richard M Nixon on 10 April 1971 at State Department signing of Biological Weapons Convention. > Every Great Power must follow the principle that it should not directly or > indirectly allow any other nation to use force or armed aggression against > one of its neighbors. . USIS Text, pp 1‚Äì2. (possibly fearing advancement of Soviet influence deep into South Asia). India's aid to the Mukti Bahini continued unabated, and fighting between the Mukti Bahini and the Pakistani forces grew increasingly vicious. On 9 August 1971, India signed a twenty-year cooperation treaty with the Soviet Union in which each promised military support to the other in the event it was attacked. This provided India cover against any possible Chinese or American intervention in aid of Pakistan if it went to war with India. To the Pakistani leadership, it became clear that armed Indian intervention and secession of East Pakistan was becoming inevitable. The strategy of pre- emption By October 1971, the Mukti Bahini had started launching massive raids deep into East Pakistan with active support of the Indian Army troops. The situation had deteriorated to a state of active undeclared war in the East by the end of November, when Indian and Mukti Bahini forces launched offensives on both the eastern and western borders of East Pakistan. Regular Indian Army troops engaged and mauled Pakistani armour at Garibpur, during which the two intruding Pakistan Air Force jets were shot down and another badly damaged in the Battle of Boyra while offensive manoeuvres were launched in Atgram against Pakistani border posts and communications centres along the eastern border. The Mukti Bahini also launched an offensive on Jessore at this time. It was clear to Islamabad by this time that open conflict was inevitable, and that East Pakistan was indefensible in the long run. Yahya Khan chose at this point to try to protect Pakistan's integrity and to hold India by Ayub Khan's strategy ‚Äì \\"The defence of East Pakistan lies in the West\\". This policy made the assumptions that an open conflict with India would not last long due to international pressure, and since East Pakistan was undefendable, the war-effort should be concentrated on occupying as large an area of Indian territory as possible as a bargaining tool at the negotiating table. To this end, Gen. Tikka Khan had proposed an offensive into India, and the PAF's overriding priority was to give maximum support to this offensive. The initial plans for the offensive called for at least a temporary cover of air dominance by the PAF under which Khan's troops could conduct a lightning campaign deep into Western India before digging in and consolidating their positions. In order to achieve air dominance, Pakistan decided to launch an offensive counter air strike codenamed Operation Chengiz Khan on Indian airbases. A second objective for the PAF was to conduct air interdiction against the supply routes for the Indian troops opposing Khan's proposed offensive, but these were accorded as secondary targets to be engaged after the operation started. The PAF's strikes were based on the same strategy of pre-emptive neutralization of enemy air capability used by the Israeli Air Force against Egyptian and Arab air forces in Operation Focus during the Six- Day War of 1967. The decision to hit India with a pre-emptive air strike was taken on 30 November 1971 during a meeting among the Pakistani President, Gen. Yahya Khan, Chief of Army Staff Gen. Abdul Hamid Khan, and the Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Gul Hassan Khan. The objectives of the strike were: *To surprise the IAF by attacking its forward airfields when it was least expected. *To neutralize these in order to obtain at least temporary battlefield air superiority in the West. *To counter-balance the Indian numerical advantage by hitting the forward operating bases of the Indian Air Force as a measure reducing the weight of expected counterattacks on PAF's own bases. To achieve surprise, the decision was made to strike on a Friday, the day of the jumu'ah (Muslim Sabbath), at 17:45 hrs when shifts in IAF control centers were changing. Emulating its operations' experience in battle against the Indian Air Force during the Indo-Pakistani Conflict of 1965, the decision was made to hit the Indian bases in a two-wave dusk strike followed by a number of night-interdiction missions through the night. The plans for the strike also anticipated the Indians securing their aircraft in blast pens. Also, anticipating difficulty in target acquisition for camouflaged targets such as fuel tanks, ammunition dumps and command centers, the primary objectives set for the operation were the runways and air defense radars. The first strikes The final orders for the strike were issued at 17:30 hrs on Friday 3 December 1971. The first formations were in flight and heading for their targets by 17:40 hrs. Officially, it was announced via government channels that the airstrikes were launched in response to attacks along the western border on Pakistan Rangers' outposts by regular troops of the Indian army, which the Indian Air Force was providing support to. The Indians would later deny any engagement on the Western Front. However, the Indian air defence radars failed to detect the approaching formations. The first indications for the Indians of the impending assault was the roar of the strike aircraft over their airfields, while in Delhi, the air-raid sirens were the first indications for newsmen, gathered for the daily brief of the East- Pakistan situation, that something was going on. *Pathankot ‚Äî The first of the strikes were mounted against Pathankot Airbase. Led by a flight of two Mirage IIIs (a reconnaissance craft and a strike escort) a six-plane wing of F-86Fs flying from Murid and led by Wing Commander S N Jilani hit the airbase with unguided rockets and dropped several 125 kg bombs. The main target of this strike was the runway, which was damaged and took the Indian ground crew several hours to repair. These missions went unopposed since the IAF had not scrambled any interception, and faced only AA. Pathankot was covered by interceptors from Adampur following this first strike during the time it took the ground crew to repair its runway.\\"My years with the IAF\\" by Air Chief Marshal P C Lal *Amritsar ‚Äî At 17:45 hrs, four Mirages flying from Sargodha and led by Wing Commander Hakimullah attacked Amritsar Airbase. Hakimullah's flight was armed with two 500 kg bombs each, which the strike used efficiently hitting the first 300m of the runway and cratering it enough to leave it nonoperational for several hours. However, the Amritsar runway was repaired within the same night to receive detachments of Mig 21s and Su-7 that flew against Rafiqui AB the next morning. A second strike of two F-104 Starfighters, led by Wing Commander Amjad H Khan hit the P-35 radar station at Amritsar, rendering it inoperable for nearly an hour. Two Sukhois then took off from the one remaining serviceable lane of the runway, moments before it was bombed by a passing B-57. Within forty-five minutes of these strikes, Pakistani troops had shelled India's western frontier and were reported to have crossed the border at Punch in the state of Jammu. Followup counter-air strikes The third wave of the PAF counter air strikes were directed to strike Ambala, Agra and Halwara around 18:00 hrs and continued in single or two-plane formations through the evening until at least 22:30 hrs. These strikes involved fifteen B-57 Canberras, four T-33s, and one C-130. The B-57s flew seven single-plane sorties. These caused significant damage, especially in Uttarlai, and Halwara and impeded IAF's preparation for retaliation. *Ambala ‚Äî Ambala Airbase was a hit by a two plane B-57 formation led by Wg. Cdr. Rais Rafi. The flight hit the runway with eight bombs, causing minor damage. *Agra ‚Äî Like Ambala, Agra Airbase, which lay deepest among the PAF's targets that evening, was struck by a two-plane B-57 formation led by Wg. Cdr. Yunus and followed by Flight Lieutenant Mazhar Bukhari. The bombs dropped by Yunus did not explode. Rais Rafi explained the old age of the bombs as the reason for their ineffectiveness as these were supposed to be used in the Second World War. The first Indian counter strikes launched that very night included the Canberras of No.5 Sqn based at Agra. *Sirsa ‚Äî Sirsa was hit by Sqn. Ldr. Alvi with bombs equipped with time-delayed fuses, damaging the runway heavily and forcing the runway to be closed for the rest of the night. *Uttarlai ‚Äî Four T-33s from A-Flight No.2 Squadron, led by Sqn. Ldr. Qureshi, hit Uttarlai, causing damage to the runway. These were launched at the same time as the second strike over Srinagar. Uttarlai was attacked a second time later that night by Wg. Cdr. Akhtar. The net damage to the runway was significant enough to keep the runway closed for six days and for the taxiway to be used instead. *Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Jamnagar ‚Äî In the south, Sqn. Ldr. Ishtak Qureshi's bombs hit the underground power cable at Jaisalmer, cutting off the power supply and telephone connection for six hours. At the same time, Jodhpur was hit by two B-57s led by Sqn. Ldr. Sohail Mansur while Jamnagar was hit by Flt. Lt. Ejaz Azam. The later flights were not expected to achieve any significant objectives which they miraculously did, and also aided to hamper any counter-strike by the IAF. The Indian retaliation As Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi addressed the nation on radio shortly after midnight informing about the Pakistani attack, the Indian Air Force struck back. By 21:00hrs, the Canberras of the No.35 Squadron and No.106 Squadron, as well as No.5 and No.16 squadron were armed and ready for their foray deep into Pakistan. These flew against eight Western Pakistani airbases: Murid, Mianwali, Sargodha, Chandhar, Risalewala, Rafiqui, and Masroor. In total, 23 combat sorties were launched that night, inflicting heavy damage to Sargodha and Masroor airbases. The PAF units stationed on these airfields had to operate from taxiways for the following two days. Through the night the Indian Air Force also struck the main East Pakistani airfields of Tejgaon, and later Kurmitola. At the same time, the Indian Air Force was deploying additional aircraft to its forward airfields for the strikes that were to follow the next morning. Within days, India was able to achieve air superiority.Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 Analysis In total, the Pakistani Air Force dropped 183 bombs over 12 target runways and 120 hits were reported by the pilots. However, of its stated objectives, the PAF was unable to neutralize the Indian Air Force in the west although it certainly achieved surprise besides damaging a few aircraft. Just as importantly, only a limited section of the PAF's strike capability was employed during Operation Chengiz Khan. Also, compared to the Israeli Air Force's preparation for airstrikes against Egyptians (the Israeli pilots had flown against replicas of the most important Arab airfields) and the use of specific armaments, the PAF had been limited by serviceability before the U.S. supplied spare parts in March of the year and training was limited if any. Constraints of the fledgling Pakistani economy also meant the development of its military could not be supported. The PAF thus lacked ammunition for effective runway denial. East Pakistani personnel of the PAF who defected may have revealed some of the plans, and it appears that IAF was expecting a pre-emptive strike against its forward airfields. A large-scale offensive was therefore doomed to fail, likely to cause heavy losses and bring the PAF in a position where it could never seriously challenge IAF operations.

Background Allez France was a bay mare bred in Kentucky by Bieber-Jacobs Stable. She became his first important horse owned by the French art dealer Daniel Wildenstein and the spur for his substantial investment in racehorses and bloodstock. For his horses in France, Wildenstein operated Dayton Investments Limited. For those in the United States, he owned the Allez France Stables. Racing career During her racing career from age two to five, Allez France was the pre-eminent filly in France, rivaled only by Dahlia (in six meetings however, Allez France was never beaten by Dahlia). In 1974, under new trainer Angel Penna, Sr., she went undefeated and won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, France's most prestigious horse race. She was crowned French Horse of the Year. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl0Q-Kqa1Qk. As a six-year-old, Allez France was sent to race in the United States but, as was the case in other races outside France, she did not do well. In 1976, she was retired as a broodmare to Lane's End Farm in Versailles, Kentucky. Achievement and assessment Allez France was the first filly in Thoroughbred horse racing history to earn $1 million, according to the United States National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. However, Sports Illustrated says that Dahlia was \\"the first filly to win $1 million (just before Allez did it)\\",http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1089191/ and the U.S. National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame contradicts itself by saying that Dahlia was \\"the first female Thoroughbred to earn $1 million.\\" Breeding record Allez France was the dam of the successful sire Air De France (1984‚Äì2004), who sired 11 stakes winners with a total of 34 stakes wins.ASB - Air De France Retrieved on 2009-7-7 *1980 Ave France (USA) : Bay filly by Seattle Slew (USA) - unraced *1984 Air de France (USA) : Brown colt, foaled 7 March, by Seattle Slew (USA) - won 1 race from two starts in France, successful sire in Australia *1985 Action Francaise (USA) : Brown filly by Nureyev (USA) - won two races including the G3 Prix de Sandringham at Chantilly from 4 starts in France and England 1988 After her death, Allez France was honored by being buried next to Man O' War and other greats at the Kentucky Horse Park near Lexington, Kentucky.

North Shore News, November 25, 2011. It is produced by Phillip Ditchburn, Anna Bonokoski and Richard Side. Each season has approximately 33 new episodes. These are recorded in front of live audiences in studios, theatres and clubs across Canada. The host of the first season was Shaun Majumder.\\"Majumder hits the radio\\". The Telegram, September 5, 2006. The second season featured a succession of guest hosts, including Sean Cullen, Elvira Kurt, Patrick McKenna and Roman Danylo. As of the third season the regular host of the show is Steve Patterson.

In 2011, the series also taped a number of episodes for broadcast as a television series on CBC Television,\\"Welcome to the Debaters\\". Calgary Herald, September 19, 2011. but did not get a second season.  Format  Each show is 30 minutes in length, and consists of two 15-minute debates. Two stand-up comedians are given a topical and sometimes complex matter to debate. One serves as advocate: the other takes the contrary view. The live audience ultimately decides who won the debate, based on a mix of \\"funny and fact\\", by applauding for the performer they thought did the best job. The comedian that gets the loudest round of applause wins. There are four rounds to each debate: the first allows the comedian to state their position on the issue, which is followed by the \\"bare-knuckle round\\" where the two debaters spar with each other directly. This is followed by the \\"firing line\\" round where the host quizzes the debaters on their knowledge of the subject (where they can either provide the correct or most amusing answer), concluded by a one-minute summation. The live audience then votes by applauding for who they thought had the best combination of \\"laughs and logic\\".  Episodes  See full list of radio episodes.  Awards  The \\"Monotheism vs. Polytheism\\" debate featuring Ron Sparks and Sean Cullen won the 2010 Canadian Comedy Award for Best Program or Clip. The \\"William Shatner is Canada's Greatest Actor\\" debate featuring Cullen and Eric Peterson also won the same award, in 2015.

Like most areas of New England, Hartford County is (and has been at all times since well before the 20th century) entirely divided into incorporated municipalities. There is no unincorporated territory. There are three types of municipalities in Connecticut: towns, boroughs and cities. As in the other New England states, towns are the basic unit of municipal government. Boroughs overlay towns and assume responsibility for some municipal services within their boundaries. Boroughs are not found in any of the other New England states, and are not very common in Connecticut today, although they were somewhat more numerous in the past. A number of boroughs have disincorporated over the years, choosing to revert to full town control. Cities also overlay towns. This is different from the other New England states, where cities are a different type of municipality equivalent to a town (this difference is related to cities having originally developed in Connecticut from the borough model). Most current cities are coextensive with their parent town, however, such that the entire municipality functions as a city. In practice, these cities are really no different from cities in the other New England states. It is also possible for a city in Connecticut to overlay part, but not all, of a town. There are currently only one or two examples, but it was a more common arrangement in the past. Many of today‚Äôs coextensive cities were non-coextensive at one time. As with boroughs, a number of non-coextensive cities have also disincorporated over the years, choosing to revert to full town control. The main tables below show municipalities at the town level. For any census, adding up the totals for each town should yield the county total. In cases where a community encompassed a coextensive city, the tables in the New England Historical U.S. Census Totals series mark the community as a city. In cases where a town included a non-coextensive city, the total shown below represents the entire town, including but not limited to the city. A separate section follows with population totals for boroughs and non-coextensive cities. For more information on the New England municipal system, see New England town.

*The city of New Britain, within the town of the same name In addition to the above, there was a second city, Hartford, which had already been made coextensive with its parent town. A fourth borough, Farmington (within the town of the same name), was incorporated in 1901. The following changes have occurred since then: *1905 ‚Äì The city of New Britain became coextensive with its parent town *1911 ‚Äì The borough of Bristol became a city, and was made coextensive with its parent town *1921 ‚Äì New borough of Unionville incorporated, within the town of Farmington *1947 ‚Äì The boroughs of Farmington and Unionville disincorporated *1948 ‚Äì The borough of Southington disincorporated 1900 *New Britain (city) 25,998 *Bristol (borough) 6,268 *Southington (borough) 3,411 1910 *Bristol (borough) 9,527 *Southington (borough) 3,714 *Farmington (borough) 897 1920 *Southington (borough) 5,085 *Farmington (borough) 1,021 1930 *Southington (borough) 5,125 *Unionville (borough) 2,135 *Farmington (borough) 1,131 1940 *Southington (borough) 5,088 *Unionville (borough) 2,084 *Farmington (borough) 1,323 1950 through 2000 There have been no boroughs or non-coextensive cities in Hartford County at any time since the 1940s. Notes 2000 Census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 2000 census totals subsequent to their initial release. The 2000 total for the city of Hartford was originally reported as 121,578; and for the town of West Hartford, 63,589. The totals were later revised to those shown in the list above. This was apparently done to correct an assignment error between these municipalities; the collective population of the two is the same using either set of figures, so the county total was not affected.

It has been repurposed as a power center and was renamed Seaview Square Shopping Center in 2012. In the Region/New Jersey; Foundering Ocean Township Mall Is Bulking Up, The New York Times, July 23, 2000 The mall,International Council of Shopping Centers: Seaview Square Mall, accessed December 9, 2006 located at the intersection of Route 35 and Route 66, was originally constructed in 1977 as an indoor mall.Upscale development fills commercial corridor, Asbury Park Press, October 20, 2005 It faced stiff competition from the more upscale Monmouth Mall, located five miles (8 km) further north on Route 35 in Eatontown. One of its four anchors never opened, and several smaller stores, and Stern's and Steinbach, two of its anchors, were victims of the then-indoor mall's then-state of decline.For a while, plenty of parking at mall, Asbury Park Press, January 18, 2001 The mall was later redeveloped into a shopping center with Target, Costco, Burlington, Home Sense, Siera Trading, Marshalls, Home Goods, Petsmart, AC Moore, Starbucks, and others. History The mall's past history can be traced back to the 1950s, when Sears relocated its Downtown Asbury Park store to a more suburban site on Route 66 at the site of the present-day Neptune World Class Shoprite, just west of the Asbury Circle. Following the 1970 Asbury Park riots, many businesses left Asbury Park's Downtown. Thus, planning for Seaview Square began at the site across the street from the Sears, behind a small cinema, which was later renamed the \\"Seaview Square Cinema\\" and absorbed as part of the mall's property. The site was originally a landfill from 1941 to 1975 and was considered a Superfund site by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) until 1991.Cracks in floor at Lowe's spur shutdown for repairs, Asbury Park Press, February 28, 2004 The mall would be anchored by Steinbach at the west end, and a newer and much larger Sears at the other end, which also housed Sears' regional credit office. The mall also had room for about 150 stores and two extra anchors. The mall was developed by The Goodman Company and opened on November 2, 1977. At this point, the mall was about 40% occupied. Steinbach operated its Seaview Square store as an upscale, fashion-oriented store, and their Asbury Park store more towards housewares and furniture. By 1979, however, the Asbury Park store had closed and the company reevaluated itself as a \\"value chain\\". In the same year, Stern's opened along the front side of the mall, after it wasn't able to open at the nearby Ocean County Mall in Toms River. Around the same time, Lord & Taylor was rumored to be the mall's fourth anchor, but never came to fruition. In the 1990s, Stern's parent company, Federated Department Stores, bought Macy's, and decided to merge the Abraham & Straus chain into Macy's, which left the Monmouth Mall with an empty anchor. Sterns subsequently moved to the vacant space, but continued to operate the Seaview Square store as half-store and half-clearance center until their lease ran out in 1999. Steinbach folded that same year and was replaced with a Value City. Current The mall closed on December 31, 2000 (with RadioShack, an original mall tenant, being the final store to close), for reconstruction, and most of the original indoor mall was demolished in 2001, with the exception of its remaining two anchors, Value City and Sears. In September 2012, Wharton Realty Group purchased the mall and renamed it the Seaview Square Shopping Center. New construction on the Route 66 entrance to the mall created three new restaurants and additional retail stores. A wave of new tenants soon filled most of the empty space of the old mall including Guitar Center, A.C. Moore, Big Lots, Burlington Coat Factory, Sky Zone Indoor Trampoline Park, Costco, PetSmart and a Target among others., accessed May 9, 2016 Value City had since went out of business in 2008 and was demolished in 2016. Today, the space is occupied by Homesense and Sierra Trading Post. accessed August 30, 2017 On May 31, 2018, Sears announced plans to close the store in September, as part of a plan to close 63 stores nationwide. Sears was the last of the original anchors to close. In 2019 Wharton announced an additional expansion to include Marshalls and Home Goods bringing the center's occupancy to over 98%. On November 25th, 2019, A.C. Moore announced the it would close 145 stores, including the one at Seaview.

Watson had acquired homestead rights on land with water resources vital to the wealthiest rancher in the county, Albert Bothwell, when she was accused by him of cattle rustling. She was abducted from her home and lynched along with her husband by Bothwell and some other ranchers he had incited against her. The bodies were left hanging for 2 days, and the reputation that attached to her until recently was quickly established by newspaper publicity. Accounts of Watson as a rustler are now regarded as highly biased. Her life has become an Old West legend, and inspired a number of television and film accounts. Early life Ellen Liddy Watson was born about July 1860. It is likely that she was the daughter of Thomas Lewis Watson and Francis Close, who married the next year on May 15, 1861, in Grey County, Ontario. The eldest of ten surviving children, Watson helped at home and attended school, learning to read and write in a small one-room building. In 1877, the family moved to Lebanon, Kansas. Soon after the move, Watson went to Smith Center, Kansas to work as a cook and housekeeper for H.R. Stone. While there, she met farm laborer William A. Pickell. They married on November 24, 1879. Their wedding portrait survives, depicting a \\"tall, square-faced woman\\",Van Pelt, p. 154. Watson was probably 5 foot 8 inches tall, and weighed about . She had brown hair, blue eyes and a Scottish accent, inherited from her parents.Davis, p. 69. Pickell was verbally and physically abusive and drank heavily. He would often beat Ella with a horsewhip. In January 1883, Watson fled to back to her parents' home. Pickell came after her, but was intimidated by her father and fled, and had no contact with her afterwards. Watson moved to Red Cloud, Nebraska, north of her family's homestead. She worked at the Royal Hotel for a year while establishing residency and then filed for divorce. That same year she moved, against her family's wishes, to Denver, Colorado to join one of her brothers who lived there. She then moved on to Cheyenne, Wyoming. It was unusual during that period in American history for a woman to move independently and alone, but she found work as a seamstress and a cook. Watson disliked Cheyenne and in late 1885 or early 1886 followed the railroad to Rawlins, Wyoming where she began working as cook and waitress in the premier boarding-house in town, the Rawlins House.Van Pelt, p. 158. Life with Averell On February 24, 1886, Watson met James \\"Jim\\" Averell, who was in Rawlins to file a homestead claim for land along the Sweetwater River, about from the Oregon, Mormon, and California Trails. There he opened a restaurant and general store catering to cowboys and to people traveling west. He quickly hired Watson to cook at his restaurant; customers paid 50 cents each for a meal. In May, she and Averell applied for a marriage license away, in Lander, Wyoming. The license listed her as \\"Ellen Liddy Andrews\\".McLure, p. 273. It is unclear whether the two were legally married, although historians think it likely that the marriage did take place, but was kept a secret. This allowed Watson to apply for land through the Homestead Act of 1862, which permitted single women, but not married women, to buy 160 acres of land, provided they improved it within five years. In August 1886 Watson filed squatter's rights to the land adjacent to Averell's.Van Pelt, p. 160. In May 1888, she filed her homestead claim to the same piece of land.Van Pelt, p. 163. To meet the requirements of the Homestead Act, Watson had a small cabin and corral constructed on her property.Wilson, p. 61. To earn extra money, Watson mended clothing for cowboys. The fact that men frequently visited her cabin may have led to rumors that she was a prostitute.Van Pelt, p. 162. Watson and the WSGA With her savings, Watson bought cattle from emigrants on the trails.Van Pelt, p. 165. She fenced about 60 acres of her land with barbed wire, but this would not have been enough grazing area for her small herd. In this era, many ranchers grazed their cattle on public land. In 1872, about two dozen of the cattlemen with the largest ranches banded together to create the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) to protect their rights to the open range.Wilson, p. 59. After suffering massive losses in the Snow Winter of 1880‚Äì1881, when cattle were unable to get to the grass under the snowdrifts, ranchers began growing hay as an alternative way of feeding the animals during the winter. For an area with little rainfall, this meant that access to water was now crucial to the survival of the ranches.McLure, p. 274. The land claimed by Watson and Averell controlled of water along Horse Creek. A law at the time stated that unbranded calves became the property of the WSGA. The cattlemen's associations limited small ranchers from bidding at auctions, and insisted that all ranchers, small and large, have a registered brand. The cost for registering a brand was exorbitant, ensuring that few small ranchers could afford it. Also, a brand had to be \\"accepted\\", and the cattlemen's associations had substantial power inside the committee that either rejected or accepted brands, thus locking out smaller ranchers. Over a three-year period Watson and Averell filed applications for five different brands and were denied each time.Davis, p. 72. In 1889 she bought a previously registered brand, \\"L-U\\", (an altered pronunciation of 'Ella') from John Crowder. Bothwell A neighbor, the wealthy cattleman Albert John Bothwell, who actually did not have legal title to much land apart from what his house stood on, made several offers to buy Watson and Averell's land from them. They repeatedly declined. With a brand of her own, Watson was now able to mark her own cattle. In July 1889, just as the spring roundup was ending, Watson branded her cattle.Davis, p. 73. Forty-one cattle were branded, a relatively high number considering the year before she had purchased only 28, all specifically described as being in poor health. Although it is possible that some cattle had broken through her fence and were accidentally mixed in with her own, it is also likely that many of the calves were mavericks, which the WSGA considered their property.Van Pelt, p. 168. In a move that may have been retaliation for the repeated denial of her brand applications, Watson filed for approval to construct a water ditch to irrigate more of her land. This ditch, if built, would reduce the amount of water available to neighboring ranchers, including Bothwell.Van Pelt, p. 166. Bothwell, who had fenced the public land he used, though this was not in accordance with the law, began to fence in parts of Ella's ranch and sent his cowboys to harass the couple. The couple apparently did not realise the danger they were in. On July 20, 1889, a range detective, George Henderson, was cited by Bothwell in a meeting with other ranchers as having seen that Watson had rustled cattle. Some wanted nothing to do with Bothwells plan to lynch the couple, but five agreed. Watched by Gene Crowder, Bothwell and those ranchers he had convinced to go along with him arrived on the ranch with a buckboard and told Ella at gunpoint to get in or be shot as they were arresting her for rustling and taking her to Rawlins. Crowder rode for help, reporting the news to the couple's friend Frank Buchanan. By the time Buchanan reached where they had stopped, Bothwell was stringing up a rope, and one of his men putting a noose around her neck. Buchanan started shooting, but was forced back and both Jim and Ella were hanged. Aftermath of killings County Sheriff Frank Hadsell and Deputy Sheriff Phil Watson (no relation to Ella) arrested Albert Bothwell and five other men for the two murders. A trial date was set, but Gene Crowder and John DeCorey both left the area before the trial, while Buchanan was initially taken into protective custody, but later disappeared and was widely thought to have been murdered, despite claims to the contrary by a newspaper. Although the events caused a political controversy in the state, Bothwell acquired both homesteads of the murdered victims and ran his ranch without any legal repercussion or other retribution until he retired to Los Angeles, where he died in the Twenties. Cattle Kate The day that Watson and Averell were lynched, George Henderson received a telegram. He immediately went to the Cheyenne Daily Sun and then other papers controlled by the WSGA. The next day, those papers published lurid accounts of the crimes of prostitute and cattle rustler \\"Cattle Kate\\" Maxwell and her partner-in-crime, James Averell. Daily Sun editor Ed Towse's 1,300-word article justified the \\"lawless but justifiable deed\\" of lynching Averell and \\"Maxwell.\\" He stated that \\"the cattlemen have been forced to this and more hangings will follow unless there is less thieving.\\"Davis, p. 68. The articles and those that followed marked the first time that the cattlemen had used the press as a tool to justify and glorify their violence. The tactic was so successful that it was resurrected during the violence of 1891 and 1892.Davis, p. 75. Legacy Those who knew her spoke highly of Watson. A stage station operator, Harry Ward, described Watson as \\"a fine looking woman\\", saying: \\"Other women looked down on her in those days, but no matter what she was or did she had a big heart. Nobody went hungry around her.\\" Watson is the only woman to have been hanged in Wyoming. Her death, and that of Averell, \\"became symbols of the societal contempt raging against rustlers during the latter part of the nineteenth century.\\"Van Pelt, p. 155. The Cattle Kate myth was largely accepted until the late 20th century, when composer George Hufsmith began researching Watson's life for an opera, The Lynching of Sweetwater. He received a lot of information from her family and eventually used his research in writing a biography of Watson.Van Pelt, p 156. Watson's relatives erected a marker in 1989 at her grave site to commemorate her death. Find a Grave: Ellen Liddy \\"Ella\\" Watson Retrieved September 18, 2012. The 1953 movie The Redhead from Wyoming was loosely based on the myth of Watson as Kate Maxwell. Maureen O'Hara played a madam who inadvertently helped Averell (William Bishop (actor)) run a cattle rustling empire.Franscell, p. 279. Another highly fictionalized version of the lives of Ella Watson and James Averell was produced in 1980.

He is credited with founding the first legislative reference library in the United States. McCarthy was active in policy formation, with special interests in agricultural cooperatives and adult and vocational education. He authored The Wisconsin Idea, a summary of Progressive philosophy and thinking. Early years McCarthy was born in Brockton, Massachusetts to a shoemaker and his wife, who kept a boarding house. He was the only one of their three children to survive childhood. After an education in the public schools in Brockton, he was apprenticed to a shoemaker. When this did not interest him, he ran away to become a cabin boy on a sailing schooner. While at sea, he read the books available in the ship's library, obtaining the equivalent of a high school education. Eager to obtain more education, he tried to enter Brown University, but was denied admission. After appealing directly to the president of the university, his entrance to the school was arranged. McCarthy lacked the funds to pay for school, so he financed his education by working as a scene shifter and painter in theaters in Providence. He also played for the Brown football team, earning All-America honors. He graduated from Brown in 1896, with a bachelor of philosophy degree. When the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out, McCarthy tried to enlist, but was turned down for physical reasons. Despite this, he headed to Florida, and was aboard a troop transport, when he was discovered and put ashore. He became ill with malaria caught in camp, and by the time he recovered, the war was over. McCarthy then entered law school at the University of Georgia. To pay for school, he took a job as the school's football coach. During his two seasons, 1897 and 1898, McCarthy's team compiled a record 6‚Äì3. Interested in the economics of Richard T. Ely, McCarthy enrolled at the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison), where he studied history, politics, and economics. He received a Ph.D. in 1901. His thesis, which was on the Anti-Masonic Party, was awarded the Justin Winsor Prize by the American Historical Association. Career Legislative Reference Library In 1901, McCarthy was appointed the chief document clerk for the Wisconsin Free Library Commission. Although the position was designed to provide legislators with reference materials, McCarthy ultimately expanded its scope to include researching legislation from around the world and drafting legislation. He was interested in improving lawmaking from what he saw as a chaotic process largely controlled by lobbyists to a systematic one that produced well-crafted legislation that could both survive court challenge and serve as a model for other states and the federal government. He formulated the concept of a legislative reference library‚Äî a place where legislators could take their ideas, learn about the experiences of other states and countries, cast their ideas in concrete terms, and then have the help of trained draftsmen to put their ideas into legal form. Initially spurned by the legislature, McCarthy was eventually given space for his project in the attic of the capitol. He ultimately built it into the first legislative reference library in the country, and was responsible for overhauling the way legislation was created in the state. The Wisconsin Idea In 1912, McCarthy published The Wisconsin Idea, a summary of the goals and ideals of the Progressive movement. In it, he decried the \\"corrupting influences of the concentrated wealth\\" and called for political and economic reforms that would facilitate \\"the betterment, the efficiency and the welfare of each individual.\\" To accomplish this, McCarthy advocated the development of a science of public administration so that governments could be run with the same efficiency as businesses. He recommended that public officials be educated specifically for administrative duties. Other ideas described in the book include the direct accountability of politicians and government administrators to the electorate; the regulation of business, including railroads, utilities, stocks and bonds, insurance, and banking, for the public good; and the provision of service by public universities to the state via university extensions and adult education. In his introduction to the book, Theodore Roosevelt wrote: > As Professor Simon N. Patten says: \\"Without means of attainment and measures > of result an ideal becomes meaningless. The real idealist is a pragmatist > and an economist. He demands measurable results and reaches them by means > made available by economic efficiency. Only in this way is social progress > possible.\\" Mr. McCarthy's purpose is to impress not only every real > reformer, but every capable politician, with the fact that the people are > more concerned about \\"good works\\" than about \\"faith.\\" Progressivism One of McCarthy's ideals was that the law should embody the public will. To accomplish this required not only the systematic formulation of legislation, but governmental reforms. Many of the reforms he advocated were embodied in the platform of Theodore Roosevelt's Bull Moose Party, which McCarthy helped draft. Focused on removing corruption from politics and waste and inefficiency from government, the platform advocated the recall of judicial decisions, easier amendment of the Constitution, and women's suffrage as means to accomplish this. It also called for improvements in social welfare, including social welfare legislation for women and children, workers' compensation, farm relief, mandatory health insurance in industry, and new inheritance and income taxes. Other positions In addition to his work with the Wisconsin legislature, McCarthy was an advisor to Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William H. Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. In 1914-15, he was Director of Research and Investigation for the U.S. Commission on Industrial Relations. During World War I, when Herbert Hoover became head of the U.S. Food Administration, McCarthy became his chief aide. In 1917, he was offered the post of advisor to China within the State Department, but declined. He was sought after by corporations and other states, but always declined the offers in order to remain at the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Library. Legacy McCarthy died March 26, 1921 in Prescott, Arizona, where he had gone to seek relief from health problems. His remains lay in state at the Wisconsin State Capitol, the first time anyone had been honored with that distinction since the Civil War. A bronze plaque of McCarthy was placed in the assembly chamber of the capitol.

A tourist attraction popular with foreign visitors and native Kazakhs, it is emblematic of the city, which became capital of the country in 1997. The tower is located within on the Nurzhol Boulevard, and is considered a symbol of post-independence Kazakhstan.  Design  The monument is meant to embody a folktale about a mythical tree of life and a magic bird of happiness: the bird, named Samruk, had laid its egg in the crevice between two branches of a poplar tree. The 105m (344.5 ft.) tall structure rises from a wide flat base within a raised plaza. It consists of a narrow cylindrical shaft, surrounded by white branch-like girders that flare out near the top, supporting a gold-mirrored 22 m diameter sphere. The base contains a ticket booth and exhibition space, with two lifts rising within the shaft to the observation deck within the 'egg'. Entrances to the monument are sunk below eye level, reached by stairs from the surrounding plaza. (It's somewhat similar to the 1982 World's Fair Sunsphere in Knoxville, TN, USA.(266 ft.) The observation deck is 97 m above ground level, corresponding to 1997, the year that Nur-Sultan became the nation's capital. It consists of two levels, one with 360 degree views of Nur-Sultan and beyond, with a second, higher level, reached by a flight of stairs. The top level features a gilded hand print of the right hand of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the first President of the independent Republic of Kazakhstan, mounted in an ornate pedestal. A plaque invites visitors to place a hand in the imprint and make a wish.

He is famous for his satirical songs and oblique yet incisive political commentary. He is remembered for his rough voice, for the heavily ironic lyrics of his songs and his social protests. He died in a car accident at age 30. He was a popular and influential figure, widely re-evaluated by 2000s music. Biography Salvatore Antonio Gaetano was born in Crotone, Calabria. In March 1960, at the age of ten, his family moved to Rome, where he would spend the rest of his life. In 1961, he was sent to study at the seminary Piccola Opera del Sacro Cuore of Narni, in the province of Terni, where under the guidance of his teacher Renato Simeoni, he began to show his flair for writing poetry. By 1967 he had finished school and living back in Rome, he created a quartet with a group of friends called Krounks, who would mainly play cover songs. They were inspired by Italian artists such as Enzo Jannacci, Fabrizio De Andr√©, Adriano Celentano, I Gufi, and Ricky Gianco as well as international musicians such as Bob Dylan and The Beatles. In 1969, Gaetano approached Folkstudio, a well-known club in Rome for promoting young artists. His style proved to be very different from that of the other musicians. His strong use of irony caused concerns for the club managers, as he recounted: \\"When I sang at Folkstudio, it was the centre of discussions....in fact they did not want me to do many of my pieces because they thought I wanted to make fun of everyone.\\" However, Gaetano was a multi- talented performer and during the early 1970s, in addition to gigging, he performed in cabarets and took part in several plays including playing the role of Estragon in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, the Fox in a production of Pinocchio by Italian director Carmelo Bene and reciting poetry by Majakovsky. Gaetano was an accomplished actor and it was through his theatre experience that he developed much of his subsequent stage style and writing technique. He was inspired by German kabarett, a form of theatre that excels in political satire. Wikipedia describes this as \\"unlike comedians who make fun of all kind of things, Kabarett artists (German: Kabarettisten) pride themselves as dedicated almost completely to political and social topics of more serious nature which they criticize using techniques like cynicism, sarcasm and irony.\\" They were able to deal with social themes and political developments through their acts, something that inspired Gaetano and can be seen in many of his concepts and staging, for example, in his song ' regarding the oil crisis of the 1970s. It enabled him to make political observations while avoiding censorship. Gaetano cited Ionesco as his favourite playwright, one of the foremost writers of Theatre of the Absurd, saying that he explored the usual problem of the inability to truly communicate, isolation and exclusion. He developed a comedy act with his friend Bruno Francelleschi, 'Ad esempio a me piace...' (For example, I like...), as a mixture of theatre and music. In addition to his performing, Gaetano studied accountancy, encouraged by his father to pursue a secure career in banking. Gaetano asked for one more year to break into music and in 1972, he recorded his first 45 rpm record with the Milan-based Produttori Associati containing the songs \\"Jacqueline\\" and \\"La ballata di Renzo\\", a song which features lyrics that echo details of his own death. The disc was not printed and Gaetano signed with Vincenzo Micocci, releasing his first single in 1973, ' (with \\"Jaqueline\\" on the B-side) produced by RosVeMon, the surnames of Aurelio Rossitto, Antonello Venditti and Piero Montanari. In this song, Gaetano exhibits his multicultural education, singing in four languages ‚Äì English, Italian, German and French. Rino decided to release the single under the pseudonym of Kammamuri's as tribute to a character in Pirates of Malaysia by Emilio Salgari. According to Micocci the choice of using a pseudonym was a sign of shyness and insecurity of Gaetano: \\"He considered himself a writer, not a singer. He believed he didn't have a good voice, so that after the release of I Love You Marianna, when the time came to record his first album, he came and told me that it would be better to get someone else to sing the songs. I, of course, I laughed and sent him in the studio.\\" In 1974, he published his first album, '. The LP featured many of the themes that would characterise his work, such as issues of isolation, marginalisation and exclusion, as well as his lively style and intelligent, witty lyrics. His songs began to be played on radio stations and in the same year, through record company RCA, Gaetano wrote three songs for Nicola Di Bari \\"Prova a chiamarmi amore\\", \\"Questo amore cos√¨ grande\\" and \\"Ad esempio a me piace... il Sud\\", included in the album Ti fa bella l'amore. The Spanish version of \\"Ad esempio a me piace... il Sud\\", \\"Por ejemplo\\", achieved success in Latin America. Success for Gaetano came the following year with the 45 rpm hit record \\"\\" (\\"But the sky is always bluer\\"), perhaps now the most famous and instantly recognisable of his songs. Unusually, the 45 contained only one song, but it was split into two. In this song Gaetano offers several pictures of everyday life, with irony, clich√©s and contradictions. In September 1975, the singer explained some of this thinking in an article in the weekly Italian music magazine, ': \\"These pictures are sad, never happy, because I wanted to emphasise that nowadays there are few cheerful things and it is for this reason that I take into account those who die at work. Even the verse \\"who plays Sanremo\\" is sad and negative, because anyone who plays Sanremo, doesn't think of those who \\"live in barracks\\".  Mio fratello √® figlio unico and Aida  In 1976 Gaetano recorded his second album, Mio fratello √® figlio unico (My Brother is an Only Child). With this album, he tries to capture the listener's attention with dramatic narratives, especially loneliness and alienation, the main themes of the album. On the album, Gaetano began to explore new sounds and instruments including the sitar, the banjo and the mandolin, enabling him to obtain a more complex and mature album. In a review published by Ciao 2001 shortly after the album's release, it states that: \\"His second album, Mio fratello √® figlio unico, already widely programmed by radio stations, is much more mature and personal than his previous album. Gaetano is an atypical figure: there is the difficulty of finding genres to fit him into, trends in which to place him, which is the best compliment that you can give. The music, made a few chords, is built intelligently and pleasantly. The voice is aggressive, deliberately crude words are fun, the lyrics have allegories, the visual images are faster, like photography.\\" (Enzo Caffarelli) The following year Gaetano recorded his third album, '. The choice of the name refers to the work of the great Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi, but for Gaetano, Aida is the embodiment of all women and of Italy itself. Through the figure of Aida, Rino researches and recounts moments in Italian history with a completely original, almost photographic, observation. While on tour, Gaetano was joined by the emerging band, Crash, and he produced their album Exstasis and wrote their song \\"Marziani noi\\" (Us Martians). With his increasing rise in popularity, he made his first major television appearance on the entertainment programme, Domenica in (Sunday), presented by the legendary Italian TV presenter Corrado Mantoni, singing \\"\\" and on 19 August, he was invited to appear on a programme with Gino Paoli where he famously appeared bearing a petrol pump and wearing a striped T-shirt and a colonial style safari hat.  Sanremo Music Festival  Although not generally recognised outside of Italy, the Sanremo Music Festival is a popular annual song contest. Due to its pop music roots and pop culture positioning, it was not felt to be a route for a serious musician. However, pressure from RCA encouraged Gaetano to take part. He chose his new song '. It was a highly innovative half-sung/ half-spoken proto-rap against several Italian sportsmen, politicians and other high- profile figures. However, the producers of the show forced him to drop the song, due to its now famous list of prominent Italians which it criticised, and swap the song with ' On 26 January 1978, Gaetano appeared on stage at Sanremo wearing a top hat, evening dress featuring medals, red and white sneakers and bearing a ukulele. The performance of Gianna, also included the first time the word 'sex' was used onstage at Sanremo. Towards the end of the song, the band appeared unexpectedly onstage to sing the chorus. Later discussing his performance at Sanremo, Gaetano remarked: \\"The festival is a walkway and like all walkways, it gives you three minutes to make a speech that you would normally do in a two hour show. So you have to find a way. For my part, I have chosen the way of paradox, a bit like Carmelo Bene.\\" (Rino vive ‚Äì Ma il cielo √® sempre pi√π blu, RAI 2, 2007) Bruno Franceschelli recalls the event: \\"The performance in Sanremo, from my point of view, was a demonstration of his talent as an artist. He brought a new air, funny and irreverent, and once again demonstrated his free spirit, free to laugh and joke on the 'sacred soil' of Sanremo.\\" The song went on to dominate the charts for several weeks. It remained in the Top Ten for 14 weeks and sold over 600,000 copies. A version of the song in German was released by Wolfgang Petry.  Nuntereggae pi√π and controversy  In the same year Gaetano appeared on Rai Radio 1 radio programme Canzone d'Autore (Songwriters). During the programme, emerging musicians are invited to comment on their own songs. The programme was called \\"E cantava le canzoni\\", a title taken from the fourth album of the singer. On the same album is the now notorious \\"Nuntereggae pi√π\\", and Gaetano was asked to discuss it because of the numerous political references and the long list of names in the lyrics. He replied, \\"The songs are not political texts and I do not make speeches. This is just teasing. So, for me, \\"Nuntereggae pi√π\\" is the lightest song I've ever done \\". Some verses of the song contain lists of names of people who at that time were prominent on the radio, television and newspapers. Some of the names included in the first version were deleted or replaced. For example, in the original version, written before his kidnapping, appeared the name of Aldo Moro. As a result of subsequent events, the name was later deleted from the text of the song, so as to avoid creating controversy. But other names were also deleted including the journalist Indro Montanelli, the actor Lino Banfi, Sinatra, Michele Sindona (Italian banker and convicted criminal) and the president of the Italian defence company Finmeccanica Camillo Crociani who was involved in the Lockheed scandal and the illegal Masonic Propaganda Due (P2) lodge. [41] Vincenzo Mollica recalls: \\"'Nuntereggae' is a song of great fun, but [Gaetano] had the courage of his actions, he never drew back.\\" In that year Gaetano participated in a tour and some evening events, the most famous of these is definitely Discomare '78 and specifically the final night held in the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento on 23 August 1978. The singer was supposed to sing Nuntereggae more, but Rai tries to stop him and Rino in protest leaves the event. In October Rino goes to Madrid to record the Spanish version of the 45 Nuntereggae more. The title chosen is \\"Corta el rollo ya\\" (cut it short) and the singer adapts the text by inserting characters of Spanish politics and entertainment as Carrillo , Pirri and Susan Estrada. The album will be released in the spring and get some success.  Final albums  1979 sees the release of Gaetano's fifth studio album, ' and his first with RCA. Rino took part in his first Festivalbar and then, in October, he attended the Discoestate in Rieti. On this occasion, in protest at having to sing along to playback, when the music starts, instead of pretending to sing, he decides to act indifferent and smokes a cigarette. Also in 1979, during a concert on the beach in Capocotta (in fact also mentioned in the lyrics), before singing Nuntereggae pi√π, Gaetano is said: \\"There's someone who wants to put a gag on me! I do not fear them! They will not succeed! I feel that, in the future, my songs will be sung by future generations, that, thanks to mass communication, they will understand what I mean tonight! They will understand and open their eyes, rather than having them full of salt! And you wonder what happened on the beach Capocotta.\\" Gaetano was referring to the murder of Wilma Montesi. In 1980, he recorded his final album ' noted for its serious tone and rock sound. In 1981, RCA organised a tour, from which the live ' album was created. In 1981, he also played the role of the Fox from Pinocchio in a movie directed by Carmelo Bene and filmed in Rome.  Death  On 31 May 1981 Gaetano made his last appearance on TV singing E io ci sto. The career and life of Gaetano were interrupted on 2 June 1981, at the age of thirty, as a result of a car accident. He had already been in a traffic accident earlier that year on 8 January, when a Jeep had driven the wrong way along the road and pushed Gaetano's Volvo against the guardrail: the singer was unharmed while his car was completely destroyed. Gaetano had finally decided to buy a new Volvo 343 in metallic gray. On 2 June, at about 3 am, Rino was returning home alone in his car. At 3.55 am, while along Rome's Via Nomentana, at the intersection of Viale XXI Aprile, he was in collision with a van. The front and right side of the Volvo were destroyed. When help arrived, Rino was already in a coma and at the hospital, an x-ray showed a fracture at the base of the skull, various wounds to the forehead, a fractured right molar and a suspected fracture of the sternum. However, the clinic did not have a department for cranial injuries and the doctor on duty, Dr. Novelli, tried in vain to contact another hospital with a cranial trauma department. He contacted by phone St. John, St. Camillus, the CTO of Garbatella, the Policlinico Gemelli and San Filippo Neri, but could not get any assistance. At 6am, Rino Gaetano died. There was a great deal of controversy about this accident, because of the failure of any of the contacted hospitals to help Gaetano and thus, an investigation was launched. On 4 June his funeral was held in the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in which Gaetano had planned to get married. His funeral was a big event, attended by many relatives, friends, members of the music industry, RCA executives and fans. Initially he was buried in the small cemetery of Mentana, but on 17 October his body was transferred to the Verano cemetery, where it remains. In recent years, the lyrics of the unpublished song \\"La ballata di Renzo\\" (The Ballad of Renzo) has drawn a lot of attention ‚Äì a song written by Rino more than ten years before his death. This song tells the story of a boy named Renzo, who died under similar circumstances. Renzo is hit by a car and dies after being rejected by many hospitals in Rome for lack of space, while his friends are at the bar. The song even references three of the hospitals that refused to treat Gaetano on 2 June 1981 due to lack of beds: General Hospital, San Giovanni and San Camillo. This is a topic of popular discussion. Gaetano's death was discussed on 27 November 2007 in a short radio program broadcast on Radio DeeJay by Carlo Lucarelli, who uses a writer-documentary narrative form to reconstruct unsolved crimes related to the world of music. The first book on his life, also the first official biography, was published in 2001, 20 years after his death.

Their interaction gives a nuclear charge of Z + q, where q = ‚àíeN, with N equal to the number of electrons. Electrons and nuclei are, to a very good approximation, point charges and point masses. The molecular Hamiltonian is a sum of several terms: its major terms are the kinetic energies of the electrons and the Coulomb (electrostatic) interactions between the two kinds of charged particles. The Hamiltonian that contains only the kinetic energies of electrons and nuclei, and the Coulomb interactions between them, is known as the Coulomb Hamiltonian. From it are missing a number of small terms, most of which are due to electronic and nuclear spin. Although it is generally assumed that the solution of the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation associated with the Coulomb Hamiltonian will predict most properties of the molecule, including its shape (three-dimensional structure), calculations based on the full Coulomb Hamiltonian are very rare. The main reason is that its Schr√∂dinger equation is very difficult to solve. Applications are restricted to small systems like the hydrogen molecule. Almost all calculations of molecular wavefunctions are based on the separation of the Coulomb Hamiltonian first devised by Born and Oppenheimer. The nuclear kinetic energy terms are omitted from the Coulomb Hamiltonian and one considers the remaining Hamiltonian as a Hamiltonian of electrons only. The stationary nuclei enter the problem only as generators of an electric potential in which the electrons move in a quantum mechanical way. Within this framework the molecular Hamiltonian has been simplified to the so-called clamped nucleus Hamiltonian, also called electronic Hamiltonian, that acts only on functions of the electronic coordinates. Once the Schr√∂dinger equation of the clamped nucleus Hamiltonian has been solved for a sufficient number of constellations of the nuclei, an appropriate eigenvalue (usually the lowest) can be seen as a function of the nuclear coordinates, which leads to a potential energy surface. In practical calculations the surface is usually fitted in terms of some analytic functions. In the second step of the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation the part of the full Coulomb Hamiltonian that depends on the electrons is replaced by the potential energy surface. This converts the total molecular Hamiltonian into another Hamiltonian that acts only on the nuclear coordinates. In the case of a breakdown of the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation‚Äîwhich occurs when energies of different electronic states are close‚Äîthe neighboring potential energy surfaces are needed, see this article for more details on this. The nuclear motion Schr√∂dinger equation can be solved in a space-fixed (laboratory) frame, but then the translational and rotational (external) energies are not accounted for. Only the (internal) atomic vibrations enter the problem. Further, for molecules larger than triatomic ones, it is quite common to introduce the harmonic approximation, which approximates the potential energy surface as a quadratic function of the atomic displacements. This gives the harmonic nuclear motion Hamiltonian. Making the harmonic approximation, we can convert the Hamiltonian into a sum of uncoupled one- dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians. The one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is one of the few systems that allows an exact solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation. Alternatively, the nuclear motion (rovibrational) Schr√∂dinger equation can be solved in a special frame (an Eckart frame) that rotates and translates with the molecule. Formulated with respect to this body-fixed frame the Hamiltonian accounts for rotation, translation and vibration of the nuclei. Since Watson introduced in 1968 an important simplification to this Hamiltonian, it is often referred to as Watson's nuclear motion Hamiltonian, but it is also known as the Eckart Hamiltonian.  Coulomb Hamiltonian  The algebraic form of many observables‚Äîi.e., Hermitian operators representing observable quantities‚Äîis obtained by the following quantization rules: * Write the classical form of the observable in Hamilton form (as a function of momenta p and positions q). Both vectors are expressed with respect to an arbitrary inertial frame, usually referred to as laboratory-frame or space-fixed frame. * Replace p by -i\\\\hbar\\\\boldsymbol{ abla} and interpret q as a multiplicative operator. Here \\\\boldsymbol{ abla} is the nabla operator, a vector operator consisting of first derivatives. The well-known commutation relations for the p and q operators follow directly from the differentiation rules. Classically the electrons and nuclei in a molecule have kinetic energy of the form p2/(2 m) and interact via Coulomb interactions, which are inversely proportional to the distance rij between particle i and j. : r_{ij} \\\\equiv |\\\\mathbf{r}_i -\\\\mathbf{r}_j= \\\\sqrt{(\\\\mathbf{r}_i -\\\\mathbf{r}_j)\\\\cdot(\\\\mathbf{r}_i -\\\\mathbf{r}_j)} = \\\\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2 + (z_i-z_j)^2 } . In this expression ri stands for the coordinate vector of any particle (electron or nucleus), but from here on we will reserve capital R to represent the nuclear coordinate, and lower case r for the electrons of the system. The coordinates can be taken to be expressed with respect to any Cartesian frame centered anywhere in space, because distance, being an inner product, is invariant under rotation of the frame and, being the norm of a difference vector, distance is invariant under translation of the frame as well. By quantizing the classical energy in Hamilton form one obtains the a molecular Hamilton operator that is often referred to as the Coulomb Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian is a sum of five terms. They are # The kinetic energy operators for each nucleus in the system; # The kinetic energy operators for each electron in the system; # The potential energy between the electrons and nuclei ‚Äì the total electron-nucleus Coulombic attraction in the system; # The potential energy arising from Coulombic electron-electron repulsions # The potential energy arising from Coulombic nuclei-nuclei repulsions ‚Äì also known as the nuclear repulsion energy. See electric potential for more details. # \\\\hat{T}_n = - \\\\sum_i \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 M_i} abla^2_{\\\\mathbf{R}_i} # \\\\hat{T}_e = - \\\\sum_i \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 m_e} abla^2_{\\\\mathbf{r}_i} # \\\\hat{U}_{en} = - \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_j \\\\frac{Z_i e^2}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\left \\\\mathbf{R}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j \\\\right } # \\\\hat{U}_{ee} = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_{j e i} \\\\frac{e^2}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\left \\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j \\\\right } = \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_{j > i} \\\\frac{e^2}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\left \\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j \\\\right } # \\\\hat{U}_{nn} = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_{j e i} \\\\frac{Z_i Z_j e^2}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\left \\\\mathbf{R}_i - \\\\mathbf{R}_j \\\\right } = \\\\sum_i \\\\sum_{j > i} \\\\frac{Z_i Z_j e^2}{4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\left \\\\mathbf{R}_i - \\\\mathbf{R}_j \\\\right }. Here Mi is the mass of nucleus i, Zi is the atomic number of nucleus i, and me is the mass of the electron. The Laplace operator of particle i is : abla^2_{\\\\mathbf{r}_i} \\\\equiv \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}_{\\\\mathbf{r}_i}\\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{ abla}_{\\\\mathbf{r}_i} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x_i^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial y_i^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial z_i^2} . Since the kinetic energy operator is an inner product, it is invariant under rotation of the Cartesian frame with respect to which xi, yi, and zi are expressed.  Small terms  In the 1920s much spectroscopic evidence made it clear that the Coulomb Hamiltonian is missing certain terms. Especially for molecules containing heavier atoms, these terms, although much smaller than kinetic and Coulomb energies, are nonnegligible. These spectroscopic observations led to the introduction of a new degree of freedom for electrons and nuclei, namely spin. This empirical concept was given a theoretical basis by Paul Dirac when he introduced a relativistically correct (Lorentz covariant) form of the one-particle Schr√∂dinger equation. The Dirac equation predicts that spin and spatial motion of a particle interact via spin-orbit coupling. In analogy spin-other-orbit coupling was introduced. The fact that particle spin has some of the characteristics of a magnetic dipole led to spin-spin coupling. Further terms without a classical counterpart are the Fermi-contact term (interaction of electronic density on a finite size nucleus with the nucleus), and nuclear quadrupole coupling (interaction of a nuclear quadrupole with the gradient of an electric field due to the electrons). Finally a parity violating term predicted by the Standard Model must be mentioned. Although it is an extremely small interaction, it has attracted a fair amount of attention in the scientific literature because it gives different energies for the enantiomers in chiral molecules. The remaining part of this article will ignore spin terms and consider the solution of the eigenvalue (time-independent Schr√∂dinger) equation of the Coulomb Hamiltonian.  The Schr√∂dinger equation of the Coulomb Hamiltonian  The Coulomb Hamiltonian has a continuous spectrum due to the center of mass (COM) motion of the molecule in homogeneous space. In classical mechanics it is easy to separate off the COM motion of a system of point masses. Classically the motion of the COM is uncoupled from the other motions. The COM moves uniformly (i.e., with constant velocity) through space as if it were a point particle with mass equal to the sum Mtot of the masses of all the particles. In quantum mechanics a free particle has as state function a plane wave function, which is a non-square-integrable function of well-defined momentum. The kinetic energy of this particle can take any positive value. The position of the COM is uniformly probable everywhere, in agreement with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. By introducing the coordinate vector X of the center of mass as three of the degrees of freedom of the system and eliminating the coordinate vector of one (arbitrary) particle, so that the number of degrees of freedom stays the same, one obtains by a linear transformation a new set of coordinates ti. These coordinates are linear combinations of the old coordinates of all particles (nuclei and electrons). By applying the chain rule one can show that : H = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2M_\\\\textrm{tot}} abla^2_{\\\\mathbf{X}} + H' \\\\quad\\\\text{with }\\\\quad H'= -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N_\\\\textrm{tot} -1 } \\\\frac{1}{m_i} abla^2_{i} +\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 M_\\\\textrm{tot}}\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^{N_\\\\textrm{tot} -1 } abla_{i} \\\\cdot abla_{j} +V(\\\\mathbf{t}). The first term of H is the kinetic energy of the COM motion, which can be treated separately since H' does not depend on X. As just stated, its eigenstates are plane waves. The potential V(t) consists of the Coulomb terms expressed in the new coordinates. The first term of H' has the usual appearance of a kinetic energy operator. The second term is known as the mass polarization term. The translationally invariant Hamiltonian H' can be shown to be self-adjoint and to be bounded from below. That is, its lowest eigenvalue is real and finite. Although H' is necessarily invariant under permutations of identical particles (since H and the COM kinetic energy are invariant), its invariance is not manifest. Not many actual molecular applications of H' exist; see, however, the seminal work on the hydrogen molecule for an early application. In the great majority of computations of molecular wavefunctions the electronic problem is solved with the clamped nucleus Hamiltonian arising in the first step of the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation. See Ref. for a thorough discussion of the mathematical properties of the Coulomb Hamiltonian. Also it is discussed in this paper whether one can arrive a priori at the concept of a molecule (as a stable system of electrons and nuclei with a well-defined geometry) from the properties of the Coulomb Hamiltonian alone.  Clamped nucleus Hamiltonian  The clamped nucleus Hamiltonian describes the energy of the electrons in the electrostatic field of the nuclei, where the nuclei are assumed to be stationary with respect to an inertial frame. The form of the electronic Hamiltonian is : \\\\hat{H}_\\\\mathrm{el} = \\\\hat{T}_e + \\\\hat{U}_{en}+ \\\\hat{U}_{ee}+ \\\\hat{U}_{nn}. The coordinates of electrons and nuclei are expressed with respect to a frame that moves with the nuclei, so that the nuclei are at rest with respect to this frame. The frame stays parallel to a space-fixed frame. It is an inertial frame because the nuclei are assumed not to be accelerated by external forces or torques. The origin of the frame is arbitrary, it is usually positioned on a central nucleus or in the nuclear center of mass. Sometimes it is stated that the nuclei are \\"at rest in a space-fixed frame\\". This statement implies that the nuclei are viewed as classical particles, because a quantum mechanical particle cannot be at rest. (It would mean that it had simultaneously zero momentum and well-defined position, which contradicts Heisenberg's uncertainty principle). Since the nuclear positions are constants, the electronic kinetic energy operator is invariant under translation over any nuclear vector. The Coulomb potential, depending on difference vectors, is invariant as well. In the description of atomic orbitals and the computation of integrals over atomic orbitals this invariance is used by equipping all atoms in the molecule with their own localized frames parallel to the space-fixed frame. As explained in the article on the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation, a sufficient number of solutions of the Schr√∂dinger equation of H_\\\\text{el} leads to a potential energy surface (PES) V(\\\\mathbf{R}_1, \\\\mathbf{R}_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{R}_N). It is assumed that the functional dependence of V on its coordinates is such that : V(\\\\mathbf{R}_1, \\\\mathbf{R}_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{R}_N)=V(\\\\mathbf{R}'_1, \\\\mathbf{R}'_2, \\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{R}'_N) for : \\\\mathbf{R}'_i =\\\\mathbf{R}_i + \\\\mathbf{t} \\\\;\\\\;\\\\text{(translation) and}\\\\;\\\\; \\\\mathbf{R}'_i =\\\\mathbf{R}_i + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\phi}{|\\\\mathbf{s}|} \\\\; ( \\\\mathbf{s}\\\\times \\\\mathbf{R}_i) \\\\;\\\\;\\\\text{(infinitesimal rotation)}, where t and s are arbitrary vectors and ŒîœÜ is an infinitesimal angle, ŒîœÜ >> ŒîœÜ2. This invariance condition on the PES is automatically fulfilled when the PES is expressed in terms of differences of, and angles between, the Ri, which is usually the case.  Harmonic nuclear motion Hamiltonian  In the remaining part of this article we assume that the molecule is semi-rigid. In the second step of the BO approximation the nuclear kinetic energy Tn is reintroduced and the Schr√∂dinger equation with Hamiltonian : \\\\hat{H}_\\\\mathrm{nuc} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2}\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^3 \\\\frac{1}{M_i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial R_{i\\\\alpha}^2} +V(\\\\mathbf{R}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{R}_N) is considered. One would like to recognize in its solution: the motion of the nuclear center of mass (3 degrees of freedom), the overall rotation of the molecule (3 degrees of freedom), and the nuclear vibrations. In general, this is not possible with the given nuclear kinetic energy, because it does not separate explicitly the 6 external degrees of freedom (overall translation and rotation) from the 3N ‚àí 6 internal degrees of freedom. In fact, the kinetic energy operator here is defined with respect to a space-fixed (SF) frame. If we were to move the origin of the SF frame to the nuclear center of mass, then, by application of the chain rule, nuclear mass polarization terms would appear. It is customary to ignore these terms altogether and we will follow this custom. In order to achieve a separation we must distinguish internal and external coordinates, to which end Eckart introduced conditions to be satisfied by the coordinates. We will show how these conditions arise in a natural way from a harmonic analysis in mass- weighted Cartesian coordinates. In order to simplify the expression for the kinetic energy we introduce mass-weighted displacement coordinates :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\rho}_i \\\\equiv \\\\sqrt{M_i} (\\\\mathbf{R}_i-\\\\mathbf{R}_i^0). Since : \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\rho_{i \\\\alpha}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\sqrt{M_i} (\\\\partial R_{i \\\\alpha} - \\\\partial R^0_{i \\\\alpha})} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{M_i}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial R_{i \\\\alpha}} , the kinetic energy operator becomes, : T = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^3 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial \\\\rho_{i\\\\alpha}^2}. If we make a Taylor expansion of V around the equilibrium geometry, : V = V_0 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^3 \\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial \\\\rho_{i\\\\alpha}}\\\\Big)_0\\\\; \\\\rho_{i\\\\alpha} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i,j=1}^N \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta=1}^3 \\\\Big( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 V}{\\\\partial \\\\rho_{i\\\\alpha}\\\\partial\\\\rho_{j\\\\beta}}\\\\Big)_0 \\\\;\\\\rho_{i\\\\alpha}\\\\rho_{j\\\\beta} + \\\\cdots, and truncate after three terms (the so-called harmonic approximation), we can describe V with only the third term. The term V0 can be absorbed in the energy (gives a new zero of energy). The second term is vanishing because of the equilibrium condition. The remaining term contains the Hessian matrix F of V, which is symmetric and may be diagonalized with an orthogonal 3N √ó 3N matrix with constant elements: : \\\\mathbf{Q} \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\mathbf{Q}^\\\\mathrm{T} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Phi} \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{with}\\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Phi} = \\\\operatorname{diag}(f_1, \\\\dots, f_{3N-6}, 0,\\\\ldots,0). It can be shown from the invariance of V under rotation and translation that six of the eigenvectors of F (last six rows of Q) have eigenvalue zero (are zero-frequency modes). They span the external space. The first 3N ‚àí 6 rows of Q are‚Äîfor molecules in their ground state‚Äîeigenvectors with non-zero eigenvalue; they are the internal coordinates and form an orthonormal basis for a (3N - 6)-dimensional subspace of the nuclear configuration space R3N, the internal space. The zero-frequency eigenvectors are orthogonal to the eigenvectors of non-zero frequency. It can be shown that these orthogonalities are in fact the Eckart conditions. The kinetic energy expressed in the internal coordinates is the internal (vibrational) kinetic energy. With the introduction of normal coordinates : q_t \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=1}^N\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^3 \\\\; Q_{t, i\\\\alpha} \\\\rho_{i\\\\alpha}, the vibrational (internal) part of the Hamiltonian for the nuclear motion becomes in the harmonic approximation : \\\\hat{H}_\\\\mathrm{nuc} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{t=1}^{3N-6} \\\\left[-\\\\hbar^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial q_{t}^2} + f_t q_t^2 \\\\right] . The corresponding Schr√∂dinger equation is easily solved, it factorizes into 3N ‚àí 6 equations for one-dimensional harmonic oscillators. The main effort in this approximate solution of the nuclear motion Schr√∂dinger equation is the computation of the Hessian F of V and its diagonalization. This approximation to the nuclear motion problem, described in 3N mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates, became standard in quantum chemistry, since the days (1980s-1990s) that algorithms for accurate computations of the Hessian F became available. Apart from the harmonic approximation, it has as a further deficiency that the external (rotational and translational) motions of the molecule are not accounted for. They are accounted for in a rovibrational Hamiltonian that sometimes is called Watson's Hamiltonian.  Watson's nuclear motion Hamiltonian  In order to obtain a Hamiltonian for external (translation and rotation) motions coupled to the internal (vibrational) motions, it is common to return at this point to classical mechanics and to formulate the classical kinetic energy corresponding to these motions of the nuclei. Classically it is easy to separate the translational‚Äîcenter of mass‚Äîmotion from the other motions. However, the separation of the rotational from the vibrational motion is more difficult and is not completely possible. This ro-vibrational separation was first achieved by Eckart in 1935 by imposing by what is now known as Eckart conditions. Since the problem is described in a frame (an \\"Eckart\\" frame) that rotates with the molecule, and hence is a non-inertial frame, energies associated with the fictitious forces: centrifugal and Coriolis force appear in the kinetic energy. In general, the classical kinetic energy T defines the metric tensor g = (gij) associated with the curvilinear coordinates s = (si) through : 2T = \\\\sum_{ij} g_{ij} \\\\dot{s}_i \\\\dot{s}_j. The quantization step is the transformation of this classical kinetic energy into a quantum mechanical operator. It is common to follow Podolsky by writing down the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator in the same (generalized, curvilinear) coordinates s as used for the classical form. The equation for this operator requires the inverse of the metric tensor g and its determinant. Multiplication of the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator by -\\\\hbar^2 gives the required quantum mechanical kinetic energy operator. When we apply this recipe to Cartesian coordinates, which have unit metric, the same kinetic energy is obtained as by application of the quantization rules. The nuclear motion Hamiltonian was obtained by Wilson and Howard in 1936, who followed this procedure, and further refined by Darling and Dennison in 1940. It remained the standard until 1968, when Watson was able to simplify it drastically by commuting through the derivatives the determinant of the metric tensor. We will give the ro-vibrational Hamiltonian obtained by Watson, which often is referred to as the Watson Hamiltonian. Before we do this we must mention that a derivation of this Hamiltonian is also possible by starting from the Laplace operator in Cartesian form, application of coordinate transformations, and use of the chain rule. The Watson Hamiltonian, describing all motions of the N nuclei, is : \\\\hat{H} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2M_\\\\mathrm{tot}} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^3 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial X_\\\\alpha^2} +\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta=1}^3 \\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} (\\\\mathcal{P}_\\\\alpha - \\\\Pi_\\\\alpha)(\\\\mathcal{P}_\\\\beta - \\\\Pi_\\\\beta) +U -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2} \\\\sum_{s=1}^{3N-6} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial q_s^2} + V . The first term is the center of mass term : \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{M_\\\\mathrm{tot}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N M_i \\\\mathbf{R}_i \\\\quad\\\\mathrm{with}\\\\quad M_\\\\mathrm{tot} \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{i=1}^N M_i. The second term is the rotational term akin to the kinetic energy of the rigid rotor. Here \\\\mathcal{P}_\\\\alpha is the Œ± component of the body-fixed rigid rotor angular momentum operator, see this article for its expression in terms of Euler angles. The operator \\\\Pi_\\\\alpha\\\\, is a component of an operator known as the vibrational angular momentum operator (although it does not satisfy angular momentum commutation relations), : \\\\Pi_\\\\alpha = -i\\\\hbar \\\\sum_{s,t=1}^{3N-6} \\\\zeta^{\\\\alpha}_{st} \\\\; q_s \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial q_t} with the Coriolis coupling constant: : \\\\zeta^{\\\\alpha}_{st} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\sum_{\\\\beta,\\\\gamma=1}^3 \\\\epsilon_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\gamma} Q_{s, i\\\\beta}\\\\,Q_{t,i\\\\gamma} \\\\;\\\\; \\\\mathrm{and}\\\\quad\\\\alpha=1,2,3. Here ŒµŒ±Œ≤Œ≥ is the Levi-Civita symbol. The terms quadratic in the \\\\mathcal{P}_\\\\alpha are centrifugal terms, those bilinear in \\\\mathcal{P}_\\\\alpha and \\\\Pi_\\\\beta\\\\, are Coriolis terms. The quantities Q s, iŒ≥ are the components of the normal coordinates introduced above. Alternatively, normal coordinates may be obtained by application of Wilson's GF method. The 3 √ó 3 symmetric matrix \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu} is called the effective reciprocal inertia tensor. If all q s were zero (rigid molecule) the Eckart frame would coincide with a principal axes frame (see rigid rotor) and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu} would be diagonal, with the equilibrium reciprocal moments of inertia on the diagonal. If all q s would be zero, only the kinetic energies of translation and rigid rotation would survive. The potential-like term U is the Watson term: : U = -\\\\frac{1}{8} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^3 \\\\mu_{\\\\alpha\\\\alpha} proportional to the trace of the effective reciprocal inertia tensor. The fourth term in the Watson Hamiltonian is the kinetic energy associated with the vibrations of the atoms (nuclei) expressed in normal coordinates qs, which as stated above, are given in terms of nuclear displacements œÅiŒ± by : q_s = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^3 Q_{s, i\\\\alpha} \\\\rho_{i\\\\alpha}\\\\quad\\\\mathrm{for}\\\\quad s=1,\\\\ldots, 3N-6. Finally V is the unexpanded potential energy by definition depending on internal coordinates only. In the harmonic approximation it takes the form : V \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{s=1}^{3N-6} f_s q_s^2.

All services of its kind are known as interexchange carriers, which essentially allow consumers to bypass, or \\"dial-around\\" their primary long-distance carrier and use a different one. History The services debuted in May 1996, originally as 10-321 (and its numerous variants) before the telephone industry expanded carrier access codes to seven digits instead of the original five; the number gained an additional \\"10\\", becoming 10-10-321 on July 1, 1998. Although \\"dial-around\\" interexchange carriers existed prior to the debut of 10-10-321, these were among the first to feature a mass multimedia advertising campaign. The services were advertised heavily, using celebrities such as Hulk Hogan, Alf, John Lithgow, Terry Bradshaw, Reginald VelJohnson, John Stamos, Mike Piazza, Tony Danza, Doug Flutie, James Garner, Toby Keith, Christopher Lloyd, Dennis Miller and George Carlin. This ubiquitous presence on television led to a spill-over into pop culture for a brief time, much like MCI's fellow collect-call service 1-800-COLLECT during this era. Each service advertised rates that were significantly lower than most telephone operators were charging at the time; 10-10-321, for instance, was a straight pay-per-minute service charging 10 cents per minute, while 10-10-220 was mostly a pay-per-call service, with any call up to 20 minutes charged a flat 99 cents, and both services charged the same rate regardless of time of day, a rarity for long-distance service at the time. By the early 2000s, the steep discounts were no longer offered, rates increased as much as 80 percent in fall 2002, with 10-10-321 going from 10 cents a minute to 18 cents on October 1, 2002. A year earlier, a 9.9 percent \\"Universal Service Fund\\" charge had been added. The television advertising has since become much less common. In addition, the widely increased use of cell phones in the early 2000s, and subsequent decline in the use of landline phones, has rendered the service somewhat antiquated. Much of this is because many mobile phone service plans do not charge additionally for long-distance calls; the advent of voice over IP, in particular, has rendered the distinction between local and long distance meaningless. 10-10-321, 10-10-220, and other 10-10 services are still available, although at significantly higher prices than originally advertised during its heyday. , 10-10-321 charges a flat 30¬¢ per minute for calls within the U.S. and U.S. territories, while 10-10-220 calls within the U.S. (except calls from Alaska, where the service is not available) cost $1.50 for the first 10 minutes, and 25¬¢ for each additional minute, plus a 24.4% Federal Universal Service Fee.

Its name derives from the fact that it usually describes heroic deeds, like the medieval European gesta (lit. \\"deeds\\").Alain Ricard, Le kiswahili, une langue moderne (Karthala, 2009), p. 91. Utendi, plural tendi, meaning \\"act\\" or \\"deed\\", is derived from the Swahili verb ku-tenda \\"to do\\". Well-known examples of utenzi are the Utendi wa Tambuka by Bwana Mwengo (one of the earliest known literary works in Swahili, dated 1728), the Utenzi wa Shufaka, and the Utenzi wa vita vya Uhud (the epic of the battle of Uhud) compiled around 1950 by Haji Chum.See Chum & Lambert (1962). Reciting utenzi is a popular pastime on weddings and other ceremonies and feasts; often, specialized narrators are invited to do this.Knappert 1977:31. Utenzi verse form consists of four-line stanzas, with each line having eight syllables. The last syllables of the first three lines rhyme with each other, while the fourth line has a rhyme that is constant throughout the whole of the epic. This last rhyme thus serves to tie all stanzas of the epic together. Within a line of eight syllables there are no further meter requirements. The verse form can be illustrated by the first stanza of the UtendÃ†i wa Tambuka:In Knappert's Latin transcription, based on the Arabic manuscript U, as found in Knappert 1977:32. :Bisimillahi kutÃ†ubu :yina la Mola Wahhabu :ArrahÃ£amani eribu :na ArrahÃ£imu ukyowa The first three lines all end in -bu. The last syllable of the fourth line ends in the vowel a, and this sound is found at the end of every stanza of the poem. When recited, this last syllable is sustained for some time and given emphasis. See also *Swahili literature References *Chum, Haji & H.E. Lambert (1962).

It can be seen as enabling people to get fit who would not normally attend a conventional gym or sports centre. Organization As of 2006 the majority of Green Gym groups are run directly by The Conservation Volunteers, the community volunteering charity. The rest are either self- supporting or run under licence by other organisations. A Green Gym Licence Agreement provides the framework for an organisation to run a Green Gym project. The Conservation Volunteers provides a high level of support to help start up and run a Green Gym project to The Conservation Volunteers standards. Under the Licence Agreement, organisations have the right to use the Green Gym name, and receive guidance and, if necessary, training on how to run a Green Gym group. The Licence Agreement may be renewed annually by mutual agreement. Origins and development The Green Gym concept was originally developed in the late 1990s by Dr William Bird an Oxford-based general practitioner and The Conservation Volunteers (then BTCV). The first pilot was held in 1997. By 2006 there were 55 projects across the United Kingdom with an estimated 6,000 people taking part. The programme has received support from central government,Department for Communities and Local Government - Special Grants Programme and won a Charity Award in 2005. Green Gym sessions What happens Green Gym groups meet at least once a week and do between 1 and 4 hours practical conservation or gardening work. All participants are Volunteers. Over two-thirds have never taken part in environmental conservation work before. Examples of the types of work undertaken include coppicing, clearing scrubland, path building, tree planting or digging on an allotment. The group usually meets at the project site. Sessions include a refreshment break and a chance to socialise. Activities are led by a qualified leader, and a session will typically run as follows: # 'Tool Talk' - the safe handling and correct use of tools are discussed # Warm up - exercises to prepare muscles for activity and reduce the risk of injury # Work session # Refreshments # Work session # Gather up tools # Cool down - exercises to prevent stiffness Health benefits Both physical and psychological benefits are claimed for people who attend Green Gym sessions regularly.Natural Fit: Can Green Space and Biodiversity Increase Levels of Physical Activity?

The title comes from one of the included poems, \\"On Burroughs' Work\\": \\"A naked lunch is natural to us,/we eat reality sandwiches.\\" The book is dedicated to friend and fellow Beat poet Gregory Corso. Despite Ginsberg's feeling that this collection was not his most significant, the poems still represent Ginsberg at a peak period of his craft.Morgan, Bill. I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg. Penguin Books. 2007 Poems in this collection include: *\\"My Alba\\" *\\"The Green Automobile\\" *\\"Siesta in Xbalba\\" *\\"On Burroughs' Work\\" *\\"Love Poem on Theme by Whitman\\" *\\"Malest Cornifici Tuo Catullo\\" *\\"Dream Record: June 8, 1955\\" *\\"A Strange New Cottage in Berkeley\\" *\\"My Sad Self\\" *\\"I Beg You Come Back & Be Cheerful\\" *\\"To An Old Poet In Per√∫\\" *\\"Aether\\" Selected works \\"On Burroughs' Work\\" According to legend, while Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac were editing Naked Lunch by William S. Burroughs, Kerouac suggested the title; when Ginsberg asked what it meant, Kerouac said they'd figure it out later. This is perhaps an attempt at understanding. It is unusual for a Ginsberg poem because it is so overtly metaphorical. This is likely a purposeful deviation from his normal style since he, for example, ironically calls symbolic language and allegories useless \\"dressing\\" and \\"lettuce.\\" The style overall suggests a parody of formal poetry. He uses allegories and near- rhymes: \\"those\\" and \\"Rose\\"; \\"us\\" and \\"lettuce\\"; \\"visions\\" and \\"prisons,\\" and so on. The form would be considered an imperfect ballad stanza, with the first and third lines in each stanza being nearly an iambic tetrameter and the first and third lines being nearly iambic trimeter. This is a traditional form used, for example, by William Wordsworth. The mistakes in the meter are likely purposeful; Ginsberg's early poetry suggests that he was fully capable of writing metered poetry. But this is perhaps not only an homage to Burroughs but an homage to Ginsberg's mentor William Carlos Williams. Williams encouraged Ginsberg to break away from meter and focus only the object with no \\"symbolic dressing.\\" Morgan, Bill. I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg. Penguin Books. 2007 \\"Dream Record: June 8, 1955\\" An account of a dream about an encounter with the apparition of Joan Vollmer who was shot to death when her husband, William S. Burroughs, in a drunken stupor, decided to play William Tell with a shot glass. Ginsberg had been in Mexico City visiting the couple only a short time before the shooting. He says at the beginning of the poem that he has returned to Mexico City. There he encounters Joan, and they talk about their friends: Jack Kerouac, Herbert Huncke, and someone named Kenney. Then, when Ginsberg realizes it is a dream and that Joan is dead, he asks more profound questions: \\"what kind of knowledge have the dead? can you still love your mortal acquaintances? what do you remember of us?\\" Ginsberg then sees a grave. This paratactical shift, according to Ginsberg, was a major breakthrough. This breakthrough was integral in the development of what he would call his \\"ellipse\\" technique or the \\"eyeball kick.\\" Ginsberg's study of haiku, Ezra Pound, Paul C√©zanne, and the poetry of the Surrealists was also important in the development of this technique, but Ginsberg often pointed to \\"Dream Record\\" as a breakthrough poem. This was also the poem that Ginsberg sent to Kenneth Rexroth which Rexroth hated because he said it was too stilted. Rexroth told Ginsberg he should free up his voice, write from his heart.Morgan, Bill. I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg. Penguin Books. 2007 Soon after that Ginsberg wrote Howl. Howl shows the effects of his earlier breakthrough: the \\"eyeball kick,\\" for example, is employed throughout the poem. \\"To An Old Poet In Per√∫\\" Allen Ginsberg was travelling in South America in 1960 with Lawrence Ferlinghetti. After being in Chile and Bolivia, he arrived alone to Per√∫, approximately in May. He spend some weeks camping near to Machu Picchu. Then in Lima he knew the Peruvian poet Mart√≠n Ad√°n who was living in the Hotel El Comercio where Ginsberg rented a room. During those days he wrote some poems of Reality Sandwiches, like the long \\"To An Old Poet In Per√∫\\" that has three parts: the one that named the poem, \\"Die Greatly In Thy Solitude\\" and \\"The Dazzling Intelligence\\". The poem describes a closer relationship and fine sympathy between the two poets. The poem was translated to Spanish by the Peruvian poet Antonio Cisneros and published on the # 7 of the Amaru magazine on 1968.

He was the last important composer of lute music in 18th-century Germany. Life Little is known about his youth, but he grew up in a musical family; his brother Peter Albrecht Hagen (also called Peter Albert van Hagen, 1714 - 12 September 1777) studied the violin with Francesco Geminiani, learned to play the lute and organ, and was an organist in Rotterdam. There are several transcriptions of Geminiani's violin works for lute by J.B. Hagen extant. The younger Bernhard Joachim Hagen must have learned to play lute and violin early too, for in 1737 he was already employed as an assistant to Bayreuth violin virtuoso and Kapellmeister Johann Pfeiffer; later he was listed officially as a court violinist. He kept this position at the Bayreuth and since 1769 the Ansbach court until his death. Adam Falckenhagen and Charles Durant (Karol Duranowski), also called to the Bayreuth court by Wilhelmine of Bayreuth, may have further trained him in playing the lute. In 1745, Hagen married Anna Fikentscher (born in Bayreuth; died 22 May 1789 in Ansbach). During 1760/1761 he visited his brother in Rotterdam and there gave five concerts from November till March. Works Hagen was employed at the Bayreuth court as a violinist and as a lutenist, and his virtuoso lute performances and his compositions for lute were known and appreciated. He is one of the most important composers for lute in the era following Sylvius Leopold Weiss, and far more important than his teachers Falckenhagen and Durant. His style is shaped by the Empfindsamkeit and the beginning of the Sturm und Drang period. There is a clearly discernible influence of Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach in Hagen's music. Through margravine Wilhelmine's efforts, lute music flourished in the 18th century one last time before being rediscovered in the 20th century. There are 33 known compositions by Bernhard Joachim Hagen found in the Staats- und Stadtbibliothek Augsburg: * 12 Sonatas for Lute solo * 6 Trios for Lute, Violin and Violoncello * 2 Lute concerti * 1 Duo for two Lutes * 1 Duo for Lute und Violin * Many Lute arrangements of compositions by Geminiani, Locatelli, Arne, and others. The facsimile editions of Hagen's solo lute sonatas (1983) and chamber works (1984) have been published by Joachim Domning for the Roman Trekel Musikverlag. There are two excellent CD recording of Hagen's sonatas by the lutenist Robert Barto: * Joachim Bernhard Hagen, Solo Works for Lute: Five Sonatas, Locatelli Variations (Naxos 8.554200) * Bernhard Joachim Hagen, Sonate √† Liuto solo (Symphonia Sy98164) Some of Hagen's works listed in the 1769 Breitkopf catalog (these have no concordances in Augsburg manuscripts) are presumed missing. Influence The lute sonatas of Roman Turovsky-Savchuk (a contemporary lutenist-composer) were written in homage to Hagen.

Early life After the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938, Jews were immediately targeted by the new Nazi regime with anti-Semitic decrees designed to make their lives untenable and force them to leave Austria. The decrees included prohibition of using public transportation, of being employed, and of operating businesses. Jews were expelled from schools and universities, had their businesses \\"Aryanized\\", a euphemism for their theft and confiscation by the Nazi regime, and were harassed with washing street signs of the previous regime in front of cheering and violent mobs. Eventually they were forced out of their apartments and prevented from leaving the country by themselves. While sitting in a cafe, Lind's father was picked up and arrested by the Gestapo, and shortly afterwards the family was ordered to evacuate their apartment within 24 hours. On the run, his mother managed to find a place for Lind and two sisters on a \\"Kindertransport\\" bound to the Netherlands. After Lind's father was somehow released, his parents struggled to leave Austria on a Danube barge bound for the Black Sea. There they boarded the ship Patria which was sunk with great loss of lives at Haifa Port in November 1940 by the Hagana in an effort to prevent the British from turning it back to Europe. As a child of 11 years in the Netherlands, Lind stayed initially in a children home in The Hague with his two sisters, but after a few months the siblings were separated and Lind moved in with a foster family who was paid by a Jewish organization towards his upkeep. After the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands on 10 May 1940, the situation became difficult for the family, and Lind had to leave. He spent various time periods with different families as well as in a youth center in Gouda. Lind moved to Amsterdam and stayed with the family Granaat, first in their home in Amsterdam South, then joining them when they were forced to evacuate their apartment and move into the Jewish Ghetto. During a roundup and deportation of Jews from the Ghetto in 1943, the family obeyed orders to leave the apartment and board lorries bound to Westerbork, while Lind stayed behind in hiding. On the run, Lind was able to obtain a false identity card bearing the name of Jan Gerrit Overbeek. Assuming this identity, Lind worked in different jobs in the Netherlands, and then decided to take a job on a German barge carrying coal into Germany. Lind succeeded in surviving inside Nazi Germany. Of this period, Lind later wrote, \\"As Jan Gerrit Overbeek, I felt safe for the first time. It is crazy, walking around freely when one really should be sitting in a concentration camp. Crazy, perhaps, but a craziness that made me content, and happy.\\" Writing career In 1945, Jan Gerrit Overbeek became Jakov Chaklan, and he made his way to Haifa. After a literary apprenticeship, a marriage, and the birth of a son, he moved to Vienna for three years. Finally, in 1954, he settled in London, where he wrote, in German, the short stories and novels on which his stature as a major European writer is based: Soul of Wood, Landscape in Concrete, and Ergo. Lind began writing in English, and the autobiography Counting My Steps was the first book written in his new language. On switching to English, Lind wrote that he was \\"Madder than anything...to think I could ever unlearn sounds I knew by heart and kidneys and replace them with other and better sounds.\\" His stories have been translated into English, German, Danish, Swedish, Dutch, French, Italian, Norwegian, Finnish, Spanish, Hungarian, and Czech. His work has been adapted into plays, operas, and films. A collection of essays about his life and writings has also been published,Writing After Hitler: the Work of Jakov Lind (2001).

Tom's sister, Marilyn Auer, is the magazine's current publisher and editor. History The Bloomsbury Review started as a newsletter for Bloomsbury Books & Pool near the University of Denver in 1978. It was named after the Bloomsbury Group of writers, philosophers and artists who lived in London during the 20th century. The first issue, published in May 1978, was a folded 12‚Äù x 16‚Äù 4-page promotional handout. The cover story was a short piece about the Bloomsbury Group, and the featured review was on \\"Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case\\" by Allen Weinstein. It was written by Tom Auer. By 1980, the newsletter had become a full-fledged magazine. \\"At that time, now the early 1980s, there were few decent publications about books. Most newspapers had either little or lousy book coverage, and the few general-interest magazines that made room for book reviews tended to cover the same best-selling titles and big-name authors,\\" Auer wrote in an essay published in TBR's 20th anniversary issue. Most attention was focused on the major book reviews out of New York, he wrote. \\"But they tended to neglect books by western writers, small presses, university presses, regional publishers, first novels, poetry, and other titles that wouldn‚Äôt be promoted much with advertising in their pages. Most of the U.S. was on the wrong side of the Hudson River, it seemed.\\" TBR, Auer wrote, would focus on those neglected books and publishers.

It is one of the most common ferns in eastern North America, being found in moist and shady habitats in woodlands, stream banks and rocky slopes. The common name derives from the evergreen fronds, which are often still green at Christmas. Description Christmas fern has a tufted, clumping habit, with its fronds arising from a central growth point. It can form colonies, but frequently grows singly or in twos or threes. In winter, the fertile fronds die; the sterile fronds remain through the winter, and are often flattened to the ground by low temperatures and snow cover. The frond is supported by a dark brown- to black-colored stipe, or stem, which is typically a quarter to a third of the overall frond length. Coarse, light-brown-to-tan scales cover the stipe, and are typically about 5 mm long and translucent. The coiled, developing fronds (\\"crosiers\\") are scaly, greyish and prominent in early spring. Fronds are 30 to 80 cm long and 5 to 12 cm broad, dark green and rather leathery in texture; their undersides may be covered in very sparse hairs. They have 20 to 35 pairs of pinnae. Each pinna is typically 4 cm long and has a finely serrulate or spiny edge, and is oblong to falcate in shape. The fine teeth or spines on the edge of the pinna are oriented towards its tip. Each pinna has a small, triangular, \\"thumblike\\" lobe at its base. The light brown spores are produced on fertile pinnae, at the frond's tip, which are conspicuously smaller than the sterile pinnae further down the frond.These fertile pinnae can be described as \\"acrostichoid\\", given that the sporangia occupy most of the lower surface of the pinna. Christmas fern resembles the Pacific Coast sword fern, Polystichum munitum, although forming less expansive tufts and differing from it and from almost all other ferns in that fertile pinnae of the Christmas fern are noticeably reduced in size relative to the sterile pinnae, while being located on the same frond. P. acrostichoides is known to hybridize with Polystichum braunii in areas where their ranges overlap. P. acrostichoides is parasitized by the fungus Taphrina polystichi, which causes yellowish to whitish galls on the fronds. Cultivation Christmas fern is popular in cultivation as an ornamental plant for gardens, including natural gardens, as it is easy to cultivate in a range of environments and soils. Being evergreen, it sometimes used in winter-oriented garden design . This fern can conserve soil and allay erosion of steep slopes. The fronds are semi-erect until the first killing frost, after which they lie prostrate on the ground and effectively hold in place the duff layer of the forest floor, enabling the gradual decomposition of the duff into humus, which in turn builds the soil  References  * Gallery Image:Christmas Fern Polystichum acrostichoides Curl Closeup 2000xpx.jpg|Coiled immature fronds Image:Christmas Fern Polystichum acrostichoides Unfurled 2000px.jpg|Newly unfurled frond Image:Christmas Fern Polystichum acrostichoides Leaf 2000px.JPG|Mature sterile frond File:Polystichum acrostichoides5.jpg|Sori External links USDA PLANTS Profile for Polystichum acrostichoides (Christmas fern) *Flora of North America: Polystichum acrostichoides acrostichoides Category:Garden plants of North America Category:Ferns of the Americas Category:Ferns of the United States ","title":"Polystichum acrostichoides"},{"id":"7149006","text":"Abd-Allah ibn Numayr (died 199 AH/814) was a narrator of hadith.

Factorization systems are a generalization of this situation in category theory. Definition A factorization system (E, M) for a category C consists of two classes of morphisms E and M of C such that: #E and M both contain all isomorphisms of C and are closed under composition. #Every morphism f of C can be factored as f=m\\\\circ e for some morphisms e\\\\in E and m\\\\in M. #The factorization is functorial: if u and v are two morphisms such that vme=m'e'u for some morphisms e, e'\\\\in E and m, m'\\\\in M, then there exists a unique morphism w making the following diagram commute: center Remark: (u,v) is a morphism from me to m'e' in the arrow category.  Orthogonality  Two morphisms e and m are said to be orthogonal, denoted e\\\\downarrow m, if for every pair of morphisms u and v such that ve=mu there is a unique morphism w such that the diagram center commutes. This notion can be extended to define the orthogonals of sets of morphisms by :H^\\\\uparrow=\\\\\\\\{e\\\\quad|\\\\quad\\\\forall h\\\\in H, e\\\\downarrow h\\\\\\\\} and H^\\\\downarrow=\\\\\\\\{m\\\\quad|\\\\quad\\\\forall h\\\\in H, h\\\\downarrow m\\\\\\\\}. Since in a factorization system E\\\\cap M contains all the isomorphisms, the condition (3) of the definition is equivalent to :(3') E\\\\subseteq M^\\\\uparrow and M\\\\subseteq E^\\\\downarrow. Proof: In the previous diagram (3), take m:= id ,\\\\ e' := id (identity on the appropriate object) and m' := m .  Equivalent definition  The pair (E,M) of classes of morphisms of C is a factorization system if and only if it satisfies the following conditions: #Every morphism f of C can be factored as f=m\\\\circ e with e\\\\in E and m\\\\in M. #E=M^\\\\uparrow and M=E^\\\\downarrow.  Weak factorization systems  Suppose e and m are two morphisms in a category C. Then e has the left lifting property with respect to m (respectively m has the right lifting property with respect to e) when for every pair of morphisms u and v such that ve = mu there is a morphism w such that the following diagram commutes. The difference with orthogonality is that w is not necessarily unique. center A weak factorization system (E, M) for a category C consists of two classes of morphisms E and M of C such that : #The class E is exactly the class of morphisms having the left lifting property with respect to each morphism in M. #The class M is exactly the class of morphisms having the right lifting property with respect to each morphism in E. #Every morphism f of C can be factored as f=m\\\\circ e for some morphisms e\\\\in E and m\\\\in M. This notion leads to a succinct definition of model categories: a model category is a pair consisting of a category C and classes of (so-called) weak equivalences W, fibrations F and cofibrations C so that * C has all limits and colimits, * (C \\\\cap W, F) is a weak factorization system, and * (C, F \\\\cap W) is a weak factorization system. A model category is a complete and cocomplete category equipped with a model structure. A map is called a trivial fibration if it belongs to F\\\\cap W, and it is called a trivial cofibration if it belongs to C\\\\cap W.

As part of the Arterial Drainage Scheme, designed to tackle poor drainage caused by Ireland‚Äôs relatively low-lying topography, the river was deepened and widened, leaving the river with the high banks distinctive of many of the rivers in the Irish midlands that received this treatment. More recently, in late 2008 the river was diverted from the N52 road beside Mullingar in order to accommodate a new roundabout and bridge.An investigation of the effects of an arterial drainage scheme on the rainfall-runoff transformation behaviour of the Brosna catchment in Ireland, Bhattarai, K.

His Chicago restaurant Alinea has won numerous accolades and Achatz himself has won numerous awards from prominent culinary institutions and publications, including the Food and Wine's \\"best new chefs\\" award in 1998, \\"Rising Star Chef of the Year Award\\" for 1999, \\"Best Chef in the United States\\" for 1998 and a 2003 \\"Who's Who Inductee\\" from the James Beard Foundation. Early life and education Achatz's early culinary career included time spent working in his parents' restaurants in St. Clair, Michigan as a teenager, followed by enrollment in The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Following graduation in 1994, Achatz landed a position at Charlie Trotter's. After a time, he found a position at Thomas Keller's highly acclaimed restaurant, The French Laundry, in Yountville, California. Achatz spent four years at The French Laundry, rising to the position of sous chef. Career In 2001, Achatz moved to the Chicago area to become the Executive Chef at Trio in Evanston, Illinois, which at the time of his arrival had a four-star rating from the Mobil Travel Guide. Over the next three years, with Achatz at the helm, Trio's reputation soared and in 2004 the restaurant was rewarded with a fifth star from Mobil, becoming one of just 13 restaurants so honored at the time. In 2005, Achatz went out on his own, opening Alinea in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood with Nick Kokonas. The restaurant is located up the block from the famed Steppenwolf Theatre Company and is housed in a modest gray brick building which bears no external markings beyond its street number. Inside, the restaurant has no bar, no lobby and seats just 64 guests. Achatz serves diners a small-course tasting menu, consisting of approximately 18 courses. After less than two years of operation, the Mobil Travel Guide bestowed its Five Star Award on Alinea, making Alinea one of just 16 restaurants nationwide to rate five stars for 2007. In October 2006, Gourmet magazine named Alinea the best restaurant in America in its feature on \\"America's Top 50 Restaurants\\". In 2007, Restaurant magazine added Alinea to its list of the 50 best restaurants in the world at number 36, the highest new entry of the year. In 2008, that publication moved Alinea up its list 15 spots, to number 21 in the world. In 2009 Alinea moved up to number 10 in the world and advanced to number 7 for 2010, when it was also the highest ranked North American restaurant honored. Alinea maintained its top North American Ranking for 2011, while moving up one position overall to 6th best restaurant in the world. In 2012, Alinea came down one spot on the list. Per Se gained the 6th place, thus making Alinea the 2nd best restaurant in the U.S. and 7th overall. In November 2009, Achatz and his Alinea team designed the menu for Ikarus, a restaurant in Salzburg, Austria which brings in a top chef from a different restaurant each month to design the menu for that month and train the staff. Alinea was awarded three stars in the 2011 Michelin Guide for Chicago. It was repeated in 2012 when Alinea was the only restaurant to receive three stars in the 2012 Michelin Guide for Chicago. Achatz's other restaurants include Next, a restaurant that uses a unique ticketing system in Chicago, and Aviary, a bar. Roister Chicago, a casual West Loop concept helmed by Chef Andrew Brochu, The Office, a speakeasy cocktail bar located under The Aviary bar, and The Aviary/ Office NYC located in the Mandarin Oriental, New York. Reservations for Achatz's restaurant, Next, are so sought after, that tickets could be found on Craigslist for up to $500 per person. In February 2012, Achatz held a Dutch Auction for tickets to Next's elBulli-inspired menu, raising over $275,000 for charity in just two days. Auction prices ranged from $4,000 to $5,000 for parties of two. Achatz has also served as a coach for the biennial culinary competition in Lyon, France, Bocuse d'Or. All restaurants use unique ticketing system and reservation platform Tock, which was founded by Nick Kokonas and of which Achatz serves as both an investor and hospitality advisor. In 2016 Achatz and partner Nick Kokonas closed Alinea for a complete renovation and overhaul of the food, space, and experience. In 2016 Achatz and his team launched two consecutive multi-week pop-up experiences in Madrid, Spain, and Miami, Florida, over the course of Alinea's closure. On May 27, 2016, Achatz appeared on season two of the Netflix series Chef‚Äôs Table. In 2018, Achatz appeared as a judge on the Netflix series The Final Table. Books In October 2008, Grant Achatz and co-author Nick Kokonas published Alinea, a hardcover coffee table book featuring more than 100 of the restaurant's recipes. The book's narrative follows life in the kitchen for Achatz and his crew, and includes more than 400 behind-the-scenes photographs by Lara Kastner. In June 2009, Achatz and Kokonas sold Life, On the Line, their dual-voiced recount of their collaboration on Alinea and Achatz's battle with cancer to Gotham Books. The book was released on March 3, 2011. Kokonas and Achatz have also released two digital cookbooks from Next Restaurant, one on the Apple iBook platform, and one in a more universal PDF format. As in the style of the Alinea cookbook, both books provide the exact recipes used during the Paris 1906 and Tour of Thailand menus, without making adjustments for the average home cook. While the Paris 1906 book was released for purchase via iTunes, Tour of Thailand was released on a pay-what-you-want model on Next's ticketing site. Grant was featured in a 2014 Dan Waldschmidt's book Edgy Conversations: How Ordinary People Can Achieve Outrageous Success, a book about preventing suicide with sense with stories about famous people that had disasters. Almost at the end of the book, he told the story about Grant's tongue cancer in July 2007 and the success of his restaurant in that time. Personal life On July 23, 2007, Achatz announced that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth, which may have spread to his lymph nodes. Initially, Achatz was told that only radical surgery was indicated, which would remove part of his mandibular anatomy and large swaths of neck tissue. Later, University of Chicago physicians prescribed a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. This led to full remission, albeit with some side effects including a transitory loss of his sense of taste, which eventually returned. On December 18, 2007, Achatz announced that he was cancer-free. He credited an aggressive protocol of chemotherapy and radiation therapy administered at the University of Chicago Medical Center for driving his cancer into full remission. The treatment regimen, administered under the direction of Drs. Vokes, Blair and Haraf at U of C, did not require radical invasive surgery on Achatz' tongue. He has two sons, Kaden and Keller. The latter name was chosen partly in honor of Achatz's mentor Thomas Keller.Grant Achatz and Nick Kokonas, Life, On the Line, Penguin Group, 2012 p. 280 Awards * Best New Chefs, Food & Wine Magazine, 2002 * Best Restaurant in America, Gourmet Magazine, 2006 * 40 Top Chicago Restaurants Ever, Chicago Magazine, #1, 2010 * AAA Five Diamond Award, AAA, 2007‚Äì2017 * Mobil Five Star Award, Mobil Travel Guide, 2007‚Äì2017 * Jean Banchet Award ‚Äì Best Celebrity Chef, 2007 * Jean Banchet Award ‚Äì Best Fine Dining, 2007 * The S.

Early life The scion of an ancient and distinguished Shropshire family, Dalberg-Acton was born in Bavaria, in the then German Empire. He was the first and only surviving son of The 1st Baron Acton, a historian and politician, and his German wife, Marie Anna Ludomilla Euphrosina Gr√§fin von Arco auf Valley. He completed his education in England at Magdalen College, Oxford. Diplomatic career Dalberg-Acton entered the British Foreign Office in 1894. He began a career in Europe as Third Secretary in the Diplomatic Service at the British Embassy in Berlin in 1896.

Biography Edmund English was born in Cappawhite Tipperary Ireland, on November 16, 1841, the seventh of eight children of Thomas English (1795-1874) and Anne Nancy Hogan (1793-1888). They immigrated to the United States around the time of the famine to New York but were in Philadelphia by the 1850 census. Military service After the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted in the 2nd New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, and was mustered in as a Corporal in Company C on May 27, 1861. He served with his regiment, which was part of the famed First New Jersey Brigade, as it fought in June‚ÄìJuly 1862 Seven Days Battles, August 1862 Battle of Second Bull Run, and September 15, 1862, Battle of South Mountain. On July 21, 1862, he received promotion to Sergeant, which was followed by a September 21, 1862, promotion to 1st Sergeant of his company. From December 12-15, English and the 2nd New Jersey fought at the Battle of Fredericksburg. After the winter encampment and the infamous Mud March, in January of 1863, English and the 2nd fought were reorganized into the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of VI Corps with whom they would serve to the war's end. In May, they fought in the Chancellorsville Campaign seeing action at the Second Battle of Fredericksburg May 3-4 where they took the stonewall that had stopped them almost five months before. During the ensuing Gettysburg Campaign, they saw action on the first and third days. English and the 2nd continued with the Army of the Potomac through the Bristoe, Mine Run, and Overland Campaigns. It was during the Battle of the Wilderness, Virginia (May 6, 1864), he performed his act of bravery that garnered him the Medal of Honor. In 1905, W. F. Beyer wrote in Deeds of Valor: He was eventually captured by the Confederates at the Battle of the Bloody Angle at Spotsylvania and was paroled the following February at Petersburg. It was as a paroled prisoner that he was formally discharged at Trenton, New Jersey, on February 28, 1865, much later than his official end of his term of service, which was in June 1864. He later re-enlisted in Winfield S. Hancock's Corps of veteran volunteers, serving first as Sergeant Major of the 6th United States Veteran Volunteers. Later, he was promoted to first lieutenant and transferred to the 7th United States Veteran Volunteers. He was mustered out of Federal service in July 23, 1866, having served over 5 full years. Postwar life After the war, he returned to Philadelphia and opened a grocery market in Philadelphia. In 1866, he married Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" M. Mahaffy (1845-1868), a fellow Irish immigrant from Ulster. He moved in with her family. He and Lizzie had two daughters who did not survive infancy, and Lizzie passed away in 1868. In 1869, he married her younger sister, Jane Anastasia Mahaffy (1846-1899). With her, he had three daughters and two sons of whom Francis Xavier English (1874‚Äì1935), Anne Estella English(1875‚Äì1941), and Agnes Hortense English (1876‚Äì1897) survived to adulthood. By the 1880 census, they were residing at 1129th Ellsworth St, in Philadelphia with her parents, Charles and Annie Mahaffy, her sister, Susan Mahaffy, and Francis, Annie, and Agnes. The ongoing review of official War Records by the War Department in the second half of the nineteenth century led to English's nomination for the Medal of Honor. His medal was awarded to him on February 13, 1891. On April 13, 1897, Jane and Edmund lost their youngest daughter Agnes. On March 5, 1899, Jane passed on. Edmund continued on running the grocery store with Francis and Anne. On May 31, 1912, Edmund English died, survived by his son and daughter, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was buried in the Old Cathedral Cemetery there.

Gordon. Gordon, who lived in Platte County, Missouri, had been conducting numerous raids and was suspected of masterminding the September 3, 1861, Platte Bridge Railroad Tragedy in which a Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad train was derailed on a sabotaged bridge across the Platte River (Missouri River) by St. Joseph, Missouri, killing 17 to 20 and injuring 100. Union troops went to capture Gordon in November 1861 but were stopped in a brief skirmish at Bee Creek, in which two Federals were killed and Gordon and his men left after running out of ammunition. Gordon with 30 to 40 men captured Weston, Missouri, in early December and carried off two Federal soldiers as captives. They camped on the lawn of the Platte County Courthouse in Platte City and Gordon was said to swagger around the square with a large sword at his side. Gordon stole county records from the courthouse and threatened to kill the district judge if he came to Platte City. Union General David Hunter issued an order from neighboring Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for Platte County to either deliver Gordon or have the city burned. In early December, Colonel W. James Morgan of the 18th Missouri Infantry USA marched from St. Joseph to Platte City and set fire to the city and courthouse and captured three Confederate soldiers either home on furlough or returned home following the expiration of the terms of their enlistment. On December 17 Morgan ignored the pleas for leniency from the father of one the prisoners named Black Triplett. Instead, Morgan took Triplett and prisoner Gabriel Close to the Bee Creek site where the Federals had been killed. Triplett was executed outright and Case was bayonetted as he fled. The letters \\"U.S.\\" were scrawled in Triplett's blood on the Bee Creek bridge. (See Bee Creek Massacre.) Gordon was to engage in further guerrilla activities elsewhere in Missouri and Texas. In 1864 he returned to Platte City and Union troops once again burned the city.

It is a grade 2 listed building. History From the 12th to the late 18th century, Thornbridge Hall was the seat of the Longsdon family. In 1790, John Morewood bought Thornbridge Hall for the then very large sum of ¬£10,000. He made his money exporting linens from Manchester to St Petersburg in Russia. The Morewood family considerably enlarged the house. In 1859, Frederick Craven rebuilt the house in Jacobean style and installed the William Morris/Edward Burne-Jones window in the Great Hall. In 1896, George Marples, a Sheffield businessman and lawyer, extended the house to nearly its present form, built lodges and cottages, landscaped the park and gardens, added his own private railway station, and acquired the Watson buffet fountain from Chatsworth House. From 1929, Charles Boot, the Sheffield entrepreneur who designed and built Pinewood Studios, added items from Clumber Park and panelling from Derwent Hall. His company, Henry Boot Construction, was contracted to demolish Clumber after a fire in 1938. It was Boot who was responsible for bringing the many items to Thornbridge, although most were lost to private buyers through auction. Thornbridge Hall is now home to a vast array of statues, facades and fountains originally belonging to Clumber. Sheffield City Council took over the house in 1945 and it became a teacher training college, Thornbridge Hall College of Education. At this time the house was of sufficient note that a Great Western Railway GWR 6959 Class steam locomotive ‚Äì No. 6964, built in May 1944 ‚Äì was named Thornbridge Hall in June 1947. It was withdrawn from service in September 1965 and later scrapped at T. Ward in Beighton, Sheffield. In later years, the hall was used as an educational and conference centre by the council, providing residential facilities for teachers and pupils in the house itself and in various outbuildings. The Hunt family purchased the house from the Council in 1997, started restoration work to the gardens, and removed additions to the house to reveal its earlier proportions. Gardens The 12 acres of formal gardens were designed at the end of the 19th century by Simeon Marshall, working for the internationally acclaimed James Backhouses & Sons Nursery. They were inspired by the vision of the owner, George Marples, to create a '1000 shades of green' to be viewed from his bedroom window. Areas of the garden include the Italian Garden, Scented Terrace, Water Garden, Koi Pond, Kitchen Garden and Orangery, amongst others. A programme of redevelopment in the gardens is currently underway. 2011 Scented Terrace created. Situated below the Kitchen Garden and The Orangery. The garden is full of lilacs, roses, bearded irises, lilies and other fragrant flowers and plants. 2017 New Knot Garden created. Replacing a box hedge knot garden, the new knot garden is full of stunning grasses, salvias, alliums, geums and yew 2019 Cascade Garden (phase1) created. Situated below the koi pond, and complete with a waterfall, this area has been terraced by gabions filled with a mixture of tufa and yew. Bananas, ginger, tree ferns, bamboo, gunnera and many other 'exotic' plants fill this area. In 2017, the gardens became an RHS (Royal Horticultural Society) Partner Garden. They are open to the public on selected days between April and September. Present use The house in 2006 From 2002, Thornbridge Hall has been owned by Jim and Emma Harrison, owners of Thornbridge Brewery and A4e respectively, and is both a private family home and a venue for events, including weddings. The gardens are open to the public every Wednesday and Thursday, between April and September. The original Thornbridge Brewery was based in a converted joiner's and stonemason‚Äôs workshop within the grounds of Thornbridge Hall. It aims \\"to make a small range of quality cask and bottled beers using new recipes, innovative approaches and the use of local fresh ingredients\\". Its first beers appeared in February 2005 and have won awards.

A sun photometer is a type of photometer conceived in such a way that it points at the sun. Recent sun photometers are automated instruments incorporating a sun-tracking unit, an appropriate optical system, a spectrally filtering device, a photodetector, and a data acquisition system. The measured quantity is called direct-sun radiance. When a sun-photometer is placed somewhere within the earth's atmosphere, the measured radiance is not equal to the radiance emitted by the sun (i.e. the solar extraterrestrial radiance), because the solar flux is reduced by atmospheric absorption and scattering. Therefore, the measured radiant flux is due to a combination of what is emitted by the sun and the effect of the atmosphere; the link between these quantities is given by Beer's law. The atmospheric effect can be removed with Langley extrapolation; this method therefore allows measuring the solar extraterrestrial radiance with ground-based measurements. Once the extraterrestrial radiance is known, one can use the sun photometer for studying the atmosphere, and in particular for determining the atmospheric optical depth. Also, if the signal at two or more suitably selected spectral intervals is measured, one can use the information derived for calculating the vertically integrated concentration of selected atmospheric gases, such as water vapour, ozone, etc.  See also  * Dobson ozone spectrophotometer * AERONET References * Glenn E.

Early life and life with Curry Little is known about Moore's early years. She is believed to have been born around 1880 in Texas near El Paso. She was pretty, with a petite build, and began working in brothels in Mena, Arkansas, Fort Worth and San Antonio around the age of 15. By 1899, she was working in the famous brothel of Madame Fannie Porter, having met and becoming involved with Curry some time around mid-1898. She would help hide Curry after his robberies, and often helped him resupply before he would leave again. By 1900, Moore had left prostitution and began traveling with Curry, who was between robberies. The two traveled to Tennessee where they met with other members of the gang to include Ben Kilpatrick and Laura Bullion. On October 14th, 1901, Moore was arrested in Nashville, Tennessee for passing notes associated with an earlier robbery Curry had committed. She and Curry never saw one another again. She was jailed, but was later acquitted on June 18, 1902. There is no evidence to suggest that Moore and Curry reunited after her release from jail. Both Kilpatrick and Bullion were arrested in St. Louis, Missouri while she was incarcerated, and Curry killed two Knoxville policemen to avoid capture only one day after their capture. He was later captured, but escaped again. She traveled to Arkansas, where she returned to prostitution, and by the time that Curry was killed in Colorado by a posse in 1904, Moore had returned to Texas, and for a time, she worked again for Fannie Porter in her brothel. It is believed that she later became a teacher, dying around 1926, but that is unconfirmed. She often changed her name, and it is not known what path her life took after her involvement with Curry. It is unknown if they ever married.

As an early war airfield, it had no hard runways, but otherwise had all of the facilities and dispersed sites of similar later stations in other parts of Britain. Twenty circular hard- standings were spaced around the perimeter track, some connected to it, with others simply circles on the grass. On its completion, due to the threat of invasion, the field was obstructed by the Royal Engineers, to prevent enemy landings. As No. 20 Operational Training Unit RAF at Lossiemouth expanded, Elgin was cleared and became available for use on 30 June 1940.

It is situated near Kenton Lane in Kenton and is one of the largest academies in the United Kingdom, educating around 2,000 pupils across Key Stage 3 to 5. Kenton School is a specialist Arts and Technology School and has been granted several marks of achievement including a Gold Artsmark from the Arts Council of England and a 2008 Sportsmark. The sixth form building is used by both sixth formers and pupils attending the main academy as well as working as a local community college (Kenton College). A 2012 Ofsted report graded the school as Good, a drop from the Outstanding status they obtained in 2009.  History  Construction on the original Kenton School started in 1958, and the school was opened by the Right Honourable Lord Morrison of Lambeth, better known as Herbert Morrison, on Friday 17 March 1961. The development of the school continued through the addition of new buildings. East Block was the first to be built ‚Äì closely followed by West Block in 1961, the plans for these buildings were submitted in 1957 and approved in 1958. South Block was added to the site in 1971 which was linked to the main school by the addition of a corrugated green fibreglass-clad bridge connecting South Block to West Block. Eventually, the Green Bridge lost its colour, having been reclad in grey-painted corrugated metal, and remained in place all the way until demolition of the buildings between 2008 and 2009. The school also had its own adjoining swimming pool. In 1978 North Block was added to the rear of East Block, following the closure of the adjacent Roman Catholic school, and finally, most notably in 1999, a new College Building was added to the campus. The College Building was officially opened by the then Schools Minister, Estelle Morris. Following 47 years in the original school buildings, the school moved into a new state-of-the-art building in Autumn 2008 and had its official opening on Friday, 2 July 2010. The new school was officially opened by the film director and former Kenton School pupil, Mike Figgis.

Academy conversion In 2011, the school undertook consultation to investigate conversion to Academy status. This was met with criticism by the NAS/UWT, the NUT, and the ATL, representatives of whom took strike action in September of that year. On 1 May 2012 Kenton School officially converted to an Academy. Throughout the process it was decided that the school's name would not change although for legal reasons Kenton School (Newcastle) is its registered name.  Studio school In September 2014, Kenton Academy opened a new studio school, Studio West, in the West Denton area of Newcastle upon Tyne. Studio West is based on the All Saints College site, after All Saints College closed in the summer of 2014.  The Kentonian  Kenton School has a newspaper, The Kentonian.

() He was director of the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle from 1945 to 1951. Jeannel's most important work was on the insect fauna of caves in the Pyrenees, France and in the Carpathians, Romania. He also worked in Africa. Jeannel specialised in Leiodidae (then Silphidae or Catopidae) but authored a large number of papers and works on other Coleoptera. He was a member of the Romanian Academy. As the son of a medical officer in the French military, Jeannel was expected to succeed his father. However, after developing an interest, during his studies in Toulouse, in cave exploration and especially cave fauna, he began considering a career in biological science instead. His interest was especially stimulated when he discovered two new cave beetles in the Grotte d‚ÄôOxibar (named after him by Abeille de Perrin: Bathyscia jeanneli and Aphaenops jeanneli.Schilthuizen, M. 2015. Nature's Nether Regions. Penguin In 1905 he began a life-long friendship and collaboration with Romanian biologist Emile Racovitza. In the first 17 years alone they jointly explored 1,400 caves in southern Europe and North Africa and published descriptions of the caves and their fauna. When Racovitza was invited to found a biospeleological institute in Cluj, Jeannel became his deputy director until 1927, when Jeannel obtained a chair in entomology in the Paris museum. Despite his administrative positions, Jeannel remained a productive scientist. In 1911, when he published his 641-page, 657-illustration doctoral thesis on Leptodirini (then called Bathysciinae), he had already produced more than 30 papers. During the rest of his career, he added another 500 scientific publications to this total, together amounting to more than 20,000 published pages‚Äîmostly on cave insects and all illustrated by himself. Jeannel's most important contribution to taxonomy was the fact that he realised the potential of using the genitalia for species identification and classification. Genitalia evolve faster than external parts of the body and therefore the differences between species are greater. In his book l‚Äô√âd√©age (1955), he summarized all the insights the study of the aedeagus (the term used for the male beetle genital apparatus) had afforded him.  Works  * Paris, Libraire A.

He represented the Jorhat constituency of Assam and was a member of the Indian National Congress (INC) political party. He was the only son of Krishna Kanta Handique, a renowned Indologist. B K Handique was a senior Member of Parliament from the North Eastern Region and represented the Jorhat Lok Sabha, Assam for six consecutive terms since 1991 to 2009. He also served as a Rajya Sabha member from 1980 to 1986. He had been elected to the Assam State Assembly in 1971 from the Jorhat Town constituency. Biography Early life and education Handique studied English literature at Presidency College, Calcutta (now Kolkata). He went on to complete M.A. in English from the University of Calcutta. He attended Jorhat Government Boys‚Äô Higher Secondary School in his formative years. In Class VII, he joined the local Students' Congress, during India's freedom movement. There, he mobilised other students in a 'Vote for Congress' campaign, before the Assam provincial elections of 1945. He organised literary circles for talks around freedom. This was much against the wishes of his father, who then wanted him to pursue a career in academics.Conversation with B K Handique and others He became a member of Youth Congress formally in 1961. 1962: School In the early 1960s, Handique became concerned about the lack of an English medium school in the vast Upper Assam area. This led him to eventually establish the Hemlata Handiqui Memorial Institute [HHMI], the first English medium school in Upper Assam, in 1962. This eventually developed HHMI, which encouraged students to take up subjects as diverse as workshops on music and Shakespeare. The task was not without its hiccups, though land for the school was purchased by Handique's family. Within months of the school starting its first classes, the Indo-China war of 1962 broke out. This created panic in Jorhat, and many teachers and students fled from the town. He assisted the Red Cross in their efforts at training and organisation.B K Handique, \\"Time Present, Time Past: HHMI 1962-2012, Jorhat, 2012\\" Handique donated his mother's jewellery to the war effort.B K Handique, \\"Time Present, Time Past: HHMI 1962-2012, Jorhat, 2012 \\"Many people fled following the Chinese aggression and the fall of Tawang and Bomdila in the northeastern sector. There was great panic. Out first principal, J S Walters, went missing. He left without notice, taking only his bicycle with him. Due to fears of a full scale war, the school was closed for a month.\\"B K Handique, \\"Time Present Time Past: HHMI 1962-2012\\" Commemorative volume, Jorhat In 2012, the school celebrated its 60th anniversary. Handique composed a song for the occasion, set to tune by a former student. 1970s: Assam State Assembly 1980-1985: Rajya Sabha Handique was a member of: * Consultative Committee, Ministry of Education & Sports Affairs (1980‚Äì90) * Committee of Privileges (1984‚Äì85) * Committee on Welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (1982‚Äì84) After 1986, he stayed on the Consultative Committee, Ministry of Education & Sports Affairs until 1990. 1991-1996: 10th Lok Sabha Handique was a member of: * Committee on Industry (1991-1996) * Committee on Food &Supplies; (1991-1996) * Committee on Official Language (1991-1996) * Consultative Committee, Ministry of Petroleum (1991-1996) 1996-1999: 11th and 12th Lok Sahba Handique was a member of: * Committee on Industry (1998-1999) * Consultative Committee, Ministry of External Affairs (1997-1999) * Chairman, Railway Convention Committee, (1998-1999) Position on AFSPA: The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 Handique has been critical of the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) and has given his views on the floor of Parliament. The Act gives the Indian Army immunity to arrest without warrant on suspicion, shoot and kill any citizen in areas deemed disturbed by the government, without any recourse to scrutiny. AFPSA is currently implemented in certain parts of Northeast India and Kashmir. In July 1998 at the Lok Sahba debates, he said, ‚ÄúThe Armed Forces operating in the insurgency-prone Northeast, was never examined to assess that this could degenerate into a Draconian piece of legislation‚Ä¶ an Army officer armed with such power to kill, an immunity under the Act, is naturally instigated to invoke such powers right from the word ‚Äògo‚Äô in a confrontation... If fighting terrorism is a state of mind, then causing deaths, while tackling the terrorists, is also likely to be registered on an Army personnel's state of mind. So it's full of paradox. Government deploys the Army to fight the terrorists for the protection of its citizens, but it's the common men and women who are caught in the crossfire and suffer the most... I understand the feelings where brutal operations were conducted under the Armed Forces Act. It's true that the scars on the soul cannot be bartered away with economic packages.‚ÄùLok Sabha Debates; July 1998 1999-2004: 13th Lok Sabha Handique was a member of: * Lok Sabha Rules Committee (1999-2004) * Consultative Committee, Ministry of External Affairs (1999-2004) * Committee on Petroleum and Chemicals (1999-2000) 2004-2009: 14th Lok Sabha, Minister of State Handique held the following positions: * Union Minister of State, Chemicals & Fertilizers, 2006 ‚Äì2009 * Union Minister of State, Parliamentary Affairs, 2004-2007 * Union Minister of State, Defence, 2004 ‚Äì2006 Before he took ministerial responsibilities in 2004, Handique frequently spoke on Parliamentary processes and procedures to Central government probationary officers including Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officers. These lectures were organised by the Bureau of Parliamentary Studies and Training. As Minister of State and Cabinet Minister for seven years in the 14th and part of 15th Lok Sabha (between June 2004 and July 2011), Handique participated in debates on behalf of the government. Only starred questions and replies have been included in the three volumesB K Handique, \\"A LIfe in Parliament,\\" New Delhi, 2013 for economy of space. Under Parliamentary proceedings, ministers do not ask questions, but reply to questions of Members. They also do not introduce private member bills. They include debates on Assam Appropriation Bill, Assam State legislature (Delegation of Powers) Bill, 1981, Floods in Assam, Chaparmukh-Silghat Railway line Bill, Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Bill, Tea (Amendment) Bill, Gangtok Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, among others. Bills of national importance include Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Bill, The Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 1985, Handloom Bill, The Copyrights (Amendment) Bill, National Health Policy, General Budgets and Finance Bills, among others. ‚ÄúScope of a Minister as a Parliamentarian, is of course different from that of a Member of Parliament. How I speak as an M.P. from the Treasury Benches, as a Member in Opposition and as a member of the Council of Ministers follow conventionally different patterns,‚Äù Handique writes in his foreword to A Life in Parliament. 2009-2014: 15th Lok Sabha, Cabinet Minister Minister of Mines He was the Minister of Mines from May 2009 to 18 January 2011,Minister of Development of North Eastern Region from May 2009 to July 2011 and Minister of State, Defence & Parliamentary Affairs, Mines & Chemicals and Fertilizers between 2004 and 2009 In the 15th Lok Sabha elections, Handique won from the Jorhat constituency for the sixth consecutive term and was promoted to Union Cabinet minister status. He formally took the oath of office as Union Cabinet Minister holding dual charges of Mines and the Development of North East Region (DoNER) portfolios. Handique was appointed a Minister of State for Defence and Parliamentary Affairs in 2004, and then was a Minister of State for Chemicals & Fertilizers and Mines up to 2009. It was during his tenure as Union Cabinet Minister of Mines from May 2009 to January 2011 that a new direction was given to the Nation's Mining Policy with the clause for participation and inclusion of local communities in mining belts including tribal areas. The Draft mining bill initiated by Handique was due for introduction in the Indian Parliament. Handique proposed that 26% of equity or profits from the mining operations of a company should go to the people directly affected by the mining operations. In the present policy climate of promoting private profits at public cost, this came as refreshingly and an almost revolutionary suggestion. He proposed that this was the only way to give the local tribal populations in mining areas a stake in their operations. The government was concerned about the large-scale resistance and unrest faced all over the country in response to its forced land acquisition policies. The Maoist insurgency, described as the biggest threat to Indian democracy by India's 'scholarly' PM Manmohan Singh, is active precisely, where all the prime & easily accessible ‚Äì read most profitable ‚Äì mineral deposits were located. Handique proposed to make locals ‚Äìproject affected people [PAP]- the stakeholders in the project, and thus remove major impediment in expansion of old or development of new mines. His initiative had blessings, or so it looked, from the highest power centre in Congress Party, its president herself: \\"The new legislation is being framed amid UPA chief Sonia Gandhi voicing concerns over land acquisition norms and favouring the Haryana model ‚Äì where farmers are provided lucrative compensation in addition to annuity for 33 years.\\" During his tenure, Handique came under terrific pressure to sell off the government's stakes in profitable mining companies like Coal India Ltd and Hindustan Copper Ltd, to private players. Despite that, he reasoned that since it was difficult to value these companies and because the benefits of privatisation were not obvious, the government would not sell its stake.The decision not to sell is reported here. To date, this remains the government's position. He also blocked the privatisation-by-stealth strategy of mining companies like Vedanta Resources. These companies would form joint ventures with state owned mining companies to appropriate the profits from operations. Handique also tried to deal with the problem of illegal mining in places like Bellary. He initiated the probes and investigations that eventually led to the arrest of G Janardhana Reddy and his brothers, illegal miners and the richest politicians of Karnataka in September, 2011.see also Details of Janardhana Reddy are here. During his tenure, global iron ore prices were ruling high, and extraordinary amount of ore, much of it mined illegally, were being exported. Handique proposed a windfall tax on ore exported to raise resources for the people adversely affected by projects. Despite his proposal for a windfall tax, Handique was not in favour of banning mining activities in any state. He requested chief ministers of all mining states to cooperate with the government's efforts to clean up mining and ensure proper revenue collection. Minister of Development of the North Eastern Region During his tenure as Minister of Development of North Eastern Region, he initiated many major policy changes regarding connectivity, promotion of youth and industry in the Region. His amiable style of functioning had endeared him to the populace of the right North Eastern States. His acceptability was backed by his thorough understanding of the Region. Integration of the Region to the Mainstream was the central focus which he was successfully pursuing as the Minister of DoNER. Post-Cabinet Minister activities After tendering his resignation as Cabinet Minister, Handique was appointed chairman of the newly constituted parliamentary Standing Committee for Welfare of Other Backward Classes. After 2012, he was a member of the Indian National Congress‚Äô Central Election Committee. The 14-member panel, chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, is entrusted with the task of selecting party candidates for state and national elections. Controversies Parliamentary participation In February 2014, before the Lok Sabha elections, some sections of Assamese media carried scurrilous reports suggesting that Handique had been an inactive member of Parliament, asking \\"Only one question in his 22 years in Parliament.\\" Handique responded to this, pointing out that his Parliamentary interventions amounted to nearly 1,000 pages of printed matter, as collected in A LIfe in Parliament. The media was then forced to print his entire rebuttal, thereby admitting to their errors. Personal life Handique married Swarup Rani Borgohain in 1965. He had three married daughters and two grandchildren. In retirement, He was an occasional poet and whole time environmentalist. He was deeply interested in wildlife and conservation. Awards and accolades Handique was conferred the Venu Menon National Animal Award for Leadership in Conservation in the year 2006, for his key role in conservation of rare birds. Books Handique's debates, speeches & interventions as a Parliamentarian during the last 35 years (including one term in Rajya Sabha) have been recorded in three unedited volumes: * A Life in Parliament: Volume 1 (Rajya Sabha 1980-1986) * A Life in Parliament: Volume II (Lok Sabha 1991-2004) * A Life in Parliament: Volume III (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha 2004-2014) The three volumes, which run into nearly 1,000 pages, contain debates on a wide range of topics related to Assam, the Northeast and the nation.

The temple dates back to the Ayutthaya era, when it was known as Wat Sakae (‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏™‡∏∞‡πÅ‡∏Å). When Bangkok became the capital, King Rama I (1737‚Äì1809) renovated the temple and gave it its present name. Its name roughly translated as \\"wash hair\\". Since it was believed that on the way the king returned from the war. He stopped by to take a bath and wash his hair here, before entering inner city. Phu Khao Thong Phu Khao Thong (‚ÄúGolden Mountain‚Äù, ) is a steep artificial hill inside the Wat Saket compound. Rama I's grandson, King Rama III (1788‚Äì1851), decided to build a chedi of huge dimensions inside Wat Saket, but the chedi collapsed during construction because the soft soil of Bangkok could not support the weight. Over the next few decades, the abandoned mud-and-brick structure acquired the shape of a natural hill and was overgrown with weeds. The locals called it the phu khao (‡∏†‡∏π‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤), as if it were a natural feature.Old photo (around 1900) of dilapidated prang from the collection of Cornell University Library (last access 2009-09-24). During the reign of King Rama IV, construction began of a small chedi on the hill. It was completed early in the reign of his son, King Rama V (1853‚Äì1910). A relic of the Buddha was brought from Sri Lanka and placed in the chedi. The surrounding concrete walls were added in the 1940s to stop the hill from eroding.Wikimapia: Temple of the Golden Mount or Phu Khao Thong (‡∏†‡∏π‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏≠‡∏á) -Bangkok (Krungthep) The modern Wat Saket was built in the early 20th century of Carrara marble.Norwich 2001, p. 266 An annual festival is held at Wat Saket every November, featuring a candlelight procession up Phu Khao Thong to the chedi,Emmons 2008, p. 64 along with a long red robe wrapped around the chedi, similar to \\"Hae Pha Khuen That\\" (‡πÅ‡∏´‡πà‡∏ú‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏Ç‡∏∂‡πâ‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏∏) festival of Wat Phra Mahathat, Nakhon Si Thammarat province in sounthern. Devotees write their names and names of family members on the robe and set the mind to pray, believed to have been fulfilled in prayer. This festival has been carried on since the reign of King Rama V. At the same period, a great Loi Krathong festival will take place at the temple, along with freak shows such as Phi Krasue (\\"floating female ghost head with glowing viscera dangling below\\", ), Khon Song Hua (\\"two-headed man\\", ), Mia Ngu (\\"snake's wife\\", ), or fun games Sao Noi Tok Nam (\\"little girl falling into water\\", ) etc. It has been well known among Bangkokians since the past, also at nearby Fort Mahakan community was a hub of the fireworks shop. But after the demolition of the fort and its community, fireworks trading has been banned ever since. Phu Khao Thong is now a popular Bangkok tourist attraction and has become a symbol of the city. Panoramic view from the Golden Mount Vultures of Wat Saket In the early Rattanakosin period (between reigns of Rama I to Rama V) Wat Saket was often used as a place to cremate the dead within the city walls. Since it was located outside the city wall Siamese in those days had a tradition not to cremate the dead within the city walls, because it was believed to cause portentous. The bodies of the dead will be conveyed from the west gate known as the \\"Pratu Phi\\" (‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ï‡∏π‡∏ú‡∏µ, \\"ghost gate\\", later neighbouring area Samran Rat). In the year 1820 corresponding to the reign of King Rama II (1809‚Äì1824), cholera spread from Penang to Bangkok leading to more than 30,000 deaths in the capital. Wat Saket became the main receiving ground of many dead bodies that were moved in everyday, along with Wat Sangwet in Banglampoo and Wat Choeng Lane in Sampheng. Due to the large number of the deaths, the temple was unable to cremate every dead body, therefore, left some of them in the open area of the monastery where vultures began coming to devour those bodies. The communicable disease kept spreading every dry season in Siam until the early reign of King Rama V, and the temple became the main food court for vultures. Most severe was in 1840 during the reign of King Rama III when one out of ten people in Siam and the surrounding areas were killed by the disease. The last spreading of the disease took place in 1881. At that time as many as hundreds died each day. These miserable events are in the memory of contemporary Siamese, until it was said that \\"Raeng Wat Saket\\" (‡πÅ‡∏£‡πâ‡∏á‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏™‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏®, \\"vultures of Wat Saket\\"), paired with \\"Pret Wat Suthat\\" (‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏ï‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏®‡∏ô‡πå, \\"preta of Wat Suthat\\").

(1999). Trees of Britain and Europe. Collins .Flora Europaea: Buxus sempervirensBritish Trees: Buxus sempervirens Buxus colchica of western Caucasus and B. hyrcana of northern Iran and eastern Caucasus are commonly treated as synonyms of B. sempervirens.Med-Checklist: Buxus colchica Description Buxus sempervirens is an evergreen shrub or small tree growing up to 1 to (3 to ) tall, with a trunk up to in diameter (exceptionally to 10 m tall and 45 cm diameterTree Register of the British Isles). Arranged in opposite pairs along the stems, the leaves are green to yellow-green, oval, 1.5‚Äì3 cm long, and 0.5‚Äì1.3 cm broad. The hermaphrodite flowers are inconspicuous but highly scented, greenish-yellow, with no petals, and are insect pollinated; the fruit is a three-lobed capsule containing 3-6 seeds. Distribution and habitat The species typically grows on soils derived from chalk, limestone, usually as an understorey in forests of larger trees, most commonly associated with European beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests, but also sometimes in open dry montane scrub, particularly in the Mediterranean region. Box Hill, Surrey is named after its notable box population, which comprises the largest area of native box woodland in England.Mitchell, A. F. (1974). A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe. Collins Bean, W. J. (1976). Trees and Shrubs Hardy in the British Isles 8th ed., vol. 1. John Murray . The species is locally naturalised in parts of North America. Cultivation Box topiary in the garden of Alden Biesen Castle, Belgium In Britain, four Roman burials featured coffins containing sprays of the evergreen box, a practice unattested elsewhere in Europe. Box leaves have also been found from several towns, villas and farmsteads in Roman Britain, indicating ornamental planting. Box remains a very popular ornamental plant in gardens, being particularly valued for topiary and hedges because of its small leaves, evergreen nature, tolerance of close shearing, and scented foliage. The scent is not to everyone's liking: the herbalist John Gerard found it \\"evill and lothsome\\" and Daniel Defoe recounts that at Hampton Court Palace Queen Anne had the box hedging removed because she found its odour offensive.Defoe, A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain (1724), noted in Todd Longstaffe-Gowan and Vivian Russell, The Gardens and Parks at Hampton Court Palace (2005:87); the authors suggest that simplification of the Dutch designs to suit an English taste for plain lawn and gravel was the major motive (pp 84ff). In the American South, it has sometimes been called \\"rich man's hedge,\\"http://www.boxwoodsociety.org/uploads/22_2_1982_October.pdf and was often used to anchor the landscape plantings on either side of the front door of a house. The scent, most pungent on warm summer days, is not found disagreeable by all, despite its having been likened to cat urine. Several cultivars have been selected, including 'Argenteo-variegata' and 'Marginata' with variegated foliage; such \\"gilded box\\" received a first notice in John Parkinson's Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris (1629).Parkinson asserts in his Theatrum Botanicum (1640) that the \\"gilded\\" box \\"hath not been mentioned by any Writer before me\\": quoted in Alice M.

Uses Timber 19th-century English flute made of boxwood (detail) Slow growth of box renders the wood (\\"boxwood\\") very hard (possibly the hardest in Europe) and heavy, and free of grain produced by growth rings, making it ideal for cabinet-making, the crafting of flutes and oboes, engraving, marquetry, woodturning, tool handles, mallet heads and as a substitute for ivory. The British wood-engraver Thomas Bewick pioneered the use of boxwood blocks for wood-engraving.Pg.171, Lawrence, E., ed. (1985) The Illustrated Book of Trees & Shrubs. Gallery Books .

It contains steroidal alkaloids such as cyclobuxine. It also contains flavonoids. B. sempervirens wasn‚Äôt known for its medical use until the beginning of the 1600s.Garden, U.o.O.B. Buxus sempervirens-The Virtues. Available from: http://www.botanic-garden.ox.ac.uk/buxus- sempervirens.html . After this it was found that the leaves (containing alkaloids, oils and tannin), the bark (containing chlorophyll, wax, resin, lignin and minerals) and the oil from the wood had a medical effect.Sturluson, T. Health Benefits of Boxwood and Side Effects. 2015; Available from: http://www.herbal-supplement-resource.com/boxwood.html. It then was used to treat gout, urinary tract infections, intestinal worms, chronic skin problems, syphilis, hemorrhoids, epilepsy, headache and piles,Williamson, E.M., Potter‚Äôs Herbal Cyclopaedia. 2003, Essex: Saffron Walden. but also had the reputation of curing leprosy, rheumatism, HIV, fever and malaria.Barceloux, D.G., Medical Toxicology of Natural Substances: Foods, Fungi, Medicinal Herbs, Plants and Venomous Animals.

Istanbul University Publications, 1999. No: 3255. Also, the leaves from B. sempervirens were used as an auburn hair dye.Bown, D., The Royal Horticultural Society new encyclopedia of herbs and their uses. 2002, London :: Dorling Kindersley. The plant Buxus sempervirens has been well investigated chemically. During late 1980s, Dildar Ahmed while working on his PhD thesis under the supervision of Prof Atta-ur-Rahman, isolated a number of steroidal alkaloids from the leaves of the plant. A new system of nomenclature for buxus alkaloids was also proposed based on buxane nucleus. He also isolated a flavonoid glycoside, and named it galactobuxin based on the fact that it contains a galactose ring.

Karl Edward Zener (April 22, 1903 ‚Äì September 27, 1964) was a perceptual psychologist best known for his affiliation with Dr. J. B. Rhine and their work in the field of extra- sensory perception or ESP.Matt Jarvis, Julia Russell Key Ideas in Psychology 2002, p. 117 Biography Zener was born in Indianapolis, Indiana the son of Clarence and Ida Zener, and brother of Katharine (later Mrs Katharine Hurmiston) and Clarence (later Dr Clarence Zener). He received a Ph.B. from the University of Chicago in 1923, followed by M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in psychology from Harvard University in 1924 and 1926. He then went on to spend a year as a United States National Research Council Fellow at the University of Berlin before returning to the U.S. After a year of teaching psychology at Princeton University, Zener took up what was to be a lifelong post with Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina. The main thrust of Zener's work over the next ten years concerned conditioned responses, and during the 1930s he maintained one of the few Pavlovian conditioning laboratories in the U.S. It was also during this time that, along with colleague J.B. Rhine, he devised the card symbols that were used by Rhine in early ESP tests. Rhine called cards bearing these symbols \\"Zener cards\\" in honor of his colleague.Fred Nadis Wonder Shows: Performing Science, Magic, And Religion In America 2005, p. 158 Zener's later work focused on theories of perception and the analysis of perceptual experience. With research partner Dr. Mercedes Gaffron, he identified previously unknown aspects of visual processing and comprehension. The resultant Zener-Gaffron theory combined a psychological analysis of perception with then-contemporary findings from the field of biological neuroscience.Henryk Misiak, Virginia Staudt Sexton Phenomenological, existential, and humanistic psychologies: a historical survey Grune & Stratton, 1973, p. 58 Zener was the recipient of the only grant ever given for psychological research by the Ford Foundation Program in Humanities and the Arts. Zener was appointed Chairman of the Department of Psychology at Duke University in 1961, after having served there as the director of graduate studies in psychology for nearly twenty years. The Zener Auditorium (Room 130, Sociology-Psychology Building) of Duke University is named after him. Personal life Zener married Ann Adams and the couple had three sons: Dr. Karl A. Zener, Dr. Julian C. Zener, and Wilfred Zener. Wilfred, however, died in a tragic drowning accident in 1956.

It was discovered on 3 October 1986, by Danish astronomer Poul Jensen at the Brorfelde Observatory in Denmark and named after the German city of Celle. The V-type asteroid has a rotation period of 3.84 hours. The discovery of its 2.3-kilometer minor-planet moon was announced in 2003.  Orbit and classification  Celle is a core member of the Vesta family (), one of the largest families in main belt. Vestian asteroids have a composition akin to cumulate eucrites (HED meteorites) and are thought to have originated deep within 4 Vesta's crust, possibly from the Rheasilvia crater, a large impact crater on its southern hemisphere near the South pole, formed as a result of a subcatastrophic collision. Vesta is the main belt's second- largest and second-most-massive body after . Celle orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2‚Äì2.6 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,371 days; semi-major axis of 2.42 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 5¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observations as at Crimea‚ÄìNauchnij in April 1970, about 16 years prior to its official discovery observation at Brorfelde.  Physical characteristics  Celle is a bright V-type asteroid in the SMASS classification and according to the characterization made by the Pan-STARRS survey. This is also in line with the overall spectral type determined for Vestian asteroids.  Rotation period  Several rotational lightcurves of Celle have been obtained from photometric observations since 2001. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurves gave a rotation period of 3.84 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.11 and 0.17 magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Celle measures between 5.924 and 6.6 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.232 and 0.5033. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a high albedo of 0.4 and calculates a diameter of 6.35 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.6.  Satellite  Between September 2001, and February 2003, photometric observations of Celle were obtained with the 1.8-meter Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope on Mount Graham, Arizona, by American astronomers William Ryan at New Mexico Tech and NMHU in collaboration with Carlos Martinez and Lacey Stewart as part of a larger survey. The mutual occultation events revealed that Celle is an asynchronous binary asteroid with a minor-planet moon orbiting it every 36.57 hours (1.52 days) at an average distance of . The discovery was announced on 3 May 2003. The satellite measures approximately or 43% the size of its primary. A combined bulk density of was modeled for the likely basaltic bodies.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the German city of Celle on the occasion of its 700th anniversary. Celle is twinned with the Danish town of Holb√¶k, where the discovering Brorfelde Observatory is located. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 February 1992 ().

Eventually, the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, 1983 (IMDT Act) came into being following the Assam Accord signed between the Government of India and the All Assam Students Union (AASU) to end the decade-long anti-foreigner agitation. The IMDT Act is an instrument passed by Indian Parliament when there was no MP elected from Assam, to detect illegal immigrants (from Bangladesh) and expel them from Assam. While the IMDT Act operates only in Assam, the Foreigners Act (1946) applies to the rest of the country. It is applicable to those Bangladeshi nationals who settled in Assam on or after 25 March 1971. Under the Act, the onus of proving the citizenship of a suspected illegal alien rests on the complainant, often the police. On the other hand, according to the provisions of the Foreigners Act, the onus lies with the person suspected to be an alien. Sonowal took the issue of Bangladeshi infiltration to the Supreme Court. By its judgement dated 12 July 2005, the court struck down the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, 1983, as unconstitutional and termed Bangladeshi infiltration an \\"external aggression\\" and directed that \\"the Bangladesh nationals who have illegally crossed the border and have trespassed into Assam or are living in other parts of the country have no legal right of any kind to remain in India and they are liable to be deported.\\" See also *Sonowal Kacharis *All Assam Students Union *Asom Gana Parishad *Sarbananda Sonowal ministry (2016‚Äì) References External links * Home Page on the Parliament of India's Website  Category:People from Dibrugarh district Category:Living people Category:1961 births Category:Assamese people Category:Gauhati University alumni Category:Dibrugarh University alumni Category:14th Lok Sabha members Category:Asom Gana Parishad politicians Category:Bharatiya Janata Party politicians from Assam Category:Lok Sabha members from Assam Category:16th Lok Sabha members Category:Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports Category:Union ministers of state of India with independent charge Category:Assam MLAs 2001‚Äì2006 Category:Assam MLAs 2016‚Äì Category:Chief Ministers of Assam Category:Chief ministers from Bharatiya Janata Party Category:Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Category:Narendra Modi ministry ","title":"Sarbananda Sonowal"},{"id":"7149470","text":"The East Greenwich Township School District is a community public school district that serves students in pre-kindergarten through sixth grade from East Greenwich Township, in Gloucester County, New Jersey, United States, in two elementary schools.

Biography He was born the son of Sir Henry Frederick Thynne of Caus Castle, Shropshire, and Kempsford, Gloucestershire, and his wife, Mary, daughter of Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry of Aylesborough. He succeeded his father as 2nd baronet (1681) and married Frances, daughter of Heneage Finch, 3rd Earl of Winchilsea. He was descended from the first Sir John Thynne of Longleat House. He was educated at Kingston Grammar School and entered Christ Church, Oxford on 21 April 1657. He was invested as a Fellow of the Royal Society on 23 November 1664. He held the office of Envoy to Sweden between November 1666 and April 1669. He was returned as Member of Parliament (M.P.) for Oxford University between 1674 and 1679 and for Tamworth between 1679 and 1681. He succeeded to the title of 2nd Baronet Thynne, of Kempsford on 6 March 1679. He was High Steward of Tamworth from 1679 and also High Steward of the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield from 1679 until his death. He was created 1st Viscount Weymouth, on 11 December 1682, with a special remainder; if he lacked male heirs among his own descendants, the title would be inherited by his two brothers, James and Henry Frederick. He was created 1st Baron Thynne of Warminster on 11 December 1682. On 13 December 1688, Weymouth carried an invitation to William III, Prince of Orange at Henley-on-Thames, along with Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke, after the flight of King James II in the Glorious Revolution. He held the office of First Lord of Trade and Foreign Plantations between 30 May 1702 and April 1707. In this role, Weymouth is reputed to have introduced the Lord Weymouth Pine (Pinus strobus), in 1705. He planted it extensively on the estate at Longleat. The Lord Weymouth Pine was useful for ship masts, in that it grew tall and slender. Weymouth's reputation in connection to the pine is doubtful, since the name really derived from the explorer George Weymouth, totally unrelated, who first discovered this pine growing in colonial Maine. All Thomas Thynne did was to arrange for its importation, and prefix a \\"Lord\\" in front of the Weymouth in the tree's official appellation. He was invested as a Privy Counsellor (P.C.) on 18 June 1702. In May 1707, at the time of the formation of the new Kingdom of Great Britain, Weymouth was relieved of the role of Privy Counsellor, . In 1707, Thomas Thynne founded a grammar school for boys in the nearby market town of Warminster, with 23 free places for local boys. The first Master was Rev R. Barry. Over time this became known as the Lord Weymouth School. In 1973 this school merged with St Monica's Girls' School to become Warminster School which continues to this day. The 1st Viscount is remembered at Warminster School by the naming of a boarding house, later converted to classrooms, after him. A strong link remains between the school and his successors. He held the office of Warden of the Forest of Dean in 1712. He was re-invested as a Privy Counsellor (P.C.) on 8 March 1711. William Legge, 1st Earl of Dartmouth wrote that \\"Lord Weymouth was a weak , proud man, with a vast estate... He was very liberal to non-jurors, though he always took the oaths himself; which occasioned his house being constantly full of people of that sort, who cried him up for a very religious man; which pleased him extremely, having affected to be thought so all his life; which the companions of his youth would by no means allow.\\" Thomas had his bouts of ill health. In fact in 1667, when he was laid low with the gout, he was never expected to recover - though he did. And in any case he managed to outlive all his male relatives, both his own and the succeeding generation, leaving him sadly without any grandsons from male issue. Family legend has it that he was twice offered an earldom during his final years. Yet without there being any male heir from his own loins, and with the inheritance of Longleat required by family entail to pass through the male line of descent from Sir John Thynne, he didn't really feel there was much point in accumulating any additional honours. He was more inclined to suppose that the whole line would soon be extinct, or too distant in blood ties for him to trouble himself. He had four sons, including Henry Thynne (1675‚Äì1708), all of whom predeceased him. He has an extensive article in the Dictionary of National Biography. Longleat House and the Thynnes A View of Longleat, Jan Siberechts, 1675 Longleat was purchased by Sir John Thynn in 1541. He was the first of the Thynne 'dynasty' - the family name was Thynn or Thynne in the 16th century, later Thynne only, but the present head of the family reverted to the spelling Thynn in the 1980s. Sir John Thynne (1515‚Äì1580) purchased Longleat which was previously an Augustinian priory. He was a builder with experience gained from working on Syon House, Bedwyn Broil and Somerset House. In April 1567 the original house caught fire and burnt down. A replacement house was effectively completed by 1580. Adrian Gaunt, Alan Maynard, Robert Smythson, the Earl of Hertford and Humpfrey Lovell all contributed to the new building but most of the design was Sir John's work. Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth (1640‚Äì1714) started the house's large book collection. Formal gardens, canals, fountains and parterres were created by George London with sculptures by Arnold Quellin and Chevalier David. The Best Gallery, Long Gallery, Old Library and Chapel were all added due to Wren. What changed most of all, were the general surroundings to the house, for Thomas was impassioned by the idea of gardens, and inspired in particular by Versailles. He employed George London to lay out a vast complex of ornate terraced flower beds, with symmetrical paths and avenues, to furnish Longleat with a decorative environment, which stretched for the most part eastwards, across the leat (having diverted 'the long lete' with a canal), and on up into what is now the safari park. The whole family, when gathered, took much delight in the home-grown fruit to be harvested at Longleat. The house is still used as the private residence of the Thynn family. The Viscountcy of Weymouth has been held by the Marquesses of Bath since 18 Jun 1789. Alexander Thynn, 7th Marquess of Bath (1932-2020) was an artist and mural painter with a penchant for mazes and labyrinths (he created the hedge maze, the love labyrinth, the sun maze, the lunar labyrinth and King Arthur's maze on the property). Bishop Ken, lodger Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells, when deprived of his see by William and Mary in 1691 after he refused to transfer his oath of allegiance from James, on the grounds that once given, it could not be forsworn, was given lodgings at Longleat and an ¬£80 annuity by the 1st Viscount Weymouth, a friend since Oxford days. Taking up residence on the top floor at Longleat for a period of some twenty years, he exerted a profound influence upon Thomas, becoming what some might describe as his conscience. Thomas thus acquired a reputation for good deeds, which he himself regarded as spontaneous enough, but which the friends of his youth were inclined to regard as having been inspired by his devout friend, the Bishop. And as an example of such benevolence, somewhere between the two of them, they founded the Lord Weymouth School, now Warminster School. Notable too is the fact that a portion of the West Wing was transformed into a chapel for the household's daily worship. Not that its interior ever matched the architectural finery of equivalent chapels in other stately homes, but it was in any case evidence of the devout spirit which prevailed at Longleat over that particular historical period. While living in the house, Bishop Ken wrote many of his famous hymns, including 'Awake my soul‚Äô, and, when he died in 1711, bequeathed his extensive library to the 1st Viscount. Irish estates Thomas Tynne gained land in Northern Ireland following the division of land in 1692 which came out of an agreement between the heirs of the two daughters of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Earl Ferrers, the grandson of Lady Dorothy inherited her share, and Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth succeeded to the inheritance of Lady Frances Devereux, the Earl's elder daughter, later Marchioness of Hertford and Duchess of Somerset. This division was uneven, and in Lord Weymouth's favour. Lord Weymouth, however, behaved generously in order to rectify this injustice to Ferrers. In his \\"Longleat: the Story of an English Country House\\" (London, 1978), David Burnett records (somewhat improbably, but on the evidence of the Bath estate archive): '... In 1694 a Polish baron had written to Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth asking if he could lease and the Irish estate town of Carrickmacross in order to settle 200 Protestant families from Silesia. Thomas consented, but the agreement was cancelled when the baron announced his intention to demolish the town and rebuild it in the Polish style.\\" Thomas Tynne sent his Irish agent instructions for building the Viscount Weymouth Grammar School, Carrickmacross. \\"I intend the school house shall be slated and made a convenient house, which will draw scholars and benefit the town; therefore the timber must be oak.\\" But Thomas was an absentee landlord, and ten years elapsed before he discovered that his agent has embezzled the building fund and repaired an existing building. The school was eventually built, and its syllabus included \\"Oratory, Virtue, Surveying [and] Antiquities\\". The stern language of its ninth statute stated: \\"The master shall make diligent enquiry after such as shall break, cut or deface or anywise abuse the desks, forms, walls or windows of this school, and shall always inflict open punishment on all such offenders\\". Unlike Warminster School this school closed in 1955. The 1st Viscount Weymouth died in 1714, without surviving male issue, and bequeathed his estates to his grand-nephew, also named Thomas Thynne, and ancestor of the Marquesses of Bath. Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers died in 1717, his estate, by agreement, devolving in equal parts to his four sons: Robert, George, Sewallis and John Shirley. Of these, only George survived and, as the others had died without issue, the whole estate passed to him. He was the grandfather of the Shirley brothers, Horatio Henry and Evelyn Philip, the 19th-century owners of the western moiety of Farney. The Shirleys were absentees, spending most of their time at Ettington in Warwickshire. In c.1750, they built a house near Carrickmacross for their occasional visits. It was not until 1826 that Robert's grandson, Evelyn John Shirley, laid the foundations of a mansion worthy of the family and estate near the banks of Lough Fea. Family Thynne married before 1672 Frances Finch, daughter of Heneage Finch, 3rd Earl of Winchilsea, and they had: * Henry * Thomas * Frances, married Sir Robert Worsley, 4th Baronet However, none of the children outlived their parents.

Invasion Kalayavana Surrounds Mathura Page from a Dispersed Bhagavata Purana Series - Brooklyn Museum According to the Vishnu Purana and Harivamsa, KƒÅlayavana was a Yavana king. This legend appears to indicate a Greek invasion from across the Himalayas. The legend goes like this: JarƒÅsandha, Kansa's father-in-law, and the ruler of Magadha attacks MathurƒÅ seventeen times but is beaten by Krishna every time. Jarasandha unable to defeat Krishna on his own made an alliance with KƒÅlayavana. KƒÅlayavana was a powerful Yavana warrior who had got a boon from Lord Shiva that on the battlefield he will be undefeated . Sri Krishna, thinking that by a struggle with two foes at once the people would be exhausted, built a new strong and glorious city, named 'DwƒÅrkƒÅ', to which he conducted the inhabitants of MathurƒÅ. KƒÅlayavana attacked MathurƒÅ with an army of 3 million greeks/yavanas. KƒÅlayavana realizing that the yavanas have greatly outnumbered all the yƒÅdavas, decided to challenge Sri Krishna for a duel. Sri Krishna strategically fled the battlefield. Shri Krishna lured Kalayavana into the cave where the great king of Treta yuga, Muchukunda, one of the forefathers of Lord Shri RƒÅma was in a deep slumber of thousands of years after helping devas in an epic war with asuras. Contemplating an absolutely undisturbed sleep he was given a boon by Lord Indra that anyone who dared to disturb his sleep would get burnt to ashes immediately. Fast forward to DwƒÅpara yuga, in the darkness deep inside the cave, Sri Krishna covered Muchukunda with his shawl. KƒÅlayavan assuming him to be Krishna kicked him, thus disturbing his sleep and burning into ashes. And then Muchukunda was delighted to see Lord Shri Krishna there. Sri Krishna advises him to perform TapasyƒÅ to cleanse the accumulated sins to attain Moksha (liberation). After meeting with lord, Muchukunda sets out of the cave. Muchukunda then goes north to GandamƒÅdana Mountain and from there to BadrikƒÅshrama for doing penance and finally achieves liberation, the Moksha. The hills and the cave where Muchukunda rested is located to Mount Girnar in the state of Gujarat. After knowing the fate of their king the Yavana armies fled to Yavana kingdom, thus Krishna saved Dwarka from mass-destruction. This leela yielded name of Ranchod to Lord Krishna.

Windsor Railway Bridge is a wrought iron 'bow and string' bridge in Windsor, Berkshire, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. It carries the ex-GWR branch line from Slough to Windsor into Windsor and Eton Central station. It crosses the River Thames on the reach between Romney Lock and Boveney Lock. Structure The bridge is a single-span structure comprising three bowstring trusses which created two bays for the original two GWR tracks.Humber, William (1870). A Complete Treatise on Cast and Wrought Iron Bridge Construction; Description of Windsor Bridge (1849), pp. 245-246. Lockwood & Co., London. Retrieved 2012-07-03. The bridge is the World's oldest wrought iron railway bridge still in regular service,Isambard Kingdom Brunel and is a forerunner of Brunel's final masterpiece, the Royal Albert Bridge, Saltash. The bridge was Grade II* listed in 1975. Opening The line opened in 1849. The construction of the line was delayed and could not be included in the original Parliamentary Act because of objections from the Provost of Eton College. The brick viaduct was constructed between 1861‚Äì65 to replace the original wooden trestle viaduct. The bridge contractor was Mr George Hannet. Track layout Although the bridge was built to take two tracks, the track on the upstream side was removed when the line was rationalised in the 1960s. The trackbed on this side now carries a sewage or water main pipe.

Provisional anti-Bolshevik local governments were formed in many parts of Siberia and other eastern regions during that summer. The Red Army mounted a counter-offensive in the autumn, and in 1919 defeated the White commander Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia. Smaller-scale conflicts in the region went on until 1923. Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion In May 1918, soldiers of the Czechoslovak Legion revolted against the Bolsheviks in Chelyabinsk. The revolt was triggered by Trotsky's order to local Bolshevik commanders to disarm the Czechs (in violation of previous agreements) following a confrontation between the Czechs travelling Eastwards and a train full of Austro-Hungarian former POW's travelling Westwards. The dispute arising because the Czechs had been fighting against the Austro-Hungarians within whose Empire the Czech lands were, tensions were exacerbated because several Czech regiments of the Austro- Hungarian army had gone over to the Russians in the early years of World War I and these former Austro-Hungarian regiments formed the core of the Czech Legion. The Legion was trying to evacuate to the Western Front to continue the fight against the Central powers, but after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March, the Bolsheviks no longer supported this move.Bullock 2008, p. 44-46. The revolt quickly spread across Siberia, because the Czechoslovaks used the Trans-Siberian Railway to move their troops east quickly and because they were supported by local uprisings instigated by Russian army officers. When the uprising reached Yekaterinburg, the former Tsar and his family who were being held there by the Bolsheviks were executed to prevent their release by the Whites. By the end of August, Vladivostok was in Czechoslovak hands.Bullock 2008, p. 46. Provisional White governments In the power vacuum left by the departure of the Bolsheviks multiple White Movement governments were established, most importantly KOMUCH at Samara and the Provisional Siberian Government. KOMUCH quickly ordered a general mobilisation, but its troops were small and badly trained. The Czechoslovaks allied with KOMUCH and advanced to the west, taking Kazan, where they captured the tsar's gold reserves which had been moved east for safekeeping.Bullock 2008, p. 46-48.

It was originally composed of a machete wrapped in towels on both ends with a portion of the blade exposed in the middle. Tribal performers of fire knife dancing (or Siva Afi or even \\"Ailao Afi\\" as it is called in Samoa) dance while twirling the knife and doing other acrobatic stunts. The towels are set afire during the dances, hence the name.  History  Polynesian historians and authorities on Samoan cultural history state that the training of Toa warriors in the art of hand to hand combat with the Nifo Oti, the serrated-edged Samoan war club, came into prominence between 900 - 1200 AD. It was the favorite weapon of the Tui Manu'a Empire in the time of King Maui Tagote of the Eastern Samoan Island groups. These war clubs were often edged with the teeth of sharks, saw fish, swordfish, and other sea creatures. The Siva Afi was originally performed with the Nifo Oti, which was very dangerous. The modern fire knife dance has its roots in the ancient Samoan exhibition called ailao ‚Äì the flashy demonstration of a Samoan warrior's battle prowess through artful twirling, throwing and catching, and dancing with a war club. The ailao could be performed with any warclub, and some colonial accounts confirm that women also performed ailao at the head of ceremonial processions, especially daughters of high chiefs. It was conceived on the Island of Upolu between the years 1200 - 1250 AD, coming into cultural prominence during the reign of King Maui Tagote. Ancient legend speaks of 400 warriors who trained with their Nifo Oti. During night dances, torches were often twirled and swung about by dancers, although a warclub was the usual implement used for ailao in remembrance of the three brothers Tuna, Fata, and Savea and their defeat of the Tongan invaders. Before the introduction of metals, the most common clubs that were wielded and displayed in the ailao fashion were elaborately carved heirloom clubs called anava. These anava were frequently carved with serrated edges and jagged \\"teeth\\" which characterized the unique Samoan weapon called the \\"nifo'oti\\".  The Expulsion of The Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki (King of Tonga) & The Birth of Malietoa (King of Samoa), The Birth of Siva Afi.  For approximately 200 years, the Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki established a long-term residence in ata Safotu, Savai'i, Samoa. The location for the Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki's upcoming birthday festivities was a beautiful famous stretch of beach in Aleipata, a region on the Eastern side of Upolu. The seeds of rebellion were planted, according to legend, by three brothers‚Äîthe \\"sons\\" of Atiogie, namely Savea, Tuna, Fata‚Äîand a fourth Toa warrior, Ulumasui (who was actually a grandson of Atiogie). The three brothers and their nephew eventually lead a wide-scale campaign of civil disobedience, which ultimately escalated into the military overthrow of Talakaifaiki. Samoan warriors were called upon to dance and entertain the Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki during a birthday celebration for the King of Tonga. The Tongans had ruled parts of Samoa (Upolu and Savai'i) but were not able to conquer the Eastern Samoan Islands, namely Manu'a and Manono, whose warriors famously held off Tongan and Fijian invasions on numerous occasions. The Manu'a warriors were renowned throughout Eastern Polynesia for their strength and ferocity. The Samoan warriors arrived to prepare their entertainment for Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki. The Samoans buried weapons (nifo oti) in the sand all around the beach area as they plied the Tongans with \\"bush gin\\". Then, they utilized their nifo oti, which have remained the same design for the last millennia as those favored when the Samoans were actually head hunters, to behead the victim, while the hook carried the trophy. As night set in, the Festivities and party progressed, more \\"bush gin\\" was consumed, and the Samoan warriors \\"performed\\" for the king. They had wrapped both ends of their nifo-oti with dry palm sennit, which was then dipped into the fires to create a blaze on one end of the knife. They danced and pointed out the locations of the buried weapons to other Samoan warriors, who were waiting in small paopaos (canoes) offshore. The warriors then stormed the beach, recovered the weapons and set them ablaze as they proceeded to drive the Tongans in a bloody battle all the way across the island, from east to the westernmost point of Upolu. Driven westward from Aleipata, Upolu (where the Tu'i Tonga's birthday festivities were underway) to the coast of Mulifanua, the Tongan king and his bodyguards were cornered against the sea. There was fierce fighting all the way to the sea, whereon the Tu'i Tonga reached his superior navy vessels and called out to those on the land. The Tongans who were not killed eventually boarded boats and left Samoa for good. Upon his departure, the Tongan monarch delivered a short speech that praised the brave fighting qualities of the Samoan warriors and conceded victory to his once-subjects. The Malietoa title is taken from the opening phrase of that speech: \\"MƒÅlie toa, mƒÅlie tau,\\" meaning \\"great warriors, well fought.\\"  Etymology  When European and American whalers and traders began commercial ventures in Samoa, they introduced the natives to the long-handled blubber knife and the hooked cane knife. The characteristic metal hook of these tools was readily incorporated into the Samoan wooden nifo'oti, which bears the unique hooked element whether carved from wood or forged from steel. One common claim is that the word \\"nifo'oti\\" means \\"tooth of death\\", but this is not linguistically accurate as Samoan syntax places the modifier after the subject; according to Samoan grammar, the term \\"nifo'oti\\" would actually mean \\"dead tooth\\", hardly as intimidating as the former translation. One more linguistic issue remains to be worked out in regards to 'oti (with the initial glottal stop) and \\"oti\\" (without the glottal stop). When pronounced with the glottal stop, the word 'oti does not mean \\"death\\" at all; as a verb, 'oti means \\"to cut\\" as in 'otiulu (\\"hair cut\\"), or, as a noun, it refers to the domestic goat. Therefore, the most probable derivation of the term \\"nifo'oti\\" stems from the resemblance of the weapon's hook to the curved horn (\\"nifo\\") of a goat (\\"'oti\\"), or from the serrated teeth (\\"nifo\\") that formed the weapon's cutting edge ('oti).  Revival  The young man Tavita Vaoifi revived the Samoan ailao Siva Afi dance to eventually bring it home to Samoa from Hawai'i. He had won a scholarship from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. This was while WWII was being fought in part in his beloved South Pacific. When he was able to come to America, he went to school, worked, and danced. After he read this information, in his spare time, he researched anything that he could find about his homeland. This story struck him deeply, because he had never heard of this from his elders. He was determined to incorporate this treasure into his island dance routine. After many cuts, burns, and narrow escapes, he was able to perfect this dance, to the point where he performed it nightly at clubs and shows throughout not only the San Francisco area but the entire country. Fire was a part of Tavita's dance as he found it just as it was described in the book from the library. There were no towels used, only palm fronds and dry leaves. The crowd in America, which came to find out what he had discovered about Samoa, were frightened when they saw him whirling the fire. The Superintendent of the Mormon school where Tavita was teaching at the time was able to calm the audience and assure them that no harm would come to them. He eventually returned to Samoa to bring back this part of the Samoan Culture that was unheard of until he preformed. After that, for years he taught the dance and judged many contests in Samoa and other countries. He was rewarded for the notices and tourists he encouraged to visit his beloved homeland with the High Chief Title, A'e, from the head of state Malietoa Tanumafili II. Mrs. Tavita Vaoifi wrote, after being married to him for 12 years, from 1979 until his death in 1991 from Cyclone Val, the information about fire not being a part of the \\"Fireknife Dance\\" until 1946 is a mistake. That is added to the knife Tin 1946 by a Samoan knife dancer named Freddie Letuli, later to become Paramount Chief Letuli Olo Misilagi. Letuli was performing in San Francisco and noticed a Hindu Fire eater and a little girl with lighted batons. The fire eater loaned him some fuel, he wrapped some towels around his knife, and thus the Fire Knife Siva Afi Dance was revived. Although today many commercial performers perform the dance with short staffs or knives without blade, this is not authentic fire knife dance and is unacceptable in Samoan cultural practices except for training purposes. The knives used by performers in American Samoa are still made of machetes, although they are often dulled for younger dancers.  Competition  Traditional competitions were hotly contested. Their exhibitionists would almost rather die than seek medical care for injuries incurred while performing. Today, modern competitions are held annually at the Polynesian Cultural Center to name the World Fireknife Champion. The competition began in 1992 and is always held during the third week of May. In 2007, the championships were expanded to welcome competitors in a duet category and a women's category. In 2010, the event expanded to four nights including a two- night, three-person final competition. Champions by year are: * 2017: Falaniko Penesa (Samoa) * 2016: Mikaele Oloa (Waialua, Hawaii) * 2015: Joseph Cadousteau (Papeete, Tahiti) * 2014: Viavia Tiumalu, Jr. (Orlando,Florida) * 2013: Joseph Cadousteau (Papeete, Tahiti) * 2012: Joseph Cadousteau (Papeete, Tahiti) * 2011: Viavia Tiumalu, Jr. (Orlando, Florida) * 2010: Mikaele Oloa (Waialua, Hawaii) * 2009: Mikaele Oloa (Waialua, Hawaii) * 2008: Viavia Tiumalu, Jr. (Orlando, Florida) * 2007: Andrew \\"Umi\\" Sexton (Orlando, Florida) * 2006: Mikaele Oloa (Orlando, Florida) * 2005: Mikaele Oloa (Orlando, Florida) * 2004: Alex Galeai (Laie, Hawaii) * 2003: David Galeai (Cook Islands) * 2002: Pati Levasa (Samoa) * 2001: Pati Levasa (Samoa) * 2000: David Galeai (Cook Islands) * 1999: David Galeai (Cook Islands) * 1998: Pati Levasa (Samoa) * 1997: Pati Levasa (Samoa) * 1996: Ifi Soo (Maui, Hawaii) * 1995: Ifi Soo (Maui, Hawaii) * 1994: Ifi Soo (Maui, Hawaii) * 1993: Tauasa Sielu Avea (Laie, Hawaii)  Modern use  The Samoan Siva Afi has become an integral part of any Polynesian Luau or show. Many other Polynesian Islands have implemented the Siva Afi into their own Island shows especially in the Islands of Tahiti, Hawai'i, Cook Islands Fiji and Tonga. Because of the close familial tribal ties with the aforementioned Islands and the Samoa Islands, the fire knife dance has almost become homogenized as part of those Islands' own culture. In the mid 20th century, the ancient traditions were commercialized and westernized. Over time, the performing implement has changed. The wooden handle gradually lengthened and the blade got shorter. Eventually, the exposed portion was part of the handle. Some of the moves performed in shows now are more modern and flashy than traditional battle preparations. As such, they are often performed at accelerated speeds. It is probable that the danger of sharpened blades and the demand for multiple daily shows by top performers has caused the sharpened blade to disappear entirely from commercial performances. Now, when one travels to Hawaii, it is quite common to see commercial 'Fire Knife Dancing' performed with wooden or aluminum poles wrapped in towels. These performances are often part of Luau festivities or Polynesian shows that include Poi Ball performances.

Balaz was 23 years old when he broke into the big leagues on September 10, 1974, with the California Angels. Career California Angels On June 4, 1970 Balaz was drafted by the California Angels in the 5th round of the 1970 amateur baseball draft. An outstanding minor league hitter who led three leagues in runs batted in, Balaz made his major league debut in an unusual way on September 10, 1974 at Anaheim Stadium. In a game against the Kansas City Royals, he was announced as a pinch hitter for left fielder Bruce Bochte in the bottom of the 6th. Kansas City made a pitching change, so manager Dick Williams decided to have Rudy Meoli pinch hit for Balaz, who had to go back and take a seat on the dugout bench. He got into a game three days later, starting in left field against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park, and went 0-for-3 against Jim Kaat. On September 24 he had a big game against the Royals in Kansas City, with a home run and four RBI. Balaz spent more time with the Angels in 1975, hitting .242 (29-for-120) in 45 games with 1 HR and 10 RBI. He was in the starting lineup for 30 of those games as a left fielder, right fielder, and designated hitter. Career totals include 59 games played, a .241 batting average (39-for-162), 2 home runs, 15 RBI, 14 runs scored, and a .340 slugging percentage. Balaz began to play in 1974, and appeared in 14 games that season, in which he had 42 at bats, scored four times, had 10 hits (nine singles and one home run), drove in 5 runs, walked twice, struck out 10 times, had one sacrifice hit, and was hit by pitch once. He finished with a .238 batting average, .289 on-base percentage and .310 slugging percentage. Boston Red Sox On March 3, 1976, during spring training, the Angels traded Balaz, Dick Sharon, and Dave Machemer to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for reliever Dick Drago. Balaz was sent down to the minor leagues, and never played for the Red Sox. It was reported that Drago was sent to the Angels as the player to be named later for Denny Doyle (acquired the previous June). The Red Sox still sent minor league pitcher Chuck Ross to the Angels two days later to make everything look more legitimate. Post major league career Balaz never again appeared in a big league game. After playing for the Rhode Island Red Sox in 1976, he split the 1977 season between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres minor league organizations. He continued his career in Mexico while playing for the Indios de Ciudad Ju√°rez club. Balaz gained prominence when he played in the 1979 Mexican League playoffs where his team made it to the finals.http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:LMVDazKu7bIJ:www2.leonesdeyucatan.com.mx/noticias.php%3Fid%3D558%26PHPSESSID%3Da126906e75fba796e478fa2899ec593c+%22john+balaz%22+mexico&hl;=en‚â∑=us&ct;=clnk&cd;=4&client;=firefox-a Balaz now lives in San Diego, California with his wife Bonnie and their children Lauren and Justin.

Achievements Balaz led in several leagues throughout his career. He topped the Pioneer League with 14 HR and 51 RBI while playing for the Idaho Falls Angels in 1971. He then led the California League with 28 HR and 113 RBI while playing for the Salinas Angels in 1973, and led the Texas League with 111 RBI while playing for the El Paso Diablos in 1974.

In 1651, he was elected to the English Council of State, where he played a part in foreign policy. Later, he was in opposition to Oliver Cromwell, against whom he wrote some political pamphlets. Life Neville was born in 1620, the second son of Sir Henry Neville (died 1629) of Billingbear House at Waltham St Lawrence in Berkshire, being younger brother of the Royalist commander, Richard Neville. His grandfather, Sir Henry Neville, had served as Ambassador to France. He was educated at Merton and University Colleges at Oxford, but left without graduating. At an early age, he married Elizabeth, the daughter and heiress of Richard Staverton of Heathley Hall in Warfield which became the couple's country estate. His wife apparently died young.Nicholas von Maltzahn, Neville, Henry (1620‚Äì1694). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 -- accessed 1 Dec 2014 Political activities Henry spent some of the period of the English Civil War travelling on the European continent, returning to England in 1645. In 1647, he anonymously published a satire The Parliament of Ladies. This was a parody of some prominent women associated with the parliamentary side. It was seen as a \\"libertine parody of the parliamentary publications common at the time.\\"Nicholas von Maltzahn, Neville, Henry (1620‚Äì1694). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 -- accessed 1 Dec 2014 The book was popular and was soon reprinted with various additions. In April 1649 he was elected to Parliament to fill a vacancy as MP for Abingdon. By the end of 1651 he was a member of the Council of State, but found himself so hostile to Cromwell that he temporarily retired from active politics. After Cromwell's death, he returned to Parliament on 30 December 1658, representing Reading. Starting in the 1650s, he developed a close relationship with the philosopher James Harrington, having become a member of his republican group. Their friendship was so close that Thomas Hobbes suspected Neville's hand in Oceana.Nicholas von Maltzahn, Neville, Henry (1620‚Äì1694). Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 -- accessed 1 Dec 2014 On 19 May 1659, he was given position on the new Council of State. After the Restoration, he was arrested for treasonable practices in October 1663; he was suspected of involvement in the \\"Yorkshire rising\\", also known as the Farnley Wood Plot, and held in the Tower of London (his grandfather was there before him). In May 1664, he was released without punishment, not being regarded as dangerous. Works Following his 1663 arrest Neville spent the rest of his life in writing and scholarship. His pamphlet The Parliament of Ladies (1647) created a lot of controversy; both answers to it and the imitations were published. Soon, there appeared, again anonymously, The Ladies, a Second Time, Assembled in Parliament (1647) which may also be Neville's work. Three years later, another similar publication appeared, Newes from the New Exchange, or, The Common-Wealth of Ladies (1650); it was published in two editions and also elicited some responses. In 1656, there appeared two broadsides: *Nevill versus Strood: the State of the Case. *A true and perfect relation of the manner and proceeding, held by the sheriffe for the county of Berk: at Redding, upon the 20th. of Aug. last 1656. They represented his resistance to Cromwell. Another such tract was Shuffling, Cutting and Dealing in a Game at Picquet. (1659) In 1668 he published another satirical take on gender and politics, The Isle of Pines. In 1680 he published Plato Redivivus, a political dialogue arguing that the growing number of property owners in England necessitated a wider distribution of political power.

He represented the Bettiah constituency of Bihar and was a member of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) political party. Born in Village Amba Ojha Tola, in Sheohar (then Sitamarhi in British India) He started his career by becoming the Mukhiya of his home panchayat in the year 1967. Thereafter, in 1967 he became Chairman of Zila Parishad. He started his legislative career in 1972 when he was elected as a MLA on Congress Ticket. He was elected from Sheohar for a record six consecutive terms till 1998. He was twice elected as a Member of Parliament from Gopalganj and Bettiah respectively. Shri jha is regarded as one of the most successful politicians of Bihar. His political intelligence can be understood in this way that in 1994 due to his extreme efforts his hometown, Sheohar which was a block then was converted into a district which was next to impossible as it was a very small town. A shrewd politician, and the Brahmin face of the RJD in the Lok Sabha, he entered active politics in 1960s as a Socialist before switching over to the Indian National Congress, the Janata Party, RJD, Janata Dal (United) and finally rejoining Lalu Prasad's party. An ardent follower of former prime minister Chandra Shekhar, the 73-year-old Jha remained a member of Socialist Party till 1972 before switching over to the Congress and successfully contesting the assembly elections from Sheohar. He represented the constituency in 1972, 1977 and 1980 on the Congress ticket and became a minister in the erstwhile Jagannath Mishra ministry in Bihar. As he paraded in favour of Mishra before the Raj Bhavan in 1985 in support of the latter's candidature for the post of chief minister and ouster of the then chief minister Bhagwat Jha Azad, Jha was denied re-nomination from Sheohar for \\"disobeying\\" the Congress leadership. Jha then resigned from the Congress' primary membership and secured a Janata Party ticket when Shekhar was its president. Rajiv Gandhi came to campaign against Jha in Sheohar but the latter won the elections to the Sheohar assembly seat for the fourth time in a row. After merger of former prime minister V P Singh's Jan Morcha, Janata Party and Lok Dal of former deputy prime minister Devi Lal in Bangalore in 1988, Jha was made the state president of Janata Dal in Bihar. But his relations with Singh were not going well and he was removed from the post within three months. A few months after his removal, Jha was made chairman of the party's parliamentary board in Bihar following Shekhar's intervention. In the late 1980s, some of the remnants of Janata Party had come together to form Janata Dal, which formed a coalition government at the national level following the 1989 Indian general election. In 1990 Bihar Legislative Assembly election, Janata Dal won the largest number of seats and sought to form government with the outside support of BJP and Communists. Jha was a contender for Chief Ministership pitted against Ram Sundar Das and Lalu Prasad Yadav. Yadav was supported by Devi Lal and Nitish Kumar, Jha by Chandra Shekhar and Das by Prime Minister VP Singh. Yadav had compaigned heavily in favour of implementing Mandal Commission, which sought to reserve government jobs for backward castes in Central Government jobs. Das was less keen on this. Nitish Kumar rallied backward caste MLAs towards Yadav. In the election, Yadav won narrowly over Das by a vote of 59 to 56. Jha won 12, mostly upper caste MLAs. On 3 September 2015, Jha left the RJD joined the Samajwadi Party, becoming the latter's first MLA in Bihar.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Senior- leader-Raghunath-Jha-quits-RJD-to-join-SP/articleshow/48789621.cms He also accused Prasad of ignoring senior leaders in a bid to promote his family members in the party.

He served as General Secretary to the General Workers Union, the largest trade union in Malta; as well as being the Ambassador for Malta in Belgium and the Ambassador Extraordinary in Norway. He was also the editor of It-Torƒãa, a newspaper issued by the union, from 1958 to 1967. He travelled abroad on international assignments by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions from 1959. Born on 25 July 1925, Attard Kingswell was a delegate for the workers at International Labour Conferences since 1955. He had acted as industrial adviser to the Government of Malta and to the Malta Labour Party in Malta and in London and was a member of several government boards and committees. He was a member of the Duke of Edinburgh Commonwealth Conference in Canada in 1960. Attard Kingswell was a member of the Anglo-Maltese Joint Mission in 1967 and member of the Steering Committee. In 1968 Attard Kingswell was chosen by the Confederation of Civic Councils (Malta) and awarded a Silver Medal of Merit on behalf of the Maltese Nation. The Medal of Merit was awarded to those who had shown special merit or had given exception service to Malta. In 1992 Attard Kingswell was made Member of the National Order of Merit which carries the denomination of UOM. During the turbulent 1960s and 1970s, and due to political machinations, Attard Kingswell had been removed from the General Workers Union on the pretext that he had helped the government of the day finalize a deal with the British government regarding the redundancies and compensation of workers employed with the UK Services on the rundown of the military bases in Malta. Another clash had been his opposition to the unification of the union with the Malta Labour Party, as Attard Kingswell felt that such a union was not in the interest of the workers. Between 1987 and 1996 he served as advisor to Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami, with special responsibilities for Malta Drydocks and Marsa Shipbuilding. Attard Kingswell died on 21 January 2002 at the age of 77 years.

At time of the merger Smedvig operated two semi submersibles, one drillship and one jack up rig in the Norwegian and British sector of the North Sea. A fleet of seven tender rigs were operated in South East Asia from the Singaporean subsidiary Smedvig Asia. As part of the merger, Smedvig's staff was transferred to Seadrill with Smedvig senior personnel assuming key positions in Seadrill (CEO, CFO etc.). Smedvig was delisted from the OSE and NYSE, while Seadrill is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. History Smedvig started in 1915 as the shipping company Peder Smedvig Shipping Company by Peder Smedvig. Between 1917 and 1959 Smedvig was also in the canning industry. In the 1960s the company entered the oil age with investments in supply ships, oil tankers and in 1973 the first drilling rig. The company acquired multiple rigs throughout the 1970s and 1980s and in 1988 it bought the competitor Dyvi Offshore. In 1989 the company was reorganised as a holding company for the Smedvig family's drilling operations and in 1990 the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Between 1991 and 1998 the company was also engaged in floating oil production. In January 2006, Seadrill won a bidding war against U.S. drilling rig company Noble Corporation, and subsequently acquired Smedvig ASA for an equity value of NOK 15 bn (USD 2.4 bn).

They include the finite dihedral groups, the infinite dihedral group, and the orthogonal group O(2). Definition For any abelian group H, the generalized dihedral group of H, written Dih(H), is the semidirect product of H and Z2, with Z2 acting on H by inverting elements. I.e., \\\\mathrm{Dih}(H) = H \\\\rtimes_\\\\phi Z_2 with œÜ(0) the identity and œÜ(1) inversion. Thus we get: :(h1, 0) * (h2, t2) = (h1 \\\\+ h2, t2) :(h1, 1) * (h2, t2) = (h1 ‚àí h2, 1 + t2) for all h1, h2 in H and t2 in Z2. (Writing Z2 multiplicatively, we have (h1, t1) * (h2, t2) = (h1 \\\\+ t1h2, t1t2) .) Note that (h, 0) * (0,1) = (h,1), i.e. first the inversion and then the operation in H. Also (0, 1) * (h, t) = (‚àíh, 1 + t); indeed (0,1) inverts h, and toggles t between \\"normal\\" (0) and \\"inverted\\" (1) (this combined operation is its own inverse). The subgroup of Dih(H) of elements (h, 0) is a normal subgroup of index 2, isomorphic to H, while the elements (h, 1) are all their own inverse. The conjugacy classes are: *the sets {(h,0 ), (‚àíh,0 )} *the sets {(h + k + k, 1) k in H } Thus for every subgroup M of H, the corresponding set of elements (m,0) is also a normal subgroup. We have: ::Dih(H) / M = Dih ( H / M ) Examples *Dihn = Dih(Zn) (the dihedral groups) **For even n there are two sets {(h + k + k, 1) k in H }, and each generates a normal subgroup of type Dihn / 2. As subgroups of the isometry group of the set of vertices of a regular n-gon they are different: the reflections in one subgroup all have two fixed points, while none in the other subgroup has (the rotations of both are the same). However, they are isomorphic as abstract groups. **For odd n there is only one set {(h + k + k, 1) k in H } *Dih‚àû = Dih(Z) (the infinite dihedral group); there are two sets {(h + k + k, 1) k in H }, and each generates a normal subgroup of type Dih‚àû. As subgroups of the isometry group of Z they are different: the reflections in one subgroup all have a fixed point, the mirrors are at the integers, while none in the other subgroup has, the mirrors are in between (the translations of both are the same: by even numbers). However, they are isomorphic as abstract groups. *Dih(S1), or orthogonal group O(2,R), or O(2): the isometry group of a circle, or equivalently, the group of isometries in 2D that keep the origin fixed. The rotations form the circle group S1, or equivalently SO(2,R), also written SO(2), and R/Z ; it is also the multiplicative group of complex numbers of absolute value 1. In the latter case one of the reflections (generating the others) is complex conjugation. There are no proper normal subgroups with reflections. The discrete normal subgroups are cyclic groups of order n for all positive integers n. The quotient groups are isomorphic with the same group Dih(S1). *Dih(Rn ): the group of isometries of Rn consisting of all translations and inversion in all points; for n = 1 this is the Euclidean group E(1); for n > 1 the group Dih(Rn ) is a proper subgroup of E(n ), i.e. it does not contain all isometries. *H can be any subgroup of Rn, e.g. a discrete subgroup; in that case, if it extends in n directions it is a lattice. **Discrete subgroups of Dih(R2 ) which contain translations in one direction are of frieze group type \\\\infty\\\\infty and 22\\\\infty. **Discrete subgroups of Dih(R2 ) which contain translations in two directions are of wallpaper group type p1 and p2. **Discrete subgroups of Dih(R3 ) which contain translations in three directions are space groups of the triclinic crystal system. Properties Dih(H) is Abelian, with the semidirect product a direct product, if and only if all elements of H are their own inverse, i.e., an elementary abelian 2-group: *Dih(Z1) = Dih1 = Z2 *Dih(Z2) = Dih2 = Z2 √ó Z2 (Klein four-group) *Dih(Dih2) = Dih2 √ó Z2 = Z2 √ó Z2 √ó Z2 etc. Topology Dih(Rn ) and its dihedral subgroups are disconnected topological groups. Dih(Rn ) consists of two connected components: the identity component isomorphic to Rn, and the component with the reflections. Similarly O(2) consists of two connected components: the identity component isomorphic to the circle group, and the component with the reflections. For the group Dih‚àû we can distinguish two cases: *Dih‚àû as the isometry group of Z *Dih‚àû as a 2-dimensional isometry group generated by a rotation by an irrational number of turns, and a reflection Both topological groups are totally disconnected, but in the first case the (singleton) components are open, while in the second case they are not. Also, the first topological group is a closed subgroup of Dih(R) but the second is not a closed subgroup of O(2).

Hard inheritance states that characteristics of an organism's offspring (passed on through DNA) will not be affected by the actions that the parental organism performs during its lifetime. For example: a medieval blacksmith who uses only his right arm to forge steel will not sire a son with a stronger right arm than left because the blacksmith's actions do not alter his genetic code.

The museum is one of three operated by Maidstone Borough Council. The building is Grade II* listed.  Overview  Maidstone Museum and Art Gallery In 1855 Thomas Charles, a local doctor and antiquarian, left his collections of art and antiquities to Maidstone Borough Council, requesting that his executors, ‚Äúmake such arrangements as they should think fit for the permanent preservation thereof in the town of Maidstone, and the same to be called the Charles Museum.‚Äù The Council subsequently acquired Charles‚Äô house, Chillington Manor,For a history of the old manor see: Ditchfield, P. H. & Clinch, G. Memorials of old Kent (Bemrose & Sons, 1907), pp 253-263. from his executors and, in 1858, opened it as the Charles Museum, later renamed Maidstone Museum. The Museum was one of the first to be opened as a result of the Museums Act (1845) and was a founder member of the Museums Association (1909).  Building  Original entrance in 2009 (since replaced by a newly built entrance lobby) The Museum's central core consists of an Elizabethan manor house, formerly known as Chillington Manor, completed in 1577 with earlier Tudor buildings to its rear. In the early 18th century a substantial wing was added to the west of the Tudor house. Upon the death of Thomas Charles an in accordance with his estate, Maidstone Borough Council purchased the building in 1856 for the sum of ¬£1,200, investing a further ¬£300 for repairs. On 20 January 1858, the Museum opened as one of the UK's first local authority-run museums, appointing Edward Petty - a friend of the late Thomas Charles - as the museum's first curator in September. After its opening as a museum, the building was further extended to house the growing collections. A new east wing was added in 1869, matched by new wing to the west in 1873 made possible by donations from Julius Brenchley. The eastern elevation was extended in 1889 to accommodate the Bentlif Art Gallery funded by Samuel Bentlif to house the art collection amassed by his brother, George. On the western side, the Victoria Gallery, housing the town's library, was built between 1897 and 1899 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. The Bentlif Wing was extended in 1923.  Collections  Napoleon's chair The Museum is recognised as having the largest mixed collections in the county and one of the most important in the south-east of England, outside London. Whilst its origins are typical of a regional museum created through Victorian munificence, the work of collectors, staff and benefactors over almost 150 years has created a comprehensive collection of worldwide significance. Numismatist Elizabeth Pirie worked on the collections from 1957 to 1960. The collections consist of over 600,000 artefacts and specimens. Three collections are of national importance: * Anglo-Saxon ‚Äì the best collection of artefacts from the richest Anglo-Saxon region of Britain. * Japanese ‚Äì one of the largest and most important collections outside London. * The Brenchley Collection ‚Äì a large and diverse collection of worldwide ethnography, natural history and fine and decorative art collected by a mid-Victorian explorer: Julius Brenchley.  Human History  Kernos from Melos in Greece The Human History collections contain approximately 125,000 artefacts. The British archaeology collection covers Kent and beyond; the internationally recognized Anglo-Saxon collection comprises approximately 4,000 Kentish artefacts. Foreign archaeology includes pieces such as the Gandhara heads and over 400 Egyptian artefacts. A new acquisition in 2009 was the kernos from Melos in Greece; it is early Cycladic III period and 4000 years old. There are only eight of these in the world, and this one was possibly used to hold various offerings, such as honey and oats.Information from exhibit label The local history collections are varied and relate to all areas of local life. There are collections of arms and armour, clocks and watches and a collection of over 18,000 coins and medals. The collection of photographs and maps is of local importance and is complemented by over 10,000 items of printed ephemera relating to the history of Kent. There are internationally important collections of artefacts of Pacific, Oceanic and African ethnography as well as diverse material from Asia and North and South America. Napoleon's chair has been held in the museum since 1866. It was one of a pair in the house of Reverend Richard Boys on St Helena, and after Napoleon was exiled there in 1815 he habitually sat in this chair, conversed with Boys and damaged the chair with his penknife while talking.  The arts  The Fine and Applied Art collections comprise approximately 25,000 items. They include 17th to 19th century furniture, musical instruments, toys and games, ceramics, glass, costumes and needlework, paintings, prints and drawings and sculpture. One exhibit beloved of the local people is the Lady Godiva statue by John Thomas (1813‚Äì1862).

The collection of Chinese ceramics, mostly of 17th to 19th century date, is comprehensive. Approximately 8,000 specimens of costume date from the 17th to 21st century. Complementing needlework collections comprise around 700 specimens, including English embroidery and samplers, European embroideries and Eastern textiles. The Japanese collections of fine and decorative art material are important and amongst the most studied in the country. They include ceramics, sword fittings, netsuke, lacquer and books as well a series of over 750 Edo-period (1600‚Äì1868) woodblock prints. 580 oil paintings include minor continental Old Masters and 19th to 20th century British works. Watercolours include over 200 works by Albert Goodwin, the largest public collection of his work and local artist James Jefferys.  Natural history  Southern elevation of the 16th and 19th century museum building, in St Faiths Street. A collection of around 450,000 specimens in the natural history section includes specimens of national and international significance. The bird collections include 1,800 mounted British specimens, 400 foreign birds and over 1,100 cabinet skins. There are also 300 birds‚Äô nests and a collection of bird's eggs covering most species on the British list. The Herbarium contains approximately 30,000 specimens representative of the flora of the British Isles. There is also a British collection of some 6,000 specimens of critical genera including Rubus, Taraxacum and Hieracium. The Herbarium collection is the basis of Philp's Atlas of the Kent Flora. There is an entomology collection of around 250,000 specimens forming a comprehensive collection of British insects; and an important collection of several thousand shells, mainly of tropical marine origin, but including temperate marine and freshwater, and tropical terrestrial species. The collections of palaeontology and vascular plants are of national importance, with type, cited and figured specimens; the plants including voucher specimens for Kent and the nationally important Hawkweed (West) Collection. The main strengths of the palaeontology are the marine Cretaceous and Tertiary of Kent, especially Chalk, Lower Greensand and Lenham Beds; but also Gault and London Clay. There is an extensive collection of Pleistocene vertebrate material and fossils from the Kent Coalfield. Rocks (46,000) and minerals (7,000) are represented on a worldwide scale. The museum contains one of the most comprehensive mineral collections in the country outside the national museums.  Regimental Museum  The Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment Museum, an independent charitable trust, has been housed in the Museum since 1964 and forms one of Maidstone Museum's fifteen public galleries. Its collection of regimental memorabilia features over 3,000 medals, including four Victoria Crosses.

As a class they have a short research history, having been erected in the early 1980s. They typically possess a large, laterally flattened carapace that encompasses the entire body. The compound eyes tend to be large and bulbous, and occupy a frontal notch on the carapace. They possess three pairs of large raptorial limbs, and the abdomen bears a battery of small swimming limbs. The earliest thylacocephalan fossil is thought to date from the lower Cambrian, while the class has a definite presence in Lower Silurian marine communities. As a group, the Thylacocephala survived to the Upper Cretaceous. Beyond this, there remains much uncertainty concerning fundamental aspects of the thylacocephalan anatomy, mode of life, and relationship to the Crustacea, with whom they have always been cautiously aligned. Research history Fossil of Triassic Ankitokazocaris The Thylacocephala is only recently described as a class, yet species now included within the group were first described at the turn of the century. These were typically assigned to the phyllocarids despite an apparent lack of abdomen and appendages. In 1982/83, three research groups independently created higher taxa to accommodate new species. Based on a specimen from northern Italy, Pinna et al. designated a new class, Thylacocephala, while Secr√©tan ‚Äì studying Dollocaris ingens, a species from the La Voulte-sur-Rh√¥ne konservat- lagerst√§tte in France ‚Äì erected the class Conchyliocarida. Briggs & Rolfe, working on fossils from Australia's Devonian deposits were unable to attribute certain specimens to a known group, and created an order of uncertain affinities, the Concavicarida, to accommodate them. It was apparent the three groups were in fact working on a single major taxon (Rolfe noted disagreements over interpretation and taxonomic placement largely resulted from a disparity of sizes and differences in preservation.) The group took the name Thylacocephala by priority, with Concavicarida and Conchyliocarida subjugated to orders, erected by Rolfe, and modified by Schram. Taxonomy Ostenocaris cypriformis Researchers agree the Thylacocephala represent a class. Some efforts have been made at further classification: Schram split currently known taxa into two orders: *Concavicarida Briggs & Rolfe, 1983 which possesses: **A large, well developed optic notch **A discrete compound eye ** A fused rostrum ** 8 to 16 homologous well-demarcated trunk segments diminishing in height anteriorly and posteriorly ** Order includes Ainiktozoon (Silurian), Harrycaris (Devonian), Concavicaris (Devonian to Carboniferous), Dollocaris (Jurassic). *Conchyliocarida Secr√©tan, 1983: ** Lacks an optic notch ** Eyes on a protruding sac-like cephalon ** No rostrum. ** Order includes Convexicaris (Carboniferous), Yangzicaris (Triassic), and Atropicaris, Austriocaris, Clausocaris, Kilianocaris, Ostenocaris, and Paraostenia from the Jurassic. The accuracy of this scheme has been questioned in recent papers, as it stresses differences in the eyes and exoskeletal structure, which ‚Äì in modern arthropods ‚Äì tend to be a response to environmental conditions. Thus it has been suggested these features are too strongly controlled by external factors to be used alone to distinguish higher taxa. The problem is exacerbated by the limited number of thylacocephalan species known. More reliable anatomical indicators would include segmentation and appendage attachments (requiring the internal anatomy, currently elusive as a result of the carapace).  Anatomy  Based on Vannier, modified after Schram: The Thylacocephala are bivalved arthropods with morphology exemplified by three pairs of long raptorial (predatory) appendages and hypertrophied. They have a worldwide distribution. A laterally compressed, shield‚àílike carapace encloses the entire body, and often has an anterior rostrum‚àínotch complex and posterior rostrum. Its lateral surface can be externally ornamented, and evenly convex or with longitudinal ridges. Spherical or drop-shaped eyes are situated in the optic notches, and are often hypertrophied, filling the notches or forming a paired, frontal globular structure. No prominent abdominal features emerge from the carapace, and the cephalon is obscured. Even so, some authors have suggested the presence of five cephalic appendages, three of which could be the very long genticulate and chelate raptorials protruding beyond the ventral margin. Alternatively these could originate from three anterior trunk segments. The posterior trunk has a series of eight to twenty styliform, filamentous pleopod-like appendages, decreasing in size posteriorly. Most Thylacocephala have eight pairs of well developed gills, found in the trunk region. Beyond this there is a lack of knowledge about even basic thylacocephalan anatomy, including the number of posterior segments, origin of the raptorials, number of cephalic appendages, shape and attachment of gills, character of mouth, stomach and gut. This results from the class's all‚Äìencompassing carapace, which prevents the study of their internal anatomy in fossils. Affinities It is universally accepted that the Thylacocephala are arthropods, yet the position within this phylum is debated. It has always been cautiously assumed that the class is a member of the Crustacea, but no conclusive proof exists. The strongest apomorphy aligning the class with other crustaceans is the carapace. As this feature has evolved independently numerous times within the Crustacea and other arthropods, it is not a very reliable pointer, and such evidence alone remains insufficient to align the class with the crustaceans. Of the features which could prove crustacean affinities, the arrangement of mouthparts would be the easiest to find in the Thylacocephala. The literature features some mention of such a head arrangement, but none definitive. Schram reports the discovery of mandibles in the Mazon Creek thylacocephalan Concavicaris georgeorum. Secr√©tan also mentions ‚Äì with caution ‚Äì possible mandibles in serial sections of Dollocaris ingens, and traces of small limbs in the cephalic region (not well preserved enough to assess their identity). Lange et al. report a new genus and species, Thylacocephalus cymolopos, from the Upper Cretaceous of Lebanon, which has two possible pairs of antennae, but note the possession of two pairs of antennae alone does not prove the class occupies a position in the crown-group Crustacea. Despite a lack of evidence for a crustacean body plan, several authors have aligned the class with different groups of crustaceans. Schram provides an overview of possible affinities: *Nothing in either Uniramia or Cheliceriformes seems likely. *Conchostraca is possible, but there is no strong supporting evidence. *A maxillopodan connection is possible. Largely considered due to the Italian researchers' insistence (see disagreements). *Stomatopods show many parallels but have no comparison to cephalon or body regions. *Remipedes show some parallels. *Decapod-like gills suggest malacostracan affinities. In these various interpretations, numerous different limb arrangements for the three raptorials have been proposed: *antennules, antennae and mandibles *antennules, antennae and maxillipeds *thoracic (in keeping with stromatopod analogies) *maxillules, maxillae, maxillipedes Further work is necessary to provide any solid conclusions. Disagreements Numerous conflicts of opinion surround the Thylacocephala, of which the split between the ‚ÄúItalian school‚Äù and rest of the world is the most notable. Based on poorly preserved fossils from the Osteno deposits of Lombardy, Pinna et al. erected the class Thylacocephala. Based on inferred cirripede affinities the authors concluded the frontal lobed structure was not an eye, but a 'cephalic sac'. This opinion arose from the misinterpretation of the stomach as a reproductive organ (its contents included vertebral elements of fish, thought to be ovarian eggs). Such an arrangement is reminiscent of cirripede crustaceans, leading the authors to suggest a sessile, filter feeding mode of life, the 'cephalic sac' used to anchor the organism to the seabed. The researchers have since conceded it is highly improbable the ovaries are situated in the head, but maintain that the frontal structure is not an eye. Instead they suggest the 'cephalic sac' is covered with microsclerites, their arguments most recently presented in Alessandrello et al. *The structure is complex and \\"presumably multipurpose\\" *‚ÄúApart from a few features‚Äù it shows little affinity with a compound eye *There is a close connection with stomach residues, sac muscular system and outer hexagonal layer *Having a stomach between the eyes is unusual *Sclerites that should correspond to rhabdoms in 'eye theory' are interstitial to the hexagons, not at centre as would be expected for individual ommatidium. *Structural analogy with cirriped peduncle Instead the authors suggest the sac is used to break down coarse chunks of food and reject indigestible portions. All other parties interpret this as a large compound eye, the hexagons being preserved ommatidia (all researchers agree these are the same structure). This is supported by fossils of Dollocaris ingens which are so well preserved that individual retinula cells can be discerned. The preservation is so exceptional that studies have shown the species' numerous small ommatidia, distributed over the large eyes, could reduce the angle between ommatidia, thus improve their ability to detect small objects. Of the arguments above, it is posited by opponents that eyes are complex structures, and those in the Thylacocephala display clear and numerous affinities with compound eyes in other arthropod fossils, down to a cellular level of detail. The 'cephalic sac' structure itself is poorly preserved in Osteno specimens, a possible reason for interstitial 'sclerites'. The structural analogy with a cirripede peduncle lost supporting evidence when the 'ovaries' were shown to be alimentary residues, and the sac muscular system could be used to support the eyes. The unusual position of the stomach is thus the strongest inconsistency, but the Thylacocephala are defined by their unusual features, so this is not inconceivable. Further, Rolfe suggests the eyes' position can be explained if they have a large posterior area of attachment, while Schram suggests that the stomach region extending into the cephalic sac could result from an inflated foregut or anteriorly directed caecum. Discussion of the matter has ceased in the last decade, and most researchers accept the anterior structure is an eye. Confusion is most likely the result of differing preservation in Osteno. Mode of life Numerous modes of life have been suggested for the Thylacocephala. Secr√©tan suggested Dollocaris ingens was too large to swim, so inferred a predatory 'lurking' mode of life, lying in wait on the sea bed and then springing out to capture prey. The author also suggested it could be necrophagous, supported by Alessandrello et al., who suggest they would have been incapable of directly killing the shark remains found in the Osteno specimens' alimentary residues. Instead they surmise the Thylacocephala could have ingested shark vomit which included such remains. Vannier et al. note the Thylacocephala possess features which would suggest adaptations for swimming in dim-light environments ‚Äì a thin, non-mineralized carapace, well-developed rostral spines for possible buoyancy control in some species, a battery of pleopods for swimming, and large prominent eyes. This is supported by the Cretaceous species from Lebanon, which show adaptations for swimming, and possibly schooling. Rolfe provides many possibilities, but concludes a realistic mode of life is mesopelagic, by analogy with hyperiid amphipods. Further suggests floor- dwelling is also possible, and that the organism could rise to catch prey during the day and return to the sea floor at night. Another notable proposal is that, like hyperiids, the class could gain oil from their food source for buoyancy, an idea supported by their diet (known from stomach residues containing shark and coleoid remains, and other Thylacocephala). Alessandrello et al. suggest a head-down, semi-sessile life on a soft bottom, in agreement with that of Pinna et al., based on cirripede affinities. A necrophagous diet is suggested. Briggs & Rolfe report that all the Gogo Thylacocephala are found in a reef formation, suggesting a shallow water environment. The authors speculate that due to the terracing of the carapace an infaunal mode of life is possible, or the ridges could provide more friction for hiding in crevices of rock. Schram suggests a dichotomy in size of the class results from different environments; larger Thylacocephala could have lived in a fluid characterized by turbulent flow, and relied on single power stroke of trunk limbs to position themselves. He suggests that smaller forms may have resided in a viscous medium, characterized by laminar flow, and used a lever to generate the speed necessary to capture prey.

It was the 15th general election to be held in Turkey. All 550 members of the Grand National Assembly were up for election. The election was held during an ongoing economic crisis which followed the 2001 financial crash, which resulted in a deep resentment of coalition governments which had governed the country since the 1980 military coup. The Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Republican People's Party (CHP) had massive gains, transitioning from the multi-party parliament under a DSP-MHP-ANAP coalition government elected in 1999 to a two- party system ruled by the AKP and CHP, with no other parties winning any seats in parliament, only nine independents being elected, and the AKP and CHP combined winning 98.36% of parliament. The Justice and Development Party (AKP), which had only been formed in August 2001 by Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, won the election with nearly two-thirds of the seats. The protest vote was such that every sitting party previously represented in parliament was ejected, with the AKP winning 363 seats with just 34.3% of the vote. The only other party which passed the 10% threshold to gain representation was the Republican People's Party, which came second with 19.38% of the vote and 178 seats. The election produced Turkey's first single party government since 1987 and the country's first two-party parliament since 1961. The moderate Islamism advocated by the AKP was at odds with the secular establishment of the Republic of Turkey. While serving as the Mayor of Istanbul, Erdoƒüan was sentenced to a 10 month prison term in 1998 for reciting a poem in Siirt which incited racial intolerance. This barred him from initially seeking a seat in parliament, meaning that the AKP's co-founder Abdullah G√ºl became Prime Minister following their election victory. With the help of the CHP, the government overturned Erdoƒüan's political ban in 2003, after which he was able to seek a seat in a controversial by-election in the Province of Siirt. Erdoƒüan became Prime Minister in March 2003, with Abdullah G√ºl concurrently assuming the role of Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Results Voting ended in the country's 32 eastern provinces at 3pm, having begun an hour earlier in morning, and in the remaining 49 provinces at 4pm. Counting began immediately afterwards. A press black-out was placed on all results by the electoral authority so that it could ensure all ballot boxes were secure, but even when it became clear that every box in the country had been sealed, the authority refused to sway from its original deadline of 9pm. With early results being already announced by foreign media outlets, Turkish television switched to a live shot of the Electoral Authority headquarters until an announcement was made at 7.30pm revoking the black-out.  Total votes and seats for each party  Effects New government Although the AKP's victory was indisputable, Erdoƒüan's appointment as prime minister was delayed owing to his previous criminal conviction, which prevented him from standing for parliament. Another prominent party member, Abdullah G√ºl, became prime minister (Cabinet G√ºl) and remained in the position until a constitutional amendment could be pushed through to allow Erdoƒüan to stand for a freshly vacant seat in a March 2003 by-election. The AKP taking power may have contributed to the Turkish economic boom of the 2000s, though it is unlikely. Party resignations The result prompted the near-immediate resignations of several prominent figures in Turkish politics: *Mesut Yƒ±lmaz, former prime minister and leader of the Motherland Party (ANAP). He was succeeded by Ali Talip √ñzdemir *Tansu √áiller, former prime minister and leader of the True Path Party (DYP). √áiller was succeeded by her former interior minister, Mehmet Aƒüar. *Devlet Bah√ßeli, leader of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and junior coalition partner in the outgoing government. His resignation was not accepted by his party's central committee, and he remained leader. Outgoing prime minister Ecevit was widely expected to resign as leader of his DSP, but did not end up leaving until a party conference in 2004.

As a member of the RJD, Yadav was a member of the Bihar Legislative Council in 2001 and was also a Member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly prior to being elected in 2004 as a Member of Parliament for the Gopalganj constituency. He left the RJD after a dispute with the party leader, his brother-in-law, Laloo Yadav, that related to allocation of constituencies between that party and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). The Gopalganj constituency had become a reserved seat and an LJP candidate, who had not previously been successful in elections, was preferred to Yadav elsewhere. Two days after leaving the RJD, in March 2009, Yadav joined the INC and was unsuccessful in gaining re-election to the Lok Sabha \\\\- the lower house of the Parliament of India - when he contested the Champaran Lok Sabha constituency. In March 2010 he was briefly suspended from the Bihar section of the Indian National Congress (INC) for allegedly challenging the party's policy strategy. He denied voicing any such challenge and his explanation was accepted. Returning to the Gopalganj constituency, Yadav then fought and lost as a candidate for the INC in the 2010 Bihar legislative assembly election. That election saw confusion regarding the ages of several candidates, including Yadav. The candidates claimed that errors had resulted in the printing process for pre-election affidavits, and in Yadav's case this meant that he was recorded as aged 47 in 2009 when he had been shown as 44 at the time of the 2004 general elections. When asked for clarification by the BBC in 2009, he claimed to be aged 40. The 2003 film Gangaajal, which is based on true events in Bihar and features a politician character called Sadhu Yadav, caused Yadav's supporters to attack cinemas when it was released. Yadav himself attempted to prevent screening of the film, pleading to the court that it belittled him, but Prakash Jha, the director, claimed that \\"Sadhu Yadav is just a character in the movie. The movie has nothing to do with the profession of politics nor is it a caricature of the Bihar politician.\\" On 25 March 2014, he announced his candidature for 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Saran contesting against his sister and ex-Chief Minister of Bihar Rabri Devi. He stood as an independent candidate. However, he lost the seat to BJP candidate Rajiv Pratap Rudy. He finished a distant third from Barauli seat in 2015 assembly polls.

He is a former Member of Parliament from the Siwan constituency in the state of Bihar, and a former member of the National Executive Committee of the Rashtriya Janata Dal. He was disqualified from contesting elections following his conviction for the kidnapping and disappearance of Chote Lal Gupta, an activist of the Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Liberation for which he currently serving a life sentence. Shahabuddin has also been accused of killing 15 other Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Liberation activist including the former student leader Chandrashekhar Prasad. Mohammad Shahabuddin was elected for four successive terms to the Indian Parliament between 1996 and 2004 from the Siwan constituency. He was also elected for two successive terms to the Bihar Legislative Assembly in 1990 and 1995 from the Ziradei constituency. His wife, Hena Shahab has contested from the Siwan constituency as the candidate from the Rashtriya Janata Dal following his disqualification and has been described as a proxy candidate. Mohammad Shahabuddhin is described as a convicted gangster, a bahubhali (strongman) in the Siwan district and a close aide of Lalu Prasad Yadav, the president of the Rashtriya Janata Dal. He has also been described as a \\"Saheb\\" by his supporters.  Early life and education  Mohammad Shahabuddin was born on 10 May 1967 in the village of Pratappur, in Siwan district of Bihar. He was educated in Bihar and has a Master of Arts and PhD degree in political science.  Political career  In the early 1990s, Shahabuddin came into political limelight, joining the Janata Dal youth wing under Lalu Prasad Yadav. He won the 1990 and 1995 elections to the Vidhan Sabha (state legislative assembly), and was elected to the Lok Sabha in 1996 on the JD ticket, after which he grew in stature. With Lalu Prasad holding sway over the then state government of Bihar, and the formation of the Rashtriya Janata Dal in 1997, Shahabuddin's power increased dramatically. A report by the People's Union for Civil Liberties in 2001 states: : The patronage and de facto immunity from legal action offered to him by the RJD government gradually made him a law unto himself giving him an aura of invincibility. Since the police turned a blind eye to his criminal activities and allowed him to turn Siwan district into his fiefdom where his fiat ran. Shahabuddin's reign of terror was so complete that nobody dared depose against him in cases in which he was an accused.  Police-Shahabuddin firefight (16 March 2001)  In March 2001 the police were executing a warrant on the president of the local RJD unit, when Shahabuddin objected and slapped the arresting officer Sanjiv Kumar, while his men beat up the police. The police then re-grouped in strength and a pitched battle was launched on Shahabuddin's house, with help being sought from other police units in the vicinity, including one from Uttar Pradesh. In the extensive fire exchange that followed, two policemen and eight others were killed, with three AK-47s and other weapons being found near several of the deceased. Shahabuddin and his men escaped, setting fire to three police jeeps, and firing continuously to cover their movements. Neither Shahabuddin nor Manoj Kumar could be arrested. After this episode, several more cases were filed against Shahabuddin; however he could not be arrested. By the early 2000s, Shahabuddin was running a parallel administration in Siwan, holding sharia inspired khap panchayats to settle family and land disputes, fixing doctors‚Äô consultancy fees, and arbitrating on marital problems. In 2005, the Siwan District Magistrate described him as a habitual criminal.  2004 elections (fought from prison)  In late 2003, eight months before the 2004 general elections, Shahabuddin was arrested on charges of abducting a CPI(ML) worker in 1999, who was never seen again. Instead of staying in prison, he managed to get himself shifted to the Siwan hospital on medical grounds; there, a complete floor was set aside for him. Here he conducted meetings organizing his elections, and anyone could walk in to meet him, subject to checks by his bodyguards. Every afternoon at four, he held audience for his subjects, who arrived to meet their Saheb (boss), and to get their problems resolved. BBC report from Siwan on the eve of elections 2004. One petitioner turned out to be a policeman seeking a promotion; Sahabuddin called up the police bosses on his mobile phone and arranged things on the spot. For another petitioner, he called up a minister in Delhi. Another petitioner, wishing to resolve a land dispute, brought him a rifle as a gift, right there in his prison. Although the elections saw little activity by the opposition ‚Äì every shop carried a photograph of Shahbuddin, and according to a BBC report: : There is almost no sign of the opposition campaigning in the constituency. One villager, pleading that his identity should not be disclosed, said: \\"Do you want to get us hanged by telling you what we feel about elections here and who we would like to vote for?\\" In fact, several phone booth owners and other businessmen were killed after putting up banners or posters of opponents. A few days before the election, the Patna High Court directed the state government to ensure that Shahabuddin was properly jailed, instead of the hospital floor. During the elections, largescale rigging and booth capturing were reported from as many as 500 polling stations and re-polling was ordered by the autonomous election conducting body, Election Commission of India.  Results and aftermath  When the election results were announced, it turned out that although Shahabuddin won comfortably, his nearest Janata Dal (United) opponent, Om Prakash Yadav had managed to get two lakh votes, about 33.5% of the electorate. In the 1999 elections, JD(U) had polled only 7.5% of the vote, Election Commission of India website; 1999 general elections Siwan constituency results website so this was a huge gain for them. Within days of these results being announced, nine party workers of the Janata Dal (United) were killed, and a large number were beaten up; it is widely believed that this was a retaliation for daring to put up a credible fight. Harendra Kushawaha, the mukhia (chief of Panchayat or village council) of the Bhanta Pokhar village where Om Prakash Yadav had a strong majority, was shot dead at a government office. After several bullets were fired at Om Prakash Yadav's house, the civil authorities assigned him a posse of eight armed policemen as bodyguards. Well after the elections, a case was filed against Shahabuddin that he had lied in his electoral declaration; whereas he had said he had been named in 19 cases, at the time, there were 34 cases pending against him.  Home arsenal (April 2005)  Despite being the elected representative of the region, he was extended from Siwan for months in 2005, since he was perceived as a security threat. In April 2005, a police raid led by then Siwan S.P. Ratna Sanjay with the support of D.M.Siwan C. K. Anil on Shahabuddin's house in Pratappur helped recover illegal arms such as AK-47s, and other military weaponry authorized for possession only by the army, including night-vision goggles, Laser-guided guns, etc. Some of the arms had the markings of Pakistan ordnance factories, and the then Chief of Police (DGP), Bihar, D.P. Ojha alleged in a report that Shahabuddin had ties with the Pakistan intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Subsequently, eight non-bailable warrants were issued for arresting Shahabuddin. However, his party was part of the United Progressive Alliance headed by Manmohan Singh, and clearly he had considerable clout. Thus, although he was living in his official assigned quarter in Delhi, and attending parliament, the Delhi police and a special team sent from Bihar could not arrest him for over three months. However, a team from Bihar, without informing anyone, was finally able to arrest him from his official residence in New Delhi in November 2005. Subsequently, he was refused bail by the Supreme Court of India, where he was asked at one point: : By virtue of being an MP, are you entitled to keep these weapons, including a night vision device, when even the police, CRPF and other security agencies do not have it and only the army possesses it?  Political legacy  His wife Heena Shahab ran unsuccessfully for his former seat in parliament in 2009, 2014, and 2019 as a member of the RJD party.  Criminal trials  In May 2006, Nitish Kumar's National Democratic Alliance government set up a number of special courts for trying criminal-dons including Suraj Bhan Singh MP, and MP Prabhunath Singh from Nitish Kumar's own party, Janata Dal (United). However, Shahabuddin claimed to have suffered a slipped disc, and was not in a position to appear in court. Medical reports however, indicated that he was fit to walk. In any event, two special courts were set up inside Siwan Jail to try the cases pending against him. There were more than thirty criminal cases pending, including eight of murder, and 20 of attempted murder, kidnapping, extortion, etc. Of these, charges were initially framed in eight cases. Besides these police-registered cases, many other crimes are unreported. These include a large number of \\"disappearances\\" from Siwan; reports in the media allege that as many as a hundred bodies may be buried on the grounds of Shahabuddin's well-fortified Pratappur palace, the venue where the entire Bihar state police had to retreat after a fierce firefight while attempting to serve a warrant in 2001 (the three policemen killed in this battle also figure in the list of cases against him).  Attempts to intimidate the legal process  In July 2009, one of the session judges trying the cases, V.B. Gupta, was threatened by lawyer Mahtab Alam, who initially offered \\"allurements\\" for \\"rescuing\\" Shahabuddin. When this did not work, he threatened to eliminate the judge. Subsequently, the Patna High Court ordered that a charge be registered against the lawyer Mahtab Alam. In August 2006, while undergoing treatment in New Delhi, some supporters of Shahabuddin were prevented from entering by the Assistant Jailor of Patna's Beur Jail Vashisht Rai, then on deputation at the ward in AIIMS. Apparently Shahabuddin told Rai: : Your family lives in Baniapur (near Chhapra, Bihar). No one will survive. : Bahut din se tum logon ki pitai nahin hui hai. Bail hone do peet ke rakh denge (you people have not been beaten up for a long time. Let me come out on bail and I will thrash you)\\" The next day, he allegedly threatened jailor Sanjeev Kumar: : Tadpa tadpa ke maarenge (I will torture you slowly to death).  Convictions  Shahabuddin is possibly the most prominent criminal-politician in India today; his is the standard to which other criminal-politicians are compared.  Two years for assault on CPI-ML office (Mar 2007)  In March 2007, Magistrate V V Gupta in a Siwan court (held inside the prison) sentenced Mohammad Shahabuddin to two years imprisonment for the assault on the CPI-ML offices in Siwan on 19 September 1998. Shahabuddin and his armed supporters had bombed the premises and assaulted office secretary Keshav Baitha, who was brutally beaten up and suffered splinter injuries from the bomb blast. The court has also fined him Rs1,000 (about US$20. Indian fines follow antiquated laws, and are often very paltry in today's terms).  Life sentence for kidnapping leading to murder (May 2007)  In May 2007, he was convicted of the abduction of the trader and CPI(ML) worker, Chhote Lal Gupta, in February 1999, who was never seen thereafter and is widely presumed to have been While it could be established that Shahabuddin with his gang had kidnapped Chhotelal (a witness identified him), the dead body was never recovered, so charges of murder could not be upheld. Justice Gyaneshwar Srivastava sentenced him to life imprisonment under Section 164 (abduction with intent to murder). The verdict has been challenged in Patna High Court; some of the points noted are that the conviction relied on a lone witness, who identified Shahabuddin in court, after a gap of seven years, without the benefit of a prior identification parade. Under Indian law (section 8(3) of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1951), a person is disqualified from contesting elections if sentenced for more than two years. However, Bihar Home Secretary Afzal Amanullah has stated that this conviction needs to be after all appeals are exhausted, but it is likely that the Election Commission may have considerable latitude in this matter. Thus he may be barred from the 2009 elections; however, he continues to be a member of the present Parliament. Subsequently, he has been convicted in a number of other criminal cases, including a ten years rigorous imprisonment for attempted murder on the then Superintendent of Police, S.K. Singhal, in 1996.Shahabuddin gets 10 years. Indian Express (31 August 2007). Retrieved on 2015-10-26.  Pending cases  Trials are progressing in eight other cases in Siwan where charges have been filed. Simultaneously cases are also under trial in other parts of the country, including a triple murder case in Jamshedpur. One of the important trials is in regard to the abduction and murder of CPI-ML activist Munna Choudhary in 2001.  Out on Bail  On September 11, 2016, Shahabuddin walked out of the Bhagalpur Special Central Jail. Moments after coming out of Jail he jabbed at Nitish Kumar, the person under whose term and directions he was sent to jail. Though Shahabuddin said neither was Nitish instrumental in sending him to jail nor did he help in getting him bail. Speaking to the media persons gathered outside, he professed his loyalty to RJD chief Lalu Prasad, while making it clear that Nitish Kumar may be the chief minister but he was not his leader. ‚ÄúEveryone knows whom I have been with all these years, and whom I will remain with. Nitish Kumar paristhitiyon ke neta hai (a leader born out of circumstances),‚Äù he said, replying to a question.http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/out-on-bail- shahabuddin-takes-dig-at-bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-3024544/  Shifted to Tihar Jail, Delhi  On 30-09-2016 Shahabuddin's bail was cancelled.http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sc-supreme- court-to-pronounce-order-on-shahabuddins-bail-cancellation-3057225/ On 15 Feb 2017 the Supreme Court directed that he be transferred from Siwan Jail in Bihar to Tihar Jail in Delhi.

The method is based on the observation that to sample a random variable one can sample uniformly from the region under the graph of its density function.Damlen, P., Wakefield, J., & Walker, S. (1999). Gibbs sampling for Bayesian non‚Äêconjugate and hierarchical models by using auxiliary variables. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B (Statistical Methodology), 61(2), 331-344.Chicago Motivation Suppose you want to sample some random variable X with distribution f(x). Suppose that the following is the graph of f(x). The height of f(x) corresponds to the likelihood at that point. alt=alt text If you were to uniformly sample X, each value would have the same likelihood of being sampled, and your distribution would be of the form f(x) = y for some y value instead of some non-uniform function f(x). Instead of the original black line, your new distribution would look more like the blue line. alt=alt text In order to sample X in a manner which will retain the distribution f(x), some sampling technique must be used which takes into account the varied likelihoods for each range of f(x). Method Slice sampling, in its simplest form, samples uniformly from underneath the curve f(x) without the need to reject any points, as follows: # Choose a starting value x0 for which f(x0) > 0. # Sample a value uniformly between 0 and f(x0). # Draw a horizontal line across the curve at this position. # Sample a point (, ) from the line segments within the curve. # Repeat from step 2 using the new value. The motivation here is that one way to sample a point uniformly from within an arbitrary curve is first to draw thin uniform-height horizontal slices across the whole curve. Then, we can sample a point within the curve by randomly selecting a slice that falls at or below the curve at the x-position from the previous iteration, then randomly picking an x-position somewhere along the slice. By using the x-position from the previous iteration of the algorithm, in the long run we select slices with probabilities proportional to the lengths of their segments within the curve. The most difficult part of this algorithm is finding the bounds of the horizontal slice, which involves inverting the function describing the distribution being sampled from. This is especially problematic for multi-modal distributions, where the slice may consist of multiple discontinuous parts. It is often possible to use a form of rejection sampling to overcome this, where we sample from a larger slice that is known to include the desired slice in question, and then discard points outside of the desired slice. This algorithm can be used to sample from the area under any curve, regardless of whether the function integrates to 1. In fact, scaling a function by a constant has no effect on the sampled x-positions. This means that the algorithm can be used to sample from a distribution whose probability density function is only known up to a constant (i.e. whose normalizing constant is unknown), which is common in computational statistics. Implementation Slice sampling gets its name from the first step: defining a slice by sampling from an auxiliary variable Y. This variable is sampled from [0, f(x)], where f(x) is either the probability density function (PDF) of X or is at least proportional to its PDF. This defines a slice of X where f(x) \\\\ge Y. In other words, we are now looking at a region of X where the probability density is at least Y. Then the next value of X is sampled uniformly from this slice. A new value of Y is sampled, then X, and so on. This can be visualized as alternatively sampling the y-position and then the x-position of points under PDF, thus the Xs are from the desired distribution. The Y values have no particular consequences or interpretations outside of their usefulness for the procedure. If both the PDF and its inverse are available, and the distribution is unimodal, then finding the slice and sampling from it are simple. If not, a stepping-out procedure can be used to find a region whose endpoints fall outside the slice. Then, a sample can be drawn from the slice using rejection sampling. Various procedures for this are described in detail by Neal. Note that, in contrast to many available methods for generating random numbers from non-uniform distributions, random variates generated directly by this approach will exhibit serial statistical dependence. This is because to draw the next sample, we define the slice based on the value of f(x) for the current sample. Compared to other methods Slice sampling is a Markov chain method and as such serves the same purpose as Gibbs sampling and Metropolis. Unlike Metropolis, there is no need to manually tune the candidate function or candidate standard deviation. Recall that Metropolis is sensitive to step size. If the step size is too small random walk causes slow decorrelation. If the step size is too large there is great inefficiency due to a high rejection rate. In contrast to Metropolis, slice sampling automatically adjusts the step size to match the local shape of the density function. Implementation is arguably easier and more efficient than Gibbs sampling or simple Metropolis updates. Note that, in contrast to many available methods for generating random numbers from non-uniform distributions, random variates generated directly by this approach will exhibit serial statistical dependence. In other words, not all points have the same independent likelihood of selection. This is because to draw the next sample, we define the slice based on the value of f(x) for the current sample. However, the generated samples are markovian, and are therefore expected to converge to the correct distribution in long run. Slice Sampling requires that the distribution to be sampled be evaluable. One way to relax this requirement is to substitute an evaluable distribution which is proportional to the true unevaluable distribution. Univariate case For a given sample x, a value for y is chosen from [0, f(x)], which defines a \\"slice\\" of the distribution (shown by the solid horizontal line). In this case, there are two slices separated by an area outside the range of the distribution. To sample a random variable X with density f(x) we introduce an auxiliary variable Y and iterate as follows: * Given a sample x we choose y uniformly at random from the interval [0, f(x)]; * given y we choose x uniformly at random from the set f^{-1}[y, +\\\\infty). * The sample of x is obtained by ignoring the y values. Our auxiliary variable Y represents a horizontal \\"slice\\" of the distribution. The rest of each iteration is dedicated to sampling an x value from the slice which is representative of the density of the region being considered. In practice, sampling from a horizontal slice of a multimodal distribution is difficult. There is a tension between obtaining a large sampling region and thereby making possible large moves in the distribution space, and obtaining a simpler sampling region to increase efficiency. One option for simplifying this process is regional expansion and contraction. * First, a width parameter w is used to define the area containing the given 'x value. Each endpoint of this area is tested to see if it lies outside the given slice. If not, the region is extended in the appropriate direction(s) by w until the end both endpoints lie outside the slice. * A candidate sample is selected uniformly from within this region. If the candidate sample lies inside of the slice, then it is accepted as the new sample. If it lies outside of the slice, the candidate point becomes the new boundary for the region. A new candidate sample is taken uniformly. The process repeats until the candidate sample is within the slice. (See diagram for a visual example). Finding a sample given a set of slices (the slices are represented here as blue lines and correspond to the solid line slices in the previous graph of f(x) ). a) A width parameter w is set. b) A region of width w is identified around a given point x_0. c) The region is expanded by w until both endpoints are outside of the considered slice. d) x_1 is selected uniformly from the region. e) Since x_1 lies outside the considered slice, the region's left bound is adjusted to x_1. f) Another uniform sample x is taken and accepted as the sample since it lies within the considered slice.‚Üí  Slice-within-Gibbs sampling  In a Gibbs sampler, one needs to draw efficiently from all the full-conditional distributions. When sampling from a full-conditional density is not easy, a single iteration of slice sampling or the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can be used within-Gibbs to sample from the variable in question. If the full-conditional density is log-concave, a more efficient alternative is the application of adaptive rejection sampling (ARS) methods. When the ARS techniques cannot be applied (since the full-conditional is non-log-concave), the adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling algorithms are often employed. Multivariate methods Treating each variable independently Single variable slice sampling can be used in the multivariate case by sampling each variable in turn repeatedly, as in Gibbs sampling. To do so requires that we can compute, for each component x_i a function that is proportional to p(x_i|x_0...x_n). To prevent random walk behavior, overrelaxation methods can be used to update each variable in turn. Overrelaxation chooses a new value on the opposite side of the mode from the current value, as opposed to choosing a new independent value from the distribution as done in Gibbs. Hyperrectangle slice sampling This method adapts the univariate algorithm to the multivariate case by substituting a hyperrectangle for the one-dimensional w region used in the original. The hyperrectangle H is initialized to a random position over the slice. H is then shrunk as points from it are rejected. Reflective slice sampling Reflective slice sampling is a technique to suppress random walk behavior in which the successive candidate samples of distribution f(x) are kept within the bounds of the slice by \\"reflecting\\" the direction of sampling inward toward the slice once the boundary has been hit. In this graphical representation of reflective sampling, the shape indicates the bounds of a sampling slice. The dots indicate start and stopping points of a sampling walk. When the samples hit the bounds of the slice, the direction of sampling is \\"reflected\\" back into the slice. alt=alt text Example Consider a single variable example. Suppose our true distribution is a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 3, g(x)\\\\sim N(0,3^2). So: f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi \\\\cdot3^2}} \\\\ e^{ -\\\\frac{(x-0)^2}{2 \\\\cdot 3^2} }. The peak of the distribution is obviously at x = 0, at which point f(x)\\\\approx0.1330. # We first draw a uniform random value y from the range of f(x) in order to define our slice(es). f(x) ranges from 0 to ~0.1330, so any value between these two extremes suffice. Suppose we take y = 0.1. The problem becomes how to sample points that have values y > 0.1. # Next, we set our width parameter w which we will use to expand our region of consideration. This value is arbitrary. Suppose w = 2. # Next, we need an initial value for x. We draw x from the uniform distribution within the domain of f(x) which satisfies f(x) > 0.1 (our y parameter). Suppose x = 2. This works because f(2) = ~0.1065 > 0.1.Note that if we didn't know how to select x such that f(x) > y, we can still pick any random value for x, evaluate f(x), and use that as our value of y. y only initializes the algorithm; as the algorithm progresses it will find higher and higher values of y. # Because x = 2 and w = 2, our current region of interest is bounded by (1, 3). # Now, each endpoint of this area is tested to see if it lies outside the given slice. Our right bound lies outside our slice (f(3) = ~0.0807 < 0.1), but the left value does not (f(1) = ~0.1258 > 0.1). We expand the left bound by adding w to it until it extends past the limit of the slice. After this process, the new bounds of our region of interest are (‚àí3, 3). # Next, we take a uniform sample within (‚àí3, 3). Suppose this sample yields x = ‚àí2.9. Though this sample is within our region of interest, it does not lie within our slice (f(2.9) = ~0.08334 < 0.1), so we modify the left bound of our region of interest to this point. Now we take a uniform sample from (‚àí2.9, 3). Suppose this time our sample yields x = 1, which is within our slice, and thus is the accepted sample output by slice sampling. Had our new x not been within our slice, we would continue the shrinking/resampling process until a valid x within bounds is found. If we're interested in the peak of the distribution, we can keep repeating this process since the new point corresponds to a higher f(x) than the original point. Another example To sample from the normal distribution N(0,1) we first choose an initial x‚Äîsay 0. After each sample of x we choose y uniformly at random from (0, e^{-x^2/2}/\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}], which is bounded the pdf of N(0,1). After each y sample we choose x uniformly at random from [-\\\\alpha, \\\\alpha] where \\\\alpha = \\\\sqrt{-2\\\\ln(y\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi})}. This is the slice where f(x) > y. An implementation in the Macsyma language is: slice(x) := block([y, alpha], y:random(exp(-x^2 / 2.0) / sqrt(2.0 * dfloat(%pi))), alpha:sqrt(-2.0 * ln(y * sqrt(2.0 * dfloat(%pi)))), x:signum(random()) * random(alpha) ); See also * Markov chain Monte Carlo References External links * http://www.probability.ca/jeff/java/slice.html Category:Markov chain Monte Carlo Category:Non-uniform random numbers ","title":"Slice sampling"},{"id":"7149799","text":"The Northgate Hall stands in St Michael's Street, Oxford, England.

Background  It was Madrazo's second encounter with the United States court system. Madrazo's ship Isabelita was originally captured by a ship flying under the flag of Amelia, a colony in revolt from the Kingdom of Spain that had received no international recognition and was mainly run by Americans. A court in the said country deemed the capture of the Isabelita and her cargo of slaves legal booty and sold them to William Bowen. Bowen later transported the slaves to the Creek nation, where they were captured in Georgia. After their capture, Governor John Clark of Georgia ordered some of them to be sold while the others remained in his possession. After a round of suits in the district court of Georgia, Madrazo filed a suit in the circuit court on appeal. It was argued whether the district court had jurisdiction of the case. The circuit court ruled that it did and restored the slaves to Madrazo. Georgia appealed to the Supreme Court on the basis that the case was not a case of admiralty but a case against the state, giving Madrazo no grounds for a case because of the Eleventh Amendment. Marshall wrote in his opinion of Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 26 US (1 Pet.) 110 (1828) that Madrazo's claim against the Governor of Georgia was against a state because the Governor was acting in his official office of Governor and that the claim did not have basis because of the Eleventh Amendment, which forbids cases of law or equity against a state. He found a loophole that the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution exempts cases of admiralty, which are of original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.  Decision  The Supreme Court dismissed the case and found that the property was not in the jurisdiction of a court of admiralty or in the possession of a private person. The governor was not a private person but in possession of the state of Georgia. Madrazo's case was thus a suit of law or equity and so could not stand.

Siege of Acre, 1257‚Äì1258 The war began when the Venetians were evicted from Tyre in 1256 and war grew out of a dispute concerning land in Acre then owned by Mar Saba but claimed by both Genoa and Venice. Initially the Genoese navy had a clear upper hand, but its early successes were abruptly reversed when the Republic of Pisa, a former ally, signed a ten-year pact of military alliance with Venice. In 1257 a Venetian admiral, Lorenzo Tiepolo, broke through Acre's harbour chain and destroyed several Genoese ships, conquered the disputed property, and destroyed Saint Sabas' fortifications; however he was unable to expel the Genoese, who were 800 men strong and armed with 50‚Äì60 ballistae, from their quarter of the city despite throwing up a blockade; there were also siege engines among the Venetians.Many of these engines were given proper names by the anonymous author of the Gestes des Chiprois: Bonerel, Vincheguerre, and Peretin were Genoese machines, while Marquemose fought for Venice. . The famed Genoese crossbowmen took part in the fighting in Acre: the life of the Count of Jaffa was only spared by a chivalrous Genoese consul who forbade his crossbowman to shoot the Count from his tower. Pisa and Venice hired men to man their galleys in Acre itself during the siege: the average rate of pay of a Pisan- or Venetian-employed sailor on one of their galleys was ten bezants a day and nine a night. The blockade lasted more than a year (perhaps twelve or fourteen months), but because the Hospitaller complex was also near the Genoese quarter, food was brought to them quite simply, even from as far away as Tyre. At that point, in August 1257, the regent of the kingdom, John of Arsuf, who had initially tried to mediate, confirmed a treaty with the city of Ancona granting it commercial rights in Acre in return for aid of fifty men-at-arms for two years. Though Ancona was an ally of Genoa and John sought by his treaty to bring the feudatories ‚Äî most of whom were onside ‚Äî to support Genoa against Venice, his plan ultimately backfired and John of Ibelin and John II of Beirut \\"manipulated the complex regency laws\\" in order to bring the feudatories of the Kingdom of Jerusalem into a position of support for Venice.. Thomas B√©rard, the Grand Master of the Knights Templar, sided with the grand feudatories and Venice. He stayed with the master, Miles, of the Order of Saint Lazarus in Acre rather than in his own house, which was next to the Pisan quarter ‚Äì and the Pisans were initially backing Genoa (1258). In this they had the support of the new bailiff, Plaisance of Cyprus, Bohemond VI of Antioch, and the Knights Templar. At this juncture, Philip of Montfort, who had been providing food to the Genoese in Acre, was one of Genoa's only supporters. Philip was staying about a mile away from Acre, in a place called \\"the New Vineyard\\" (la Vigne Neuve) with \\"80 men on horses and 300 archer- villeins from his land\\" (lxxx. homes a chevau et .ccc. archers vilains de sa terre). In June, as per a plan, he marched on Acre and joined up with a band of Hospitallers while a Genoese fleet attacked the city by sea. The Genoese navy, numbering some 48 galleys and four sailing ships armed with siege engines, under Rosso della Turca was quickly overrun by the Venetians and the Genoese had to abandon their quarter and retreat with Philip to Tyre. The conflict wore down and by 1261 a fragile peace was in effect, though the Genoese were still out of Acre. Pope Urban IV, who had become understandably worried about the effect of the war in the event of a Mongol attack, a threat that passed without materialising, now organised a council to re-establish order in the kingdom following five years of fighting. Naval skirmishing, 1261‚Äì1270  The Genoese then approached Michael VIII Palaiologos, Emperor of Nicaea. After the Treaty of Nymphaeum was ratified in 1261, the emperor funded fifty ships to fight the Venetians. After this assault, in 1264, the Venetians returned to Tyre to conquer it, but backed out when Tyre received reinforcements. The ruins of the \\"Tower of Flies\\" today. During the continuous skirmishing of the 1260s, both sides employed Muslim soldiers, mostly Turcopoles, against their Christian foes. In 1266, the Genoese had made an alliance with Baibars, who was to outfit some troops for an expedition against Acre, but the Genoese' promised fleet never got underway. On 16 August 1267, Genoa managed to capture the Tower of Flies and blockade the harbour of Acre for twelve days before being evicted by a Venetian flotilla. The ongoing warfare between Genoa and Venice had a major negative impact on the Kingdom's ability to withstand external threats to its existence. Save for the religious buildings, most of the fortified and defended edifices in Acre had been destroyed at one point or other (and Acre looked as if it had been ravaged by a Muslim army) and according to the Rothelin continuation of William of Tyre's History, 20,000 men in total had lost their lives, a frightful number considering the Crusader states were chronically short on soldiery. The War of Saint Sabas was settled in 1270 with the Peace of Cremona, ending the hostilities between the Venetians and the Genoese. In 1288, Genoa finally received their quarter in Acre back.

What is distinct from conventional single-mode chromatography is that the secondary interactions in MMC cannot be too weak, and thus they also contribute to the retention of the solutes.  History  Before MMC was considered as a chromatographic approach, secondary interactions were generally believed to be the main cause of peak tailing. B.C. Trammell, M.A. Hillmyer, P.W. Carr, Anal. Chem. 73 (2001) 3323. D.R. Nau, in: M.T.W. Hearn (Ed.), HPLC of Proteins, Peptides and Polynucleotides: Contemporary Topics and Applications, VCH Publ., New York, NY, 1991, p. 331. B.Y. Zhu, C.T. Mant, R.S. Hodges, J. Chromatogr. 594 (1992) 75. H. Engelhardt, H. M√ºller, Chromatographia 19 (1984) 77. However, it was discovered afterwards that secondary interactions can be applied for improving separation power. In 1986, Regnier‚Äôs group synthesized a stationary phase that had characteristics of anion exchange chromatography (AEX) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) on protein separation. L.A. Kennedy, W. Kopaciewicz, F.E. Regnier, J. Chromatogr. 359 (1986) 73. In 1998, a new form of MMC, hydrophobic charge induction chromatography (HCIC), was proposed by Burton and Harding. S.C. Burton, D.R.K. Harding, J. Chromatogr. A 814 (1998) 71. In the same year, conjoint liquid chromatography (CLC), which combines different types of monolithic convective interaction media (CIM) disks in the same housing, was introduced by ≈†trancar et al. A. ÀáStrancar, M. Barut, A. Podgornik, P. Koselj, D. Josi ¬¥ c, A. Buchacher, LC‚ÄìGC Int. 11 (1998) 660. In 1999, Yates‚Äô group [11] loaded strong-cation exchange (SCX) and reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) stationary phases sequentially into a capillary column coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in the analysis of peptides, which became one of the most efficient technique in proteomics afterwards.

In 2009, Geng‚Äôs group first achieved online two-dimensional (2D) separation of intact proteins using a single column possessing separation features of weak-cation exchange chromatography (WCX) and HIC (termed as two- dimensional liquid chromatography using a single column, (2D-LC-1C). X.D. Geng, C.Y. Ke, G. Chen, P. Liu, F. Wang, H.Q. Zhang, X. Sun, J. Chromatogr. A 1216 (2009) 3553.  Advantages  Higher selectivity: for example, positive, negative and neutral substances could be separated by a reversed phase (RP)/anion-cation exchange (ACE) column in a single run. X.D. Liu, C.A. Pohl, J. Sep. Sci. 33 (2010) 779. Higher loading capacity, N.H. Davies, M.R. Euerby, D.V. McCalley, J. Chromatogr. A 1138 (2007) 65. R.L. Cunico, K.M. Gooding, T.

A 1089 (2005) 158. for example, loading capacity of ACE/ hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) increased 10-100 times when compared with RPLC, which offered a new selection and idea for developing semi-preparative and preparative chromatography. One mixed-mode column can replace two or even more single mode columns, which is economic and eco-friendly for employing the stationary phase more sufficiently and reducing the consuming and ‚Äòwaste‚Äô of raw materials. Single mixed-mode column can be applied for on-line two-dimensional (2D) analysis in a sealed system via establishing corresponding chromatographic system or off-line 2D analysis as two columns.  Classification of MMC  MMC can be classified into physical MMC and chemical MMC. In the former method, the stationary phase is constructed of two or more types of packing materials. In the chemical method, just one type of packing material containing two or more functionalities is used.  Physical methods  The simplest approach is to connect two commercial columns in series, which is termed a ‚Äútandem column‚Äù. Another approach is ‚Äúbiphasic column‚Äù, by packing two stationary phases separately in two ends of the same column. The third approach is to homogenize two or more different types of stationary phases in a single column, which is termed a ‚Äúhybrid column‚Äù or ‚Äúmixed-bed column‚Äù.  Chemical methods   IEC/HIC  Since IEC and HIC conditions are the closest ones to physiological conditions which are fit for maintaining biological activity, the combinations of them are widely used in the separation of biological products. IEC/HIC MMC has improved separation power and selectivity on the grounds that it applies both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. One such example is Nuvia(tm) cPrime(tm), from Bio-Rad Laboratories.  IEC/RPLC  IEC/RP MMC combines the advantages of RPLC and IEC. For example, WAX/RP has increased separation power and degree of freedom in adjusting the separation selectivity when compared with single WAX or RPLC.  HILIC/RPLC  Liu et al. synthesized a HILIC/RP stationary phase which could show RPLC or HILIC retention by adjusting the organic phase in mobile phase.  HILIC/IEC  Mant et al. reported that HILIC/CEX offered unique selectivity, stronger separation power and wider range of applications compared to RPLC for peptide separations.  SEC/IEC  Hydrophobic interactions in protein SEC are relatively weak at low ionic strength, electrostatic effects may contribute significantly to retention, and this allows us to use an SEC column as a weak ion exchanger.

Her brothers included William of Montferrat, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon, Conrad I of Jerusalem, and Boniface of Montferrat. She married Marquis Manfred II of Saluzzo before 1182, in which year she received lands in Saluzzo, Racconigi, Villa, Centallo and Quaranta, in case her marriage (like that of her sister Agnes) should need to be annulled for reasons of sterility.

However, Boniface died in 1212, and with the death of her husband in February 1215, Azala√Øs became regent of Saluzzo for her grandson, Manfred III. In 1216, she made a treaty with Thomas I of Savoy for a marriage between his son Amadeus and her granddaughter Agnes. However, the marriage never took place, possibly on grounds of consanguinity, since Azala√Øs was a first cousin of Thomas's father. Amadeus married Anne of Burgundy, and Agnes became Abbess of the Cistercian convent of Santa Maria della Stella in Rifreddo.comune.rifreddo.cn.it: Informazioni storiche Azala√Øs also made political and ecclesiastical agreements with Alba and with the Bishop of Asti. When young Manfred reached his majority in 1218, Azala√Øs returned to church patronage. In 1224, she endowed the convent of Rifreddo with the income of the church of San Ilario. In 1227, she made further grants to the canons of Oulx. She died in 1232, and was buried in the Cistercian abbey of Santa Maria di Staffarda.

Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne alpha virus that was first isolated after a 1952 outbreak in modern-day Tanzania. The virus has circulated in forested regions of sub-Saharan African in cycles involving nonhuman primate hosts and arboreal mosquito vectors. Phylogenetic studies indicate that the urban transmission cycle‚Äîthe transmission of a pathogen between humans and mosquitoes that exist in urban environments‚Äîwas established on multiple occasions from strains occurring on the eastern half of Africa in non-human primate hosts. This emergence and spread beyond Africa may have started as early as the 18th century. Currently, available data does not indicate whether the introduction of chikungunya into Asia occurred in the 19th century or more recently, but this epidemic Asian strain causes outbreaks in India and continues to circulate in Southeast Asia. A number of chikungunya outbreaks have occurred since 2005. An analysis of the chikungunya virus's genetic code suggests that the increased severity of the 2005‚Äìpresent outbreak may be due to a change in the genetic sequence, altering the virus' viral coat protein, which potentially allows it to multiply more easily in mosquito cells. The change allows the virus to use the Asian tiger mosquito (an invasive species) as a vector in addition to the more strictly tropical main vector, Aedes aegypti. In July 2006, a team analyzed the virus' RNA and determined the genetic changes that have occurred in various strains of the virus and identified those genetic sequences which led to the increased virulence of recent strains. 2005‚Äì06: R√©union The largest outbreak of chikungunya ever recorded at the time occurred on the island of R√©union in the western rim of the Indian Ocean from late March 2005 to February 2006. At its height, the incidence peaked at about 25,000 cases per week or 3500 daily in early 2006. After an initial peak in May 2005, the incidence decreased and remained stable through the summer hemisphere winter, rising again at the beginning of October 2005. By mid-December, when southern hemisphere summer temperatures are favorable for the mosquito vector, the incidence began to rise dramatically into the first two months of 2006. The number of reported cases was thought to be underestimated. The French government sent several hundred troops to help eradicate mosquitoes. Although confirmed cases were much lower, some estimates based on extrapolations from the number detected by sentinel physicians suggested that as many as 110,000 of R√©union's population of 800,000 people may have been infected. Twelve cases of meningoencephalitis cases were confirmed to be associated with chikungunya infection. Other countries in the southwest Indian Ocean reported cases as well, including Mauritius and the Seychelles,Chikungunya in La R√©union Island (France), World Health Organization, 17 February 2006 and in Madagascar, the Comoros, and Mayotte. 2006: India In 2006, there was a large outbreak in India. States affected by the outbreak were Andhra Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Delhi. The initial cases were reported from Hyderabad and Secunderabad as well as from Anantpur district as early as November and December 2005 and is continue unabated. In Hyderabad alone an average practitioner saw anywhere between 10 and 20 cases every day. Some deaths have been reported but it was thought to be due mainly to the inappropriate use of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory tablets. The major cause of mortality is due to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and loss of glycemic control. Recovery is the rule except for about 3 to 5% incidence of prolonged arthritis. As this virus can cause thrombocytopenia, injudicious use of these drugs can cause erosions in the gastric epithelium leading to exsanguinating upper GI bleed (due to thrombocytopenia). Also the use of steroids for the control of joint pains and inflammation is dangerous and completely unwarranted. On average there are around 5,300 cases being treated every day. This figure is only from public sector. The figures from the private sector combined would be much higher. There have been reports of large scale outbreak of this virus in Southern India. At least 80,000 people in Gulbarga, Tumkur, Bidar, Raichur, Bellary, Chitradurga, Davanagere, Kolar and Bijapur districts in Karnataka state are known to have been affected since December 2005. A separate outbreak of chikungunya fever was reported from Malegaon town in Nasik district, Maharashtra state, in the first two weeks of March 2006, resulting in over 2000 cases. In Orissa state, at most 5000 cases of fever with muscle aches and headache were reported between February 27 and March 5, 2006. In Bangalore, the state capital of Karnataka (India), there seemed to be an outbreak of chikungunya in May 2006 with arthralgia/arthritis and rashes. As well as in the neighbouring state of Andhra Pradesh. In the 3rd week of May 2006 the outbreak of chikungunya in North Karnataka was severe. All the North Karnataka districts specially Gulbarga, Koppal, Bellary, Gadag, Dharwad were affected. The people of this region are hence requested to be alert. Stagnation of water which provides fertile breeding grounds for the vector (Aedes aegypti) should be avoided. The latest outbreak is in Tamil Nadu, India - 20,000 cases have been reported in June 2006. Earlier it was found spreading mostly in the outskirts of Bangalore, but now it has started spreading in the city also (Updated 30/06/2006). More than 300,000 people are affected in Karnataka as of July 2006. Reported on 29/06/2006, Chennai‚Äîfresh cases of this disease has been reported in local hospitals. A heavy effect has been reflected in south TN districts like Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli. Residents of Chennai are warned against the painful disease. June 2006‚ÄîAndaman Islands (India) chikungunya cases had been registered virtually for the first time in the month of June 2006. In the beginning of the September cases have gone as much as in thousands. As reported in a local news magazine it has taken the state of epidemic in Andamans. Health authorities are doing their best to handle the situation. Relapsed cases have been noticed with severe pain and swelling in the lower limbs, vomiting and general weakness. As of July 2006, nearly 50,000 people were affected in Salem, Tamil Nadu. As of August 2006, nearly 100,000 people were infected in Tamil Nadu. Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu is one of the worst affected. On 24 August 2006, The Hindu newspaper reported that the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala had reported 1.1 million (11 lakh) cases. The government's claim of no deaths is questioned. 2007: Italy In September 2007, 130 cases were confirmed in the province of Ravenna, Northern Italy, in the contiguous towns of Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna. One person died. The source of the outbreak was an Indian from Kerala, India.(7 September 2007) Chikungunya outbreak in Italy Health Protection Report, Volume 1, Number 36, UK NHS, Retrieved 23 March 2015 2009: Thailand By the end of September 2009, the Thai Ministry of Health reported more than 42,000 cases during the previous year in 50 provinces in the south of Thailand, including the popular tourist destination of Phuket. About 14 years had lapsed since the last appearance of the disease. In May 2009 the provincial hospital in Trang Province prematurely delivered a 2.7 kg (6 pound) male baby from his chikungunya-infected mother in the hopes of preventing mother-foetus virus transmission. After a cesarean delivery, the physicians discovered that he had also been infected with the chikungunya virus, and put him under intensive care. The child died at six days from respiratory complications, possibly the only death from the outbreak, but the cause of death may not have been chikungunya since the child was delivered prematurely . The Thai physicians gave a preliminary presumption that chikungunya virus might be transmitted from a mother to her foetus. 2011‚Äì15 Pacific Islands Outbreaks in the Pacific Islands began in New Caledonia in 2011 and have since occurred in a number of Pacific countries. Fully 1/2 of the entire population of French Polynesia has come down with chikungunya Asian genotype (130,000 cases with 14 dead), exploding from a month earlier with 35,000 cases in December 2014; the first ever case was in 2013. 2012: Cambodia An outbreak occurred in Cambodia with at least 1500 confirmed cases. Provinces for which affection was confirmed were: Preah Vihear, Battambang, Kampong Thom, Kampong Chhnang, Kandal, Kampong Speu and Takeo. 2013‚Äì14: The Caribbean In December 2013, it was confirmed that chikungunya was being locally transmitted in the Americas for the first time in the French Caribbean dependency of St. Martin, with 66 confirmed cases and suspected cases of around 181. It is the first time in the Americas that the disease has spread to humans from a population of infected mosquitoes. By mid-January 2014, a number of cases had been confirmed in five countries: St. Martin, St. Barthelemy, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and the British Virgin Islands. At the start of April, at least ten nations had reported cases. By the start of May, there were more than 4,100 probable cases, and 31,000 suspected cases spanning 14 countries, including French Guiana, the only non-island nation with at least one reported case. On May 1, the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) declared a Caribbean-wide epidemic of the virus. As of 21 January 2014, no cases had been reported in Puerto Rico.Precauci√≥n con el virus Chikungunya. Marga Par√©s Arroyo. El Nuevo Dia. 21 Jan 2014. Retrieved 18 July 2014.

Shortly after another case was reported of a person in Florida being infected by the virus, not having traveled outside the U.S. These were the first two cases where the virus was passed directly by mosquitoes to persons on the U.S. mainland. Aside from the locally acquired infections, there were 484 other cases reported in the United States as of 5 August 2014. As of 11 September 2014, the number of reported cases in Puerto Rico for the year was 1,636. By 28 October, that number had increased to 2,974 confirmed cases with over 10,000 cases suspected. 2014: Venezuela In September 2014, the Central University of Venezuela stated that there could be between 65,000 and 117,000 Venezuelans infected with chikungunya. Health Minister Nancy P√©rez stated that only 400 Venezuelans were infected with chikungunya 2014: France On October 20, 2014, 11 locally acquired cases of chikungunya were reported in Montpellier, Languedoc-Roussillon, in the South of France. 449 imported cases of chikungunya were also reported throughout France during the period May‚ÄìNovember 2014.(8 December 2014) Chikungunya et dengue Institut de Veille Sanitaire, Retrieved 23 March 2015 2014: Costa Rica As of December 2014, Costa Rica had 47 reported cases of chikungunya, 40 of which originated abroad, while 7 were locally acquired. 2014: Brazil In June 2014 six cases of the virus were confirmed in Brazil, two in the city of Campinas in the state of S√£o Paulo. The six cases are Brazilian army soldiers who had recently returned from Haiti, where they were participating in the reconstruction efforts as members of the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti. The information was officially released by Campinas municipality, which considers that it has taken the appropriate actions. 2014:El Salvador On 25 September 2014, official authorities in El Salvador report over 30,000 confirmed cases of this new epidemic. 2014: Mexico On 7 November 2014 Mexico reported an outbreak of chikungunya, acquired by local transmission, in southern state of Chiapas. The outbreak extends across the coastline from the Guatemala border to the neighbouring state of Oaxaca. Health authorities have reported a cumulative load of 39 laboratory-confirmed cases (by the end of week 48). No suspect cases have been reported. 2014‚Äì2015: Colombia The first cases were officially confirmed in July 2014. Between that month and the end of 2014, as reported by the Colombian Health Institute (Instituto Nacional de Salud - INS ), there were 82,977 clinically confirmed cases and 611 cases confirmed through laboratory tests, bringing the total of confirmed cases during 2014 in Colombia to 83,588, 7 of which led to deaths. These cases were reported in the following regions: Amazonas, Atl√°ntico, Arauca, Antioquia, Barranquilla, Bol√≠var, Boyac√°, Caldas, Cartagena, Casanare, Cauca, Cesar, C√≥rdoba, Cundinamarca, Huila, La Guajira, Magdalena, Meta, Putumayo, Nari√±o, Norte de Santander, Sucre, Santander, Santa Marta, Risaralda, Tolima, San Andr√©s and Valle del Cauca. According to news outlets, as of January 2015 at least one major city (Medell√≠n) has issued sanitary alerts due to the expanding epidemic. By January 2015 the epidemic is considered to be in the initial expansion phase and it is expected by the Colombian National Health Institute (Instituto Nacional de Salud - INS) that the total number of cases will reach around 700,000 by the end of 2015 due to the in-country massive travel of tourists to and from regions where cases of the disease have been confirmed and the vector A. aegypti is indigenous. It is expected that the disease will become endemic and sustain itself, with a pattern of outbreaks similar to dengue fever, due to the fact that both vector and natural reservoirs are indigenous in large areas of the country. On 24 September 2015, the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of Colombia officially declared the country free of chikungunya. There were 441,000 reported cases but the government estimated the infected to reach the 873,000. 2019: Republic of the Congo The earliest case was reported on 7 January 2019 in Diosso, Republic of the Congo, and an outbreak was declared by the government on 9 February.

According to the historical account of India, this was the kingdom where Sugriva ruled with the assistance of his friend, Hanuman. This kingdom is identified to be the regions around the Tungabhadra river (then known as Pampa Saras) near Hampi in present-day Bellary district, Karnataka. The mountain near the river known as Rishimukha, where Sugriva lived with Hanuman during his exile, bears the same name. During the Treta Yuga, the whole region was within the dense Dandaka Forest, which extended from the Vindhya range to the South Indian peninsula. Thus, this kingdom was considered to be that of the Vanaras. During the Dwapara Yuga, the Pandava Sahadeva was said to visit this kingdom, as per the epic Mahabharata, during his southern military campaign to collect tribute for Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice. View of Kishkindha  References in Mahabharata and Ramayana  Though Kishkindha was mentioned in the epic Ramayana in great detail, some mention of this kingdom is also found in the epic Mahabharata.  Sahadeva's conquests  Sahadeva, the Pandava general, and younger brother of Pandava king Yudhishthira, came to southern regions to collect tribute for the Rajasuya sacrifice of the king. Sahadeva reduced to subjection King Vatadhipa. He then defeated the Pulindas (Pulindas in the south, see also the northern Pulindas) and then marched southward. He then fought for one whole day with the King of Pandrya (Pandya?). The long-armed hero having vanquished that monarch marched further to the south. Then he beheld the celebrated caves of Kishkindhya and in that region fought for seven days with the Vanara-kings Mainda and Dwivida. Those illustrious kings however, without being tired in the encounter, were gratified with Sahadeva. And joyfully addressing the Kuru prince, they said,--\\"O tiger among the sons of Pandu, go hence, taking with the tribute from us all. Let the mission of the king Yudhishthira the just possessed of great intelligence, be accomplished without hindrance.\\" Taking jewels and gems from them all, the hero marched towards the city of Mahishmati, and there he battled with King Nila.  Rama's history within Ramayan  A few chapters of Mahabharat, contains within it, the epic Ramayan in brief. Image:PlacesRelatedToRama.JPG|right|thumb|200pxPlaces related to Ramayan After the Vanar king Vali had been slain by Raghuvansi Ram, Sugriv, the younger brother of the king, regained possession of Kishkindha. Ram, meanwhile dwelt on the beautiful Malyavat Mountains (a mountain range, in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) for four months, duly worshipped by Sugriv all the while. Sugriv is mentioned as the ruler of the forest-kingdom Kishkindha and the king of the Vanaras (forest-dwellers), installed on throne by Raghuvanshi Ram and to whom all foresters and apes, monkeys and bears owe allegiance. Rama slew the Rakshasa king Ravana in battle and installed Vibhishana, Ravana's younger brother, on the throne of Lanka. Thus he regained his wife Sita from the clutches of Ravana. He then left Lanka and re-entered Kishkindhya with King Sugriva. Having arrived at Kishkindhya, he installed the old King Vali's son Angada as prince-regent of that kingdom. After that he left for his own capital city Ayodhya in the Kosala Kingdom Anjaneya Parvat, said to be the birthplace of Lord Hanuman The mountain Hrishyamukha (Risyamuka) where Sugriva and Hanuman spent their exile due to fear of King Vali is mentioned.  References to the Vanaras in Mahabharata  Vanaras were described as one of the exotic tribes of ancient India, along with many others, in the epic Mahabharata. Their kinship with other such tribes is hinted at in various texts. The Rakshasas, Yakshas, Vanaras and Kinnaras (these four were linked to the sage Pulastya) and with Kimpurushas (half-men, half-horse), Salabhas (butterfly-like beings‚Äîthe angels or fairies in western mythologies) and Valikhilyas (the followers of the movements of the sun) (the last three were linked to the sage Pulaha) were mentioned to have kinship. They were mentioned along with one of these or some of these tribes at many locations in the epic. Pampa Sarovar, the lake where Hanuman rested on his way to the Himalayas  Territories of the Vanaras  Kishkindhya and the southern India were the most populous territories of the Vanaras. However they were also found in the forests of the Himalayas (3‚Äì144, 157). Bhima in his wanderings saw the abode of the Vanara chief Hanuman in a plantain wood, on an elevated rocky base in the mountains of Gandhamadana in the Himalayas.

Biography Birnbaum was born in Kielce, Poland and emigrated to the United States in 1923. He attended Howard College and received his Ph.D. from Dropsie College. He served for several years as the principal of a Jewish day school in Wilmington, Delaware, and directed Jewish schools in Birmingham, Alabama, and Camden, New Jersey. He was a regular columnist and book reviewer for the Hebrew-language weekly, Hadoar. He also served on the board of directors of the Histadrut Ivrit b'America, an American association for the promotion of Hebrew language and culture.Guide to the Records of Histadruth Ivrith of America, jewishideasdaily.com His works include translations (with annotation and introductory material) of the siddur (first published in 1949), the machzor, the Torah with Haftorot, and the Passover haggadah. These translations sought to express reverence without appearing archaic. His Siddur and Machzor were pioneering in that the Hebrew text is of uniform typeface, \\"unlike the helter- skelter boldface paragraphing... found in Old World siddurim\\". His siddur also contains the rarely published Megillat Antiochus. Until the recent advent of the Artscroll translations, \\"the Birnbaum\\" siddur and machzor were widely used in Orthodox (and Conservative) synagogues, selling over 300,000 copies. These works presented \\"an accessible American English translation\\" and were pioneering in addressing American Jews' \\"perceived deficiencies in personal and communal prayer\\". Birnbaum is also well known for his works of popular Judaism: his excerpted translation of Maimonides Mishne Torah, was one of the first into English; his \\"Encyclopedia of Jewish Concepts\\" and \\"A Treasury of Judaism\\" (an Anthology excerpting over 70 classic works) were widely referenced. He also produced a \\"readable\\" summary and translation of the Tanakh. On his death, one writer described him as \\"the most obscure best- selling author\\". It is noteworthy that an immigrant at age 19 should achieve such status as a translator into English. Pedagogical innovation Birnbaum's siddur's introduction said: \\"Children, trained in reading the large type in the siddur, gradually develop a prejudice against whatever appears in the smaller print.\\" An individual who described his own background with \\"every shul in the neighborhood was Orthodox\\" was interviewed after serving as \\"deputy undersecretary .. in the Pentagon\\" and said about a trip abroad \\"I explored the base.. and was very surprised to find Birnbaum siddurim in one corner.\\" Influence and beyond The Jewish Agency's Culture department describes the Birnbaum as \\"One of the most useful versions of the prayerbook.\\" A Concordance listing ..if not every then at least the major of the Birnbaum vs. the \\"Expanded version of Siddur Eit Ratzon\\" shows more than Oscar Wilde's \\"Imitation is the sincerest form of...\\" Editing rejected Artscroll has rejected Birnbaum's reasoning for his change of a single letter in the Yigdal prayer, which appears to display either Birnbaum's unfamiliarity or disagreement with Perek Shirah.

Population: History In the early 18th century, Peter the Great ordered the resettlement of peasants from the Msta River to the current location of Podporozhye to organize navigation along the Svir River, known for its nearly impassable rapids. In the late 19th century, these minor settlements next to the Svir rapids (Sigovets and Medvedets) received the name of Podporozhye (literally, \\"under the rapids\\"). By the beginning of the 20th century, Podporozhye was a village and a part of Lodeynopolsky Uyezd in Olonets Governorate. In 1922, Olonets Governorate was abolished and Lodeynopolsky Uyezd was transferred to Petrograd Governorate (later Leningrad Oblast). On August 1, 1927, the uyezds in Leningrad Oblast were abolished and Podporozhsky District with the administrative center in Podporozhye was established. It was a part of Lodeynoye Pole Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. In 1932, the administrative center of the district was moved to the selo of Vazhiny. In 1936, the construction of the Upper Svir Hydroelectric Station, launched in 1952, began.

It is a faction of Kerala Congress founded by the former minister the late T. M. Jacob who has held portfolios like Education, Irrigation, Culture and Civil Supplies in the Kerala Legislative Assembly. Formation The Kerala Congress (Jacob) faction was born in 1993 when T. M. Jacob and his supporting MLAs ‚Äì Johnny Nellore, Mathew Stephen and P. M. Mathew ‚Äì decided to split from the Kerala Congress (M) party led by former Minister K. M. Mani following difference of opinion. P. M. Mathew and Mathew Stephen later returned to their former party, Kerala Congress (M). Kerala Congress (Jacob) has its strongholds in the eastern part of Ernakulam district, such as Piravom, Kothamangalam and Kuthattukulam, and in certain areas in the Alappuzha, and Trivandrum districts. Johny Nellore and a few members left the party on March 7, 2020 and joined the Joseph group.After Johnny Nellore's exit, Vakkanad Radhakrishnan was elected as the new Chairman of Kerala Congress (J) in the party meeting that was held on June 26, 2020 at Kottayam. History From its inception on 16 December 1993, Kerala Congress (Jacob) was an alliance member of the Indian National Congress-led United Democratic Front (India) (UDF). In 2005, K.C.(Jacob) left the UDF following differences with the new Chief Minister, Oommen Chandy, and dissolved into the newly-formed Democratic Indira Congress (Karunakaran) party led by former Chief Minister K. Karunakaran. DIC (Karunakaran) had been widely expected to forge an alliance with LDF for the 2006 assembly elections but instead it entered into an understanding with UDF. Both T. M. Jacob and Nellore lost in the elections, from Piravom and Muvattupuzha constituencies respectively. In 2006 September, following differences with the party President K. Muraleedharan, son of K. Karunakaran, T. M. Jacob and his supporters split from DIC(Karunakaran) and revived the Kerala Congress (Jacob) party. They were welcomed back by the Congress-led UDF after a period of hesitation. In 2011 Kerala Legislative Assembly elections, T. M. Jacob reclaimed his MLA status from Piravom by defeating M. J. Jacob of the LDF. However, the party's other candidate, Nellore, lost the election in the Angamaly constituency to Jose Thettayil of the LDF. T. M. Jacob became a minister in the newly elected UDF Ministry led by Oommen Chandy, handling the Food & Civil Supplies portfolio. T. M. Jacob died on 30 October 2011. Following this, his son, Anoop Jacob, who had been State President of Kerala Youth Front (Jacob), was nominated by the party and UDF to contest the Piravom assembly seat, earlier represented by his father. He won the by-election by a margin of 12070 votes, defeating M. J. Jacob. The results were out on 21 March 2012. UDF has announced that Anoop will be made a Cabinet Minister.

It is an ancient seat of the Clan Kerr, and after a period of institutional use it was restored for residential use by Peter Kerr, 12th Marquess of Lothian, in the late 20th century. History Ferniehirst Castle, courtyard Sixteenth-century conflict The original castle, built by the Ker (or Kerr) family around 1470, was occupied by English forces in 1547, during the war of the Rough Wooing. The English were dislodged by a force of Sir John Ker's clansmen, and the Earl of Huntly reinforced by Andr√© de Montalembert and French auxiliaries led by Captain Pierre Longue in February 1549. The gate was fired, then Montalembert d'Ess√© brought more artillery and the soldiers set about the wall with picks and mattocks. The French soldier Jean de Beaugu√© described the recapture and the fate of the English captain and garrison, and the aristocrat and priest Alexander Gordon wrote an eyewitness account.Cameron, Annie, I., ed., Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine (SHS, 1927), pp. 286-290, Gordon's account differs from de Beaugu√©'s over some details. An English army led by the Duke of Rutland recaptured the castle in June 1549, but the war was nearly over.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooings (Tuckwell, 2000), 140. The exiled Countess of Northumberland stayed at Ferniehirst Castle in January 1570.Thomas Wright, Queen Elizabeth and her Times, vol. 1 (London, 1838), p. 351. Ferniehirst was damaged by an English raid on 18 April 1570, after Sir Thomas Ker had raided northern England, which was also intended to intimidate the supporters of Mary Queen of Scots.Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 3 (London, 1791), p. 42. Another English army damaged the castle in 1573 on their way to Edinburgh Castle.William Boyd, Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), 161. James VI attacked the castle in 1593 as the Kers had assisted Francis Stewart, 1st Earl of Bothwell, who had conspired against the king. The Kers were for a long period Wardens of the Middle and East Marches. As the building had been undermined, reconstruction of the castle began in 1598. Later and recent uses The castle was unused in the 18th century, and re- roofed and repaired circa 1830, with a further major restoration of a part of it in 1890. It was used as a Scottish Youth Hostels Association hostel from 1934 to 1984, apart from during the Second World War, when it was requisitioned as a billet for troops. In 1988 major repairs, restoration, and alterations were carried out by Peter Kerr, 12th Marquess of Lothian, and the castle is once again a private home. It is currently used by his second son, Lord Ralph Kerr, who also owns Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire, and is the heir presumptive to the marquessate as his elder brother the 13th Marquess, the politician Michael Ancram, has no sons (though he has two daughters). The castle is open to the public during July. It is a category A listed building. The Ker Chapel, dating from the 17th century, is part of the property. Probably originally a mortuary chapel, it was re-roofed in 1938 and had restrained conversion and repair in 1988. It is now in use as a visitor centre and is also a category A listed building. Description Ferniehirst Castle, visitor centre The shorter arm of this L-plan fortalice is the 16th-century tower, containing the stair turret. The turnpike stair is in a spiral, corbelled out in the angle: apparently more for elegance than for necessity. There are many shot-holes, allowing a wide angle for musket fire, and of the more restricted shut-holes used for ventilation. The stair spirals counter- clockwise and is known as the \\"left-handed staircase\\" as it would put right- handed attackers at a disadvantage. The story is that in 1513 when the left- handed Sir Andrew Kerr came back from the Battle of Flodden, he had his men learn to use their left hands when swordfighting. In Scotland, left-handedness has been dubbed \\"Corrie-fisted\\" or \\"Kerr-handed\\". Ferniehirst also has a romantic array of conically-capped corner turrets. These ‚Äì known as studies ‚Äì are not primarily defensive: they open from the rooms of the upper floor. There is some Renaissance decoration around the windows and doors. The castle is approached through a classically-styled archway.

Across Monteoliveto street from the Fountain in the square is the Renaissance palace of Orsini di Gravina. History The church was originally built in 1411 by Gurello Orilia or Origlia, protonotary of the king Ladislas of Durazzo, who sponsored the construction of Santa Maria di Monte Oliveto, as it was first called. Some refer to this as the Church of Monteoliveto (it:Chiesa di Monteoliveto).Notizie del bello dell'antico e del curioso della citta di Napoli by Carlo Celano, Naples 1858, page 324. The church was sited near the Palazzo Carafa di Maddaloni. It was entrusted to the Benedictine order of Olivetans, whose mother house is Monte Oliveto Abbey in Tuscany. The convent received extensive patronage from Alfonso I of Aragon and members of his court. Further reconstructions of the church took place in 1581 by Domenico Fontana. In the 17th century, the church and convent were reconstructed in a Baroque style by Gaetano Sacco. In 1798, King Ferdinand I removed the Olivetan order from the convent and church. The lay Arch-Confraternity of Lombardi moved into the church of Monte Oliveto, which soon was renamed Sant'Anna dei Lombardi; the name was changed because the confraternity in 1798 had lost their own nearby church which had been dedicated to Sant'Anna. In 1805, the church collapsed in large part due to a recent earthquake. This collapse destroyed three Caravaggio paintings that once stood in the church: St Francis in Meditation, St Francis Receives Stigmata and a Resurrection.The Flemish painter Louis Finson (or Finsonius) made a copy of the latter, today found Aix-en-Provence. The entire complex was at one time one of the largest monasteries in Italy, occupying what today can be measured only in \\"city blocks\\". Urban renewal from the 1930s literally built around the old premises, leaving much of the original structure standing in the center. For example, the gigantic main post office in Naples is at west end of the old monastery and the older edifice was simply incorporated into the back of the Naples Central Post Office such that the monastery seems to flow out of the more modern building. At the east end, the church, itself, is still in use, but the adjacent monastery premise and courtyard are now a Carabinieri (Italian national police force) barracks. Description  aisle towards altar The church structure is unusual in that the nave has no transept, thus no crossing, but instead has a linear rectangular layout with ten lateral chapels. The initial plan is attribute to Andrea Ciccione,C. Celano, page 325. but it underwent an updated refurbishment in a late Renaissance style by Fontana. He is commemorated in the portico by a monument. The architect Benedetto da Majano helped design and decorate the Piccolomini and Correale Chapels.

Among its decorated interiors are the 16th century sanctuary which contains sculpture by Guido Mazzoni, Antonio Rossellino, Benedetto da Majano, Giovanni da Nola, Pedro Rubiales and others. Gothic details are still preserved in the tomb of Domenico Fontana, and the altar was executed on the design of Giovan Domenico Vinaccia by Bartolomeo and Pietro Ghetti. At the mouth of the piazza in front of the church, is the Fontana di Monteoliveto (Fountain of Monteoliveto).

Lester Piggot rode Boucher when it won the 1981 St Leger at Doncaster. Training career Dickinson got his trainer's licence in 1980, taking over his parents' stables. He trained at Dunkeswick near Harewood in Yorkshire and was the Champion Trainer of National Hunt racing for three years in England. Two of his formative years were spent under the tutelage of Vincent O'Brien, the legendary Irish trainer who was master of Ballydoyle, the training center in County Tipperary. Michael Dickinson is perhaps most famous for his extraordinary feat of training the first five in the 1983 Cheltenham Gold Cup. In order: Bregawn, Captain John, Wayward Lad, Silver Buck, and Ashley House. The BBC has an interesting account of Dickinson's Famous Five. He also trained a record 12 winners on Boxing Day in 1982, both of which are in the Guinness Book of World Records. He has three other further world records noted in the Guinness Book of World Records. Dickinson also briefly trained flat racing horses for Robert Sangster before emigrating to Maryland in the U.S., where he had his first runner on 30 June 1987. In 1993, he was elected to the British Steeplechasing Hall of Fame and inducted on its opening in 1994. Dickinson's most acclaimed flat training feat came with Da Hoss.

He composed in a style commonly known as the ars subtilior. Life and career It has been suggested that Jacob Senleches was born in Senleches (or Sanlesches) in Cambrai, today France.Tomasello In 1382, Senleches seems to have been present at the court of Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Castile (d. September 1382), possibly in her service. In Fuions de ci, he laments Eleanor's death and resolves to seek his fortune either \\"en Aragon, en France ou en Bretaingne\\". Afterwards, he is found in the service of Pedro de Luna, Cardinal of Aragon (later Antipope Benedict XIII, 1394‚Äì1423), as a harpist. There is a treasury document assigning payments to one \\"Jaquemin de Sanleches, juglar de harpe\\" from the royal household in Navarra dated August 21, 1383. The payment was made so that Jacquemin could return to \\"his master\\", Pedro de Luna.G√ºnther In a document related to the coronation of Pedro de Luna as Antipope Benedict XIII, \\"Jacobus de Senleches\\" was granted on 30 October 1394 a canonicate with expectation of a prebend at the Basilica of Saint Martin, Tours.Planchart, vol. 1, p. 11 Despite the small number of transmitted compositions, Jacob de Senleches is counted among the central personalities of Ars subtilior. All his compositions are polyphonic settings of French texts for three parts. Some texts appear autobiographical while others participate in a widespread tradition of textual and musical citation.

In 295, Tuoba Luguan the chieftain of the Tuoba (a branch of the Xianbei) divided the territory under Tuoba control into three areas: a vast tract of land extending west from White Mountain (northeast of Zhangjiakou), to Dai (Datong, Shanxi); an area from Shengle (south of Hohhot) and beyond; and a central area, which included north Shanxi and the region to its north. Tuoba Yilu would be named chieftain of the western area.

He was first a member of the Dalton Gang, but after being called \\"too wild\\" by Bob Dalton, he and Bill Doolin started the Wild Bunch gang. Early life & career Newcomb was born near Fort Scott, Kansas in 1866. From a poor family, he began working as a cowboy early in life, at the age of 12. Newcomb's first job was on the \\"Long S Ranch\\", owned by C.C. Slaughter. Circa 1892, he drifted into the Oklahoma Territory, where he first met Bill Doolin. The Wild Bunch held its origins in the Dalton Gang, of which Newcomb, Doolin, and Charley Pierce were members. They took part in the botched train robbery in Adair, Oklahoma Territory, on July 15, 1892, in which two guards and two townsmen, both doctors, were wounded, one of the doctors dying the next day. Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce complained that Bob was not dividing money fairly amongst the gang and left in protest, but would later return. According to some accounts, Bob Dalton told Doolin, Newcomb, and Pierce that he no longer needed them. Doolin and his friends returned to their hideout in Ingalls, Oklahoma Territory. On October 5, the remaining members of the Dalton Gang would be killed (except Emmett who survived despite being shot 27 times) in Coffeyville, Kansas. Doolin organized his own gang in 1893, calling them the Wild Bunch, from the remains of the original Dalton Gang with Newcomb as a member. Bill Dalton later also joined the group and they became known as the Doolin-Dalton Gang. Newcomb also began a romantic relationship with a 14-year-old girl named Rose Dunn; she had four brothers who were outlaws and knew Newcomb, though they later became bounty hunters, calling themselves the Dunn Brothers. By 1895, Newcomb was a fugitive with a $5,000 reward on him, dead or alive. Rose Dunn traveled with him, since she could easily go into a town to purchase supplies. The gang often took refuge in the town of Ingalls, Oklahoma, which was frequented by numerous outlaw gangs of the day, and in which the local residents often defended the outlaws and assisted in hiding them from lawmen, due to the outlaws contributing greatly to the local economy. In one shootout with lawmen in Ingalls, called the Battle of Ingalls, during which three lawmen and three outlaws were shot, Rose Dunn was alleged to have helped save Newcomb's life after he had been wounded, by running through the gun-battle bringing him extra ammunition, and firing a rifle at lawmen while he reloaded his pistols. However, that is believed to be legend, and by the US Marshals' account, Newcomb fought less than admirably, firing at most two shots before being wounded and fleeing. After several shootouts with lawmen, Newcomb fled with outlaw Charley Pierce to a hideout near Norman, Oklahoma, both of them having been wounded in the Ingalls shootout with US Marshals. Death On May 2, 1895, Newcomb and Charley Pierce rode up to the Dunn ranch, possibly to visit Rose. As soon as they dismounted, her brothers opened fire, dropping both outlaws. The next day, the Dunn brothers had loaded the two bodies into their wagon and were driving it into town to collect the reward, when Newcomb suddenly moaned and asked for water, to which one of the brothers responded with another bullet. It is not known as to whether Rose Dunn assisted in this or not. There has been much speculation that Rose Dunn was in contact with her family, and that her brothers followed her to the ranch, then waited for her to leave before they entered and killed the two outlaws. She denied that she had betrayed Newcomb, and her brothers supported her version of the story, indicating that she had no knowledge that they were tracking Newcomb, for their fear that she would reveal this to Newcomb and thus eliminate their ability to surprise the outlaws. Bill Dunn, the leader of the Dunn Brothers, was killed shortly thereafter when he fired two rounds at Sheriff Frank Canton, a well known gunman, due to Canton investigating the brothers for cattle rustling, at which time Canton returned fire, killing Dunn.

Demolished 2013. The former Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (POL) is based in Brownlow Street, Liverpool, England. In April 2010, POL merged with the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton (NOCS) to form the National Oceanography Centre. The Liverpool laboratory's scientific research focuses on oceanography encompassing global sea-levels and geodesy, numerical modelling of continental shelf seas and coastal sediment processes. This research alongside activities of surveying, monitoring, data management and forecasting provides strategic support for the wider mission of the Natural Environment Research Council. A leading world centre in tidal prediction (with related interests in earth tides and storm surges) and a leading European centre in modelling and forecasting shelf sea dynamics, it is home to the Coastal Observatory in Liverpool Bay, the National Tidal and Sea Level Facility, the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level and the British Oceanographic Data Centre. History The story of tidal measurements taken at Liverpool starts with Jeremiah Horrocks (1619‚Äì1641). He was one of the great scientists of the 17th century, and a man even Isaac Newton held in high regard. He is most famous for predicting, and then observing, the transit of Venus in 1639 at Much Hoole near Preston. However, he also had a great interest in understanding ocean tides, and in particular in verifying that tidal changes were closely related to variations in the Moon's orbit. Horrocks was born and died at Toxteth. Shortly before his death, he is known to have made measurements of high waters (probably the times and perhaps also the heights of high tide) on the Mersey coast near his home for at least a month. Unfortunately, his tidal measurements (but not his astronomical records) were lost in the civil war or possibly in the Fire of London. A second major figure is William Hutchinson (1716‚Äì1801) who compiled the first extended set of sea level measurements in the UK, together with a comprehensive set of meteorological information. His measurements of the heights and times of every high water during 1764‚Äì1793 at the Liverpool Old Dock not only spanned many years but were of high quality and are still being used in scientific research today. Hutchinson made many important contributions to Liverpool's history. The first half of his life was spent as a mariner and privateer captain during the Seven Years' War. Only in the second half did he develop into becoming a dock master, entrepreneur, inventor, author, philanthropist and, what we would nowadays call, scientific researcher. To mark Liverpool 2007 and 2008, POL together with colleagues at Brock University, Canada will produce a CD containing copies of all Hutchinson's tidal and meteorological data sets and background information on his life. Hutchinson's measurements of the tides during 1764‚Äì1767 were used by Richard and George Holden to derive the first reliable publicly accessible tide tables in the UK. They first appeared in 1770 and were published for over 200 years. 19th century During the 19th century, the Mersey Docks & Harbour Board (MDHB) established an impressive network of a dozen state-of-the-art sea level stations along the Mersey, Dee and neighbouring coasts. They were used to provide the best possible tidal information to what became one of the most important ports in the Empire, together with data for surveying and coastal engineering. The main Liverpool gauges were at George‚Äôs Pier (the present-day Pier Head), then Prince's Pier (next to the ocean liner landing stage) and now Gladstone Dock. Together these sites have provided data which make up the longest UK sea level record and one of the longest in the world. These data have been used to study long term changes in mean sea levels and in the sea level extreme levels which often result in flooding. In 1845 the MDHB established the Liverpool Observatory at Waterloo Dock, to provide all the tidal, meteorological and astronomical information required by ship owners. The expanding port resulted in the Observatory being relocated in 1866 to Bidston Hill on the Wirral, where Hutchinson had established Bidston Lighthouse in 1771. Its work became more focused on scientific research, rather than port operations, in 1929 when the Liverpool Observatory was merged with the Liverpool University Tidal Institute. This combined institute (with a number of name changes and official owners) was to become a world-famous centre for sea level and tidal research with no less than three Fellows of the Royal Society among its Directors: Joseph Proudman, Arthur Doodson and David Cartwright. 20th century In recent decades the institute has concentrated on sea level monitoring and prediction around UK coasts, and indeed on understanding sea level changes worldwide: the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level having been established at Bidston by Proudman in 1933 and as important as ever today. Such understanding informs government departments on policies for coastal protection, and contributes to international scientific study groups such as those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Thanks to the work of Doodson and other scientists in Liverpool, the tide can be predicted at any location around the UK with several centimetre accuracy. Superimposed upon the ‚Äòastronomical tide‚Äô, which is caused by the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun, is the ‚Äòstorm surge‚Äô caused by strong winds and low air pressures. The major flood at Sea Palling and other parts of the north Norfolk coast in 1953 resulted from a large storm surge occurring at high tide. This disaster led to the development of the UK National Tide Gauge Network and the UK Storm Tide Forecasting System. POL led the development of computer models to predict UK storm surges several days ahead based on forecast weather information. Routine surge forecasts are now produced by the Met Office and result in Flood Warnings issued by the Environment Agency. The institute was renamed the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory in 1987, a name which survived its move from Bidston to the campus of Liverpool University in 2004. Sea Level Science now constitutes one of the three main areas of expertise of POL research, the other two closely related fields being shelf sea science and numerical modelling of ocean processes. Although Sea Level Science has come a long way since Horrocks' measurements at Toxteth, the scientific importance of the subject is as great as ever, and Liverpool remains one of its main worldwide centres of excellence and its ‚ÄòUK home‚Äô.  Coastal Observatory  POL houses the Coastal Observatory in Liverpool Bay. Its objective is to study a typical coastal sea's response both to natural forces and to the effects of human activity. The Observatory integrates real-time data measurements with data from models into a \\"pre-operational coastal prediction system\\" whose results will be displayed on the web. The concept is founded on obtaining data in real time, using telemetry, sending the data from underwater to the sea surface, to land, to POL's web site, enabling what is often known as 'armchair oceanography'.  Measurements  The aim of the Coastal Observatory is to build a time series of data. The Observatory has a particular interest in such areas as storm surges, seasonality, and variations in river discharge, with an emphasis on the River Mersey. August 2007 marked five years of continuous running of the Coastal Observatory in Liverpool Bay, taking measurements such as: *In situ time series of current, temperature and salinity profiles and of waves and weather. A second site, and measurements of turbidity and chlorophyll are now also operational. *The CEFAS SmartBuoy for surface properties including nutrients and chlorophyll. *Instrumented ferries for near surface temperature, salinity, turbidity, chlorophyll and later, nutrient data. The first route was Liverpool to Douglas (Isle of Man), with the ferry travelling between Birkenhead (Liverpool) and Dublin (Ireland) *Drifters, measuring surface currents and properties such as temperature and salinity. *Tide gauges, with sensors for meteorological, waves, temperature and salinity data, where appropriate. *Meteorological data from HF radar and tide gauge sites. *Shore-base HF radar measuring waves and surface currents out to a range of 50 km. *Satellite data - infra-red (for sea surface temperature) and visible (for chlorophyll and suspended sediment) spectra.

He was the leader of the Northern Bloc of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia. He demobilized with his two thousand men strong group on March 10, 2006 in La Mesa, Department of Cesar. A laptop computer belonging to Tovar contained information on over 550 murders and started the 2006 Para- political scandal in which several congressmen have been indicted for corruption. Reuters AlertNet, October 13, 2006] Accessed February 17, 2007 From cattle owner and farmer, member of Fenalce and Fedearroz and a public official, pass to command 4500 men of the Northern Bloc that dominate the territories of Cesar, La Guajira, Magdalena, Atl√°ntico and part of both Santander and Norte de Santander Departments. \\"Just hearing his name instills fear in us\\", said a member of the Kankuamos, a native community from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta who accused him of the assassination of more than 100 of their members. He is also accused of covertly masterminding the repression of the Aseguradoras del R√©gimen Subsidiado de Salud (ARS) (Spanish for Health Subsidized Regime Insurance) in many municipalities in the Caribbean Region. Besides, he's the alleged ring leader of a loose confederation of drug traffickers operating in the eastern zone of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (a coastal mountain range in northern Colombia) and La Guajira (and adjacent region bordering Venezuela). Due to these activities the United States Government has asked for his extradition in order to bring him to an American court. Jorge 40 was indicted for masterminding the massacre of over 60 natives from the aboriginal Wayuu and Wiwa tribes in La Guajira and Magdalena provinces. They were allegedly executed by the Northern Bloc in 2004. Jorge 40 has also been connected to the death of 21 people in the municipality of Aracataca better known by its fictional name 'Macondo' (Magdalena). The Organization of American States (OAS) denounced Jorge 40's paramilitary activities colluded with local government forces in order to kill eight people in Curumani, Cesar, accusing them to be informants of the ELN guerrilla. The massacre occurred between December 4 and December 5, 2005. El Espectador Massacres *Bah√≠a Portete massacre *Villanueva massacre  Extradition to the United States  In the early morning of May 13, 2008 'Jorge 40' and twelve other paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in a surprise action by the Colombian government. According to Colombian Interior Minister Carlos Holguin they have been refusing to comply to the country's Peace and Justice law and are therefore extradited to the United States. The National Movement of State Crimes, a coalition of several victim organizations that have suffered from state or paramilitary violence, has asked \\"to return the paramilitary chiefs to the Colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the Law of Justice and Peace, since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims, since they have not told all of the truth, have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims, and have not dismantled their criminal structures.\\" Extradition Cut Short ‚Äò‚ÄôCCAJAR‚Äô‚Äô May 27, 2008 The Office in Colombia of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that \\"[...] according to Colombian law, the reasons claimed by the President of the Republic to proceed with the previously-suspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the ‚ÄòLaw of Justice and Peace‚Äô and for the loss of the benefits established therein\\". The Inter- American Commission stated that this \\"affects the Colombian State's obligation to guarantee victims‚Äô rights to truth, justice, and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups. The extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the Justice and Peace Law in Colombia and through the Colombian justice system's regular criminal procedures. It also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict, and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused. This action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the State and these paramilitary leaders.\\" On August 18, 2020 Colombian radio station La W reported that Tovar Pupo will be released from the federal detention facility at Allenwood, PA and would likely be deported back to Colombia. According to the inmate locator feature for the Bureau of Prisons, Tovar Pupo‚Äôs release date was September 6, 2020 (inmate number 80517-004). Return to Colombia and reimprisonment On September 29, 2020, following his release from prison in the United States, Tovar Pupo returned to Colombia. Upon arrival, he was immediately detained by authorities to face 1,486 investigative procedures At the time of the arrest, Tovar Pupo had 65 arrest warrants and 109 detention orders in Colombia.

It has been transmitted via two sources. The first source dated c. 1395 is the manuscript Chicago, Newberry Library, Ms. 54.1, f. 10r (RISM siglum US-Cn 54.1, also known under the siglum Chic). In this source, the work is transmitted anonymously, i.e. the name of the composer is not given. The virelai is notated for two voices, cantus and tenor. The voices are notated on what appears to be the strings of the harp, on four \\"staves\\", the first of ten lines the other of nine lines. (That would be 37 strings, but only 22 tuning pins are depicted.) However, notes are only placed on the drawn strings or lines and not between them, forming a pseudo-tablature that is somewhat difficult to read in the first instance. A separate rondeau, explaining how to derive the canonic third voice from the cantus, is written on a banner wrapped around the fore pillar of the harp. The second source of this composition is the famous Codex Chantilly, Chantilly, Biblioth√®que du Mus√©e Conde, ms. 564 (formerly 1047), f. 43v (RISM siglum F-Ch 564). In this source, the composition is written on regular 6-line staves and no illustration is present. The rondeau explaining how to derive the third canonic voice is present below the music. The close interrelationship of the virelai's text, the harp illustration and the rondeau give evidence that the notation in Ch has been intended by Jacob Senleches as a synthesis of the arts. The Newberry version of La harpe de melodie appears on the front cover of Richard Hoppin's textbook Medieval Music (Norton, 1978), a frequently used text in American universities.

It shows the Incredulity of Thomas, frequently represented in Christian art since at least the 5th century and used to make a variety of theological points. Thomas the Apostle doubted the resurrection of Jesus and had to feel the wounds for himself in order to be convinced (John 20:24-29). The surrounding marble niche was designed by Donatello for his St Louis of Toulouse (1413), but the statue was moved to Santa Croce when the niche was sold to the Tribunale di Mercanzia (merchant's guild), who commissioned the Verrochio work.  Style  Closeup of the copy The work was the first narrative based work to appear at Orsanmichele. In its execution Verrocchio showed sophisticated knowledge of the style and substance of classical sculpture. The figures were cast without backs (i.e., not in the round) as they were only to be viewed from the front. This had the added benefits of saving on bronze (which was roughly ten times more expensive than marble), making the work lighter and easier to fit into the niche. The interaction between the characters of Christ and St Thomas show a strong sense of movement and dialogue. Differences between the mortal and the immortal are highlighted with Christ's passive, almost regal stance and the agitated and nervous disposition of the doubting St Thomas. The realism created by the artist is indicative of the period of art in which it was made, the Renaissance.  Mercanzia  Part of the remit of the Merchant's guild was to be a judicial, overseeing body. As such the theme of Christ and St Thomas would have been attractive to them as it concerned proof and the presentation of reliable evidence.  References  * Hartt, Frederick and Wilkins, David G.

Konecranes products are made for industries handling heavy loads meaning ports, intermodal terminals, shipyards and bulk material terminals. History The company was initially a division of the Finnish company Kone, which began to manufacture cranes and hoists in the 1930s, but was spun off as an independent company in 1994 when KONE underwent extensive restructuring. Early years with KONE, 1910-1994 Konecranes is a Corporate spin-off of Kone, which was founded in 1910. But it was not until in 1933 when KONE Corporation started to build sizeable electric overhead traveling cranes, mainly for the pulp and paper and power industry. Three years later it started to manufacture electric wire rope hoists. In 1947 the company started to make harbor cranes and in the post-war economy the harbor cranes business line experienced strong growth. In the 1960s KCI Konecranes signed the first preventive maintenance contract with a customer. In 1973 the company began to expand internationally and it bought the Norwegian company Wisbech-Refsum. In 1983 the company established R&M; Materials Handling in Ohio, which was its first foothold in the US, and in 1986 the company acquired Verlinde of France. The organization was changed in 1988 and the crane operations were organized then into the KONE Cranes Division of KONE Corporation. Lloyds British Testing (which had operations in the UK and Australia) was acquired in 1991 at which time the company started its first office in the UK. During the same year a large restructuring program was launched. Because of this, crane production facilities were cut from 19 to 4 by 1994. KCI Konecranes, 1994-2006 KCI Konecranes was formed on 15 April 1994, when KONE Corporation group made some radical changes before it was listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. KONE kept its elevator business and sold others, including the operations of its crane division. Two years later also KCI Konecranes was listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and has since that grown to become a constituent member of the benchmark OMX Helsinki 25 index. In 1997, KCI Konecranes expanded into Germany by acquiring German MAN SWF Krantechnik. Later KCI Konecranes experienced high organic growth in Germany, and in 2000 it made several bolt-on acquisitions. In 2002, KCI Konecranes made history in China: it was the first foreign crane company to receive a complete range of business licensees (including import and export). Also in Japan a milestone was achieved by establishing a joint venture agreement with Meidensha Corporation. After an acquisition of Swedish SMV Lifttrucks AB in 2004 reach stackers and lift trucks were added to the product range. A year later, KCI Konecranes acquired German R.STAHL AG's material handling division, R.Stahl F√∂rdertechnik and the following year MMH Holdings, Inc. Stig Gustavson was the company's first CEO from 1994 to 2005 and after which he continued as a chairman of the board. Konecranes, 2006-2009 The slogan of Konecranes: Lifting businesses The second CEO, Pekka Lundmark (2005‚Äì2015) joined KCI Konecranes in 2004, before that he had worked e.g. for Hackman and Nokia. In 2006 KCI Konecranes launched a new refocused and unified global master brand strategy and identity, and the \\"KCI\\" was dropped from the brand name and the slogan \\"Lifting Businesses‚Ñ¢\\" was introduced. In 2007 all rights to German straddle carrier manufacturer Consens Transport Systeme GmbH's products were acquired and straddle carrier manufacturing was started. Other acquisitions included Norwegian Kongsberg Automation AS and Swedish Reftele Maskinservice AB. In 2008 Konecranes produced about one in ten of the world's cranes, of which around 80% are for use in factories and the remainder at ports. Konecranes wanted to increase its presence in the Japanese hoist market, and so it raised its share holding in Meiden Hoist System Company Ltd (MHS) from 49 to 65 percent. It also wanted to expand its activities in Spain so it acquired crane, hoist and service companies Eydimen 2000 S.L. and Ausi√≥ Sistemas de Elevaci√≥n S.L. Other acquisitions of that year were made in Scandinavia and in the UK. In 2009 Konecranes entered a new business segment‚Äîaluminum rail systems and manipulators‚Äîwith two acquisitions. It also introduced an industrial crane, SMARTON¬Æ, which was said to be capable of reducing power consumption and energy cost by up to one third. Konecranes bought 65% of Sanma Crane manufacture Co. Ltd., one of the leading hoist and crane manufacturers in China. Konecranes, 2010-2014 In 2010 Konecranes announced six acquisitions related to Machine Tool Service (MTS) in Denmark, in the UK and in the USA. In 2011 Konecranes acquired WMI Cranes Ltd. (WMI) from India and Saudi Arabian crane manufacturer Saudi Cranes & Steel Works Factory Company Limited (‚ÄúSaudi Cranes‚Äù). It also won a contract worth of 80 million Euros to supply the Abu Dhabi Ports Company (ADPC) a container terminal operating system (TOS) and 30 automated stacking cranes (ASCs). In 2011 Georgia Ports Authority (GPA) ordered 20 RTG cranes and four Super Post Panamax STS (ship- to-shore) cranes for Port of Savannah. The new Cai Mep International Terminal (CMIT) in Vung Tau province of Vietnam ordered 6 port equipment in 2011. Konecranes set up an office in Vietnam. In 2012 Konecranes introduced a hybrid power option for its RTGs (Rubber tyred gantry crane). With the help of new hybrid (diesel/electric) power sources for RTGs, diesel consumption at ports can be reduced by over 60 percent. The first electrified rubber-tyred gantry cranes (ERTG) in the United States were unveiled by the Georgia Ports Authority (GPA) in December 2012. The new technology reduces fuel consumption by an estimated 95 percent. GPA developed the new ERTG system together with Konecranes, Conductix-Wampfler and Georgia Power. In October 2012 3 sixteen- wheeled RTGs were delivered to the Slovenian Luka Koper Container Terminal, which is the largest such terminal in the Northern Adriatic and which has more than ten machines from Konecranes in use. During the same year Konecranes won a tender to supply its CXT Wire Rope Hoists to CITIC Pacific‚Äôs Sino Iron project worth $5 billion. The project in Western Australia's Pilbara region is the largest magnetite iron ore mining and processing project in Australia. In 2013 Konecranes launched the world's first hybrid reach stacker for container handling. Its lifting capacity is 45 tons and it will cut fuel consumption by around 10 litres per hour. In March 2013 Konecranes launched a Remote Monitoring and Reporting tool, TRUCONNECT. It allows lift truck operators to track the usage, efficiency and productivity of their lift trucks through a remote connection. The data is transmitted wirelessly to the Konecranes Remote Data Center, where it is analysed and compiled in online views and reports, accessible 24/7 through a password-protected customer portal. In June 2013, Konecranes launched a new Automated RTG (ARTG) system. It copes with wide range of surface variations in RTG container yards. In November 2013, Konecranes developed an auto start-stop feature that turns off the lift truck engine when it idles for a period of time. This function helps reduce fuel consumption by 5-15% along with CO2 emissions. In 2013 Konecranes got a contract to deliver the first automated container yard for Indonesia state owned terminal operator, Indonesia Port Corporations, PT Pelabuhan Indonesia III (Pelindo III). The value of the order, which consists of 10 ship-to-shore (STS) cranes, 20 automated stacking cranes (ASC) and five straddle carriers (SC), is thought to be more than ‚Ç¨100M. In 2014 Konecranes completed a delivery of 20 stacking at Port Jersey in the Port of New York and New Jersey.http://www.konecranes.com/resources/media/releases/2012/konecranes-to- deliver-20-automated-stacking-cranes-to-global-terminal-in-usa  Konecranes, 2015-  In April 2015 CEO, Pekka Lundmark was nominated as the new CEO of Fortum. He was followed by Panu Routila who joined the company from Ahlstr√∂m Capital where he had been president and CEO since 2008. In August 2015, Konecranes announced merger with US based Material Handling solutions company Terex. The merger was treated as \\"Merger of Equals\\". However, in May 2016, Konecranes signed an agreement to acquire from Terex Corporation its Material Handling & Port Solutions segment against consideration consisting of cash and shares and to terminate the previously announced business combination agreement. The position of chairman of the board was changed in March 2016 when Stig Gustavson was followed by Christoph Vitzthum. In January 2017, Konecranes completed the acquisition of Terex Corporation's Material Handling and Port Solutions (MHPS) business. The consideration for the MHPS business was US$595M and ‚Ç¨200M (US$212M) and 19.6M new class B shares, which makes Terex a 25% shareholder in Konecranes. Based on 2015 financials, Konecranes and MHPS had aggregated sales of approximately ‚Ç¨3500M (US$3700M) and 19.000 employees. In September 2019 Konecranes announced it was refreshing some of its products in three new series of industrial cranes. The S-series crane, which is suitable for a number of industrial lifting needs, has replaced the traditional steel cable with synthetic rope. The C-series chain hoist and M-series crane were also introduced, with the latter focusing on heavy lifting needs in particular. In October 2019 Konecranes appointed Rob Smith as president and CEO. He is starting in the position in February 2020 and meanwhile the company's CFO and Deputy CEO, Teo Ottola, will act as the interim CEO. Smith was previously working at AGCO Corporation as Senior Vice President & General Manager, Europe and Middle East. The former president and CEO Panu Routila left the company on the same day. In December 2019, Konecranes said it would acquire the 50% stake in its MHE-Demag JV held by partner Jebsen & Jessen to improve its market position in Southeast Asia. The deal, worth around EUR 147 million, closed in January 2020. On October 1, 2020, Cargotec and Konecranes announced that they have agreed to a merger. The deal will require two thirds of the shareholders and is expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2021. Organization Konecranes SMARTON winch The president and CEO of Konecranes is Rob Smith, who started in February 2020 In May 2020 the Konecranes Leadership Team consisted of 8 members: Rob Smith (CEO), Fabio Fiorino, Timo Leskinen, Mika Mahlberg, Teo Ottola, Juha Pankakoski, Carolin Paulus and Sirpa Poitsalo. Konecranes has 16,000 employees at 600 locations in 50 countries. and it is arranged into three business areas: service, industrial equipment and port solutions. Port solutions Port Solutions business division offers port customers Konecranes Gottwald mobile harbour cranes, Konecranes Noell ship-to-shore (STS) and rubber-tyred gantry (RTG) cranes, horizontal transport for container terminals and Konecranes Liftace lift trucks as well as services.

IO involves The integrated employment, during military operations, of information-related capabilities in concert with other lines of operation to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp the decision-making of adversaries and potential adversaries while protecting our own. They apply across all phases of an operation, the range of military operations, and at every level of war. They are a critical factor in the joint force commander's capability to achieve and sustain the level of information superiority required for decisive joint operations. Located at Lackland AFB, Texas, the JIOWC's mission is to assist in planning, coordinating and executing information operations. The center deploys information operations planning teams worldwide at a moment's notice to deliver tailored, highly skilled support and sophisticated models and simulations to joint commanders, joint task forces and the Joint Staff. Direct support is provided to unified commands, joint task forces, functional and service components, and subordinate combat commanders. Support is also provided to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the services and other government agencies. The JIOWC has a balanced mixture of personnel from all four military services, the civil service and two allied nations.  History  The Joint Electronic Warfare Center (JEWC) was established by the Secretary of Defense in October 1980 and reported to the Joint Staff. In September 1994, the JEWC‚ÄôS mission was expanded and the organization was renamed the Joint Command and Control Warfare Center (JC2WC). In 1998, as a result of the Defense Reform Initiative (DRI), the JC2WC was realigned from the Joint Staff to US Atlantic Command. Further expansion of the JC2WC mission resulted in redesignation as the Joint Information Operations Center (JIOC). In October 1999, the JIOC was realigned as a subordinate command of USSPACECOM. In conjunction with the 1 October 2002 transition of USSPACECOM to USSTRATCOM, the JIOC was realigned as a subordinate command to USSTRATCOM. In 2006 the JIOC was redesignated the Joint Information Operations Warfare Command with a mission focused on operational IO planning and operations. From the establishment of the JEWC, the Commander of AFISRA also held the position of JIOWC director. In 2008, the AFISRA commander, Maj Gen Koziol realized that the AFISRA commander could not give the attention the JIOWC needed while also commanding AFISRA. As such, he proposed that the positions be severed and the JIOWC be led by a Senior Executive Service civilian. This occurred when Gen Koziol departed in February 2009 and the JIOWC changed from a command to a center. On 1 October 2011, the JIOWC was chartered as a Chairman's Controlled Activity aligned under the Joint Staff. The JIOWC Director reports to Joint Staff J3, through the Deputy Director Global Operations, J39 (DDGO). JIOWC support to the warfighter: JIOWC has provided direct support to CCMDs and Joint Force Commands and involvement in numerous operations since the early 80s: Operation URGENT FURY - Grenada (1983), Operation ELDORADO CANYON - Libya (1986), Operation JUST CAUSE - Panama (1989), Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM, Balkans (1992), Kosovo (1998), Operations NOBLE ANVIL - Yugoslavia (1999) and VALIANT RETURN - EP-3 (2001), ENDURING FREEDOM and NOBLE EAGLE, Operation ENDURING FREEDOM - Afghanistan (2001‚ÄìPresent), Operation ENDURING FREEDOM - Philippines (2002), Multi-Force Iraq (2003-2011), Indonesia Tsunami (2004), and Hurricane Katrina relief (2005), Haiti Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (2010). JIOWC led the creation of the Joint Publication 3-13 series (Information Operations Doctrine), provided IO exercise development and support evaluation, maintenance of OPSEC programs with assistance in programmatic setup, evaluation and training of forces. Additionally, JIOWC provides IO professionals with initial training by conducting the Joint Information Operations Orientation Course. Finally, JIOWC provides trans-regional, cross- AOR, SME support and Information Operations Intelligence Integration.

HILIC uses hydrophilic stationary phases with reversed-phase type eluents. The name was suggested by Dr. Andrew Alpert in his 1990 paper on the subject. He described the chromatographic mechanism for it as liquid-liquid partition chromatography where analytes elute in order of increasing polarity, a conclusion supported by a review and re-evaluation of published data. HILIC Partition Technique Useful Range Surface Any polar chromatographic surface can be used for HILIC separations. Even non-polar bonded silicas have been used with extremely high organic solvent composition, when the silica used for the chromatographic media was particularly polar. With that exception, HILIC phases can be grouped into five categories of neutral polar or ionic surfaces: *simple unbonded silica silanol or diol bonded phases *amino or anionic bonded phases *amide bonded phases *cationic bonded phases *zwitterionic bonded phases Mobile phase A typical mobile phase for HILIC chromatography includes acetonitrile (\\"MeCN\\", also designated as \\"ACN\\") with a small amount of water. However, any aprotic solvent miscible with water (e.g. THF or dioxane) can be used. Alcohols can also be used, however, their concentration must be higher to achieve the same degree of retention for an analyte relative to an aprotic solvent - water combination. See also Aqueous Normal Phase Chromatography It is commonly believed that in HILIC, the mobile phase forms a water-rich layer on the surface of the polar stationary phase vs. the water-deficient mobile phase, creating a liquid/liquid extraction system. The analyte is distributed between these two layers. However, HILIC is more than just simple partitioning and includes hydrogen donor interactions between neutral polar species as well as weak electrostatic mechanisms under the high organic solvent conditions used for retention. This distinguishes HILIC as a mechanism distinct from ion exchange chromatography. The more polar compounds will have a stronger interaction with the stationary aqueous layer than the less polar compounds. Thus, a separation based on a compound's polarity and degree of solvation takes place. Additives Ionic additives, such as ammonium acetate and ammonium formate, are usually used to control the mobile phase pH and ion strength. In HILIC they can also contribute to the polarity of the analyte, resulting in differential changes in retention. For extremely polar analytes (e.g. aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin) or Adenosine triphosphate), higher concentrations of buffer (ca. 100mM) are required to ensure that the analyte will be in a single ionic form. Otherwise, asymmetric peak shape, chromatographic tailing, and/or poor recovery from the stationary phase will be observed. For the separation of neutral polar analytes (e.g. carbohydrates), no buffer is necessary. Use of other salts such as 100-300mM sodium perchlorate, which are soluble in high-organic solvent mixtures (ca. 70%-90% acetonitrile), can be used to increase the mobile phase polarity to affect elution. These salts are not volatile, so this technique is less useful with a mass spectrometer as the detector. Usually a gradient (to increasing amounts of water) is enough to promote elution. All ions partition into the stationary phase to some degree, so an occasional \\"wash\\" with water is required to ensure a reproducible stationary phase. Applications The HILIC mode of separation is used extensively for separation of some biomolecules, organic and some inorganic molecules by differences in polarity. Its utility has increased due to the simplified sample preparation for biological samples, when analyzing for metabolites, since the metabolic process generally results in the addition of polar groups to enhance elimination from the cellular tissue. This separation technique is also particularly suitable for glycosylation analysis and quality assurance of glycoproteins and glycoforms in biologic medical products.Glycosylation analysis by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) ‚Äì N-Glyco mapping of the ZP-domain of murine TGFR-3 (Application Note TOSOH Biosciences). Retrieved May 23, 2013. For the detection of polar compounds with the use of electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry as a chromatographic detector, HILIC can offer a ten fold increase in sensitivity over reversed-phase chromatography because the organic solvent is much more volatile. Choice of pH With surface chemistries that are weakly ionic, the choice of pH can affect the ionic nature of the column chemistry. Properly adjusted, the pH can be set to reduce the selectivity toward functional groups with the same charge as the column, or enhance it for oppositely charged functional groups. Similarly, the choice of pH affects the polarity of the solutes. However, for column surface chemistries that are strongly ionic, and thus resistant to pH values in the mid-range of the pH scale (pH 3.5-8.5), these separations will be reflective of the polarity of the analytes alone, and thus might be easier to understand when doing methods development. ERLIC In 2008, Alpert coined the term, ERLIC (electrostatic repulsion hydrophilic interaction chromatography), for HILIC separations where an ionic column surface chemistry is used to repel a common ionic polar group on an analyte or within a set of analytes, to facilitate separation by the remaining polar groups. Electrostatic effects have an order of magnitude stronger chemical potential than neutral polar effects. This allows one to minimize the influence of a common, ionic group within a set of analyte molecules; or to reduce the degree of retention from these more polar functional groups, even enabling isocratic separations in lieu of a gradient in some situations. His subsequent publication further described orientation effects which others have also called ion-pair normal phase or e-HILIC, reflecting retention mechanisms sensitive to a particular ionic portion of the analyte, either attractive or repulsive. ERLIC (eHILIC) separations need not be isocratic, but the net effect is the reduction of the attraction of a particularly strong polar group, which then requires less strong elution conditions, and the enhanced interaction of the remaining polar (opposite charged ionic, or non-ionic) functional groups of the analyte(s). Cationic eHILIC For example, one could use a cation exchange (negatively charged) surface chemistry for ERLIC separations to reduce the influence on retention of anionic (negatively charged) groups (the phosphates of nucleotides or of phosphonyl antibiotic mixtures; or sialic acid groups of modified carbohydrates) to now allow separation based more on the basic and/or neutral functional groups of these molecules. Modifying the polarity of a weakly ionic group (e.g. carboxyl) on the surface is easily accomplished by adjusting the pH to be within two pH units of that group's pKa. For strongly ionic functional groups of the surface (i.e. sulfates or phosphates) one could instead use a lower amount of buffer so the residual charge is not completely ion paired. An example of this would be the use of a 12.5mM (rather than the recommended >20mM buffer), pH 9.2 mobile phase on a polymeric, zwitterionic, betaine-sulfonate surface to separate phosphonyl antibiotic mixtures (each containing a phosphate group). This enhances the influence of the column's sulfonic acid functional groups of its surface chemistry over its, slightly diminished (by pH), quaternary amine. Commensurate with this, these analytes will show a reduced retention on the column eluting earlier, and in higher amounts of organic solvent, than if a neutral polar HILIC surface were used. This also increases their detection sensitivity by negative ion mass spectrometry. Anionic eHILIC By analogy to the above, one can use an anion exchange (positively charged) column surface chemistry to reduce the influence on retention of cationic (positively charged) functional groups for a set of analytes, such as when selectively isolating phosphorylated peptides or sulfated polysaccharide molecules. Use of a pH between 1 and 2 pH units will reduce the polarity of two of the three ionizable oxygens of the phosphate group, and thus will allow easy desorption from the (oppositely charged) surface chemistry. It will also reduce the influence of negatively charged carboxyls in the analytes, since they will be protonated at this low a pH value, and thus contribute less overall polarity to the molecule. Any common, positively charged amino groups will be repelled from the column surface chemistry and thus these conditions enhance the role of the phosphate's polarity (as well as other neutral polar groups) in the separation.

A subsequent congressional ethics investigation \\"revealed that he used taxpayer money to fund lavish trips and events\\".Theodore Schleifer and Pamela Brown, Ex-congressman Aaron Schock indicted in spending scandal, CNN (November 10, 2016). In November 2016, a federal grand jury indicted him in connection with the scandal. After he pled not guilty, prosecutors reached a deferred prosecution agreement with him in March 2019 whereby all charges against him were dropped in return for period of good behavior and payment of $100,000 in restitution. As part of the deal, Schock‚Äôs campaign committee, Schock for Congress, also pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of failing to properly report expenses. Schock had a voting record of consistently opposing LGBTQ rights. He came out as gay in March 2020. Early life, education and career Schock was born in Morris, Minnesota, the youngest of the four children of Janice Marie (nee Joos),Minnesota Marriage Index, \\"Janice M Joos to Richard F Schock\\" 1971 a homemaker, and Richard Schock, a family practice physician and former school board member. During his early years, the family lived on a rural farm site where the children were given the responsibility of tending a three-acre patch of strawberries and selling the fruit. When he was in fourth grade, his family moved to Peoria. In 1995, he was elected to the executive board of the Illinois Association of Junior High Student Councils. Schock attended Richwoods High School. By his junior year of high school, he had completed nearly all of his graduation requirements, and had few course options available because the school district had recently discontinued most of the Advanced Placement and other advanced courses due to budget cuts. School district policy did not allow him to graduate early, and the board members refused his requests to change the policy. He began attending classes at Illinois Central College in East Peoria, earning dual credits toward high school and college graduation. He graduated from high school in 2000. Schock received his Bachelor of Science degree from Bradley University in 2002, with a major in finance. Schock sold his Garage Tek franchise in 2004 before running for state representative. Peoria Board of Education Schock decided to run for the Peoria Board of Education a few months after graduating from high school because he felt the board needed a more diverse and youthful perspective.

In the November 2004 general election, he defeated four-term incumbent Democrat Ricca Slone, by just 235 votes out of 40,000 ballots cast, and became the youngest member of the Illinois General Assembly in state history. Five months after taking the office, he resigned from the school board to focus on his job as a state legislator. When Schock ran for reelection in 2006, he defeated Democrat Bill Spears, winning 58 percent of the total vote. He received more than 40 percent of the African-American vote in his district, despite his opposition to race-based affirmative action. During his four years in the state legislature, Schock served on two appropriations committees that were \\"typically reserved for more senior lawmakers\\", as well as the Financial Institutions, Environment & Energy and Veteran's Affairs committees. Schock was the chief sponsor of 38 bills, of which 13 became law. The bills dealt with education, child protection, prescription drug savings, veterans' assistance, road construction and high- tech identity theft. Another bill, co-sponsored with Democrat Dave Koehler, expanded the taxation area for the Peoria Airport. During his time in the state legislature, Schock was involved with Youth for a Cause, Peoria Mayor's Vision 2020, the Peoria Chamber of Commerce, Heart of Illinois Kids Count, St. Jude Telethon V.I.P. and medical mission trips to Mexico and Jamaica. During his second term as state representative, Schock worked as Director of Development and Construction for Petersen Companies of Peoria, U.S. House of Representatives Schock visiting the Illinois River with Bob Walters, mayor of Beardstown, Illinois, in 2009 Elections Schock speaking at a press conference 2008 In his speech announcing his candidacy for Illinois's 18th congressional district, to succeed retiring incumbent Republican congressman Ray LaHood, Schock said, \\"If China continues to be irresponsible about nuclear proliferation in Iran, we should tell them that ... we will sell Pershing nuclear missiles to Taiwan for their defense. Nonproliferation will either be enforced universally or not at all ‚Äì it is their choice. The Chinese will come around, I have no doubt.\\" His campaign manager described the policy as \\"well thought out\\" and Schock first defended the remarks, but Schock later said it was \\"more in jest\\" and that he had made a mistake. Schock easily won the Republican primary in February 2008, with 72% of the vote, beating his opponents Jim McConoughey (16%) and John Morris (12%). Schock visiting students at Whittier Elementary School in Peoria, Illinois Schock drew mixed reaction in late July 2008 when he brought President George W. Bush to Peoria to raise money for the congressional campaign. The city of Peoria provided 38 police officers, 30 city trucks for temporary security barriers, and a number of firefighters, spending $38,252 to facilitate the visit, even though it was a private, paid-admission fundraiser. When requests to compensate the city increased, Schock called it \\"obviously a political move\\" and compared the issue to Barack Obama's endorsement of another state senator on the courthouse steps a few years before, for which the city did not request compensation. A city councilman cited an ordinance against political activity by the city, but the mayor of Peoria, Jim Ardis, called the requests \\"political rhetoric\\" and said the ordinance did not apply, and that the city did not have a policy addressing a situation where a sitting president visits town. Schock later said he would reimburse the city voluntarily, referring to payment for presidential protection as \\"unprecedented\\", and saying he believed his campaign was the first in the state and possibly the nation to repay a city for protective services provided to a president. Schock spoke at the 2008 Republican National Convention. Prior to the general election, Schock was endorsed by 116 mayors across the district and the Illinois Farm Bureau. Schock's hometown newspaper, the Journal Star, endorsed Schock \\"on the basis of his potential.\\" In October 2008, Schock's father testified in a federal court that his son had notarized documents with false dates (a Class A misdemeanor under the Illinois Notary Public Act) while helping his parents establish tax shelters. Schock won the November 4, 2008 general election with 59% of the vote, defeating Democratic candidate Colleen Callahan and Green Party candidate Sheldon Schafer. He was only the fifth person to serve the district since 1933. Upon taking his seat in Congress, at the age of 27, he became the youngest member of Congress, supplanting 33-year-old Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina, and the first member of the United States Congress born in the 1980s. In the November 2008 election, Democrat Jehan A. Gordon won Schock's 92nd Representative District seat in the Illinois House of Representatives. 2010 In November 2010, Schock was challenged by Democrat D.K. Hirner, the Executive Director of the Illinois Environmental Regulatory Group and the Green Party nominee Sheldon Schafer. The Journal Star again endorsed Schock, writing, \\"Schock is a more self-assured, well-rounded candidate than he was two years ago.\\" The endorsement noted that Schock had \\"voted with President Barack Obama more than a third of the time, breaking with GOP leaders on multiple issues, from his support for renewable energy to taming predatory lenders to FDA regulation of tobacco.\\" Schock won with 59% of the vote. 2012 For 2012, it appeared that Schock would face Darrel Miller in the Republican primary, but Miller was removed from the ballot in February 2012 due to problems with his petition signatures. In the general election, Schock faced Democrat Steve Waterworth. Redistricting made Schock's district much safer. Most of the more Democratic portions of Peoria were cut out, replaced with Republican-leaning Quincy and Bloomington. On paper, the new 18th was now the second-most Republican district in Illinois; had the district existed in 2008, John McCain would have carried it with 60.7 percent of the vote.Daily Kos Elections database of presidential results by congressional district By comparison, McCain had carried the old 18th with just over 50 percent of the vote. In April 2012, watchdog groups filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, claiming that Schock violated federal campaign rules when he solicited a $25,000 donation from House Majority Leader Eric Cantor for use in a Republican primary. Schock's campaign stated that it believed the FEC would dismiss the complaint after review. In December 2012, the House Committee on Ethics confirmed that the same matter had been referred to it by the Office of Congressional Ethics. In February 2013, the Office of Congressional Ethics' report was publicly released, which stated, \\"there is substantial reason to believe that Rep. Schock violated federal law, House rules and standards of conduct.\\" At the time of the release, Schock's communications director released a statement saying: \\"The release by the Ethics Committee of this report from the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) is just one more step in the long process of adjudicating ethics complaints that can be submitted by anyone for any reason...We remain firmly convinced that Congressman Schock will be exonerated when the Ethics Committee examines the complaint and in due course resolves this matter.\\" Questions have also been raised about a real estate transaction that occurred the month before the 2012 elections. Schock sold his Peoria home to a major Republican donor, who was also one of his campaign supporters, for a price that appeared to far exceed its then market value, and reported as three times its worth. This led to another ethics complaint being filed against Schock by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Schock was endorsed by the editorial board of The State Journal- Register, who wrote that Schock \\"has grown in his two terms in the House, building expertise on budget, trade, transportation and agriculture issues and reaching across the aisle at times to build a solid record.\\" Schock was also endorsed by the Journal Star and the Chicago Tribune. Schock defeated Waterworth to win reelection on November 6, 2012, winning 74% of the vote. 2014 After the 2012 election, there was speculation about Schock's ambitions for higher political office, including a Roll Call article noting that Schock's new district in central Illinois had been drawn, during redistricting after the 2010 census, to be very safe, leading to suggestions that Democrats were trying to keep him happy in the House and away from any statewide bid. An Illinois Republican was quoted as saying, \\"I think he would be the top candidate on the Republican side if Dick Durbin retired or if he wanted to run for governor ... His ability to fundraise and be popular with conservatives without coming across as an ideologue would suit him well if he chooses to run.\\" In November 2012, it was reported that Schock had met with officials at the Republican Governors Association to explore the possibility of running for Governor of Illinois in 2014. However, in April 2013, Schock announced that he would not be running for governor, and would instead be seeking election to a fourth term in Congress. Schock won the November 2014 general election with 75% of the vote, defeating Democrat Darrel Miller. Legislation Two weeks after taking office in 2009, Schock proposed an amendment, which passed, to the Troubled Asset Relief Program Accountability Act, to create a searchable website so Americans could see where bailout funds were being spent. The act's sponsor, Democrat Barney Frank, said \\"this is a very thoughtful amendment and it will greatly enhance things.\\" In February 2009, President Barack Obama invited Schock to fly with him on Air Force One for a visit to a Caterpillar plant in East Peoria, Illinois. During the visit, Obama appealed to Schock to support the $787 billion stimulus bill which was up for a vote the next day in Congress, but Schock ultimately voted against the legislation. During his first year in Congress, Schock passed more legislation than any other Republican freshman. In 2010 he secured $40.7 million in funding for Illinois. On February 28, 2013, Schock reintroduced the New Philadelphia, Illinois, Study Act, a bill that would instruct the United States Department of the Interior to study the New Philadelphia archaeological site in Illinois to evaluate the national significance of the area and to determine the feasibility of designating the site as a unit of the National Park System. Schock had previously introduced similar legislation in the 111th United States Congress (). Schock and Rep. William R. Keating jointly introduced the Equitable Access to Care and Health Act on April 29, 2013. The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to minimum essential health care coverage requirements added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to allow an additional religious exemption from such requirements for individuals whose sincerely held religious beliefs would cause them to object to medical health care provided under such coverage. Individuals could file an affidavit to get this exemption, but would lose the exemption if they went on to later use healthcare. Schock and Keating wrote a letter in support of their bill saying, \\"we believe the EACH Act balances a respect for religious diversity against the need to prevent fraud and abuse.\\" In December 2013, Schock was selected by House Speaker John Boehner to lead the congressional delegation to the Funeral of Nelson Mandela. Schock was the only current Republican House of Representatives member in the delegation and only other seated Republican Congressman other than Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Political positions Schock was considered to be more conservative than his two moderate predecessors, Congressmen Bob Michel and Ray LaHood. The Chicago Tribune, in their endorsements for the 2008 general election, described Schock's political positions to be fiscally conservative and somewhat moderate on social issues. Nevertheless, he has said he would have supported the financial bailout plan, or the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, that passed Congress in October 2008 and he did not support the repeal of \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" in 2010. Schock is a former member of the Republican Study Committee and the Republican Main Street Partnership. Schock has said \\"our strategy with young people needs to be economic issues\\", and that social issues are \\"not what compelled me to run for office.\\" In their 2010 endorsement of Schock, the Journal Star wrote, \\"We've not always seen eye to eye with Schock, but he has been far more influential than your average freshman. He's a hard worker, a rising star in the Republican Party...We have long valued independence in our congressmen; Aaron Schock is a conservative, but he also has a mind of his own, and he is endorsed.\\" Schock endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, and he appeared with Romney at campaign events. Economy Schock voted against the $787 billion stimulus plan in February 2009. He also voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010. He has advocated for tort reform and interstate health insurance competition as ways to reduce health care costs. Schock has introduced legislation that would create the Federal Program Sunset Commission (H.R. 606). His proposed legislation would create a bipartisan commission made up of former members of Congress and outside experts to abolish federal programs that are found to be unnecessary or under- performing. During the debate on the short-term Continuing Resolution that passed the House on February 19, 2011, Schock was successful in banning further funding for the creation of stimulus signs that highlight stimulus- related projects around the country. In July 2010, Schock's bill was selected as a winning proposal in a public outreach effort designed by House Republicans to highlight proposals aimed at reducing government spending. In February 2011, Schock was one of 23 Republicans who voted against an amendment that proposed cutting funding to the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2011, Schock and Delaware Democrat John Carney co-sponsored a bill that would use U.S. oil exploration to help fund a five-year federal highway construction project. The bill had not been voted on as of April 2012. Schock has signed the Americans for Tax Reform Taxpayer Protection Pledge, promising not to vote for any new taxes. Schock was a supporter of free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea, which passed the House in fall 2011. In September 2011, Schock and Democrat Leonard Boswell introduced the Help Veterans Own Franchises Act, which would allow tax credits for the establishment of franchises owned by veterans. As of April 2012, the bill was in committee. Energy and environment In 2009, Schock voted to secure $23 million for restoration and conservation of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers. In April 2010, Biofuels Digest named Congressman Aaron Schock as #8 in the top ten groups of individuals that \\"make it happen for renewables, bioenergy in DC.\\" Schock, who says energy is the issue that people most want to talk about, supports eliminating federal taxes on the production of renewable energy. In March 2011, Schock signed on as an original co-sponsor to a proposal by Republican Congressman Devin Nunes of California called \\"A Roadmap for America's Energy future\\" (H.R. 909), a comprehensive plan focusing on policies that promote the production of a broad range of domestic energy supplies including traditional resources as well as renewable and alternative energy sources. Foreign policy Schock has been an opponent of using federal funds for the transfer of detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to elsewhere in the U.S. In January 2011, Schock introduced legislation with Senator Mark Kirk to deny federal funds for the transfer of detainees to the United States. Similarly, he has fought to require military tribunals, as opposed to civilian courts, for detainee trials. In August 2009, the Law Library of Congress issued a controversial and disputed legal opinion, Honduras: Constitutional Law Issues, that had been commissioned by Schock. It featured a legal analysis of the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis with a specific examination of the legality of Honduran President Manuel Zelaya's June 28, 2009, removal from office and expatriation. After the report was issued, Schock argued that the Obama Administration should change its policy towards Honduras by resuming suspended aid and recognizing the upcoming Honduran November 29, 2009, elections, based on the contents of the report. After visiting the country twice, Schock created the congressional Colombia Caucus. On December 15, 2009, during a discussion on Hardball with Chris Matthews, Schock stated \\"I don‚Äòt believe we should ‚Äì we should limit water- boarding or, quite frankly, any other alternative torture technique if it means saving Americans‚Äò lives\\" in a \\"ticking time bomb\\" scenario or other critical situation. He added that he didn't believe such techniques \\"should be standard practice.\\" Social issues Schock received a zero percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group and political lobbying organization. Schock voted against amending federal hate crimes laws to include crimes where the victims were targeted on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender and disability. He voted against the repeal of the military's \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" in December 2010. Schock also voted against the Employment Discrimination Law Amendment H.R. 11 and H.R. 12, which were eventually passed on January 9, 2009. Schock voted for House Amendment 1416, which Prohibits Use of Funds in Contravention of the Defense of Marriage Act, adopted 247 to 166 in the House July 19, 2012. Schock is pro- life and has voted to prohibit federal funding for the procedure with House Amendment 95. In addition, Schock voted to pass H.R. 3 \\"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\\". Schock voted against the DREAM Act. However, TheHill.com reported that Schock was \\"slammed\\" for calling illegal immigrants \\"undocumented citizens\\" and for showing support for a legalization program at a town hall event. Schock voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act. After this was done for the 56th time in 2015 without any replacement, the Peoria Journal Star stated: \\"The Affordable Care Act has its flaws, but its congressional detractors, Schock among them, have made it darn hard to conclude they are serious about governing.\\" Taxes Schock, along with Senator Marco Rubio, introduced a bill in 2013 known as the Higher Education and Skills Obtainment Act. The bill would narrow the eligibility for people to use certain tax credits related to higher education. To do so, the legislation would take away eligibility for those tax credits from people who aren't students or who \\"did not attend an eligible institution\\", according to Ripon Advance.Julie Harrison, \\"Tax Foundation gives Schock, Rubio higher education bill thumbs up\\", The Ripon Advance, March 9, 2013; retrieved April 9, 2013. Civil liberties Schock voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. Committee assignments *Committee on Ways and Means ** Subcommittee on Trade ** Subcommittee on Oversight *Committee on House Administration ** Subcommittee on Elections ** Subcommittee on Oversight During his first term, Schock requested and was given three committee assignments. In addition, he was appointed by Minority Whip Eric Cantor to be a deputy minority whip. He served as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Contracting and Technology of the Small Business Committee. Soon after being sworn in to serve his first term, he joined the Republican Study Committee, \\"a home for deficit hawks\\", according to the Los Angeles Times. As of April 2012, he is no longer a member of the Republican Study Committee. Schock was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a group of moderate Republicans who advocate reducing the deficit, cutting taxes, and focusing on education and environmental issues. At the beginning of his second term in 2011, Schock was appointed to the Ways and Means Committee. On the committee he served on the Subcommittee on Trade, Subcommittee on Social Security and Subcommittee on Oversight. The Subcommittee on Trade has oversight over reciprocal trade agreements including multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations and implementation of agreements involving tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. Misappropriation of funds charges Resignation In February 2015, The Washington Post reported that Schock's congressional offices had been lavishly redecorated in a style inspired by the aristocratic homes in the television show Downton Abbey. In response to that story, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaint alleging Schock could have received an improper gift. CREW's executive director, Anne Weismann, stated, \\"Again and again, Rep. Schock's seeming obsession with his image impedes his ability to conduct himself in [an] ethical manner.\\" Schock dismissed the criticism with the statement \\"Haters gonna hate\\", which was in turn criticized for its apparent flippancy. Schock later stated he intended to pay the decorator. Another investigation had discovered he had spent campaign money on workout DVDs. Further media scrutiny of congressional expenditure reports showed that Schock had spent over $100,000 in government funds on office decorating and renovations between January 2009 and late 2014, mostly during his first term. Other media reported Schock had charged thousands of dollars for private flights, legal expenses, new cars, tickets to the Super Bowl and Country Music Awards, as well as cufflinks, massage, \\"gold equipment\\" and cigars to his government-funded office account. The Associated Press accessed the location metadata on Schock's Instagram photos and correlated it with private flight records to identify flights that did not correspond to his campaign finance disclosures. In response, Schock's office stated it had begun an internal review of the reimbursements. In March 2015 there were further reports of spending and disclosure irregularities, including that Schock had accepted money from an outside group, the Global Poverty Project, to cover the cost of bringing a photographer on an all-expenses-paid trip to India organized to discuss sanitation and access to clean water. The Associated Press also reported that much of Schock's personal wealth had been built with the assistance of political donors. Conservative commentators began calling for Schock's replacement. National Review called him \\"a crook\\" and stated: \\"Politics shouldn't be a ticket to a celebrity lifestyle on the public's dime. For a man who has enjoyed such a short and undistinguished career, Illinois's Representative Aaron Schock (R) has sure packed in a lot of corruption.\\" On March 16, Politico reported that Schock had requested the federal government and his campaign reimburse him for a total of 170,000 miles that were driven on his personal car, a Chevrolet Tahoe, between January 2010 and July 2014. But when he transferred that car back to the dealer in July 2014, he signed documents saying it had only been driven 80,000 miles. A subsequent investigation by the Chicago Sun-Times of reimbursements on Schock's previous vehicle, a GMC Envoy, revealed a similar discrepancy. He bought the Envoy in 2007 while still in the state house. The Envoy had 24,300 miles on its odometer when he bought it. When he sold it in 2009, he'd put an additional 53,100 miles on it in a little over two years. However, during 2009 he billed the federal government and his campaign for a total of 42,300 miles. On March 17, 2015, Schock announced his resignation from Congress, effective March 31, 2015. The resignation came less than 12 hours after the Politico report about the questionable reimbursements went online. On the day he announced his resignation, his spokesman said that Schock had refunded all reimbursements he had received for mileage on his car. By resigning, he avoided an impending congressional ethics inquiry. On March 20, the Chicago Tribune reported that federal investigators had opened a \\"preliminary investigation\\" into the activities of Schock. In October 2016, Schock agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty to the Federal Election Commission for having asked Rep. Eric Cantor to contribute $25,000 to pay for advertisements for Rep. Adam Kinzinger. Prosecution On November 10, 2016, the United States Attorney for the Central District of Illinois announced that a federal grand jury had indicted Schock on 24 criminal counts including theft of government funds, fraud, making false statements and filing false tax returns. The charges arose in connection with the spending scandal. Schock pleaded not guilty to all charges when arraigned on December 12, 2016. A trial date was set for July 11, 2017.Trial Date Set for Former Illinois Congressman Aaron Schock, NBC Chicago (January 18, 2017). In March 2017, Schock's attorneys, led by George J. Terwilliger III of McGuire Woods, filed public documents criticizing activities of an FBI confidential informant, a former Schock staffer enlisted after Schock's indictment. On May 19, 2017, Judge Colin S. Bruce set a new trial date for January 22, 2018, but the trial was delayed again in November 2017. On October 23, 2017, Judge Bruce dismissed two of the 24 counts against Schock, but denied Schock's motion to dismiss the entire indictment. On May 30, 2018, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's denial of Schock's motion to dismiss the entire indictment and dismissed his appeal.U.S. v. Schock. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. 30 May 2015. On June 26, 2018, Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Bass was removed from the Schock case, and that was followed, in mid-August 2018, by Judge Bruce being bumped from all of his criminal cases for commenting in emails about an unrelated trial he was overseeing, thus causing the U.S. Department of Justice to transfer the case to United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois Matthew Kennelly who, on August 30, 2018, was informed by U.S. Attorney for the Central District of Illinois John Childress that the Justice Department was replacing the prosecutors overseeing the Schock case, that were not named, other than Childress noting that the new prosecution team would be from outside of the Central District of Illinois. In March 2019 prosecutors reached an agreement with Schock suspending the case for six months and requiring him to be under court supervision. If he stayed out of legal troubles all charges against him would be dropped in six months in exchange for him paying $42,000 to the IRS and $68,000 to his congressional campaign fund. As part of the deal, Schock‚Äôs campaign committee, Schock for Congress, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of failing to properly report expenses. The six months probationary period ended in September 2019, and all charges against Schock were dropped. Media coverage According to The New York Times, Schock has \\"cultivated an image that is more about lifestyle and less about lawmaking.\\" Schock was selected \\"hottest freshman\\" congressman in a February 2009 reader poll on The Huffington Post. Schock had been frequently targeted by TMZ.com reporters since his arrival in Washington. Schock told CNN's Reliable Sources that such soft media coverage could increase voters' interest in politics. \\"People who watch TMZ or different mediums don't expect to see their congressman on such a show\\", he said. \\"To see their hometown congressman on a show like this kind of raises their interest and gets them a little excited.\\" Aaron Schock Defends TMZ Appearances, Abs On \\"Reliable Sources\\". The Huffington Post. March 23, 2009. In 2009, Schock appeared on The Colbert Report, during which the host, Stephen Colbert ‚Äì making fun of the TMZ reports ‚Äì \\"grilled\\" Schock about his \\"six-pack abs\\". Schock went on to appear on the cover of the June 2011 issue of Men's Health, which one commentator decried as evidence of \\"a narcissism that never rests\\". Schock appeared on Season 7 (2010) of Top Chef, a competition reality-television program, as a guest judge. In 2012, Schock told Roll Call that \\"I'm a big believer if you want to change people's minds or get someone to vote for you, either a voter or a colleague, you've got to first get their attention. If people don't know who you are, they're not going to listen to your message. And not everybody pays attention to politicians by watching Fox News and CNN.\\" In May 2013, Schock was nominated for and included in a Time magazine poll titled \\"Who's the Most Influential Millennial?\\" Sexuality Since 2004, media outlets have questioned Schock's sexual orientation in relation to his socially conservative voting record. In an interview with Details in 2009, Schock said that he was not gay. In January 2014, journalist Itay Hod made a post on his personal Facebook page accusing a Republican congressman from Illinois of voting against gay rights, while showering with his male roommate and visiting gay bars. The New York Times stated that the post \\"might be described as the world's most obvious blind item\\", and media outlets considered the post to be an outing of Schock. In April 2019, Schock was photographed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival with several gay men, and a video was publicized that showed Schock kissing and fondling another man at the same event. In June 2019, a video was released showing Schock tipping a male go-go dancer at a gay bar in Zona Rosa, Mexico City. In October 2019, Schock was seen and photographed at a dance party for gay men in Los Angeles. Schock's actions drew condemnation from gay rights activists due to his past political stances and votes on gay issues. Schock came out as gay in an Instagram post on March 5, 2020, as well as in a statement posted on his website.

Gordon (1835‚Äì1888) was an anti-union guerrilla who indirectly caused Platte City, Missouri, to be burned twice by forces during the American Civil War. The town of Gordonville, Texas, is named for him. Confederate Silas \\"Si\\" Gordon was born in Montgomery County, Kentucky in 1835 and moved with his parents, William and Lucretia (Muir) Gordon, to Platte County, Missouri. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Gordon engaged in various guerrilla actions, including kidnapping Union officers in Missouri. He was accused of masterminding the September 3 Platte Bridge Railroad Tragedy in which a Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad train derailed on a sabotaged Platte River bridge at St. Joseph, Missouri. Gordon and 30 to 40 of his followers set up camp in November 1861 by the Platte County Courthouse in Platte City. He was to engage Federal troops in November at Bee Creek, in which two Federals were killed. In December his band briefly captured Weston, Missouri. Gordon stole county records from the courthouse and threatened to kill the district judge if he came to Platte City. Union General David Hunter issued an order from neighboring Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, to the Platte County trustees to either deliver Gordon within 10 days or have the city burned and the slaves in the county freed. In early December Col. James Morgan marched from St. Joseph to Platte City and set fire to the city and courthouse and captured three of Gordon's men on December 16 during the Burning of Platte City. On December 17 Morgan ignored the pleas for leniency from the father of one of the prisoners, a man named Black Triplett. Instead, Morgan took Triplett and prisoner Gabriel Close to the Bee Creek site where the Federals had been killed. Triplett was executed outright and Close was bayonetted as he fled. The letters \\"U.S.\\" were scrawled in Triplett's blood on the Bee Creek bridge. Gordon joined the Missouri State Guard under Sterling Price and was in the Battle of Pea Ridge, Battle of Iuka, Second Battle of Corinth, and Battle of Vicksburg. He was reported to have joined guerrilla fighter William Quantrill and Quantrill's Raiders in Texas. He returned to guerrilla activities in Missouri in 1864 around Platte County. In July 1864, Union troops once again burned the city in an attempt to capture him (the courthouse was not to be rebuilt from the first fire until 1867). Gordon returned to Texas in Gordonville until his death in 1888.

In his dedication Green said he had not written \\"this little story\\" to encourage \\"adultery, the use of pyjama tops, or registry office weddings. Nor is it meant to discourage gambling\\". Plot summary Mr. Bertram and Cary are about to get married. An unambitious assistant accountant, Bertram's plans for marriage are not particularly exciting. One day, he comes to the attention of Dreuther, the powerful director of his company, who changes Bertram's plan for him: they are to wed and honeymoon in Monte Carlo. Dreuther will meet the couple in Monte Carlo and be their witness, on board his private yacht. Bertram and Cary arrive in Monte Carlo but Dreuther does not show up. The couple are therefore forced to stay there. Bertram is angry with Dreuther. In order to make sure they can pay the hotel bills, Bertram visits the casino. At first he loses, but gradually his system starts working, and he begins to win big money. He wins so much money that he gets the attention of Mr. Bowles, another director of the company gambling in Monte Carlo, who is also a rival of Dreuther. Bowles wants Bertram to lend him money. In exchange, Bertram wants Bowles' shares of the company, so that, in gaining control of the company, he will get his revenge on Dreuther. Meanwhile, Cary is disappointed that Bertram becomes obsessed with his system. A romantic person, she does not want him to become rich. At this time, she meets a \\"hungry\\" young man who expresses his love for her. She decides to leave Bertram. Devastated, Bertram does not know what to do. He blames Dreuther for ruining his marriage. Just at this time, Dreuther arrives on his yacht. He explains that his no-show is not deliberate: he is only forgetful. Bertram, while still doubting Dreuther's sincerity, tells him about his trouble. The wise and well-meaning Dreuther then devises a plan that would help Bertram get Cary back. The plan works perfectly. With Cary coming back to him, Bertram is happy even though he loses all his money to Bowles (thereby cancelling his deal with him) and the hungry young man. Hence, it is \\"loser takes all\\". Film adaptations A film based on the novella was made in 1956, starring Rossano Brazzi and Glynis Johns. A remake starring Robert Lindsay and Molly Ringwald was shot in 1990 and directed by James Scott. It was later re-cut and retitled as Strike It Rich by Harvey Weinstein.

(2016): Re-description of the rare taillight shark Euprotomicroides zantedeschia (Squaliformes, Dalatiidae), based on third and fourth record from off Chile. Cybium, 40 (3): 187-197. It is known from only four specimens collected from deep oceanic waters in the southern Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean. A small shark with a laterally compressed body and a bulbous snout, this species has unusual adaptations that indicate a specialized lifestyle: its pectoral fins are paddle-like and may be used for propulsion, unlike other sharks and it has a pouch-like gland on its abdomen that emits clouds of luminescent blue fluid. This shark is likely aplacental viviparous and a formidable predator for its size. The International Union for Conservation of Nature presently lacks sufficient data to assess its conservation status. Taxonomy and phylogeny The first specimen of the taillight shark was collected by the Cape Town trawler Arum in 1963 and was initially identified as a longnose pygmy shark before being recognized as a hitherto unknown species. The genus name Euprotomicroides comes from this shark's resemblance to the pygmy shark. The specific epithet zantedeschia is derived from Zantedeschia aethiopica, a species of arum lily for which the trawler Arum was named.Hulley, P.A. & Penrith, M.J. (1966): Euprotomicroides zantedeschia, a new genus and species of pigmy dalatiid shark from South Africa. Bulletin of Marine Science, 16 (2): 222-229. Phylogenetic analysis based on dentition indicates that the taillight shark is the most basal member of its family and is sister to the clade containing all other dalatiid species. Although no definitive fossil remains have been found, the taillight shark may have evolved in the early Paleocene epoch (65.5-55.8 million years ago - Mya), as part of a larger adaptive radiation of dogfish sharks into midwater habitats. The teeth of the extinct shark Paraphorosoides ursulae, found in early Campanian (83.5-70.6 Mya) deposits in Germany, closely resemble those of the taillight shark.Adnet, S. & Cappetta, H. (2001): A palaeontological and phylogenetical analysis of squaliform sharks (Chondrichthyes: Squaliformes) based on dental characters. Lethaia, 34 (3): 234-248. Distribution and habitat The four specimens of the taillight shark were caught off South Africa in a trawl operating at a depth of , off Uruguay in a trawl operating at a depth of and off Chile, near Juan Fernandez Islands. These records suggest this shark is an inhabitant of the open ocean. However, whether the known specimens were captured near the sea bottom where the trawls operated or from midwater as the nets were being retrieved is unclear. Description The taillight shark is laterally compressed, with a long rounded snout and large oval eyes. The mouth is large, containing 29 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 34 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The upper teeth are small and needle-like, while the lower teeth are large and triangular, with their bases interlocking to form a continuous cutting surface. The lips are thick and fringed, though not modified to be suctorial. The five pairs of gill slits are large and increase in size from the first to the last. The two dorsal fins are rounded and lack spines; the first is smaller than the second and located about halfway between the pectoral and pelvic fins. The pectoral fins are enlarged into rounded paddles. The pelvic fins are small and originate at the level of the second dorsal fin; the anal fin is absent. The caudal fin has a strong lower lobe and a long upper lobe with a prominent notch near the tip. The body is covered by small, non- overlapping dermal denticles; each denticle has radial ridges converging to a round central pit. The body is dark brown above and black below, with light margins on the fins. Small, light-emitting photophores are scattered over the body. The first specimen was an immature female (originally reported incorrectly as a mature male) long, the second was a mature male long, the third was also a mature male long and the fourth specimen was a mature female . Biology and ecology The muscular, lobe-like pectoral fins of the taillight shark suggest they may be used for propulsion, in a manner more akin to that of chimaeras than other sharks or at least for hovering in the water column. Its strongly built jaws and teeth likely allow it to tackle relatively large prey. On the belly in front of the cloaca is a pouch-like groove devoid of denticles and lined with a luminescent tissue formed into numerous, tightly packed papillae (nipple-like structures). The entrance to the pouch is a slit lined with folds of skin. In life, the pouch emits a glowing blue fluid of unknown function.Munk, O. & J√∏rgensen, J.M. (1988): Putatively luminous tissue in the abdominal pouch of a male dalatiine shark, Euprotomicroides zantedeschia Hulley & Penrith, 1966. Acta Zoologica, 69 (4): 247-251.

Actually, she was a prisoner who posed to illustrate a story about the Rose of the Cimarron. Rose Elizabeth Dunn (September 5, 1878 ‚Äì June 11, 1955) also known as Rose of Cimarron and later Rose of the Cimarron, was best known for her good looks and for her romantic involvement with outlaw George \\"Bittercreek\\" Newcomb when she was a teenager during the closing years of the Old West. Early life Rose Dunn was born near Ingalls, Oklahoma. Her family was poor, but she received a formal education at a convent in Wichita, Kansas. Dunn's two older brothers became minor outlaws by the time she was 12. She learned to ride, rope and shoot from her brothers. Through them, she met and became involved romantically with George Newcomb circa 1893, when she was either 14 or 15 years of age. George \\"Bittercreek\\" Newcomb Dunn met and became involved romantically with George \\"Bittercreek\\" Newcomb around 1893. The gang that Newcomb ran with worshipped her due to her good looks and her calm and kind demeanor, and were fiercely defensive of her, spawning her loyalty to them. She was completely infatuated with Newcomb and began supporting Newcomb's outlaw life by venturing into town for supplies, as he was a wanted man and could not. Newcomb by that time was riding with the Wild Bunch gang led by famous outlaw Bill Doolin. Her brothers, however, had left the outlaw life and had become well-known bounty hunters, calling themselves the Dunn Brothers. On September 1, 1893, the gang was cornered in Ingalls by a posse of US marshals, in what became known as the Battle of Ingalls, resulting in an intense shootout. A western legend has it that Newcomb was badly wounded, and while he lay in the street, Rose Dunn is alleged to have run from the \\"Pierce Hotel\\" to him with two belts of ammunition and a Winchester rifle. She fired the rifle at the marshals while Newcomb reloaded his revolvers, and Newcomb was able to escape. However, that account has never been verified, and was never mentioned by the US Marshal official report, which indicated that Newcomb at best fired two shots then fled. Three deputy marshals were killed during the shootout. Newcomb and Charley Pierce were wounded, but escaped. Gang member \\"Arkansas Tom\\" Jones was slightly wounded and captured by Deputy Marshal Jim Masterson. Together with Newcomb and other members of the gang, Rose Dunn hid out for at least two months nursing the remaining gang members back to health. By 1895, Newcomb had a $5,000 bounty placed on him, dead or alive. Newcomb and Charley Pierce hid out near Norman, Oklahoma, both of them having been wounded in a gun battle with US marshals. On May 2, 1895, the Dunn Brothers shot and killed both Newcomb and Pierce as they dismounted in front of the Dunn house to visit Rose. The brothers collected the bounty, believed to have been $5,000 each. Later life After the killing of \\"Bittercreek\\" Newcomb, Rose Dunn was often accused of having set him up, revealing to her brothers where the outlaws were hiding. She denied this, and her brothers later defended her, stating that she had no knowledge of their intentions, nor did she reveal the hideout to them. She was never prosecuted for her involvement with the gang. Her short outlaw life launched her to the level of western legend. In 1898 she married local politician Charles Albert Noble, and sometime after 1900 (a census year), they left Oklahoma and all outlaw associations behind them. Charles Noble died in 1930 and she married Richard Fleming (whom she first met when 16) in 1946. She died at the age of 76 in Salkum, Washington.  In pop culture  The name \\"Rose of Cimarron\\" (not that of Rose Dunn) first came to popular attention with the publication of Bill Tilghman's booklet Oklahoma Outlaws The film Rose of Cimarron is very loosely inspired by Rose Dunn. Despite the lead characters being called Rose of Cimarron and George Newcomb, the plot bears no resemblance to Dunn's actual life beyond an ambivalent relationship with the law and outlaws. The 1976 single \\"Rose of Cimarron\\" by Poco was inspired by an Oklahoma tourist leaflet read by band member Rusty Young in 1973.

It is located in the Upper Ottawa Valley along Highway 17 (Trans-Canada Highway), inland (west) from the Ottawa River, approximately northwest of Petawawa, and northwest of Ottawa. Chalk River was a separate municipality until January 1, 2000, when the United Townships of Rolph, Buchanan, Wylie and McKay and the Village of Chalk River were merged. Chalk River's area is environmentally pristine with extensive forests, hills and numerous small lakes all of which support a variety of wildlife typical to the southern edge of the Canadian Shield. St. Anthony's Elementary School is the only educational institution in the community, instructing grades Junior Kindergarten to Grade 8. It provides Catholic education to the children in the neighbourhood, with a church next door. Students in higher grades are bussed to nearby Deep River. The town consists mainly of detached houses with some townhouses and an apartment building. Local services include a convenience store and a gas station. The only traditional truck stop style restaurant, the Treetop, was lost in February 2019 to a roof collapse and remains to be demolished or rebuilt. The Chalk River library, the Lions Hall, and the Legion all play an important part in the community. Local recreational activities include hiking, fourwheeling, and biking. In the winter, snowmobile and cross country ski trails can be enjoyed. A skating rink and baseball diamond are also present.  History Chalk River on Ontario Highway 17 The town was first settled in the mid-19th century and named in 1875 after the Chalk River (named for the chalk loggers used to mark logs) flowing just south of the community. Chalk River played an increasingly important role in settlement of the Upper Ottawa Valley after a Canadian Pacific Railway line was constructed through the area. Local employers Employers include Bubble Technology Industries. The Canadian Forest Service maintains the Petawawa Research Forest nearby. The community borders the northern edge of CFB Petawawa. The Chalk River Laboratories is a nuclear research centre located on the bank of the Ottawa River. While named after the community of Chalk River, the research centre is located in Chalk River's neighbouring town of Deep River. Chalk River Laboratories was the first laboratory created by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited.

Taxonomy  There are six recognized subspecies and one undescribed subspecies from the Mahale Mountains in Tanzania: *Angola colobus, Colobus angolensis **Sclater's Angola colobus, C. a. subsp. angolensis **Powell-Cotton's Angola colobus, C. a. subsp. cottoni **Ruwenzori colobus C. a. subsp. ruwenzori (Friedrichs) **Cordier's Angola colobus, C. a. subsp. cordieri **Prigogine's Angola colobus, C. a. subsp. prigoginei **Peters Angola colobus or Tanzanian black-and-white colobus, C. a. subsp. palliatus  Physical characteristics  Tanzanian black-and-white colobus (Colobus angolensis subsp. palliatus) in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania Like all black- and-white colobi, the Angola colobus has black fur and a black face, surrounded by long, white locks of hair. It also has a mantle of white hair on the shoulders. The long, thin tail can be either black or white, but the tip is always white. There is a significant regional variation in the total amount of white on the body and the length of the fur. Animals that live in the mountains have longer, thicker fur than animals from the lowlands to protect them against the cold. The Angola colobus has a head-body length of 50 to 70 cm, with the males usually being larger than females. The tail is about 75 cm long, and the body weight varies between 9 and 20 kg.  Distribution and habitat  The Angola colobus occurs in dense rainforests, both in the lowlands and coastal mountains. It lives in most of the Congo Basin, to the south and northeast of the Congo River, as far as Ruwenzori, Burundi and southwestern Uganda. The species can also be found in East Africa, especially in the montane and coastal forests of Kenya and Tanzania and in isolated mountain areas. Although the species is named after Angola, it is quite rare in that country. Of all Colobus species, the Angola colobus occurs in the southernmost latitudes. The geographical range lies south of that of the mantled guereza. It is found up to 2,415 m above sea level in Kenya.  Diet  The diet of the Angola colobus consists of about two thirds of leaves and one third of fruit and seeds. The East Tanzanian population lives mainly on ripe fruit, supplemented with full-grown leaves.

Darryl Sterdan of the Winnipeg Sun states that \\"Cinderellen turns out to be kind of a surprise party.

Life Kuperjanov was a schoolteacher in the village of Kambja. At the start of World War I, he was mobilised into the Imperial Russian Army and commissioned after receiving basic officer training. He was wounded in both legs. In 1917 he joined the Estonian forces during the start of the War of Independence. In December 1918, he received permission to form a ranger battalion. Students were among the first to join the Tartu County Partisan Battalion. On 14 January 1919, Julius Kuperjanov was among the liberators of Tartu. He died some weeks later of wounds received leading an attack during the decisive Battle of Paju.  Family name  Because his parents emigrated to Russia for work, they acquired a russified form of their family name (original Kupper). After returning to Estonia, they preserved this name.http://www.virumaa.ee/2008/01/ve-kuperjanov-julius/ Contemporary view The Julius Kuperjanov monument unrestored To honour Kuperjanov, the unit he had raised was renamed after him.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 109.

Dissidents and patriotically minded students would periodically gather there on various anniversaries to light candles and place flowers in his memory. During the occupation period, the KGB kept a watch on the tomb, and arrested the persons who came to honor the memory of the national hero.

He is currently a director at AOBiome, as well as founder and CEO of PatientsLikeMe.Our team ALS Therapy Development Institute Conceived while James Heywood was moving cross country in March 1999 to be with his family, ALS TDI became the world's first non-profit biotechnology company and pioneered a new model for accelerating translational research by directly hiring scientists to develop treatments outside of the academic and for-profit corporate architecture. The institute's initial approach focused on gene therapy and stem cells and ALS TDI was the first to publish on the safety of the use of stem cells in ALS patients. ALS TDI then pioneered a novel high-throughput in-vivo validation program that tested more treatments in preclinical studies than all other labs combined and led to two drugs being tested in clinical trials. The culmination of this work is a paper published in the journal \\"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\\" that identified crucial errors present in many existing preclinical studies that could lead to false positive results. The results suggest that false positive results may rest with the methods used by researchers and not the models themselves. The paper has clear clinical implications, as ALS TDI was unable to replicate a number of prior animals studies from the field that led to clinical trials that ultimately failed in humans. Stephen Heywood died in the fall of 2006 when his ventilator accidentally disconnected shortly before ALS TDI began a comprehensive program to use industrial discovery approaches to understand the disease.http://www.technologyreview.com/article/19560/ In August 2007, after serving as ALS TDI's CEO for nine years and having raised $50m in funding, Heywood stepped down and joined the Institute's board of directors.http://www.biospace.com/news_story.aspx?NewsEntityId=67457 He retains the title \\"Alex and Brit d‚ÄôArbeloff Founding Director\\" in honor of their support and involvement in the creation of ALS TDI. PatientsLikeMe In 2005, Heywood joined his youngest brother Ben and longtime friend Jeff Cole to found PatientsLikeMe. PatientsLikeMe operates disease-specific communities and allows for dialogue between patients about how to improve care and accelerate research. PatientsLikeMe is a privately funded company that aggregates its users health information and sells it to the pharmaceutical and medical device industry. PatientsLikeMe was named one of \\"15 companies that will change the world\\" by CNN Money.https://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/biz2/0708/gallery.next_disruptors.biz2/7.html Currently Heywood serves as chairman of PatientsLikeMe and is focused on developing a broad patient-centered platform that improves medical care and accelerates the research process by measuring the value of treatments and interventions in the real world.

History The original adaptation was by James Goss and Arvind Ethan David while still at school in 1991. In this form it was less than an hour long and \\"amusing but utterly incomprehensible\\". The same team expanded the script and, with the assistance of producer Matt Wreford, staged a student production from 30 May to 3 June 1995 at the Old Fire Station Theatre in Oxford. The production made use of computer animation to display some of the difficult scenes and concepts and was generally regarded as a success. SFX magazine said \\"As fine a piece of science fiction theatre as you are likely to find anywhere.\\" Douglas Adams attended the last night and was delighted with the production. It was revived again in 1997 but this time at the Oxford Playhouse, running from 5 November‚Äì8 November. Again Douglas Adams was in the audience and this was said to have got him thinking about a movie of Dirk Gently. There was a further staging at Imperial College London on 8‚Äì11 December 1999. After Adams's death in 2001, a smaller scale production was staged as a tribute at the Unicorn Theatre, Abingdon by the Old Gaol Theatre Company, running from the 5 December‚Äì8 December. The director was a friend of the Adams family and the last night was attended by Douglas's sister, Sue and James Thrift, Douglas's half-brother. This production used none of the computer effects of previous ones and relied heavily on the audience's familiarity with the story. A sofa, which forms a significant plot item in the book, was wedged in the staircase into the theatre so patrons had to climb over it to get to their seats. Also in 2001, Dirk went international, with a production by the Vagabond Theatre company running in Perth, Western Australia from 14 June‚Äì30 June. The production was directed by Jo Marsh and starred Cavan Gallagher as Dirk Gently. The first American production ran from 29 September to 12 December 2006 at the Road Theatre Company, North Hollywood, California.  Differences from the book In converting a very complex book into a play lasting 1‚Äì2 hours (depending on version) it was inevitable that some elements would have to be left out. The biggest change is that the Electric Monk is left out completely. Apart from the difficulty of having a character on a horse in a stageplay, a large amount of the book concerning the monk is purely descriptive with little dialogue so he had to go. This in itself has knock-on effects for other characters and a further major change is that Michael Wenton-Weakes now becomes the murderer of Gordon Way. The book appears to take place in an alternate universe whereas the play is in our universe and the paradoxes regarding Bach and Coleridge do not exist. Another problem exists in the scene where Dirk and Richard are walking along the bank of the Grand Union Canal and Richard is supposed to dive in the canal when he hears the words \\"My old maiden Aunt who lived in Winnipeg\\". It would be rather difficult to have a canal on stage so this is replaced by Richard dancing the Bossa Nova and many people remember this as one of the funniest parts of the play.

Early life  Jemima Nicholas was the daughter of William and Elinor Nicholas of Llanrhian, and was baptised in Mathry in 1755. She was a cobbler or a cobbler's wife.  The Battle of Fishguard  In 1797, 1400 French troops, many of them drawn from prisons, sailed from Camaret and landed at Llanwnda in Wales. Armed with a pitchfork, Nicholas led a group of women and rounded up twelve French soldiers who had been drinking, and held them captive inside a locked church overnight. The French surrendered shortly afterwards at the Royal Oak. She was awarded a lifetime pension for her efforts. A Jemima Nicholas was also involved with rioting in Fishguard in 1824, though she was not convicted of any crime.  Legacy  She died at the age of 82, in 1832. Her grave in Fishguard was marked with a plaque in 1897, on the occasion of the invasion's centennial. She is featured in the Last Invasion Tapestry commissioned by the Fishguard Arts Society.

It only requires standard 32-bit x86 PC hardware and can boot directly from the network via PXE or Etherboot from a TFTP server, or from local devices such as Hard disks, CompactFlash drives, USB keyrings and CD/DVDs. The minimum requirement is an i686 class CPU and RAM dependent on the intended use, typically 64‚Äì256 MB.  Technical specifications  Thinstation is a standalone system, that does not require any modification of the server as long as the server accepts remote client connections. This is true for: * Microsoft Windows Server (2000, 2003, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2) using RDP via rdesktop and FreeRDP. * Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 versions for single user login (Remote desktop). * Citrix servers using ICA * Linux, Unix servers using X (XDMCP), NX (NoMachine, FreeNx, 2X, Neatx), ThinLinc (Cendio), View Open client (VMware), SSH, Telnet and other text terminals. Even a light standalone desktop is available with Mozilla Firefox and some other basic application like editors and file managers. A web kiosk is a standard solution too. A Thinstation boot image can be created in two ways (really only one with two paths). * You can download the development environment with the DevStation Installer, which will set up a nice build system for you on real hardware or a virtual machine that runs on Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac, or a Unix computer. * You can clone the development environment to an installed Linux Distro of your choice.  Comparison with LTSP  Thinstation resembles Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) but: * unlike LTSP, Thinstation is independent of NFS (Network File System) ‚Äì although NFS can also be supported. * unlike LTSP, Thinstation supports non-Linux servers such as Microsoft Windows and Citrix. * LTSP comes integrated with several Linux distributions whereas Thinstation is an independent project.  History  Thinstation started as a fork of Netstation in May 2003, hosted on SourceForge. It was originated by Miles Roper from New Zealand and joined by Paolo Salvan (Italy) and Mike Eriksen (Denmark). Shortly after Trevor Batley (Australia) joined the core staff, contributing TS-O-Matic and was the project leader of ver. 2.3, that didn't materialize. Marcos Amorim (Brazil) is heading a future version based on OpenEmbedded. The present version 5 is developed mainly by Donald A. Cupp Jr. (USA) and is based on Crux Linux ver. 2.7.

Over the course of its existence, the mission was twice relocated. \\"Comond√∫ Viejo\\" was established in 1709 by the missionary Juli√°n de Mayorga and financed by the Marqu√©s de Villapuente de la Pe√±a and his wife the Marquesa de las Torres de Rada. The location proved less than ideal as an agricultural settlement. A smallpox epidemic in 1710 killed half of the mission's neophytes. The mission was moved to its second site in 1736, and Comond√∫ Viejo became a visita or subordinate mission station. The foundations of the chapel and portions of an irrigation system survive. The new location for Comond√∫ was located about 50 kilometers to the southwest, at what had previously been the visita of San Miguel. This location was reduced back to visita status in 1737, although many structural remnants of the mission survive. The final location for the mission was about 3 kilometers upstream from San Miguel. First adobe structures and, after 1750, a large stone building were erected. However, the neophyte population declined from more than 300 in 1740 to 80 in 1768 and 28 in 1800. The mission ceased to function in 1827. Substantial architectural remnants survived into the 20th century, but the existing buildings have been extensively renovated.

(Cash on Delivery). This song is Cash's first single to reach any chart in Billboard magazine or to be featured on a countdown.[]. The track is the third song on the album with a running time of 4:01. Scarface, who is an idol of Ray Cash is featured on the song. For a period of time, it was featured on BET 106 & Park voting page. It was also featured on the video game NFL Street 3. Background The song was released in 2006 and received airplay in the spring. The song is about the Cleveland style of music. It has a distinctive beat, which is played loudly on the chorus parts of the song, but keeps the same pitch for the majority of the song. The video begins with Cash waking up in bed, with a bunch of his friends who supposedly he has had a house party with. He brushes his teeth and then he is seen on the streets of Cleveland and mentions the Ghet-to-Vision label. He then rides down Cleveland. There is a woman who stares at him from her house. He mentions UGK, and a glimpse of one of their albums is shown. The woman later rides in his car. In the next scene, he carries his boombox, as shots of Cleveland and cars are shown. Several children follow Cash on bikes. Cash has his car door open. At this point, he stops at a car wash and is recognized by another patron (played by Devin The Dude). The next scenes feature shots of C.O.D. Cash on Delivery; his associates carry boxes of his CDs into a local goods store. The camera in the video shows different angles of Cash and his friends. As the video shows Ray Cash as in Cash on a dollar, Scarface's verse begins, as Cash calls him on his cell phone. In a huddle, the clique come down the streets and apparently walk into a party. The video shows clips of Cash and Scarface alone in black, with the boombox. Some of their separate scenes include both with boomboxes, and with women. Scarface raps out the party scene, which occasionally is shown in sideview of Scarface and Cash alone. Cash and his friend play craps. Pimp C, Bun B & Layzie Bone make a cameo appearance in the video. The end of the video shows various clips of Cleveland, Cash in concert, and Cash and Scarface alone. Remixes \\"Bumpin' My Music\\" has received remixes which are available on the internet.

US 221 veers east on Elm Avenue through the Old Southwest neighborhood to Franklin Road. Southbound US 221 follows Franklin Road to the northeast while northbound US 221 continues on Elm Avenue to Jefferson Street, which carries SR 116 in both directions. There, US 221 turns north; Elm Avenue continues east as SR 24. US 221 and SR 116 head north past the Patrick Henry Hotel to Franklin Road, where the highways turn east. After one block on Franklin Road, the highways turn north onto four-lane Williamson Road, on which they head north along the eastern side of Downtown Roanoke. US 221 and SR 116 are joined by US 11 at Campbell Avenue. The three highways expand to a divided highway and cross over Norfolk Southern's Blue Ridge District rail line between the Roanoke Shops to the east and the O.

Northern terminus of US 221 at US 29 Bus./US 460 Bus./US 501 Bus. in Lynchburg Just inside the town limits, the two U.S. Highways diverge: US 460 continues along its bypass of Bedford while US 221 and US 460 Business head toward the downtown area along two-lane Blue Ridge Avenue. At the west edge of downtown, the highways continue on Main Street and intersect SR 122 Business (Crenshaw Street) at the Bedford Historic Meetinghouse. At Bridge Street, US 460 Business and southbound SR 43 continue east on Main Street while US 221, SR 122 Business, and northbound SR 43 turn north onto Bridge Street to cross the Blue Ridge District rail line. North of the railroad, SR 43 splits northwest on Peaks Street toward the Peaks of Otter. US 221 and SR 122 Business head northeast on Longwood Avenue to the business route's terminus at SR 122, which heads south on Independence Boulevard toward US 460 and north on a continuation of Longwood Avenue. US 221 continues east on two-lane Forest Road, exiting the Bedford town limits, and then crossing the Little Otter River and the Otter River. After passing Goode, the U.S. Highway heads through Forest, the site of Saint Stephen's Episcopal Church and its Old Rectory and Thomas Jefferson's private retreat, Poplar Forest. At Forest, US 221 enters the suburban area surrounding Lynchburg and enters the independent city itself just west of its intersection with US 501 (Lynchburg Expressway).

Within the Banyarwanda there are three subgroups: Hutu, Tutsi and Batwa. Some Banyarwanda live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, having migrated there from neighbouring Rwanda in waves. In the Congo, they live in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu. There are also 1 million Banyarwanda in Uganda, where they live in the west of the country; Umutara and Kitara are the centres of their pastoral and agricultural areas. Classification The Banyarwanda, through their language of Kinyarwanda, form a subgroup of the Bantu peoples, who inhabit a geographical area stretching east and southward from Central Africa across the African Great Lakes region down to Southern Africa. Scholars from the Royal Museum of Central Africa in Tervuren, building on earlier work by Malcolm Guthrie, placed Kinyarwanda within the Great Lakes Bantu languages. This classification groups the Banyarwanda with nineteen other ethnic groups including the Barundi, Banyankore, Baganda and Bahunde.  History   Origins  Twa were the earliest of the Banyarwanda groups to settle in the territory of Rwanda The Banyarwanda are descended from a diverse group of people, who settled in the area through a series of migrations. The earliest known inhabitants of the African Great Lakes area were a sparse group of hunter gatherers, who lived in the late Stone Age. They were followed by a larger population of early Iron Age settlers, who produced dimpled pottery and iron tools. These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who remain in the area today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into the territory, and began to clear forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the slopes of mountains. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly of Cushitic origin. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one. The earliest form of social organisation in the area was the clan (ubwoko). The clans were not limited to genealogical lineages or geographical area, and most included Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa. From the 14th or 15th centuries, the clans began to coalesce into kingdoms, of which the Kingdom of Rwanda was one. The first Banyarwanda were the people of this kingdom. According to oral history, Rwanda was founded on the shores of Lake Muhazi in the Buganza area, close to the modern city of Rwamagana. At that time it was a small state in a loose confederation with the larger and more powerful neighbouring kingdoms, Bugesera and Gisaka. The kingdom was invaded by the Banyoro around 1600, and the kings forced to flee westward, but the kingdom survived and a new dynasty, the Nyiginya, was built by Ruganzu Ndori, which started expanding from its base in Nyanza. As the kingdom expanded, the people in conquered areas became part of the Banyarwanda identity. The kingdom reached its greatest extent during the nineteenth century under the reign of King Kigeli Rwabugiri. Rwabugiri initiated several administrative reforms in Banyarwanda culture; these included ubuhake, in which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle, and therefore privileged status, to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service, and uburetwa, a corv√©e system in which Hutu were forced to work for Tutsi chiefs. Rwabugiri's changes caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations. The Twa were better off than in pre-Kingdom days, with some becoming dancers in the royal court, but their numbers continued to decline. Migrations and colonial influence The first exodus of ethnic Banyarwanda from the jurisdiction of the Rwanda kingdom was the Banyamulenge, who crossed the Ruzizi river into the South Kivu province of the Belgian Congo. Rwandan historian Alexis Kagame wrote in 1972 that soldiers under King Kigeli II settled in the Congo in the seventeenth century, although G√©rard Prunier casts some doubt on this hypothesis, stating that Kagame had \\"a tendency to exaggerate the power of the old Rwanda kingdom.\\" International historians believe the first significant influx of Banyarwanda into South Kivu occurred in the 1880s, although some Congolese intellectuals contest this. Scholars cite two major reasons for the migration; the first is that the migrants were composed of Tutsi trying to avoid the increasingly high taxes imposed by Rwabugiri, while the second is that the group was fleeing the violent war of succession that erupted after the death of Rwabugiri in 1895. This group was mostly Tutsi and their Hutu abagaragu (clients) had been icyihuture (turned Tutsi), which negated interethnic tension. They settled above the Ruzizi Plain on the Itombwe Plateau. The plateau, which reached an altitude of , could not support large-scale agriculture, but allowed cattle grazing. Over time, the Banyamulenge identified less as Banyarwanda and more as Congolese. Having settled in the country before the colonial era, they were later treated as a native ethnic minority within the Congo, rather than as migrants or refugees. At the end of the nineteenth century, the territory of Rwanda was assigned to Germany, marking the beginning of the colonial era. The first major contact between the Banyarwanda and the Europeans occurred in 1894 when explorer Gustav Adolf von G√∂tzen crossed Rwanda from the south-east to Lake Kivu and met the king. The Germans did not significantly alter the social structure of the country, but exerted influence by supporting the king and the existing hierarchy and delegating power to local chiefs. Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, and ruled the country much more directly. Both the Germans and the Belgians promoted Tutsi supremacy, considering the Hutu and Tutsi different races while downplaying the Rwandan ethnicity. In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards labelling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the classes. The period of Belgian rule marked the second major exodus of Banyarwanda, this time predominantly the Hutu; a 1926 change in labour laws by the Belgians allowed Rwandans to seek employment abroad, and many moved to North Kivu in the Belgian Congo as well as to the British Uganda and Tanganyika colonies. A major famine in the 1940s, as well as Belgium's desire for labourers in North Kivu, accelerated this process. The migrant Rwandans in North Kivu became known as the Banyamasisi. Recent history In 1959, following a decade of increasing tension between the Tutsi and the Hutu, a social revolution took place in Rwanda. Hutu activists began killing Tutsi, overturning the centuries-old Tutsi dominance amongst the Banyarwanda. The Belgians suddenly changed allegiance, becoming pro-Hutu, and the Rwandan monarchy was abolished in 1962 following a referendum. Rwanda then gained independence as a republic, under Hutu leadership. As the revolution progressed, Tutsi began leaving the country to escape the Hutu purges, settling in the four neighbouring countries Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire. These exiles, unlike the Banyarwanda who migrated during the pre-colonial and colonial era, were regarded as refugees in their host countries, and began almost immediately to agitate for a return to Rwanda. They formed armed groups, known as inyenzi (cockroaches), who launched attacks into Rwanda; these were largely unsuccessful, and led to further reprisal killings of Tutsi and further Tutsi exiles. By 1964, more than 300,000 Tutsi had fled, and were forced to remain in exile for the next three decades. Pro-Hutu discrimination continued in Rwanda itself, although the violence against the Tutsi did reduce somewhat following a coup in 1973. The Twa, the minority class of the Banyarwanda, remained marginalised, and by 1990 were almost entirely forced out of the forests by the government; many became beggars. In the 1980s, a group of 500 Banyarwanda refugees in Uganda, led by Fred Rwigyema, fought with the rebel National Resistance Army (NRA) in the Ugandan Bush War, which saw Yoweri Museveni overthrow Milton Obote. These soldiers remained in the Ugandan army following Museveni's inauguration as Ugandan president, but simultaneously began planning an invasion of Rwanda through a covert network within the army's ranks. In 1990, the soldiers broke ranks and launched an invasion of northern Rwanda as the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), initiating the Rwandan Civil War; neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage, and in 1993 the Rwandan government and the RPF signed a cease-fire. This ended on 6 April 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing him. The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, which began within a few hours. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government. Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted. The RPF restarted their offensive, and took control of the country methodically, gaining control of the whole country by mid-July. The victory of the Tutsi-led rebels led to a fresh Banyarwanda exodus, this time of Hutu who feared reprisals following the genocide. The largest refugee camps formed in Zaire, and were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the Interahamwe paramilitary group. By late 1996, the Hutu militants represented a serious threat to the new Rwandan regime, causing Paul Kagame to launch a counteroffensive. The Rwandan army joined forces with Zairian Tutsi groups, including the Banyamulenge and Banyamasisi, attacking the refugee camps. Many refugees returned to Rwanda, while others ventured further west into Zaire. A rebel Hutu group known as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, which seeks to restore the Hutu state in Rwanda, remains active in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as of 2014. Culture Traditional Rwandan alt=Photograph depicting two male dancers with straw wigs, neck garments, spears and sticks Music and dance are an integral part of Banyarwanda ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings and storytelling. The most famous traditional dance is a highly choreographed routine consisting of three components: the umushagiriro, or cow dance, performed by women; the intore, or dance of heroes, performed by men; and the drumming, also traditionally performed by men, on drums known as ingoma. Traditionally, music is transmitted orally, with styles varying between the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. Drums are of great importance; the royal drummers enjoyed high status within the court of the king. Drummers play together in groups of varying sizes, usually between seven and nine in number. Traditionally, Rwandan women of marriageable age and high-status Rwandan men would wear the Amasunzu hairstyle, with the hair styled into elaborate crests. A considerable amount of traditional arts and crafts is produced by the Banyarwanda, although most originated as functional items rather than purely for decoration. Woven baskets and bowls are especially common. Imigongo, a unique cow dung art, is produced in the southeast of Rwanda, with a history dating back to when the region was part of the independent Gisaka kingdom. The dung is mixed with natural soils of various colours and painted into patterned ridges to form geometric shapes. Other crafts include pottery and wood carving. Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials; circular or rectangular mud homes with grass-thatched roofs (known as nyakatsi) are the most common. The government has initiated a programme to replace these with more modern materials such as corrugated iron. Language and literature Kinyarwanda (also sometimes known as Rwanda language) is the native language of the Banyarwanda, and is spoken as a mother tongue by most Banyarwanda in Rwanda as well as those in the Congo and Uganda. Kinyarwanda is a Bantu language, and is mutually intelligible with Kirundi, an official language of Burundi and Ha, a language of western Tanzania; together, these languages form part of the wider dialect continuum known as Rwanda-Rundi.Ethnologue, 15th ed. With more than 10 million Kinyarwanda speakers, and around 20 million for Rwanda-Rundi as a whole, it is one of the largest of the Bantu languages. The language was likely to have been introduced to the area from Cameroon during the Bantu expansion, although the timescale and nature of this migration is not known conclusively. It is likely that these migrations caused Kinyarwanda to replace the native tongue of the Twa, and the Tutsi may also have originally spoken a separate language, under the hypothesis that they migrated from Nilotic speaking regions. Like most other Bantu languages, Kinyarwanda is tonal and also agglutinative: most words are formed as a series of morphemes, including a prefix, a stem, and sometimes a preprefix. Nouns are divided into sixteen classes, covering both singular and plural nouns. Some of the classes are used exclusively for particular types of noun; for example classes 1 and 2 are for nouns related to people, singular and plural respectively, classes 7, 8 and 11 refer to big versions of nouns in other classes, and class 14 is for abstract nouns. Adjectives applied to nouns generally take a prefix matching the prefix of the noun. For example, the word abantu (people) is a class 2 noun with preprefix a- and prefix ba-; when applying the adjective -biri (two) to that noun, it takes the class 2 prefix ba-, so \\"two people\\" translates as abantu babiri; ibintu (things) is a class 4 noun with prefix bi-, thus \\"two things\\" translates as ibintu bibiri. The Banyarwanda do not have a long history of written literature, and very little historical texts exist in the Kinyarwanda language. Writing was introduced during the colonial era, but most Rwandan authors of that time wrote in French. There is, however, a strong tradition of oral literature amongst the Banyarwanda. The royal court included poets (abasizi), who recited Kinyarwanda verse covering topics such as the royal lineage, as well as religion and warfare. History and moral values were also passed down through the generations by word of mouth, and the oral tradition was used as a form of entertainment in precolonial days. The most famous Rwandan literary figure was Alexis Kagame (1912‚Äì1981), who carried out and published research into oral traditions as well as writing his own poetry.

Culler joined the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) mathematics faculty in 1959 and helped put the campus in the forefront of what would become the field of computer science. He later served as director of the UCSB Computer Center and professor in the College of Engineering and extended his revolutionary view of the role of computers to include their use in the classroom. He left UCSB to work in industry and establish his own company, called Culler-Harrison, in 1969. Culler-Harrison became CHI Systems, and later, Culler Scientific. One of Glen Culler's sons, David Culler, is a notable computer scientist in his own right. Another son, Marc Culler, is a distinguished pure mathematician working in low-dimensional topology. Another son, Randall Culler, is a Jin Shin Jyutsu master. His Daughter, Katharyn Culler Cohen works in small business and non-profit consulting. Work Culler was the developer of the Culler-Fried Online System, one of the first interactive computer systems in the mid-1960 era. This was the first system to make use of a storage oscilloscope as a means of presenting graphical information, and provided an innovative means of presentation and teaching of mathematical concepts. One of the first object oriented approaches to computing, the system provided a set of operators (e.g., add, subtract, display, multiply, sin, exp) on a predefined set of mathematical objects: scalars, vectors, arrays, and matrices (2-D only, up to about order 30..33). This interpreted programming language was named MOLSF for Mathematically- Oriented Language, Single-Precision, Floating-point. The MOLSF keyboard consisted of a modified double QWERTY keyboard with the second, upper keyboard, renaming all keys to various functions (special hardware which included APL keyboard capability, two generations existed). The graphical integration was nearly seamless, but memorization of commands was nearly impossible. The CFS has a second programming language named COL for Card- Oriented Language, somewhat like modern day text-editors. MOLSF and COL didn't communicate very well. They were vastly different languages. The Culler-Fried System ran at UCSB, UCLA, and TRW. Culler's online system was chosen by ARPA to be one of the first four nodes on the original ARPANET in 1969, and with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), participated in the first exchange of packets of data transmitted in the nascent Internet. Culler- Harrison is occasionally cited as one of the precursors to the founding of Floating Point Systems, Inc. and the Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) architecture by Joseph Fisher and James Ellis. Culler returned to UCSB as an adjunct professor from 1982 through 1984. Over 25 companies in Santa Barbara were spun out of Culler‚Äôs work and the College of Engineering‚Äôs Computer Research Laboratory including Culler Harris and Culler Scientific . Awards In 2000, President of the United States Bill Clinton awarded Culler the National Medal of Technology for his \\"pioneering innovations in multiple branches of computing, including early efforts in digital speech processing, invention of the first on-line system for interactive graphical mathematics computing, and pioneering work on the ARPAnet.\\" He was also a recipient of the Seymour Cray Computer Science and Engineering Award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

Description M1910/34 combined a barrel of the M1910/30 with a carriage of the 122-mm gun M1931. The barrel was of built-up construction; it was equipped with interrupted screw breechblock and recoil system consisting of hydraulic buffer and hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The split-trail carriage had leaf spring suspension and wheels with solid rubber tires. Development and production history The first upgrade of the 152-mm siege gun M1910 resulted in a weapon with improved characteristics, but didn't address some significant shortcomings, namely insufficient mobility (due to unsprung carriage and separate transportation of barrel) and limited traverse. The new modernization was an attempt to solve these problems by using a modern split trail carriage of the 122-mm gun M1931. A prototype went through ground trials starting 16 May 1934. The trials lasted until 16 January 1935, then the gun was given to the army for testing. The responses were mostly positive and the gun was officially adopted as 152-mm gun model 1910/34. Because of its maximum elevation angle of 45¬∞, it was sometimes referred to as howitzer. In fact, even the developers initially called the piece 152-mm howitzer model 1932 and later 152-mm howitzer model 1934. The latter name can also be seen in some official documentation. Production at the Perm plant started in 1934 and continued until 1937, with a total of 275 pieces built. Organization and employment According to RKKA organization, 152-mm guns were employed by corps artillery and by the Reserve of the Main Command, typically instead of 152-mm gun-howitzer M1937 (ML-20). Heavy gun regiments of Reserve of the Main Command had 24 pieces each. According to different sources, at the outbreak of Great Patriotic War the Red Army possessed either 146 M1910/34s–û–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ê—Ä–º–∏–∏ –∞—Ä—Ç–∏–ª–ª–µ—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ –æ—Ä—É–¥–∏—è–º–∏ –Ω–∞ 22 –∏—é–Ω—è 1941 –≥ or all 275 pieces.Ivanov A. - Artillery of the USSR in Second World War. These undoubtfully saw combat in the war, though due to their limited number the details of their service are unknown. A few pieces were captured by Germans which adopted them as 15,2 cm K.433/2(r). Summary The second modernization of the M1910 significantly improved mobility and traverse of the gun. The barrel was not transported separately anymore, which meant much faster set up time. Improved elevation led to slightly longer range. However, there were still some problems. The elevation mechanism was combined with equilibrator in a single device - a construction which resulted in slow elevation. The maximum elevation angle of 45¬∞ was considered insufficient. Some elements of the gun, mostly of the upper carriage, were hard to produce. As a result, more attempts to improve the design followed, eventually resulting in the 152-mm gun- howitzer M1937 (ML-20).

From left: BAT 5, BAT 7, BAT 9 The Alfa Romeo BAT is an Italian concept car. The car originated from a joint collaboration project between Alfa Romeo and the Italian design house Bertone that began in 1953. Three cars were built: the BAT 5 in 1953, the BAT 7 in 1954, and finally the BAT 9 in 1955. All three cars were designed by Franco Scaglione. History Alfa Romeo contacted Giuseppe \\"Nuccio\\" Bertone of the Bertone design house and commissioned three concept vehicles to research the effects of drag on a vehicle. The idea was to create vehicles with the lowest possible drag coefficient. The cars were named BAT for \\"Berlinetta Aerodinamica Tecnica.\\" All the cars featured large rear bumpers and curved fins. They were built upon the Alfa Romeo 1900 chassis. Each of the three cars was presented at the Turin Auto Show, in 1953, 1954 and 1955 respectively. The lowest of the three cars' drag coefficient was 0,19, an achievement even by today's standards. For each of the cars, Alfa Romeo provided a five-speed gearbox and a powerful four-cylinder engine that produced more than , good enough to propel the car to a top speed of .Google-kirjat: https://books.google.fi/books?id=zxi4NGN00koC&pg;=PA141&dq;=bertone+bat+5&hl;=fi&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjP37SO5PnNAhUD2CwKHSNnBL4Q6AEISDAE#v=onepage&q;=bertone bat 5&f;=false, accessdate: 17. July 2016 All three original BATs have been restored. They make appearances at car shows such as the Concorso Italiano and Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. The cars have been on display at the Blackhawk Museum in Danville, CA, from 2005 until July 2017. BAT 5 1953 Alfa Romeo BAT 5 The BAT 5 was the first of the Bertone-Alfa Romeo BAT project. It was first shown at the Turin Auto Show in 1953. The design of the model was based on a study of aerodynamics. The shape of the front in fact aims to eliminate the problem of airflow disruption at high speeds. The design also aims to do away with any extra resistance generated by the wheels turning, as well as achieving a structure which would create the fewest possible air vortices. In practice these rigorous criteria would allow the car to reach with the engine mounted as standard. The design that Bertone came up with was for an extremely light car (), with side windows at a 45 degree angle with respect to the body of the car and a large windscreen which blends in with the almost flat roof. The tail has a length-ways rear windscreen divided by a slim pillar, and two fins tapering upwards and slightly inwards. The car had a drag coefficient of 0,23. BAT 7 1954 Alfa Romeo BAT 7 The second BAT was shown at the Turin Auto Show in 1954, a year after the BAT 5. For this design (as for the other BAT models, though less evidently), Bertone added elements from his experience working on wing profiles in the aeronautical industry. The result was the shape of the large, curved tail fins. The nose was lower than that of the BAT 5, and the protrusions where the headlights would normally be stuck out even further. The headlights were located next to the nose and moved down when in use. The drag coefficient of the BAT 7 is 0,19. The BAT 7 features in the Top Gear book Daft Cars by Matt Master.Pages 10-11 of Daft Cars by Matt Master. BBC Books BAT 9 1955 Alfa Romeo BAT 9 The third BAT was shown at the Turin Auto Show of 1955, the BAT 9. It was made to look more like the then current Alfa Romeo models than the other BATs. The BAT 9 did away with the marked wing lines of the previous models in favour of a cleaner, more sober line. The tail fins, which in the other two models had a real wing-like look, were sized down into two small metal plates, much like the tail fins in production on American and some European cars of the time. BAT 11 2008 Alfa Romeo BAT 11 After more than 50 years, Alfa Romeo and Bertone showed a new BAT concept in 2008. The BAT 11 made its d√©but in Geneva, at the time of the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, though not at the show itself. The new BAT 11, based on the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione, shares many styling cues with the classic BAT cars of the 1950s.

GM Rewell & Company, 1887. p657 As Charles was a child prodigy in mathematics, he began teaching the subject there, at the age of fourteen. He attended the short-lived Noyes Academy in Canaan, New Hampshire, in 1835. He next appears in 1849 as a faculty member, giving an inaugural address, at the New York Central College, an integrated institution founded by members of the American Baptist Free Mission Society in McGrawville, New York.Scott W. Williams, \\"Charles L. Reason, an African American Mathematician in 1850\\", Mathematicians of the African Diaspora Website, State University of New York, Buffalo, 2006, accessed 26 February 2011 He was described as of \\"fair education and superior intelligence, 'complexion very light, beautiful black curly hair and a magnificent moustache'. He would very easily pass for an Anglo-Saxon.\\" Another description says he is \\"one of the most courtly gentlemen of the colored race in this city\\" (New York). Career Reason's first teaching job, in the 1830s, was at \\"the Quaker school in Laurens Street.\\" In 1847, Reason, along with Charles Bennett Ray, founded the New York-based Society for the Promotion of Education among Colored Children. Two years later, he was appointed professor of belles-lettres, Greek, Latin, and French at New York Central College, McGrawville, while also serving as an adjunct professor of mathematics. Central College was the first college to be integrated from its opening day; it hired Reason as the most qualified applicant. Reason was thus both the first Black professor, and the first Black teacher with white students, in the United States. He was described in a newspaper as \\"an accomplished and attractive man, and...a fine and ripe scholar, ...highly popular with the students, and with the citizens of McGrawville.\\" In 1852 Reason left that post to become the principal of the Quaker Institute for Colored Youth in Philadelphia (later Cheyney University of Pennsylvania), a post he held until 1856. During his time there, Reason increased enrollment from six students to 118. Here he favored math and the sciences, but gradually included other areas of study, particularly languages. Seniors expected their grades to appear in the most widely circulated paper in the U.S. black communities: the A.M.E.'s Christian Recorder. Half of the students normally failed to graduate. Though instruction was strict, and exams were rigorous, parents scrambled to register their children. Reason returned to New York, where he served for decades in public education as a teacher, administrator, and reformer. He was principal of Colored Grammar School No. 2, on 41st Street. During this time, he was instrumental in efforts to abolish slavery and segregation. He was a delegate to the Colored Labor Convention held in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1870. He successfully lobbied for passage of an 1873 statute to integrate New York's public schools; however, in 1876 he was the head of New York City's colored public schools. He was politically active in many community groups. In the presidential election of 1884 he was a candidate for the Electoral College, at the moment a politically important position, on the Republican ticket. In 1878 he owned a brownstone at 242 East 53rd St. It was filled with books. He was described as \\"a remarkably well-read man and speaks several languages. ...He is said to be worth $60,000\\" (). After the public schools in New York City were desegregated, he became principal of Grammar School No. 80 at 252 West 42nd Street. Although suffering two strokes (one in 1885 and one in 1890) that left him physically incapacitated, Reason continued at his post until he retired, some five months before his death. Reason was also a poet. He contributed to the Colored American in the 1830s and was a leader of New York City's Phoenix Society in the 1840s. He wrote the poem \\"Freedom\\", which celebrated the British abolitionist Thomas Clarkson; it was published in Alexander Crummell's 1849 biography of Clarkson.Joan R. Sherman, Invisible Poets: Afro-Americans of the Nineteenth Century, 2d ed. (1989), pp. 27-32 Marriage and family Not much documentation has been found on Reason's personal life, but he was said to have been married and widowed three times. His third and final wife was Clorice (Duplessis) Esteve (1819‚Äì1884), whom he married in New York City on July 17, 1855. They had no children, although she had a daughter from her previous marriage to John Lucien Esteve (1809‚Äì1852), a French West Indian confectioner, restaurateur, and caterer in New York City.1850 Federal Census, Fifth Ward, City of New York, p. 458 Reason suffered two strokes, which, after a recovery period, required him to go to work in a carriage, as he could not walk. He retired five months before his death. He died in his 53rd St. home in New York City in 1893 and is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. The cause of his death was specified as Bright's disease. His estate was estimated at $30,000. Further reading *John E.

The government of Azerbaijan has aimed to increase environmental protection and ensure rational utilization of natural resources, and has introduced a number of important laws, legal documents and state programs in order to improve the ecological situation in the country. However, these precautionary laws have not been as effective as they were meant to be. Transparency has been a consistent issue in Azerbaijan, as NGO's who are given legal authority to collect data from the oil refineries are often blocked or dismissed, and their information is gathered unofficially. Domestic oil producers have often evaded the regulations, and have not prevented oil leaks into the Caspian Sea. In the next 30 years, Azerbaijan will produce more oil than it produced during the last century, and currently there is little coordination or environmental precaution in the oil drilling operations. There is also a lack of communication with neighboring countries bordering the Caspian Sea.  Health effects  The most severe forms of pollution are the following: dumped petroleum during the Soviet Period, discharge of sewage, depleted stocks of sturgeon, severe air pollution, and heavy use of pesticides and fertilizers. Many of the locals are constantly exposed to the contaminants, and they have accepted to live in it. Some even comment on the beauty of the ocean with the layer of oil that glisten on the top. Unfortunately, the smell and the ramifications of constant exposure to harmful vapors are a concern to the local health, particularly the coastline of Azerbaijan. The ramifications of petro-fueled industries are the following health concerns: harms to the pulmonary, digestive, circulatory, and immune systems. In the worst cases, genetic mutations can occur. Groundwater is also affected by the oil spills causing cancers and bacterial diseases like cholera and hepatitis.  Other forms of pollution  The following are the principal ecological problems of Azerbaijan: * The pollution of water resources by way of introduction of contaminated water, including transnational pollution * The supply of low- quality water to inhabited regions, the loss of fresh water prior to it delivery to the end consumers, insufficient development of sewer systems * Air pollution from industrial plants and transport vehicles * Degradation of soil (erosion, desertification, etc.) * Deforestation as the burning trees affect the climate cycle * Improper regulation of industry and housing, as well as hazardous solid wastes * Decline in biological diversity * Decline in forest reserves and fauna, especially fish results  Conclusion  The government has focused on these issues and the judicial system has provided laws to safeguard local health. Foreign oil producers and refineries have been more consistent with these regulations, while not all the time, more so than the domestic oil companies. British Petroleum is one such company that attempts to clean the floors of the ocean by separating the contaminants with the rest of the natural setting. Still, locals are without much strength as the people cannot depend on the judicial system to be actionable as the country is still shedding its war-torn past.

Because of the small numbers of Brewsters in service (44) in the Finnish Air Force, the Finns wanted to see if they could design a fighter based on the Brewster design. The aircraft designers Torsti Verkkola, Arvo Ylinen and Martti Vainio were called upon to lead the project. The Finnish Air Force ordered 90 Humus; however, production was stopped in 1944, when only one aircraft had been produced, serial no. HM-671. The first flight took place on 8 August 1944, HM-671 flying for a total of 19 hours and 50 minutes. The aircraft was heavier than calculated, its engine was underpowered, and the aircraft was not of the standard expected from a fighter aircraft of 1944.

It was established by the decree of the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, on July 5, 2003 within the territory of Salyan Rayon administrative districts. Its surface area is . The Shirvan National Park was established on the base of the Shirvan State Reserve founded in 1969 and neighbouring areas. The reserve‚Äòs activity is focused on the protection and reproduction of the Goitered Gazelle (Gazella sulgutturosa), waterfowl birds and typical plant biotypes of the Shirvan Lowland. The area is 25800 hectares, of which 3500 hectares are water reservoirs. The territory of the park used to be at the bottom of the Caspian Sea and at present it is an accumulative plain, which is 20‚Äì25 m below sea level with a slight increase in the relief westwards. In terms of climate the park lies in an area of moderate warm semi-desert and arid steppe. Summers are hot and dry and winters are cool and dry. Etymology The word 'Shirvan' appears to be derived from Shƒ´r (). The word shir refers to the lion, which is now extinct in the Trans-Caucasus. Flora and fauna Flora In the park there are several types of vegetation. The desert type is represented by Halocnemum, Halostachys and Salicornia formations developed on solonchaks. Halocnemum vegetation occupies about 40% of the territory of the park. The main species is the Halocnemum strobilaceum. The Halostachys phytocenosis has a more complicated structure and a richer species composition than Halocnemum. At the tops of the hills Halostachys grows and the slopes are covered by cereals and motley grass from the ephemeral group. '' Salicornia vegetation has developed in a small area of the central part of the park as a result of wet salines and the high level of ground waters. As well as Salicornia europaea, there is also S. rankenive and S. tonkokhstnik. The semi-desert type of vegetation is represented by formations of sveda and ephemeral wormwood. The latter formation, which occupies 40% of the park area, has the richest species composition. Wormwood dominates, and among ephemera 20-25 species are met, including mast cereals: Poa bulbosa, Bromus, wall barley (Hordeum leporinum), etc. Meadow-type vegetation is developed in the park on chals (humid lowerings on the relief). The herbage is two-layered and is formed of Alhagi (first layer) and Aeluropus repens (second layer). In some places Artemisia and wall barley (Hordeum leporinum) are found. Fauna Goitered gazelle The fauna is poorly studied. Among amphibians there are variable toad (Bufotes variabilis), tree frogs (Hyla sp.) and marsh frog (Pelophylax ridibundus). Among reptiles there are European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis), Caspian turtle (Mauremys caspica) and spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca), lizard, grass snake (Natrix natrix) Levantine viper (Macrovipera lebetina) and others. The ornitofauna is poorly studied, but according to the existing data there are bustards (Otides), Francolinus, little bustard (Otis tetrax), white- tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), steppe eagle (Aquila nipalensis), peregrine (Falco peregrinus), saker falcon (Falco cherrug) and Pterocletes orientalis. In winter, there are many migratory birds on the water bodies such as gray goose (Anser anser), mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchus), pintail (Anas acuta) and others. Among rare mammals species there are red fox, Persian gazelle, wild boar, wolf, jackal, jungle cat, badger, European hare, and others. Greek tortoise, Persian gazelle, Francolinus francolinus, bustard, little bustard, white-tailed eagle, steppe eagle, peregrine, saker falcon are listed in the Red Book. In the past, this area was once within the Asiatic lion's range in the Caucasus, and the Caspian tiger used to visit it from Persia. The main protected objects are the natural semi-desert complexes of the south-eastern Shirvan, with the world's biggest population of Persian gazelles and the water-wading ecosystem, which is a place of nesting, a migration route and wintering area for many valuable bird species (western part of the Shor-Gel Lake). Goitered gazelle conservation Shirvan National Park has played an important role in recovery of Goitered gazelle reintroductions in Azerbaijan and Georgia. Gazelles from Shirvan National Park have been reintroduced to several areas including Vashlovani National Park, Qobustan, Absheron, Ajinohur steppe, Ag-Gel National Park.

The youngest of seven children, his father was a medical doctor, and his grandfather Dr Barry Edward O'Meara was Napoleon's physician on St. Helena.

From 1869 to 1871 O'Meara lived in Dublin, when he may have continued his education or received private art lessons. An early sketchbook that survives from this time shows landscape studies from around County Carlow, as well as studies of churches and animals. Two of O'Meara's siblings died young, and his mother died in 1873. It is following this, that he moved to Paris, where his cousin Kathleen O'Meara was a writer and correspondent for The Tablet. Artistic career O'Meara became one of the first students of Carolus Duran at 81 Boulevard Montparnasse, working alongside English, French and American students including John Singer Sargent. Duran was heavily influenced by Diego Vel√°zquez, though there is little evidence of this influence in O'Meara's work. Whilst studying and socialising in Paris, fellow students did notice a predilection towards moodiness and introspection in his personality, which is reflected in his work. Some have speculated that it was the loss of his two siblings and mother at a young age that cast this sense of melancholy over O'Meara's character. In 1875, he visited the artists colonies, firstly in Barbizon, and then Grez-sur- Loing where he settled and eventually befriended Robert Louis Stevenson. O'Meara stayed in Grez-sur-Loing for almost 11 years, with brief periods away during the winter or for exhibitions. He favoured painting en plein air, preferring low grey evening light. During the spring of 1876 Fanny Osbourne, and her daughter Isobel arrived at Grez. The Osbournes and O'Meara developed a friendship, with the pair visiting galleries and museums in Paris, and painting together. When the Osbournes left to return to California in 1878, O'Meara presented a portrait of himself painted by John Singer Sargent to Isobel, with whom he is believed to have fallen in love. Whilst many of his friends left Grez, O'Meara stayed, living at H√¥tel Chevillon and continuing to paint. There are a few characteristic elements of O'Meara's work: figures of lone women, often near water with bare autumnal trees, in evening light. There is a sense of melancholia in his work which some have attributed to his personal misfortune: his ill-health, living in near poverty, and two failed love affairs. O'Meara was a popular companion amongst the English-speaking painters, including John Lavery, William Stott and Carl Larsson. Stott's work bears the strongest influence from O'Meara, though Lavery noted that of all the artists in Grez, O'Meara influenced him the most. O'Meara exhibited R√™verie in \\"A collection of pictures by British artists from the Paris salon\\" at the Fine Art Society in London in July 1882, and some more work was shown at the Liverpool Autumn Exhibition in 1883 and at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1884, 1885 and 1887. O'Meara was a very slow painter, producing an average of just 3 pictures a year. O'Meara returned to Carlow in the spring of 1888 and died on 15 October that year, aged thirty-five, having suffered from malaria for a number of years. He is regarded as never having reached his full potential as an artist due to his long illness and premature death. In 1879, O'Meara featured in one Royal Hibernian Academy exhibition with the painting The old old story. His father then lent one of his paintings to the Dublin Arts Club in 1889. His work was included in The peasant in nineteenth-century French artn The Douglas Hyde Gallery, Dublin, in 1983, The Irish impressionists at the National Gallery of Ireland in 1984 and Ulster Museum in 1985, and Frank O'Meara and his contemporaries Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane, Crawford Art Gallery, Cork, and Ulster Museum in 1989. Five of his works hang at the Hugh Lane Gallery of Modern Art, in Dublin. Another can be viewed at the Ulster Museum, Belfast. O'Meara's work has been described as being rediscovered in the late 1990s, with the prices of his paintings at auction reaching unforeseen prices. In May 1999, at a Christie's auction in London, Reverie sold for over ten times the estimate, at ¬£496,500 sterling.

He served in the Cellular Jail (Kalapani), and he was among the founders of Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). Along with Basawon Singh (Sinha) he was among the founder members of Congress Socialist Party from Bihar. Background Yogendra Shukla and his nephew Baikuntha Shukla (1907‚Äì1934) hailed from Jalalpur village in Lalganj Muzaffarpur district (now Vaishali district) of Bihar. From 1932 to 1937, Yogendra served prison sentence in Kalapani, as one of the leaders of the revolutionary movement in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. He became famous for his many exploits. He was a senior associate of Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Datta and had even trained them. He had to serve prison terms for a total of more than sixteen and a half years for his revolutionary activities. During imprisonment in different jails of India, he was subjected to extreme torture, which corroded his iron constitution. He died in a sick condition and he had also become blind. Kalapani In October 1932, the Judicial Secretary, A.C.Davies, as directed by the Governor in Council asked the DIG (CID) to suggest the names of the revolutionary convicts with a statement showing the offences for which they had been convicted, the sentence awarded and a brief note showing their connection with the revolutionary movement with a view to transferring them to the Andamans. The DIG (CID) suggested the names of Yogendra Shukla, Basawon Singh (Sinha), Shyamdeo Narayan alias Ram Singh, Ishwar Dayal Singh, Kedar Mani Shukla, Mohit Chandra Adhikari and Ram Pratap Singh. Yogendra Shukla, Kedar Mani Shukla and Shyamdeo Narayan were transferred to the Andamans in December, 1932. In 1937, Yogendra Shukla was transferred to Hazaribagh Central Jail as a result of his 46 days of hunger strike. When Sri Krishna Sinha formed the first Congress ministry in 1937, he took up the cause of political prisoners and his ministry resigned on the issue on 15 February 1938. As a result, the Viceroy conceded the demands and Yogendra Shukla along with other political prisoners was released in March, 1938. After release from Kalapani Yogendra Shukla joined the Indian National Congress after his release and was elected vice-chairman of the Muzaffarpur District Congress Committee. He was also elected a member of the All India Congress Committee in 1938 but later joined the Congress Socialist Party at the instance of Jayaprakash Narayan. He was arrested in 1940, soon after he became a member of Central Committee of the All India Kisan Sabha in place of Swami Sahajanand Saraswati. Quit India Movement When Mahatma Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement in August, 1942, Yogendra Shukla scaled the wall of Hazaribagh Central Jail along with Jayaprakash Narayan, Suraj Narayan Singh, Gulab Chand Gupta, Ramnandan Mishra and Shaligram Singh with a view to starting underground movement for freedom. As Jayaprakash Narayan was ill then, Shukla walked a distance to Gaya with Jayaprakash Narayan on his shoulders, a distance of about 124 kilometres.Distance between Hazaribagh Central Jail and Gaya The British Government announced a reward of Rs. 5000 for the arrest of Shukla. He was arrested on 7 December 1942, at Muzaffarpur. The government believed that one day before his arrest Shukla had helped four prisoners escape from Muzaffarpur jail. They were Surajdeo Singh, Ram Babu Kalwar, Brahmanand Gupta and Ganesh Rai. Yogendra Shukla was lodged in Buxar Jail and kept in bar fetters for three years. In March 1944, he launched hunger-strike in the Buxar Jail. During and after Independence He was released in April, 1946. In 1958, he was nominated a member of the Bihar Legislative Council on behalf of the Praja Socialist Party and continued there till 1960. In 1960, he was taken seriously ill as a result of long years of prison life. He died on 19 November 1960.

It is open at all reasonable times and there is no entrance charge. Keills Chapel The name originates from the word , meaning chapel. The re-roofed structure contains an important collection of early stone sculpture, including six early Christian cross- slabs, around forty late medieval grave slabs recovered from the chapel or churchyard, and a Celtic cross which previously stood outside the chapel where a modern blank replacement now stands. The original has been moved inside the chapel to protect it from the elements. Keills Cross The complete and well-preserved late 8th-early 9th century cross is carved from local grey- green epidiorite. It is only decorated on one face, the sides and back being dressed smooth without further decoration. Its proportions are unusual, with very short side-arms broader than the shaft and upper limb. The latter shows the archangel St. Michael standing over a serpent (a symbol of triumph over the devil). The lower limb shows Christ on the Judgement Seat. He is holding a book, possibly the Bible or New Testament, symbolising mercy, in his left hand, and a flail in his right, symbolising judgement. There is a circular design at the crossing, with three round objects in the centre, which may symbolise the Holy Trinity. Around this are four animals representing the four evangelists.

In addition to documentaries, the festival also brings together world-class athletes, change makers and artists via interactive discussions, free community events, a gallery walk, an all-day symposium, outdoor programming and presentations. Mountainfilm aims to educate, inspire and motivate audiences. In 2000, Mountainfilm started touring its films and speakers internationally with Mountainfilm on Tour. Mountainfilm has since added Mountainfilm for Students, an educational component for schools across the country with free screenings of festival films that are supported by customized educational materials. Mountainfilm also funds Mountainfilm Commitment Grants, annual grants for filmmakers, photographers, artists and adventurers whose projects align with the organization‚Äôs mission to use the power of film, art and ideas to inspire audiences to create a better world.  The History of Mountainfilm  Mountainfilm began in 1979 when Telluride was completing its transition from a hard-rock gold and silver mining community to a destination resort and ski town. Lito Tejada-Flores, after screening his adventure and mountaineering film Fitzroy at the Trento festival in Italy, and Bill Kees, a local climber and avid outdoorsman, inaugurated the event. Over three nights, at the historic Sheridan Opera House, they screened a dozen films about mountain sports, mountain cultures and mountain issues. During the daytime, audience members took to the mountains for adventure themselves. The first festivals attracted leading names in mountaineering and exploration: Royal Robbins, Yvon Chouinard, David Breashears and others. With their help, the event became a tradition for a circle of pioneers in diverse fields ‚Äî from athletes and environmentalists to scientists and poets. Mountains soon became a metaphorical theme, and the festival expanded in size and recognition, its programming stretching into contemporary issues. The festival‚Äôs tagline is \\"celebrating indomitable spirit.\\"  Speakers  Mountainfilm has hosted such speakers as Bill McKibben, Chris Sharma, Wade Davis, Sandra Steingraber, Sir Edmund Hillary, Richard Holbrooke, Dianne Feinstein, Galen Rowell, George Schaller, Phil Borges, Frans Lanting, Lynn Hill, David Brower, Pete Athans, Timmy O'Neill, Subhankar Banerjee, David Breashears, Norman Vaughan, Martin Litton, James Balog, Maurice Herzog, Gretel Ehrlich, Timothy Treadwell, David James Duncan, Julia Butterfly Hill, John Grunsfeld, Angela Fisher, Rick Ridgeway and Carl Pope.

Kahan is the Elizabeth K. Dollard Professor of law at Yale Law School. His professional expertise is in the fields of criminal law and evidence, and he is known for his theory of cultural cognition. Education After attending a boarding school in Vermont, Kahan received a BA summa cum laude from Middlebury College in 1986, where he studied under Murray Dry. While at Middlebury, he spent his junior year at Lincoln College, Oxford. He then received a JD magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1989, where he learned Tort Law from Lewis Sargentich and Criminal Law from Charles Ogletree. While at Harvard Law School, he served as president of the Harvard Law Review for volume 102. Career After law school, Kahan served as a law clerk to Judge Harry T. Edwards of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (1989‚Äì90) and then to Justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court (1990‚Äì91). After clerking, he worked as an attorney for Mayer, Brown & Platt in Washington D.C. (1991‚Äì93). In 1993, Kahan joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School where he worked with Elena Kagan. He joined the Yale Law School faculty in 1999. At Yale, he is one of the instructors in the Law School's Supreme Court Advocacy Clinic and a professor of Criminal Law and Administration. He is a recurring Visiting Professor at Harvard Law School . Legal theory He accepts the central tenets of legal realism. As developed at Yale Law School in the 1920s and 1930s, legal realism was less interested in demonstrating that legal rules are formally indeterminate than to explain how lawyers nonetheless form such uniform and predictable understandings of what those rules entail. Karl Llewellyn attributed this ability to what he called \\"situation sense\\", an intuitive perceptive faculty borne of immersion in professional and cultural norms. Kahan argues that when lawyers exercise professional judgment, and perform their professional responsibilities, they affirm the authority and extend the vitality of the norms that construct society's professional situation sense. However, law is not merely a set of rigid rules robotically applied. There is a complex, additional element of moral agency. The content of the lawyers' situation sense is inevitably contingent and dynamic: professional norms ‚Äì and in turn the law itself ‚Äì evolve in response to the evaluations lawyers make of the decisions and actions of each other. The only test of whether some lawyer has reliable situation sense is to see whether other lawyers (including decisionmakers) agree with that lawyer's perceptions of how society's rules should be applied.Yale 2006 Commencement Address. Accessed May 15, 2008. The Cultural Cognition Project Kahan is best known for his work on the cultural theory of risk. This research delves into cultural cognition, which is the study of how individuals form beliefs about the amount of risk in certain situations based on their preconceived cultural group identities. Most of this work is supported by empirical and statistical analyses of group responses to pre-created hypotheticals. Project members use the methods of various disciplines‚Äîincluding social psychology, anthropology, communications, and political science‚Äîto chart the impact of this phenomenon and to identify the mechanisms through which it operates. The Project also has an explicit normative objective: to identify processes of democratic decisionmaking by which society can resolve culturally grounded differences in belief in a manner that is both congenial to persons of diverse cultural outlooks and consistent with sound public policymaking.Empirical Legal Studies. Accessed May 15, 2008. Selected works Shaming Sanctions Kahan believed shaming penalties are on the rise in American law, and are an effective alternative to traditional punishments. This is especially feasible and valuable for federal white collar offenders. He developed a theoretical model that connects the deterrent efficacy of such penalties to their power to signal the undesirable propensities of wrongdoers and the desirable propensities of citizens who shun wrongdoers. He believed the efficiency of such penalties is affected by their power to express publicly valued social meanings. However, he has renounced his previous defense made in article \\"What Do Alternative Sanctions Mean\\" for the shaming sanctions in his newer article \\"What's Really Wrong with Shaming Sanctions\\" since he considers the premise of his analysis flawed.(\\"I renounce my previous defense of shaming penalties. Sort of. In What Do Alternative Sanctions Mean, 63 U. Chi. L. Rev. 591\\") In this article, he also says that \\"Drawing on work that I‚Äôve done since then, I now acknowledge that the premise of this analysis was flawed. Ordinary citizens expect punishments not merely to condemn but to do so in ways that affirm rather than denigrate their core values. By ritualistically stigmatizing wrongdoers as transgressors of shared moral norms, shaming penalties grate against the sensibilities of persons who subscribe to egalitarian and individualistic worldviews.\\"What's Really Wrong with Shaming Sanctions Other points made in \\"What Do Alternative Sanctions Mean\\" which he has sort of renounced later: He also argues American jurisdictions have traditionally resisted fines and community service as alternatives to imprisonment, notwithstanding strong support for these sanctions among academics and reformers. Why? The answer is that these forms of punishment are expressively inferior to incarceration. The public expects punishment not only to deter crime and to impose deserved suffering, but also to make accurate statements about what the community values. Imprisonment has been and continues to be Americans' punishment of choice for serious offenses because of the resonance of liberty deprivation as a symbol of condemnation in our culture. Fines and community service either don't express condemnation as unambiguously as imprisonment, or express other valuations that Americans reject as false. He uses expressive theory to explain why the American public has consistently rejected proposals to restore corporal punishment, a form of discipline that offends egalitarian moral sensibilities; and why the public is now growing increasingly receptive to shaming punishments, which unlike conventional alternative sanctions signal condemnation unambiguously.What do Alternative Sanctions Mean?. Accessed May 15, 2008. Kahan garnered national attention for his research. He has been cited on NBC News' Today Show and in such publications as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal for his views on alternative sanctions.The Chicago Chronicle Profile on Dan Kahan. Accessed May 15, 2008. Gentle Nudges vs. Hard Shoves The resistance of law enforcers sometimes confounds the efforts of lawmakers to change social norms. Thus, as legislators expand liability for date rape, domestic violence, and drunk driving, police become less likely to arrest, prosecutors to charge, jurors to convict, and judges to sentence severely. The conspicuous resistance of these decisionmakers in turn reinforces the norms that lawmakers intended to change. Can this \\"sticky norms\\" pathology be effectively treated? It can be, if lawmakers apply \\"gentle nudges\\" rather than \\"hard shoves\\". When the law embodies a relatively mild degree of condemnation, the desire of most decisionmakers to discharge their civic duties will override their reluctance to enforce a law that attacks a widespread social norm. The willingness of most decisionmakers to enforce can initiate a self-reinforcing wave of condemnation, thereby allowing lawmakers to increase the severity of the law in the future without prompting resistance from most decisionmakers. Kahan presents a formal model of this strategy for norm reform, illustrates it with real-world examples, and identifies its normative and prescriptive implications.Gentle Nudges vs. Hard Shoves: Solving the Sticky Norms Problem. Accessed May 15, 2008. The Secret Ambition of Deterrence Kahan identifies the political and moral economies of deterrence theory in legal discourse. Drawing on an extensive social science literature, he shows that deterrence arguments in fact have little impact on citizens' views on controversial policies such as capital punishment, gun control, and hate crime laws. Citizens conventionally defend their positions in deterrence terms nonetheless only because the alternative is a highly contentious expressive idiom, which social norms, strategic calculation, and liberal morality all condemn. But not all citizens respond to these forces. Expressive zealots have an incentive to frame controversial issues in culturally partisan terms, thereby forcing moderate citizens to defect from the deterrence d√©tente and declare their cultural allegiances as well. Accordingly, deliberations permanently cycle between the disengaged, face-saving idiom of deterrence and the partisan, face-breaking idiom of expressive condemnation. These dynamics complicate the normative assessment of deterrence. By abstracting from contentious expressive judgments, deterrence arguments serve the ends of liberal public reason, which enjoins citizens to advance arguments accessible to individuals of diverse moral persuasions. But precisely because deterrence arguments denude the law of social meaning, the prominence of the deterrence idiom impedes progressives from harnessing the expressive power of the law to challenge unjust social norms. There is no stable discourse equilibrium between the deterrence and expressive idioms, either as a positive matter or a normative one.Secret Ambition of Deterrence. Accessed May 15, 2008.

It constitutes one of the largest contiguous forests in Azerbaijan, which is not interrupted by any settlement or pasture. The Hirkan National Park protects the humid subtropical and humid temperate forests in the area of the Lenkoran Lowland and the Talysh Mountains, sheltering many endemic plant and animal species. The ecosystem of the Hirkan National Park, belongs to the Caspian Hyrcanian (Girkan) mixed forests ecoregion, an area of lush deciduous broadleaved lowland and montane forests (subtropical and temperate rainforests) that completely cover the Talysh Mountains and partially cover the Lankaran Lowland. Climate The Hirkan National Park normally has very high humidity and precipitation throughout the year, averaging from 1,400 mm to 1,600 mm per year in the lowlands to 1,800 mm per year in the mountains. The maximum annual precipitation is the highest precipitation in Azerbaijan. The Hirkan National Park has a humid subtropical climate in the lowlands, an oceanic climate in the middle elevations and a humid continental climate on the mountain peaks. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of biota. Flora and fauna Flora This area preserves many endemic plants species, relicts of the Tertiary period which were not affected by Pliocene and Pleistocene glaciations. The Caspian Hyrcanian (Girkan) forests account for 150 endemic species of trees and bushes out of 435 species of trees and bushes. Some endemic tree species are, the Hyrcanian box tree (Buxus hyrcana), Caucasian pear (Pyrus communis subsp. caucasica), Lenkoran acacia (Albizia julibrissin), chestnut-leaved oak (Quercus castaneifolia), Caucasian oak (Quercus macranthera), Caucasian ash (Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. oxycarpa), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), Oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis), Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), Caucasian persimmon (Diospyros lotus), Caspian locust tree (Gleditsia caspica), Caucasian alder (Alnus subcordata), black alder (Alnus glutinosa subsp. barbata), white poplar (Populus alba) Caucasian wingnut (Pterocarya fraxinifolia), Persian ironwood (Parrotia persica), Caucasian zelkova (Zelkova carpinifolia), butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus), velvet maple (Acer velutinum), Cappadocian maple (Acer cappadocicum), wych elm (Ulmus glabra), Caucasian lime tree (Tilia dasystyla subsp. caucasica), wild cherry (Prunus avium), wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), among many others. Shrub species occurring in the area include the poet's laurel (Danae racemosa), Hyrcanian holly (Ilex hyrcana), greenbrier (Smilax excelsa), common ivy (Hedera helix), etc. Fauna Flamingos in Hirkan National Park There are several endemic subspecies of birds, of which the Caspian tit (Poecile hyrcanus) subspecies of the titmouse; the Caucasus pheasant (Phasianus colchicus colchicus) subspecies of the common pheasant of the Talysh Mountains are common. The Caspian tiger (Panthera tigris virgata) once roamed these mountains, but is now extinct. Other large mammals here are the Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor), lynx (Lynx lynx), brown bear (Ursus arctos), wild boar (Sus scrofa), wolf (Canis lupus), golden jackal (Canis aureus), jungle cat (Felis chaus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger (Meles meles), otter (Lutra lutra), etc. The Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) subspecies of the leopard, lives in the southern regions in Azerbaijan, primarily in the Talysh Mountains, Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhichevan. Despite occasional sightings, it was not clear whether leopards had been extinct in Azerbaijan by the late 1990s until a species was caught on camera in March, 2007 in the Hirkan National Park.

The Moscow Forest is the only preserved part of the Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests which covered most of the lowland, that was later cleared for agriculture.\\"Girkan Reserve\\" However, there is a reforestation program of the lowland, on a designated non-forested lot which is the only non-cultivated land on the plain, in order to (partially because the Lankaran Lowland is far too valuable for its agricultural productivity for Azerbaijan, to be given up for reforestation) restore the ecology to its previous forested state. This lot will become the second forest in the lowland after the Moscow Forest and once it is reforested, it will become an additional part of the Hirkan National Park in the lowland.Hirkan National Park Azerbaijan Home Page UNESCO Status Application For the purpose of including the Hirkan National Park and the Caspian Hyrcanian (Girkan) forests respectively into UNESCO's World Heritage Site list of cultural and natural heritage and Biosphere Reserves Programme, documents substantiated from the scientific point of view have been prepared and introduced to the UNESCO Secretariat.UNESCO - Ecological, Social and Economic Factors Forming the Basis of Plot Selection For Biosphere Reserve Organization of the Girkan State Reserve and the Caspian Hyrcanian (Girkan) forests Philately File:Stamps of Azerbaijan, 2013-1122-1125.jpg|Stamps of Azerbaijan, 2013 File:Stamps of Azerbaijan, 2013-1126-1129.jpg|Stamps of Azerbaijan, 2013 See also * Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests * Nature of Azerbaijan * National Parks of Azerbaijan * State Reserves of Azerbaijan * State Game Reserves of Azerbaijan References External links * Hirkan National Park Official Website - Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Azerbaijan Category:National parks of Azerbaijan Category:Forests of Azerbaijan Category:Alborz (mountain range) Category:Astara District Category:Lankaran District Category:Protected areas established in 2004 Category:2004 establishments in Azerbaijan Category:World Heritage Tentative List Category:IUCN Category II ","title":"Hirkan National Park"},{"id":"7151097","text":"Fannie Porter (February 12, 1873 ‚Äì c. 1940) was a well-known madam in 19th- century Texas, in the United States. She is best known for her association with famous outlaws of the day and for her popular San Antonio brothel. Career as a madam Porter was born in England and traveled to the United States around the age of one with her family. By age 15, she was working as a prostitute in San Antonio, Texas. By the age of 20, she had started her own brothel and became extremely popular for having a cordial and sincere attitude, choosing only the most attractive young women as her \\"girls\\", her requiring that her \\"girls\\" practice good hygiene, and for maintaining an immaculate personal appearance. Her brothel was located at the corner of Durango and San Saba streets, better known as the Sporting District. By 1895, her brothel in San Antonio was one of the more popular of the Old West. It had become known as a frequent stop off for outlaws. Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, Kid Curry, and other members of the Wild Bunch gang frequented her business. Della Moore, one of her \\"girls\\", became the girlfriend to Kid Curry, remaining with him until her arrest for passing money from one of his robberies (she was arrested, but acquitted, eventually returning to work for Porter once again). Lillie Davis, another of her \\"girls\\", became involved with outlaw and Wild Bunch member Will \\"News\\" Carver. She later claimed she had married Carver in Fort Worth before his death in 1901, but there are no records to verify the alleged marriage. It is possible that the Sundance Kid and his girlfriend Etta Place, whose true identity and eventual disappearance from history has long been a mystery, first met while she worked for Porter, but this never has been confirmed. Wild Bunch gang member Laura Bullion also is believed to have at times worked for Porter between 1898 and 1901. Porter was well respected for her discretion, always refusing to turn in a wanted outlaw to the authorities. She also was known for being extremely defensive of her \\"girls\\", insisting that any who mistreated them never return to her brothel. She generally employed anywhere from five to eight girls, all ranging in ages from 18 to 25, and all of whom lived and worked inside her brothel. Her business was popular with outlaws of the day as well as with lawmen, and she made sure that any lawmen who entered received the best treatment. William Pinkerton, of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, once paid her a visit. By the early 20th century, the tide had begun to turn against active, openly operating brothels. Porter had been arrested in 1888 and 1891 but it was the investigation into her affiliation with the Wild Bunch that led her to move her operations to her home in 1901. Eventually, she retired and faded from history. It is not known where she went after her retirement. Most agree that she retired semi-wealthy. Some stories indicate that she married a man of wealth, some indicate she retired into seclusion, and others indicate she returned to England. None of those are confirmed. Later rumors indicated that she lived until 1940, when she was killed in a car accident in El Paso, Texas. However, this also is not certain.

Statue of Enrico Toti in Rome. :‚ÄúHow many times at night were our projectors used only to illuminate the enemies that came out to help the wounded and bury the dead; we could have destroyed them, yet a sense of pity urged us to help them‚Äù :(Enrico Toti in a letter to home in 1916) Enrico Toti (20 August 1882 in Rome - 6 August 1916 in Monfalcone) was an Italian cyclist, patriot and hero of World War I. There is a street in the Italian Town of San Cesareo outside Rome that is called ‚ÄòVia Enrico Toti‚Äô it is possible after the hero. Life Enrico lost his left leg while working for Italian railways, at the age of 24. After his injury he became a cyclist. In 1911, riding on a bicycle with one leg, he cycled to Paris, and then through Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark, up to Finland and Lapland. From there, via Russia and Poland, he returned to Italy in June 1912. In January 1913 Toti started cycling again, this time in Egypt; from Alexandria, he reached the border with Sudan where the English authorities, considering the trail too dangerous, ordered him to end the journey, and sent him to Cairo where he came back to Italy. When war broke out between Italy and the Austrian Empire, Toti tried to volunteer for the Italian army but was not accepted due to his injury. Undaunted, he reached the frontline with his bicycle and managed to serve as an unpaid, unregistered, fully non-regulation \\"civilian volunteer\\" attached to several units. Forced to leave the combat zone and return home by the Carabinieri (Military Police), Toti stubbornly returned to the front and finally managed to join (still unofficially) the 3rd Bersaglieri Bicycle Battalion. He was killed in the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo. Fatally wounded in a clash, he hurled his crutch at the enemy. Before falling on the ground he shouted: \\"Nun moro io!\\" (romanesco vernacular for \\"I do not die!\\"). He was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor (Italy's highest award for valour), one of the relatively few civilians to have this honour bestowed on them.

Description and history  The house is owned by the City of Punta Gorda, Florida and is leased to the Charlotte County Chamber of Commerce. It is open to the public. It was deemed significant for reflecting Queen Anne style architecture, asserted to be rare in South Florida, and for association with businessman and politician Augustus C. Freeman. Freeman owned a hardware store and a citrus grove, among other ventures. He served in various city government positions from 1896 to 1904, including as mayor during the later four or five years. During the 1902 mayoral campaign he was described as \\"'Industrious, frugal and obliging... well-to-do, but probably not a millionaire'\\". The land was purchased by Freeman in 1903 from Albert Gilchrist, who later became Governor of the state, and there has been a local legend that the house belonged to him, but in fact it was built for Freeman. The house was moved two blocks in 1985 before a restoration began, but the move was not deemed to have disturbed historic integrity.

The Allied invasion of North Africa had provoked the Germans into invading the , neutral according to the Armistice of 1940. The Vichy Secretary of the Navy, Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan, defected to the Allies, who were gaining increasing support from servicemen and civilians. His replacement, Admiral Gabriel Auphan, guessed correctly that the Germans were aiming to seize the large fleet at Toulon, and ordered them to be scuttled. The Germans began Operation Anton but the French naval crews used deceit to delay them until the scuttling was complete. Anton was judged a failure, with the capture of 39 small ships, while the French destroyed 77 vessels; several submarines escaped to French North Africa. It marked the end of Vichy France as a credible naval power.  Context  After the Fall of France and the Armistice of 22 June 1940, France was divided in two zones, one occupied by the Germans, and the (Free Zone). Officially, both zones were administered by the Vichy regime. The armistice stipulated that the French fleet would be largely disarmed and confined to its harbours, under French control. The Allies were concerned that the fleet, which included some of the most advanced warships of the time, might fall into German hands and the British attacked the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir on 3 July 1940 and at the Battle of Dakar on 23 September 1940. On 8 November 1942 the Allies invaded French North Africa in Operation Torch. It may be that General Dwight Eisenhower, with the support of President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, made a secret agreement with Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan, commander of Vichy Naval forces, that he would be given control of French North Africa if he defected to the Allies. An alternative view is that Darlan was an opportunist and switched sides for self-advancement, thus becoming titular controller of French North Africa. Following the Allied invasion of French North Africa, Adolf Hitler ordered Case Anton, the occupation of Vichy France and reinforced German forces in Africa.  Prelude   Political aspect  From 11 November 1942 negotiations took place between Germany and Vichy France. The settlement was that Toulon should remain a \\"stronghold\\" under Vichy control and defended against the Allies and \\"French enemies of the government of the Marechal\\". Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, commander of the , believed that French Navy officers would fulfil their armistice duty not to let the ships fall in the hands of a foreign nation. Raeder was led to believe that the German aim was to use anti-British sentiment amongst the French sailors to have them side with the Italians, while Hitler was really preparing to seize the fleet. Hitler's plan was to have German sailors capture the French ships and turn them over to Italy; German officers privy to this plan were critical but their objections were ignored. Orders to implement the plan were given on 19 November. On 11 November, as German and Italian troops encircled Toulon, the Vichy Secretary of the Navy, Admiral Gabriel Auphan, ordered Admirals Jean de Laborde and Andr√© Marquis to: # Oppose, without spilling of blood, the entry of foreign troops in any of the establishments, airbases and buildings of the Navy # Similarly oppose entry of foreign troops aboard ships of the Fleet and find settlements by means of local negotiation # If the former proved impossible, to scuttle the ships Initial orders were to scuttle the ships by capsizing them but engineers, thinking of recovering the ships after the war, managed to have the orders changed to sinking on an even keel. On 15 November, Laborde met with Marshal Philippe P√©tain and Auphan. In private, Auphan tried to persuade Laborde to set sail and join with the Allies; Laborde refused to obey anything short of a formal order of the government and Auphan resigned shortly after.  Technical and tactical aspect  Positions of the main ships during the operation On the French side, as a token of goodwill towards the Germans, coastal defences were strengthened to safeguard Toulon from an attack from the sea by the Allies. These preparations included preparations for scuttling the fleet, in case a landing attempt by the Allies succeeded. French forces were commanded by Admiral Jean de Laborde (chief of the \\"High sea fleet\\", composed of the 38 most modern and powerful warships) and Admiral Andr√© Marquis (pr√©fet maritime, commanding a total of 135 ships, either in armistice custody or under repair). Under the armistice, French ships were supposed to have their fuel tanks almost empty; in fact, through falsification of reports and tampering with gauges, the crews had managed to store enough fuel to reach North Africa. One of the cruisers, , was in drydock, helpless. After the remnants of the French Army were required by the Germans to disband, French sailors had to man coast defence artillery and anti-aircraft gun themselves, which made it impossible swiftly to gather the crews and have the ships quickly under way. Crews were initially hostile to the Allied invasion but out of the general anti-German sentiment and as rumours about Darlan's defection circulated, this stance evolved towards backing De Gaulle. The crews of , , and , notably, started chanting \\"Long live De Gaulle! Set sail!\\" In the afternoon of 12 November, Admiral Darlan further escalated the tension by calling for the fleet to defect and join the Allies. Vichy military authorities lived in fear of a coup de main organised by the British or by the Free French. The population of Toulon was in the main favourable to the Allies; the soldiers and officers were hostile to the Italians, seen as \\"illegitimate victors\\" and duplicitous, and defiant of the Germans. The fate of the fleet, in particular, was seen to be doubtful. Between the 11th and the 26th, numerous arrests and expulsions took place. The French admirals, Laborde and Marquis, ordered their subordinates to take a pledge of allegiance to the regime (two of the senior officers, Humbertand and capitaine de vaisseau Pothuau, refused). The crews were first kept aboard their ships, and when they were allowed ashore the Service d'ordre l√©gionnaire monitored all places suspected to be targeted by the Resistance.  Operation Lila  The objective of Operation Lila was to capture the units of the French fleet at Toulon intact, and was carried out by the 7th Panzer Division, augmented with units from other divisions. Four combat groups including two armoured groups and a motorcycle battalion from 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich were entrusted with the mission. To prevent the French naval units scuttling themselves, Marinedetachment Gumprich was assigned to one of the groups. The Operation was initiated by the Germans on 19 November 1942, to be completed by 27 November. German forces were to enter Toulon from the east, capturing Fort Lamalgue, headquarters of Admiral Marquis and Mourillon arsenal; and from the west, capturing the main arsenal and the coastal defenses. German naval forces were cruising off the harbor to engage any ships attempting to flee, and laid naval mines. The combat groups entered Toulon at 4 a.m. on 27 November and made for the harbour, meeting only weak and sporadic resistance. At 4 a.m. the Germans entered Fort Lamalgue and arrested Marquis, but failed to prevent his chief- of-staff, Contre-Admiral Robin, from calling the chief of the arsenal, Contre- Admiral Dornon. The attack came as a complete surprise to the Vichy officers, but Dornon transmitted the order to scuttle the fleet to Admiral Laborde aboard the flagship Strasbourg. Laborde was taken aback by the German operation, but transmitted orders to prepare for scuttling, and to fire on any unauthorised personnel approaching the ships. Twenty minutes later, German troops entered the arsenal and started machine-gunning the French submarines. Some of the submarines set sail to scuttle in deeper water. left her moorings, snuck out of the harbour and dove at 5:40 a.m., escaping to Algiers. The German main force got lost in the arsenal and was behind schedule by one hour; when they reached the main gates of the base, the sentries pretended to need paperwork so as to delay the Germans without engaging in an open fight. At 5:25 a.m., German tanks finally rolled through, and Strasbourg immediately transmitted the order \\"Scuttle! Scuttle! Scuttle!\\" by radio, visual signals and dispatch boat. French crews evacuated, and scuttling parties started preparing demolition charges and opening sea valves on the ships. The stern of the cruiser At 6:45 a.m. fighting broke out around Strasbourg and Foch, killing a French officer and wounding five sailors. When naval guns started engaging the German tanks, the Germans attempted to negotiate; a German officer demanded that Laborde surrender his ship, to which the admiral answered that the ship was already sunk. As Strasbourg settled on the bottom, her captain ordered the ignition of the demolition charges, which destroyed the armament and vital machinery, as well as igniting her fuel stores. Strasbourg was a total loss. A few minutes later the cruiser Colbert exploded. The German party attempting to board the cruiser heard the explosions and tried to persuade her crew that scuttling was forbidden under the armistice provisions. However, the demolition charges were detonated, and the ship burned for twenty days. Meanwhile, the captain of the cruiser ordered his ship capsized and demolition charges set. German troops requested permission to come aboard; when this was denied, they did not attempt to board. The ship sank and exploded, burning for seven days. German troops forcibly boarded the cruiser , put her crew out of the way, and closed her open sea valves. The ship's captain, Moreau, ordered the scuttling charges in the main turrets to be lit with shortened fuses and when they exploded and fires took hold, Moreau ordered the final evacuation. French and Germans alike fled the vessel. Explosions from the ship's torpedo stores destroyed the vessel, which burned for ten days. Panzertruppen watch the burning The cruiser Jean de Vienne, in drydock, was boarded by German troops, who disarmed the demolition charges, but the open sea valves flooded the ship. She sank, blocking the drydock. In another drydock, the captain of the damaged , which had been heavily damaged by the British in the attack on Mers-el-K√©bir, at first refused orders to scuttle, but was persuaded by his colleague in the nearby cruiser to follow suit. The crew opened the holes caused by British torpedo attacks to sink the ship, and demolition charges destroyed her vital machinery. As Dunkerque exploded, La Galissonni√®re reproduced the manoeuvre executed by Jean de Vienne. Officers of the battleship and the seaplane carrier managed to delay German officers with a small talk until their ships were completely sunk. Similar scenes occurred with the destroyers and submarines. The Germans eventually seized three disarmed destroyers, four badly damaged submarines, three civilian ships, and the remains of two battleships of no value, the semi-dreadnought and the disarmed former , renamed Oc√©an in 1936.  Aftermath  Toulon in late 1944 Operation Lila was a failure. The French destroyed 77 vessels, including 3 battleships, 7 cruisers, 15 destroyers, 13 torpedo boats, 6 sloops, 12 submarines, 9 patrol boats, 19 auxiliary ships, 1 school ship, 28 tugs, and 4 cranes. Thirty-nine small ships were captured, most of them sabotaged and disarmed. Some of the major ships were ablaze for several days, and oil polluted the harbour so badly that it would not be possible to swim there for two years. Several submarines ignored orders to scuttle and chose to defect to French North Africa: Casabianca and Marsouin reached Algiers, Glorieux reached Oran. Iris reached Barcelona. V√©nus was scuttled in the entrance of Toulon harbour. One surface ship, Leonor Fresnel, managed to escape and reach Algiers. General Charles de Gaulle heavily criticised the Vichy admirals for not ordering the fleet to flee to Algiers. The Vichy regime lost its last token of power, as well as its credibility with the Germans, with the fleet. While the German Naval War Staff were disappointed, Adolf Hitler considered that the elimination of the French fleet sealed the success of Case Anton. Most of the light cruisers were salvaged by the Italians, either to restore them as fighting ships or for scrap. The cruisers Jean de Vienne and La Galissonni√®re were renamed FR11 and FR12, respectively, but their repair was prevented by Allied bombing and their use would have been unlikely, given the Italians' chronic shortage of fuel. Even the light destroyer (renamed FR37) and another four of the same class as Le Hardi were salvaged: FR32 (ex-Corsaire), FR33 (ex-Ep√©e), FR34 (ex-Lansquenet), FR35 (ex- Fleuret). The main guns from the scuttled battleship Provence were later removed and used in a former French turret battery at Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer, guarding the approaches to Toulon, to replace original fortress guns, sabotaged by their French crews. Mounting four guns, in 1944 this fortification duelled with numerous Allied battleships for over a week before being silenced during Operation Dragoon.

It is based on his observations of various classrooms in the public school systems of East St. Louis, Chicago, New York City, Camden, Cincinnati, and Washington D.C.. His observations take place in both schools with the lowest per capita spending on students and the highest, ranging from just over $3,000 in Camden, New Jersey to a maximum expenditure of up to $15,000 in Great Neck, Long Island. In his visits to these areas, Kozol illustrates the overcrowded, unsanitary and often understaffed environment that is lacking in basic tools and textbooks for teaching. He cites the large proportions of minorities in the areas with the lowest annual budgets, despite the higher taxation rate on individuals living in poverty within the school district. Kozol cites various historical cases regarding lawsuits filed against school districts in East Orange, Camden, Irvington and Jersey City in which judges have sided with the children and concerned locals in a given district instead of adhering to state law concerning the taxation and distribution of funding. He additionally goes into detail comparing the current conditions poor, minority children are expected to learn in, and the findings of the historical case Brown v. Board of Education, and Plessy v. Ferguson. He also mentions other such historical cases in which the outcomes have supported what he views to be an unjust system of funds distribution and taxation in Milliken v. Bradley, San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, and through the overturning of State Supreme Court decisions in both Michigan and Texas by the Supreme Court of the United States. Kozol argues that racial segregation is still alive and well in the American educational system, due to the gross inequalities that result from unequal distribution of funds collected through both property taxes and funds distributed by the State in an attempt to \\"equalize\\" the expenditures of schools.

It is the fifteenth novel in Zola's Rougon-Macquart series. The action takes place in a rural community in the Beauce, an area in central France west of Paris. The novel is connected to others in the series by the protagonist, Jean Macquart, whose childhood in the south of France was recounted in La Fortune des Rougon, and who goes on to feature prominently in the later novel La D√©b√¢cle. Plot introduction La Terre describes the steady disintegration of a family of agricultural workers in Second Empire France, in the years immediately before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. It offers a vivid description of the hardships and brutality of rural life in the late nineteenth century. Plot summary The novel takes place in the final years of the Second Empire. Jean Macquart, an itinerant farm worker, has come to Rognes, a small village in La Beauce, where he works as a day labourer. He had been a corporal in the French Army, a veteran of the Battle of Solferino. He begins to court a local girl, Fran√ßoise Mouche, who lives in the village with her sister Lise. Lise is married to Buteau, a young man from the village, who is attracted to both sisters. Buteau's father, the elderly farmer Fouan, has decided to sign a contract known as a donation entre vifs (literally: \\"gift between living people\\"), whereby his three children, Fanny Delhomme (married to a hard- working and respected farmer), Hyacinthe (aka \\"Jesus Christ\\", a poacher and layabout), and Buteau will inherit their father's estate early; they agree to pay their parents a pension in return. The property is painstakingly measured and divided up between the three children, as the Civil Code of 1804 dictated. As stated by the French Civil Code of 1804 under the section \\"Donations and Testaments,\\" any one may donate their land to persons older than the age of sixteen, especially between family members, without penalty. Women could allocate land or property in this way, as long as she was granted the permission by her husband. Almost as soon as the contract is signed, Buteau begins to resent the pension, and quickly refuses to pay it. In the house Lise shares with her sister (the property having been shared between them on the death of their late father), Buteau begins a campaign of sexual advances towards his sister-in-law, which she attempts to repel. Midway through the novel, Fouan's wife dies and, since it seems wasteful for Fouan to retain their marital home, the property is sold, and Fouan goes to live with Fanny and her husband. While Fanny is scrupulously respectful of the conditions of the donations entre vifs, she nevertheless make it clear that she resents his presence. Fouan eventually moves to live with his son \\"Jesus Christ\\" who shares a shack with his daughter \\"La Trouille\\", a put-upon dogsbody. Under \\"Jesus Christ's\\" influence, Fouan's self-respect dwindles: while previously law-abiding, he now joins his son on poaching expeditions and takes part in Hyacinthe's favourite evening activity, farting contests. Eventually, however, Hyacinthe's abusive drunkenness is directed against Fouan, who leaves to take up residence with Buteau and Lise. Living with her sister and Buteau, Fran√ßoise is the victim of Buteau's sexual overtures. Lise, jealous of Fran√ßoise, insists that her sister is behaving in a deliberately provocative way. When Fran√ßoise turns 21 years old, she becomes entitled to her inheritance and she decides to leave the family home, demanding that Buteau and Lise buy out her share of the house, which the couple cannot afford to do. Fran√ßoise marries Jean and inherits her share of the family lands and home, infuriating her sister and Buteau. Fran√ßoise is now pregnant with Jean's child, and in a shocking scene, Buteau and Lise set upon Fran√ßoise when she is alone in the fields at harvest time. Lise restrains her sister while she is raped by Buteau, then pushes her onto a sickle, wounding her in the belly and killing her unborn child. The two flee the scene. While Fran√ßoise is still conscious when she is found, her family pride leads her to refuse to name Lise and Buteau; she claims instead that her injury was the result of an accident, and dies shortly after. Back in the Buteau home, the greedy couple turn their attention to Fouan, whose obstinacy in remaining alive has become a serious financial drain. One night while Fouan is asleep, they steal into his bedroom and smother him; finding he is still alive, they set fire to him, while arranging the scene to look like an accident (their story is accepted by the local community). The Buteaus refuse to pay Jean the money for Fran√ßoise's share of the family home, which is now rightfully his as her next-of-kin. Horrified by his suspicions regarding both his wife's and Fouan's deaths, and by the heartlessness of those around him, Jean returns to his wandering, and leaves the region for good. As he leaves, he passes the freshly dug burial mounds of Fran√ßoise and Fouan, and the ripe corn in the harvest fields. Characters The novels contains about 100 characters. Many have multiple names and extended family connections. The novel centers on the Fouans, a 300-year-old peasant farming family \\"dynasty\\", and an itinerant carpenter, Jean Macquart, who also appears in two other Zola novels. Major characters: *Badeuil, Charles - married Laure Fouan, and went to live at Chartres. He tried commerce without much success, and, haunted by a desire for rapid fortune, acquired a house of prostitution which had fallen into bad repute through mismanagement. *Badeuil, Madame Laure - wife of Charles, was the youngest daughter of Joseph Casimir Fouan. She was the sister of La Grande, of Padre Fouan, and of Michel Fouan, known as Mouche. When her father's estate was divided, she got no land, but received an indemnity in money instead. After she and her husband acquired the prostitute establishment in Chartres, she assisted ably in its management. *Badeuil, Estelle - daughter of Charles and Madame Badeuil, was educated by the Sisters of the Visitation at Chateaudun, and at eighteen was married to Hector Vaucogne, by whom she had one daughter, Elodie. *B√©cu - gamekeeper and bell-ringer at Rognes, was a man of fifty years of age who had at one time been in the army. He was an intense Bonapartist, and pretended that he had met the Emperor. Himself a confirmed drunkard, he was on friendly terms with Hyacinthe Fouan, whose poaching expeditions he overlooked. *Bouteroue, Hilarion - second child of Vincent Bouteroue, and grandson of Marianne Fouan (La Grande). Hilarion, who was of weak intellect, was looked after from childhood by his sister Palmyre, who wore herself out in his service. *Bouteroue, Palmyre - sister of Hilarion, worked like a slave to support her brother, and died completely worn out by toil and hardship at the age of thirty-five. *Buteau - second son of P√®re Fouan ; brother of Hyacinthe (\\"Jesus Christ\\") and of Fanny Delhomme ; cousin and husband of Lise Mouche ; father of Jules and Laure. He was a true son of the soil, knowing nothing of the world beyond the narrow district in which he was born, and possessing that fierce passion for the land which is the characteristic of so many peasants. *Ch√©deville, De - deputy for Eure-et-Loir under the Empire. He was an old beau who had flourished in the reign of Louis Philippe. His political career was cut short by a scandal which gave offense at the Tuileries, and he was defeated by Rochefontaine, who was nominated by Government as the official candidate. *Cognet, Jacqueline, alias La Cognette - daughter of Cognet. She went to La Borderie at the age of twelve years, and before long had several lovers. She made her fortune, however, by resisting her master, Alexandre Hourdequin, for six months, and when she ultimately became his mistress she had made her position so secure that he was afterwards unable to part with her. *Delhomme - was the son-in-law of P√®re Fouan, whose daughter Fanny he married. He was the owner of a small farm, which he managed so well that he became one of the richest of the peasant proprietors at Rognes. *Delhomme, Madame, also known as Fanny Fouan - wife of Delhomme. At first kind, she became hardened, and eventually the cleanliness of her house became a mania with her. *Fouan, Hyacinthe, also known as Jesus Christ - the elder son of P√®re Fouan and Rose Maliverne, his wife. He was an idler and drunkard, who, when he had left the army, after having seen service in Africa, had taken to tramp the fields, refusing to do any regular work, but living by theft and poaching, as though he were still looting a trembling nation of Bedouins. *Fouan, Joseph Casimir - the father of Marianne, Louis, Michel, and Laure. Born in 1766, he belonged to a family of peasant proprietors which for centuries had owned land, in varying quantities, in the neighborhood of Rognes. They were originally serfs of the Roques-Bouqucval family. Bit by bit they acquired their land, until, when the Revolution of 1789 arrived, the Fouan of that day, Joseph Casimir, was the owner of twenty-one acres ‚Äî the conquest of four centuries from the seigneurial territory. When, in 1793, the rest of the estate was declared national property and sold in lots by auction, he was too timid to purchase any, and had the mortification to see La Borderie sold to Isidore Hourdequin, a citizen of Chateaudun, for a fifth of its value. When he became old he divided his twenty-one acres between three of his family, Marianne, Louis, and Michel, and gave a corresponding sum of money to his younger daughter Laure, who had been brought up as a seamstress and was in service at Chateaudun. *Fouan, Laure - younger daughter of the preceding. See Madame Charles Badeuil. *Fouan, Louis - known as P√®re Fouan. He was the son of Joseph Casimir Fouan, and married Rose Maliverne, by whom he had three children, Hyacinthe, Buteau, and Fanny. He received seven acres of land from his father, and his wife brought him twelve acres more. This land he cultivated well, and with a passion for the soil, as such, which amounted to frenzy. It alone had his love, and his wife and children trembled before him under a rude despotism. At seventy years of age he was still healthy, but his limbs were failing, and he reluctantly decided to divide his land between his children. He retained his house and garden, which had come to him with his wife, and his family undertook to pay him a rent for the land handed over to them. Upon this along with a nest-egg of three hundred francs per annum, known to no one, the old people would be able to live comfortably. *Fouan, Madame Rose - wife of P√®re Fouan and mother of Hyacinthe, Buteau, and Fanny. She worked hard on the farm, rising first and going to bed last. *Fouan, Olympe, also known as La Trouille - daughter of Hyacinthe. Her mother, who was a tramp, ran off when the child was three years old, leaving her to grow up as best she could. She was passionately fond of geese, of which she had a large flock. *Grande, La - elder daughter of Joseph Casimir Fouan, and sister of P√®re Fouan, Michel Mouche, and Laure Badeuil. *Hourdequin, Alexandre - born 1804, was the only son of Isidore Hourdequin. He studied at the college of Chateaudun, but made little progress, as his only interest was in farming, for which he had an absolute passion. On the death of his father he became master of La Borderie, which he cultivated on the latest principles of agriculture, spending large sums upon it. He married a sister of Bailliehache, the notary, who brought him a considerable sum, which also went into the land. His wife died in a few years, leaving him with two children, a son named Leon, who to his great disappointment became a soldier, and a daughter who died young. In spite of these misfortunes he retained all his passion for the land, and in it he gradually sunk all his fortune, getting little from it in return. A liaison with Jacqueline Cognet, followed, and she gradually acquired complete influence over him. *Hourdequin, Leon - son of Alexandre Hourdequin. He had an intense hatred of the soil and became a soldier, being promoted Captain after Solferino. He did not visit his home more than once a year, and was much annoyed to discover the liaison between his father and Jacqueline Cognet. *Lengaigne - a dealer in tobacco and tavern-keeper at Rognes. He cultivated a small piece of land, while his wife weighed tobacco and looked after the cellar. He also shaved and cut the hair of the village. He has a wife, a daughter Suzanne and a son Victor. *Macquart, Jean - born 1831, son of Antoine Macquart, was apprenticed to a carpenter. A quiet, industrious lad, Jean's father took advantage of his simple nature and made him give up his whole earnings to assist in keeping him in idleness. Like his sister Gervaise, he ran off soon after the death of his mother (see La Fortune des Rougon). He entered the army, and, after seven years of soldiering was discharged in 1859. When he had left the ranks he turned up at Bazoches-le-Doyen with a comrade, a joiner like himself ; and he resumed his occupation with the latter's father, a master carpenter in the village. But his heart was no longer in his work, and having been sent to La Borderie to make some repairs, he stayed on to assist at the harvest, and eventually became a regular farm servant. He was not popular, however, with the peasants, who resented his having had a trade before he came back to the soil. He became acquainted at Rognes with Mouche and his daughters, Lise and Fran√ßoise, and eventually married the latter, in spite of the determined opposition of her brother-in-law, Buteau. Notwithstanding his marriage, he remained a stranger, and, after the death of his wife, went away, leaving everything in the hands of her relatives. The war with Prussia had just broken out, and Jean, disgusted with his life, again enlisted in the service of his country. (see further story in La D√©b√¢cle and Le Docteur Pascal). *Macqueron - a grocer and tavern-keeper at Rognes. He was a municipal councilor, and deputy Mayor. Having succeeded in undermining Hourdequin's position as Mayor, Macqueron succeeded him. His wife is Coelina and has a daughter Berthe. *Mouche, Le P√®re - the nickname of Michel Fouan, the third son of Joseph Casimir Fouan, and brother of La Grande, P√®re Fouan, and Laure Badeuil. When his father's estate was divided, he received the family dwelling house and some land, but was dissatisfied with his share and continued to accuse his brother and sister, though forty years had elapsed, of having robbed him when the lots were drawn. *Mouche, Fran√ßoise - youngest daughter of Michel Fouan, alias Mouche. Her mother died early, and she was brought up by her sister Lise, to whom she was devotedly attached. She had a passion for justice, and when she had said \\"that is mine and that is yours\\", she would have been prepared to go to the stake in support of her rights. *Mouche, Lise - elder daughter of P√®re Mouche, and sister of the preceding. She had a son to her cousin Buteau, who, however, did not marry her for three years afterwards, when the death of her father made her heiress to some land. *Rochefontaine - proprietor of a large factory at Chateaudun. He was desirous of serving as a Deputy, but did not secure the support of the Government, and, standing as an independent candidate, was defeated. Later, in consequence of the disgrace of M. de Chedeville, he became the official candidate, and in spite of a brusqueness which made him unpopular, he was elected. *Soulas - an old shepherd at La Borderie, where he had been for half a century. At sixty- five he had saved nothing, having been eaten up by a drunken wife, \\"whom at last he had the pleasure of burying.\\" He had few friends except his two dogs, Emperor and Massacre, and he especially hated Jacqueline Cognet. Major themes In this novel, Zola attempted to show some of the consequences of the division of rural estates in nineteenth-century France. The laws which provided for this, which were enshrined in the Civil Code of 1804 but owed their initiative to the Revolution, were extremely controversial throughout the 19th century. La Terre picks up on a number of contemporaneous obsessions regarding the decline of France under the influence of the Civil Code, including lack of respect for father figures (hence the parricide which concludes the novel) and voluntary sterility to avoid excessive division of estates between numerous heirs (hence the infamous scene of \\"onanism\\", in which Fran√ßoise and Jean practise coitus interruptus to avoid conceiving a child). But the novel also deals with more timeless themes: the parallel with the story of Shakespeare's King Lear emphasises the horror of aging and the physical and mental reduction which accompanies it. Above all, the story plays upon the cyclical nature of life and death, contrasting the unending passage of the seasons with the trivial strife of mankind, a contrast encapsulated in the novel's final sentence: \\"Deaths, seed, and the bread grew out of the earth\\" (\\"Des morts, des semences, et le pain poussait de la terre\\"). Literary significance Zola's novel is one of the most graphically violent and, to a lesser extent, sexually explicit novels of the nineteenth century, and caused considerable controversy at the time of its publication. In it, Zola's efforts to expose the unpleasant underside of his contemporary society reached its apogee; none of the other Rougon-Macquart novels features such sensational material. The publication of an English translation of La Terre in 1888 led to the prosecution for obscenity of the publisher, Henry Vizetelly.

It is known in English as Portage due to its location along the portage route between Babine Lake and Stuart Lake. Yekooche is a small community reserve. As of March 2019, there are 236 band members, 98 of whom live on the Yekooche reserves. Yekooche territory adjoins or encompasses Babine, Cunningham and Whitefish Lakes. These locales are used to hunt and to gather winter food for families. The people of Yekooche are Dakelh and speak the Stuart Lake dialect of the Carrier language. Due to their proximity to Lake Babine territory, they have traditionally been bilingual in Babine- Witsuwit'en. History Yekoochet'en people have lived in the region of Cunningham Lake for thousands of years. In fact, the Yekooche people's very name derives from the area‚ÄîYe Koo refers to Yeko Bun (Cunningham Lake) and Che describes the tail end of Nankut Creek. Yekooche First nation was one of the five communities that made up the Tl'azt'en Nation band, from which it separated in 1994. Economy Yekooche First Nation's main economic development project is the forestry program. Currently, the majority of people residing in Yekooche seek out social assistance programmes such as Work Opportunity Program, TESI and Basic Needs. Many young families are forced to leave Yekooche in search of employment and education opportunities. Yekooche First Nation has a band office, a health clinic, a resource house, a church, a graveyard, an elementary school, and about 50 houses. The Elementary school consists of the head start program, adult basic education, Carrier language courses, and Kindergarten to grade seven. The school has teacherages to allow the 3 school teachers to reside in Yekooche during the week. Carrier Sekani Family Services Although Yekooche First Nation is not part of the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council, it is part of Carrier Sekani Family Services. Yekooche First Nation and CSFS have an agreement for the health programme, whereby CSFS provides Yekooche with healthcare services including a nurse, dental care practitioners, doctor appointments, medical travel funds, workshops, clinic maintenance, etc. Negotiations Yekooche First Nation started its treaty negotiations in 1995. The treaty team negotiated an Agreement in Principle in 2005, which the Nation agreed to. Yekooche First Nation is currently in Stage 5 of the British Columbia Treaty Process.

It is also used in a junk rig. There are a great many variations on the snotter arrangement, and some more fastidious authors have referred to it as a snouter or snorter. The origin of the nautical term is obscure. Hauling on the snotter sets the tension in the spar and thus governs how the sail is set. On very small boats, typically with a single boomless spritsail, the snotter is a rope with eyes spliced into it, and is merely hooked into the fore end of the sprit and then jammed up the mast to force the upper end of the sprit into a pocket in the sail.  Spritsail  There are boomed spritsails, loose-footed spritsails and boomless spritsails.  Sprit Booms  The most common sprit-boom is found on a sprit-boomed leg-of-mutton sail. Sprit booms have been combined with a leech spar called a club; they have been used on foresails, like the jib. Some sailors have used a sprit boom on the standing lug sail.

As a thought experiment, the phenomenon is usually referred to as Molyneux's problem. The first published human case was reported in 1728 by the surgeon William Cheselden. Patients who experience dramatic recovery from blindness experience significant to total agnosia, having serious confusion with their visual perception. As a thought experiment The phenomenon has often been presented in empiricism as a thought experiment, in order to describe the knowledge gained from senses, and question the correlation between different senses. John Locke, an 18th-century philosopher, speculated that if a blind person developed vision, he would not at first connect his idea of a shape with the sight of a shape. That is, if asked which was the cube and which was the sphere, he would not be able to do so, or even guess. The question was originally posed to him by philosopher William Molyneux, whose wife was blind: > Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to > distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the > same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the > cube, which is the sphere. Suppose then the cube and the sphere placed on a > table, and the blind man made to see: query, Whether by his sight, before he > touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which > the cube? To which the acute and judicious proposer answers: 'Not. For > though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, and how a cube, > affects his touch; yet he has not yet attained the experience, that what > affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so...' In 1709, in A New Theory of Vision, George Berkeley also concluded that there was no necessary connection between a tactile world and a sight world‚Äîthat a connection between them could be established only on the basis of experience. He speculated: > the objects to which he had hitherto used to apply the terms up and down, > high and low, were such as only affected or were in some way perceived by > touch; but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas, perfectly > distinct and different from the former, and which can in no sort make > themselves perceived by touch (sect. 95). This thought experiment (it was a thought experiment at the time) outlines the debate between rationalism and empiricism; to what degree our knowledge of the world comes from reason or experience. Early cases There are many stories or anecdotes of the phenomenon, preceding the first documented case, including one from the year 1020, of a man of thirty operated upon in Arabia. Before the first known human cases, some tests were done rearing animals in darkness, to deny them vision for months or years, then discover what they see when given light. A. H. Reisen found severe behavioural losses in such experiments; but they might have been due to degeneration of the retina. The first known case of published recovery from blindness is in 1728, of a blind 13-year-old boy by William Cheselden. Cheselden presented the celebrated case of the boy of thirteen who gained his sight after removal of the lenses rendered opaque by cataract from birth. Despite his youth, the boy encountered profound difficulties with the simplest visual perceptions. Described by Cheselden: > When he first saw, he was so far from making any judgment of distances, that > he thought all object whatever touched his eyes (as he expressed it) as what > he felt did his skin, and thought no object so agreeable as those which were > smooth and regular, though he could form no judgment of their shape, or > guess what it was in any object that was pleasing to him: he knew not the > shape of anything, nor any one thing from another, however different in > shape or magnitude; but upon being told what things were, whose form he knew > before from feeling, he would carefully observe, that he might know them > again;An Account of Some Observations Made by a Young Gentleman, Who Was > Born Blind, or Lost His Sight so Early, That He Had no Remembrance of Ever > Having Seen, and Was Couch'd between 13 and 14 Years of Age. By Will. > Cheselden. Philosophical Transactions, Vol. 35. (1727‚Äì1728), pp. 447‚Äì450. A total of 66 early cases of patients who underwent cataract operations were reviewed by Marius von Senden in his German 1932 book, which was later translated into English under the title Space and sight. In this book, von Senden argues that shapes, sizes, lengths and distances are difficult for blind people to judge, including for a time after their operation. Examples and case studies Virgil In his book, An Anthropologist On Mars (1995), neurologist Oliver Sacks recounts the story of Virgil, a man who saw very little until having cataract surgery at age 50. Virgil's subsequent behavior was that of a \\"mentally blind\\" person‚Äîsomeone who sees but cannot decipher what is out there; he would act as if he were still blind. Often confused, Virgil rapidly sank into depression.https://www.byliner.com/oliver- sacks/stories/to-see-and-not-see Sidney Bradford In 1974, Richard Gregory described a patient, Sidney Bradford, a 52-year-old who gained vision from corneal grafts to both eyes. No experimental psychologist was informed of the case until after the corneal grafting took place. His operation was able to reveal idiosyncrasies of the human visual system. For example, not having grown up with vision, Bradford did not perceive the ambiguity of the Necker cube. Nor was he able to interpret the perspective of two-dimensional art. Nevertheless, he could accurately judge the distance to objects in the same room, having been familiar with these distances before regaining sight by virtue of having walked them. In a similar analogy between vision and sightless (touch-only) experience, Bradford was able to visually read the time on the ward clock just after his operation. Before surgery Bradford was a machinist, but even after acquiring vision preferred working with his eyes closed to identify tools. He died two years after his operation due to a prolonged period of ill health, with no specific cause of death noted. Michael May Michael G. \\"Mike\\" May (born 1954) was blinded by a chemical explosion at the age of 3 but regained partial vision in 2000, at 46, after corneal transplantation and a pioneering stem cell procedure by San Francisco ophthalmologist Daniel Goodman.http://www.goodmaneyecenter.com/gev- goodman.html Daniel Goodman May had a stem-cell transplant in his right eye in 2001 when he was 43, after 40 years of blindness. He reportedly has adapted well to his recovered vision. *May still has no intuitive grasp of depth perception. As people walk away from him, he perceives them as literally shrinking in size. *He has problems distinguishing male from female faces, and recognizing emotional expressions on unfamiliar faces. The effect of visual loss has an impact in the development of the visual cortex of the brain. The visual impairment causes the occipital lobe to lose its sensitivity in perceiving spatial processing. Sui and Morley (2008) proposed that after seven days of visual deprivation, a potential decrease in vision may occur. They also found an increasing visual impairment with deprivation after 30 days and 120 days. This study suggests that the function of the brain depends on visual input. May lost his eyesight at age three, when his vision was still not fully developed to distinguish shapes, drawings or images clearly. It would be difficult for him to be able to describe the world compared to a normal sighted person. For instance, May would have trouble differentiating complex shapes, dimension and orientations of objects. Hannan (2006) hypothesized that the temporal visual cortex uses prior memory and experiences to make sense of shapes, colours and forms. She proposed that the long-term effect of blindness in the visual cortex is the lack of recognition of spatial cues. At three years of age, May's vision had still not reached the acuity of an adult person, so his brain was still not completely exposed to all possible clarity of images and light of the environment. This made it difficult for Michael to lead a normal daily life. Cohen et al. (1997) suggested that early blindness causes a poor development of the visual cortex with the result of a decrease in somatosensory development. This study proposed that Michael's long-term blindness affects his ability to distinguish in between faces of males and females, and to recognize pictures and images. In spite of the surgery on his right eye, his newly regained vision, after blindness of forty years, is not fully recovered. Thinus-Blanc and Gaunet (1997) suggest that early blinded people show limited ability in spatial representation. Michael still struggles to identify pictures or illustrations. The impairment of his visual cortex, due to the loss of his vision at a very early age, resulted in visual cortex cells that are not used to the stimuli in his surroundings. Cohen et al. (1997) proposed that in their early age, blinded subjects developed strong motivations to tactile discrimination tasks. May's early blindness benefited him so far; he developed very precise senses of hearing and touch. In 2006, journalist Robert Kurson wrote a book on May, Crashing Through, expanded from an article he did for Esquire,Esquire article \\"Into the Light\\" by Robert Kurson (published June 1, 2005) which was adapted into a motion picture.Hollywood Reporter news on film about May Crashing Through was released on May 15, 2007. Shirl Jennings Shirl Jennings (1940‚Äì2003) was blinded by illness as a young boy. Experimental surgery in 1991 partially restored his vision, but like Bradford and May, Jennings found the transition to sightedness difficult. In 1992, a pneumonia infection resulted in anoxia, and ultimately cost Jennings his vision again. Shander Herian In 2011, The Guardian published a story about Shander Herian, who was blinded by illness at the age of 14 and fully recovered after an experimental surgery in middle age.Shander Herian, Jenny Hulme \\"Experience: I first saw my wife 10 years after we married\\", guardian.co.uk, 19 February 2011 Modern history More recently, another condition called aniridia has been treated with reconstructive surgery using the membrane from the amniotic sac that surrounds a fetus combined with stem cell transplantation into the eye. In 2003, three people were successfully implanted with a permanent \\"retinal prosthesis\\" by researchers at the University of Southern California. Each patient wore spectacles with miniature video cameras that transmitted signals to a 4-mm- by-5-mm retinal implant via a wireless receiver embedded behind the ear.https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,59634-0.html Wired -Bionic Eyes Benefit the Blind See also *Blindsight ‚Äì when a blind person can perceive visual stimuli unconsciously *Hand-eye coordination *Stereopsis recovery ‚Äì recovery of stereo vision Notes References Hannan, C.

It was originally built of gray stone, consisting of two towers with outer dimensions of and , respectively. The castle walls were thick. In a later phase, bricks were also used in the construction. The castle was on a steep rock, presumably an island back then, by the sea near the mouth of Hirvijoki River, flowing from Nousiainen. Due to the post-glacial rebound, the location is now almost from the coastline. Very little remains of the castle. Excavations have not been carried out on the site since the early 20th century, which has given room to dispute the castle's age. Some historians see it as a 14th-century construction, while others date it to the late 12th century, when King Canute built similar-looking small defensive castles in various parts of Sweden.Virrankoski, Pentti. Suomen historia I. SKS 2002. IsiveBN 951-746-321-9. See page 66. According to more or less vague chronicles, Finland seems to have been under special military attention by Danish, Swedish and Russian forces in the 1190s, thus giving the possible context for the construction of the castle. Historian Ericus Olai claimed in the late 15th century that bishop Kol of Link√∂ping (d. 1196?) had been the Duke of Finland (Dux Finlandiae), which however can not be confirmed from other sources.Suomen Museo 2002. See page 66. The book can be ordered from the Finnish Antiquarian Society. Also noteworthy is the castle's strategic position closing the maritime access to Nousiainen, which was the earliest presumed see of the Bishop of Finland. The see was moved to Koroinen latest in the mid-13th century. Whatever the case, the castle itself is not mentioned in historical sources during the time when it was in operation. The Stenberga estate around it is first mentioned in 1398 as the property of the then bailiff of the Turku Castle. The estate was later donated to a Bridgettine monastery in Naantali in the 1430s. According to some historians, the abandoned castle was soon thereafter disassembled to get construction material for the monastery, which was only some ten kilometres away. In 1556, the estate, along with other property of the monastery, was confiscated to the state during the Reformation. Today, the site is on private property, and has not been maintained for years. Land-owner's permission is required for a visit. The climb to the hilltop across steep rocks and bushes may be difficult.

It is a drama-documentary about a British woman's dispute with Social Services over the care and custody of her four children. The title comes from the traditional nursery rhyme \\"Ladybird Ladybird\\". Crissy Rock won the Silver Bear for Best Actress award at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival. Plot In a London karaoke bar some time around 1987, Maggie Conlan, a woman with a troubled past, meets Paraguayan immigrant Jorge and has a drink with him. During their conversation we learn about the lives we both had. In flashback, we learn that she was born in Liverpool and witnessed her father beating her mother. Later on, we hear that she was eventually sexually abused by her father and taken into care. As an adult she was beaten up several times by her ex-boyfriend Simon. She has four children by four different fathers and all of her children are in care. Jorge is a Paraguayan who is afraid to return to his own country for fear of persecution there. Maggie goes on to make a relationship with Jorge, being impressed with his poetry and his history. Her relationship with him is initially a tentative one because of her previous experience with her earlier boyfriend. The film goes on to show her time in a women's refuge. One night as she was singing in a club she was told that there had been an incident at her home; when she got there she found that there had been a fire at the refuge and her children were injured. The local authority then took her children into care and Maggie now blames Simon for having her children taken from her, but she says she shares some of the blame. Maggie's relationship with Jorge becomes more intense, but more strained, as Maggie's mental stresses become apparent. They set up home together, and have a daughter, but she is soon taken from them by the local authority under a Place of Safety order on the grounds that she is an unreliable mother with \\"low intellect\\" - social workers arrive at the flat while Maggie‚Äôs sister and nieces are visiting. Jorge is threatened with deportation to Paraguay from the UK, because he has been illegally employed, but he is allowed to stay in the UK because of his good character, and the plea he makes to the court. Maggie and Jorge have another baby and she too is removed by social workers, who arrive at the hospital when the baby is barely a day old. Maggie becomes distraught and has to be sedated. Maggie‚Äôs attempts to regain custody of her two younger children are unsuccessful, and she also sees her oldest son advertised for adoption in a local newspaper. The couple continue their lives together and the film closes with a caption: > Maggie and Jorge have had three more children whom they have been allowed to > keep. They have been given no access to their first two daughters. Maggie > says that she thinks every day of all her lost children.

Space-oblique Mercator projection is a map projection devised in the 1970s for preparing maps from Earth-survey satellite data. It is a generalization of the oblique Mercator projection that incorporates the time evolution of a given satellite ground track to optimize its representation on the map. The oblique Mercator projection, on the other hand, optimizes for a given geodesic. History The space-oblique Mercator projection (SOM) was developed by John P. Snyder, Alden Partridge Colvocoresses and John L. Junkins in 1976. Snyder had an interest in maps, originating back to his childhood and he regularly attended cartography conferences while on vacation. In 1972, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) needed to develop a system for reducing the amount of distortion caused when satellite pictures of the ellipsoidal Earth were printed on a flat page. Colvocoresses, the head of the USGS's national mapping program, asked attendees of a geodetic sciences conferences for help solving the projection problem in 1976. Snyder attended the conference and became motivated to work on the problem armed with his newly purchased pocket calculator and devised the mathematical formulas needed to solve the problem. After submitting his calculations to Waldo Tobler for review, Snyder submitted these to the USGS at no charge. Impressed with his work, USGS officials offered Snyder a job with the organization, which he accepted. His formulas were used to produce maps from Landsat 4 images launched in the summer of 1978. Projection description The space-oblique Mercator projection provides continual, nearly conformal mapping of the swath sensed by a satellite. Scale is true along the ground track, varying 0.01 percent within the normal sensing range of the satellite. Conformality is correct within a few parts per million for the sensing range. Distortion is essentially constant along lines of constant distance parallel to the ground track. The space-oblique Mercator is the only projection presented that takes the rotation of Earth into account. Equations The forward equations for the Space-oblique Mercator projection for the sphere are as follows: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{x}{R} &= \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\lambda'} \\\\frac{H-S^2}{\\\\sqrt{1+S^2}}d\\\\lambda' - \\\\frac{S}{\\\\sqrt{1+S^2}}\\\\ln\\\\tan\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}+\\\\frac{\\\\varphi'}{2}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{y}{R} &= \\\\left(H+1\\\\right) \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\lambda'} \\\\frac{S}{\\\\sqrt{1+S^2}}d\\\\lambda' + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1+S^2}}\\\\ln\\\\tan\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}+\\\\frac{\\\\varphi'}{2}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ S &= \\\\tfrac{P_{2}}{P_{1}} \\\\sin i \\\\cos \\\\lambda' \\\\\\\\\\\\ H &= 1 - \\\\tfrac{P_{2}}{P_{1}} \\\\cos i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tan\\\\lambda' &= \\\\cos i \\\\tan \\\\lambda_{t} + \\\\frac{\\\\sin i \\\\tan \\\\varphi }{ \\\\cos \\\\lambda_{t}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\varphi' &= \\\\cos i \\\\sin \\\\varphi - \\\\sin i \\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\sin \\\\lambda_{t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\lambda_{t} &= \\\\lambda + \\\\tfrac{P_{2}}{P_{1}} \\\\lambda'. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi &= \\\\text{geodetic (or geographic) latitude.} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\lambda &= \\\\text{geodetic (or geographic) longitude.} \\\\\\\\\\\\ P_{2} &= \\\\text{time required for revolution of satellite.} \\\\\\\\\\\\ P_{1} &= \\\\text{length of Earth rotation.} \\\\\\\\\\\\ i &= \\\\text{angle of inclination.} \\\\\\\\\\\\ R &= \\\\text{radius of Earth.} \\\\\\\\\\\\ x,y &= \\\\text{rectangular map coordinates.} \\\\end{align} References *John Hessler, Projecting Time: John Parr Snyder and the Development of the Space Oblique Mercator Projection, Library of Congress, 2003 *Snyder's 1981 Paper Detailing the Projection's Derivation Category:Map projections ","title":"Space-oblique Mercator projection"},{"id":"7151377","text":"Pikalyovo () is a town in Boksitogorsky District of Leningrad Oblast, Russia, located southeast of St. Petersburg and east of Boksitogorsk. Population: History Voskresensky Luchensky Pogost, which is located within the current boundaries of the town, was presumably founded in the 12th or 13th century. At the time, it belonged to the Novgorod Republic. Pikalyovo was first mentioned by name in 1620. Eventually it became a village, and since 1906 the name was assigned to the newly built railway station on the railway connecting St. Petersburg and Vologda. Since the 18th century, Pikalyovo was part of Tikhvinsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorate. In 1918, the uyezd was transferred to Cherepovets Governorate and between 1923 and 1927 Pikalyovo was the administrative center of Pikalyovskaya Volost. On August 1, 1927, the governorate was abolished and Pikalyovsky District with the administrative center in the selo of Pikalyovo was established as a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. In 1932, Pikalyovsky District was abolished. The current area of the town was split between Tikhvinsky and Yefimovsky Districts. In 1935, the construction of a cement factory commenced. The settlement serving the factory was named Pikalyovo after the railway station. The cement plant was evacuated during World War II and after the war several industrial enterprises were built, including the aluminum oxide plant. In 1947, Pikalyovo was granted urban-type settlement status. On July 25, 1952, it was transferred to newly established Boksitogorsky District, and on December 9, 1954, it was granted town status. In 1992, it became the town of oblast significance. In 2010, the administrative division of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with the municipal division, and Pikalyovo was made the town of district significance. Pikalyovo was strongly hit by economic crises of the 1990s and the first decade of the 2000s. In one infamous episode, in 2009, about three hundred inhabitants blocked the highway between St. Petersburg and Vologda to protest wage retardation. Vladimir Putin, the then-Prime Minister of Russia, flew to Pikalyovo and, without going through any legal procedures, ordered Oleg Deripaska, the plant owner, to pay out the debts immediately. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated within Boksitogorsky District as Pikalyovskoye Settlement Municipal Formation.Oblast Law #32-oz As a municipal division, Pikalyovskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Boksitogorsky Municipal District as Pikalyovskoye Urban Settlement.Law #78-oz Economy Industry The town's industry was composed of a Rusal aluminum oxide plant, by-producing sodium bicarbonate and potassium bicarbonate, a cement factory, and a timber-processing plant. Transportation A-114 Issad‚ÄìVologda autoroute passes south of Pikalyovo. Autoroutes H-9 (Pikalyovo‚ÄìZarechye) and H-7 (Pikalyovo‚ÄìKolbeki) pass directly through the town. Pikalyovo is located on the railroad connecting St. Petersburg and Vologda. There are three railway stations in the town: Pikalyovo-1, Pikalyovo2-, and Obrinsky. Both intra- and intercity bus services are available in Pikalyovo. Culture and recreation Pikalyovo hosts two museums. The Pikalyovo Local Museum shows mostly ethnographic collections. There is also a museum of aluminum oxide plant, which concentrates on the history of the town. Sports The town's Delfin swimming pool was the location of seven Soviet and three Russian championships, where fifty-seven world and European records were set.

Wilhelm II Pfitzer in 1844, founded a nursery on a property at Milit√§rstra√üe, Stuttgart in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, where his father, Wilhelm I Pfitzer, owned a property for his private gardenining interest. Wilhelm II founded a family firm that exists to this day and which has been a major influence on the development of many flower types, especially Dahlias, Gladioli, and Canna.Otto Mall: 140 Jahre Samen Pfitzer - von Stuttgart nach Fellbach With his wife, Friederike, n√©e Schickler (married 12 Juli 1849, died 27 December 1892), he extended the nursery around the vegetable and flower seed trades.  Wilhelm III Pfitzer  His son, Wilhelm III Pfitzer (11 August 1854 - 4 April 1921), for a period of seven years, worked for the famous Louis Van Houtte nursery in Ghent, Belgium, and others in the Netherlands, France and northern Germany, acquiring a rich experience he was able to bring with him when he returned to the family business along with many specimens of exotic plants. He joined the business in 1876 and served an apprenticeship with his father. In 1880, he became the head of the firm. Through reliability and industry, the business acquired loyal buyers and market traders for their products. A first seed and bulb catalogue was published, thus increasing business. During the 1870s he acquired Canna material from Herr Ehmann, also a Stuttgart nurseryman and for whom the much-favoured Canna ‚ÄòEhmanni‚Äô is named. That was the start of the involvement of the house of Pfitzer with the Canna genus. By 1880, the breeding of gladioli in pure colours succeeded for the first time. The new cultivars were introduced on World Fairs. In the long list of the prizes and honours the most notable were Dahlias (230), Gladioli (650), Canna (270), Petunien (400), Geraniums (630), Verbenen (850) and Phlox (500), appearing in Canada, USA, London, Paris, Brussels, Petersburg, Moscow, Hamburg, Dortmund, Bonn, and others.  Property at Fellbach  In 1909, the original property was sold for building as the city expanded and the company looked for new land outside Stuttgart. In 1910, they acquired of rural land near the railway station at Fellbach, about six miles (10 km) outside Stuttgart. Offices, warehouse, greenhouse, and nursery beds rapidly emerged. The land at Fellbach proved to be suitable for the cultivation of tender garden varieties and the business prospered. Above all other lines, the Gladiolus business grew to be larger than the Dahlias, Roses, Phlox, Delphiniums, Begonias, Cannas, and flowering shrubs. The company grew all of these lines and bred new cultivars ceaselessly.  World War One  The First World War proven a major setback as valuable breeding material could no longer be obtained. Most of the workforce were conscripted, but later replaced by prisoners of war. During the inflation years in Germany, 1923-1924 the firm was able to retain its entire workforce, due to their prudent management practices.  Inter-war years  After the dead of Wilhelm III Pfitzer in 1921, his sons Paul (27. 10. 1883), Wilhelm IV (11.5.1896) and Rudolf Pfitzer (11.6.1897) took on the responsibility to construct the new nursery, supported by their mother Anna n√©e Koch (married 11 July 1878, died 14 January 1937). When financial order was restored in Germany, the firm re-organised and opened new outlets in G√∂ppingen, Ulm, and Heilbronn, selling not only seed and plants but also the latest horticultural equipment, fertilisers and fungicides. A department for bird and dog lines was added at the same time. The seed and bulb business was promoted through a coloured catalogue with images of their new cultivars. Wilhelm IV Pfitzer was still in demand judging at international fairs, exhibitions, and shows, retaining his Presidency and Vice Presidency of the German and British Gladiolus Societies respectively, right until the end. His continual interest in Cannas meant a steady supply of new cultivars being produced each year. In 1933, there were about 150 employees worldwide. That same year, in order to laud the elevation of Fellbach to the status of a city, the firm named one of its best seedlings that year as Canna ‚ÄòStadt Fellbach‚Äô, meaning ‚ÄòCity of Fellbach‚Äô. That is still a popular cultivar in this day and age.Cooke, I (2001) The Gardener's Guide to Growing Cannas, Timber Press.  Pfitzer's Flower Show  Up to the Second World War thousands of visitors from all around the world descended annually on Fellbach to visit Pfitzer‚Äôs Flower Show. In addition, a multitude of young apprentices and sons of others in the trade enjoyed training at Fellbach, at what was recognised as one of the leading places of horticultural education in the world at that time. Gladiolus were still the most important and largest department of the firm, but Canna still provided a steady supply of business as they continued to hybridise new cultivars.  World War two  During World War II, most employees were conscripted and the nursery business had to be restricted and relocated. Vegetable type crops were ordered to be grown, regardless of the loss of valuable flowering stock. Head gardeners, too old for military service, had to contend with prisoners of war being billeted at Fellbach, and taught to grow vegetables. This was not onerous for the prisoners as it ensured that they ate much better than other prisoners of war did. The attempts at saving flowering stock that was carried out directly against the law only met with limited success, and much stock was lost during that time. Much will never be recovered. Sadly, many ‚ÄúPfitzeraners‚Äù never returned and much knowledge and experience was lost. Some of the world's leading hybridisers had been working at Fellbach before hostilities.  Post World Wars  After the war, the company was never able to regain its market share. Hostility to German goods existed for a while in both Europe and the USA, but more important, the neighbouring countries with favourable climates started to predominate. With their more favourable climate, they could produce in one year a harvest, or many harvests, that would take 2‚Äì3 years in Fellbach. In addition, the wage costs were more favourable to Mediterranean competitors. The firm had to retrench, and wound-up leases on much of its land and reduced its work force. It focussed on just Dahlias, Gladiolus, and Canna. In order to publicise its products to potential customers, many of whom had never heard of the companies‚Äô world-leading reputation, they involved themselves in numberless local and foreign gardening shows, fairs and exhibitions, competing successfully and with distinction. However, by the mid-1980s the firm had diminished in size to just six employees and of garden beds.

It is part of what tarot card readers call the \\"Minor Arcana\\" Tarot cards are used throughout much of Europe to play tarot card games.

Coins are considered the \\"darkest\\" of the suits in terms of choosing based on appearance and are meant to represent dark-skinned, dark-haired people. Using this method, a Knight of Coins would be used to represent a young man who is dark of complexion and features. One may also choose based on the meaning of the card, and how that meaning lines up with personality. So, in the case of the Knight of Coins, the card might represent someone who is stubborn or hard- working, serious, or set in their ways. One might also use this card when someone is grappling with a question where one of those issues is coming up‚Äîwhen they have a question about work or home life, or a question about whether to stand their ground on an issue.

Early life Caplin was born in New York City, the son of Lillian (Epstein) and Daniel Caplin, who were Jewish. Caplin held a B.S. degree, Phi Beta Kappa, from the University of Virginia, where he was also a member of the school's prestigious Raven Society. He was an Order of the Coif graduate of the University of Virginia Law School, where he earned his LL.B. degree. Caplin also achieved a Doctor of Juridical Science from New York University, and several honorary doctorate in law degrees (LL.D.) from Washington College, the University of South Carolina, and Saint Michael's College.A Man of Purpose: Professor, lawyer, soldier, scholar - Mort Caplin Makes It His Business to Serve, Washington Business Journal (August 15‚Äì21, 2003) First in his class at the University of Virginia School of Law, and Editor-in-Chief of Virginia Law Review, Caplin served as a law clerk to U.S. Circuit Judge Armistead M. Dobie. He then practiced law in New York City from 1941 to 1950, with time out for military service in the United States Navy. During the invasion of Normandy, he served as U.S. Navy beachmaster, cited as member of initial landing force on Omaha Beach and the recipient of the French Legion of Honor. In 1950, Caplin returned to UVA as professor of law, specializing in tax and corporate law and publishing extensively in these fields. He spent 33 years on the faculty of the U-Va. law school and jokingly credited his Internal Revenue Service appointment in 1961 to his ‚Äúgood judgment ‚Äî the good judgment to have both Bobby and Teddy Kennedy as students at the University of Virginia and to pass them both. He also served as adjunct professor of law at The George Washington University Law School from 1965 to 1966 and at the University of Miami School of Law from 1967 to 1970. Additionally, Caplin engaged in practice as counsel to a Virginia law firm. He turned 100 in July 2016. Government experience Following President John F. Kennedy's election, Caplin served on the President's Task Force on Taxation and in January 1961 was appointed U.S. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. During his tenure at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), he appeared on the cover of Time Magazine, which describes him as a \\"highly respected tax expert\\" and credits him for influencing Kennedy's tax proposals. While he was Commissioner, Kennedy also visited the IRS, the first time a U.S. President had visited IRS headquarters. Caplin remained at the IRS until July 1964 when he resigned to form the law firm of Caplin & Drysdale. Upon his leaving, The Washington Post published an article about Caplin's accomplishments as Commissioner, which included helping to tighten the administration of tax laws, building the IRS's public image, and implementing a nationwide computer system centralized with a basic taxpayer master file.The Tax Collector Goeth, The Washington Post (July 10, 1964) In his law practice, Caplin used his broad experience dealing with the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Justice Department, and the tax committees of the United States Congress. His area of expertise included tax planning, dispute resolution, trials and appeals. Professional activities Caplin served as Trustee of many educational and charitable organizations: UVA Board of Visitors; UVA Law School Foundation; George Washington University; University of the Virgin Islands; Peace Through Law Education Fund; Community Children's Theatre; Arena Stage; Shakespeare Theatre; Wolf Trap Foundation. He served for over ten years as Chair of the UVA Council for the Arts and was Honorary Chair. Caplin served on the following boards: American Bar Foundation, Governing Council of UVA's Miller Center of Public Affairs; Board of Directors, Environmental & Energy Study Institute; and Chair, Board of Advisors of The Hospitality & Information Service for Diplomats (\\"THIS\\"), Washington, D.C. He was also on the board of directors of Danaher Corporation, The Fairchild Corporation, Fairchild Industries, Inc., and Presidential Realty Corporation. The arts Caplin's passion for the arts can be traced back to his college years when he was president of the Virginia Players' and performed the title role in their production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar on February 5, 1938. In 1942, he married screenwriter Ruth Sacks, whose film \\"Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont\\" was released in 2005. The film won \\"Best Film in Japan\\" in 2010. Together, Mortimer and Ruth created a visiting artist fund for the Department of Drama at the University of Virginia in March 1999, enabling the department to bring in actors, directors, designers, and scholars regarded as leaders in the profession. He initiated several key projects as chair of the Council for the Arts including the Arts Enhancement Fund, which allowed department chairs and program directors to finance new arts initiatives. Under Caplin's leadership, the fund raised millions of dollars, which resulted in the successful development of the Carr's Hill arts district, later known as the Arts Grounds. The Caplins donated $4 million to the University of Virginia to help build the Ruth Caplin Theatre, located inside the university's new $13.5 million drama building addition. On April 27, 2013, the University of Virginia honored Ruth in a ribbon cutting ceremony to celebrate the official opening of the brand new Ruth Caplin Theatre. The Ruth Caplin Theatre was designed by architect William L. Rawn, III, who designed The Music Center at Strathmore and other major public buildings and cultural facilities. Awards and honors Caplin's contributions were recognized by numerous organizations over many years. The University of Virginia presented him the Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. Award from its National Advocacy Program as well as the Thomas Jefferson Medal in Law, the university's highest honor. Caplin also received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland. The American Bar Foundation honored him at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans founded by historian and author, Stephen Ambrose. He was also named \\"Chevalier\\" of the L√©gion d'honneur or Legion of Honor by the President of the French Republic for his contributions to the United States' decisive role in the liberation of France during World War II. The Maryland General Assembly issued an official citation in recognition of his appointment as \\"Chevalier\\" of the Legion of Honor. Caplin was the star middleweight of a national championship boxing team as a University of Virginia undergraduate in the mid-1930s. He also received the Medal of the Jubilee of Liberty, which was authorized by the Governor of the Normandy Region. On leaving the U.S. government, he received the Alexander Hamilton Award, the highest award conferred by the Secretary of the Treasury for his \\"distinguished leadership\\".The Legacy of Mortimer Caplin '40, Virginia Law Weekly (February 4, 2000) He was also the recipient of the Achievement Award, Tax Society of New York University; Judge Learned Hand Human Relations Award, American Jewish Committee; Tax Executives Institute Distinguished Service Award; The Federal Bar Association's Kenneth S. Liles Award; The Miller Center of Public Affairs' Elizabeth Scott Award; Veterans of Foreign Wars Public Service Award; Virginia State Bar and Award. He was granted Professor Emeritus from the University of Virginia, after having served as Professor of Law (1950‚Äì1961) and Visiting Professor of Law (1965‚Äì1987). He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa at the University of Virginia. Caplin was listed in the 2010 edition of The Best Lawyers in America in the specialty of Tax Law. Also, the Miller Center of Public Affairs hosted a prominent economic conference called the Mortimer Caplin Conference on the World Economy on December 10‚Äì11, 2009. Since its inception in 2008, the conference brings together leading experts to examine crucial economic issues on the global stage. He was also selected for the Veterans History Project, which preserves and presents personal accounts of American veterans in order to help future generations to better understand the realities of war.)

His TV credits include Dirty Money and the self-regarding title Paul Williams Investigates‚ÄîThe Battle for the Gas Fields. In 2011 he joined the Irish Sun, where he is employed as \\"Investigations Editor\\", after the closure of the Irish News of the World. He previously worked for the Sunday World tabloid newspaper; he moved to the Irish News of the World in 2010 before it was caught up in the News International phone hacking scandal and shut down. Education Williams was first educated in Ballinamore and then in Carrigallen (both in County Leitrim). He moved to Dublin in 1984 to study journalism at the Rathmines School of Journalism but dropped out after one year. Personal life Paul Williams is married to wife, Ann, with whom he has two teenage children. In popular culture Williams has been satirised as Paul 'The Hack' Williams on Oliver Callan's Nob Nation sketches on RT√â Radio. While on Liveline, Williams denied attempting to link the Republican movement with the criminal underworld. This prompted several people, whom Williams had linked to crime in his articles, to phone in and tell Joe Duffy that Williams was always making false allegations against them. Williams attempted to deflect the questions by focusing on their time spent in prison and implying that they had therefore lost any right to a reputation. In 2010, Williams contradicted himself by telling an audience that the Republican movement was linked with organised crime, so much so, he claimed, somewhat uncertainly, that 1969 was \\"probably the last truly peaceful year in this nation of ours. That\\", he said, \\"changed with the escalation of problems in Northern Ireland.\\" Books Williams pens books with titles like Gangland (1998), Evil Empire (2001), Crimelords (2003), The Untouchables (2006), Crime Wars (2008), and Badfellas (2011). His notorious 2014 book (titled Murder Inc) prompted objections and calls for a boycott from disgusted residents of Limerick when he attempted to do a signing there. A local bookstore owner posted a letter online saying he had never before had a visiting writer stir up so much anger from the public. Barrister and politician Emmett O'Brien, speaking on radio following Williams's self-promotional appearance on The Late Late Show, said the same crime stories are continually being ‚Äúrehashed‚Äù and that Williams declined to mention any positive development, i.e. a decline in the city's murder rate. Photographer Darren Ryan said of Williams: \\"He's making a personal profit off the misery that the good citizens of Limerick have had to endure.\\" Williams also ghost-wrote the book Secret Love (1995) with Phylis Hamilton; this tells the story of her secret 20-year love affair with Ireland's most outspoken Catholic priest on issues of sexual morality, Fr. Michael Cleary. Hamilton, who worked as Fr. Cleary's housekeeper, had two sons with the celebrity cleric. Television Dirty Money: The Story of the Criminal Assets Bureau, a six-part TV series on the history of the Criminal Assets Bureau by Paul Williams, began in January 2008 on TV3; it won Best Documentary at that year's TV Now Awards. In Paul Williams Investigates‚ÄîThe Battle for the Gas Fields aired in June 2009 on TV3, Williams reported on the Corrib gas controversy.\\"TV Guide\\" TV3. Campaigners who protest the Corrib gas project argued the documentary was biased in favour of Royal Dutch Shell ‚Äì the title itself shows that the \\"battle\\" is \\"for\\" the gas fields. Irish Independent reviewer John Boland also criticised Williams' obvious bias ‚Äì \\"instead of providing an expos√© [Williams] contented himself with innuendo and abuse\\", while \\"At the outset, he disingenuously asked if these 'vocal underdogs' were national heroes or 'villains' standing in the way of national progress, but he himself had no doubt about the answer, his attitude announcing itself in the language he used\\".Boland, John. \\"If only paul had piped down a bit\\". Irish Independent. 6 June 2009. The Irish Times reporter Frank McDonald reported that the documentary failed to explain the Shell's aims to Sea protesters. . Complaints were made to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission but were rejected on the grounds that the broadcast gave a fair opportunity for both sides to have their say. Journalism Williams has been the subject of criticism that he is a mouthpiece for the garda√≠ \\"who use his column to shape the public perception of the criminals he writes about and, quite possibly, to stir up tensions between rival gangs and major league villains\\".\\"Paul Williams to have round the clock Garda protection after events of the last few days\\" . 4 May 2007. The Sunday Tribune said a common criticism of Williams is that he is \\"little more than a cheerleader for the garda√≠\\" and noted Williams's tendency to steer away from any crime or corruption within the force. Williams has been criticised for his tendency to give nicknames such as \\"The Tosser\\", \\"The Penguin\\", \\"Babyface\\" and \\"Fatpuss\\" to the criminals he is reporting on.McCaffrey, Mick. \\"Profile ‚Äì Paul Williams\\" . Sunday Tribune. 26 October 2008. Critics complain this has served to glamourise the criminals and to boost their public profile. Williams has been the recipient of several death threats from organised crime and terrorist groups and has been receiving armed Garda protection for several years. The cost of this to the tax payer has been heavily criticised. On 16 March 2007, a man was acquitted at the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court of \\"threatening to kill or cause serious harm\\" to Paul Williams. The jury of four men and seven women deliberated for just one hour and thirty minutes to acquit Walsh on both charges on the sixth day of the trial. Sunday World After the murder of noted crime correspondent Veronica Guerin in 1996, Williams took over the mantle of Sunday World reporting on what he considered to be some of Ireland's most notorious criminals, i.e. people like Martin Cahill (whom he nicknamed \\"The General\\"). The General was made into a 1998 movie directed by John Boorman. His articles appear weekly there where, according to the newspaper's website, he maintained a vast archive of background material. However, Williams's life's work has now been lost - the newspaper deleted it after he left.Columnists index.\\"Paul Williams: Crime Writer\\" . Sunday World. 2008. In April 2000, the Sunday World defamed a man who gave evidence in the murder trial of Catherine Nevin, falsely stating the witness offered to sell photographs to Williams. The witness said the article also defamed him by claiming he ‚Äúbragged about his sexual prowess‚Äù to Williams. The article also unsuccessfully tried to falsely link the witness to Martin Cahill and the Dublin/Monaghan bombings. Sunday Newspapers Ltd, trading as the Sunday World, asked the High Court to dismiss the witnesses lawsuit, citing the length of time that had passed since the incident; the judge granted the tabloid's application. In 2002, Williams and the Sunday World were sued for libel after a story he had written in 1999 was proved to be untrue. In the article, Williams claimed a nun named Nora Wall had procured children so that they could be raped by paedophile priest Brendan Smyth. The paper issued a full apology and was forced to pay a ‚Ç¨175,000 settlement to Ms. Wall. In 2008, the Sunday Tribune reported that \\"his stories these days almost take second place to his personal celebrity\\" and that \\"friends say that he is only too aware of this and has renegotiated his contract throughout the years to reflect his market value\\". News of the World After receiving what he described as \\"a substantial offer\\" thought to involve a ‚Ç¨250,000 salary, Williams left the Sunday World, where he had worked for 23 years, in January 2010, and joined the Irish \\"News of the World\\" as its crime editor. However, the Sunday World took out a High Court injunction in an effort to prevent him from taking up his new position until his three months' notice to leave had expired. The dispute was later settled. His Sunday World contract had seen Williams paid a salary of a paltry ‚Ç¨145,000, increased by 2.5 per cent in 2008 and 2009. Irish Sun He joined stablemate the Irish Sun in October 2011. Irish Independent Since 2012, he has contributed to the Irish Independent. There, availing of the title \\"Special Correspondent\\", he writes of thieves and burglaries. TD Joan Collins named Williams under D√°il privilege as one of those to benefit from having their penalty points cancelled by garda√≠. Establishment politicians and media reacted with fury - at Collins. After Garda Commissioner Martin Callinan's 2014 resignation in disgrace, Collins criticised the \\"Pauls\\" (Williams and his RT√â counterpart Reynolds) and called on them to also resign their positions.

From February 4, 1736 to December 15, 1745 he was Viceroy of Peru. Early career Jos√© Antonio de Mendoza was a native of Galicia and a knight of the Order of Santiago. He had been ambassador to Venice and viceroy of Catalonia when King Philip V named him Viceroy of Peru in 1735. He took office in Lima, the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru the following year, at the age of 68 in 1736. During his administration, war between Spain and England again broke out, the War of Jenkins' Ear, 1739‚Äì1748. Viceroy Mendoza organized the defense of the Pacific coast and improved the army and the militia. In 1742 he dispatched a fleet from the port of El Callao to go to defend the coast of Chile. Scientists In 1736 Spanish scientists Jorge Juan y Santacilia and Antonio de Ulloa, sent by the French Academy on a French Geodesic Mission to measure a degree of meridian arc at the equator, arrived in the Viceroyalty colony. Jorge Juan y Santacilia had sailed on the same ship as Viceroy Mendoza. On their return, they reported on the disorganization and corruption in the government and smuggling. The report was posthumously published under the title Noticias Secretas de Am√©ricas (Secret News From Americas). Smuggling increased again during this period. The practice was so profitable that merchants were willing to accept the risks Another French influence on science in the colony was Louis Godin, another member of the meridian expedition. He was appointed cosm√≥grafo mayor by Viceroy Mendoza. The duties of cosm√≥grafo mayor included publishing almanacs and sailing instructions. Other French scientists in Peru at this time were Charles Marie de La Condamine and Pierre Bouguer. Later career Also during his tenure, an Indigenous peoples revolt for freedom occurred at Oruro (1739) and another led by Juan Santos Atahualpa broke out in 1742 in Oxabamba. This latter revolution gained support in all the native tribes, and also among Mestizos and poor Spaniards. The revolutionaries intent was to drive the Spaniards from Peru. They were unable to do so, but neither were the Spaniards able to defeat them. In 1740 the Viceroyalty of New Granada was separated from the Viceroyalty of Peru. It had been temporarily separated earlier, from 1717 to 1724 . The new viceroyalty included the territories of Bogot√°, Quito, Panama and Venezuela, and also a few territories more directly connected to Lima -- Maynas, Ja√©n, Tumbes and Guayaquil. Death Viceroy Mendoza was relieved of his Peruvian office in 1745. Jos√© Antonio de Mendoza died on the voyage returning to Castile in 1745.

Biography Born on July 2, 1921, in New York City, Piccolo was the only son of Francesco Piccolo and Fannie Lanza. Frank Piccolo stood at tall and weighed with black hair, brown eyes, and had a husky build. He was married to Virginia Paglinco and was the father of four children. Piccolo and his family lived in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In 1980, Piccolo attempted to blackmail money from Wayne Newton. Newton was trying to disengage himself from a financial investment in a Las Vegas, Nevada tabloid newspaper, but was being threatened by his partners in the venture. When the Las Vegas Police Department was unable to stop the threats, Newton turned to his friend Guido Penosi for help. Penosi referred Newton to Piccolo, who then used his influence to stop the threats. Piccolo then performed a similar favor for Newton's business advisor. At this point, Piccolo wanted a quid pro quo from Newton. Piccolo started pressuring the business advisor to purchase life insurance for singer Lola Falana from a selected insurance agent. Piccolo also told some of his associates in New York that he was going to be a \\"silent partner\\" with Newton in his attempt to purchase the Aladdin Hotel and Casino (now called the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino) in Las Vegas. By this time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was listening in on Newton's conversations with the mobsters. On June 12, 1981, Piccolo and Penosi were indicted in Connecticut on charges of conspiring to extort money and \\"valuable rights\\" from Newton and Falana. However, Piccolo was dead by the time the trial started. On September 19, 1981, Piccolo was shot to death in a telephone booth on a street in Bridgeport. Piccolo was reportedly killed on the orders of Gambino boss Paul Castellano. Piccolo was killed because he had been trying to encroach on the Genovese crime family's control of rackets in Connecticut. Not wanting to risk lucrative constructions rackets the Gambinos share with the Genovese family, Castellano ordered Piccolo's murder.

The dam was constructed in a deep gorge in the Nallamala Hills in between Kurnool and Mahabubnagar districts, above sea level. It is long, maximum height and has crest gates. It has a reservoir of . Project has an estimated live capacity to hold 178.74 Tmcft at its full reservoir level of MSL. The minimum draw down level (MDDL) of the reservoir is at MSL from its river sluice gates and corresponding dead storage is 3.42 Tmcft. The left bank underground power station houses reversible Francis-pump turbines for pumped-storage operation (each Turbine can pump 200 cumecs) and the right bank semi under ground power station houses Francis-turbine generators. Tail pond dam /weir located 14 km downstream of Srisailam dam is under advanced stage of construction to hold the water released by the hydro turbines and later pump back into the Srisailam reservoir by operating the turbines in pump mode. The weir portion got breached in November 2015 unable to withstand the normal water release from the hydro power stations. Tail pond weir was completed during the year 2017 and pumping mode operation is being done even the downstream Nagarjuna Sagar reservoir water level is below MSL. The tail pond has nearly 1 tmcft live storage capacity. Srisailam Dam Project history Srisailam Dam Backwaters of Krishna River The Srisailam project began in 1960, initially as a power project. After several delays, the main dam was finally completed twenty years later in 1980 July 26. In the meantime the project was converted into a multipurpose facility with a generating capacity of by its second stage which was completed in 1987. The dam is to provide water for an estimated . Under the right bank branch canal in Kurnool and Kadapa districts will have assured irrigation. From the initial modest estimate of for a power project the total cost of the multipurpose project was estimated to cross in its enlarged form. The dam has alone cost together with the installation of four generating sets of each. The right bank branch canal is estimated to cost and the initial investment of has been provided by the World Bank. The projected cost-benefit ratio of the project has been worked out at 1:1.91 at 10% interest on capital outlay.. In 1998 a coffer dam was over topped by flooding. The power house required repairs and did not generate power for a year. On 2 October 2009, Srisailam dam experienced a record inflow which threatened the dam.Managing historic flood in the Krishna river basin in the year 2009 Irrigation schemes Srisailam right main canal (SRMC) is constructed with 44,000 cusecs capacity at Srisailam reservoir level of MSL to feed Veligodu reservoir (16.95 tmcft), Brahmamsagar Reservoir (17.74 tmcft), Alaganoor reservoir (2.97 tmcft), Gorakallu reservoir (12.44 tmcft), Owk reservoir (4.15 tmcft), Gandikota Reservoir (26.86 tmcft), Mylavaram reservoir (9.98 tmcft), Somasila reservoir (78 tmcft) and Kandeleru reservoir (68 tmcft) with nearly 235 Tmcft total storage capacity. This canal also supplies water to Telugu Ganga project which supplies Krishna river water to Chennai city for its drinking purpose. This main canal by feeding water to K. C.

Tunnel is not complete and water was never provided.  Dam Maintenance and Safety  Systematic Neglect and absence of diversion of funds is evident in maintenance of the dam and lack of any modernization attempts of the Powerhouse. The officers report a shortage of maintenance staff. Safety concerns to the 2nd largest Hydroelectric project in the country have been raised over the years and have been assessed false subsequently. In 2009, the dam, designed for a maximum flood of 19 lakh cusecs, endured a flood of 25.5 lakh cusecs. According to a survey conducted in summer of 2018, the scouring resulted in the formation of a huge pit in the apron downstream the dam. And a structure protecting the ‚Äòtoe‚Äô and foundation of the main dam has weakened. Efforts are not yet made to repair and maintain the dam.

It has been found in the Pacific Ocean off southern Japan, the Bonin Islands, Pacific Ocean off northern Taitung County and the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. This species inhabits upper continental slopes and seamounts. It may migrate vertically, shifting between bottom waters deep during the day and upper waters less than deep at night. A slender, black shark reaching in length, the viper dogfish can be recognized by its narrow, triangular jaws and well-spaced, fang-like teeth. It also has two spined dorsal fins, dermal denticles with faceted crowns, and numerous light-emitting photophores concentrated on its ventral surface. Feeding mainly on bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by protruding its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape allows it to swallow relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure of its head shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species. Taxonomy The first specimens of the viper dogfish were two immature males caught off southern Japan by the bottom trawler Seiryo-Maru in 1986. The first, designated as the holotype, measured long and was collected off Cape Shiono at a depth of . The second measured long and was collected off Hiwasa, Tokushima at a depth of . The shark was described as a new species and genus by University of Tokyo researchers Kenji Mochizuki and Fumio Ohe in a 1990 article for the Japanese Journal of Ichthyology. They gave it the name Trigonognathus kabeyai; the generic name is derived from the Greek trigonon (\\"triangle\\") and gnathus (\\"jaw\\"), while the specific name honors Hiromichi Kabeya, the captain of the Seiryo-Maru. Mochizuki and Ohe originally assigned the viper dogfish to the family Squalidae, which at the time was used for all members of the order Squaliformes aside from the bramble and rough sharks. In a 1992 morphological study, Shigeru Shirai and Osamu Okamura placed this species in the squalid subfamily Etmopterinae, which most taxonomists now recognize as the separate family Etmopteridae. Phylogeny and evolution The position of Trigonognathus within the Etmopteridae is uncertain. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic data generally support the subdivision of the Etmopteridae into two clades, one consisting of Etmopterus and Miroscyllium and the other consisting of Centroscyllium and Aculeola. Phylogenetic analyses have variously placed Trigonognathus as closer to one clade or the other or as basal to both, depending on which morphological characters, nuclear DNA markers, and/or mitochondrial DNA markers were used. Based on molecular clock estimation, Trigonognathus is thought to have originated around 41 million years ago during the Middle Eocene, as part of a larger evolutionary radiation of etmopterid genera. The genus is represented in this time period by the extinct species T. virginiae, whose fossilized teeth have been recovered from Lutetian age (47.8‚Äì41.3 Mya) strata in Landes, southwestern France. Fossil teeth virtually identical to those of the modern viper dogfish are known from the Cubagua Formation in northeastern Venezuela, which dates to the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene (11.6‚Äì3.6 Mya). Description The narrow jaws and needle-like teeth of the viper dogfish are distinctive. The viper dogfish has a slender, cylindrical body and a moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout. Behind the large oval eyes are narrow, elliptical spiracles. The nostrils are nearly vertical slits. The jaws are long and narrowly triangular, and can be protruded from the head. The teeth are distinctively fang-like and widely spaced; the most anterior teeth are grooved lengthwise. Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side, along with a single tooth row at the upper and lower symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are largest at the symphysis and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth. When the mouth is closed, the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower, while the lateral teeth interlock. Five gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair longer than the others. The fins are small and very thin. The pectoral fins are rounded and lobe-like. The two dorsal fins are positioned about between the pectoral and pelvic fins. Each dorsal fin bears a slightly grooved spine in front; the second dorsal spine is longer than the first. The anal fin is absent, and the caudal peduncle lacks keels or notches. The upper lobe of the caudal fin is larger than the lower and has a notch in the trailing margin. The skin, excluding on the fins, is densely covered with irregularly arranged, nonoverlapping dermal denticles. Each denticle has a swollen rhombic shape with 10‚Äì40 facets on the crown. The viper dogfish is black with distinct darker markings on the underside. These markings contain large numbers of tiny light-producing photophores; more photophores are found sparsely scattered over the rest of the body, as well as in a translucent patch on the upper eyelid. The fins are translucent, and the tip of the caudal fin upper lobe is blackish. The largest known male is long and weighs , and the largest female is long and weighs . Distribution and habitat Most specimens of the viper dogfish have been collected from a relatively small area of the northwestern Pacific Ocean off the Kii Peninsula in Japan. A number of specimens were also recovered from the stomachs of predatory fishes caught in the Bonin Islands. One specimen was caught from the Hancock Seamount, located some northwest of Kure Atoll in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands. During the day, this species has been caught close to the bottom on the upper reaches of continental slopes and seamounts, at depths of . At night, it has been caught between the surface and a depth of in water over deep. This pattern suggests the viper dogfish performs a diel vertical migration, spending the day in deeper water and rising towards the surface at night; such daily movement may relate to feeding. Biology and ecology The bigeye tuna preys on the viper dogfish. The viper dogfish feeds primarily on bony fishes, notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting, in contrast to the short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting. Jaw protrusion is instead effected by the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally. Known predators of the viper dogfish include the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and the sickle pomfret (Taractichthys steindachneri). Like other members of its family, this species is viviparous, giving birth to live offspring, with the developing embryos sustained to term by yolk. Adult females have two functional ovaries and two functional uteri. Two of the recorded female specimens contained 25 and 26 mature ova; in the related black dogfish (Centroscyllium fabricii), the number of mature ova in a female is slightly greater than the number of resulting embryos, which suggests a litter size under 26 in the viper dogfish. Males and females mature sexually at roughly long, respectively. Human interactions The viper dogfish has no economic value. It is very infrequently caught in commercial purse seines and bottom trawls targeting other species, though what effect, if any, fishing has on its population is unknown. As a result, the IUCN has listed it under Data Deficient.

A pioneer of naval aviation in France, he captained the first French aircraft carrier, earned many awards, and held many top posts. He is most well known for his final military act, the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon, after he refused to order his fleet to join the Allies during the German occupation of Vichy France in World War II, which left his prestige in ruins and led to his arrest and conviction for treason. Education Jean de Laborde entered Naval school in 1895 with the title of \\"Count\\", which remained his nickname during his career. Military career World War I and prior After graduating, de Laborde was posted to the Far East in 1897 where he served first as Ensign in 1900 and took part in the Chinese campaign following the Boxer Rebellion. Upon returning to France, he was commissioned a Lieutenant in 1908. After a couple of years in Moroccan waters, he was sent back to the Far East on board the armored cruiser Dupleix. While there, he learned to fly and overflew Saigon, earning his pilot's license in 1914. As a pilot during World War I he led a flight unit and later directed the maritime aviation center at Dunkirk. Between the wars A pioneer of naval aviation in France, he was named head of naval aviation in 1925 and took command of the B√©arn, the first French aircraft carrier. In 1928 at the age of 50, he earned the rank of contre-amiral, (equivalent to rear admiral), and became commander of the maritime sector of Toulon, and in 1930, commander-in-chief of the 2nd Squadron. He was elevated to Vice-Amiral (vice admiral) in 1932 and commander- in-chief and Maritime Prefect of the 4th maritime region (Bizerte) covering the Mediterranean. In 1936 de Laborde again took charge of the 2nd Squadron and later that year became commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Squadron. From 1937‚Äì1940 he was a member of the Superior Naval Council (). In 1938 he earned his five star, becoming Full Admiral. From 1938‚Äì1939 he served as inspector general of naval forces, and was involved in various naval consultative commissions under the French Third Republic. World War II German invasion of France In 1939 and 1940 he served as commander-in-chief of naval forces of the West, and was known as \\"Admiral West\\". By this time, he had earned numerous medals, including the highly prestigious Legion of Honor. Nazi Germany invaded France in May 1940, and an armistice was signed in June dividing France into two sectors, an occupied zone in the north and west, and a free zone in the southeast, with a French government administered by Marshal Philippe P√©tain based in Vichy. De Laborde had reached retirement age by September 1940, but after the armistice was reactivated and named leader of the Forces de Haute mer (FHM) a newly created unit, for two years. Scuttling of the Fleet P√©tain counted on the rivalry between de Laborde and Admiral of the fleet Fran√ßois Darlan to keep control. Darlan had been Admiral of the Fleet. As a vice-admiral, Laborde was chief of the First Squadron, organised around the battleship Strasbourg. After the Fall of France and the rise of Vichy France, Laborde supported the regime, and was made chief of the High sea fleet by Philippe P√©tain, who counted on using Laborde's dislike of Darlan to make the Fleet easier to manage. The High Seas Fleet was composed of 38 modern units and amounting to a quarter of the total French fleet. Very antagonistic to the British and to Charles de Gaulle, Laborde promoted a project to re-take Chad. When the Allies invaded the French colonies of North Africa in Operation Torch, he suggested that the French fleet should sail and attack the Allies in retaliation; this proposal was sharply turned down by Gabriel Auphan. Amidst intrigue, attempted deals and changing loyalties, following invasion of North Africa by the Allies on 7 November 1942, Darlan made a deal with the Allies, ordering French troops to join the allies, which they did. P√©tain stripped Darlan of his office and ordered resistance in North Africa, but was ignored. In response, Nazi troops occupied the free zone, but paused outside Toulon, the base where most of the remaining French ships were moored. On 11 November Darlan responded by ordering Laborde join him with the fleet in North Africa. Auphan, who had succeeded Darlan as head of the navy, also privately urged him to join the Allies. Laborde rejected the appeals, insisting that he would only do so on a direct order from P√©tain. On 27 November 1942 Laborde ordered the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon to prevent his ships from falling in German, Italian or British hands. By the time the Germans tried to seize the ships, they had all been scuttled or had escaped. After Liberation, during the √âpuration l√©gale, Laborde was sentenced to death by the for treason and for failing to save the fleet by allowing it to defect to the Allies. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was pardoned on 9 June 1947.

History Castle Sween is the oldest stone castle in Scotland, built in the late 11th century by Suibhne, son of Hugh Anrahan, brother of the king of Ulster and High King of Ireland, from whom it takes its name Suibhne.Ewart; Triscott; Holmes et al. (1996) p. 518; MacPhee, Kathleen, Somerled, Hammer of the Norse (2004), p. 67. As late as the thirteenth century, the MacSweens possessed the surrounding lands of Knapdale. However, by the second half of the century, these territories passed into the hands of the Stewart/Menteith family. In 1310, Edward II, King of England, granted John MacSween, and his brothers, the MacSweens' ancestral lands of Knapdale, provided that they oust John Menteith. It is possible that MacSween, and his claim to his family's lost Scottish homeland, may be the subject of the Gaelic poem D√°l chabhlaigh ar Chaist√©al Suibhne. If so, this poem may well refer to an expedition by MacSween to retake Castle Sween in about 1310. In 1323, after the death of John Menteith, the Lordship of Arran and Knapdale passed to his son and grandson. In 1376, half of Knapdale, which included the castle, passed into the possession of John MacDonald I, Lord of the Isles, by a grant from his father-in-law, Robert II, King of Scotland. During the MacDonalds' century and a half of holding the castle, the castellans were first MacNeils and later MacMillans.

Danker, Bernard A. Taylor (et al., eds.), pp. 32‚Äì47. The producers of the German forerunner are Erwin Preuschen and Walter Bauer. The English edition is A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (the 3rd edition was published in 2001 by the University of Chicago Press, ).  History  The origin may be traced to Erwin Preuschen's Vollst√§ndiges Griechisch-Deutsches Handw√∂rterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments und der √ºbrigen urchristlichen Literatur (1910). Walter Bauer extensively revised this work, as Griechisch-deutsches W√∂rterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments und der √ºbrigen urchristlichen Literatur. The first English edition was published in 1957. It is based on the fourth German edition (1949-1952) of Walter Bauer‚Äôs Greek- German lexicon (Bauer lexicon). The project began in the fall of 1949, when F. Wilbur Gingrich was granted a leave of absence from Albright College to work on a new Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament, translating and adapting the work of Bauer in collaboration with Dr. William F. Arndt. The work actually took 5 ¬Ω years. This English edition is often referenced by an abbreviation of the authors - Bauer, Arndt, and Gingrich (BAG). The second English edition was published in 1979 with the additional help of Frederick William Danker due to the death of Arndt in 1957. It is based on Bauer‚Äôs fifth German edition (1957-1958). This second edition, Bauer-Danker Greek Lexicon of the New Testament, is commonly known as BAGD (due to the abbreviation of the contributors Bauer‚ÄìArndt‚ÄìGingrich‚ÄìDanker). The third English edition was published in 2000. It is based on the sixth German edition, which was published following Bauer's death in 1960, by Kurt Aland, Barbara Aland and Viktor Reichmann. Gingrich died in 1993, leaving Danker to complete the third English edition based on all the prior editions and substantial work of his own. Given the extensive improvements in this edition (said to include over 15,000 new citations), it is now known as Bauer‚ÄìDanker‚ÄìArndt‚ÄìGingrich (BDAG) or sometimes the Bauer-Danker Lexicon. A notable feature of the third English edition is vastly improved typography. This reflects early adoption of SGML technology. The entire lexicon was converted to SGML in the late 1980s at Dallas Seminary with collaboration from SGML experts interested in the project, and Danker actually did substantial editorial and authorial work in an SGML editing program. This technology permitted much more consistent and flexible typography, as well as information retrieval. A Chinese translation of the lexicon, based on the third English edition, was published in 2009 in Hong Kong by Chinese Bible International Limited. See also *Walter Bauer *F.

The land was bought by John Cobbold in 1812 who brought his wife Elizabeth Cobbold and their large family here to live in 1814.. Cobbold later began using the areas natural springs to produce beer. In 1814 Holywells House was completed on the site of an old farmhouse (this building was demolished in 1962 due to wood rot and only the stable block remains). In 1935 the land at Holywells was presented to the people of Ipswich by Lord Woodbridge and then opened to the public in 1936. Holywells park is now a designated a Conservation Area and is on the English Heritage register of historic parks and gardens of special historic interest In July 2012, Ipswich Borough Council received a grant of ¬£2.8 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and Big Lottery Fund (BIG) for the Holywells \\"Parks for People\\" restoration project. The HLF grant was supplemented by funding from the Friends of Holywells Park and by the Borough Council6\\\\. https://www.ipswich.gov.uk/content/holywells-park-for-people . The grant was used to improve a range of park facilities and to enable the renovation of the Stable Block, converting it into a vibrant visitor centre and caf√© with an education area and function room. The conservatory was refurbished and turned into a multi-function area that can be used for exhibitions, talks, meetings and other functions. The Stable Block and conservatory are both listed buildings Activities Holi Festival of Colour, 2 April 2017Established in 2001 the Friends of Holywells Park are a very active volunteer group whose aim is to increase the local knowledge, understanding and enjoyment of Holywells Park. The park hosts numerous events throughout the year organised by Friends of Holywells Park, Suffolk Wildlife Trust, Ipswich Borough Council and charitable and private organisations. Popular among the regular events are Family Fun Days (July-August), Practical conservation activities, a bat walk (August), a Cold Fair (January), Holi Festival of Colour (April), The Nearly Music Festival (and other concerts like 'Chopin in the Park'), Tea Dances and many more. The park is frequently used for charity rides, runs and walks. Sport and leisure In summer 2007 work was completed on a new play area, situated on the site of the old play area. Work was also carried out to remove the paddling pool and in turn making a new stream joining the 3rd pond to the lake at the Holywells road end of the park. The play area for children, incorporates a hi-tech teen play facility, Water play facility (summer only) kiosk, toilets and changing room. There is a trim trail that provides fitness for all levels of physical ability. From simple Balance Beams to the challenge of Pole Climb or Ladder Walk, it tests upper and lower body strength, co- ordination, agility and overall stamina. The many paths in the park are well trodden by joggers and fitness walkers. The park is home to Holywells Bowling Club. It also has a Victorian conservatory and a walled garden. There are four entrances to the park: Cliff Lane, Myrtle Road, Bishop‚Äôs Hill and Nacton Road. Blue Badge parking is available at the Cliff Lane entrance and public parking at Athena Hall off Duke Street, IP3 0DT Water supply Holywells Park with its water supply network as portrayed by Thomas Gainsborough Holywells has played an important role in providing a water supply to Ipswich. Wildlife and ornithology Alder Carr, one of the ponds in Holywells Park The park has a variety of different habitats including formal gardens, ponds, fields and woodland, and these support a surprising large number of different species. There are protected bat species like pipistrelle and barbastelle and there is plenty of fallen and standing deadwood which provides homes for stag beetle, five banded weevil-wasp, bee wolf and golden hoverfly. The many ponds attract insects and in turn birds ‚Äì kingfisher are regularly spotted as are woodpeckers. The Suffolk Wildlife Trust runs free wildlife sessions for schoolsSuffolk Wildlife Trust and the park has an active team of park rangers which encourage young people with a love for nature, to build their practical conservation skills by learning from and working alongside local wildlife experts.

First described in the 14th century, it has a rear thumb-hole, two front finger-holes, and a conical bore. It is approximately 8 cm in length and has a range of over two octaves, from B3 to C6 . A larger instrument of the same name, with a lowest note of C5 appeared in the early 17th century . In Sicily, zuffolo refers to a longer beak flute of about 29 cm, with a wide bore and six equally spaced finger-holes . In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, it was also called the \\"flautino\\" , flauto piccolo, and flautino piccolo, and is sometimes spelled zufolo. Known as the Picco pipe and marketed as a toy until early in the 20th century, the instrument was popularized in London in 1856, either as a toy by a blind Italian musician named Picco , or by a blind Sardinian player at Covent Garden . The zuffolo is the smallest form of ducted-flue tabor pipe or flute-a-bec, at 3¬Ω\\" long, with the windway taking up 1¬Ω\\". It has only three holes: two in front and a dorsal thumb hole. It has the same mouthpiece as a recorder. The bore end hole of the picco pipe has a small flare, and the lowest notes were played with a finger blocking this end. The range is from b to c3, using the slight frequency shift between registers to sound a full chromatic scale, like the tabor pipe . Relatives In northern Europe a very similar instrument is known by various names from the 14th until at least the 17th century. The earliest source is a 14th-century Flemish manuscript copy of De planctu naturae by Alain de Lille, which includes drawings of eleven different types of instruments, including two of duct flutes. One of these is a one-handed flute with three front finger-holes and one thumb-hole. It is labeled, together with another instrument, with the generic Latin term \\"fistuli\\" and with the Middle Dutch word \\"floyt\\" . In the early 16th century, a woodcut showing this same type of instrument is labeled \\"Russpfeiff\\" (from MHGer Rusch, \\"rush\\") in . This name is spelled \\"R√ºspfeiff\\" in , where the same instrument is also referred to as a \\"klein Fl√∂tlein mit 4 l√∂chern\\" (small little flute with four holes) (; ). At the beginning of the next century, Michael Praetorius depicted this instrument once again in the supplement (Theatrum Instrumentorum) to the second volume of his Syntagma Musicum, where he uses the expressions \\"gar kleine Plockfl√∂tlein\\" (very small little recorder), \\"garklein Fl√∂tlein\\" (very small little flute), and \\"klein Fl√∂tlein\\" (small little flute). He gives the size of this instrument as about three or four Brunswick inches, its range as nearly two octaves, and its playing technique as involving \\"unten zum Ausgang darneben mit eim Finger regiret werden\\" (regulated by means of a finger under the outlet). The lowest open tone is shown in the woodcut as C6, but Praetorius does not say how much lower the instrument can be made to speak by using the finger to shade the bell opening .

It was produced by the Edison film company (part of the Edison Manufacturing Company) and is believed to have been shot by Edwin S. Porter or Jacob Blair Smith.silentera.com, Electrocuting an Elephant, Also known as Electrocution of an Elephant in the USA (1903), American B&W; : 70 feet, directed by Edwin S. Porter and/or Jacob Blair Smith Synopsis This film documents the publicly announced killing of Topsy the elephant at the unfinished Luna Park on Coney Island, New York City on January 4, 1903. The elephant had recently been acquired from Forepaugh Circus, where she had a reputation as a \\"bad\\" elephant, having killed a drunken spectator the previous year who burnt the tip of her trunk with a lit cigar. After several incidents at Luna Park (sometimes attributed to the actions of her handler, William \\"Whitey\\" Alt) the owners of Luna Park, Frederic Thompson and Elmer \\"Skip\\" Dundy, claimed they could no longer handle the elephant and announced they would hang Topsy in a public spectacle and charge admission. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals stepped in, questioning the idea of hanging an elephant as well as making a public spectacle out of the death of an animal. Thompson and Dundy cut the event back to invited guest and press only and agreed to use a surer method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam powered winch. They also agreed they would use poison and electricity as well. 1903 film of the execution of Topsy shot by the Edison Manufacturing Co. The 74 second film opens with a standard Edison Studios credit screen \\"ELECTROCUTING AN ELEPHANT\\" \\"Thomas A. Edison\\" and then cuts to Topsy being led past a crowd of people through an unfinished Luna Park to the execution spot, an island in the middle of a \\"lagoon\\" used for boat-rides, by elephant handler Carl Goliath. The film camera stops at that point and an intervening hour and forty-five minutes are not recorded. During this unrecorded interval Topsy refused to cross the bridge to the island forcing the park employees and Brooklyn Edison electricians to re-rig the strangling apparatus and electrical wiring to where Topsy stood. Topsy was also fed carrots laced with cyanide while copper-clad sandals connected to electric lines were strapped to her feet. When the film camera restarts, Topsy is seen with the bridge over the lagoon and the original execution spot, the parks \\"Electric Tower\\" with a sign advertising \\"OPENING MAY 2ND 1903 LUNA PARK $1,000,000 EXPOSITION, THE HEART OF CONEY ISLAND\\", in the background. Topsy tries to shake off one of the sandals and then stands still. At that point she stiffens as 6,600-volts AC is applied to her body. Smoke rises from her feet and then she topples to the ground. Right at the end of the film, the noose tied around Topsy's neck can be seen tightening. Release This was one of many short \\"actuality\\" films by the Edison Manufacturing Company shot at Coney Island from 1897 on.westland.net - Coney Island - Movie List It was released on January 17, 1903, 13 days after Topsy's death, to be viewed in Edison coin-operated kinetoscopes. It was listed in the Edison catalog as: Electrocuting an Elephant does not seem to have been as popular as other Edison films from that period. Place in history The Edison company submitted the film to the Library of Congress as a \\"paper print\\" (a photographic record of each frame of the film) for copyright purposes. This form of submission may have saved the film for posterity since most films and negatives of this period decayed or were destroyed over time. It may have been the first time a death was ever captured in a motion picture film. The film fell into relative obscurity in the years after 1903, showing up as an out of context clip in the 1979 film Mr. Mike's Mondo Video. In 1991, documentary maker Ric Burns made the film Coney Island which included a segment recounting the death of Topsy, including clips from the film Electrocuting an Elephant. The film was also used in a memorial arts piece to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Topsy's death created by New Orleans artist Lee Deigaard and exhibited at the Coney Island USA museum. It allowed the public to view the film on a hand cranked mutoscope while surrounded by hanging chains and standing on a copper plate. In recent years portions of Electrocuting an Elephant have also appeared in movies, music videos, TV shows, and video games. In popular culture Thompson and Dundy's execution of Topsy has switched attribution, with claims the film depicts an anti-alternating current demonstration organized by Thomas A. Edison during the war of the currents. Historians point out that Edison was never at Luna Park and the electrocution of Topsy took place 10 years after the war of currents.

The models of the aircraft were Myrsky I, Myrsky II, and Myrsky III. History The decision to start developing a new fighter for the Finnish Air Force was based on experience gained before the Winter War: in the \\"arms race\\" leading up to a war, it can be difficult for smaller nations to purchase top-of-the- line fighters without a significant political cost. The Finnish Air Force requested preliminary proposals for a domestic fighter from State Aircraft Factory (Valtion Lentokonetehdas) in early 1939, before the Winter War. State Aircraft Factory prepared five alternative proposals by May 1939. After that, The Ministry of Defence ordered the fighter design from State Aircraft Factory in June 1939. The preliminary design was made by the aircraft-designer trio Arvo Ylinen (head of the design-bureau), Martti Vainio (aerodynamics), and Torsti Verkkola (structural design). Edward Wegelius was appointed head of the design department of the State Aircraft Factory when Ylinen later moved on to the Helsinki University of Technology in August 1940. VL did not appoint any main constructor to its products, such as the German aircraft manufacturers did. Due to difficulties obtaining duraluminium, the wings were made out of plywood and the fuselage was metal structure with a fabric and plywood skin. The planned Bristol Taurus III engine was not available due to war, so a Pratt & Whitney R-1830 (civil Twin Wasp) was chosen. Availability of this engine was also problematic, so an R-1830-S3C3-G was used for the first prototype and less-powerful SC3-Gs for later prototypes and production fighters. These were bought from German war booty stocks. The first Myrsky prototype flew on 23 December 1941.Stenman 1983, p.11. The prototype was fully functional, but too heavy. After some modifications they soon had three new prototype aircraft. The test flights showed some structural problems during high-speed tests. All three prototypes were destroyed during test flights; two test pilots died, one was seriously injured. The culprit was found to be aeroelastic flutter, which was a poorly known phenomenon at the time. Resolving the flutter problem took almost a year. Series production started in autumn 1942 far before German deliveries of Messerschmitt Bf 109 had begun in 1943. The series production version was called the Myrsky II. 47 Myrsky IIs were built and together with the Myrsky I version and Myrsky prototype the production amounted to 51 in all. Although the aircraft met the specifications set for it, it did not fulfill all expectations due to structural problems. The Myrsky III was ordered in spring 1943, but none were built. Operational history A VL Myrsky II fighter of Finnish Air Force in flight. Reconnaissance Squadron 12 received their first Myrskys during August 1944. Thirty Myrskys were delivered to Reconnaissance Squadrons 12 and 16 before the end of the Continuation War. Fifteen Myrsky fighters flew 68 missions during the Continuation War. During one mission, they met Soviet Yak-7s, but the fight ended without losses for either side. During two other missions, Myrskys damaged two Soviet fighters, which were both destroyed on landing. Six Myrskys took part in a bombing mission on 3 September 1944. During the Lapland War, six Myrskys flew 13 reconnaissance missions during November 1944. The wooden construction proved problematic in this theatre, not enduring wet weather or cold well. The war time Lukko glue, manufactured from ersatz materials, which was used for gluing the wooden parts, did not stand rain, frost and humidity, and the glue seams disintegrated, sometimes with disastrous results. Ten Myrskys were lost in accidents between 1943 and 1947 and four pilots died. Myrsky usage ended in May 1947 and the last Myrsky flight was in February 1948. The Myrsky proved fast and manoeuvrable enough to dogfight the contemporary Soviet aircraft; it was the second fastest Finnish Air Force airplane after the Messerschmitt Bf 109G. Pilots liked the plane as it had good cockpit ergonomics and decent flight and ground handling properties. Its aerodynamic design was excellent, and was later used on the VL Py√∂rremyrsky fighter and the Valmet Vihuri trainer. Its wide undercarriage gave it decent ground-handling properties. Its main drawback was the construction method: the ersatz materials simply did not stand up to the harsh Finnish weather. VL Myrsky II rebuild at the Finnish Aviation Museum July 2018 Three Myrsky fuselages and several parts have survived. The Finnish Aviation Museum is currently (2018) restoring one of them (MY-14) into a complete museum aircraft. The project was on display at Finnish Air Force 100th anniversary air show at Tikkakoski, Jyv√§skyl√§ 16 to 17 June 2018.

EUMM was conceived in September 2008 following the EU-mediated ceasefire agreement, which ended the Russo-Georgian War. The mission has around 200 monitors from various EU member states and operates with an annual budget of roughly 18 million Euros.EUMM, Facts and Figures, Retrieved: 9 May 2016 Its headquarters are in Tbilisi, with field offices in Gori, Mtskheta and Zugdidi. EUMM started its monitoring activities on 1 October 2008 and has since been patrolling both day and night, particularly in areas adjacent to the Administrative Boundary Lines with the Russian-backed separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The organization‚Äôs mission is to ensure that there is no return to hostilities, to facilitate the resumption of a safe and normal life for the local communities living in the areas adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and to build confidence among the conflict parties. EUMM‚Äôs mandate is valid throughout all of Georgia. However, in violation of the 2008 ceasefire agreement, Russia and the self-proclaimed Abkhazian and South Ossetian authorities have so far denied EUMM's access to territories under separatist control. EUMM operates under the Common Security and Defence Policy.  EUMM (previously ECMM) in the former Yugoslavia  The European Union had a monitoring mission in the former Yugoslavia. Former EUMM began operating in July 1991 under the name of ECMM (European Community Monitor Mission). The mission was financed by the European Commission and consisted of 75 field specialists. The mission was headquartered in Zagreb and its designated area included Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Albania and the Republic of Macedonia. ECMM was renamed as European Union Monitoring Mission on 22 December 2000.European Union Special Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina - European Union Monitoring Mission . Retrieved 20 October 2006. In January 1992, the mission was briefly suspended following the helicopter downing that killed five of its observers. The EUMM in the former Yugoslavia ended on December 31, 2007.  EUMM in Georgia  The EUMM patrols the South Ossetian administration boundary line in armored SUVs in February 2012. Following the 2008 South Ossetia war in August 2008, the EU declared on 15 September 2008 to deploy a monitoring mission to Georgia. The main objectives of the mission is to fulfill the European commitment in re-establishing stability and normalisation following the crisis through an observer mission that consists of over 200 field specialists that conduct routine inspections within the stipulated zone of the mission that includes Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The mission is to observe the compliance with the fulfillment of the six-point-agreement established under the French brokered peace plan between Georgia and Russia on 12 August 2008. The mission started its monitoring activities on 1 October 2008, beginning with oversight of the withdrawal of Russian armed forces from the areas adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Mandate of EUMM Georgia  The Mission‚Äôs mandate consists of stabilisation, normalisation and confidence building, as well as reporting to the EU in order to inform European policy-making and thus contribute to the future EU engagement in the region. Originally authorised for 12 months, the mandate has since been extended five times and is currently effective until 14 December 2018. EUMM is mandated to cover the whole territory of Georgia, within the country‚Äôs internationally recognised borders, but the de facto authorities in Abkhazia and South Ossetia have so far denied access to the territories under their control. EUMM signs The Mission is working to prevent the renewal of an armed conflict, as well as to help make the areas adjacent to the Administrative Boundary Lines of the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia safe and secure for the local residents. The Mission wants to contribute to and create conditions whereby civilians can cross the Administrative Boundary Lines of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in both directions without fear and obstacles, thus reducing the detrimental effects of the dividing lines.European Union Monitoring Mission to Georgia http://eumm.eu/en/about_eumm All 27 EU Member States contribute personnel, both women and men, from a variety of civilian, police and military backgrounds.

Biography An account written by a priest in 1752, shortly after her death, is the primary source for her biography, based on his interviews with her and on her writings (no longer extant). Kidnapped at the age of nine, Teresa de Santo Domingo could recall only a few details of her life prior to enslavement. She was born in the territory known to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Spanish and Portuguese navigators as La Mina Baja del Oro, the part of West Africa that extends through present-day eastern Ghana, Togo, Benin, and western Nigeria. She was named Chicaba. The names of her parents suggest that her people were Ewe. Chicaba was kidnapped by Spanish sailors and sold into slavery. She was sent to the island of S√£o Tom√©, where she was baptized and given the name Teresa. During her childhood she was exported to Spain. Perhaps her youth, her illness during the arduous first leg of the Middle Passage, or maybe her enslavers‚Äô belief that the gold bangles (manacles) she wore were signs of her exalted social status convinced the traders that she might bring a special profit in the Spanish market. Juliana Teresa Portocarrero y Meneses, then Duchess of Arcos and later the third wife of the Marquis of Mancera, purchased Teresa/Chicaba. The marquis had been Viceroy of Mexico and, during his tenure there, had been a protector of the writer and nun Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz. As a member of the retinue of this religious aristocratic household, the young slave habituated herself to the piousness of her mistress and developed an intense spiritual life that in time became her key to freedom. In addition, while with the marchioness, Teresa/Chicaba must have acquired the intellectual preparation that enabled her to undertake the customary projects of religious women of the period. Despite or because of the favor the marchioness may have shown Teresa, the young woman was subject to cruelty and violence from the other staff. The biography describes vicious beatings she received from the hands of the housekeeper and the intrusions into her relationship with her confessor by others in the household. In accordance with the behest of her owner, who died in 1703, Teresa was free to enter the Dominican convent of La Penitencia of the Third Order of Saint Mary Magdalene in Salamanca. She traveled to this convent, the only one to accept the black woman after several attempts on her behalf by the members of the household where she had been a slave. She took with her a handsome dowry (more than most nuns entering that community) and expected to be accepted as a member of the community in some official capacity, but was surprised or disappointed when the welcome was not as she expected. She was initially denied by the local bishop, who only granted her permission to work as a maid for the religious community. Some years later, he relented and she made final vows as a Dominican sister. Though professed as a \\"white veiled\\" religious sister, her tasks in the community remained the same despite; she did menial labor and sometimes tended the sick. Race put her at a disadvantage in the highly stratified social hierarchy of monastic houses of the era. Over time, Teresa gained recognition as a healer and a sister with prodigious religious gifts. The annuity bequeathed her in the marchioness‚Äô will as well as donations from people who sought her prayers allowed her to gain ascendancy in the monastery among nuns who were only able to make their professions thanks to her financial help with their dowries. Teresa died on December 6, 1748. She was known for the care she gave to the poor, sick and down-hearted. Her acts of charity, her mystical experiences, and her fame as a healer or miracle worker moved her order soon after her death to commission two portraits of her for purposes of local veneration. At the same time, they initiated the process for her beatification, for which the Theatine priest Paniagua wrote first a funeral oration (Oraci√≥n f√∫nebre en las Exequias de la Madre Sor Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo, de feliz memoria, celebradas en el d√≠a nueve de enero en el Convento de Religiosas Dominicas, vulgo de la Penitencia, Salamanca, 1749) and later the full-length hagiography, that has been published also in English. Paniagua‚Äôs Vida reveals a Catholic piety joined with religious practices retained among some peoples of African descent. Her cause for canonisation is being pursued.

Benjamin Parkyn Richardson (22 July 1857 - 8 August 1910) was a member of the first North-West Legislative Assembly in Northwest Territories, Canada, from 20 June 1888 until 10 October 1891. He settled in present-day Saskatchewan in 1884. Early life Richardson was the third son of the Reverend George Thomas Richardson (1822‚Äì1888), Methodist Minister of Toronto Conference, who came to Canada from Cornwall, England in 1854. He was born at Blenheim in York County, Ontario in 1857. Richardson was educated at the county public schools and Uxbridge High School. He taught school for six years at Uxbridge, and then engaged in farming and stock-raising. He married Margaret Ethel Austin (1856‚Äì1928) of Clough Jordon, Tipperary, Ireland, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 3 October 1882. In 1884, Richardson settled in the North-West Territories and established himself as a farmer and stock breeder. Public life Fort Pelly, followed by Battleford Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories Richardson earned 209 votes to be elected as member for Wolseley (in present- day Saskatchewan) in 1888. He campaigned again and lost in the 1891 Northwest Territories general election, earning 213 votes, while his opponent, James Dill, earned 312. Richardson ran a third time for election in Grenfell in the 1898 Northwest Territories general election, earning 153 votes, while his opponent, Richard Stuart Lake, earned 351. Five general elections would occur between 1888 and 1905, as the territories underwent significant growth. As an assembly member, Richardson was twice appointed to the Advisory Council of Lieutenant Governor Joseph Royal. He also served on its Education, Irrigation, Municipal, and Prairie and Forest Fires committees, among others. Samples of his correspondence with Lieutenant Governor Edgar Dewdney are housed in the archives of the Glenbow Museum in Calgary (Alberta). Other Involvement Richardson served as first president of the Grenfell Agricultural Society formed in 1884, director of the Hospital Board, chairman of the Public School Board, and editor of the Grenfell Sun, of which he was a founder. He was the first vice-president on the Board of Governors of Regina College at the time of its foundation (what has become the University of Regina). As an active member of the Methodist Church, Richardson was vice-president of its Bible Society and the Lord's Day Alliance, a movement founded to combat Sabbath secularisation. He was also director of the Grenfell Cheese Company and Inspector of Agencies for the London and Lancashire Life Assurance Company in Manitoba and the North-West Territories. Richardson died suddenly at age fifty-three of what was diagnosed as Bright's Disease. His funeral service was reported to be crowded at the doors of the local church, and the procession to have numbered over one hundred carriages and to be more than one mile in length. He was survived by his wife and seven children. See also *List of Northwest Territories general elections *Robert G.

It involves: * A pocket in the instrument's body for insertion of neck, as in bolt-on method. However, the pocket is much deeper than usual one. * Long neck plank, comparable to the scale length, as in the neck-through method. * Glueing (setting) the long neck inside the deep pocket, as in the set-neck method. The result is usually told to have combined advantages of all these methods, mostly eliminating their disadvantages. Luthiers frequently cite: * improved tone and sustain (due to deep insertion and body made of single piece of wood, not laminated as in neck-through), * brighter tone (due to set joint) * comfortable access to top frets (due to lack of hard heel and bolt plate), * better wood stability. The main disadvantage is relatively complex construction that leads to higher manufacturing and servicing costs. Another cited disadvantage is the inability or relative complexity of adding a double-locking tremolo to the guitar, as the routing for cavities would interfere with deeply set neck.  Manufacturers  Set-through necks are relatively uncommon, and few manufacturers produce such neck joints. Sometimes, especially if neck extension inside a body does not fill full scale length, such neck joint is marketed as an extended pocket set-in neck or deep-set neck.

Usually, it's hard to determine if the guitar has set-through neck or neck- through body judging only the general outlook. B.C. Rich's Invisibolt Technology is one notable exception that uses black (\\"shadow\\") body and contrasting light neck wood.

The yard is a listed company on the Oslo Stock Exchange and part of the Aker Group controlled by Kjell Inge R√∏kke. The yard targets producing ships within the Jones Act for domestic shipping, primarily product tankers and container ships. The yard was started as a cooperation between Kv√¶rner and the City of Philadelphia, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Government of the United States. Rebuilt and opened in 2000, the yard delivered its first ship in 2003: MV Manukai, a container cargo ship for Matson Line and the first of four sister vessels built for Matson through 2006. In 2005, control of the yard passed to Aker, which bought the troubled Kv√¶rner firm. Aker American Shipping ASA was formed and listed on the Oslo Bors. In 2007, Aker American Shipping was split into two companies - the shipbuilding company, Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, and the ship owning company, Aker American Shipping (today American Shipping Company). In January 2013, the shipyard completed construction of fourteen product tankers for subsidiaries of American Shipping Company (AMSC), Overseas Shipholding Group (OSG) and Crowley. On September 29, 2011, Aker Philadelphia signed a contract with SeaRiver Maritime Inc. (the shipping subsidiary of ExxonMobil) for the construction of two Aframax oil product tankers for delivery in 2014. At 820 ft. in length and measuring over 115,000 tons deadweight, they will be the largest ships yet built by the yard.

There was another Hervaeus Brito of the early 13th century. (c. 1260, N√©dellec, diocese of Tr√©guier, BrittanyRisultato della ricerca Web OPAC ICCU-1323) was a Dominican theologian, the 14th Master of the Dominicans, and the author of a number of works on philosophy and theology. Among his many writings may be included the Summa Totius Logicae, an opusculum once attributed to Thomas Aquinas. Life Natalis joined the Dominicans in 1276. In 1303, he entered the convent of St. Jacques at the University of Paris. On his arrival to St. Jacques, he signed a petition supporting Philip the Fair's attempt to convoke a council in his war with Pope Boniface VIII on grounds of papal jurisdiction. He studied theology in Paris and became French provincial of the Dominicans in 1308. Later in 1318, he was appointed Master General of the Order. A resolute early Thomist,: The first Thomists appear at the end of the thirteenth century and the beginning of the fourteenth. They defend St. Thomas against certain Augustinians of the ancient school, against the Nominalists and the Scotists. In particular, the works of Herve de Nedellec against Henry of Ghent; of Thomas Sutton against Scotus, of Durandus of Aurillac against Durandus of Saint-Pourcain and against the first Nominalists. nicknamed Doctor rarus, he was a tenacious opponent of the theology of Durandus of Saint-Pour√ßain., . His predecessor as Master had appointed him, Peter de la Palu, John of Naples and others as a theological commission to assess the ideas of Durandus. He also opposed Scotism.: a valiant opponent of Scotus. He sought for and obtained the canonization of Aquinas.Ashley/Dominicans: 3 Mystics 1300s He became Master of the Order of Preachers in 1318, a post he held until he died in 1323 on the way to attend the canonization of Thomas Aquinas. As Master of the Order Natalis' tenure as master general of the Order was focused on removing the corruption prevalent in the Dominican Order. His ordered a series of acts that limited the privileges of the elites within the Order. These acts ordered high members of the Order to take part in choir and eat in the refectory along with abolishing the use of titles1. In addition to these acts, Natalis sought to reign in the studia generalia by abolishing the title magister. He also sought to centralize the curriculum and appointments of the studia generalia to the Master General. Differences with Durandus of St. Pour√ßain While Natalis was Durandus' mentor, the two scholars disputed on numerous theological ideas. In a commission investigating the works of Durandus, Natalis found 91 objectionable propositions. From 1309 to 1316, a polemical war ensued between Hervaeus Natalis and Durandus of St. Pour√ßain. Throughout those years, both Natalis and Durandus of St. Pour√ßain exchanged polemics and writings that sought to disprove the other. Near the end of this war, Hervaeus Natalis compiled two censure lists, one in 1314 and one in 1316. These lists gathered the problematic tenets of Durandus' works, and in turn, compelled Durandus to revise his work. Notable works concerning this polemical war include Reprobationes excusationum Durandi, Quodlibet III, and Correctiones super dicta Durandi in Quodlibet Avenonense I. These works either reprimanded Durandus or responded to Durandus' counterattacks to Natalis' arguments. One of Natalis' most significant counters to Durandus was in his Evidentiae contra Durandum super IVum Sent., in which Natalis examines 38 articles where Durandus deviated from the teachings of Aquinas regarding the sacraments.

Provence entered service in March 1916, after the outbreak of World War I. She was armed with a main battery of ten guns and had a top speed of . Provence spent the bulk of her career in the French Mediterranean Squadron, where she served as the fleet flagship. During World War I, she was stationed at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from leaving the Adriatic Sea, but she saw no action. She was modernized significantly in the 1920s and 1930s, and conducted normal peacetime cruises and training maneuvers in the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean. She participated in non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War. In the early days of World War II, Provence conducted patrols and sweeps into the Atlantic to search for German surface raiders. She was stationed in Mers-el- K√©bir when France surrendered on 22 June 1940. Fearful that the Germans would seize the French Navy, the British Royal Navy attacked the ships at Mers-el- K√©bir. Provence was damaged and sank in the harbor, though she was refloated and moved to Toulon, where she became the flagship of the training fleet there. In late November 1942, the Germans occupied Toulon and, to prevent them from seizing the fleet, the French scuttled their ships, including Provence. She was raised in July 1943, and some of her guns were used for coastal defense in the area; the Germans scuttled her a second time in Toulon as a blockship in 1944. Provence was ultimately raised in April 1949 and sold to ship breakers.  Background and description  Brassey's Naval Annual 1915 The Bretagne class was designed as an improved version of the preceding with a more powerful armament, but the limited size of French drydocks forced the turrets to be closer to the ends of the ships, adversely affecting their seakeeping abilities. The ships were long overall, had a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 34 officers and 1,159 men as a private ship and increased to 42 officers and 1,208 crewmen when serving as a flagship. The ships were powered by two license-built Parsons steam turbine sets, each driving two propeller shafts. Each of the Bretagne-class ships had a different type of boiler providing steam to the turbines; Provence herself had 18 Guyot-Du Temple boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of and were designed for a top speed of , but none of the ships exceeded during their sea trials. They carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range of at a speed of . The Bretagne class's main battery consisted of ten Canon de 34 cm (13.4 in) mod√®le 1912 guns mounted in five twin-gun turrets, numbered one to five from front to rear. Two were in a superfiring pair forward, one amidships, and the last two in a superfiring pair aft. The secondary armament consisted of twenty-two Canon de 138 mm (5.4 in) mod√®le 1910 guns in casemates along the length of the hull. She also carried a pair of Canon de mod√®le 1902 guns mounted in the forward superstructure. Five older 47 mm weapons were placed on each turret roof for sub-caliber training before they entered service. The Bretagnes were also armed with four submerged torpedo tubes and could stow 20‚Äì28 mines below decks. Their waterline belt ranged in thickness from and was thickest amidships. The gun turrets were protected by of armor and plates protected the casemates. The curved armored deck was thick on the flat and on the outer slopes. The conning tower had thick face and sides.  Service  US Navy recognition photo of Provence After entering service in 1916, Provence and her sisters were assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, with Provence as the fleet flagship. The three ships remained in the unit for the remainder of the war. They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The fleet's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from their crews for anti-submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro- Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, Provence saw no action during the conflict. Indeed, she did not leave port at all for the entirety of 1917. In April 1919, she returned to Toulon. The French Navy intended to send the ship to the Black Sea to join operations against the Bolsheviks, but a major mutiny prevented the operation. She and Lorraine went to Constantinople in October 1919, where they formed the core of the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron. In June 1921, Provence and Bretagne went to Le Havre for a naval review, and were back in Toulon in September. In 1922, Provence and Lorraine were placed in reserve, leaving Bretagne the only member of her class in service; while out of service, Provence underwent a significant refit. The work lasted from 1 February 1922 to 4 July 1923, and was carried out in Toulon. The ship had her armament improved; her main guns were given greater elevation to increase their range, and four 75 mm M1897 guns were installed on the forward superstructure. A heavy tripod mast with a fire control station and a rangefinder for the ship's anti-aircraft guns were also added. Another refit followed on 12 December 1925 ‚Äì 11 July 1927. The elevation of the main battery guns was again increased, the bow section of the belt armor was removed, and half of her boilers were converted to oil-firing models. A third and final modernization began on 20 September 1931 and lasted until 20 August 1934. The rest of the coal-fired boilers were replaced with six Indret oil-fired boilers, new turbines and main battery guns were installed, along with eight new 75 mm anti-aircraft guns. After emerging from the refit, Provence and Bretagne were assigned to the 2nd Squadron in the Atlantic. There, they joined fleet exercises off the Azores, Madeira, and Morocco. The two ships took part in a cruise to Africa in 1936. In August, they were involved in non-intervention patrols after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War; these patrols lasted until April 1937.  World War II  Provence in harbor At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Provence was in Toulon along with Bretagne in the 2nd Squadron, with Provence serving as the flagship of Vice Admiral Ollive. On 21 October, she went into drydock for periodic maintenance, which lasted until 2 December. Two days later, Provence and Bretagne, along with numerous cruisers and destroyers, sortied from Dakar to cover French merchant shipping off West Africa and the Azores. Around the middle of the month, the French warships returned to port. Provence was then sent to Casablanca, where she joined Force Y. The unit conducted several fruitless sweeps into the Atlantic. While in Gibraltar, she was damaged and forced to return to Toulon for repairs. While en route, she intercepted the Italian passenger ship Oceania; Provence dispatched her to Marseilles so she could be inspected for contraband. Provence sailed for Oran on 24 January 1940, and then returned to Force Y in Dakar. Force Y was transferred to Oran on 11 April, arriving five days later. On 27 April, Provence, her two sisters, and several cruisers were moved to Alexandria. On 18 May, Provence and Bretagne returned to Mers El K√©bir. Following the French surrender on 22 June, the French fleet was to be disarmed under German and Italian supervision, under the terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralize the French fleet at Mers-el-K√©bir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to comply with one of various possible courses of action: these were as follows, either to join the British with the Free French, or to move the ships to French possessions like Martinique where they would be outside the reach of the Axis powers, or to move them to the USA where they would be interned, or to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum. After 10 hours of discussions and the French rejection of any part of the ultimatum, the British ships opened fire. Provence returned fire about 90 seconds after the British attacked, though she had no success against her assailants. Bretagne was hit by several shells and exploded, killing most of her crew. Provence was also hit several times and badly damaged; the shells set her on fire and caused her to settle to the bottom of the harbor, but she did not explode like her sister ship. The ship was subsequently refloated and temporarily repaired, and on 5 November, she was transferred to Toulon, arriving on the 8th. Provence was escorted by the destroyers , , , , and . Beginning on 1 January 1942, Provence became the flagship of the Flag Officer, Training Division. On 27 November, the German Army occupied Toulon, and to prevent them from seizing the fleet there, including Provence, the French scuttled their ships. At the time, Provence was moored next to the old pre- dreadnought and the seaplane carrier . The Italians moved into Toulon and raised Provence on 11 July 1943. Two of her 340 mm guns were removed from the ship and emplaced in a coastal battery at Saint-Mandrier-sur-Mer outside Toulon. The Axis then scuttled the ship a second time, as a blockship in the harbor. Provence was ultimately raised in April 1949 and was broken up for scrap.

Recorded for the album at Prince's home studio in May‚ÄìJune 1982, the song was produced, arranged, composed and performed by Prince with Morris Day later adding his lead vocals. The funky song opens with a drum machine beat, adds guitar, live playing on the cymbals, and finally the bass and keyboards. A similar extended version of this occurs after the main lyrics, but starts with the bass and also includes a lengthy rock guitar solo. The bass is truly the \\"star\\" of this song, and Prince has remarked that this is one of his signature basslines, remarking no one can play the line like himself. He also said the same about the bassline of \\"Let's Work\\". Despite the song being performed nearly entirely by Prince, Day calls out \\"Terry\\" before the bass solo. The drumbeat is also notable for its intricately programmed hi- hat pattern and its off-beat snare, utilizing an on-beat clap during the choruses and outro. In a Facebook post from 2014, Jesse Johnson stated that the beat was a stock drumbeat from the Linn LM-1, programmed by Tower of Power drummer David Garibaldi, and that Prince played the guitar using his Hondo Stratocaster. The U.S. 7-inch single was backed with a non-album track, \\"Grace\\", which is a mock-interview between a cocky Day and an interviewer named Bridgette (played by Bridgette Harrington, who was Prince's accountants secretary), who Day keeps referring to as \\"Grace.\\" The 12-inch single was backed with \\"The Walk\\", where Morris also banters with Vanity and calls her \\"Grace,\\" though it is not known if it is meant to be the reporter once again. \\"777-9311\\" reached number two on the R&B; charts and number 88 on the pop charts. It is one of The Time's signature numbers and is played at nearly all of their concerts. A version recorded live in a 1998 concert segues from \\"Get It Up\\" and was included on Day's 2004 album, It's About Time. The song's title, \\"777-9311\\", was Prince guitarist Dez Dickerson's actual telephone number at the time the song was written.

Also known as the First Division, this unit served the dual purposes of providing security for the Emperor of Ethiopia, and being an elite infantry division. It was not, however, part of the organizational structure of the Ethiopian regular army as it was part of the Zebagna, the Addis Ababa Guard. The Kebur Zabagna was based at Addis Ababa. Overview Richard Pankhurst dates the formation of the Imperial Bodyguard (previously known as the Mehal Sefari) to 1917, when the Regent Ras Tafari (later the Emperor Haile Selassie) assembled a unit under his direct control from men who had trained in the British army in Kenya as well as a few who had served under the Italians in Tripoli. In 1930 as Negus he invited a Belgian military mission to train and modernize the Ethiopian military, which included the Kebur Zabagna. The unit was organized in three battalions of trained regular infantry armed with rifles, machineguns and mortars; one battalion consisted of men from the earlier mahal safari. The Kebur Zabagna also had one heavy machine-gun company. It was commanded by Ethiopian graduates of Saint Cyr, the French military academy, at the time of the Italian invasion of Ethiopia.Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia, second edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2001), p. 148 As a unit, the Imperial Bodyguard only participated in the Battle of Maychew (31 March 1936), where they inflicted heavy losses on the 2nd Eritrean Division until the Ethiopian troops were forced to withdraw; the Imperial Guard thereafter served in the rearguard. Afterwards many of its members joined the various groups of the Ethiopian resistance. Following the return of Emperor Haile Selassie to Ethiopia, the Kebur Zabagna was reconstituted, and a Swedish military mission aided in its training. Men for the Kagnew Battalion, which fought in the Korean War, were drawn from the Imperial Bodyguard.Bahru Zewde, A History, p. 186, and Fantahun Ayele, \\"The Ethiopian Army: from Victory to Collapse 1977-91, Evanston, Northwestern University Press, 2014, 12. \\"It remained the elite force of the empire,\\" notes historian Bahru Zewde, \\"until discredited in the wake of the attempted coup of 1960.\\" That unsuccessful coup had been planned by its commander Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway, and his brother Germame Neway.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time (New York: Palgrave, 2000), pp. 254f. In 1961 it numbered nine battalions; in 1969 some 7,000 men. In 1974 the Commander was Major-General Tafessa Lemma. The Kebur Zabagna was disbanded after the Derg consolidated their hold on Ethiopia. The first permanent military band in the country to be established the Imperial Bodyguard Ban in 1929 under the direction of Swiss conductor Andre Nicod. Notable members of the Imperial Bodyguard Band included Tilahun Gessesse and Mahmoud Ahmed. It was notable for its implementation of western style military music conventions in a first for any African nation.Kidane, Birhane (1993).

Bretagne entered service in February 1916, after the start of World War I. She spent the bulk of her nearly 25-year-long career in the Mediterranean Squadron and sometimes served as its flagship. During World War I she provided cover for the Otranto Barrage that blockaded the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea, but saw no action. The ship was significantly modernised in the interwar period, and when she was on active duty, conducted normal peacetime cruises and training manoevres in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean. After World War II broke out in September 1939, Bretagne escorted troop convoys and was briefly deployed to the Atlantic in search of German blockade runners and commerce raiders. Germany invaded France on 10 May 1940 and the French surrendered only six weeks later, at which time the battleship was stationed in Mers-el-K√©bir, French Algeria. Fearful that the Germans would seize the French Navy, the British attacked the ships there on 3 July 1940 after the French refused to surrender or demilitarise the fleet; Bretagne was hit four times and exploded, killing the majority of her crew. Her wreck was salvaged in 1952 and broken up for scrap.  Background and description  Brassey's Naval Annual 1915 The Bretagne class of dreadnought battleships was designed as an improved version of the preceding with a more powerful armament, but the limited size of French drydocks forced the turrets to be closer to the ends of the ships, adversely affecting their seakeeping abilities.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 176‚Äì177 The ships were long overall,Dumas, p. 79 had a beam of and a mean draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 34 officers and 1,159 men as a private ship and increased to 42 officers and 1,208 crewmen when serving as a flagship. The ships were powered by two licence-built Parsons steam turbine sets, each driving two propeller shafts,Jordan & Caresse, p. 163 using steam provided by twenty-four Niclausse boilers.Dumas, p. 81 The turbines were rated at a total of and were designed for a top speed of , but none of the ships exceeded during their sea trials. They carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range of at a speed of . The Bretagne class's main battery consisted of ten Canon de 34 cm (13.4 in) mod√®le 1912 guns mounted in five twin-gun turrets, numbered one to five from front to rear. Two were in a superfiring pair forward, one amidships, and the last two in a superfiring pair aft. The secondary armament consisted of twenty-two Canon de 138 mm (5.4 in) mod√®le 1910 guns mounted individually in casemates along the length of the hull. She also carried a pair of Canon de mod√®le 1902 guns mounted in the forward superstructure in single mounts. Five older 47 mm weapons were installed for sub-calibre training, one on each turret roof, before they entered service. The Bretagnes were also armed with a pair of submerged torpedo tubes on each broadside and could stow 20‚Äì28 mines below decks. Their waterline belt ranged in thickness from and was thickest amidships. Armour plate that was thick protected the gun turrets and plates protected the casemates. The curved armoured deck was thick on the flat and on the outer slopes. The armour of the conning tower was thick.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 163, 168, 172‚Äì175  Construction and career  1912‚Äì1923 Bretagne in Toulon harbour, 23 October 1916 The ship was ordered on 1 May 1912Jordan & Caresse, p. 162 and named in honour of the province of Brittany.Silverstone, p. 92 Bretagne was laid down on 22 July 1912 at the Bret Arsenal, launched on 21 April 1913, completed on 29 November 1915, and commissioned into the fleet on 10 February 1916. After entering service, she was assigned to the 1st Division (1√®re Division) of the 1st Battle Squadron (1√®re Escadre de ligne) and became the flagship of Vice-Admiral (Vice-amiral) Dominique-Marie Gauchet, commander of the squadron, on 10 May.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 163, 244‚Äì245 They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. They also supported the Otranto Barrage, a barrier erected to block German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats operating in the Mediterranean.Halpern, p. 19 The fleet's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from her crew for anti- submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro-Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, Bretagne saw no action during the conflict. In fact, she did not leave port at all for the entirety of 1917,Whitley, pp. 42‚Äì43 due to a severe shortage of coal at Corfu. The 47 mm mod√®le 1902 guns were replaced by a pair of Canon de mod√®le 1897 guns on anti-aircraft (AA) mounts in 1918.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 168, 277 Bretagne returned to Toulon after the war's end in November.Whitley, p. 43 The ship received a lengthy refit there from 12 June 1919 to 18 October 1920. This included modifications to her gun turrets which increased the elevation of her main armament from 12¬∞ to 18¬∞ and thus their maximum range. The four forward 138 mm guns were removed and their casemates plated over, because they could only be worked in good weather‚Äîin rough seas, water would frequently rush over the guns. The 75 mm AA guns were replaced by four 75 mm mod√®le 1918 AA guns mounted amidships. The ship's foremast was replaced by a tripod mast and her mainmast was shortened to allow the ship to fly a captive kite balloon. A Vickers fire-control director that was equipped with a rangefinder was installed atop the tripod mast; two other rangefinders were added, one on each side of the superstructure for the 138 mm guns. Flying-off platforms were fitted to the roofs of Turrets 2 and 4, but these were unsuccessful.Jordan & Caresse, p. 304 Bretagne became flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron againMeirat, p. 26 on 6 June 1921 when Vice-Admiral Henri Salaun hoisted his flag aboard her.Jordan & Caresse, p. 247 The ship accompanied her sister ship to Le Havre for a naval review that month, and they were back in Toulon in September. During this period, Lieutenant de vaisseau Paul Teste used Bretagne in a series of dive- bombing experiments.Smith, p. 22 Bretagne and the battleship hosted the British battleship and the light cruiser during a port visit to Villefranche from 18 February to 1 March 1922. The two French battleships had a gunnery exercise on 28 June using the former Austro-Hungarian battleship as a target and sank her. On 18 July, Bretagne, France and the battleship began a cruise visiting French ports in the Bay of Biscay and English Channel. On the evening of 25/26 August, France struck an uncharted rock while entering Quiberon and sank several hours later. Bretagne and Paris were able to rescue all but three of her crew. During a training exercise, Bretagne briefly ran aground in the Bizerte canal in Tunisia on 22 June 1923, but was not damaged.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 289‚Äì290 Provence relieved Bretagne as the fleet flagship on 1 September. 1924‚Äì1939 Bretagnes aft turrets, 1919 She received a major refit at Toulon from 1 May 1924 to 28 September 1925, during which the elevation of her main armament was increased to 23¬∞, giving her guns a maximum range of , and two high-angle rangefinders were added for the AA guns. Part of her forward hull armour was removed to lighten the bow and increase her forward freeboard, one group of boilers was converted to oil-firing and the flying-off platforms were removed. The ship resumed her position as flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron when her refit was completed. Bretagne transported the Navy Minister, Georges Leygues, to Malta for an official visit over the period 27 April ‚Äì 1 May 1926.Jordan & Caresse, p. 290 Provence reassumed the role of fleet flagship on 1 October 1927 when Bretagne prepared to begin a refit to overhaul her boilers that began on 15 November and lasted until 12 May 1928. The navy took the opportunity to upgrade her fire-control systems, replacing her Vickers model with a French Saint Chamond-Granat system in a director-control tower (DCT), and replaced all of her original rangefinders with the exception of the rangefinders in each turret. A pair of rangefinders were added on the conning tower roof, another one in the DCT at the top of the foremast and another at the base of the mainmast. A rangefinder was added to the DCT to measure the distance between the target and shell splashes, and a traversable rangefinder was fitted to the roof of No. 2 turret. Directors with 2-metre rangefinders were also added to control the secondary guns.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 306‚Äì307 On 3 July 1928, Bretagne, Provence and their sister participated in a fleet review by the President of France, Gaston Doumergue, at Le Havre and they spent the following year in the Mediterranean. Bretagne, Provence and Paris participated in another fleet review by Doumergue on 10 May 1930 that commemorated the centennial of the conquest of Algeria. On 1 October 1930, Bretagne was decommissioned in anticipation of a modernisation that began on 1 July 1932. Her original coal- fired boilers were replaced by new and smaller oil-burning ones, which allowed the No. 2 boiler room to be converted into an oil tank. This increased her fuel capacity to . Geared Parsons cruise turbines were fitted to the inboard propeller shafts and the outer high-pressure turbines were replaced. The four aft 138 mm guns were removed and their casemates plated over. The four 75 mm mle 1918 AA guns were replaced by eight Canon de 75 mm mod√®le 1922 AA guns and the torpedo tubes were removed. A new DCT was installed as were a pair of anti-aircraft directors fitted with 2-metre rangefinders.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 291, 307‚Äì308 After the modernisation was completed on 12 November 1934, Bretagne remained in Toulon for working up until 11 May 1935, when she left to join her sisters in the 2nd Division (2e Division) of the 2nd Battle Squadron (2e Escadre de ligne) for manoevres off the Azores. The ships also made port visits in the islands and French Morocco before sailing to Brest where they arrived on 16 June. As tensions with Nazi Germany rose, the French naval command decided that the squadron based in Brest should be strengthened to deter Germany, so Bretagne and her sisters were stationed there for most of the rest of the decade.Jordan & Moulin, p. 168 Later in June 1934, Bretagne participated in exercises with the combined fleet. She was briefly refitted from 29 October to 3 December. Together with Provence, Bretagne had gunnery practice off Groix, Brittany, on 7‚Äì11 July. On 15 August, the 2nd Squadron was renamed the Atlantic Squadron (Escadre de l'Atlantique). Beginning in 1936, all three sisters had their 4.57-metre rangefinders replaced by ones. The 2nd Battle Division visited ports in the Azores, Madeira, Portuguese Cape Verde, and French Morocco, returning to Brest on 26 February 1937. Later that year Navy Minister Alphonse Gasnier-Duparc reviewed the combined Atlantic and Mediterranean Squadrons on 27 May after that year's fleet manoevres. Beginning in 1938, the sisters had the rangefinder in the DCT replaced by a model. Bretagne finished a refit on 1 October 1938 and was then working up until May 1939. The 2nd Battle Division was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron on 10 June 1939.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 294‚Äì295, 310  World War II  Provence after her 1934 modernisation At the start of World War II in September 1939, the division was based in Toulon. At the time, Italy was neutral, so there was no immediate threat in the Mediterranean. Nonetheless, the sisters escorted troop convoys between France and French North Africa from 1 September to 5 October.Jordan & Caresse, p. 311 On 4 December, Bretagne and Provence, along with the cruisers Colbert, Dupleix, and Primauguet and several destroyers and submarines operated out of Dakar, French West Africa in search of German commerce raiders and blockade runners without success. Around the middle of the month, the task force began to return to the Mediterranean.Rohwer, p. 10 After returning to Toulon, Bretagne underwent an extensive overhaul, which lasted until 3 March 1940, during which her 8-metre rangefinder was replaced by a rangefinder.Jordan & Caresse, p. 310 On 11 March, she left France carrying 1,820 boxes of gold bars from the French treasury together with the heavy cruiser Alg√©rie, which carried another 1,179 boxes. These two ships were designated Force X. They arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 22 March. On the return voyage, they escorted two American merchant ships carrying 82 aircraft bought by France and arrived at Toulon on 10 April. Five days later, Bretagne sailed to Oran, French Algeria, together with Lorraine, arriving on the 18th where they joined Provence. On 27 April, the 2nd Battle Division was transferred to Algiers and then to Alexandria, Egypt.Jordan & Moulin, p. 179Jordan & Caresse, p. 312Rohwer, pp. 16, 21 Bretagne and her sisters passed through the Strait of Sicily on 30 April, covered by the French 3rd Cruiser Division on their way to Alexandria. While still en route, they met the British battleships and , after which the cruisers departed, leaving the battleships to continue on to their destination, where they were assigned to a new Force X.Jordan & Moulin, p. 182 As war with Italy became increasingly likely following Germany's invasion of France on 10 May, the Anglo-French naval command decided to concentrate naval forces in the western Mediterranean. Bretagne and Provence were accordingly recalled from Force X; they left Alexandria on 20 May, their place in Force X being taken by a pair of cruisers. Bretagne and Provence steamed together with two destroyers and reached Bizerte on 23 May. Admiral Fran√ßois Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Navy, decided that all capital ships should be concentrated in Mers El K√©bir, so he instructed them to steam there. Bretagne and Provence arrived there on 27 May, where they rendezvoused with the Force de Raid, France's most modern ships, in an unsuccessful effort to deter Italy from joining the war.Brown, p. 23  Loss  Bretagne, partially obscured by the shell splash, is on fire and sinking by the stern, 3 July 1940 Following the French surrender on 22 June 1940, the French fleet was to be disarmed under German and Italian supervision. The British high command was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then overmatch the Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice-Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralise the French fleet at Mers-el-K√©bir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, surrender for internment, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum; the French rejected it, and so the British ships opened fire.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 312‚Äì313 Bretagne, having remained in Mers El K√©bir since being stationed there one month earlier, was hit by four projectiles from , , and (no ship is individually credited). The first two shells struck simultaneously at 16:59 in the third salvo. The first hit the ship near turret No. 4, causing a large explosion that sent flames as high as the masthead and blew a hole in the side of the hull. The resulting flooding limited the explosion's effect on the ship. The second shell struck above the waterline, and detonated in the centre engine room, killing all but one of the sailors inside. It knocked out all power and damaged the internal communication system of the ship. Seven minutes later, two other large shells struck Bretagne. One detonated near Turret No. 3 and ignited some ready-use projectiles which were stored in lockers next to the anti-aircraft mounts. At 17:09 a large explosion occurred in the ship and she rolled over and capsized with the loss of 36 officers, 151 petty officers and 825 seamen. The Soci√©t√© de mat√©rial naval du Midi attempted to salvage the wreck in late 1942, but it was called off after a diver was seriously injured by an explosion when attempting to cut through the hull with an oxy-acetylene torch. The Serra Fr√®res company salvaged Bretagnes wreck, breaking up the vessel for scrap beginning in 1952 and completing the job on 21 December 1954.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 314‚Äì315 Notes Citations  References        Further reading  * Category:Bretagne-class battleships Category:World War I battleships of France Category:World War II battleships of France Category:Shipwrecks of Algeria Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea Category:Ships built in France Category:1913 ships Category:Naval magazine explosions Category:Maritime incidents in July 1940 ","title":"French battleship Bretagne"},{"id":"7152070","text":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a dagger category (also called involutive category or category with involution) is a category equipped with a certain structure called dagger or involution. The name dagger category was coined by Peter Selinger.  Formal definition  A dagger category is a category \\\\mathcal{C} equipped with an involutive functor \\\\dagger\\\\colon \\\\mathcal{C}^{op}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathcal{C} that is the identity on objects, where \\\\mathcal{C}^{op} is the opposite category. In detail, this means that it associates to every morphism f\\\\colon A\\\\to B in \\\\mathcal{C} its adjoint f^\\\\dagger\\\\colon B\\\\to A such that for all f\\\\colon A\\\\to B and g\\\\colon B\\\\to C, * \\\\mathrm{id}_A = \\\\mathrm{id}_A^\\\\dagger\\\\colon A \\\\rightarrow A * (g \\\\circ\\\\\\\\! f)^\\\\dagger = f^\\\\dagger \\\\\\\\!\\\\circ g^\\\\dagger\\\\colon C \\\\rightarrow A * f^{\\\\dagger\\\\dagger} \\\\\\\\!= f\\\\colon A \\\\rightarrow B Note that in the previous definition, the term \\"adjoint\\" is used in a way analogous to (and inspired by) the linear-algebraic sense, not in the category-theoretic sense. Some sources define a category with involution to be a dagger category with the additional property that its set of morphisms is partially ordered and that the order of morphisms is compatible with the composition of morphisms, that is a < b implies a\\\\circ c for morphisms a, b, c whenever their sources and targets are compatible.  Examples  * The category Rel of sets and relations possesses a dagger structure: for a given relation R:X \\\\rightarrow Y in Rel, the relation R^\\\\dagger:Y \\\\rightarrow X is the relational converse of R. In this example, a self-adjoint morphism is a symmetric relation. * The category Cob of cobordisms is a dagger compact category, in particular it possesses a dagger structure. * The category Hilb of Hilbert spaces also possesses a dagger structure: Given a bounded linear map f:A \\\\rightarrow B, the map f^\\\\dagger:B \\\\rightarrow A is just its adjoint in the usual sense. * Any monoid with involution is a dagger category with only one object. In fact, every endomorphism hom-set in a dagger category is not simply a monoid, but a monoid with involution, because of the dagger. * A discrete category is trivially a dagger category. * A groupoid (and as trivial corollary, a group) also has a dagger structure with the adjoint of a morphism being its inverse. In this case, all morphisms are unitary (definition below).  Remarkable morphisms  In a dagger category \\\\mathcal{C}, a morphism f is called * unitary if f^\\\\dagger = f^{-1}, * self-adjoint if f^\\\\dagger = f. The latter is only possible for an endomorphism f\\\\colon A \\\\to A. The terms unitary and self- adjoint in the previous definition are taken from the category of Hilbert spaces, where the morphisms satisfying those properties are then unitary and self-adjoint in the usual sense.

During the Soviet era, it had been deprived of its reserve status, but was restored later.Ministry of Ecology: Goy Gol State Reserve Flora and fauna Flora Forest in G√∂yg√∂l National Park The area of G√∂yg√∂l is almost entirely covered by forests and has a rich flora with over 420 plant species, including 20 which are endemic to the area. The major types of trees are chestnut-leaved oak (Quercus castaneifolia), Caucasian oak (Quercus macranthera), Caucasian ash (Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. oxycarpa), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), Oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis), Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), velvet maple (Acer velutinum), Cappadocian maple (Acer cappadocicum), Caucasian lime tree (Tilia dasystyla subsp. caucasica), etc. Shrub species occurring in the area include the medlar (Crataegus azarolus subsp. pontica), European barberry (Berberis vulgaris), European cornel (Cornus mas), European spindle (Euonymus europaeus), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), etc. Fauna Horses in G√∂yg√∂l National Park There are several endemic subspecies of birds, of which the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo), black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), golden oriole (Oriolus oriolus), mistle thrush (Turdus viscivorus), stock dove (Columba oenas), Eurasian woodcock (Scolopax rusticola), woodlark (Lullula arborea), mute swan (Cygnus olor), common quail (Coturnix coturnix), Caspian titmouse (Poecile hyrcanus) subspecies of the titmouse; the Caucasus pheasant (Phasianus colchicus colchicus) subspecies of the common pheasant are common. The Caspian tiger (Panthera tigris virgata) once roamed these mountains, but is now extinct. Other large mammals here are the lynx (Lynx lynx), brown bear (Ursus arctos), wild boar (Sus scrofa), wolf (Canis lupus), golden jackal (Canis aureus), jungle cat (Felis chaus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger (Meles meles), etc. The Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) subspecies of the leopard, lives in the southern regions in Azerbaijan, primarily in the Talysh Mountains, Nagorno-Karabakh and Nakhichevan. Despite occasional sightings, it was not clear whether leopards had been extinct in Azerbaijan by the late 1990s until a species was caught on camera in March, 2007 in the Hirkan National Park. However it is still not clear if leopards live in the G√∂yg√∂l National Park.  Filmography  A documentary film titled ‚ÄúG√∂yg√∂l Milli Parkƒ±‚Äù (Goygol National Park) was shot in 2015.

The village is north-west of Pendle Hill, east of Clitheroe, and is in the Ribble Valley district. As it is only a small village, with a population of 76 at the 2001 census, it has no parish council, but instead has a parish meeting. The parish meeting is shared with Mearley, a small parish south of Worston with no villages or hamlets and a population of 25, the second smallest in Lancashire. From the 2011 Census population information for both Mearley and Worston is included within the civil parish of Pendleton. The village has a public house \\"The Calf's Head\\". The single road that passes through the village continues as a single track road to Downham. Worston is bypassed to the west by the A59 road, which passes through the edge of the parish. Slightly further north is the route of a Roman road, which forms part of the parish boundary. Worston was once a township in the ancient parish of Whalley. This became a civil parish in 1866, forming part of the Clitheroe Rural District from 1894 till 1974. Mearley was also once a township in the ancient parish of Whalley. This became a civil parish in 1866, forming part of the Clitheroe Rural District from 1894 till 1974.

Newton and Penosi Not much is known about Penosi's earlier years other than his being convicted of murder as a juvenile. In 1971, Penosi was convicted of tax evasion for not paying income taxes for several years during the 1960s. During the 1960s, Penosi met Newton while he was performing at New York City's famous Copacabana Club. After that meeting, their friendship continued to develop. According to court records, Newton's office calendar marked Penosi's birthday prominently and Newton spent almost a month with Penosi in Florida. Penosi attended the wedding of Newton's brother, Jerry. In 1976, Newton flew to Los Angeles with his band to perform for Penosi's son free of charge. Problem and payment In 1980, Newton approached Penosi for help. Newton had pulled out of a Las Vegas tabloid show called Backstage. As a result, he had been receiving threats from other organized crime figures. To help Newton, Penosi contacted his cousin Frank Piccolo, who allegedly solved the problem. However, Newton may not have realized that Penosi and Piccolo expected some payback for this favor. As Judge William Norris of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit wrote, \\"Newton went to Penosi with a problem and Penosi called Piccolo who helped solve the problem. Piccolo and Penosi later discussed 'earning off' Newton and possibly 'earning off' his ownership of the Aladdin Hotel. Piccolo and Penosi were investigated and indicted by a federal grand jury, which heard the testimony of Wayne Newton. All of these facts are beyond dispute.\\" Newton originally tried to deny any relationship with Penosi. Judge Norris wrote that Newton, :\\"...testified falsely that Penosi had never visited him\\" and that it was \\"...undisputed that a disagreement over an amount not less than $20,000...\\" had motivated Newton to go to Penosi for help.Floyd Abrams, Speaking Freely, published by Viking Press (2005), Page 109 and Page 122. This episode became public when the NBC TV network did an expos√© on Newton's alleged mob connections. Newton tried to block NBC in court from airing the program, but failed. In June 1981, Penosi and Piccolo were charged with conspiring to extort money and 'valuable rights' from Newton and entertainer Lola Falana.New York Times, The Region; 2 Allegedly in Mobs Accused of Extortion, June 13, 1981. The first trial resulted in a hung jury and the second trial in 1982 found Penosi not guilty on all charges. Quotes about Penosi * \\"Then there was the deposition my partner, Tom Kavaler, took of Guido Penosi, who arrived at the deposition open-shirted, adorned with large gold jewellery and dressed‚ÄîI know of no other way to say it‚Äîlike someone involved in organized crime. Tom questioned Penosi about his relationship with Newton and received detailed responses. When Tom asked Penosi, as he sometimes was obliged to, if he had engaged in one criminal act or another, Penosi would respond, \\"I take the Fifth\\" (pronounced \\"Fiff\\"), and Tom, at ever break, would carefully assure Penosi that he was just doing his job.

The village forms part of the Worthen with Shelve civil parish, which includes the hamlet of Little Worthen immediately to the north-east and the villages of Brockton and Pennerley, in addition to several smaller settlements. It sits in the Rea Brook valley. To the south are the Stiperstones and the Bromlow Callow, known for the small clump of trees on top. To the north is Long Mountain. The village contains the Church of England parish church, All Saints, a functioning Methodist Chapel, a school with Eco- School status, a village hall built in 1977 and a post office housed within the local shop. Hampton Hall, a grade II* listed country house, is nearby.  History  Population The population of Worthen has fluctuated throughout history since the first census was taken in 1801 recording the population at 1,799. A slight decrease followed in 1811 before a steady increase to the peak of the population in 1881 at 3,029. A slight decrease followed this until 1851 when a small increase occurred bringing the population to 1,965. According to the 2001 census the population was 1,929 with a total of 775 households in the parish, the population increasing to 2,078 at the 2011 Census. Employment Worthen post office Worthen's population was predominantly characterised by labourers as recorded in the 1831 census, which showed a more organised classification of occupation, during this year there were 393 recorded labourers and servants employed in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. A more detailed census was taken in 1881, which showed a greater working population of 437 male workers in mineral substances and 240 male workers in agriculture. Mining was a major employment sector and well known mines included Snailbeach, a lead-ore mine, Perkins‚Äô Beach lead mine and additionally grit and gravel mines.

Bed frames are typically made of wood or metal. A bed frame includes head, foot, and side rails. It may also include slats to support the mattress, in which case a separate base is not necessary, as in a platform bed. Most double (full) sized beds, along with all queen and king size beds, require some type of center support rail, typically also with extra feet extending down to the floor. The term \\"bed frame\\" was first used in 1805-1815. Brass beds Brass beds are beds in which the headboard and footboard are made of brass; the frame rails are usually made of steel. Brass beds can be made of 100 per cent brass or of metals that have been brass- plated. The brass used in making brass beds is usually 70 per cent copper and 30 per cent zinc. The ratio of metals may vary between manufacturers. Ethiopian charpai type bed frames Brass beds were originally simple and plain. Throughout the centuries, designs have become increasingly elaborate and can contain extensive ornamentation such as porcelain finials. Some brass bed styles include traditional, Art Deco, Victorian, transitional, Edwardian and contemporary. Assembling a bed Iron beds Iron beds are beds in which the headboard and footboard are made of iron; the frame rails are usually made of steel. Iron beds were developed in 17th century Italy to address concerns about infestation by bed bugs and moths. An iron cradle (with dangerously pointed corner posts) has been dated to 1620-1640. From the start of their production in the 1850s until World War I, iron beds were handmade. The manufacturing process included hand pouring and polishing intricately detailed casting and hand applying finishes. In the many small foundries of the time that employed only a handful of employees, it could take days to produce a single bed. After the end of World War I, the mass-production methods used for wartime affected the iron industry as well. The handmade quality gave way to cost-effective mass production. Today‚Äôs iron beds are constructed of cold roll, heavy-gauge steel tubing and solid bar stock. Almost all iron beds now have a beech wood sprung slatted base in a steel framework which gives support to all types of mattresses. Wooden drawer beds Some wooden-based beds have drawers. The bed frame is a wooden box with a hole cut out for the mattress, with drawers underneath.

The route has a length of about 500 km (approximately 310 miles). It was established in 1966, being one of the first theme routes in Germany. There is an extension to the route into Switzerland and Austria around Lake Constance. Its logo depicts a yellow putto on a green background, putti being typical of the Baroque Era. Origin After the end of the Thirty Years' War and its ravages in 1648, followed by the counter-reformation instigated by the Catholic Church, an explosion of building works took place in the region of Upper Swabia. Immigrants to depopulated areas within Upper Swabia contributed to an economic upturn, which made it possible even for the owners of the smallest villages to secure sufficient funds to restore, extend and enhance the already existing buildings in Baroque style. This included monasteries as well as secular buildings such as castles and commercial buildings.Jan Koppmann, \\"Das Zeitalter des Barock\\", in M. Thierer (ed.), Lust auf Barock. Himmel trifft Erde in Oberschwaben, p. 11f. The result of this is today called Upper Swabian Baroque. It lasted from ca. 1650 until the French Revolution. The nobility, whose territories were mostly of a small or only modest size, converted its dwelling places to Baroque style, utilising existing structures. Some new buildings were erected by the nobility, the result of which, however, often did not come close to the quality and extent of those erected by the clergy. This was due to the nobility's lack of financial means.Michael Barczyk, \\"Reiche Kl√∂ster, barocke Bauwut. Warum gerade Oberschwaben \\"Himmelreich des Barock\\"?\\", in M. Thierer (ed.), Lust auf Barock. Himmel trifft Erde in Oberschwaben, p. 102 The monasteries, on the other hand, did have larger funds at their disposal as their respective territories were considerably larger than those of secular lords which meant that they could employ more dependants for the constructions work under the rules of feudal obligations (socage). Also, the monks themselves were unpaid and some of the artistic works were carried out by monks themselves.Michael Barczyk, \\"Reiche Kl√∂ster, barocke Bauwut. Warum gerade Oberschwaben \\"Himmelreich des Barock\\"?\\", in M. Thierer (ed.), Lust auf Barock. Himmel trifft Erde in Oberschwaben, p. 103 The re-organization of Europe under Napoleon at the beginning of the 19th century (also known as German Mediatisation), however, meant that the Imperial Abbeys, the Free Imperial Cities and the territories ruled by Imperial Knights (Reichsritter) lost their independence and their income. Many buildings were converted into barracks, schools, psychiatric hospitals or even manufacturing sites. Only in the 20th century, efforts have been made to save and restore these monuments of the past.

Sleeve notes from Introducing... Rub√©n Gonz√°lez, World Circuit Records WCD 049, 1997. Every morning during the recording of A Toda Cuba le Gusta (produced by Juan de Marcos Gonz√°lez), Rub√©n would wait for the studio's doors to open and would rush to the piano and play. The same would happen throughout the recording of Buena Vista Social Club (produced by Ry Cooder). After these two albums were completed, Rub√©n was still at the piano.

PGE uses these rules to convert a parsing expression grammar into Parrot bytecode. It is therefore compiling rules into a program, unlike most virtual machines and runtimes, which store regular expressions in a secondary internal format that is then interpreted at runtime by a regular expression engine. The rules format used by PGE can express any regular expression and most formal grammars, and as such it forms the first link in the compiler chain for all of Parrot's front-end languages. When executed, the bytecode generated by PGE will parse text as described in the input rules, generating a parse tree. The parse tree can be manipulated directly, or fed into the next stage of the Parrot compiler toolchain in order to generate an AST from which code generation can occur (if the grammar describes a programming language). History Originally named P6GE and written in C, PGE was translated to native Parrot and renamed not long after its initial release in November 2004. Its author is Patrick R. Michaud. PGE was written in order to reduce the amount of work required to implement a compiler on top of Parrot. It was also written to allow Perl 6 to easily self-host, though current Pugs development no longer uses PGE as its primary rules back-end in favor of a native engine called PCR. Internals PGE combines three styles of parsing: * Raku rules * an operator precedence parser * custom parse subroutines The primary form is Raku rules, so a PGE rule might look like this for an addition-only grammar: rule term { \\\\\\\\( \\\\\\\\) } rule number { \\\\d+ } rule expr { ( '+' )* } The operator precedence parser allows an operator table to be built and used directly in a Perl 6 rule style parser like so: rule expr is optable { ... } rule term { \\\\\\\\( \\\\\\\\) } rule number { \\\\d+ } proto term: is precedence('=') is parsed(&term;) {...} proto infix:+ is looser('term:') {...} This accomplishes the same goal of defining a simple, addition-only grammar, but does so using a combination of a Raku style regex/rules for \`term\` and \`number\` and a shift-reduce optable for everything else.  Code generation  Though PGE outputs code which will parse the grammar described by a rule, and can be used at run time to handle simple grammars and regular expressions found in code, its primary purpose is for the parsing of high level languages. The Parrot compiler toolchain is broken into several parts, of which PGE is the first. PGE converts source code to parse trees. The Tree Grammar Engine (TGE) then converts these into Parrot Abstract Syntax Trees (PAST). A second TGE pass then converts a PAST into Parrot Opcode Syntax Trees (POST) which can be directly transformed into executable bytecode.

It was originally published in 1941 in the United Kingdom by Heinemann, London and in the United States by Doubleday, New York as The Sabotage Murder Mystery. It is the eleventh novel in the Albert Campion series and is set during the Second World War. Plot introduction Albert Campion wakes in hospital suffering from amnesia. He knows there is something vital he must do, but he cannot remember what it is ‚Äì or even his own name. He finds himself on the run, suspected of attacking a policeman, as he tries to avert a catastrophe. The action takes place during the early years of the Second World War in the fictional town of Bridge in South West England, which is run by an ancient hereditary organisation, the Masters of Bridge. Traitor's Purse (1941), 2006 Vintage paperback edition Plot summary In the early days of World War II, a man wakes in a country hospital to find he cannot remember anything prior to his arrival except that he has something vital to do, somehow connected to the number fifteen. He hears voices outside discussing an unconscious patient ‚Äì who they say has killed a policeman and will be hanged. Assuming that he is the patient being discussed, the man escapes in a stolen car but soon realises he is being followed. Instead of the police, however, the car is driven by a woman who appears to assisting the amnesiac man in his mission; she refers to him as \\"Albert Campion\\". The car also contains an old man, Mr Anscombe. After seeing Anscombe home, the two continue to the house of Lee Aubrey, the head of a local scientific research body called the Institute, with whom they are staying. Campion begins to remember the woman, who is called Amanda, and due to their familiarity begins to assume that they are married, only to be shocked when Amanda informs him she wants to break off their engagement. As such, he does not tell her about his amnesia. Campion receives a letter from Stanislaus Oates, an acquaintance from Scotland Yard, telling him to investigate Anscombe ‚Äì moments before Superintendent Hutch of the local police arrives to inform the party that Anscombe is dead. Campion, the last person to see Anscombe alive, accompanies Hutch to the scene of the death, and the two are joined by Pyne, a fellow guest of Aubrey's. Pyne's familiar, friendly manner convinces Campion that the two are friends, prompting him to confide in Pyne. Campion is thus horrified when, after Pyne leaves, Hutch informs him that they had only met three days before. Amanda tells Campion that she is falling in love with Lee Aubrey, causing him further anguish. Later that night, Hutch arrives at Aubrey's home in secret to meet with Campion; the two had previously arranged a covert mission into the nearby town of Bridge. Hutch smuggles Campion into the Council Chamber, a meeting place for a local organisation of dignitaries known as the Masters of Bridge, which is built into caves in a hill overlooking the town. Bluffing his way through an investigation of the site, Campion finds an agenda for a meeting which mentions Minute Fifteen, and Anscombe's sudden retirement from the order. Exploring further, he finds a vast cavern filled with hundreds of trucks. The next day, Aubrey takes Campion for a tour of the Institute, a scientific where they meet Mrs Ericson, whose volunteer workers are housed in the Institute grounds ‚Äì she is clearly infatuated with Aubrey. They also meet a researcher who is developing a new, very powerful explosive. Hutch approaches Campion, asking him questions to prove his identity; Campion realises that Pyne has hinted that Campion might be an imposter, and ironically due to his amnesia he cannot prove his true identity. Panicking, he knocks Hutch out and flees to the nearby town of Coachingford. There, on instinct, he enters a local newsagent's shop where in a backroom he encounters a man who recognises him‚Äîhis manservant, Lugg. Campion confides to Lugg about his condition, and Lugg shows him a basket filled with a large sum of bank notes that Campion left on his previous visit. Soon after, a sinister man with a gun arrives at the newsagents and attempts to bribe Campion to leave town. Upon realising that Campion is not the imposter he suspects him to be, the man panics and flees. Amanda summons Campion to a nearby hotel where he meets the sister of Mr Anscombe. Miss Anscombe gives Campion her brother's diary, and tells him she believes he was smuggling contraband in the caves under the hill. The hotel is surrounded by both police and criminals, so Campion escapes over the roofs and catches a train to London where he meets Sir Henry Bull, a high- ranking member of HM Treasury and one of the Masters of Bridge. He tells Campion that Minute Fifteen is a war loan, details of which are going to be mailed to every taxpayer in the country. Realising Pyne's involvement with the affair, Campion rushes back to Coachingford but is arrested at the train station. Panicking and desperate, Campion attempts to escape the police station but is violently subdued by the skeptical officers and knocked unconscious. Upon awakening, Campion's memories of the events preceding his arrival at the hospital are restored. He remembers that he and Oates were investigating a counterfeiting operation undercover, but had been ambushed by their enemies and assaulted, causing Campion's amnesia. The prisoner that was being discussed when Campion awoke was in fact the unconscious and disguised Oates. When Amanda arrives to post bail, Campion finally realises what the scheme he must foil is; an attempt to flood the United Kingdom with large sums of counterfeit money, which would devalue the pound sterling, cause inflation to skyrocket and destabilise the economy and the government. The money is to be posted at the same time as news about the Minute Fifteen war loan, disguised as a social security payment to the poor. Campion manages to get himself released barely in time to make it back to the caves under the Council Chamber, where he discovers that the money is about to be transported. Using the experimental explosive he was shown at the Institute, Campion manages to destroy the counterfeit money, killing Pyne and several of his men in the process. Afterwards, Campion and Hutch realise Pyne could not have carried out the plan by himself. The mastermind is revealed to be Lee Aubrey. Aubrey confidently admits what he has done‚Äîhaving decided that the government was too inefficiently run to survive, he intended to use the scheme to bring down the government and install himself as a technocratic dictator in its place. Afterwards, Amanda and Campion talk, and Amanda admits that Aubrey had lost interest in her once he had convinced her that she was in love with him. Realising he has taken Amanda for granted, Campion proposes that they marry the next day, and she agrees.

The altitude of the reserve is 650-1646 m. above the sea level. Ecology Flora The reserve is meant to protect sub-Alpine plants of southern slopes of the Major Caucasus, and the natural complexes of Alpine and naval zones. Leafy forests extend to the foot of the mountains, mainly consisting of Oriental beeches (Fagus orientalis). The area is famous for plants, such as the rhododendron, cherry-laurel, blackberry, maple, and fern. At higher altitudes, glaciers and alpine meadows can be found. Among the local species, shikra (Accipiter badius) can be found along the rivers, and Caucasian snowcock (Tetraogallus caucasicus) is present on the rock falls. Fauna The reserve's fauna includes the Syrian brown bear, Indian wolf, red fox, forest cat, Caucasian lynx, squirrel, weasel. It also has a diverse range of birds, including the golden eagle (Aquilla chrysaetos), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), but especially bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) and monk vulture (Aegypius monachus).

The nation has seven reserves which Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Development Canada refer to as IR#1-9. (Reserves 5 and 6 split from Nadleh Whut'en and make up Stellat'en First Nation). Until 1990, it was referred to as the Fraser Lake Indian Band. Nadleh Whut'en has 412 registered members, of which half live on reserve.  Geography  Most of the nation's members reside in Nadleh, the main community, while others (approximately 20) live in Lejac. Nadleh is located along the banks of the Nautley (Nadleh) river, between Fraser Lake and the Nechako River. Lejac is located on the south side of Fraser Lake, on the site of the former Lejac Residential School. Facilities at the Nadleh reserve include the Band Office, Treaty/Lands Management Office, Forestry Office, Catholic Church, convenience store, fire hall, maintenance shop, adult learning centre, health centre, outdoor hockey rink, and community smokehouse. The Nadleh Koh School is home to an Aboriginal Head Start Programme. Facilities in Lejac (IR#4) include Lejac Auto Body and Rocky Mountain Log Homes. The Lejac Residential School (now closed) opened in 1922, and housed children in the region from Vancouver to Dease Lake. Facilities on IR#8 include Ormond Lake Cultural Camp.  Culture and government  The Nadleh Whut'en speak a dialect of the Carrier language, which is part of the Athapaskan language family. Carrier people refer themselves as Dakelh, which means \\"people who travel by water\\". The nation has one elected government chief and four elected government council members. The Nadleh Whut'en practice the traditional system of balhats (potlatch) and have five clans, whose crests are: Bear, Frog, Caribou, Beaver and Owl. Their traditional staple foods include salmon, moose, deer, small game, and berries, all of which are still collected by most band members each year for the winter.  Points of interest  Pictographs can be found painted on granite rocks on the north side of Fraser Lake on IR#2. The drawings depict animals, fish and birds. Beaumont Provincial Park is located on Nadleh Whut'en's traditional territory, next to the Nadleh village. It was the original site of Fort Fraser, a North West Company trading post. The first fort was built in 1806, but burned down and was later moved onto today's Nadleh reserve. In September 2006, archaeologists uncovered an axe head near the Nadleh River and estimated it to be over 1,000 years old. There are also the remains of a fishing weir in the Nadleh river, estimated to be over 100 years old. Each year in Lejac, Catholic churches celebrate Rose Prince, known to the Dakelh as Rose of the Carrier. In her honour, an annual pilgrimage gathers people from across Canada for three days to pray and celebrate their faith. The Cheslatta Trail to Cheslatta Lake, and the Nyan Wheti route to Fort St. James connect at Nadleh/Nautley village (Nadleh, ·òá·ò´·ëã).

The war ended before the type's first flight and only a prototype was built. History On 26 November 1942 the Finnish Air Force ordered two Py√∂rremyrsky prototypes to be built. The aircraft were to be ready by May 1944. One prototype was later cancelled and only one aircraft was ever built. The aircraft designation VMT Py√∂rremyrsky is also sometimes used, as the factory had been formed into the State Metal Factories (Valtion Metallitehtaat) during the construction of the aircraft. The Finnish Air Force airplane code letters PM gave the plane nickname Puu-Mersu (Wooden Messerschmitt), but the plane was an independent design. The use of wood in the construction of the aircraft was maximized due to the scarcity of metals. The goal was to create a fighter with similar flight qualities to the German Messerschmitt Bf 109G. The engine and the propeller were taken from the Bf 109G. The landing gear was significantly widened and installed on the wing instead of fuselage in order to address one of the German fighter's most noteworthy shortcomings. This significantly eased ground control, as well as take off and landing. The Py√∂rremyrsky prototype PM-1 made its first flight on 21 November 1945 at H√§rm√§l√§, piloted by Esko Halme.Swanborough 1971, p. 275. After 25 minutes of flying, a piece from the cowling fell off and Halme had to land when fumes from the engine started to enter the cockpit. The pilot was saved by his oxygen mask. The aircraft was to fly only three test flights in Tampere, the third time being a transfer flight to Kuorevesi on 16 January 1946. There it flew an additional 31 test flights, the total flight time being 27 hours by 1947. The aircraft was flown by eight pilots: Esko Halme, Lauri H√§m√§l√§inen, Erkki It√§vuori, Osmo Kauppinen, Lasse Heikinaro, Martti Laitinen, Heikki Keso and Lauri Lautam√§ki. The last flight lasted only 20 minutes and was made by captain Osmo Kauppinen on 22 July 1947. The Py√∂rremyrsky design was considered quite successful. It could outclimb the Bf 109G-6 and it was very manoeuvrable. It was considered almost ready for mass production. Its only major problem with the design was found to be the low-quality glue used in the joints. The aircraft was still in the prototype stage when the war ended and this also meant that the funds allocated for the project decreased. The Py√∂rremyrsky prototype was grounded after only some 30 hours of flying and the programme terminated as no funds were available for the purchase of new aircraft for the Finnish Air Force and sufficient Bf 109Gs remained in service to equip the fighter force that was permitted under the Armistice terms. The PM-1 was removed from FAF lists on 1 April 1953. The wing construction was later used in another Finnish aircraft, the all-metal Valmet Vihuri trainer. Aircraft on display The PM-1 prototype can today be seen at the Aviation Museum of Central Finland in Tikkakoski.

The reserve area was expanded to 225 km¬≤ in January 2003. The Turian-Chay State Reserve was established for the protection and restoration of arid-arch light forest and other natural resources; and for the localization of centers of erosion at the foothills. The reserve is situated on the spurs of the Buz-Dag Ridge, in the southern foothills of the Major Caucasus, on the right bank of the River Turian-Chay in the Agdash area of the Republic. Its territory lies at a height of 400‚Äì650 m above sea level and extends for 35 km from east to west and for 5 km from north to south. The reserve is situated in an area of semi-desert and arid light forests, which mainly consist of pistachio, juniper, oak, having an important soil protecting, water protecting and climatic significance. In the relief of the reserve lowland mountains dominate with the peaks: Pirsei-Dag (609 m), Nulbon-Dag (437 m), Archan-Dag (476 m), Olmes-Dag (544 m) and others. As a rule they have steep, in some places denudated eroded slopes, and are separated by deep narrow valleys. The northern slopes are more gentle and covered with forests; the southern slopes are steep and strongly eroded. The general process of wind erosion has developed on the territory of the reserve. On the territory of the reserve 60 species of trees and bushes grow. The main types of sparsely growing trees are: Pistacia, fudian juniper (Juniper polucarpus), prickly juniper (Juniperus oxicedrus), Quercus iberica, ash-tree, Celtis caucasicus and pomegranate. Moreover, Populus, willow, alder, Elaeagnus and other trees also grow in this area. Two dendraflora species of the reserve ‚Äì Juniperus and pomegranate are included in the Red Book. There are 24 species of mammals and 112 species of birds, 20 species of reptiles and 3 species of amphibians in the reserve. Among the birds there are partridge (Alectoris kakelik), pigeons, Cercheneis tinnunculus, griffon (Gyps fulvus), black vulture (Aegypius monachus) and others. Among mammals there are wild boar, brown bear, badger, stone marten, lynx, jackal, European wild cat, hare and others. Among reptiles there are amongst others Macrovipera lebetina. Along the former river- beds and channels the Caspian turtle can be found, and on the slopes of the mountain the spur-thighed tortoise can be observed, which, as well as the Coluber caucasicus (?), is included in the Red Book. The main protected objects are the model natural complexes of the Boz-Dag Ridge with the developed pistachio-arch light forests, area of semi-desert, arid and tugay vegetation. The state of arid light forest on the Boz-Dag are of great concern primary primarily because in spite of the productivity of the majority of tree species, including juniper, the regeneration of these forests in general is very slow. The establishment of the Turian-Chay reserve brought -an improvement in the situation with the regeneration of these forests. During the 40 years of the reserve's existence the pistachio-juniper light forest has extended its area and the general quality of trees has increased. The replacement of juniper by pistachio has almost stopped. Shrubbery and herbage lave also developed well, considerably reducing the process of soil erosion.
