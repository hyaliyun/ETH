It's a member of the Fair Youth sequence. Interpretation This sonnet continues the theme of Sonnet 38 (38 sonnets ago), in which the sweet argument of the young man is predicted to inspire endless invention. Sonnets 76 and 38 share four key words: invention, sweet, write and argument.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare’s Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. . p. 262 This sonnet begins by asking why the poet's verse is lacking in new variations, why the poet doesn't look around at the verse of others and pick up some of the latest fashions, and why his verse is always dressed in a familiar style. The poem's reference to the writings of others anticipates the \\"Rival Poet\\" sequence (sonnets 78 to 86), which more explicitly considers other poets. The poem answers its own questions by pointing out that his best work is inspired by fidelity to the subject of the poems.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare’s Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. . p. 262 The sonnet seems to be sincerely self-denigrating about the poet's lack of variety, and lack of incorporating the latest fashions, but at the same time there is a sense that the self-effacing pose doesn't ring true. There is instead a self-asserting quality being implied: that when the poet compares himself with others in the first quatrain they appear to be mere followers of fashion, and (in the second quatrain) that his way of writing is a way for a writer to achieve a style that is distinct. There is also the assertion implied in the sestet that the poet requires fidelity to his subject in order to arrive at a proper style, as opposed to the fickle valuing of constantly changing fashions.Hammond. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 97. The poet's values, including fidelity to his subject, become dominant by the end of the sonnet, which is suggested metaphorically by the evolution of the meaning of the word love. It is first used (line 9) to refer to the young man (\\"sweet love\\"), then in the next line the meaning is changed, and love is something that parallels the young man (\\"you and love\\"). Then in the last line the change is complete so that love identifies the poet (\\"So is my love still telling what is told\\"). The image of the rising and setting sun (line 13) invites the initial assumption that it will refer to the young man as the sun, but that assumption is derailed when the last line indicates that the sun is a metaphor for the poet's love as expressed in verse.Hammond. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 97-98. Structure Sonnet 76 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of metre based on five feet in each line, and each foot composed of a pair of syllables accented weak/strong. The 7th line is an example of a regular iambic pentameter: × / × / × / × / × / That every word doth almost tell my name, (76.7) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. The 1st line begins with a common variation, an initial reversal (a figure repeated several times in the sonnet), and ends with a less-frequent one, the rightward movement of the 4th ictus (resulting in a 4-position figure, \`× × / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic). The 2nd line repeats the minor ionic at the same point in the line: / × × / × / × × / / Why is my verse so barren of new pride, × / × / ×/ × × / / So far from variation or quick change? (76.1-2) Notes In the reference of line 4 to \\"new-found methods\\" found in the works of others, Shakespeare may be referring to Michael Drayton's sonnets that were republished with many variations beginning in 1599, and were advertised to have a \\"readiness to experiment\\".Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare’s Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. . p. 262 The word weed in line 6 is an expression common in Shakespeare's works used to mean garments or dress. It occurs in that sense in many plays, including in The Two Gentleman of Verona, when the character Julia wants to dress herself as a young man, she says \\"fit me with such weeds/As may beseem some well reputed page.\\"Shakespeare, William, The Two Gentleman of Verona, Act 2, scene 7, line 42. Arden Shakespeare. \\"Noted weed\\" means familiar clothing. The Norton Shakespeare annotates \\"and keep invention in a noted weed\\" thus: And keep literary creativity in such familiar clothing. The Oxford English Dictionary's definition of weed is \\"an article of apparel; a garment\\", and is consistent with the theme of mending, re-using, etc. (\\"all my best is dressing old words new\\").Norton Shakespeare, ed. Stephen Greenblatt. NY: Norton, 1997. The \\"noted weed\\" of line 6 and the images of lines 7 and 8 seems to be echoed in a poem by Ben Jonson, published in the first pages of the First Folio that notes the distinctiveness and authenticity of Shakespeare's lines: The suggestion that Shakespeare used the word weed in its contemporary connection with hemp is suggested by nobody. In 2001 some scientists from South Africa tested clay pipes that had been dug up over the years from various locations around Stratford-upon-Avon, tested them for chemicals and found no evidence that Shakespeare smoked clay pipes or used marijuana. This was not a notable study and is largely ignored.CNN OnlineHarvard Magazine Sep-Oct 2001.

Biography Metodyj Trochanovskij was born in Binczarowa, Poland, when it was part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, on May 5, 1885. After receiving his pedagogical education at the Teacher's Seminary in Krosno, he taught at the elementary school in the Lemko village of Uhryn. In 1913, he married Konstancija Durkot, daughter of a prominent Lemko priest and civil activist, Father Ioann Chrysostom Durkot, and became involved in Lemko-Rusyn educational and social concerns. At the onset of World War I, he was accused of treason against Austria-Hungary, arrested, prosecuted, and sentenced to death in 1916 during the Second Vienna Trial. The execution was stayed, and he was released from Talerhof in 1917, when it was closed. He was noted for urging his fellow Lemkos to form cooperatives and credit unions, and warned of the dangers of the Ukrainization of the Lemko region. He authored an early primer and grammar of the Lemko form of the Rusyn language. He was one of the organizers of the event that led to the construction of the Talerhof Cross. He was jailed for his intellectual and political activities by the Nazi invaders in 1941, and in turn by the invading Soviets and the NKVD in 1944. He was freed from prison, but moved with his family to Wroclaw in 1947. He died soon afterwards.

After leaving Vixen, she co- formed the supergroup, Contraband, releasing only one album. When Vixen reunited in 1997, she had no interest in coming back, as she was playing in her husband's band, Bubble. In 1999, Ross and her husband Bam co-wrote the songs on Jesse Camp's debut album, Jesse & The 8th Street Kidz. Bubble won Song of the Year in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest in 2000 with their song, Sparkle Star. It was also featured in the film starring Daryl Hannah, Dancing at the Blue Iguana. In 2003, Ross toured with her husband's band, The Dogs D'Amour, and opened up for Alice Cooper on a European tour. In 2006, Ross became the host and co-producer of the now-defunct video podcast Rock n Roll TV, an online show which featured up-and-coming punk/garage/rock bands and rock news, and in 2010, she played for one night only in a cover band L.A.

Prior to the passage of the act, the U.S.'s merchant fleet was primarily made up of ships which had been built as part of the Emergency Fleet Program at the end of World War I. Because of technological advances in hull construction and propulsion machinery, these ships were rapidly becoming obsolete and non- competitive in the commercial market and of limited value to the Navy as auxiliary support vessels. Additionally, U.S. shipyards had been suffering atrophy from more than 15 years of little to no new construction with either Navy nor commercial orders and it was felt that rebuilding the commercial shipbuilding capacity in the U.S. was in the nation's strategic interest. History Pre-WWII years In order to remedy this situation and to facilitate the mission given to it by the act, the Maritime Commission devised a program to build 500 new design merchant freighters powered with either steam turbines or diesels. The 500 total ships were to be built over a 10-year period and contracts for their construction went to both established and new shipyards on the East, West and Gulf Coasts. The new ships would be broken into two groups. First were those constructed to contracts placed by the individual shipping companies to their own designs but where the construction differential between a US and foreign yards to be subsidized by the Maritime Commission. The second group were ships built to standard designs of the Commission and where the contract for the construction of the ships would be to Federal Government's account. It was this shipbuilding effort which became known as the Long Range Program. It was intended that this latter group of ships would be chartered to commercial operators who would use the ships in peacetime but that the ships would be available for use by the Navy in wartime. These included the type C1 ships, type C2 ships and type C3 ships. U.S. Maritime Commission C3 standard type cargo vessel During the early years of WWII Since war appeared to be drawing closer by the year, the Long Range Program grew in importance and in 1940 was accelerated to deliver more of the 500 planned ships sooner than originally scheduled. The fall of France in May 1940 was a watershed for the Commission and the Long Range Program for when Germany was able to move its U-Boat bases to the Brittany coast of France, the Battle of the Atlantic turned drastically against Great Britain's attempts to keep her supply lines open. With losses of merchant vessels far exceeding the ability to replace then in UK shipyards, the British Merchant Shipping Mission arrived in North America with the intention of ordering replacement cargo vessels in the U.S. and Canada. Permission to do so in the U.S. was sought and granted by the Maritime Commission for the U.K. to fund the construction of two new shipyards in South Portland, Maine and Richmond, California and for each to build 30 vessels to UK design. This was the genesis of the Emergency Shipbuilding program which would soon eclipse the Long Range Program in both scope and scale. Although it was clear that the Emergency Program would be much larger than the Long Range Program, the Commissioners led by Admiral Emory S. Land fought to ensure that the smaller program not be allowed to whither to nothing. All five members of the Maritime Commission realized that the war would come to an end someday and the Liberty ships would not be capable of fulfilling what would be required of the postwar U.S. Merchant fleet. Although by mid-1941 ships were no longer being ordered by commercial operators, ships of the standard designs continued to be ordered by the Commission. As shipbuilding accelerated in 1941 with more ships being ordered for both the Long Range and Emergency Programs, by March 1942 the oversight of shipbuilding was decentralized by the Maritime Commission into four regional offices, one on each of the three seacoasts and the last for the Great Lakes region. With this move the Long Range Program was combined with the Emergency Program for the duration as both programs were supervised as one by the individual Regional offices. As part of entire Maritime Commission wartime effort With the combining of the Long Range Program with the Emergency Program, the specific type of ships which had been the foundation of the Long Range program continued to be built at the same yards which had been contracted for their construction and in only a few cases did yards built for the Emergency Program undertake building the standard types of the Long Range Program nor did the yards which had previously built vessels for the Long Range program get switched to Emergency vessel building. One instance where this was not the followed was when North Carolina Shipbuilding when it was switched from building Liberty ships to C2 type ships which it began to do in the summer of 1943. This decision came from an increase in propulsion turbines along with a high demand for the C2's from the Navy for use as auxiliary ships. Post-WWII One fundamental difference between the yards building for the Long Range Program as opposed to its larger brother, was that the yards of the Emergency Program were principally built with Federal funds only and that title to the yards resided with the Maritime Commission. Long Range Program yards had been from the beginning privately owned and although most received capital from the government during the course of the war to expand their shipbuilding capacity, the title to those yards remained in the hands of the corporations which owned them. Many of the yards which built for the Long Range Program continued to operate in the post war years. Not one of the Emergency yards continued to build or even to repair ships after the end of the war and most had been fully dismantled by the mid-1950s. Since so many vessels had been built during the war years, in the postwar there was a great surplus of vessels available to both U.S. as well as foreign owners. There was subsequently, a drastic cut back in new merchant vessel construction after 1945 although a few ships were built under direct commercial contract. There was however plenty of work for shipyards to reconvert ships which had been originally built as cargo vessels but had served throughout the war as Naval auxiliary ships. Not until the 1950s was there a new Long Range style shipbuilding program undertaken by the Maritime Commission's successor agency, the U.S. Maritime Administration. That was for the construction of a number of C4 type cargo vessels which also were known as the \\"Mariner class\\". Those ships like their predecessors in the prewar Long Range Program were built to government contract and then chartered to commercial shipping firms or transferred to the Navy for use as auxiliaries.

It was located about upriver of the present-day Rainbow Bridge. It collapsed in 1938. History Built in 1897–98 by the Pencoyd Bridge Company, the Upper Steel Arch Bridge was located closer to the American Falls than the bridge that it replaced. When completed, the bridge became the largest steel arch bridge in the world. Its features included a double track for trolley cars and room for carriages and pedestrians. The bridge had to be constantly protected from ice bridges that formed over the river every winter. In January 1899 a huge ice bridge threatened the bridge when ice piled around its abutments due to their close proximity to the river's surface. The bridge was subsequently fortified with a tall stone wall around the abutments. The protection around the abutments held for about another forty years: until January 27, 1938, when the bridge collapsed. A sudden wind storm on Lake Erie sent a massive amount of ice over the falls, resulting in nearly of ice pushing against the bridge. Final collapse occurred at 4:20 pm, before thousands of onlookers who had come to watch the bridge go. The structure collapsed in one piece into the river. Demolition of what was left of the bridge took place from February to April 1938 when all of the pieces were either removed or had sunk. Construction of a replacement bridge was undertaken shortly thereafter, this time with the abutments much higher off the river. It was named the Rainbow Bridge and opened in November 1941.

A. Fair. Bertha Cool In the first book about her, The Bigger They Come (1939; British: Lam to the Slaughter), Bertha Cool opened her detective agency after the death of Henry, her husband, in 1936. She is described in various terms as overweight, and uncaring about her weight—in the first novel, Donald Lam estimates her weight at 220 pounds. At the beginning of Spill the Jackpot (1941), she had flu and pneumonia, and lost a great deal of weight, down to 160 pounds, and in many later novels, her weight is given as 165 pounds. She has white hair and \\"greedy piggish eyes\\". All the novels agree that she is extremely avaricious and miserly. However, she has persistence, loyalty, and nerve. Her favorite expletive is some variant of \\"Fry me for an oyster!\\" or \\"Can me for a sardine!\\". In the opening chapter of the first novel, she hires a small, nervy, and extremely ingenious former lawyer named Donald Lam. Donald later becomes a full partner in her business, forming the agency, Cool and Lam, which features in more than two dozen books by Gardner. Donald Lam In her biography of Gardner, Dorothy B. Hughes wrote, \\"Erle said over and again that if Donald Lam, 'that cocky little bastard,' had a model, it was Corney\\"—Thomas Cornwell Jackson, his literary agent. Jackson later married actress Gail Patrick, and they formed a partnership with Gardner that created the CBS-TV series Perry Mason. Donald Lam begins his adventures as the employee of Bertha Cool, a stout widow in her 60s who started a detective agency in 1936. As a detective, Lam is in stark contrast to the fictional hard-boiled types of his era. Donald is about 5'6\\", weighs 130 pounds soaking wet, and gets beaten up quite frequently. While he does get into several fistfights, he loses all but one — a single fistfight against an insurance investigator in Double or Quits, only after taking boxing lessons from a former pug named Louie Hazen in Spill the Jackpot, and studying jujitsu with a master named Hashita in Gold Comes in Bricks. Donald does not carry a gun because, as he says: A) \\"A gun, a good type of gun such as I would want to carry, costs money\\", and B) \\"People are always taking it away from me and beating me up\\" (meaning the gun). His primary weapon is his brain, not his brawn. In the first book (The Bigger They Come), Donald tells Bertha that when people mistreat him, he uses his ingenuity to figure out a way to get even. He shows that frequently in his cases. The early history of Donald Lam is murky, though several clues are given in the first novel, The Bigger They Come. He is known to have been a lawyer who had his license to practice law suspended for a year for casually mentioning to a client (who turned out to be a gangster) that he, Donald, had worked out a way to commit a murder in such a way nobody could do anything about it. This was a defect in the law itself, not a sealed room or a traceless poison or a way of vaporizing a body, etc. This theory was put to the test in the same book when Donald confessed to a murder he did not commit to flush out the real killer, using the gimmick to stay free till then. This was the same gimmick that Gardner's pulp character Ed Jenkins used, to stay free in California, while being a wanted man in seven other states. Fortunately for Donald, his theory stood up in court. After his law license was suspended, Donald was desperate and started answering ads for jobs \\"that were just a little bit fishy on their face.\\" This led him to Bertha, who hired him, and made money on him ever since. Bertha also uncovered Donald's past, including his real name, something that was never revealed. Donald apparently considered that a false start to his life. However, his legal training proved invaluable in later books, when he advised lawyers, or his clients, in trials as in Beware the Curves and All Grass Isn't Green. Donald eventually became such a moneymaker for Bertha that she was forced to relent when he put the pressure on her for a full partnership in Double or Quits. When Donald originally asked to be made a partner, Bertha turned him down cold. So, Donald quit and moved to San Francisco. Bertha would have kept Donald on at a hired man's wages forever, but when he quit, she realized that he was her cash cow. Bertha tracked him down and begged him to return in exchange for a partnership. Donald acted uninterested, but finally allowed himself to be persuaded after making a couple of insulting additional conditions for his return. Bertha bit her tongue and accepted, finally confirming his dominance over his formidable boss. This same book, Double or Quits, is about a case involving double indemnity \\"in the event of death by accidental means\\". Donald knew the legal difference between \\"death by accidental means\\" and \\"accidental death\\", which netted Cool and Lam over $40,000. Solving the case nearly cost Donald his own life, but he did find the proof to get the money, as the murder was held to be a death by accidental means, and the insurance company paid up. At the conclusion of Owls Don't Blink, set in early 1942, Donald left the agency to enlist in the Navy and fight the Japanese after Pearl Harbor. Two books were written about Bertha alone, during the time Donald was serving his country: Bats Fly at Dusk and Cats Prowl at Night. In Bats Fly at Dusk, Bertha takes a case brought to her by a blind man. Donald was able to correspond via telegraph, and gave her solid advice, much of which Bertha rejected. However, she finally quit the case at the end, only to find that Donald, on a military pass, flew down and solved it for her. The second, Cats Prowl at Night, put Bertha in a case that kept getting worse for her. She eventually came up with a single clue that led her to the solution, but showed she was not Donald's equal in such situations. After over two years of fighting, Donald was discharged from the Navy on medical grounds after he contracted malaria in the South Pacific, at the start of Give 'em the Axe. He returned to Los Angeles and went back to work, although he continued to suffer from frequent malarial attacks for some time. Like Perry Mason, Donald firmly stood behind his clients, even if they have not given him all the needed information, or even if he did not like them personally. He worked according to his own sense of honor and loyalty, giving fair treatment to those who treated him well, and not caring about those who treated him poorly. His unorthodox methods and secretiveness frequently frustrated Bertha, but in the end, they paid off in earnings for the agency. Donald often became romantically involved with beautiful women connected with his cases - but only after the case was closed - and by the next novel they had dropped out of his life. Donald Lam is dedicated to his ideals of justice. It may not always be the legal or moral definition of justice (in Beware the Curves Lam accepts without comment the wrongful conviction of a man for a certain crime, because he knew the man was actually guilty of murder), but to his unique sense of justice, the punishment seems to fit the crime, at least in his own opinion.  Bibliography  The Cool and Lam series consists of the following 29 books (now 30, with the discovery of an unpublished work in 2016).Erle Stanley Gardner: A Checklist by E.H. Mundell, Kent State University Press. The cryptically phrased book titles are said to have inspired the title of Steve Martin's movie spoof of film noir, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid. # The Bigger They Come (1939) William Morrow and Company, January 1939 Donald Lam is hired by Bertha. His first assignment is to serve a subpoena on a man that nobody can find; piece of cake. This first entry in the series turned on a real loophole in the extradition laws of the State of Arizona which made it possible, under certain conditions, to commit a murder without being punished ( the only catch was, you had to spend the rest of your life in Arizona). After its publication, a public outcry caused the Arizona Legislature to convene in special session to plug the loophole. Gardner had used this device earlier in his 'Ed Jenkins' stories, locating the loophole in California law (this time, fictitiously) so that Jenkins (though a known crook) could operate in California without being extradited for crimes in other states. The Cool and Lam stories were written under the pen name \\"A.A. Fair\\", and Gardner's authorship was not revealed till the 1940s. Fellow crime writer Raymond Chandler in a letter to a friend in late 1939 noted the resemblance of the loophole in this book to the one in the Jenkins stories. Chandler complained that this Fair fellow was stealing Gardner's ideas! # Turn on the Heat (1940) William Morrow and Company, January 1940 Dr. \\"Smith\\" is looking for his wife who left him 20 years before. It was made into a 1958 TV pilot for an unproduced show called Cool and Lam. # Gold Comes in Bricks (1940) William Morrow and Company, September 1940 A blackmailing gambler, a corrupt lawyer, and an expert in salting gold mines, all are grist to Donald's mill. # Spill the Jackpot! (1941) William Morrow and Company, March 1941 Set in Las Vegas. A runaway bride and a slot machine-fixing ring seem to have no connection. Bertha loses the weight, and falls in love! But... # Double or Quits (1941) William Morrow and Company, December 1941 Detectionary: \\"First—the missing jewelry. Second—the client found dead in his garage, and Cool and Lam are trying to get from an insurance company double indemnity for the lovely widow.\\"Roseman, Mill et al. Detectionary. New York: Overlook Press, 1971. Bertha begins fishing. # Owls Don't Blink (1942) William Morrow and Company, June 1942 Donald has two intertwining cases: finding a lost girl and bringing to justice a murderer. Set in the French Quarter of New Orleans. America has entered the war, and Bertha thinks she has helped gain Donald's immunity from the draft. # Bats Fly at Dusk (1942) William Morrow and Company, September 1942 Donald has calmly volunteered for the Navy to fight the Japanese, and Bertha fumes. She works on a case involving a blind man and a pet bat, with help from Donald via telegram. Donald's frenemy—Police Detective Frank Sellers—is introduced. Bertha gets in over her head and quits; Donald flies down on a military pass, solves it, and flies back. Bertha only finds out later. # Cats Prowl at Night (1943) William Morrow and Company, August 1943 Bertha must locate a client's missing wife, who controls all his money. No signs of Lam are seen at all, though he is heard of. She manages somehow, but almost fails. Frank proposes to her. # Give 'em the Ax (1944) William Morrow and Company, September 1944 Donald returns, and takes control of the agency. The case is of a wife cheated with car insurance and blackmail. # Crows Can't Count (1946) William Morrow and Company, April 1946 A case involving both stolen and smuggled emeralds, the latter half of which is set in the nation of Colombia. # Fools Die on Friday (1947) William Morrow and Company, September 1947 Donald Lam tries to put \\"psychological handcuffs\\" on a potential poisoner, but things do not work out the way he planned. Raymond Chandler (now presumably aware of the true identity of A.A. Fair) wrote to Gardner in 1948, \\"Fools Die on Friday is about the best of the series since the first two. Perhaps since the very first.\\" # Bedrooms Have Windows (1949) William Morrow and Company, January 1949 Case involving \\"a pocket edition Venus\\", in which Donald himself is suspected by the police of a serious crime. Sleazy nightspots, dubious photographs, a stay at an auto court goes wrong—could there be blackmail? More spice than usual. Gardner originally wrote this series under a pen name because he wondered if some of the plot points he intended to use with Cool and Lam would be bad for his image. However, laxer standards in the 1940s and on made him decide to admit writing the series. # Top of the Heap (1952) William Morrow and Company, February 1952 Previously, Bertha has complained that Donald had been getting the agency in over its head lately. Donald then promptly shows the agency was used as a cat's paw to prove a phony alibi, in a case involving gangsters, gambling houses, Point shaving, a former stripper, a money laundering scam, and phantom gold mines. Bertha is mad enough to try and dissolve the partnership. Available in the Hard Case Crime series. # Some Women Won't Wait (1953) William Morrow and Company, September 1953 The question is: did Donald's beautiful young client poison her rich and decrepit husband, or didn't she? Set in Hawaii. Bertha tries to dance the hula. # Beware the Curves (1956) William Morrow and Company, November 1956 Suspect in the murder is trying to figure out if it is safe for him to return to his beloved six years later. The victim was her husband who had sent the suspect to die in Amazonia to marry her. # You Can Die Laughing (1957) William Morrow and Company, March 1957 Donald clashes with a client, with whom he has a written contract to locate a certain woman. He thinks the client is lying to him, but takes the case. # Some Slips Don't Show (1957) William Morrow and Company, October 1957 Set in San Francisco and environs. Practically everyone ends up on a plane at one point or another, so almost anyone could have caused that guy to be found dead in his motel room. Donald knows it wasn't him. The worry is: do the police know that? Fancy footwork with fake keys and real claim checks could help. # The Count of Nine (1958) William Morrow and Company, June 1958 A rich dilettante \\"Explorer\\" finds his poisonous blow gun he had brought back from the Amazon used for a murder. Or so it seems … This one is notable for two things: First, Gardner re-uses a favorite trick from his Perry Mason series; juggling duplicate bits of evidence. Instead of guns or bullets, Lam has a more interesting set of twin jade Buddhas with a ruby in the forehead. It will pay the reader to watch closely who has which, and when, and why. Secondly, the key plot point has a resemblance to G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown story, The Arrow of Heaven. This may be unintentional, but arguably, Gardner has come up with a more imaginative use of the concept. # Pass the Gravy (1959) William Morrow and Company, February 1959 Stacked blondes, hitch hikers and trips by several people to Reno to gamble are incidental to the two main points. 1. What are the legal issues surrounding the exact way the assets of a spendthrift trust are to be distributed? 2. And what are the exact legal circumstances surrounding the death of a man with a double indemnity policy on his life? If he is dead. # Kept Women Can't Quit (1960) William Morrow and Company, September 1960 An armored car is robbed while one of the two guards are inside having donuts and coffee and ogling the waitresses; and when Police Detective Sgt. Frank Sellers catches one of the robbers, he is accused of pocketing the loot for himself. Naturally, he puts the pressure on Donald to solve the case for him, gratis, and get him off the hook. Much money floats about - in fact, a little too much. Whose? (At this time, thousand-dollar bills were still in fairly wide circulation, making it possible to use only a little space to hide fairly large sums. # Bachelors Get Lonely (1961) William Morrow and Company, March 1961 Industrial espionage, a Peeping Tom, little is what it seems. More than one woman falls for Lam in the course of this investigation, due to his habit of playing square and treating them like human beings. Sgt. Sellers is a little dense at first, taking Lam for the Peeping Tom. The investigation moves to Arizona at one point. # Shills Can't Cash Chips (1961) William Morrow and Company, November 1961 Bertha lands a nice, respectable insurance adjustment claim, and hands it to Donald. Donald uncovers assorted ulterior motives, pretends to be an ex-con, hot-wires his own car to impress a gorgeous witness and gets leaned on by a gangster. Then one of the parties involved ends up dead. # Try Anything Once (1962) William Morrow and Company, April 1962 A worried heel of a husband is hand-wringingly anxious to keep his late night visit to a motel with a cocktail hostess quiet. Unfortunately for him, the deputy D.A. in a hot murder trial was found dead in the motel pool the same evening. The resulting investigation will expose the husband. Donald smells a rat lurking within this story, but finally accepts the fat fee offered to keep Bertha happy. The attempt to protect the client has unexpected side effects, including several women removing their garments for one reason or other, a horrifically false accusation against the straight-shooting Donald and the exciting courtroom climax he engineers in the above-mentioned trial. # Fish or Cut Bait (1963) William Morrow and Company, April 1963 When Cool and Lam are hired for day-and-night coverage of a harassed woman, a tortuous tale involving a high-class 'escort service' unfolds. Donald is dismissed from the case, but inserts himself back in self-defence after the madam comes to an untimely end. He must convince the police it wasn't him. # Up for Grabs (1964) William Morrow and Company, March 1964 Insurance again, this time a company that wants to set up an ongoing project to expose phony whiplash claims. Big ongoing retainer, big fees for each claim - Bertha's eyes glitter at all the legit dollars up for grabs. Donald is packed off to a dude ranch in Arizona to investigate the plaintiff in the first claim, with stern instructions not to stir this one up. It's not his fault someone's wife ends up dead in the Sierras, or that Sgt. Sellers is so annoyed at his 'amateur' interference that he throws away a key piece of evidence at the scene of the death. # Cut Thin to Win (1965) William Morrow and Company, April 1965 Gardner has Lam himself review the case - from the back of the 1966 Pocket Books edition. Bertha has her doubts about taking a certain case, \\"...but I talked her into it when our client laid twelve one-hundred dollar bills on his desk. 'Fry me for an oyster', Bertha said. 'It's your baby, and you can change the diapers'. Less than a week later, Sgt. Frank Sellers announced he was going to take away my license, Bertha Cool announced that our partnership was dissolved and my secretary was crying on my shoulder. 'Donald, please - please be careful'. 'It's too late to be careful now' I told her. 'I'm dealing either with a crooked lawyer, a jealous boyfriend, a scheming daughter, one hell of a wealthy father or a combination of any number of them. When you go up against a combination of that sort, you can't be careful'\\". # Widows Wear Weeds (1966) William Morrow and Company, May 1966 Blackmail was a dirty business, and Donald Lam liked to stay clear of it. But for his partner, Bertha Cool, no business was too dirty to handle at the right price. And the price for this job was certainly right. What was wrong, though, was a payoff for pictures that weren't worth a dime, a free dinner that cost the blackmailer his life, and more than a couple of double-crosses that framed Donald Lam quite neatly for a charge of murder. # Traps Need Fresh Bait (1967) William Morrow and Company, March 1967 Someone is advertising for a witness to an auto accident in such a way as to seem to be suborning perjury. Also, an earlier claim was settled with evidence obtained in this way. The client wants Cool and Lam to find out what is back of it all. Gardner kept up with the law, and knew of the implications of the recent Miranda Rights decision of the Supreme Court for gathering evidence. He believed he had found a loophole allowing evidence improperly gathered under the new rules to be admissible, if obtained investigating another incident, such as a private detective searching a flat without permission. When Donald introduces the loophole, it brightens up Sgt. Sellers’ day no end. # All Grass isn't Green (1970) William Morrow and Company, March 1970 Dope smuggling and a witness who is both more, and less, than he seems. It all starts when a client wants to find a missing writer - just to talk to him. A little digging (with descriptions of tracing techniques) shows his girlfriend has vanished too, and the trail goes south, to the Mexican border. Crossing the trail, going north, is a shipment of cannabis. Unsurprisingly for this business, someone ends up dead and the whole thing lands in court. Sorting out who did what and why taxes even Donald Lam's talents to the limit. Lam shows his considerable ability in courtroom maneuvering, which reminds the reader that he was a lawyer once. # The Knife Slipped (1939) Hard Case Crime, December 2016 Originally written to be the second book in the Cool and Lam series but rejected by Gardner's publisher, The Knife Slipped was found among Gardner's papers and published for the first time in 2016. Assigned to prove a philandering husband's infidelity, Donald Lam uncovers a scheme to enable a certain type of municipal corruption. As well as a dead body. Adaptations  Radio  Turn On the Heat was adapted by Welbourne Kelley for the June 23, 1946, broadcast of The United States Steel Hour on ABC radio. Frank Sinatra was the first actor to portray Donald Lam.  Television  Cool and Lam first appeared on television in the January 6, 1955, episode of Climax! based on the debut novel, The Bigger They Come (1939). It starred Art Carney as Donald Lam and Jane Darwell as Bertha Cool and is considered \\"lost.\\" A 30-minute pilot program called Cool and Lam was made in 1958 but never became a series. Billy Pearson was cast as Donald Lam and Benay Venuta as Bertha Cool. The pilot was loosely based on Turn On The Heat. One feature of interest is that, a few minutes after the start of the program, Erle Stanley Gardner is shown on the set of Perry Mason's office. He speaks directly to the viewer, introducing the characters, and talking about his pleasure in the casting and his hopes that the pilot will become a series. It is uncertain whether this pilot was ever broadcast and, if so, whether this segment featuring Gardner would have been included, since it pushed the running time of the program to the 30-minute mark and did not allow for commercials.

Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 264 . Paraphrase When you look in your mirror, you will see how you are aging. Your timepiece will show you how your minutes are being wasted. This book will allow you to record the impressions of your mind, and these impressions will themselves teach you. The lines in your face that your mirror shows you will remind you of the open mouths of fresh graves. The hands of the dial will truly teach you how time thievishly keeps leading towards eternity. What your memory cannot keep, you should write down, and when you return to them you will find that they are like well-nursed children born of your brain, and you will meet them again afresh—like new friends. The oftener you do these duties – observing, contemplating, writing − the more \\"your book\\" will profit. Structure Sonnet 77 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet contains three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter lines, a type of poetic metre in which each line as five feet, each foot has two syllables, and each syllable is accented weak/strong. Most of the lines are regular iambic pentameter including the first: × / × / × / × / × / Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. Source and analysis The poem begins with the act of looking in a mirror, and the act of noticing the passage of time – which operate exactly as a memento mori: the medieval tradition of contemplating one's own mortality. The poem turns from that and ends with a model of creative productivity through observation, contemplation and writing — in a collaboration of the poet's offices and the mind's imprint on the young man.Kalas, Rayna. Frame, Glass, Verse: The Technology of Poetic Invention in the English Renaissance. Cornell University Press, 2007. p. 128 George Steevens and Edmond Malone consider the poem may be referring to the gift of a blank-book or book of tablets, perhaps given to the young man. Edward Dowden hypothesized that the poem relates to the Rival Poet: knowing that he has lost favor, the speaker makes a present of this blank book to the youth, who will now have to fill it himself, since the speaker has fallen silent. It has been suggested that the mirror and dial referred to may be devices represented on the cover of the book – assuming the book is an actual object. Alternately, as Rolfe hypothesized, they might have been gifts enclosed with the book. Henry Charles Beeching discounts any clear biographical clue in the poem, arguing that it is so unrelated to those next it in the sequence that it must be read apart. Sonnet 77, together with the sonnet that precedes it, and the sonnet that follows it form a group, in which the poet's thoughts turn to the act of writing. In sonnet 76 the poet fears his writing may be old-fashioned; in sonnet 77 he demonstrates both the problem and his fears by having sonnet 77 take the form of the much maligned rhetorical device correlatio, which was perhaps over-used by Philip Sidney in the 1590s, then later in that decade mocked by Sir John Davies in his Gullinge Sonnets. Finally in sonnet 78 the poet has found a solution to the problem and the right way forward.Kalas, Rayna. Frame, Glass, Verse: The Technology of Poetic Invention in the English Renaissance. Cornell University Press, 2007. p. 128 The quarto's first line uses a common variant spelling for wear: were. This spelling may suggest: how thy beauties “used to be”. But Booth considers that potential second meaning to be not useful or meaningful here.Booth, Stephen. Shakespeare’s Sonnets. Yale University Press. 2000. p. 266 The three objects – the glass, the dial, and the book – may be purely metaphorical, not references to actual objects, but metaphors for observation, time and the act of writing. Sonnet 77 is the midpoint in the sequence of 154 sonnets. The fact that it is about a mirror may be relevant to its placing. Edmund Spenser mentions mirrors at the midpoint of his sequence, Amoretti, Sonnet 45 of 89: \\"Leaue lady in your glasse of christall clene, / Your goodly selfe for euermore to vew\\".Larsen, Kenneth J. \\"Structure\\" in Essays on Shakespeare's Sonnets. The original quarto's \\"blacks\\" in line 10 is usually emended to \\"blanks\\", following Alexander Dyce. Some critics have defended \\"blacks\\" as referring to printer's type, or to slate notebooks. If it refers to printers type it allows the reference to the quarto itself as a gift to the young man.

License proliferation affects the whole FOSS ecosystem negatively by the burden of increasingly complex license selection, license interaction, and license compatibility considerations.OSI and License Proliferation on fossbazar.com by Martin Michlmayr \\"Too many different licenses makes it difficult for licensors to choose: it's difficult to choose a good license for a project because there are so many. Some licenses do not play well together: some open source licenses do not inter-operate well with other open source licenses, making it hard to incorporate code from other projects. Too many licenses makes it difficult to understand what you are agreeing to in a multi-license distribution: since a FOSS application typically contains code with different licenses and people use many applications which each contain one or several licenses, it's difficult to see what your obligations are.\\" (on August 21st, 2008)  Impact  Often when a software developer would like to merge portions of different software programs they are unable to do so because the licenses are incompatible. When software under two different licenses can be merged into a larger software work, the licenses are said to be compatible. As the number of licenses increases, the probability that a Free and open-source software (FOSS) developer will want to merge software that are available under incompatible licenses increases. There is also a greater cost to companies that wish to evaluate every FOSS license for software packages that they use. Strictly speaking, no one is in favor of license proliferation. Rather, the issue stems from the tendency for organizations to write new licenses in order to address real or perceived needs for their software releases.  License compatibility  License proliferation is especially a problem when licenses have only limited or complicated license compatibility relationships with other licenses. Therefore, some consider compatibility with the widely used GNU General Public License (GPL) an important characteristic, for instance David A. WheelerThe Free-Libre / Open Source Software (FLOSS) License Slide by David A. Wheeler on September 27, 2007 as also the Free Software Foundation (FSF), who maintains a list of the licenses that are compatible with the GPL.license list of gnu.org On the other hand, some recommend Permissive licenses, instead of copyleft licenses, due to the better compatibility with more licenses. The Apache Foundation for instance criticizes the fact that while the Apache License is compatible with the copyleft GPLv3, the GPLv3 is not compatible with the permissive Apache license -- Apache software can be included in GPLv3 software but not vice versa. As another relevant example, the GPLv2 is by itself not compatible with the GPLv3. The 2007 released GPLv3 was criticized by several authors for adding another incompatible license in the FOSS ecosystem.Are you sure you want to use the GPL? by Armin Ronacher (2009)  Vanity licenses  A vanity licenses is a license that is written by a company or person for no other reason than to write their own license (\\"NIH syndrome\\").Sharing medical software: FOSS licensing in medicine on freesoftwaremagazine.com by Fred Trotter (2007-06-14) If a new license is created that has no obvious improvement or difference over another more common FOSS license it can often be criticized as a vanity license. As of 2008, many people create a custom new license for their newly released program, without knowing the requirements for a FOSS license and without realizing that using a nonstandard license can make that program almost useless to others.  Solution approaches   GitHub's stance  In July 2013, GitHub started a license selection wizard called choosealicense.GitHub finally takes open source licenses seriously on Infoworld by Simon Phipps on July 2013 GitHub's choosealicense frontpage offers as a quick selection only three licenses: the MIT License, the Apache License and the GNU General Public License.

OSI's stance  Open Source Initiative (OSI) maintains a list of approved licenses.OSI Approved Licenses on opensource.org Early in its history, the OSI contributed to license proliferation by approving vanity and non-reusable licenses. In 2004 an OSI License Proliferation Project was startedLicense Proliferation Project on opensource.com (2004) has prepared a License Proliferation Report in 2007.License Proliferation Report on opensource.com (2007) The report defined classes of licenses: *Licenses that are popular and widely used or with strong communities *International licenses *Special purpose licenses *Other/Miscellaneous licenses *Licenses that are redundant with more popular licenses *Non-reusable licenses *Superseded licenses *Licenses that have been voluntarily retired *Uncategorized Licenses The group of \\"popular\\" licenses include nine licenses: Apache License 2.0, New BSD license, GPLv2, LGPLv2, MIT license, Mozilla Public License 1.1, Common Development and Distribution License, Common Public License, Eclipse Public License.  FSF's stance  Richard Stallman, former president of FSF, and Bradley M. Kuhn, former Executive Director, have argued against license proliferation since 2000, when they instituted the FSF license list, which urges developers to license their software under GPL compatible free software license(s), though multiple GPL-incompatible free software licenses are listed with a comment stating that there is no problem using and/or working on a piece of software already under the licenses in question while also urging readers of the list not to use those licenses on software they write.The earliest archived version of the license list reflects this position. Ciarán O'Riordan of FSF Europe argues that the main thing that the FSF can do to prevent license proliferation is to reduce the reasons for making new licenses in the first place, in an editorial entitled How GPLv3 tackles license proliferation.How GPLv3 tackles license proliferation on linuxdevices.com Generally the FSF Europe consistently recommends the use of the GNU GPL as much as possible, and when that is not possible, to use GPL-compatible licenses.  Others  In 2005 Intel has voluntarily retracted their Intel Open Source License from the OSI list of open source licenses and has also ceased to use or recommend this license to reduce license proliferation. The 451group created in June 2009 a proliferation report called The Myth of Open Source License Proliferation.The Myth of Open Source License Proliferation on the451group.com A 2009 paper from the University of Washington School of Law titled Open Source License Proliferation: Helpful Diversity or Hopeless Confusion? called for three things as a solution: \\"A Wizzier Wizzard\\" (for license selection), \\"Best Practices and Legacy Licenses\\", \\"More Legal Services For Hackers\\".Open Source License Proliferation: Helpful Diversity or Hopeless Confusion? on law.washington.edu by Robert W.

Mansfield had been involved in high-profile disputes over planning permission for his developments. By 2011, Mansfield's companies' debts could not be serviced, and his commercial properties passed to the National Asset Management Agency. Early life Mansfield was born on 9 April 1939 and was raised in Brittas, County Dublin. He left school, initially buying a lorry and working in the haulage business, then later renting or selling lorries to contractors. He allegedly made his fortune selling machinery left over from the Falklands war. It was from this industry that Mansfield expanded his business empire to include the Mansfield Group and HSS Ltd. Business career Mansfield's assets grew in the 1980s, according to a 2003 report in the Sunday Business Post , upon selling 100,000 tonnes of machinery, including some 1,100 earth-movers, which had been left over from the Falklands War between Britain and Argentina, for an estimated STG100 million. The Irish Times estimated the profit at £19 million in the US and a further £7 million in the UK. Mansfield realised that land was going up in value in Ireland in the early 1990s, and he successfully secured several thousand acres in and near Saggart, County Dublin, as well as other small pockets of land throughout Dublin. As property demand rose, so did the land value, and he successfully turned over his land assets. Mansfield's Citywest Hotel was built from scratch and established as the venue for the annual Fianna Fáil Ardfheis and for GAA functions. He carried on dealing in his machinery trade, which once again added to his wealth, amounting to a reputed €200 million, as of a 21 February 2010 report in the Irish edition of the Sunday Times.Sunday Times (Ireland), 21 February 2010. In 1999 he bought Palmerstown House, an estate near Johnstown, County Kildare, from Anne Moen Bullitt for IR£10million (€12.7million). In 2000 he purchased the Weston Aerodrome, a €13 million airfield to the south west of Dublin. He expanded the airfield to include a flight training facility but without full planning permission. In 2007 Mansfield's Citywest group bought the Finnstown Countryhouse Hotel and the property's surrounding 45 acres in Lucan, Dublin for an estimated €50 million. As of 2005 his wealth was estimated by Estates Gazette to be 264 million UK pounds. In a 2006 interview with the Sunday Business Post, Mansfield claimed that his net worth had been independently valued at 1.6 billion euros. Receivership Following the collapse of the Irish property bubble in the late 2000s, Mansfield had the main part of his empire, the Citywest Hotel complex, placed into receivership in 2010. The Bank of Scotland (Ireland) took steps to recover €170m loaned to two companies. On 20 April 2011, the National Asset Management Agency seized the last of the major assets in Mansfield's property empire. Apart from Weston Airport, also seized were six of his apartment blocks at Citywest in Saggart and at Palmerstown House Estate, which includes a championship golf course. Personal life Jim Mansfield and his wife Anne had three sons, Tony, Jimmy and P.J. Mansfield suffered from multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare condition that causes symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. He died on 29 January 2014, aged 74, and was survived by his wife and their sons.

She was later converted to a submarine rescue ship. She was named after the ortolan, a European bunting. Ortolan was laid down 9 July 1918 by the Staten Island Shipbuilding Co., New York City, United States; launched 30 January 1919; sponsored by Miss Theresa M. Finn; and commissioned 17 September 1919, Lt. William A. James in command. U.S. west coast operations Assigned to the Pacific Fleet, Ortolan got underway for the west coast 10 November 1919. Following stops at east and U.S. Gulf coast ports, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, she arrived at San Diego, California, 13 June 1920. Nine days later she sailed north to Bremerton, Washington, where she remained, with a caretaker crew, until 23 March 1921. Then returning to Southern California, she served as a tugboat for a year and on 3 May 1922 decommissioned at Mare Island, California. Recommissioned 11 July, she assumed the duties of tender at the Submarine Base, San Pedro, California. From 9 June to 25 August 1923 she conducted cold weather operations off Alaska in her first extended cruise as flagship, Commander, Composite Submarine Squadrons Pacific in company with and four S-class submarines. While in Anchorage, Alaska on 17 July 1923 the submarine was accidentally sunk alongside Ortolan during maintenance, but was quickly raised and there was no loss of life though the submarine's motors were damaged requiring tow by Ortolan. During September she assisted in the salvage of the seven destroyers wrecked in the Honda Point Disaster, earlier in the month, then resumed tender operations out of San Pedro, California. Operating from there until 1927, she ranged the west coast of the Americas from Panama to Oregon — and once, January–April 1924, cruised in the Caribbean on fleet maneuvers. In July 1927 she steamed west, accompanying and two divisions of \\"S\\"-boats to Pearl Harbor. The following month she assisted in the search for competitors lost during the \\"Dole Race\\", the first flight linking the West Coast and Hawaii. In September she resumed her west coast tender activities and for another two years ranged the eastern Pacific as submarines conducted training exercises. Redesignated as submarine rescue vessel Redesignated a submarine rescue vessel ASR–5 on 12 September 1929, Ortolan's mission changed, but, throughout the 1930s, her area of operations continued, with brief exceptions for fleet problems and, in 1936, a four-month tour at Pearl Harbor, in the California area. In 1939 the Ortolan assisted in the recovery of the USS Squalus off Portsmouth, NH. Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor On 10 December 1941, Ortolan sailed west again and on the 21st arrived at Pearl Harbor to assist in the staggering salvage job which was the aftermath of the Japanese attack two weeks earlier. For the next half year she worked on, and finally floated, . On 18 July 1942, she reported for a year's tour with Pearl Harbor based submarines, recovering torpedoes and assisting in preparations for war patrols. She then trained Navy divers and in October prepared for combat duty with the installation of new sound gear and new armament, two 3-inch and two 20 mm guns. World War II Pacific Theatre operations Troop transport SS President Coolidge being abandoned after beaching. Heading out across the Pacific, 1 November, she arrived at Espiritu Santo on the 20th.

The cruisers sailed 12 days later and Ortolan commenced a busy two months during which she assisted vessels, PT boats to destroyers and transports, surveyed sunken Japanese and recovered downed \\"Zeros\\" for intelligence evaluation. \\"Intelligence gathering\\" extended well into 1943 as Ortolan took on the salvaging of two Japanese submarines, one a two-man \\"midget\\", the other a 320-foot boat loaded with supplies. Both lay in the waters off Guadalcanal's northern coast. Although frequently interrupted for other, more pressing, salvage or repair jobs, Ortolan raised the \\"midget\\" and towed her to Kukum Bay in May, and, in June delivered her to Noumea. Return to stateside operations Overhaul at Auckland followed and in October she returned to the Solomon Islands. There, and in the New Hebrides, she continued salvage work into 1944. On 17 January, she departed for Noumea, thence heading east. After abbreviated transport and submarine training duties en route, she arrived at San Pedro 4 March 1944. At the end of April she reported for duty with the Western Sea Frontier and for the ensuing 18 months operated as escort and torpedo recovery vessel for submarines conducting exercises off California. Pacific post-war operations Two months after the formal Japanese surrender Ortolan again headed west. She trained Navy divers at Pearl Harbor until April 1946, then got underway for the Far East. Arriving at Tsingtao, China, 18 May, she operated with U.S. 7th Fleet submarines and conducted diving operations until November. On the 13th she sailed homeward, arriving at San Francisco, California, 24 December.

The National Runaway Safeline (also known as NRS or 1-800-RUNAWAY; formerly known as National Runaway Switchboard) is the national communications system designated by the United States federal government for runaway and homeless youth, their parents and families, teens in crisis, and others who might benefit from its services. It is confidential, anonymous, non- judgmental, non-directive, and free. The hotline number is 1-800-RUNAWAY. Calls are answered every day of the year, 24 hours a day. NRS answers well over 100,000 calls a year from all states and U.S. territories. In 2008, forty-nine percent of the crisis calls were from youth. Half of the youths making crisis calls were on the street. Some of the problems identified by callers to 1-800-RUNAWAY include: family dynamics, peer and social problems, school education, physical abuse, and alcohol or drug use. Some simply wish to talk and need an attentive listener. They can also obtain referrals to legal resources in their community and employment programs. NRS maintains a database of over 16,000 organizations throughout the country to which callers can be referred, and other specialized hotlines that serve youth and families. Parents or other relatives of runaways also frequently turn to the hotline to find help in learning what they can do about a child who has run away, how to go about making an official report, and to get emotional support during the crisis. Often, parents call not because their children already are missing, but because they fear they might run away in the future or because of ongoing problems involving discipline, drug abuse or alcohol abuse, truancy, etc. Runaways can use the NRS message service to forward messages to parents or guardians after they have run away, if they do not wish to call them directly. Parents or guardians can, in turn, leave messages with the NRS for a youth who has run away to pick up. The hope is that these relays will form a foundation for improved communication between the runaway and the family and make reunification more likely. NRS also can make conference calls to connect runaways with their family members if they do wish to call them but don't have money for the call, or if they wish an NRS to moderate the conversation and help to smooth the discussion. NRS, in conjunction with Greyhound Lines, administers the Home Free program, which has reunited more than 13,000 runaway youth with their families with free bus tickets back home. NRS also maintains a website, www.1800RUNAWAY.org, which was significantly revamped in 2006 and which presents a wide range of information on NRS and on runaway and homeless youth in general, including guidance for what families should do if a child is missing. The switchboard calls are answered both by staff members and volunteers. The organization has more than 150 volunteers, all of whom are based in the NRS office in Chicago. Volunteers receive 40 hours of training before they can start to work on the crisis line, and are closely supervised by paid NRS staff. The organization is financed by federal and state agencies, personal donations, and grants from private companies and charitable foundations. The agency also has developed, in cooperation with DePaul University, an extensive Runaway Prevention Curriculum for use by community organizations and educators. It is available either through Internet download or as a CD-ROM. The organization also can supply schools and other organizations with promotional materials, such as posters and pamphlets, that highlight issues relating to teen runaways. From 2000-2018, the agency was directed by Maureen Blaha, a former head of a statewide child abuse program for the Children's Home and Aid Society of Illinois. Blaha also used to be the executive liaison for the Massachusetts Office for Children, an advocacy and regulatory agency. The current Executive Director is Susan Frankel, a former Board member and inspiring leader. In 2006, Ludacris (singer Chris \\"Ludacris\\" Bridges) featured The National Runaway Switchboard in the music video of his Grammy-award winning single, \\"Runaway Love\\". The history of NRS goes back to the early 1970s. In 1971, Metro-Help was established to help Chicago youth in crisis as a clearinghouse to connect them with services throughout the region. In 1974, the crisis line received an 8-month demonstration grant from the federal government to expand its scope from a local line to a national call center and a short time later changed its name to National Runaway Switchboard. NRS was officially designated by the government as the country's \\"national communication system\\" to assist runaway youth and homeless teens. NRS is the oldest such hotline in the world, and has received over 3 million calls since its founding.

Design The carbine was designed and patented by Ambrose Burnside, who resigned his commission in the U.S. Army to devote himself full-time to working on the weapon. The carbine used a special brass cartridge which was also invented by Burnside. This cartridge contained a bullet and powder, but no primer. Pressing the weapon's two trigger guards opened the breech block and allowed the user to insert a cartridge. The rather peculiar Burnside cartridge. When the trigger was pulled, the hammer struck a separate percussion cap and caused a spark; a hole in the base of the cartridge exposed the black powder to this spark. The unique, conical cartridge sealed the joint between the barrel and the breech. Most other breech-loading weapons of the day tended to leak hot gas when fired, but Burnside's design eliminated this problem. Service history In 1857, the Ryon Burnside carbine won a competition at West Point against 17 other carbine designs. In spite of this, few of the carbines were immediately ordered by the government, but this changed with the outbreak of the Civil War, when over 55,000 were ordered for use by Union cavalrymen. This made it the third most popular carbine of the Civil War; only the Sharps carbine and the Spencer carbine were more widely used. They saw action in all theatres of the war. There were so many in service that many were captured and used by Confederates. A common complaint by users was that the unusually shaped cartridge sometimes became stuck in the breech after firing. On the basis of ordnance returns and ammunition requisitions, it has been estimated that 43 Union cavalry regiments were using the Burnside carbine during the 1863-1864 period. Additionally, 7 Confederate cavalry units were at least partially armed with the weapon during this same period. Five different models were produced. Production was discontinued towards the end of the Civil War, when the Burnside Rifle Company was given a contract to make Spencer carbines instead. Effect of the carbine on Burnside's career Though he was a poor military officer (and not too proud to admit it), Ambrose Burnside rose through the ranks partly because his carbine was so well known. He was pressured by President Lincoln several times to take command of the Union Army of the Potomac. He repeatedly declined, saying, \\"I was not competent to command such a large army as this.\\" When he eventually did accept command, he led the Army of the Potomac to defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg. The battle and the subsequent abortive offensive left Burnside's \\"officers complaining loudly to the White House and the War Department about his incompetence.\\" He also performed poorly at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and a court of inquiry blamed him for the Union failure at the Battle of the Crater, though the blame was later lifted from him.

As well as serving as the local parish church, it is the home of St. Paul's Choir School whose students serve as the choristers in the Choir of St. Paul's, and the Harvard Catholic Center serving the academic community of Harvard University. The church was built from 1916 to 1924 and was designed by Edward T. P. Graham in the Italian Romanesque style. It is part of the Harvard Square Historic District.  History  The Church of St. Paul was one of many parishes in the area founded by Fr. Manasses Dougherty largely in response to the influx of Irish Catholics to the Boston area in the late 19th century. The original St. Paul Church building, a former meeting house of the Shepherd Congregational Society on the site of what is now Harvard University's Holyoke Center, was purchased by Fr. Dougherty in 1873. The cornerstone for the present church building, an Italian Romanesque monument located at Quincy Square (corner of Bow and Arrow Streets), was laid in November 1916 under the leadership of then-pastor Rev. John J. Ryan. The architect was Edward T. P. Graham, a St. Paul parishioner, graduate of Harvard University, and winner of the first Traveling Fellowship to Rome and the École des Beaux-Arts. Graham used Verona's Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore and Torre del Commune as inspirations. The new church building, which was dedicated in October 1924, was at the same site as the St. Paul School, which had been built some years before. By the mid-1960s, enrollment had declined and the parish school was replaced by the Choir School. In 1991, under the direction of then-pastor Rev. John P. Boles (later Auxiliary Bishop of Boston), the original school building was torn down and replaced with a multi-purpose building attached to the church, which houses the rectory, parish offices, the Choir School and the Harvard Catholic Center. The present pastor of St. Paul's and Senior Catholic Chaplain to Harvard is the Reverend William T. Kelly, who has served as pastor since June 2016.  Organ  View from the nave looking toward the high altar An organ of 35 stops was built for the original church building in 1904 by Jesse Woodberry & Co (Opus 251), designed by Edward MacGoldrick. The organ was enlarged to 50 stops and relocated to the gallery of the present building between 1923 and 1924 by Emil Mias. Mias died before the organ's completion, so his son, Paul F.C. Mias finished the organ. Casavant Frères built in 1947 a new console for the Woodberry/Mias organ, which was their Op. 1893. In 1959, Casavant annexed a Chancel organ (Op. 1893, 2560A) of 19 ranks, in the 'neo-baroque' style in the south transept to the Woodberry/Mias gallery organ. The gallery organ underwent significant tonal alterations in 1971 under the direction of Arthur Birchall, former vice- president of Aeolian-Skinner. A new “console\\" was completed in 1999 by Robert M. Turner, and numerous electronic \\"voices\\" were synthesized by Walker Technical Company. In 2015 plans were finalized to return the console to its original position in the Organ gallery, and the digital voices were all removed, along with the neo-baroque pipework. An 1855 chamber organ was also erected in the South transept for use when the choir sings in that location.  Directors of Music  * 1878-1889 Louisa T.

Behind the ship is a waterspout. Sabrina Island () was an islet formed during the months of June and July 1811 by a submarine volcanic eruption off the coast of Ponta da Ferraria, São Miguel Island, Azores. The first person to land on the island was Commander James Tillard, captain of the British warship , who hoisted the Union Jack on the island and claimed sovereignty for Great Britain. A diplomatic row with Portugal over the issue ensued, which the island's sinking back into the sea rendered moot. History Formation and discovery Between January and February 1811 a prolonged period of seismic activity affected the settlements to the extreme southeast of São Miguel, in particular in the parishes of Ginetes and Mosteiros. During these months, gases emitted from the ocean around Ponta da Ferraria, but by the end of February they abruptly ceased. New tremors returned in May and June, destroying many homes in Ginetes. Finally on 10 June 1811, in an area about from the original seismic zones and about off the coast, a submarine eruption occurred alongside Ponta da Ferraria, killing many fish. On 12 June, the eruption was seen from the British sloop HMS Sabrina, which was patrolling the Azores due to the then ongoing Peninsular War. Commander James Tillard, thinking the smoke from the eruption was a naval battle, sailed to the area but found a situation quite different than he imagined. He later wrote a description of the eruption and his visit to the island of Sabrina for the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.Tillard (1812), pp.152–8. The next morning, 13 June, HMS Sabrina landed in Ponta Delgada as Tillard had a pre-appointed meeting with William Harding Read, British consul general to the Azores. Read informed Tillard of the multiple earthquakes felt on São Miguel, especially in Ginetes and Mosteiros, which had caused panic among the island's residents. On 14 June Tillard desired to approach the eruption zone again by sea but wind conditions disallowed it, so instead he rode to Ginetes by horse, where he was able to observe the eruption from land. As Tillard lunched by the coast in Ginetes, seismic activity was so intense it caused a landslide destroying part of the cliff nearest him. Tillard, even more enthusiastic, sailed HMS Sabrina toward the eruption area on the night of 15 June, but weak winds still kept him from approaching as closely as he hoped. Again on 18 June the HMS Sabrina approached the eruption zone. In an area where the Sabrina's crew had previously measured a depth of 40 fathoms, or , they now observed rock formations just below the water's surface, as well as constant emission of ash and steam. After three hours of observation, the growing volcanic landmass had reached an estimated altitude of above sea level. Tillard christened the newly-formed island Sabrina after his ship. The following day, 19 June, Sabrina Island had grown to an estimated altitude of above sea level and measured approximately in diameter. Despite being away from the island, the HMS Sabrina became covered in fine black ash and water thrown into the air by the eruption. The ship's crew unsuccessfully attempted a closer approach of the island, after which they returned to port in Ponta Delgada. Diplomatic row between Great Britain and Portugal On 4 July, the eruption appeared to stop and constant tremors—felt in Ginetes since May—ceased. In fair weather the HMS Sabrina finally approached the new island. Tillard and Read landed on the island, planted the Union Jack, and formally claimed the island for Great Britain and King George III. This claim caused a diplomatic conflict with the Kingdom of Portugal, as the Azores were under Portuguese sovereignty and had been since their discovery. This was compounded by the fact England and Portugal have been allies continuously since at least 1386. In fact, as previously noted, the HMS Sabrina was in the Azores because Britain was assisting Portugal in the Peninsular War. Because of the war, the Portuguese government and monarchy had relocated to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As they were dependent on British aid against the French, they did not pursue the issue with too much zeal. The conflict petered out naturally by October of 1811, by which time water erosion had dismantled the new island, as is often the case with islands formed by certain types of volcanic eruptions. Legacy A member of the HMS Sabrina's crew, Colonel John William Miles, drew Sabrina Island during the 19 June 1811 approach. His work is today exhibited at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, United Kingdom. The eruption garnered international scientific interest and commentary at the time. Among others, Charles Darwin wrote a letter regarding the incident. A similar occurrence and diplomatic spat took place in 1831 in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Sicily. After a volcanic eruption formed an island, Great Britain claimed it as Graham Island. The ensuing four-way territorial dispute between Great Britain, France, Spain, and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies ultimately resolved as the Sabrina Island conflict had. Geography At its largest, Sabrina Island was a circular volcanic cone with a perimeter of and an altitude between above sea level. The cone was similar in form to the existing Islet of Vila Franca do Campo, with an open ring to the northwest. From the central ring debris escaped into the sea. Because of water erosion, islands formed by submarine volcanic activity often have short, ephemeral existences, especially if they are formed of uncompacted tephra. This was the case with Sabrina Island: despite reaching a height of about , it was quickly destroyed by erosion. Today, the area where the eruption occurred measures deep. The underwater rock formation there slopes toward the southeast, and the surrounding area has an average depth of . Volcanic activity continues: volcanic gases can still be seen rising to the surface.

The novels were written by Tamora Pierce. Dedicate Lark runs Discipline Cottage with the plant mage Dedicate Rosethorn, who is her lover, in the Winding Circle temple complex, in Emelan. She is a dedicate for the earth temple in Winding Circle, and due to this always wears a dark-green habit as a symbol of her order. Although she has many responsibilities as a member of Winding Circle's governing council, she, with Rosethorn, takes the time to look after troublesome mage students who have problems fitting in with mainstream temple life. Lark is an ambient thread mage with powers in spinning, weaving and other manipulations of thread. She shares Lady Sandrilene fa Toren's magic, and becomes her permanent teacher in threadcraft and magic throughout the Circle of Magic series, beginning by teaching Sandry to spin early in Sandry's Book. After Sandry becomes fully accredited as a mage in her own right, the two remain close friends, and she gives Sandry advice on how to deal with the girl's first student in Magic Steps. Unusually for a mage, Lark did not discover her magic until she was thirty, not realising until then that her interest and talents with thread were magic. Despite this, Lark is now considered a Great Mage, one of the most powerful thread mages living - though even she cannot manipulate pure magic as her former student Sandry can. Before discovering her magic, Lark lived for many years as a tumbler, travelling all over the fictional world of the series. Some time before she discovered her magic, however, she became sick with asthma and was no longer able to work. She was forced to live in the slums of Emelan's capital Summersea, because she could not afford to live anywhere else. Lark is said in the books to have glossy dark brown hair and cocoa colored skin; she is also cheerful and good- natured, in direct contrast to Rosethorn, who is prickly and sharp tempered.

His birth name was .  Biography  He was born on Sado island in Niigata Prefecture into a wealthy and influential family. His younger brother was the noted philosopher Tsuchida Kyōson (1891-1934). As an adolescent, Bakusen's father put him on the career path of a Buddhist priest, but he fled the temple where he was apprenticed in order to study art instead. He was accepted as a student by painter Takeuchi Seihō, and later studied at the Kyoto Kaiga Senmon Gakko (present day Kyoto City University of Arts) from which he graduated in 1911. In 1918, Bakusen established a painting collective together with Murakami Kagaku, Ono Chikkyō, Sakakibara Shihō, and Nonagase Banka called the Kokuga Society (Kokuga Sōsaku Kyōkai, or \\"Society for the Creation of National Painting\\"), which was used as a vehicle to disseminate the group's eclectic style combining western yōga and Japanese (Nihonga) painting techniques and styles. His favorite subjects were women (bijinga), especially portraits of maiko, but he also painted flowers and still life themes. The Kokuga Society established its own annual exhibition, the Kokuten (abbreviation for \\"Kokuga Sōsaku Kyōkai Tenrankai\\") in competition with the increasingly restrictive Bunten Exhibitions in 1918. Seven Kokuten exhibitions were held between 1918 and 1928. In 1921, the Kokuga Society went on hiatus when Bakusen traveled to Europe with Ono Chikkyō to tour Western art museums. They returned after a little more than a year, and resumed the Kokuga Society in 1923. Bakusen was particularly fond of French Impressionism and post-impressionism, especially the works of Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne, and collected several of their works while in Europe. The Kokuga Society broke up in 1928, due to financial difficulties and internal disagreements. In 1934, Bakusen was appointed to the Teikoku Bijutsuin (Imperial Art Academy). He died in June 1936 of pancreatic cancer. His grave is at the temple of Chishaku-in in Kyoto. One of his works from 1918, , now at the Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art is registered as an Important Cultural Property (ICP) by the Agency for Cultural Affairs. However, his painting from 1923, owned by the same museum, is considered his masterpiece.  Philately  One of Bakusen's works was selected as the subject of a commemorative postage stamp by the Japanese government: * 1979: Bugirinsen, commemorating the 1968 Philatelic Week  Noted works  * , 1912, Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art * , 1918, Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art * , 1924, Tokyo National Museum of Modern Art * , 1927, Kyoto National Museum of Modern Art  References  * Conant, Ellen P., Rimer, J.

Location and features The valley is framed by the Brindabella Range and the Fiery Mountain Range, most notably by Mount Bramina and Bulls Head in the north and Black Bottle Mountain and Mount Franklin in the south. The valley is largely gentle, undulating farmland rising from above sea level in the north to above sea level in the south. Most of the native vegetation in the valley has been removed in favour of pasture, fruit trees and other exotic species, however the surrounding mountains are largely national parks, populated entirely with native flora. The traditional custodians of the area now known as the Brindabella Valley are the Ngunawal, Walgalu and Djimantan indigenous peoples. The valley was first settled by Europeans as a stock outstation for the Yarralumla station in the 1830s, with the first land grant made in 1849. Gold was found in 1860 and mined from the 1880s. In 1887 the Brindabella Gold Mining Company was formed and mining continued until 1910. The valley is now an agricultural area and consists of a number of small cattle farms including the heritage-listed Brindabella Station, the childhood home of Miles Franklin, an early 20th-century Australian author. Access to the Brindabella Valley is via dirt roads from Canberra or Tumut. A private road runs through Long Plain toward Rules Point and , and access is rarely permitted. All roads are subject to frequent closures during heavy snow in winter. The Goodbradigbee River is a popular trout fishing location for Canberra anglers and camp sites were once provided on the east bank of the river within the valley, but since 2017 this area has been rezoned as a travelling stock route and camping is now no longer permitted anywhere in the valley. Much of the river is difficult to reach without crossing private property and anglers should be aware that certain landowners are unlikely to grant access. In 1968 the National Capital Development Commission considered daming the Brindabella Valley for the purpose of sending water from the Goodbradigbee River into the Cotter River via a tunnel. The plan was abandoned. A notable feature of the valley are the transmission lines running from the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme to Canberra.

Johnson, expressing her support of his policies in Vietnam as a \\"parent of a son who was shot down in Hanoi, last week, and is now a prisoner-of-war ...\\" In June 1968, Roberta McCain told Parade magazine, \\"Religion has been of great importance to us in our concern for Johnny, religion and the military tradition of my husband's family. We all pray for the time when we'll see Johnny again.\\" In 1971, McCain requested no special sympathy in regard to her son's captivity. She stated that Navy tradition was important in the family; her daughter married a naval officer, John S. McCain III became a naval aviator, and her younger son Joe enlisted in the Navy during the Vietnam War. John S. McCain III was held as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five-and-a-half years. When notified upon his release on March 15, 1973, that he had shouted expletives at his captors, Roberta McCain's response was, \\"Johnny, I'm going to come over there and wash your mouth out with soap.\\" John S. McCain III said this of his mother: \\"My mother was raised to be a strong, determined woman who thoroughly enjoyed life, and always tried to make the most of her opportunities. She was encouraged to accept, graciously and with good humor, the responsibilities and sacrifices her choices have required of her. I am grateful to her for the strengths she taught me by example.\\"  Later life  Roberta beside her son John McCain's casket McCain campaigned during her son's 2008 presidential bid, and was active in 2007 and 2008 despite her advanced age. In November 2007, her comments during an MSNBC interview about Mitt Romney, his role in organizing the 2002 Winter Olympics, and his Mormonism generated minor political controversy and forced her son to respond to clarify her remarks. In August 2008, she had a fashion shoot and was featured in a pair of Vogue magazine articles. On May 13, 2009, she appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. McCain's comments about Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olbermann created a stir with politicos on both sides even after her son's failed presidential bid. McCain's life of traveling with family, specifically her twin sister, was noted by Maureen Orth in The New York Times in December 2007. On October 22, 2009, she was hospitalized while traveling in Portugal after she fell and injured her head. For her 100th birthday in 2012, she had a small party at the Capitol Hill Club. A few weeks after her 100th birthday, McCain suffered a mild stroke. McCain's centenary was noted in a number of periodicals in the United States, including an article by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Ken Herman. She was featured in Town & Country magazine later that year. In September 2013, television commentator Greta Van Susteren wrote about McCain in an essay that was featured by Politico during their \\"Women Rule\\" series. In September 2013, McCain and her parlor were featured in an article in the peer-reviewed academic journal, the Journal of Urban History. On the occasion of her 106th birthday in February 2018, members of McCain's family took to social media to express birthday wishes and share memories of McCain over the years. McCain accompanied other members of the McCain family in June 2018 for the Washington, D.C. screening of the documentary John McCain: For Whom the Bell Tolls. Before her son John's death in August 2018, she attended a Capitol Hill event where politicians commemorated the Senator as a living requiem. After her son's death, she attended the ceremony that marked the arrival of his remains to lie in state in the United States Capitol rotunda and attended the funeral at the Washington National Cathedral, where eulogies were given by former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, among others. McCain died on October 12, 2020, at the age of 108 at her home in Washington, D.C. At the time of her death, her son Joe was the only one of her children still living; her daughter Jean McCain Morgan had died of mesothelioma the previous November, aged 85.

As military members can only be court-martialed at their home base or unit, being RTU'd for misconduct can often be a precursor to further judicial punishment. RTU'ing is a concept used during a period of specialist training, whereby a service person has been extracted or detached from their home unit. For example, if a service person has been extracted to complete an instruction course run by a specialist unit within the armed forces such as a PTI or Range Control course. In the event of the service person wishing to withdraw from the course (e.g. for personal or medical reasons); or if the course supervisors deem that the service person is unfit to complete the course, for either medical or disciplinary reasons, the service person may be returned to their home unit. If a candidate is RTU'd, the supervisor responsible for sending them home will supply a written report to the service person's OC detailing the reason why they have been RTU'd. If a service person is RTU'd on disciplinary grounds, their OC will decide if any further disciplinary action is needed, based on the RTU report from the course supervisor, and if necessary, by consultation with the course supervisors. The reason this is done is that, according to military law, disciplinary action such as a court-martial can only by issued against a service person by their home unit. There are several reasons why a military member may be RTU'd. It can be for major or minor infractions of the rules, or disorderly behaviour. It may also be on compassionate grounds, such as RTU'ing an injured soldier (or other medical conditions). The term Returned To Unit (RTU) is used in the Canadian Forces and the UK.

British Museum. İznik pottery, an example of fritware Blue and White Bowl with Radial Design, 13th century - Iran.Brooklyn Museum. Fritware, also known as stone-paste, is a type of pottery in which frit (ground glass) is added to clay to reduce its fusion temperature. The mixture may include quartz or other siliceous material. An organic compound such as gum or glue may be added for binding. The resulting mixture can be fired at a lower temperature than clay alone. A glaze is then applied on the surface to harden the object. Fritware was invented to give a strong white body, which, combined with tin-glazing of the surface, allowed it to approximate the result of Chinese porcelain. True porcelain was not manufactured in the Islamic world until modern times, and most fine Islamic pottery was made of fritware. Frit was also a significant component in some early European porcelains. History The manufacture of fritware began in Iraq in the 9th century.Archaeological chemistry by Zvi Goffer p.254 Between the 10th and the 12th centuries the main centre of manufacture moved to Egypt, but the technique then spread throughout the Middle-East. In the 13th century the town of Kashan in Iran was an important centre for the production of fritware. Abū'l-Qāsim, who came from a family of tilemakers in the city, wrote a treatise in 1301 on precious stones that included a chapter on the manufacture of fritware. His recipe specified a fritware body containing a mixture of 10 parts silica to 1 part glass frit and 1 part clay. The frit was prepared by mixing powdered quartz with soda which acted as a flux. The mixture was then heated in a kiln.; This type of pottery has also been referred to as \\"stonepaste\\" and \\"faience\\" among other names. A ninth-century corpus of 'proto-stonepaste' from Baghdad has \\"relict glass fragments\\" in its fabric. The glass is alkali-lime-lead-silica and, when the paste was fired or cooled, wollastonite and diopside crystals formed within the glass fragments. The lack of \\"inclusions of crushed pottery\\" suggests these fragments did not come from a glaze. The reason for their addition would have been to release alkali into the matrix on firing, which would \\"accelerate vitrification at a relatively low firing temperature, and thus increase the hardness and density of the [ceramic] body.\\" Iznik pottery was produced in Ottoman Turkey beginning in the last quarter of 15th century AD. It consists of a body, slip, and glaze, where the body and glaze are 'quartz-frit'. The 'frits' in both cases \\"are unusual in that they contain lead oxide as well as soda\\"; the lead oxide would help reduce the thermal expansion coefficient of the ceramic. Microscopic analysis reveals that the material that has been labeled 'frit' is 'interstitial glass' which serves to connect the quartz particles. The glass was added as frit and the interstitial glass formed on firing. Fritware dish with grape design, Iznik pottery, Turkey, 1550–70. British Museum.

This is the second adaptation of the book, following the Emmy Award-winning 1976 mini- series Sybil that was broadcast by NBC. The university scenes were filmed at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. In January 2006, The Hollywood Reporter announced CBS had greenlit the project, but it was shelved after completion. The film was released in Italy, New Zealand, the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Norway, and Hungary before finally being broadcast in the US by CBS on June 7, 2008. Plot Tammy Blanchard and Jessica Lange in Sybil Troubled Columbia University art student and later student teacher Sybil Dorsett is referred to psychiatrist Cornelia Wilbur by Dr. Atcheson, a colleague who believes that the young woman is suffering from female hysteria. As her treatment progresses, Sybil confesses that she frequently experiences blackouts and cannot account for large blocks of time. Wilbur helps her recall a childhood in which she suffered physical, emotional, and sexual abuse at the hands of her disturbed mother Hattie. Eventually, 16 identities varying in age and personal traits begin to emerge. Chief among them is Victoria, a French woman who explains to Dr. Wilbur how she shepherds the many parts of Sybil's whole. Frustrating the therapist are objections raised by her associates, who suspect she has influenced her patient into creating her other selves, and Sybil's father, who refuses to admit his late wife was anything other than a loving mother. Although she had promised never to hypnotize Sybil, later into the treatment, Dr. Wilbur takes her patient to her home by a lake and hypnotizes her into having all 16 personalities be the same age as she and become just aspects of Sybil. By nightfall, Sybil claims she feels different, and emotionally declares her hatred toward her mother. The last part of the movie tells of the history of Shirley Mason, the real woman who was known by the pseudonym of Sybil Dorsett. Principal cast * Jessica Lange ..... Dr. Cornelia Wilbur * Tammy Blanchard ..... Sybil Dorsett * Eddie Ruiz ..... Dr. Ladysman * JoBeth Williams ... Hattie Dorsett Critical reception In his review in the New York Times, Neil Genzlinger noted: \\"The film has fine performances by Tammy Blanchard in the title role and Jessica Lange as the psychiatrist. It is crisply told and full of powerful scenes. But it is always battling that earlier Sybil ... [The] story, so revelatory and startling when it was new, is today likely to have the feel of an acting exercise. It is impossible to watch Ms. Blanchard run through her repertory of voices and facial contortions ... without judging her acting technique. She gets an A, but the viewer's investment in the story suffers.\\" Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times said: \\"The new Sybil ... is told at such high speed that it becomes more psychiatric variety show—for our next number, Sybil as a boy!—than the careful excavation of a mind through the life-changing relationship of patient and doctor, which made the original so unforgettable ... It's essentially a two-woman play, and these particular women do the absolute best they can with what is given them. Lange's Wilbur is unflinching and unflappable, with equal parts compassion and ambition, empathy and bitterness, while Blanchard is a marvel of physical and vocal elasticity, changing into 16 people, often several in the same conversation. The problem is the almost breakneck pace which requires that all emotional nuance be jettisoned in favor of showing the range of the personalities.\\" In Newsweek, Joshua Alston said the film \\"has the infectious scrappiness of a community- theater troupe, one that isn't that great, but has enough conviction to make up for its lack of self-awareness ... And while I wouldn't watch Sybil a second time, it was raucous, nostalgic fun. I could say it's the worst movie I've seen in some time, but I'd prefer to say it's the best at being not good.\\" Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant observed the film \\"is at once a little more true to the original, but also, at half the time, rushed ... Tammy Blanchard has the role that could be either a career-making tour de force or a showoffy mess and pulls it off.\\" In the Times Herald-Record, Kevin McDonough said: \\"Sybil seems to have been written to challenge and reward the serious performer. It is an actor's dream and potential nightmare, a role that calls upon the player to shift voice, tone and personality on a dime ... Blanchard acquits herself well. She does not eclipse the memory of Field's Sybil, but it is a performance to remember ... The saddest thing about this Sybil is its place in the schedule. A film like this used to be showcased during sweeps, not hidden away on a Saturday night in June like some poor relation ... CBS has shown the movie, its stars, and the story extreme disrespect with this treatment.\\" Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe wondered, \\"Why bother taking on a classic with limited popular potential when the remake is doomed to pale creatively next to the original? I'm thinking maybe this retelling of the true story ... was hatched to give actress Tammy Blanchard a big vehicle to suit her big talent ... Otherwise, this Sybil doesn't quite justify itself ... The remake feels more like a sketch of a troubled life than a fully realized portrait, which also detracts from its power to break your heart.\\" References External links * Category:2007 television films Category:American drama films Category:Films about child abuse Category:Films about psychiatry Category:Films based on actual events Category:Films directed by Joseph Sargent Category:CBS network films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:The Wolper Organization films Category:Dissociative identity disorder in films Category:American films Category:2007 drama films ","title":"Sybil (2007 film)"},{"id":"11689782","text":"A number of war crimes trials were held in the 1960s in Soviet Estonia.

The accused were charged with murdering up to 5000 German and Czechoslovakian Jews and Romani people near the Kalevi-Liiva concentration camp in 1942–1943.

According to testimony of the survivors, at least two transports with about 2,100–2,150 people, arrived at the railway station at Raasiku, one from Theresienstadt concentration camp with Czechoslovakian Jews and one from Berlin with German Jews. Around 1,700–1,750 people, mainly Jews, not selected for work at the Jägala camp were taken to Kalevi-Liiva and shot.

A selection process was supervised by Ain-Ervin Mere, chief of Sicherheitspolizei in Estonia; those not selected for slave labor were sent by bus to an execution site near the camp. Later the police in teams of 6 to 8 men would execute the Jews by machine gun fire, on other hand, during later investigation some guards of camp denied participation of police and said that execution was done by camp personnel. On the first day a total of 900 people were murdered in this way. Gerrets told that he had fired a pistol at a victim who was still making noises in the pile of bodies.

Original documents related to the Mere-Gerrets-Viik trial are to be found in Estonian State Archives – Party Archives Branch – ERA PA, Collection 129, boxes 63–70.  Tartu trials  By the early 1960s, the Soviet government was pursuing Juhan Jüriste, Karl Linnas and Ervin Viks, who were accused of murdering 12,000 people in the Tartu concentration camp. A more recent estimate concluded that the number was around 3,500 people, mainly Estonian and Estonian Jews as well as some Soviet POWs and Jews from Poland and Czechoslovakia. According to an official Soviet account: \\"the main culprit, Ervin Viks, fled the ire of the people and now lives in Australia, whereas Linnas found shelter in the USA\\".Немецко-фашистская оккупация в Эстонии. 1941–1944. Tallinn, 1963. Page 57. The Soviet authorities requested the extradition of both men, but against the background of the Cold War, were flatly refused. In January 1962, a show trial was conducted with the three accused [Jüriste present and Linnas and Viks absent] men tried in absentia in Tartu and sentenced to death. The transcript and verdict of the trial were published in the magazine Sotsialisticheskaya zakonnost (Soviet Jurisprudence) in December before the trial had even occurred. The actual trial started in January the following year, delayed because one of the defendants was ill. During the trials in Tallinn and Tartu quite a few witnesses pointed out Heinrich Bergmann as the key figure behind the extermination of Estonian gypsies. The Australian Attorney General, Sir Garfield Barwick, continued to reject the request for Viks, claiming that it could not be met because: the USSR and Australia did not have an extradition treaty; Viks had passed immigration screening processes and; consequently, any such extradition would undermine Australian sovereignty.David Fraser Daviborshch's Cart: Narrating the Holocaust in Australian War Crimes Trials, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln Ne., 2011, pp56-7 Viks died in Australia in 1983. In 1987 Linnas was finally deported to the USSR, after a US federal appeals court had deemed evidence against him \\"overwhelming and largely uncontroverted.\\"Charles R. Allen, Jr. Patrick J. Buchanan: Master Holocaust Denier (online ) The American judge remarked that his crimes \\"were such as to offend the decency of any civilized society.\\" Linnas died in a Soviet prison hospital of old age in 1987.

Although situated in a parish with the same name, Raasiku is not the official administrative centre of the municipality (which is Aruküla, located some kilometres or one railway station closer to Tallinn). The settlement started to grow in the 19th century around the railway station. The Raasiku manor (first mentioned in 1497) was established on the grounds of the earlier Kaemla (Keamol) village and in the middle ages it belonged to Padise Abbey. There is a primary school (since 1717), community centre, library, health care centre, pharmacy, kindergarten and three grocery stores in Raasiku. Also, some industrial manufacturers operate there: AS Mistra produces car carpets and wall finishing materials; AS Raasiku Elekter makes electrical equipment and metal products. Harju-Jaani John the Baptist Lutheran Church is in Raasiku. The current church building was built in 1863, but there are preserved foundations of the old chapel. There is the churchyard, the old and the new cemetery and a manor park. Transport Raasiku train station water tower Raasiku is split by the Tallinn-Tapa railway. The railway station was opened in 1870. In Soviet times a building for the goods station and signalling control was built. The old wooden passenger station was demolished in 2000, but the ancillary buildings and water tower have been preserved. All suburban trains stop there and also trains heading in the direction of Tartu and Narva (except for express trains). A ride to Tallinn takes about 35 minutes (30 minutes with the express suburban train). Raasiku also has a bus connection to Tallinn (generally much slower than the train due to the length of the lines and a large number of stops). There are four bus stops in Raasiku. The Jägala–Aruvalla road passes through Raasiku and local roads to Kostivere, Kehra, Anija and Aruaru emerge from it. Sports There's a football club Raasiku FC Joker based in Raasiku, currently playing in the Estonian fourth division II liiga.

Freedmen comprised a majority of the population and had been electing Republican candidates to office. Members of an Alabama chapter of the White League, a paramilitary group supporting the Democratic Party's drive to regain conservative political power in the county and state, attacked black Republicans at the polls. The members of the White League killed at least seven black voters and wounded 70, while driving away more than 1,000 unarmed black people at the polls. In attacking the polling place in Spring Hill, the League influenced the outcome of the elections. They turned all Republicans out of office and Democratic candidates took a majority of offices up for election. Background The White League had formed in 1874 as an insurgent, white Democratic paramilitary group in Grant Parish and nearby parishes\\"Parishes\\" in the State of Louisiana are administrative regions basically analogous to \\"Counties\\" in most other States of the United States of America. on the Red River of the South in Louisiana. The League was founded by members of the white militia who had committed the Colfax Massacre in Louisiana in 1873, killing numerous black people in order to turn out Republicans from parish offices as part of the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election. Historians such as George Rabe consider groups such as the White League and Red Shirts as a \\"military arm\\" of the Democratic Party. Their members worked openly to disrupt Republican meetings, and attacked and intimidated voters to suppress black voting. They courted press attention rather than operating secretly, as had the Ku Klux Klan. Chapters spread to Alabama and other states in the Deep South. A similar paramilitary group was the Red Shirts, which originated in Mississippi and became active in the Carolinas. Both paramilitary groups contributed to the Democrats' regaining control in the state legislatures in the late 1870s. The Red Shirts were still active in the 1890s and were implicated in the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 in North Carolina.LeRae Umfleet, \\"Chapter 3: Practical Politics\\" , 1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission Report, North Carolina Dept. of Cultural Resources Events On election day, November 3, 1874, an Alabama chapter of the White League repeated actions taken earlier that year in Vicksburg, Mississippi. They invaded Eufaula, killing at least seven black Republicans, injuring at least 70 more, and driving off more than 1,000 unarmed Republicans from the polls.Mary Ellen Curtin, Black Prisoners and Their World, Alabama, 1865-1900, University Press of Virginia, 2000, p. 55 The group moved on to Spring Hill, where members stormed the polling place, destroying the ballot box, and killing the 16-year-old son of a white Republican judge in their shooting.Curtin (2000), Black Prisoners, pp. 55-56. The White League refused to count any Republican votes cast. But, Republican voters reflected the black majority in the county, as well as white supporters. They outnumbered Democratic voters by a margin greater than two to one. The League declared the Democratic candidates victorious, forced Republican politicians out of office, and seized every county office in Barbour County in a kind of coup d'état.Curtin (2000), Black Prisoners, p. 56 Such actions were repeated in other parts of the South in the 1870s, as Democrats sought to regain political dominance in states with black majorities and numerous Republican officials. In Barbour County, the Democrats auctioned off as \\"slaves\\" (for a maximum cost of $2 per month), or otherwise silenced all Republican witnesses to the events. They were intimidated from testifying to the coup if the case went to federal court. Legacy Due to the actual and threatened violence by the White League, black voters began to stay away from the polls in Barbour County. They no longer voted in sufficient number to retain a majority of Republican officeholders. White conservative Democrats continued to intimidate black voters through the late 19th century, especially after a Populist-Republican alliance elected some Fusion candidates in the Deep South, as well as local Republican officials in many states. In 1875, Mississippi Democrats also used widespread intimidation to control local elections, which became known as the Mississippi Plan. Such violence was adopted by chapters in other cities and counties. Democrats regained control of Alabama and other state legislatures. Reconstruction ended with the withdrawal of federal troops as part of a compromise to elect Rutherford B Hayes. In 1901 the Democratic-dominated state legislature in Alabama, like other southern states, followed Mississippi's lead to end such election- related violence by passing a new constitution that effectively disenfranchised most black people by such measures as poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses and white primaries. Poll taxes and literacy tests also disfranchised tens of thousands of poor whites in Alabama. Although the Democratic legislature had promised whites would not be affected by the new measures, politicians wanted to preclude poor whites allying with black people in Populist-Republican coalitions.Glenn Feldman, The Disenfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama, Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp. 135–136 With disfranchisement achieved, the legislature passed laws imposing racial segregation and other elements of Jim Crow, a system that lasted well into the 1960s. At that time, the gains of the Civil Rights Movement led to Congressional passage of legislation in the mid-1960s that prohibited segregation and began to enforce the constitutional rights for minorities to suffrage and equal protection under the law. In 1979, to commemorate the election riot, the state erected a historical marker located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 82 and Barbour County Road 49 near Comer, Alabama. It reads: :Near here is Old Spring Hill, the site of one of the polling places for the November 3, 1874 local, state and national elections. Elias M. Keils, scalawag and Judge of the City Court of Eufaula, was United States supervisor at the Spring Hill ballot box. William, his 16 year-old son, was with him. After the polls closed, a mob broke into the building, extinguished the lights, destroyed the poll box and began shooting. During the riot, Willie Keils was mortally wounded. The resulting Congressional investigation received national attention. This bloody episode marked the end of the Republican domination in Barbour County. - Erected by the Historic Chattahoochee Commission, 1979.

Arriving at Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 20 July, she transported troops and supplies and conducted training exercises during the next three months. In November, she got underway for the Philippine combat area. Sailing in a Leyte supply and reinforcement convoy on the 5th, she came under enemy fire for the first time on the 12th. After that day of air attacks off the Leyte assault beaches, she endured many more as she remained in the area until 6 December. On 7 December, she took the offensive and landed assault troops at Ormoc Bay. On the 15th, she conducted similar operations against Mindoro. She departed Leyte Gulf again on 27 January 1945, and steamed back to Mindoro with reinforcements; then headed for Luzon with elements of the 11th Airborne Division embarked. On 5 February, as the battle to free Manila was beginning, she landed them at Nasugbu, south of the entrance to Manila Bay.

His personas in the band included Dick Vaughn, 5-time CalPi Award winner; auto trivia expert Dick Goodbody, and Pastor Richard Seeland, an ordained minister. While looking through used records in a thrift store in the mid 1980s, Lyons discovered a 1968 LP by Baptist preacher Estus Pirkle entitled If Footmen Tire You, What Will Horses Do? Lyons was intrigued by the LP and brought it to the other members of Negativland. They sampled phrases and rearranged words from Pirkle's sermon to create the song \\"Christianity Is Stupid\\" which was released on their 1987 album Escape From Noise. Another song from Escape From Noise, \\"Nesbitt's Lime Soda Song\\", was composed and sung by Lyons. In 1988, Richard Lyons masterminded a hoaxed press release that claimed the Negativland song \\"Christianity Is Stupid\\" had inspired 16-year-old David Brom to murder his entire immediate family. It also claimed that Negativland had been \\"advised by Federal official Dick Jordan not to leave town pending an investigation into the Brom murders\\". Lyons came up with the idea for the press release when Negativland could not afford to go on tour in support of Escape From Noise. Lyons prepared the phony press release and mailed it out to various news outlets, many of whom took it at face value. The hoax received widespread media coverage, inspiring Negativland's next album Helter Stupid. After taking a brief hiatus from the group, Lyons composed and sang several songs on Negativland's 1997 album Dispepsi, including \\"Happy Hero\\" and \\"The Greatest Taste Around\\". He also created an art piece using letters found in junkyard cars. He compiled and arranged the found letters with photographs of the wrecked cars to create a Xeroxed book that he distributed to friends. Lyons recorded a segment about his book for an episode of This American Life entitled \\"Other People's Mail\\". In 2002 the book was released by Negativland with an accompanying soundtrack CD as Deathsentences of the Polished and Structurally Weak. Lyons traveled with the band during its \\"True or False\\" tour, doing a mid-show version of \\"Pastor Dick's Treehouse\\". Death Richard Lyons died on his 57th birthday, April 19, 2016, from complications of nodular melanoma.

The song was also released on Powderfinger's 2004 compilation album Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000. \\"These Days\\" was not released as a single, however it topped the Triple J Hottest 100 chart in 1999. It was also awarded Song of the Year at the 2000 Music Critic's Awards. Powderfinger have described \\"These Days\\" as one of their most simple, enduring, and popular works to date. In January 2018, as part of Triple M's \\"Ozzest 100\\", the 'most Australian' songs of all time, \\"These Days\\" was ranked number 77. The song was certified 3x Platinum in Australia in June 2020. In May 2020, Thelma Plum released a cover version of the song. In a statement, Plum said \\"I was given the chance to record a song I grew up with, and as a Brissie local, I already know a couple of the Powderfinger guys so of course, I said yes\\". Writing and production \\"These Days\\" was developed by Powderfinger after a request by film director Gregor Jordan, who asked the band to write a song for his upcoming film, Two Hands, after showing them scenes in which the song would appear. Lead singer Bernard Fanning initially wrote the song, and it was demoed in the garage of guitarist Darren Middleton.Powderfinger (Fanning, Middleton, Haug, Collins, Coghill, et al.) (2004). Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994-2000 companion booklet. Page 3. Fanning described the process of creating the song as \\"the first time there was an outside reason to write a song, rather than my own emotional response to something...we saw the film so I took bits and used it without being too specific.\\". The lyrics of \\"These Days\\" were similarly styled to those of other songs written by Fanning between the production of Internationalist and Odyssey Number Five, such as \\"Passenger\\" and \\"My Kind of Scene\\". The songs generally dealt with the routine and unhappiness of a \\"typical existence\\", according to Esky Magazine's Kelsey Munro. Fanning did not describe this as a conscious theme, despite it appearing in many of his songs, but agreed that the songs did discuss \\"having to always bow down to all of the responsibilities and obligations\\" of life. Fanning also told The Sun- Herald that as a result of the lyrics in \\"These Days\\" and \\"My Happiness\\" (also on Odyssey Number Five), he had been dubbed \\"as some sort of antipodean Mr Miserable.\\" Release The song was initially released by the band as the b-side to the single Passenger, making it the first b-side to top the Triple J Hottest 100. The Two Hands soundtrack, which contained \\"These Days\\" as its lead track,Soundtrack Collector (1999), Two Hands Soundtrack , retrieved on 12 June 2007. was released while Powderfinger were playing their \\"P2K tour\\", and when Powderfinger's album, Internationalist, was selling in bulk. With the release of \\"These Days\\" and \\"My Kind of Scene\\" on movie soundtracks - the latter appeared on the soundtrack for Mission: Impossible 2 - Powderfinger hoped to launch their overseas career. Australian reviewers stated that \\"...there’s a wide world out there yet to hear them, particularly These Days. The time is right...for the band to spread their wings.\\" Response Powderfinger performing \\"These Days\\" on the Across the Great Divide tour, 8 September 2007. \\"These Days\\" topped the Triple J Hottest 100 chart in 1999, as the result of a nationwide listener poll. The song was also awarded Song of the Year at the 2000 Music Critic's Awards. In response to the award wins, Powderfinger said they were \\"excited\\" that they were voted #1 in a listener poll. Fanning jokingly said that \\"We worked out that being number one on the hottest 100 makes us the biggest band in the world because it's the biggest music poll in the world\\", before going on to make a mockery of the band's long time antagonist, Ben Lee, by saying \\"we remembered we can't be the biggest band in the world because Ben Lee is the biggest in the world!\\" Fanning continued to publicly insult Lee, eventually calling him a \\"precocious little cunt\\" in 2005. Fanning alone performed a sombre acoustic guitar version of the song at a live benefit concert in the days following the 2002 Bali bombings. \\"These Days\\" was also rostered briefly on the English curriculum in some Australian high schools, something Fanning took with amazement rather than discomfort, stating that the emotional part of the song development process was the writing, rather than the performing of the song. The song was also featured on \\"The Hidden Toll\\" road trauma campaign, produced by the Victorian Transport Accident Commission, which first aired on Victorian television on 19 October 2005.Transport Accident Commission (2005), New TAC Campaign Unveils The Hidden Toll , retrieved on 12 June 2007. Powderfinger performed \\"These Days\\" at a commemoration service for Heath Ledger, whose breakthrough film was Two Hands. \\"These Days\\" was ranked seventh in a 2008 The Weekend Australian poll for the best Australian songs of the past 20 years. The song was voted at #21 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, 2009, where it was the second- highest placed Australian single in the countdown. The only Australian song to place higher was hip-hop song The Nosebleed Section by the Hilltop Hoods, which early in the song, contains a line from These Days, sung in hip-hop style.

Typically it consists of a vertical pole, normally around a meter high, which is connected to the top of a landmine. When the track or main body of a vehicle passes over the mine, the rod is tilted, releasing a spring-loaded striker which triggers a pyrotechnic delay of approximately half a second, followed by detonation of the main explosive charge. The small time delay allows the vehicle to continue over the mine before detonating, exposing more of it to the blast. A tilt-rod fuze has a number of advantages over pressure fuzes - it acts across the entire width of a vehicle, rather than just its tracks or tires. This allows it to attack the vehicle's belly and potentially cause a catastrophic kill. Additionally, tilt rod fuzes tend to be resistant to blast overpressure clearing methods, which can trigger most pressure fuzes. The main disadvantage is the visible rod mechanism, which may be negated by laying the mine in undergrowth. In any case, minefields containing anti-tank mines with tilt rods may also include other designs of mine which are entirely buried (e.g. the M19 anti-tank mine) plus various antipersonnel mines intended to hinder people removing mines.

Speed was born in Nelson County, Kentucky, and was a prominent attorney in Indiana with Benjamin Harrison. In 1889, he moved to Winfield, Kansas, and following the Run of '89 he established a law practice in Guthrie, Oklahoma Territory. His experience with the Cherokee Commission led now President Benjamin Harrison to appoint him United States Attorney for the territory (1890–1894). He served again for a short time in 1900 as the last territorial US Attorney before it was divided into districts. As US Attorney he prosecuted many of the outlaws running rampant in the territory and the land fraud cases that troubled the land openings. In 1901, following Territorial Governor William Miller Jenkins removal from office, President Theodore Roosevelt called Speed to Washington and offered him the governorship. Speed declined and Thompson Benton Ferguson was eventually appointed as a compromise. After statehood, Speed moved to Tulsa and opened a law firm. He died there in 1924. Early life Horace Speed was born to Thomas and Margaret (Hawkins) Speed on January 25, 1852, in Nelson County, Kentucky. He attended public school until he was 14 years old, then dropped out to work on his father's farm. When he was 17, he became a clerk for General John Parker Hawkins, assistant to the commissary general in Washington, D. C. He worked in that position for eight years, meanwhile studying law and was admitted to the bar. In 1877, he was hired by the law firm of Harrison, Haines and Miller, in Indianapolis, Indiana. The senior partner was General Benjamin Harrison, who would later be elected President of the United States. After one year at the firm, he resigned to start his own practice.Foreman, Grant. \\"Horace Speed.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Vol. 25, No. 1, June, 1935. Accessed November 29, 1935. Speed continued his solo law practice in Indiana until 1889, when he moved to Winfield, Kansas. He did not remain long, because that was the year of the first Oklahoma land run, which he intended to enter. On April 22, 1889, the day of the run, he established his law office in Guthrie, Indian Territory.Snodgrass, Mary Ellen. \\"Speed, Horace (1852-1924)\\" Settlers of theAmerican West. McFarland & Co. Jefferson N. C. (2015) p. 149. Available on Google Books. Accessed November 29, 2016. He had been appointed secretary for the Jerome Commission (a.k.a. Cherokee Commission), which negotiated the opening of the Cherokee Outlet with the Cherokee Nation. District Attorney After the Oklahoma Territory was created in 1890, Speed was appointed as he first U. S. District Attorney for the Territory. One of his major targets in this position was a group of grafters who had so corrupted the Land Office that it had lost the confidence of the public. Speed was able to establish that he was incorruptible and enabled the service to win back the public's confidence. In the so-called Cherokee Outlet cases, a group of cattlemen sought an injunction to restrain the Federal Government from removing their herds from the Cherokee Outlet. Speed, arguing for the government, resisted the move and got a court ruling establishing the right of the government to remove the cattle. Speed was appointed as a special prosecutor on April 11, 1898 to investigate the lynching of two Seminole Indian boys who had been accused of the rape and murder of a white woman and her baby. A mob of vigilantes had captured the boys, chained them to a tree and burned them to death. Speed's investigation identified the perpetrators and resulted in the arrest, conviction and sentencing of 45 white men for kidnapping and 45 for arson. It was the first time lynchers had been convicted in the Southwest. In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt offered to nominate Speed to become the sixth Governor of Oklahoma Territory. By then, Speed wanted to return to private life and declined the offer. Private life Speed continued to live in Guthrie, where he maintained his own law office until 1913. Then he moved to Tulsa, where he was a partner with Fred R.

It uses a tilt-rod fuze combined with a shaped charge to attack the belly of vehicles as they pass over the mine. It was originally designed in 1955, but is now obsolete. The mine consists of a case shaped like two truncated cones joined at the base. The MVK-2 tilt rod assembly is held to one side of the mine. The lower truncated cone contains the main charge, and dished metal charge liner. When a vehicle passes over the mine, the tilt rod is bent by 24 to 36 degrees, which allows retaining balls holding the striker to escape, which is driven by a spring into the MD-7M detonator. This then ignites a detonator cord, which carries the detonation wave into the main body of the mine and the DUM-2 detonator, fixed at the bottom of the main charge. The main charge is triggered, and the blast wave travels around a wave shaper, which improves the efficiency of the shaped charge. The resulting blast can penetrate between 60 and 110 millimeters of around depending on if the slightly less powerful TNT, or the more powerful TG-50 explosive is used. It is found in Afghanistan, Angola, Azerbaijan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Mozambique and Namibia.

In December 2016, Billboard ranked him as the 92nd-most successful dance artist of all-time. Early life, family and education Moran was raised in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York City, New York. He attended Brooklyn Technical High School. Career Moran began his career back in 1981, teaming with his friend Albert Cabrera as The Latin Rascals. Their edited versions of hit songs spliced together enjoyed major airplay on the New York City dance radio WKTU's mix show. The exposure led to a deal from Shakedown Studios which hired the duo to restructure popular hit radio songs into viable dance club hits. Shortly thereafter, they were contracted by Fever Records to write and produce a song for one of their new acts, The Cover Girls. The result was \\"Show Me\\", a song that became Moran's first Top 40 gold record. It also helped to usher in the freestyle era of music. This opened the doors for new artists including TKA, Sa-Fire (\\"Boy, I've Been Told\\"), and Lisette Melendez (\\"Together Forever\\"). Moran continues to produce music and has produced some major hits played in dance clubs such as \\"Put Your Hands Up\\", \\"Cafe Con Alegria\\", and \\"The Promise\\".

The American garrison was defeated by Japanese forces on 10 December, which resulted in an occupation until the Second Battle of Guam in 1944. Background Guam is the southernmost part of the Mariana Islands in the Pacific Ocean. It is the largest of the islands, with an area of 225 square miles. Guam's interior is rugged, with heavy tropical forests in the north of the island and wooded hills in the south. Much of the island's coastline is edged with coral reefs and cliffs, though beaches suitable for landing troops exist in the center of the west coast.Rottman (2004), p. 14 Guam has a tropical climate, though December forms part of the dry season.Rottman (2004), p. 13 The United States captured Guam from the Kingdom of Spain on 21 June 1898 during the Spanish–American War. The next year Spain sold the other islands in the Marianas chain to Germany.Rottman (2004), p. 12 The United States Navy established a facility near the village of Piti on Guam in 1899, and the United States Marine Corps (USMC) opened a barracks at Sumay in 1901. A naval coaling station was established on the island in 1905, and a battery of six guns was emplaced to strengthen Guam's defenses in 1909. A U.S. Navy captain served as both the Governor and commander of the naval base from 1899 onwards, though there were some elements of a civilian government on the island. During World War I, Japanese forces captured the German islands in the Marianas during October 1914 and established a garrison which was designated the South Seas, Defense Force. Japan gained a mandate over the islands from the League of Nations in December 1920, and they were administered by the South Seas Bureau which formed part of the Ministry of Overseas Affairs. Japanese colonists were permitted to settle in the Marianas, and by the late 1930s there were more colonists than natives in the Japanese islands.Rottman (2004), p. 12 In 1935 the Japanese Government banned westerners from entering its mandated islands in the Pacific, and in 1939 established the 4th Fleet to defend the region., Rottman (2004), pp. 12–13 While the United States considered increasing Guam's defenses during and after World War I, no action was taken other than to deploy a USMC seaplane unit to the island in 1921. The outcomes of the 1922 Washington Naval Conference included an agreement by both the United States and Japanese governments that they would not fortify the islands they administered in the western Pacific, including the Marianas. As a result, no further improvements were made to Guam's defenses during the 1920s and 1930s, and the island's coastal artillery battery was removed by 1930. The USMC seaplane unit also departed the next year. The Navy sought permission to build fortifications on the island in 1938, but this proposal was rejected. In 1941 Guam had a population of 23,394, most of whom lived in or within of the island's capital of Agana. The island had about of improved roads and Apra Harbor was considered the best in the Marianas, but did not have an airfield.Rottman (2004), p. 15 Prelude Japanese plans for the Pacific War included capturing Guam within the war's first days. From March 1941, Japanese aircraft flew photo reconnaissance sorties over the island.Rottman (2004), p. 18 Plans for the invasion of the island were completed in September of that year, and the South Seas Detachment was selected as the main unit responsible for this. The South Seas Detachment comprised the 144th Infantry Regiment and other units detached from the 55th Division and had a strength of 4,886 men. The South Seas Detachment was concentrated in Korea during November 1941 and, following a brief stay in Japan, sailed for Chichi-jima in the Bonin Islands late that month. The 370-man strong 5th Company of the 2nd Maizuru Special Naval Landing Force, which was based at Saipan in the Marianas, was also assigned to join the assault on Guam.Rottman (2004), p. 19 These units would be transported to Guam by nine transports escorted by the minelayer Tsugaru and four destroyers. The 6th Cruiser Division, which comprised four heavy cruisers, was also available to provide support if needed. The landing force and naval units were supported by the 18th Naval Air Corps, which was based at Saipan and equipped with obsolete floatplanes.Williford (2010), p. 208 The United States government did not believe that it would be possible or practical to defend Guam if it was attacked. The island was not seen as being useful in efforts to reinforce the Philippines, though it served as a refueling point for Pan Am flying boats and was one of the relay points for the Pacific Cable Company's telegraph cable which linked the Philippines to the US west coast.Williford (2010), p. 137 In 1941, the island was given a \\"Category F\\" defense rating; this ruled out the construction of new defenses and meant that, when war broke out, Guam's defenders were to destroy all facilities of military value and withdraw. Despite this and with only small arms available to them for their defense, the U.S. Marines stationed on the island and under command of Lt. Col., later, U.S. Marine Corps brigadier general William K. MacNulty fortified their positions and put up a valiant defense against the subsequent Japanese aerial assault of the island, while suffering losses and other casualties of near one third of their complement.Thomas Wilds, \\"The Japanese Seizure of Guam\\", Marine Corps Gazette, July, 1955 Despite the low priority accorded to Guam, some minor steps were also taken by other commands to improve Guam's defenses before war broke out. A contract for minor improvements to the military facilities on Guam was issued in April 1941, and work began the next month. The Guam Insular Force Guard, which was a locally manned militia force responsible for protecting the naval base, was also slightly expanded in May. On 17 October the dependents of the American military personnel on the island were evacuated to the United States by the transport , followed by more than 1,000 construction workers. On 23 October 1941, the US Navy's General Board provided Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox with a report on Guam's defenses which recommended against reinforcing the island due to the difficulties of defending it and the need to allocate resources to other priorities. The report argued in favor of continuing to improve Guam's harbor and seaplane facilities, however.Williford (2010), p. 138 At the outbreak of war on 8 December 1941 (local time), Guam was defended by small US Navy and USMC units as well as the Insular Force Guard. Captain George McMillin, who was also the island's governor and the overall commander of the garrison, was in charge of naval forces, Guam, which comprised 271 personnel and four nurses. This force was a subordinate unit of the Asiatic Fleet and most of its personnel were unarmed. Guam's guard ship, the , had sailed to the Philippines to pick up supplies and enable the crew to buy Christmas presents and was directed to remain there. The minesweeper was present at the island, along with the immobile oil depot ship ,Rottman (2004), p. 19 and two old yard patrol boats YP-16 and YP-17 which had been delivered aboard the USS Ramapo on 22 October 1940. Marine barracks, Sumay, had a strength of 145 men who were organised into a company armed with rifles and a small number of machine guns. The Insular Force Guard comprised 246 men, most of whom had received little training. The marines and Insular Force Guard were equipped with 170 M1903 Springfield rifles, 13 Lewis Guns and 15 Browning Automatic Rifles. The defenders did not have any mortars or artillery other than the guns on board Penguin. In addition to these military units, Guam's police force (the Guam Insular Patrol) had a strength of 80 men who were armed only with pistols. Battle At 04:45 on 8 December, the governor of the island, George McMillin, was informed about the attack on Pearl Harbor. At 08:27, Japanese land-based aircraft from Saipan attacked the marine barracks, Piti Navy Yard, Libugon radio station, Standard Oil Company, and the Pan American Hotel. During the air attack, the minesweeper USS , the largest navy vessel at the island, was sunk after shooting down at least one Japanese airplane. One officer was killed and several men wounded. The air raids all over Guam continued into the morning and afternoon before subsiding at 17:00. The next day, at 08:30, Japanese air attacks resumed, with no more than nine aircraft attacking at a time. The same targets as the previous day were attacked, and also the Government House in Agana and several villages. That evening, a Japanese invasion fleet of four heavy cruisers, four destroyers, two gunboats, six submarine chasers, two minesweepers and two destroyer tenders left Saipan for Guam. A mistake in their intelligence gathering had caused the Japanese to overcommit resources and attack Guam with disproportionate force.Again, Thomas Wilds, \\"The Japanese Seizure of Guam,\\" Marine Corps Gazette, July 1955 The Japanese landed about 400 troops of the 5th Defence Force from Saipan on Guam in the early morning of 10 December 1941, at Dungcas Beach, north of Agana. They attacked and quickly defeated the Insular Force Guard in Agana. They then advanced on Piti, moving toward Sumay and the marine barracks. The principal engagement took place on Agana's Plaza de Espana at 04:45 when a few marines and Insular Force guardsmen fought with the Japanese naval soldiers. After token post-invasion resistance, the Marines, on Governor McMillin's orders, surrendered at 05:45. Governor McMillin officially surrendered at 06:00. A few skirmishes took place all over the island before news of the surrender spread and the rest of the island forces laid down their arms. The American patrol boat YP-16 was scuttled by means of fire during the event and YP-17 was captured by Japanese naval forces. An American freighter was damaged by the Japanese. In the meantime the Japanese South Seas Detached Force (about 5,500 men) under the command of Major-General Tomitarō Horii made separate landings at Tumon Bay in the north, on the southwest coast near Merizo, and on the eastern shore of the island at Talofofo Bay. U.S. Marines' losses were five killed and 13 wounded (including the prior Japanese air assault of the island, the marines' losses were 13 dead and 37 woundedAgain, Thomas Wilds, \\"The Japanese Seizure of Guam\\", Marine Corps Gazette, July, 1955 (out of copyright) “With the island softened up by 2 days of bombing and strafing (and U.S. Marine machine gun and small arms counter fire, which, remarkably, actually, struck and disabled enemy aircraft), … His (Maj. Gen. Horii’s) assumption that the main resistance would be on Orote was well founded, for the Marines under Lt. Col William K. MacNulty, less 28 men on patrols at scattered points, took up positions at the butts of their rifle range near Sumay. The Insular Force Guard, however, formed in Agana Plaza, and Capt McMillin kept his headquarters at Government House in Agana. … The Hayashi Detachment became the pride of the (Japanese) Imperial Navy (after their seizure of Guam). But their pride lasted no longer than Japan's hold on Guam. When the Marines landed in 1944, the Hayashi Detachment, still on the island, was annihilated.”). The U.S. Navy lost eight killed while four of the Guam Insular Force Guards were killed and 22 others wounded. One Japanese naval soldier was killed and six wounded. Pfc Kauffman was killed by the Japanese after the surrender. Thirteen American civilians were killed by the Japanese during the battle. Six U.S. Navy seamen decided to evade capture from the Japanese rather than surrender; five were eventually captured by the Japanese and beheaded. George Ray Tweed, a U.S. Navy radioman and one of the original six men, managed to survive with the help of local Chamorros. They moved him from village to village, sometimes endangering their own families for his protection. The Japanese knew that an unknown American could not hide without some form of help. Consequently, Chamorro suspects were questioned, tortured, and beheaded. Despite the horrific abuses, Chamorros loyal to the United States protected Tweed. The radioman managed to covertly endure throughout the two and one-half years of occupation.War in the Pacific: Outbreak of the War See also *Battle of Guam (1944) *Pacific War Museum Notes References *Tony Palomo, \\"The Defense of Guam\\" (U.S. National Park Service) Access date: June 11, 2007. *Lodge, Major O.R.

It was originally called Westgrove and a professional building on 142 Street still uses that name. The neighbourhood is bounded on the east by 142 Street, on the west by 149 Street, on the north by 107 Avenue, and on the south by the MacKinnon Ravine. Stony Plain Road, a four-lane corridor linking downtown Edmonton and western suburban areas, bisects the neighbourhood. The community is represented by the Grovenor Community League, established in 1952, which maintains a community hall and outdoor rink located at 143 Street and 104 Avenue.  Demographics  In the City of Edmonton's 2012 municipal census, Grovenor had a population of living in dwellings, a 12% change from its 2009 population of .

It is located in Niagara Falls, Ontario, approximately 1/4 mile southwest of the Canadian Horseshoe Falls. In 1959, Oak Hall was bought by the Niagara Parks Commission and opened to the public in 1964. The estate's original 9-hole golf course was turned into a public course in 1966. The mansion has housed the offices of the Niagara Parks Commission since 1982, and several historic rooms are still open for public viewing. History Early history The Oak Hall grounds were originally part of the 'Clark Hill Islands' property (see Dufferin Islands). The property was sold off and split in 1898 and went through several ownership changes until Walter Schoellkopf (1882–1955) bought the property in 1916. The Schoellkopf family was from across the Niagara River in Niagara Falls, New York, and they were pioneers of hydraulic power development in the region. Sir Harry Oakes Eunice and Harry Oakes in Toronto in the 1930s In 1924, Harry Oakes and his wife, Eunice, bought the property from the Schoellkopfs. They hired the firm of Findlay and Foulis of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, to design and construct the mansion known as Oak Hall, which was completed by 1928 at a cost of ($ in dollars). Findlay and Foulis were also responsible for the Table Rock house in Niagara Falls, Ontario. During this time, Oakes became interested in golf and hired top golf course architect Stanley Thompson to build a nine-hole course for him on the estate. The course was completed in 1929 and was known as the \\"Sir Harry Oakes Private Course.\\"The Golf Course, by Geoffrey Cornish and Ronald Whitten, HarperCollins, 1981, . The Oakes family lived there until 1935, when Oakes left Canada (due to what he believed was over-taxation of his gold mines) and moved to the Bahamas. After Oakes' death in the Bahamas in 1943, Lady Oakes deeded the mansion to the Government of Canada to be used as a convalescent hospital for the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1952, when the government no longer needed the home, it was deeded back to the Oakes family. Shortly thereafter, Sir Sidney Oakes, the eldest son of Sir Harry Oakes, moved in and lived there with his wife for several years before moving back to the Bahamas. Niagara Parks Commission In 1959, the Niagara Parks Commission purchased Oak Hall and opened it to the public in 1964. Included in the purchase were unique furnishings, including dinner chairs used during a visit to the area in 1919 by Edward, Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII). In 1966, the commission opened the par-3 golf course on the estate to the public in an effort to attract more visitors to the grounds, with the golf course offices housed in the former garage. The commission sought to utilize the mansion more fully and moved its central office in 1982 from Queen Victoria Park to Oak Hall, where it remains today (the golf offices were moved to a gatehouse on the outer grounds). Though the majority of the rooms were converted to office space, three rooms remained in their historic state, with the Prince of Wales' dinner chairs still on display in the dining room. Today Oak Hall is open to the public. Visitors can view the Great Hall reception area, the dining room and the living room, as well as the commission's collection of art related to Niagara Falls. Currently, the commission's chairman and general manager have their offices on the east side of the building, where Sir Harry and Lady Oakes' bedrooms once were. The chapel, which was built so the family could have private worship services, is now the commission's information technology manager's office. Its peaked ceiling remains intact, and the view from the window includes views of the river and islands below.

It connects Sunset Boulevard in the heart of old Hollywood to the Hollywood Hills and North Hollywood in the San Fernando Valley. Description Cahuenga Boulevard begins at West Victory Boulevard in North Hollywood, crosses the Ventura Freeway and the Los Angeles River as it temporarily merges with Lankershim Boulevard before passing the Campo de Cahuenga and Universal City Metro station, then crosses the Hollywood Freeway. At this point an intersection is formed with Ventura Boulevard to the northwest and the continuation of Cahuenga Boulevard to the southeast. From here it parallels the Hollywood Freeway, passing The Baked Potato jazz club. and Universal Studios Hollywood (as Cahuenga Boulevard West), rising over the Cahuenga Pass connecting the San Fernando Valley to the Los Angeles Basin. Crossing the freeway once again on the Pilgrimage Bridge near The Hollywood Bowl, it continues (as North Cahuenga Boulevard) down to Sunset Boulevard and Melrose Avenue in downtown Hollywood. The boulevard is one of the principal routes to Universal Studios from downtown Los Angeles. Landmarks The Security Trust and Savings Building (1921), on the northeast corner of Cahuenga and Hollywood boulevards The southern part of Cahuenga Boulevard has been referred to as the \\"heart of old Hollywood\\". The intersection between Cahuenga and Hollywood Boulevards had been an important intersection from the early history of Los Angeles, and by 1915 it already had a trolley stop, a bank and a hardware store. Trolley cars were used on the boulevards until the 1960s when replaced with bus. Historically a number of important Los Angeles buildings were located on the road including the Technicolor building from the 1940s through the 1960s and the World Book and News building. The Owl Drug Company at 6380–84 Hollywood Boulevard on the south-west corner of Cahuenga Boulevard was a notable Californian company in the 1930s. At the intersection of Cahuenga Boulevard with Yucca Street, just off of Hollywood Boulevard was the Halifax Hotel, owned by world-famous classical pianist Van Cliburn. The Buster Keaton studio, originally belonging to Charlie Chaplin, was located on Lillian Way, one block east of the boulevard. The boulevard appears in several of his films. 1542 Cahuenga Boulevard, which formerly adjoined the Toribuchi Grocery at 1546, appeared in the 1921 Keaton film The Goat, which featured Keaton running from the police past them. It is now a strip mall. In another Keaton film, Three Ages (1923), Keaton is seen running from the police past the Los Angeles Police Department Hollywood building and former fire station, now the location of Edmonds Tower at 1629.

Notable clubs on Cahuenga include The Room, Hotel Café, Velvet Margarita, and many others. The Hotel Café, at 1623 1/2 N. Cahuenga Blvd, is owned by Marko Shafer and Maximillian Mamikunian and opened in 2000. The Baked Potato, one of the city's most prominent jazz clubs, is situated near the intersection with the Hollywood Freeway, and the Hollywood Theatre of Note is also on the boulevard.

A group of students from \\"Ginásio Leão XIII\\", at the time directed by professor Antilhon Ribeiro Soares, met to discuss the foundation of a sports society that would take the name of River Atlético Clube. However, the project was not put into practice, since its legalization did not take place in the competent sports bodies, nor was there any record of any activity in the years 1946 and 1947. The first historical record dates from February 15, 1948. That day was played the first game of the River against the Amarantino. River's first goal was scored in this game by Antônio Freire (Freirinho). The game was held in the city of Amarante-PI and the River won by 4x3. Almost a month later, on March 12, 1948, there was the so-called 'reorganization' of the club, led by Afrânio Messias Alves Nunes (River's most successful president - 11 titles).

Prior to the war, there were approximately 4,300 Estonian Jews. After the Soviet 1940 occupation about 10% of the Jewish population was deported to Siberia, along with other Estonians. About 75% of Estonian Jews, aware of the fate that awaited them from Nazi Germany, escaped to the Soviet Union; virtually all of those who remained (between 950 and 1,000 people) were killed by Einsatzgruppe A and local collaborators before the end of 1941. Roma people of Estonia were also murdered and enslaved by the Nazi occupiers and their collaborators. The Nazis and their allies also killed around 6,000 ethnic Estonians and 1,000 ethnic Russians who were accused of being communist sympathizers or the relatives of communist sympathizers. In addition around 15,000 Soviet prisoners-of-war and Jews from other parts of Europe were killed in Estonia during the German occupation. Jewish life pre-Holocaust Prior to World War II, Jewish life flourished with the level of cultural autonomy accorded being the most extensive in all of Europe, giving full control of education and other aspects of cultural life to the local Jewish population. In 1936, the British-based Jewish newspaper The Jewish Chronicle reported that \\"Estonia is the only country in Eastern Europe where neither the Government nor the people practice any discrimination against Jews and where Jews are left in peace and are allowed to lead a free and unmolested life and fashion it in accord with their national and cultural principles.\\" Murder of Jewish population Round-ups and killings of the remaining Jews began immediately as the first stage of Generalplan Ost which would require the \\"removal\\" of 50% of Estonians. Undertaken by the extermination squad Einsatzkommando (Sonderkommando) 1A under Martin Sandberger, part of Einsatzgruppe A led by Walter Stahlecker, who followed the arrival of the first German troops on July 7, 1941. Arrests and executions continued as the Germans, with the assistance of local collaborators, advanced through Estonia. Estonia became a part of the Reichskommissariat Ostland. A Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police) was established for internal security under the leadership of Ain-Ervin Mere in 1942. Estonia was declared Judenfrei quite early by the German occupation regime at the Wannsee Conference.Museum of Tolerance Multimedia Learning Center The Jews who had remained in Estonia (929 according to the most recent calculation) were killed. Fewer than a dozen Estonian Jews are known to have survived the war in Estonia. Map titled \\"Jewish Executions Carried Out by Einsatzgruppe A\\" from the Stahlecker's report. Marked \\"Secret Reich Matter,\\" the map shows the number of Jews shot in Ostland, and reads at the bottom: \\"the estimated number of Jews still on hand is 128,000\\". Estonia is marked as judenfrei.  German policy toward the Jews in Estonia  The Estonian state archives contain death certificates and lists of Jews shot dated July, August, and early September 1941. For example, the official death certificate of Rubin Teitelbaum, born in Tapa on January 17, 1907, states laconically in a form with item 7 already printed with only the date left blank: \\"7. By a decision of the Sicherheitspolizei on September 4, 1941, condemned to death, with the decision being carried out the same day in Tallinn.\\" Teitelbaum's crime was \\"being a Jew\\" and thus constituting a \\"threat to the public order\\". On September 11, 1941 an article entitled \\"Juuditäht seljal\\" – \\"A Jewish Star on the Back\\" appeared in the Estonian mass-circulation newspaper Postimees. It stated that Dr. Otto-Heinrich Drechsler, the High Commissioner of Ostland, had proclaimed ordinances in accordance with which all Jewish residents of Ostland from that day onward had to wear visible yellow six-pointed Star of David at least . in diameter on the left side of their chest and back. On the same day regulationsERA.F.R-89.N.1.S.1.L.2 issued by the Sicherheitspolizei were delivered to all local police departments proclaiming that the Nuremberg Laws were in force in Ostland, defining who is a Jew, and what Jews could and could not do. Jews were prohibited from changing their place of residence, walking along the sidewalk, using any means of transportation, going to theatres, museums, cinema, or school. The professions of lawyer, physician, notary, banker, or real estate agent were declared closed to Jews, as was the occupation of street hawker. The regulations also declared that the property and homes of Jewish residents were to be confiscated. The regulations emphasized that work to this ends was to be begun as soon as possible, and that lists of Jews, their addresses, and their property were to be completed by the police by September 20, 1941. These regulations also provided for the establishment of a concentration camp near the south-eastern Estonian city of Tartu. A later decision provided for the construction of a Jewish ghetto near the town of Harku, but this was never built, a small concentration camp being built there instead. The Estonian State Archives contain material pertinent to the cases of about 450 Estonian Jews. They were typically arrested either at home or in the street, taken to the local police station, and charged with the 'crime' of being Jews. They were either shot outright or sent to concentration camp and shot later. An Estonian woman, E. S. describes the arrest of her Jewish husband as follows:Quoted in Eugenia Gurin-Loov, Holocaust of Estonian Jews 1941, Eesti Juudi Kogukond, Tallinn 1994: pg. 224 Holocaust in Reichskommissariat Ostland (which included Estonia): a map Foreign Jews After the invasion of the Baltic States, it was the intention of the Nazi government to use the Baltic countries as their main area of mass genocide. Consequently, Jews from countries outside the Baltics were deported there to be killed.The Holocaust in the Baltics at University of Washington An estimated 10,000 Jews were killed in Estonia after having been deported to camps there from elsewhere in Eastern Europe. The Nazi regime also established 22 concentration camps in occupied Estonian territory for foreign Jews, where they would used as slave laborers. The largest, Vaivara concentration camp, served as a transit camp and processed 20,000 Jews from Latvia and the Lithuanian ghettos. Usually able-bodied men were selected to work in the oil shale mines in northeastern Estonia. Women, children, and old people were killed on arrival. At least two trainloads of Central European Jews were deported to Estonia and were killed on arrival at the Kalevi-Liiva site near Jägala concentration camp.  Murder of foreign Jews at Kalevi-Liiva  According to testimony of the survivors, at least two transports with about 2,100–2,150 Central European Jews, arrived at the railway station at Raasiku, one from Theresienstadt (Terezin) with Czechoslovakian Jews and one from Berlin with German citizens. Around 1,700–1,750 people were immediately taken to an execution site at the Kalevi-Liiva sand dunes and shot. About 450 people were selected for work at the Jägala concentration camp. Transport Be 1.9.1942 from Theresienstadt arrived at the Raasiku station on September 5, 1942, after a five-day trip.De dödsdömda vittnar (Transport Be 1.9.1942 ) According to testimony by Ralf Gerrets, one of the accused at the war crimes trials in 1961, eight busloads of Estonian auxiliary police had arrived from Tallinn. The selection process was supervised by Ain-Ervin Mere, chief of Security Police in Estonia; those transportees not selected for slave labor were sent by bus to a killing site near the camp. Later the police, in teams of 6 to 8 men, killed the Jews by machine gun fire. During later investigations, however, some guards of camp denied the participation of police and said that executions were done by camp personnel. On the first day, a total of 900 people were murdered in this way. Gerrets testifies that he had fired a pistol at a victim who was still making noises in the pile of bodies. The whole operation was directed by SS commanders Heinrich Bergmann and Julius Geese.Jägala laager ja juutide hukkamine Kalevi-Liival – Eesti Päevaleht March 30, 2006 Few witnesses pointed out Heinrich Bergmann as the key figure behind the extermination of Estonian gypsies. In the case of Be 1.9.1942, the only ones chosen for labor and to survive the war were a small group of young women who were taken through a series of concentration camps in Estonia, Poland and Germany to Bergen-Belsen, where they were liberated. Camp commandant Laak used the women as sex slaves, killing many after they had outlived their usefulness.Omakaitse omakohus – JERUUSALEMMA SÕNUMID A number of foreign witnesses were heard at the post-war trials in Soviet Estonia, including five women who had been transported on Be 1.9.1942 from Theresienstadt. > The accused Mere, Gerrets and Viik actively participated in crimes and mass > killings that were perpetrated by the Nazi invaders on the territory of the > Estonian SSR.

Estonian collaboration  The Germans recruited tens of thousands of native Estonians into the Waffen SS and the Wehrmacht. Formations of note in such forces were the Estonian Legion, the 3rd Estonian SS Volunteer Brigade, and the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian) among others. Units of the Eesti Omakaitse (Estonian Home Guard; approximately 1000 to 1200 men) were directly involved in criminal acts, taking part in the round-up of 200 Roma people and 950 Jews. Units of Estonian Auxiliary Police participated in the extermination of Jews in the Pskov region of Russia and provided guards for concentration camps for Jews and Soviet POWs in Jägala, Vaivara, Klooga, and Lagedi. The final acts of liquidating the camps, such as Klooga, which involved the mass-shooting of roughly 2,000 prisoners, were carried out by Estonian SS units belonging to the 20th SS Division and Schutzmannschaftsbataillon of the KdS. Survivors report that, during these last days before liberation, when Jewish slave labourers were visible, the Estonian population in part attempted to help the Jews by providing food and other types of assistance.\\"Birn, Ruth Bettina (2001), Collaboration with Nazi Germany in Eastern Europe: the Case of the Estonian Security Police .

Two were later executed, while the Soviet occupation authorities were unable to press charges against the other two due to the fact that they lived in exile.Estonia at Jewish Virtual Library There have been 7 known ethnic Estonians (Ralf Gerrets, Ain-Ervin Mere, Jaan Viik, Juhan Jüriste, Karl Linnas, Aleksander Laak and Ervin Viks) who have faced trials for crimes against humanity committed during the Nazi occupation in Estonia. The accused were charged with murdering up to 5,000 German and Czechoslovakian Jews and Romani people near the Kalevi-Liiva concentration camp in 1942–1943. Ain-Ervin Mere, commander of the Estonian Security Police (Group B of the Sicherheitspolizei) under the Estonian Self-Administration, was tried in absentia. Before the trial, Mere had been an active member of the Estonian community in England, contributing to Estonian language publications.Estonian State Archives of the Former Estonian KGB (State Security Committee) records relating to war crime investigations and trials in Estonia, 1940–1987 (manuscript RG-06.026) – United States Holocaust Memorial Museum – document available on-line through this query page using document id RG-06.026 – Also available at Axis History Forum – This list includes the evidence presented at the trial. It list as evidence several articles by Mere in Estonian language newspapers published in London At the time of the trial, however, he was being held in custody in England, having been accused of murder. He was never deported and died a free man in England in 1969. Ralf Gerrets, the deputy commandant at the Jägala camp. Jaan Viik, (Jan Wijk, Ian Viik), a guard at the Jägala labor camp, out of the hundreds of Estonian camp guards and police, was singled out for prosecution due to his particular brutality.Weiss-Wendt, Anton (2003).

Witnesses testified that he would throw small children into the air and shoot them. He did not deny the charge. A fourth accused, camp commandant Aleksander Laak (Alexander Laak), was discovered living in Canada, but committed suicide before he could be brought to trial. In January 1962, another trial was held in Tartu. Juhan Jüriste, Karl Linnas and Ervin Viks were accused of murdering 12,000 civilians in the Tartu concentration camp.  Number of victims  Soviet-Estonian era sources estimate the total number of Soviet citizens and foreigners to be murdered in Nazi-occupied Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic to be 125,000. The bulk of this number consists Jews from Central and Western Europe and Soviet prisoners-of-war killed or starved to death in prisoner-of-war camps on Estonian territory. The Estonian History Commission estimates the total number of victims to be roughly 35,000, consisting of the following groups: * 1000 Estonian Jews, * about 10,000 foreign Jews, * 1000 Estonian Roma, * 7000 other Estonians, * 15,000 Soviet POWs. The number of Estonian Jews killed is less than 1,000; the German Holocaust perpetrators Martin Sandberger and Walter Stahlecker cite the numbers 921 and 963 respectively. In 1994 Evgenia Goorin- Loov calculated the exact number to be 929. Modern memorials Holocaust memorial at the site of the former Klooga concentration camp, opened on July 24, 2005 Kiviõli Concentration Camp Holocaust Memorial, northeastern Estonia. Since the reestablishment of the Estonian independence, markers were put in place for the 60th anniversary of the mass executions that were carried out at the Lagedi, Vaivara and Klooga (Kalevi-Liiva) camps in September 1944. On February 5, 1945 in Berlin, Ain Mere founded the Eesti Vabadusliit together with SS-Obersturmbannführer Harald Riipalu.Veebruari sündmused He was sentenced to the capital punishment during the Holocaust trials in Soviet Estonia but was not extradited by Great Britain and died there in peace. In 2002 the Government of the Republic of Estonia decided to officially commemorate the Holocaust. In the same year, the Simon Wiesenthal Center had provided the Estonian government with information on alleged Estonian war criminals, all former members of the 36th Estonian Police Battalion. In August 2018 it was reported that the memorial at Kalevi-Liiva was defaced.https://news.err.ee/855579/holocaust-victim-memorials-vandalised-at- kalevi-liiva  Collaborators  *Ralf Gerrets *Juhan Jüriste *Friedrich KurgAndrei Hvostov, Jakobsoni komisjon Augeiase tallis *Aleksander Laak *Karl Linnas *Ain-Ervin Mere *Hjalmar Mäe *Jaan Viik *Ervin Viks  Organizations  *Einsatzgruppe A *Estonian Auxiliary Police *Omakaitse *Ordnungspolizei *Sonderkommando 1a *Sicherheitspolizei  Concentration camps   KZ- Stammlager  * KZ Vaivara ** Klooga  KZ-Außenlager  *KZ Aseri *KZ Auvere *KZ Erides *KZ Goldfields (Kohtla) *KZ Ilinurme *KZ Jewe *KZ Kerestowo (Karstala in Viru Ingria, now in Gatchinsky District) *KZ Kiviöli *KZ Kukruse *KZ Kunda *KZ Kuremaa *KZ Lagedi *KZ Klooga, Lodensee.

Heavily outnumbered, the Chilean detachment of 77 men under the command of Captain Ignacio Carrera Pinto was annihilated by a 1,300-strong Peruvian force, many of them armed with spears, commanded by Col. Juan Gasto and Ambrosio Salazar after a 27-hour fight in the small town of Concepción in the Peruvian Andes.  Background  After the defeat at Miraflores and the invasion of the Peruvian capital city, many Peruvian officers escaped to the mountains and organized resistance. Among these men was Col. Andres Caceres, who successfully gained the sympathies of the farmers who lived totally disconnected from the preceding campaigns. The Chilean occupation was directed by the recently appointed Admiral Patricio Lynch, who sent a division divided into several columns with the intention of sweeping the Andes and gaining control of the towns in the region. The first major force to be sent was a division under the command of Col Ambrosio Letelier, who was successful in his task, but committed abuses against the population. He was recalled to Lima and sent to Santiago to be court- martialed. The abuses perpetrated by Letelier's division generated discontent and hate of the invading troops, allowing Caceres to increase his troops easily. In Lima, the Battle of Sangra took place on June 26, 1881, at the Hacienda de Sangrar, where a Chilean company commanded by José Luis Araneda fought with Peruvian forces commanded by Manuel Encarnación Vento. In 1882, Col. Estanislao del Canto was sent to the Junin Department with orders to maintain control on the region and to find and eliminate Caceres forces. Del Canto's division had about 2,300 men and was formed from the \\"Tacna\\" 2nd Line, Lautaro and \\"Chacabuco\\" 6th Line Infantry battalions, one \\"Yungay Carabiners\\" Cav. Squadron, and one artillery brigade from the 1st Artillery Regt. At Pucara on February 5, Caceres's and del Canto's forces clashed. On the 22nd, Caceres defeated his fellow Peruvian Col. Arnaldo Panizo at Acuchimay, taking control of Panizo's army and increasing his own.  Peruvian situation   Ambrosio Salazar guerrillas  Ambrosio Salazar Márquez was sent by Cáceres to organize a guerrilla unit in Comas, but his attempt to organize was rejected by the rural farmers. Chileans sacked rural ranches in Huancayo, and the mayor of Comas asked Salazar to resume organizing. Salazar armed two columns of residents, one with 30 guns and 50 men. They achieved a victory in Sierra Lumi, where they acquired more weapons and support from the population. Salazar sent a request to Cáceres for military support. The guerrillas from Comas lacked weapons, the peasants being armed only with spears. The peasants arrested Salazar in early July 1882 on the arrival of two columns sent by Caceres to reorganize the guerrillas with orders to attack Concepción. Ambrosio Salazar commanded the columns Cazadores de Comas and Guerrilla Andamarca who accompanied them with reinforcements.  Caceres forces  The news of the Chilean situation reached Caceres, who saw an opportunity to destroy the entire division fighting them in their garrisons. He decided to launch a simultaneous attack on several Chilean garrisons in the Andes. Gasto, with Pucara Nº4 and America battalions, plus the Libres de Ayacucho columns, was to join the Salazar guerrillas (montoneras) at Comas and to march toward Concepcion. Meanwhile, Col. Maximo Tafur was sent to La Oroya, with the objective of destroying the bridge there and closing any escape route for del Canto. Caceres himself, with the rest of his troops would attack the 4th company of the \\"Santiago\\" 5th Line Battalion at Marcavalle.  Situation of the Chilean garrison Del Canto's division was scattered through the southern region of the Peruvian Andes, divided into small groups stationed in several towns and enduring a severe lack of supplies including food, clothes, shoes, and ammunition, and heavy casualties from disease and the cold of these heights. In fact, the most common causes of death in the Chilean division were typhus and frostbite. The Chilean high command was reasonably very concerned about the situation of the soldiers, and requested of the Chilean authorities permission to leave the mountains, but these requests fell on deaf ears. When the situation turned desperate, Col. del Canto himself traveled to Lima to request authorization to retreat. After the report of Dr. Jovino Novoa about the troops' situation, permission to retreat was granted. Captain Ignacio Carrera Pinto, Lieutenant Julio Montt Salamanca and Second Lieutenants Arturo Perez Canto and Luis Cruz Martinez in La Concepción After an initial success, the lack of supplies and medicines, combined with high mortality among Chilean lines owing to unknown illnesses and cold temperatures, forced Estanislao del Canto to retreat from the Andes to Lima. The plan was to evacuate the division while marshaling the scattered garrisons as the column left the mountains. The garrison posted at Concepcion was the 4th company of the \\"Chacabuco\\" 6th Line Battalion, consisting of 77 soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Ignacio Carrera Pinto. Unknown to him, he had been promoted to captain, but he would never receive the promotion. Along with the soldiers traveled two women, one of them pregnant and about to deliver. Eleven men were sick at the time of the battle. The garrison also lacked ammunition, having only one hundred rounds per soldier. Carrera Pinto was waiting for the retiring division in order to join it and continuing refolding from the Andes. Although no attack was expected, he maintained the garrison on alert status. He did not know that when Col. del Canto finally could leave his position at Huancayo, its south wing was defeated by Caceres' followers at Marcavalle, delaying again the advance of the Chilean troops towards Concepcion. Meanwhile, the montoneras of Ambrosio Salazar and the Peruvian regular forces of Juan Gasto were already gathered at Leon hill and waiting for the attack signal. By 14:00 of July 9, the Chilean sentries sounded the alarm announcing the presence of enemy troops. The Chileans could see on the surrounding hills the Peruvian troops and several hundred shouting farmers ready to invade the town. The Peruvian troops outnumbered the Chilean forces by 17 to 1.  Chilean battle plan  Since he was outnumbered, Carrera Pinto's plan was to fortify the garrison at the town central square, blocking its four corners, and to resist there until del Canto's arrival. He accordingly divided the troops into three groups to defend each of the entrances to the square, occupying the following positions: on the northern corner, Arturo Perez Canto with the first group; on the northwestern, Luis Cruz Martinez with another twenty soldiers; on the southeastern, Julio Montt Salamanca with twenty more. Carrera Pinto, with the remaining sixteen, occupied the southwestern corner. When the enemy overpowered these positions, the troops would retreat to the town's church.  The battle  Battle of La Concepción On July 8 Salazar's forces left Comas, arriving that night in San Antonio de Ocopa, where they made camp. There the Bishop Manuel Teodoro del Valle reported the movement of forces in Concepcion. On July 9 they marched from Santa Rosa Ocopa through Alayo, Quichuay and Lastay. In Concepcion, Salazar decided to attack with only the forces under his command, the columns Cazadores de Comas and Guerrilla de Andamarca. On the same day the guerrillas from Quichuay and Vilca, commanded by the Salazar brothers, and guerrillas from San Jeronimo under the command of Melchor Gonzales, all arrived to serve as reinforcements. The Chilean division of Del Canto, after leaving Huancayo, was attacked by Cáceres' Peruvian forces, delaying his return to Concepción. At 13:30 that Sunday, Del Canto received a note from Capt. Carrera Pinto reporting no problems in Concepción. At 14:30 Peruvian forces appeared on the tops of the hills of Piedra Parada and El Leon in Concepción. Peruvian forces began to descend toward the square: Ambrosio Salazar with the guerrillas in the south from El Leon and the soldiers of Juan Gasto from Piedra Parada, encircling the town. The Chilean forces mixed bayonet attacks with rifle fire. From one of the flanks, the peasants of Comas advanced towards their enemy. The Chilean soldiers, aligned in a double row formation, opened fire on the approaching forces. In a second attack, the Chileans received sniper fire from the roofs and windows of the surrounding buildings, causing seven casualties. Carrera Pinto tried a bayonet charge in order to break the siege and escape, but was wounded in his left arm, leaving him no choice but to fall back to the church and garrison his troops inside. Juan Gastó installed a command post to direct his forces and as a relief center for the wounded. The Peruvian attack continued, including sniper fire from roofs and windows, until all of the Chileans retreated to the center of the square, a very exposed position. All soldiers took defensive positions, including the wounded. At 19:00 the guerrillas of Orcotuna, commanded by Teodosio Lopez, and Mito, commanded by Aurelio Gutierres, arrived to reinforce the Peruvian troops. The Chilean lieutenant, aware of the desperate situation, sent three soldiers to connect with del Canto's division stationed at Huancayo and to inform them of the attack they were sustaining. All failed to escape Concepcion and were killed. In the dark of night, the Chilean forces attempted to leave Huancayo, but failed and returned to their position. Gasto sent a parliamentarian trying to convince Carrera Pinto to surrender, but his plea was refused when the latter sent him a reply letter. Drawing of the Battle of La Concepcion  Second attack and ending  Col. Juan Gastó reported to Ambrosio Salazar that he was withdrawing from Concepción, leaving to Salazar the task of taking the barracks. Adding to the attacking troops with eleven people with their own rifles was Dr. Tello Santiago Manrique, who joined the Peruvian troops that night. Ambrosio Salazar ordered Cipriano Camacachi and Pablo Bellido to spray with fuel the roofs of the convent to force out the Chileans, who returned fire from the windows of the building. The pregnant woman, a barmaid who was in labor, delivered a child. The Chileans largely exhausted their ammunition trying to repel this new attack. The Peruvians managed to set the church roof on fire. Carrera Pinto and the survivors tried to take refuge in a house adjacent to the church and to resist the Peruvians there. Although a soldier informed him of the Peruvian forces, he decided to stage yet another bayonet charge, saying: \\"Chileans do not surrender! Long live Chile!\\" He then led another bayonet charge with some soldiers, killing some guerrillas, and was killed by Peruvian riflemen. Salazar's guerrillas occupied the roofs and walls, attacking the Chileans in their last positions inside the church. The Chilean soldiers took their commanding officer's body and retreated to the burning church. Another attack from a horde of montoneros managed to penetrate the wall of the church but was repelled by another bayonet attack of some twelve Chilean soldiers led by 2nd Lieutenant Arturo Perez Canto. At 07:00 on July 10, guerrillas from Apata commanded by Andrés Avelino Ponce and spear-armed guerrillas from Paccha commanded by Andrés Bedoya Seijas arrived. The guerrillas opened fire on 2nd. Lt. Cruz Martinez and his troops. At 10:00 the Chileans were out of ammunition, and fire and smoke from their torches forced them to leave the church. At around 1100 on the morning of July 10, the Chilean garrison was reduced to only nine soldiers under the command of 2nd Lt. Luis Cruz Martinez (15 years old). Another attack caused another 4 dead on the Chilean side. Salazar asked the survivors to accept an honorable surrender. Cruz Martínez refused this latest offer of surrender, saying \\"For the fatherland, Chileans will never surrender!\\", after these words he ordered a final rifle barrage, and then led a bayonet charge with his remaining soldiers, all of whom were killed by Peruvian gunfire. Sadly, Gasto could not prevent the women and the newborn from being killed and dismembered by his montoneros and several soldiers. He left the town later in the day.  Aftermath  After a 27-hour battle, the Peruvian army had suffered more than 40 casualties (injured or killed) based on Ambrosio Salazar's official report. Also killed in the battle were 250 guerrillas. All of the Chilean soldiers were killed. At noon, the Chilean reinforcement column from Huancayo appeared. After it emerged that all 77 Chilean soldiers had died and that two women and a newborn had been killed and dismembered, a cavalry troop was sent with orders to kill every man between sixteen and fifty years old and to burn down the town of Concepcion. Col. Del Canto ordered that the hearts of the four officers: Captain Ignacio Carrera Pinto, Lieutenant Julio Montt, and Second Lieutenants Arturo Perez Canto and Luis Cruz Martinez, be extracted and sent in formalin to Santiago. The remains of the 77 Chileans were buried beside the church. Only in 1911, in one of Santiago, Chile's churches, were the hearts of the 4 officers killed permanently interred with a marker dedicated to the memory of all 77 killed in these two memorable days in Chilean history. This battle has a strong meaning for both countries. In Chile, every July 9 the Day of the National Flag (Spanish: Día de la Bandera) is celebrated, in remembrance of those who chose to die defending their flag rather than surrender. For the Peruvians, it is a milestone for their resistance in the face of invaders and a triumph, considering how poorly equipped they were. Concepcion is one of Peru's Heroic Cities and on the day of the Peruvian victory, in its honor a national youth Marching band competition is held here. Every July 9, all across Chile in ceremonies marking the final great Chilean military defeat, the battle is commemorated by the famous Juramento de la Bandera (Pledge to the Flag) recited throughout Chile in memory of this great and memorable battle, by the officers, warrant officers, non-commissioned officers, enlisted personnel, officer cadets and NCO cadets of the Chilean Army to the Flag of Chile, a solemn yearly tradition ever since it was first recited on July 9, 1939.

Originally organized in 1970, in 1978 the Georgia General Assembly and the Alabama Legislature passed identical legislation to establish an interstate compact for the operation of the Commission. Final approval of the compact came in October of that year when the same bill cleared the U.S. Congress and President Jimmy Carter signed it into law. The organization maintains offices in Eufaula, Alabama and LaGrange, Georgia. Alabama counties include Barbour, Chambers, Dale, Henry, Houston, Lee, and Russell; Georgia counties include Chattahoochee, Clay, Decatur, Early, Harris, Muscogee, Quitman, Randolph, Seminole, Stewart, and Troup. Presently the Commission is funded by both Alabama and Georgia. The HCC is the only tourism/preservation agency in the nation with official authority to cross state lines to pursue goals common to all counties involved. The HCC's numerous programs and projects educate residents and visitors about the unique cultural and natural heritage of the Chattahoochee Trace region and stimulate economic development through tourism. Activities include: • Grants – providing financial support to a range of innovative public history, education, publishing, tourism, and preservation projects • Scholarship, Publication and Education – the HCC has published over 30 books on regional history, has sponsored folklife and agritourism research projects, and produced a Heritage Education Unit for use in local schools • Historical Markers and Historic Site Interpretation – the HCC has erected over 300 historical markers commemorating important people, places, and events in regional history, and guided the creation of the renowned Chattahoochee Indian Heritage Center. It also operates the Hart House, a ca. 1850 home that serves as its Alabama office, as a house museum. • Heritage Tourism Advocacy – the HCC annually distributes thousands of brochures throughout the Southeast and nation promoting the attractions of the Chattahoochee Trace region of Georgia and Alabama, publishes a monthly calendar of events, and has sponsored familiarization tours for travel writers to bring national attention to the area • Community Service – the HCC is a partner in several praiseworthy charitable and community development initiatives The HCC ceased to exist in 2018. After failure to receive annual appropriations from the State of Alabama for eight fiscal years, the HCC’s Board of Directors voted to dissolve the organization.

The company was formerly known as VA Research, VA Linux Systems, VA Software, and SourceForge, Inc.. History VA Research VA Research was founded in November 1993 by Stanford University graduate student Larry Augustin and James Vera. Augustin was a Stanford colleague of Jerry Yang and David Filo, the founders of Yahoo!. VA Research was one of the first vendors to build and sell personal computer systems installed with the Linux operating system, as an alternative to more expensive Unix workstations that were available at the time. During its initial years of operation, the business was profitable and grew quickly, with over $100 million in sales and a 10% profit margin in 1998. It was the largest vendor of pre-installed Linux computers, with approximately 20% of the Linux hardware market. In October 1998, the company received investments of $5.4 million from Intel and Sequoia Capital. VA Linux Servers In March and April 1999, VA Research purchased Enlightenment Solutions, marketing company Electric Lichen L.L.C., and VA's top competitor, Linux Hardware Solutions. That year, VA Research also won a business-plan competition for the right to operate the linux.com domain. In May 1999, VA created a Linux Labs division, hiring former linux.com domain holder and programmer Fred van Kempen, and programmers Jon \\"maddog\\" Hall, Geoff \\"Mandrake\\" Harrison, Jeremy Allison, Richard Morrell (who would later create Smoothwall as a project at VA Linux) and San \\"nettwerk\\" Mehat. In the summer of 1999, programmers Tony Guntharp, Uriah Welcome, Tim Perdue and Drew Streib began designing and developing SourceForge. SourceForge was released to the public at Comdex on November 17, 1999. VA began porting Linux to the new IA-64 processor architecture in earnest. Intel and Sequoia, along with Silicon Graphics and other investors, added an additional $25 million investment in June 1999. Initial public offering LNUX stock price (9 December 1999 through 9 December 2000) The company's largest customers included Akamai Technologies and eToys. The company changed its name to VA Linux Systems. On December 9, 1999, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. The company raised $132 million, offering shares at $30/share, but the shares opened for trading at $299/share, before closing at $239.25/share, or 698% above the IPO price, breaking a record for the largest first day gain. Larry Augustin, the 38-year old founder and CEO of the company, became a billionaire on paper and a 26-year old web developer at the company said she was worth $10 million on paper. By August 2000, the shares were trading at $40 each and only 24 mutual funds held the stock. On December 8, 2000, one year later, after the bursting of the dot com bubble, shares traded at $8.49/share. In January 2001, the stock traded at $7.13/share. Acquisition of Andover.net On February 3, 2000, the company announced that it was acquiring Andover.net for $800 million, a month after it became a public company. This acquisition gave VA Linux popular online media properties such as Slashdot, Andover News Network, Freshmeat, NewsForge (became a mirror of linux.com in 2007, mirrors geeknet.com since 2010), linux.com, ThinkGeek, and a variety of online software development resources. With this acquisition came a stable of writers such as Rob Malda, Robin Miller (Roblimo), Jack Bryar, Rod Amis, Jon Katz, and \\"CowboyNeal\\". The acquisition eventually allowed the company to shift its business model from Linux-based product sales to specialty media and software development support. Japanese partnership In September 2000, in partnership with Sumitomo Corporation, the company created a Japanese subsidiary, VA Linux Systems Japan KK, to promote Linux systems in Japan. Sales growth The company's sales grew to $17.7 million in 1999, up from $5.5 million in fiscal 1998. In fiscal 2000, the company's sales were $120.3 million. VA Software By 2001, VA Linux's original equipment and systems business model encountered stiff competition from other hardware vendors, such as Dell, that now offered Linux as a pre- installed operating system. On June 26, 2001, VA Linux decided that it would leave the systems-hardware business and focus on software development. During the summer of 2001, all 153 of the hardware-focused employees were dismissed as a result of this shift in the company's business model. On December 6, 2001, the company formally changed its name to VA Software, recognizing that the majority of the business was now software development and specialty news and information services. However, the company's Japanese subsidiary still uses the name \\"VA Linux Systems Japan K.K.\\" On January 2, 2002, the company's stock price plunged 42% after an earnings warning. SourceForge & OSDN Sourceforge Inc. logo In December 2003, VA Software marketed a proprietary SourceForge Enterprise Edition, re-written in Java for offshore outsourcing software development. By April 2004, the company focused on SourceForge, an online software application, and OSDN, a group of websites catering to people in the information technology and software development industries, which was renamed to Open Source Technology Group. At that time, the stock was trading at $1.94/share. In January 2006, VA Software sold Animation Factory to Jupitermedia Corporation. On April 24, 2007, the company sold SourceForge Enterprise Edition to CollabNet. On May 24, 2007, VA Software changed its name to SourceForge Inc. and merged with OSTG. On January 5, 2009, Scott Kauffman was appointed President and CEO of SourceForge, Inc. Geeknet In November 2009, SourceForge, Inc. changed its name to Geeknet, Inc. Geeknet President and CEO Scott Kauffman resigned on August 4, 2010 and was replaced by Executive Chairman Kenneth Langone and the company changed its ticker symbol to GKNT. On August 10, 2010 Jason Baird, the Company’s Chief Operations Officer, and Michael Rudolph, the Company’s Chief Marketing Officer resigned, both effective 31 August 2010. Jay Seirmarco, the Company’s Chief Technology Officer also resigned, effective September 30, 2010. Effective January 31, 2011, Geeknet appointed Matthew C. Blank, former CEO and Chairman of Showtime Networks as a member of its board of directors. Later in 2011, the company renamed its Freshmeat website to Freecode. In September 2012, Slashdot, SourceForge, and Freecode were sold to Dice Holdings for $20 million, leaving ThinkGeek as the sole property of Geeknet. On May 26, 2015, it was announced that pop culture-oriented retailer Hot Topic had made an offer to acquire Geeknet for $17.50 per-share, valuing the company at $122 million. However, on May 29, 2015, it was revealed that an unspecified company had made a counter- offer of $20 per-share; Hot Topic was given until June 1, 2015 to exceed this new offer. On June 2, 2015, it was announced that video game retail chain GameStop would acquire Geeknet for $140 million, paying $20 per share. The deal closed on July 17, 2015.

As of May 2019, the party had 11 members in the 111-seat National Parliament of Papua New Guinea, and was part of the Alliance Accord for Change as part of the Opposition to the O'Neill led government for Papua New Guinea's 10th Parliament.  History  It was founded in 1995 after the dissolution of the Melanesian Alliance Party members John Momis, Bernard Narokobi who merged with Moi Avei, Bart Philemon and Masket Iangalio, who then invited Sir Michael Somare to lead them to the 1997 elections after he had been sacked as leader of the Pangu Party. National Alliance took 19 of 109 seats in parliament at the 2002 election, making it the largest single party, and as such the party was invited to form the government. The National Alliance-led government of 2002-2007 was the first government since independence in 1975 to survive a full five-year term - all previous governments had fallen to votes of no confidence. In 2006, party co-founder Bart Philemon attempted to depose Somare as party leader, but this challenge was unsuccessful and Philemon went to the opposition benches, remaining there as leader of the New Generation Party even after Somare’s victory in the elections. At the 2007 General Election, the party increased its representation, gaining 27 seats and remaining by far the largest party. Michael Somare was easily confirmed by Parliament for another term as prime minister, as several parties joined a coalition with the National Alliance, and 13 independents announced their decision to join the National Alliance party, bringing its representation to 40 members. In August 2011, the NAP-led Somare government was brought down in a parliamentary motion of no confidence (while Somare was recovering from surgery in hospital), leading to a split in the party, between members who remained loyal to Somare, and others who joined Peter O'Neill's new government. In October, it was reported simultaneously that the party was expelling the latter, and that the latter's leader, Don Polye, had assumed leadership of the party. What had happened was a split, with two opposing factions both claiming to constitute the party. In January 2012, Polye purported to de-register the NAP, despite the existence of a rival faction. The members of his faction formed a new party, the Triumph Heritage Empowerment Rural Party (\\"T.H.E. Party\\"), ahead of the June 2012 general election. Polye stated: \\"Somare is gone, and so will his party. NA will be history\\". The remaining faction of the party continue to recognise Michael Somare's leadership.

It was founded in 2003 as the \\"Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia and Montenegro\\" and reduced to the territory of Serbia in 2013. In 2018, it was elevated to an eparchy. Since 2003, it is headed by bishop Đura Džudžar. The Eparchy is a part of the Greek Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia, together with the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Križevci in Croatia. In terms of jurisdiction, the Eparchy is exempt and directly subjected to the Holy See. There are no ecclesiastical provinces for it to belong to in the Greek Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia, which lacks a Metropolitan of its own, since the only other jurisdiction, the Eparchy of Križevci, is suffragan to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb. The eparchy mostly serves a group of Rusyn Greek Catholics in the region of Vojvodina.  Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia and Montenegro (2003–2013)  Until 2001, the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Križevci had full jurisdiction over all Eastern Catholics of the Byzantine Rite throughout the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia, including all of its successor states: Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and North Macedonia. After the formation of independent successor states from what had been Yugoslavia, the process of administrative reorganization was initiated. In 2001, a separate Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Macedonia was formed for Eastern Catholics of the Byzantine Rite in neighboring North Macedonia. It was fully separated from the Eparchy of Križevci and directly subjected to the Holy See.Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 93 (2001), p. 339. In 2003, a new Apostolic Exarchate was created for Catholics of the Byzantine Rite in Serbia and Montenegro, the Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia and Montenegro. Its first and only exarch was bishop Đura Džudžar, who was appointed on August 28 (2003), with residence in Ruski Krstur. This exarchate remained in association with the Eparchy of Križevci. In 2004, the Apostolic Exarchate for Serbia and Montenegro had 26 parishes with 22,934 faithful and 18 priests, and in 2009 it had 21 parishes with 22,369 faithful and 18 priests.  Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia (2013–2018)  On 19 January 2013, all Greek Catholics in Montenegro were entrusted to the local Latin bishops, so the jurisdiction of the Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia and Montenegro was reduced to just Serbia.Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 105 (2013), p. 187. Bishop Đura Džudžar remained in his post as exarch. The Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia is still associated with the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Križevci as part of the Greek Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia. The Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia practices liturgy in the Slavonic form of Byzantine Rite and uses the Old Church Slavonic language and the Cyrillic alphabet. Adherents of the Eastern Catholic Byzantine Rite in Serbia are mainly Rusyns, . In 2016, the Apostolic Exarchate for Serbia had 21 parishes with 21,845 faithful and 21 priests.

BRG Sports, owner of Riddell football helmets, sold the Bell, Giro, C-Preme, and Blackburn brands to Vista in 2016. History Bell motorcycle helmet The company started in 1923 as Bell Auto Parts, named for its location in Bell, California. Roy Richter began working for Bell Auto Parts in 1933, and, in 1945, purchased the store for $1,000. He produced its first race car helmets in 1954. The Bell Helmet Company was established as a division of his Bell Auto Parts store in 1956. Bell introduced its Star model, the first full-face motorcycle helmet on the market, in 1968. In 1971, Bell produced the first full-face off-road motorcycle helmet. Bell made its first production helmet in 1954. It was the result of months of research and development. Richter, with the help of veteran naval pilot Frank Heacox, reverse engineered numerous helmets, including some used in military aviation. Heacox played a key role in developing Bell Helmet's first products, most importantly by using the helmets himself, both in races and on the street. These experiences with the prototypes led to many useful suggestions. That first helmet, named the Bell 500, featured a polyurethane foam liner inside a hand-laminated fiberglass outer shell. Laminating and polishing helmets by hand was relatively expensive but Richter believed it resulted in a stronger helmet. Several members of the famous Bill Stroppe Lincoln Team wore the Bell 500 in the Carrera Pan-American Road Race in 1954. A Bell helmet was used in the Indianapolis 500 for the first time by Cal Niday in 1955. Niday crashed during lap 177 of the race and suffered several major injuries. Despite suffering a skull fracture, Nidal credited the helmet for preventing even more serious injury. By 1956, helmet sales were far above projections. This resulted in the formation of the Bell Helmet Company as a subsidiary of Bell Auto Parts. The helmet operation employed at least four people working full-time producing helmets in a facility next door to the original Bell Auto Parts location. In 1980, the company merged with football helmet maker Riddell to form Bell-Riddell. The Bell-Riddell motorcycle division was sold in 1991. It became Bell Helmets. The remaining company was re-named Bell Sports. In 1999, the auto racing division was sold and split into two separate companies called Bell Racing Company (North America) and Bell Racing Europe (Europe, Asia and Africa). Bell Sports reacquired Bell Helmets in 2002, creating Bell Powersports. In 2005, it reacquired Bell Racing Company, and was itself merged into Easton-Bell Sports in 2006. Vista Outdoor acquired the company in 2016. Products The Bell Star MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) is the entry-level model of the Bell Star line of motorcycle helmets. It is made using a slip- plane design and a foam EPS liner. The EPS liner is designed to deal with main impact forces while the MIPS helps prevent brain injuries such as concussions by reducing rotational forces. Relationship to Bell Racing Bell Racing USA and Bell Racing Europe, are independent companies that use the Bell trademark under license.

Released late that year, the disc became a major hit in early 1963, reaching number 5 on the U.S. pop singles chart and number 4 on the U.S. R&B; singles chart. In the UK it was a top ten success for singer Kenny Lynch, whose version was also released in 1962. Content In addition to the hit appeal of the \\"second Drifters\\" lineup, \\"Up on the Roof\\" epitomized the urban romantic dream as presented by New York City Brill Building writers: Personnel *Tommy Evans, Rudy Lewis, Gene Pearson, Charlie Thomas – vocals *Don Arnone, Bob Bushnell, Al Casamenti – guitars *Ernie Hayes, Carole King – pianos *George Duvivier – double bass *Gary Chester – drums *George Devens, Bobby Rosengarden – percussion *Jimmy Nottingham, Jimmy Sedler – trumpets *Jimmy Cleveland, Frank Sarraco – trombones Background Gerry Goffin would cite \\"Up on the Roof\\" as his all-time favorite of the lyrics he'd written. After Carole King suggested that he write lyrics for the tune which had occurred to her while she was out driving, with King suggesting \\"My Secret Place\\" as the title, Goffin kept King's suggested focus of a haven, modifying it with his enthusiasm for the movie musical West Side Story which contained several striking scenes set on the rooftops of Upper West Side tenements. Reception and legacy The 1980 Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll described \\"Up on the Roof\\" as \\"in every way a remarkable pop song for 1962,\\" and in particular said of the above lyric, \\"From the internal rhyme of 'stairs' and 'cares' to the image of ascending from the street to the stars by way of an apartment staircase, it's first-rate, sophisticated writing.\\" The melodic title riff was used in the Drifters version of \\"Under the Boardwalk\\", which is heard before the chorus of the song. In April 2010, The Drifters' \\"Up on the Roof\\" was named number 114 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. It is one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. Other recordings In the UK the Drifters' version of \\"Up on the Roof\\" failed to reach the Top 50, being trumped by two local cover versions, sung by, respectively, Julie Grant and Kenny Lynch. The Kenny Lynch version, which largely replicated the Drifters' original, was the more successful, reaching number 10 in the UK. The Julie Grant version, which reached number 33 in the UK, reinvented the song as a Merseybeat number; its producer Tony Hatch would later be inspired to write Petula Clark's iconic hit \\"Downtown\\", which was originally envisioned as being in the style of the Drifters, with whom Hatch hoped to place it. Other early recordings of the song were made by Little Eva (album LLLLLoco-Motion/ 1962) and Jimmy Justice (album Smash Hits From Jimmy Justice/ 1963). Also Richard Anthony wrote French lyrics for the song, which he recorded as \\"Sur le toit\\" for his 1963 EP entitled En Écoutant La Pluie. New Jersey-based garage band the Sidekicks remade \\"Up on the Roof\\" to serve as B-side for their 1966 regional hit \\"Suspicions\\" (number 55), with the track being included on the band's album Fifi the Flea. Another garage band the Cryan' Shames remade \\"Up on the Roof\\" for their 1967 album A Scratch in the Sky; released as a single, the track reached number 85 nationally in the spring of 1968 largely on the strength of local success in the band's hometown of Chicago. Laura Nyro recorded \\"Up on the Roof\\" for her 1970 album Christmas and the Beads of Sweat and a single, affording Nyro her sole Hot 100 appearance with a number 92 peak. Nyro's version slows down the song's tempo and also omits the lyrics sung to the first of the original's three bridge sections. Also in 1970, Carole King herself recorded \\"Up on the Roof\\" for her solo recording debut Writer, from which it was issued as a single. James Taylor, who had played guitar on Carole King's cover of \\"Up on the Roof\\" and who had dueted with King on the song at her Carnegie Hall concert of June 18, 1971, remade \\"Up on the Roof\\" for his 1979 album release Flag. Issued as the album's lead single, Taylor's version of \\"Up on the Roof\\" peaked at number 28 in July 1979. Although Taylor would reach number 11 in 1981 with his duet with J.D. Souther entitled \\"Her Town Too\\", \\"Up on the Roof\\" remains Taylor's final Top 40 hit as a soloist to date. Rearranged around Taylor's trademark acoustic guitar playing and vocal accents and interjections, his version of \\"Up on the Roof\\" became a concert staple, often with a star-lit urban dreamscape presented behind the stage halfway through the number as his band played unison ascending notes to echo the song's theme. It was included on his 1993 live album (LIVE) and his 2000 Greatest Hits Volume 2 compilation and was played at The Concert For New York City following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, where he introduced it as representing his and the writers' positive feelings for the city. Taylor and King performed the song together, switching back and forth from one's arrangement to the other, as the first encore during their 2010 Troubadour Reunion Tour shows. \\"Up on the Roof\\" had its most successful UK incarnation via a 1995 remake by Robson & Jerome released as a double A-side coupled with their remake of \\"I Believe.\\" Its arrangement hewed close to The Drifters' original; the accompanying music video showed the duo cavorting atop a midtown Manhattan skyscraper. The single reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart and has sold 890,000 copies in the UK. In addition, \\"I Believe\\"/ \\"Up on the Roof\\" reached number 3 in Ireland and number 45 in the Netherlands. \\"Up on the Roof\\" has also been recorded by Anita Harris (album Cuddly Toy/ 1969), Kenny Rankin (album Family/ 1969), Dawn (album Candida/ 1970), the Lettermen (album Reflections/ 1970), Ike and Tina Turner (album Let Me Touch Your Mind/ 1973), the Grass Roots (album The Grass Roots/ 1975), Viola Wills (album If You Could Read My Mind/ 1980), the Nylons (album The Nylons / 1983), the Cover Girls (album We Can't Go Wrong/ 1989), Neil Diamond (album Up On The Roof: Songs From The Brill Building/ 1993), Heather MacRae (album I Choose Love/ 2003), Peter Cincotti (album On the Moon/ 2004), Tuck & Patti (album A Gift of Love/ 2004), Marcia Hines (album Marcia Sings Tapestry), Frank Ifield, Billy Joe Royal, and II D Extreme on their self titled debut in 1993 and reaching number 13 on the R&B; Billboard music chart. Also Viola Wills' disco remake of the song appeared on Belgium's Dutch charts reaching number 23 in September 1980. \\"Up on the Roof\\" is still performed by Rockapella at many of their concerts and appears on the live album In Concert (2001). Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band covered the song live in 1975 during the initial Born to Run Tour.

He was, during the reigns of Louis II, Carloman, Charles III, and Berengar I, the most important power-broker in Emilia.MacLean, 95. Wibod was a frequent ambassador for Louis II after 860. He and a count named Bernard were the delegates of Louis II who, along with two suburbicarian bishops and a cardinal priest of Pope Hadrian II, formed an embassy to Louis the German at Aachen in October 870.Reuter, 64 n. 13 (AF, a. 870). This embassy brought letters confirming Hadrian's support of Louis in the conflict surrounding the succession to Lotharingia and the consecration of Willibert as Archbishop of Cologne. Wibod acted as an ambassador for Louis II and Engelberga again in 872.MacLean, 183. Wibod was the first recipient Italian bishop of an extension of his saecular authority of districtio (defence) beyond his city's walls, from Carloman.MacLean, 91-92 and n50. The extension of temporal episcopal authority in the civitates (cities) and their comitati (counties) became a trend in the 10th century. Wibod was also a recipient of Charles' largess. Charles granted Wibod land around Susinate and Vigonzone.MacLean, 94 and n64, indicates that the land near Susinate was granted to the church of Fontana Broccola in the reign of Berengar I. These lands probably served as country homes for the bishop when conferring with Charles while the latter was breaking from royal duties in Pavia. Wibod was the \\"highest counsellor\\" or consiliarius regis of Charles.MacLean, 183. His influence and power in Italy far exceeded that of the king's favourite and chancellor, Liutward of Vercelli.MacLean, 184. He consequently attended the West Frankish coronation and imperial assembly at Grand on 20 May 885.MacLean, 126 and 183. His presence in France is attested by the fact that in June, probably on his return journey, he issued a charter at Entrepy. During the contests for the Italian throne following Charles' death in 888, Wibod preferred the German and German-supported candidates over the French ones. He consistently backed Berengar against the Guideschi claimants, but he was won over to the French side by the entreaties of Anselm II, Archbishop of Milan.Wickham. Sources *Wickham, Chris.

The AEAO is supported by a battle staff of approximately 20 people, with another dozen responsible for the operation of the aircraft systems. The name Looking Glass, which is another name for a mirror, was chosen for the Airborne Command Post because the mission operates in parallel with the underground command post at Offutt Air Force Base.E-6B Airborne Command Post History The code name \\"Looking Glass\\" came from the aircraft's ability to \\"mirror\\" the command and control functions of the underground command post at Strategic Air Command headquarters. Early Looking Glass battle staff picture Gen. Richard A. Ellis, CINCSAC, in battle staff compartment Looking Glass battle staff The SAC Airborne Command Post or \\"Looking Glass\\" was initiated by the U.S. Air Force's Strategic Air Command in 1961 and operated by the 34th Air Refueling Squadron, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. In August 1966 the mission transferred to the 38th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, the 2nd Airborne Command and Control Squadron in April 1970, to the 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron in July 1994, and to the USSTRATCOM's Strategic Communications Wing One in October 1998.[Hopkins III, Robert S. 1997.

Looking Glass mirrors ground-based command, control, and communications (C3 or C³) located at the USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) at Offutt Air Force Base.USSTRATCOM ABNCP Fact Sheet The EC-135 Looking Glass aircraft were equipped with the Airborne Launch Control System, capable of transmitting launch commands to U.S. ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in the event that the ground launch control centers were rendered inoperable.USSTRATCOM ABNCP Fact SheetLGM-30G Fact SheetALCS Article, page 13 The Looking Glass was also designed to help ensure COG, continuity and reconstitution of the US government in the event of a nuclear attack on North America. Although the two types of aircraft are distinct, the Doomsday Plane nickname is also frequently associated with the Boeing E-4 \\"Nightwatch\\" Advanced Airborne Command Post mission and aircraft. The Looking Glass was the anchor in what was known as the World Wide Airborne Command Post (WWABNCP) network. This network of specially equipped EC-135 aircraft would launch from ground alert status and establish air-to-air wireless network connections in the event of a U.S. national emergency. Members of the WWABNCP network included: #Operation Silk Purse for the Commander in Chief, U.S. European Command (USCINCEUR), based at RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom (callsign Seabell); #Operation \\"Scope Light\\" for the Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Command (CINCLANT), based at Langley AFB, VA; #Operation \\"Blue Eagle\\" for the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Command (USCINCPAC), based at Hickam AFB, HI; and #Operation \\"Nightwatch\\" which supported the President of the United States and were based at Andrews AFB, Maryland. In the early 1970s the E-4A aircraft replaced the EC-135Js on this mission.[Hopkins III, Robert S. 1997. Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker: More Than Just a Tanker. Leicester, England: Midland Publishing Limited, p. 116] The Eastern Auxiliary (EAST Aux) and Western Auxiliary (West Aux) Command Posts were also part of the WWABNCP (\\"wah-bin-cop\\") network and were capable of assuming responsibility for Looking Glass as the anchor. The West Aux 906th Air Refueling Squadron was based at Minot AFB, North Dakota, and moved to the 4th Airborne Command and Control Squadron at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota, in April 1970 and the East Aux mission 301st Air Refueling Squadron was based at Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, and moved to the 3rd Airborne Command & Control Squadron at Grissom AFB, Indiana, in April 1970. After 1975, East Aux was assumed from the Looking Glass backup ground alert aircraft launched from Offutt AFB. In June 1992, United States Strategic Command took over the Looking Glass mission from the Strategic Air Command, as SAC was disbanded and Strategic Command assumed the nuclear deterrence mission.[Hopkins III, Robert S. 1997.

Leicester, England: Midland Publishing Limited, p. 116-117] Current status On October 1, 1998 the United States Navy fleet of E-6Bs replaced the EC-135C in performing the \\"Looking Glass\\" mission, previously carried out for 37 years by the U.S. Air Force. Unlike the original Looking Glass aircraft, the E-6Bs are modified Boeing 707 aircraft, not the military- only KC-135. The E-6B provides the National Command Authority with the same capability as the EC-135 fleet to control the nation's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, nuclear-capable bombers and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM).USSTRATCOM ABNCP Fact Sheet With the assumption of this mission, a USSTRATCOM battle staff now flies with the TACAMO crew.TACAMO - Take Charge And Move Out USSTRATCOM ABNCP Fact Sheet If the USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) is unable to function in its role, the E-6B Looking Glass can assume command of all U.S. nuclear-capable forces.

In addition to being able to direct the launch of ICBMs using the Airborne Launch Control System, the E-6B can communicate Emergency Action Messages (EAM) to nuclear submarines running at depth by extending a two and a half-mile-long trailing wire antenna (TWA) for use with the Survivable Low Frequency Communications System (SLFCS), as the EC-135C could.USSTRATCOM ABNCP Fact Sheet There was some speculation that the \\"mystery plane\\" seen flying over the White House on September 11, 2001, was some newer incarnation of Looking Glass. However, as indicated by retired Major General Donald Shepperd, speaking on CNN on September 12, 2007, the plane circling the White House on 9/11 resembled an E-4B which was likely launched from Nightwatch ground alert at Andrews Air Force Base.

It supports a classic REXX syntax, with no reserved keywords, along with considerable additions to support object-oriented programming in a manner compatible with Java's object model, yet can be used as both a compiled and an interpreted language, with an option of using only data types native to the JVM or the NetRexx runtime package. The latter offers the standard Rexx data type that combines string processing with unlimited precision decimal arithmetic. Integration with the JVM platform is tight, and all existing Java class libraries can be used unchanged and without special setup; at the same time, a Java programmer can opt to just use the Rexx class from the runtime package for improved string handling in Java syntax source programs. NetRexx is free to download from the Rexx Language Association. IBM announced the transfer of NetRexx 3.00 source code to the Rexx Language Association (RexxLA) on June 8, 2011.  History  In 1995 Mike Cowlishaw ported Java to OS/2 and soon after started with an experiment to run REXX on the JVM. With REXX generally considered the first of the general purpose scripting languages, NetRexx is the first alternative language for the JVM. The 0.50 release, from April 1996, contained the NetRexx runtime classes and a translator written in REXX but tokenized and turned into an OS/2 executable. The 1.00 release came available in January 1997 and contained a translator bootstrapped to NetRexx. Release 2.00 became available in August 2000 and was a major upgrade, in which interpreted execution was added. Mike Cowlishaw left IBM in March 2010, and the future of IBM NetRexx as open source was unknown for a while. IBM finally announced the transfer of NetRexx source code to the Rexx Language Association (RexxLA) on June 8, 2011, 14 years after the v1.0 release. IBM released the NetRexx source code to RexxLA under the ICU license. RexxLA shortly after released this as NetRexx 3.00 and has followed up with regular releases, the latest one being 3.08 on 2019-09-06. the ICU license has not been approved by OSI; it appears to be a variant of the Expat License.  Syntax  The syntax and object model of NetRexx differ from Object REXX, another IBM object-oriented variant of REXX which has been released as open source software. The successor ooREXX shares a few syntactical elements (\`LOOP\`, \`DO OVER\`) not found in classical REXX.

Personal life Angelina Maccarone was born in Pulheim, Germany, 1965. A child of immigration, she is the daughter of an Italian father - who was also a guest worker - and a German mother who together moved to Germany in the 1960s. Maccarone originally sought a career in music before turning to film. She played the electric guitar and became a lyricist when she was 14 years old. In 1985, she attended the University of Hamburg and majored in German and American Studies. Maccarone currently lives in Berlin with her partner, film editor Bettina Böhler. Career Maccarone has been writing screenplays since 1992. In that same year, she wrote a screenplay treatment that won the award of the Hamburg Department of Culture, which marked the beginning of her career in film-making. In 1995, Maccarone wrote the final screenplay for a movie with the same name as the treatment, which turned out to be the coming-out comedy Kommt Mausi raus?! With this film, she made her directorial debut and was nominated for the Telestar award. She then made another film in 1998 titled Everything Will Be Fine (Alles wird gut), which also won an award, as it was the winner of Audience Awards in multiple cities, such as Los Angeles and Toronto. In 2005, Maccarone's feature-film Fremde Haut was released. It is about a gay Muslim woman fleeing from Iran to seek asylum in Germany, and it takes on topics regarding unclear and changing representations of identity as a lesbian Muslim woman. Filmed during the New Queer Cinema movement, Fremde Haut is also noted for its few moments of briefly portraying a lesbian relationship as powerful and free.; It proceeded to win the Jury Grand Prize at the International LGBT Festival in Montreal and the Jury Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Seattle L & G Film Festival. The next year, Maccarone directed and released Verfolgt, which was finished in Hamburg. Prior to its release, she stated \\"This will be a scandal.\\" This is most likely due to the controversial plot, where a middle- aged female probation officer is seduced by a 17-year-old male teen in her charge. In 2011, Maccarone wrote and directed a documentary known as Charlotte Rampling: The Look. It tells the British actress' life story as it is revealed through a series of conversations that uncover details about Rampling's career and personal thoughts on life. It was presented at the annual Cannes Film Festival in 2011.

It was built in 1929–1931 as a speculative office tower development in anticipation of an increased demand for office space in Lower Manhattan. The building was converted into apartments in 1997 and was renamed Le Rivage. The building has an Art Deco design with many lavish architectural finishes and a series of setbacks which taper toward the top floors. It was designed by Starrett & van Vleck, who at the same time designed the adjacent Downtown Athletic Club. 21 West Street was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 and designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1998.  Site  21 West Street is located near the southernmost point of Manhattan Island, closest to its western shore. The building faces West Street to the west, Morris Street to the north, and Washington Street and the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel portal to the east. It is adjacent to the Downtown Athletic Club building at 18–20 West Street to the south, which also occupies the entire block between West and Washington Streets. The lot has a frontage of on each of West and Washington Streets, and on Morris Street, covering a total area of . The building stands on filled land along the shore of the North River (an archaic name for the southernmost portion of the Hudson River). The surrounding neighborhood, the Financial District, was the first part of Manhattan to be developed as part of New Netherland and later New York City; its population growth led city officials to add land on Manhattan's shore by filling and land reclamation in the 18th and 19th centuries. As the North River shoreline was deeper and had a denser concentration of buildings than the East River shoreline on the east side of Manhattan Island, the land under 21 West Street was not filled until 1835, when debris from the Great Fire of New York was dumped there. As a result of the land filling, 21 West Street was constructed without a basement, which was \\"a decidedly rare feature\\" in New York City buildings, hence the need to import steam and electricity. The site of 21 West Street was first occupied by small landowners who built houses in the area. The surrounding neighborhood became a financial and shipping hub during the late 19th century; as the Financial District became more densely developed, the residential landowners moved uptown and their former lands were combined to build larger commercial buildings. Design Facade detail showing corner windows at right 21 West Street is 31 stories tall. It was designed in the Art Deco style by Starrett & van Vleck, who at the same time designed the adjacent Downtown Athletic Club building. Starrett & van Vleck had already designed several New York City department stores, including the Lord & Taylor building, the Bloomingdale's building, and the Saks Fifth Avenue building.  Form  The building has a ground-story arcade which overhangs much of the Morris Street sidewalk, giving the impression that pedestrians have been transported inside the building. There are numerous storefronts beneath the arcade, as well as the entrance to the building's lobby. As mandated by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, the design of 21 West Street features six setbacks, creating the impression that the building tapers off as it ascends. The setbacks are located on Washington Street above the 10th and 16th floors, at the northwest and northeast corners above the 21st floor, and on all sides above the 26th, 29th, and 30th floors.In this article, the floor above ground level is referred to as the \\"second floor\\", even though the ground level is the equivalent of two stories. All subsequent stories are referred to using this same pattern.  Facade  The facade of 21 West Street was designed with molded and oversized brick \\"to emphasize the structural lines and to enrich the texture of the materials\\". Brick and terracotta were used in red, orange, and yellow tones, a design feature influenced by Harvey Wiley Corbett's plan for the Master Apartments in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. For instance, the light-tan vertical piers highlight the building's vertical dimension, while other brick patterns give the impression of a \\"skin\\", including the horizontal lines of the spandrels between the floors. At each setback and on the three lower levels, the parapets have various designs of molded brick to provide surface texture to the building's exterior. The southern facade is hidden behind the Downtown Athletic Club building to the south. The corners of the building were outfitted with windows wrapping around the edge at a 90-degree angle, instead of structural columns as had been provided in previous buildings, making 21 West Street possibly the first commercial building in the U.S. to have wrap- around corner windows. Prior to the construction of 21 West Street, corner windows had only been used on residential structures. Underside of one of the corners, facing the arcade on Morris Street Despite its address, 21 West Street's primary entrance is at the center of the Morris Street facade, beneath the one-story arcade, which includes ten bays at ground level on this side of the building and has multicolored mosaics on its ceiling. The arcade, storefronts, and main entrance contain decorative metalworks painted in silver and gold tones, which extend into the interior, described by the National Park Service as \\"an unusual design feature\\". The piers and interior walls of the arcade are outfitted with bronze panels and lighting installations. The arcade's arches mostly consist of stepped brick, except for the fifth bay from Washington Street, which is a square marble-framed arch that leads to the main entrance. The spandrels above the arcade are textured in a chevron (V-shaped) design with tan and purple brick. The arcade continues in reduced form on the West and Washington Street facades, each being five bays wide. Above the ground floor, each floor of 21 West Street generally contains two rolled steel windows per bay, with wrap-around windows at the corners, each of these windows having four panes, two on each side. One exception to this is the second floor, which has three windows per bay, also with wrap-around windows at the corners; the second-floor bays are separated by purple and tan brick piers. Below the setbacks on the 21st and 26th floors, the corners facing Morris Street are replaced with a single diagonal chamfered bay.  Features  Having constructed 21 West Street as a speculative development in anticipation of growing demand for office space in lower Manhattan, the building's developers aimed to attract potential tenants through the unique design of the structure. When built, 21 West Street included high-speed elevators and other innovations \\"to contribute to the comfort and convenience of its tenants\\". A lobby, stories high, is located on the north side of the ground floor, linking to the two elevator banks. The lobby has a colorful marble mosaic on its floor, depicting the old street grid of lower Manhattan in a style similar to a mariner's map. There are bronze lighting installations near the elevator banks, decorated with waves and shell motifs. Since its conversion to an apartment building, the interior of 21 West Street has included a terrace on the 34th floor, a play area for children, and a fitness room. The rooms were created from former office spaces; for instance, the play area was previously a locker room. History The construction of 21 West Street occurred when the Financial District was being expanded as a commercial area. The construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company's elevated railroad lines, and later the New York City Subway, had spurred the relocation of the area's residential population uptown in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; the tenements that developed at the edges of the Financial District were being demolished and replaced with office buildings. The building was owned by the 21 West Street Corporation, which had close ties with the maritime industry along the Hudson River. It was developed by civil engineer Alfred Rheinstein. Work began on the structure in 1929, the foundations had been laid by April 1930, and building work was completed in 1931. Real estate agents William A. White & Sons were hired to rent out the space in 21 West Street. After the building's completion, the owners identified tenants in the maritime and shipping industries, including lawyers, transport companies, and import/export companies associated with the sector. In addition, naval architecture firm Gibbs & Cox was headquartered at the building for over 30 years. Other early tenants included the Peruvian consulate in New York City, the Moran Towing and Transportation Company, the Shepard Steamship Company, and the Hedger Transportation Corporation. Around 1950, the main entrance was modified and a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system was installed. In 1997, the residential development and management firm, Rose Associates, announced plans to convert 21 West Street into a 293-unit apartment building called Le Rivage. It was to be the firm's first project in 10 years and its first Manhattan project below 8th Street. The building was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1998, and was listed on the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places the following year, at which time it was recorded in the register that 21 West Street had been \\"abandoned for over a decade\\". When the building was damaged in Hurricane Sandy in 2012, residents' rents were temporarily lowered. The residential units in 21 West Street were partially renovated in 2014.

He was born in the Gold Coast (modern Ghana) and later emigrated to the United States, but returned to Africa for several years. He was the first vice Principal of Achimota College. Biography He was born in Chorkor the son of Kodwo Kwegyir, a friend of the then master chieftain Amonu IV. In June 1883, he was baptized in a municipality in the Gold Coast and accepted his Christian first name James. He attended Wesley Boys Senior High School (now Mfantsipim School) Cape Coast, where the teachers noted that he was precocious, already studying Greek and Latin, and he subsequently rose to become the school's headmaster.Magnus Sampson, Makers of Modern Ghana, Accra: Anowuo Educational Publications, 1969, p. 143. In 1898, at the age of 23, he was selected due to his education to be trained in the United States as a missionary. On July 10, 1898, Aggrey agreed and left the Gold Coast for the United States, where he settled in Salisbury, North Carolina, and attended Livingstone College. He studied a variety of subjects at the university, including chemistry, physics, logic, economics and politics. In May 1902 he graduated from the university with three academic degrees. Aggrey was very talented in language and was said to have spoken (beside English) French, German, Ancient and Modern Greek, and Latin. In November 1903 he was appointed a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in Salisbury. In 1905 he married Rose Douglas, a native of Virginia, with whom he had four children. In the same year he began to teach at Livingstone College. In 1912 he earned his doctorate in theology, and in 1914 followed a doctorate in osteopathy. In the same year he transferred employment to a small municipality to North Carolina. Between 1915 and 1917 Aggrey took up further studies at what is now known as Columbia University, where he studied sociology, psychology and the Japanese language. In 1920 Paul Monroe, a member of the Phelps Stokes Fund offered Aggrey the opportunity to attend a research expedition to Africa to determine which measures were necessary for the improvement of education in Africa. Aggrey accepted and visited what are now ten different countries in Africa, where he collected and analyzed education data. In 1920 he visited Sierra Leone, Liberia, the Gold Coast, Cameroon and Nigeria. In 1921 he visited the Belgian Congo, Angola and South Africa. During this journey Aggrey made a significant impression and underscored the importance of education among some people who would become important figures in Africa, including Hastings Kamuzu Banda, later president of Malawi, Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first president of Nigeria, and Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana. In Ghana he delivered a lecture that persuaded Governor Guggisberg that Achimota College should be co-educational: > \\"The surest way to keep people down is to educate the men and neglect the > women. If you educate a man you simply educate an individual, but if you > educate a woman, you educate a whole nation.\\" In South Africa he delivered a lecture which used the keys of the piano as an image of racial harmony: > \\"I don't care what you know; show me what you can do. Many of my people who > get educated don't work, but take to drink. They see white people drink, so > they think they must drink too. They imitate the weakness of the white > people, but not their greatness. They won't imitate a white man working hard > ... If you play only the white notes on a piano you get only sharps; if only > the black keys you get flats; but if you play the two together you get > harmony and beautiful music.\\"Umteteli wa Bantu, April 23, 1921, quoted in This image was the inspiration for the name adopted by the journal of the League of Coloured Peoples, The Keys.Geiss, Immanuel, The Pan-African Movement [1968], translated by Ann Keep. London: Methuen, 1974, p. 342. In 1924 Aggrey was appointed by the governor of the Crown Colony Gold Coast Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg as the First Vice Principal of Achimota College in Accra. He designed the emblem of Achimota College. He resettled with his wife and children at the college, north of Accra. In May 1927 he returned to the United States, and in July admitted to a hospital in Harlem, New York, where he died later that month. Aggrey is buried in Oakdale Cemetery in Salisbury, North Carolina. Writing * The Eagle That Would Not Fly (illustrated by Wolf Erlbruch) Legacy In 1934 Aggrey House, London, was set up as a hostel for African students and students of African descent, and was named after Aggrey. In November 2004, the City of Salisbury, North Carolina, and the State of North Carolina honored Dr. Aggrey and Mrs. Rose Aggrey with a historical markerWineka, Mark, \\"Aggrey Legacy: Marker First to Honor a Couple\\", Salisbury Post, November 7, 2004. at their Salisbury, North Carolina, home in recognition of their contributions to the City of Salisbury and the State of North Carolina. It was believed this was the first marker State of North Carolina had installed to honor a couple. Buildings named for Aggrey include Aggrey Student Union at Livingstone College, and J.E.K. Aggrey Memorial Gymtorium at Landis Elementary School, built in the former location of Aggrey Memorial High School, built in 1933 for African-American children. Freeman Aggrey House in his alma mater, Mfantsipim School, was named after him and Methodist priest, Rev. Freeman. A boys' residential house at Achimota School, Aggrey House was named in his honour. In 2017, Aggrey's picture appeared on the 5-cedi bill. Aggrey has been named after a chapel belonging to the A.M.E. Zion Church in Mamprobi, Accra, Ghana. Aggrey is quoted as saying, \\"Nothing but the best is good enough for Africa.\\" (Sometimes worded as \\"Nothing but the best is good enough for the African.\\") In 1947 the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church took over the management of a private school founded by Rev. A. W. E. Appiah, a nephew of Dr. J. E. K. Aggrey and named the school Aggrey Memorial A.M.E. Zion Senior High School. This senior high school is presently located in Cape Coast in the Central Region of Ghana. In 1932, Nigerian educator, statesman, activist and politician Dr Alvan Azinna Ikoku. established a Co-Educational Secondary School in Nigeria : the Aggrey Memorial Secondary School, located in Arochukwu and named after his mentor James E. K. Aggrey. His eponymous great-nephew was the Ghanaian diplomat James Aggrey- Orleans.

It was built as a company town in 1917 to serve the new smelter for James Douglas, Jr.'s United Verde Extension Mine (UVX) in Jerome. The town was originally named Verde after the mine, but it was changed to Clemenceau in 1920 in honor of the French premier in World War I, Georges Clemenceau, a personal friend of Douglas. Clemenceau would later leave a vase designed by the French potter Ernest Chaplet to the town in return. History Originally named Verde, the town was renamed Clemenceau in 1920, both to honor Georges Clemenceau and to avoid possible confusion with nearby Camp Verde. Though now a part of the city of Cottonwood, Verde as it was known had its own post office and station on the Clarkdale branch of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad.Barnes, Will C. Arizona Place Names (University of Arizona Press, 1988) \\"Actual construction of Verde, the United Verde Extension's smelter town in the valley, will probably be under way by January 1,\\" the Jerome News reported on November 9, 1917. \\"The company will not begin work on its proposed Hogback town, at the east edge of Jerome, before summer at the earliest, and probably not then. So stated General Manager George Kingdon today in a general discussion of the U. V. Extension building plans.\\"The Jerome News; Friday, November 9, 1917 The smelter town had homes for workers, a school, bank, and a clubhouse, and its population varied between 1,000 and 5,000. To deliver ore to the smelter from Jerome, Douglas built the Arizona-Extension Railway, a two-branch shortline railroad. The western branch ran between Clemenceau and the eastern portal of the Josephine Tunnel, which connected to the UVX Mine. The eastern branch ran between Clemenceau and Clarkdale. On July 16, 1918, Verde was the scene of a violent confrontation when a handful of Mexican laborers collided with area lawmen attempting to enforce the War Department's so called \\"work or fight order\\" during World War One. Former Yavapai County Sheriff James R. Lowry, then serving as a deputy sheriff at the smelter, was shot and killed during the incident. His assailant was later killed during an exchange of gunfire with an off-duty peace officer near Camp Verde.Dolan, Samuel K. Cowboys and Gangsters: Stories of an Untamed Southwest (TwoDot Books, 2016) The Clemenceau smelter closed in 1937. Most residents then left the area. When Cottonwood was incorporated in 1960, Clemenceau and the Clemenceau Airport were included in its boundaries. With the exception of the school, the bank/post office and the smelter slag pile, little remains of the original town of Clemenceau. A largely invisible remnant is the Clemenceau Water Company, which still serves the area of the old town of Clemenceau. The town of Cottonwood bought the company in 2004, but it still operates as a separate entity, as of 2006. Clemenceau Heritage Museum The Clemenceau Heritage Museum occupies most of the old Clemenceau School, which operated from 1924 through 1986. The 1918 Clemenceau Bank and Post Office building is also part of the museum. The museum has displays on mining, ranching, and farming in the Verde Valley, and preserves archives and artifacts from the area. An elaborate working model- railroad display depicts the nine railroads that once operated in the region. Douglas and Clemenceau James Douglas, Jr., bought an apartment in Paris for his friend, Georges Clemenceau, in 1926, for his retirement home. This building later became the Musée Clemenceau.

Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge, in the sense of what they think subconsciously, changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them. History Cognitive anthropology has strong ties to ethnoscience and linguistics. Scope Cognitive anthropology studies a range of domains including folk taxonomies, the interaction of language and thought, and cultural models. From a linguistics stand-point, cognitive anthropology uses language as the doorway to study cognition. Its general goal is to break language down to find commonalities in different cultures and the ways people perceive the world. Linguistic study of cognitive anthropology may be broken down into three subfields: semantics, syntactics, and pragmatics. Methods In contrast to traditional ethnographic methods in cultural anthropology, cognitive anthropology primarily uses quantitative methodologies in order to study culture. Because of the field's interest in determining shared knowledge, consensus analysis has been used as its most widely used statistical measure. One of the techniques used is Cultural Network Analysis, the drawing of networks of interrelated ideas that are widely shared among members of a population. Recently there has been some interchange between cognitive anthropologists and those working in artificial intelligence. Relation with cognitive science Anthropology is one of six fields which contributed to the founding of cognitive science. However, anthropology has been criticised for being detached from cognitive science. See also * Componential analysis * Roy D'Andrade * A.

Run-off areas are usually located along a road racing circuit where racers are most likely to unintentionally depart from the prescribed course. There are different types of run off areas like gravel trap, AstroTurf and tarmac. Run- off areas are an alternative to catch fences. Definition In motorsports racing there is a concept called the racing line which is defined in lay terms as the optimal path around a race course that will allow the racer to complete a lap in the least possible time with the highest possible average speed. The racing line is a function of the track's layout and the combination of a particular type of racing vehicle's (such as a car versus a motorcycle) capabilities and the physics of motorsports racing. Because the physics involved in a motorsports event generally propels the racing vehicles along a certain path, and since the racers tend to work with the forces acting on the vehicle and make course changes while not suddenly confronting the forces in play on the vehicle, their locations at certain points along the track can be predicted and their course of travel extrapolated. As a result, in areas where a vehicle is more likely to depart the course (i.e., around the outside of a corner as opposed to alongside a straight-away), course designers will place a run-off area. Design Race tracks have evolved over the years, as have motorsports in general, and through the concerted efforts of certain racers and supporting organizations, safety has become a top priority amongst race organizing constituents such as sanctioning leagues, sponsors, tracks and team owners. Prior to safety being brought to the forefront of the racing world's consciousness, it was often an afterthought and many racers were injured or lost their lives due to accidents that were either themselves preventable or due to the lack of proper safety measures that, had they been in place, very well might have made a difference. Once such example is when World Champion motorcycle racer Wayne Rainey crashed in the accident that would eventually leave him paralyzed from the chest down. In that particular accident he rode slightly too aggressively into a turn and crashed. As he slid into the run-off area's gravel trap, he suffered a broken back. In that particular case the gravel trap had been raked in an effort to more quickly dissipate the kinetic energy of off-course cars. The change was unfortunately left in place for the motorcycle race in which Rainey suffered his back injury. Another example is the introduction of the air fence. The air fence performs a function similar to the air bag in a commercial passenger vehicle, except that rather than inflating upon impact, it is pre-inflated. By acting as a softer, energy- absorbing barrier, air fences can be placed over hard obstacles around tracks that racers might encounter in the course of an accident. With an air fence in place the racer has a much better chance of sustaining fewer injuries than if he were to simply hit the object without any buffer. They are especially important (and more widely used) in motorcycle road racing. Run-off areas are an important safety feature of modern motorsports parks and road courses. In fact, they are arguably the most important factor since they are the basis for several other safety features, such as gravel traps and air fences, which could not be placed anywhere or would be ineffective without a proper run-off area. Importance in the perception of a motorsports park's standards When being interviewed about race tracks and what features they like and dislike, many top professional racers will mention the availability, design and size of the run-off areas of a certain track and how knowing that they are very safe gives them added peace of mind and allows them to push the limits further, since they have less fear of the consequences of making a mistake. In short, other than personal safety equipment or the safety features of the race vehicle itself, the most important safety feature of a race track is the quantity, size, quality, maintenance, race-type specific configuration and overall design of its run-off areas. Athlete pressure for added safety In the end, champions of motorsports safety found their most powerful ally not in any one group, but rather in market economics since the threat of financial ruin compelled more motorsports facilities to make significant and substantial safety changes than they were previously compelled to do by mere intra-sport political pressure. The same occurred within race teams, manufacturers and sponsors, although to a lesser degree since individual racers had less impact (and thus less financial sway) over the race teams to which they belonged than did large groups of racers over individual events or racing leagues, since in the latter cases their individual race teams were not necessarily vilifying themselves and therefore did not put up too much opposition if doing so might mean losing a top athlete from the team. In fact, cases of teams siding with athletes on issues were common, much to the chagrin of racing leagues in those situations. So, once the \\"barrier had been broken,\\" as it were, safety came to the forefront of the entire racing community's consciousness and racers found that when pitted against racing leagues or venues on safety issues, they had a tremendous amount of support from their fans, the public at large, government agencies, manufacturers and so on. In other words, racing athletes now had a great deal of leverage over venues and leagues and the status quo became that the racing athletes became much more influential in venue selection for their respective leagues' circuit (although that leverage manifested itself primarily in rejecting proposed venues, rather than petition for the inclusion of tracks that were not currently on the circuit). Economics of track safety As a result, in modern racing leagues, if a track does not have adequate safety preparations, including proper run-off areas, racers will often threaten to boycott any events that visit that particular track. In actuality, the racing leagues in question have safety standards to which they hold tracks when selecting them; therefore, if the athletes have an issue with a track it is usually because there is some problem that is either beyond the scope of the rules, or that they interpret them differently from the league, and so on. In order to prevent such a strike and to make themselves as attractive as possible to various racing sanctioning bodies in the hopes of attracting lucrative professional racing events to their facilities, park managements will often pay substantial attention to such facilities' features as safety devices, including run-off areas, and make substantial financial investments to add or improve such devices as deemed necessary. They will even go so far as to advertise safety as having been a central design tenet during the track's general construction or renovation. By making the facility as attractive as possible to racers, the hope is that the racers will put pressure on the leagues in which they participate to race at that venue. The other theory is that by making the venue as up-to-date, luxurious, safe and feature-rich as possible that various racing leagues will want to hold events there and thus not only will the park make revenues from gate fees, but they will also make more money from sponsorship deals for selling advertising space on track property (such as walls around the course, bridges, infield grass painting, etc.). Such advertising will be seen by many potential consumers since the more popular racing leagues have more television viewers and so the rates that the facility can charge to advertisers will be higher than if the track received less television air-time or air-time with lower ratings. Therefore, making safety improvements makes financial sense to a track's management since it leads to greater demand from event promoters and ever larger and more popular events, which in turn increase a track's gate revenues, advertising revenues, and revenues from club racers and other users of the track while major events are not being held since the popularity of a track corresponds to its usage by non-professionals engaging in hobby pursuits. If top racers do not feel that a track is safe they may put pressure on their racing league to not schedule events at that particular venue. Or, if a league has documented safety standards for the tracks on their circuit, they may choose not to schedule events at a deficient facility until it has made the requisite changes. Until racers became actively involved with promoting race track safety, there was no market pressure on the tracks to make such improvements. Now that safety measures are an integral part of the demand equation (with the racing leagues being the consumers and the tracks being the suppliers), tracks must be competitive in terms of their safety facilities in order to be competitive in luring events from the most popular racing leagues. Because run-off areas and their associated safety devices (i.e. gravel traps, air fences, tire walls, etc.) are a primary safety feature of tracks, they hold enormous economic sway over the track, a consideration that is not lost on designers of new tracks and existing tracks' renovation projects.

Schluter was born in Hamburg, Germany, the oldest of 3 children. His father, Heinrich Schlüter, was a German army officer was killed during World War II at the age of 41. His wife, Margarethe was left to raise 3 children, Albert, Heinz and Monja. Schluter followed in his father's footsteps and enlisted in the German Army at the beginning of WW2 and rose to the rank of lieutenant. He was twice decorated with the Iron Cross and luckily survived after a bullet wound to the arm allowed a timely exit from the Eastern Front. He immigrated to Australia in 1951 to live with his uncle and aunt in Sydney. Some years later he travelled to Tasmania on a holiday and soon took up residence and married Kathleen Round on Anzac Day, 1957. He fathered four children, Paul, Christine, Andrew and Simon. He worked in a range of jobs including dry cleaning, geriatric nursing, a clerk at BP and lastly as a self-employed printer. Growing up in Nazi Germany during the reign of Adolf Hitler left an indelible impression. Schluter was disheartened by the xenophobic treatment of foreigners by Australians. He saw racism and ignorance. Experiencing this in his new country was difficult and demoralizing. His vision of a culturally rich, more tolerant Australia by the integration of different cultures never left him. He was an elder and founding member of the Lutheran Church of Tasmania. In the 1960s he joined and was the driving force of the Good Neighbour Council of Tasmania. At one stage he was president, treasurer and secretary. He pushed for a culture of education and public celebration within cultural groups. He believed that migrants should stand up and be counted and celebrate their ethnic customs. Traditions began to change. Citizenship ceremonies were now public celebrations. On one occasion Schluter went out and bought trees that were given to each new Australian. A tradition that continues to this day. In the 1960s he joined the Australian Labor Party and started the Springfield Branch of the ALP. Although standing as a Labor candidate in 1969 and 1972 he was unsuccessful but undeterred. In the 1970s he organised fund raising activities for the Red Cross and Salvation Army. He introduced Hobart to German playwrights as president of the Hobart Repertory Theatre and presented German classical composers on the local community radio station 92.1FM. In 1979 he was appointed to the Migrant Settlement Council for Tasmania. In 1982 he was awarded the Order of Australia Medal \\"For service to the community and to migrant welfare.\\" With funding reduced to the Good Neighbour Council his role moved to that of chair of the Multicultural Council of Tasmania in the 1990s that embodied numerous ethnic communities that had a stronger voice. Schluter was a mover and shaker within the Tasmanian community. Never one to be backward in coming forward he frequently cornered politicians as to their views and accountability on ethnic affairs. A favourite story relates to Albert putting his comments to poetry at otherwise boring conferences. He was a favourite with the media for his frank opinions. He was a frequent visitor to Canberra and regularly sort for his advice on multicultural matters. Albert was an active member of the Federated Ethnic Communities Council of Australia. Soon after he turned 80 FECCA had been left without staff in Canberra so he left his home state of Tasmania and went and staffed it by himself. He was outspoken on the policies of Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party and likened their racist policies to that of Nazi Germany. He was not popular with her supporters. He died in Hobart. An extraordinary community worker he was regularly recognized by the community and leaves a legacy of change and empowerment to multicultural Australia.

It is named after Fort Vancouver, an early trading outpost (now restored and located near the banks of the Columbia River, a few miles from where the school is located). The FVHS symbol is the Trapper, in reference to the fur trade in the early 19th century by such groups as Hudson's Bay Company voyageurs. History Originally named Vancouver High School, the institution opened in 1888. Classes were first held in the basement of Central School. During 1905–1913, classes were held in the old Franklin School building, then from 1913–1970 in its own building at West 26th street and Main Street (what is now the corner of Main Street and Fourth Plain Boulevard). The first graduating class was in June 1891, when 12 students (9 girls and 3 boys) received their diplomas. By 1912, 276 students had received diplomas from the high school, before the permanent Vancouver High School was even opened for the 1912–1913 school year. The Vancouver School District decided to change the name of the school in 1956 when a second high school, Hudson's Bay, was built just east of the main downtown area, near Clark College. In the fall of 1970, the campus of Fort Vancouver High School was relocated to its present location in a new building at 5700 E. 18th Street. In 1972, against much public protest, the original classical three- story brick high school building was demolished.

Students at Fort Vancouver have diverse backgrounds and economic status. 16.8% of the students are in Fort Vancouver's ELL (English Language Learning) program and 11.9% are in Special Education. Approximately one-third of Fort Vancouver's students speak a language other than English when at home. Fort Vancouver High School is the only high school in Vancouver School District with an ELL (English Language Learning) program. Magnets Fort Vancouver High School is home to several of the Vancouver School District's \\"magnet\\" programs. The Legal, Medical, Culinary Arts, Industrial Arts, and ELL magnets draw students to FVHS for specialized education programs. The legal magnet is no longer in function at FVHS. Although, their Mock Trial program has for the past 22 years, been the district champion, moving on to the state, and on several occasions, the national level. In the 2012 district competition, they came in first place. The FVHS Legal Magnet is also one of two public high schools in the nation to have a functioning courtroom facility on its campus. The court room is no longer used for actual judicial proceedings from the Washington State Court of Appeals and the Clark County Student Traffic Court. The Medical Magnet, founded also in 1992, strives to give students an in-depth knowledge of the medical field. Many students who enroll in the program go on to college to pursue degrees in the medical field. The medical magnet leads the students of the FVHS Red Cross Club in organizing blood drives and humanitarian aid projects. The Culinary Arts Program at FVHS, founded in 1972, is the oldest magnet at FVHS. Students in this program gain a comprehensive knowledge of the hospitality industry as well as the experience of cooking during their class time. Many will intern at the cafes in the VSD headquarters. The Industrial Arts Magnet provides students with an introduction to the skills necessary for a successful career in the manual trades. Students also gain knowledge of the artistic and practical side of welding and machine technologies. The ELL program at FVHS is the only one of its kind in the district. Students from diverse backgrounds come together here to learn a common language and culture, to become better acclimated with America. Fort Vancouver has students from all over the world speaking practically every language and it is here in the ELL Magnet that a melting pot of world cultures comes together so that students can learn from one another. Starting 2016, the school has renamed the program as Center For International Studies. The school is a member of the Asia Society's International Studies Schools Network, a consortium of schools throughout the U.S. that are committed to developing global competence. Other programs Students at Fort Vancouver High School can also be involved in Running Start, which allows students to receive both college and high school credits while attending Clark College. Students may also take advantage of vocational programs offered through Clark College. Additionally, some classes at FVHS offer credit through the WSU-Vancouver campus.

Her parents sought to create a climate in which sincere faith was fostered with great respect for their children's freedom. In late 1942 she suffered from bronchitis but remedies failed to work promoting constant care for her condition which improved and was gone in the summer of 1943. On 11 June 1944 - with her brothers Jorge and Enrique - she received her Confirmation at the parish of Santa María. Grases made her First Communion on 27 May 1948. In October 1946 she began her schooling and in 1951 commenced her high school education under the care of nuns. Once she graduated from her high school education she continued her studies at the Professional College for Women in Barcelona while alternating that with piano courses. Grases liked sport and music as well as traditional local dances; he favorite dance was the \\"sardanas\\". Her friends would go with her on frequent trips to the poor regions to teach catechism to children and often bought them sweets. Grases liked netball and tennis as well as outings with friends and participating in theatrical works. Grases also climbed mountains near Seva where she liked to spend her summers and also liked ping-pong. In 1951 she was awarded a prize after winning a bike race. In 1954 she had her first encounter with Opus Dei but knew of them beforehand since her parents had joined in 1952. Her mother encouraged her to visit an Opus Dei center that offered classes to girls to help strengthen her faith and her spiritual life but there existed some doubts as to whether she wished to belong to Opus Dei. In 1956 she attended an Opus Dei retreat to discern her calling but did not come to a conclusion as to whether she desired to join Opus Dei. On 24 December 1957 she saw that God was calling her to the path of holiness offered in Opus Dei and she asked for admission into their ranks after seeking counsel from those around her. In 1958 she went skiing with friends at La Molina and injured her leg which caused pain over the course of several months prompting for her to be taken on 26 June 1958 to a Red Cross clinic for evaluation. In June 1958 she was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma in one leg after having experienced great pain for several months. Once the news had been broken to her she was heard singing a Mexican song later on 27 June in Llar: > \\"When I was living so happily, without thinking of love, you wanted me to > love you and I loved you passionately. And I will continue to love you even > after death. For I love you with the soul, and the soul never dies\\". The bone cancer caused intense pains which she bore with both a serene and heroic fortitude. Throughout her illness she never lost her contagious cheerfulness or her desire for friendship which sprang from her deep interior life and zeal for souls. It was as a result of this that she continued bringing friends and schoolmates closer to God. From 11-17 November 1958 she visited Rome where she got to see Pope John XXIII and also was able to meet Saint Josemaría Escrivá on 13 November. He was to give her his blessing and she tried to kneel though Escrivá prevented her from doing so. He instead put his hands on her head and made the sign of the Cross on her forehead in blessing. It was upon her return home that her condition worsened and she found she was unable to sleep at night. Grases offered her pain for the founder and for the pope. García died in Barcelona on 26 March 1959 - Holy Thursday - at around 10:00am after she tried to sit up in her bed. The girl died - according to witnesses - looking at a picture of the Mother of God. Her last words were: \\"How much I love You! When are You coming for me\\"? Her remains were later exhumed and relocated in 1994. Beatification process The beatification process opened in Barcelona in an informative process that spanned from 19 December 1962 until 26 March 1968 collecting witness testimonies and documentation as well as Grases' spiritual writings. There were 27 testimonies collected from those who knew her on a personal level. The theologians inspected her spiritual writings and approved them of possessing no doctrinal errors on 22 February 1974 while the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the informative process in Rome on 15 May 1992. On 10 May 1993 a request was lodged to hold another process to collect additional documentation and testimonies though not required. This diocesan process opened on 10 June 1993 and closed later on 28 October 1993 collecting another 100 testimonies. The C.C.S. later validated this process on 21 January 1994. The postulation later submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. for assessment in December 1999 though the cause remained inactive for sometime until 30 June 2015 when theologians provided an affirmative response and approved the cause after having inspected the dossier. Cardinal Angelo Amato - the C.C.S. prefect - chaired the session of the C.C.S. members that approved the cause on 19 April 2016. Pope Francis confirmed that Grases had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue and named her as Venerable on 26 April 2016. The then-Opus Dei prelate Javier Echevarría Rodríguez welcomed the pope's decision and said that Grases had \\"corresponded to God's love\\" and had \\"sought to be pious\\" while noting that she strove to \\"work well with a spirit of service\\" to others. The current postulator for this cause from 25 October 2013 is Monsignor José Gutiérrez Gómez.

Until 1948 it was a mixed Jewish-Arab business district. Between 1948 and 1967, it was located along the armistice line between the Israeli and Jordanian-held sector of the city, and many buildings were destroyed by Jordanian shelling. The Israeli government approved an urban renewal project for Mamilla, apportioning land for residential and commercial zones, including hotels and office space. The Mamilla Mall opened in 2007. Geography Mamilla Pool, mid-19th century The neighbourhood of Mamilla is located within the northwest extension of the Hinnom Valley, which extends from the southwest corner of the Old City along the city's western wall. The neighbourhood is bounded by the Jaffa Gate and Jaffa Road to the east and north, the downtown and Rehavia neighbourhood above it to the west, and Yemin Moshe's upward slope along its southwestern edge. Its total area is 120 dunam (). History Theodor Herzl outside the Stern House, 1898 Roman period The now dry \\"Mamilla Pool\\", with a capacity of 30,000 cubic metres, was probably built by Herod the Great. An underground channel connected it to Hezekiah's Pool, situated inside the city walls and in immediate proximity to Herod's royal palace. Herod is known to have built the Pool of the Towers (probably identical to Hezekiah's Pool) and the Serpent's Pool (Birket es-Sultan, Sultan's Pool), which were both fed by aqueducts coming from the Mamilla Pool.W.

Retrieved 5 September 2013 Ottoman period In the late 19th century, the area around the Old City walls was barren and undeveloped. It was only notable for the junction of paths that would become Jaffa Road and the highway to Jaffa, with the road to Hebron outside the Jaffa Gate. Among its first structures was the Hospice Saint Vincent de Paul, part of the emerging French Compound. The early building developed as an extension of the adjacent souk along the city walls at the Jaffa Gate as a quarter for merchants and artisans. It became home for commerce and residences that could not find room within the overcrowded Old City, and several of Jerusalem's prominent modern businesses, like Hotel Fast, were first built here. In 1908, the Ottoman authorities erected a clock tower above Jaffa Gate. The British removed it a decade later. British Mandate British demolition of buildings along the Old City walls, 1944 The British arrival in Jerusalem heralded a rational philosophy of infrastructure planning and development. It respected cultural and historic heritage and attempted to preserve such elements within the blossoming construction of the modern city. The city walls were identified as such an element, so British workers acted to clear away the stalls on their perimeter and maintain an open area between the walls and the rest of the New City in the interest of an aesthetically pleasing visual basin. By the same token, planners demolished the Ottoman clock tower to preserve a historic skyline. Mamilla in ruins, c. 1949 No man's land in Jerusalem, between Israel and Jordan. The photo (taken approx. 1964) depicts the Old City wall, Dormition Abbey (on the far right), and Tower of David (center-left). It was taken from the building of the Geology dep. of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, then located on Mamilla street. Following the approval of the 1947 UN Partition Plan, an Arab mob ransacked and burned much of the district and stabbed some of its Jewish residents in the course of the 1947 Jerusalem riots, one of the events leading to the area's decades-long stagnation. Jordanian period As the 1948 Arab-Israeli War commenced, the neighbourhood's location between Israeli and Jordanian forces made it a combat zone, leading to the flight of both Jewish and Arab residents. On May 22, 1948 the US Consul, Thomas C. Wasson, was assassinated shortly after leaving the French Consulate in the Mamilla district. After the signing of the 1949 Armistice Agreements and division of Jerusalem, the western three-quarters of Mamilla were held by Israel and the eastern quarter became a no man's land of barbed-wire and concrete barricades between Israeli and Jordanian lines. The active and hostile border subjected Mamilla to Jordanian sniper and guerilla attacks, and even stones thrown by Arab Legionnaires from the Old City walls above. The neighbourhood was one of several border areas in the city to experience a sharp decline, and subsequently became home to families of new immigrants with many children and of weak financial abilities, as well as dirty light industry like auto repair. In Mamilla in this period, the residents were primarily Kurdish immigrants and their Israeli children. Reunification and urban renewal plans After the Six-Day War in 1967, Jerusalem's municipal borders were expanded to include the Old City and beyond. Barricades that had lined the border were torn down. Many buildings on Mamilla's eastern end were in shambles from the fighting and lack of maintenance. Several historic buildings were condemned. One was the Stern House, which housed Zionist leader Theodor Herzl on his 1898 visit. However, popular outcry brought Supreme Court involvement which led to the temporary dismantling and reassembly nearby of this historical landmark. The terrace and Jerusalem stone-covered parking garage with construction in the background, January 2007 The 1970s saw numerous proposals for rehabilitating the neighbourhood, and it was defined as a zone of high-priority for reconstruction efforts. The administration responsible for preservation and construction in the Old City took Mamilla under its jurisdiction as well, both because of its proximity and its possession of many of the same considerations that the British weighed when regulating its development. A 1972 master-plan for revitalising the city centre transferred 100 of the 120 dunams () to Karta, the municipal firm led by architects Gilbert Weil and Moshe Safdie charged with the project, and called for the destruction of almost every building save the French Hospice St. Vincent de Paul. The plan called for a subterranean street system, over-ground buildings for offices and stores, a pedestrian promenade, parking for 1,000 cars, and a bus terminal. This plan evoked massive criticism throughout the city government, although mayor Teddy Kollek lent full political backing to the plan. When deputy mayor Meron Benvenisti commissioned a more conservative plan under architect David Kroyanker based on facadism, the mayor immediately filed it away without any discussion. Karta evicted 700 families, communal institutions, and businesses, placing them in the then-developing neighbourhoods of Baka and Neve Yaakov, and moved the industry to Talpiot, the seed of its current industrial zone. The evictions cost the Israeli government over $60 million and were only completed in 1988, when Mamilla ceased to exist as a neighbourhood and instead became a \\"compound\\" slated for future construction. Hospice Saint Vincent de Paul, Mamilla The evicted residents were mostly Jewish immigrants from Arab states whose weak financial status left them vulnerable to Kollek's plan. The following steep increase in real-estate values of formerly depressed areas like Mamilla near the former armistice line and the Old City was perceived by evicted Mizrahi Jews as an injustice. This became a key issue in 1970s Israeli social upheaval and the founding of the Black Panthers movement in Israel. Upscale apartments in David's Village echoing the arches and alleyways of the Old City After 16 years of controversy, during which the half-constructed Mamilla project remained an eyesore in the heart of the city, a revised plan drawn up by architect Moshe Safdie incorporating elements of Kroyanker's conservative design moved forward in 1986. The new plan called for the compound to be divided into four areas: an open-air mall with mixed-use 3-6 storey buildings and a multi-storey car park, terraced residential housing, and two hotels along its border with the downtown. The British Ladbroke Group plc, which controls the Hilton Hotels Corporation, won the bid to build the project's main hotel (originally Hilton Jerusalem and now David Citadel Hotel) and its housing, which it built as a luxury gated community named David's Village (, '). (video tour) Numerous disputes between Karta and Ladbroke led the British firm to exit the project, and its shares were assumed by Alfred Akirov's Alrov company. However, further objections from many sources-- including religious groups opposed to an entertainment area so close to the Old City and possible operation on the Jewish Sabbath--kept construction at a crawl. Both Alrov and Karta accused each other of breach of contract and sued. After years of frozen construction and drawn-out mediation, the Jerusalem district court found parts of both parties' complaints to be justified and ordered 100 million NIS paid to Alrov by Karta, which allowed construction to resume. May 28, 2007 saw the opening of phase one of the shopping mall and part of the 600-meter promenade. The completion of the remainder of the promenade, the Stern House rebuilding, and the other construction, including the 207-room five-star second hotel, was scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2008. Like several other luxury neighbourhoods in the city, apartments in the David's Village development are mostly owned by foreigners who visit for only a few days or weeks a year. Critics contend that this makes it a ghost town in the city centre. Mamilla is also the location of the projected Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance Jerusalem, a controversial project because its construction would require building on part of an old Muslim cemetery. Mamilla Mall Mamilla's shopping street The $150 million, pedestrian-only Mamilla shopping mall has been touted as a luxury destination in the style of Los Angeles' Rodeo Drive or The Grove. Its commercial space is leased at $40 to $80 per square metre to 140 businesses, including international names like Rolex, MAC, H. Stern, Nike, Polo Ralph Lauren, Nautica, bebe, and Tommy Hilfiger, as well as local chains like Castro, Ronen Chen,Ronen Chen Stores Steimatzky Books, and Cafe Rimon.

In 1982, along with Duane E. Webster, she wrote Preservation Planning Program: An Assisted Self-Study Manual for Libraries, a practical guide for an organized preservation program plan. Dartmouth College, the University of Washington, and the University of Virginia tested the ideas in the manual.

(27 May 2007) Darling also developed a method to prioritize preservation activities that she included in the manual. She created a grid containing four boxes to help determine which actions should be given the highest priority. Actions that have high impact and are easy to put into practice are put into Box 1; actions that are easy to put into practice but have little impact are put into Box 2; actions that have high impact but are hard to do are put into Box 3; and actions that are hard to do and have little impact are put into Box 4. According to Darling, the highest priority should be given to the actions in Box 1 since they have the highest impact and can be easily done. The actions in Box 3 should be accomplished because of their high impact. The actions in Box 2 and Box 4 could be eliminated since they both would have little impact.Ogden, Sherelyn. \\"Considerations for Prioritizing.\\" Preservation Leaflets. 2007. (27 May 2007).

Shot in Bristol, Connecticut and Springfield, Massachusetts, the film is based on one of biggest drug busts of Connecticut's Statewide Narcotics Task Force, including the arrest of David's longtime friend Kevin Toolen in 2001. Will Janowitz and Max Casella of The Sopranos fame star in the film, as do Dean Winters and David Zayas from Oz.  Plot  The story revolves around Michael \\"Little Man\\" McCarthy and the rise and fall of marijuana dealers from Bristol, Connecticut. \\"The film is about a group of working-class guys trying to get ahead by selling drugs,\\" said David, \\"and the value system they try to live by.\\"  Inspiration  Director/writer Brandon David based the movie on the events leading up to and following a months-long investigation by the Statewide Narcotics Task Force which resulted in the arrest of 21 people from Bristol, Plymouth, Southington, and Thomaston. David's friends Kevin Toolen and Miguel Rivera were arrested in the bust. David says he hoped to write on the experiences of his friends and himself while transporting marijuana with Toolen cross country. Several aspects of the movie are taken directly from the real life events, such as \\"Little Man\\" being ratted out by a trusted friend. \\"It is a shocking fact that a good friend of Kevin's was a DEA informant,\\" David said, which was another motivation to make the movie. David did take creative license on some realities, such as making \\"Little Man's\\" mother addicted to OxyContin and dying of an overdose. Toolen's mother died in 2000 but had been suffering from leukemia. Also, the police informant's death in the movie is fiction. \\"There was no murder, but if I were the guy that ratted everybody out, I'd be concerned,\\" said David. David denies the movie is an attack on Bristol. \\"The biggest message I want to get out is I didn't make a movie about Bristol. I made a movie about something that happened to people I know,\\" he said.

It is a lentic-breeding species similar to the Korean salamander (H. leechi) but is distinguished by factors including tail shape and dorsal coloration. The species is known from the vicinity of the type locality in Gijang County in northeastern Busan and from the nearby Ulju County in western Ulsan. Etymology The Kori salamander takes its common name from its type locality, Kori in Jangan-eup, Gijang County, in rural northern Busan. Its scientific name honours Suh-Yung Yang, a Korean herpetologist. Description Hynobius yangi males measure (n=18 individuals) and females in snout–vent length (n=3). Tail length is about 70–90% of snout–vent length. Males have relatively longer and higher tails than females. Dorsum is olive without dark speckles, or in some individuals, dark brownish dotted very finely with yellow speckles. The underside is lighter. Breeding occurs from late February to late March. Egg sacs are coil-shaped. Clutch size in one female was 86 eggs of about in diameter. Habitat and conservation Hynobius yangi inhabits hilly forest areas. Breeding takes place in still water in ditches. Egg sacs are attached to water plants or fallen branches. IUCN has assessed Hynobius yangi as \\"Endangered\\" because of its small distribution area and continuing habitat loss.

Background  Al-Anon defines itself as an independent fellowship with the stated purpose of helping relatives and friends of alcoholics. According to the organization, alcoholism is a family illness. Its \\"Preamble to the Twelve Steps\\" provides a general description: Not an intervention program, Al-Anon does not have the stated primary purpose of arresting another's compulsive drinking. Members meet in groups. Meetings are usually small (five to twenty-five); in larger meetings, members often split into smaller groups after the opening readings so everyone has a chance to speak. Many Al-Anon family group meetings begin with the \\"Suggested Al-Anon/Alateen Welcome\\", which starts:  History  Al- Anon was co-founded in 1951, 16 years after the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous on June 10, 1935, by Anne B. and Lois W. (wife of AA co-founder Bill W.). Before the formation of Al-Anon, independent groups of families of alcoholics met. \\"Bill thought the[se] groups could be consolidated and that Lois should be the one to take it on.\\" Al-Anon adopted the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous for their use \\"word for word with the exception of the Twelfth Step\\", changing the word \\"alcoholics\\" to \\"others\\" (\\"we tried to carry this message to others\\"). Its name derives from the first parts of the words \\"Alcoholics Anonymous\\". Alateen, part of Al-Anon, began in California in 1957 when a teenager named Bob \\"joined with five other young people who had been affected by the alcoholism of a family member.\\"  Purpose  Although people commonly turn to Al-Anon for help in stopping another's drinking, the organization recognizes that the friends and families of alcoholics are often traumatized themselves and in need of emotional support and understanding. According to Lois W.:  Benefits   Problems  Al-Anon/Alateen literature focuses on problems common to family members and friends of alcoholics such as excessive care-taking, an inability to differentiate between love and pity and loyalty to abusers, rather than the problems of the alcoholic. The organization acknowledges that members may join with low self- esteem, largely a side-effect of unrealistically overestimating their agency and control: attempting to control another person's drinking behavior and, when they fail, blaming themselves for the other person's behavior.  Improvement  Participation in Al-Anon has been associated with less personal blame by women who, as a whole, engage in more initial personal blame for the drinking than men. Family members of alcoholics begin to improve as they learn to recognize family pathology, assign responsibility for the pathology to a disease, forgive themselves, accept that they were adversely affected by the pathology and learn to accept their family members' shortcomings. Al-Anon members are encouraged to keep the focus on themselves, rather than on the alcoholic. Although members believe that changed attitudes can aid recovery, they stress that one person did not cause, cannot cure and cannot control another person's alcohol-related choices and behaviors.  Treatment of alcoholism  Al-Anon's primary purpose is to help families and friends of alcoholics, rather than stopping alcoholism in others or assisting with interventions. When an alcoholic's spouse is active in Al-Anon and the alcoholic is active in AA, the alcoholic is more likely to be abstinent, marital happiness is more likely to be increased and parenting by both is more likely to improve. A 1999 clinical analysis of methods used by concerned significant others (CSOs) to encourage alcoholics to seek treatment indicated that Al-Anon participation was \\"mostly ineffective\\" towards this goal. The psychologists found community reinforcement approach and family training (CRAFT) \\"significantly more\\" effective than Al-Anon participation in arresting alcoholism in others.  Demographics  In 2015, Al-Anon Family Groups published its 2015 Member Survey Results of demographic and other information from Al-Anon members in Canada and the United States Of the 8,517 respondents, 93 percent identified as white, 83 percent as female and 61 percent as married. 12 percent of the respondents had children under age 18 at home. \\"80 percent of respondents have been in a romantic relationship involving an alcoholic partner\\". And one side finding was that \\"40 percent of respondents initially joined Al-Anon because a person with a drug problem was negatively affecting their lives\\". For the 2006 Alateen Member Survey, conducted in the U.S., 139 Alateen members responded. Sixty-five percent of the respondents were female, 35 percent were male, 72 percent were white and 20 percent spoke Spanish fluently. The respondents' average age was 14.  Structure  Al- Anon/Alateen organizational structure The structure of Al-Anon Family Groups may be depicted as an inverted pyramid, with the organization's headquarters (the World Service Office) at the bottom and the \\"autonomous\\" groups at the top.  Groups Al-Anon and Alateen members meet in Groups for fellowship and support. Each Group may elect a Group Representative (GR) to represent a group at District meetings.https://al-anon.org/pdf/P24.pdf  Districts  Al-Anon and Alateen Groups Group Representatives (GRs) attend District meetings. At these meetings they discuss service activities, Group issues ( there primary purpose being to be a forum for Groups) and information from their Area and the World Service Office (WSO) of Al-Anon and Alateen, with GRs having voting privileges. A District may host regular events, such as workshops and speaker meetings, for the local fellowship.  Areas  An Area comprises several Districts. (For example, Texas is divided into two Al- Anon and Alateen Areas, East and West. Each Texas Area has about a dozen Al- Anon and Alateen Districts, for a total of about 24 in the state.) Each Area has regular meetings (known as Assemblies) where Group Representatives (GRs) meet and vote on issues impacting that Area, host workshops and speakers and get Area information to bring back to their Groups.In keeping with Al-Anon’s structure, only Group Representatives can vote on issues and officers here too.  World Service  At Area Assembly, GRs elect a Delegate to the annual World Service Conference (WSC). The WSC meets annually to interface with the World Service Office (WSO), which is managed by administrators and overseen by the Board of Trustees (who meet more regularly themselves).  Democracy and accountability  Al-Anon promotes democracy and accountability. According to one of its General Warranties of the Conference, \\"That though the Conference serves Al-Anon it shall never perform any act of government; and that like the fellowship of Al-Anon Family Groups which it serves, it shall always remain democratic in thought and action.\\" Another states \\"That no Conference member shall be placed in unqualified authority over other members.\\" According to Tradition Two of Al-Anon's Twelve Traditions: \\"Our leaders are but trusted servants—they do not govern.\\" Tradition Nine says: \\"Our groups, as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.\\" Districts and Areas are directly responsible to the Groups. The World Service Office (WSO) is accountable to the World Service Conference (WSC). The WSC is responsible to the Areas through elected Delegates and ultimately responsible to the Groups. According to Concept One of Al-Anon's Twelve Concepts of Service: \\"The ultimate responsibility and authority for Al-Anon world services belongs to the Al-Anon Groups.\\" In film When Love Is Not Enough: The Lois Wilson Story is a 2010 film about the wife of AA co-founder Bill Wilson and the beginnings of AA and Al-Anon.

Description Brehm's tiger parrot is the largest species in the genus Psittacella and is about in length and weighs between . It is mainly green with a dull olive- brown head, transverse yellow and black bars on the back and rump, and red undertail coverts. Its irises are red, and its beak is blueish-grey fading to white at the tip. Its legs are grey. The male has a yellow stripe on the sides of its neck and a green breast without barring.

MSCP Website The Melbourne School of Continental Philosophy (MSCP) is an institution dedicated to scholarly, extensive and engaged readings of key figures and texts in the history of modern European thought and contemporary discourse.MSCP Identity Statement The School was founded in 2003 and formalised its status as an independent, not-for-profit organisation in 2004. It is based in Melbourne, Australia and is housed by The University of Melbourne.  Formation and early years  In January 2002, Cameron Shingleton, Jon Roffe, Matt Sharpe and David Rathbone ran a summer school with four courses (on Nietzsche, on Deleuze, on Zizek and on Hegel, respectively) in the 1888 Building at the University of Melbourne. Sharpe had just finished his PhD on Zizek with Marion Tapper and John Rundell at Melbourne; Rathbone had returned to Melbourne from studies with Agnes Heller and Reiner Schurmann at the New School for Social Research in New York; Shingleton had completed his honours degree on Nietzsche in the German department; and Roffe his, in French. All four were of the opinion that the formalities of institutional academia alone were not sufficient to undertaking philosophical and critical thought. They thus formed the MSCP in the spirit of a guild of philosophers with the intention of preserving and fostering genuine intellectual engagement with continental philosophy. In 2003, they were joined by Sean Ryan, Craig Barrie, and Ashley Woodward, and later, Esther Anatolitis, Felicity Joseph, Jack Reynolds, Kate Noble, Alex Murray, Atliana Safich, Mark Tomlinson, Marc Hiatt, James Garrett, Bryan Cooke, Paul Daniels, Andrea Leon-Martino, and Sherah Bloor, all of whom have all been involved in various ways during the five years 2004-2009, running annual Summer and Winter Schools, as well as several conferences and research days.  Events and activities  Summer and Winter Schools The MSCP runs Summer and Winter Schools at the University of Melbourne during the university vacation breaks. Courses in the Schools consist of five two-hour lectures over a week and do not involve assessment or require any demonstrated prior knowledge of the topic in question. As the MSCP is a not-for-profit organisation, registration costs are minimal. MSCP courses seek a detailed and scholarly encounter with philosophical thinkers and themes. In particular, the courses attempt to promote constructive ways of engaging with philosophy which are not widely represented in contemporary academic discourse. The courses aim to locate philosophy in the context of its historical and cultural milieu, encouraging lively, academic debate, emphasising the interdisciplinary aspects of philosophy. Classes are informal but strive to be rigorous and faithful to the philosophers and texts being studied. Past courses have covered philosophers such as Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Lyotard, Derrida, Deleuze and Badiou. A series of courses has run over several Summer and Winter Schools entitled 'MSCP History of Philosophy Series' which assessed philosophy from the pre-Socratics to modern empiricism. Similar courses, treating a theme rather than a particular philosopher or text, have included 'Three Centuries of Aphorism' and 'Democracy, Elites and Violence'.MSCP past sessions Conferences The MSCP has run conferences including: * 2002 Australasian Society of Continental Philosophy conference at the University of Melbourne (the MSCP hosted this conference in conjunction with the Department of Philosophy at the University of Melbourne),ASCP 2002 conference held in December 2002 * 'Immanuel Kant Today', commemorating the 200th anniversary of the death of Immanuel Kant,Immanuel Kant Today conference held in February 2004 * 'Sensorium', a conference on philosophy and aesthetics, held in June 2005 * 'Sartre Colloquium' which included a performance of Huis Clos (held in conjunction with the Department of French, Italian and Spanish Studies and the Department of Philosophy), held in October 2005 * '200 Years of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit',\\"200 Years of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit\\" held in July 2007 Research days The MSCP has initiated a series of research days where philosophers in a particular field converge on a specific topic and workshop their papers together. So far, \\"Spinoza and the Infinite\\", convened by Jon Roffe was held in December 2005 and was attended by Justin Clemens, Simon Duffy, Minna Koivuniemi and Jon Roffe.'Spinoza and the Infinite' research day Parrhesia An International Journal of Critical Philosophy. Parrhesia Journal  Parrhesia Journal  Parrhesia: A Journal of Critical Philosophy is an international journal of Critical Philosophy affiliated with MSCP. It is edited by four MSCP members: Alex Murray, Matthew Sharpe, Jon Roffe and Ashley Woodward.Parrhesia Journal websiteNational Library of Australia entry for Parrhesia Journal It was launched in 2006 and has included articles by Alain Badiou and Jacques Rancière.Rancière, Jacques, \\"Thinking between disciplines: an aesthetics of knowledge,\\" trans.

The MSCP office is located in this building. During 2004, the founding Convenor, Jon Roffe, negotiated an informal relationship between the MSCP and the Philosophy Department with Chris Cordner (then Head of the Philosophy Department).Link to the MSCP via the School of Philosophy website This allowed the MSCP to undertake its activities using an office in the Department and University of Melbourne resources and teaching spaces. Late 2004, the MSCP invited Dr Marion Tapper of the University of Melbourne Philosophy Department to become a member. This merely formalised her involvement as she had always been supportive of the MSCP both philosophically and on account of knowing all of its members personally from teaching and supervision.Marion Tapper, School of Philosophy staff profile One way in which the MSCP attempts to transcend its university boundaries is by seeking new ways to teach and engage with philosophy. In particular, MSCP events strive to be both informal and rigorous. With their courses offering no credit or assessment, students who attend are usually there for the joy of philosophy and seek to further their own intellects outside of a formal classroom setting. Being a not-for-profit organisation, the MSCP charges a minimum for its courses; again, this is aimed at transcending the current economic climate of university funding.  Membership  New members are typically recommended by current members and, largely because the organisation was founded by postgraduate students, they are usually honours year or postgraduate students themselves.

The main criticism is that the many ideas that Frenay describes sometime seem to lack a common thread.\\" Philosophical and/or political views Frenay sought to convey a history of technological development through a machine age into a period that is just beginning which he regarded as a new biological age of technology in which computer memory will be based on DNA, computer software will work according to the logic of human emotions, human systems and human inventions will meld into a new biology based relationship. His book advocated recycling of all waste, greater control of corporations to prevent pollution and waste, government support of environment-based technology development. His view was a positive vision of future industrial, military, agricultural and commercial technological developments. While the basis of his book was a single idea, he reflected that idea throughout history, cultural philosophy, technological change and invention as he \\"charted the shift from machines to biology bolstered by computers: a type of 'new biology' in which human systems and machines meld to form new possibilities\\". On his website, Frenay wrote \\"PULSE is a book of ideas, a philosophy disguised as pop science. While it offers gee-whiz stories about cutting-edge technology, these stories are also meant as parables. Like Aesop's fables, they aim to illustrate something more—in this case the core dynamics of how living systems work\\". Frenay also sought to describe a mode of invention, a mentality of human development based in discovery of humanity's natural, evolutionary direction and modality rather than purely atavistic or profit-motivated industrial development. He didn't describe this mode of development as a vision of a possible way of becoming a future human civilization but rather sought to demonstrate that this was the inevitable refined direction of human development. \\"According to Frenay, humanity is on the cusp of a new evolutionary change, where we are likely to see emotional computers, ships that move like swimming fish, and accelerated evolution.\\" Shortly after the publication of Pulse in April, 2006, Frenay was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and succumbed to the disease, passing away on Jan 26, 2007.

Evetts Haley, was a Texas-born political activist and historian who wrote multiple works on the American West, including an enduring biography of cattleman Charles Goodnight. Haley determined Goodnight to have been a man of greatness and claimed that Goodnight's detractors were less-than-successful persons envious of Goodnight's achievement and bearing. His political views were ultraconservative. Early years and education Haley was born to John Alva Haley and the former Julia (née Evetts) Haley in Belton, Texas on July 5, 1901. In 1906, Haley's family moved to Midland, Texas where his father operated a hardware store then a hotel. Haley worked as a rancher and as a young man competed in popular rodeos. He graduated from Midland High School and West Texas A&M; University (then known as West Texas Normal College) in Canyon, the seat of Randall County in the Palo Duro Canyon country south of Amarillo. After he received his Bachelor of Arts degree in history, Haley was named field secretary of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Society in Canyon, which operates the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum, the largest Western history institution of its kind in Texas. Haley drove a Model T to various homes and businesses in the Panhandle and asked for historical materials for donation to the museum. In 1928, by which time Timothy Dwight Hobart, a noted land surveyor from Pampa, was the president of the historical society, Haley said that the materials accumulated were rich and broad: \\"The foundation is laid. I trust the superstructure we raise will be commensurate with the possibilities.\\"Lester Fields Sheffy, The Life and Times of Timothy Dwight Hobart, 1855–1935: Colonization of West Texas (Panhandle-Plains Historical Society, 1950), pp. 282-283. For the Goodnight biography and other works, Haley employed as his illustrator the artist Harold Dow Bugbee, former curator of the museum. In his work of gathering historical information, Haley interviewed nearly seven hundred pioneers, including Goodnight, with whom he developed a personal friendship. He obtained his Master of Arts degree from the University of Texas at Austin, where he studied under Texas history specialist Eugene C. Barker and wrote a thesis on early Texas cattle trails. He taught at UT from 1929 to 1936 and claimed that he was unjustly dismissed because of his opposition to the New Deal: \\"I was fired because of my vigorous fight against the insidious invasion of socialistic federal power.\\" Family On August 27, 1928, Haley married the former Mary Vernita \\"Nita\\" Stewart in Alpine, the seat of Brewster County. An educator who, like her husband, graduated from West Texas A&M;, Nita was born in Longview in Gregg County in East Texas. She was descended and orphaned from trail drivers. The couple had one son, Evetts Haley Jr. Nita died of ovarian cancer on December 20, 1958. On May 31, 1970, the Protestant Haley married a divorced Roman Catholic, former debutante Rosalind \\"Ros\\" Kress (July 21, 1910 – April 23, 2008), an heiress in the Kress family who was born in New York City and raised at the Kress family plantation in South Carolina, near Savannah, Georgia. Rosalind had three sons from her first marriage in 1935 to Charles Wesley Frame of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Alexander M. \\"Sandy\\" Frame of New York City, Peter C. Frame of Tazewell, Virginia, and Christopher K. Frame of Savannah. Her father, Claude W. Kress, owned the Kress Variety Stores (not to be confused with The S.S. Kresge Company, the forerunner to K-Mart). Haley met Rosalind through their mutual involvement in the Goldwater campaign though she had originally been a Roosevelt supporter while he had been organizing voters against Roosevelt. She died at 97 from complications from a stroke and is buried in her paternal family plot in Savannah. Haley, meanwhile, is buried beside Nita in the Moffat Cemetery in Bell County. Legacy Haley endowed his Nita Stewart Haley Memorial Library (established 1958) and the J. Evetts Haley History Center (established 1976) at 1805 West Indiana in Midland. The facilities are privately maintained and not affiliated with a university. They are dedicated to the preservation of America's western heritage. The library houses more than 25,000 books, manuscripts, and other printed materials documenting western history. Since 2002 it houses the collection of papers (letters, diaries, etc.) held by the closed Texas Confederate Museum. The Haley Centers attempt to find common thread among the cowboy, the range cattle industry, the military presence, and the railroads. Haley was also instrumental in the development of the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. Also is the Rosalind Kress Haley Library, Inc., affiliated with Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum at 7800 Bonhomme Avenue in St. Louis. Bill Modisett of Midland has published a biography of Haley, J. Evetts Haley: A True Texas Legend, through Staked Plains Press. In his introduction to Modisett's book, the Western novelist Elmer Kelton of San Angelo writes: \\"History will probably be kinder to J. Evetts Haley than many of his contemporaries have been. History has always favored the leaders, the individualists who blazed their own trails and lived by their own lights, those who chose to be out in front–alone if necessary–rather than simply fit in with the crowd. Not even his detractors could ever accuse Evetts Haley of being one of the crowd.\\" In 1990, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Congressional and gubernatorial races In 1948, Haley ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for Texas's 18th congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives. He polled 6,266 votes (11.3%) to the incumbent Democrat Eugene Worley, who received 48,985 ballots (88.7 percent). Two years later in May 1950, another Republican, Ben H. Guill was elected to Congress from the 18th District with 23% of the vote (before majorities were required to win special elections in Texas). Guill was defeated narrowly by Walter E. Rogers in November 1950.Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections U.S. House elections, p. 1140 In 1956, Haley ran unsuccessfully as a conservative Democrat for governor of Texas. During the campaign, Haley urged a halt to price controls on natural gas. He approached George Berham Parr, the political boss based in Duval County in South Texas, and told Parr that if he became governor, \\"it will be my pleasure to lock you up.\\" Haley vowed, if elected, to use the Texas Rangers to enforce continued segregation of public schools in the aftermath of Brown v. Board of Education. Haley finished a distant fourth in the primary balloting with 88,772 votes (5.6 percent). The leading candidates were then U.S. Senator Price Daniel, of Liberty, and future US Senator Ralph Yarborough of Austin. In the runoff election, Daniel, considered a moderate conservative edged out the liberal Yarborough, 50.1% to 49.9%. Yarborough then won the special election held in 1957 to fill the remaining months of the Senate term to which Daniel was originally elected in 1952.Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections, Governor returns, 1956 Critic of Roosevelt and Johnson In a meeting at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas, Haley had organized, with financial assistance from Orville Bullington, the 1932 Republican gubernatorial nominee, a short-lived third party, the \\"Jeffersonian Democrats of Texas\\", to offer opposition to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal within Texas. In 1964, Haley returned to his previous Republican affiliation to endorse then U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, who was challenging President Johnson but fared poorly in Texas. A Texan Looks at Lyndon: A Study in Illegitimate Power Haley's self-published paperback A Texan Looks at Lyndon: A Study in Illegitimate Power was released in 1964. The book has been described as portraying \\"Johnson as a vain and vicious man whose climb to the presidency was wrought with malevolence on every rung of the ladder.\\" Haley stated that Johnson \\"accepted second place for money\\" and suggested that he was involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Although 100,000 copies of the book were initially printed, sales increased dramatically prior to the 1964 presidential election. At a cost of $0.30 to $0.50 per book, bulk orders by the John Birch Society and supporters of Barry Goldwater pushed sales to 50,000 copies per day by late August. A Texan Looks at Lyndon eventually sold 7.5 million copies to become the most successful political book of all time. Houston Harte, a newspaper publisher in San Angelo, who supported Johnson, said that his friend Haley had gone to the extreme in writing A Texan Looks at Lyndon: \\"Haley can no longer be considered a serious historian,\\" Harte claimed. Historical works In 1929, Haley published The XIT Ranch of Texas and the Early Days of the Llano Estacado. Accused of libel in a dozen lawsuits, Haley was compelled in 1931 to withdraw the book from circulation and to pay the plaintiffs $17,500 to settle all pending claims. The XIT Ranch, based in Dalhart, covered parts of ten counties in the Texas Panhandle and West Texas. The book was later returned to circulation. In 1937, Haley became manager of the Zeebar Cattle Company in Arizona. He also purchased a small ranch of his own in Hutchinson County near Borger in the northern Panhandle. He owned another ranch near Sequoyah, Oklahoma. He also managed the Atarque and Clochintoh ranches in New Mexico. On the death of his father, he inherited the Haley Ranch in Loving and Winkler counties. In 1943, he published George W. Littlefield, Texan, a biography of cattleman George W. Littlefield for whom the city of Littlefield in Lamb County is named. He followed with Charles Schreiner about the Hill Country rancher and landowner Charles Schreiner Sr. (1944), Jeff Milton, A Good Man with a Gun (1948), and Fort Concho and the Texas Frontier (1952), a reference to an early fortification in San Angelo. Other Haley works include the following: *The Alamo Mission Bell *Diary of Michael Erskine *A Cowman's Comment on Art *Life on the Texas Range *Personal Justice on the Arizona Desert *Rough Times - Tough Fiber *When School Was Out *F.

One speaker [J. Evetts Haley], to the delight of the crowd, complained that the chairman of the meeting had turned moderate: 'All he wants to do is to impeach [Chief Justice of the United States Earl] Warren — I'm for hanging him.'\\" (p. 753, Thousand Days) Haley was a friend of Clayton Wheat Williams Sr., the rancher, oilman, geologist, and historian from Fort Stockton, whose son, Clayton Wheat Williams Jr., was the unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial nominee in 1990. A picture of Clayton Williams Sr. and his wife the former Chicora Lee Graham hangs in the Haley Museum. In 2013, the West Texas A&M; University Alumni Association posthumously designated Haley as one of three recipients of its annual \\"Distinguished Alumnus Award.\\" The association noted: > History was his passion ... he received a bachelor's degree from WTAMU in > the subject he loved so much.

She is known internationally for her political and often controversial documentary film work as well as her activism within the global feminism and lesbian rights movements. She has collaborated with many well- known artists and activists, and public figures across the world. Parmar specifically uses the camera to benefit women worldwide. Focusing her lens on disenfranchised communities and peoples internationally, her contribution to worldwide humanitarian rights and education has been crucial. Her films are marked by political complexity and visual richness, taking up the themes of women's strength, racial and cultural oppression and the lives of South Asian LGBT people. She is well known for drawing on humour, wit, women's everyday lives and visionary storytelling to articulate the realities and dreams of feminist, LGBT women and South Asian diasporic life. Her works typically center around the themes of gender, identity, LGBT issues, race, feminism, and creativity.alicewalkerfilm.com Parmar aims to narrate and depict untold stories and experiences of traditionally marginalized and underrepresented groups such as African-American women in the 1970s, survivors of female genital mutilation, and misrepresented gay communities in Southeast Asia. In particular, Parmar's award-winning documentary Warrior Marks (1993), made in collaboration with Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Alice Walker (author of The Color Purple), located Parmar deep within multiple conversations about globalization and women's responsibilities to other women. Parmar went on to co-publish Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women\\"Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women\\" at Amazon. with Walker. Parmar has also made music videos for Morcheeba, Tori Amos, Ghostlands and Midge Ure. In the fall of 2007, Pratibha Parmar was awarded the Visionary Award by the One in Ten Film Festival for her entire body of work and she is a past winner of the San Francisco Frameline Film Festival Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2016, she was listed as one of BBC's 100 Women.  Biography  Early life Parmar was born in Nairobi, Kenya. Her family moved to Britain, where she grew up. She received her B.A. from Bradford University and attended Birmingham University for postgraduate studies at the Cultural Studies Centre. The Parmar family emigrated from India to East Africa during the time of the British Empire. Parmar's family migrated to London, England, as part of the mass exodus from East Africa of \\"East African Asians\\", as the British media termed this group at the time. Parmar's work is imbued with her strong identification with her working-class roots and a worldview influenced by her family status as three-time immigrants on three continents. Her sensitivity to the colonization of others is firmly rooted in her own heritage as part of a people persecuted by class, race and sex. She examines the intersection of the three in her work as both a filmmaker and writer. Pratibha was precocious and showed early talent in scholastic matters and had an avid interest in social justice. She attended the University of Bradford, earning a B.A. with honours in Human Purposes and Communications. While at the university, Parmar took leadership positions in student politics. She was Chair of the Anti-Fascist Committee, which organized various actions against local fascist groups including marches, fundraisers and Rock Against Racism concerts. She was also very interested in working with women and spent three months in Calcutta working with Mother Teresa.\\"Pratibha Parmar\\" , Sawnet. Parmar stayed for a year in India teaching basic literacy skills to children in village projects in Uttar Pradesh (North India) and Kerala (in the South). After completing her undergraduate degree, Parmar did post-graduate studies at the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies. While there, she co-wrote and co-edited the groundbreaking book The Empire Strikes Back – Race and Racism in 1970s Britain\\"Empire Strikes Back – Race and Racism in 1970s Britain\\" at Amazon. (1982). That book, co-authored with Paul Gilroy and Valerie Amos among others, challenged the then-current academic paradigm of race and race relations as problems embedded in communities of colour rather than problems within society and its institutions creating, codifying and enforcing racism. The Empire Strikes Back is also one of the first texts authored primarily by Black and Asian writers questioning that theory expressed and (re)enforced in academic literature in the 1970s and '80s. During the 1980s, Parmar also worked with Sheba Feminist Press as an editor and publisher. Sheba was the only British press to publish writers such as African-American poet Audre Lorde.Ranjani Saigal, \\"In Conversation With Pratibha Parmar\\", Lokvani, 28 May 2007. After graduation from the university, Parmar worked as a Youth and Community Worker with young South Asian women. It was in this environment she discovered the power of mass media to change and challenge stereotypes of minority people. She then decided to learn the tools of filmmaking. Subsequently, she was asked to work as a researcher/consultant on a pioneering documentary series for the newly formed Channel 4 in Britain profiling Black and Asian communities in the UK. Early career Pratibha Parmar began her filmmaking career working in documentary. Aesthetically, the reworking Parmar offered the film world of the definition of poetry in relationship to cinema marked her signature. Emergence (1986) and Sari Red (1988) both raised awareness about Black and Third World women's artistic sensibility in regard to London city streets. With Khush (1991), Parmar examined the erotic world of South Asian queers. Khush means ecstatic pleasure in Urdu. For South Asian lesbians and gay men in Britain, North America, and India, the term captures the blissful intricacies of being queer and of colour. Inspiring testimonies bridge geographical differences to locate shared experiences of isolation and exoticisation but also the unremitting joys and solidarity of being khush. The release of A Place of Rage (1991), a documentary about African-American women's role in the civil rights movement, marked a critical turning point in Parmar's career. The film was named Best Historical Documentary by the National Black Programming Consortium in the U.S. and received broad international critical acclaim.\\"Pratibha Parmar\\", Women Make Movies. Her other documentary credits include The Righteous Babes and A Brimful of Asia. Drama credits include Sita Gita, Wavelengths and Memsahib Rita. Reaching a broader audience Parmar's debut feature film, Nina's Heavenly Delights, saw its theatrical release in mainstream theatres across the United Kingdom on 2006 and United States in 2007. The film won the Wolfe Award for Best Feature film at the Fresno Film Festival along with Best Feature film at Cineffable (France) and Best International Feature film at the Tampa International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. Since then, her interests have diversified within the filmmaking realm and Parmar is currently pursuing universal topics with an eye trending toward a broader audience. Part of her impetus is simply the nature of increased global awareness about and evolving tolerance of, acceptance for and interest in women's and queers rights. However, Parmar's works retain her trademark heightened political consciousness, artistic edge and inventive and inspired storytelling. Parmar has been a Board member and is currently an active member of Women in Film and Television (UK), the Directors Guild of Great Britain, and a BAFTA voting member. In 2001, she founded Kali Films, a film and television production company creating feature films, documentaries and music videos. The company works with material and subject matter that is entertaining, thought provoking, intelligent and aesthetically stunning. Parmar's films continue to screen to sold-out shows internationally. Through Kali Films, she is working on several projects including Diversity in Motion, a short documentary showcasing selected children living in the five 2012 Olympic boroughs, and Windows into Our World – Creative Director and Consultant to Di Fie Foe, enabling the production of seven student-led short videos for the Welcoming The World 2012 Olympics Project. In May 2011, Parmar began shooting a documentary called Beauty in Truth about the life of Alice Walker.\\"Filmmakers\\", Beauty in Truth.

The definition states that type 22 tobacco is a type of fire-cured tobacco, known as Eastern District fire-cured, produced principally in a section east of the Tennessee River in southern Kentucky and northern Tennessee. Most type 22 tobacco in northern Tennessee is grown in Robertson and Montgomery County.

Healthy Skepticism was founded in 1983 with the name Medical Lobby for Appropriate Marketing (MaLAM). It was begun by an Australian medical student, Peter R. Mansfield, who had the idea for the organization during his final year elective in Bangladesh in 1982. MaLAM initially focused on campaigning against questionable marketing practices in developing countries. These included the promotion of appetite stimulants, tonics and anabolic steroids to parents of malnourished children. MaLAM was modelled on Amnesty International and wrote open letters to the international headquarters of pharmaceutical companies questioning them about specific advertisements. MaLAM letters were signed by supporters around the world and contributed to many improvements in drug marketing, several products being removed from the market and many advertising claims changed.Cullen, W.R. (2008) \\"Is Arsenic an Aphrodisiac?: The Sociochemistry of an Element\\" London: Royal Society of Chemistry (Great Britain) p. 19 MaLAM reported more than 450 alleged violations of the voluntary code of conduct of the drug industry in 1987, and also questioned drug advertisements in Australia during 1993 to 1997 with funding from the Australian federal government. In 2001, the organisation’s name was changed to Healthy Skepticism and its work widened to include research, education and advocacy about misleading drug promotion in all countries. It has concentrated recently on raising awareness amongst health professionals of the influence that marketing techniques have on their decisions, and the psychological factors which make them vulnerable to that influence.See, for example: References Category:Pharmaceutical industry Category:Medical and health organisations based in Australia ","title":"Healthy Skepticism"},{"id":"11691368","text":"Crystal Meth Anonymous (CMA) is a California-based non-profit, public-benefit corporation founded in 1994 working as a twelve-step program of recovered and recovering crystal meth addicts. Participants in local groups meet in order to help others recover from methamphetamine addiction. CMA advocates complete abstinence from methamphetamine, alcohol, inhalants, and all other psychoactive drugs not taken as prescribed.  History and demographics  CMA was founded on September 16, 1994 in West Hollywood, California by Bill Coffey, a member of the 12 step recovery community in Los Angeles for over two decades at the time. The first group held its first meeting at the West Hollywood Alcohol and Drug Center, for which Bill Coffey was on the board of directors. , CMA had a presence in over 100 metropolitan areas of the United States, as well as parts of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Iran. The first CMA World Service Conference was held in Park City, Utah in October 2008, during which the CMA Charter was adopted. The purpose of the conference is to bring together elected delegates from CMA groups from across the world to meet as guardians of the world services and of the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of CMA, the same Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions followed by Alcoholics Anonymous. The conference does not act as a governing body of CMA, but rather as the service body for the organization. At the first General Service Conference, the delegates adopted that: > The Fellowship of Crystal Meth Anonymous works a Twelve Step program of > recovery. We have not felt the need to elaborate in great detail a specific > CMA approach to the Twelve Steps: too many other excellent outlines already > exist for following these spiritual principles. But our experience has shown > that without the Steps we could not stay sober. In 2002, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimated 12 million people, age 12 and over, had used methamphetamine—600,000 of which were estimated to be current users—with a growth rate of approximately 300,000 new users per year. In 2005, a Los Angeles clinic estimated that one out of three gay or bisexual HIV-positive men admitted to using methamphetamine. Methamphetamine lowers a user's inhibitions, increasing the likelihood of engaging in unprotected sex and sharing needles. In large metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, Chicago, Miami and Washington, D.C., many CMA groups are designated as gay, or are ' gay. As CMA's popularity grew, the growth of meetings spread to large non-gay communities such as those in Phoenix and Minneapolis.  Effectiveness  A self-selected study limited to men who had sex with other men, used meth, and attended CMA, showed that, after three months of participation in CMA, participants reported their number of sexual partners had fallen from seven to less than one, and self-reports of unprotected anal intercourse when using methamphetamine fell by two-thirds. In a six-month follow-up, 20% had used it again once and 64% had remained abstinent.

The Rebels play in the six-team B.C. Football Conference, which itself is part of the Canadian Junior Football League (CJFL) and competes annually for the national title known as the Canadian Bowl. The club has operated continuously since the late 1960s in Victoria, having previously been known as the Sharks, Payless, and the Hornets. The Rebels were founded in 1985 as the Victoria Payless, and were the BCFL champions in 2003.  History   Victoria Dolphins  Victoria's contribution to the BCJFA officially began in 1971 when the Victoria Dolphins were admitted to the league. Under the direction of \\"Mr. Football\\", head coach Frank Hindle, they finished a very successful first year ending in third place with 3-3-1. The next season 1972, the team grabbed second spot behind the powerful Vancouver Meralomas, but unfortunately were defeated in the first ever BCJFA semi-final game, held in Victoria, by the North Shore Cougars. The Dolphins participated in the BCJFA from 1971 until 1979. In addition to Frank Hindle, who coached the team in 1971, '72, and '77, other Dolphin head coaches included Roy Vollinger (1973), Ken Werrun (1974, '75 and '76), Brian Gingell (1978), and Paul Shortt (1979). In 1979 Kym Clarke was the BCFC MVP. Following 1979 season the Dolphins ceased to be a part of the BCJFA.  Victoria Hornets  In 1985, the Victoria Hornets, who had been dominating the BCJFA Tier II league (players 18–20 years of age) under coach Frank Hindle, and were provincial champions in 1983 and '84, moved up and again became full members of the BCJFA at the Tier I level (players aged 22 and under).  Victoria Payless  In 1985 the team then became known as Victoria Payless (Payless Gas stepped in and sponsored the team, which helped cover the costs of playing at the new level). This first year back in junior was also the final year of coaching for Frank Hindle. The team managed a respectable fourth-place finish and grabbed the last playoff spot. However, were defeated in the semi-final game by the Richmond Raiders. Darryl Brassard, Bill Grant, Ted Leonard, Dan McLean and Murray Smith were named BCJFL All-Stars. A new head coach, Doug Ferne, took over in 1985 and the team failed to make the playoffs in '86, but with hard work by Doug and his staff in the off season, the 1987 team had a great year and finished in second place behind BC champs Okanagan Sun. This 1987 Payless club, for the first time in 15 years, hosted a BCJFA semi-final game against the Richmond Raiders, but were upset in a heart-breaker. In 1987 Ian Gordon was named the CJFL Outstanding Defensive player. Midway through the 1988 season coach Ferne stepped down and the head coaching role was assumed by Paul Shortt, who continued through until 1993. During Shortt's reign, Payless made the play- offs four of the six seasons. The four play-off years were from 1990-93. In 1990 Troy Francis was the CJFL top defensive player and 1992 Simon Beckow was named the CJFL top offensive player.  Vancouver Island Sharks  In 1994, Payless Gas withdrew their sponsorship of the team, and the team name was changed to the Vancouver Island Sharks. The new head coach was Rod Outhwaite, and although they finished in last place, the foundation was laid for a new era of football. 1995 saw new coach, Gerry Hornett, take over, and for the two years in which Gerry was the boss, the team registered identical records and fourth-place finishes. In 1997, the Sharks fielded a team half made up of rookies, and under new head coach John Hugi, who had been an assistant coach with the team for 6 years.  Victoria Rebels  During the off-season John Cardillicha was appointed head coach, and the team again changed its name and colours to reflect the new direction John wanted to take them. The 1998 Rebels improved steadily throughout the season, and finished in third place with a 6–4 record. While they lost in the first round of the playoffs, the season had to be considered a success, and the Rebels were looking forward to even better things in the future. 1999 brought more success with a second-place finish due to a 6–3-1 record and a CJFL defensive player MVP in Scott Gilbert (Mennie). After a promising win, the Rebels were out played by the Okanagan Sun in their first ever BCFC final. The 2000 season resulted in a 7–3 record and another CJFL defensive player MVP, thanks to the play of Mike Kissinger. The Rebels played the Okanagan Sun and lost in over-time and missed advancing to the Canadian Bowl by a 38–43 score. John Cardillichia stepped down as head coach at the end of the 2002 season, Matt Bloker who had been an assistant coach assumed the head coaching role, and coached for 2003 and 2004 season before the team was moved to Nanaimo and renamed the Vancouver Island Raiders. On November 4, 2004 the club announced that the team's Board of Directors voted to move operations of the team to the city of Nanaimo for the 2005 season and beyond. However, at a special general meeting of the Vancouver Island Junior Football Society on December 21, the society reversed the vote to relocate to Nanaimo. The society then replaced the executive and board of directors with a new board of volunteers, and vowed to stay in Victoria. Paul Orizatti assumed the head coach role and in 2005 helped start a new Rebels organization from the bottom floor up, and continued on as head coach until the end of the 2008 season. In 2009 John Cardilicchia once again came on board as the coach of the Rebels and continued until 2012.  Westshore Rebels  During the 2010 off- season the Rebels changed its name to Westshore Rebels to encompass a re- branding and relocation to newly built Westhills Stadium. In 2013 Scott Mennie took over as head coach, and then had to step down before the start of the season. Tim Kearse stepped in as the interim head coach for the season and in 2014 Andrew Axhorn took over the helm as head coach for the season. On March 4, 2011, the team was re-branded as the Westshore Rebels, as the team had played in the township of Langford for the previous two seasons. The team announced that they would continue playing their home games out of Bear Mountain Stadium.http://www.hometeamsonline.com/teams/default.asp?u=FOOTBALLBCFC&t;=c&s;=football&p;=newsstory&newsID;=26360 In 2014 the Canadian Junior Football League recognized the 2014 Rebels as having the Top Executive in Canadian Junior Football, led by Team President Elise Pastro.

He is the chairman and chief executive officer of MOBY Group, launched in Afghanistan in 2002 and now active across South and Central Asia and the Middle East. Prior to establishing Moby Group, he headed the equities and corporate finance division of an Australian investment banking firm. Early life  Mohseni was born on 23 April 1966 in London, United Kingdom, where his father, Yassin Mohseni, was serving as an Afghan diplomat. Yassin Mohseni served in Kabul, Washington, DC, London, Islamabad, and Tokyo during his 25-year career. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Yassin Mohseni, then serving in Tokyo, resigned from the diplomatic corps and sought asylum. The family relocated to Australia in 1982. Mohseni has two younger brothers, Zaid and Jahid Mohseni, and younger sister Wajma. Mohseni began his banking career as an apprentice at an Australian funds management entity, and later became a commodities and derivatives trader in Melbourne, Sydney, and London, culminating in the management of a trading desk of an Australian investment bank. Return to Afghanistan and launch of media company  After the removal of the Taliban government in late 2001, Mohseni and his brothers returned to Afghanistan to participate in the country's reconstruction and launch MOBY Group. They entered the media arena in 2003 by establishing Arman FM, the country's first privately owned radio station. Arman played Western and Afghan pop music, which was groundbreaking after years of Taliban rule, in which all music, television, and independent news had been banned. In 2004, MOBY Group launched TOLO TV, which airs international soap operas, The Voice Afghanistan, Afghan Star, and locally produced dramas. In addition to TOLO TV, MOBY also owns TOLOnews and Lemar TV, a Pashto-language channel. MOBY channels are viewed by over 60 percent of Afghans.http://www.mobygroup.com/news/97-news-2014/1165-moby-group-tv- channels-continue-to-lead-the-afghan-market-with-a-combined-audience-share- of-62 MOBY Group's regional expansion  In 2009, MOBY launched Farsi1, a general-entertainment satellite channel targeting Persian speakers in the Middle East and West Asia.http://www.mobygroup.com/buisnesses/media/broadcast/farsi1 In 2014, MOBY launched LANA TV in Iraq, the first satellite channel to dub shows into the local Iraqi dialect.http://www.mobygroup.com/news/97-news-2014/1198-nothing- like-it-the-launch-of-lana-tv MOBY Group now owns 17 businesses operating in seven markets across South and Central Asia and the Middle East, spanning television, radio, production, strategic communications, and digital platforms.

History The plant was originally built by Stone and Webster in 1906. One of the first reinforced concrete structures on the U.S. West Coast, it originally provided power for the Interurban Railway between Seattle and Tacoma; it also provided both direct current for Seattle's streetcars and alternating current for Georgetown, then an independent city. They purchased General Electric steam turbine technology, based on patents originally held by inventor Charles Gordon Curtis. At the time, this was cutting edge technology, and the Georgetown Steam Plant \\"marks the beginning of the end of the reciprocating steam engine\\" as the dominant mode of generating electricity on a large scale.Georgetown Powerplant Museum brochure. Workers at the plant, 1909 Originally located along an oxbow of the Duwamish River to provide cooling water, the plant was left inland after the original river channel was straightened in 1917. Retired after nearly 75 years of operation, it remains \\"surprisingly complete and operable\\". The plant has three Curtis turbines, manufactured by the General Electric Company between 1906 and 1917.ASME Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmarks #45, accessed online 25 August 2007. Puget Sound Traction and Lighting Company (now Puget Sound Energy) bought the Seattle Electric Company in 1912; the Georgetown Steam Plant powered the Seattle-to-Tacoma Interurban and Seattle streetcars; it also provided residential and industrial power to Georgetown. Originally an oil-fired plant, it converted to a coal in 1917. As hydropower was developed in the 1910s and 1920s the steam plant became uncompetitive and only used for emergencies. It last produced electricity in January 1953 when water levels at the dams were low. Decommissioning took place in 1972. Landmark and museum The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1984, and is also designated by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers as a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark. At the time of its landmarking, it contained the \\"last operating examples of the world's first large scale, steam turbine\\". The building itself, \\"built by a fast-track construction process, was designed and supervised by Frank W. Gilbreth, later a nationally famous proponent of efficiency engineering.\\" The building is also a Seattle City LandmarkLandmarks Alphabetical Listing for G , Individual Landmarks, Department of Neighborhoods, City of Seattle.

Inside the plant, 2008 Paul Carosino and Lilly Tellefson founded the Georgetown PowerPlant Museum in 1995 to restore, maintain and operate the plant. It now teaches boiler firemen and steam engineers. The plant remains owned by Seattle City Light, the city's public electric utility. Since 2014 it has opened to the general public once a month, from 10am to 2pm on the second Saturday of each month. The plant houses the last operable examples of early vertical Curtis steam generating turbines, as well as operational reciprocating steam engines, a collection of vintage machining tools, and several smaller steam engines.

SCA founding is attributed variously to 1982 in New York City and to 1973 in Los Angeles. Although the fellowship originally sought to address issues of sexual compulsion among gay and bisexual men, and this is still the fellowships predominant demographic, today the program is LGBT friendly, open to all sexual orientations, and there is an increasing number of women and heterosexual men participating. SCA meetings are most likely to be held in urban areas with larger gay and bisexual male populations. The majority of members are white, but vary in age and socioeconomic background. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop having compulsive sex.  Sexual recovery plans  A sample of a (blank) SCA recovery plan document SCA supports healthy sexual expression and does not expect members to repress their sexuality, which they believe is associated with sexual anorexia. Members are encouraged to develop their own definition of sexual sobriety that does not place unreasonable demands on their time or energy, place them in legal jeopardy, or endanger their health. SCA members incorporate their definition of sexual sobriety into what they call a sexual recovery plan. Sexual recovery plans are modeled on the work of Patrick Carnes, a sexual addiction researcher, based on the model for Overeaters Anonymous (OA), whose members create individualized \\"food plans.\\" Sexual recovery plans have three columns: abstinence, high-risk, and recovery—analogous to the three circles used in Sex Addicts Anonymous. The sexual recovery plan is used as a blueprint for recovery. The abstinence column includes \\"bottom-line\\" behaviors corresponding to relapse and from which members ask their Higher Power to be freed. The high-risk column includes behaviors, emotional states, ritualized activities, and situations that make them vulnerable to relapse. The recovery column includes positive behaviors that support their wellbeing and meet their needs in a healthy manner.  Literature and publications  SCA distributes its own literature, including the primary book used in the fellowship, Sexual Compulsives Anonymous: A Program of Recovery, and several book-length and smaller brochures and pamphlets, such as What About Masturbation?, Q&A;: A Guide for Newcomers and Secret Shame. Parts of these brochures are published on the SCA website. SCA also publishes an online journal known as The SCAnner.    * SCA developed \\"The Twenty Questions,\\" an instrument allowing potential members to self-evaluate their sexual compulsivity. The results of this questionnaire correlate with symptoms of prefrontal cortex dysfunction, an area of the brain thought to be relevant to addiction—not only to substances, but also behaviors such as sex and gambling as measured according to the (FrSBe) Frontal Systems Behavior Scale.

This list of birds of Hawaii is a comprehensive listing of all the bird species seen naturally in the U.S. state of Hawaii as determined by Robert L. and Peter Pyle of the Bishop Museum, Honolulu, and modified by subsequent taxonomic changes. The scope of this list encompasses the entire Hawaiian Islands chain, from Kure Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands to the north, to the \\"Big Island\\" of Hawaii to the south. The list contains 337 species. Of them, 64 are or were endemic to the islands, 130 are vagrants and 52 were introduced by humans. Thirty-three of the 64 endemic species are extinct and two formerly established introduced species were extirpated. The list does not include introduced species that have not become established. This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the Check-list of North and Middle American Birds, 7th edition through the 61st Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the Check-list, except that native Hawaiian spelling is used where appropriate and the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them. The following codes define the distribution and relative abundance of species on this list: *(En) Endemic - a species either entirely confined to the Hawaiian Islands in its natural distribution, or a species whose breeding range is entirely confined to the Hawaiian Islands *(V) Vagrant - a visitor that does not occur regularly *(Xt) Extinct - \\"extinct or almost certainly extinct\\" per Pyle and Pyle *(xd) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in Hawaii, but other populations still exist elsewhere *(I) Introduced - established solely as result of human intervention with \\"a viable breeding population for at least 15 years\\" per Pyle and Pyle Population status symbols are those of the Red List published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Except for endemic species, the symbols apply to the species' worldwide status, not their status solely in Hawaii or the status of listed Hawaiian subspecies. The symbols and their meanings, in increasing order of peril, are: = least concern = near threatened = vulnerable = endangered = critically endangered = extinct in the wild = extinct Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Hawaiian duck Laysan duck Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae The family Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Until 2018, this family's three species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae. *Wilson's storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus Northern storm- petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm-petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family. *Leach's storm- petrel, Hydrobates leucorhous *Band-rumped storm-petrel, Hydrobates castro *Tristram's storm-petrel, Hydrobates tristrami Shearwaters and petrels Christmas shearwater Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Northern fulmar, Fulmarus glacialis *Kermadec petrel, Pterodroma neglecta *Herald petrel, Pterodroma heraldica *Murphy's petrel, Pterodroma ultima *Mottled petrel, Pterodroma inexpectata *Juan Fernandez petrel, Pterodroma externa *Hawaiian petrel Pterodroma sandwichensis (En) *White-necked petrel, Pterodroma cervicalis *Bonin petrel, Pterodroma hypoleuca (En) (Almost the entire world population is believed to breed in the Hawaiian Islands.) *Black- winged petrel, Pterodroma nigripennis *Cook's petrel, Pterodroma cookii *Stejneger's petrel, Pterodroma longirostris (V) *Bulwer's petrel, Bulweria bulwerii *Jouanin's petrel, Bulweria fallax (V) *Tahiti petrel, Pseudobulweria rostrata (V) *Streaked shearwater, Calonectris leucomelas (V) *Pink-footed shearwater, Ardenna creatopus (V) *Flesh-footed shearwater, Ardenna carneipes *Wedge-tailed shearwater, Ardenna pacificus *Buller's shearwater, Ardenna bulleri *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna grisea *Short-tailed shearwater, Ardenna tenuirostris *Christmas shearwater, Puffinus nativitatis *Newell's shearwater, Puffinus newelli (En) *Bryan's shearwater, Puffinus bryani Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black, or black and white, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Lesser frigatebird, Fregata ariel *Great frigatebird, Fregata minor Boobies and gannets Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Masked booby, Sula dactylatra *Nazca booby, Sula granti (V) *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster *Red-footed booby, Sula sula Cormorants and shags Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Cormorants are medium-to-large aquatic birds, usually with mainly dark plumage and areas of colored skin on the face.

Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more secretive. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills. *American bittern, Botaurus lentiginosus (V) *Great blue heron, Ardea herodias (V) *Gray heron, Ardea cinerea (V) *Great egret, Ardea alba (V) *Intermediate egret, Ardea intermedia (V) *Snowy egret, Egretta thula (V) *Little blue heron, Egretta caerulea (V) *Cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis *Green heron, Butorides virescens (V) *Black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax Ibises and spoonbills Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae The family Threskiornithidae includes the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings. Their bodies tend to be elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long, decurved in the case of the ibises, straight and distinctively flattened in the spoonbills. *White-faced ibis, Plegadis chihi (V) Osprey Osprey Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Pandionidae Pandionidae is the fish-eating bird of prey, the osprey. The family is monotypic. *Osprey, Pandion haliaetus Hawks, eagles, and kites Hawaiian hawk Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Accipitridae Accipitridae is a family of birds of prey which includes hawks, eagles, kites, harriers, and Old World vultures. These birds have very large powerful hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight. *Golden eagle, Aquila chrysaetos (V) *Northern harrier, Circus hudsonius (V) *Chinese sparrowhawk, Accipiter soloensis (V) *Black kite, Milvus migrans (V) *White- tailed eagle, Haliaeetus albicilla (V) *Steller's sea eagle, Haliaeetus pelagicus (V) *Hawaiian hawk, Buteo solitarius (En) *Rough-legged hawk, Buteo lagopus (V) Barn-owls Order: StrigiformesFamily: Tytonidae Barn-owls are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart-shaped faces.

Hawaii has one native owl, which is a distinct subspecies. *Snowy owl, Bubo scandiacus (V) *(Hawaiian) short-eared owl or pueo, Asio flammeus sandwichensis Kingfishers Order: CoraciiformesFamily: Cerylidae Kingfishers are medium-sized birds with large heads, long pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. *Belted kingfisher, Megaceryle alcyon (V) Falcons and caracaras Order: FalconiformesFamily: Falconidae Falconidae is a family of diurnal birds of prey, notably the falcons and caracaras. They differ from hawks, eagles, and kites in that they kill with their beaks instead of their talons. *Merlin, Falco columbarius (V) *Peregrine falcon, Falco peregrinus New World and African parrots Order: PsittaciformesFamily: Psittacidae Characteristic features of parrots include a strong curved bill, an upright stance, strong legs, and clawed zygodactyl feet. Many parrots are vividly colored, and some are multi-colored. In size they range from to in length. Most of the more than 150 species in this family are found in the New World. *Mitred parakeet, Psittacara mitratus (I) *Red- masked parakeet, Psittacara erythrogenys (I) *Red-crowned parrot, Amazona viridigenalis (I) Old World parrots Order: PsittaciformesFamily: Psittaculidae Characteristic features of parrots include a strong curved bill, an upright stance, strong legs, and clawed zygodactyl feet.

Crows, jays, and magpies Order: PasseriformesFamily: Corvidae The family Corvidae includes crows, ravens, jays, choughs, magpies, treepies, nutcrackers, and ground jays. Corvids are above average in size among the Passeriformes, and some of the larger species show high levels of intelligence. *Hawaiian crow, Corvus hawaiiensis (En) *Common raven, Corvus corax (V) Monarch flycatchers Hawaii ‘elepaio Order: PasseriformesFamily: Monarchidae The Monarchinae are a relatively recent grouping of a number of seemingly very different birds, mostly from the Southern Hemisphere, which are more closely related than they at first appear. Many of the approximately 140 species making up the family were previously assigned to other groups, largely on the basis of general morphology or behavior. With the new insights generated by the DNA-DNA hybridisation studies of Sibley and his co-workers toward the end of the 20th century, however, it became clear that these apparently unrelated birds were all descended from a common ancestor. The Monarchinae are small to medium- sized insectivorous passerines, many of which hunt by flycatching. *Kauai elepaio, Chasiempis sclateri (En) *Oahu elepaio, Chasiempis ibidis (En) *Hawaii elepaio, Chasiempis sandwichensis (En) Larks Order: PasseriformesFamily: Alaudidae Larks are small terrestrial birds with often extravagant songs and display flights. Most larks are fairly dull in appearance. Their food is insects and seeds. *Eurasian skylark, Alauda arvensis (I) Swallows Order: PasseriformesFamily: Hirundinidae The family Hirundinidae is adapted to aerial feeding. They have a slender streamlined body, long pointed wings, and a short bill with a wide gape. The feet are adapted to perching rather than walking, and the front toes are partially joined at the base. *Barn swallow, Hirundo rustica (V) *Cliff swallow, Petrochelidon pyrrhonota (V) Tits, chickadees, and titmice Order: PasseriformesFamily: Paridae The Paridae are mainly small stocky woodland species with short stout bills.

The birds of this group are mostly of undistinguished appearance, their plumage above being generally some dull color like greenish-olive, but some species have a white or bright yellow throat, breast or lower parts, and several have buff flanks. But as indicated by their scientific name, derived from the Ancient Greek for girdle-eye, there is a conspicuous ring around the eyes of many species. They have rounded wings and strong legs. The size ranges up to 15 cm (6 inches) in length. All the species of white-eyes are sociable, forming large flocks which only separate on the approach of the breeding season. Though mainly insectivorous, they eat nectar and fruits of various kinds. *Warbling white-eye, Zosterops japonicus (I) Laughingthrushes and allies Order: PasseriformesFamily: Leiothrichidae The members of this family are diverse in size and coloration, though those of genus Turdoides tend to be brown or grayish. The family is found in Africa, India, and southeast Asia. *Red-billed leiothrix, Leiothrix lutea (I) *Chinese hwamei, Garrulax canorus (I) *Greater necklaced laughingthrush, Ianthocincla pectoralis (I) Reed warblers and allies Millerbird Order: PasseriformesFamily: Acrocephalidae The members of this family are usually rather large for \\"warblers\\". Most are rather plain olivaceous brown above with much yellow to beige below. They are usually found in open woodland, reedbeds, or tall grass. The family occurs mostly in southern to western Eurasia and surroundings, but also ranges far into the Pacific, with some species in Africa. *Millerbird, Acrocephalus familiaris (En) Old World flycatchers Order: PasseriformesFamily: Muscicapidae The Old World flycatchers are a large family of small passerine birds restricted to the Old World. These are mainly small arboreal insectivores, many of which, as the name implies, take their prey on the wing. The appearance of these birds is highly varied, but they mostly have weak songs and harsh calls. The nest of most is a well-constructed cup in a tree or hedge. *White-rumped shama, Copsychus malabaricus (I) Thrushes and allies Puaiohi Order: PasseriformesFamily: Turdidae The thrushes are a group of passerine birds that occur mainly but not exclusively in the Old World.

The species tend towards dull grays and browns in their appearance. *Northern mockingbird, Mimus polyglottos (I) Starlings Common myna Order: PasseriformesFamily: Sturnidae Starlings are small to medium-sized Old World passerine birds with strong feet. Their flight is strong and direct and most are very gregarious. Their preferred habitat is fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit. The plumage of several species is dark with a metallic sheen. *Common myna, Acridotheres tristis (I) Hawaiian honeyeaters Kauaʻi ʻōʻō Order: PasseriformesFamily: Mohoidae Honeyeaters prefer to flit quickly from perch to perch in the outer foliage, stretching up or sideways or hanging upside down at need. They have a highly developed brush-tipped tongue, which is frayed and fringed with bristles which soak up liquids readily. The tongue is flicked rapidly and repeatedly into a flower, the upper mandible then compressing any liquid out when the bill is closed. The Kauaʻi ʻōʻō was the last species to survive. It was last seen in 1987. *Kauaʻi ʻōʻō, Moho braccatus (En) (Xt) *Oʻahu ʻōʻō, Moho apicalis (En) (Xt) *Bishop's ʻōʻō, Moho bishopi (En) (Xt) *Hawaiʻi ʻōʻō, Moho nobilis (En) (Xt) *Kioea, Chaetoptila angustipluma (En) (Xt) Waxbills and allies Chestnut munia Order: PasseriformesFamily:Estrildidae The Estrildidae are small passerine birds of the Old World tropics and Australasia. They are gregarious and often colonial seed eaters with short, thick, but pointed bills. They are all similar in structure and habits, but vary widely in plumage colors and patterns. All the estrildids build large domed nests. Most are sensitive to cold and require a warm, usually tropical, habitat. *Lavender waxbill, Estrilda caerulescens (I) *Common waxbill, Estrilda astrild (I) *Red avadavat, Amandava amandava (I) *African silverbill, Euodice cantans (I) *Java sparrow, Padda oryzivora (I) *Scaly-breasted munia, Lonchura punctulata (I) *Chestnut munia, Lonchura atricapilla (I) Old World sparrows Order: PasseriformesFamily: Passeridae Old World sparrows are small passerine birds. In general, sparrows tend to be small plump brownish or grayish birds with short tails and short powerful beaks. Sparrows are seed eaters, but they also consume small insects. *House sparrow, Passer domesticus (I) Wagtails and pipits Order: PasseriformesFamily: Motacillidae Motacillidae is a family of small passerine birds with medium to long tails. They include the wagtails, longclaws, and pipits. They are slender ground-feeding insectivores of open country. *Olive-backed pipit, Anthus hodgsoni (V) *Red-throated pipit, Anthus cervinus (V) *American pipit, Anthus rubescens (V) Finches, euphonias, and allies Laysan finch ʻAnianiau ʻIʻiwi 'Akohekohe Order: PasseriformesFamily: Fringillidae Finches are seed-eating passerine birds, that are small to moderately large and have a strong beak, usually conical and in some species very large. All have twelve tail feathers and nine primaries. These birds have a bouncing flight with alternating bouts of flapping and gliding on closed wings, and most sing well. Most of the members of this family listed here are \\"Hawaiian honeycreepers\\". These endemic birds were formerly placed in their own family, Drepanididae. The wide range of bills in this group, from thick finch-like bills to slender downcurved bills for probing flowers, have arisen through adaptive radiation, where an ancestral finch has evolved to fill a large number of ecological niches. *Brambling, Fringilla montifringilla (V) *Poʻouli, Melamprosops phaeosoma (En) (Xt) *ʻAkikiki, Oreomystis bairdi (En) *Oʻahu ʻalauahio, Paroreomyza maculata (En) (Xt) *Kākāwahie, Paroreomyza flammea (En) (Xt) *Maui 'alauahio, Paroreomyza montana (En) *Palila, Loxioides bailleui (En) *Laysan finch, Telespiza cantans (En) *Nihoa finch, Telespiza ultima (En) *Kona grosbeak, Chloridops kona (En) (Xt) *Lesser koa-finch, Rhodacanthis flaviceps (En) (Xt) *Greater koa-finch, Rhodacanthis palmeri (En) (Xt) *ʻUla-ʻai-hawane, Ciridops anna (En) (Xt) *ʻAkohekohe, Palmeria dolei (En) *Laysan honeycreeper, Himatione fraithii (En) (Xt) *ʻApapane, Himatione sanguinea (En) *ʻIʻiwi, Drepanis coccinea (En) *Hawaii mamo, Drepanis pacifica (En) (Xt) *Black mamo, Drepanis funerea (En) (Xt) *ʻŌʻū, Psittirostra psittacea (En) (Xt) *Lāna'i hookbill, Dysmorodrepanis munroi (En) (Xt) *Maui parrotbill, Pseudonestor xanthophrys (En) *Kauaʻi nukupuʻu Hemignathus hanapepe (En) (Xt) *Oʻahu nukupuʻu Hemignathus lucidus (En) (Xt) *Maui nukupuʻu Hemignathus affinis (En) (Xt) *ʻAkiapolaʻau, Hemignathus wilsoni (En) *Lesser ʻakialoa, Akialoa obscura (En) (Xt) *Kauaʻi ʻakialoa, Akialoa stejnegeri (En) (Xt) *Oʻahu ʻakialoa, Akialoa ellisiana (En) (Xt) *Maui Nui 'akialoa, Akialoa lanaiensis (En) (Xt) *ʻAnianiau, Magumma parva (En) *Hawaiʻi ʻamakihi, Chlorodrepanis virens (En) *Oʻahu ʻamakihi, Chlorodrepanis flava (En) *Kauaʻi ʻamakihi, Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri (En) *Greater ʻamakihi, Viridonia sagittirostris (En) (Xt) *Hawaiʻi creeper, Loxops mana (En) *‘Akeke‘e, Loxops caeruleirostris (En) *Oʻahu ʻakepa, Loxops wolstenholmei (En) (Xt) *Maui ʻakepa, Loxops ochraceus (En) *Hawaiʻi ʻakepa, Loxops coccineus (En) *House finch, Haemorhous mexicanus (I) *Common redpoll, Acanthis flammea (V) *Yellow-fronted canary, Crithagra mozambica (I) *Island canary, Serinus canaria (I) Longspurs and snow buntings Order: PasseriformesFamily: Calcariidae The Calcariidae are a group of passerine birds that were traditionally grouped with the New World sparrows, but differ in a number of respects and are usually found in open grassy areas. *Snow bunting, Plectrophenax nivalis (V) New World sparrows Order: PasseriformesFamily: Passerellidae Until 2017, these species were considered part of the family Emberizidae. Most of the species are known as sparrows, but these birds are not closely related to the Old World sparrows which are in the family Passeridae. Many of these have distinctive head patterns. *Savannah sparrow, Passerculus sandwichensis (V) Troupials and allies Order: PasseriformesFamily: Icteridae The icterids are a group of small- to medium- sized, often colorful passerine birds.

This was the first Andorran entry not to feature monolingual Catalan lyrics and not to be performed by a female soloist, with all the members of the band being male. Anonymous performing \\"Salvem el món\\" for Andorra. The song is a pop punk number, the first such song ever to be performed at the Contest. Lead singer \\"N!ki\\" sings about his disbelief at the state of the world, remarking that \\"The world is in danger and you don't do anything\\". He sings that this is because everyone is only interested in their own lives, and is unwilling to do anything for the greater good. Thus, he proposes that everyone unite and think about things they can do to improve the world. The chorus is delivered in English, with the band singing that humanity as a whole has treated the world badly, having \\"turned [it] upside down\\". The theme of a call to action was made more explicit in the performance, with N!ki calling out \\"Thank you! We can still save the world!\\" after the song was finished. As Andorra had not previously qualified for the final, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here, it was performed twenty-first (following Malta's Olivia Lewis with \\"Vertigo\\" and preceding Hungary's Magdi Rúzsa with \\"Unsubstantial Blues\\"). At the close of voting, it had received 80 points, placing 12th in the 28-strong field and thus missing out on qualifying for the final by two places. This was, however, Andorra's best result - with their entry in 2006 coming last in the semi-final, for example. Following the Contest, the song charted at number 3 in the Spanish chart.

They meet regularly to share their \\"experiences, strength and hope\\", so they can help each other solve the problems compulsive gambling has created in their lives, and to help others recover from the addiction of compulsive gambling. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop gambling, as stated in the GA Combo book page 2. Gamblers Anonymous uses the term \\"Compulsive Gambling\\" instead of \\"pathological gambling\\" or \\"problem gambling\\" or a \\"gambling disorder\\", terms preferred by clinicians and the American Psychiatric Association (APA). History Gamblers Anonymous was founded in 1957 by Jim Willis. Jim W. was an alcoholic who used his experience in Alcoholics Anonymous as the foundation in forming Gamblers Anonymous into a 12 step program. Due to favorable publicity by the newspaper columnist and TV commentator Paul Coates, of the Los Angeles Mirror, Gamblers Anonymous held its First Group Meeting, on September 13, 1957 in Los Angeles California. 13 people attended the First Gamblers Anonymous meeting. [The UPI article also states that 13 people attended the first GA meeting in LA. The organization began in Los Angeles on September 13, 1957. By 2005 there were over 1000 GA groups in the United States, and groups had been established in: * The United States of America, currently in all 50 states, many with multiple Gamblers Anonymous meetings each day. * Australia Phillip Sydney the founder of Gamblers Anonymous in Australia, held the first GA meeting in Sydney on November 25, 1961, at the Congregational Church in Surry Hills, with three other compulsive gamblers. Australia then became the second country to successfully establish a GA group in the world. Phillip was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, which he joined in 1961 prior to starting GA. , after Phillip Sydney's death, Australia had 200 GA meetings a week and thousands had achieved abstinence through Gamblers Anonymous Australia. * United Kingdom Gordon Moody, The (UK's) Secretary of the Churches' Council of Gambling in 1958, founded Gamblers Anonymous on the 10th July 1964 with the help of Henry and Vivian F. During a business trip to the UK, Henry and Vivian F. members of GA in Brooklyn New York, heard Gordon Moody address a meeting on the subject of gambling at the South Croydon Methodist Church. After which Henry F. approached Gordon Moody and introduced himself as a compulsive gambler and a member of Gamblers Anonymous in the US. Gordon in time learned a great deal from Henry and Vivian, \\"enough for me to understand – and to be understood\\" by one seeking help with a gambling problem. * Japan GA and Gam-Anon started in Japan in 1989. According to the GA Japan Information Center, in September 2010, GA Japan had 115 groups and GAM- ANON had 93 groups, according to the GAM-ANON Japan Information Center. The annual GA Japan National Conference is held in October, while GAM-ANON Japan holds it's National Conference every June. Regional GA and GAM-ANON groups also host smaller conferences annually. * Kenya Jackson Okoth is the founder of Gamblers Anonymous in Nairobi Kenya, and the author of Not A Chance. GA Kenya currently lists three meetings, one in Nairobi, and two in Murang'a. * Ireland, Scotland, Canada * Mexico, South Africa, Brazil, Israel, Uganda, Korea and many other locations throughout the world. Due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, most GA meetings moved to online platforms such as Zoom, GoToMeetings, telephone conference calls, or a combination of these medium. In person gatherings at physical locations were temporarily suspended due to the COVID-19 Task Force Guidelines, and other regulatory guidelines in other countries throughout the globe. Symptoms Gamblers Anonymous members use the 20 Questions as a guide to determine whether they are compulsive gamblers. This is not a definitive evaluation, and only the individual with the aid of their doctor can make the determination as to whether they have a compulsive gambling problem. The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnosis Criteria of a Gambling Disorder lists the need of a compulsive gambler to increase the amount of money bet, borrowing money to cover loses, lying to conceal the extent of one's gambling, \\"loss of relationships and jobs\\", and \\"frequent thoughts of gambling\\". The National Center for Responsible Gaming (NCRG) uses the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 to describe the symptoms of a gambling disorder, aka compulsive gambling to be \\"chasing\\" loses, inability to stop, cut back or control their gambling. A Gambling disorder is the only non- substance use addiction identified in the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5. The Mayo Clinic offers a list of symptoms for compulsive gambling, which include \\"preoccupation with gambling\\", \\"trying to control, cut back or stop\\", and lying. A compulsive gambler may sell personal property, or engage in illegal activity to finance the gambling addiction. NOAA lists \\"Indicators of Compulsive Gambling:\\", borrowing money, and spending exceedingly long hours gambling. NOAA also lists some of the \\"Behaviors Observable in the Workplace\\" of a compulsive gambler.  Treatment  The American Psychiatric Association (APA) suggests counseling can help the compulsive gambler. The APA also offers \\"\\"Dos\\" and \\"Don'ts\\" for Partners or Family Members\\", which include seeking support from GAM-ANON, along with money management strategies. Gamblers Anonymous offers members a number of suggestions for abstaining from gambling, these include not going near or into a gambling establishment.  Meetings  GA meetings are the core of the fellowship, \\"Meetings Make It\\". Participating in GA meetings along with individual psychotherapy, is the preferred form of treatment according to the UCLA gambling studies program. There are a few different meeting formats offered by Gamblers Anonymous: * \\"Closed\\" (also called \\"Main\\") meetings are strictly for those who have or think they have a gambling problem; * \\"Beginners\\" (also called \\"Newcomers\\") meetings are particularly for people new to GA, those who have been in the program under one year. Here the new comer is introduced to GA's suggestions on how to refrain from gambling, found page 17 of the combo book,. First and foremost Going to lots of meetings in the first 90 days; Staying away from gambling establishments; not associating with people who gamble; getting a sponsor, a more seasoned GA member who can help the newcomer through the first year, and in latter years too; calling other members between meetings; etc... * \\"Mixed\\" meetings, are gatherings of GA and GAM-ANON members only. During these meetings literature from both GA and GAM-ANON's, 12 step fellowships is read, and members from both fellowships share their experience, strength and hope with each other. * \\"Open\\" meetings are open to those whose lives have been affected by gambling: the spouses, family and friends of a compulsive gambler. * \\"Step\\" meetings, in which GA members work specifically on the 12 steps of recovery. * \\"Women's (also known as \\"Women-Preferred\\") meetings, are predominantly attend by women. *\\"Modified closed meetings\\" are held when a group votes to include health professionals or persons from other 12 step fellowships or guest attending with a new comer to Gamblers Anonymous. * GAM- ANON meetings are exclusively for spouses, family, and friends of a compulsive gambler.. The compulsive gambler need not be a member of GA for one to attend GAM-ANON meetings.  GAM-ANON  GAMA-ANON is the sister 12 step program of Gamblers Anonymous, modeled after Al-Anon/Alateen for spouses, partners, family and friends of a compulsive gambler, who are suffering from the stresses and problems caused by the compulsive gambler's gambling and behaviors.  Incidence rate and evaluation  Problem gambling is estimated to occur in 1.6% of the adult population in the United States. GA has a list of twenty questions that can be used to self-diagnose compulsive gambling. The results from their instrument have correlated strongly with other tests that screen for compulsive gambling (e.g. the Total Sensation Seeking Scale, Boredom Susceptibility, Experience Seeking, South Oaks Gambling Screen, and Disinhibition subscales).  Effectiveness  Gamblers Anonymous has been compared with other strategies, such as Cognitive-behavioral therapy as efficacy methods of psychotherapies for pathological gambling. Compared to problem gamblers who do not attend GA, GA members tend to have more severe gambling problems, are older, have higher incomes, are less likely to be single, have more years of gambling problems, have larger debts, have more serious family conflicts, and less serious substance abuse problems. GA may not be as effective for those who have not had significant gambling problems. GA is effective to prevent \\"relapses\\" (inability to remain abstinent from gambling), but not as effective when helping members deal with the consequences of their relapse. GA spends much of its time and energy counseling members on how to deal with financial and legal problems. GA supports \\"pressure relief groups\\" where members take each other to task and encourage them to \\"get honest\\" with people in their lives and get their affairs in order. Gamblers who are able to moderate their activity are not likely to continue attending GA meetings. GA members who stopped attending meetings were more likely to consider the sharing at the meetings \\"meaningless\\" and were more critical of GA literature. Those who felt particularly elated at their first GA meetings were less likely to continue than those who had a more balanced first impression. GA, therefore, may be most suitable for severe problem gamblers who do not have compounding issues. Criticism Attrition Less than 8% of those who initially attend GA remain in the program and abstain from gambling for over a year. Program participation and abstinence increase if members are involved in additional therapy, or if one or more of their family members are involved in Gam-Anon or Gam-A-Teen. Gender bias Although the likelihood of attending GA is the same for males and females, GA has been characterized as a predominately male fellowship. The number of female members, however, is increasing and there is an increasing sensitivity within GA to women's attitudes. GA's lack of appeal towards females has been attributed to GA's lack of focus on the principles of spirituality in other twelve-step programs, like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). A causal link, however, has not been shown. GA is often described as more secularized than AA. Among problem gamblers, it has been found that women are more focused on interpersonal issues, and that social issues were more likely to cause them to \\"relapse\\". Males more frequently discuss \\"external concerns\\" such as jobs and legal problems, and are more likely to relapse because of substance abuse. Therefore, it does seem plausible that GA's downplaying of spiritual, interpersonal, and psychoemotional issues, inhibits its effectiveness for women.  Literature  Gamblers Anonymous has several approved books used as standard literature in the group. These are some of the most popular examples:  *  See also  Some states have worked with casinos, and other gambling establishments to institute a \\"self-exclusion\\" mechanism, where gambling institutions would be prohibited from issuing credit, cashing a check or marketing to those who have self-excluded themselves from those establishments.

He has been connected to numerous crimes, including the Achille Lauro hijacking and the Iran-Contra scandal. On November 20, 2008, he was convicted in U.S. federal court as part of a U.S. government sting, for agreeing to sell arms to undercover agents posing as suppliers for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a Colombian guerrilla organization. He was sentenced to thirty years' imprisonment.Al Jazeera, US jails Syrian-born Arms Dealer, February 25, 2009 Early years Al-Kassar was born in Hama and grew up in the nearby town of Nebek. His father was a lawyer and diplomat who at various times was Syria's ambassador to Canada and India.\\"The Trafficker – The Decades-Long Battle to Catch an International Arms Broker, Patrick Radden Keefe, The New Yorker, February 8, 2010 According to U.S. authorities, Monzer's mentor in the drug and arms trade was his older brother, Ghassan, who had begun selling drugs in the late 1960s. (Ghassan remained in the arms business until his death of natural causes in 2009). Al- Kassar attended law school in the late 1960s. In 1970, al-Kassar had his first Interpol-recorded arrest, for theft, in Trieste, Italy. Al-Kassar became an arms dealer in the early 1970s, according to him, when the government of Yemen asked him to buy rifles and pistols (Łucznik) from Poland for them (those arms were then also sent to various terror groups). In the 1980s he was Attaché of Commerce of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in Warsaw, People's Republic of Poland.W sieci terroru. Tygodnik Nasza Polska, nr 42 (663) United Kingdom In 1972, he was arrested in Copenhagen for selling hashish. He then moved to the United Kingdom. He lived in Sloane Square in London, where he took part in an operation that imported heroin and hashish from Lebanon, then bought arms with the profits and smuggled them back to Lebanon. In either 1974 or 1977 (sources conflict), al-Kassar was arrested and jailed in the UK for selling hashish. He served less than two years in jail. In 1981, he married Raghdaa Habbal, who was seventeen years old at the time, and who came from a well-connected Syrian family in Beirut. In 1984, al-Kassar was expelled from the UK for drug and arms trafficking. \\"The Prince of Marbella\\" After his expulsion from the UK, al-Kassar moved, along with his wife and by then two children, to Marbella, Spain. There he bought a mansion, that he named \\"Palacio de Mifadil\\" (\\"Palace of My Virtue\\", in a combination of Spanish and Arabic), and quickly developed a reputation as a wealthy, ostentatious businessman. The European press soon began to call him \\"The Prince of Marbella\\". In 1985 he was the subject of a profile in the French magazine Paris Match, which wrote, \\"in a few years, this Syrian merchant became one of the most powerful businessmen in the world.\\" The Spanish government alleges that in 1985, al-Kassar sold arms to the hijackers of the Achille Lauro cruise ship, and that afterwards he flew the hijackers' leader, Abu Abbas, to safety in one of his private airplanes. Al-Kassar has denied the charge. In 1995, a court in Madrid acquitted Al-Kassar of all charges related to the hijacking. In 1987, investigations into the Iran-Contra scandal found that al-Kassar had been paid 1.5 million GBP by someone in the USA government to sell arms to Nicaraguan Contras; according to an article in The New Yorker, the money came from \\"a Swiss bank account controlled by Oliver North and his co-conspirators.\\" In 1992, al-Kassar made arms sales valued in the millions of USD to Croatia, Bosnia and Somalia, violating United Nations arms embargoes to all three countries. That same year, al-Kassar obtained an Argentine passport, with the alleged plan to move there, with the assistance of then-president Carlos Menem, whose parents were from the same town in Syria as those of al- Kassar, and who may have been a relative. (In 2000, he was indicted in Argentina for \\"obtaining documents under false pretences\\".) Also in 1992, the Spanish government arrested him for his alleged earlier involvement in the Achille Lauro hijacking, along with \\"falsification of documents\\" and \\"possession of illegal weapons and vehicles\\". He spent more than a year in jail before being released on bail. The trial came in 1995, and he was found not guilty on all charges. Up to 2002 he collaborated with Wojskowe Służby Informacyjne in illegal arms trading.Tygodnik Nasza Polska, nr 42 (663) In July 2006, the government of Iraq placed him at No. 26 on their \\"most wanted\\" list, calling him \\"one of the main sources of financial and logistics support\\" for the Iraqi insurgency. DEA sting After the September 11 attacks in 2001, there was renewed interest in the United States in apprehending those connected to terrorism, as well as new laws that gave greater power for \\"extraterritorial jurisdiction\\", or the ability of the U.S. government to investigate and arrest people suspected of committing crimes outside the United States. In 2006, the Drug Enforcement Administration decided to put together a sting to trap al-Kassar, code-named \\"Operation Legacy\\" and led by Jim Soiles and the DEA's Special Operations Division. They enlisted a 69-year- old Palestinian former member of the Black September Organization, referred to publicly only as \\"Samir\\", who was then being held in a U.S. prison. Samir spent much of 2006 trying to arrange a meeting with al-Kassar, and was finally able to in December 2006. In February 2007, the DEA had Samir arrange a meeting between al-Kassar and two Guatemalan informants posing as FARC insurgents who wanted to purchase weapons to use against American military forces. The group met several more times, and at later meetings the informants were wearing hidden video cameras, which recorded al-Kassar agreeing to the terms of the deal. The informants, at the request of the DEA, then tried to lure al-Kassar to Romania, ostensibly in order to collect his payment for the sale, where he could be easily arrested by USA agents; but al-Kassar refused. They instead convinced him to board a flight to Madrid for the same purpose. In June 2007, the Cuerpo Nacional de Policía (Spanish National Police) at the Barajas Airport in Madrid arrested him after he got off the plane. He was charged with conspiring to kill Americans, supplying terrorists, obtaining anti-aircraft missiles and money laundering.\\"Spain arrests arms dealer Al Kassar on U.S. charges\\", Reuters, June 8, 2007 On June 13, 2008, al-Kassar was extradited to the United States of America for trial; he arrived in New York in shackles the following day. On November 20, 2008, he was convicted in federal court of five charges, among them money laundering and conspiring to sell arms to suppliers for FARC. Sentencing for al-Kassar and co-defendant Luis Felipe Moreno Godoy was scheduled for February 18, 2009. The relatives of Leon Klinghoffer, the man murdered in the Achille Lauro incident, were in court for the verdict. Al-Kassar was represented by Ira Sorkin. February 24, 2009 al-Kassar was sentenced to 30 years in prison on for conspiring to sell weapons to Colombian rebels. A New Yorker article about the sting speculated that al-Kassar had been unusually lax in his behavior with the fake arms buyers, and that this may have been caused by financial desperation on al- Kassar's part, since, due to a decrease in world conflicts, the international arms trade was slower than it had been during the late 20th century. Imprisonment Since 2009, al-Kassar has been serving a sentence at a federal prison in Marion, Illinois. He is due for release in 2033. Since 2018, he has actively posted on Facebook, maintaining that he is innocent of the charges against him, and accusing the DEA and the Mossad of falsifying evidence used to convict him.

It is a broom-like shrub with narrow, hooked leaves, small sepals and deep lilac- coloured to white petals and is common and widespread in southern parts of the continent. Description Eremophila scoparia is a broom-like shrub which grows to a height of between . Its branches and leaves are covered with yellowish or silvery-grey scaly hairs although individual scales are indistinct and the surface may appear glabrous. The leaves are mostly arranged in opposite pairs and are linear to almost cylindrical in shape, S-shaped in side view, mostly long, wide and have a hooked end. The flowers are borne singly or in pairs in leaf axils on a stalk long which has the same scaly covering as the leaves. There are 5 linear sepals which are long, covered with the same scaly covering on the outside but are hairy on the inside surface. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is blue, lilac, pink or white on the outside and white with yellow spots inside. The outside surface of the petal tube and its lobes are covered with scaly hairs, the inside of the lobes is glabrous except for branched hairs near their edges and the inside of the tube is densely filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens are enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs throughout the year but mainly from August to October. The fruits are dry, woody, oval to cone-shaped, almost spherical, slightly fleshy, long and have a scaly covering.Coolgardie E. scoparia flower detail Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1810 by botanist Robert Brown who gave it the name Pholidia scoparia and published the description in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae. In 1860, Mueller changed the name to Eremophila scoparia and published the change in Papers and Proceedings of the Royal Society of van Dieman's Land. The specific epithet is from the Latin scoparia meaning 'broom-like'. E.scoparia is also known by the common names broom bush, scotia bush, wax bush and broom emu bush. Distribution and habitat Silver emu bush occurs in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. In Western Australia it is found between Merredin and Echuca in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Great Victoria Desert, Hampton, Mallee, Murchison and Nullarbor biogeographic regions. In South Australia it occurs in the North-Western, Lake Eyre, Nullarbor, Gairdner-Torrens, Flinders Ranges, Eastern, Eyre Peninsula, Northern Lofty and Murray botanical regions. It is found in the north-western corner of Victoria and in New South Wales south from Wilcannia. It grows on a wide range of soils, is common in mulga, mallee and chenopod communities and is often the dominant shrub. Conservation Eremophila scoparia is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila has a broom-like shape and pale to deep lilac- coloured flowers. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock and grows best in well-drained soil in either full sun or part shade. It is tolerant of drought and of the harshest frost and can be pruned to maintain its shape or to rejuvenate an old specimen.

Nar-Anon is complementary to, but separate from, Narcotics Anonymous (NA), analogous to Al-Anon with respect to Alcoholics Anonymous; Nar-Anon's traditions state that it should \\"always cooperate with Narcotics Anonymous.\\" Nar-Anon was co-founded by Alma B. and Louise S. in Studio City, California, but their attempt to launch the program failed. The organization was revived in 1968 in the Palos Verdes Peninsula by Louise S. and others. Nar-Anon filed Articles of Incorporation in 1971, and in 1986 established the Nar-Anon World Service Office (WSO) in San Pedro, California. In 2006, Nar-Anon began holding biennial World Service Conferences, attended by delegates from each region, to approve literature and policies for Nar-Anon as a whole. Nar-Anon also offers the Narateen program, which is designed for teenage members of the Nar-Anon fellowship.  Structure  The structure is described in detail in the Guide to Local Services and the Guide to World Services (see external links). Members join a group, which meets on a regular weekly or monthly schedule, and is formed with other members who live nearby and are similarly recovering from the problems of addiction in a relative or a friend. The primary activity of the group is to provide a safe place for members to talk about their recovery, and to support one another. A group chooses service volunteers from its members to run the group—nobody runs the group as a professional. At the top of the service structure, control of Nar-Anon begins with the groups, each of which may elect a Group Service Representative (GSR). The GSRs may meet with other GSRs in an Area formed by several nearby groups, to vote and organize Nar-Anon activities within the Area. The same GSRs also meet within a larger Region, formed by several Areas, in an Assembly, to vote and organize Nar-Anon activities at the Regional Service level. The Regional Service Assembly may elect a Delegate along with an Alternate Delegate, to attend the biennial World Service Conference with other Delegates. At the World Service Conference, Nar-Anon literature and Nar-Anon policies for all of Nar-Anon world-wide are approved, and one-third of the Board of Trustees is elected (two-thirds is elected by the Board of Trustees itself). Some countries may also have a National Service level below the Regional Service level. Committees and sub-committees to handle affairs between meetings of the voting bodies are appointed at each level.

Collectively they attend more than 500 weekly meetings in fifteen countries, according to data released in 2011. Those who compulsively incur unsecured debt are said to be engaged in compulsive borrowing and are known as compulsive debtors. DA encourages careful record keeping and monitoring of finances—including purchases, income, and debt payments—to get a clear picture of spending habits. This information is used to develop healthier spending practices, supporting one in keeping a reasonable quality of life while still repaying debt. Similarly, DA recommends developing plans for the future to increase income. DA's program is intended to facilitate a progressive personality change in its members, ultimately transforming their world views and changing their behaviors. In the mid-1990s, sociologist Terrell A. Hayes conducted in-depth interviews with a convenience and snowball sample of forty-six members of DA. Hayes found many of the members interviewed only partially accept the ideology of the organization and that parts of DA's program, such as stigmatizing labels used to describe members, may actually hinder acceptance of DA's ideology. Development In 1968, members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) who believed that their financial difficulties were caused by an addictive disease not unlike alcoholism founded an organization named Penny Pinchers, which they later renamed Capital Builders. The founding members believed their financial problems stemmed from an inability to save money, and they practiced making daily deposits to their savings accounts. Later they recognized their problems were not caused by an inability to save but rather an inability to stay solvent. In early 1971, the group members came to believe that incurring unsecured debt was the threshold of their disease and committed to a rigorous twelve-step approach to prevent incurring further unsecured debt. The original group disbanded and meetings were not consistently held again until 1976, when a group of two or three people began meeting regularly on Wednesdays in the rectory of St. Stephen's Church in New York City. Within a year, a second group formed and Debtors Anonymous continued to grow. The first General Service Conference was held in 1987 in the auditorium at Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center in Manhattan. , there were 512 groups meeting worldwide. Literature DA adapted AA's format, making only five changes to AA's Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions: \\"D.A.\\" and \\"Debtors Anonymous\\" replaces \\"A.A.\\" and \\"Alcoholics Anonymous\\", \\"debt\\" replaces \\"alcoholism\\", \\"compulsive debtors\\" replaces \\"alcoholics\\", \\"incurring unsecured debt\\" replaces \\"drinking\\", and \\"debtor\\" replaces \\"alcoholic.\\" In 2002, DA published a list of 12 promises similar to the 12 promises appearing on pages 83–84 of Alcoholics Anonymous. DA's original literature also includes the Twelve Tools of Debtors Anonymous, a list of practices to recover from compulsive getting into debt. Official DA literature is either approved by the DA General Service Board (GSB) or by vote at a DA Conference, based on whether it is service literature (related to the functioning of DA groups) or recovery literature (all other DA literature). Such literature is \\"Conference-approved.\\" DA publishes two books, A Currency of Hope and The Twelve Steps, Twelve Traditions, and Twelve Concepts of Debtors Anonymous, as well as several pamphlets. A Currency of Hope includes DA's adaptations of the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, a description of compulsive getting into debt, a brief history of DA, and 38 stories written by DA members explaining how DA has affected their lives. Membership Debtors Anonymous is fundamentally an organization to facilitate recovery from \\"compulsive debting.\\" \\"Compulsive debting\\" is a neologism described variously in DA literature as a disorder, progressive illness, and a disease. As such, \\"compulsive debting\\" cannot be cured, although it can be arrested. Compulsive debtors are those who cannot control their debt, as a consequence their debt causes growing and continuing problems in their lives. \\"Compulsive debting\\" is also an umbrella term encompassing many different types of behavior from \\"incurring unsecured debt to compulsive shopping, from grandiose thinking to deprivation mentality.\\" Members must decide for themselves whether or not they are compulsive debtors. To help them with the decision, DA provides a 15-item questionnaire (most compulsive debtors will answer yes to eight or more of the questions) and a list of 12 signs of \\"compulsive debting\\". An ethnographic study of DA members found they attributed the causes of \\"compulsive debting\\" to family maladjustment and a culture that constantly pressures people to spend money. DA members may identify themselves additionally—or more specifically—as compulsive shoppers or spenders, codependent debtors or compulsive underearners. Compulsive spending is a symptom associated with \\"compulsive debting\\". Spending money to one's detriment is compulsive spending. Spending money on particular goods or services after making a decision not to, or having a desire not to, is also compulsive spending. Compulsive spending is often done to avoid uncomfortable feelings. DA provides a 30-item questionnaire to help people determine if they are spending compulsively, each item is a sign of compulsive spending. Answering yes to three or more of these questions indicates compulsive spending. Although compulsive spenders may not actually be in debt, if they have a desire to avoid incurring unsecured debt, they are welcome in DA. Codependent debtors incur unsecured debt to pay for another persons' compulsive spending. Underearners are people with viable skills who are psychologically incapable of earning enough money to support themselves without incurring unsecured debt. DA provides a list of 12 signs that are symptomatic of compulsive underearning. Underearning can lead to become a \\"compulsive pauper,\\" a term describing people who are consistently broke and in financial crisis. A related term, \\"financial anorexia,\\" describes \\"someone who takes inordinate amounts of pride in having few financial needs and is more comfortable living in deprivation.\\" Financial anorexics, while they may find it difficult to spend money on themselves, are not necessarily underearning. Although compulsive underearners may not actually be in debt, if they have a desire to avoid incurring unsecured debt, they are welcome in DA.  Psychiatric categorization  In the previous version of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual (DSM-IV-TR) and in the current version (DSM-V), indebtedness is not considered to be a disease. Neither version contains compulsive buying disorder, a condition similar to \\"compulsive debting\\", or any other spending-related issues as diagnostic categories. The DSM-IV-TR did contain a category for Impulse Control Disorders Not Otherwise Specified to diagnose impulse control problems that were not elsewhere in the manual. Terminology The phrase \\"terminal vagueness\\" describes a characteristic of compulsive debtors, a systematic avoidance of monitoring finances–including avoiding communication with creditors–leading to an overestimation or underestimation of account balances. An overestimation may result in incurring unsecured debt. \\"Clarity\\" is the opposite of vagueness, requiring a clear picture of how much money one has and owes, at any given time. DA encourages \\"awareness\\" of the cultural pervasiveness of debt and overspending. DA suggests members stay aware of manipulative advertising tactics as well as thoughts and feelings that trigger their desire to spend money. Excessive preoccupation with indebtedness can lead to both \\"emotional indebtedness\\" and \\"self-debting.\\" \\"Self-debting\\" is the inability to identify or fulfill personal needs because of such preoccupations, whereas emotional indebtedness is the accompanying stress, anxiety, feelings of hopelessness or despair, and even suicidal ideation. \\"Self-debting\\" manifests in various ways such as taking drastic measures to hide evidence of problems with money or debt, paying creditors to the detriment of one's needs, or even spending excessive amounts of time managing finances. \\"Abstinence\\" in DA is abstaining from incurring any new unsecured debt, a strict definition that includes not paying bills when due, borrowing money from a family member or friend without collateral, credit card debt and other unsecured loans. If a member has abstained from incurring unsecured debt for a day, he or she is \\"solvent\\" for that day. Solvency, in this sense, is a neologism differing from the common definition of solvency (the degree to which assets exceeds liabilities). A belief in an \\"abundant universe\\" underlies much of the DA program. Competition is learned from, but not feared, as there are enough resources for everyone. This perspective counters deprivation thinking that accompanies \\"compulsive debting\\", overspending, and underearning. DA members may be vague or unfocused about their goals in life. For this reason, DA encourages members to develop \\"vision,\\" the ability to form a clear and specific picture of what they want to do in life. Visions are discovered by abstaining from incurring unsecured debt, following the Twelve Steps and using the Twelve Tools. Ignoring one's vision is similar to \\"self-debting\\", it may result in physical or emotional distress, or preoccupation with other people's lives rather than focusing on oneself. Self-help groups, including DA, urge members to change their world view. It is critically important for self-help groups to ease this process for their members as changes in world view are generally accompanied by significant behavioral changes. For example, the pamphlet Debtors Anonymous answers \\"How Does a Person Get Solvent Through the D.A. Program?\\" by explaining that DA brings about a \\"progressive personality change\\" within the member. This change is accomplished through faith in, and understanding of, DA's Twelve Steps. Record keeping and planning Spending records and spending plans \\"Keeping numbers\\" is a daily practice that requires recording each cent owed, spent and earned, including recording any part of a debt that has been paid. Members use different methods to keep their numbers, a simple approach is to carry a small notebook and record numbers in it daily. Daily records are used to create monthly spending records with income and expenditures separated into specific categories (e.g. rent, groceries, phone, entertainment, etc.). The purpose of these records is to increase clarity, cutting through any denial about how much money is being earned and spent. A detailed spending record will show values, habits and responsibilities. Spending records are used to create spending plans. A spending plan is essentially a list of all goods and services to buy in a given month. Members regularly review their spending plans and assess whether items and amounts in the plan are reasonable. The spending plan puts the member's needs ahead of the creditors and should not cause one to incur unsecured debt. Spending plans should include categories for income and debt repayment. Unless one is having trouble meeting very basic needs, it should also include a category for savings. Accompanying a \\"real\\" spending plan is an \\"ideal\\" spending plan, detailing what one's finances would look like in an ideal universe, how much money one would earn, and how it would be spent. The ideal spending plan focuses efforts on increasing income and following a vision for the future. DA avoids using the term budget, as its connotation may imply rigid categories. A spending plan is designed such that one has the best possible life under their present financial circumstances. Spending plans are flexible and convey that there are options, that one chooses how to spend money. Action plans DA encourages members, after several weeks participation, to organize \\"pressure relief meetings.\\" In these meetings, a newer member invites two veteran members (with at least 90 days of abstinence, typically a male and a female) to review his or her financial records in detail and give practical advice. These occur outside of regular meetings, and are a way for members to receive suggestions from each other. The member organizing the group typically brings his or her spending records, and a list of issues that he or she would like assistance with. \\"Action plans\\" are developed during pressure relief meetings based on the suggestions of the other members, a spending plan may also be developed or modified. Actions plans are lists of specific actions to resolve debts and improve one's financial situation. Members organize pressure relief groups about once a month. In times of crisis, however, they may hold them more often. Debt repayment plans Practicing the Fourth Step of the DA's Twelve Steps includes not only a moral inventory of personal characteristics but also an inventory of personal financial history including a list of current outstanding debts. Similarly, the Ninth Step includes monetary debt repayment. Following the language of the Ninth Step, however, the payment schedule should not injure the debtor or the creditor. The goal in repaying creditors is to do so while living well. DA members find their ability to pay their creditors improves when they take care of themselves. Payments to creditors should be consistent and manageable. In this way, members are able to offer detailed rationale for their debt repayment schedule, allowing for empowered and functional negotiation with creditors. In this spirit, a certain amount of money is allocated for debt repayment each month whenever possible. One might begin making a debt repayment plan by categorizing secured and unsecured debt, including the name of the creditor, the total amount owed, when the amount will be paid off, and the current monthly payment. For each debt one would list the current balance, finance charge per month, the minimum payment per month, and include a blank column for the \\"actual\\" payment. The amount of the actual payment would be determined from one's spending plan, after subtracting necessary expenses and the amount of money required to support a reasonable quality of life. This amount would then be divided up among the creditors. Ideally, the payment to each creditor is proportional (based on the amount of money owed to the creditor divided by the total liabilities). Creditors should not be given special treatment because they harass a debtor with greater frequency than other creditors. One may, however, give preference to creditors charging higher interest rates, threatening legal action, or who are friends or family members. DA recommends recording each payment made to a creditor, noting the original amount of the debt, the date the payment was made, the amount of the payment, and the remaining balance. Further, DA advises keeping a record of retired debts to record the date each debt was fully paid. Although it may conflict with cultural norms, DA recommends taking a debt moratorium when a debtor cannot put his or her needs first and continue to making debt payments. Before taking a debt moratorium, DA suggests checking with one's sponsor, pressure relief group, and to contact one's creditors to explain the situation. If a creditor threatens to take legal action under these circumstances DA recommends seeking professional assistance or revising the moratorium. Analysis of interviews with members In an independent study using convenience and snowball sampling, sociologist Terrell A. Hayes found and surveyed 46 DA members from July 1993 to June 1995. 42 of the members surveyed were attending meetings in the Eastern United States, the remaining four attended meetings in Austin, Texas. An analysis of the data Hayes collected revealed specific parts of DA hindered acceptance of DA's overall ideology. These included: labeling, differences between DA meetings and DA members, lack of a clear position on bankruptcy and debt- shifting, and common use of unapproved literature. Labeling Hayes performed a qualitative analysis of survey results in an attempt to understand how labeling theory applies to the stigma of indebtedness. He found that social labeling (labeling of members by other people) and self-labeling (members labeling themselves) is a widespread practice in twelve-step groups, and pointed out that the First Step in DA requires one to admit powerlessness over debt. Hayes concluded that labeling was related to changes in self- awareness, encouraging members to seek help and to changes in their social identity. However he also asserted that stigmatization of indebtedness was related to experiences of shame among indebted people, and that labeling a person as having a problem with debt therefore exposes them to shame. Other mental health professionals have argued that DA participation reduces shame, and some, such as Law Professor A. Michele Dickerson suggested that something like Debtors Anonymous may be a useful addition to debtor education precisely because it would add a guilt-based component to the curriculum. The stigmatization would, Dickerson argues, change the debtor's economic philosophy and reduce the likelihood of impulse buying. Differences between DA meetings and DA members Hayes' analysis found differences between DA meetings and DA members. DA's pamphlet Meetings states \\"regular attendance at meetings is an important part of recovery–it is vital for compulsive debtors–and especially for newcomers.\\" Differences between DA meetings and DA members at the same meeting can, however, hinder one in adopting a new world view. As DA's practices are only suggested and not required, one may pick and choose which parts of DA to adhere to or follow. This approach, however, is tolerated to different degrees within different groups. A group's rigidity or flexibility related to DA's suggested practices may hinder identification with the group. Recognition of individual differences, specifically that some members are better role models than others and the inability to identify with experiences of other members, interferes with the world view transformation process. Bankruptcy and debt-shifting Hayes' analysis also noted issues with the way that bankruptcy and debt-shifting are addressed. DA's pamphlet, Debt Payment, explains that bankruptcy is an \\"outside issue,\\" an issue on which DA has no opinion. The pamphlet elaborates, however, that some DA members found bankruptcy only provided a \\"quick fix\\" and did not correct the underlying issues causing them to incur unsecured debt. The pamphlet also notes other DA members believe bankruptcy is a proper course of action in some situations. Debt-shifting is the practice of transferring debt from one creditor to another in order to get a lower interest rate or otherwise make it easier to repay the debt. Debt-shifting is not discussed in official DA literature, although it is discussed in an unofficial auxiliary book based on DA principles. Because DA does not take an official position on bankruptcy and debt-shifting, some groups take stronger positions on these topics than others which can alienate potential members. Unapproved literature Hayes found that the use of unapproved literature in DA groups has been a source of conflict among members. DA suggests studying AA literature in addition to DA literature to gain a better understanding of addictive diseases. Specifically, DA endorses the use of the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions and Alcoholics Anonymous (also known as the \\"Big Book\\"). DA's pamphlet on the use of AA literature and the book The Twelve Steps, Twelve Traditions, and Twelve Concepts of Debtors Anonymous states that DA does not endorse any literature except that which has been Conference-approved. Parallel organizations Debtors Anonymous groups, independent of those already meeting in New York, were formed in the late 1970s by the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) in New York City. They began as a group of 37 participants who had attended credit education classes at the NCNW offices. The NCNW Debtors Anonymous members had four goals: (1) Develop individual budgets and report regularly at group meetings on progress and problems; (2) Select and work with a buddy for mutual support and as a safeguard against spending urges; (3) Educate themselves and fellow members about credit costs, consumer protection laws, and the best prices of goods and services; (4) Set long-term goals and stick with them. Meetings were designed to share information on where to get common products at the best price (clothes, home furnishings, small appliances, food, etc.). Group sharing would usually begin after a member gave a short presentation on a topic she had researched for the meeting. Additional groups were formed supported with grants from Chase Manhattan Bank and the United States Department of Education's consumer education unit. there were chapters in nine major US cities. In response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico an anti-government organization naming itself the National Association of Debtors Anonymous formed. Later, this group merged with El Barzón (a movement of land- owning farmers against the Mexican government).

There also exists a group known as COSA, for those who have been impacted by others' sexual addiction. Introduction SAA was founded in 1977 by several men who wanted a greater sense of anonymity than what they perceived in other twelve step programs for sex addicts. SAA is open to anyone who desires greater control over their behavior, and is intended to be safe for people of all sexual orientations. In SAA each member creates a unique definition of \\"sexual sobriety\\" based on abstaining from a personalized list of compulsive sexual behaviors. Members are encouraged to respect each other's definitions of sobriety. Many SAA members use a \\"three circle\\" concept to model their behaviors. The inner circle represents the compulsive sexual behaviors that must not be practiced. Inner circle behaviors might include having sex with a prostitute, or acting out with a nonconsensual victim. The outer circle includes sexual and nonsexual behaviors that are definitely healthy. Outer circle behaviors might include sex with a partner in a monogamous relationship or getting eight hours of sleep a night. In the middle circle are behaviors that are not considered a relapse (inner circle behaviors), but could quickly lead to one if left unchecked. Middle circle behaviors might include looking for a prostitute or contacting an old acting out partner. In addition to regular meetings SAA also organizes \\"boundary meetings.\\" These are special meetings for professional caregivers such as medical doctors, psychotherapists, and clergy who need to attend meetings separate from clients, patients, and parishioners. Some SAA members (a minority) may have a history of sexual abuse during their childhood, and more substance abuse problems than control groups. SAA publishes the book Sex Addicts Anonymous. It is widely used in SAA and has been officially approved as their basic text by the ISO of SAA, Inc Literature Committee. It has gained the approval of the annual conference of group delegates. Meetings Several types of meetings are offered at SAA: in-person meetings, telemeetings, and online meetings. Meetings can be mixed (meaning both men and women attend) or gender-specific (men-only meetings vs. women-only meetings). Meetings that are advertised as closed are “open only to those individuals who have a desire to stop their addictive behavior\\"; in contrast, open meetings are “open to anyone interested in…SAA,” regardless of whether the individual has expressed a desire to change.SAA — Meetings Additionally, telemeetings, or meetings via conference calls, and internet-based meetings are sources of real-time support outside of the traditional in-person meeting. In the United States, SAA meetings are held in all fifty states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.SAA — Meetings United States In Canada, meetings are in the provinces (East to West) Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. Sponsors A sponsor is a member that has been part of the program for a large period of time and has attained a desirable level of sex sobriety. These individuals will help new members by offering a more personal level of availability in order to answer questions when needed. Usually, newcomers will find a proper sponsor after attending a few meetings taking in consideration the level of comfort between the new member and the old one, but if a good relationship is attained, the new attendee will continue to be guided by this person.SAA — Our Program Sponsorship COSA COSA is a recovery program for family or friends whose lives have been affected by someone else's compulsive sexual behavior. The official name of the organization is the acronym COSA; it is no longer the abbreviation C.O.S.A. as there was no agreement that it stood for either 'Codependents of Sex Addicts' or 'Co-Sex Addicts'. Each COSA member may choose to define him/herself as a codependent of sexual addiction, as a co-sex addict, or simply as a member of COSA, according to his or her own personal experience and conscience.About the COSA Acronym, Steps, and Traditions.

The Bulldogs originally began in 1925 as the Vancouver Meralomas, and played until 1990 (although the team temporarily disbanded during World War II, and did not field a team for the 1958 season). The team moved to Coquitlam in 1991, and was known as the Coquitlam-Meralomas Bulldogs for the first three years. The name was changed to the Tri-City Bulldogs for the 1994 season. During their 14 years in Coquitlam, the Bulldogs compiled a very unimpressive record of 42 wins, 91 losses, and 2 ties. Their lone season of true success came during the 2001 season where they had a record of 7 wins and 3 losses, which gave them first place in the Coastal Division and their first and only berth in the playoffs. However, they lost the playoff game to the Chilliwack Valley Huskers 26-21. The Bulldogs folded after the 2004 season (where they finished with a 2-8 record).

Youth While born and raised in Nigeria, Harbor attended college at Alabama A&M; University in Normal, Alabama the United States. He majored in chemistry and was a forward on the men's soccer team from 1983 to 1986. He was a three time second and third team All-American and held the school's career scoring record when he graduated. Early career Before coming to the US, Harbor had spent time with two Nigerian teams, Nepa F.C. and Enugu Rangers. However, he does not appear to have played professionally for two years after graduating from Alabama A&M.; One article mentions that he worked in a Maryland laboratory for several years after leaving Alabama. He apparently even continued to work at the facility after he began his professional playing career. Professional In June 1988, the Washington Diplomats of the new American Soccer League (ASL) signed Harbor. Diplomats coach, Julio Pinon, spotted Harbor when Harbor was playing in the Embassy Cup Tournament in Washington, D.C. The Diplomats had been having difficulty scoring up to that point in the season, but Harbor made an immediate positive impact. The team went on to win the ASL championship. Harbor continued his high scoring ways in the 1989 season, but was suspended by the league after striking Pedro Magallanes in the face during a game with the Fort Lauderdale Strikers. The suspension ran for a month and helped limit Harbor to seven goals that season. In 1990, Harbor moved to the Maryland Bays. By this time the ASL had merged with the Western Soccer League to form the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). Harbor would spend two seasons with the Bays. In 1990, he scored eight goals as the Bays took the league championship in a 2–1 victory over the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks. In 1991, he led the league in scoring with seventeen goals and eleven assists in twenty games as the Bays fell to the Albany Capitals in the semi-finals. Harbor took first team All APSL and league MVP honors. The team folded at the end of the season. With the collapse of the Bays, Harbor moved indoors in the fall of 1991 with the Baltimore Blast of Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL). However, Harbor once again saw his team fold, this time along with the entire league, at the end of the season. In 1992, Harbor returned to the APSL, this time with the Tampa Bay Rowdies. By this time, the league was struggling and had only five teams remaining. However, Harbor continued his high scoring ways and took the scoring title with thirteen goals and four assists in fifteen games, earning first team All Star honors. The Rowdies reached the championship game, only to fall to the Colorado Foxes. His five goals in four matches led all scorers in the 1992 Professional Cup, which involved eight clubs from three different leagues; the APSL, the CSL, and the NPSL. Just as in the APSL regular season and APSL championship game, the Rowdies were again bested by Colorado in the Cup final. Harbor saw a significant drop in his point production in 1993 as he scored only five goals, adding seven assists, in fourteen games. The Rowdies saw more playoff disappointment as they fell to the Foxes again, this time in the semi- finals. At the end of the season, Harbor again saw his team fold. In 1994, Harbor moved to the Montreal Impact. He gained a measure of revenge on the Colorado Foxes this season as the Impact defeated them in the title game; Harbor scored the lone goal in the Impact's 1–0 victory. In March 1995, Harbor signed with the indoor Buffalo Blizzard of the NPSL. The Blizzard were making a final push for the playoffs. While the Blizzard made the playoffs, they fell to the Cleveland Crunch in the first round. Harbor played seven regular season games, scoring two goals, then another three games in the playoffs for the Blizzard. In April 1995, Major League Soccer (MLS) signed Harbor. However, when the league delayed its first season by a year, the league loaned him to the Seattle SeaDogs of the Continental Indoor Soccer League (CISL). In twenty- six games, he scored forty goals. In February 1996, MLS held its first draft. The Colorado Rapids selected Harbor with the second pick of the draft. In that first season, Harbor led the team in scoring with eleven goals in twenty-nine games, but the Rapids finished at the bottom of the table and failed to make the playoffs. Harbor then injured his knee in the 1997 pre-season, requiring surgery. The Rapids released Harbor in June 1997. After being released by the Rapids, Harbor returned to the Seattle SeaDogs where he was MVP of the All Star game. That season Harbor also helped lead Seattle to the final CISL Championship defeating the Houston Hotshots 2 games to 0. Once again, Harbor saw a team and a league fold at the end of the season. In October 1997, Harbor moved to the Florida ThunderCats of the NPSL as the team began preparations for its first, and ultimately, its only season. The ThunderCats had significant financial problems during the 1998–1999 season and sold Harbor's contract to the Philadelphia KiXX just prior to the 1999 playoffs. Harbor's time in Philadelphia included only the end of the 1998–1999 season and the playoffs. National team In 1992, Harbor became an American citizen. US coach Bora Milutinović quickly called him up for a 9 October match with Canada. Harbor went on to earn fourteen caps while Milutinovic was coach, but he was unable to score. Milutinovic dropped him from the national team after the 1993 Copa America, but he earned one more cap under Steve Sampson on 16 October 1996. The regular national team players had gone on strike and USSF was forced to field an ad hoc player line up for a game against Peru. Post playing career In 2004, Harbor worked for NASA.

Medici porcelain was the first successful attempt in Europe to make imitations of Chinese porcelain, though it was soft-paste porcelain rather than the hard-paste made in Asia. The experimental manufactory housed in the Casino of San Marco in Florence existed between 1575 and 1587 under the patronage of Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Surviving examples are extremely rare, and the great majority of the 60-70 examples are in museums. A painted mark of Brunelleschi's dome and a capital letter F appear on the underside of some pieces; others bear the Medici palle, the balls that are the Medici heraldic charge.

However, the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines had initially resisted the proposal. Malcolm thus arranged for the Manila YMCA to offer law courses, which commenced in 1910. Malcolm acted as the Secretary of these law courses. Within a year, the Board of Regents relented and the University of the Philippines adopted these classes by formally establishing the College of Law on January 12, 1911.George A. Malcolm, American Colonial Careerist, p. 96 The college was formally opened in with fifty (50) Filipino and American students.Jorge R. Coquia. Legal Profession. Rex Bookstore, 1993. Justice Sherman Moreland of the Philippine Supreme Court, the first acting Dean of the college, eventually declined to take on the position full-time.George A. Malcolm, American Colonial Careerist, p. 97 He was thus replaced by Malcolm, who served until his appointment as an Associate Justice of the Philippine Supreme Court in 1917. In 1964, the University of the Philippines Law Center was established as an agency attached to the college of law, the University of the Philippines Law Center was created to conduct continuing legal education programs, as well as legal research and publications. In the 1960s up to the 1980s, the four-year law program consisted of one-hundred-twenty-two (122) units which emphasize the eight bar subjects listed in the Revised Rules of Court: civil law, criminal law, remedial law, legal ethics and legal forms, commercial law, political law, tax law, labor law, public corporation and public officers, and international law.Section 6, Rule 138, Revised Rules of Court of the Philippines. The program also included non-bar subjects such as legal history, legal bibliography, statutory construction, jurisprudence, trial techniques, thesis and legal research, legal medicine, and practice court. In addition to Philippine laws and jurisprudence, foreign legal materials from Spain, the United States and other Asian countries were integrated into the curriculum. Students were introduced to basic principles of Roman civil law, English common law, and other international legal systems.Jorge R. Coquia. Legal Profession. Rex Bookstore, 1993 In 1988, the college launched a core-elective curriculum, permitting law students to enroll up to twenty (20) percent of their total academic load for elective subjects. The effort was made to incorporate specializations in legal education. In 1989, the college followed a revised model law curriculum adopted by the Philippine Department of Education. The program composed of 51 subjects (124 academic units) which took effect in 1990. It offered additional non-bar subjects such as legal profession, legal ethics, legal counselling, legal research, and legal writing. In recognition of the College as \\"the country’s premier institution in providing quality legal education\\" and in honor of its \\"significant contributions to national development since it was founded in 1911,\\" President Benigno Aquino III declared 2011 as the \\"University of the Philippines College of Law Centennial Year\\" and authorized, among others, the creation of commemorative stamps by the Philippine Postal Corporation.. Programs and admissions The College first conferred the Juris Doctor (J.D.) on its April 2008 graduates, after a change in degree title was approved by the U.P. administration the previous year. Like the majority of law schools in the country, U.P. used to provide the Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), a standard four- year law program covering all subjects in the bar exams, until the change to J.D. was made in order to reflect more accurately the U.P. law program being a \\"professional as well as a post baccalaureate degree.\\" The College has relaunched its Master of Laws program in August 2019. At an average of 8%, the College has the lowest admission rateAdmission rate refers to the proportion of admission offers in relation to the total number of applications. among Philippine law schools. The criteria for admissions include the aggregate of weights assigned to an applicant’s scores in the Law Aptitude Examination and undergraduate General Weighted Average (GWA), in addition to the scores obtained during an in-person interview with the admissions committee composed of faculty members. Through the Law Center, the College conducts Mandatory Continuing Legal Education programs for the members of the Philippine Bar, consisting of a series of seminars on various aspects of the legal and judicial profession offered throughout the year. The College also hosts various conferences, fora, colloquia and workshops, which serve as formal and informal channels of communication, information, and education provided by the Law Center. Rankings UP Law has been ranked as \\"still the best law school in the Philippines\\" by the Legal Education Board in its ranking of top performing law schools in 2015 based on cumulative performance of law schools in the 2012, 2013 and 2014 Bar examinations. It was likewise the country's top performing law school, with a passing rate of 89.73%, in the 2015 bar exams. , UP Law is ranked 251-300 in the QS World University Rankings among all law schools in the world. It is the sole Philippine law school in the list. Campuses The UP Law Complex Malcolm Hall Malcolm Hall The main offices and classrooms of the college are located inside Malcolm Hall within the U.P. Diliman Campus in Quezon City. The building is named after Associate Justice George Malcolm, who in 1911 became the first permanent dean of the college. The building itself, one of the oldest in the Diliman campus, was designed by the noted architect Juan M. Arellano. It was built under the supervision of the construction firm Pedro Siochi and Company. It was erected shortly before the Japanese invasion of the Philippines during World War II, but it was only after the University of the Philippines transferred its main campus to Diliman in 1948 that Malcolm Hall was actually used. Malcolm Hall also houses the University of the Philippines Law Library, formally known as Espiritu Hall. It the largest academic law library in the country. It contains the largest and most up-to-date collection of Philippine legal materials as well as foreign statute and case books and various law journals. The library is open to U.P. law students and professors. It is also available to non-UP law students subject to proper identification and payment of library service fees.Office of the Librarian, University of the Philippines Law Library, May 2006. Several of the classrooms in Malcolm Hall are named after prominent graduates and faculty members, such as Ambrosio Padilla, Bienvenido Ambion, and Violeta Calvo-Drilon. There is also an airconditioned moot court resembling the trial courts in the Philippines,Office of the College Secretary, University of the Philippines College of Law, May 2006. a student lounge and an auditorium. Fronting the auditorium is the main lobby of Malcolm Hall. On its walls are inscribed a quotation from the American Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. – THE BUSINESS OF LAW SCHOOL IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY DESCRIBED WHEN YOU MERELY SAY THAT IT IS TO TEACH LAW OR TO MAKE LAWYERS. IT IS TO TEACH LAW IN THE GRAND MANNER AND TO MAKE GREAT LAWYERS :::::::::::::::::::- HOLMES In 2013, a historical marker was unveiled at the façade of Malcolm Hall as part of the college’s centennial celebrations. In his letter to the National Historical Commission, then dean Danilo Concepcion said that the marker was installed to “inscribe in stone” the “significance and impact of the U.P. College of Law to our country’s history as a nation.” Bocobo Hall Bocobo Hall Adjacent to Malcolm Hall is Bocobo Hall, which houses the University of the Philippines Law Center. The Law Center was established in 1964 as an agency attached to the College of Law, for the purpose of conducting continuing legal education programs, as well as legal research and publications.Republic Act No. 3870, 1964. The Law Center is the university center for legal publishing, legal research, and law conferences. It is composed of 4 Institutes, namely, the Institute of Government and Law Reform, the Institute of Human Rights, the Institute of International Legal Studies, and the Institute of Judicial Administration.The U.P. Law Complex, last accessed August 2007. The Law Center also hosts the offices of the Office of the National Administrative Registrar, an agency of the Philippine government which registers all national government statutes and issuances. To \\"popularize\\" the law, the Law Center conducts programs in legal literacy and street law (\\"practical law\\") in cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), student organizations, and the local barangays. Extension programs happen in the form of barangay legal education seminars to reach the grassroots level.Line-up of activities, University of the Philippines Law Center, September–October 2006. Henry Sy Sr. Hall Henry Sy Sr. Hall opened in 2016 and houses the UP Bonifacio Global City campus. It serves as a satellite unit of UP Diliman. Located at the Bonifacio Global City district in Taguig, the campus hosts classes of the College of Law, and graduate courses and professional degree programs of other academic arms of UP Diliman, such as the Virata School of Business and the School of Statistics. The nine-level structure is the 17th constituent unit of the UP System and was built at a cost of around P400 million through a donation by SM Investments. The campus building is named after Henry Sy, former chairman and CEO of SM Investments.

Retrieved 27 August 2014. It has been introduced to several countries far from its native range, including the United States, Australia, the Philippines, and Taiwan. This species is popular among aquarists. G. brasiliensis is part of a species complex that also includes the rarer G. diamantinensis, G. iporangensis, G. itapicuruensis, G. multiocellus, G. obscurus, G. rufomarginatus and G. santosi from the Brazilian state of Bahia (most species) or São Paulo (G. iporangensis). Appearance G. brasiliensis - male G. brasiliensis - pair with fry The males can reach a length up to , while females only reach a bit more than half that size. Its main body colour can be pale light brown to dark blue or almost purple; their colours change with moods and during mating sessions. The pearl cichlid has one dark spot which may visible on its body, located towards its tail; it also may display several black bands running top to bottom down its body. Its markings, which cover its body, are bright blue speckles which shine brightly in a healthy fish; they have red fins which may have blueish tones and be tipped in black, but these colours also may change, brighten, or fade depending on the mood. They can grow quite large, with males reaching just over a foot and females generally a little smaller. In a group, they usually pair up once they are around 2–3 in long; at this time they can be quite territorial, and keep other fish away from their breeding space.  Breeding  The sex of the fish is often unclear until it reaches adult size, at which point the size difference between the genders becomes pronounced. Breeders often attempt to pair the fish without sexing them; two females may pair up in which case the fish lay eggs that never hatch. Once a male-female pair is found, they tend to yield 150–200 offspring after successfully mating. Unlike certain other species, they do not have to be separated from their young. Introduction to Australia In Australia, it has been released into the Tweed River system, New South Wales, and the Swan River system, Western Australia, where it inhabits fresh and brackish water at a wide range of pHs.

SLAA was founded in Boston, Massachusetts in 1976, by a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Though he had been a member of AA for many years, he repeatedly acted out and was serially unfaithful to his wife. He founded SLAA as an attempt to stop his compulsive sexual and \\"romantic\\" behavior. SLAA is also sometimes known as the Augustine Fellowship, because early members saw many of their shared symptoms described by St. Augustine of Hippo in his work Confessions. COSLAA is another twelve- step fellowship created to support the family members and friends of sex and love addicts. SLAA encourages members to identify their own \\"bottom-line behaviors.\\" The organization identifies these behaviors as \\"any sexual or emotional act, no matter what its initial impulse may be, which leads to loss of control over rate, frequency, or duration of its occurrence or recurrence, resulting in spiritual, mental, physical, emotional, and moral destruction of oneself and others.\\" Maintaining \\"sobriety\\" in the SLAA program requires abstaining from one's bottom-line behaviors. However, these behaviors are never set in stone and may change as SLAA members continue in the program. Examples of bottom-line behaviors might include sexual or romantic activity outside the scope of monogamous relationships, anonymous or casual sex, compulsive avoidance of intimacy or emotional attachment, one-night stands, compulsive masturbation, obsessive fantasy, compulsive attraction to unavailable or abusive partners, and a wide variety of addictive sexual, romantic, or avoidant behaviors. Many of those practicing the SLAA recovery program develop the ability to engage in a healthy committed relationship. SLAA encourages recovery from sexual anorexia, emotional anorexia and social anorexia, three related areas of self-deprivation that lead to isolation and often accompany patterns of addictive behavior. SLAA publishes the book Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous. It is approved by the organization for use in their fellowship. In an article regarding the applicability of 12-Step fellowships to black women, Feminist theorist Christine Saulnier criticized the SLAA book, contending that it ignored the social and political circumstances under which sexual behaviors arise and are labeled deviant.

Breaking the gender stereotypes of its time, the play and film boldly suggested that women had a place outside of the home. The plot follows an influential politician who returns to her former college to receive an honorary degree only to find her old flame as the university president. Goodbye, My Fancy was the third and last cinematic collaboration between Sherman and Crawford, the first two being Harriet Craig and The Damned Don't Cry in 1950.\\"Goodbye, My Fancy\\". Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved January 26, 2014. Plot Powerful U.S. Representative Agatha Reed (Joan Crawford) returns to her alma mater to receive an honorary degree. Unbeknownst to the college's board of trustees, Agatha was expelled from the school years earlier for participating in an all-night date with a young professor, Dr. James Merrill (Robert Young), who is now the university president. The romantic fires are rekindled when the two meet. Matt Cole (Frank Lovejoy), a photographer from Life magazine who loves Agatha, believes her feeling for Merrill is simply an unresolved holdover from her girlhood and follows her to the school. Agatha becomes embroiled in a university matter over progressive teaching methods with Dr. Pitt (Morgan Farley), board trustee Claude Griswold (Howard St. John) and his wife Ellen Griswold (Lurene Tuttle). A film Agatha made about the dangers of restricting intellectual freedom is to be shown on campus to celebrate her legacy, but the reactionary Griswold forces Merrill to cancel the showing. Merrill will not stand up to Griswold, and though Merrill consents to show the film if Agatha's expulsion is not revealed, he lies to his daughter about the reason why. After a series of misunderstandings, Agatha realizes she belongs with Cole and should forget the way she fancied Merrill.

Warner about running over budget: \\"After talking to you on the telephone last night, Friday, I am depending on you to finish the picture by next Saturday, November 18th [1950]. As I told you, other companies are making the same type of picture in 21-28-36 days with important casts. As you know, MGM made Father's Little Dividend, with Spencer Tracy, Elizabeth Taylor and Joan Bennett in 21 days and I am sure the Director had the same problems you have had. You will just have to do this. Otherwise, we cannot stand off this type of cost and delay in making a picture. Those days are gone and no one is going to stay on the team unless they can carry the ball. Get in there and finish the picture by next Saturday or before and stop trying for perfection. No one is interested but yourself and I am sure you are not going to pay to see the picture.\\" Large portions of the film were shot at the University of Redlands in Redlands, California. Reception The critics were mixed on the success of the film. Variety commented, \\"Performances are very slick, under Vincent Sherman's direction. Miss Crawford...sustains the romantic, middle-aged congresswoman with a light touch that is excellent.\\"Quirk, Lawrence J.. The Films of Joan Crawford. The Citadel Press, 1968. However, Bosley Crowther in The New York Times generally panned the film, writing, \\"Miss Crawford's errant congresswoman is as aloof and imposing as the capital dome\\" and \\"Joan Crawford is working extra hard to make romance and liberalism attractive in the Warner's film version [of the play]. And when Miss Crawford makes a mighty effort to do what she obviously regards as a significant piece of performing, the atmosphere is electrically charged. At least, it is loaded with tension—or a reasonable facsimile thereof—when Miss Crawford herself is posing or parading within the camera's range.

Magnetic starters also provide under-voltage and overload protection and an automatic cutoff in the event of a power failure. Implementation A magnetic starter has a contactor and an overload relay, which will open the control voltage to the starter coil if it detects an overload on a motor. Overload relays may rely on heat produced by the motor current to operate a bimetal contact or release a contact held closed by a low-melting-point alloy. The overload relay opens a set of contacts that are wired in series with the supply to the contactor feeding the motor. The characteristics of the heaters can be matched to the motor so that the motor is protected against overload. Recently, microprocessor-controlled motor digital protective relays offer more comprehensive protection of motors. Due to the electromagnet in the contactor, if power to the machine should fail the contactor will automatically disengage. Unlike machines with an ordinary latching switch (such as a common light switch), when the power is resumed the machine will not operate until being turned on again. As a result, magnetic starters often use momentary switches for \\"off\\" and \\"on\\" functions, as this type of switch returns to a defined normal position when released. Latching switches do not have this feature and therefore are normally not used with a magnetic starter. Motor control contactors can be fitted with short-circuit protection (fuses or circuit breakers), disconnecting means, overload relays and an enclosure to make a combination starter. Several combination starters and other switchgear and control devices can be grouped in a common enclosure called a motor control center. Operation Typically starters are operated by two push switches, a \\"start\\" switch which is normally-off (i.e. push-to- make) and a \\"stop\\" switch which is normally-on (i.e. push-to-break). When the motor is not running, although line voltage is available, no current is drawn by the starter or motor. When the \\"start\\" button is pressed, the motor is not powered directly, rather the electromagnet in the contactor is energized. The magnetic switch in the contactor then engages, simultaneously switching current to the motor and providing self-sustaining current to maintain its own state. Thus when the start button is released, the magnetic switch remains engaged and the motor remains running. Pressing the \\"stop\\" button breaks the circuit to the contactor which consequently de-energizes its electromagnet thus cutting current to the motor. Applications Magnetic starters are commonly found on equipment drawing several horsepower or higher. Examples include woodworking machinery such as cabinet saws or shapers. Machines with smaller loads, such as a drill press or most handheld tools normally use only a switch instead. Magnetic starters are stock components for many machines, and aftermarket starters are also available for use as replacements or for retrofitting older machines. Federal OSHA recognizes NFPA 79 2007 Edition standard 7.5.3 states \\"Upon restoration of the voltage or upon switching on the incoming supply, automatic or unintentional restarting of the machine shall be prevented when such a restart causes a hazardous condition.

Provinces (pokrajine) were: * Slovenia * Croatia and Slavonia * Dalmatia * Bosnia and Herzegovina * Banat, Bačka, Baranja * Serbia ** Northern Serbia ** Southern Serbia * Montenegro 1922–1929 Oblasts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes The Vidovdan Constitution of 1921 established the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes as a unitary state and, in 1922, 33 new administrative oblasts (provinces) ruled from the center were instituted: *Oblast of Banja Luka *Oblast of Belgrade *Oblast of Bihać *Oblast of Bitola *Oblast of Cetinje (Zeta Oblast) *Oblast of Čačak (Raška Oblast) *Oblast of Ćuprija *Oblast of Dubrovnik *Oblast of Karlovec *Oblast of Kragujevac (Šumadija Oblast) *Oblast of Kruševac *Oblast of Ljubljana *Oblast of Maribor *Oblast of Mostar *Oblast of Niš *Oblast of Novi Sad (Bačka Oblast) *Oblast of Osijek *Oblast of Požarevac *Oblast of Pristina (Kosovo Oblast) *Oblast of Sarajevo *Oblast of Smederevo (Podunavlje Oblast) *Oblast of Split *Oblast of Skopje *Oblast of Šabac (Podrinje Oblast) *Oblast of Štip *Oblast of Travnik *Oblast of Tuzla *Oblast of Užice (Zlatibor Oblast?) *Oblast of Valjevo *Oblast of Vranje *Oblast of Vukovar (Syrmia Oblast) *Oblast of Zagreb *Oblast of Zaječar (Timok Oblast) 1929–1941 Banovinas of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Banovina of Croatia From 1929, the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was renamed Kingdom of Yugoslavia and was subdivided into nine new provinces called banovinas. Their borders were intentionally drawn so that they would not correspond either to boundaries between ethnic groups, or to pre–World War I imperial borders. They were named after various geographic features, mostly rivers. Slight changes to their borders were made in 1931 with the new Yugoslav Constitution. The banovinas were as follow: *Drava Banovina (Dravska banovina), with its capital in Ljubljana (1929–1941) *Sava Banovina (Savska banovina), with its capital in Zagreb (1929–1939) *Littoral Banovina (Primorska banovina), with its capital in Split (1929–1939) *Vrbas Banovina (Vrbaska banovina), with its capital in Banja Luka (1929–1941) *Drina Banovina (Drinska banovina), with its capital in Sarajevo (1929–1941) *Zeta Banovina (Zetska banovina), with its capital in Cetinje (1929–1941) *Danube Banovina (Dunavska banovina), with its capital in Novi Sad (1929–1941) *Morava Banovina (Moravska banovina), with its capital in Niš (1929–1941) *Vardar Banovina (Vardarska banovina), with its capital in Skopje (1929–1941) *The City Administration of Belgrade, together with Zemun and Pančevo was also an administrative unit. As an accommodation to Yugoslav Croats, the Banovina of Croatia (Banovina Hrvatska) was formed in 1939 from a merger of the Littoral (Maritime) and Sava Banovinas, with some additional territory from the Vrbas and Zeta Banovinas. Like Sava, its capital was Zagreb. 1941–1944 Axis occupation and partition of Yugoslavia in World War II During World War II, Kingdom of Yugoslavia was occupied and partitioned by the Axis powers and was divided into 3 Axis puppet states: *Independent State of Croatia *Italian governorate of Montenegro (later German occupied territory of Montenegro) *the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia (including autonomous German- ruled Banat) Other parts of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia were occupied by German, Italian, Hungarian, Bulgarian and Albanian Axis troops. 1945–1992 Republics and provinces of the SFR Yugoslavia Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was divided into 6 republics and two autonomous provinces: *Serbia (including autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo) *Montenegro *Bosnia and Herzegovina *Croatia *Slovenia *Macedonia Successor states Successor states of former Yugoslavia, 2008 After dissolution of Yugoslavia, in 1991–1992, five successor states were formed: *Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1992–2003), in 2003 transformed into state union of Serbia and Montenegro, which in 2006 was dissolved into independent states of Serbia and Montenegro, in 2008 Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia. *Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina later Bosnia and Herzegovina *Republic of Croatia *Republic of Slovenia *Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in 2019 renamed to Republic of North Macedonia in order to comply with the Prespa agreement and solve the Macedonia naming dispute, also formerly known as The Republic of Macedonia before joining the United Nations.

It is a low to medium, spreading shrub with silvery- grey, hairy foliage and blue to lilac flowers, and sometimes grows in dense thickets with mulga. Description Eremophila bowmanii is a shrub which usually grows to a height and width of grows but sometimes as high as . Its branches, leaves, flower stalks and sepals are all covered with tangled, silvery hairs making the plant appear silvery-grey. The leaves are long, wide and range in shape from linear to egg-shaped or almost circular. The flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils on a stalk long. There are 5 pointed, green to purple sepals which are long and are covered with silvery hairs. The petals are about long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tube is a shade of purple or lilac, rarely white, sometimes with small purple spots inside the tube. The tube and the petal lobes on its end are mostly glabrous except for inside the tube which is woolly. There are 4 stamens which are enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering mostly occurs from winter to late spring and is followed by fruit which are oval-shaped, long and woody with a papery covering. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1861 and the description was published in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (bowmanii) honours the collector of the type specimen, Edward M. Bowman, a station worker. In 1992, Robert Chinnock described three subspecies in his book, Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae, and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: *E. bowmanii F.Muell. subsp. bowmanii which has linear leaves with their edges rolled under; *E. bowmanii subsp. latifolia (L.S.Sm.) Chinnock which has leaves that are flat, lance- or egg- shaped with the narrower end towards the base, and spreading flowers; *E. bowmanii subsp. nutans Chinnock which has egg-shaped to almost circular leaves with thickened edges, and flowers that hang from their stalks. Distribution and habitat Eremophila bowmanii is widespread and common in central parts of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland growing in red soils in mulga, mallee and woodland. (There is one record from South Australia.) Ecology This species sometimes grows in dense stands, sometimes indicating overgrazing of grasses by livestock but it is not usually itself eaten by cattle or sheep. Conservation status Eremophila bowmanii is listed as \\"not at risk\\". Use in horticulture Silver turkeybush is a popular garden plant and one of the most attractive small, grey-leaved eremophilas. It can be propagated from seed or from cuttings but needs to be grafted onto Myoporum species in temperate areas like Sydney or when grown in alkaline soil. It grows best in well-drained soil in a sunny position and is drought and frost tolerant.

Al Sheikh Muhammed Jameel Didi (Dhivehi: މުޙައްމަދު ޖަމީލުދީދީ) (May 1, 1915 - March 15, 1989), popularly known as Jameel Didi, was a Maldivian political figure and poet who was famous for his writings and speeches. He was born on 1 May 1915 to Abdullah Kamaaludhin the Attorney General and Fenfoa'gan'duvaru Aminaa Didi. At first, he studied at the Majeedhiyya School and later went abroad to Egypt and studied at Al-Azhar University. After returning, he became a member of the sentence committee (niyaa kanda alhaa komety). He later served as Minister of Justice from 10 September 1953 and as Attorney General from 30 May 1956. Muhammad Jameel Didi has written many books. To help with Dhivehi grammar he wrote a book called \\"Fiyavalhu\\", and also \\"kudakudhinge bageecha 1\\" and \\"kudakudhinge bageecha 2\\", two Dhivehi children's books. He also wrote Islamic books such as \\"Thauleemuh Dhiyana\\" and \\"Dhuroosul Akhlaaq\\". The Maldivian national anthem, Gaumii salaam, uses lyrics written by Jameel Didi in 1948 and until 1972 was sung to the tune of Auld Lang Syne which he heard on his uncle's alarm clock. Many of Jameel's children and grandchildren were and are renowned politicians in the governments of Presidents Maumoon and Nasheed. Sheikh Jameel Didi died on March 15, 1989 at the age of 73. He is buried in Galolhu Cemetery where many of the Maldivian royal family are buried. After his death the honour of Usthazul Jeel (the teacher of the generation) was bestowed upon him by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. Muhammad Jameel was one of the foremost Maldivian learned men.

It basks on stone walls, rocks, and trees. It is usually found in rocky habitats, and is quite shy, being very ready to dive into cracks to hide from potential predators. Etymology The common name \\"stellion\\" comes from Latin stellio, stēlio (stelliōn-, stēliōn-), which referred to any spotted lizard, from stella, star. Subspecies There are several subspecies, and S. stellio is likely a species complex. More research will be done, and this species may yet be split into several species. The following seven subspecies, including the nominotypical subspecies, are recognized as being valid. *Stellagama stellio brachydactyla *Stellagama stellio cypriaca *Stellagama stellio daani *Stellagama stellio picea *Stellagama stellio salehi *Stellagama stellio stellio *Stellagama stellio vulgaris Nota bene: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than Stellagama.

In 1908 the Works Department decided to construct the typhoon shelter at Yau Ma Tei. Works on the typhoon shelter lasted from 1910 to 1915. The cost was HK$2.21 million. The typhoon shelter was officially opened by Sir Francis Henry May, then Governor of Hong Kong, on 16 December 1915. The Yau Ma Tei Boat People settled in the shelter from around 1916 to 1990. The West Kowloon Reclamation Project began in 1990 as part of the Airport Core Programme, which required a replacement for the original typhoon shelter. The new typhoon shelter was built to the west of the original one, and was completed in 1992. Housing estates built on the reclaimed land of the initial typhoon shelter include: Park Avenue, Charming Garden and Hoi Fu Court.

The Official Artist Website. Retrieved 2011-04-11. Once signed to Sony Records, her/his professional entertainment career started at the very young age of just 8 years old. Besides having a music career, she has done everything from acting roles to being a radio personality and even modeling on the catwalk. His/her first major concert was opening for the group Black Box as the front man for Subsonic Factor in front of a sold-out capacity crowd at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, Japan. Since then Chosen has performed all around the world in shows with artists such as Ja Rule and The Prodigy. Early life Chosen Effect grew up in a Baptist household with both parents being heavily involved in the church. Her/His Dad was a deacon and singer in the church whilst her mom sung and was a Sunday school teacher. His/Her parents had a passion for music and both played musical instruments, dad the guitar while mom played the organ. These musical influences rubbed off on Chosen early on as by the age of 6 he/she was already playing the piano by ear and soon after the drums. This eventually led the young talent to become the church pianist and the director of the youth choir. Chosens first live show was at the young age of 8 years old which she played the piano and sung to a crowd of about 400 people. Soon after, Chosen had started to learn how to produce her own music and was even DJing & MCing. Career Entertainment beginnings Growing up a military brat Chosen eventually ended up living on an army base in Japan with his family. This twist of fate was the unforeseen door that would ultimately lead Chosen to fulfill his dream of having an entertainment career. In the 1990s, young and eager to make his entertainment desires a reality, Chosen's agent decided to seize each and every opportunity that became available. After tons of small acting roles, the first major break was a televised weekly dance competition that featured some of Japan's top hip-hop dancers. Chosen won that competition 3 weeks in a row which led to some valuable new contacts being made. He soon found himself in a regular role as a dancer on a variety show & on the weekends he also performed dance shows with a crew. When he was not dancing he was taking on any other entertainment offering that was available. Chosen's hard work leads to a recording contract. Subsonic Factor Chosen Effects first major recording contract was signed with Sony Music Entertainment Japan. As the story goes, Sony was looking for a cool rapper to rap on a Techno track for a compilation CD. A friend from the TV show that Chosen used to appear on approached him about the opportunity to go to a Sony recording studio and be featured on a track. Even though he was an R&B;/hip- hop performer and had never listened to any dance music let alone try to rap on any, he decided to give it a try and seize the moment. Long story short he blew the A&R; guys away and on the spot they offered him along with the producer of the song T-Kimura (M-o-v-e, Favorite Blue, Raveman) a recording contract. A third member for the group was also sourced named Christina Hane. Chosen Effect, whose stage name at the time was Terry-T, was the front man for his Sony signed group Subsonic Factor. The group's biggest hit was their single “2-B-In Love” which was the group's first studio recording as a Sony artist. Originally the song appeared on a CD compilation called Tokyo House Underground Vol 1 but was also featured on a compilation CD called Tokyo Babylon and of course it also appeared on the group's debut album called Echoes. This song became an anthem for the unit with the song gaining even more popularity thanks to it being used in a TV commercial as well as the theme song for a Japanese Anime. The group's success saw them having their faces plastered on the back of magazines and interviewed regularly on TV. Subsonic Factor went on to have other music releases and their next album after Echoes was called Too Latehomepage1.nifty.com/eurobeat/cd_list/techno_house/album_s.htm and showcased a different sound than their previous album. Every show that was ever performed by this amazing unit was always sold out, however, creative differences would lead to the group's members (Chosen, Christina, and T-Kimura) wanting to pursue other ventures. This was the birth of multiple solo projects by Chosen and the official launch of his solo music career. Terry-T He soon found himself with a hit single on his hands. His first hit single as a solo artist was called “Vamo La Verdy” & the song went gold. It was released by Pony Canyon in Japan & became the official support song for the then champion J-League professional soccer team Verdy. His next single was released for the Japanese Woman's Professional Wrestling league called Deep Up. The Japan Broadcasting Corporation then asked Chosen if he would do a sports theme album. The album was called “Action” and the great songs kept flowing with tracks like Silent Dance dedicated to the memory of F1 legend Ayrton Senna. Chosen Effects music has also been featured in movie soundtracks like the Japanese movie called “B” & also video games such as the song “Power” featured in the PlayStation game Bust-a-Move. Raveman Raveman exploded on the scene after a Chosen's old Subsonic Factor member T.Kimura, Japanese Dj Gee (GTS), & and another good friend Motsu aka US Tom (More Deep) decided to put together a Dance unit with Chosen once again taking his place as frontman. The unit had tons of success in the Japanese dance scene. The debut album called “Pumpin” in fact had multiple songs chart very well in the Japanese club charts. Raveman shows were full of energy which was a perfect fit for the high octane dance music.

Raveman music has also been featured in Japanese Anime such as the song called “Shin-chan” which was featured in the very popular Japanese Anime by the same name.

The premier team is called the Richmond Bulldogs and compete in Auckland Rugby League's Fox Memorial competition. Early history The club was formed in 1913 by employees at Mr. B. W. Davis' Boot Factory and Elliott's, following a scratch game in 1912. The club was originally affiliated with the Eden Ramblers club. In 1883 the land surrounding Grey Lynn Park was subdivided and the houses were built. The area that is now Grey Lynn Park was too steep to build houses on and so, in 1914, the area was drained and flattened so sport could be played. Flood lights were installed at the park in the 1950s. Richmond enjoyed considerable success in the middle decades of the 1900s. They were the first club to win the Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster, and Stormont Shield in 1934. They went on to win these trophies several more times in the following years. They also defeated 4 Australian club teams from 1934 to 1939 (including the Sydney champions - Western Suburbs 18–16, and 10–3 in 1934). This saw them win the Rangatira Shield, played for between Sydney and Auckland clubs. They won the Fox Memorial in 1934, 1935, 1937, 1940, 1946, 1949, 1951, 1955 and 1956. Bartercard Cup The Richmond club were involved in the Bartercard Cup as a joint venture with the Marist Saints between 2000 and 2005. This team was called the Marist Richmond Brothers.

The first Heritage Round was in 2003 and had been continuing every year until 2008.  Origin  The concept of the Heritage Round originated from the Centenary Celebration Round, which took place in 1996, in the centenary year of the VFL/AFL. As a tribute, the 8 original teams of the VFL played each other in Round 7, 100 years after Round 1 in the inaugural season. defeated at the MCG, while defeated Fitzroy, lost to , and lost to . The remaining eight clubs played in their normal jumpers, as they came into the VFL/AFL at different times, not 1897.  Heritage Round Over The Years   2003 – The First Heritage Round  The first Heritage Round saw Heritage guernseys worn by all teams except two. The Adelaide and West Coast Football Clubs (who played each other during the round) both had a short history had always used a variant of their original jumper throughout their existence. It was seen in a very positive and nostalgic light, especially as Brisbane wore the 1968 to 1973 Fitzroy guernsey which was Maroon and Navy Blue and Sydney wore their 1933 to 1986 South Melbourne/Sydney guernsey. St. Kilda's guernsey got such a positive reaction that it became their Clash Guernsey from 2004 until 2006. Port Adelaide wore its SANFL Magpies \\"Prison Bar\\" guernsey from 1914 when the club was made Champions of Australia.  2004 – Adelaide and West Coast and the Umpires Join In  2004 saw the first year where all sixteen teams wore a heritage guernsey.www.footyjumpers.com It was also the first year which the Field and Goal Umpires wore uniforms from the past as well. All the umpires wore White uniforms (the traditional colour the umpires wore before changing to coloured uniforms) and the Goal Umpires wore their traditional long coats and White brimmed hats. Brisbane chose to wear the Brisbane Bears guernsey worn from 1992 until 1996, West Coast wore an original 1987 guernsey and Adelaide manufactured a guernsey based on a 1991 original with the SANFL logo on the back and AFC monogram on the front. Port Adelaide wore a Magenta and Blue guernsey based on their original guernsey from 1877 to 1901, prior to its famous black and White \\"Prison Bar\\" guernsey.  2005 – Complacent or Outlandish  In 2005 it was starting to become clear that the current concept of heritage round had either become stale or made clubs make outlandish choices. The Field Umpires wore replica uniforms from an old fashioned period (with colours brought back) that were unpractical in modern day. The Saints wore a guernsey worn during the First World War in which White was replaced with Gold so they were not to be seen as a supporter of Germany. Hawthorn's guernsey was not Brown and Gold, but Red, White, and Blue from its 1902 guernsey worn when they were a part of the VFA. The Adelaide Football club wore a 1930s South Australia state guernsey with an AFC insignia replacing SA, where Port Adelaide Football Club wore a White guernsey with Light Blue hoops based on their first guernsey in the SANFL. With the focus of heritage round starting to turn into a gimmick the AFL knew they had so do something to re-invigorate the interest. The result came in the following year.  2006 – The Electrifying Eighties  The 2006 heritage round was themed around football in the 1980s. This achieved very heavy media coverage with both The Footy Show and Before the Game taking on 80s themes and both dressing up in clothes from the 1980s. The AFL even release a compilation CD of songs recorded during the 1980s. Brisbane wore the 1987 to 1990 Brisbane Bears clash guernsey, a variant of its original Brisbane Bears guernsey (which was always criticized during its existence up until 1992, especially when its Gold and Maroon colours were changed to Gold and Cerise.) Adelaide wore a modified home guernsey, including an AFC monogrammed crest featuring all the colours of all the teams in the SANFL from the 80s. Melbourne wore a guernsey with Red and Royal Blue instead of its Red and Navy Blue it used prior to 1974 with the introduction of colour TV. Richmond wore Yellow Shorts from the 1980s with their 1980s Guernsey with printed laces. Essendon wore Red shorts as they did in the 1980s when they played Carlton in the battle for the Wooden Spoon. (The two clubs were clearly the worst performers in the league that year and the match ended in a draw. Carlton coach Denis Pagan famously described it as feeling like \\"Dancing with your Sister\\".) The AFL prevented Port Adelaide from wearing their 1980's SANFL guernsey.  2007 – Living In The Seventies  The 2007 Heritage Round was based on Football in the 1970s. It took place in July from the 7th to the 9th. Once again it generated media coverage both in News broadcasts and both The Footy Show and Before the Game holding 70s themed shows. As West Coast were not established in the 70s they chose to wear the original WA State of Origin guernsey from the first State of Origin game played against Victoria. They lost to Brisbane who wore the Red and Blue Fitzroy Guernsey worn 1975 to 1996. Adelaide wore the same guernsey as what was worn in the 2006 Heritage Round in its defeat against Hawthorn. Port Adelaide's application to the AFL for its 70s Black and White \\"Prison Bar\\" was rejected at first but an agreement was later reached with Collingwood and the AFL for Port to wear the guernsey this year but with conditions for further heritage rounds. They lost to the Bulldogs who wore an original Footscray guernsey with Red shorts. As Essendon and Richmond were both still wearing guernseys with no major change from what was worn in the 70s, Essendon once again wore Red shorts and Richmond wore Yellow shorts in both of their games. Two Teams that did not wear a heritage guernsey were St. Kilda, who instead wore their White clash guernsey, and Collingwood. Other teams to not wear a heritage guernsey due to extreme similarities to current day versions included Geelong, Carlton (who's \\"CFC\\" insignia was the current version and not of the one worn from 1933 to 1997), and North Melbourne. Fremantle had to wear an original East Fremantle guernsey as one of the past guernseys clashed with the old South Melbourne/Sydney jumper, as they were playing the Sydney Swans that round; resulting in the teams taking the field in uniforms almost identical to those of the 1979 WAFL Grand Final- the Fremantle Derby Grand Final between East Fremantle and South Fremantle. 2008 – 150 years of Australian Rules Football The only heritage round was Tom Wills round but only Melbourne and Geelong wore a heritage guernsey. Hawthorn played Brisbane in Tasmania, Brisbane wore their Fitzroy inspired strip as an away guernsey in Victoria. Richmond celebrated their 100th year of league football by wearing a striped guernsey from their early years. 2009 – No Heritage Round No heritage round took place in 2009 but The Brisbane Lions continued to wear their Fitzroy Lions away guernsey. The Sydney Swans chose to wear their guernsey from their first premiership to celebrate 100 year since winning it in 1909 against the Carlton Blues in Round 16 at Etihad Stadium.

Did Not Wear A Heritage Guernsey Criticism  Port Adelaide VS Collingwood  An ongoing battle between both the Port Adelaide and Collingwood football clubs is over Port Adelaide wearing the colours Black and White. Port Adelaide was established in the SANFL and, like Collingwood, were known as the Magpies and wore Black and White. As Port Adelaide won a licence to enter the AFL in 1996 they had to agree not to overshadow the branding of the Collingwood football club by using the name \\"Magpies\\" and using only the colours Black and White. An agreement was finally reached between the two clubs which lets Port Adelaide wear the \\"Prison Bar\\" in 2007 as a one off, and for Port Adelaide to be able to wear the \\"Prison Bar\\" in future Heritage Rounds at AAMI Stadium so long as it is not against Collingwood.

The two 12-story south wings of the hotel were built in 1904, and the double-width north wing was completed in 1913, initially as apartments for permanent guests. This section is referred to as the Landmark Building on the hotel's website. The 32-story, tower, referred to as the Tower Building, to the rear completed in 1972 features exterior glass elevators that offer panoramic views of the bay and the square below, making the St. Francis one of the largest hotels in the city, with more than 1,254 rooms and suites.  History  The St. Francis Hotel soon after its opening in 1904 The St. Francis Hotel was begun by the trustees of the estate of Charles Crocker, one of \\"The Big Four\\" railroad magnates who had built the western portion of the transcontinental railway. It was built as an investment for Crocker's two young grandchildren, Templeton Crocker and Jenny Crocker. It was originally meant to be called The Crocker Hotel, but instead it took the name of one of the earliest San Francisco Gold Rush hotels, the St. Francis. It was designed by Bliss and Faville in the style of Chicago architect Louis Sullivan in Chicago, with a relatively bare facade for San Francisco. The hotel opened on March 21, 1904, and, along with the older Palace Hotel on Market Street, immediately became one of the city's most prestigious addresses.  1906 earthquake  Damage to the dining room from the 1906 fire subsequent to the great earthquake The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 badly frightened the guests, but did no structural damage to the hotel. John Farish, a mining engineer staying at the hotel, described the experience: \\"I was awakened by a loud rumbling noise which could be compared to the mixed sound of a strong wind rushing through a forest and the breaking of waves against a cliff...there began a series of the liveliest motions imagineable, accompanied by a creaking, grinding, rasping sound, followed by tremendous crashes as the cornices of adjoining buildings and chimneys tottered to the ground.\\" Enrico Caruso The earthquake lasted 55 seconds. A hotel page described the pandemonium inside the hotel: \\"I found the floor crowded with screaming guests running every which way. As the elevators were all out of order the guests headed for the marble stairs, which were broken and cracked and falling below.\\" The hotel manager, James Woods, wearing his bathrobe, tried to calm the guests, but most of them rushed outside onto Union Square. Later in the morning, opera singer Enrico Caruso and Alfred Hertz, the conductor of the San Francisco Symphony, who was hosting a tour by Caruso, who were both staying at the nearby Palace Hotel, fled the Palace and came to the St. Francis, where the restaurant was still open for breakfast. Caruso carried with him a signed photograph of President Theodore Roosevelt, and swore he would never return to San Francisco; he never did, having died in 1921. The earthquake did not cause major structural damage to the hotel, but it did begin a series of fires along the waterfront which began to sweep west across the city. It also broke the water mains, so firemen were unable to fight the fires. An hour after midnight the fire reached Union Square and gutted the hotel. When the fire was finally extinguished after three days, it was found that the St. Francis had suffered little serious damage. The copper cornice had warped, and some of the enamelled facing bricks had fallen off in the heat, but otherwise the building was intact. Reconstruction began almost immediately. A small temporary hotel, the little St. Francis, with 110 rooms, was built in the middle of Union Square, to house temporary guests. The hotel re-opened in late 1907.  Through the Jazz Age  Woodrow Wilson in 1919 After its re-opening, the St. Francis hosted dozens of celebrities who came to San Francisco for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition (PPIE) of 1915, ranging from Helen Keller, three-time Presidential candidate and orator William Jennings Bryan, who came to San Francisco to speak against American involvement in the First World War, and former baseball player and evangelist Billy Sunday, who came to San Francisco to denounce sin and the theory of evolution. The exterior of the hotel appeared in the Keystone Studios newsreel/documentary two-reeler, Mabel and Fatty Viewing the World's Fair at San Francisco, which followed the studio's biggest stars, Mabel Normand and Roscoe Arbuckle, as they toured the city and the PPIE. Former President Theodore Roosevelt stayed at the hotel in July 1915, (about midway through the nine-month-long PPIE) and used the occasion to denounce his bitter enemy, President Woodrow Wilson, and to call for American entry into World War I. In September 1919, President Woodrow Wilson stayed at the St. Francis as he toured the country as part of his unsuccessful effort to win support for American entry into the League of Nations. The 1920 Democratic National Convention was held in San Francisco, and several presidential candidates stayed at the St. Francis, including another visit from William Jennings Bryan. Mabel Normand During the 1920s, the St. Francis became the fashionable place to stay for celebrities and film actors coming from Hollywood. St. Francis guests included silent film stars Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, cowboy star Tom Mix, Mabel Normand, Fatty Arbuckle, and directors D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille.Other guests included novelist Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, circus impresarios the Ringling Brothers, dancer Isadora Duncan, songwriter George M. Cohan, and Duke Kahanamoku, the champion swimmer of the world, who popularized the sport of surfing. One of the appeals of the St. Francis was its jazz orchestra, led by a young musician named Art Hickman. His band, which in 1914 included Bert Kelly, played in the Rose Room of the hotel, before going on to greater fame at the New York Biltmore Hotel and the roof garden of the New Amsterdam Theatre. During his time at the St. Francis, he helped popularize such musicians as Paul Whiteman and Ferde Grofe who, after leaving the St. Francis orchestra, went on to compose the Grand Canyon Suite. Part of the fame of the St. Francis was because of its legendary chef, Victor Hirtzler. Hirtzler learned to cook in Strasbourg, France, and then cooked for royal courts across Europe. According to Hirtzler, he had created a dish for King Carlos I of Portugal, called La Mousse Faisan Lucullus, a mousse of Bavarian pheasant's breast and woodcock flavored with truffles, with a sauce of cognac, Madeira and champagne. The dish was so expensive, and the King ate it so frequently, that he bankrupted Portugal twice and was assassinated in 1908, followed by the downfall of Portuguese monarchy in 1910. Victor moved to New York, became the Chef of the Waldorf Hotel, and then was persuaded by the manager of the St. Francis, James Woods, to move to San Francisco. Charles Evans Hughes In 1916, Hirtzler again cooked a dish which had political consequences. The Crocker family were fervent Republicans, and they hosted a dinner at the hotel for Charles Evans Hughes, the Republican candidate for President of the United States, who was locked in a close race with incumbent Woodrow Wilson. Twenty minutes before the banquet began, the waiters, who were members of the culinary workers union, went on strike. Hughes wondered if the banquet should be canceled, but Hirtzler insisted upon it going ahead, and served the meal himself. When the Union learned that Hughes had crossed a picket line and eaten the dinner, they distributed thousands of leaflets denouncing him as anti-union. On election night, Hughes went to bed believing he had won the election. The next morning he awoke and learned that he had lost California by only 3,673 votes, and by losing California had lost the election to Wilson. The margin of his defeat was less than the turnout of union voters in San Francisco. By saving the dinner, Hirtzler had lost the election for Hughes.  Fatty Arbuckle scandal  Pictures, July 23, 1921, Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle on the cover In 1921, the St. Francis was the scene of Hollywood's first great scandal. The silent film comedian Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle, whose fame at the time rivaled that of Charlie Chaplin, and a number of friends were guests in rooms 1219, 1220 and 1221. On September 5, 1921, they had a party in their suite, with friends and acquaintances from Hollywood. One guest was a young actress from Hollywood named Virginia Rappe. In mid-afternoon Arbuckle summoned a house doctor and reported that Rappe was sick, and the young woman was taken to another room and put to bed. Arbuckle himself went to a personal appearance at a movie theater, and returned to Hollywood the next day. A few days later Arbuckle learned that Virginia Rappe had been taken to the hospital and had died, and that a friend of the young woman, Maude Delmont, who had been at the party, claimed to police that Arbuckle had assaulted and raped her. (Delmont's testimony was later regarded as unreliable by the police, when it was discovered Delmont had a lengthy prior record of extortion. She was not called as a witness.) The story was soon in the headlines of newspapers around the United States. Arbuckle was tried for manslaughter in November 1921 in a highly publicized trial. In December, after over 40 hours of deliberations, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Arbuckle's second trial in January–February 1922 the following year also ended in a hung jury, but in his third trial in March–April 1922, the jury found him not guilty after only five minutes of deliberations. Arbuckle was free, but his career was ruined. His films were withdrawn by Will H. Hays, the President of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, and what became known as the Hays Office began the systematic censorship of American motion pictures.  1930s and World War II  The 1939 World's Fair on Treasure Island, in San Francisco Bay, attracted many celebrities to San Francisco and to the St. Francis. Salvador Dalí posed for newspaper photographers in the bathtub of his hotel room, with a lobster on his head, holding a cabbage in one hand, and wearing a pair of emerald-green goggles, and Cary Grant stayed in the hotel, entertaining friends with scenes from Noël Coward's play Private Lives. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, San Francisco became a major transit point for soldiers and sailors going to the Pacific Theater of the War. The shops in the lobby of the St. Francis were turned into small rooms for military officers. Hundreds of soldiers, sailors and officers danced in the Mural Room of the St. Francis to the big band music of Harry Owens and the Royal Hawaiians, and his vocalist, Hilo Hattie. In April 1945, the St. Francis played host to twenty- seven delegations attending the founding meeting of the United Nations, held in the San Francisco Opera House. The St. Francis was host to the delegations from Iran, Canada, Turkey, Egypt and France, represented by French foreign minister Georges Bidault, who stayed in the same suite where the Fatty Arbuckle scandal had taken place. The St. Francis also hosted several Latin American delegations, along with the U.S. Under Secretary of State for the Americas, Nelson Rockefeller. The Soviet delegation, led by Soviet foreign minister V.M. Molotov, and the Soviet ambassador to the United States, Andrei Gromyko, also stayed at the St. Francis.  1950s to the present  In April 1951, the St. Francis hosted General Douglas MacArthur, who received a tumultuous welcome when he returned from Korea after having been dismissed from command by President Harry Truman. Entertainer Al Jolson died while playing cards in his suite at the St. Francis on October 23, 1950—Jolson had just returned from entertaining the troops in Korea. President Gerald Ford, Secret Service personnel and bystanders pictured outside the St. Francis immediately after an assassination attempt by Sara Jane Moore. The St. Francis was still owned by the Crocker family until the end of World War II, when the Crocker family sold it to hotel magnate Ben Swig, who then sold it to Edwin B. DeGolia. In 1954, the hotel became the twenty-third property in the Seattle- based Western Hotels chain, which eventually became Western International. With its acquisition by Western Hotels, the hotel was changed from a home of elderly San Francisco socialites, some of whom lived in large suites, to a modern hotel focusing on tourism and especially conventions. The old Mural Room, decorated by Albert Herter in 1913 with seven murals comprising The Pageant of Nations, a banquet and ballroom which had hosted many of America's famous big bands, was replaced in 1970 by a six hundred room tower, designed to help the St. Francis compete with The Fairmont, its rival on nearby Nob Hill. Architect William Pereira designed the new building, which was completed in 1972. The murals were rolled up and removed to storage. The St. Francis became the hotel where Republican presidents stayed when in San Francisco, while Democratic presidents usually stayed at the Fairmont. President Gerald Ford was almost shot while leaving the hotel on September 22, 1975 by a woman named Sara Jane Moore. A former Marine, Oliver Sipple, moved her hand so that Ford was not hit. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were guests of the hotel. The St. Francis also hosted many world leaders, including Queen Elizabeth II and Emperor Hirohito of Japan. When Western International became Westin Hotels in 1981, the hotel was also renamed, becoming The Westin St. Francis. In March 2016, Anbang Insurance Group, a Beijing-based Chinese insurance company, purchased the property as part of a $6.5 billion deal involving the St. Francis and 15 other luxury hotels and resorts. In April 2018, the hotel completed a four-year renovation of its landmark building at a cost of $45 million. Work included redecorating guest rooms and corridors, enlarging some bathrooms to include walk-in showers and upgrades to elevator systems. Labor relations Beginning in November 2009 Unite Here Local 2, representing San Francisco hotel workers, asked the public to boycott the Westin St. Francis Hotel because the hotel's owner, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide had not renewed a previously settled contract with workers with respect to wages, benefits, and working conditions. The hotel was one of eight in San Francisco boycotted, and was scene to many protests including picketing. and even a flash mob. In April 2011, the union reached an agreement with Starwood Hotels. The hotel today The hotel seen at night in September 2016 The hotel is distinctive for a historic lobby master clock, the first in the Western United States, and celebrity chef Michael Mina's Bourbon Steakhouse restaurant, which replaced his self-named restaurant and was formerly the Compass Rose and before that the Patent Leather Bar, designed by Timothy L. Pflueger. The hotel displays a small collection of photographic prints produced by Ansel Adams to advertise the former Patent Leather Bar, and keeps some old traditions such as an official hotel historian and the industry's only remaining coin cleaning service for guests. A collection of hotel memorabilia is on display in the lobby, arranged by decade and featuring items such as vintage keys, dining ware, room service bills, photographs, and media articles.

It occurs in coastal and lowland forest throughout the North Island, on the west coast of the South Island and on the Three Kings Islands north of Cape Reinga. It is one of a number of New Zealand Metrosideros species which live out their lives as vines, unlike the northern rata (M.robusta), which generally begins as a hemi-epiphyte and grows into a huge tree. Scarlet rātā is one of the better-known species of rātā vines, because it flowers in autumn or winter, and is often highly visible on well-lit host trees along forest roads, with vibrant displays of large red flowers (sometimes orange or yellow) that rise above the forest canopy. Description Unfolding stamens of the flower of M. fulgens'Metrosideros fulgens prefers warm moist habitats and grows up to 10m long or more, with the main stem up to 10 cm. or more in diameter. It climbs in the same way as ivy, sending out short adventitious roots to adhere to the trunks of host trees, penetrating and clinging to rough surfaces. The climbing shoots of juvenile plants are designed to grow rapidly and extend the length of the plant. The short clinging roots usually die after about a year, so that when the vine is mature, the thick, twisted, rope-like stems hang free from the host like thick, sometimes twisted ropes, with red-brown flaky bark. The leaves are mostly rounded at the tip. Flowering is from autumn to spring, with seed capsules taking about a year to ripen. Cultivation M. fulgens 'Aurata' in bloom There are several cultivars of M. fulgens available, mostly selected for their flower colours. * Metrosideros fulgens ‘Gold’/'Aurata' has bright yellow flowers from late summer to early winter and grows to 1.5 by 1.5 metres, taking several years to reach this size. It has attractive fresh light green foliage, and can be trimmed to form an informal hedge. M. Aurata was first encountered in 1890 near Collingwood by a Mrs S. Featon of Gisborne, and was first thought to be a separate species (Metrosideros aurata). M. Gold was the name used when introduced into cultivation, and was sourced in the same area and time as M. Jaffa below. * Metrosideros fulgens 'Jaffa' is a compact bush producing brilliant burnt-orange flowers. This cultivar was selected in the mid-1990s from a specimen growing on the Tairua-Whitianga Road in the Coromandel Peninsula by Jenny Oliphant. It has been available since 2001. * Metrosideros fulgens 'Orange Princess' was released in 2000 by Duncan & Davies in Taranaki. This cultivar was sourced from the Onaero River valley. Its appearance is very similar to M. Jaffa. * Metrosideros fulgens 'Red Glow' is a more \\"standard\\" form of M. fulgens and has orangy-red flowers. The source of this cultivar is not known but has only been available for a few years. In addition to the above cultivars, it is also possible to by regular forms of M. fulgens through specialist plant nurseries.

Dedicated in name of Marion L. Brittain, it serves as the primary dining location for all Freshman Experience and Area II housing residents. It is located between Techwood Drive and Williams Street, facing Bobby Dodd Stadium to its west. History While it was partially funded by the state of Georgia, a large part of the funding for Brittain Dining Hall came from the Athletic Association and the Georgia Tech Expansion Fund. Opened in 1928, it was a joint effort of many of Tech's departments: The building cost $418,000 to construct and was designed by the architects Bush-Brown & Gailey. Brittain Dining Hall was renovated in 1964, 1999, 2002, and again in summer 2007. During the 2007 heatwave, Brittain Dining Hall went trayless to conserve water due to Atlanta, Georgia's severe water shortage. Architecture Brittain Dining Hall, with AT&T; Midtown Center and Bank of America Plaza in background Brittain is based around two large wings that serve as dining areas. Patrons enter from the western entrance and serve themselves via the buffet. In between the two wings there is a staircase that leads up to a lobby, which overlooks the two wings and leads to the President's Dining Room. The President's Dining Room looks out on to the western lawn of Brittain, and was originally designed for serving the Institute's president and visiting dignitaries but was eventually converted to a dining area. In recent years however, there has once more been a restriction on the use of this second floor dining area because of the tendency of the Institute's students to put new meaning to \\"food on the fly\\". The southern wing is highlighted by a large stained glass window designed by Julian Harris. The window was dedicated to Georgia Tech graduating classes of 1928-1932. The entrance is marked by a Georgia School of Technology floor seal showing the age of Brittain Hall. The back of Brittain dubbed \\"Brittain Rec\\" serves as the laundromat and meeting place for the Freshman Experience Program. Brittain Rec is divided into a Buzz Card activated laundry room, BuzzBy, East Side Market, and a ballroom for events.

Public reception While Brittain Dining Hall caters to the nutritional needs of thousands of students weekly, it is largely regarded as the most inferior eatery on campus. Despite the generally cordial staff, an overwhelming lack of variety contributes to this perception. Students will often seek dining alternatives such as Buzzby, the Student Center food court, and various other dining locations on and off campus.

This church numbers roughly 150,000 faithful in 31 congregations and is the largest Orthodox Church in Estonia. The primate of the church was Cornelius (Jakobs), Metropolitan of Tallinn and All Estonia, from 1992 to his death in 2018. Under Estonian law, the \\"Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church\\" (Eesti Apostlik-Õigeusu Kirik) is the legal successor to the pre-World War II Estonian Orthodox Church, which in 1940 had had over 210,000 faithful, three bishops, 156 parishes, 131 priests, 19 deacons, two monasteries, and a theological seminary, the majority of the faithful were ethnic Estonians. Its primate is confirmed by the Orthodox Church of Constantinople. The head of this church is Metropolitan Eugene (Reshetnikov) who has been Metropolitan of Tallinn and All Estonia since 2018. This church numbers about 20,000 faithful in 60 congregations today. The reactivation of the autonomous Estonian Orthodox Church caused the Russian Orthodox Church to severe full communion with the Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1996 for several months. History Orthodox missionaries from Novgorod and Pskov were active among the Estonians in the southeast regions of the area, closest to Pskov, in the 10th through 12th centuries. As a result of the Northern Crusades in the beginning of the 13th century, Estonia fell under the control of Western Christianity. However, Russian merchants were later able to set up small Orthodox congregations in several Estonian towns. One such congregation was expelled from the town of Dorpat (Tartu) by the Germans in 1472, who martyred their priest, Isidor, along with a number of Orthodox faithful (the group is commemorated on January 8).Little is known about the history of the church in the area until the 17th and 18th centuries, when many Old Believers fled there from Russia to avoid the liturgical reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon of Moscow. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonia was a part of the Imperial Russian Empire, having been conquered by the emperor Peter the Great. A significant number of Estonian peasants were converted to the Orthodox faith in the (unfulfilled) hope of obtaining land, and numerous Orthodox churches were built. In 1850 the Diocese of Riga (in Latvia) was established by the Russian Orthodox Church and many Estonian Orthodox believers were included. In the late 19th century, a wave of Russification was introduced, supported by the Russian hierarchy but not by the local Estonian clergy. The Cathedral of St. Alexander Nevsky in Tallinn and the Pühtitsa Convent (Pukhtitsa) in Kuremäe in East Estonia were also built around this time. In 1917 the first Estonian, Platon (Paul Kulbusch), was ordained Bishop of Riga and Vicar of Tallinn. After the Estonian Republic was proclaimed in 1918, the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, St. Tikhon, in 1920 recognised the Orthodox Church of Estonia (OCE) as being independent. Archbishop Aleksander Paulus was elected and ordained as the head of the Estonian church. Soon after, the Estonian church lost contact with Moscow due to the intense religious persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church by the new Leninist regime. In September 1922 the Council of the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church took the decision to address the Patriarch of Constantinople, Meletius IV (Metaxakis) of Constantinople, with a petition to adopt the Estonian Orthodox Church under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople and to declare it autocephalous. Later on the Metropolitan of Tallinn and all Estonia Alexander wrote that it was done under an intense pressure of the state. On 7 July 1923 in Constantinople Meletios Metaxakis presented the Tomos on the adoption of Estonian Orthodox Church under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople as a separate church autonomy \\"Estonian Orthodox Metropolia\\". At the suggestion of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, Estonia was divided into three dioceses, Tallinn, Narva and Pechery. Evsevy (Drozdov) became the head of Narva cathedra. John (Bulin), a graduate of St. Petersburg Theological Academy, became Bishop of Pechery in 1926. He headed the diocese until 1932 and left it because of the disagreements on the properties of the Pskov-Pechery Monastery. Bishop John spent several years in Yugoslavia and came back to Estonia in the late 1930s. He actively backed the return of the Estonian Orthodox Church to the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate. On 18 October 1940, Bishop John was arrested by the NKVD in Pechery, accused of anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda, and was executed on 30 July 1941 in Leningrad. Before 1941, one fifth of the total Estonian population (who had been mostly Lutheran since the Reformation in the early 16th century when the country was controlled by the Teutonic Order) were Orthodox Christians under the Patriarchy of Constantinople. There were 158 parishes in Estonia and 183 clerics in the Estonian church. There was also a Chair of Orthodoxy in the Faculty of Theology at the University of Tartu. There was a Pskovo-Pechorsky Monastery in Petseri, two convents--in Narva and Kuremäe, a priory in Tallinn and a seminary in Petseri. The ancient monastery in Petseri was preserved from the mass church destruction that occurred in Soviet Russia. Occupation In 1940, Estonia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, whose government undertook a general programme of the dissolution of all ecclesiastical independence within its territory. From 1942 to 1944, however, autonomy under Constantinople was temporarily revived. In 1945, a representative of the Moscow Patriarchate dismissed the members of the OCE synod who had remained in Estonia and established a new organisation, the Diocesan Council. Orthodox believers in the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic were thus subordinated to being a diocese within the Russian Orthodox Church. Soon after Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union, Metropolitan Alexander declared his break-up with Moscow and reunion with the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Bishop Paul of Narva remained loyal to the Moscow Patriarchate. During their occupation, the Germans didn't hamper Metropolitan Alexander to lead the life of his parishes and Bishop Paul to be in charge of the Russian diocese in Narva and many other parishes loyal to Russian Orthodox Church. Not long before the Soviet Army entered Tallinn, Metropolitan Alexander left Estonia, the Synod of Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church addressed Alexy (Simansky), Metropolitan of Leningrad and Novgorod, with a petition to resume the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate. Just before the Soviet occupation in 1944 and the dissolution of the Estonian synod, the primate of the church, Metropolitan Aleksander, went into exile along with 21 clergymen and about 8,000 Orthodox believers. The Orthodox Church of Estonia in Exile with its synod in Sweden continued its activity according to the canonical statutes, until the restoration of Estonian independence in 1991. Before he died in 1953, Metr. Aleksander established his community as an exarchate under Constantinople. Most of the other bishops and clergy who remained behind were exiled to Siberia. In 1958, a new synod was established in exile, and the church was organized from Sweden. Estonian independence Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, divisions within the Orthodox community in Estonia arose between those who wished to remain under Russian authority and those who wished to return to the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, with the dispute often taking place along ethnic lines, many Russians having immigrated to Estonia during the Soviet occupation. Lengthy negotiations between the two patriarchates failed to produce any agreement. In 1993, the synod of the Orthodox Church of Estonia in Exile was re-registered as the autonomous Orthodox Church of Estonia, and on February 20, 1996, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I renewed the tomos granted to the OCE in 1923, restoring its canonical subordination to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. This action brought immediate protest from the Estonian-born Patriarch Alexei II of the Moscow Patriarchate, which regarded his native Estonia as part of his canonical territory and the Patriarch of Moscow removed the name of the Ecumenical Patriarch from the diptychs in 1996 for several months (see 1996 Moscow–Constantinople schism). An agreement was reached in which local congregations could choose which jurisdiction to follow. The Orthodox community in Estonia, which accounts for about 14% of the total population, remains divided, with the majority of faithful (mostly ethnic Russians) remaining under Moscow. A U.S. Department of State report from November 2003, about 20,000 believers (mostly ethnic Estonians) in 60 parishes are part of the autonomous church, with 150,000 faithful in 31 parishes, along with the monastic community of Pühtitsa, paying traditional allegiance to Moscow.International Religious Freedom Report 2003 On 6 November 2000 Archbishop Cornelius became Metropolitan of Tallinn and All Estonia. On 19 April 2018 Metropolitan Cornelius reposed. In 2018 Archbishop Eugene (Reshetnikov), was elected Metropolitan of Tallinn and All Estonia. He began his role as the Primate of the Estonian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate on June 17, 2018.

The Ugresha Monastery was one of the walled abbeys defending approaches to the Russian capital from the south.

Page 134. A bird's-eye view of St. Nicholas' Monastery The monastery was greatly expanded in the 17th century due to its proximity to the royal residences in Izmailovo and Kolomenskoye. Tsar Alexis made a habit of visiting the monastery several times a year. After the Great Moscow Synod the sanctuary was visited by the Patriarchs of Moscow, Alexandria, and Antioch. Metropolitan Macarius II spent the latter years of his life in the monastery, and Archpriest Avvakum was imprisoned there. The great katholikon (main church) of the monastery was built to a Russian- Byzantine design by Alexander Kaminsky between 1880 and 1894. It is one of the largest churches in the Moscow region and has a set of new frescoes dating from 2009. After the Russian Revolution, the monastery was closed and its grounds were given over to a children's colony of the People's Commissariat of Finance in 1920. In an effort to fight children homelessness, Felix Dzerzhinsky had it transformed into a labour commune. The town was later renamed after Dzerzhinsky. Many church buildings were destroyed; others survived in a state of great disrepair. The ruined buildings were returned to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1991.

GROW was founded in Sydney, Australia in 1957 by Father Cornelius B. \\"Con\\" Keogh, a Roman Catholic priest, and psychiatric patients who sought help with their mental illness in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Consequently, GROW adapted many of AA's principles and practices. As the organization matured, GROW members learned of Recovery International, an organization also created to help people with serious mental illness, and integrated pieces of its will-training methods. As of 2005 there were more than 800 GROW groups active worldwide. GROW groups are open to anyone who would like to join, though they specifically seek out those who have a history of psychiatric hospitalization or are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Despite the capitalization, GROW is not an acronym. Much of GROW's initial development was made possible with support from Orval Hobart Mowrer, Reuben F. Scarf, W. Clement Stone and Lions Clubs International.  Processes  GROW's literature includes the Twelve Stages of Decline, which indicate that emotional illness begins with self-centeredness, and the Twelve Steps of Personal Growth, a blend of AA's Twelve Steps and will-training methods from Recovery International. GROW members view recovery as an ongoing life process rather than an outcome and are expected to continue following the Steps after completing them in order to maintain their mental health. The Twelve Stages of Decline # We gave too much importance to ourselves and our feelings. # We grew inattentive to God's presence and providence and God's natural order in our lives. # We let competitive motives, in our dealings with others, prevail over our common personal welfare. # We expressed our suppressed certain feelings against the better judgment of conscience or sound advice. # We began thinking in isolation from others, following feelings and imagination instead of reason. # We neglected the care and control of our bodies. # We avoided recognizing our personal decline and shrank from the task of changing. # We systematically disguised in our imaginations the real nature of our unhealthy conduct. # We became a prey to obsessions, delusions and hallucinations. # We practised irrational habits, under elated feelings of irresponsibility or despairing feelings of inability or compulsion. # We rejected advice and refused to co-operate with help. # We lost all insight into our condition. The Twelve Steps of Recovery and Personal Growth # We admitted we were inadequate or maladjusted to life. # We firmly resolved to get well and co-operated with the help that we needed. # We surrendered to the healing power of a wise and loving God. # We made a personal inventory and accepted ourselves. # We made a moral inventory and cleaned out our hearts. # We endured until cured. # We took care and control of our bodies. # We learned to think by reason rather than by feelings and imagination. # We trained our wills to govern our feelings. # We took our responsible and caring place in society. # We grew daily closer to maturity. # We carried GROW's hopeful, healing, and transforming message to others in need. GROW suggests atheists and agnostics use \\"We became inattentive to objective natural order in our lives\\" and \\"We trusted in a health-giving power in our lives as a whole\\" for the Second Stage of Decline and Third Step of Personal Growth, respectively.  Results of qualitative analysis  Statistical evaluations of interviews with GROW members found they identified self-reliance, industriousness, peer support, and gaining a sense of personal value or self-esteem as the essential ingredients of recovery. Similar evaluations of GROW's literature revealed thirteen core principles of GROW's program. They are reproduced in the list below by order of relevance, with a quote from GROW's literature, explaining the principle. # Be Reasonable: \\"We learned to think by reason rather than by feelings and imagination.\\" # Decentralize, participate in community: \\"...decentralization from self and participation in a community of persons is the very process of recovery or personal growth.\\" # Surrender to the Healing Power of a wise and loving God: \\"God, who made me and everything connected with me, can overcome any and every evil that affects my life.\\" # Grow Closer to Maturity: \\"Maturity is a coming to terms with oneself, with others, and with life as a whole.\\" # Activate One's Self to Recover and Grow \\"Take your fingers off your pulse and start living.\\" # Become Hopeful: \\"I can, and ultimately will, become completely well; God who made me can restore me and enable me to do my part. The best in life and love and happiness is ahead of me.\\" # Settle for Disorder: \\"Settle for disorder in lesser things for the sake of order in greater things; and therefore be content to be discontent in many things.\\" 8. Be Ordinary: \\"I can do whatever ordinary good people do, and avoid whatever ordinary good people avoid. My special abilities will develop in harmony only if my foremost aim is to be a good ordinary human being.\\" 9. Help Others: We carried the GROW message to others in need. 10. Accept One's Personal Value: \\"No matter how bad my physical, mental, social or spiritual condition I am always a human person, loved by God and a connecting link between persons; I am still valuable, my life has a purpose, and I have my unique place and my unique part in my Creator's own saving, healing and transforming work.\\" 11. Use GROW: \\"Use the hopeful and cheerful language of GROW.\\" 12. Gain Insight: \\"We made moral inventory and cleaned out our hearts.\\" 13. Accept Help: \\"We firmly resolved to get well and co-operated with the help that we needed.\\"  Effectiveness  Participation in GROW has been shown to decrease the number of hospitalizations per member as well as the duration of hospitalizations when they occur. Members report an increased sense of security and self-esteem, and decreased anxiety. cited in A longitudinal study of GROW membership found time involved in the program correlated with increased autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, self-acceptance and social skills. Women in particular experience positive identity transformation, build friendships and find a sense of community in GROW groups.  Literature  The Program of Growth to Maturity, generally referred to as the 'Blue Book', is the principal literature used in GROW groups. The book is divided into three sections based on the developmental stages of members: 'Beginning Growers', 'Progressing Growers' and 'Seasoned Growers'. Additionally, there are three related books written by Cornelius B. Keogh, and one by Anne Waters, used in conjunction with the Blue Book.   *  See also  * Emotions Anonymous * Neurotics Anonymous * Recovery International (formerly Recovery, Inc.) * Self-help groups for mental health  References   External links  * GROW in America * GROW in Australia * GROW in Ireland * GROW in New Zealand  Category:Mental health support groups Category:Mental health organisations in Australia Category:Spiritual organizations Category:Medical and health organisations based in New South Wales Category:Organizations established in 1957 Category:Twelve-step programs ","title":"GROW"},{"id":"11692357","text":"The chestnut-backed thrush (Geokichla dohertyi) is a ground thrush species endemic to Lombok, Timor and the Lesser Sunda Islands in Indonesia.

The game uses Origin's RealSpace engine, which was first used in their earlier flight simulator Strike Commander. Gameplay The player begins the game as an American novice newly arrived in England who must take part in numerous missions, which involve taking off, completing certain objectives, then returning to base. The various planes that can be piloted are realistic for the time period; the starting plane is a lowly Sopwith Pup, with more advanced planes becoming available as the game progresses. Each plane has its own machine gun and some are able to drop bombs. The gameplay is primarily in first-person with an option to switch to third-person. In addition to the main campaign there is a Gauntlet mode where the objective is to survive for as long as possible against a constant wave of enemies. There is also a level designer where the player can create their own missions. Reception PC Gamer gave it a score of 92%,http://www.cdaccess.com/html/pc/wingsofg.htm saying, \\"Wings of Glory isn't just the most realistic-feeling World War I flight sim on the market, it's also a carefully crafted homage to the great aerial epics of the '20s and '30s\\" and \\"Quibbles aside, Origin has given us another superb product in Wings of Glory\\".

Directed by Julian Gibbs, it stars Juliet Stevenson as Gerda's mother and the voice of Patrick Stewart as the raven. This film was originally conceived as a vehicle for music composed by Paul K. Joyce. A set of operatic songs had been written by Paul K. Joyce for a concert at the Barbican Arts Centre held in 2003. The songs narrated the fairytale of The Snow Queen and featured Sydney Rae White as the lead girl soprano, Juliet Stevenson as the narrator and the London Symphony Orchestra providing instrumentals. Due to the success of the concert, a full-fledged film was developed around the original songs, and in which Sydney White and Juliet Stevenson returned to contribute as actresses. The songs written by Paul K. Joyce are central to the film, providing main narration throughout the story. Actual dialogue is sparse, and most notable is that the Snow Queen herself has no lines. The story also focuses entirely on Gerda's journey, with all others, including Kay himself, acting as supporting characters. However, the character of the Raven (voiced by Patrick Stewart) was given more prominence as he follows Gerda throughout her entire journey. Plot One night in winter, a young girl named Gerda sees a young boy on the side of the street shivering in the cold. Gerda gives him a penny and one of her blankets, and Gerda's mother eventually takes the boy in, feeding and clothing him. The boy, whose name is Kay, strikes up a warm friendship with Gerda. One night, Gerda's mother tells the pair the story of the Snow Queen, who rules winter. Kay has seen her and has fallen in love with her, so when she returns, he looks out the window but something falls into his eye, and from that moment on his heart is cold and he is cruel towards Gerda. Although Gerda is confused over Kay's sudden change of personality, she continues to try to mend their friendship. One day, Kay goes sledding in the woods when he sees the Snow Queen. He hitches the rope of Gerda's sled to the Queen's sleigh and travels off with her. He does not return and when the sled is discovered in the river, he is presumed dead. When Gerda mourns him by the river, she is visited by a talking raven who tells her that Kay is not in the river. Gerda decides to find Kay, travelling a far distance and meeting many characters. First she meets talking flowers and a rose tells her that Kay is in a palace. Next she befriends a King, a princess and a prince in a golden palace. The King tells her \\"the legend of the looking glass\\". It is said that a wicked magician, thought to be the Devil himself, once made a mirror that would distort the image of anyone who looked into it. When it broke, the fragments flew into the air causing more trouble. The King suspects that it is a shard of that mirror that fell into Kay's eye. The King, the princess and the prince let Gerda wear a silk gown and the princess's fur cape for her journey and send her off in a golden carriage to the forest after saying their goodbyes and promising they will meet again. The raven goes along with her. However, the carriage is ambushed by robbers and just as one of them is about to kill Gerda for her clothes, a robber girl saves her with a spear. After an argument, Gerda realises the robber girl is all alone and promises she'll come back for her with Kay and be friends. The robber girl gives her a reindeer who knows the way and they make it to the North. Gerda is exhausted and falls asleep in a blizzard, but an old Finland woman rescues her and her animals. She does not know the entire way to the Snow Queen but she gives them a way to the Laplander's home. Gerda, the raven and the reindeer manage to beat many dangerous obstacles and make it safely to the land of the Midnight Sun where the Laplander gives them a potion which flies them through the Northern Lights. But before they do, she warns them that the Snow Queen might freeze them to death. They finally arrive at the Snow Queen's palace, but are charged at by her giant Polar Bears. Luckily, they shatter into pieces when the reindeer hits them with his antlers. Gerda decides to go on alone and finds Kay unconscious on a table of ice. The Snow Queen confronts Gerda, intent on destroying her, but Gerda remembers that the King said her strong and pure sisterly love for Kay would give her the strength and bravery to defeat the Winter Witch, and the Snow Queen explodes into snow and purple light. Gerda wakes Kay with her warm tears, and Kay cries the shard of mirror out of his eye. The pair escape as the palace collapses around them, and the Snow Queen's spirit shoots into a cloud. They make it back to their town and are reunited with Gerda's mother. And the raven is seen flying away and the reindeer living in the North. Suddenly, a fragment of the evil mirror floats past the planet.

Known species of virus are: * Canna yellow mottle badnavirus (CYMV) infecting canna species. * Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) infecting cannas, gladiolus, freesia and many legumes. * Tomato aspermy virus (TAV), causes mosaic in cannas, but it has not been reported affecting cannas in the UK. * Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), cannas are susceptible to this virus, but none found yet in England. * Canna yellow streak virus (CaYSV), recently discovered by scientists at the Central Science Laboratory in England. Dr Rick Mumford, senior virologist at CSL is quoted as stating \\"Typical virus symptoms include flecking, mosaic, leaf streaking and necrosis, which in severe cases render plants unsaleable.\\" The reference to this quoted article is shown below. Known facts Overall, very little is known about the Canna viruses, but the following points are generally accepted: * It manifests itself in rust coloured streaks or mottled markings on the leaves and in colour breaks on the flowers. * Sometimes leaves are slightly distorted and puckered. * Like many plants under stress, affected cannas will flower very early in the season and before the plant is full height. * Over the years the canna will lose vigour and become increasingly unsightly. * Some are spread by aphids and other sap sucking insects. * At one time it was thought that Cannas may have the ability to outgrow the virus, but that is not the case. * Most authorities advise to burn all affected cannas and start again. * Keep any new introductions well away from potentially infected stock.

It is defined as the distance between chromosome positions (also termed loci or markers) for which the expected average number of intervening chromosomal crossovers in a single generation is 0.01. It is often used to infer distance along a chromosome. However, it is not a true physical distance.  Relation to physical distance The number of base pairs to which it corresponds varies widely across the genome (different regions of a chromosome have different propensities towards crossover) and it also depends on whether the meiosis in which the crossing-over takes place is a part of oogenesis (formation of female gametes) or spermatogenesis (formation of male gametes). One centimorgan corresponds to about 1 million base pairs in humans on average. The relationship is only rough, as the physical chromosomal distance corresponding to one centimorgan varies from place to place in the genome, and also varies between men and women since recombination during gamete formation in females is significantly more frequent than in males. Kong et al. calculated that the female genome is 4460 cM long, while the male genome is only 2590 cM long. Plasmodium falciparum has an average recombination distance of ~15 kb per centimorgan: markers separated by 15 kb of DNA (15,000 nucleotides) have an expected rate of chromosomal crossovers of 0.01 per generation. Note that non-syntenic genes (genes residing on different chromosomes) are inherently unlinked, and cM distances are not applicable to them. Relation to the probability of recombination  Because genetic recombination between two markers is detected only if there are an odd number of chromosomal crossovers between the two markers, the distance in centimorgans does not correspond exactly to the probability of genetic recombination. Assuming J. B. S. Haldane's map function, in which the number of chromosomal crossovers is distributed according to a Poisson distribution, a genetic distance of d centimorgans will lead to an odd number of chromosomal crossovers, and hence a detectable genetic recombination, with probability :\\\\Pr[\\\\text{recombination}|\\\\text{linkage of }d\\\\text{ cM}] = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\Pr[2k + 1 \\\\text{ crossovers}|\\\\text{linkage of }d\\\\text{ cM}] :{} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-d/100} \\\\frac{(d/100)^{2\\\\,k+1}}{(2\\\\,k+1)!} = e^{-d/100} \\\\sinh(d/100) = \\\\frac{1 - e^{-2d/100}}{2}\\\\,, where sinh is the hyperbolic sine function. The probability of recombination is approximately d/100 for small values of d and approaches 50% as d goes to infinity.

The Bactrian camels were used on the Douglas Road and the Old Cariboo Road in 1862 and 1863 to haul freight during the Cariboo Gold Rush. Although the experiment was a failure, the Cariboo camels retained an almost legendary status in local popular culture. Origin On March 1, 1862, an advertisement ran in the Victoria Colonist that offered camels for sale with an address where interested parties could go for further information. The camels were being sold by a San Francisco merchant, Otto Esche, who was probably inspired by the use of dromedary camels by the US Army Camel Corps. These Bactrian camels had worked in Arizona for rail construction and Esche had used them as pack animals during the California Gold Rush.The Cariboo Wagon Road Transportation - Camels The editor of the Colonist ran a headline stating \\"The Camels are Coming!\\" and with the flamboyant journalism typical of the day added, \\"and after they have been disposed of, a number of trained whales will be placed on the route between Victoria and the Stikine River carrying freight and inside passengers a la Jonah\\". On March 15, the Colonist continued the story, reporting that Lillooet man, John Calbreath had purchased 23 of these animals for $300 a head and was planning to use them on the Old Cariboo Road to freight goods from Lillooet to Alexandria. Calbreath was a representative of several other businessmen who were involved in this venture, Frank Laumeister, Adam Heffley and Henry Ingram. However, as the story unfolded, it was Laumeister whose name became the most associated with the Cariboo camels. Both Calbreath and Laumeister would later become involved in the Cassiar Gold Rush, owning stores and operating freighting businesses, although no camels would have any part of these ventures. Arrival of camels The camels arrived in Victoria on April 15 on the steamship Hermann. They remained in the city until May 4 and were the subject of much local interest, as well as more headlines and editorials. One baby camel was born during their stay, and another escaped with its mother into the wilds of Vancouver Island and wouldn't be seen until that fall near Cadboro Bay. The others were loaded onto a barge and towed by William Moore's Flying Dutchman to New Westminster and on to Port Douglas. By the middle of May they were working on the Pemberton Portage on the Douglas Road. BY May 24 they were on their way to Lillooet to work closer to the gold fields.A short paragraph from May 24th 1862 British Colonist http://illahie.blogspot.ca/2012/05/1862-it-was-not-yet-clear-what-would- be.html At first, the camels seemed to be performing well. They could carry up to 500-600 pounds, which was twice what mules could carry, and they were good foragers. However, their soft feet were easily torn up by the harsh terrain of the Cariboo Road and boots of canvas had to be made for them. By the end of June, the first camel train had left Lillooet for Alexandria and the papers reported the one camel was killed when it slid off a cliff into the Pavilion Creek. Soon more reports came in from the Cariboo, mostly complaints from the stagecoach drivers and the miners. Stage horses were terrified at the very sight of camels and even the best trained of them would bolt upon encountering the camels on the road. Furthermore, the camels' varied diet even included pants, shirts, hats and bars of soap. One report mentioned Matthew Baillie Begbie's experience with the camel train and how his mount dashed off into the wilderness with the helpless judge clinging to the saddle. He would despise camels for the rest of his life. By October, the Colonist reported that a dozen camels had survived their first season and were wintering at Quesnel Forks. Decline In May 1863, the camels were back at Lillooet, but after creating more headlines and occasioning more threats of legal action from outraged and exasperated stage drivers, Frank Laumeister retired the camel train for good. What became of the remaining camels has always been a subject of much debate and apocryphal stories. Several were taken in at ranches, either as exotic pets or as working stock, while another was mistaken for a grizzly bear and shot by miner, John Morris, who would forever be known as \\"Grizzly\\" Morris. The camel didn't go to waste but ended up on the menu at a hotel near Beaver Lake as a dinner special called \\"Grizzly's Bear\\". Unconfirmed camel sightings were reported all over the Cariboo and Central British Columbia for decades. Last known survivor The last known surviving camel was known as \\"The Lady\\" and lived at a ranch in Grand Prairie, British Columbia, now Westwold. She died sometime between 1896Lillooet British Columbia and 1905.Camelsfoot Range The Lady is the subject of the only known photograph of the Cariboo camels (shown above). She is shown with W.H.

The history of Rowallan castle  Owners The castle and barony has been owned or held by the medieval Muir family, the (Boyle) Earls of Glasgow, the (Campbell) Earls of Loudoun, and the (Corbett) Barons Rowallan. In 1989, it returned to the Campbell family, the current head of which, Niall Campbell,http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13202372.Historic_Scots_castle_in_rare_handover_to_private_ownerhttp://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/heritage/tim- cornwell-who-s-guarding-the-heritage-guardians-1-2107842#axzz3oIpWh3Cx had his appeal against conviction in March 2017 in his trial at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court and his fine of £800 for threatening or abusive behaviour refused by the Sheriff Appeal Court in Edinburgh in September 2017.

It is said that the earliest piece of Lute music was written at Rowallan.Retrieved on June 11, 2007 It is said to have been visited by the unfortunate King James I of Scotland when on his way from Edinburgh to England. The first Mure holder, Sir J. Gilchrist Mure was buried in the Mure Aisle at Kilmarnock.McIntosh, John (1894) Ayrshire Nights' Entertainments. Pub. Dunlop & Drennan, Kilmarnock. P. 344. Origins The original castle is thought to date back into the 13th century. Rowallan was said to be the birth place of Elizabeth Mure (Muir), first wife of Robert, the High Steward, later Robert II of Scotland. In 1513 John Mure of Rowallan was killed at the Battle of Flodden. In 1513 the Rowallan Estate took its present day form.http://www.rowallancastle.com/ Retrieved on June 10, 2007 In about 1690 the estate was home to the Campbells of Loudoun, who held it into the 19th century. The former tower of Polkelly lay near Rowallan and was also held by the Mures, for a time passed to the second son until it passed by marriage to the Cunninghams of Cunninghamhead. Construction and other details Rowallan Castle today William Aiton's map of 1811 showing Rowellan (sic) The castle is built around a small knoll and once stood in a small loch or swampy area, fed by the Carmel Burn.McGibbon, Page 378 The southern front of the castle was erected about the year 1562 by John Mure of Rowallan and his Lady, Marion Cuninghame, of the family of Cuninghamhead. This information appears as an inscription on a marriage stone or tablet at the top of the wall: - Jon.Mvr. M.Cvgm. Spvsis 1562. The family coat of arms lies to the right. The crest of the Mure's was a Moore's head, which is sculptured near the coat of arms. This is no doubt a rebus or jeu-de- mot on the Mure name, however it is suggested that it is a reference to some feat performed in the crusades against the Saracens.Dobie, James. (1876) Cuninghame Topographized by Timothy Pont. Pub. John Tweed, Glasgow. Facing P. 366. The Royal Arms of Scotland, fully blazoned, are carved over the main entrance, together with the shields of the Cumin family, from whom the Mures claim descent.

Sir John and Sir William Muir took great pleasure in the erection of the various parts of Rowallan, and a record was kept of the portions completed by each. Much of their attention was also taken up with the planting of the castle policies.MacGibbon, T. and Ross, D. (1887-92). The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland from the twelfth to the eighteenth centuries, 5v, Edinburgh. p 555. Part of the castle was known as the 'Woman's House' indicating a time when gender separation was the norm for the privileged classes, reflected in the decoration of these apartments and the sewing and other work undertaken by the ladies of the house.The Woman's House In 1691 the Hearth Tax records show that the castle had twenty-two hearths and eighteen other dwellings were associated with the castle and its lands.Urquhart, Robert H. et al. (1998). The Hearth Tax for Ayrshire 1691. Ayrshire Records Series V.1. Ayr : Ayr Fed Hist Soc . p. 86 Edith Rawdon-Hastings, 10th Countess of Loudoun, was especially fond of Rowallan and spent considerable sums repairing the castle in the 19th century. Without her efforts the building would not have survived down to the present day. Row Allan, row! In connection with the rebus mentioned, a tale is told of one Allan of Stewarton who was rowing a Scottish chief off the Ayrshire coast. The weather made a turn for the worse and the chief became anxious. The chief in his fear of the ocean said to Allan, Row, Allan row! Bear me to safety and you will have the rich lands of Carmelside, wuth silver to build yourself a castle. Hill and valley and rivers of fish will be yours .... but just row, Allan, row! Allan won his prize and named the estate 'Rowallan' after his adventure. This however is a folk etymology; the correct derivation of Rowallan being from the Scottish Gaelic 'Rubha Àlainn', or 'beautiful headland'. The same story is told in the form of a poem written by the Rev. George Paxton from Kilmaurs, pastor of a Secession Church from 1789 - 1807.Blair, Anna (1983) Tales of Ayrshire. Pub.

Rowallan Castle in 1866 Covenanting times Sir William Mure wrote a history of his family and though an ardent covenanter, opposed the execution of Charles I, writing an elegy upon his death. Conventicles were not infrequently held within the mansion, which from its position was anciently called the Craig of Rowallan.Paterson, James (1866), History of the Counties of Ayr and Wigton. Pub. James Stillie, Edinburgh. Vol. III. p. 413. For this, he fell under the suspicion of the Government, and on several occasions suffered imprisonment. Part of the old castle is called the 'Auld Kirk' in memory of covenanting days. As stated, Sir William befriended the Covenanters, and as much as possible protected his tenantry from the tyranny of the troopers who scoured the countryside at the period. He was intimate with the Rev. William Guthrie of Fenwick, who preached upon several occasions in the \\"auld kirk\\" of the castle.Adamson, Archibald R. (1875), Rambles Round Kilmarnock. Pub. T. Stevenson, Kilmarnock. P. 150. In the 1640s Alasdair Mac Colla had been sent by Montrose to suppress support for the Covenanting cause. Based in Kilmarnock, he plundered the Ayrshire countryside for some days and then demanded financial penalties. Sir William Mure's penalty for preventing further plundering at Rowallan was 1,000 merks; much damage already having been done.Stevenson, David (1994). Highland Warrior.

This fox would watch the world go by from its perch and was sufficiently savvy to leave the house keepers chickens alone. One day this fox encountered the local hunt and ran to cover in the tree, to the amazement and consternation of the hunters and hounds. The housekeeper dislodged the poor animal, however it escaped the hunt and was back in its tree the following day as if nothing untoward had happened.Adamson, Archibald R. (1875), Rambles Round Kilmarnock. Pub. T. Stevenson, Kilmarnock. P. 140.  The marriage tree  Near to the castle, overlooking a chasm through which the Carmel runs, stood a stately 'marriage tree' on the bank known as 'Janet's Kirn', Scots for 'churn.' Under this tree Dame Jean Mure of Rowallan was married to William Fairlie of Bruntsfield, an estate near Edinburgh. This wedding was part of a well planned elopement, the suitor having brought a minister with him.Adamson, Archibald R. (1875), Rambles Round Kilmarnock. Pub. T. Stevenson, Kilmarnock.

When this change of use has been completed, the site’s designation as a Listed Building, rather than as a Scheduled Monument, will take precedence.

Dalmusternock Dalmusternock House was built in 1615 by William Mure as a dower house following his marriage to Anna Dundas. Micro-history The owner, Niall Campbell and family, had intended that the castle would be used for residential accommodation, but it was retained for some years in the guardianship of Historic Scotland.Kilmarnock Standard Retrieved : 2011-10-15. However, as a result of a controversial decision following protracted legal wrangles, it left Historic Scotland's care as of 2015. Arthur Cameron Corbett, 3rd Baron Rowallan had his second marriage annulled in 1970 on the grounds that his wife, April Ashley, a transsexual woman, was a man under then-current UK law. The argument was accepted, and the case served as a precedent for all such cases until the Gender Recognition Act 2004 was passed, which provided the needed legal framework for changing a person's legal gender.

It is a double-edged knife with a curved blade of approximately 12 inches. Initially a tool similar to a grape hook, it was widely used in combat during the War of the Pacific. It was not standard issue, but rather a personal weapon or tool that the soldiers brought with them from home. Per local legend, but now widely debunked by historians, Chilean soldiers would consume chupilca del diablo in order to drive themselves into a frenzy prior to close-combat, attacking the enemy with their corvos. When fighting with a corvo, the wielder will not feint with the blade itself; traditionally it is used in conjunction with a rag, poncho or stick in the off-hand, which allows the bearer to parry an incoming attack. The corvo is then used to counterattack with a swiping, slashing or stabbing motion. Due to its popularity, the Chilean army refined the weapon and added it to their arsenal. Today it is the traditional symbol of Chilean commandos and its use is encouraged in training. Variants There are a few different models of corvo, the modern versions are: *Corvo Comando, or Pico de Condor (Condor's Beak), with a nearly 90 degree bend that spans a third of the blade. *Corvo atacameño or Garra de Puma (Cougar Claw), which has a very slight curve to the blade (equal to approximately 45°) but is normally longer than the Commando variant.

They form one of the largest groups of the Dutch diaspora outside Europe. History The history of the Dutch and Australia began with Captain Willem Janszoon, a Dutch seafarer, who was the first European to land on Australian soil in 1606.Early Dutch Landfall Discoveries of AustraliaAllies in Adversity at the Australian War Memorial The Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) had its headquarters in the Far East in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) from 1619, but traded from many Asian harbours from 1602. The journey from the Netherlands to the Dutch East Indies would take more than a year by traditional route, but after the discovery of the Roaring Forties by Dutch captain Hendrick Brouwer, who established the so called Brouwer Route in 1611 the voyage would be cut short by months, taking a trajectory along the southern latitudes of the Indian Ocean. By 1617 all VOC ships were ordered to take this route. The navigation technique of that time, known as dead reckoning, caused some ships to travel too far east so they sighted the Australian west coast, and a small number of them were wrecked there. Dirk Hartog made the first European landing of the Australian west coast with a pewter plate in 1616. Known ships wrecked off that include the Batavia, the Vergulde Dreak, the Zuytdorp and the Zeewijk. The wreck of the Batavia on Houtman Abrolhos during her maiden voyage, turned into a bloody mutiny led by Jeronimus Corneliszoon after the survivors had landed on an island and Commander Pelsaert had left to get help. The most famous Dutch seafarer to explore the Australian coasts is Abel Tasman, who was the first to circumvigate the continent in 1642-3. He established that the land was not the gigantic legendary southern continent that included the South Pole and he named it New Holland. Tasmania which Tasman had named Van Diemens Land and the Tasman Sea were eventually named after him. Most of the Australian coastline was first charted by VOC mariners, excluding the east coast and the eastern part of the south coast. The continent would be renamed \\"Australia\\" in the 19th century. 20th century The 50,000th migrant arrived in 1954 A number of people from the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) found their way to Australia during World War II and joined Allied forces in the fight against the Japanese. The Dutch East Indies government operated from Australia during the war. Free Dutch Submarines operated out of Fremantle after the invasion of Java. The joint No. 18 and No. 120 RAAF squadrons formed at Canberra, and was a combined Dutch and Australian Squadron. It used B-25 Mitchell bombers, supplied by the Dutch Government before the war. The Netherlands East Indies Forces Intelligence Service (NEFIS) was based in Melbourne during the war. Post-war settlers in Australia arrived as part of Australia's assisted migration program. Many arrived by sea on the MS Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, while others flew with KLM. Demographics According to 2006 census data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 310,089 people claimed Dutch ancestry, full or partial, Total responses: 25,451,383 for total count of persons: 19,855,288. and 78,927 people declared they were born in the Netherlands. Total count of persons: 19,855,288. The level of immigration from the Netherlands has dropped significantly since the 1980s. 79% of Australian residents born in the Netherlands arrived before 1980. The Dutch-born population is also ageing; 52% of the Dutch-born population was aged sixty years old or older in 2006. 26,141 Dutch-born Australians (33%) speak Dutch at home; lots more speak English at home (64%). Proficiency in English was described by census respondents as \\"very well\\" by 27%, \\"well\\" by 7%, and \\"not well\\" by less than 1%. Of Australian residents born in the Netherlands, 59,502 (75%) were Australian citizens. 61% of Dutch-born Australians recorded their religion as Christian, and 29% were irreligious.

Born in Svishtov in 1863, he graduated in philosophy in Leipzig. In 1885, while en route to the battlefield during the Serbo-Bulgarian War, Radoslavov composed the song Gorda Stara Planina (\\"Proud Old Mountain\\"), which was polished by the composer Dobri Hristov in 1905 and became a national anthem of Bulgaria in 1963 as Mila Rodino. Besides creating the Bulgarian national anthem, Radoslavov was also a prominent scientist. He was one of the three Bulgarians (with Dr Krastyo Krastev and Dimitar Aleksiev) that took their doctor's degree by the father of modern psychology, Wilhelm Wundt. Rejecting invitations to work as a teacher in Vienna, Leipzig and Prague, he returned to Bulgaria to work at the Third High School for Boys in Sofia, believing he was helping the development of modern Bulgaria by teaching students European and ancient languages, psychology, ethics and logic. Radoslavov lived in a small apartment at 3 Angel Kanchev Street, where he is today commemorated by a plaque by Georgi Chapkanov.

Description A slide viewer is usually a small handheld device with a slot in which a slide can be inserted to see a magnified illuminated view of it. A slide viewer is an instrument for individual viewing. Some models have an automatic feeder for inserting multiple slides and some have a slot for a strip of film. The slide viewer may rely upon natural light or incorporate a light source. Stereo slide viewer A View-Master Model E of the 1950s The practice of viewing stereoscopic film-based transparencies through a small magnifying viewer dates to at least as early as 1931, when Tru-Vue began to market black-and-white 35 mm filmstrips that were fed through a handheld viewer made of Bakelite. In 1939, a radically different viewer, also designed for use with commercially prepared stereo images, was introduced as the View- Master. Images in color on small pieces of Kodachrome film came mounted in rectangular openings near the edge of a cardboard disk, which, despite being quite flat, was officially known as a View-Master \\"reel\\". Each reel contained seven image pairs, the left-eye and right-eye images being diametrically opposite. A lever was used to rotate the reel in increments so as to present each image pair in sequence. Eventually, the viewers were available in several models, including some that were illuminated by flashlight bulbs powered by a line current transformer or batteries, as well as \\"talking\\" View-Masters. Viewers and reels in the View-Master format are still being made today. One category of material still in production is children's fairy tale story scenes and brief stories using popular cartoon characters. These use photographs of three-dimensional model sets and characters. Another category is scenic views associated with a tourist destination, typically sold at gift shops located at the attraction. A major innovation in 1947 was the introduction of the Stereo Realist camera and viewer system. Using Kodachrome or other 35 mm slide film, this equipment made startlingly lifelike amateur stereoscopic color photography possible at a reasonable cost. The system was well-advertised and experienced a surge in popularity. Other makes of cameras employing the Realist format began appearing in the early 1950s. The Stereo Realist and competing products can still be found in estate sales and elsewhere, and some enthusiasts still use them to take pictures. An advantage offered by transparency viewing as compared to earlier card stereoscopes is that a wider field of view may be presented because the images, being illuminated from the rear, may be placed much closer to the lenses. In ordinary viewers, the simple, inexpensive lenses necessarily have relatively long focal lengths so that the entirety of the images will appear reasonably sharp, and consequently the field of view occupied by the images is small. To magnify the images so that they will occupy a much larger visual angle and still be sharp and undistorted, suitable high-quality multi-element short focal length lenses must be used. Such lenses are quite expensive and are not found in most stereo viewers. For optimum realism, the images to be so viewed must be created using equivalent wide-angle camera lenses.

The conference was held each spring at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Unlike many of Microsoft's technical conference, MIX has been promoted more heavily to designers by inviting popular speakers from other popular web design conferences, such as SXSW, and has sponsored a CSS design contest each year to promote the conference. Microsoft has also used this conference as an opportunity to promote new web design and development tools such as Silverlight and Microsoft Expression Studio. On January 24, 2012, the official Microsoft blog stated that there will be no MIX 2012. MIX was replaced by Build later that year. MIX 06 MIX 06 was held from March 20 to March 22, 2006. It focused on the new Internet Explorer 7 and WPF (a part called WPF/E later became known as Silverlight). It featured a keynote by Bill Gates in which he said \\"We need microformats\\". MIX 07 MIX 07 was held from April 30 to May 7, 2007. The primary focus of the MIX 2007 was promoting Silverlight. The majority of the session content was focused on demonstrating Silverlight applications and the development tools used to build them. The main keynote, given by Scott Guthrie was also promoting Silverlight. Microsoft Expression Studio was also released to manufacturing thereafter. reMIX Events Along with the main conference in Las Vegas, several reMIX events were held throughout 2007 in other cities. The reMIX conferences represented the sessions from MIX with different keynote speakers. MIX 08 MIX 08 was held from March 5–March 7, 2008. The first beta release of Microsoft's Windows Internet Explorer 8 was demonstrated and contained many new features, including WebSlices and Activities. MIX 09 MIX 09 was held from March 18–20, 2009. Availability of the final version of Internet Explorer 8 was announced, as well as a demonstration of Silverlight 3 and Expression Blend 3.0 betas. Microsoft released beta tooling for software developers SDTimes.com to create applications using Silverlight, which is Microsoft’s framework for creating rich Internet applications. Microsoft released version 1.0 of ASP.NET MVC on March 13, 2009, just prior to the MIX event. MVC stands for model–view–controller and refers to a particular process for building web applications. Microsoft also announced at MIX 2009 that Silverlight 3 would support H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video, an emerging Web video standard adopted by such sites as YouTube. In addition, Microsoft said applications built using Silverlight 3 can run offline as well as in a Web browser.Silverlight Website MIX 10 MIX 10 was held from March 15–17, 2010 in Las Vegas. The main focus of MIX 10 was on the next version of Microsoft's web browser, Internet Explorer 9, and Microsoft's highly anticipated next-generation mobile platform, Windows Phone 7. Microsoft's Silverlight technology also had a large appearance at the conference, as it has for the last few years at MIX. On the first day of MIX 2010, Microsoft released a number of software development toolkits for Windows Phone 7 application developers to use, including a Silverlight 4 multimedia toolkit, for developing Rich Internet Applications (RIA), and a beta release of Microsoft Expression Blend 4, a GUI-designed and code-generating toolkit. The tools will run inside Windows PC Visual Studio 2010. Microsoft demonstrated a number of applications that had already been created to run on Windows Phone 7, including a news reader app from the Associated Press and an app called Seesmic for managing Twitter accounts and feeds.Network World MIX10 Day 1: Windows Phone developer tools now available.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones and Maurice Noble, and written by Jones and John Dunn. The short was released on April 27, 1963. The title comes from a phrase used aboard American naval ships as an instruction to cease activity and listen to the announcement that will follow. This cartoon resembles a UPA cartoon (whose cartoons had used limited animation techniques) more than a typical Warner Bros. short of the time. Plot Satan, the Head Devil, loses his left horn, which is found by an elderly man in Britain (there are clues to the cartoon's location; a bin says \\"Keep Britain Tidy\\" and Rule Britannia is heard twice) who uses it as a hearing trumpet. Soon the man experiences a series of aural and visual hallucinations: A bug sounds like a locomotive; a butterfly causes him to see strange patterns; a short man in a pink suit makes mischief, at one point pulling a telephone from the horn and turning the phone's mouthpiece into a shower outlet. These hallucinations become steadily more strange and frightening before finally culminating in a \\"GIGANTIC EXPLOSION!\\" Having suffered enough, the gentleman leaves the horn behind in favor of his original ear trumpet, which he had thrown out at the cartoon's beginning. After he leaves, Satan materializes and is glad to find his missing horn; he screws it back on and disappears. The cartoon ends with the moral: \\"The other fellow's trumpet always looks greener\\".

DePatie Title sequence This was the first Warner Bros. cartoon short to use the \\"modern\\" abstract opening and closing sequences, which would be used on all mid-1960s WB shorts, mainly produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises and Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Animation. This is also one of the rare Looney Tunes shorts to list the director's name first. At the close of the cartoon, when the \\"modern\\" close is in progress, they have the first four notes of the Westminster Quarters play to bring on the four elements of the \\"WB\\" lettering, then as the words \\"A Warner Bros. CartOOn\\" scroll appear, Big Ben chimes, and then as the OO's in Cartoon separate from the words, a bicycle horn is heard squeaking three times. Big Ben gives one more chime as the words finish appearing on the screen before the fadeout. This closing sequence is seen in two more cartoons: Bartholomew Versus the Wheel and Señorella and the Glass Huarache. An updated variant was used on DFE-produced cartoons until the W7 era, except instead of Big Ben's chimes and the honks, a reprise of Bill Lava's version of \\"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\\" is heard, and (with the exception of Pancho's Hideaway) instead of the background being white, the background is black. The sequence was the idea of Chuck Jones; however, he was fired before he moved on to MGM Animation/Visual Arts due to participating in an animated production by United Productions of America, Gay Purr-ee (the film was later picked up by Warner for distribution), and he couldn't direct any more cartoons with this opening.

He was a French humanist and an engraver, best known for adding accents on letters in French. His life's work has heavily influenced French publishing to this day. Life Geoffroy Tory was born in Bourges in 1480, a decade after the first printing press arrived in Paris. He attended the local university, where he developed an interest in Latin literature. After completing his studies, Tory left Bourges for Italy, where he studied at two additional universities: first, the Sapienza at Rome, and then Bologna, where he studied under Philip Beroaldus, a well-known Latinist. The exact date of Tory's death is unknown, however it is said in a lease that in 1533 his wife was a widow.The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1920, page 86 Career Around 1505, Tory left for Paris after completing his studies in Italy. He worked there as a bookbinder, editor of texts, and corrector for the press, serving such clients as Jean Grolier de Servières. The first book Tory is known to have worked on is the Pomponius Mela, in 1508. This work helped him to develop a rather large reputation, despite his youth. In 1509 he became one of the youngest professors to teach at the Collège du Plessis. While Tory taught, he continued to work on his passion of bookbinding and editing. Tory was known to be an extremely hard worker, often taking on large workloads. Some time around 1511, he became a professor at Collège de Coqueret, and soon after at the Collège de Bourgogne, which at the time was a principal unit of the University of Paris. His lectures were said to draw large audiences. Tory's interest in this period turned to the arts, especially painting and engraving. Several years after joining the Collège de Bourgogne, he resigned his post and moved to Italy so as to better study Italian art. Beyond his passing references to his travels in Champ Fleury, there is not much known of Tory at this time. He returned to Paris in 1518 and began regularly producing woodcuts, for which he gained a reputation among Parisian editors. It was during this same period that Tory took up selling books himself. In 1514 Tory married the widow of a friend of his, fathering a daughter named Agnès. Tory doted on her, teaching her Latin and about his life's work. Unfortunately, Agnès died from unknown reasons when she was nine, and Tory was long depressed over the death of his beloved daughter. When Tory published for the first time, his printer's mark was the urn that he kept Agnès' ashes in. In the months following her death, Tory wrote several pieces of poetry, claiming how lucky he was to have had such a daughter, and how her life influenced him. At the time, it was not uncommon for children to die at a young age, so it was unusual for Tory to have taken her death as hard as he did. It is said that her death influenced the creativity in his later works. In 1524 he discovered The Book of Hours, and in 1525 Geoffroy published a copy, which became famous because he introduced there a type design that was free of the idea of printing which duplicated handwriting. This work also initiated the idea of book designing as an art in France. In 1529 Tory published his own book, Champfleury, one of the most important and influential works of the time. It set a standard for French publishing that in many ways is still followed today. In the introduction to Champfleury, Tory is quoted as saying that there are three different kinds of men who corrupt the French language; the \\"skimmers of Latin\\", the \\"jokers\\", and the \\"slangers\\". Gradually, he managed to acquire French texts to put into print, at a time when that was only done for Latin texts. For that purpose, he introduced the apostrophe, the acute accent and grave accent, and the cedilla. He wanted to reform French spelling to reflect its Latin roots. In 1530 Tory became official printer to King Francis I,Le Petit Robert des Noms Propres and in 1532 he was made a librarian at the University of Paris. Works Champfleury Champfleury was written by Tory and published in 1529. It is divided into three books, and is concerned with the proper use of the French language, dealing with topics ranging from the elegance of the alphabet to the proper use of grammar. It was subtitled \\"The Art and Science of the Proportion of the Attic or Ancient Roman Letters, According to the Human Body and Face\\". Champfleury was not as stylized as The Book of Hours, but it gives great insight into the mind of Tory, his pedantic attitude and his meticulous devotion to the French Language.The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1920, page 84 Tory used a square grid to describe the shape of letters, which eerily predicts the use of pixelation in modern-day typefaces. Although \\"Champfleury\\" roughly translates to \\"flowery fields\\", it is also a French idiom for \\"paradise\\". The Book of Hours The Book of Hours (French Livre d'heures), Tory's most famous work, was completed in 1525. It is printed in a light Roman typeface. There are 17 known copies of the 1531 Book of Hours, which is the year that Tory published it. It contained sixteen full page borders and thirteen large woodcuts. This version is the most famous to this day for breaking all the traditions of the time. The illustrations in the book are not perfect, as Tory did them all himself, and despite a passion for art, he did not have the talent of a master artist. The Book of Hours success led to Tory's being granted specific privileges by King François I to publish his own works.

The reddish color of terra rossa is the result of the preferential formation of hematite over goethite. This soil type typically occurs as a discontinuous layer that ranges from a few centimeters to several meters in thickness that covers limestone and dolomite bedrock in karst regions. The high internal drainage and neutral pH conditions of terra rossa are a result of the karstic nature of the underlying limestone and dolomite.Torrent, J., 2005. Mediterranean soils. In: Hillel, D.

Terra rossa is also found associated with Mediterranean climates and karst elsewhere in the world.Muhs, D.R. and Budahn, J.R., 2009. Geochemical evidence for African dust and volcanic ash inputs to terra rossa soils on carbonate reef terraces, northern Jamaica, West Indies. Quaternary International, 196(1-2), pp. 13-35. Compared to most clayey soils, terra rossa has surprisingly good drainage characteristics. This makes it a popular soil type for wine production. Among other wine regions, it is found in La Mancha in Spain and the Coonawarra, Fleurieu and Barossa Valley growing areas in Australia.Huggett, J.M., 2006. Geology and wine: a review. Proceedings of the Geologists' Association, 117(2), pp. 239-247.  Origin of terra rossa  The origin of terra rossa, its parent material, and its relationship to underlying limestones and dolomites has been greatly debated over recent decades by geologists, geomorphologists, and soil scientists.Yaalon, D.H., 1997. Soils in the Mediterranean region: what makes them different? Catena, 28, 157–169. One group of scientists argue that terra rossa likely developed from dissolution of the underlying carbonate rocks and the concentration insoluble sediment and chert within it as the parent material of terra rossa.Ji, H., Wang, S., Ouyang, Z., Zhang, S., Sun, C., Liu, X., Zhou, D., 2004a. Geochemistry of red residua underlying dolomites in karst terrains of Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau I. The formation of the Pingba profile.

Geochemistry of red residua underlying dolomites in karst terrains of Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau II. The mobility of rare earth elements during weathering. Chemical Geology, 203, 29–50. Another group of scientists argue that terra rossa cannot have been formed exclusively from the insoluble residue of underlying limestone and dolomite. Instead they propose that terra rossa is polygenetic in origin and that, depending on their geographic location, their parent material, which has been altered by pedogenesis, contains exotic sediments from volcanic ash; non-limestone and non-dolomite; and aeolian sources.Sandler, A., Meunier, A., Velde, B., 2015. Mineralogical and chemical variability of mountain red/brown Mediterranean soils. Geoderma, 239–240, 156–167. A final group of scientists argue that terra rossa was formed by metasomatic replacement processes.Lucke, B., Kemnitz, H., Baümler, R., Schmidt, M., 2014. Red Mediterranean soils in Jordan: new insights in their origin, genesis, and role as environmental archives. Catena, 112, 4–24. Red Mediterranean In pedology, red Mediterranean soil, also known as terra rossa (Italian for \\"red soil\\") is a soil classification that has been formally superseded by the formal classifications of systems such as the FAO soil classification, but that is still in common use. The terra rossa classification was still, as of 1997, a part of the national soil classifications of countries such as Israel and Italy. The UNESCO/FAO World map equivalents are the chromic luvisols (a sub- order of the luvisols), and the USDA soil taxonomy equivalent is the rhodustalfs (a sub-order of the ustalfs). The classification denotes red- coloured soils (sometimes called \\"red rendzinas\\") which develop in or on the karstic landscape of the limestones of the Miocene and earlier periods, as well as calcretes in regions where the modern Mediterranean climate is predominant. The most accelerated development of red Mediterranean soils occurred from the Miocene to the Late Pleistocene, due to the large amount of climate fluctuation in those periods.

El Confidencial Craig Ross borrowed a guitar from a neighbor's garage at age eight. He began playing the music of the Beatles and Chuck Berry, his early influences. Career Before the age of sixteen, Ross started playing the L.A. clubs and eventually formed the band The Broken Homes while in high school, and going by the stage name Kreg Ross. They opened for prominent musicians like Stevie Ray Vaughan, INXS, and Jerry Lee Lewis, among others, while doing clubs gigs with bands such as Guns N' Roses and Jane's Addiction. The band made three records for MCA records in the 80s, working with producers such as Andy Johns of Led Zeppelin and Rolling Stones fame. This seminal period gave Craig his education in studio work. His musical influences include Freddie King, Albert King, Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page. A 'chance meeting' in an L.A. pool hall with Lenny Kravitz (facilitated by Kathy Valentine of The Go-Go's) led to a thirteen year association. After touring with Kravitz for 1991's \\"Mama Said\\", Craig joined Lenny in the studio, co-writing and playing all the guitars on the track \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\", an anthem that helped elevate Lenny's career to new heights. The collaboration continued with stand-out solos on tracks such as \\"Believe\\" and \\"Is There Any love in Your Heart\\" helping make Lenny a top rock act. Craig has written and played on every subsequent Lenny album since as well as records by Sheryl Crow, Mick Jagger, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, The Black Crowes, Nikka Costa and others. Ross co-wrote the songs \\"Spinning Around Over You\\", \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\", \\"Is There Any Love in Your Heart\\", \\"Where Are We Runnin'?\\", \\"Stillness of Heart\\", and \\"Lady\\" with Kravitz, as well as a number of songs on Kravitz's 2008 release It Is Time for a Love Revolution. He also toured with Kravitz, including at the Glastonbury Festival in 1999.\\"Live Reviews: The Glastonbury Festival June 25-27, 1999\\". Chart Attack, Richard Beland, June 25–27, 1999. Ross played on The Black Crowes 2001 album, Lions, on the track \\"Greasy Grass River\\", and on former Black Crowes guitarist Marc Ford's first solo album, It's About Time in 2003. Ross, with Lenny Kravitz, performed at the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors tribute to Led Zeppelin by playing \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".

Appearing in Britain from late summer to late autumn, it is edible. It is classified as a category 4 edible mushroom in Russia. Taxonomy The species was first described and named as Agaricus nebularis in 1789 by August Johann Georg Karl Batsch. It was later placed in the genus Clitocybe in 1871 by Paul Kummer as Clitocybe nebularis. After much consideration by many mycologists, over some years, when it was placed for periods in both Lepista, and Gymnopus, it was placed back in Clitocybe with the specific epithet, and 1871 creditation it retains today. Clitocybe nebularis var. alba Bataille (1911), differs only in having a milk white cap, and is very rare. Description The cap of the mushroom is 5–25 cm (2–8 in) in diameter, convex with an incurved margin, becoming plane to depressed in shape. Cap colours are generally greyish to light brownish-grey, and often covered in a whitish bloom when young. The surface of the cap is usually dry to moist, and radially fibrillose. The stem is stout, swollen towards the base, becomes hollow with age, and is easily broken. It is usually somewhat lighter than the cap. The flesh is white, and very thick. It has a foul-smelling odour, which has been described as slightly farinaceous to rancid. This species is host to the parasitic gilled mushroom Volvariella surrecta, which is found on older specimens. It may be confused with the poisonous Entoloma sinuatum both in Europe or North America, though this species has pink sinuate gills. Edibility It is widely consumed but is 'generally considered better to be avoided'.Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe - Michael Jordan Gallery File:Cluded Agaric pileus.JPG|The Pileus or cap File:Clouded Agaric Gills.JPG|Detail of the gills File:Clouded Agaric underside.JPG|The gills and cut stipe (stalk) File:Hexenring Nebelgrauer Trichterling.JPG|C. nebularis growing in a fairy ring formation Nevelzwam ( nebularis) (d.j.b.) 02.jpg|Close up of the top of a fully Clitocybe nebularis.

He had studied and exhibited in Paris as a young man and was also considered one of the Hungarian Fauves. Early life and education Róbert Berény was born in Budapest in 1887. As a young man of 17, in 1904 he studied under the artist Tivadar Zemplényi for several months before moving to study at the Académie Julian in Paris.BudapestposterBenezit BerényGrove Art Online, Berény While there, Berény was particularly influenced by the power of Paul Cézanne's art. He also adopted some of the uses of color of the Fauve movement, and exhibited at the Salon d'Automne with French artists of the Fauvists.Hungarian Fauves from Paris to Nagybánya, 1904-1914: Exhibition in the Hungarian National Gallery, 21 March--30 July 2006, Kristina Passuth and György Szǔcs, Lóránd Bereczky, 2006Russell T. Clement, Les Fauves: A Sourcebook, Greenwood Publishing Group, Jan 1, 1994 Career Berény is best known for his form of expressionism and cubism, which he developed in association with the avant-garde group known as The Eight, who had their first exhibit together in Budapest in 1909. They included the leader Károly Kernstok, Lajos Tihanyi, Béla Czóbel, Dezső Czigány, Ödön Márffy, Dezső Orbán, and Bertalan Pór. He brought to them French influences from his time in Paris. At their next exhibition, in 1911, the group identified as A Nyolcak, or \\"The Eight.\\" They essentially formed the core of modernist experimentation, and were part of radical intellectual currents in music and literature, as well. Berény's most important work of this early period is his portrait of the composer Béla Bartók (1913). That year he also painted Scene. In 1919, Berény participated in the art life of the brief Hungarian Democratic Republic, and was the leader of the department for painting in the Art Directorate. After the fall of the republic that year, Berény emigrated to Berlin, together with numerous other Hungarian artists and writers. He lived and worked there for several years, continuing his emphasis on cubism and expressionism. He did not return to Hungary until 1926. After 1934, he worked in Zebegény, near the Danube Bend in northern Hungary. He was awarded the Szinnyei Prize in 1936. During the last year of World War II, Berény's atelier was destroyed, together with many of his works. After the war, under the communist government, he became a teacher in what is now the Hungarian University of Fine Arts in Budapest. He died in 1953. Since the late twentieth century and the political changes in eastern Europe, there has been renewed interest in Hungary's early modernist artists. The exhibits below have honored Berény and others of The Eight, and two bracket the centenary of their first exhibit in 1911 under that name.  Rediscovered work  A Berény painting titled Sleeping Lady with Black Vase, whose whereabouts had been unknown since 1928, was re-discovered by chance in 2009 by art historian Gergely Barki upon watching the 1999 American film Stuart Little with his daughter, where the piece was used as a prop. An assistant set designer had bought the painting cheaply from a California antique store for use in the film, and had kept it in her home after production ended.

As a result of each country having different policies and priorities, a variety of differences now exist between these systems. Despite there being separate health services for each country, the performance of the National Health Service (NHS) across the UK can be measured for the purpose of making international comparisons. In a 2017 report by the Commonwealth Fund ranking developed-country healthcare systems, the United Kingdom was ranked the best healthcare system in the world overall and was ranked the best in the following categories: Care Process (i.e. effective, safe, coordinated, patient-oriented) and Equity. The UK system was ranked the best in the world overall in the previous three reports by the Commonwealth Fund in 2007, 2010 and 2014. The UK's palliative care has also been ranked as the best in the world by the Economist Intelligence Unit.; On the other hand, in 2005-09 cancer survival rates lagged ten years behind the rest of Europe,; although survival rates continue to increase.; ; ; ; ; ; In 2015, the UK was 14th (out of 35) in the annual Euro health consumer index. It was criticised for its poor accessibility and \\"an autocratic top-down management culture\\". The index has in turn been criticized by academics, however.Cylus, Jonathan; Nolte, Ellen; Figueras, Josep; McKee, Martin (9 February 2016). \\"What, if anything, does the EuroHealth Consumer Index actually tell us?\\". BMJ. Retrieved 10 February 2016. The total expenditure on healthcare as a proportion of GDP in 2013 was 8.5%, below the OECD average of 8.9% and considerably less than comparable economies such as France (10.9%), Germany (11.0%), Netherlands (11.1%), Switzerland (11.1%) and the USA (16.4%).OECD, \\"Health Expenditure\\". Accessed 10 February 2016. The percentage of healthcare provided directly by the state is higher than most European countries, which have insurance-based healthcare with the state providing for those who cannot afford insurance. In 2017 the UK spent £2,989 per person on healthcare, the second lowest of the Group of Seven, but around the median for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The NHS has a reasonable claim to be the most efficient healthcare system in the world. The 2018 OECD data, which incorporates in health a chunk of what in the UK is classified as social care, has the UK spending £3121 per head, France £3471, Australia £3892, Germany £4057 and Sweden £4877. The exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union could make an impact on the healthcare industry if there is a \\"no deal\\" Brexit. There are speculations that the supply of medicines to the UK will be hit. As a precautionary measure, the government has asked the drug companies to stock up a six-week supply of medicines and make arrangements for their storage. Common features Each NHS system uses General Practitioners (GPs) to provide primary healthcare and to make referrals to further services as necessary. Hospitals then provide more specialist services, including care for patients with psychiatric illnesses, as well as direct access to Accident and Emergency (A&E;) departments. Community pharmacies are privately owned but have contracts with the relevant health service to supply prescription drugs. The public healthcare system also provides free (at the point of service) ambulance services for emergencies, when patients need the specialist transport only available from ambulance crews or when patients are not fit to travel home by public transport. These services are generally supplemented when necessary by the voluntary ambulance services (British Red Cross, St Andrews Ambulance Association and St John Ambulance). In addition, patient transport services by air are provided by the Scottish Ambulance Service in Scotland and elsewhere by county or regional air ambulance trusts (sometimes operated jointly with local police helicopter services) throughout England and Wales. In specific emergencies, emergency air transport is also provided by naval, military and air force aircraft of whatever type might be appropriate or available on each occasion, and dentists can only charge NHS patients at the set rates for each country. Patients opting to be treated privately do not receive any NHS funding for the treatment. About half of the income of dentists in England comes from work sub-contracted from the NHS, however not all dentists choose to do NHS work. When purchasing drugs, the NHS has significant market power that, based on its own assessment of the fair value of the drugs, influences the global price, typically keeping prices lower. Several other countries either copy the U.K.'s model or directly rely on Britain’s assessments for their own decisions on state-financed drug reimbursements. Private medicine Private medicine, where patients, or their insurers, pay for treatment in the UK is a niche market. Some is provided by NHS hospitals. Private providers also contract with the NHS, especially in England, to provide treatment for NHS patients, particularly in mental health and planned surgery. Patients also go abroad for treatment. In 2014 about 48,000 went abroad for treatment and about 144,000 in 2016. This may be driven by increasing waiting times for NHS treatment, but will also include migrants who may return to their home country for treatment, especially childbirth. It also includes fertility services, dentistry and cosmetic surgery which may not be available on the NHS. See Medical tourism. Healthcare in England The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, a National Health Service hospital. Most healthcare in England is provided by the NHS England, England's publicly funded healthcare system, which accounts for most of the Department of Health and Social Care's budget (£122.5 billion The £122.5bn budget consists of £116.4bn Departmental Expenditure Limit (operating budget) and £6.1bn capital budget. in 2017-18). Commissioning In April 2013, under the terms of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, a reorganisation of the NHS took place regarding the administration of the NHS. Primary care trusts (PCTs) and strategic health authorities (SHAs) were abolished, and replaced by clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). CCGs now commission most of the hospital and community NHS services in the local areas for which they are responsible. Commissioning involves deciding what services a population is likely to need, and ensuring that there is provision of these services. The CCGs are overseen by NHS England, formally known as the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB) which was established on 1 October 2012 as an executive non-departmental public body. NHS England also has the responsibility for commissioning primary care services - General Practitioners, opticians and NHS dentistry, as well as some specialised hospital services. Services commissioned include general practice physician services (most of whom are private businesses working under contract to the NHS), community nursing, local clinics and mental health services. Provider trusts are NHS bodies delivering health care service. They are involved in agreeing major capital and other health care spending projects in their region. NHS trusts are care deliverers which spend money allocated to them by CCG's. Secondary care (sometimes termed acute health care) can be either elective care or emergency care and providers may be in the public or private sector. Healthcare in Northern Ireland The biggest part of healthcare in Northern Ireland is provided by Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland. Though this organization does not use the term 'National Health Service', it is still sometimes referred to as the 'NHS'.Hospital warns of 'Third World' NHS BBC News, 30 August 2000 Healthcare in Scotland The majority of healthcare in Scotland is provided by NHS Scotland; Scotland's current national system of publicly funded healthcare was created in 1948 at the same time as those in Northern Ireland and in England and Wales, incorporating and expanding upon services already provided by local and national authorities as well as private and charitable institutions. It remains a separate body from the other public health systems in the United Kingdom, although this is often not realised by patients when \\"cross-border\\" or emergency care is involved due to the level of co-operation and co-ordination; occasionally becoming apparent in cases where patients are repatriated by the Scottish Ambulance Service to a hospital in their country of residence once essential treatment has been given but they are not yet fit to travel by non-ambulance transport. Public health matters are handled by Public Health Scotland which is sponsored by the Scottish Government and local authorities (through COSLA). Healthcare in Wales The majority of healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales. This body was originally formed as part of the same NHS structure for England and Wales created by the National Health Service Act 1946 but powers over the NHS in Wales came under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969 and, in turn, responsibility for NHS Wales was passed to the Welsh Government under devolution in 1999. Public health matters are handled by Public Health Wales. Comparisons between the healthcare systems in the United Kingdom Differences Telephone advisory services Each NHS system has developed ways of offering access to non-emergency medical advice. People in England and Scotland can access these services by dialling the free-to-call 111 number. Scotland's service is run by NHS24. The telephone number for NHS Direct Wales/Galw Iechyd Cymru is 0845 4647, but this service intends to offer access through the 111 number from some point in 2015. Best practice and cost effectiveness In England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) sets guidelines for medical practitioners as to how various conditions should be treated and whether or not a particular treatment should be funded. These guidelines are established by panels of medical experts who specialise in the area being reviewed. In Scotland, the Scottish Medicines Consortium advises NHS Boards there about all newly licensed medicines and formulations of existing medicines as well as the use of antimicrobiotics but does not assess vaccines, branded generics, non- prescription-only medicines (POMs), blood products and substitutes or diagnostic drugs. Some new drugs are available for prescription more quickly than in the rest of the United Kingdom. At times this has led to complaints.Call for quicker drug decisions BBC News, 10 January 2008 Cost control The National Audit Office reports annually on the summarised consolidated accounts of the NHS, and Audit Scotland performs the same function for NHS Scotland. Since January 2007, the NHS have been able to claim back the cost of treatment, and for ambulance services, for those who have been paid personal injury compensation. Parking charges Parking charges at hospitals have been abolished in Scotland (except at three PFI hospitals) and have also been abolished in Wales. Parking charges continue to be in place at many hospitals in England, however, since April 2020, disabled people, frequent outpatient attenders, parents of sick children staying overnight and staff working night shifts have had access to free parking. Prescribed drugs In a sample of 13 developed countries, the UK was 9th in its population-weighted usage of medication in 14 classes in both 2009 and 2013. The drugs studied were selected on the basis that the conditions treated had high incidence, prevalence and/or mortality, caused significant long-term morbidity and incurred high levels of expenditure and significant developments in prevention or treatment had been made in the last 10 years. The study noted considerable difficulties in cross border comparison of medication use. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales no longer have Prescription charges. However, in England, a prescription charge of £9.00 is payable per item , though patients under 16 years old (16–18 years if still in full-time education) or over 60 years getting prescribed drugs are exempt from paying as are people with certain medical conditions, those on low incomes or in receipt of certain benefits, and those prescribed drugs for contraception. UK permanent residents in England do not pay the real cost of the medicines and so for some prescribed medicines that can be bought over the counter without a prescription, for example aspirin, it can be much cheaper to purchase these without a prescription. UK permanent residents in England who must pay can (instead of paying for each medical item individually) purchase a three-month Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC) costing £29.10. This saves the patient money where the patient needs three or more items in three months. There is also a 12-month PPC certificate costing £104.00 which saves patient's money if 12 or more items are needed in 12 months. There are no prescription charges anywhere in the UK for medicines administered at a hospital, by a doctor or at an NHS walk-in centre. Role of private sector in public healthcare From the birth of the NHS in 1948, private medicine has continued to exist, paid for partly by private insurance. Provision of private healthcare acquired by means of private health insurance, funded as part of an employer funded healthcare scheme or paid directly by the customer, though provision can be restricted for those with conditions such as AIDS/HIV.BUPA exclusions bupa.co.uk, accessed 23 February 2009 In recent years, despite some evidence that a large proportion of the public oppose such involvement, the private sector has been used to increase NHS capacity. In addition, there is some relatively minor sector crossover between public and private provision with it possible for some NHS patients to be treated in private healthcare facilitiesPrivate hospital serving NHS patients http://www.spirehealthcare.com/Washington/NHS-Services-at-Spire-Washington- Hospital/ and some NHS facilities let out to the private sector for privately funded treatments or for pre- and post-operative care.NHS units offering services to paying private patients http://www.privatehealth.co.uk/private- hospitals/nhs/ However, since private hospitals tend to manage only routine operations and lack a level 3 critical care unit (or intensive therapy unit), unexpected emergencies may lead to the patient being transferred to an NHS hospital.What if surgery goes wrong?

Funding and performance of healthcare since devolution In January 2010 the Nuffield Trust published a comparative study of NHS performance in England and the devolved administrations since devolution, concluding that while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have had higher levels of funding per capita than England, with the latter having fewer doctors, nurses and managers per head of population, the English NHS is making better use of the resources by delivering relatively higher levels of activity, crude productivity of its staff, and lower waiting times. However, the Nuffield Trust quickly issued a clarifying statement in which they admitted that the figures they used to make comparisons between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom were inaccurate due to the figure for medical staff in Scotland being overestimated by 27 per cent.Nuffield Trust statement scotland.gov.uk, 20 January 2010 Using revised figures for medical staffing, Scotland's ranking relative to the other devolved nations on crude productivity for medical staff changes, but there is no change relative to England. The Nuffield Trust study was comprehensively criticised by the BMA which concluded \\"whilst the paper raises issues which are genuinely worth debating in the context of devolution, these issues do not tell the full story, nor are they unambiguously to the disadvantage of the devolved countries. The emphasis on policies which have been prioritised in England such as maximum waiting times will tend to reflect badly on countries which have prioritised spending increases in other areas including non-health ones.\\" In April 2014 the Nuffield Trust produced a further comparative report \\"The four health systems of the UK: How do they compare?\\" which concluded that despite the widely publicised policy differences there was little sign that any one country was moving ahead of the others consistently across the available indicators of performance. It also complained that there was an increasingly limited set of comparable data on the four health systems of the UK which made comparison difficult. In February 2016 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published a review which concluded that performance of the NHS in Wales was little different from that in the rest of the UK. They described performance across the UK as \\"fairly mediocre\\" saying that great policies were not being translated into great practices. They suggested that GPs should be more involved in health boards and that resources should be shifted out of hospitals.

The Chelsea Waterworks Company was a London waterworks company founded in 1723 which supplied water to many central London locations throughout the 18th and 19th centuries until its functions were taken over by the Metropolitan Water Board in 1902. The company was established \\"for the better supplying the City and Liberties of Westminster and parts adjacent with water\\" The London Encyclopaedia, Ben Weinreb & Christopher Hibbert, Macmillan, 1995, and received a Royal Charter on 8 March 1723.Royal Charters, Privy Council website The company created extensive ponds in the area bordering Chelsea and Pimlico using water from the tidal Thames. These were to form the basis of the Grosvenor Canal which was opened to traffic in 1825. By the 19th century there were complaints about the quality of the water they were drawing from the River Thames, and in 1829, under engineer James Simpson the company became the first in the country to install a slow sand filtration system to purify the water.History of the Chelsea Waterworks The Metropolis Water Act of 1852 prohibited the extraction of water for household purposes from the River Thames below Teddington Lock. The company moved to Seething Wells above the lock at Surbiton in 1856 becoming the last water company to move their inlets above the polluted tidal water zone. The site was adjacent to the Lambeth Waterworks Company, who had already moved there and who also employed Simpson. The vacated site at Pimlico was used by the railway companies to build lines into west London and London Victoria Station was built on the site of much of the Grosvenor Canal basin. The inlets at Seething Wells sucked up too much mud with the water because of turbulence caused by the River Mole, River Ember and The Rythe. The Chelsea Waterworks Company attempted to build works opposite Hampton Court but followed the Lambeth Waterworks Company to a new installation at Molesey in 1875 where the Molesey Reservoirs were built.A Guide to the Industrial Archaeology of the Borough of Elmbridge Both companies were incorporated into the Metropolitan Water Board in 1902.

An FSMD is a digital system composed of a finite-state machine, which controls the program flow, and a datapath, which performs data processing operations. FSMDs are essentially sequential programs in which statements have been scheduled into states, thus resulting in more complex state diagrams. Here, a program is converted into a complex state diagram in which states and arcs may include arithmetic expressions, and those expressions may use external inputs and outputs as well as variables. FSMs do not use variables or arithmetic operations/conditions, thus FSMDs are more powerful than FSMs. The FSMD level of abstraction is often referred to as the register-transfer level.

It has a circumpolar distribution in the northern hemisphere, native to temperate and boreal North America and Eurasia, where it grows in wet and moist habitats, including ponds and streambanks. Description Ranunculus sceleratus is an annual herb growing up to half a meter tall. The leaves are more or less glabrous (hairless) and have small blades each deeply lobed or divided into three leaflets. They are borne on long petioles. The flowers are 5-10mm across with five or fewer yellow petals a few millimeters long and reflexed sepals. The fruit is an achene borne in a cluster of several. While buttercups are toxic due to the presence of the substance protoanemonin, this applies in particular for the cursed buttercup: it is the most toxic buttercup and contains 2.5% protoanemonin. When the leaves are wrinkled, damaged or crushed, they bring out unsightly sores and blisters on human skin. Distribution Ranunculus sceleratus has a circumpolar distribution in the northern hemisphere There are two varieties and one subspecies with distinctive distributions: R. sceleratus ssp. reptabundus occurs in northern Finland and north-west Russia.

During the year 1977, the bridge partly collapsed due to strong currents of the river, and has never been repaired. The bridge spans across the Adyar estuary, bordering the backend of the Theosophical Society. It was built to facilitate the movement of fishermen from Santhome beach to Elliot's beach over the mouth of the Adyar river. The broken bridge that once helped the fishermen in their livelihood and topped the list of popular shooting locations has now become a bachelor hangout. The vantage point view from the bridge The Bridge has become a popular spot to view the sunrise and has been attracting youth. The area is generally considered unsafe after dark due to lack of lighting and road access. However, this place is one of the few places from where the untampered beauty of Chennai can be relished. History Sunset view from the bridge The bridge was built in 1967. It cuts across the Adyar River mouth to connect the fishermen hamlets on the Adyar side to that of Srinivasapuram on the other side. Fishermen who worked at the harbour would then take their tricycles and rickshaws across the bridge. The narrow bridge had also facilitated movement of four wheelers, but only one vehicle at a time. Fisherfolks harvested fish here when the river was unpolluted. They were prosperous. Prawns and crab were in abundance as they used to breed in the river mouth. Worms used for fishing were also available then near the banks of the river. After the bridge collapsed during 1977, people had to go around the city to reach harbour for work. The utility of the bridge would have gone but the charm remained. It continued to be a sought- after shooting location. In popular culture The bridge overseeing the Adyar estuary has always been a place of scenic beauty. And it was for this reason that it turned out to be a popular shooting spot. Many stars of the tamil film industry come here for a shoot; the list includes MGR, Ajith, Vijay, Suriya and R. Madhavan. The bridge has featured in films like Vaali and Aaytha Ezhuthu.

He studied for the secular priesthood, but after ordination entered the Society of Jesus, 28 September 1696. For four years he was professor of philosophy at Briggs and Dillingen. He was then advanced to the chair of philosophy, controversial and scholastic, at Augsburg. He acquired fame in the field of canon law, which he taught for nineteen years at Dillingen, and at Ingolstadt, where he was the successor of Francis Xavier Schmalzgrueber. His last appointment was as prefect of higher studies at Munich. Works His first important literary works were \\"Lutheranismus constanter errans\\" (1709); \\"Una et vera fides\\" (1710); and \\"Theologia polemica particularis\\" (1711). In his \\"Cursus theologiæ polemicæ universæ\\" (1713), Pichler devotes the first part to the fundamentals of polemical theology and the second part to the particular errors of the reformers. It is said that he is the first writer to lay down, clearly and separately, the distinction between fundamental theology and other divisions of the science. He also wrote an important work on papal infallibility, \\"Papatus nunquan errans in proponendis fidei articulis\\" (1709). Although renowned as a polemical theologian, Pichler is better known as a canonist. He published his \\"Candidatus juris prudentiæ sacræ\\" in 1722; this was followed by \\"Summa jurisprudentiæ sacræ universæ\\" in 1723 sqq. He also issued \\"Manipulus casuum jiridicorum\\" and several epitomes of his larger canonical treatises. Pichler's controversial works were in great vogue during the eighteenth century, while his books on canon law were used as textbooks in many universities. His solutions to difficult cases in jurisprudence gave a decided impetus to the study of the canons and afforded a key to the intricate portions of the \\"Corpus juris canonici\\". Fourteen of Pichler's works, excluding the many editions and alterations, are enumerated.

It is native to Macaronesia, temperate Eurasia and north and northeast Africa, and was introduced to North America in the eighteenth century, where it has since become naturalized, particularly of the deserts and arid grasslands of the southwestern United States.  Distribution and ecology  The plant is widespread across North America. The plant grows as an annual in the northern half of North America. In the southern areas of North America, the plant tends to grow as a biennial with a more erect habit and with much larger leaves, flowers, and fruits. It flowers from May until August. Common stork's-bill can be found in bare, sandy, grassy places both inland and around the coasts. It is a food plant for the larvae of the brown argus butterfly. The seeds of this annual are a species collected by various species of harvester ants.  Description  It is a hairy, sticky annual. The stems bear bright pink flowers, which often have dark spots on the bases. The flowers are arranged in a loose cluster and have ten filaments – five of which are fertile – and five styles. The leaves are pinnate to pinnate-pinnatifid, and the long seed-pod, shaped like the bill of a stork, bursts open in a spiral when ripe, sending the seeds (which have long tail called awns) into the air.  Seed dispersal behavior  Erodium cicutarium seed uses self-dispersal mechanisms to spread away from the maternal plant and also to reach good germination site to increase fitness. Two techniques that Erodium uses are explosive dispersal which launch seeds by storing elastic energy, and self- burial dispersal where Erodium seeds move themselves across the soil using hygroscopically powered shape change.  Explosive dispersal  After flowering, the five pericarps on the fruits of Erodium, and the awns, which are hair like appendages of pericarps, joined together and grow into a spine shape. As the fruits dry, dehydration create tension, and elastic energy develops within the awns. The shape of the awns change from straight to helical, causing them to explosively separate the seeds away from the maternal plants. During dispersal, mechanical energy stored in specialized tissues is transferred to the seeds to increase their kinetic and potential energy. The energy storage capacity of the seeds is determined by the level of hydration, suggesting a role of turgor pressure in the explosive dispersal mechanism.  Self-burial dispersal  The awn of each seed, once on the ground, responds to humidity of the environment and changes its shape accordingly. The awn coils under dehydration and uncoils when wet. This results in motor action of the seed, which, combined with hairs on the seed and along the length of the awns, moves the seed across the surface, eventually positioning them into a crevice and creating a drilling action that forces the seed into the ground. The coil and uncoil of the awns are achieved by the hygroscopic tissue in the active layer on the awns. Hygroscopic movement happens with respond to a change in the water content of dead plant tissue, specially in the cell wall. Water absorbed by the cell wall binds to the matrix of the awns, causing it to expand and to drive the cellulose microfibrils apart, which causes the matrix to uncoil, thus straightening the awns. Inversely, the matrix will contract under dehydration, leading to the coil of the awns. Erodium Cicutarium seed uncoiling as it absorbs moisture (real-time) Erodium cicutarium seed drills itself into the soil (time-lapse) Research found no correlation between weight of the awned fruits and the dispersal distance. E.cicutarium with larger seeds have a longer coil and uncoil time compare to smaller seeds. In the field, the rate of seed burial declined throughout the season. The larger seeds buried themselves more often than the smaller seeds. However, larger seeds have a harder time finding a large enough space for the seeds to be buried. Conversely, smaller seeds have an easier time finding a hole and drilling themselves in, and thus are more likely to be buried.  Advantages  The advantages of explosive dispersal and self-burial dispersal are to get mature seeds of E.cicutarium quickly to the ground during the most favorable period for burial by hygroscopic mechanisms, thus increase fitness.  Uses  The entire plant is edible with a flavor similar to sharp parsley if picked young. According to John Lovell's Honey Plants of North America (1926), \\"the pink flowers are a valuable source of honey (nectar), and also furnish much pollen\\". Among the Zuni people, a poultice of chewed root is applied to sores and rashes and an infusion of the root is taken for stomachache.

Most of the outer islands of Seychelles are Government owned and managed by the parastal company Islands Development Company (IDC). In 2007, ICS signed an agreement with IDC for conservation management on these islands. ICS now employs full-time scientists and rangers at conservation centres on four IDC islands, Silhouette Island, Alphonse Atoll, Desroches Island and Farquhar Atoll. ICS has also managed Aride Island Nature Reserve since October 2003. Aride was previously owned and managed by the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts (RSWT) of UK. In October 2003, the reserve was leased to ICS and a series of conservation targets were set by RSWT. In 2006, upon satisfactory completion of all targets, the island was transferred to a UK Registered Charity, Island Conservation Society UK with management delegated to ICS. In 2005-2009, ICS implemented a major project funded by Fonds Français pour l’Environnement Mondial (French Global Environment Facility). The project focused on the restoration of five islands. Achievements include the eradication of rats on North Island, Seychelles, Conception Island and major islands of Cosmoledo Atoll, together with the transfer of several rare and threatened species to create new populations.

PC12 is a cell line derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla, that have an embryonic origin from the neural crest that has a mixture of neuroblastic cells and eosinophilic cells. Background This cell line was first cultured by Greene and Tischler in 1976. It was developed in parallel to the adrenal chromaffin cell model because of its extreme versatility for pharmacological manipulation, ease of culture, and the large amount of information on their proliferation and differentiation. These qualities provide advantage even though they have smaller vesicles and quantal size, holding only an average of 1.9x10−19 moles of neurotransmitter released. The vesicles hold catecholamines, mostly dopamine but also limited amount of norepinephrine, and release of these neurotransmitters give rise to spikes due to changes in current similar to chromaffin cells. PC12 cell line use has given much information to the function of proteins underlying vesicle fusion. This cell line has been used to understand the role of synaptotagmin in vesicle-cell membrane fusion. Differentiation Their embryological origin with neuroblastic cells means they can easily differentiate into neuron-like cells even though they are not considered adult neurons. Neuron-like means they share properties similar to neurons, in this case it is referring to releasing neurotransmitter by vesicles. PC12 cells stop dividing and terminally differentiate when treated with nerve growth factor or dexamethasone.Center for Cancer Education This makes PC12 cells useful as a model system for neuronal differentiation and neurosecretion. Nerve Growth Factor Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor creates cells with long processes known as neurite varicosities, which contain small amounts of vesicles. PC12 cells treated for 10–14 days with nerve growth factor had no release of vesicles from the cell body which indicates the aggregation of vesicles in the ends of the neurites. Dexamethasone Treatment of PC12 cells with dexamethasone differentiates them into chromaffin-like cells. Using patch clamp recording and amperometry there was a significant increase in quantal size, excitability and coupling between calcium channels and vesicle release sites, increasing from ~2x10−19 to ~6.5x10−19 moles. Drugs effects on vesicles Research has shown differences in vesicle size and quantal size depending on treatment with certain drugs. * L-DOPA has shown increase in average quantal size when treated for only 40–90 minutes. * Treatment with amphetamine or reserpine causes a reduction in vesicle content. * Inserting the heavy metals Lead(II), Cadmium(II), Strontium(II), or Barium(II) have been shown to have agonist to the calcium-sensor synaptotagmin. * Other organics have been studied using this cell line to understand their effects on PC12 cells These types of studies show that use of PC12 cell line can be a model for past and future neurotoxicological studieshttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acschemneuro.7b00473. Research The PC12 cell line has been used to get more information about diseases of the brain. It has been used in research of hypoxia, where acute hypoxia induces exocytosis and prolonged hypoxia can induce excessive exocytosis. PC12 cells were used to find which prion protein fragments caused neuronal dysfunction.

History The house is first mentioned in 1796 when it belonged to John Wigston of Trent Park. Later that year it was let to the Imperial Ambassador of the German Empire. The house was valued at £6,300 by 1828, when Robert Mushet of the Royal Mint died there. The house was sold in 1849 to the Strand Union Guardians for a school for London workhouse children, and over the next 40 years several extensions were made to the house which by 1897 housed 400 children. The school was partly self- sufficient complete with two meadows, cultivated land and a herd of cows and some pigs. The children were taught trades; the boys, tailoring, shoe making and carpentry; the girls, housework, needlework and laundering. In 1913 the school closed and by the beginning of World War I housed Belgian refugees. The house was converted into the St Davids Hospital for epileptics in 1915 by the Metropolitan Asylums Board By 1971 the house was acquired by the London Borough of Enfield, who renovated and demolished some of the work house buildings, although a lodge and outbuildings from that period remain as well as an early 20th-century lodge. The house was re-opened as an arts Centre in 1979 and includes the Millfield Theatre. Weir Hall library was on site until December 2008 but has since been relocated to Fore Street, Edmonton. The space has now been redeveloped as a cafe bar and performance space. In the gardens one of the few remaining communal air-raid shelters in Enfield can be found (which can be visited). The gardens are open to the public and can be reached by following the Pymmes Brook Trail (the brook flows through the garden) from Pymmes Park.Millfiels House on the Parks & Gardens website Adjacent to the garden is the St David's play area.History of Millfield House Retrieved 14 March 2008 There is also a small library. Millfield House Library on the Enfield website Millfield House Gardens  Programme  The arts centre plays host to comedy, musical, drama, dance, children's and music shows throughout the year. Most shows at the theatre are professional shows which the management bring in for a fee, or a split of the ticket sales. When hired, the venue offers the ability to sell tickets through its own box office, subject to a commission. At Millfield House several classes take place for adults, children and young people. Including pilates, chess, youth theatre, drama, manga, dance and art Club. The house underwent extensive refurbishment in 2010/11. In addition the theatre stages an annual traditional pantomime.

It is about more than starting an individual business. Inclusive entrepreneurship can be applied to self-employment, starting or growing micro or small enterprises and to social enterprise using business based approaches driven by social mission. Indeed, the personal qualities required for entrepreneurship are essential for success in the knowledge economy – whether this be in the private or public sectors. The use of the word 'inclusive' indicates a belief that entrepreneurship is for all and that the personal qualities and conditions required for entrepreneurship are not the prerogative of a privileged, highly educated few. Indeed, millions of people across the globe take complex decisions, manage risk, find new innovative solutions, and collaborate with others just to survive in their daily lives. However the obstacles and risk they face when trying to make the leap from survival to long-term sustainability are proportionally far greater than those involved in launching a new company on the stock exchange. Inclusive entrepreneurship is about supporting entrepreneurs from all backgrounds by creating a genuinely level playing field. This involves understanding and then overcoming the barriers faced by different people in different places. It is about unleashing the creative potential that people have within them and using this to create a more sustainable future for all of us. EU community of practice Major progress on inclusive entrepreneurship has been made through the EU's EQUAL Community Initiative which included a theme on business creation that was taken up in approximately half the EU Member States. This action research has led to the development of a community of practice on inclusive entrepreneurship called COPIE. COPIE was led by Flanders and Germany with partners in Spain, Portugal, and the UK and observers in France, the Netherlands, Ireland, the Czech Republic and Romania. COPIE developed a series of tools to facilitate the assessment of enterprise support systems from the point of view of a wide range of specific groups (e.g. women, minority ethnic groups, migrants, people with disabilities, young people and older people). Much of its learning has been capitalised on a wiki at http://www.wikipreneurship.eu. Following the end of EQUAL, COPIE 2, a learning network under the Learning for Change programme, has been established. Again led by Germany, it includes Flanders, Wallonia, the Czech Republic, Spain, Andalucía and Lithuania. It has working groups on: * policy co-ordination * access to finance * entrepreneurship education * coaching and mentoring * quality management and inclusive business support * a European diagnostic & benchmarking tool Syracuse University project Inclusive Entrepreneurship is also the name of a project which evolved from the Start-Up NY Pilot Project funded by Office of Disability Employment Policy by DOL in Onondaga County, Syracuse University. It defines inclusive entrepreneurship as: :“A strategy and process for assisting people with diverse disabilities and/or economic and social disadvantages to become entrepreneurs through business planning training, use of customized business development goal and support planning, and access to financial resources utilizing the resources of diverse public and private partners working within a consensus-driven, collaborative framework”. :(Definition courtesy of Gary Shaheen from BBI and Mirza Tihic from Whitman School of Management (Syracuse University)) Inclusive Entrepreneurship utilizes practices and partnerships developed through the three year (2006-2009) US Department of Labor/Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP)-funded “Start-Up NY” program and the five year (2009-2014) Small Business Association’s Program for Investment in Micro- entrepreneurs (SBA-PRIME). Start-Up NY brought a personal multidisciplinary team consisting of business consultants, disability experts, benefits counselors, mentors, and any identified peer and family supports together with the participant to merge their knowledge and resources, and provide a customized micro-enterprise training, assistance, and counseling resource. Inclusive Entrepreneurship is led by Syracuse University and its Whitman School of Management/Department of Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises (EEE) together with the Burton Blatt Institute (BBI). However, it is important to note that the success of Inclusive Entrepreneurship as a university and community-based initiative is also based upon the development of key partnerships that are necessary to helping entrepreneurs develop their businesses. These can include the local Small Business Development Center (SBDC) and One Stop Career Center as well as key local stakeholders that work with low-income individuals, including low-income people with disabilities, to help them achieve economic self-sufficiency. Why is Inclusive Entrepreneurship Important? Inclusive entrepreneurship goes beyond business ownership. It benefits everyone by fostering a fundamental understating of business, community stakeholders, community collaboration, benefits, and the skills and confidence needed for personal and community success. The participants exposed to inclusive entrepreneurship through Start-Up NY and SBA Prime frequently express that they have more opportunity to exercise creative freedoms, develop higher self-esteem, better financial literacy, and an overall greater sense of control over their own lives. Community partners were able to save time and money by implementing a seamless process of inclusive entrepreneurship.

Louise Kirkby Lunn (8 November 1873 – 17 February 1930) was an English contralto. Sometimes classified as a mezzo-soprano, she was a leading English-born singer of the first two decades of the 20th century, earning praise for her performances in concert, oratorio and opera. Training Kirkby Lunn (pronounced Kirby Lunn) had her early vocal training in her native city of Manchester, at All Saints Church. She sang there in the choir under Dr J. H. Greenwood, the church's organist, and later appeared at concerts in the city.G. Davidson, Opera Biographies (Werner Laurie, London 1955), pp. 172–73 In 1890, she obtained a place at the Royal College of Music in London and studied for three years with Albert Visetti, also training for opera.M. Scott, The Record of Singing I (Duckworth, London 1977), p. 45 Winning a scholarship in her second year, she took the role of Margaret in Schumann's Genoveva in a College production at Drury Lane in December 1893, and then as the Marquise de Montcontour in Delibes' Le roi l'a dit at the Prince of Wales Theatre a year later.Davidson 1955, p. 173 She also studied for some time with Jacques Bouhy in Paris.Scott 1977. Early career In 1895, she appeared in the first season of Promenade concerts for Henry J. Wood.H.J. Wood, My Life of Music (Gollancz, London 1946 edn), pp. 77–78 Augustus Harris gave her a five-year contract almost upon first hearing. In 1896 she appeared as Nora in Stanford's Shamus O'Brien at the Theatre Comique, again under Wood, with Joseph O'Mara, Maggie Davies, W.H. Stevens and Denis O'Sullivan, a production which ran for 100 nights from 2 March.Wood 1946, p. 85 This was followed by a number of small roles at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. However, the Covent Garden contract expired with Harris's death in June 1896, whereupon she joined the Carl Rosa Opera Company, performing as principal mezzo-soprano in London and on tour in the provinces in Carmen, Mignon, Lohengrin, Rigoletto and other works. In 1898, at Queen's Hall in London, she sang as a Rhinemaiden in excerpts from Das Rheingold with Lillian Blauvelt and Helen Jaxon, with David Bispham appearing as Alberich.Wood 1946, p. 121 She remained with the Carl Rosa until 1899, the year in which she married W. J. Pearson. She was particularly active in the 1900–1901 Queen's Hall season with Wood, appearing with Blauvelt, Lloyd Chandos and Daniel Price, and the Wolverhampton Festival Choral Society, in Beethoven's last symphony on 16 March, and in Gilbert and Sullivan excerpts (with Lloyd Chandos and Florence Schmidt).Wood 1946, pp. 149–51 In the midst of a series of Wagner concerts with Marie Brema, Philip Brozel, David Ffrangcon-Davies and Olga Wood, on 22 November 1901 (the first anniversary of the death of Arthur Sullivan), she sang in a special performance of Sullivan's cantata The Golden Legend, with Blauvelt, John Coates and Ffrangcon-Davies.Wood 1946, p. 155 Operatic career From 1901 to 1914, Louise Kirkby Lunn appeared regularly at the Covent Garden, and for several of those years also in the United States, especially at the Metropolitan Opera in the seasons of 1902–03, 1906–08 and 1912–14.A. Eaglefield Hull, A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians (Dent, London 1924); M. Scott, The Record of Singing I (Duckworth, London 1977), pp. 45–46 She was particularly successful in Wagnerian opera parts, especially as Fricka, Brangane, Ortrud and Erda, and in 1904 gave the first English-language performance of the role of Kundry (Parsifal) in America, at Boston. Her American 1902 debut, however, had been as Amneris in Aïda, a role in which she formed a long and famous partnership with the Czech dramatic soprano Emmy Destinn as Aïda.G. Davidson, Opera Biographies (Werner Laurie, London 1955), pp. 172–74 (This partnership is preserved on record, not only in a 1911-recorded 'Ebben qual nuovo fremito' from Verdi's work, but also in a 1911 'L'amo come il fulgor', from Ponchielli's La Gioconda.HMV Italian, 2-054020 and 2-054023 (both 1911); Bennett 1967, pp. 76–77) Both in England and America, she was also a famous Dalila in the opera by Saint-Saëns. She sang, too, in the Covent Garden premieres of Saint-Saëns' Helene and Massenet's Hérodiade, Gluck's Armide and Tchaikowsky's Eugene Onegin.See also H. Rosenthal and J. Warrack, Concise Dictionary of Opera (London 1974 edn). Gluck's Orfeo, which she first delivered in 1905, was considered one of her best parts, and her showpiece aria, 'Che faro?', was committed to disc.HMV Italian 2-053121, c1915; Bennett 1967. Oratorio and concert work Henry Wood first conducted the Prelude and Angel's farewell from The Dream of Gerontius, with Kirkby Lunn, in February 1901.Lewis Foreman, Elgar's Interpreters on Record IV insert (Elgar Society 2000). In March 1904, she was a principal soloist in the Elgar Festival concerts given at Covent Garden, appearing on the first night with John Coates and Ffrangcon-Davies in Gerontius, and on the second with them and with Agnes Nicholls, Kennerley Rumford (the husband of Clara Butt) and Andrew Black in The Apostles.Percy M. Young, Letters of Edward Elgar (Geoffrey Bles, London 1955), pp. 131–32 In this way she effectively replaced Marie Brema, the original choice for the Gerontius angel. Two years later she performed it with the same colleagues (but for Henry Wood) in Leeds.Wood 1946, p. 205 She sang it under Hans Richter at Birmingham in 1909 with John Coates and Frederic Austin; The Athenaeum remarked, 'each, in turn, brought to it an accession of glory.'M. Lee-Browne, Nothing so charming as Musick! (Thames, London 1999), p. 38 Wood greatly admired her, and employed her frequently, choosing her for a Sheffield Festival presentation of a suite from Rimsky-Korsakov's opera Christmas Eve, with Francis Hurford, in 1908.Wood 1946, p. 213 In 1909, Kirkby Lunn performed the Sea Pictures songs under Elgar's baton at the Royal Philharmonic Society concerts. On that occasion she was awarded the Gold Medal of the Society, when the Honorary Secretary, composer and pianist Francesco Berger, referred to her 'rare combination of personal artistic achievement added to a richly endowed nature.'R. Elkin, Royal Philharmonic (Rider, London 1946), pp. 103, 135 She made two further appearances before the society before the war, on the opening nights (November) of the 1913 and 1914 seasons. At the former she sang the scena from Wagner's Rienzi, 'Gerechter Gott!', for Willem Mengelberg, and on the second occasion the Ballade La Fiancee du Timbalier by Saint-Saëns, for Thomas Beecham.Elkin 1946, pp. 139–40 She performed the Brahms Alto Rhapsody at Queen's Hall under Henri Verbrugghen in the Festival of April 1915, and she also sang in the Festival of British Music there the following month.R. Elkin, Queen's Hall 1893–1941 (Rider, London 1944), pp. 77–78 In November 1916, she reappeared with the RPO to sing Mozart's 'Non piu di fiori' from La clemenza di Tito.Elkin 1946, p. 144 She made a recording of the Clemenza item.O righteous God, HMV 03440.

Before the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, Kirkby Lunn had been in great demand for oratorio appearances on the European Continent, and she sang frequently as far afield as Budapest. New York also heard her during this period.Eaglefield Hull, 1924. In 1912, she had made a tour of Australia with William Murdoch, the celebrated pianist who had made his London debut two years earlier. Recording activities and final performances In the same year (1912) as her Australian tour, Kirkby Lunn recorded two duets with the famous Covent Garden and Met tenor, John McCormack, from operas composed by Wolf-Ferrari.'T'ieri un giorno ammalato' (I gioielli della Madonna), 2-054040, and 'Il dolce idillio' (Il segreto di Susanna), 2-054041.

The film is an exposé of large- scale fundraising. The Story of Esther Costello was produced by David Miller and Jack Clayton, with Miller directing. The screenplay by Charles Kaufman was based on the 1952 novel by Nicholas Monsarrat. It was distributed by Columbia Pictures.  Plot  With her marriage to womaniser Carlo Landi (Rossano Brazzi) in ashes, wealthy and childless Margaret Landi (Joan Crawford) finds an emotional outlet in patronizing a 15-year-old deaf, dumb, and blind Irish girl named Esther Costello (Heather Sears). Esther's disabilities are the result of a childhood trauma and are psychosomatic rather than physical. As Costello makes progress with Braille and sign language, she is seen as an example of triumph over adversity. Carlo gets wind of Margaret's new life and re-enters the scene. He views Esther as a source of cheap financial gain and arranges a series of exploitative tours for her under a mercenary manager Frank Wenzel (Ron Randell). One day when Margaret is absent from the Landi apartment, Carlo rapes the now 16-year-old Esther. The shock restores the girl's sight and hearing. When Margaret learns of her husband's business duplicities and the rape, she consigns Esther to the care of a priest and a young reporter who loves her (Lee Patterson). Margaret then kills Carlo and herself.  Cast   Production notes  The film is based on a book by Nicholas Monsarrat that nearly had Helen Keller's co-workers suing for libel due to perceived parallels between Helen's story and Esther's. In particular, the book seemed to slur the character of Anne Sullivan's husband, writer- publicist John Macy, who was close to Keller's age. A relationship between John and Keller has long been a subject of speculation. Esther's reporter friend was reminiscent of Keller's highly publicised attempt to elope with reporter-secretary Peter Fagan. The novel focuses mainly on the falsehoods behind large-scale charities and the self-serving natures of those involved. When Esther recovers her sight and hearing, her promoters worry that this will put an end to the Costello Fund. They convince her that the rape was her fault, and that to reveal that she is healed would bring shame and ruin to Margaret. She is actually coached to continue acting as deaf-blind, and does so for about a year; however, in that time she makes several slips (some deliberate). Esther's reporter friend discerns the truth and meets Esther privately, whereupon she tells him everything. He plans to write up the story, then take Esther away and marry her. But as he returns to the newspaper office, word comes to him that Esther has suddenly died. When he confronts Margaret she reveals nothing, and continues the charade. The story can never be printed because it will smear Esther's name and disillusion the people who believe in the charity and its message of hope. The novel closes with Margaret giving an impassioned speech at a convention, as millions of attendees open their wallets. A key support role went to Ron Randell.  Reception   Box office  The film was the 11th most popular movie at the British box office in 1957.  Critical  The New York Times noted, \\"Miss Crawford, Mr. Brazzi, and Mr. Patterson and all the minor players are professional throughout.\\" William K. Zinsser in the New York Herald Tribune wrote, \\"It wouldn't be a Joan Crawford picture without plenty of anguish...And her fans will have their usual good time...this plot enables Miss Crawford to run a full-course dinner of dramatic moods, from loneliness to mother love, from pride in the girl to passion with her husband, and finally to smouldering rage...Somehow she pulls it off. This may not be your kind of movie but it is many women's kind of movie and our Joan is queen of the art form.\\"  DVD  The Story of Esther Costello was released on DVD by Turner Classics (under license from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment) on 25 November 2014, as part of the \\"Joan Crawford in the 1950s\\" collection.

He was captain of rugby and educated at the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle and is the son of former Gosforth favourite Steve Gustard, who was the club's leading try scorer for several seasons in the late 1970s. He gained Full County Cap honours with Durham County & was selected to captain the England u21 tour to Australia under Manager Jeff Probyn. An extraordinary honour as he was the only player not to be attached to a Premiership Rugby Squad. Gustard was offered a full-time contract by Bob Dwyer to join Leicester Tigers in the summer of 1997 following the England U21 tour, and went on to make his debut against Leinster in the Heineken Cup, which preceded his try scoring league debut against Sale in October 1997. Gustard went on to make 97 competitive appearances for the Tigers, including being a used replacement in the famous Heineken Cup final versus Stade Français, and being part of the squad where they won 4 Premiership titles in his 5 years at the club. He left in 2002 to join London Irish, and went on to make 98 appearances in 4 years for the Exiles, including a spell as the first team captain before he moved in 2006 to join London rivals Saracens, where he was part of a squad that were two of the club's most successful years competing in 4 semi finals in 6 competitions, including the last minute loss to Munster in the semi final of the Heineken Cup in 2008 under head coach Alan Gaffney. Gustard went on to make 48 appearances for the Men in Black, before incoming head coach Eddie Jones offered him the role as an assistant first team coach. Following Jones departure of the club, Saracens appointed Brendan Venter, the former Springbok centre, as Director of Rugby who made Gustard his defence and forwards coach. Gustard had an injury blighted career, but managed to represent England at all levels and the Barbarians. He was in the England pre World Cup squad in 1999 of 36 before it finally got cut to 30 playing against the US in August 1999. He ultimately never played for the senior side. On 17 December 2015 it was announced that Gustard had been appointed as the England Rugby team's defence coach, supporting the recently appointed team coach, Eddie Jones. Jones noted that \\"He has overseen Saracens' growth as a team, he has produced an aggressive defence system there and we are hoping he can do the same for England.\\" On May 21, 2018 it was announced that he will be the new Head of Rugby at Harlequins ahead of the 2018–19 season.

She was built by Fairfields Govan shipyards on the Clyde and was commissioned on 30 August 1910. The Times (London), Wednesday, 31 August 1910, p.5 She was a coal powered ship and as such was obsolete by the end of the First World War and was scrapped in 1921. Construction and design Scorpion was one of three s ordered from Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company as part of the 1908–1909 shipbuilding programme.. The Beagles were not built to a standard design, with detailed design being left to the builders of individual ships in accordance with a loose specification. The three Fairfield ships were long, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal. Five Yarrow boilers fed direct-drive Parsons steam turbines driving three propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at giving a design speed of . Gun armament consisted of one BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VIII and three QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns. Torpedo armament consisted of two 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. Two spare torpedoes were carried. The ship had a crew of 96 officers and men. Scorpion was laid down at Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company's Govan, Glasgow shipyard on 3 May 1909 and was launched on 19 February 1910. She reached a speed of during sea trials, and was completed in August 1910. Service On commissioning, Scorpion joined the First Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet. The first commander of HMS Scorpion was the then Lieutenant-Commander Andrew Cunningham, who remained in command of the destroyer from January 1911 to January 1918. Early days in Scorpion included the Naval Review of 1911 with twenty-six miles of ships including 42 battleships and 68 destroyers. On 15 November 1911, Scorpion was in collision with the Danish schooner Fyn when the First Flotilla was returning to Harwich after exercises in the English Channel. Scorpion was holed close to her engine room and was towed to port by sister ship , while flooding forced Fyn to be abandoned near the Goodwin Sands. Scorpion was repaired at Chatham Dockyard. In 1912, the destroyers of the Beagle-class transferred to the newly established Third Destroyer Flotilla. In 1913 the period in home waters came to an end with the Beagle-class, including Scorpion, posted to the Mediterranean, forming the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla. First World War Scorpion remained as part of the Fifth Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet at the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. The early part of the war saw her involved in the chase of the German battlecruiser and cruiser . Scorpion was one of eight destroyers deployed by Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge to assist his squadron of Armoured cruisers in stopping the German ships escaping to Austrian waters. When it was realised that Goeben and Breslau were not heading to Austria, Troubridge left these destroyers behind as they did not have sufficient coal left for a high speed pursuit, and set off southwards on the night of 6/7 August 1914 with his four Armoured cruisers. He called off his pursuit later that night because he could not intercept the German squadron until daylight, when Goebens superior speed and armament would give the Germans a significant advantage. On 1 November 1914 she and the destroyer sank the Turkish armed yacht Beyrout in Vourla harbour, in a search for vessels believed to be involved in minelaying operations in the Gulf of Smyrna. In 1915, she took part in the naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign. Initial operations involved escorting minesweepers attempting to clear the minefields in the mouth of the Dardanelles, with Scorpion escorting minesweeping trawlers on the night of 3/4 March 1915. On 4 March, two companies of Royal Marines were landed at Kum Kale and Sedd el Bahr in attempt to ensure that forts and gun batteries damaged in previous naval bombardments were completely demolished. The landings came under heavy fire, and despite gunfire support from ships, including Scorpion, which knocked out a gun battery, the Marines were forced to withdraw without achieving their objectives and were picked up by the supporting ships, with Scorpions cutter picking up 7 men cut off on a beach. In total 23 Marines were killed or missing and 25 wounded.

It is related to the Chrysler 300M, Chrysler Concorde, Chrysler LHS, Chrysler New Yorker, and Eagle Vision which were all built on Chrysler's new \\"cab forward\\" LH platform. The Intrepid was sold in Canada as the Chrysler Intrepid. In the United States, it replaced the Dodge Monaco as Dodge's largest car. With Dodge's introduction to Mexico during that time, it was badged as a Dodge, replacing the Dynasty which had been sold there under the Chrysler brand. Background The Intrepid's design goes back to 1986, when designer Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called Navajo. The design never passed the clay model stage. It was also at this time that the Chrysler Corporation purchased bankrupt Italian sports car manufacturer Lamborghini. The Navajo's exterior design was reworked and became the Lamborghini Portofino, released as a concept at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show. The Portofino was heralded as a design triumph, setting in motion Chrysler's decision to produce a production sedan with the Portofino's revolutionary exterior design, called \\"cab forward\\". The cab forward design was characterized by the long, low slung windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to the corners of the car, creating a much larger passenger cabin than the contemporaries of the time. Design of the chassis began in the late 1980s, after Chrysler had bought American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987. During this time, Chrysler began designing the replacement for the then-new Dodge Dynasty, which was a mid-size car. Initial proposals bore resemblance to the Dynasty, but this design approach was scrapped entirely in 1988 by François Castaing, the former AMC Vice President of product engineering and development. As AMC was purchased by Chrysler, Castaing became new Vice President for Vehicle Engineering for the new company. The acquiring automaker was in desperate need to replicate the AMC and Renault corporate culture where work was conducted in an atmosphere \\"of constant change\\". Castaing organized Chrysler's departments into AMC-style cross-function teams, as well as incorporated the use of simultaneous engineering. Moreover, the new vehicle's design, under Castaing's leadership, began with the Eagle Premier platform. The Premier's longitudinal engine mounting layout was inherited, as was the front suspension geometry, and parts of the braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or rear-wheel drive (designated \\"LH\\" and \\"LX\\" respectively). The chassis design was continually refined throughout the following years, as it underpinned more Chrysler prototypes: the 1989 Chrysler Millennium and 1990 Eagle Optima.The transmission was inspired by the Premier's Audi and ZF automatics. Borrowing heavily from Chrysler's A604 (41TE) \\"Ultradrive\\" transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE).The initial standard 3.3 L pushrod V6 engine was joined in 1990 with a 3.5 L SOHC engine with four valves per cylinder. For the second generation Intrepid R/T the block was recast in aluminum as part of a comprehensive upgrade. First generation (1993–1997) Rear view The first generation of LH cars debuted at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit as three 1993 models: the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid (badged as a Chrysler in Canada), and the Eagle Vision (also badged as a Chrysler in Europe). The Intrepid was available in two trim levels: base and the sportier, better-equipped ES, which added four-wheel disc brakes, 16\\" wheels with better tires, and stiffer \\"touring\\" suspension damping. All Intrepids received driver and front passenger airbags, a rarity at the time, as well as air conditioning and the four-speed automatic transmission. Anti- lock brakes were optional, as was traction control and the more powerful 3.5 L SOHC engine rated at (214 hp). The Intrepid's launch marked a new image for the Dodge brand, which began to market itself as \\"The New Dodge\\" with a marketing campaign featuring actor Edward Herrmann, who would go on to serve as the brand's spokesperson for the rest of the decade. Changes were few over the Intrepid's initial five-year production. A new variable-assist power steering rack replaced the original for 1994, allowing for easier parking while maintaining a firmer feel at speed. The touring suspension tuning was also made standard equipment in the base model this year. Anti-lock brakes were made standard in the ES in 1995, and in 1996 a new manual shift function for the automatic transmission, called Autostick, was inherited from the Eagle Vision TSi: the first transmission of its kind available in a mainstream car. In addition, Chrysler updated the Dodge Intrepid for the 1995 model year, adding the previous Dodge Ram logo, which was used from 1994-2009. Each exterior treatment uses a hoodline and chrome accented daytime running lights with body colored accents. The Intrepid was often compared with the Chevrolet Lumina and Ford Taurus, and to a lesser extent, the Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, and Honda Accord. Intrepids were built at American Motors' Brampton Assembly facility, originally established to manufacture the Eagle Premier, in Brampton, Ontario, Canada; and at the Chrysler plant at Newark, Delaware. Engines *3.3 L OHV V6 *3.5 L SOHC V6 Second generation (1998–2004) Rear view Chrysler Intrepid (Canada) The LH cars were redesigned for the 1998 model year, with the 1998 Intrepid being designed by Robert Boniface and taking 31 months from design freeze to commencement. The engines were replaced by two new all-aluminum units: a DOHC 2.7 L ( 2736 cc), V6 for base models, and a SOHC 3.2 L (3231 cc), V6 for the ES. A new, top-of-the-line R/T model was added in 1999, the centerpiece of which was a redesigned version of the 3.5 L (3518 cc) V6, now producing and for the ES. At the same time the 3.2 L was reduced to an option in the ES. The Intrepid was completely redesigned for the 1998 model year, arriving in showrooms during late 1997. Body shells were designed to be stronger and stiffer, as well as incorporating double-shear suspension mounts and integrated side impact protection. * MY1999: Minor changes to interior panels. The Chrysler Sentry Key theft-deterrent system disabled the ignition unless the proper key was used to start the engine. * MY2000: New variable-assist steering, and an optional 4-disc in-dash CD changer. * MY2002: The 3.2L engine was discontinued, and new wheel covers became available. the R/T received an extra from PCM programming changes which allowed it to have on 89-octane fuel. This was also the year when DaimlerChrysler began cost-cutting that led to the deletion of various features from the Intrepid. Most notable were the deletion of the illuminated headlight switch, illuminated traction control switch, illuminated lock and window switches, door courtesy lights (replaced with red reflectors), illuminated ashtray receptacle, trunk lid liner, armrest power outlet, door emblems, driver's seat map pocket, and the blacked-out front fascia paint scheme. Cost-cutting was one of the reasons why sales of the Intrepid started to slump. * MY2003: No major changes were made except the optional 4-disc in- dash CD changer was replaced with the optional 6-disc in-dash CD changer. The R/T was discontinued in 2003, but a new SXT model kept the 3.5 L High Output engine with an increase to a rating. The SXT moniker was eventually used across the Dodge product line as a trim level. The Intrepid SXT was basically a base model Intrepid SE with the 3.5 H.O. engine taken from the R/T, with some \\"sportier\\" features such as a sunroof and spoiler. It was a value trim model actually classified as an ES (SXT), but had less features than the ES did with a more powerful engine. * MY2004: Popularity of the Intrepid waned over its 12-year lifespan. The cab-forward design, revolutionary in 1993, had become ubiquitous, culminating in the Intrepid's cancellation. All Intrepids were built at AMC's former assembly plant, originally used to manufacture the Eagle Premier, in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. They were replaced by the new rear wheel drive LX vehicles; the 2005 Dodge Magnum and 2006 Dodge Charger. The last Intrepid rolled off the assembly line on August 30, 2003. Fleet sales 2003 Intrepid police car with the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary The second generation was marketed to the commercial and government markets, particularly the base (1998-2000) and SE (2001-2004) trim levels. An Intrepid Police Package was sold from 2003-2004, similar to the earlier rear-wheel drive Chevrolet Caprice or Ford Crown Victoria. These packages had distinctive styling differences (such as small hub caps) and additional wiring to support strobes and flashers in the trunk compartment and in the front by the grill. The 3.5 V6 found in the R/T & SXT was standard in the police package. These packages and some non-police (non-commercial) packages featured plastic front- end intake vents that routed air onto the rotors for additional cooling and stopping power.

In 2001, the Intrepid made its debut on the NASCAR circuit, signifying the return of Dodge to NASCAR competition after an 18-year hiatus. Drivers in the initial Dodge campaign included Bill Elliott, Kasey Kahne, Jason Leffler, Ward Burton, Sterling Marlin, John Andretti, Casey Mears, Jamie McMurray, Buckshot Jones, Kyle Petty, Stacy Compton, Dave Blaney, Jeremy Mayfield, and Casey Atwood. Marlin was the first to win in a Dodge, giving the marque its first victory since Neil Bonnett's 1977 win at Ontario. The Intrepid continued in NASCAR until 2005 when Dodge switched to the Charger. Hybrid electric concepts In the late 1990s, Chrysler used the Intrepid as a research platform for a hybrid electric vehicle in a diesel-electric configuration. Three variations were built, the Intrepid ESX, ESX II, and ESX III. The first vehicle was built in a series hybrid configuration, while the next two were considered mild hybrids. These were attempted in the time frame of 1997 to 1998. The ESX design team set a high goal of making the vehicle capable of sipping gasoline at the rate of , but the eventual vehicle only achieved an estimated . The figure was impressive for such a vehicle. However, the car used a number of exotic materials, which made the cost excessive if it were ever to go into full-scale production. It was estimated that the car would cost $80,000, or roughly $60,000 more than a regular Intrepid. Part of this price increase was caused by the use of lead-acid batteries. The ESX II team set a somewhat more modest goal of . The vehicle was made much lighter than normal by using an aluminum frame and carbon fiber composite material. This version only cost around $37,000, or about $15,000 more than a standard Intrepid. This version used nickel metal hydride batteries. The third vehicle, the ESX III, had a target mileage of . It used less expensive materials, such as injection-molded thermoplastic instead of carbon fiber. The estimated cost was only about $7,500 more than a standard vehicle, which would give a total somewhere around $30,000. The ESX III used lithium ion batteries.

The second-generation Intrepid again made the list for 1998 and 1999. Both generations won Consumer Guide's \\"Best Buy\\" award. Oil sludge Some second-generation 2.7 L V6 engines have suffered from failures due to oil sludge contamination. In February 2009, five separate class action lawsuits related to the alleged oil sludge defect were consolidated to the District of New Jersey. These problems happen when fine engine oil passages become clogged with sludge, and often result in catastrophic failure of the engine. An unknown number of Intrepid owners have been affected. Fixes include changing to synthetic oil, inspection, and even engine replacement. During the Chrysler bankruptcy proceedings, there was concern among consumer advocate groups that Chrysler's proposed \\"free and clear\\" sale of assets to \\"New Chrysler\\" would allow the automaker to avoid liability for the oil sludge defect.

Career Gibbs, a left back, began his career at Norwich City as a youngster, followed by an apprenticeship at Scunthorpe United. On not making the grade as a pro, he drifted into local football, playing for Gorleston and later scoring the winner from the penalty spot in the 1994 FA Vase Final at Wembley for Diss Town against Taunton Town. He later played in Norway and had brief trial spell at Luton Town, before joining Colchester United on 6 March 1995. After 53 league games, in which he scored three goals, and only shortly after appearing at Wembley for a second time in the Auto-Windscreens Trophy final defeat at the hands of Carlisle United, he was given a free transfer, joining Torquay United on 26 July 1997. His Torquay debut came on the first day of the 1997–98 season, a 2–1 defeat away to newly promoted Conference champions Macclesfield Town. That season saw Gibbs score seven goals in 41 league games en route to the Division Three play-offs and ultimately defeat in the final at Wembley against Colchester. In just that one season his wing-back partnership with Andy Gurney resulted in 16 goals between the two of them. Gibbs followed departing Torquay manager Kevin Hodges to Plymouth Argyle on 26 July 1998 thanks to the Bosman ruling, though his then girlfriend Helen Chamberlain of Sky Sports' Soccer AM fame refused to follow suit and stayed loyal to the Gulls. His Plymouth career started successfully enough, being named in the Division Three team for the 1998–99 season. However, on the final day of the season, Gibbs suffered a broken leg, putting paid to a planned move to Brentford. Incidentally, the same game in which he broke his leg was the famous Jimmy Glass game against Carlisle, in which the goalkeeper scored in the 94th minute to keep Carlisle United in the Football League. Gibbs began playing again for Plymouth's reserves in March 2000. On 9 May 2000, Gibbs was given a free transfer by Plymouth, and on 18 May he signed for Brentford on a three-year contract. However, Brentford's financial situation in March 2002 saw Gibbs transfer listed. On 15 March 2002, Gibbs joined Barnsley on a free transfer. He struggled with injury and in May 2003 underwent a groin operation. On 16 October 2003, Gibbs' contract with Barnsley was terminated. He was linked with Watford, Bradford City and Brentford. The latter of these he trained with during November 2003 and played for their reserves against Aldershot Town. He joined Gravesend & Northfleet later that month, leaving in January 2004. At the end of March 2004, Gibbs joined Canvey Island until the end of the season. On 17 July 2004, Gibbs joined Steve Claridge's Weymouth on a one-year deal, but in January 2005 returned to Gorleston, later assisting with the coaching at the club.  Personal life  After retiring from football, Gibbs set up P&S; Personnel Services, a recruitment agency based in Great Yarmouth.

He also played for the Central District Football Club in the SANFL. He is the older brother of Matthew Westhoff and younger brother of Leigh Westhoff. Westhoff was selected by Port Adelaide in the 2006 draft using their fifth-round pick, being the 71st pick overall.M. Lovett (ed.) (2006). AFL Record Guide To Season 2007, AFL Publishing, Melbourne. p. 448. Early life Justin Westhoff was born in Eudunda, South Australia, where he lived until the age of three. He then moved to Tanunda, South Australia. Justin's younger brother Matthew Westhoff and older brother Leigh Westhoff played for Central Districts in the SANFL league. Matthew played with the Port Adelaide Football Club alongside his brother Justin; he played just six games in his short career with Port and was delisted at the end of the 2011 season. His cousin Nick Westhoff was rookie- listed by Richmond in 2010 but didn't play an AFL game. AFL career 2007 When drafted to the Power, Westhoff's appointed player-mentor was skipper Warren Tredrea.K. Gill, 'Westhoff Walks Tall in High Company', Official Website of the Port Adelaide Football Club, 27 March 2007. Accessed 25 July 2007. On 17 April, Westhoff was controversially suspended for two games for high contact on North Adelaide captain Darryl Wintle during Central District's 7-goal defeat of the Roosters in Round 1 of the SANFL. The suspension effectively prevented him from playing for three weeks, as Central District had a bye during that period.Westhoff in 2007.On 3 June, Westhoff's consistent goalkicking dominance at local level saw him make his AFL debut for Port Adelaide against Hawthorn. He performed strongly on début, booting three goals (including two from his first two kicks) to become the first Power player to register a trio of majors on début. Westhoff was also reported for charging the Hawks' Clinton Young in the last quarter; however, this was later dismissed by the match review panel, as they deemed the contact unintentional and unavoidable.\\"Westhoff charge withdrawn\\", Official Website of the Port Adelaide Football Club, 4 June 2007. Accessed 26 July 2007. Westhoff had his career-best game against the West Coast Eagles in round 15, on 14 July, kicking four goals, including two from contested marks on eventual All- Australian full back Darren Glass. Power coach Mark Williams praised the performance by calling his forward line work 'brilliant'.A. Capel (16 July 2007). 'Port's baby-face of the future', AdelaideNow. Accessed 26 July 2007. Westhoff's performance was further recognised with the AFL rising star nomination for Round 15.'Westhoff wins Rising Star nomination', 17 July 2007, Sydney Morning Herald. Accessed 26 July 2007. He has equalled his personal best 4-goal haul 6 times but never has scored as many points in a game as Round 15, 2007. Westhoff's strong season ended up with him finishing 4th in the 2007 AFL Rising Star competition, garnering a total of 10 votes. He was also recognised with the Gavin Wanganeen Medal and the Best First-Year Player award at the Power's club champion venue. Westhoff played in Port Adelaide's losing AFL grand final side of 2007 at the MCG. His opponent on the day, Matthew Scarlett, had 30 possessions, while Westhoff was unable to have any impact on the game, frequently being pushed off in contests due to his slight stature. This prompted him to bulk up in following years to improve his contested-marking abilities and allowing him to frequently kick bags of goals. Port Adelaide refused to allow him to play in Central Districts' winning Grand Final side the following week, effectively not allowing him to win a premiership with the club where he and his brothers had played all of their junior football. 2008–2009 The 2008 season saw Westhoff play a different role to the 2007 season in which he played more up the ground, unlike the previous season where he played a lot closer to the goals. As a result, Westhoff's goal kicking average saw a decline, only managing 22 goals in 21 games for the season, however this role increased his average of disposals up from 8.9 to 11.3; and marks up from 4.6 to 5.7 a game. On 7 May Westhoff signed a three year contract extension to stay with the Power until the end of the 2011 season. At one stage, Westhoff was also dropped from the Power's lineup in the round 13 game against the Richmond Tigers due to poor form. However, he found his way back into the side the week after, by kicking 3 goals for the Central District. Averaging 2.5 goals a game in the preseason, Westhoff was named in the Power's starting 18 against the Bombers for round 1, where he performed strongly, kicking 3 goals and picking up 15 disposals (including 10 marks). However, in round 2, he fractured his foot and was out for six weeks, being placed on the long-term injury list. He returned in round 11 after a late withdrawal from Robert Gray, and despite not having played any games since the injury, still managed to kick two goals as well as 16 disposals (including 10 marks). He finished the season kicking 20 goals in 13 games. 2010–2011 The 2010 season saw Westhoff play as a ruckman, in a position made vacant by Brendon Lade, who retired. He proved himself to still be a valuable part of the Power's forwardline, dominating in Showdown XXVIII, leading the Power in goalkicking with three goals in the third quarter. His scoring efforts put the game out of reach of the Adelaide Crows. After Round 10, 2010, he was dropped due to a poor performance in the previous game. In the return match of Showdown XXIX, he returned to his form of early in the season with four goals that gave the Power the win. He carried this form into the following week's game against Hawthorn, in which his strong performance earned him a spot in the AFL Team of the Week. In round 4 of 2011, Westhoff won the Showdown Medal.Katrina Gill (16 April 2011). Showstopping Power. afl.com.au 2013–present The 2013 season saw Westhoff play as a Centre half-forward but also drop into defence when required by newly appointed coach Ken Hinkley. He started well and was tipped for a high Brownlow placing after just 4 games, where he played well and saw Port Adelaide also going undefeated for the first 5 games of the season. Westhoff remained a key player in later games, but his impact died off and his place in the team became dubious before a run of good form saw him become a key player. He also established himself well in the two finals games he played against Collingwood and Geelong. His good season saw him come 5th in Port Adelaide's prestigious John Cahill medal, with 199 votes. He capped off a good season with 31 goals and 7 Brownlow votes. Westhoff performed consistently well again in 2014, enjoying another strong year. Playing every game, he registered career highs in both marks and disposals. He played as a wingman who pinch-hit as a mobile forward. Westhoff started the season with 20 disposals, 8 marks, and 5 goals against the Blues. This was the first of 7 games where he registered 20 or more disposals and 2 or more goals in a game. In season 2015, with the addition of Paddy Ryder, his time as both a forward and a relief ruckman became limited. As such, he became something of a roaming wingman. He struggled early in the year, both in terms of finding the football and hitting the scoreboard, kicking only 5 goals in the first 8 games. But as the season went on, Westhoff gathered momentum. He was a key player in Port's win over Collingwood, with an absolutely dominant first half, and was best on ground against Fremantle in the final game of the season. Season 2018 saw him play multiple roles such as a pinch-hitter in the ruck, a safe marker in defence, and swingman on the wing. His consistency was positive to the team throughout the season, and his outstanding season eventually earned him the John Cahill Medal at the age of 32; Ken Hinkley said of the achievement, \\"I've never known a more deserving player\\". He is currently the oldest player in the club's list. Playing Style At 200 cm, Westhoff is capable of playing any position on the ground. His ability to roam across the field makes him a very versatile player.

She remained part of the 14th Flotilla in February 1919, but following a post-war reorganisation of the Royal Navy's destroyer forces, Seafire was listed as part of the 7th Destroyer Flotilla at the beginning of March 1919. Later that month, Seafire, commanded by Commander Andrew Browne Cunningham, later an Admiral of the Fleet, formed part of a force of two light cruisers and ten destroyers under the overall command of Admiral Walter Cowan, which was sent to the Baltic Sea as part of the British intervention in the Russian Civil War. Seafire sailed with only 60 percent of her normal crew, in a reflection of the Royal Navy's manning problems after the end of the First World War. On 3 April, Seafire arrived at Liepāja, Latvia, and was then sent to Ventspils, which was threatened by the advancing Bolshevik forces. Seafire set up soup kitchens to help feed the starving population of Ventspils, using up most of her rations, before returning to Liepāja after four days.Bennett, pp. 87–88Dunn, pp. 90–91 On 16 April, Baltic Germans staged a Coup d'Etat in Latvia. Seafire, still at Liepāja, prevented the Baltic German forces from capturing the transport Saratov, carrying a load of arms and ammunition intended for the armies of the new Baltic states, and helped members of the provisional national government to escape to Saratov, which was protected by the Royal Navy.Dunn, pp. 77, 92–95 On 13 May, Cowan's flagship was badly damaged when she struck a mine while on passage from Reval (now Tallinn) to Liepāja. Seafire escorted Curacoa back to Britain.Dunn, pp. 99–100 In June, Seafire was still listed as part of the 7th Destroyer Flotilla at Rosyth, now part of the Reserve Fleet.

Life He studied theology at St. Sulpice in Paris and finished his studies at Angers. He was then appointed professor of theology at Rouen. During the French Revolution he wrote against the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Having refused to take the oath, he was obliged to go into exile (1792), first to London, then to Holland, and finally to Coesfeld in Westphalia. In 1803 he returned to Rouen, where he was appointed vicar-general and dean of the chapter by Archbishop Cambacérès. As a Gallican, he won the favor of Napoleon, who appointed him Bishop of Séez (1813), and the chapter of the cathedral accepted him as capitular vicar. Pope Pius VII failing to approve of this nomination, the cathedral chapter revoked the nomination (1814), and Baston went into retirement at Saint-Laurent near Pont-Audemer, where he died. Works Baston was the author of numerous works on theology, the most important being \\"Lectiones theologicae\\", written while he was professor theology, in collaboration with Abbé Tuvache (10 vols., Rouen, 1818), and he published several polemical works on the subject of theology: \\"Réponse au mémoire et à la consulation de M.

During the Revolution he wrote many pamphlets against the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and his book \\"Doctrine catholique sur le mariage\\" (1791) was published about the same time. During his exile in Kösfeld he began his \\"Mémoires\\", edited later by the Société d'histoire contemporaine (3 vols., Paris, 1897–99).

Port Edgar is a marina on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth, immediately west of the Forth Road Bridge and the town of South Queensferry, in West Lothian, Scotland. Originally a naval base, HMS Lochinvar, Port Edgar is now a busy marina with a sailing school and 300 berths. The Edgar commemorated in the name is Edgar Aetheling, the brother of Queen Margaret (for whom Queensferry is named). Previously operated by Edinburgh Leisure, the private investment company Port Edgar Marina Limited took over management of the marina in April 2014. Part of the group's £1.5m development plans included a capital dredging project to alleviate concerns about harbour depth. Prior to this project, activity at Port Edgar was threatened by the failure of successive management structures to maintain harbour depths through dredging after the departure of the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy Bought by the Admiralty in 1916 as the site of a future Naval base, the pier at Port Edgar had been regularly used by Royal Navy ships since the 1850s. Shortly after its purchase, the wounded of the Battle of Jutland were landed at Port Edgar for the Royal Naval Hospital at Butlaw, Queensferry. The dead of the battle were buried in the local cemetery. In 1917 the completed base was commissioned as HMS Columbine, a depot for Torpedo Boat Destroyers of the Grand Fleet. HMS Columbine and the naval hospital at Butlaw were closed in 1938. In 1939, at the outbreak of the Second World War, Port Edgar was commissioned as HMS Lochinvar, a training establishment for the Royal Naval Patrol Service. In 1943 HMS Lochinvar relocated to Granton Harbour just a few miles along the coast. Port Edgar became the home to HMS Hopetoun, a Combined Operations training centre for British and Allied navies training for the D-Day landings in France. After the war, HMS Hopetoun closed and in 1946 HMS Lochinvar returned to Port Edgar. It was now home to the Royal Navy minesweepers clearing the Firth of Forth and the eastern coast of Britain of its wartime minefields. In 1958 the Royal Navy Fishery Protection Squadron was moved to HMS Lochinvar. By 1960 the port also became the Navy's only minesweeping training establishment. In 1975 HMS Lochinvar closed and all its operations moved across the Forth to HMS Caledonia in the rebuilt naval base at Rosyth. Today Port Edgar is owned by Edinburgh City Council and is a marina for pleasure craft and a base for other watersports. It sits just west of the Forth Road Bridge, within sight of the 1890 Rail Bridge, and soon to be in the shadow of the new Queensferry Crossing. Port Edgar will sit amongst three major bridges, from three centuries. In 1988 the Algerines Association unveiled a memorial at Port Edgar to the minesweepers and fishery protection vessels based at Port Edgar and Granton between 1939 and 1975.

It is brewed in the country's second largest city, Tartu, by the A. Le Coq brewery. The brand is owned by Baltic Beer Company Ltd (formerly Brand Independence Ltd), based in London, UK, and is brewed under licence in Estonia. A. Le Coq is the second largest brewery in Estonia, with a market share of 36.8% in 2005. History It was introduced to the British market in 2006, initially being supplied to high-quality bars and restaurants in London and elsewhere. Although not originally aimed at the \\"off-trade\\" (take-home sales), it began to be sold by Britain's largest retailer Tesco in September 2007 — 250 of its 1,988 stores stocked it. In late 2007 Brand Independence launched the beer in Italy and Mozambique. In 2008 Viru was also launched in Switzerland and Sweden. The first shipment of Viru beer arrived in Japan in September 2009. The United States received their first shipment of Viru beer in December 2009 and Canada in July 2010. In February 2010 Baltic Beer Company announced sponsorship deal with the Team Suzuki Alstare where Viru Beer became a co-sponsor of the team. In November 2010 Baltic Beer Company introduced redesigned packaging for Viru beer and first shipments to South Korea, Israel and Australia were shipped in December 2010. Since July 2012 Viru is imported to the U.S. by Dolce Beverage Group, LLC Streamwood IL. In August 2012 Baltic Beer Company appointed a new exclusive importer to the UK market - Catalyst Brands, a division of Matthew Clark (UK’s largest national wholesaler). By August 2012 the international presence of Viru beer grew to 20 countries that include Chile, Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, Taiwan, China and Germany. The Product Viru beer is sold in distinctive tall bottles in the shape of an hexagonal pyramid. Current bottle design was updated by an Estonian design agency The Brand Manual and has been registered internationally by Baltic Beer Company Ltd; it is intended to resemble the medieval-era turrets found in Estonia. The name of the beer was changed when it was launched in Britain. In Estonia it was known as A. Le Coq Premium Extra until it was discontinued by the brewery in 2006/2007. A new design label was introduced in 2007. The beer is brewed with malted barley from Lithuania, water drawn from artesian wells at the brewery, and Saaz hops from the city formerly Austrian named Saaz (since 1918 Žatec, today in the Czech Republic). Hops have been produced here for more than seven centuries. Baltic Beer Company will be launching two new styles of Viru beer in early 2013 - a strong bock style beer at 6.8% ABV and a dark lager at 4.7%.

It is noted for its historical Quaker associations. History A Quaker School was founded in Ballitore by Abraham Shackleton (1697–1771) in 1726 which catered for Quakers from many parts of Ireland as well as both Protestant and Catholic local children.Merchants, Mystics and Philanthropists - 350 Years of Cork Quakers Richard S. Harrison Parliamentarian Edmund Burke, a student at Shackleton's school from 1741-1744, remained devoted to his old master, whom he termed \\"the planter of the future age\\". The former home of Mary Leadbeater, a local diarist, is now a Quaker Museum. As of 2013, the Quaker School was proposed for demolition in order to make way for a Glanbia development in the centre of the town. Pupils came from as far away as Bordeaux, Jamaica and Norway to stay and study in the school, staying in a row of houses in the village whose attics had been knocked into one long room. Demographics In the 2002 census, Ballitore had a population of 338, increasing to 793 by the time of the 2016 census. In 1837 the population was 933.Entry for Ballytore in Lewis Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837) Transport Ballitore is connected to the R448 and R747 regional roads. The village is served by bus route 880 operated by Kildare Local Link on behalf of the National Transport Authority. There are several buses each day including Sunday linking the village to Castledermot, Carlow and Naas as well as villages such as Moone in the area.

This approach is an extension of photodynamic therapy, in which a photosensitizer is excited with specific band light. This activation brings the sensitizer to an excited state where it then releases vibrational energy (heat), which is what kills the targeted cells. Unlike photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy does not require oxygen to interact with the target cells or tissues. Current studies also show that photothermal therapy is able to use longer wavelength light, which is less energetic and therefore less harmful to other cells and tissues. Nanoscale materials Most materials of interest currently being investigated for photothermal therapy are on the nanoscale. One of the key reasons behind this is the enhanced permeability and retention effect observed with particles in a certain size range (typically 20 - 300 nm).Maeda H, Wu J, Sawa T, Matsumura Y, Hori K, Tumor vascular permeability and the EPR effect in macromolecular therapeutics: a review, Journal of Controlled Release, 2000, 65 (1-2), 271-284 Molecules in this range have been observed to preferentially accumulate in tumor tissue. When a tumor forms, it requires new blood vessels in order to fuel its growth; these new blood vessels in/near tumors have different properties as compared to regular blood vessels, such as poor lymphatic drainage and a disorganized, leaky vasculature. These factors lead to a significantly higher concentration of certain particles in a tumor as compared to the rest of the body. Coupling this phenomenon with active targeting modalities (e.g., antibodies) has recently been investigated by researchers. Recent studies  Gold NanoRods (AuNR)  Huang et al. investigated the feasibility of using gold nanorods for both cancer cell imaging as well as photothermal therapy.Huang X, El-Sayed I, Qian W, El-Sayed M, Cancer cell imaging and photothermal therapy in the near-infrared region by using gold nanorods, Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2006, 128 (6), 2115-2120 The authors conjugated antibodies (anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies) to the surface of gold nanorods, allowing the gold nanorods to bind specifically to certain malignant cancer cells (HSC and HOC malignant cells). After incubating the cells with the gold nanorods, an 800 nm Ti:sapphire laser was used to irradiate the cells at varying powers. The authors reported successful destruction of the malignant cancer cells, while nonmalignant cells were unharmed. When AuNRs are exposed to NIR light, the oscillating electromagnetic field of the light causes the free electrons of the AuNR to collectively coherently oscillate. Changing the size and shape of AuNRs changes the wavelength that gets absorbed. A desired wavelength would be between 700-1000 nm because biological tissue is optically transparent at these wavelengths. While all AuNP properties are sensitive to change in their shape and size, Au nanorods properties are extremely sensitive to any change in any of their dimensions regarding their length and width or their aspect ratio. When light is shone on a metal NP, the NP forms a dipole oscillation along the direction of the electric field. When the oscillation reaches its maximum, this frequency is called the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). AuNR have two SPR spectrum bands: one in the NIR region caused by its longitudinal oscillation which tends to be stronger with a longer wavelength and one in the visible region caused by the transverse electronic oscillation which tends to be weaker with a shorter wavelength. The SPR characteristics account for the increase in light absorption for the particle. As the AuNR aspect ratio increases, the absorption wavelength is redshifted and light scattering efficiency is increased. The electrons excited by the NIR lose energy quickly after absorption via electron-electron collisions, and as these electrons relax back down, the energy is released as a phonon that then heats the environment of the AuNP which in cancer treatments would be the cancerous cells. This process is observed when a laser has a continuous wave onto the AuNP. Pulsed laser light beams generally results in the AuNP melting or ablation of the particle. Continuous wave lasers take minutes rather than a single pulse time for a pulsed laser, continues wave lasers are able to heat larger areas at once.  Gold Nanoshells  Loo et al. investigated gold nanoshells, coating silica nanoparticles with a thin layer of gold.Loo C, Lowery A, Halas N, West J, Drezek R, Immunotargeted nanoshells for integrated cancer imaging and therapy, Nano Letters, 2005, 5 (4), 709-711 The authors conjugated antibodies (anti-HER2 or anti-IgG) to these nanoshells via PEG linkers. After incubation of SKBr3 cancer cells with the gold nanoshells, an 820 nm laser was used to irradiate the cells. Only the cells incubated with the gold nanoshells conjugated with the specific antibody (anti-HER2) were damaged by the laser. Another category of gold nanoshells are gold layer on liposomes, as soft template. In this case, drug can also be encapsulated inside and/or in bilayer and the release can be triggered by laser light. Gold is often used because it is a good absorber of light energy, it is tunable, non-biodegradable, and has imaging properties.  thermo Nano-Architectures (tNAs)  The failure of clinical translation of nanoparticles-mediated PTT is mainly ascribed to body persistence concerns. Indeed, the optical response of anisotropic nanomaterials can be tuned in the NIR region by increasing their size to up to 150 nm. On the other hand, body excretion of non- biodegradable noble metals nanomaterials above 10 nm occurs through the hepatobiliary route in a slow and inefficient manner. A common approach to avoid metal persistence is to reduce the nanoparticles size below the threshold for renal clearance, i.e. ultrasmall nanoparticles (USNPs), meanwhile the maximum light-to-heat transduction is for < 5 nm nanoparticles. On the other hand, the surface plasmon of excretable gold USNPs is in the UV/visible region (far from the first biological windows), severely limiting their potential application in PTT. Recently, a straightforward approach has been presented in which body excretion of metals is combined with NIR- triggered PTT by employing ultrasmall-in-nano architectures composed by metal USNPs embedded in biodegradable silica nanocapsules. tNAs are the first reported NIR-absorbing plasmonic ultrasmall-in-nano platforms that jointly combine: i) photothermal conversion efficacy suitable for hyperthermia, ii) multiple photothermal sequences and iii) renal excretion of the building blocks after the therapeutic action. Nowadays, tNAs therapeutic effect has been assessed on valuable 3D models of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  Graphene and graphene oxide  Yang et al. demonstrated the viability of graphene for photothermal therapy in 2010 with in vivo mice models.Yang K, Zhang S, Zhang G, Sun X, Lee S-T, Liu Z, Graphene in mice: Ultrahigh in vivo tumor uptake and efficient photothermal therapy, Nano Letters, 2010, 10 (9), 3318- 3323 An 808 nm laser at a power density of 2 W/cm2 was used to irradiate the tumor sites on mice for 5 minutes. As noted by the authors, the power densities of lasers used to heat gold nanorods range from 2 to 4 W/cm2. Thus, these nanoscale graphene sheets require a laser power on the lower end of the range used with gold nanoparticles to photothermally ablate tumors. In 2012, Yang et al. incorporated the promising results regarding nanoscale reduced graphene oxide reported by Robinson et al. into another in vivo mice study.< The therapeutic treatment used in this study involved the use of nanoscale reduced graphene oxide sheets, nearly identical to the ones used by Robinson et al. (but without any active targeting sequences attached). Nanoscale reduced graphene oxide sheets were successfully irradiated in order to completely destroy the targeted tumors. Most notably, the required power density of the 808 nm laser was reduced to 0.15 W/cm2, an order of magnitude lower than previously required power densities. This study demonstrates the higher efficacy of nanoscale reduced graphene oxide sheets as compared to both nanoscale graphene sheets and gold nanorods.

He taught at the University of California at Berkeley from 1958 to 1991. Malia's best known work is his history of Russian communism, \\"The Soviet Tragedy\\" (1994). In it he challenges the traditional Leftist interpretation of communism as a fundamentally sound project, that admittedly went wrong during Stalin's regime, but in later years succeeded in creating a credible alternative to capitalism. Maila posits that the integral socialism proclaimed by Lenin, then soft-pedaled under NEP, resumed by Stalin and pursued by all his successors until Gorbachev, was basically flawed, precisely because it destructed capitalism integrally. The untrammeled socialist project was from the start an uphill battle, which brought about not only the destruction of economic freedom but of almost any freedom. The Soviet system could therefore not tap the reservoir of human potential that its ideology promised to bring to new heights. Malia also wrote a famous essay \\"To the Stalin Mausoleum\\" (1990) which he signed as Z. The essay was reprinted in Eastern Europe...Central Europe...Europe which was edited by Stephen R. Graubard. He is the author of the foreword to the English version of The Black Book of Communism. His book History's Locomotives. Revolution and the making of the Modern World (2006) is a good example of historiographic reflection. In the eighth chapter Malia gives a complete and concise survey of debates about the French Revolution from the 19th century up to our time. One of his colleagues at Berkeley was another prominent Russian historian, Nicholas V. Riasanovsky. In the official Berkeley obituary, Riasanovsky is quoted as saying of Malia that he was an \\"outstanding and now very popular historian, occupying a leading position in the present international discussion of the collapse of the Soviet Union and what that collapse means historically and for the future. (He also was) a brilliant writer in Russian and European intellectual history.\\" Publications * Alexander Herzen and the Birth of Russian Socialism, 1812-1855 (1961) * The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia, 1917-1991 (1994) * Russia under Western Eyes: From the Bronze Horseman to the Lenin Mausoleum (Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1999) * History's Locomotives.

The Dover Patrol formed a discrete unit of the Royal Navy based at Dover and Dunkirk for the duration of the First World War. Its primary task was to prevent enemy German shipping—chiefly submarines—from entering the English Channel en route to the Atlantic Ocean, thereby obliging the Imperial German Navy to travel via the much longer route around Scotland which was itself covered by the Northern Patrol. History In late July 1914, with war looming, 12 Tribal-class destroyers arrived at Dover to join the near obsolete destroyers already at anchor in the harbour, most of them built in the late 19th century. These destroyers formed the nucleus of the fledgling Dover Patrol, which, from its early beginnings as a modest and poorly equipped command, became one of the most important Royal Navy commands of the First World War. The Dover Patrol assembled cruisers, monitors, destroyers, armed trawlers and drifters, paddle minesweepers, armed yachts, Motor Launches and Coastal Motor Boats, submarines, seaplanes, aeroplanes and airships. With these resources it performed several duties simultaneously in the Southern North Sea and the Dover Straits: carrying out anti-submarine patrols; escorting merchantmen, hospital and troop ships; laying sea-mines and even constructing mine barrages; sweeping up German mines; bombarding German military positions on the Belgian coast and sinking U-boats. The Dover patrol was often attacked and took many casualties as in the Action of 15 February 1918. During the war, the Dover Patrol was maintained by the Dover Engineering Works, an Iron Foundry which employed and housed many hundreds of workers in Dover Town and was managed by Vivian Elkington, nephew of Walter Emden. The company still exists today, operating from a reduced premises at Holmestone Road, under the name of Gatic.Gatic. In March 1919 the Dover Patrol was renamed Dover Patrol Force. Commemoration After the war, a fund was set up to erect a memorial to the Dover Patrol. In July 1921, a memorial at Leathercote Point near St Margaret's Bay was unveiled. Similar memorial obelisks stand at Cap Blanc Nez on the French channel coast, and at John Paul Jones Park near Fort Hamilton, overlooking New York harbour.

According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle it took place at somewhere called, in Old English, Æthelingadene.Bately. The Anglo Saxon Chronicle. p. 79 Traditionally, the site was believed to have been what is now Alton, Hampshire.Kendrick. A History of the Vikings p. 262 However, it is thought more likely to have been in the East and West Dean area of modern-day West Sussex.Lapidge. Anglo-Saxon England. pp. 13-14 Causes Between 991 and 1005 Danish attacks on England escalated from small isolated raids to massed attacks by larger forces.Williams. Æthelred the Unready. pp. 43-50 The Danes ravaged the countryside, demanding huge tributes (Danegeld) from Æthelred, the Anglo-Saxon king. However, the attacks continued and their plunder and pillage tactics, combined with a rapid march strategy brought them as far as Æthelingadene. The Attack It began with the arrival of the Viking fleet off the Sussex coast, which then proceeded to \\"Æthelingadene\\" where the men of Hampshire united to fight against them. An indication of the severity of the English casualty list is given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that cites the total English losses as 81, it included two high-reeves and three thegns, of the bishop of Winchester, this was compared, to 'a much greater number' lost by the Danes. However, the Danes managed to win the field and advance further west, while the Anglo-Saxons retreated to Winchester. Consequences The First Battle of Alton failed to stop the Danish Army. It attacked Devon, burning many towns such as Teignton, until the area surrendered. The advance continued towards Exmouth, until it reached Pin-hoo, where the high-steward of the king, Cole, and Edsy, the reeve of the king once again raised an army against it at the Battle of Pinhoe. Again the Danes prevailed and burned 'many goodly towns that we cannot name'. Here they turned eastwards and reached the Isle of Wight, until the people there made peace with them. In the year 1006, Æthelred was forced to make a permanent peace with the hostile force, and gave them a tribute of 30,000 pounds. In 1008, he gave the order to build ships, triggering a huge naval force to be made.Williams. Æthelred the Unready. pp. 80-83 By 1009, this fleet was ready, and was sent to Sandwich to defend the land against attacking forces. Placename The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records the battle as being at Æthelingadene. Ætheling is the Old English for Prince, Ingas is a settlement of people associated with a common leader and Dene is derived from denu the name for valley.John McNeil Dodgson. \\"Place-Names in Sussex\\" in Brandons. South Saxons. Ch. IV. p. 71Gelling. The Landscape of Placenames. p.115Lapidge. Anglo-Saxon England. p. 252 Therefore, the place- name Æthelinga-dene refers to the valley associated with Æthelings and it has been suggested that Dene (now East and West Dean, West Sussex) was where Queen Ælfthryth brought up her grandchildren, the sons of Æthelred, who would have had the title Ætheling.

Berrocal (1957 - October 25, 2000) was the youngest president of Puerto Rico Government Development Bank (1991–1992).  Early years  Berrocal was born in 1957 in Puerto Rico. He graduated in 1975 from the Academia del Perpetuo Socorro in Miramar, PR, where he distinguished himself as president of the student council and the Model United Nations Club of PR. An accomplished debater, he championed Perpetuo's Model UN team to first place at the Washington, DC nationals. In 1979, Berrocal graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor's degree from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He followed this with studies as a Marshall Scholar at Oxford University, and then the study of law at Yale University, where he was an editor at the Yale Law Journal.  Public service  After serving for several years as Legal Counselor to Puerto Rico Governor Rafael Hernández Colón, Berrocal was chosen to serve as president of the Puerto Rico Government Development Bank, the fiscal agent of the Government of Puerto Rico. At the time of his selection, he became the youngest president in the history of the bank. During his years in public service, Berrocal was also the Governor's designee in the years-long negotiations led by the United States Senate Energy Committee Chairman J. Bennett Johnston, D-La, on Puerto Rico's political status, representing the status quo. He also mentored numerous young professionals working in government, some of whom were humorously called \\"berrocalitos\\" (or mini-Berrocal's) in his honor. In 1991, it was rumored that Governor Hernández Colón intended to appoint Berrocal as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, according to a recent history of the Supreme Court (La justicia en sus manos-2007).  Professional life  Subsequent to his stint in government, Berrocal became managing director of Wolfensohn (later acquired by Bankers Trust, then Deutsche Bank, where he worked closely with Federal Reserve Bank chairman Paul Volcker. Prominent businesses in and out of Puerto Rico sought him out as a consultant.  Final illness  Berrocal's close Princeton classmate, Bill Ford, found out that he was seriously ill with a rare disease, thymic cancer. After visiting him in Puerto Rico, Ford sent a plane to fly his friend to the Henry Ford Hospital in Michigan, where a new chemotherapy treatment was applied, to no avail. On October 25, 2000, Berrocal died with his family and Bill Ford at his bedside.  Memorials  On December 7, 2001, Bill Ford and the Ford Motor Company announced the creation of the José M. Berrocal Scholarship for Environmental Studies -- $10,000 scholarships to assist graduate students studying environmental disciplines in Puerto Rico. On May 13, 2002, the Government Development Bank announced the creation of the José M. Berrocal Institute for the Study of Public Finances and the Economy, which offers \\"training on the theory and practice of public finances and economic development to university students and new government employees.\\" Since 2002, the GDB has sponsored the annual José Berrocal Finance & Economy Institute Internships aimed at providing college level students in the areas of Business Administration, Finance, Economy and Public Administrations -- the areas in which Berrocal personally excelled -- with a two-month internship experience.

He was born in Saverne, Alsace, but he is first mentioned as a singer and instrumentalist at St Peter's School in Munich, in 1676. He studied music with the Kantor, Siegmund Auer and, from 1683 to his death in 1693, Johann Caspar Kerll. Murchhauser was appointed music director of the Munich Frauenkirche in 1691, where he remained until his death. Works He published two collections of organ music in the tradition of the South German school, intended for use with the Catholic liturgy; these consist of short toccatas, fantasies and fugues written using the psalm tones and plainchant melodies. The first collection is entitled Octi-tonium novum organicum, octo tonis ecclesiasticis, ad Psalmos, & magnificat (Augsburg, 1696), and contains 89 pieces. The second collection is in two parts of 34 pieces each, entitled Prototypon longo-breve organicum; (part I, Nuremberg, 1703; part II, Nuremberg, 1707). Both may be found in Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Bayern XXX, Jg.xviii (1917). There are other keyboard works in the Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, Vienna, and the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin. A surviving accompanied vocal work, Vespertinus latriae et hyperduliae cultus (Ulm, 1700), contains ten psalms and one laudate. He also published two works on the subject of music theory, designed for instruction in the art of composition: Fundamentalische kurz- und bequeme Handleitung sowohl zur Figural als Choral Music (Munich, 1707), and Academia musico-poetica bipartita, oder Hohe Schul der musicalischen Compositions, part I [there is no part II] (Nuremberg, 1721). These treatises are conservative and distinctly 'old- fashioned' in their treatment of the subject, and were strongly attacked by Johann Mattheson in his Critica musica due to their firmly being founded on the contrapuntal practice of late-16th century sacred music, while Mattheson was in favour of the 'modern', Italian opera-influenced style.

It was initiated by Gandhian Acharya Vinoba Bhave in 1951 at Pochampally village, which is now in Telangana, and known as Bhoodan Pochampally. The Bhoodan Movement attempted to persuade wealthy landowners to voluntarily give a percentage of their land to landless people. Philosophically, Bhave was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's Sarvodaya movement and Gram Swarajya. Women volunteers carried the message of Bhoodan to all parts of India. Women played a significant role in the Telangana Peasants Armed Struggle which challenged the feudal system. As their region became free from bonded labour, women also found freedom from this torment.  Method  Landless labourers were given small plots on which they were welcome to settle and grow their crops. Bhoodan Acts were passed that stated that the beneficiary had no right to sell the land or use it for non- agricultural purposes or for forestry. For example, Section 25 of the Maharashtra State Bhoodan Act states that the beneficiary (who must be landless) should only use the land for subsistence cultivation. If the \\"owner\\" failed to cultivate the land for over a year or tried to use it for non- agriculture activities, the government would have the right to confiscate it. Bhave wanted peasants to give up using bullocks, tractors or other machines for agricultural purposes. This was called rishi-kheti. He also wanted the people to give up using money in the form of kanchan-dan. He was followed by crowds nearly everywhere he went. The movement had the support of Congress. JP Narayan withdrew from active politics to join the Bhoodan movement in 1953.  History  Bhave crossed India on foot to persuade landowners to give up a piece of their land. His first success came on 18 April 1951 at Pochampally village in Nalgonda district, Andhra Pradesh (now Telengana) which was the centre of communist activity. It was the culmination of the Telangana peasant movement. A violent struggle had been launched by peasants against the local landlords. Movement organisers had arranged for Bhave to stay at Pochampally, a village of about 700 families, of whom two-thirds were landless. Bhave visited the Harijan (the Untouchables) colony. By early afternoon villagers began to gather around him. The Harijans asked for eighty acres of land, forty wet, forty dry, for forty families. Bhave asked, \\"If it is not possible to get land from the government, is there not something villagers themselves could do?\\" Shri Vedre Ramachandra Reddy suddenly stood up and offered land to the landless farmers. His initial donation was of 100 acres of his 3,500 acres. He had resigned from a Govt. job to enter politics. He later donated an additional 800 acres. Reddy was born on 17 July 1905 into a prominent family during the Nizam period in Deccan. He joined social reform. After him, the land donation movement continued under a Bhoodan trust movement with the help of his sons. The Nizam of Hyderabad, HEH Mir Osman Ali Khan donated 14,000 acres of his personal land to the Bhoodan Movement. Other landowners including Raja Bahadur Giriwar Narayan Singh, C.B.E. and Raja of Ranka (Garhwa Jharkhand) donated a combined 1,02,001 acres to the Bhoodan initiative, the largest donation in India. During Vinoba Bhave's Surajgarh visit, he was welcomed by Headmasterji-Rambilas Sharma and other members and Vinoba was very happy to see Headmasterji (also a Pandit) serving the society selflessly. He took his garland and honoured Headmasterji. Headmasterji has been instrumental in spreading the Bhoodan Andolan in Jhunjhunu district in the late 1950s and early 1960s . The initial objective of the movement was to secure voluntary donations and distribute it to the landless but soon came to demand 1/6 of all private land. In 1952, the movement widened the concept of gramdan (\\"village in gift\\" or the donation of an entire village) and had started advocating common ownership of land. The first village to come under gramdan was Mangroth in Hamirpur district of Uttar Pradesh. The second and third grandsons took place in Orissa in 1955.  Legacy  This movement developed into a village gift or gramdan movement. This movement was a part of a comprehensive movement for the establishment of a Sarvodaya Society (The rise of all socio-economic- political order), v both in and outside India. By the 1960s the movement had lost momentum. The Sarvodaya Samaj failed to build a mass movement that would generate pressure for social transformation. However, the movement made a significant contribution by creating moral ambivalence, putting pressure on landlords, creating conditions favorable to the landless.India since independence - Bipin Chandra  References  Sources * Bhoodan and the Landless, S.

The Doctor, his \\"beautiful but stupid\\" assistant Dana Sock and Dennis the Denim Cat travel around space and time in the TURDIS (Trans-galactic Urination Regurgitation Defecation Integration System), a portable toilet which is bigger on the inside than the outside. One of the series' villains was Dr Poo's nemesis Dr Wee — a fellow Time and Toilet Lord with a heavy Chinese accent. Dr Poo's catchphrases included \\"Holy Harpic!\\", \\"Dunnies above!\\", \\"Great bogs in Heaven!\\", and \\"Leaping lavatories!\\" The serial's tagline was \\"It's all cisterns go, with the amazing man who dares to go anywhere, Doctor Pooo!\\". Dr Poo was as much in the debt of The Goons as Doctor Who and also reminiscent of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The voice of the Doctor was Lance Curtis, supported by Geoff Kelso as Kevin the Announcer, Steve Johnston as Dana Sock and Ken Matthews. In an episode aired in December 1979, Dr Poo announced his intention to take a four- week holiday. Dr Poo was then replaced in its timeslot by The Khan Ages, an 18-episode serial produced by the Dr Poo team. It starred Genghis Khan, his son Neville Khan and their Mongrel Horde, who had been introduced in an earlier Dr Poo storyline. Its tagline was 'Sweeping across the paddocks of history like a grass fire on a windy day come the Khans. This is the saga of their reign of terror: The Khan Ages'. Dr Poo and Dana returned in the last episode of this serial and Dr Poo resumed the following day. The series was composed of continuous story lines rather than discrete episodes. Every one of more than 400 episodes continued directly into the next, including the Khan Ages storyline. None of the episodes was named; the production team referred to them by number only. An episode guide sent to members of the Dr Poo fan club simply divided the series by each location the TURDIS had landed in. A comic strip version of Dr Poo appeared in Stir Magazine. Each issue included a self-contained 2-page comic strip. Dr Poo was drawn in Tom Baker's Doctor Who costume. Album releases A Dr Poo album, Knees Ahoy! was released in December 1980 on LP and cassette. Episodes which had aired in May 1980 were reworked into six tracks of around six minutes duration. The newly recorded introduction and conclusion dovetailed into each other, so that the album formed an infinite loop if the listener kept changing sides. An EP, The Universe is Big by \\"Dr Poo and the Psychic Koalas\\" was recorded in 1981 but not released. It included five songs based around the major characters of the series. It was eventually released in 1985, as a tribute after the sudden death of Lance Curtis. The title track was later covered on live Doctor Who podcast Splendid Chaps as part of their show at the 2013 Melbourne International Comedy Festival.

One can easily reach this temple by metro, nearest metro station is Vasant Vihar which is around 2 km away from there.http://www.kahajaun.com/delhi/travel/religious/93/uttara-swami-malai- mandir-temple/ Architecture The main temple within the complex, formally called Sree Swaminatha Swami Temple, houses the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Swaminatha. It is situated atop a small hillock in Sector-7 R.K. Puram and overlooking Vasant Vihar in South West Delhi. This is in keeping with the tradition of locating Murugan temples on hills. The sign outside the main temple is written in Tamil, proclaiming Lord Swaminatha's motto, \\"Yaamirukka Bayamain\\" (யாமிருக்க பயமேன்) meaning \\"Why fear when I am there?\\". The temple is built entirely of granite, and is reminiscent of the Chola style Tamil Architecture. Besides the main Swaminatha Swami Temple, the complex contains temples dedicated to Sree Karpaga Vinayagar (elder brother of Lord Swaminatha), Sree Sundareswarar (father of Lord Swaminatha) and Devi Meenakshi (mother of Lord Swaminatha).

He was born in Speinshart, some 150 km from Nuremberg, but spent most of his life in Augsburg, where he worked as cathedral organist for two years. His only surviving music is a 1693 collection, Ars Magna Consoni et Dissoni, which includes toccatas, Magnificat versets and variations in the south German style. Life Augsburg Cathedral, where Speth worked as organist in 1692-94, and probably fulfilled other duties later in life. Speth was born in Speinshart, Bavaria, to teacher Heinrich Speth and his wife Margareta (née Vichtl). Past scholars established that Speth must have received music lessons from the abbot of the Premonstratensian monastery at Speinshart, one Dominikus Lieblein; however, this has recently been disproven. Nothing is known about his life before 1692, when he applied for the position of organist of Augsburg Cathedral. The application, which contained Speth's compositions, was accepted, and he was appointed organist on 4 November 1692. The music he supplied with the application was published the next year in Augsburg as Ars magna Consoni et Dissoni. In the files of the cathedral administration there is a note from 1705 showing that Speth had also to work in the office of the cathedral chapter. The exact date of Speth's death is unknown, but there is a document that shows that in 1719, he still lived with his wife and a maidservant in Augsburg. Music The composer's only surviving work is the collection published in 1693 in Augsburg, Ars magna Consoni et Dissoni. The title may be a reference to Athanasius Kircher's famous book, Musurgia universalis, sive ars magna consoni et dissoni (1650). An early description of the work was included by Johann Gottfried Walther in his Musikalisches Lexicon; Walther claimed Speth only compiled the pieces but did not compose. This hypothesis is now generally considered false. Ars Magna contains music intended for organ or clavichord: ten toccatas (subtitled Musicalische Blumen-Felder), eight Magnificat settings, and three variation sets. The music has clearly traceable Italian influences, with direct borrowings: one of the variation sets is built on a theme by Bernardo Pasquini, there is also a passage from Bernardo Storace in the Spangioletta variation set, and a verset by Alessandro Poglietti (quinti toni no. 3). The influence of contemporary southern organists is also apparent, particularly that of Georg Muffat and Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer. The toccatas are unusually short for the genre; most consist of three (toccata-fugue-toccata) sections. There are some interesting features such as dynamic indications in Toccata quarta. The Magnificat settings are, like similar pieces by Johann Kaspar Kerll and others, short versets for alternatim practice.

It was among the scores of units raised starting in the middle of the war to augment Federal troop strength by tapping into the large Southern population of former slaves. The regiment, accompanied by Harriet Tubman, participated in the Raid at Combahee Ferry in which roughly 800 slaves were freed. It gained notoriety among certain quarters for its actions during the controversial looting and burning of the pro-Confederate town of Darien, Georgia. This operation was part of the Union strategy to damage the Confederate states' ability to supply food and materials towards their war effort.. The regiment and its role in burning Darien are featured in the 1989 Civil War film Glory. Service In January 1863, Col. James Montgomery of Kansas was authorized to raise a regiment of troops consisting entirely of free blacks and refugee former slaves, which were to serve under white officers. While many men readily agreed to military service, dozens were compelled by the Army to obey conscription notices. Montgomery organized the 2nd South Carolina Volunteer Infantry at Beaufort and Hilton Head, South Carolina. The new recruits were mustered into Federal service on May 22, 1863. The 2nd was attached initially to the Districts of Hilton Head and Beaufort, S.C., Tenth Army Corps, Department of the South.The Civil War Archive Throughout 1863 and part of 1864, Montgomery practiced his Jayhawker brand of irregular warfare in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. In June 1863, Montgomery's brigade, including the 2nd South Carolina and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry under Col. Robert Gould Shaw, participated in operations along the Atlantic Coast resembling his earlier Jayhawking raids in Kansas and Missouri. The 2nd South Carolina was a part of the Raid at Combahee Ferry in which 800 slaves were freed. The regiment later helped loot and burn the coastal town of Darien, Georgia, despite the fact that it was undefended and offered no resistance. In July 1863, the 2nd and the rest of Montgomery's brigade moved to Morris Island off the South Carolina coast. They took part in the expedition to James Island from July 7–17, and skirmished with Confederates at Grimball's Landing on July 16. The 2nd participated in the siege operations on Morris Island against Forts Wagner and Gregg from July 18 until September 7, when the Confederate defenders abandoned the two forts and withdrew.National Park Service battle description The 2nd South Carolina was involved in the subsequent operations against Fort Sumter and the defenses of Charleston until January 29, 1864. It moved to Hilton Head, and then to Jacksonville, Florida, on February 5–7. While in Florida, the regiment was disbanded and subsequently reorganized as the 34th Infantry Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops on February 8, 1864.

Credited with introducing \\"an entirely new organizational technique: that of action based on preliminary study\\" to the co-operative movement in Canada, his work sparked a wave of co- operative development across the Maritimes and credit union development across English Canada.Bergengren, p. 248 Due to his role and influence, he is often compared to Alphonse Desjardins in Québec. The influence of the movement he led spread across Canada in the 1930s and by the 1940s and 1950s, to the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. Early years Born into a large Irish Catholic family on a farm in the Margaree Valley of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Moses was the eldest boy in a family of twelve. As a youth he was very concerned at the scale of outmigration from the valley: young men and women leaving for the steel mills and coal mines, or taking up jobs as domestics in the \\"Boston States\\". He determined he would get a good education so he could help people make their farms more profitable and give them a reason to stay on the land.Lotz, pp. 14-16 Coady would draw on an unusual combination of gifts, having ‘the soul of a poet’ and ‘the mind of a mathematician’. After graduating top of his class at ‘St. FX’ (St. Francis Xavier University) in Antigonish in 1905, Coady was persuaded by his first cousin Jimmy Tompkins to enter the priesthood. He followed Tompkins to Rome, where he studied theology and philosophy. Fighting a \\"weird pessimism\\" After his ordination in Rome in 1910, Coady began teaching at St. FX. He put on special classes for students at risk of failing, and prided himself on being able to teach maths to anyone. He honed his considerable oratorical skills and developed a talent for making complex concepts easily understood. Emigration from Nova Scotia continued, and Coady fought against a kind of \\"weird pessimism (that) so benumbed everybody that nothing has been attempted to break the spell.\\"Lotz, p. 34 In 1921 he helped organize the province’s school teachers. Typically earning about $35 a month, four out of five were young women who lost their jobs as soon as they married. At a meeting of the teachers’ fragile union in Truro that year he urged action and was elected secretary-treasurer. He spent much of the next 3 years expanding support for the union and founding/editing the Nova Scotia Teachers’ Bulletin. The defining moment in Coady’s career came when he testified before a Canadian government commission in 1927. Drawing on his own experience and that of other Movement leaders like Jimmy Tompkins and Hugh MacPherson (an early co-operative pioneer) he maintained that the local economy could be revitalized if the right type of learning was cultivated in ordinary people: especially critical thinking, scientific methods of planning and production, and co-operative entrepreneurship.Welton. A new and disturbing presence, p. 97 Launching a movement The report of the MacLean Commission was catalytic: in late 1928 St. FX organized an Extension Department to carry adult education to the people of the province, appointing Coady as its first director. The Canadian Department of Fisheries asked Coady to help the government \\"organize the fishermen\\". Through the years of the Antigonish Movement, financial support came from St. FX, the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation (two New York-based charities), and the local Scottish Catholic Society. Coady’s own staff resources were supplemented by collaboration with the Department of Fisheries, and later by widespread volunteerism in the villages.Lotz, p. 51 The chronic decline in the fisheries gained new urgency with the onset of the Great Depression. Mines closed and thousands of miners were thrown out of work. Out-migration slowed, but for all the wrong reasons. Many jobless emigrants returned home. Through the new department, Coady linked adult education with co-operative business ventures in the distinctive blend that became known as the Antigonish Movement. The immediate priorities of the Extension Department were the formation of ‘study clubs’, the emergence of new co-operatives and a school for leaders. Study clubs gave ordinary Maritimers an opportunity to critically analyze the dynamics keeping them poor and to study possible solutions. The clubs helped people to plan and then successfully launch co-operatives in many fields: agricultural marketing, fish canning, dairy, retail sales and housing. Once the co-operatives were launched, the school for leaders kept their managers and directors continually stimulated with new and fresh ideas and business methods. Coady also invested considerable energy in catalyzing and strengthening wholesale co-operatives around the Maritimes: including the United Maritime Fishermen, the United Fruit Companies of Nova Scotia and the Canadian Livestock Co-operatives (Maritimes). For example, he brokered conflicting interests and provided timely technical support in the formation of the United Maritime Fishermen. UMF was a trade association for the region’s fishing co-ops \\"with a strong adult education component\\". It promoted canneries and provided cooperative marketing services to fishermen to help them capture a greater share of the profit from their catch. High tide in Antigonish The period from 1929 until World War II marked the high tide of the Antigonish Movement. For a discussion of the ideas and techniques of the movement, see the Antigonish Movement. The leaders of the movement saw themselves as developing the full potential economic, social and cultural potential within the people of the region. \\"But perhaps the most important reason why the Antigonish movement was able to have a significant, lasting impact was its promotion of credit unions\\" which delivered microfinance. The farmers, fishers and miners who formed the backbone of the movement had little access to credit before the Great Depression, and lost what little they had as the downturn started to bite.MacPherson, p. 132 When the Antigonish movement looked for external allies in credit union development, it did not seek them from the movement in Quebec, where Alphonse Desjardins had founded the first credit union movement in North America three decades earlier. Instead, it looked across the border to the United States – to Roy Bergengren and Credit Union National of America. Bergengren drafted a credit union law for Nova Scotia that was ratified by the provincial legislature in 1932. That year Coady, MacDonald and Bergengren visited the fishing village of Broad Cove, where they helped the residents form the first credit union in the Maritimes. By 1936 Coady was increasingly traveling beyond the Maritimes to Ontario, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, where his speeches and ideas helped ignite local credit union movements. While results were not uniform, many of Coady’s initiatives proved successful. By 1944 United Maritime Fishermen represented 70 member fishing co-ops around Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. That year it sold $1.4 million in product, including $400,000 in lobsters into New England.MacPherson, p. 201. By 1945 there were over 400 credit unions in the Maritimes, with 70,000 members and $4.2 million in assets. Later years By the end of World War II credit unions and other co-operatives dotted the Maritimes, transforming the lives of thousands of people. Coady was honoured within the co-operative movement and beyond. He was featured on a national radio program of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation on co-operatives in 1940. In 1946 the Vatican made him a Monsignor. In 1949 Coady was asked to address the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. He argued that environmental problems stemmed from ignorance of science, concentration of rural land ownership in the hands of a few, and exploitation of land primarily for profit. In spite of the success and public recognition, Coady’s optimism and faith in people were tested in the later years of his life. Some co- operative leaders had committed fraud, while others had sold out their community’s resources to vested interests. Some fishermen sold their fish for \\"half a cent less\\" to the very middlemen whose monopolistic behavior their co- ops had been formed to discipline. As the co-ops gradually became larger and more professional, many ordinary members lost their connection, and reverted to the ‘weird pessimism’ that had bothered Coady in his youth. During the 1940s and 1950s the Extension Department increasingly turned its attention to international development. After suffering a major heart attack, Coady stepped down as Director of the Extension Department on February 5, 1952. He was 70, and would continue to work nationally and internationally as Director Emeritus of the Extension Department, now with 25 staff, until his death. In his dying days, Coady told his bishop that he was at peace with God and that \\"If I die, I die happy in the thought that my blueprint is being realized much more surely than I ever had a right to expect.\\" On his death at age 77, two fishermen, two farmers, a miner and a steelworker carried his body to a grave on a hill overlooking Antigonish.Welton. Beyond Coady Coady’s only book, Masters of Their Own Destiny, was an expression of the philosophy of the movement. Still in print, it has been translated into seven languages. A volume of his speeches, The Man from Margaree, was published by Alexander Laidlaw in 1971. Numerous books have been written about both the man and the movement he led. During his life Coady received three honorary degrees (Boston, Ottawa, Ohio). Criticisms Biographer Michael Welton (Little Mosie from the Margaree: A Biography of Moses Michael Coady, 2001) depicts Coady as a flawed man. \\"Coady’s agonal last few years reflect, I think, a profound state of hubris. No one can be certain how Coady deceived himself into thinking that he had a divine mission to liberate the peoples of the world.\\"Welton, 2000. Welton compares this millenarian mindset to that of contemporaries Hitler and Stalin. He writes that although Coady tried to mask his feelings behind a veneer of faith in democracy and ordinary people, the veneer wore thin later in his life, and Coady’s faith in others was replaced by a sense of betrayal and a tendency towards manipulation. Another recent biographer, Jim Lotz (The Humble Giant: Moses Coady, Canada's Rural Revolutionary, 2005) criticizes Coady for precisely the opposite flaw: his unwillingness or perhaps inability to confront political corruption and rent seeking in his home province. \\"Coady’s belief in the power of ideas to change the hearts and actions of men and women came up against … the petty, patronage-ridden political system in Nova Scotia in the 1930s.\\"Lotz, p. 85 Lotz also documents the difficult relations between Coady and the Acadian co- operative movement. For example, the Rev. Alexandre Boudreau, a co-operative leader from the region of Chéticamp in Cape Breton claimed that Coady kept Acadians out of important positions in the Antigonish Movement. And while acknowledging their debt to Coady and to the study club approach, Acadians felt like outsiders in the New Brunswick Credit Union League. This led to the emergence of a parallel Acadian federation in New Brunswick in 1946.Mouvement des caisses populaires acadiennes official website Today, the credit union system in this officially bilingual province has over twice the market penetration of the system in Nova Scotia. Its performance is largely driven by the 200,000 member Mouvement des caisses populaires acadiennes. In Nova Scotia the dynamism of the movement did not survive Coady’s generation. Of 60,000 credit union members in Nova Scotia at the time of Coady’s death in 1959, nearly half joined the movement during the period 1932-39, when Coady was spending most of his time in the villages. By contrast, the mantle of Alphonse Desjardins was inherited by very able successors like Cyrille Vaillancourt whose leadership and innovation continued to drive the Quebec movement from one success to the next. In the words of Coady’s protégé Alexander Laidlaw \\"if co-operatives are to be a true people’s movement, they must generate their own power from within.\\"Alexander Laidlaw. Training and extension in the co- operative movement: a guide for fieldmen and extension workers. Agricultural Development Paper #74, Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, Rome, 1962, p. 27. As historian Ian MacPherson shows in the case of British Columbia (another very successful province), enduring success results from multi- faceted roots – which in that case included active participation by an active agricultural cooperative system, urban unions, farmers organizations, the Catholic Church, private welfare groups and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.Ian MacPherson. Co-operation, Conflict and Consensus: BC Central and Credit Union Movement to 1994. Credit Union Central of BC, Vancouver, 1995. Legacy The Board of Governors of St. Francis Xavier University established the Coady International Institute in Coady's honour less than six months after his death. The Institute has played a dynamic role in the emergence of credit unions throughout the world, especially in Africa. Since then, over 6,000 community development practitioners from over 130 countries have studied at the campus in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. Study clubs have been used widely in Africa, the Caribbean and South Asia in rural villages, and their method and approach anticipated the emergence of participatory rural appraisal in the 1980s and 1990s. Because study clubs increased the willingness and ability of poorer people to participate, they were one of the most significant innovations in credit unions since the first were formed by Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen in rural Germany in 1864. Coady, like Raiffeisen, Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch and Alphonse Desjardins was part of a global movement in co-operative microfinance. Due to the poor performance of many community-based credit unions in the developing world, this movement lost its momentum in the 1970s, to be replaced by the more centralized approach characteristic of the microcredit movement. However, the main successes in microcredit have been confined to urban or very densely populated rural areas. In recent years there has been a revival of interest in village-based and participatory approaches, such as the SHG movement in India and the ASCA movement in Africa to address the problem of financial services for poor rural farmers. The Co-operative Union of Canada under the leadership of George Keen spread both the philosophy and the tools of the Antigonish Movement widely across Canada. Led by co-operative entrepreneurs like Jake Siemens, adult education became a priority in western Canada with the foundation of the Western Co-operative College in Saskatoon in 1955. (1893-1952), the Assistant Director of the Extension Department under Coady, rose to national leadership in the Union in 1945, from whence he led an increasing international engagement on behalf of Canadians.Ian MacPherson. Building and Protecting the Co-operative Movement: A Brief History of the Co-operative Union of Canada, 1909-84. Co-operative Union of Canada, Ottawa, 1984, pp. 112-21. Coady described MacDonald as a brilliant man, capable of organizing and maintaining a far-flung network of study clubs and cooperatives, who had a \\"keen and penetrating mind, always ahead of the people yet practical enough to keep within the range of what was possible. He was radical enough in other words to be progressive, and, conservative enough to be sane.\\" See also *Rural community development Notes References *Alexander, Anne M.

He was known for his special interest in Basque culture, Basque history and Basque society. Of Basque ancestry, he was the nephew of the renowned writer Pio Baroja and his brother, painter, writer and engraver Ricardo Baroja. He is buried in the family plot of the cemetery of Bera, Navarre, near their home, Itzea. Biography Julio was the eldest son of the editor Rafael Caro Raggio, who founded the publishing house Editorial Caro Raggio Madrid in 1917. His mother was Carmen Baroja, a Spanish writer and ethnologist who wrote under the pseudonym Vera Alzate. As a child, he moved to the Navarrese town of Bera, where he spent much time with his uncle Pio Baroja. Pio took great interest and had a very important influence on his education. His early schooling was at the Instituto-Escuela de Madrid from 1921–1931. Later, he was attending the University of Madrid when the Spanish Civil War broke out. Taken by surprise, he returned to Bera. His father remained in Madrid and lost his printing press when his publishing headquarters were destroyed during a bombing raid. After the war, he returned to Madrid to complete his studies receiving a PhD (summa cum laude) in Ancient History. He worked as an assistant in the Ancient History and Dialectology departments until he became Director of the Museo del Pueblo Español (1942–1953). In 1947, Baroja was elected corresponding member of the Royal Academy of the Basque Language and the Real Academia de las Buenas Letras of Barcelona. In 1951, he received a grant from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research to carry out ethnological research in the United States. From 1952 to 1957, he was in charge of an official Spanish exploration mission in the Spanish Sahara. He later said, \\"I have strange images of what I have done.... There are things which I have done in a moment of total change, such as when I went to the Sahara and wrote a book about the nomads... but I get the feeling that it was not even me that wrote it.\\" Having grown up in an isolated community where people still believed in magic and witchcraft, he became interested in the magical arts. Before he was 20, he had spoken to elderly people who were convinced that there were \\"men and women who could change themselves into animals, fly, and do other things. He read numerous books, among them, the works of Pierre de Lancre. His interest, which had waned during the Spanish Civil War was renewed during a trip to London. He bought several more books and blending his earlier and later findings, he brought a more modern view of people in relation to the world around them. In his book, The World of the Witches (1961), he believed that the witch's world, like any other social group, changes considerably from one generation to the next. He explained that this book tied social history in with anthropology. \\"Julio Caro Baroja: 1914-1995\\". EMuseum at Minnesota State University, Mankato. Archived from the original on 2010-01-06. In 1952, the British Council placed him in charge of the guidance of graduates who were to study Anthropology at the University of Oxford. He also taught ethnology at the University of Coimbra in Portugal. In 1961, he was Director of Studies of Social and Economic History at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris. In 1983, was a recipient of the Prince of Asturias Awards, and in 1989, he was awarded the Menéndez Pelayo International Prize for his research efforts in the field of Spanish ethnology. He is remembered throughout Spain. The Plaza Julio Caro Baroja in San Sebastian and I.E.S. Julio Caro Baroja schools located in Fuenlabrada, near Madrid; Getxo, Bilbao; Málaga, Andalusia and Pamplona, Navarre, are tributes to his many accomplishments and contributions to the fields of anthropology and history.

Born on 20 April 1867 at Nenthead, Alston, Cumberland, he spent his early life in the northwest of England before his family moved to Essex. He became an insurance clerk in London, living in Loughton where he had a cottage, but at the age of 36, he gave up this existence and went to live under canvas, in a rough wooden shack, and in a cave (which he dubbed \\"The Cave Hotel\\"), from where he offered camping and adventure holidays referred to by the BBC Countryfile programme broadcast on 20 September 2015. He spent his summers in the cave in Borrowdale, moving south to the wooden shed in Buckinghamshire during the colder months. An alternative lifestyler long before the term was created, Dalton – vegetarian, pacifist and teetotaller – lived off his wits, surviving on a small income as a climbing guide. Millican Dalton's cave, as it is locally known, is on the eastern flank of Castle Crag and consists of two inter-connected split-levelled caves formed by the slate quarrying process. This cave was inhabited for nigh-on fifty years by Dalton. To this day, Dalton's legacy can be seen in the upper chamber of the cave, where he carved his own epitaph into the wall above where he slept. It reads: \\"Don't Waste Words, Jump to Conclusions\\". During the winter of 1946–47, Dalton's hut burned down, so he moved into a tent. This was too much for his 79-year-old frame, however, and he contracted pneumonia, of which he died in Amersham Hospital on 5 February 1947.

Considered among the most versatile and talented French film composers of his generation, Sarde has scored over two hundred films, film shorts, and television mini-series. He received an Academy Award nomination for Tess (1979), and twelve César Award nominations, winning for Barocco (1976) and The Judge and the Assassin (1976). In 1993, Sarde received the Joseph Plateau Music Award. Life and career Philippe Sarde was born 21 June 1948 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, Île-de-France, France. His mother, Andrée Gabriel, was a singer in the Paris Opera. Through his mother's encouragement, he became interested in music from the early age of three. When he was four years old, he conducted a brief section of Carmen at the Paris Opera. At the age of five, he began experimenting with sound recording and made his first short films. Sarde loved both music and film, and had trouble deciding on his career direction. Sarde entered the Paris Conservatory, where he studied harmony, counterpoint, fugue, and composition under Noël Gallon. At the age of seventeen, he directed a short 35-mm film in black and white, for which he composed the music, asking Vladimir Cosma to help him with the orchestration. At the age of eighteen, after writing songs for Régine, Sarde met Claude Sautet, who asked him to write the music for his film The Things of Life (1969). The experience established his career direction and initiated a long partnership with Sautet that spanned twenty-five years and eleven films. Sarde also established close associations with directors Bertrand Tavernier, Pierre Granier-Deferre, Georges Lautner, André Téchiné, and Jacques Doillon. Sarde also collaborated with Roman Polanski on The Tenant and Tess, which garnered an Academy Award nomination, Bertrand Blier's on Beau-Père, Alain Corneau on Fort Saganne, and Marshall Brickman on Lovesick, The Manhattan Project, and Sister Mary Explains It All. In 1988, Sarde was a member of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival. Film director Georges Lautner once observed that he was constantly amazed by the composer's ability to find a unique approach to each film that he scored. According to Yuri German, writing in the All Music Guide, Sarde's soundtracks are \\"masterfully and unconventionally arranged\\" and are often performed by such world-class musicians as Chet Baker, Stan Getz, Stéphane Grappelli, and Maurice Vander.\\" In April 1990, Sarde married Nave Florence, but they divorced the following year. In 1994, he married Clotilde Burre. They have two daughters, Ponette (born 1998) and Liza (born 1999). Both are enrolled in the seventeenth arrondissement of Paris. Sarde is the brother of producer Alain Sarde.

It was initially organized to protect the Nebraska Territory from Indian attacks, but primarily served in the Western Theater before being reorganized and sent to the frontier. Service When the war started, U.S. Regular Army troops were withdrawn from Fort Kearny and Fort Randall to serve in more threatened areas, but at the increased risk to Nebraska settlers from Indian attacks. The Federal government requested that the Nebraska Territory form one volunteer regiment, with some companies supposed to stay behind to protect the territory. The territorial legislature met in special session in Omaha, and agreed to raise the requested local defense force. Thus, the 1st Nebraska Infantry Regiment was organized at Omaha, between June 11 and July 21, 1861, with the future governor of Nebraska and the Wyoming Territory, John Milton Thayer, as its first colonel. However, the promise was reneged, and the regiment was sent eastward in August to fight the Confederacy.Cromie. A tour guide to the Civil War. p.173. The regiment camped at various sites in Missouri, including Pilot Knob, throughout the fall and winter of 1861–1862. After joining the Union forces under Ulysses S. Grant, the 1st Nebraska Infantry participated in the successful attack on Fort Donelson in Tennessee, fought at the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, and took part in the Union advance on, and siege of, Corinth, Mississippi. The unit then participated in several minor engagements in Missouri and Arkansas. The regiment was redesignated the 1st Nebraska Cavalry Regiment on November 6, 1863. It was transferred to the frontier to keep the Plains Indians in check. It was amalgamated with the 1st Nebraska Veteran Cavalry Battalion in 1865, and mustered out of the Union Army in 1866.

Along with Georg Caspar Wecker, he taught a generation of musicians in the tradition of the South German school, including Nikolaus Deinl, Johann Krieger, Johann Löhner, Johann Pachelbel, J.B. Schütz, and Maximilian Zeidler. Schwemmer taught singing, while Wecker gave instruction in keyboard playing and composition.

The resort is just over one hour driving time from Toronto and is located just off Highway 400, which makes it a prime destination for Toronto- area skiers. Although the hill itself is fairly small, it has been extensively built out, with three high-speed six-pack lifts headlining a total of 13 lifts. History In 1956 Josl Huter, a skier who had formerly competed in the Austrian National Alpine Championships, emigrated to Toronto from Austria to start a career in the automotive industry. He returned to the ski industry again the next year almost by accident, after meeting a friend who worked at the Limberlost Resort outside of Huntsville, Ontario who asked Huter to fill in for a sick instructor. Huter was diagnosed with a small brain tumour which was removed in January 1958, but returned to the industry the following year. During the summer he returned to Austria and married, working in a small inn there during the summer, and as a ski instructor in Canada in the winter, now at Muskoka Sands Resort. In the spring of 1963 he was offered a manager position at Horseshoe Valley Ski Resort just north of Barrie, but when this position did not pan out a friend mentioned that there was another potential resort location nearby. They sold their Austrian inn and purchased the land in the fall of 1963, starting work cutting the trails that December. Bulldozers were used to clear out additional brush and rocks in May 1964, and two were added late that fall. Mount St. Louis first opened for business on December 16, 1964. The weather did not cooperate, and all the snow melted off four days later, so local high-school students were hired to carry snow from the surrounding bush and dump it on the trail in an effort to keep it open. This sort of thaw proved to be common, not entirely surprising given the south-east facing slopes. To address this problem, the first snowmaking system was installed in 1966. The hill rapidly expanded over the next few years. Additional runs were added in 1967 and 68, along with a new triple chair, Canada's first, in 1969. New trails were added in 1971, and a new double chair was added to serve them the next year. Through the 1970s a number of new resorts in the Collingwood area offered higher verticals, and started to draw business away from Mount St.Louis. In 1978 Huter responded by moving 400,000 m3 of dirt onto the top of the original triple-served run, raising it about 50 feet. By the time construction was completed in 1979, 600,000 m3 had been moved, giving the hill its current 168 m (550 ft) vertical. A quad-passenger chairlift at Mount St. Louis Moonstone. Throughout this period a second hill was developing only a few hundred metres to the north, Moonstone. In 1983 they had installed Canada's first quad chair on their longest trail. In 1984 Huter purchased Moonstone, and started moving 500,000 m3 of dirt onto the top if its quad-served run, raising it in the same fashion as Mt. St. Louis had been earlier, but only to 420 ft. The next year the original T-bars on Mt. St. Louis were replaced by a new quad, giving the combined Mt. St. Louis Moonstone the largest uphill capacity in Ontario (at the time). Moonstone was again raised, this time to 500 ft. In 1989 the Mt. St. Louis peak was again expanded with another 700,000 m3 of dirt, and a high-speed quad was added to service it, replacing the earlier triple. The next major expansion was in 1996, when another 650,000 m3 was added to Moonstone, and one of Moonstone's quads was replaced with a high-speed six-pack. In 2007 another high speed six-pack was added to Mt. St Louis, replacing one triple and one double chair. In the summer of 2013, the first set of lights were added to some trails for night skiing starting the next season.

It is a parody of magical girl manga. Tsukune is a skillful and powerful witch who rescues others from danger. In 2005, an OVA series was created and directed by Hiroaki Sakurai. Summary EPISODE 1 In the introduction, a man with rabbit ears has fallen down a cliff. His leg is broken, and he is hungry. Tsukune appears and heals him, as well as cooking her sidekick Pupurin so he has something to eat (although the man is a vegetarian). Pupurin's ghost still hangs around, though. In the first part, the king mails himself to Tsukune, as he has been threatened by the Daimauo (meaning \\"Great Devil\\"). The delivery boy then reveals himself as the Daimauo and turns the king into a frog. In retaliation, Tsukune places a bad luck curse on the Daimauo: he gets lost, loses his wallet and keys, steps in dog mess, and his castle burns down. He apologises and returns the king to normal, but Tsukune cannot help, as she cannot fix the secondary causes of magic with more magic, only the immediate (for example, if she were to use magic to knock someone over, she could use magic to make sure he didn't fall over again, but if he landed on a detonator, she couldn't do anything about that). As an alternative, she sends the Daimaou back in time (via a reference to Doraemon), and he tells his past self about Tsukune. His past self shows up at her house, and tries to kill her, placing an anti-magic barrier around her house, but she knocks him out with a large mallet. In the second part, two robbers try to rob a convenience store, but are stopped by a young girl, who asks the cashier if he knows the location of Tsukune's house. When she arrives, she introduces herself as Shioretta Flowers (Shioretta means \\"wilted\\", thus a pun on \\"wilted flowers\\"), a witch, and her butler Shibata, who wears a wig. She explains that she plans on becoming the world's greatest witch, and to do so she is defeating other witches. Her next target is Tsukune, but before they can fight, Mr Judge (a man in a superhero-esque outfit and an iron mask with the word LAW stamped on it) appears and tells them that love is the only way to win, so Tsukune proposes a love and peace contest: they will each cast a nasty spell on someone, switch partners, and cast a spell to undo the damage, with the first one to hit a button winning. They use Shibata and the mayor, Mr Mayor (a decomposing corpse), and cast their spells. Shioretta's spell somehow brings the mayor back to life, but as she is gloating, Tsukune reveals that she cast more than one spell. As such, the mayor now has a wig, and Shibata has a full head of hair. Shioretta concedes defeat and leaves, promising to return and battle Tsukune again. In the third part, the two robbers from the second part help an old woman home. Having done something good, they decide to do something bad in order to keep the balance. Meanwhile, Tsukune gets a letter from her parents telling her that her little sister Kokoro is coming to visit. Tsukune greets her, and tells the mayor that Kokoro has a problem with her magic: every time she sneezes, she causes something to blow up. After Kokoro destroys Tsukune's house, she goes off to play, but is kidnapped by the robbers, who demand one million yen for her safe return. Tsukune sends the mayor down through the telephone lines to save her sister, causing the robbers to flee. But when the mayor ungags Kokoro, she sneezes again, causing the robbers hideout to explode. EPISODE 2 In the first part, Tsukune comes out of a movie theatre and meets the mayor and his niece, Kanako. Kanako is very interested in magic, and wants to become a witch herself, so Tsukune decides to teach both her and the mayor. As normal humans cannot use magic, Tsukune gives them a magic-infused bat to use. The mayor tries to fly, but fails. Kanako tries to save a man being chased by a dinosaur, but only manages to make a flower appear on his head. Upon learning that they can only cast one more spell (which Tsukune explains as necessary, as there would be no need for witches otherwise), they play Rock Paper Scissors. Kanako wins, but upon seeing that so many people need her help, she decides to take her uncle for a fly, only to have the two of them fall to the ground. In the second part, Tsukune, Kokoro, the mayor and Kanako celebrate the New Year at home. They are then visited by Uncle Tony, a famous explorer. When he learns that in Japan it is customary to give gifts on New Years, he decides to do the same. However, the gifts he gives are rather unorthodox: Kokoro gets a rare animal (which dies after she sneezes), Kanako gets a mummy (which she treats like a doll), Tsukune gets a necklace (the only sensible gift) and the mayor gets an Egyptian death mask. Tony then mentions he also found a tuna, exciting the mayor (who gets hungry whenever food is offered), but it turns out to be a torpedo which explodes. EPISODE 3 Tsukune is waiting for Shioretta, who has challenged her to a magical battle at her (Tsukune's) house. But when Shioretta does arrive, her hair is black and she is wearing a kimono. She explains that while she was on her way to Tsukune's house, she was nearly knocked off her broom by a boy named Yosei Hattori. She immediately fell in love with him, and after finding out that he attends the same school of magic she does (she is taking a leave of absence) and that he likes traditional Japanese women, she decided to change herself. At that moment, the Love Smith (a woman wearing a mask with a heart on it) appears. Having dedicated her life to helping girls with love, she advises Shiroettea not to change herself for a boy, and to write Hattori a love note. Unfortunately, he has thousands, so Shioretta decides to give him her letter in person, but when the Love Smith sees him, she decides she wants him for herself. She throws syringes filled with love potion at his friends, but when she tries to throw one at him, he throws it back at her, causing her to fall in love with herself. A few days later, Shioretta's butler Shibata asks Tsukune to help his mistress. Shioretta has turned her room into a Hattori shrine, and Tsukune agrees to help her back to normal. She and Shibata try to find some bad things about Hattori, but fail. Slapping Shioretta back to normal doesn't help either. As they are walking in the garden, Hattori appears out of the soil (his maternal grandfather was a carrot, no idea how that works) and gives them some advice about the posters Shioretta is putting up (he is obviously used to this). He then reveals he is being followed by 2 strange men, who introduce themselves as the Handsome Hunters, men who hate those who are handsome. They plan to kill Hattori. When he points out that he is from a school of magic, they threaten to kill Tsukune if he uses magic. Hattori casually turns his hand into a weapon (his paternal grandfather was a cyborg, no idea how that works either) and shoots them. EPISODE 4 In the first part, Kokoro wins a trip to a tropical island in a lottery, and takes Tsukune, Kanako and the mayor with her. There are very few people on the beach, as a man-eating shark has invaded the bay, so everyone plays on the beach. Unfortunately, Shioretta is there as well (her family owns the island), and she challenges Tsukune to a watermelon bashing contest, where they must use magic to control their player. Naturally, the mayor and Shibata are chosen. The referee is Watermelon Master (a man with a watermelon for a head). Unfortunately for him, he keeps getting hit. The watermelon falls into the water, so the two men must go into the water. Tsukune uses magic to multiply Watermelon Master for some reason, and the duplicates are eaten by sharks. The three men wash up on the beach, where Watermelon Master is hit by Kokoro. Later, Tsukune and her friends are telling scary stories, but when the mayor begins his story, he sees a ghost, and is terrified. Luckily for him, an exorcist appears and makes him pay one million yen for a pot before helping him. He then banishes the ghost with just a word, making Tsukune suspicious. Later, as the mayor heads to the restroom, he sees the ghost again. The exorcist makes him pay one million yen for another pot, but is interrupted by Tsukune, who reveals that the ghost and exorcist are in cahoots. The exorcist reveals \\"himself\\" as Nabule, an evil witch. She and Tsukune engage in a short, pointless battle, before she flees. Tsukune throws the pot at her and gets the mayor's money back. As she is led off by police, Nabule vows revenge. In the second part, Tsukune is asked by Mr Maui, the head of Maui Industries, to find the person who is trying to kill him. But Akeji Gogoro, a famous detective, also wants the case. The two decide to try and solve another case first, and the one who win gets the case. Tsukune wins with no effort (the culprit readily admits his guilt), but Mr Maui is shot with an arrow. EPISODE 5 In the first part, it is Christmas, and Santa Claus is getting ready to start his deliveries. But when he opens the door, a hand grenade explodes, destroying his shanty. Meanwhile, Tsukune is cleaning up after her Christmas party, when Santa arrives. He explains that someone tried to kill him, before remembering that he must start his deliveries. But his reindeer were wiped out, so Tsukune helps him out by using her broom. As they leave, however, Santa is hit by a sniper: an evil version of Santa named Devil Santa, who wants to deliver presents this year. Luckily, a man named Dr Choromatsu arrives, and turns Santa into a cyborg, with jet wings, drills and underwater jets. The Cyborg- Santa then combines with 4 robotic reindeer to form a large mecha, which defeats Devil Santa by self-destructing. In the second part, Tsukune helps an Indian prince, who gives her three lamps as thanks. When the mayor finds out, he rubs the first two, releasing two genies. The first genie is dead, drowned in lamp oil, so the second brings him back to life and makes him into a human girl (after first making him a GENIE girl) before leaving. The first genie then asks to hear their wishes, but doesn't grant then. A few days later, Tsukune uses the last lamp, and a strange ghost-like genie appears. She makes him do her chores, make green pepper and beef stir-fry, go to China to learn how to cook, and to make her some curry. In the third part, Himeko Kensennuma, an idol, is performing at a concert. A few days later, Tsukune is visited by a stranger who reveals herself as Himeko. She explains that she is being stalked, and needs Tsukune's help. Tsukune disguises herself as Himeko in order to lure out the stalker, but fails. They then head to Himeko's home. Although they fail to find anything suspicious, Dr Choromatsu appears and tells them that his Idol Radar is giving off two signals. The stalker is revealed to be Mika Onigawa, Himeko's idol. She was stalking Himeko as revenge for Himeko stealing her fans, but her own stalkers arrive, and tell her that they never stopped loving her. Mika apologises to Himeko, and the stalkers are arrested. EPISODE 6 In the introduction, Kokoro watches Tsukune combine Boss and Gariko (both from Magical Project S) together in order to fight off a bear. She vows to help people with magic, but she sneezes and causes an explosion. In the first part, we see Tsukune's day: eating breakfast while watching the morning news, bathing, getting dressed, going out to do good deeds (but forgetting her muffler and having to go home), having lunch, doing shopping, saving a popular idol from a giant crow, having dinner, getting ready for bed and sleeping. In the second part, which is filmed in claymation, a monster attacks the city. Tsukune summons a live-action hand to take it and throw it into a claymation toilet. In the third part, Tsukune auditions for a movie, competing with Shioretta and Nabule. When the producers learn that there are three witches, they tell them that whoever saves a falling window cleaner wins. Shioretta tries to catch him on her broom, but Nabule uses her magic to paralyse her. Tsukune uses her magic to teleport the window cleaner, and gets the part. The movie is never shown (except for a few tiny scenes), and Tsukune bids the viewer goodbye.

In conjunction with other supplies such as the Moondarra Reservoir, it provides water for household use, agriculture, industry, and power generation in surrounding areas, particularly in the Latrobe Valley.Southern Rural Water (retrieved 10 June 2007) The lake is also used for recreational activities including fishing, sailing, swimming and picnicking. The lake is surrounded by farmland, bushland and, to the base of Blue Rock Road, the township of Willow Grove. Education The community is serviced by a kindergarten and a public primary school, Willow Grove Primary School. At secondary level, students usually travel by school bus to the nearby towns of Moe, Trafalgar or Warragul/Drouin to attend Lowanna Secondary College, Lavalla Catholic College, Trafalgar High School, Chairo Christian School or Marist-Sion College. Industry The main industry in the Willow Grove area is dairy farming.

They were active in Boston in the 1960s. Maria D'Amato, known after her marriage to Geoff Muldaur as Maria Muldaur, formerly with the Even Dozen Jug Band, joined the band in 1963. During the five years they were together, the jugband successfully modernized the sounds of pre–World War II rural music. Kweskin released six albums and two greatest hits compilations on Vanguard Records between 1963 and 1970; Jim Kweskin's America on Reprise Records in 1971; and four albums on Mountain Railroad Records between 1978 and 1987. Kweskin is probably best known as a singer and bandleader, but he is also known for his guitar stylings, adapting the ragtime-blues fingerpicking of artists like Blind Boy Fuller and Mississippi John Hurt, while incorporating more sophisticated jazz and blues stylings into the mix. In 2013, the band held a reunion tour that included Jim Kweskin, Maria Muldaur, Geoff Muldaur, Richard Greene, Bill Keith, Cindy Cashdollar and Sam Bevan, most of whom were amongst its original members. In the late 1960s, Kweskin joined the Fort Hill Community, which was founded by former Kweskin Jug Band harmonicist Mel Lyman in Boston. In the 1970s, Kweskin recorded some vocals for some Sesame Street inserts, most notably, \\"Ladybugs' Picnic\\". In the 1980s, he stopped recording and performing regularly in order to devote himself to building houses. The Fort Hill Community evolved into the Los Angeles–based Fort Hill Construction, of which Kweskin was a founding partner and where he works as vice president.

He has published three novels in Danish – Krat (1999), Undtagelsen (2004, published as The Exception in 2006), and Du Forsvinder (2012, scheduled to be published as You Disappear in 2014).  Background and education  Jungersen earned a master's in communication and social science from Roskilde University. Before publishing his first novel, he taught film at Folkeuniversitetet, an open university in Copenhagen. He also worked as an advertising copywriter, a manuscript consultant, and a TV screenwriter. Over the past decade he has divided his time among the US, Ireland, Denmark, and Malta.  Krat  Krat (\\"Undergrowth\\") depicts the intense relationship between two men over the course of nearly 70 years. While they begin as bosom buddies in an upper-class suburb of Copenhagen during the 1920s, they end as retirees who, despite not having spoken in decades, remain just as consumed with each other – but now as mortal enemies. Krat was on the Danish bestseller list for three months when it came out in 1999. It won Bogforum's Debutant Prize and was nominated for Weekendavisen’s literary prize. When the Danish Arts Foundation awarded Jungersen a three-year fellowship in 2000, it was the first time in 20 years that the foundation had given the honor to a debut novelist. The Exception A psychological thriller, The Exception (\\"Undtagelsen\\") is told in turn by four women who work for the dysfunctional Danish Center for Genocide Information. When two of them receive death threats, it is unclear whether the threats have been sent by an exposed war criminal or a coworker. Drawing on recent work on the nature of evil, the book makes the case that the same dark impulses that lead to genocide may underlie the bullying that plagues the center's office – and be present in all human beings. The novel was on the bestseller list for a year and a half in Denmark, where it won the P2 Novel Prize and De Gyldne Laurbær (\\"The Golden Laurels\\").denstoredanske.dk Christian Jungersen (The Great Danish Encyclopedia) In 2009, readers of Denmark's largest newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, voted The Exception the second best Danish novel of the past 25 years, and in 2010 it won another readers' poll of the best Danish novel of the preceding decade. The Exception has been published in 18 countries, and has also been adapted for Radio 4. It was nominated for the International Dublin Literary Award, as well as being shortlisted for the Duncan Lawrie Dagger in the United Kingdom, the Grand Prix des Lectrices de Elle in France, and the Martin Beck Award in Sweden. In the US, both The New York Times and Amazon designated the novel as an editor's choice.  You Disappear  Jungersen's latest novel, You Disappear (\\"Du Forsvinder\\"), is narrated by Mia, whose husband Frederik undergoes radical personality changes due to a slowly growing brain tumor that leaves his intellect, speech and motor control intact. Their lives change even more when it comes out that, in the year before his diagnosis, he embezzled 12 million crowns from the private Copenhagen school where he is headmaster. But was the tumor already determining his actions at the time, absolving him, or should he go to jail? In preparing Frederik's defense, Mia immerses herself in the latest brain research, the emerging neurological portrait of human nature, and the classic metaphysical question of free will. Her reading profoundly affects how she responds to Frederik – and to her own passionate impulses. You Disappear has been both a critical and a commercial success in Denmark since being published there in March 2012. Library and newspaper readers awarded it the Læsernes Bogpris, and it was nominated for two other major honors, Politiken's Literature Prize and the Martha Prize, while staying on the top-10 list of bestselling fiction for an entire year. You Disappear was scheduled to be published in an additional 10 countries in 2013 and 2014, with US publication slated for January 2014 from Nan A. Talese/Doubleday.

Solving the Kepler problem is essential to calculate the bending of light by gravity and the motion of a planet orbiting its sun. Solutions are also used to describe the motion of binary stars around each other, and estimate their gradual loss of energy through gravitational radiation. General relativity describes the gravitational field by curved space-time; the field equations governing this curvature are nonlinear and therefore difficult to solve in a closed form. No exact solutions of the Kepler problem have been found, but an approximate solution has: the Schwarzschild solution. This solution pertains when the mass M of one body is overwhelmingly greater than the mass m of the other. If so, the larger mass may be taken as stationary and the sole contributor to the gravitational field. This is a good approximation for a photon passing a star and for a planet orbiting its sun. The motion of the lighter body (called the \\"particle\\" below) can then be determined from the Schwarzschild solution; the motion is a geodesic (\\"shortest path between two points\\") in the curved space-time. Such geodesic solutions account for the anomalous precession of the planet Mercury, which is a key piece of evidence supporting the theory of general relativity. They also describe the bending of light in a gravitational field, another prediction famously used as evidence for general relativity. If both masses are considered to contribute to the gravitational field, as in binary stars, the Kepler problem can be solved only approximately. The earliest approximation method to be developed was the post-Newtonian expansion, an iterative method in which an initial solution is gradually corrected. More recently, it has become possible to solve Einstein's field equation using a computer instead of mathematical formulae. As the two bodies orbit each other, they will emit gravitational radiation; this causes them to lose energy and angular momentum gradually, as illustrated by the binary pulsar PSR B1913+16. For binary black holes numerical solution of the two body problem was achieved after four decades of research, in 2005, when three groups devised the breakthrough techniques. Historical context Classical Kepler problem apsides, the points of closest and farthest distance. The Kepler problem derives its name from Johannes Kepler, who worked as an assistant to the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. Brahe took extraordinarily accurate measurements of the motion of the planets of the Solar System. From these measurements, Kepler was able to formulate Kepler's laws, the first modern description of planetary motion: #The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. #A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. #The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Kepler published the first two laws in 1609 and the third law in 1619. They supplanted earlier models of the Solar System, such as those of Ptolemy and Copernicus. Kepler's laws apply only in the limited case of the two-body problem. Voltaire and Émilie du Châtelet were the first to call them \\"Kepler's laws\\". Nearly a century later, Isaac Newton had formulated his three laws of motion. In particular, Newton's second law states that a force F applied to a mass m produces an acceleration a given by the equation F=ma. Newton then posed the question: what must the force be that produces the elliptical orbits seen by Kepler? His answer came in his law of universal gravitation, which states that the force between a mass M and another mass m is given by the formula : F = G \\\\frac{M m}{r^2} , where r is the distance between the masses and G is the gravitational constant. Given this force law and his equations of motion, Newton was able to show that two point masses attracting each other would each follow perfectly elliptical orbits. The ratio of sizes of these ellipses is m/M, with the larger mass moving on a smaller ellipse. If M is much larger than m, then the larger mass will appear to be stationary at the focus of the elliptical orbit of the lighter mass m. This model can be applied approximately to the Solar System. Since the mass of the Sun is much larger than those of the planets, the force acting on each planet is principally due to the Sun; the gravity of the planets for each other can be neglected to first approximation. Apsidal precession In the absence of any other forces, a particle orbiting another under the influence of Newtonian gravity follows the same perfect ellipse eternally. The presence of other forces (such as the gravitation of other planets), causes this ellipse to rotate gradually. The rate of this rotation (called orbital precession) can be measured very accurately. The rate can also be predicted knowing the magnitudes and directions of the other forces. However, the predictions of Newtonian gravity do not match the observations, as discovered in 1859 from observations of Mercury. If the potential energy between the two bodies is not exactly the 1/r potential of Newton's gravitational law but differs only slightly, then the ellipse of the orbit gradually rotates (among other possible effects). This apsidal precession is observed for all the planets orbiting the Sun, primarily due to the oblateness of the Sun (it is not perfectly spherical) and the attractions of the other planets to one another. The apsides are the two points of closest and furthest distance of the orbit (the periapsis and apoapsis, respectively); apsidal precession corresponds to the rotation of the line joining the apsides. It also corresponds to the rotation of the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector, which points along the line of apsides. Newton's law of gravitation soon became accepted because it gave very accurate predictions of the motion of all the planets. These calculations were carried out initially by Pierre-Simon Laplace in the late 18th century, and refined by Félix Tisserand in the later 19th century. Conversely, if Newton's law of gravitation did not predict the apsidal precessions of the planets accurately, it would have to be discarded as a theory of gravitation. Such an anomalous precession was observed in the second half of the 19th century. Anomalous precession of Mercury In 1859, Urbain Le Verrier discovered that the orbital precession of the planet Mercury was not quite what it should be; the ellipse of its orbit was rotating (precessing) slightly faster than predicted by the traditional theory of Newtonian gravity, even after all the effects of the other planets had been accounted for. The effect is small (roughly 43 arcseconds of rotation per century), but well above the measurement error (roughly 0.1 arcseconds per century). Le Verrier realized the importance of his discovery immediately, and challenged astronomers and physicists alike to account for it. Several classical explanations were proposed, such as interplanetary dust, unobserved oblateness of the Sun, an undetected moon of Mercury, or a new planet named Vulcan. After these explanations were discounted, some physicists were driven to the more radical hypothesis that Newton's inverse-square law of gravitation was incorrect. For example, some physicists proposed a power law with an exponent that was slightly different from 2. Others argued that Newton's law should be supplemented with a velocity-dependent potential. However, this implied a conflict with Newtonian celestial dynamics. In his treatise on celestial mechanics, Laplace had shown that if the gravitational influence does not act instantaneously, then the motions of the planets themselves will not exactly conserve momentum (and consequently some of the momentum would have to be ascribed to the mediator of the gravitational interaction, analogous to ascribing momentum to the mediator of the electromagnetic interaction.) As seen from a Newtonian point of view, if gravitational influence does propagate at a finite speed, then at all points in time a planet is attracted to a point where the Sun was some time before, and not towards the instantaneous position of the Sun. On the assumption of the classical fundamentals, Laplace had shown that if gravity would propagate at a velocity on the order of the speed of light then the solar system would be unstable, and would not exist for a long time. The observation that the solar system is old enough allowed him to put a lower limit on the speed of gravity that turned out to be many orders of magnitude faster than the speed of light.Pais 1982 Laplace's estimate for the velocity of gravity is not correct in a field theory which respects the principle of relativity. Since electric and magnetic fields combine, the attraction of a point charge which is moving at a constant velocity is towards the extrapolated instantaneous position, not to the apparent position it seems to occupy when looked at.Feynman Lectures on Physics vol. II gives a thorough treatment of the analogous problem in electromagnetism. Feynman shows that for a moving charge, the non-radiative field is an attraction/repulsion not toward the apparent position of the particle, but toward the extrapolated position assuming that the particle continues in a straight line in a constant velocity. This is a notable property of the Liénard–Wiechert potentials which are used in the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory. Presumably the same holds in linearized gravity: e.g., see Gravitoelectromagnetism. To avoid those problems, between 1870 and 1900 many scientists used the electrodynamic laws of Wilhelm Eduard Weber, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Bernhard Riemann to produce stable orbits and to explain the perihelion shift of Mercury's orbit. In 1890 Lévy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt Paul Gerber (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypotheses were rejected.Roseveare 1982 Another attempt by Hendrik Lorentz (1900), who already used Maxwell's theory, produced a perihelion shift which was too low. Einstein's theory of general relativity Eddington's 1919 measurements of the bending of star-light by the Sun's gravity led to the acceptance of general relativity worldwide. Around 1904–1905, the works of Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincaré and finally Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, exclude the possibility of propagation of any effects faster than the speed of light. It followed that Newton's law of gravitation would have to be replaced with another law, compatible with the principle of relativity, while still obtaining the Newtonian limit for circumstances where relativistic effects are negligible. Such attempts were made by Henri Poincaré (1905), Hermann Minkowski (1907) and Arnold Sommerfeld (1910).Walter 2007 In 1907 Einstein came to the conclusion that to achieve this a successor to special relativity was needed. From 1907 to 1915, Einstein worked towards a new theory, using his equivalence principle as a key concept to guide his way. According to this principle, a uniform gravitational field acts equally on everything within it and, therefore, cannot be detected by a free-falling observer. Conversely, all local gravitational effects should be reproducible in a linearly accelerating reference frame, and vice versa. Thus, gravity acts like a fictitious force such as the centrifugal force or the Coriolis force, which result from being in an accelerated reference frame; all fictitious forces are proportional to the inertial mass, just as gravity is. To effect the reconciliation of gravity and special relativity and to incorporate the equivalence principle, something had to be sacrificed; that something was the long-held classical assumption that our space obeys the laws of Euclidean geometry, e.g., that the Pythagorean theorem is true experimentally. Einstein used a more general geometry, pseudo-Riemannian geometry, to allow for the curvature of space and time that was necessary for the reconciliation; after eight years of work (1907–1915), he succeeded in discovering the precise way in which space-time should be curved in order to reproduce the physical laws observed in Nature, particularly gravitation. Gravity is distinct from the fictitious forces centrifugal force and coriolis force in the sense that the curvature of spacetime is regarded as physically real, whereas the fictitious forces are not regarded as forces. The very first solutions of his field equations explained the anomalous precession of Mercury and predicted an unusual bending of light, which was confirmed after his theory was published. These solutions are explained below. General relativity, special relativity and geometry In the normal Euclidean geometry, triangles obey the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square distance ds2 between two points in space is the sum of the squares of its perpendicular components : ds^{2} = dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where dx, dy and dz represent the infinitesimal differences between the x, y and z coordinates of two points in a Cartesian coordinate system (add Figure here). Now imagine a world in which this is not quite true; a world where the distance is instead given by : ds^{2} = F(x, y, z) dx^{2} + G(x, y, z) dy^{2} + H(x, y, z)dz^{2} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where F, G and H are arbitrary functions of position. It is not hard to imagine such a world; we live on one. The surface of the earth is curved, which is why it's impossible to make a perfectly accurate flat map of the earth. Non-Cartesian coordinate systems illustrate this well; for example, in the spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ), the Euclidean distance can be written : ds^{2} = dr^{2} + r^{2} d\\\\theta^{2} + r^{2} \\\\sin^{2} \\\\theta d\\\\varphi^{2} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! Another illustration would be a world in which the rulers used to measure length were untrustworthy, rulers that changed their length with their position and even their orientation. In the most general case, one must allow for cross-terms when calculating the distance ds : ds^{2} = g_{xx} dx^{2} + g_{xy} dx dy + g_{xz} dx dz + \\\\cdots + g_{zy} dz dy + g_{zz} dz^{2} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where the nine functions gxx, gxy, …, gzz constitute the metric tensor, which defines the geometry of the space in Riemannian geometry. In the spherical-coordinates example above, there are no cross-terms; the only nonzero metric tensor components are grr = 1, gθθ = r2 and gφφ = r2 sin2 θ. In his special theory of relativity, Albert Einstein showed that the distance ds between two spatial points is not constant, but depends on the motion of the observer. However, there is a measure of separation between two points in space-time — called \\"proper time\\" and denoted with the symbol dτ — that is invariant; in other words, it doesn't depend on the motion of the observer. : c^{2} d\\\\tau^{2} = c^{2} dt^{2} - dx^{2} - dy^{2} - dz^{2} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! which may be written in spherical coordinates as : c^{2} d\\\\tau^{2} = c^{2} dt^{2} - dr^{2} - r^{2} d\\\\theta^{2} - r^{2} \\\\sin^{2} \\\\theta d\\\\varphi^{2} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! This formula is the natural extension of the Pythagorean theorem and similarly holds only when there is no curvature in space-time. In general relativity, however, space and time may have curvature, so this distance formula must be modified to a more general form : c^{2} d\\\\tau^{2} = g_{\\\\mu u} dx^{\\\\mu} dx^{ u} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! just as we generalized the formula to measure distance on the surface of the Earth. The exact form of the metric gμν depends on the gravitating mass, momentum and energy, as described by the Einstein field equations. Einstein developed those field equations to match the then known laws of Nature; however, they predicted never-before-seen phenomena (such as the bending of light by gravity) that were confirmed later. Geodesic equation According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, particles of negligible mass travel along geodesics in the space-time. In uncurved space-time, far from a source of gravity, these geodesics correspond to straight lines; however, they may deviate from straight lines when the space-time is curved. The equation for the geodesic lines isWeinberg 1972. : \\\\frac{d^2x^{\\\\mu}}{d q^2} + \\\\Gamma^{\\\\mu}_{ u\\\\lambda} \\\\frac{dx^{ u}}{d q} \\\\frac{dx^{\\\\lambda}}{dq} = 0 where Γ represents the Christoffel symbol and the variable q parametrizes the particle's path through space-time, its so-called world line. The Christoffel symbol depends only on the metric tensor gμν, or rather on how it changes with position. The variable q is a constant multiple of the proper time τ for timelike orbits (which are traveled by massive particles), and is usually taken to be equal to it. For lightlike (or null) orbits (which are traveled by massless particles such as the photon), the proper time is zero and, strictly speaking, cannot be used as the variable q. Nevertheless, lightlike orbits can be derived as the ultrarelativistic limit of timelike orbits, that is, the limit as the particle mass m goes to zero while holding its total energy fixed. Schwarzschild solution An exact solution to the Einstein field equations is the Schwarzschild metric, which corresponds to the external gravitational field of a stationary, uncharged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass M. It is characterized by a length scale rs, known as the Schwarzschild radius, which is defined by the formula :: r_{s} = \\\\frac{2GM}{c^{2}} where G is the gravitational constant. The classical Newtonian theory of gravity is recovered in the limit as the ratio rs/r goes to zero. In that limit, the metric returns to that defined by special relativity. In practice, this ratio is almost always extremely small. For example, the Schwarzschild radius rs of the Earth is roughly 9 mm ( inch); at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion. The Schwarzschild radius of the Sun is much larger, roughly 2953 meters, but at its surface, the ratio rs/r is roughly 4 parts in a million. A white dwarf star is much denser, but even here the ratio at its surface is roughly 250 parts in a million. The ratio only becomes large close to ultra-dense objects such as neutron stars (where the ratio is roughly 50%) and black holes. Orbits about the central mass Comparison between the orbit of a test particle in Newtonian (left) and Schwarzschild (right) spacetime. Please click for high resolution animated graphics. The orbits of a test particle of infinitesimal mass m about the central mass M is given by the equation of motion : \\\\left( \\\\frac{dr}{d\\\\tau} \\\\right)^{2} = \\\\frac{E^{2}}{m^{2}c^{2}} - \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{r_{s}}{r} \\\\right) \\\\left( c^{2} + \\\\frac{h^{2}}{r^{2}} \\\\right). where h is the specific relative angular momentum, h = r \\\\times v = { L \\\\over \\\\mu } and \\\\mu is the reduced mass. This can be converted into an equation for the orbit : \\\\left( \\\\frac{dr}{d\\\\varphi} \\\\right)^{2} = \\\\frac{r^{4}}{b^{2}} - \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{r_{s}}{r} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{r^{4}}{a^{2}} + r^{2} \\\\right), where, for brevity, two length-scales, a = \\\\frac{h}{c} and b = \\\\frac{Lc}{E}, have been introduced. They are constants of the motion and depend on the initial conditions (position and velocity) of the test particle. Hence, the solution of the orbit equation is : \\\\varphi = \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{r^2} \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{b^2} - \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{r_\\\\mathrm{s}}{r}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{a^2} + \\\\frac{1}{r^2} \\\\right)\\\\right]^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} dr. Effective radial potential energy The equation of motion for the particle derived above : \\\\left( \\\\frac{dr}{d\\\\tau} \\\\right)^{2} = \\\\frac{E^2}{m^2 c^2} - c^{2} + \\\\frac{ r_{s} c^2}{r} - \\\\frac{h^2}{ r^2 } + \\\\frac{ r_{s} h^2 }{ r^3 } can be rewritten using the definition of the Schwarzschild radius rs as : \\\\frac{1}{2} m \\\\left( \\\\frac{dr}{d\\\\tau} \\\\right)^{2} = \\\\left[ \\\\frac{E^2}{2 m c^2} - \\\\frac{1}{2} m c^2 \\\\right] \\\\+ \\\\frac{GMm}{r} - \\\\frac{ L^2 }{ 2 \\\\mu r^2 } + \\\\frac{ G(M+m) L^2 }{c^2 \\\\mu r^3} which is equivalent to a particle moving in a one-dimensional effective potential : V(r) = -\\\\frac{GMm}{r} + \\\\frac{ L^2 }{ 2 \\\\mu r^2 } - \\\\frac{ G(M+m) L^2 }{ c^2 \\\\mu r^3 } The first two terms are well-known classical energies, the first being the attractive Newtonian gravitational potential energy and the second corresponding to the repulsive \\"centrifugal\\" potential energy; however, the third term is an attractive energy unique to general relativity. As shown below and elsewhere, this inverse-cubic energy causes elliptical orbits to precess gradually by an angle δφ per revolution : \\\\delta \\\\varphi \\\\approx \\\\frac{ 6\\\\pi G(M+m) }{ c^2 A \\\\left( 1 - e^{2} \\\\right)} where A is the semi-major axis and e is the eccentricity. Here δφ is not the change in the φ-coordinate in (t, r, θ, φ) coordinates but the change in the argument of periapsis of the classical closed orbit. The third term is attractive and dominates at small r values, giving a critical inner radius rinner at which a particle is drawn inexorably inwards to r = 0; this inner radius is a function of the particle's angular momentum per unit mass or, equivalently, the a length-scale defined above. Circular orbits and their stability Effective radial potential for various angular momenta. At small radii, the energy drops precipitously, causing the particle to be pulled inexorably inwards to r = 0. However, when the normalized angular momentum a/rs = L/mcrs equals the square root of three, a metastable circular orbit is possible at the radius highlighted with a green circle. At higher angular momenta, there is a significant centrifugal barrier (orange curve) and an unstable inner radius, highlighted in red. The effective potential V can be re-written in terms of the length a = h/c: : V(r) = \\\\frac{mc^{2}}{2} \\\\left[ - \\\\frac{r_{s}}{r} + \\\\frac{a^{2}}{r^{2}} - \\\\frac{r_{s} a^{2}}{r^{3}} \\\\right]. Circular orbits are possible when the effective force is zero: : F = -\\\\frac{dV}{dr} = -\\\\frac{mc^{2}}{2r^{4}} \\\\left[ r_{s} r^{2} - 2a^{2} r + 3r_{s} a^{2} \\\\right] = 0; i.e., when the two attractive forces—Newtonian gravity (first term) and the attraction unique to general relativity (third term)—are exactly balanced by the repulsive centrifugal force (second term). There are two radii at which this balancing can occur, denoted here as rinner and router: :\\\\begin{align} r_{\\\\mathrm{outer}} &= \\\\frac{a^{2}}{r_{s}} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{a^{2}}} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ r_{\\\\mathrm{inner}} &= \\\\frac{a^{2}}{r_{s}} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{a^{2}}} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{3a^{2}}{r_{\\\\mathrm{outer}}}, \\\\end{align} which are obtained using the quadratic formula. The inner radius rinner is unstable, because the attractive third force strengthens much faster than the other two forces when r becomes small; if the particle slips slightly inwards from rinner (where all three forces are in balance), the third force dominates the other two and draws the particle inexorably inwards to r = 0. At the outer radius, however, the circular orbits are stable; the third term is less important and the system behaves more like the non-relativistic Kepler problem. When a is much greater than rs (the classical case), these formulae become approximately :\\\\begin{align} r_{\\\\mathrm{outer}} &\\\\approx \\\\frac{2a^{2}}{r_{s}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ r_{\\\\mathrm{inner}} &\\\\approx \\\\frac{3}{2} r_{s} \\\\end{align} The stable and unstable radii are plotted versus the normalized angular momentum a/rs = L/mcrs in blue and red, respectively. These curves meet at a unique circular orbit (green circle) when the normalized angular momentum equals the square root of three. For comparison, the classical radius predicted from the centripetal acceleration and Newton's law of gravity is plotted in black. Substituting the definitions of a and rs into router yields the classical formula for a particle of mass m orbiting a body of mass M. The following equation : r_{\\\\mathrm{outer}}^{3} = \\\\frac{G(M+m)}{\\\\omega_{\\\\varphi}^{2}} where ωφ is the orbital angular speed of the particle, is obtained in non- relativistic mechanics by setting the centrifugal force equal to the Newtonian gravitational force: : \\\\frac{GMm}{r^{2}} = \\\\mu \\\\omega_{\\\\varphi}^{2} r Where \\\\mu is the reduced mass. In our notation, the classical orbital angular speed equals : \\\\omega_{\\\\varphi}^{2} \\\\approx \\\\frac{GM}{r_{\\\\mathrm{outer}}^{3}} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{r_{s} c^{2}}{2r_{\\\\mathrm{outer}}^{3}} \\\\right) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{r_{s} c^{2}}{2} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{r_{s}^{3}}{8a^{6}}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{c^{2} r_{s}^{4}}{16 a^{6}} At the other extreme, when a2 approaches 3rs2 from above, the two radii converge to a single value : r_{\\\\mathrm{outer}} \\\\approx r_{\\\\mathrm{inner}} \\\\approx 3 r_{s} The quadratic solutions above ensure that router is always greater than 3rs, whereas rinner lies between rs and 3rs. Circular orbits smaller than rs are not possible. For massless particles, a goes to infinity, implying that there is a circular orbit for photons at rinner = rs. The sphere of this radius is sometimes known as the photon sphere. Precession of elliptical orbits In the non-relativistic Kepler problem, a particle follows the same perfect ellipse (red orbit) eternally. General relativity introduces a third force that attracts the particle slightly more strongly than Newtonian gravity, especially at small radii. This third force causes the particle's elliptical orbit to precess (cyan orbit) in the direction of its rotation; this effect has been measured in Mercury, Venus and Earth. The yellow dot within the orbits represents the center of attraction, such as the Sun. The orbital precession rate may be derived using this radial effective potential V. A small radial deviation from a circular orbit of radius router will oscillate in a stable manner with an angular frequency : \\\\omega_{r}^{2} = \\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{d^{2}V}{dr^{2}} \\\\right]_{r=r_{\\\\mathrm{outer}}} which equals : \\\\omega_{r}^{2} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{c^{2} r_{s}}{2 r_{\\\\mathrm{outer}}^{4}} \\\\right) \\\\left( r_{\\\\mathrm{outer}} - r_{\\\\mathrm{inner}} \\\\right) = \\\\omega_{\\\\varphi}^{2} \\\\sqrt{1 - \\\\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{a^{2}}} Taking the square root of both sides and expanding using the binomial theorem yields the formula : \\\\omega_{r} = \\\\omega_{\\\\varphi} \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{4a^{2}} + \\\\cdots \\\\right) Multiplying by the period T of one revolution gives the precession of the orbit per revolution : \\\\delta \\\\varphi = T \\\\left( \\\\omega_{\\\\varphi} - \\\\omega_{r} \\\\right) \\\\approx 2\\\\pi \\\\left( \\\\frac{3r_{s}^{2}}{4a^{2}} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{3\\\\pi m^{2} c^{2}}{2L^{2}} r_{s}^{2} where we have used ωφT = 2π and the definition of the length-scale a. Substituting the definition of the Schwarzschild radius rs gives : \\\\delta \\\\varphi \\\\approx \\\\frac{3\\\\pi m^{2} c^{2}}{2L^{2}} \\\\left( \\\\frac{4G^{2} M^{2}}{c^{4}} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{6\\\\pi G^{2} M^{2} m^{2}}{c^{2} L^{2}} This may be simplified using the elliptical orbit's semi-major axis A and eccentricity e related by the formula : \\\\frac{ h^2 }{ G(M+m) } = A \\\\left( 1 - e^2 \\\\right) to give the precession angle : \\\\delta \\\\varphi \\\\approx \\\\frac{6\\\\pi G(M+m)}{c^2 A \\\\left( 1 - e^{2} \\\\right)} Since the closed classical orbit is an ellipse in general, the quantity A(1 − e2) is the semi-latus rectum l of the ellipse. Hence, the final formula of angular apsidal precession for a unit complete revolution is : \\\\delta \\\\varphi \\\\approx \\\\frac{6\\\\pi G(M + m)}{c^2 l} Beyond the Schwarzschild solution Diagram of the parameter space of compact binaries with the various approximation schemes and their regions of validity. Post-Newtonian expansion In the Schwarzschild solution, it is assumed that the larger mass M is stationary and it alone determines the gravitational field (i.e., the geometry of space-time) and, hence, the lesser mass m follows a geodesic path through that fixed space-time. This is a reasonable approximation for photons and the orbit of Mercury, which is roughly 6 million times lighter than the Sun. However, it is inadequate for binary stars, in which the masses may be of similar magnitude. The metric for the case of two comparable masses cannot be solved in closed form and therefore one has to resort to approximation techniques such as the post-Newtonian approximation or numerical approximations. In passing, we mention one particular exception in lower dimensions (see R=T model for details). In (1+1) dimensions, i.e. a space made of one spatial dimension and one time dimension, the metric for two bodies of equal masses can be solved analytically in terms of the Lambert W function. However, the gravitational energy between the two bodies is exchanged via dilatons rather than gravitons which require three-space in which to propagate. The post-Newtonian expansion is a calculational method that provides a series of ever more accurate solutions to a given problem. The method is iterative; an initial solution for particle motions is used to calculate the gravitational fields; from these derived fields, new particle motions can be calculated, from which even more accurate estimates of the fields can be computed, and so on. This approach is called \\"post-Newtonian\\" because the Newtonian solution for the particle orbits is often used as the initial solution. When this method is applied to the two-body problem without restriction on their masses, the result is remarkably simple. To the lowest order, the relative motion of the two particles is equivalent to the motion of an infinitesimal particle in the field of their combined masses. In other words, the Schwarzschild solution can be applied, provided that the M + m is used in place of M in the formulae for the Schwarzschild radius rs and the precession angle per revolution δφ. Modern computational approaches Einstein's equations can also be solved on a computer using sophisticated numerical methods. Given sufficient computer power, such solutions can be more accurate than post-Newtonian solutions. However, such calculations are demanding because the equations must generally be solved in a four-dimensional space. Nevertheless, beginning in the late 1990s, it became possible to solve difficult problems such as the merger of two black holes, which is a very difficult version of the Kepler problem in general relativity. Gravitational radiation If there is no incoming gravitational radiation, according to general relativity, two bodies orbiting one another will emit gravitational radiation, causing the orbits to gradually lose energy. The formulae describing the loss of energy and angular momentum due to gravitational radiation from the two bodies of the Kepler problem have been calculated. The rate of losing energy (averaged over a complete orbit) is given byLandau and Lifshitz, p. 356-357. : -\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{dE}{dt} \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{32G^{4}m_{1}^{2}m_{2}^{2}\\\\left(m_{1} + m_{2}\\\\right)}{5c^{5} a^{5} \\\\left( 1 - e^{2} \\\\right)^\\\\frac{7}{2}} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{73}{24} e^{2} + \\\\frac{37}{96} e^{4} \\\\right) where e is the orbital eccentricity and a is the semimajor axis of the elliptical orbit. The angular brackets on the left-hand side of the equation represent the averaging over a single orbit. Similarly, the average rate of losing angular momentum equals : -\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{dL_{z}}{dt} \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{32G^\\\\frac{7}{2}m_{1}^{2}m_{2}^{2}\\\\sqrt{m_{1} + m_{2}}}{5c^{5} a^\\\\frac{7}{2} \\\\left( 1 - e^{2} \\\\right)^{2}} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{7}{8} e^{2} \\\\right) The rate of period decrease is given by : -\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{dP_{b}}{dt} \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{192 \\\\pi G^\\\\frac{5}{3}m_{1}m_{2}\\\\left(m_{1} + m_{2}\\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{1}{3}}}{5c^{5} \\\\left( 1 - e^{2} \\\\right)^\\\\frac{7}{2}} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{73}{24} e^{2} + \\\\frac{37}{96} e^{4} \\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{P_{b}}{2 \\\\pi}\\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{5}{3}} where Pb is orbital period. The losses in energy and angular momentum increase significantly as the eccentricity approaches one, i.e., as the ellipse of the orbit becomes ever more elongated. The radiation losses also increase significantly with a decreasing size a of the orbit.

He succeeded his father, Muhammadu Dikko, as Emir, and was succeeded by his son, Muhammadu Kabir Usman. Education Nagogo commenced his education under Islamic scholar Attahiru, who taught the future Emir and his brother in Katsina's Gambarawa Quarters. He commenced his elementary education in 1921 at Katsina Provincial School, but was interrupted by his father's visit to England, where the two met King George V of the United Kingdom. He graduated from the provincial school in 1923, after which he taught there for six months. Political career and reign as Emir Nagogo was appointed to position of Native Authority Police Chief in 1929; during his term he expanded the police department by erecting new buildings and hiring more officers. In 1937, he became the District Head of Katsina Metropolis. Nagogo was officially installed as the tenth Emir of Katsina by Arthur Richards, Governor of Northern Nigeria, on May 19, 1944, although he had succeeded his deceased father to the position in March. The same year, he visited England, Egypt, India, and Burma; in Burma, he met with Nigerians in the Royal West African Frontier Force (fighting for the United Kingdom as part of the Chindits). On January 12, 1946, King George VI of the United Kingdom appointed him as a federal minister of the colony. He was a regional minister without portfolio from 1952 until the military coup of 1966, which one of his sons, Hassan Katsina was involved in. Life President of the Nigerian Polo Association, Nagogo was one of pioneers of indigenous Nigerian polo; as of 2002, his handicap of +7 is still the highest of any African. He was at one point chairman of Muslim religious organization Jama'atu Nasril Islam (JNI). Family Nagogo's mother was Hassatu, from Katsina.

He was portrayed by Simon Williams. James Bellamy is one of the main characters in Upstairs, Downstairs, appearing in 37 episodes, from the third episode of the first series \\"Board Wages\\" to the penultimate episode of the fifth and final series \\"All the King's Horses\\". Handsome, arrogant, irresponsible, and selfish, James is his mother's favourite, and he never truly recovers from her death on the Titanic in 1912. After a few unsuccessful relationships, James marries Hazel Forrest, but their happiness is short-lived due to their disparate backgrounds; she dies in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. James serves in the Great War, but is seriously wounded at Passchendaele on the Western Front in 1917, and subsequently never finds a purpose in life or a true love. He commits suicide in 1929, after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash. Early life James Rupert Bellamy is born in one of the summer months of 1881 or 1882 (Lady Prudence, an old family friend, reminds his father that he is 30 years of age when he proposes to Hazel in November 1912, in the episode \\"A Family Secret\\", however Hawkesworth explicitly states in the first novelisation of the shows scripts that James is 23 years old in 1904 making 1881 more than likely his birth year), the first child of Richard, a Conservative MP and Lady Marjorie Bellamy, the daughter of the 12th Earl of Southwold. He has a sister Elizabeth who is born in 1886 (or 1887). James goes to Eton and then attends the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and by 1904 he has been commissioned as a Lieutenant in the Life Guards in the British Army. James is his mother's favourite, while he has a difficult relationship with his father, who finds his son weak and irresponsible. Fiancé with Lady Cynthia  James was the fiancé of Cynthia Cartwright ( portrayed by Jessica Benton ) in the episode \\"The Path of Duty\\". His sister Elizabeth and Cynthia Cartwright have their coming out ball in May 1905 at Londonderry House. Elizabeth was due to be presented to the King and Queen by her Aunt Kate (Lady Castleton), but she runs away from the Ball. Cynthia, James, Richard and Majorie don't know what to do at the ball without Elizabeth. Affair with Sarah In about 1908, James, by now a Captain, enters an affair with the former house maid Sarah, who is now a music hall singer and who attends Elizabeth's wedding. Soon, Sarah becomes pregnant by James, who is in debt of around £1350. Sarah gives him some of her earnings. James's regiment in Windsor contacts his parents about his debts, and he then confesses everything to them. The family solicitor, Sir Geoffrey Dillon, arranges for Sarah to be sent to Lady Marjorie's family home, Southwold, and for James to be transferred to India with the Sind Horse Regiment, although Lady Marjorie is furious that James has been sent abroad. While he is gone, in the early months of 1909, Sarah returns to Eaton Place, fed up with life at Southwold. The same night she returns, Sarah gives birth to a boy, who dies almost immediately. Fiancé with Phyllis Kingman  When James returns from India in May 1910, he brings home with him a well-meaning middle-class, Army Veterinarian Major's daughter named Phyllis Kingman, to whom he has become engaged. The engagement does not last, however, as he later admits he does not love her, nor believes she would have fitted in. Marriage with Hazel In early March 1912, Richard hires a secretary, Hazel Forrest, and James quickly takes an interest in her. While his parents are away one week-end in April (right before Lady Marjorie's ill-fated trip aboard the Titanic), James insists that Hazel lunch with him in the Dining Room, much to butler Hudson's disapproval. After about seven months of courting, James proposes in November, but Hazel tearfully refuses him. This causes Hazel's father, Arthur Forrest, to visit James. He explains that Hazel was previously married to a drunk, Patrick O'Connor, who beat her. They divorced and Hazel moved back in with her parents. Mr. Forrest wants his daughter to be happy, while the prickly Mrs. Forrest is sure the Bellamys would never accept Hazel as a divorced woman. James asks Hazel again, and after talking and James letting Hazel know his own sister Elizabeth is a divorced and remarried woman, she accepts his second proposal. They marry in late 1912 or early 1913, and honeymoon in Paris. The middle-class Hazel has difficulty adapting to James' upper-class world. On a hunting weekend to Somerby, Lord Newbury's country house, the other guests encourage her to surprise James and join the hunt, something she has never done before. However, Diana Newbury, a childhood friend of James, had secretly swapped the horses and gives Hazel a spirited horse that bolts and runs away with Hazel, who escapes largely uninjured. She and James then argue as he feels humiliated. This, in addition to Major Cochrane-Danby claiming that James and Diana are sleeping together, leads Hazel to flee Somerby with Rose. James follows her back to London when he discovers she has left, and they soon make up. In mid-1914, Hazel suffers a miscarriage. By now, James had left the Army and was working for Jardines in London and plans to transfer to India in 1915, until the Great War intervenes. James and Hazel's relationship quickly deteriorates, and by August 1914, they are sleeping in separate bedrooms. The often-unfaithful James has also grown increasingly fond of Georgina, his step- cousin and father's ward, who had arrived to live at Eaton Place right before Christmas in December 1913. The Great War As the start of the Great War approaches, James is recalled up to service as he is on the Army's Reserve of Officers. He serves at the Western Front and fights in the Second Battle of Ypres. In April 1915, he returns home on leave, and during a dinner at which Sir Geoffrey Dillon is present, makes comments about the incompetent running of the war. These comments are soon published in The Daily Mail, and while the comments are unattributed, it is soon traced to James, who is transferred to become General staff Officer, a post miles behind the front line, much against James's wishes. The following year, while again home on leave, Hazel sees how unhappy he is, and she secretly asks the colonel to transfer James back to the Front Line. The colonel agrees, and James is reassigned to the Guards Division of the Machine Gun Corps. When Georgina arrives in France as a VAD nurse in June 1916, she arrives at her hospital and meets James, who is now a Major. They spend the day together, and before they part at the end of the day, they kiss. For his part in the Battle of the Somme, James is awarded the Military Cross. In October 1917, James participates in one of the many skirmishes in the Battle of Passchendaele and is reported \\"missing believed killed\\". After ten days, he turns up seriously wounded at Georgina's hospital. Against Georgina's advice, Richard and Hazel take him back to London in a private ambulance (a converted limousine provided by James' maternal grandmother, the old Dowager Duchess of Southwold). When back home and talking to Richard, he tells him about his ten days missing; a German officer was about to shoot him when he found him injured in a shell hole, but, for some unknown reason, he did not, and gave James the chance to shoot him instead. James also says that he felt his mother's presence while in the shell hole. James sees no further active service for the rest of the war. On 8 November 1918, days before its end, Hazel dies during the Spanish flu pandemic, and is buried on Armistice Day. Post-war years After the war, James has difficulty adapting to life outside the army. In February 1920, he writes a letter to The Times regarding the treatment of former soldiers. On the strength of that letter, he is persuaded to stand as Conservative candidate in an upcoming by-election in the Docklands seat of Rotherhithe East, a safe Labour seat. While he loses the election, he reduces the Labour majority and Conservative Central Office want him to stand again. However, he has no further interest in politics. A chance encounter with Diana Newbury, his former flame and wife of his best friend, in May 1923 leads to them going to stay in a country cottage together for a week. They then decide to almost-elope, however, a note left by Diana to Bunny is read earlier than expected and before they can leave Britain, Richard finds out and insists James returns to London. While Bunny says that Diana may divorce him if that is what she truly wants, James and Diana agree that time has moved on and they could not live together. In 1927 or 1928, while holidaying in Scotland, James tells Georgina that he loves her. But she says that she does not love him in that way anymore, and early the next morning he leaves without saying goodbye to anybody. He then goes to Liverpool and sails to New York City to stay with Elizabeth, who had moved there with her husband Dana around 1911. James does not return until October 1929, and has more money thanks to the stock market. However, on 24 October, the stock market crashes and James loses his entire fortune. Days before he had encouraged Rose to invest the £1200 she had received from Gregory Wilmot in his will, and she too loses all her money. He and Richard have a heated argument about this, as James cannot repay Rose the money she has lost, and how James has failed to make anything of himself despite his upbringing and all his advantages. James privately goes to a hotel in Maidenhead and commits suicide by shooting himself.

The bumblebee on the right side of the flower cluster (and near its middle) sets the scale of the photograph. Malosma is a plant genus which contains only a single species, Malosma laurina, with the common names laurel sumac and lentisco (Spanish).Integrated Taxonomic Information System (2007). Malosma, retrieved June 10, 2007. Malosma laurina is found along the southern California and Baja California coasts of the Pacific Ocean. Description Fruits of Malosma laurina.Malosma laurina is a large, rounded evergreen shrub or small tree growing 3 to 5 meters (10–15 feet) tall. The leaves have a taco shell shape. When flattened, they have the shape of laurel leaves, with lance-shaped leaf blades up to 10 cm (4\\") long. The tips of the stems, little stem attaching the leaf to the stems (petiole), the veins of the leaves, and the edges of the leaves, are a glowing reddish color all year long. The fragrant leaves and stems give chaparral its characteristic fragrance. The leaves and stems are full of volatile compounds that give it the scent. Laurel sumac has adapted to fire return intervals of 50-100+ years in the chaparral areas where it grows, and after a fire burns its above ground parts, a large burl underground resprouts new stems and leaves. In southern California where it grows, the winters are relatively wet and the summers are dry (a Mediterranean climate). The laurel sumac grows new leaves and stems all year long, even during dry season. Most other plants where it grows stop growing leaves during the summer dry season and focus their energies on their root systems. The fragrant saps flow through laurel sumac all year to supply the leaves. One effect of this is that laurel sumac is one of the first plants that resprout after a fire, before the winter rains cause other plants to stop being dormant for the dry season. Another effect is that the parasitic plant (a plant that grows into other plants, not the soil) California dodder (Cuscuta californica), which dies in the summer on other plants, can be seen covering laurel sumac in large stringy \\"cobwebs\\" of yellow/orange color. Laurel sumac is sensitive to cold and tolerates extended freezing conditions poorly. Orange growers in the early history of southern California used to pick places to plant their oranges based on where laurel sumac was growing because this indicated it would not get too cold for oranges if laurel sumac could grow there. The very small flowers have five white petals and five-lobed green sepals. Large clusters of these flowers occur at the ends of twigs in late spring and early summer. The clusters (panicles) are 7–15 cm (3 to 6 \\") long, and are reminiscent of lilac (see photo).Howard, Janet L. (1992). Malosma laurina, in: Fire Effects Information System, [Online].

Although few of his compositions survive, he is widely considered one of the best keyboard composers of the early 17th century.Ferrard, Grove. Life Very little is known about Cornet's life. Much of the information comes from a letter by his widow.Apel, 339. Cornet was born in Brussels, which was then the capital of Southern Netherlands, in the 1570s. The family included numerous musicians, among them a violinist, singers and organists. From 1603 to 1606 Cornet worked as organist at Saint Nicholas Church, Brussels; around 1606 he became court organist to Albert VII, Archduke of Austria and his wife Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain, also in Brussels. For one month, in March 1611, Cornet was a canon at Soignies, but he gave up his canonry to marry. Cornet is listed as chapel organist in the surviving court account books from 1612–1618. His colleagues included important English composers Peter Philips (who acted as godfather to one of Cornet's childrenJames Jonhstone. Liner notes to \\"Peeter Cornet. Keyboard Music\\", GAUDEAMUS CD GAU 335. Cited online.) and John Bull, as well as fellow Flemish composers Géry Ghersem and Matthijs Langhedul. Apparently Cornet was also active as an organ consultant and builder. In 1615 he provided advice concerning the organ of St. Rumbolds Cathedral (Sint- Romboutskathedraal) in Mechelen, and in 1624 he signed a contract to build a choir division for the same organ. Works Cornet's surviving output is small and consists only of keyboard music: eight fantasias, two courantes (with variations), a toccata, a setting of Salve Regina, and one of Tantum Ergo. One of the fantasias, Fantasia del 5. tuono sopra ut re mi fa sol la, survives incomplete. The style varies from animated, bright music of the courantes, to elaborate polyphony in the fantasias and the mystical, religious feeling of the Salve Regina setting. The fantasias use the Italian ricercare structure, with its imitative treatment of the subjects in several sections. However, Cornet prefers to use a large number of subjects (up to six) or relies on a double subject (a subject the two halves of which can be used as separate subjects); consequently, most of the fantasias are rather large works. The style shows the influence of English virginal music, with unexpected fast runs and characteristic figurations (in some fantasias ornaments are even notated using the English symbol: two oblique bars), with the exception of wide skips, broken octaves, and other virtuosic figures such as those found in Bull's and Farnaby's music. A characteristic feature is Cornet's use of rhythmic changes. In sharp contrast to his famed contemporary Sweelinck, who developed a pedantic, systematic approach to applying changes such as augmentation or diminution to the subject, Cornet prefers to only use the techniques where they seem appropriate, and avoids schematic treatment. An augmented version of a subject, for instance, will not simply double all the note values, but rather double some, triple another, leave another intact, etc. The presentation of the subject is almost always varied.Apel, 340. The settings of Salve Regina and Tantum Ergo exhibit similar characteristics. The former comprises five sections (Salve, Ad te clamamus, Eia ergo, O clemens, Pro fine). The first three are fugues on the initial motifs of the corresponding lines, the fourth is a cantus firmus setting with the melody first stated in the soprano and then in the tenor, and the fifth combines the subject and its inversion. As in the fantasias, figural elements are seamlessly woven into the polyphonic fabric.Apel, 342. Cornet's courantes are both modelled on English examples. One is followed by three variations of the entire piece.Apel, 343. The only surviving toccata by Cornet consists entirely of various figurations, including among them the then-fashinable echo effect, frequently used by Sweelinck but only encountered here in Cornet's oeuvre.Apel, 341–342.

This term was originally coined by W.M. Wheeler (1927), while describing the defensive technique exhibited by insects. Wheeler observed the positioning of specially modified body structures to block nest entrances, as exhibited in various insect species. The term phragmosis has since been further extended beyond just insects. Examples of phragmosis are found in the order Anura (frog). Some species, such as Pternohyla fodiens and Corythomantis greeningi, have evolved a peculiarly casqued head adapted to protect the animal as it backs down a hole. Another example is the head-plug defense used by the aphid Astegopteryx sp., in which a banana-bunch shaped gall consisting of several subgalls is used as a barrier. Arguably, the most commonly observed phragmotic behaviour is within the ant genera. The behaviour is displayed in numerous species such as Camponotus, Colobostruma, Crematogaster, Pheidole, Blepharidatta, Cephalotes pusillus, Carebara elmenteitae, Stenamma expolitum, in which the soldiers have unusually large, disc-shaped heads, which are used to block nest entrances against intruders.  In Anura   Corythomantis greeningi  Anurans involve a diverse group of largely carnivorous, short-bodied, tailless amphibians. Within this group, some frogs are characterized by a peculiar casqued head, with the skin co-ossified with the underlying bones. This type of skull is generally associated with phragmotic behaviour, where the animal will enter a hole and block the entrance with its head. Recent studies of Corythomantis greeningi, a casque-headed tree frog from semi-arid areas, have provided substantial information regarding the water economy associated with co-ossification of the head. Due to the arid environments of most casque- headed anurans, it has been proposed that head co-ossification, together with phragmotic behaviour confer protection against water loss. Upon further investigation, it has been found that cranial co-ossification contributes little to conservation of water, but instead has a primary role of defence. This type of skull morphology primarily acts to protect the animal against predators, and in doing so, leads to an indirect enhancement of water balance within the body. In the study conducted by Jared et al. (1999) and Navas, Jared & Antoniazzi (2002), C. greeningi demonstrated the ability to enter test tubes backwards and close the entrance with their heads, a behaviour termed 'experimental phragmosis'. The study found that while phragmotic behaviour does not provide a significant reduction in water evaporation, it is important for preventing desiccation. It was concluded that in C. greeningi, the co- ossified head likely evolved originally as a protective lid for phragmotic individuals, but does aid in reducing water permeability through the head.  Pternohyla fodiens  The Mexican hylid casque-headed frog, Pternohyla fodiens, utilizes the head casque to close the entrance of its refuge in a tree cavity by deflecting the head. Due to their frequent foraging on the ground, this species often makes use of vertical burrows already extant in the ground layer as well. Upon arrival of intruder, P. fodiens assumes an immobile position – the head tipped back, with the entire body assumed in a gentle arch. The eyes close tightly, fore-legs are brought forward and upward, and hind-legs are flexed upward. By exhibiting the phragmotic habit during this interaction, it is more likely to effectively avoid predation.  In gall- forming aphids  Aphid gall on Ulmus minorThe aphid Astegopteryx sp. exhibits a head-plugging defense by forming a banana-bunch shaped gall, consisting of several subgalls, on Styrax benzoin. The soldier aphids of Astegopteryx are characterized by their sclerotic, protruded heads, covered in many spine-like setae. Several soldiers cooperate with one another to plug the ostiole of the subgall, utilizing their specialized morphology. In a study by Kurosu et al. (2005), of 173 ostioles examined, 90.8% were plugged, with no space among the guarding soldiers. Of the 90.8% plugged ostioles, several male intruders were found outside the phragmotic plug, attempting to enter. All intruders were blocked by the guarding soldiers, and it was nearly impossible to enter the subgall. Astegopteryx soldiers effectively defend their subgall by plugging the ostiole nearly completely with their sclerotic, spiny heads, which are very likely to have evolved for that purpose.  In ants  Ant queen excavating hole Phragmotic-headed ants prevent intruders from entering nests by blocking the entrances, or by pushing them out of entrance galleries. Within the Neotropical species, Blepharidatta conops, queens are characterized by shield-like heads, and appear to secrete fibrous material. The material acts as a coating and eventually accumulates into a dense tangle of material, creating a disk over the head. When nests are visited, or inhabited by predators (especially beetles), the entrance is quickly blocked by the peculiar phragmotic disk of the queen. This modification of the body enables the queen to act as a living gate to the brood chamber. Phragmosis in ants has evolved independently in the diverse ant genera Camponotus Mayr (Colobopsis, Hypercolobopsis), Cephalotes Latreille, Colobostruma Wheeler (C. leae), Crematogaster Lund (Colobocrema), Pheidole Westwood (P. colobopsis, P. lamia), but also in other genera, such as Blepharidatta Smith, (B. conops), Tetraponera Smith (T. phrag- motica) and Carebara Westwood. The behaviour is most developed in the genus Cephalotes, where all castes (both queens and workers), have highly adapted head morphologies. The shield-like armor which characterizes this behaviour enables plugging of nest entrances, without exposing eyes, antenna or mandibles to any potential intruders.  In spiders  The trapdoor spider Cyclocosmia has an abdomen ending in a hardened disc that it uses to plug the entrance to its burrow.* , & (2006): Rare spiders of the genus Cyclocosmia (Arachnida: Araneae: Ctenizidae) from tropical and subtropical China.

Overview Jorge Manrique Political, religious, literary, and military relations between Italy and Spain from the second half of the 15th century provided a remarkable cultural interchange between those two countries. The papacy of two illustrious Valencians, Calixto III (Alfonso de Borja) and Alejandro VI (Rodrigo de Borja y Oms), narrowed cultural relations between Castile, Aragón, Catalonia, and Rome. The Spanish literary works of greatest prominence were published or translated in Italy. This was the case with Amadís of Gaula, The Celestina, Jail of Love, the poetic compositions of Jorge Manrique, Íñigo López de Mendoza, 1st Marquess of Santillana and popular productions such as romances, carols, etc. The same thing happened in Spain with Italian works, among them the Jerusalén liberada of Torquato Tasso. Hispanic-Italian relations were very important, since they brought to the Iberian Peninsula the intellectual ferment and tastes that precipitated the Spanish Renaissance. The Spanish Renaissance began with the unification of Spain by the Catholic Monarchs and included the reigns of Carlos I and Felipe II. For this reason, it is possible to distinguish two stages: * Reign of Carlos I: New ideas are received and the Italian Renaissance is imitated. * Reign of Felipe II: The Spanish Renaissance withdraws into itself and its religious aspects are accentuated. With respect to ideology, the Renaissance mentality is characterized by: * Esteem of the Greco-Latin world, in the light of which a new, more secular scale of values for the individual is sought. * Humanity is the focal point of the universe (anthropocentrism), able to dominate the world and to create its own destiny. * Reason precedes sentiment; balance, moderation and harmony prevail. * The new ideal man is the courtier, capable as poet and soldier. * A new conception of beauty that idealizes the present world (as opposed to heaven) not as it is, but as it should be in terms of nature, woman, and love. The Spanish Renaissance Classically, 1492 is spoken of as the beginning of the Renaissance in Spain; nevertheless it is complex to consider a date, due to the multiple circumstances that happened. The situation of Spain was always very complex but even so the humanism managed to maintain its innovating characteristics, in spite of the interferences that limited the study of the classic works. An important fact is the heterogeneity of the population, a fact that dates from the year 711 when part of the peninsula was conquered by the Muslims, whose last governors were expelled from the last of their possessions in 1492 during the Reconquista. Later, the period was characterized by its vitality and renovation. The Inquisition became an organ which also depended on the State and not only on the Church. One can speak of erudition since the Catholic Monarchs. Within this period the first important author is Antonio de Nebrija (1442–1522), with his Spanish grammar. In 1492, he published the first book of grammar in the Spanish language (titled Gramática Castellana in Spanish), which was the first grammar produced by any Romance language. At this time, Castilian became Spanish, the official language of Spain, replacing Latin. A great patron during the Renaissance was cardinal Gonzalo Jiménez de Cisneros, whose humble origin contrasts with his austere character and with the fact that he put his greatest effort in reforming the indisciplined customs of the religious orders. He thought that the reform had to be the fruit of an educational reform, and although not an erudite, he was the maximum protector of the new studies. In 1498 he founded the University of Alcalá de Henares, that surpassed in prestige and influence all the others except the University of Salamanca, its greatest rival. The direction of his reform agreed partly with the ideas of Erasmus in a moment in which these were the booming doctrines in Europe and Spain. Bartolomé de las Casas During this time a work like the one by Pedro Mexía was common, who compiled miscellaneous scientific information. It is an example of the Renaissance tendency towards idealization, because of the conviction that wisdom could be extracted from the common people, whose pure tradition was thought to have conserved it, because people had always been close to nature. Within the idealism and the humanism of the Renaissance the controversies of the colonial activity of Spain in the New World are very well represented. The main promoter was the Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas (1474–1566), who had as basic principles: that war is irrational and opposite to civilization; that force does not have to be used against the native people, because even forced conversion to Christianity is reprehensible; that the irrationality and freedom of man demand that religion and all the other of its forms be taught only by means of a smooth and amiable persuasion. The resurgence of the new spirit of the Renaissance is incarnated by Francisco de Vitoria (1483–1546), Dominican theologian, professor at Salamanca, who rejected all argumentation based on pure metaphysical considerations because he was in favour of the study of the real problems raised by the political and social contemporary life. He was among the first to establish the basic concepts of the modern international law, based on the rule of natural law. He affirmed fundamental liberties, such as freedom of speech, communication, commerce. But these liberties were inherent to human society, within which the natives were not considered because they were underdeveloped communities, without political organization nor commerce. Consequently, he advocated a mandate system where the inferior races had to be governed by superior races, a doctrine based on natural servility, and so if the uncivilized nations refused to be voluntarily subjugated, the war was morally legitimate. With Erasmus, the spirit of tolerance dies in Spain, as no reconciliation or commitment between Protestants and Catholics was reached, and the Counter-Reformation began; religious unity was persecuted, even within Christianity itself, so the Renaissance had finished. Nevertheless, the Spanish religiousness maintained its own parameters thanks to a new order, the Company of Jesus, founded by San Ignacio de Loyola (1491–1556). Also Neoplatonism arrived in Spain, coming from Italy. The Renaissance poetry Fernando de Herrera (1599) by Francisco Pacheco. The poetry of this period is divided in two schools: the Salmantine (e.g. Fray Luis de León) and the Sevillian (e.g. Fernando de Herrera). The Salmantine School has as distinguishing characteristics: * concise language; * ideas expressed simply; * realistic themes; and * preference for short verse. However, the Sevillian school is: * grandiloquent; * extremely polished; * focused on meditation rather than feeling, more about documentation than about observation of nature and life; * composed of long, complex verses; and * filled with adjectives and rhetorical language. However, this second school served as immediate base and necessary bridge to connect with the poetic movements that in the 17th century were included under the general denomination of Baroque. The Renaissance lyric is originated from: * The tradition, which perpetuates themes and forms of the medieval lyric. This tradition is made up of the traditional lyric, oral and popular (carols, love songs...) and the not-written lyric transmitted by the Romancero, as much as of the cultured lyric (of authors like Juan de Mena or Íñigo López de Mendoza, 1st Marquess of Santillana) and the courtesan lyric of troubadour roots gathered in the song books of which the most famous was the one of Hernando de Acuña. This traditional poetry is bound to the use of the short verse, especially eight syllables. * The innovating current rooted in Petrarch and therefore italianizing, that will mature thanks to Boscán and Garcilaso. This current drinks in fact of the same sources as the previous one: the Provençal lyric. They handle therefore the same conception of the love as a service that dignifies the enamored one. Its characteristics are: * Concerning the metric used, verses (eleven syllables), strophes (lyre) and poems (sonnet) coming from Italy are adopted. Characteristic genres as the égloga (the protagonists are idealized shepherds), ode (for serious matters) or the epistle (poem in form of letter) also appear. * The language at this time is dominated by the naturalness and simplicity, fleeing from the affectation and the carefully searched phrase. Thus the lexicon and the syntax are simple. * The subjects preferred by the Renaissance poetry are, fundamentally, the love, conceived from the platonic point of view; the nature, as something idyllic (bucolic); pagan mythology, of which histories of Gods are reflected; and the feminine beauty, always following the same classical ideal. In relation to these mentioned subjects, several Renaissance topics exist, some of them taken from the classical world: ** The Carpe diem, whose translation would be \\"seize the day\\" or \\"take advantage of the moment\\". With it the enjoyment of the life before the arrival of the oldness is advised. ** The feminine beauty, described always following the same scheme: young blonde, of clear, calm eyes, of white skin, red lips, rosy cheeks, etc. ** The Beatus Ille or praise of the life in the field, apart from the material world, as opposed to the life in the city, with its dangers and intrigues. ** The Locus amoenus or description of a perfect and idyllic nature. With respect to imitation and originality in the Renaissance poetry, the Renaissance poet used the models of the nature; on this base he did not put into doubt the necessity of imitating, because these procedures were justified by coming not from the reproduction of models, but from the same spirit that gathered other thoughts. If other people's creations, unavoidably dispersed because of being multiple, are recast into a unique creation, and if the spirit of the writer shines in it, nobody will be able to deny the qualification of original to it. There was a self- satisfaction component, since the sources gave prestige to the one that discovered them. Those searches mostly meant a struggle between the old and the modern, to exhibit the own culture. The writer of the time assumed the imitation as the center of his activity. The absolute originality constituted a remote ideal that was not refused, but it was not postulated to themselves demandingly, because it was a privilege granted to very little people, and in addition the possibility of reaching it with imitative means existed. In the imitation one must go to several sources that must be transformed and reduced to unit. Garcilaso de la Vega Garcilaso de la Vega In the lyric poetry of the first half of the 16th century, this critic recognizes several parallel currents that converge in two great lines. * Traditional: which perpetuates the themes and forms coming from the medieval tradition. It includes the traditional lyric (carols, little songs of love, romance texts, etc.) as much as the song book poetry of the 15th century in its loving and didactic moral side. It is bound to the use of short verses, specially the verse with eight syllables. * Italianizing: more innovative, introducing the Petrarchian- inspired poetic models which were popular in Renaissance Italy to Spain. It reflects the development of the innovations of Juan Boscán and Garcilaso, according to the pattern of the Italian cultured lírica of their time. It is bound to the use of eleven syllables, the sonnet and diverse strophes derived from the Petrarch-like song. A rigid dichotomy between the two currents is inappropriate since both descend from the common source of Provençal poetry. In the Spanish lyric a Petrarch-like climate already existed, coming from the troubadour background that the poets of the new style had taken up in Italy. The rise of the italianizing lyric has a key date: in 1526 Andrea Navagiero encouraged Juan Boscán to try to put sonnets and other strophes used by good Italian poets into Castilian. In Italy, enthusiasm about Greco-Latin works brought about a resurgence of feeling for the bucolic as well, in addition to the pastoral stories of the Golden Age and other classical myths that could be used to communicate feelings of love. Garcilaso de la Vega (1501–1536) was a courtesan and soldier in imperial times. It is virtually impossible to reconstruct his external life without autobiographical details inspired in greater part by the Portuguese Isabel Freire, passing first through jealousy at her wedding, and later through the pain of her death. The poetry of Garcilaso is linked with the names of three other influences: Virgil, Petrarch and Sannazaro (from Virgil, he takes the expression of feeling; from Petrarch, metre and the exploration of mood; and from Sannazaro, the artistic level). He stood out because of the expressive richness of his verses. The poetic trajectory of Garcilaso is forged by the experiences of a spirit shaken between contradictory impulses: to bury oneself in conformity or to take refuge in the beauty of dreams. But these states of the soul encountered traditional literary forms, which moulded the sentimental content and expression, intensifying or filtering them. Garcilaso begins to concern himself with the beauty of the outer world, with feminine beauty, with the landscape. Elements of a new style are present, that impel him to idealize love, enshrining it as a stimulus of spirituality. Juan Boscán Boscán, that had cultivated previously the courtesan lyric, introduced the Italian eleven-syllable verse and strophes, as well as the reasons and structures of Petrarch-like poetry in the Castilian poetry. The poem Hero and Leandro of Boscán is the first that deals with classic legendary and mythological themes. On the other hand, his Epistle to Mendoza introduces the model of the moral epistle in Spain, where he exposes the ideal of the stoic wise person. In addition, Boscán demonstrated his dominion of the Castilian by translating Il Cortegiano (1528) of the Italian humanist Baldassare Castiglione in a Renaissance model prose. In addition, he prepared the edition of the works of Garcilaso de la Vega, although he died before being able to culminate the project, reason why his widow printed the work in 1543 with the title The works of Boscán with some of Garcilaso of Vega. Other poets Within the so-called traditional line, the figure of Cristóbal de Castillejo stands out, whose loving poems, fit to the topics of the courteous love, and satires have been admired. He has been perceived as a person full of the ideal of Erasmo and gifted with a moral superiority over the courtesan baseness. In his work there is a mixture of comedy and moral. He was against the Italianizing school, and headed the defense of the national language of the new empire, that postulated that this language would surpass and revitalize the insubstantialness and affectation of the Castilian songs of his time, already moved away from the previous models. This vitality meant the incorporation of folkloric and traditional elements, the populist Erasmo-like tendency of the proverb and the colloquy, and the literary linguistic nationalism. Religious literature The Renaissance imposes a division between the natural and the supernatural things, as opposed to the Middle Ages in which they were mixed in such form that God, the Virgin and the Saints took part in all type of worldly subjects with appearances and miracles. At this new time, there are worldly writers, like Garcilaso de la Vega, and authors who express religious feelings solely, as much in verse as in prosa. In the Renaissance these feelings are developed and declared widely, strongly impelled by the Counter-Reformation, the fight against the Protestant Reformation, on which the Spanish Universal Monarchy and the catholic church insisted. The religious literature can be manifested in treaties in prose on spiritual matters (like The names of Christ of fray Luis of León), or in poems loaded of spirituality (San Juan de la Cruz). The forms of religious life, denominated \\"ascetic\\" and \\"mystic\\", were expressed in both ways. * The ascetic tries to perfect the people urging them to strictly fulfill the Christian obligations, and instructing them on it. Important writers are fray Luis de Granada (1504-1588), San Juan de Ávila (1500-1569) and fray Juan de los Ángeles (1536-1609). * The mystic tries to express the prodigies that some privileged people experiment in their own soul when entering in communication with God. The mystics preferredly wrote in verse (San Juan de la Cruz), although they did not renounce to the prose (Santa Teresa de Jesús). Fray Luis de León Fray Luis de León Fray Luis de León (Cuenca, Spain, 1527 - 1591) was a Spanish Augustinian friar. In 1561 he obtained a chair in Theology at the University of Salamanca. His major works in prose are: * The Perfect Wife, which advises all young women on the proper behavior and duties of a married woman. * The Names of Christ, a guide to the layman about the essential principles of the Church. * A translation of the Song of Songs. He was denounced to the Inquisition for translating it and he was imprisoned for four years. * A Commentary on the Book of Job, aiming to make the Scripture available to those who could not read Latin. His most important poetic works are twenty-three poems, among them: * The Life Removed, about the peace, happiness, and liberty assured to those who travel the hidden path. * Ode to Salinas, written for his friend Francisco de Salinas. San Juan de la Cruz San Juan de la Cruz (John of the Cross) San Juan de la Cruz (Ávila, 1542–1591) was a Carmelite friar. He studied philosophy at the University of Salamanca. He cooperated with Saint Teresa of Avila in the reformation of the Carmelite order. In 1577, following his refusal to relocate after his superior's orders, he was jailed in Toledo, and later freed. His two most important poems are: * The Spiritual Canticle, an eclogue in which the bride (representing the soul) searches for the bridegroom (representing Jesus Christ). * The Dark Night of the Soul, that narrates the journey of the soul from her bodily home to her union with God. He also wrote three treatises on mystical theology and the Ascent of Mount Carmel, a more systematic study of the ascetical effort of a soul looking for perfect union with God. Santa Teresa de Jesús Santa Teresa de Jesús Santa Teresa de Jesús (Ávila, 1515 - 1582) was a Carmelite nun. She entered the monastery leaving her parents' home secretly. She experienced periods of spiritual ecstasy through the use of the devotional book. Various friends suggested that her knowledge was diabolical, not divine, but her confessor reassured her of the divine inspiration of her thoughts. She was very active as a reformer of her order, and she founded many new convents. Her most important writings are: * Her Autobiography, The Life of Teresa of Jesus. * The Way of Perfection. * The Interior Castle, where she compared the soul with a castle. * Relations, an extension of her autobiography. Other smaller works are Concepts of Love and Exclamations. Besides, the Letters. The Renaissance prose As it is logical, great part of the narrative subgenera of the 15th century continued to be alive throughout the 16th century (for example, the sentimental novels of the late fifteenth / early sixteenth century --particularly Juan de Flores's Grisel y Mirabella, Diego de San Pedro's Cárcel de amor and Fernando de Rojas's La Celestina -- continued to enjoy enormous European success); nevertheless, there are three that deserve special attention: the pastoral novel, didactic prose, and religious prose. The pastoral novel is of Italian origin, like the sentimental novel. About the year of 1558 the first Spanish text pertaining to this genre appeared: La Diana, written by Jorge de Montemayor. The success of this type of narrative encouraged great authors of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, such as Lope de Vega (La Arcadia) and Miguel de Cervantes (La Galatea), to cultivate it. During the reign of Felipe II, which includes the years from 1557 to 1597, the religious literature had its greater boom in Spain. The religiosity of the monarch, the spirit of the Counterreformation and the customs of the time were part in the extraordinary importance that this genre reached. The didactic and religious literature is very vast, because it includes: * The Apologetics, which displays arguments for the religion; * The Ascetic, that tends to instil the rules of the moral; and * The Mystic, that searches for the knowledge of God within the own spirit, by means of the contemplation and the meditation. The production of the mystics of the 16th century is of great importance, mainly for the growth and robustness of the language. El Lazarillo de Tormes El Lazarillo de Tormes The picaresque novel, as literary genre, has the following characteristics: * The story is autobiographical. * The narration follows a chronological order. * The irony and the dialogue are two of the most used resources to develop the argument and to express the critic in the book. * The protagonist is a rascal; that is to say: ** he belongs to the lower social class, being almost a delinquent; ** he is a vagabond; ** he acts induced by the hunger; ** he looks for the way to improve his life; ** he lacks ideals. The Lazarillo, of anonymous author, was published in 1554 and narrates the life of a boy, Lázaro de Tormes, from his birth until he marries the servant of an archpriest in Toledo. Throughout that time he serves several masters who mistreat him and give him very little to eat. As already said, this book inaugurates the picaresque novel and it stands out within the production of the literature of the Golden Century because of its originality, since it represents a literature based on the reality, as opposed to the idealism or the religiosity of the literature of the time and immediately previous (books of cavalries, sentimental novel, etc.) Concerning the technique used, it can be emphasized the fact that the episodes are articulated through the wire of the life of the rascal.

It is a member of the Macau Catholic Schools Association. History At the beginning of the 20th century, a Portuguese man named Jesus met a representative from the Macau Catholic church after receiving and accepting an invitation from the parish bishop in regards to doing some missionary work in the Chinese Gaoyao County. This man Jesus gained knowledge about the local culture and learnt about the Christ gospel conformity. In 1917 the Guangdong Province Zhaoqing government office organization began to educate young children. In 1950 the school had to abandon its operations due to the chaos caused by war and the political situation at the time. During this period Jesus met a priest by the name of Father Ge Chentung after travelling through many parts of the countryside and eventually arriving in Macau. Whilst he was in Macau, he witnessed the economic depression and saw the impact it had on the innumerable impoverished families of the region. He then decided to build a school similar to the one in Macau and manage its operations. He named it the Sea Star Middle school, it was located in one of the main streets of Macau. He provided free elementary education for poor students who couldn't afford education elsewhere. He spread the gospel and witnessed to anyone that would listen, he also imitated Kong Zi and taught people from all walks of life without discriminating against them. Up until 1959, Father Ge followed orders assigned to him from Portugal. In 1959, Father Tan met other palm sea star school principals. From 1964 to 1974, Shengje Yu the Chinese zither made repairs to the courtyard adding additional class rooms. In July, 1975, the church parish bishop appointed church parish Father Liu Chihch'ao to the position of assistant director. The school continued to operate until it was dismantled in 1955. A new school was constructed and the Ministry of Education Centre was also set up and operational. The sea star middle school gradually became notable within the community, a preschool was also established along with an elementary school. In 1997, due to high unemployment within the large population of Macau, Father Tan held the Jesus meeting once again. This resulted in the junior middle school degree diploma, the night four, center five and center six curricula being added to the school program. 46 years on and the Sea Star Middle School is still running. The Jesus meeting is held regularly, some topics discussed are \\"the promotion of justice, services for the poor\\" free education and positive school spirit. The motto is to teach all comers without discrimination in abidance with the school policy. The aim of the school is to help publicize the gospel of Christ and to use this as an example for all students. Some of the other programs are personality education, development of human nature and the thorough study of science. Youth education is the principal duty. In July, 2002, Father Tan came up with plans for future renovations. The changes were made by Mr. Cai Tzuyu, who holds the duty of third palm principal.

He was active in the Caucasus and Central Asia during the Russian Civil War. For the last 66 years of his life he was known as Ronald Sinclair. Early life Teague-Jones was born in Lancashire. He was brought up in St. Petersburg, capital of Imperial Russia. His father was a language teacher and died when Reginald was still a child. He was educated at a German-run school that specialised in languages where he learned French, German and Russian, and at Bedford School between 1905 and 1907. He later spent two years studying at King's College London, but left without taking a degree. Indian intelligence officer In 1910, at the age of 21, he joined the Indian Police and was soon transferred to the (British) Indian government's Foreign and Political Department, an organisation that had trained earlier players in the so-called Great Game, the clandestine struggle for influence in Central Asia between the Russian and British empires during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Here he became involved in intelligence work on the North West Frontier, undertaking missions in disguise and adding Persian to his knowledge of languages. World War I and the Russian Civil War In 1917 he was moved to military intelligence at G.H.Q. Delhi and given responsibility for the Persian Gulf. The war in the Middle East was now entering a critical stage with the collapse of Russian forces following the October Revolution and the creation of a power vacuum in the Caucasus. As 1918 dawned, a reinvigorated Turkish force, the Ottoman Army of Islam under Enver Pasha began advancing on Baku, much to the alarm of the British, who envisaged Enver's army crossing the Caspian, sweeping through Transcaspia (Russia's southernmost Central Asian possession) and on to India by way of Afghanistan. Teague-Jones was now despatched on an intelligence- gathering mission to Transcaspia via the British garrison commanded by Wilfrid Malleson at Meshed to find out what resistance to the Turks could be expected. Crossing the Kopet Dagh mountains in disguise in July, he spent the next six months between Meshed, Baku and the Transcaspian capital Ashkhabad, where he found the Bolsheviks had been overthrown days earlier and replaced by the Transcaspian Government, claiming allegiance to the Social Revolutionaries. He was appointed British political representative in Ashkhabad as a small British force, the Malleson Mission, arrived from Persia to aid resistance against the Turks and to fend off attacks by the Bolsheviks from Tashkent. Here he remained until the withdrawal of this force began early in 1919 The 26 Baku Commissars Isaak Brodsky's The Execution of the Twenty Six Baku Commissars depicting the Soviet view of the execution. As a result of his involvement in Transcaspian politics, his name became linked to the murder of the 26 Baku Commissars. The commissars had escaped across the Caspian after the fall of Baku in September 1918, and had been taken prisoner by White Russians at Krasnovodsk. They were then shot in the desert between Krasnovodsk and Ashkhabad in mysterious circumstances on 20 September. In 1919, and again in 1922, the Social Revolutionary lawyer Vadim Chaikin claimed these murders had been carried out under the direct orders of Teague-Jones. In November 1922 Teague-Jones produced a 1,500-word rebuttal of Chaikin's claims which was passed by the British Foreign Office to the Soviet Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. However, Chaikin's version of events was later endorsed by Trotsky and was upheld by Soviet historians until the collapse of the USSR. Change of identity Teague-Jones changed his name in 1922 and all reference to him in Foreign Office files ceased after the end of 1922. For the next 66 years until his death, he was known as Ronald Sinclair. In 1926 he undertook a trip by car across Persia, ostensibly in the interests of a British business consortium. The trip is widely held to have been undertaken in a Ford Model A , but this is clearly impossible, as the model did not go on sale until December 1927. His account of this trip, Adventures in Persia was published in 1988 just before his death. As Ronald Sinclair, he later served as Vice-Consul in New York from 1941 until his retirement shortly after the war. It has been suggestedHopkirk (1994), pp 396 – 399 that his change of identity was intended either to protect him from Soviet vengeance for the death of the Baku commissars, or to provide cover for future intelligence operations. Evidence that he had worked for MI5 was found in his possessions at the time of his death, and it seems likely that both his 1926 Persian trip and his diplomatic position in New York were fronts for intelligence work. Death He died on 16 November 1988, as Ronald Sinclair at a private nursing home in Plymouth, England. An obituary appeared in The Times on 22 November, alerting Peter Hopkirk, a historian of the Great Game, who was researching Teague-Jones at the time. As a result, Hopkirk immediately wrote a second obituary for The Times revealing his true identity.

It is native to western China, but is occasionally encountered in northern European gardens. Description Ailanthus vilmoriniana is a tree that often attains heights of 20 metres or more with a crown spread of 15 metres. The new shoots occasionally have small green spines. The leaves are quite similar to those of A. altissima, but they are darker in colour and pendulous. The rachis is finely pubescent and is a consistent deep red in colour. It is also longer, being up to 1 metre long on pollards, and with more leaflets, usually numbering 23 to 35, though they have sometimes as few as 20. The leaves are pubescent beneath. The bole itself occasionally will have sprouts emerging from it. Cultivation The downy tree of heaven was first grown in the United Kingdom in 1897, but it is rarely found in gardens within the British Isles. It is occasionally encountered in plant collections as well as gardens in the south of England. Specimens are also present as far north as the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh.

Ahlenius was born in Karlstad, Sweden. She holds a degree in business administration from the Stockholm School of Economics and started her career working in the economic secretariat of Sweden's largest commercial bank, Handelsbanken. Between 1968 and 1993 she held various posts at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Finance in Sweden, including as head of the Budget Department from 1987. Since 1993 she has been a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences. She served as Auditor General of the Swedish National Audit Office from 1993 to 2003. There was some controversy when her term as Auditor General was over where she made several statements to media including that some of the government's proposed changes to the Audit Office would limit its ability to act independently. In connection with this the minister of finance claimed \\"she wished another assignment\\", which she claimed was on his initiative and that she in reality was fired. After this the parliament took the responsibility of assigning Auditor General. Later in 2003 she served as Auditor General of Kosovo. The previous controversy from 2003 was noted by Swedish media since Mrs. Ahlenius was proposed for the position by the United States and not by her native Sweden. During her terms as Auditor General she held several international positions. She chaired the INTOSAI Auditing Standards Committee for eight years, and was chairman of the Governing Board of the European Organization for Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) during 1993 to 1996. Ahlenius was also a member of the Committee of Independent Experts that was called for by the European Parliament with a mandate to examine the way in which the European Commission detects and deals with fraud, mismanagement and nepotism. Their report led to the resignation of the Commission. Ahlenius was appointed Under-Secretary-General for United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services for a five-year term starting on 15 July 2005.

In fact, others claimed that it came from his long string of failures in winning public office, and the nickname stuck because, for members of the mainstream parties, it left the impression of Weller as a Luddite in a world of economic progress, or a doomsayer in a time of general prosperity.Dubuque Herald, January 9, 1884. But his tariff views were very much those of the revenue reformers on the Democratic side of the aisle. As a farmer with experience in paying exorbitant prices on what he bought and getting low world-market prices for what he sold, Weller had special reasons for offering a bill to remove the duty on barbed wire. Contrary to his public image, Weller did not war on all banks, or even on the national banking system itself. He limited his objection to those banks' power to issue currency of their own, and this, too, was a position which many Democrats had long shared, and which found favor among prominent economists far from the radical camp, including Professor William Graham Sumner at Yale University. Weller also favored a bill that would allow the trade-dollar to be redeemed at the vault as bullion and to be recoined \\"into the dollar of the daddies.\\" Critics pointed out that such a measure was superfluous. As presently constituted, trade-dollars already could be melted down into bullion by anyone desiring to do so, and then, under the Bland-Allison Act, converted into silver dollars.Dubuque Herald, December 1, 1883. Weller soon found himself depicted as a blatherskite and upbraided for a series of quotations, some of which were taken out of context from his remarks, and some of which he had never said. Republican editors described him as the enemy of all banks and corporations, and when he charged that a cattle inspection bill had been written \\"in the interest of the cattle ring,\\" was accused of having called for changes in the law to make it be exactly that. In fact, Weller had tried to amend the bill in favor of farmers and small shippers, and ultimately voted for the bill in hopes that the Senate would amend it for the better.Dubuque Herald,March 5, 1884. Weller sought re-election in 1884 and had faithful support from Democrats, and though he was defeated by Republican nominee William E. Fuller, failed by barely two hundred votes. No more mainstream Democratic contender would do as well for the next six years. In all, Weller served in Congress from March 4, 1883 to March 3, 1885. Later career and death After leaving Congress, he was the proprietor and editor of the Farmers’ Advocate, a weekly paper in Independence, Iowa. Weller served as a delegate to the People’s Party national committee from 1890 to 1914, and served as president of the Chosen Farmers of America. Joining this Populist Party, he resisted any coalition with the Democrats and strongly opposed the party's endorsement of William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896. A \\"middle of the roader,\\" as opponents of fusion were called, he led an increasingly forlorn hope in a state where Populism had never done all that well. He was twice an unsuccessful candidate for justice of the Iowa Supreme Court. He was also an unsuccessful candidate of the People’s Party for Governor of Iowa in 1901. He died on March 2, 1914 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery, near Nashua in Chickasaw County, Iowa.

Biography He was born in Herschdorf, in present-day Thuringia. In his Zur Geschichte des Orgelspiels (1884), August Gottfried Ritter gives 30, Oct. 1660 as birth date, and \\"nach 1740\\" as time of death. Vetter first studied music with Georg Caspar Wecker in Nuremberg and was a student at the Rudolstadt Gymnasium from 1683 to 1688. He then moved to Erfurt to study with Johann Pachelbel, succeeding him as organist of the Predigerkirche when he left for Stuttgart in 1690; during this time, he may have attended the University of Erfurt. He was succeeded by J.H. Buttstedt in July 1691, when he went to Rudolstadt to take up a position as castle organist; he was later honoured with the appointments of Government Advocate, Church Procurator and Master Over The Page Boys. His surviving compositions are now few, since World War II led to the destruction of all his free organ compositions and a work for chorus and orchestra entitled Zum frohen Empfang Grossherzogs Carl Fürsten Primas. The manuscript Mus.40035 of the Deutsche Staatsbibliothek, Berlin, gave his name as the composer of variations three and eight of the organ partita on \\"Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr\\", BWV 771, formerly attributed to J.

Along with William Flinn (1851-1924), his political partner, the two ran the Republican Party machine that controlled the city for the last twenty years of the 19th century. Early life He was born in Pittsburgh and was educated in the Pittsburgh Public Schools and the Western University of Pennsylvania, today's University of Pittsburgh. When his father died, he became an office boy for the iron manufacturing firm of Park, McCurdy, and Company. By 1864 he took a job in the city controller's office, and in 1869 a better position in the city treasurer's office. Politics Magee came from a large family which was prominent in local politics. His uncle, Squire Thomas Steele, had been president of city council and also had run the office of controller. Through Steele's influence, Magee obtained his first jobs in government. At age 22 Magee ran on the Republican ticket for city treasurer, but lost. In 1873, however, he won. He then helped to pass a bill revising property assessments upward, and another bill to collect from tax delinquents. Magee cut city debt in half during his term. In 1879, in the city's Sixth Ward, one of Magee's brothers ran for office against William Flinn, an upstart in local politics. However Magee and Flinn struck up a partnership, as Flinn eyed a seat in the Pennsylvania General Assembly, and Magee had a natural enemy at the state level, the political boss Matthew Quay. So Flinn became Magee's man. In 1887 the two succeeded in changing the city charter at the state legislature that took the power of appointments away from city council and granted it to department heads. Magee and Flinn also consolidated Republican control within both the city and Allegheny County. Finally, the two were successful in placing public monies into banks and financial markets associated with industrial Pittsburgh's phenomenal growth after the American Civil War. This won them untold favors from big business, especially allowing them to grant jobs to thousands and thus build their political machine. Magee did win two terms to the Pennsylvania State Senate, but his political influence was largely limited to Pittsburgh. Magee made his early forturne in the local street car industry. He began as president of Transverse Railway Company, secured franchises through his political maneuverings, and eventually gained control over competing lines. He then merged the street car companies into the Consolidated Traction Company, of which he served as president. He also owned much real estate in the city and he served on the boards of many banks and corporations. Magee's chief business partner was Joshua Rhodes, chairman of the National Tube Company, which later became part of U.S. Steel. Magee also served on the boards of nonprofit institutions such as hospitals and universities. In 1895 he donated $125,000 to establish the Pittsburgh Zoo. In the mid-1890s, Magee helped complete the construction of the Schenley Park Casino, which had the first known artificial ice surface in North America, and was the first place in Pittsburgh where organized ice hockey was played. However the Casino was destroyed in a fire, just 19 months after it opened. Magee then purchased a trolley barn at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Craig Street in 1895, turned it into a 5,000-seat arena and named it the Duquesne Gardens. The building hosted its first hockey game in 1899, and became the home of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League. When the Democratic minority party supported a sand filtration plant for Pittsburgh's water supply, Magee, Edward Manning Bigelow, and his brother Thomas Bigelow contended over different plans. Magee's maneuvers were in part responsible for the slow adoption of filtration, and the resultant deaths of Pittsburghers from cholera.Klein, Philip S., and Art Hoogenboom. A History of Pennsylvania. Second Edition. University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University. 1980 (1973). p. 368. Personal life He married Eleanor Louise Gillespie in 1878. Shortly after their marriage, they moved into a stately home called the \\"Maples\\". Under ownership of the Magees, the house was renovated and became a local showplace, where they frequently entertained business and political associates. The house was at the corner of Forbes Avenue and Halket Street in the city's Oakland district. The couple had no children. The Magees were members of the First Methodist Church of Pittsburgh. However, prior to her husband's death, Eleanor became a strong supporter of the Christian Science faith.New York Times, May 13, 1909 p.1 Illness Magee fell ill in 1899 and took a leave of absence for treatment and rest. During this time his partner Flinn became involved in a flap over the rigged bidding system the two had concocted for city contracts. The \\"lowest responsible bidder\\" scheme, as it was known, assured that Flinn's company, Booth and Flinn, won most large construction and paving contracts in Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania. Edward Manning Bigelow, director of public works and a cousin of Magee's, was moved by public reform pressure to liberalize specifications for streets, which allowed competition. Flinn retaliated by having city council fire Bigelow. Bigelow's brother Thomas, who had a long grudge against Magee because of \\"bad\\" deals involving street car lines, enlisted the help of Matt Quay at the state level. A new bill was introduced in Harrisburg to amend the city's charter, and it passed, effectively dismantling the Magee-Flinn machine. Magee died on March 8, 1901 at the age of 52 and was buried in Allegheny Cemetery days later. According to University of Pittsburgh historian, Carolyn Carson, thousands of people lined the streets between Trinity Episcopal Church and Allegheny Cemetery, and women all along the route threw flowers and sometimes themselves onto the coffin. According to the Register of Wills of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, J.N. Mackrell, his personal property and real estate at his death exceeded $4 million. Legacy Like many prominent political leaders of the era Magee is either viewed as a generous saint of a man or a corrupt scalawag, depending on whose view was being expressed.Christopher Lyman Magee memorial, by Augustus Saint-GaudensOne of the positive opinions of Magee's legacy was written by Stephen Quinon, a journalist who worked for The Pittsburg Times, which Magee owned. According to Quinon, Magee was a benevolent visionary who improved the city and looked out for the underdog. When Magee took on the costly chore of consolidating the city's trolley lines, Quinon said it was done mainly to benefit everyday workers. Better trolley service, he wrote, \\"induced those who dwelt in crowded quarters to find homes for themselves on the outskirts of the city, where there was pure air, a touch of nature and freedom from many temptations for both young and old.\\" During the Christmas holidays, said another biography located in the archives of Magee-Women's Hospital, \\"he stood on the steps of the old Fidelity Trust Building and gave silver dollars to young newsboys.\\" However a starkly different depiction of Magee's influence came from The Shame of the Cities, the landmark 1903 book by Lincoln Steffens on political corruption in American cities. In the chapter \\"Pittsburg: A City Ashamed\\", Steffens castigated Magee and his political ally, state legislator William Flinn, for the way they ran the city. \\"Minneapolis was an example of police corruption,\\" Steffens wrote. \\"St. Louis of financial corruption. Pittsburg is an example of both police and financial corruption.\\" Steffens wrote about the alleged Flinn-Magee collusion: \\"Magee wanted power, Flinn wealth.... Magee spent his wealth for more power, and Flinn spent his power for more wealth.... Magee attracted followers, Flinn employed them. He was useful to Magee, Magee was indispensable to him.... Molasses and vinegar, diplomacy and force, mind and will, they were well mated.\\" Reformers eventually reined in Flinn by passing legislation to curb corruption and kickbacks. As just one example, Steffens wrote about how the Magee machine did favors for businessmen who wanted to expand their plants. \\"A foundry occupies a block, spreads to the next block and wants the street between. In St. Louis the business man boodled for his street. In Pittsburg he went to Magee, and I have heard such a man praise Chris, 'because when I called on him his outer office was filled with waiting politicians, but he knew I was a business man and in a hurry; he called me in first, and he gave me the street without any fuss.'\\" Even as he condemned Magee's tactics, Steffens acknowledged his enormous popularity. \\"Chris, as he was called, was a charming character,\\" Steffens wrote. \\"I have seen Pittsburgers grow black in the face denouncing the ring, but when I asked, 'What kind of a man was Magee?' they would cool and say, \\"Chris? Chris was one of the best men God ever made.\\" Steffens concluded. \\"Magee did not, technically speaking, rob the town. That was not his way, and it would be a carelessly unnecessary way in Pennsylvania. But surely he does not deserve a monument.\\" Meanwhile, Edward Muller, a University of Pittsburgh history professor, said Magee was a classic machine boss who not only helped shape the city's growth when its industry and population were increasing rapidly, but also ensured his political future by taking care of the many new immigrants flowing into the region. Muller stated that, like other machine leaders, Magee figured out 'that by providing minimal services like a turkey in the pot at Thanksgiving or a load of coal when it was freezing or jobs in contracting companies that paved the streets and put in lighting and sewers, he could in turn get the voters' undying political loyalty.\\" In the end, Muller said, Magee accomplished a tremendous upgrade of the city's infrastructure at the time, with roads, sewers, gas, lighting, the parks system being built. However, Muller states it was done at a cost, a degree of inefficiency, a degree of corruption. Magee is honored with several monuments throughout the city of Pittsburgh, including one on Schenley Plaza created by the sculptor Augustus Saint Gaudens. His home \\"Maples\\" became a maternity hospital in 1911, which continues today as Magee-Women's Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a hospital for women and their babies, envisioned by Magee in his will. As stipulated, it opened after his wife's death and was named Elizabeth Steel Magee Hospital in honor of his mother.

It is the first novel of the internationally popular Inspector Montalbano series. Plot summary The Mànnara where Luparello's found dead (location used in the TV series) Silvio Luparello, an engineer, developer, and aspiring politician from an aristocratic construction family, dies of a heart attack while having sex with his nephew and lover Giorgio at his beach house. The nephew panics, and, wanting to protect his uncle from the embarrassing circumstance of his death and not trusting himself to be able to move his uncle's body due to his epilepsy, calls his uncle's friend and political crony Attorney Rizzo for help. Rizzo assures the nephew he will take care of it, but then, instead of trying to help, attempts to take advantage of the situation and betrays his friendship with Luparello by attempting to use his death to gain leverage over his political opponent, Secretary Cardamone. This he does by attempting to cast Cardamone's Swedish daughter-in-law Ingrid as Luparello's lover and implicating her in his death – at the scene of a seamy outdoor brothel. The film version starts off the morning after the death at the outdoor brothel, with two surveyors working as garbage collectors. They discover the body and contact Attorney Rizzo in an attempt to curry favor with him and maybe get proper surveyor's jobs by giving him the chance to move Luparello's body in order to avoid the embarrassment of Luparello being found at the outdoor brothel, dead with his pants down. Rizzo rebuffs the garbage men, much to their surprise, as he is known to be Luparello's friend and ally. Meanwhile, one of the garbage men finds Ingrid's very valuable solid gold jewel-encrusted necklace, planted by Rizzo's Ingrid look-alike as part of the frame-up. The handbag with her initials in which she normally kept the necklace was also planted at the brothel in case somebody walked off with the necklace. Montalbano, with the help of his boyhood friend and outdoor brothel pimp Gegè, and with the help of Luparello's wife (who tips Montalbano to the fact that somebody must have dressed Luparello because his underwear was on inside out), figures out that the garbage men have the necklace and also that Attorney Rizzo is the bad guy. Montalbano initially suspects Ingrid's involvement because of her relationship with Luparello which he formerly thought sexual, but she convinces Montalbano that she wasn't involved. Montalbano then destroys the planted evidence against her and makes sure that Rizzo pays a reward for the necklace (so that the garbage man and his wife can send their sick child out of the country for proper medical treatment). The story wraps up with Montalbano \\"playing God\\" by ignoring a gun that he finds in the beach house, thus giving Giorgio the opportunity to avenge his uncle's betrayal by beating up and killing Rizzo. In the end though Giorgio, too, dies – in a car accident – after previously having had one due to an epileptic seizure that required him to wear a neck brace (which we assume is the same one that Montalbano found at the outdoor brothel, and which we also assume was there because of being used by Rizzo and the Ingrid look-alike to make Luparello appear to be alive during the \\"sex\\" act at the outdoor brothel).

It particularly refers to the thousands of Hindu god Rama-related dramatic plays and dance events, that are staged during the annual autumn festival of Navratri in India. After the enactment of the legendary war between Good and Evil, the Ramlila celebrations climax in the Dussehra (Dasara, Vijayadashami) night festivities where the giant grotesque effigies of Evil such as of demon Ravana are burnt, typically with fireworks.Ramlila, the traditional performance of the Ramayana, UNESCORamlila Pop Culture India!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle, by Asha Kasbekar. Published by ABC-CLIO, 2007. . Page 42. Rama is the seventh avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu and the central figure of the Ramayana, a Sanskrit epic that integrates performance arts with stories driven by ethical values. The epic text is dated to 1st millennium BCE, and Ramlila is an adaptation of those stories. Most Ramlilas in North India are based on the 16th century secondary work on Ramayana, Ramcharitmanas a verse form composition in the regional vernacular language (Hindi), by Tulsidas. These verses are used as dialogues in traditional adaptations. Open-air productions are staged by local Ramlila committees (Samitis), and funded entirely by the villagers or local neighbourhoods in urban areas. The core team of performance artists train for the dance-drama, but the actual performance attracts impromptu participants from the audience and villagers. This art form is a part of the Hindu culture, found for many gods and goddesses, but those of Rama, Durga (as Durga Puja) and Krishna (as Rasa lila) are the most popular and annual events in the Indian subcontinent. The Ramlila festivities were declared by UNESCO as one of the \\"Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\\" in 2008. Ramlila is particularly notable in historically important Hindu cities of Ayodhya, Varanasi, Vrindavan, Almora, Satna and Madhubani – cities in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. The epic and its dramatic play migrated into southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE, and Ramayana based Ramlila is a part of performance arts culture of Indonesia particularly the Hindu society of Bali, Myanmar, Cambodia and Thailand. In the 19th and 20th centuries, with the movement of the Indian diaspora into European colonies as indentured servants, the cultural celebration of Ramlila is now found in many parts of the world such as the Caribbean, Mauritius, Africa, Fiji, Malaysia, and Singapore. It is also found in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand.Ramlila - The traditional performance of Ramayana - Part I & II Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts Etymology and nomenclature Ramlila is a compound Sanskrit words \\"Rama\\" (a Vishnu avatar) and \\"Lila\\" (play, game, sport). According to James Lochtefeld, the word connotes a \\"playful drama about Rama\\", where it is both entertainment and a \\"deeply serious religious act\\" that has spiritual significance to both the actors and the audience. A literal translation of Ram Lila, states Norvin Hein, is \\"Rama's sport\\" where the term \\"sport\\" is best understood in a theological context. According to the Vaishnava thought, the Supreme Being (Vishnu) has no need to create the empirical world, he just descends as an avatar and manifests in the empirical world to \\"spontaneously, joyfully, disinterestedly play a part\\" or engage in \\"sports\\". The teams or companies of actors that train together and perform Ramlila are called Mandalis. History A Ramayana-based Ramlila dance troupe in Bali Indonesia. Performance arts are an ancient Indian tradition, with the Sanskrit Hindu text Natya Shastra explaining the importance of performing arts as follows: > Let Nātya (drama and dance) be the fifth vedic scripture. Combined with an > epic story, tending to virtue, wealth, joy and spiritual freedom, it must > contain the significance of every scripture, and forward every art. — > Nātyaśāstra 1.14–15; Also see chapter 36 Ramlila is one of many performance arts-related festivities within Hinduism. Ramayana epic is dated to the 1st millennium BCE, and is one of the oldest Itihasa genre of Indian literature. It is unclear however as to when the first performances of Ramlila were held. The first enactment of Ramcharitmanas by 16th century Tulsidas is undocumented, but according to the tradition, his student Megha Bhagat started the Ramcharitmanas-based Ramlila in 1625. According to Norvin Hein, a professor of Divinity and of Religious Studies specialising on Indology, Ramlila were in vogue before 1625, at least in North India between 1200 and 1500 CE, but these were based on Valmiki's Ramayana.Norvin Hein (1972), The Miracle Plays of Mathura, Yale University Press, , pages 70-125 According to Richard Schechner, the contemporary Ramlila has deeper roots, as it incorporates both the teachings of ancient Sanskrit texts and modern theatre techniques. The Ramayana relief artwork in 8th century Cave 16 of Ellora suggests its importance to Indian society by then. According to John Brockington, a professor of Sanskrit specialising on Indian epics, Ramlila is likely an ancient tradition of India because it is generally accepted by scholars that written manuscripts emerged later in Indian religions, and ancient texts were largely a product of oral tradition. Thus, not only Ramalila, but all ancient epics of India must very likely have been recited and transmitted by bards and students in Ramlila-like manner, verbally from one generation to another, and consistently preserved across a wide geographic region by rules of acting by many teams. Further, states Brockington, the Hindu epics are too vast, with the Ramayana containing 20,000 verses and the Mahabharata with 100,000 verses, to have been preserved over two thousand years without being written down and without reciting and acting out. It is therefore unlikely that the Ramlila tradition emerged only in the modern era. Some colonial era Indologists suggested, adds Brockington, that the Ramayana is a modern era text, but this hypothesis has since been abandoned because the existence of the Hindu Ramayana has been attested in Jainism literature, Ramayana reliefs in cave temples such as Ellora Caves, and southeast Asian temple carvings and culture by the 1st millennium CE. According to Norvin Hein, the contemporary Ramlila started once the Manas text of Tulsidas had been composed in the 16th century. However, states Hein, a dance-drama form of Ramayana enactment flourished at least in the Mathura region much earlier, possibly around the early centuries of the common era by the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism. He traces the evidence for this in the Kathakali, Yaksagana, Kathak and other Indian classical dances which share segments, themes and styles with Ramlila. James Prinsep wrote an eyewitness description of Varanasi Ramlila festivities in 1825, while H. Niehus wrote another from Ghazipur in 1905. Norvin Hein described the Ramlila of 1949 and 1950, a period of socio-political turmoil in India after the British India partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan. Hein reported his observations from Ramilila in Mathura. Description Ramlila revolves around the epic of Rama (blue figure), depicted here with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana The Ramlila is the story of Hindu god Rama from his birth. The epic recites his childhood along with those of others who are major characters in it, such as Sita, Lakshmana, Ravana and others. It includes chapters on the marriage of Sita and Rama, the exile of Rama because Dharma requires him to give up his throne, Sita and Lakshmana joining him in the exile, their journeys through India and they meeting revered Rishis of Hinduism, the abduction of Sita by demon Ravana, the sorrow of Rama and Lakshmana, their hopelessness, how they creatively build an army from other living beings in the forest such as monkeys, their journey to Lanka to confront Ravana, the battle between the good and evil, the destruction of Ravana, the return of Rama to Ayodhya and as king, and the life thereafter. Ramlila festivals play this story. It is organised in numerous villages, towns and neighbourhoods during the autumn Navratri festival season which typically falls in September or October. The festival is both a religious and cultural event, bringing the population together, states UNESCO, \\"without distinction of caste, religion or age\\". The audience such as the villagers participate spontaneously, playing roles or help out in setting and cleaning up the stage, making costumes, and upkeep of the Ramlila area. A rural Ramlila stage setup in progress in India. The large effigy is of Ravana who is destroyed at the end. Traditionally organised in a makeshift open-air theatre at night, it is usually staged by amateur acting teams drawn from all segments of the society. Singers and musicians, men and women, elderly and youth play different parts, sing the verses to music, recite dialogues. The recitations and the narrative of the play are usually based on Ramacharitamanas. The dialogue is improvised, and often responsive to audience reactions. Dhol drummers and other musicians participate. The atmosphere is usually festive and free, with the audience whistling and commenting as the story proceeds. The stage is surrounded by food stalls and larger productions have a fair nearby. Surrounding areas temporarily transform into bazaars to cater to the audience. A committee (samiti) heads the preparation. In many rural areas, traditional venues for Ramlila have developed over the centuries, and hundreds of people will often make the trip nightly to attend the play, by walking over miles like a religious pilgrimage in earlier times. Actors typically don't get paid, or get paid little for their efforts, but they are provided free food and accommodation by the villagers or committee. Performance costs are usually financed by fundraising in the community, often by self-organized Ramlila Committees. A Ramlila is not a simple play acted out in a drama theatre, but it is structured to encourage and allow the audience to participate. In major productions, the audience walk with the actors from one site to another, they chant or co-recite passage, they immerse themselves as minor or significant characters in the play, while the major roles are played by a troupe of artists. The audience cheers when the good gets the upper hand, they are sorrowful when a wrong happens such as the kidnapping of Sita and her imprisonment against her will by demon Ravana. They participate in the burning of the effigies, and the community welcome during the return of Rama back to Ayodhya. It is theologically an immersion experience. Regional variations Lead performers of a Ramlila troupe mandali, with the director, called vyasa Today, several regions have developed their distinctive form of Ramlila, Uttar Pradesh itself has numerous variants of presentation styles, most prominent among them is that of Ramnagar, Varanasi which is a 31-day event, while most Ramlila elsewhere are typically abridged 10 day event climaxing in Dussehra. Other variants include the pantomime style is visible in jhankis or tableaux pageants, where colourful Jhankis and pageants depicting scenes from the life of Lord Rama are taken out through the city.Ramlila Department of Tourism, Government of UP, Uttar Pradesh. According to a 2008 UNESCO report, the most notable Ramlila traditions are those observed annually at Ayodhya, Ramnagar and Varanasi, Vrindavan, Almora, Satna and Madhubani.Ramlila - the Traditional Performance of the Ramayana UNESCO. Another variant is the operatic style incorporates elements of folk theatre elements generously, while the traditional style remains, where the couplets of Ramacharitmanas not only act as dialogues, but also as chorus as well, and lastly there is the Ramlila staged by professional troupes called \\"mandalis\\".Ramlila in Uttar Pradesh www.bharatonline.com. Many urban Ramilias now have dialogues written in Khadi Boli or in local dialects, but the treatment remains melodramatic as always to achieve maximum impact amidst an audience that knows the story by heart, but watches the enactment nevertheless for religious fervour and also for its spectacle value, making Ramlila an important event in the religious as well as social calendar of not only in small town and villages but also many big cities. Just other folk theatre form of India, like Jatra of Bengal, topic themes are often interwoven in the script to had relevance and sometimes humour is used to offer a critic or commentary over current happenings. Ramlila at Ramnagar, Varanasi The tradition of staging the Ramlila at Ramnagar, Varanasi, which lies across the Ganges river from the Hindu pilgrimage city of Varanasi, was started in ca 1830 by Maharaja Udit Narayan Singh, Kashi Naresh with the help of Pandit Laxmi Narayan Pandey's family (present vyas ji of the Ramlila of Ramnagar).Ramleela - Ramnagar Varanasi Official website. It rose in popularity during the reign of his successor Maharaj Isvari Prasad Singh, and received continued patronage from the subsequent Kings of the Royal House of Benares to create a participatory environmental theatre (Site-specific theatre) on a grand scale, where attendance ranges from few thousands to 100,000 for others.A Maharajah´s Festival for Body and Soul New York Times, Monday, 30 March 2009. Ram Leela Mela, before the Raja of Benares, culmination of Ramlila with burning of Ravana effigies, at Ramnagar Fort, 1834 The Ramlila is a cycle of plays which recounts the epic story of Lord Rama, as told in Ramcharitmanas, the version of the Ramayana penned by Tulsidas. The plays sponsored by the Maharaja, are performed in Ramnagar every evening for 31 days. The Ramnagar Ramlila is held over 31 days where the entire Ramacharitmanas is recited, instead of usual 10 for abridged production. It is known for its lavish sets, dialogues and visual spectacle. In Ramnagar, a number of stages have been constructed by the town, each named after the major sites of events in the Ramayana epic. The permanent structures and several temporary structure serve as sets, to represent locations like Ashok Vatika, Janakpuri, Panchavati, Lanka etc., during the performance. Hence the entire city turn into a giant open-air set, and audience moves along with the performers with every episode, to the next locale. As the play progresses, the actors and audience move from one place to another, they join the chorus, giving the feel that the audience is participating and is a part of the play. A Ramlila actor the traditional attire of Ravana Preparations begin, weeks before its commencement, even the audition process is traditionally attended to by the Maharaja, where Svarupas, literally divine embodiment, the various characters of the Ramayana, are chosen from amongst local actors. Important roles are often inherited by families, for example, the role of Ravana was held by same family from 1835 to 1990, and roles of Hanuman, Jatayu, and Janaka traditionally belong to one Vyasa family.Ramlila: The Performance in Ramnagar University of North Texas. When the Dussehra festivities are inaugurated with a colourful pageant Kashi Naresh rides an elephant at the head of the procession. Then, resplendent in silk and brocade, he inaugurates the month-long folk theatre of Ramlila at Ramnagar. During the period, hundreds of sadhus called Ramayanis descend into the town to watch and recite the Ramcharitmanas text. Many an audience carry a copy of the Ramacharit Manas, simply called Manas, and follow stanza after stanza, after the characters delivering their dialogue.Performative Circumstances, from the Avant Garde to Ramlila: from the avant garde to Ramlila, by Richard Schechner.

Ravana effigy during a Ramlila event. During the course of the performance, there is a double transformation of the space within the city, as it first transforms from a city to theatre and then to mythic geography, as the scale of the performance is gradually increased to mythic proportions, coming down only in the end, when Rama finally returns home, this is when the Raja himself becomes part of the theatre thereby incorporating local element into the story itself. In the end, as the swarups, actors depart, they take off their garlands and offer it to Royal family members and give darshan to audience, after the performance one last time.Ramlila of Ramanagar The future of ritual: writings on culture and performance, by Richard Schechner. Published by Routledge, 1993. . Page 169. At the end of each episode, lila, an aarti is performed, chants of 'Har Har Mahadev' or 'Bolo! Raja Ramchandra ki Jai!' resound in the air, as the audience join in. Thereafter, a jhanki, literally a peep or glimpse, tableaux of frozen iconic moments from the 'Manas', is presented, which not only distill and crystallise the message of the story for the audience, but is also appreciated for its spectacular effect. Though several local legends exist regarding the beginning of this Ramlila, including one of which suggests that it was first staged at a nearby village, Chota Mirzapur as the one at Varanasi was disrupted due to the floods in the Ganges, from where it evolved to the present Ramlila, which is by far the most traditional rendition of the Ramayana, and has been a subject of study by scholars from all over the world for many decades now.\\"What's Taking Place: Neighborhood Ramlilas in Banaras\\" by Thomas Parkhill Living Banaras: Hindu Religion in Cultural Context, Bradley R.

Over a million pilgrims arrive annually for the vast processions and performances organised by Kashi Naresh. Geographic spread A modern Ramayana production. Over the centuries, Ramlila has evolved into a highly venerated art form, and has travelled to far corners of the globe, through Indian diaspora, not as acts of \\"cultural recovery\\", rather as fresh expressions of a persistent faith. Today, Ramalila is staged in most countries that with immigrant Hindu populations from the Indian subcontinent, including that from India, Nepal and Pakistan. Outside the Indian subcontinent, this includes Fiji, Mauritius, South Africa, Canada, Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Some Asian cultures have similar drama traditions based on the Ramayana, for instance the Phra Lak Phra Lam (Lak and Lam are the Laotian names for Lakshman and Ram, respectively) folkplay of Laos and northeastern Thailand. The Rama story is also enacted in another popular art form as a night time fire shadow or day time puppet show. This is known as Tolapavakuthu in Kerala, Ravana chaya in Odisha, Nang sbek thom in Cambodia, Nang yai in Thailand and Wayang purwa in Indonesia.

His professional career spanned 22 years, from 1978 until 2000. The highest rank he reached was sekiwake. He won over 800 career bouts and took the yūshō or championship in the top makuuchi division in 1992. Mitoizumi was nicknamed the \\"Salt Shaker\\", due to his habit of throwing enormous quantities of purifying salt onto the ring (dohyō) during the pre-match preliminaries. He is now a coach, and is known as Nishikido Oyakata. Career Mitoizumi was discovered by Takamiyama, a famous Hawaiian born sumo wrestler, who met the 16-year-old and his brother at a department store where Takamiyama was making a personal appearance. He was persuaded to join Takasago stable and made his professional debut in March 1978. Initially fighting under his own surname of Koizumi, he switched to the shikona of Mitoizumi (reference to his birthplace) in 1981. He was troubled early in his career by illness and in 1982 he seriously injured his knee and was hospitalised for four months, causing him to miss tournaments and plunge down the rankings. This was just one of many injuries he would have to battle with over the course of his long career. He made the breakthrough to the salaried sekitori ranks in May 1984 when he reached the jūryō division, in the same tournament in which Takamiyama announced his retirement. Mitoizumi was promoted to the top makuuchi division just two tournaments later in September 1984. However, he was to suffer more misfortune. Just before the May 1985 tournament he was involved in a motor accident, receiving cuts to his face; and was forced to sit out part of the tournament. After the next tournament, he was demoted back to jūryō. In September 1986, after he had managed to return to the top division and reach a new highest rank of sekiwake, he injured his knee again in a bout with ōzeki Ōnokuni and returned to the second division once more. It took him until January 1988 to fight his way back to the top division, but this time he was to remain there for the next eleven years. Mitoizumi was ranked at sekiwake on several more occasions and won seven special prizes, but the highlight of his career came in July 1992, when he took the top division tournament championship for the only time. Ranked at maegashira 1, he took advantage of the absence of the top ranked wrestler at the time, ōzeki Akebono, and clinched the championship on the 14th day with a win over Takanonami. He finished on 13-2, two wins ahead of his nearest challengers Kirishima and Musashimaru. Mitoizumi was never able to reach those heights again, but after his final appearance in the san'yaku ranks in November 1992 he remained in the top division until March 1999. He carried on fighting in the jūryō division until September 2000, when he finally announced his retirement at the age of 38, rather than be demoted to the third makushita division. He had been an active wrestler for more than 22 years. His tally of 807 career wins is the twelfth highest in sumo history. He never earned any kinboshi, as all his victories over yokozuna came when he was fighting at komusubi or sekiwake rank. Mitoizumi's nickname of the \\"Salt Shaker\\" was given to him by British sumo fans who followed his matches on Channel 4 and in the exhibition at the Royal Albert Hall in 1991. It referred to his habit during the pre-match rituals (but only on the final throw) of grabbing a huge handful of purifying salt and flinging it high into the air. After his retirement his routine was taken up by maegashira Kitazakura. Retirement from sumo Mitoizumi's official retirement ceremony (danpatsu-shiki) took place on 9 June 2001, with a record 470 patrons, wrestlers and coaches taking part in the hair-cutting ritual. He remained in the sumo world as a coach at Takasago stable under the elder name Nishikido Oyakata and he effectively led it during the illness of its head, former komusubi Fujinishiki. However, he lost out on the chance to succeed him, due to personal problems with his fianceé from whom he eventually split. Instead, control of Takasago stable passed to former ōzeki Asashio who merged it with Wakamatsu stable. As a result, in December 2002 Mitoizumi instead opened up his own training stable, or heya, Nishikido stable. The stable did not produce a sekitori until November 2017 when Mitoryū was promoted to jūryō. Unusually for the head of a stable, he remained single for many years, before marrying a soprano, Yukiko Ono, in February 2016. Nishikido also works as a judge of tournament bouts. Fighting style Mitoizumi was not noted as a technician, and never won a Technique prize. His most common winning kimarite was overwhelmingly yori-kiri, a straightforward force out, which accounted for over half of his victories at sekitori level. However, due to his height and strength he also regularly employed kimedashi, or arm barring force out, a technique seldom seen today. Family Mitoizumi's younger brother, Umenosato, was also a sumo wrestler at Takasago stable. He fought for 21 years from 1980 to 2001 but only made the jūryō division on one occasion in July 1993. He now works at Nishikido stable as a manager.

It is the second novel of the internationally popular Inspector Montalbano series. While chasing down a mafia crime, Montalbano finds a cave with symbolic artifacts and the bodies of two young lovers, hidden since World War II.  Plot summary  An illustration of the legend of the Seven Sleepers The story starts off with \\"Tano Il Greco\\", a tired mafia boss, making a deal with Montalbano to stage his arrest in order for him to save face. The arrest causes Montalbano to have to appear at a press conference and be considered for promotion, both of which he does not appreciate. At the same time there has also been a seemingly unrelated and mysterious theft of a grocery store delivery truck; the truck is discovered the next morning, abandoned, with the stolen goods still within and intact. An old man, Misucara, who was witness to the robbery, then dies in a suspicious accident, but not before passing on an odd bit of information to the inspector: that the grocery store owner's car was parked nearby during the time of the robbery. When Tano ends up dying at the hands of mafia rivals during a police transfer, he passes on information to Montalbano that leads the inspector and his team to search for a secret cave used as a black market goods store during World War II and now used for smuggling arms for the mafia, in which the grocery store owner was complicit. Montalbano notices that the inside of the cave is not symmetrical and figures out there must be a secret room, where he discovers the bodies of two young lovers, carefully arranged in what appears to be some kind of ancient ritual guarded by a terracotta dog. Learning that the bodies were placed sometime around the allied invasion and devastating bombing of the island at the end of World War II, Montalbano interviews local residents from that time to try to piece together who the young couple were, why they were killed and why they were ritually buried. The young couple turn out to be Lisetta, a local girl with a sexually abusive father, and her lover Mario, a young Italian soldier stationed at a repair ship that had been docked for an extended period at the town of Vigata. Believing that his ship was to be called to sail soon, Mario had implored Lisetta to come see him one last time, and she had run away then, which resulted in the two lovers presumably being killed when discovered by the jealous father of Lisetta. This knowledge, however, does not satisfy the inspector, as while he had deciphered the identity of the couple and the reason for their murder, the ritualistic method of their burial still remained a mystery. One thing that puzzles Montalbano as he learns more about the ritual burial is that it doesn't make sense, because it is a mixture of different traditions, and this leads him to look for someone who might have knowledge of different burial rites. And once he has a suspect for the person that conducted the ritual burial, Montalbano stages an elaborate ploy to get onto the TV news so that maybe his suspect living in some other part of Italy might get his message and return to the site of the crime 50 years later. It turns out Lisetta's cousin Lillo, who had been very fond of his little cousin, had put up the couple at Lisetta's request in his house. However, the couple had been killed one day when Lillo was out of the house by Lisetta's father's man. Lillo, in his rage, then killed the man. In a state of denial over the incident, he then buries the two lovers in a ritual miming the legend of the Seven Sleepers, in the hopes that like the sleepers, they will reawaken one day. Due to his academic work in studying the legend, he invokes both Christian and Islamic elements in the ritual. He then left Sicily in the hopes of putting all this behind him, until the Inspector resurrected the lovers with his discovery.

It is the third novel of the internationally popular Inspector Montalbano series. Plot summary During a night off the coast of Vigàta a fishing boat from Mazara del Vallo, called \\"Santopadre\\", is intercepted and machine-gunned, apparently in international waters, by a Tunisian patrol boat. The exploded shots kill a Tunisian sailor who was on board the Italian boat. On the same day the former merchant Aurelio Lapecora is stabbed in a lift and Karima Moussa, a beautiful Tunisian cleaning lady, suddenly disappears. Montalbano discovers that the girl also worked in the office of the murdered merchant whose she was lover and that she had a son, François, who also disappeared with her. Thanks to the help of the elderly Aisha, an acquaintance of Karima, Montalbano also finds a savings account owned by the girl with deposited five hundred million lire, a sum too high for a young immigrant who should have had only what she received from her humble work. While returning to the police station from the visit to the house of Karima, Montalbano sees in front of a primary school a small group of mothers who complain with a policeman of some thefts of snacks, which accuse a small foreigner child. Montalbano realizes that he's François: lurking with his girlfriend Livia and his men, he manages to take the little Tunisian who had taken refuge in an abandoned house. Livia, in reassuring the child brought home by Montalbano to protect him, will feel the birth of his maternal instinct and the desire to form a more intense union with Salvo, adopting the child. The commissioner will join the project of Livia but in the meantime the investigations are complicated by the secret services and the slimy figure of Colonel Lohengrin Pera. In the story there are many references to Montalbano's relationship with his father, who lives far from Vigata and remains a widower of his second wife. He collects newspaper articles that write about his son's investigative successes and when the commissioner was wounded, he was near him by calling and went to visit him in hospital. Sometimes a box of his good wine arrives at the police station. During the investigation, Montalbano receives a letter from a partner of his father's winery informing him that he has long been seriously ill with a tumor and that, although aware of his imminent death, he did not want to let his son know anything about spare him the agony of his suffering. Montalbano will arrive in the hospital where his father is hospitalized when he is dead and will bitterly reproach himself for his selfishness because even if he had intuited the malaise he has unconsciously ignored it.

Their purpose was to help the MCC, as the game's lawgivers, to decide if roundarm bowling should be legalised or if the only legitimate style of bowling should be underarm, which had been in use since time immemorial. Conditions of play The matches were also known as the \\"Experimental Matches\\".Altham, p.61. The conditions set for the matches allowed William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge of Sussex to bowl roundarm, while the All-England bowlers had to bowl underarm. Summary of series Sussex won the first match at Sheffield against an all-professional All-England team by 7 wickets and the second at Lord's by 3 wickets. After the second match, the following declaration was made by some of the All-England players: > \\"We, the undersigned, do agree that we will not play the third match between > All-England and Sussex, which is intended to be played at Brighton in July > or August unless the Sussex bowlers bowl fair – this is, abstain from > throwing\\". It was signed by Tom Marsden, William Ashby, William Mathews, William Searle, James Saunders, Thomas Howard, Will Caldecourt, Fuller Pilch and Thomas Beagley. The declaration was later withdrawn and the third match was played at Brighton as planned. This time England won by 24 runs. Match details Match 1 – All-England v Sussex at Darnall New Ground, Sheffield (4, 5 & 6 June 1827) :All-England 81 (F Pilch 38; W Lillywhite 5w, J Broadbridge 2w) and 112 (T Marsden 22; J Broadbridge 5w, W Lillywhite 2w) :Sussex 91 (J Dale 31*, G Meads 26; W Mathews 3w) and 103–3 (E Thwaites 37*) :Sussex won by 7 wickets. Their first innings was saved by a 10th wicket partnership of at least 50 between Dale and Meads. :All-England: Thomas Flavel, John Bowyer, James Saunders, William Barber, Tom Marsden, Fuller Pilch, George Dawson, Thomas Beagley, William Mathews, George Jarvis, Henry Jupp :Sussex: George Brown, George Meads, Thomas Pierpoint, Edward Thwaites, Jem Broadbridge, William Slater, William Lillywhite, William Broadbridge, James Dale, Charles Duff, Charles Pierpoint Match 2 – All-England v Sussex at Lord's Cricket Ground (18 & 19 June 1827) :All-England 152 (W Ward 42, T Beagley 37; C Duff 3w, W Lillywhite 2w) and 60 (W Ward 20; J Broadbridge 3w) :Sussex 96 (W Broadbridge 21; G T Knight 4w) and 117–7 (J Broadbridge 28) :Sussex won by 3 wickets in two days, the match having been scheduled for three days. :All-England: William Mathews, William Searle, James Saunders, William Ward, Tom Marsden, Fuller Pilch, Thomas Beagley, Henry Kingscote, George T Knight, William Ashby, Thomas Howard :Sussex: Richard Cheslyn, William Slater, Henry Morley, William Broadbridge, Edward Thwaites, Jem Broadbridge, George Brown, Thomas Pierpoint, William Lillywhite, Charles Duff, James Baker Match 3 – Sussex v All-England at Royal New Ground, Brighton (23, 24 & 25 July 1827) :All-England 27 (W Lillywhite 3w, J Broadbridge 2w) and 169 (J Saunders 44, H R Kingscore 31) :Sussex 77 (G Brown 24; E H Budd 2w) and 95 E Thwaites 20, J Dale 20; G T Knight 2w) :All- England won by 24 runs. An estimated 3,000 to 6,000 attended on each day. :All-England: William Searle, James Saunders, William Ward, Tom Marsden, Fuller Pilch, EH Budd, Thomas Beagley, George T Knight, Henry Kingscote, George Osbaldeston, Richard Mills :Sussex: William Slater, Henry Morley, William Broadbridge, Edward Thwaites, Jem Broadbridge, George Brown, James Dale, Richard Cheslyn, James Baker, Charles Lanaway, William Lillywhite Lillywhite and Broadbridge bowled roundarm again despite the opposition of some All-England players, but the All-England side itself used roundarm in this game as George T Knight was a supporter of it and subsequently did much to have it legalised.Altham, p.62. Conclusion The result of the \\"trial\\" was inconclusive and it was many years before roundarm was formally legalised. But, in practice, roundarm was adopted in 1827 as its practitioners, especially Broadbridge and Lillywhite, continued to use it with little, if any, opposition from the umpires. Aftermath In 1828, MCC modified Rule 10 of the Laws of Cricket to permit the bowler's hand to be raised as high as the elbow. In 1835, powerless to prevent the use of roundarm, MCC finally amended the Laws of Cricket to make it legal. The relevant part of the Law stated: \\"if the hand be above the shoulder in the delivery, the umpire must call No Ball.\\" Bowlers' hands now started to go above the shoulder and the 1835 Law had to be reinforced in 1845 by removing benefit of the doubt from the bowler in the matter of his hand's height when delivering the ball.

It was designed by Ton van de Ven and went operational in 1996, a year later than planned due to a general strike in the construction sector. Details The architecture is based on the Indonesian Rumah Gadang style of the Minangkabau ethnic group. The wooden construction has the largest reed roof (48437 square feet/ 4500 square metres) in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records. The five peaks of the roof symbolize the five senses, which stand for experiencing the Efteling. Besides the entrance, customer service, a souvenir shop and a toilet group are located in the building. The story “A long time ago, there ruled a king, but who got too old and sick to stay in power. He had five sons, who were meant to rule the country, each contributing with their special ability (one of the five senses). But they grew apart and the kingdom started falling apart. The old king’s court jester “Pardoes” (today’s park mascot) tried to get them together, and doing so requested an audience with each of the five sons. To the first one he asked: “Can you hear what I’m thinking?”... –“No, only my brother can do that!... I see what you mean!!!” To the second one he asked: “Can you see if people are honest?”…-“No, only my brother can do that!…I hear what you’re saying!!!” Asking such questions to all the sons, he made them realise their interdependent relationship and brought them together, and the people built the House of the Five Senses, with the five peaks referring to the sons’ abilities, for them to rule together. It so happens that the park’s entrance passes through this building nowadays.” References * Company information * Fansite House of the Five Senses ","title":"The House of the Five Senses"},{"id":"11695179","text":"Bromus hordeaceus, the soft brome, is an annual or biennial species of grass in the true grass family (Poaceae). It is also known in North America as bull grass, soft cheat, and soft chess. It is the most common species of Bromus in Britain, where it can be found on roadsides, waste ground, meadows, and cultivated land. It is found throughout Europe and western Asia, and was introduced into North and South America and Australia. Taxonomy Previously known as B. mollis, this species belongs to a group of closely related species, including some hybrids, which are difficult to tell apart. Some of the other species in this group include: B. thominii, B. lepidus, B. ferronii, and B. molliformis.Hubbard, C. E. Grasses. Penguin Books. 1978. Description The plant is pubescent entirely and lacks rhizomes. It can grow high, sometimes in tufts, sometimes singly. The smooth, yellowish brown culms measure wide at their base, and are minutely to densely pubescent, with hairs measuring up to long. The moderately to densely pilose leaf sheaths are mostly closed, with hairs long. The plant lacks auricles. The membraneous and erose ligules are long and are glabrous or pubescent. The grey-green leaf blades are long and wide, with a pubescent adaxial surface and an abaxial surface pubescent with hairs about one quarter the length of those on the adaxial surface. The leaf margins are smooth or serrated. The grey-green to purple panicles are long and wide. The panicles can be dense or reduced to just one spikelet. The erect to ascending or lax branches of the panicle are scabrous or pubescent, each branch bearing one spikelet. The ovate-lanceolate spikelets are , including the awns long. Edgar E. & Connor H.E. (2000). Flora of New Zealand, Vol. V, Grasses. Manaaki Whenua Press, Lincoln, New Zealand. p. 362-3 The rachillae can be visible when the spikelet is mature and the spikelet has six to eleven florets. The subequal glumes are minutely to densely pubescent and the keels are serrated. The lower glumes are long with three to five nerved, and the upper glumes are long and seven- to nine-nerved. The lemmas are long and wide, with seven to nine visible, conspicuous nerves. The lemmas have hyaline margins broad. The apex is bifid and the cleft is deep. The awns are long, arising below the lemma. The paleas are shorter than the lemmas, with glabrous backs and ciliate keels. The dark brown anthers are long. It grows during winter and flowers from late spring onwards, maturing in the summer. Dastgheib F. & Poole N. (2010). Seed biology of brome grass weeds (Bromus diandrus and B. hordeaceus) and effects of land management, “New Zealand Plant Protection” 63: 78-83 The grass blooms in May and August. Bromus hordeaceus is closely related to and difficult to distinguish from Bromus racemosus. The only obvious distinguishing characteristic is the level of lemma nerve protrusion; the lemma nerves are raised and conspicuous in B. hordeaceus while they are smooth and obscure in B. racemosus. Distribution and habitat Bromus hordeaceus is native to the Mediterranean basin, and is now widely distributed across North America, Europe, Africa, and Australia. It grows in waste areas, road verges, fields, grassy plains, and sandy beaches. The grass prefers drained or dry soils consisting of clay loam or sand, especially areas tending to be less fertile. The plant is resistant to drought and temperature variations. Invasive species Bromus hordeaceus can be a weed in cereal crops. It grows in wheat and spring barley crops competing and reducing their yield. The seeds can contaminate the crop seeds and lower seed quality. There are very few herbicides that selectively control soft brome in wheat or barley. The management of this weed is mostly based on an integrated programme. This includes hygiene to minimise its introduction to the fields as well as cleaning the fence lines where the infestation is more severe. A good crop rotation is useful as B. hordeaceus can be controlled with several herbicides in most other crops in the rotation. Growers in New Zealand use stubble burning to reduce the seed input in the following crops. Subspecies Bromus hordeaceus subsp. ferronii, the least soft brome, is a rare annual that occurs in northwestern Europe. The grass is tufted and erect or decumbent. The spikelets are villous and the awns are spreading or twisted. This subspecies can be used for erosion control. Bromus hordeaceus subsp. hordeaceus, the soft brome or soft chess, is an annual or biennial occurring in Europe, western North America, and northeastern North America. The culms are tall. The subspecies lacks auricles and the ligules are hyaline and smooth. The panicles are long. The spikelets are cleistogamous. The lemmas are long. The apex of the ovary is pubescent. This subspecies is primarily a forage plant, and occurs in waste places and roadsides. The subspecies has a diploid number of 14 or 28. Bromus hordeaceus subsp. molliformis is an tufted annual occurring in France, Italy, California, Idaho, and New Mexico. The culms are tall. The subspecies has a contracted panicle about long, with villous spikelets. The pubescent lemmas are long and have rounded margins. The scabrid awns are somewhat erect. The subspecies grows as a weed in cultivated areas, typically in dry soils but rarely in wetlands. Bromus hordeaceus subsp. pseudothominii occurs in Europe and sporadically throughout North America. The culms are tall. The panicles are up to long. The typically glabrous lemmas are long. The awns are straight and erect. The subspecies can be mistaken for Bromus lepidus in its similar lemma form and characteristics. It grows in meadows and grasslands. Bromus hordeaceus subsp. thominei, the lesser soft brome, occurs in West Europe and the western United States, in California and the Pacific coast of Canada. The culms are long. The panicles are long and often consist of a single spikelet. The pubescent or glabrous lemmas are long, with bluntly angled margins. The awns can become divaricate when mature. The subspecies grows in waste areas and sandy soils or dunes. The subspecies has a diploid number of 28.

It is also known by the repeating first line of the text, \\"Deep peace\\". The work was commissioned by the Chancel Choir of First United Methodist Church, Omaha, Nebraska, for their conductor Mel Olson. It was published first in 1978 by Hinshaw Music, by Oxford University Press and by the Royal School of Church Music.  History, text and music  The piece was commissioned by the Chancel Choir of First United Methodist Church in Omaha, Nebraska, for their conductor Mel Olson in 1978. Rutter, an Anglican, set many biblical texts for Christian services. The format of the text is based in a similar format to that found in some Celtic Christian prayers and songs, such as those found in the Christian- era Scottish Gaelic collection, the Carmina Gadelica. Rutter has said that his English-only composition is based on \\"an old Gaelic rune\\", and that he added a line mentioning Jesus and the word Amen, to make it also a Christian anthem. However, most surviving prayers with this structure, in both Gaelic and English, already include Christian elements. The original, English-language piece that the central lines of Rutter's piece are directly excerpted from, published in the 1895 novel, The Dominion of Dreams: Under the Dark Star, by Celtic Revival writer William Sharp / Fiona Macleod, while not containing the words \\"Jesus,\\" or \\"Amen,\\" does mention both \\"the Son of Peace\\" and \\"the heart of Mary,\\" along with other Christian imagery. Both Sharp's and Rutter's compositions begin every line with \\"deep peace\\", and refer in a repetitive manner to the elements of nature, such as, \\"running wave\\", \\"flowing air\\", \\"quiet earth\\", \\"shining stars\\", \\"gentle night\\", \\"healing light\\", and (in Rutter's version) to \\"Christ, light of the world\\". The almost-identical nature of the two pieces, along with Rutter's comments on his additions, mark Sharp's 1895 English-language composition as the original. Rutter scored the piece for four vocal parts (SATB) and organ, or orchestra. Marked \\"Flowing and tranquil\\", the music is in E major and 3/4 time. The organ accompaniment rests on a pattern of chords held often for a full measure in the left hand, and broken chords in eighth-notes in the right hand. The choir voices enter together, with the lower voices also moving slowly like the left hand (a full measure for \\"Deep\\", another one for \\"peace\\"), while the soprano pronounces \\"peace\\" sooner and moves up in eighth-notes on \\"running wave\\". The pattern is kept for most of the piece. Dynamically, the music begins softly (p), growing slightly (to mp) for the \\"shining stars\\", and again later for \\"moon and stars\\". A climax is \\"Christ\\", marked crescendo to a strong (f) \\"light of the world\\" (with all voices holding the word \\"light\\" for more than a measure), but diminuendo to a very soft ending, with all voices and the accompaniment calming to slow movement.  Performances and recordings  The composition is characterized as slow-paced and of a gentle nature. It was published first in 1987 by Hinshaw Music, but then, like other music by John Rutter, by Oxford University Press (also in versions with harp or with string orchestra) and by the Royal School of Church Music. It has been recorded in collections of Rutter's choral works performed under his direction by the Cambridge Singers and the City of London Sinfonia. Together with the composer's Requiem, it was recorded in 2010 by the choir Polyphony and the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, conducted by Stephen Layton.

Ulster Says No was the name and slogan of a unionist mass protest campaign against the provisions of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement which gave the government of the Republic of Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland. For British unionists (those who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom), this was seen as foreign interference in the internal affairs of the UK. For Irish nationalists, those provisions were seen as a start at fixing the democratic problem of lack of political representation of the large minority of Irish nationalists in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Says No campaign was led by Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley. After the signing of the Anglo- Irish Agreement by British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, unionist leaders stated that the agreement to allow the Republic's government its new role needed to be put before the Northern Ireland electorate in a referendum and organised a vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly to that effect.Anglo Irish Agreement Chronology, CAIN website Irish republican party Sinn Féin also objected (albeit for different reasons).Reactions to the AIA For similar reasons, in the Irish Parliament, the main opposition party Fianna Fáil also voted against.

Over the next 36 hours these areas were battered by the system's strong winds and torrential rain, which caused extensive flooding, damage, loss of life and the grounding of a long bulk carrier. The strongest observed wind gusts were at Norah Head and at Newcastle. Impact The New South Wales Premier, Morris Iemma, declared a natural disaster for the affected areas. More than 105,000 homes had been left without power. Rainfall had exceeded in the Hunter region and in parts of the Central Coast and Sydney. Nearly 6,000 State Emergency Service volunteers, including crews from across New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Queensland and Victoria worked in the area, having responded to over 10,000 calls for assistance. Aftermath A family of four and a nephew were killed when a section of road collapsed under their car as they drove along the Pacific Highway at Somersby on the Central Coast. Two people died when their four-wheel drive was swept off a bridge by floodwaters at Clarence Town and a man died near Lambton when he was swept into a storm- water drain. The following day, a man died when a tree fell onto his vehicle at Brunkerville. Another man died during a house fire that, it is believed, was started by a candle being used during the blackouts caused by the storm. The total death toll rose to ten. Rescues The unladen bulk carrier ran aground on Nobbys Beach at Newcastle, after its captain failed to heed a warning to move out to sea to escape the approaching storm. The Newcastle Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service used both of their aircraft to winch the Pasha Bulker crew of 22 to safety, transporting them to Nobbys Beach parking lot. However, on completion of the rescue, the aircraft had to abandon the flight back to their Broadmeadow base due to lack of visibility and dangerously strong winds. On the evening of Sunday 10 June, approximately 4,000 residents in riverside communities of central Maitland, South Maitland and Lorn were forced to evacuate their homes in anticipation that the Hunter River would breach its levee system. Evacuation centres were set up at East Maitland and Maitland High School. However, by the morning of 11 June the floodwater had peaked without breaking the levee bank.

Strachan came through the youth system at Partick Thistle and played almost 90 matches for the senior side, including a season in the Scottish Premier League. Since leaving The Jags, Strachan has only played in the Scottish Football League, with such clubs as Ross County, Dumbarton, Albion Rovers, Clyde, Stenhousemuir and latterly Arbroath as well as in Junior football with Clydebank, Irvine Meadow and Glenafton Athletic. Career Strachan was a product of the Partick Thistle youth system, having been signed from Partick Thistle Boys Club. Thought to have a huge future ahead of him, Strachan was man-of-the- match in his debut as a 16-year-old in an SPL mach versus Livingston.Ex- Partick Thistle footballer caught in possession of heroin is sacked by his latest club as he faces return to prison In season 2006–07, Strachan was a key player and fans favourite but the following season, due to Stevie Murray playing in his position, Strachan didn't feature in the team regularly enough and was rarely selected to play under Ian McCall. Strachan left Thistle by mutual consent in December 2007, ending a near four-year stint with the club. Strachan then signed for Ross County on 2 January 2008 and played in 42 matches, scoring eight goals and was a key player during the Dingwall club's time in the Scottish Second and then First Division. After an alleged incident with his girlfriend Strachan was released by the Dingwall club. In July 2009, Strachan went on trial with First Division club Greenock Morton. Strachan made his first appearance as a substitute in Austria, scoring the Inverclyde club's consolation goal in a 6–1 defeat by Slovakia champions Slovan Bratislava. In September 2009, Strachan signed for Third Division champions Dumbarton. After just two matches for Sons, Strachan was loaned to fellow Third Division club Albion Rovers. After being released by Dumbarton, Strachan signed for Clyde on a free transfer in January 2010. After impressing as a trialist, Strachan signed for Arbroath on 25 February 2011 until the end of that season. After agreeing in principle to extend his contract with the Red Lichties, Strachan changed his mind after a summer holiday. Strachan then played a couple of trial matches for Junior club Clydebank and later signed a short-term deal with the Bankies. In December 2012, Strachan was jailed for 12 months for possession of knives in the area of Maryhill in Glasgow. Strachan had previously avoided jail for an alleged assault on his girlfriend. Strachan returned to the Bankies following his release from prison in 2013. Before joining Irvine Meadow later that season, Strachan was caught with 28 grams of heroin when police searched his friend's flat in Maryhill in Glasgow and plead guilty to the charge in February 2014. Strachan was subsequently released by Clydebank and returned to prison in March 2014. He was released after 10 months' imprisonment and joined Glenafton Athletic in July 2014. Strachan then signed for East Kilbride in June 2015. Strachan moved to Lowland League rivals BSC Glasgow in 2018. During a league game against Whitehill Welfare, Strachan suffered a horrific ankle injury that may have ended his playing career.
