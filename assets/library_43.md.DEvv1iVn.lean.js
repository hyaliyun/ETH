The bridge crosses the river in Buchanan County, between Marion Township on the east, and Washington Township on the west. Confederate partisans planned to burn the lower timbers of the 160-foot bridge across the river, leaving the top looking intact. At 11:15 p.m. on a moonless night, the westbound passenger train from Hannibal, Missouri, to St. Joseph started to cross the bridge. The supports cracked and gave way. The locomotive flipped, falling 30 feet into the shallow river and bringing with it the freight cars, baggage car, mail car and two passenger cars with 100 men, women and children. Bodies and the injured were taken to the Patee House near the St. Joseph depot. Union soldiers were ordered to track down and execute bushwhackers for their part in the incident. Barclay Coppock.photo from: Confederate Major General Sterling Price, who had been invading northern Missouri at the time, wrote Union commanding general Henry Wager Halleck to protest, stating the sabotage was \\"lawful and proper\\" according to the rules of warfare and that the captured men should be treated as prisoners of war. Halleck replied that the bushwhackers were \\"spies, marauders, robbers, incendiaries, guerrilla bands...in the garb of peaceful citizens\\" The bushwhackers were to also say that it was a military target because there were soldiers on it bound for Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. One of the soldiers killed was Barclay Coppock, a member of John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. The bushwackers were also to claim that it was an attempt to assassinate former Missouri Governor Robert Marcellus Stewart. The most prominent of the bushwhackers sought by the Federal troops was Silas M. Gordon. Union troops were to burn Platte City, Missouri twice (in December 1861 and July 1864) in unsuccessful attempts to force the townspeople to surrender him (see the Burning of Platte City). The railroad at the time was the first to cross the state of Missouri and it was used to deliver mail to and from the Pony Express terminus in St. Joseph, Missouri. Col. Ulysses S. Grant's first commission in the Civil War had been guarding the trains. In August he was promoted to brigadier general on a new assignment.

Plot Spock travels back to the time and place of Here Come the Brides, a 1968-70 ABC television series loosely based upon Asa Mercer's efforts to bring civilization to 1860s Seattle by importing the marriageable Mercer Girls from the war-ravaged East Coast of the United States. The show's premise was that eldest brother Jason Bolt bet his entire logging operation that he could persuade one hundred marriageable ladies to come to Seattle, and that all of them would be married or engaged within one year. Much of the dramatic and comic tension revolved around the efforts of their benefactor Aaron Stemple to thwart the deal and take control of the Bolts' holdings. Spock discovers a Klingon plot to destroy the Federation by killing Aaron Stemple before Stemple could thwart an attempted 19th-century alien invasion of Earth. During most of the story, Spock has lost his memory and is cared for by Stemple, who passes him off as his nephew \\"Ishmael\\" and helps him hide his alien origins. Spock identifies one of the women in the story as likely to be one of his ancestors (on his mother's side). Spock's family name The book ends with Kirk accessing the personnel record of his first officer, which reveals that Amanda Grayson's middle name is Stemple and that she was born in Seattle, Washington, thereby suggesting that Spock's mother is a descendant of Aaron Stemple; as a result of Spock being with Aaron Stemple, Stemple falls in love with Biddy the plainest of the girls. He asks her to marry him just before the Klingons arrive to try and kill Stemple. The same personnel record gives Spock's full name as S'chn T'gai Spock and his father as S'chn T'gai Sarek. Spock's family name has never been revealed on screen and only referred to as \\"unpronounceable\\" to humans (in the episodes \\"This Side of Paradise\\" and \\"Journey to Babel\\"). Although S'chn T'gai has yet to be accepted as the character's family name in canon, the forenames for Sulu and Uhura first proposed in other Pocket Books Star Trek novels of this period (Hikaru and Nyota respectively) have subsequently been accepted as canon by Paramount, as evidenced by the usage of both names in the 2009 feature film. Cameos, References, and Meta Numerous other Western and science fiction characters make cameo appearances throughout the book. In San Francisco, Spock plays chess with a gunfighter dressed in black, which matches the description of Richard Boone's character Paladin in the TV series Have Gun Will Travel (pages 180-182). Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is credited for writing 24 episodes of this series. The British TV series Doctor Who is referenced at least four times: the Fourth Doctor is described on page 13, Metebelis crystals from the serials The Green Death and Planet of the Spiders are mentioned on page 57, the Second Doctor is described on page 154, and Kirk recalls legends of a planet of stagnant time-travellers in the Kasteroborous galaxy on page 200. Page 13 features Han Solo (\\"a scruffy-looking spice smuggler\\") from Star Wars, as well as Apollo and Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica (\\"a pair of brown-uniformed pilots from some down-at-the-heels migrant fleet\\"). Pages 153-154 feature Little Joe Cartwright and his brother Hoss Cartwright from Bonanza (\\"a good-looking boy in the dusty clothes of a trailhand just in from Virginia City, and his oxlike older brother\\") and Bret or Bart Maverick from Maverick. Emperor Norton and his dogs also appear. Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke), Lucas McCain (The Rifleman), The Rawhide Kid (Rawhide), and the Man With No Name also make appearances. Several actors from Here Come the Brides had also appeared on Star Trek. Mark Lenard played Aaron Stemple, whom the novel implies was Spock's ancestor. Lenard also played the role of Sarek, Spock's father, in the original Star Trek TV series, as well as a Romulan commander in the episode \\"Balance of Terror\\" (the first time the Romulans are seen in the series). The actor playing Jason Bolt (the eldest brother) was Robert Brown who played \\"Lazarus\\" in the Star Trek episode \\"The Alternative Factor.\\" The actor playing Joshua Bolt (a younger brother) was David Soul who played \\"Makora\\" in the Star Trek episode \\"The Apple.\\" Another reference is Florinda's Place, referenced on page 181.

In this series of minor skirmish actions, advance patrols of Pennsylvania militia encountered a British foraging expedition and were overrun. The British pushed ahead to Matson's Ford, where units of the Continental Army were making their way across the Schuylkill River. The Americans retreated to the far side, destroying their temporary bridge across the Schuylkill. The British left the area the next day to continue foraging elsewhere; the Continentals crossed the river at Swede's Ford (present-day Norristown), a few miles upriver from Matson's Ford. Background Following the British capture of New York City in a 1776 campaign, British commander Lieutenant General General William Howe turned his thoughts to capturing the seat of the Second Continental Congress, Philadelphia. In July 1777 he embarked about 18,000 troops on transports in New York, and sailed to the northern reaches of the Chesapeake Bay.McGuire, p. 71 Landing his troops there in late August, he defeated the Continental Army of Major General George Washington at the September 11 Battle of Brandywine, and occupied Philadelphia without opposition on September 25 after Washington was forced to retreat west of the city.For details on the campaign up to Philadelphia, see McGuire, pp. 117 and after In early December 1777, General Howe led a sizable contingent of troops out of British-occupied Philadelphia in one last attempt to destroy Washington's army before the onset of winter. At the Battle of White Marsh (December 5-8), Washington successfully repelled the British attacks, and Howe returned to Philadelphia without engaging Washington in a decisive conflict. After the battle, Washington and his troops remained encamped at White Marsh. Prelude On December 10, George Washington's council determined that the Continental Army would move to winter quarters somewhere west of the Schuylkill River. The army struck camp the morning of December 11, and proceeded to march through Plymouth Meeting, across Ridge Road, and down to the river crossing at Matson's Ford (following the route of present-day Butler Pike). In preparation for the crossing, Washington ordered the Pennsylvania militia, under the command of General James Potter, to establish three advance pickets west of the river to warn of British troop movements: one at Middle Ferry (where Market Street now crosses the Schuylkill River), another at Black Horse Inn at City Line and Old Lancaster Road, and the third at Harriton House (the home of Charles Thomson, secretary of the Continental Congress) on Old Gulph Road. Unbeknownst to the Americans, General Charles Cornwallis led a sizable British force out of the city on a foraging expedition early that morning. Cornwallis was also apparently unaware of the Continental Army movement, and had planned to forage in the area just south of Matson's Ford. Employing a local resident named John Roberts (who despite protestations that he acted under duress, was convicted and hanged in 1778 for assisting Cornwallis) as a guide, Cornwallis crossed the Schuylkill at Middle Ferry, drawing a round of musket fire from the American picket there before it withdrew. Cornwallis then proceeded up the road toward Matson's Ford.Reed, p. 384 His force consisted of brigades of British light infantry and grenadiers, one brigade of regular infantry, two troops of dragoons, and a detachment of German j√§gers. The force took with them six 6-pound cannons.Ewald, p. 110 Battle Soon after, the militia stationed at the Black Horse Inn exchanged fire with the British troops. Outnumbered and flanked, the militia began to fall back in some confusion, taking casualties along the way.Reed, p. 385 Reports were delivered to Potter, who was with the contingent located at Harriton House, indicating that the British were \\"advancing in force\\" up Gulph Road and towards his location. Potter stationed five regiments of militia between the British forces and Harriton House. However, the militia were quickly overrun and they hastily retreated back through Gulph Mills to Swede's Ford (present-day Norristown). The retreat was so chaotic that militiamen literally threw away their muskets and ammunition as they ran (an offense for which they would later be fined or publicly whipped). With the militia in retreat, Cornwallis discontinued pursuit and took up a strong position on the heights overlooking Matson's Ford. General Potter estimated his casualties at 5 or killed, 20 wounded, and 20 taken prisoner, although he also claimed he was \\"not able to assurtain\\" the full extent of his losses. He believed the British casualties to be higher than his.Reed, p. 388 J√§ger Captain Johann Ewald recorded that the British captured about 160 men in the battle \\"after a stubborn resistance\\". Aftermath The day after the battle, two Continental Army divisions under the command of General John Sullivan constructed a temporary bridge made from wagons that had been lashed together, and began crossing at Matson's Ford. Those divisions had almost completed crossing the river when the British position on the heights was spotted. Sullivan quickly ordered a retreat back across the river, and destroyed the makeshift bridge behind him. The Continental Army spent December 11‚Äì12 in the hills above Swede's Ford, while Washington sent out scouting parties on December 12 to determine the extent of the British force across the river. However, Cornwallis had already left the area, beginning a roundabout route that brought him back to Philadelphia with a load of provisions.Reed, p. 390 On the evening of December 12, Washington's army crossed the Schuylkill River at Swede's Ford using makeshift wagon bridges and proceeded down Swedeland Road to Gulph Mills, where they remained from December 13 till December 19.

It is noted for its mining heritage, dating back to the 1880s. Geography Silver Valley is a narrow valley about in length, east of the city of Coeur d'Alene. The South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River flows through the valley and Interstate 90 traverses the valley between Fourth of July Pass to the west and Lookout Pass on the Montana border. Several towns are located in the valley, all in Shoshone County. These include (from west to east) Pinehurst, Smelterville, Kellogg, Wardner, Osburn, Silverton, Wallace, and Mullan. The Silver Valley has also been referred to as the Coeur d'Alene Valley and the Coeur d'Alene Mining District. History A party of twelve miners led by Elias Davidson Pierce found gold in Orofino Creek, a tributary of the Clearwater River, in 1860. The ensuing gold rush continued through 1875 before slowing. Among the prospectors who came north seeking gold in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains was Andrew J. Prichard, who found gold in the alluvial sands of a creek near present-day Murray, Idaho in 1883. Later in the year, prospectors entered present day Burke Canyon seeking placer gold along Canyon Creek. Disputes over pay, hours of work and the right of minors to join unions resulted in the 1892 Coeur d'Alene labor strike and the 1899 Coeur d'Alene labor confrontation. By 1903, Burke Canyon was the most developed mining region in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains and was home to seven dividend-paying mines: the Gem of the Mountains, Frisco, Mammoth, Standard, Hecla, Tiger- Poorman and Hercules mines. Other mines soon began production throughout the Coeur d'Alene mining district, including the Bunker Hill Mine (1886), Star- Morning Mine (1887), Sunshine Mine (1890), Galena Mine (1922) and Lucky Friday Mine (1942). A devastating wildfire swept through the area in August 1910 as lightning- and human-caused fires, fanned by strong winds and dry conditions, consumed three million acres and damaged or destroyed Wallace, Kellogg, Osburn, Burke and Murray. During the fire, Ed Pulaski, a U.S. Forest Service ranger led a crew of forty-five men into an abandoned prospect mine near Wallace, saving thirty-nine lives. After WWII the district included 34 concentrating mills and 24 mines. The largest operations included Bunker Hill, Sunshine, Day, Federal and Hecla. Although miners were originally lured to the general area by the promise of gold, the primary metals mined in the valley were silver, zinc, and lead. The total quantities produced are impressive: over a billion ounces of silver, 3 million tons of zinc, and 8 million tons of lead totalling over $6 billion in value, ranking the valley among the top ten mining districts in world history. During the 1970s, nearly half of the nation's silver production came from the Silver Valley. The area experienced a history of turbulent disputes between miners and mine owners more than a century ago. After nearly a century of vigorous mining and smelting activity, operations were severely curtailed in the early 1980s, resulting in massive unemployment and a significant loss of population. In addition to the economic difficulties, the valley has been saddled with significant environmental challenges. Bunker Hill smelter in operation during the 1970s While some mining operations remain, the Silver Valley has focused its future upon recreational tourism and light manufacturing. The nearest major population center is the city of Spokane, Washington, which is west along I-90. The growing recreational city of Coeur d'Alene is halfway in between. The extensive restoration efforts can be seen in the return of the tundra swans. Restoration means returning an area to its healthy natural habitat.http://restorationpartnership.org The Idaho Geological Survey lists several active and inactive mines in the Silver Valley: * Active ** Lucky Friday mine ** Galena Complex, consisting of: *** Coeur Mine *** Galena Mine * Inactive, but with resources in the ground: ** Bunker Hill Mine and Smelting Complex ** Sunshine Mine Geology Pyromorphite specimen from the Bunker Hill Mine The Coeur d'Alene (Silver Valley) Mining District is located in Proterozoic metasediments. The mined portion of the stratigraphic column in the Silver Valley, known as the Belt series, can be divided into six main formations, three of which have upper and lower parts. These are, from oldest to youngest: the Prichard Formation (lower and upper), Burke Formation, Revett Formation, St. Regis Formation (lower and upper), Wallace Formation (lower and upper), and Striped Peak Formation. Of these, all but the Striped Peak are ore-bearing. All six of these formations are primarily composed of quartzite and argillite. Some limestone and dolomite also occur in the Wallace and Prichard, and a smaller amount of carbonate occurs in the St. Regis. Ripple marks and mud cracks occur throughout the series. Together, these imply a shallow marine depositional environment. The mining district occurs along the intersection of two major regional structural features. A large anticline extends through the district, running in a north-northwesterly direction. The Lewis and Clark line ‚Äì a series of strike-slip faults running across the Pacific Northwest ‚Äì crosses this anticline, generally trending in an east-west direction. Within this mining district, the major structure of the lineament is the Osburn fault, which runs directly through the district‚Äôs most successful silver belts. Its 16-mile (27 km) displacement divides the district into two distinct parts, the southern Page Galena Belt, and the northern Golconda Lucky Friday Belt. Three main minerals make up most of the ore production in the Silver Valley. Galena (PbS or lead(II) sulfide) is the most important ore mineral found in the Coeur d‚ÄôAlene District veins. Galena is present in veins throughout the district. Sphalerite ((Zn,Fe)S) is the second most important ore mineral, present in at least small amounts in most veins. The sphalerite is an important source of zinc throughout the ore belts. The third most abundant ore mineral is tetrahedrite (Cu,Fe)12Sb4S13. However, the tetrahedrite is responsible for the majority of the silver produced by the Silver Valley, as it‚Äôs the tetrahedrite interspersed in the galena of the district that makes it so argentiferous. 1907 Geologic map of the Silver Valley in Idaho, and the location of the Osburn Fault. Also included are the locations of the towns of Kellogg, Osburn, Wallace and Mullan (west to east). Outdoor recreation Wallace, Idaho is nicknamed the \\"Silver Capital of the World\\" There are two alpine ski areas in the Silver Valley, both easily accessible from I-90. Lookout Pass is at the east end of the valley on the Montana border adjacent to the freeway. Silver Mountain is thirty miles west, accessed from the Kellogg city limits by the world's longest single-stage passenger gondola, a quarter mile (400 m) from the highway. Bicycling is fast becoming a key recreational pursuit for both locals and tourists in the Silver Valley, with trails and paths ranging from easy to extreme. In addition to the challenging lift-served mountain-bike trails at Silver Mountain, there are two new major bike paths in the vicinity that use old railroad grades. Lookout Pass ski area is also a primary staging area for the unique Route of The Hiawatha rail-trail, which begins in Montana and runs downhill through tunnels and over trestles to the North Fork of the St. Joe River, 15 miles (24 km) away. The trail is named for the Olympian Hiawatha passenger trains of the Milwaukee Road railroad, on whose abandoned tracks, trestles, and tunnels the gravel trail rests. One of the tunnels (Taft) is over 1.6 miles (2.6 km) in length. When completed, the Route of The Hiawatha will stretch from St. Regis, Montana to the very remote Pearson, Idaho, several miles north of Avery, (equidistantly south of Mullan). The other trail is the Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes, completed in 2004. The paved bike path runs more than 72 miles (115 km), starting from Mullan in the east. It follows the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River down through the Silver Valley to the south end of Lake Coeur d'Alene, passing over a historic bridge, then up to Plummer in northwest Benewah County. The bike trail uses old right-of-way from the Union Pacific railroad.

The village population is approximately 400 people. GingÃ±olx is one of four NisgÃ±a‚Äôa villages that make up the NisgÃ±a‚Äôa Nation. The community itself has four clans which are Killer Whale, Eagle, Raven and Wolf. GingÃ±olx village government consists of 1 chief and 5 councillors The name GingÃ±olx comes from the NisgÃ±a‚Äôa language words meaning \\"scalp givers.\\" Gin means \\"to give\\" and golx means \\"scalps\\" When attacked by another nation or when the land was intruded, the people of GingÃ±olx fought back and won. They hung their enemies' scalps on sticks, lining them up along the river as a warning. Gin means to give, and gÃ±olx means place of scalps. Modern history GingÃ±olx was founded as a permanent settlement in 1867 by the Christian missionaries who came down river by raft. The founder of the mission was the Rev. Robert Tomlinson, an Anglican medical missionary who succeeded the Rev. Robert A. Doolan, who had begun the Anglican Nass mission at Greenville, a.k.a. LaxÃ±gÃ±alts ºap. GingÃ±olx's first European type buildings (including houses, a school, and a church) were all built in 1879. GingÃ±olx was originally inhabited by two clans pre-contact. The first clan was Daaxan of the Killerwhale clan, they inhabited the eastern side of the village, and the second clan was Gitxun, the eagle clan, they inhabited the western side of the village. the community is an ancient village that was in place far beyond 1867 In the 1890s the Rev. William Henry Collison joined Tomlinson at the mission. He died there in 1922, and his memoirs describe the community in detail. Kincolith mission settlement, late 19th or early 20th Century Isolation Because of its location on the Nass River near the Alaska Panhandle, GingÃ±olx was once an isolated village, the only ways able to get in being boat or plane. This isolation combined with the surrounding mountains meant GingÃ±olx would often suffer power outages due to snow during the winter months. Residents could go as long as 3 weeks without power until helicopters could be flown in to fix the lines. In 2003, a 28 km road from GingÃ±olx to Greenville was completed, which connected GingÃ±olx to the other three NisgÃ±a‚Äôa communities. This road, the Kincolith Extension Highway, links GingÃ±olx to the Nisga'a Highway with connections to the Yellowhead, and Cassiar Highways and cost $34 million to build. In 2010, the Supreme Court of Canada released a landmark decision in the Tercon Contractors vs British Columbia case, awarding $3 million in damages to Tercon. The subject of that case was the tendering process, in which the court found the government had improperly awarded the contract to a company which was not an authorized bidder, and the contract in question was the contract to build this road from GingÃ±olx to LaxÃ±gÃ±alts ºap.Tercon Contractors Ltd. v. British Columbia, The Rest Of The Story, Laila Yuile, I'm Laila Yuile and This Is How I See It, Feb. 17 2010 Economy GingÃ±olx's geographic location means fishing, forestry, and tourism are its main sources of revenue. Education The community is served by School District 92 Nisga'a and hosts Nathan Barton Elementary School. The secondary school is in Gitlakdamix. Culture and recreation GingÃ±olx has its own concert band and GingÃ±olx Ceremonial Dancers, who perform at weddings, funerals, and other occasions such as Crabfest, Seafest, River Boat Days, and the NisgÃ±a‚Äôa New Year celebration, Hobiyee. Hobiyee is an annual celebration, in the older days, when the moon was shaped like a bowl, the first person to see it would shout, HOOBIXIM YEE. It was a celebration and recognition that wild life would be in abundance again. Hiking and mountaineering is common, and one of the nearby mountains has a \\"look-out\\" which offers brilliant views from three stages on the trail. In 1947, the Sons of Kincolith won the inaugural All Native Basketball Tournament. Crabfest This annual summer outdoor music festival, was started in 2004 by Community Development Worker Ellen Torng, with the assistance of local resident, Nadine Clayton until the end of 2005. Crabfest has since been coordinated by Michele Stevens along with the GingÃ±olx Arts Society Board. It has attracted many tourists due to its eye catching headliners and entertaining musicians. The festival is two days in length and has featured such well known names as Trooper, Chilliwack, Prairie Oyster, Doc Walker, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show, Jeff Healey, Tom Lavin of the Powder Blues Band, Nazareth, Tom Cochrane, Murray Porter, 54-40, and the Legends of London among other local bands, and tribute bands from across Canada, and the United States. The festival is centered on the medium-sized stage set up and is accompanied by the many vendors lining the streets. The stage itself is monitored by professional sound and lighting crews. Crabfest has been a success for the small town of GingÃ±olx bringing in tourists from around the world, boosting the economy greatly with the effects felt well after the festival is over. There has been negative effects of the festival itself. The abundant supply of Chinook Salmon in the river bordering the town has been largely untapped by tourists until the lure of the music led to the discovery of the large salmon and has caused the number of spawning salmon to drop below natural levels. This has led to the closure of fishing on the river which may lead to a large drop in tourism apart from the crabfest.

It was established as a 107 hectare reserve in 1974 for preserving and protecting the rare Oriental plane-tree. The area of the reserve was slightly reduced by 10 hectares in October 1980. The reserve covers the area around the Besitchay of the southeastern part of Minor Caucasus.  History  Earlier, Oriental plane-tree was widely distributed throughout the territory of the Azerbaijan Republic. At the same time, not excluding the south-eastern part of the level of the Lesser Caucasus. Today, plane trees can be found only in some parts of this country. In the Basutchay basin, plane groves have been protected in the reserve mode for more than 25 years. Plane forests, which were located on the areas of Zangilan forestry, since February 1961 have become a conservation area. The Main Department of Forestry of the Council of Ministers of the Republic is responsible for its protection and restoration while creating forest cultures. But since such a grove protection system was unjustified, the Basutchay Reserve was created in 117 hectares in July 1974. Since October 1980, the reserve's area is 107 hectares of land, of which 100 hectares are forest, and in the rest of the territory the rock slides and the sands of the Basutchay floodplain extend.  Geography  The reserve is located in Zangilan district. It is located 8 km from the town of Zangilan. The reserve was established in the valley of the Basutchay River, in the southeastern part of the Lesser Caucasus. It was created to protect the plane tree grove. Its territory is occupied mainly by the Basaltchay near-riverine sites and continues for about 15 km along the valley. It has a width of 150‚Äì200 m. It extends to the upper course of the Shikahogh River, which is located in the territory of the Armenian Republic, where it is also guarded. The reserve is located at an altitude of 630‚Äì800 m above sea level. It is located on the border zone in the west with the forests of the Armenian Republic.  Relief  Physico-geographical environment Basutchay Valley has an asymmetrical structure. So the right side of the valley is very steep, mountainous, and the left side is flatter, which is located on a hilly plate with an absolute height of 700‚Äì1000 m. Alluvial sediments cover the terraces of the valley. The tributaries of the Basutchay strongly dismembered the slopes of the valley.  Climate  The territory of the reserve is dominated by a moderately warm climate. Summer is hot and winter is mild. The average annual temperature of the atmosphere is 13.3 ¬∞. The average temperature in winter is 1 ¬∞. The average summer temperature is 25.3 ¬∞. Absolute maximum 41 ¬∞. The absolute minimum is ‚Äì21 ¬∞. The sum of temperatures above 10 ¬∞ per year reaches 4200 ¬∞. For the period from November 23 to March 24, frosts fall. Annual precipitation reaches more than 600 mm. Most of them are in spring and early summer. The minimum amount of precipitation falls in December (14 mm), and the maximum in May (90 mm). Most of the precipitation falls in the warm season. For a year it can be up to 25 days with a snow cover of 10‚Äì30 cm. The level of annual evaporation is 900 mm (from 29 mm in January to 170 mm in July). relative humidity has an average of 66% (from 51% in July to 77% in November). Despite the continental climate, the forest cover normally consists of various broad- leaved species. Eastern sycamore tree is quite a hardy tree species that suffers intense heat (45‚Äì50 ¬∞), frosts (‚Äî20, ‚Äî25 ¬∞), drought (200 mm annual rainfall) and high moistening (1000 mm annual rainfall).  Soil  The earth cover of the reserve and its environs is covered with two types of soil: brown mountain forest and alluvial meadow-forest. Plane is unpretentious to the soil. It grows on any soils, even on a stony substrate, on alluvial sediments and strongly skeletal, infertile soils. Nevertheless, the plane tree forms more productive forests on powerful fertile irrigated soils.  Flora and fauna  The main purpose of creating the reserve was to preserve the largest grove in the world, the eastern plane tree, which grows on 93.5% of the reserve's territory. The average age of local plane trees is 170 years. Individual giant trees, 50 meters in height and with a trunk diameter of up to 4 meters, are 1200‚Äì1500 years old. In addition to plane trees, here grows an oak, a Caucasian hornbeam, a juniper, a multiple fruit. The rare guests of the reserve are wild boar, roe deer, wolf, jackal, badger and hare, entering the reserve from the neighboring forests. The nature of the reserve has much in common with the Shikahogh Reserve. Plane trees The plane-trees make up 93.5% of Basut-Chay State Reserve area. In average, plane-trees live for 170 years. However, one can come across the plane-trees 1200‚Äì1500 years of age, 50 meters in height and 4 meters in diameter. The Basut-Chay State Reserve is occupied by Armenian forces and does not operate at present.

The American Medical Association conducted an investigation of medical peer review in 2007 and concluded that while it is easy to allege misconduct and 15% of surveyed physicians indicated that they were aware of peer review misuse or abuse, cases of malicious peer review able to be proven through the legal system are rare.\\"Inappropriate Peer Review. Report of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association.\\" Legal basis Those who maintain that sham peer review is a pervasive problem suggest that the Healthcare Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) of 1986 allows sham reviews by granting significant immunity from liability to doctors and others who participate in peer reviews. This immunity extends to investigative activities as well as to any associated peer review hearing, whether or not it leads to a disciplinary (or other) action. The definition of a peer review body can be broad, including not only individuals but also (for example, in Oregon), \\"tissue committees, governing bodies or committees including medical staff committees of a [licensed] health care facility...or any other medical group in connection with bona fide medical research, quality assurance, utilization review, credentialing, education, training, supervision or discipline of physicians or other health care providers.\\" The California legislature framed its statutes so as to allow \\"aggrieved physicians the opportunity to prove that the peer review to which they were subject was in fact carried out for improper purposes, i.e., for purposes unrelated to assuring quality care or patient safety\\". These statutes allow that a peer review can be found in court to have been improper due to bad faith or malice, in which case the peer reviewers' immunities from civil liability \\"fall by the wayside\\". Those who practice sham peer review could draw out the process by legal maneuvering, and the fairness of a peer review that has been unduly delayed has been called into question. Many medical staff laws specify guidelines for the timeliness of peer review, in compliance with JCAHO standards. Medical peer review process The medical peer review system is a quasi-judicial one. It is modeled in some ways on the grand jury / petit jury system. After a complainant asks for an investigation, a review body is assembled for fact- finding. This fact-finding body, called an ad hoc committee, is appointed by the medical Chief of Staff and is composed of other physician staff members chosen at the Chief of Staff's discretion. This ad hoc committee then conducts an investigation in the manner it feels is appropriate. This may include a review of the literature or an outside expert. Thus, there is no standard for impartiality and specifically no standard for due process in the \\"peer-review 'process' .\\" Once the physician has been indicted (and sanctioned) he or she then has the right to request a hearing. At the hearing, counsel is allowed. A second independent panel of physicians is chosen as the petit jury, and a hearing officer is chosen. The accused physician has the option to demonstrate conflicts of interest and attempt to disqualify jurors based on reasonable suspicions of bias or conflicts of interest in a voir dire process. Although some medical staff bodies utilize the hospital attorney and accept hospital funds to try peer review cases, the California Medical Association discourages this practice. California has enacted legislation formally requiring the separation of the hospital and medical staff. Alleged cases Some physicians allege that sham peer review is often conducted in retaliation for whistleblowing, although one study in 2007 suggested that such events were rare. Khajavi v. Feather River Anesthesiology Medical Group Those who disagree with the AMA point to the case of Nosrat Khajavi. In 1996, Khajavi, an anesthesiologist in Yuba City, California, disagreed with a surgeon over the appropriateness of cataract surgery for a patient and refused to attend during the procedure. Khajavi was subsequently terminated from his anesthesia group. He sued for wrongful termination under California Business & Professions' Code Section 2053, and the suit was allowed by the California Court of Appeals. In 2000, the court held that Khajavi was not protected from termination on the basis of advocating for what he felt was medically appropriate care. The court did not rule on the merits of the dispute. Mileikowsky v. Tenet A doctor was allegedly subject to multiple hearings for the same charges, and his rights to an expedited hearing were allegedly denied while a suspension was in place. On May 15, 2001, the California Medical Association filed an amicus curiae brief to emphasize legal protections meant to prevent physicians being arbitrarily excluded from access to healthcare facilities based on mechanisms such as summary suspension without a speedy hearing. This case was decided on April 18, 2005. The court ruled that the hearing officer in the case could indeed terminate the physician's peer review hearing based on grounds that the physician refused to cooperate on procedural and other matters necessary for the good conduct of the proceedings. Thus, the physician lost his membership and privileges at the hospital.Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem (April 18, 2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 531, 27 Cal.Rptr.3d 171. Ironically, the same physician was brought into a peer review hearing at another facility a short time later. The hearing officer in that case also terminated the proceedings, this time due to the physician's failure to turn over certain evidence for use in the hearing. The physician challenged the termination through the court system arguing, contrary to the Tenet appellate court ruling, that California's peer review statutes never intended the hearing officer in peer review hearings to have such powers of termination. The California Supreme Court reviewed the case and agreed in April 2009. The High Court ruled, among other things, that peer review hearing officers must defer the question of termination to the panel of physicians who sit in judgment of each peer review hearing.Mileikowsky v. West Hills Hosp. and Medical Center (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1259, 203 P.3d 1113, 91 Cal.Rptr.3d 516. Roland Chalifoux Roland Chalifoux, member of an advocacy organisation called the Semmelweis Society, had his medical license revoked in Texas in 2004 after numerous incidents including the death of a patient. The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners stated that Chalifoux's practices \\"constitute such a deviation from the standard of care that revocation of his license is the only sanction that will adequately protect the public\\".Horvit M and Jarviss J, \\"Board revokes doctor's license,\\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram (TX), 12 June 2004, p.1B Chalifoux subsequently secured permission to practice in West Virginia,Mitchell M, \\"Former Texas neurosurgeon granted licenses in West Virginia,\\" Fort Worth Star-Telegram (TX), 7 July 2005 and alleges that the Texas board's actions constitute sham peer review. Charles Williams, MD Six years after Charles Williams, MD, an anesthesiologist was summarily suspended by University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, a federal jury in Las Vegas awarded Dr. Williams $8.8 million as compensation for the due process violations he experienced in his sham peer review.Thevenot, C., \\"Jury awards $8.8 million to anesthesiologist,\\" Las Vegas Review-Journal (NV), 26 May 2011, http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime- courts/jury-awards-88-million-anesthesiologist Before the trial, which began May 16, U.S. District Judge Philip Pro made a finding that Ellerton and UMC's medical staff had violated Williams' due process rights. That left only the question of damages for the jury. This case appears to be the highest jury verdict in the nation for sham peer review which has not been overturned. Richard Chudacoff, MD On May 28, 2008, without any notice or opportunity to be heard, the Medical Staff of UMC suspended Dr. Chudacoff‚Äôs clinical privileges. As a result of this, UMC filed a report against Dr. Chudacoff with the National Practitioner Data Bank claiming that Dr. Chudacoff was a risk to patient safety and had inadequate skills. This led to the virtual destruction of Dr. Chudacoff‚Äôs career. Dr. Chudacoff sued. U.S. District Court Judge Edward Reed opined that, in Nevada, a physician's hospital privileges are a constitutionally protected property right.Chudacoff v. Univ. Med. Ctr. of S. Nev., 609 F.Supp. 2d 1163, 1172-73 (D. Nev. 2009) The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then affirmed that Dr. Chudacoff's due process rights were violated by UMC. As well, the Medical Executive members lost their immunity under the HCQIA for failure to follow their bylaws. The case was settled out of court in favor of Dr. Chudacoff, under the cloak of confidentiality. Chudacoff v. Univ. Med. Ctr. of S. Nev., 649 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 2011) Development of the Patient Safety Organization (PSO) The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-41) allows for the creation of Patient Safety Organizations, quality of care committees that can act in parallel with peer review boards. PSOs were authorized to gather information to be analyzed by hospital administrators, nurses, and physicians as a tool for systems failure analysis. They may be used by any healthcare entity except insurance companies, but must be registered with the AHRQ wing of the US Department of Health and Human Services. In PSOs, root cause analysis and \\"near misses\\" are evaluated in an attempt to avert major errors. Participants in PSOs are immune from prosecution in civil, criminal, and administrative hearings.

The group had one hit single early in 1968: the song \\"Everything I Am\\". Most of the members went on to greater fame with other bands or in session work. Career Most of their material was psychedelic pop, with leanings towards a prog rock sound on some of the band's album tracks. The majority of the material was written by three of the band members: Brian Keith, Paul Raymond, and Tony Murray. Keith later left the band, leaving it a quartet, and Raymond took over lead vocals. Plastic Penny's output was released on the Page One Records. The band appeared at the first Isle of Wight Festival, held on 31 August 1968. \\"Everything I Am\\" reached a high of number six in the UK Singles Chart. The song, enhanced with a string arrangement, was a slow ballad version of a song originally recorded by the Box Tops. It was written by Spooner Oldham and Dan Penn. Their follow-up singles, such as the Bill Martin/Phil Coulter penned song \\"Nobody Knows It\\", were flops. Mick Grabham (then billed as Mick Graham) moved on to play with Cochise and then Procol Harum. Keith later became the lead vocalist with The Congregation, who share the \\"one-hit wonder\\" tag with Plastic Penny. Raymond replaced Christine Perfect in Chicken Shack, then joined Savoy Brown and later played several spells with the rock band UFO. Nigel Olsson became an in-demand session musician, most notably drumming on much of Elton John's early work and back with him from 2001. He also worked with the Spencer Davis Group, Uriah Heep, Kiki Dee, Neil Sedaka, Rod Stewart and Leo Sayer. Tony Murray played on Elton John‚Äôs Empty Sky with Olsson, and then joined The Troggs. The group's third and final album Heads I Win, Tails You Lose was a compilation of the band's more obscure recordings, issued in 1970 after the group had disbanded.

The supervisory headquarters was established at DeFuniak Springs and moved to Pensacola in September 1910. It remained there until 1936 when it was relocated to Tallahassee. The Choctawhatchee's two districts (Easy Bay-Camp Pinchot and Niceville) were separated by what is now State Road 85. National defense needs prompted Congress to transfer the national forest to the War Department just prior to World War II. On June 27, 1940, Congress transferred the 340,890 acres (1380 km¬≤) of the Choctawhatchee from the Forest Service to the War Department (and subsequently to its successor's constituent United States Department of the Air Force) for military purposes. The law provided that the land might be restored to national forest status by proclamation or order of the President when it was no longer needed for military purposes. It has been home to Eglin Air Force Base since. In descending order of amount of land area the forest is located in parts of southern Okaloosa, Walton, and Santa Rosa counties. During the early years, Camp Pinchot was the Forest Supervisor's summer headquarters. At that time, the only mode of transportation from Pensacola (site of the main supervisory headquarters) was by boat. In 2000, Camp Pinchot celebrated its 50th anniversary as the residence for the Eglin Air Force Base Commander. The current portion of the Choctawhatchee, that is still managed by the Forest Service, consists of several dispersed parcels that total only 1,110 acres (1.73 sq mi, or 4.492 km¬≤) Table 6 - NFS Acreage by State, Congressional District and County - United States Forest Service - September 30, 2007 and are managed by the Apalachicola National Forest. Some parcels lost many of their national forest characteristics by changing land- use over the years and others are difficult to manage because they are not contiguous. They may therefore be traded or sold to allow the Forest Service to acquire privately held land within the boundaries of other national forests in the state.

Lintott was capped seven times by the England national team after becoming a professional player, and he also made five appearances for the amateur side. He was killed in action on the first day on the Somme, the opening day of the Battle of Albert. Life and career Born in Godalming, and educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, Lintott was Queens Park Rangers' first ever England international in 1908. His first major club was Woking where he helped the club to win the East and West Surrey League and Surrey Charity Shield. He moved to Devon to study teaching at St Luke's College in Exeter, and signed with Southern League club Plymouth Argyle in 1906. He made two appearances for Argyle during the 1906‚Äì07 season and then settled in London, where he taught at Oldfield Road School in Willesden. He joined Queens Park Rangers in 1907, making his professional debut in the replay of the 1908 FA Charity Shield match. He played 31 Southern League games before moving to Football League side Bradford City in 1908. He finished his career at Leeds City. Lintott was a schoolmaster throughout his career. In 1908 his weight was 12 stone and height 5 ft 10 inches. When World War I was declared in 1914, Lintott was one of the first players to sign up for army service and joined the West Yorkshire Regiment's 15th Battalion, known as the Leeds Pals.

The US Navy's Advanced Enclosed Mast/Sensor (AEM/S) system fully integrates advanced materials, structures, and manufacturing technologies with sensor technology, electromagnetics, and signature reduction. Ship masts, with the complex antenna geometries mounted on them, as well as the latticework of the mast structure, contribute significantly to a ship's radar cross section. The AEM/S consists of a faceted radome that provides a cleaner exterior profile, with internal platforms on which antennas and sensors are mounted. The radome material is designed so that the antennas can transmit and receive through the material. The base of the mast is constructed from fiber reinforced composite skins encasing end-grain balsa core. The upper (radome) section consists of structural foam and fiberglass. In May 1997, USS Arthur W. Radford received the first-ever shipboard installation of the AEM/S System, to serve as a proof-of-concept or advanced technology demonstrator. Sailors reported an unanticipated benefit of being able to work aloft in bad weather, increasing the efficiency of scheduled shipboard maintenance. Using lessons learned from the Radford, the Navy designed the AEM/S into a new class of ships, the first being the USS San Antonio (LPD-17) amphibious transport dock.

The lake feeds mainly from rains and spring water. Lake Ishigli-Gara- Gel is situated at a height of 2, 658 m above sea level in the southern part of the Karabakh volcanic plateau near the foothills of several mountains with a height of 3, 200-3, 500 m. the lake is a relict water reservoir, which was formed in the crater of an extinct volcano. The length of the lake is 1,950 m, its maximum width is 1, 250 m, length of its coastline is 5, 500 m, maximum depth ‚Äì 7.8 m, volume of water ‚Äì 10 million m3, area of the lake 13 km2. Water flow is mainly due to melted snow and rainwater, partially spring water. In terms of botany and geography the Karabakh Plateau is situated between the Caucasian and Armenian-Iran provinces, which determines the specifics of the local flora. The flora of the reserve includes 102 species and subspecies of vascular plants from 68 general and 27 families. The lack of flora is explained by the fact that the reserve covers only the lake, and many rare and endemic species grow beyond the reserve area, but close to its borders. The vegetation of the coastal area of the lake is represented mainly by meadows with the dominance of Trifolium and Tragacantha and Astragalus. The swamp flora and vegetation are limited because of the height of the area. There are only two species of plants in the lake: Polygonum amphibium and Ranunclus. In 1967, a type of Sevan trout, included in the Red Book, was introduced into the lake. The reserve is an inter-republic reserve. The reserve is under occupation. Adjacent to the borders of the reserve there are areas with rare and endangered species of plants such as Euphrasia, Potentilla and others.

Harper is best remembered for playing in the Championship winning Everton side of the mid-1980s. Harper was a utility player whose first-choice position was right-back but he could perform competently in almost any position on the park and he frequently turned up in central defence, at left-back, centre midfield, wide midfield and sometimes even as a makeshift striker. Perhaps partially as a result of his great versatility however, he often found himself used as a squad player rather than as a first- team regular at many of the clubs he played for. He is remembered as a largely unspectacular but solid and reliable performer who very rarely made a mistake. Harper scored few goals but many of those he did score were spectacular efforts, often from long range. Everton fans nicknamed him 'Bertie Bassett' because he played in 'allsorts of positions'. Career Harper started out at Liverpool in the late 1970s, the club he had supported as a boy, but he never made a first team appearance for Liverpool before Howard Kendall took him across Stanley Park to Everton in the summer of 1983 for ¬£100,000. Harper initially became first choice right-back but after a few months he lost his place to Gary Stevens, who went on to become an England international. From then on, Harper never really held down a regular first team place at Goodison but like Kevin Richardson, he became a vital squad player, filling in for various positions on the park when first-teamers were injured and frequently appearing as a substitute. During his first season, Harper scored a spectacular goal against his previous club Liverpool in the Merseyside derby at Goodison. Everton went on that season to finish runners-up to Liverpool in the League Cup before winning the FA Cup at Wembley in May, beating Graham Taylor's Watford 2‚Äì0. Harper was an unused substitute at Wembley and he received a cup winners medal as a result. The following season, 1984/85, Everton won the League Championship and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup as well as finishing runners-up in the FA Cup to Manchester United. This was the most successful season in Everton's history and Harper played an important role as a squad player - he received both a Championship winners medal and Cup Winners' Cup medal (again he was an unused substitute in the final). Everton were not allowed to contest the following season's UEFA Champions League due to the ban on English clubs entering European competition after the Heysel Stadium disaster involving Liverpool F.C. The following year Everton were runners-up to rivals Liverpool in both the League Championship and the FA Cup - Harper came on as a substitute in the FA Cup semi-final against Sheffield Wednesday and scored Everton's opening goal with an audacious lob from outside the area. Then in 1986/87, Everton reclaimed the league title and Harper received his second Championship medal after playing in the majority of Everton's games due to an injury crisis in the first half of the season. Harper scored a vital and spectacular winner at Chelsea during the title run- in. Howard Kendall then left Everton to join Athletic Bilbao and a year later in 1988 Harper left Everton for Sheffield Wednesday in search of regular first-team football. Wednesday paid ¬£275,000 for Harper's services but after a fairly unremarkable spell at Hillsborough, he rejoined Howard Kendall at his new club Manchester City in December 1989 for a fee of ¬£150,000 and he became City's regular right-back. Kendall returned to Everton the following autumn and in the summer of 1991 he took Harper back to Goodison for ¬£200,000. After two more seasons with the Toffees, Harper left top-flight football to play for Luton Town in 1993 and a year later he joined Burnley. After two seasons at Turf Moor, Harper retired from professional football. After retirement, Harper went back to Everton once more in the early 2000s as a youth coach, spending several years there before leaving in 2005. In November 2007 he was employed as a scout by Premier League side Bolton Wanderers who were looking for a number of former professionals to head their recruitment drive led by former Everton manager Colin Harvey. In October 2010 he left Bolton to join first club Liverpool and was given a senior role under then Reds manager Roy Hodgson.

The procedure and requirements for the certificate vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and on the type of structure. In the United States, obtaining a certificate is generally required whenever: * a new building is constructed * a building built for one use is to be used for another (e.g., an industrial building converted for residential use) * occupancy of a commercial or industrial building changes, or ownership of a commercial, industrial, or multiple-family residential building changes The purpose of obtaining a certificate of occupancy is to prove that, according to the law, the house or building is in liveable condition. Generally, such a certificate is necessary to be able to occupy the structure for everyday use, as well as to be able to sign a contract to sell the space and close on a mortgage for the space. A certificate of occupancy is evidence that the building complies substantially with the plans and specifications that have been submitted to, and approved by, the local authority. It complements a building permit‚Äîa document that must be filed by the applicant with the local authority before construction to indicate that the proposed construction will adhere to ordinances, codes, and laws. Temporary certificate of occupancy (TCO) A temporary certificate of occupancy grants residents and building owners all of the same rights as a certificate of occupancy, however it is only for a temporary period of time. In New York City, TCOs are usually active for 90 days from the date of issue, after which they expire. It is perfectly legal, and not uncommon in the given situation, for a building owner to re-apply for a TCO, following all the steps and inspections required originally, in order to hypothetically extend their TCO for another period of time. Temporary certificates of occupancy are generally sought after and acquired when a building is still under minor construction, but there is a certain section or number of floors that are deemed to be habitable, and, upon issuance of TCO, can legally be occupied or sold. New York City In New York City, for a building to obtain a certificate of occupancy (CO), the structure must pass a series of inspections, as well as a walk-through from the Department of Buildings. In most cases, the inspections include, but are not limited to, plumbing inspections, fire sprinkler system inspections, fire alarm system inspections, electrical inspections, fire pump pressure tests, architectural inspections (where inspector checks if building was built in accordance with an architect's stamped and approved drawings), elevator inspections, completion of lobby, and an inspection to see if the building complies with the proper number of entrances required for its size. After all inspections are passed, the last step is generally to have a walk-through by a member of the Department of Buildings, who sees that there is no major construction remaining on the job site, that there are no obstructions to the entrances, that there are no safety hazards in the building, and that everything in the building was built according to plan. If the inspector approves his walk- through, a certificate of occupancy is usually granted.

History The earliest Ashkenazi synagogue constructed in London, after the return of Jews to England in the 17th century, was built about 1690 at Duke's Place, north of Aldgate. In 1696‚Äì7, the synagogue also acquired a burial ground, at Alderney Road.Roth (1950) 11‚Äì18 The congregation grew, and in 1722 a new building was erected with the cost of ¬£2,000 () being borne by businessman and philanthropist Moses Hart. The building was consecrated on Rosh Hashana (September 18, 1722).Roth (1950), 50‚Äì51 An enlarged building, designed by George Dance the Elder, was consecrated on August 29, 1766. The order of prayers for the inauguration was the first printed publication of the synagogue, and also the first publication to name it explicitly as 'The Great Synagogue'.Roth (1950) 131 Between 1788 and 1790, the third synagogue was built on the site. Unusually for the time, the principal donor was a woman, Judith Hart Levy, a daughter of Moses Hart, who subscribed ¬£4,000 ().Roth (1950) 163-6 The architect was James Spiller. The building was in the classical style identified with John Adam. It was redecorated and repaired in 1832 and 1852 by John Walen, and restored again with small renovations in 1899 and 1930.Krinsky (1996)pp. 415ff.; Kadish (1996), Chapter 4, by Clarence Epstein, The Architecture of the Great Synagogue, Duke's Place The Royal Dukes of Cambridge, Cumberland, and Sussex, sons of George III, visited the Great Synagogue of London in 1809. There they were seated on elegant Egyptian revival chairs as they watched the religious service.Wischnitzer, p. 169. The synagogue was also visited around this period, during his schooldays, by the writer Leigh Hunt, who wrote 'I took pleasure in witnessing the semi-Catholic pomp of their service and in hearing their fine singing, not without something of a constant astonishment at their wearing their hats'.cited in Roth (1950), 170 Reverend Hermann Mayerowitsch stands under the decorated arch of the Ark of the Great Synagogue, following the building's destruction The synagogue was destroyed during the night of May 10/11, 1941, during one of the last major attacks of the Blitz.

It is the documentary filmmaking home of acclaimed producers such as Gordon Quinn (A Good Man), Steve James (Hoop Dreams), Maria Finitzo (Mapping Stem Cell Research: Terra Incognita; In the Game), Joanna Rudnick (In the Family), Bing Liu (Minding the Gap), and Aaron Wickenden (Almost There). The organization was founded in 1966 by Gordon Quinn, Jerry Temaner and Stan Karter, three University of Chicago graduates who wanted to make documentary films guided by their principle of \\"Cinematic Social Inquiry\\". They were soon joined by Jerry Blumenthal, who remained an integral part of the organization until he died on November 13, 2014. Gordon Quinn remained Executive Director through late 2008 when he transitioned to Artistic Director, and Justine Nagan was named Executive Director. In 2015, Betsy Steinberg, former managing director of the Illinois Film Office, was named the new Executive Director until 2018. In 2019, Jolene Pinder was named Executive Director. In 2015, Gordon Quinn was announced as the International Documentary Association's Career Achievement Award recipient for his contributions to documentary filmmaking on over 50 films, and his services to the field through advocacy around fair use and public media. In 2016, Kartemquin's 50th anniversary was recognized with awards from Ashland International Film Festival; Chicago International Music and Movies Festival (CIMMfest); the Peace on Earth Film Festival; and the Chicago Latino Film Festival, and with retrospectives at Hot Docs; UCLA Film and Television Archives; the University of Chicago's Doc Films; and on Chicago's PBS Station WTTW, and with an art and equipment exhibition at the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events' Expo 72 gallery. History Kartemquin Educational Films was started in 1966 by three University of Chicago graduates, Gordon Quinn, Jerry Temaner, and Stan Karter. The company was started to make politically engaged and socially charged documentary films that would use Quinn and Temaner's thesis Cinematic Social Inquiry as a base point. Kartemquin's first film in 1966, Home for Life‚Äîa chronicle of two elderly people entering a home for the aged‚Äîestablished the direction the organization would take over the next four decades. After the initial success of the late 1960s films Kartemquin evolved into a film collective producing films such as The Chicago Maternity Center Story and the Taylor Chain films. However, after these and a some other films were released the collective disbanded in the late 1970s due to differing opinions on the direction the company should head. After the dissolution of the collective, co-founders Gordon Quinn and Jerry Blumenthal (who died in late 2014) pushed the organization to its current model, producing high quality works that still had a political edge and mentoring a new generation of young documentary makers. They continued releasing social-issue documentaries (The Last Pullman Car, Golub) largely for public television and the educational market into the 1990s. Kartemquin's best known film, the Oscar-nominated Hoop Dreams,1995|Oscars.org won several major critics prizes and journalism awards in 1995 and was named on over 150 \\"ten best\\" lists. Filmmakers Steve James, Peter Gilbert and Frederick Marx examined the complex role basketball plays in the lives of two inner-city high school players. After receiving the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival, Hoop Dreams was released theatrically by Fine Line Features and became the highest grossing documentary at that time and one of highest-rated documentaries broadcast on PBS. Since Hoop Dreams, Kartemquin has continued producing films that examine and critique society by following the stories of real people. At the Death House Door premiered at SXSW, and went on to win awards at Full Frame and other festivals. Their documentary, Terra Incognita: Mapping Stem Cell Research\\", follows Dr. Jack Kessler of Northwestern University in his search for a cure for spinal cord injuries using embryonic stem cells. Other notable documentaries have included: The New Americans, a seven-hour miniseries for PBS that follows immigrant families from five different countries; Stevie; Refrigerator Mothers; 5 Girls; and Vietnam, Long Time Coming. In 2007, Kartemquin Films received the MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions. In 2009, Kartemquin's Executive Director Justine Nagan directed the film Typeface. The 2010s saw Kartemquin producing films at the fastest rate yet. With several award-winning documentaries being released in these years, including The Homestretch, Life Itself, The Trials of Muhammad Ali, and In the Game. In 2016, Kartemquin celebrated its 50-year anniversary. The event was widely recognized throughout Chicago and the world with Kartemquin receiving awards from Ashland International Film Festival; Chicago International Music and Movies Festival (CIMMfest); the Peace on Earth Film Festival; and the Chicago Latino Film Festival. In 2018, Kartemquin received two Academy Award nominations, for Edith+Eddie & Abacus: Small Enough to Jail.2018|Oscars.org In 2019, Kartemquin's Minding the Gap was nominated for the Academy Award,2019|Oscars.org and also won a Peabody Award.

He stood . Pedigree Bolero was by the English Thoroughbred stallion Black Sky, who was imported to Germany in 1972. Black Sky was a grandson of the great stallion Djebel, who also sired the very influential My Babu, a stallion seen in many show jumpers osdand hunters pedigrees in the United States. Black Sky stood at the private stud farm of Schmidt-Ankum, and his offspring were generally talented dressage horses with good rideability, but with very little jumping talent. Bolero's dam, Baroness, was registered with the Hanoverian Verband. She was half-Thoroughbred through her sire, the large-framed stallion Bleep. Her dam's side includes Hyperion, who in turn traces to Bay Ronald. The dam-sire of Baroness was the stallion Athos, who was known as a broodmare sire of dressage horses, and her damline (Athos-Fliegerstern) also produced the stallions Grenadier, Hitchcock, and Winner. This breeding combination of a Thoroughbred stallion to a mare that was by a Thoroughbred was prohibited by the Hanoverian studbook at the time, due to the belief that the offspring would be unsuccessful. Pedigree for Bolero 1975 Chestnut colt Breeding career Bolero did only moderately well at his 100-day stallion test held at Adelheidsdorf, placing 6th out of 30 stallions with a final score of 111. He stood at Landesbr√ºck from 1979 until his death of a heart attack at the age of 12. He only stood for 9 seasons, making his impact on the breeding of Hanoverians even more spectacular. Influence Despite the relatively short breeding career, Bolero was remarkably influential on the breeding of dressage horses, although like his father, his offspring are generally poor jumpers. His high degree of Thoroughbred blood brought an elegance to his progeny, and this trend toward a lighter dressage horse has been on the rise since he stood at stud. He consistently produced offspring with good shoulders and toplines, as well as elastic and rhythmic gaits. Bolero was the founding sire of a new B-Line in the 1990s, and produced the stallion Brentano II, who also became a foundation stallion for this line. Bolero was found to be most successful with daughters of Grande and Duellant. Breeders continue to cross the B-Line with the G- and D- lines to produce successful dressage horses, as well as those by Argus. The stallion sired 47 licensed stallions during his time at stud, the most important being Brentano I and II, Buenos Aires, Bismark, and Beltain. As a well-known sire of sires, Bolero sons have been exported around the world. Bolero has also made a name for himself as a sire of broodmares, producing 317 mares that went on to be registered, 96 of whom earned the status of State Premium. The great success of his mares gave him a dressage ranking of 139 (against a rather poor 57 for jumping). Sons and Daughters Bolero began with 5 sons attending the Verden licensing, of which 4 were selected. His offspring, known as the \\"Bolero Boom,\\" continue to make their mark on the dressage scene. As of 2000, there were 412 Bolero offspring competing, with winnings of DM1,282,504. Three of his descendants medaled at the 2004 Olympics in Athens: Brentina, Bonaparte, and Beauvalais. * Buenos Aires: champion of his year * Brentano II: the most successful son of Bolero, competed up to Grand Prix in dressage.

Daly III (born May 1, 1964) is an American attorney and the current deputy commissioner and chief legal officer of the National Hockey League (NHL) under Commissioner Gary Bettman. He is also a Hockey Hall of Fame board member and former NHL vice president and chief legal officer. Before joining the NHL front office he worked for the New York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, LLP. He received his bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College and his J.D. degree from New York University School of Law.  Education and family  Daly grew up in Kinnelon, N.J. with his parents and older sister, Denise. He majored in government, with an additional concentration in history, at Dartmouth College, where he also played varsity football. He graduated from Dartmouth in 1986 and went on to obtain his J.D. degree from NYU School of Law (1990). Bill lives in Bethesda, Maryland, with his wife and has 3 children.  Career   Major milestones  In 1996, Bill Daly was hired by the National Hockey League (NHL) as senior vice president of legal affairs. Prior to joining the NHL, Daly was an attorney with the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom for six years. In 2000, Daly began assuming responsibility for all of the NHL's international transactions with the league's new focus on international affairs. Shortly after, in 2001, Daly established an agreement between the NHL and International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) that stated a number of guidelines for international player relations including the age at which teams can sign European prospects, how long they can keep players, and compensation for European clubs for the loss of their star players. Daly was the NHL's main negotiator during collective bargaining with NHL players in the 2004-05 NHL lock out, that ended in July 2005 when the NHLPA approved the new collective- bargaining agreement (CBA) with a 464-68 vote. The same year, Daly helped negotiate the two-year, $135 million deal with Comcast for the league's cable broadcasting rights. In 2005, Daly was named the first NHL deputy commissioner. In 2014, he received the Lester Patrick Award along with Paul Holmgren. As deputy commissioner, Daly currently holds the duty of presenting the Prince of Wales Trophy and the Clarence Campbell Bowl to the conference playoff champions at the end of each conference finals series. He also holds the duty of presenting the Presidents' Trophy to the team with the NHL's best regular season record, as well as hosting the NHL draft lottery. Daly spoke at the World Hockey Summit in 2010, and stated a desire to increase the number of NHL games in Europe and to market its brands and most popular teams to Europeans. Daly played a key role in two of the most impactful commercial contracts with TV rightsholders in NHL history. In 2011, he led negotiations on the 10-year U.S. national rights agreement with NBC Sports Group, delivering NHL regular season games regularly to U.S. fans through over-the- air, NBC Sports Network, and NBC's newly created sports cable channel. The deal also provided coverage of almost every Stanley Cup Final game for the first time. In 2013, he again was the lead negotiator in the 12-year Canadian national broadcast and new media deal with Rogers Communications (Rogers Sportsnet). In 2017, Daly reinvigorated the NHL's international strategy that brought NHL teams to China for the first-ever preseason games in Beijing and Shanghai. It also reintroduced games in Europe, bringing regular season games to Sweden for the first time since 2011.  Responsibilities  Daly oversees the NHL's relationship - including negotiating and administering necessary working agreements - with the NHL Alumni Association, American Hockey League, Canadian Hockey League, Hockey Canada and USA Hockey. He is the President of the NHL Foundation, the organization that administers charitable dollars and initiatives for the NHL and its teams. He is a board member for the NHL Players' Emergency Assistance Fund. He is on the Board of Directors, as an NHL representative, for the Hockey Hall of Fame and USA Hockey. He oversees the NHL‚Äôs participation in all international hockey competitions, including the Olympics, the World Cup of Hockey, the IIHF World Hockey Championships, NHL Global Series and NHL China Games. Outside of his responsibilities with the NHL, Daly has served as a board member for the Sports Lawyers Association. He has served on boards the Sports Development Corporation of the City of New York, and the Sports Law and Antitrust Law Committees of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York.  Honors  In 2013, Bill Daly was selected as one of Legal 500's Corporate Counsel 100. In 2014, he was awarded Legal 500's Individual of the Year: Sport. In 2014, Daly received the Lester Patrick Trophy, given to people who advance the sport of hockey in America.

His letters and reports are important sources for the ethnography and early history of the peninsula.  Biography  Piccolo was born in Palermo, Sicily on 25 March 1654, then part of the Kingdom of Spain. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1673. He completed his period of formation and was ordained. He then volunteered for the missions of New SpainBaja California \\"Francisco Mar√≠a Piccolo Piccolo arrived in the Americas in 1684, when he went on to serve as a Jesuit missionary for 13 years among the Tarahumara of Chihuahua before being assigned to the new Baja California mission field. During this period, in 1689, he made his final religious profession as a member of the Society.Baja California Eusebio Francisco Kino, S.J., the original driving force behind the Jesuit effort who had made two unsuccessful attempts at establishing a mission, was unable to participate when his project finally became a reality. As a consequence, Juan Maria Salvatierra, S.J., was the lone missionary in establishing Mission Loreto among its Monqui inhabitants in 1697. Piccolo crossed the Gulf of California to be Salvatierra's assistant about a month later. Piccolo founded the second Baja California mission, San Francisco Javier, among the Cochim√≠, in 1699 and served there until 1701, when he abandoned the mission, due to threats from the indigenous population. He then returned to Mexico City where he worked for the interests of the Baja California Jesuit missions. He was assigned to serve as visitador (Visitator) for the Jesuit missions in Sonora from 1705‚Äì1709, after which he returned to Baja California and served at Mission Santa Rosalia until 1718.Baja California He was then transferred to Mission Loreto, where he remained until his death there on 22 February 1729.Baja California His Informe or Report of 1702, published in Mexico City, was an influential early account of the peninsular missions, although its optimism about the potential of Baja California was something of an embarrassment to later Jesuit apologists. He conducted several exploratory trips seeking neophytes and future mission sites, including journeys to what would later be Muleg√©, Mission La Pur√≠sima and Mission San Ignacio. His accounts of these travels contain additional ethnographic information on the Cochim√≠. References Sources *Burrus, Ernest J. 1984. Jesuit Relations: Baja California, 1716‚Äì1762.

She received the Newbery Honor.  Family and childhood  Elizabeth Marie Pope was born on May 1, 1917 in Washington, D.C., to Christopher Herman Pope, a banker, and Florence Anna Thompson Pope. She had two younger siblings, Wilmot T. Pope and Mary Frances Pope.  Education and college teaching  Elizabeth Pope received her B.A. from Bryn Mawr College in 1940. She completed graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University, where in 1944 she was awarded a Ph.D. That fall she accepted a teaching position at Mills College in Oakland, CA. She served as assistant professor until 1955, when she was promoted to associate professor. In 1962 she became professor of English and was soon Head of the Department of English. She taught English at Mills for thirty-eight years before retiring on June 30, 1982.  Classroom teaching  Elaine B. Johnson, in her book Contextual Teaching and Learning, fondly describes her memories of studying Shakespeare and Milton with Dr. Pope (pages 50‚Äì51). Johnson recalls a teacher who was courteous, humorous, compassionate, lively, and excellent at drawing connections between her students' lives and the moral lessons of Shakespeare and Milton. Johnson also includes the comment that Dr. Pope was \\"weighed down by a heavy brace on one leg\\" and was white-haired, indicating that she took courses from Dr. Pope toward the end of her tenure as professor. For Johnson, Dr. Pope was not only an engaging lecturer, but facilitated class discussion with open-ended questions and interest in her students' comments.  Interest in mythology  For many years Elizabeth Pope taught a course on Basic Myths. In response to an invitation to speak at the annual Mills College Alumnae Association meeting in 1958, Elizabeth Pope elaborated the topic of \\"Mythology and the Modern Mind.\\" > The fact is that on the mythological level modern man has actually achieved > what he is only beginning to dream of on the political level ‚Äì ‚Äì a real > coming together of races and nations. Perhaps we should not make too much of > this phenomenon ‚Äì ‚Äì but there is no need to underestimate it either. In the > past hundred years, the resources of our imaginative life have been > enormously broadened, deepened, strengthened, and enriched; it is a great > achievement, and one of which the modern mind may legitimately be proud. Pope proceeded to discuss four distinct approaches to origins of mythology. The first is the \\"historical-archaeological\\" approach, that myth \\"is a distorted and fantastic version of something that actually happened.\\" The second approach is \\"psychological\\", presenting \\"in symbolic form the unconscious desires and loathings which lie buried deepest in the most hidden recesses of the psyche.\\" Third is the \\"anthropological theory,\\" emphasizing \\"phases of the agricultural year and the important stages of human development (birth, coming-of-age, marriage, death) \\"marked by elaborate ceremonials and rites by means of which the whole community participates in the occasion,\\" and where a ceremony may linger on \\"even when the participants no longer understand exactly what it means.\\" Fourth is \\"analytic study\\", viewed as more scientific. These scholars \\"break the story down into its component parts and classify them according to type -- or... 'motif.'\\" Pope concluded with a probing question: \\"we have always known that the modern mind is capable of scientific study: is it also capable of the sort of creative imagination that produced myths in the first place?\\"  Other activities  She held memberships in the American Association of University Professors, the Renaissance Society, the Mediaeval Society of America, and the Society for Creative Anachronism.  Books  Her Newbery Honor-winning novel for young adults, The Perilous Gard, is an imaginative retelling of the ballad of Tam Lin set in the latter days of Queen Mary I of England and the early days of Queen Elizabeth I, featuring a strong, independent, clever young heroine, Kate. It also sympathetically discusses remnants of ancient pagan Britain driven into hiding by the coming of Christianity. Many of its themes will be familiar from the Arthurian legends, which are referred to at the opening of the novel.

Although a mill had existed on the site since the late eighteenth century, the final structure was built in 1870. The Curtis brothers bought the plant in 1848. Although the plant is usually referred to in Newark as the Curtis Paper Mill, the actual name is Nonantum Mill, referring to an Indian name for the area of Newton, Massachusetts, the Curtises' hometown. The plant had the distinction of manufacturing the paper on which several of the peace treaties ending World War II were signed. The James River Corporation eventually purchased the plant and subsequently sold it to Crown Vantage Corp. who closed it in 1997 as they consolidated their operations. It sat empty for several years and was eventually fenced off to prevent trespassing. The main entrance to the plant and much of the front office were removed in 2002. In October 2007 demolition work began on the rest of the factory and was completed by December. The red brick smokestack bearing the 'Curtis' name was the only remaining structure from the mill until March 1, 2013 when it was demolished and removed. All of the original site buildings are now gone. Today, the mill and adjacent land south to the creek are designated as a municipal park. The millrace path includes state park land and passes through the City of Newark's Coverdale Park. Small numbers of people hike along the millrace path or fish in the settling ponds. Despite the closure of the facility, elements of the plant are still in use. The plant's settling ponds- originally used for cleaning waste water before returning it to White Clay Creek-were turned over to the City of Newark, which put them to use as part of a water treatment plant built nearby. Similarly, the plant's millrace (a long, thin canal that draws water from White Clay Creek) is now used to bring water to the treatment plant.

History Native Americans long used the fertile areas near the Red River for farming and hunting. Taovoyas took over an abandoned French garrison hereE. R. Bills Texas Obscurities: Stories of the Peculiar, Exceptional and Nefarious. Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2013. around 1750 to defend against Spanish incursions in the area. In 1759, in the Battle of the Twin Villages, a Spanish army under Col. Diego Ortiz Parrilla attacked the Taovoyas' fortified position, but were defeated by a force of both the Taovoyas and Comanche tribes. Anglo settlers later misnamed the area Spanish Fort after assuming that the Spanish forces had built a fortification there, rather than the French. By 1859, Anglos began settling the area as the population of Native Americans dwindled. White settlement was encouraged across the newly formed Republic of Texas, and though Texas became a state in 1845, European settlers kept coming to Texas for farm land. By the early 1870s, a town called Burlington had been established near present-day Spanish Fort. The town was strategically located along the Chisholm Trail, and it became a popular cowboy town on the cattle drives from south and central Texas to Kansas. Nearby Red River Station, Texas, was the last stop before entering Indian Territory and virtually all cattle driven along the Chisolm Trail crossed at Red River Station. The town grew and citizens applied for a post office in 1876, but were rejected based on another Texas town of the same name. Two local men suggested the misnomer \\"Spanish Fort\\" after the ruins nearby. The new name was accepted, and the Spanish Fort post office opened in 1877. At its peak, the town had numerous businesses and churches, a Masonic lodge, five physicians, four hotels, and several saloons. Spanish Fort became known as a very rough and tumble cowboy town, and at least 40 murders are said to have occurred during the cattle drive heyday. Herman Joseph Justin founded the boot company which later grew into Justin Industries. Justin took orders from the drivers going north and had their custom-made boots ready in time for them to pick up on their way back through. But Spanish Fort would suffer, as many small Texas towns did, by being bypassed by the railroad. When fencing and railroads put an end to the cattle drives, small towns not directly served by railways faltered. The 20th century saw Spanish Fort almost completely vanish. The post office, school, and newspapers all had closed by 1970. Even the oil boom in Nocona's North Field could not save Spanish Fort, and the town has maintained a population of around 50 ever since. Education Spanish Fort is serviced by the Prairie Valley Independent School District. Historical record Spanish Fort received historic markers in 1936 and 1976 recognizing the Taovayo tribe culture and the 1759 confrontation with a Spanish expedition.http://www.9key.com/markers/marker_detail.asp?atlas_number=5337004922 The Spanish Fort site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

The story of Peggy Grahame, and how she is forced to relocate to her uncle's estate when she is orphaned. Along the way she meets the ghosts of many characters from the Revolutionary Period. Plot summary When seventeen- year-old Peggy Grahame's father dies, she has no choice but to reside in the home of her only remaining relative, her uncle Enos. She journeys to her family's ancestral estate, \\"Rest-and-be-thankful,\\" in Orange County, New York, and soon finds her uncle to be an eccentric and rather crochety man who is obsessed with his family's history. While Peggy strikes up a tentative friendship with a young British man called Pat, who is doing some research in America, her uncle is quick to forbid the two from seeing each other. Peggy is forced to spend much of her time alone in the large, Colonial house, and soon discovers it to be haunted by the ghosts of her eighteenth-century ancestors and their contemporaries. The ghosts relate their stories in first-person narratives throughout the book which are interwoven with the narrative of the present day. With the help of the ghosts' stories, Peggy is able to unravel a centuries-old family mystery, win the affection of her uncle and find a romance of her own. Characters in the present day *Peggy Grahame: An independent young woman who, when orphaned, is sent to live with her uncle Enos in an old, colonial house, and she views this change apprehensively. She soon meets with a young man named Pat, and they develop a promising acquaintance. Her uncle, however, forbids her to see him, and Peggy is left wondering why. Her uncle most often ignores her, treating her like a child when she does interfere, and she begins to be very lonely. Then the spirits of her Colonial ancestors visit her, filling some of her rather dull and uneventful days. She eagerly awaits their visits, as well as the secret communications she keeps up with Pat. She learns more of her history as she listens to her predeceasors and roams around the old house, unravelling the mysteries of the past. In many ways she is like her ancestor Barbara Grahame, who visits her most often. *Enos Grahame: A mean-tempered old man, obsessed with history and nothing else. He is selfish and thinks himself above everyone, and cannot stand failing in anything. Though he shows a fairer side, both by taking Peggy in and eventually offering to accept the relationship and connections with Pat. Though not a character to appear in a goodly amount of the book, he plays a pivotal role in the Colonial mystery, trying to keep all he knows to himself and furiously berating anyone who dares ask him anything about it. He is the brother of Peggy's father. *Pat Thorne: A charming young man who kindly offers Peggy a ride when she is lost. He is agreeable and laughs easily. He has a tendency to be rather lazy in manner, though it is said of him that he works harder than the rest of his family. He is very poor, and is in America to try to unravel the mystery of his own past, some of which he is ashamed of, keeping parts of it hidden. He plans to be a teacher back in England, and is partial to his dilapidated car which he has lovingly christened 'Betsy.' Characters in the past *Richard Grahame: Originally a pompous, ambitious man, Colonel Richard Grahame, or rather, 'Dick,' is sent back to his home town to hunt for the notorious marauder Peaceable Drummond Sherwood, who has been terrorizing the area with his band of guerrilla soldiers for some time. Dick is very proud to have been chosen for the job, but is very upset at learning that he and his troops will be staying at Shipley Farm‚Äîthe home of his childhood acquaintance, Eleanor Shipley, whom he still despises and considers an insufferable brat. Once there, however, Dick devotes every moment to attempting to capture Peaceable Sherwood, though to no avail. All his tricks fail, and Dick begins to think he is about to go mad with the strain of it. Finally, he finds a clue as to where he can find the criminal, and recklessly pushes on alone. He is sorely beaten, and Peaceable Sherwood escapes. Humbled and sore, Dick returns to Shipley Farm, where he is met by a worried Eleanor. They declare their feelings for each other, and the future looks more promising for a new, less proud and wiser, Dick. *Eleanor Shipley: Eleanor is a small woman, often described as moving and looking like a butterfly. She is witty and bright, and in her childhood would do anything to get Dick's attention. She has a very bad temper, though is more often very caring and generous. One day, when another man, Colonel Van Spurter, arrives to take Dick's post as the army thinks he has been taking too long, a letter arrives by way of one of the spies, stolen from one of Peaceable Sherwood's very own men. It is in code, and Eleanor and Dick try to hurry to look for the real message. There is a false note, and Colonel Van Spurter‚Äînot being the most clever‚Äîruns off in pursuit, while Eleanor and Dick continue to pore over the paper, finally revealing the true message. Dick gathers his troops and they almost manage to capture Peaceable Sherwood, but he escapes. Dick comes back bruised and battered, and Eleanor helps nurse him back to health, after her usual rather bossy manner. *Barbara Grahame: As Dick's little sister, she has grown up looking up to him, and loves him dearly. But when he and their father go into the army, she has no choice but to stay with her horrible Aunt Susanna, a tyrant of the meanest nature, ruling her house to the point of tangible misery in the very air. When Barbara asks to spend Christmas with Dick and Eleanor at Shipley Farm, Aunt Susanna absolutely refuses, and promptly pretends to fall ill to prevent Barbara's leaving. Luckily, however, on Christmas Day, Aunt Susanna runs out of her headache drops, and sends Barbara to fetch more from the apothecary. Barbara takes the opportunity to visit her brother, but gets caught in an awful snowstorm on the way. Nearly dead, she runs into a small band of men, who take her to shelter.

He was nicknamed \\"Gingerbread George\\" after his most famous design, the Dunedin Railway Station in the Flemish Renaissance style (he preferred his alternative design in the Scottish Baronial style). He was the first official architect of the New Zealand Railways. He designed many other stations, including Lower Hutt and Petone. Early life and education He was born in London, England. His family returned to Edinburgh, Scotland soon after he was born. His widowed mother sent him to Robert Gordon's College, Aberdeen, where he was entitled to free board and tuition as the son of an Aberdeen burgess. He trained as an architect and engineer under C.E. Calvert in Edinburgh, and in 1882 was employed as a draughtsman by architect J.J.A. Chesser. Career The George Troup designed Dunedin Railway Station He emigrated to New Zealand in 1884. Joining the Survey Department when he arrived in Dunedin, he worked in remote survey gangs. In 1886, he joined the New Zealand Railways Department as an engineering draughtsman, having studied at the Otago School of Mines to qualify for the position. He soon transferred to the Head Office in Wellington, where he spent 37 of his 39 years in the Railways, and was responsible for the design of railway stations, bridges and viaducts, and for Railways housing. His crowning achievement was the design and construction of Dunedin Railway Station, of 1906. He supported the Presbyterian Church including St. John's in Wellington and the Bible Class movement, the Y.M.C.A., the Wellington Boy's Institute, and the British and Foreign Bible Society. He was also President of the Friesian Cattle Breeders Association, as he farmed his country property at Plimmerton. He was associated with the development of Kelburn, and the Wellington Cable Car. Standard station designs Under his leadership, a plan book of revised standard station types was produced by 1904:-Rail Heritage Trust - Heritage Railway Stations * Class A Replaced the former class 5 station, 13 ft (3.5 m) wide x 34 ‚Äì 69 ft (10.4 ‚Äì 21 m) long, with an enclosed lobby, ladies' waiting room and toilet, plus, at larger stations, an office and luggage room.

Relocated to Parnell Railway Station in 2016‚Äì17. Political career Troup was the 23rd Mayor of Wellington, capital of New Zealand, from 1927 to 1931, after being a Councillor from 1925 (the year he retired from the Railways) to 1927; he was a member of the (anti-Labour) Civic League. He supported many civic improvements, like the widening and paving of many Wellington streets, and the developing of Rongotai Airport and the National Art Gallery and Museum on the Mount Cook site. He decided not to stand for a third term as Mayor in 1930 for health reasons, though with the Depression there was opposition to municipal spending. He was on many boards, e.g. the Wellington Harbour Board. In the 1931 New Year Honours, Troup was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, for public services. Troup stood unsuccessfully for the parliamentary seat of Wellington North as the Reform Party candidate in the 1931 election. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal, and in the 1937 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for public services. Personal life He married Annie Mary Sloan on 3 March 1897 in Wellington. He died in Wellington, survived by his wife, one son and three daughters.

There are overlapping jurisdictions of international organizations, nations, and states or provinces. Some government policies determine what is allowed versus prohibited, whereas others outline what research can be publicly financed. Of course, all practices not prohibited are implicitly permitted. Some organizations have issued recommended guidelines for how stem cell research is to be conducted. International bodies The United Nations adopted a declaration on human cloning that can be interpreted as calling on member states to prohibit somatic cell nuclear transfer, or therapeutic cloning. In 2005, in a divided vote, \\"Member States were called on to adopt all measures necessary to prohibit all forms of human cloning in as much as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life.\\" The World Health Organization has opposed a ban on cloning techniques in stem cell research. The Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine seems to ban the creation of embryos solely for research purposes.Chapter V, Article 18 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with Regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine: Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/164.htm It has been signed by 31 countries and ratified by 19:Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Beings Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Lithuania, Moldova, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Turkey. The Hinxton Group Researchers, ethicists and assorted spokespersons from 14 different countries have published a set of legal and ethical guidelines relating to stem cell research, in an effort to address conflicting international laws in this area. The ‚ÄòHinxton Group‚Äô met recently for the first time, in Cambridge, and published a consensus statement calling for a ‚Äòflexible‚Äô regulatory framework, which can simultaneously accommodate rapid scientific advance and at the same time accommodate the diversity of international approaches towards stem cell science. It also recommends that, in countries which oppose embryonic stem cell research, scientists should be free to pursue their research elsewhere. In light of the controversy surrounding Hwang Woo-Suk, the Hinxton Group has additionally recommended a number of measures intended to prevent fraud in stem cell research. The group has requested that all authors of embryonic stem cell papers submit a statement of authenticity of any new cell-lines and that the source of stem cells be clearly specified. On the ethical issues surrounding embryonic stem cell research, the group has additionally recommended that an international database be created, containing guidelines for ethical practice, research protocols, consent forms, and the information provided to donors. However, the potential for an international consensus on these matters seems remote given the complexity and diversity of regulatory frameworks in this controversial area of science, both within nations and between nations. ISSCR The International Society for Stem Cell Research is developing guidelines for the conduct of stem cell research. Nations Embryonic stem cell research has divided the international community. In the European Union, stem cell research using the human embryo is permitted in Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Greece, Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands; however it is illegal in Germany, Austria, Ireland, Italy, and Portugal. The issue has similarly divided the United States, with several states enforcing a complete ban and others giving financial support. ISSN:1549-3199. LCCN:2004212209. . Elsewhere, Japan, India, Iran, Israel, South Korea, and China are supportive, Australia is partially supportive (exempting reproductive cloning yet allowing research on embryonic stem cells that are derived from the process of IVF); however New Zealand, most of Africa (excepting South Africa) and most of South America (excepting Brazil) are restrictive.

Similarly, organisms that are coisogenic differ in one locus only and not in the surrounding chromosome. Unlike congenic organisms, coisogenic organisms cannot be bred and only occur through spontaneous or targeted mutation at the locus. Generating congenic strains Congenic strains are generated in the laboratory by mating two inbred strains (usually rats or mice), and back-crossing the descendants 5‚Äì10 generations with one of the original strains, known as the recipient strain. Typically selection for either phenotype or genotype is performed prior to each back-cross generation. In this manner either an interesting phenotype, or a defined chromosomal region assayed by genotype, is passed from the donor strain onto an otherwise uniform recipient background. Congenic mice or rats can then be compared to the pure recipient strain to determine whether they are phenotypically different if selection was for a genotypic region, or to identify the critical genetic locus, if selection was for a phenotype. Speed congenics can be produced in as little as five back-cross generations, through the selection at each generation of offspring that not only retain the desired chromosomal fragment, but also 'lose' the maximum amount of background genetic information from the donor strain. This is also known as marker-assisted congenics, due to the use of genetic markers, typically microsatellite markers, but now, more commonly, single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs). The process can be further aided by the superovulation of females, to produce many more eggs.

Denis Gage Deane-Tanner (born 14 September 1876 - ???) was the brother of William Desmond Taylor and nephew of Charles Kearns Deane Tanner. Early life Denis Gage Deane-Tanner was the fourth of five children born to Jane O'Brien (of Carlow, Ireland) and British Army Major Thomas Kearns Deane-Tanner (of Cork, Ireland) in what is now Carlow, Ireland. Denis was raised at the family home, Straw Hall, until he attended school at Pooles House, Clifton College in England. His father was a lifelong military man, who also started the Volunteer Fire Brigade in Carlow. Denis had two uncles via his father, both were Doctors. Uncle Lombard worked at both the Charity Hospital and St. Kevins hospital in Cork. Charles Kearns Deane Tanner, an Irish surgeon and politician was Denis' other uncle. Uncle Charles was deeply involved in Home Rule politics, eventually leaving medicine to concentrate solely on his interest in the Irish Home Rule cause. Tanner was a lieutenant in the King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) of the British Army during the Second Boer War, during which time he was awarded both the King's and Queen's medals for service in what is now South Africa. Life in the United States After leaving the military, he traveled to New York City to join his elder brother William Cunningham, arriving in 1903. Denis followed his brother Williams example and went into the antique business, working at The Antique Shop on Fifth Avenue and A.J. Crawfords also on Fifth. Denis met his future wife Ada in New York City. Ada was from a long established family, the Ketchums of Buffalo New York who helped establish the Buffalo and Erie area of New York before the Revolutionary War. Denis and Ada Charlton Brennan wed September 14, 1907 in New York City; the couple would have three children, daughter Muriel Denise (born August 1908), son Kearns (born August 1909) who died within hours of his birth and lastly, daughter Alice Eleanor (born December 1910). Ada and son Kearns are buried along with several generations of Adas Brennan in-laws, in the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York. Ada who had contracted tuberculosis (presumably from Denis, as he and many of his close and distant relatives had the disease) was periodically treated for the illness throughout her life. Denis was in fact treated for the illness at the Acoaxcet Sanitorium in Westport, Massachusetts and the Ogden Farms Sanitorium in New York during their courtship. On August 25, 1912 (his daughter Muriel's fourth birthday), after visiting Ada in the Edward Livingston Trudeau Sanatorium in Saranac Lake, New York, where she was receiving tuberculosis treatment, Denis, as his brother did several years before him, disappeared from his family and all known friends and acquaintances. From that day forth, Denis never contacted his wife nor children again. After being abandoned, Ada and her daughters moved to Monrovia, California to be near her sister Lillian and where Ada continued to receive tuberculosis treatment at the Pottenger Tuberculosis Sanatorium which was run by Adas brother in law Dr. John Lanabee Pomeroy. Eventually Ada established contact with Denis' brother, esteemed Hollywood director William Desmond Taylor. William generously began sending Ada $50 per month to help support her children. It is believed that Denis eventually moved to Los Angeles, California and resumed contact with and quietly worked for his brother for a few years. The rumor that the blacksmith in Taylor's 1914 film Captain Alvarez was Denis Deane-Tanner was mentioned in the papers and attributed to an anonymous New Yorker who stated he recognized him. Connection to the murder of William Desmond Taylor Many theories exist trying to tie the disappearance of Denis to the murder of his brother William. While the rumors vary from the wild and salacious to mere conjecture, the reality is that through the investigations of both the police and reporters of the time, Denis was not the murderer, nor was he a part of the murder. Reporters at the time floated the idea that Denis was masquerading as Edward Sands, his brother's felonious butler. Handwriting analysis of both men and known photo comparisons quickly disqualified the misinformation. Denis never contacted his family in the United States, nor his family in England and Ireland. It was believed within the family that Denis eventually succumbed to tuberculosis while living in anonymity in either the United States or Europe.

Brian √ìg represented Derry under 15's and under 16's and was called into the minor team before having to pull out due to illness. He captained the Steelstown teams up to minor level. Brian √ìg had a huge influence upon every one who knew him. Steelstown decided to rename the club in honour of the committed footballer to Steelstown Brian √ìg's GAC. Steelstown also retired the number 5 jersey in his honour. In 2010, Steelstown were runners up to Castledawson in the Intermediate Championship final, losing out by a late point on the scoreline of 0‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì11.

There were large turrets on three of the corners and to the front was a large gate tower with two flanking defensive turrets. It was surrounded by beautiful gardens and parkland and the vast Ardkinglas estate.

History Beginnings (2002‚Äì2007) Brothers Anton and Lewis Patzner started off playing metal violin and cello duets on the streets in Berkeley, California in 2002. They quickly released a seven-song acoustic EP and began playing rock shows as Judgement Day. The CD was self-recorded and about 500 copies were made and sold at shows and on the street. It is now out of print. Shortly after the release of that disc the brothers recruited their friend Jon Bush to play drums and began playing fully amplified shows in Santa Cruz and Oakland with bands like The Botticellis, Minkus, Desa and The Matches. Many of these early shows, while well received, were plagued with sound problems, mostly because of the feedback that comes from amplifying and distorting acoustic instruments. Eventually the band refined their techniques, bought the right kind of gear and figured out how to make their sound work on stage. In November 2004 Judgement Day released their debut full-length record, \\"Dark Opus\\". The record immediately gained praise in local and online press. Entirely self recorded and released, the half-hour album includes mostly tracks of heavy metal and hardcore with drums and distorted violin and cello but also includes some slower interlude tracks with string orchestras. One metal song features a full choir. Unfortunately, soon after the release of \\"Dark Opus\\" Judgement Day was put on hold as Lewis Patzner began to concentrate heavily on receiving his cello performance degree from The Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore. Adding to the hiatus, Anton Patzner was recruited to play violin for notable indie-rock band Bright Eyes after Judgement Day was discovered playing an acoustic set outside of The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco by Cursive.Violin Apocalypse Now 2005-08-10 For the next three years, Judgement Day released no new recordings and only played a few scattered shows. They did manage to play their first tour in May 2006, which included dates in Los Angeles, San Diego and Santa Barbara in addition to Northern California. Also in 2006 the band joined MySpace and started a YouTube channel, posting live footage of street performances, club shows and webcasts as well as music videos and a promotional video called \\"December 29th is Judgement Day\\" which became a minor hit with over 30,000 views. 2008‚Äì2009 Lewis Patzner graduated from Conservatory in spring of 2007 and the brothers both moved back to the bay area to begin work on another album.Return of Guitarless Metal 2007-06-06 On May 9, 2008 Judgement Day released a 6-song EP title \\"Opus 3: Acoustic\\". In August 2008 they began touring nationally, supporting headlining acts such as Dredg,\\"AP&R;: Judgement Day\\". Alternative Press No. 262 (May 2010), p. 28. Mates of State, and Margot and the Nuclear So and So's. Judgement Day first played at Pittsburgh punk venue Mousetrap Manor on October 21, 2008. On July 21, 2009 Judgement Day released a 7\\" record entitled \\"Out of the Abyss: Live on Tape\\" on Third Culture Records. 2010-present Judgement Day has released their second full-length record entitled \\"Peacocks / Pink Monsters\\". According to their blog they recorded drums at Nu-Tone Studios with engineer Riki Feldmann in Pittsburg, California and finished overdubs at Anton's home studio. \\"Peacocks / Pink Monsters\\" was released independently on April 13, 2010. A collection of outtakes, rarities, covers and jams from the first 8 years of Judgement Day was released on May 19, 2010. The album was named B‚Ä¢SIDES, a reference to the time of gramophone records when secondary songs were stored on the record's flipside.

It is the second film in the Puppet Master franchise, the sequel to 1989's Puppet Master, and stars Elizabeth Maclellan, Gregory Webb, Charlie Spradling, Jeff Weston and Nita Talbot as paranormal investigators who are terrorized by the animate creations of an undead puppeteer, played by Steve Welles. Puppet Master II, as well as the third, fourth and fifth installments of the series, were only available in DVD format through a Full Moon Features box set that was briefly discontinued, until in 2007 when Full Moon Features reacquired the rights to the first five films. A remastered edition Blu-ray and DVD of the film was released on September 18, 2012. Plot 1989: Andr√© Toulon's grave is being excavated in Shady Oaks cemetery behind the Bodega Bay Inn. Pinhead dusts off and opens Andr√© Toulon's casket, then climbs out and pours a vial of neon liquid on the corpse, while Tunneler, Leech Woman, Blade and Jester watch on from the grave‚Äôs edge as the skeleton‚Äôs arms rise into the air. A few months later, parapsychologists Carolyn Bramwell, her brother Patrick, and the flirtatious Lance and Wanda, are sent to the hotel to investigate the strange murder of Megan Gallagher, whose brain was extracted through her nose (by Blade). Alex Whitaker, driven insane, is suspected of the murder and locked up in an asylum. While at the asylum, his terrible seizures and premonitions are perceived as lunatic rantings. Their guest psychic, Camille Kenney, decides to leave after spotting two puppets in her room and warning the others they aren't safe; however, while packing, Pinhead and Jester attack and kidnap her. The next day, Carolyn calls Michael, Camille's son, after finding her belongings and car still at the hotel but Camille missing. That evening, while Patrick is sleeping, he's killed by Tunneler when the puppet drills into his head. Lance and Wanda run in and Lance kills Tunneler by crushing him with a lamp. They dissect Tunneler and realize that the puppets are not remote controlled, but rather they run on a chemical they determine is the secret of artificial intelligence. The next morning, a man named Eriquee Chane√© (the reanimated Toulon in disguise) enters the hotel, stating that he had inherited it after Megan's death, and that he has just returned from Bucharest. They doubt his claim, but he tells them they can stay and investigate although his quarters are off limits to them. Afterwards, Michael arrives at the hotel, worried about Camille. That evening, Blade and Leech Woman go to a local farmer's house where Leech Woman kills the husband, Matthew, taking his eye. His wife, Martha manages to throw Leech Woman into the furnace. As Martha is about to shoot Blade with a shotgun, a new puppet, Torch, walks in and kills Martha with a flame-thrower built into his arm. Blade takes a piece of her charred remains and he and Torch return to Eriquee/Toulon where it's revealed he believes that Carolyn is a reincarnation of his now deceased wife, Elsa. Toulon has a flashback to Cairo, 1912 when he and Elsa bought the formula for animating inanimate objects. The next morning, Michael and Carolyn go into town to find Camille and to find out more about Eriquee Chanee. Meanwhile, the puppets are killing various people because they are growing weaker and need the secret ingredient that makes Toulon's formula: brain tissue. (This is why they needed Megan's brain to reanimate Toulon) Carolyn finds no records of \\"Eriquee Chane√©\\", and starts to connect him to the disappearance of Camille and the death of her brother, Patrick. Later, Carolyn and Michael share a romantic night together, as do Lance and Wanda. While Wanda goes back to her room, Blade kills Lance, killing Wanda afterwards. After killing them, he uses their tissue for the formula. During this, Carolyn sneaks into Toulon's room, and finds two life sized mannequins in the wardrobe. Toulon sneaks up behind Carolyn, and still thinking she is Elsa, ties her up. Michael, hearing her screams, wakes up and goes to rescue her, all while fighting off Torch, Pinhead, and Blade. On his way up, the dumbwaiter opens, revealing Jester and Michael's dead mother, Camille. Toulon transfers his soul into one of the mannequins, and explains that after seeing Carolyn, he decided for them to live together forever. The puppets, upon hearing this, realize Toulon used them for his evil needs, and start torturing him. Michael then breaks into the room, saves Carolyn, and the two run out of the hotel. Up in the attic, Torch sets Toulon on fire, causing him to fall out a window and die. Afterward, Jester goes back to Camille's body with the remaining of the formula. After her soul has been placed into the female mannequin, Camille decides to drive the puppets to the Bouldeston Institution for the Mentally Troubled Tots and Teens in her car, so they can \\"enchant\\" the children.

He later moved to California to sing with his cousin Lou‚Äôs group, which led to other musical opportunities. Molina joined Danny Whitten and Billy Talbot in the doo-wop group Danny and the Memories, which in the 60s morphed into a folk-rock act called The Psyrcle, later known as The Rockets. As the decade came to a close, the group renamed themselves Crazy Horse after playing with Neil Young. Although the band lineup has changed over the years, Molina and Talbot have remained as core members of Crazy Horse, recording over 30 albums. Molina released his first solo album, Love & Inspiration in March 2019.

It is a project of the Issaquah History Museums (formerly known as the Issaquah Historical Society). The IVT operates from the Issaquah Depot Museum building located at 78 First Ave, NE. The service operated on a trial basis in 2001‚Äì02 and has operated on a regular basis, seasonally, since 2012. History After restoration of the Issaquah Depot neared completion in 1989, a group of Issaquah Historical Society members considered options for active use of the tracks leading to and from the restored depot. Discussions included dinner trains, passenger trains and eventually led to the easier to manage streetcar option. Brill car 519 pulling in at the end of the day. At right is ex-Milan car 96, which was never operated in Issaquah. In 2001‚Äì02, a trolley car borrowed from Yakima Valley Trolleys was operated along existing, former- freight railroad track to prove the concept that an operating trolley in Issaquah would attract ridership. The borrowed streetcar had arrived in Issaquah in October 2000, and began carrying passengers on May 19, 2001, with the service operating on Saturdays and Sundays from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. through the summer and again in spring 2002. In spring 2001, a small carbarn to house the trolley car was built adjacent to the Issaquah Depot. It is long, with a capacity to store just one trolley (and its towed generator). IVT sometimes refers to it as the \\"display building\\", because glass windows on its west side allow the public to see the trolley car inside. After returning the borrowed trolley to Yakima in May 2002, Issaquah acquired three trolleys of its own: an ex-Milan interurban car (No. 96) from the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and two narrow gauge ex-Lisbon trolleys (Nos. 519 and 521, originally built by the J. G. Brill Company and assembled in Lisbon in 1925) from a failed plan for a trolley line in Aspen, Colorado. None was able to operate, as they all needed restoration work before being usable for service, and the ex-Lisbon trolleys also required \\"re-gauging\\" from gauge to to enable them to run on the existing railroad track in Issaquah. In March 2012, one of the ex-Lisbon cars, No. 519, was sent to the Gomaco Trolley Company, in Iowa, for restoration and re-gauging of its truck. The car returned from Gomaco in August, its restoration completed, and made a test run over the line. with additional crew training then following. It entered service in Issaquah on October 14, 2012. Restored ex-Lisbon car 519 crossing Front Street in 2014 As part of its payment to Gomaco for restoration of car 519, IVT transferred ownership of the other Lisbon car, No. 521, to Gomaco. The car was shipped to Gomaco in August 2012, and Gomaco began a heavy restoration of it as an internal project. By that time, IVT had dropped all plans to use the 1930-built ex-Milan car No. 96 and put it up for sale. The car was sold in 2015 to the Oregon Electric Railway Historical Society and was transported to the Oregon Electric Railway Museum in December 2016.\\"Museum News\\" (February 2017). Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, p. 72. UK: LRTA Publishing. The IVT group's original hopes to rebuild one to of recently removed track on the Lake Sammamish rail-trail, as far as the boat-launch, were dashed upon removal of rail equipment and completion of the East Lake Sammamish Trail in 2006. Operation Interior of car 519 in service bridge plate in place for easier and safer boarding Public service began on October 14, 2012, with initial hours of operation scheduled for weekends from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. until sometime in November. The section of railroad line brought into use for rides at that time was about long, stopping just before the bridge over the East Fork of Issaquah Creek. The section of track north of the bridge could not be used until repair work on the bridge. By 2016, rehabilitation work on the bridge had been completed, allowing the route to be extended across and beyond the bridge, to Gilman Blvd., where the track ends. The extended line came into use at the beginning of the 2016 season, on May 7, making the overall length of usable track about long.\\"Museum News\\" (August 2016). Tramways & Urban Transit magazine, p. 312. UK: LRTA Publishing. Future plans include building a small covered platform at the end of the line adjacent to the Issaquah Chamber of Commerce building, which would allow the trolley to serve the purpose of an actual (though limited) transit system, ferrying riders between Issaquah's downtown (accessed from the Issaquah Depot) and the Issaquah commercial core's other major pedestrian destinations: Confluence Park and the Gilman Village shopping district (accessed from the new Gilman Station). The trolley tows a generator car to supply its traction motors with electricity, rather than receiving power from overhead wires. The museum also has an operational 0-4-0 Plymouth gasoline-mechanical locomotive for use as a rescue vehicle if the trolley were to fail mid-trip. The Plymouth is also undergoing a retrofitting of the brake mechanism to allow it use in regular passenger service.

Forward Kwenda is a mbira performer from Zimbabwe. He was born in the rural Buhera area in Manicaland, an area known for its fierce resistance to colonial rulers and respect for Shona tradition. As a young boy, Forward excelled in traditional dance and recitation of ancient poetry. At the age of 10, he began to play ngoma (drums) and hosho (gourd rattles) for his mother's gombwe (rain-making) spirit. He was given the name \\"Forward\\" because of his curiosity about many subjects, enthusiastic involvement in many activities and his performances for guerrilla forces during the Rhodesian Bush War. At an early age, Forward borrowed an mbira and, with no teacher other than occasional radio programmes, began to play on his own. In 1984, Kwenda moved to Zimbabwe's capital city of Harare and began to play mbira with other musicians. Within a year, he had formed his own mbira group and was making records and performing on national radio, as well as performing constantly at mapira ceremonies. During this period, he was informed by powerful rain-making spirits that he was to devote his life to playing mbira for their ceremonies. He was particularly known as a teenager for bringing the desired spirits to a ceremony by the end of the first song he played at a ceremony. In 1985, Forward began playing in a unique complex style - much to the amazement of master mbira players two and three generations his senior. This style, considered in Shona culture to be \\"more ancient\\" because spirits prefer it, was first recorded in 1985 and 1986 by his American friend Glenn Makuna, who dubbed Kwenda \\"the Coltrane of mbira.\\". Hand-to-hand distribution of those cassettes, and others recorded later, has led to international acclaim for the virtuosity, soulfulness, and unprecedented range of melodic and rhythmic improvisation of Kwenda's playing. Meanwhile, he is in great demand in Zimbabwe, where the most ancient spirits, the makombwe, believed to be the ancestors of all mankind, prefer Kwenda's ancient style and come to earth as soon as he begins playing his mbira. Kwenda claims \\"It's not me, my spirits just play through me,\\" and takes no credit whatsoever for his virtuosity. Asked about his experience of playing mbira, Forward responds: In 1997, Kwenda toured the United States with Erica Azim, and recorded the Shanachie CD Svikiro: Meditations of an Mbira Master. In 1999, a transcendent field recording of Kwenda on a Zimbabwean mountaintop at sunset. In February 2000, Kwenda performed at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC with Erica Azim, and they toured North America during 2000, 2001 and 2002. In 2019 Forward Kwenda coauthored the book Learn to Play Mbira : Traditional Songs and Improvisation with author, Andy Fowler. On January 1st 2020, they launched the mbira master video and tablature archiving project mbira.online within which, Forward is the predominant tutor/performer. Forward and Andy now work together at Mbira Magic to 'promote mbira music and create employment for Zimbabwean musicians'.

Designed in the Beaux-Arts style by the architectural firm Simon & Simon, the building was erected for the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co. in 1928. The 29-story high-rise is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building was long regarded as premier office space, but by the 1980s, tenants were leaving for newer buildings in the West Market Street neighborhood. Extensive rehab work has since drawn new tenants. Its largest tenant has always been the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company or its successor companies ‚Äî today, Wells Fargo. The limestone and granite skyscraper features recesses that give the building an H-shape above the fifth floor. Decorations include sculpture by Piccirilli Brothers and of marble. Seven medallions, mainly depicting early American coins, decorate the street-level facade. Bas-relief figures decorate the spandrels above the building's bronze doors, which are themselves decorated by high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. History In the late 1920s, numerous high-rises were constructed in Center City Philadelphia. Among the businesses commissioning new high-rises was the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company, the result of the 1926 merger between Fidelity Trust Company and the Philadelphia Trust Company. Before the merger, in 1925, architects Edward P. Simon and Grant M. Simon of the firm Simon and Simon were approached to design a new building. The designs were complete by the end of 1926 and in January 1927 general contractor Irwin & Leighton was engaged to build the Fidelity- Philadelphia Trust Company Building. The site of the building along Broad Street was previously the location of the Forrest Theater and the \\"Yellow Mansion\\" (also known as the Dundas Lippincott House). Construction began in 1927 and the building was opened on June 1, 1928. The building became premier office space in the center of the city, serving as the home of major law firms among other tenants. In 1953, steel and concrete pen houses were built at the back of the building to house air conditioning equipment. In July 1982, the parent company of Fidelity Bank, Fidelcor, put up for sale Fidelity Building Corp., a subsidiary which owns The Fidelity Building and the neighboring Witherspoon Building. In December of that year, Fidelcor announced that the Al-Tajir Foundation, a real estate investment company owned by Mahdi Al Tajir, had agreed to buy Fidelity Building Corp. for US$63.5 million. During the late-1980s office building boom in the West Market Street area of Center City, businesses left the Fidelity Building for newer office space. As a result, the building's owners filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992. That same year, the Fidelity Building Corporation was purchased by First Fidelity Bankcorp, a company formed in the 1988 merger of the building's original owners and First Fidelity Corporation of Newark, New Jersey. First Union Corporation took control of the building in 1995 when it bought Fidelity Bankcorp. Shortly after taking over, First Union spent millions of dollars renovating the facade and interiors and modernizing the mechanical systems. In 2000, First Fidelity Building Corporation, a company controlled by First Union, put the Fidelity Building up for sale. Later that year, Nicholas Schorsch, of the American Financial Resource Group, and a group of investors bought the building for about US$110 million. In 2006, a portion of the lower floors of the building was sold to Resnick Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Jack Resnick & Sons Incorporated. In April 2008, American Financial Realty Trust sold the remainder of the building to SSH Real Estate and Young Capital for US$57.7 million. South entrance to the building (2014) During the early 2000s, the building became known as the Wachovia Building. Wachovia became the building's largest tenant after merging with First Union Corporation early in the decade. In 2006, Wachovia re-negotiated its lease, which was set to expire in 2010. After exploring other potential new office space in Center City, Wachovia made a deal to stay in the Wachovia Building along with the neighboring Witherspoon Building, the nearby One South Broad, and the Widener Building until the 2020s. The building became known as the Wells Fargo Building after Wells Fargo, which bought Wachovia in 2008, re- branded Wachovia area banks in April 2011. Wells Fargo marketed the change by having a stagecoach carrying Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter and others ride from Philadelphia City Hall to the Wells Fargo Building. Architecture The 29-story, Wells Fargo Building is located on the Avenue of the Arts in Center City, Philadelphia. The building faces Broad Street on the west, Walnut Street on the south, and Sansom Street on the north. To the east of the building is the 11-story Witherspoon Building, built in 1896. Owned by the same owners, the two buildings are linked together. Containing , the Wells Fargo Building's footprint measures by . Built in the Beaux-Arts style the building's brick curtain wall is made of limestone ashlar on the upper and lower floors and rusticated granite on the 2nd and 3rd floors. Horizontally the building is divided into three parts. The first two stories and a mezzanine level make up the building's base. The next eighteen floors make up the building's shaft and center. The distinctive features of the center are two recesses on the east and west sides of the building. Starting above the fourth floor, the recesses give the building an H-shape. The skyscraper's top section is distinguished from the lower floors by three small setbacks. The building during the 2011 Philadelphia International Festival of the Arts At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is slightly larger than the others to indicate the entrance to the main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male figure with a hammer representing industry and a female figure with a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art. Next to the two smaller archways are carved medallions, one flanking each spandrel. The medallions closest to Sansom Street represent early American coins, a Pine Tree coin from Massachusetts and Grandi Copper coin from Connecticut. The medallions closest to the Walnut Street side represent the first American coin issued by Congress and the Eye Coin from Vermont. Two medallions on the Walnut Street side depict both sides of the Lafayette Medal. Only one medallion decorates the Samson Street side, depicting another early coin from Vermont. The Wells Fargo Building's interiors include a 2¬Ω-story banking hall featuring six 58-ton steel girders that support the skyscraper's structure. The girders were the largest in the Eastern United States at the time of construction. Among the of marble inside the Wells Fargo Building is the cream-colored terrazzo marble used throughout the banking hall. At the rear of the hall is a marble sculpture by the Piccirilli Brothers. The statue depicts semi-nude male and female representations of day and night clasping hands under a clock to symbolize eternity. Above the statue and framed by marble pilasters is a window that depicts scenes from Philadelphia history. In the window's tympanum is a depiction of Independence Hall. Below that are pictures showing William Penn's treaty with the Indians, George Washington's Farewell Address to Congress, the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence, the Philadelphia Convention, the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin's printing office, Betsy Ross exhibiting the United States flag, and Caesar Rodney's ride from Delaware. The border of the window contains portrait busts of notable American Revolution-era Philadelphians: John Bartram, George Clymer, Robert Morris, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, and James Wilson. The Wells Fargo Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 27, 1978. The skyscraper was listed because it was an excellent example of commercial Beaux-Arts architecture and because it stands \\"as a glossary of modern skyscraper design, synthesizing the primary features of three phases of skyscraper development reaching back to the 1880s\\". The building's characteristics are its tripartite system of a base, shaft, and capital, the treatment of the skyscraper as a tower, and the use of setbacks. Tenants Leasing 30 percent of the building, Wells Fargo is the skyscraper's largest tenant. The second largest tenant was law firm Montgomery, McCracken, Walker & Rhoads, which occupies about on the top five and a half floors; the firm signed a 15-year lease in 1995. Other tenants include Domus Inc., which occupies . Domus Inc. moved into the Wells Fargo Building in 2000 after outgrowing its space in the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel. Past tenants include the law firms Morgan Lewis & Bockius and Pepper Hamilton & Sheetz and offices for the Westmoreland Coal Company. A private eating club used to operate at the top of the building. Called the Midday Club, it was intended \\"to provide in the heart of the financial district, removed from the noise and activity of the street, a place where businessmen can dine in a restful atmosphere with their business associates\\". The Midday Club opened in 1929 and closed in 1978. Museum The lobby holds a branch of the Wells Fargo History Museum; its exhibits include a stagecoach, telegraph equipment, historic clothing and currency.

The lake derives its name from the Anglicization from the Spanish name, Rodriguez Dry Lake. It is the central part of Edwards Air Force Base as its hard surface provides a natural extension to the paved runways. It was formerly known as Muroc Dry Lake. Geology Rogers Dry Lake is located in the Antelope Valley, about drive north of Los Angeles. It covers an area of about at the low point of the valley, forming a rough figure eight. It is the bed of a lake that formed roughly 2.5 million years ago, in the Pleistocene. It is long and wide at its greatest dimensions. The bed of the lake is unusually hard, capable of withstanding as much as 250 psi without cracking. This is sufficient to allow even the heaviest aircraft to land safely. During the extremely brief rainy season, it is possible for there to be standing water on the lakebed, which pools at the approximate low-point elevation of 2,300 ft for the region. The lake is adjacent to the smaller Rosamond Lake which through the Holocene, together made up one large water-body. History The area of the lakebed was first used by the railroads, with a watering station for steam engines located nearby by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. In 1910, the Corum family settled on the lake bed; they attempted to create a small community called \\"Muroc\\" (the name reversed), which failed. In 1933, the United States Army arrived, looking to establish a bombing range in the area. The lakebed's potential use as an airfield was then realized, and in 1937 the United States Army Air Corps set up Muroc Air Field for training and testing, which later became Edwards Air Force Base. During World War II, a replica of a Japanese cruiser was constructed on the lakebed, nicknamed \\"Muroc Maru\\". The ship was demolished in 1950. Edwards Air Force Base Many of the United States' notable aeronautical achievements have taken place at Rogers Lake, including the testing of experimental military aircraft, the breaking of the sound barrier by Chuck Yeager, and landings of the Space Shuttle. It is also famous for the world's largest compass rose painted into the lakebed. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985. Its principal runway is 04/22. In addition to its paved component of it has an extra of lakebed runway, and it is capable of landing all known aircraft. There are seven other official runways on the Rogers lakebed: * 17/35 is 7.5 mi (12.1 km) (primary runway) * 05/23 is 5.2 mi (8.4 km) * 06/24 is 1.4 mi (2.3 km) * 07/25 is 4.0 mi (6.4 km) * 09/27 is 2.0 mi (3.2 km) * 30 is 2.0 mi (3.2 km) (runway 30 rolls out onto the compass rose, so its corresponding, unmarked, runway 12 is never used) * 15/33 is 6.2 mi (10.0 km) * 18/36 is 4.5 mi (7.2 km) See also * List of lakes in California * List of National Historic Landmarks in California References External links * Official Edwards Air Force Base website Category:Endorheic lakes of California Category:Edwards Air Force Base Category:Lakes of the Mojave Desert Category:Lakes of Kern County, California Category:Landforms of Kern County, California Category:Salt flats of California Category:Military facilities on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:National Historic Landmarks in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Kern County, California Category:Protected areas of the Mojave Desert Category:Lakes of Southern California Category:Lakes of California ","title":"Rogers Dry Lake"},{"id":"7153315","text":"PrISUm Solar Car is the multidisciplinary student-run solar car racing team from Iowa State University that designs and builds solar powered vehicles to compete in the American Solar Challenge (ASC).

The School of Paris, long the headquarters of the global art market, typically launched new movements, so there was both financial and cultural fall-out when all the excitement was suddenly emanating from New York. The post-war New York avant-garde, artists like Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock, would soon become \\"art stars,\\" commanding large sums and international attention. The Ninth Street Show marked their \\"stepping-out,\\" and that of nearly 75 other artists, including Helen Frankenthaler, Joan Mitchell, Grace Hartigan, Robert de Niro, Sr., Philip Guston, Elaine de Kooning, Lee Krasner, Franz Kline, Ad Reinhardt, David Smith, Milton Resnick, Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman and many others who were then mostly unknown to an art establishment that ignored experimental art without a ready market. The artist-led show was intended to make names ‚Äî and it did. Word of the exhibition slipped out prior to the Monday night preview, but that only added to the interest. Author Mary Gabriel writes, \\"Nothing sold, but no one cared. The exhibition had earned the artists attention on their own terms.\\" Their form of art ‚Äî the New York School ‚Äî was later called \\"the quintessential American and modern art movement.\\" At the time, however, \\"[i]t appeared as though a line had been crossed, a step into a larger art world whose future was bright with possibility.\\"Bruce Altshuler, Avant-Garde In Exhibition: New Art in the 20th Century, (New York: Harry N.

The Artists  \\"Since few of them had ever received any significant notice,\\" the New Yorker's Claudia Roth Pierpont writes, describing both the artists and the exhibition's selection process, \\"the rush to participate was so intense that everyone was limited to a single piece. Even in this renegade atmosphere,\\" she continues, \\"there was some initial discussion of whether including women in the exhibition would diminish its chance of being taken seriously. Eventually, the jury selected eleven women, and sixty-one men, to represent the creatively rich (if otherwise impoverished) new downtown art world, with its cheap industrial lofts, high communal spirits, and almost universal devotion to abstraction.\\" Note, however, although 74 artists were exhibited, only 64 are listed below, which is sourced from Franz Kline's original poster.

Critic Harold Rosenberg's \\"famous 1952 essay, 'The American Action Painters,' [which] effectively likened artists such as Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline to heroic existentialists wrestling with self- expression\\" is one good example. But praise from critics like the make-or- break \\"[Clement] Greenberg ... collectors like Peggy Guggenheim, and curators like MoMA‚Äôs Alfred H Barr ... [also helped] abstract expressionism eventually gain momentum among the art glitterati of New York in the 1950s, despite never being popular among the wider American public.\\" It was Greenberg, in fact, who claimed that \\"for the first time ever, the most 'advanced' form of Western art was no longer being produced in Europe but instead in New York. For him, it was painters like Pollock, Motherwell, De Kooning, Rothko, Kline, and Newman that were now, thanks to the new abstract languages they were developing, carrying on the work that had begun with the European avant-gardes.\\" A less enthusiastic public, however, meant that few galleries mounted shows featuring members of the group. The Stable Gallery, a converted horse stable, located at 924 7th Avenue and 58th Street in Manhattan, was an exception, and as host of the New York Painting and Sculpture Annuals from 1953‚Äì57, it exhibited some of the \\"Ninth Street Show\\" artists.‚Äô‚ÄôInterview with Nicolas Carone‚Äô‚Äô (New York School Press, 2000.) p.19 The poster for the second New York Painting and Sculpture Annual, also held at The Stable Gallery in 1953, included an introduction by critic Clement Greenberg, both crediting and praisingNew York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists, (New York School Press, 2000.) pp.20-21 the Ninth Street Show for setting a precedent for showing more daring work because the show was conceived and organized by artists: > This exhibition was conceived and organized by artists, the event rightly to > be considered the precedent for this one was the famous \\"Ninth Street\\" show > held in the spring of 1951 on the ground floor of a vacated store, on East > 9th St. Like this one, that exhibition was organized, and its participants > named and invited, by artists themselves, and a range of the liveliest > tendencies within the mainstream of advanced painting and sculpture was > presented.

The best-selling book ignited interest in the underappreciated women of abstract expressionism and in women artists, generally. On April 24, 2019, The Hollywood Reporter published an exclusive, reporting that Amazon Studios had optioned Gabriel's book for Amy Sherman- Palladino and Daniel Palladino to develop into a series.

The flag is first thought to have been used in 1858 by the Irish Republican Brotherhood. The sunburst flag is still used today, by both republican groups and the Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge.  History and origins of the flag  The sunburst flag's design is inspired by the Fianna of Irish mythology. Described as brave warriors who performed a large number of impressive feats, the Fianna referred to themselves as either Gal Gr√©ine or Scal Ghr√©ine, which both mean sunburst. The earliest confirmed use of the sunburst flag is found in the 18th century as the guidon of the County Sligo Light Horse. The motto was as Post nubila Phoebus (\\"After the clouds Sun\\") symbolizing a new day. The sunburst flag, and the symbol of the sunburst itself came into more common use by Irish nationalists during the 19th century. In 1858, the Irish Republican Brotherhood adopted the flag as their symbol. During the American Civil War, the sunburst motif was incorporated by several Irish regiments in their standards. In 1893 the Irish-language group called Conradh na Gaeilge established themselves, using the flag as the group's symbol in reference to the Fianna. Communist Party of Ireland and dissident republican groups Republican Network for Unity and Saoradh have incorporated it into their emblems.

It was destroyed by a lightning strike and subsequent fire on June 14, 2010. Located on the interstate-facing side of the church's outdoor amphitheater, the statue was set on an island at the head of the church's baptismal pool, flanked by fountains and lit by colored spotlights. It depicted Jesus from the chest up, with his arms and head raised to the sky. The statue had a span between its upraised hands and a Christian cross at its base. The completed statue weighed . Construction It was designed by Brad Coriell, sculpted by James Lynch, and assembled by Mark Mitten. Constructed on a metal frame or armature manufactured in nearby Lebanon, Ohio, the sculpted figure itself was created in Jacksonville, Florida, then trucked north. The main body of the statue was made from a core of Styrofoam covered by a thin skin of fiberglass. The sculpted statue was completed in September 2004 at a cost of approximately $250,000. Coriell donated some of his time to the project. Popularity and nicknames The statue was given many nicknames, both affectionate and derisive, by local residents and I-75 travelers. Among them were: *Big J *Big Butter Jesus *Touchdown Jesus (The statue's most popular nickname, albeit one more commonly associated with the mural on the Hesburgh Library overlooking Notre Dame Stadium; American football referees signal a touchdown with a similar gesture) *Super Jesus *MC 62-Foot Jesus (like musician MC 900 Ft. Jesus) *Terminator Jesus (after its destruction) The statue was also credited with inspiring two musical works: *Comedian Heywood Banks wrote and performed his novelty song \\"Big Butter Jesus\\" about the statue. *Singer-songwriter Robbie Schaefer of the band Eddie from Ohio wrote the song \\"Monroe, OH\\" after driving past the statue.Robbie Schaefer, Strange and Lovely World The statue was also a popular photographic subject for fans of The Ohio State University, who would align Jesus' upraised arms as the \\"H\\" when spelling out \\"O-H-I-O\\".http://www.plunderbund.com/wp- content/uploads/2010/06/ohio_jesus.jpg Destruction On June 14, 2010, the statue was struck by lightning and consumed in the resulting blaze. The statue had been sculpted using a thin skin of fiberglass over a flammable styrofoam interior stabilized by a metal frame, and the fire consumed all but the internal metal structure. Following the fire, the pastor of the church stated that the church planned to rebuild the statue with fireproof material. In the days after the destruction, the church's digital sign displayed the message \\"He'll be back\\". Although the statue cost about $250,000 to construct, it was insured for $500,000 because the artist, Brad Coriell, had donated his time to the creation. It was estimated the statue and amphitheater sustained an estimated $700,000 in damages ‚Äî $300,000 for the statue and $400,000 for the amphitheater. PETA offered funding through an \\"anonymous Christian donor\\" to help rebuild the statue if allowed to promote veganism at the church. Replacement statue Construction of a 52-foot replacement statue with a substantially different design began in June 2012. The new statue, called Lux Mundi, was assembled on the site on September 19, 2012 and dedicated on September 30, 2012.

Moos's work has been shown at the Birmingham (Alabama) Museum of Art, the Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House (formerly known as The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu), the Mint Museum of Art, Norton Museum of Art, the Renaissance Society of Chicago and elsewhere. Moos's approach to photography explores worlds of opposites.

Series   Monsanto  In a series titled \\"Monsanto\\", Moos photographs American farmers who cultivate their crops using Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO's) manufactured by the Monsanto Company. The series was created during her residence at the St. Louis Forum for Contemporary Art located near Monsanto's headquarters. Moos chose to represent her subjects in an objective manner despite the highly controversial topic of biogenetic engineering. Her portraits offered a straightforward, unbiased presentation of the farmer's work, the land, and the corporation supporting them. While the series included photos that followed her previous work's pattern by pairing two people in one photo, \\"Monsanto\\" veered slightly by adding heighted focus to the surrounding landscape and the presence of the unseen corporation. This series is based on James Agee's article \\"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\\", published as a book with photographs by Walker Evans.  Friends and Enemies  The series features couples who fall into one of two categories: best friends or worst enemies. Moos places the two subjects against non-descript backgrounds providing no extra evidence and allowing the viewer conclude the relationship between the couple.

Richards who published the equation in 1931. It is a nonlinear partial differential equation, which is often difficult to approximate since it does not have a closed-form analytical solution. Although attributed to Richards, it is established that this equation was actually discovered 9 years earlier by Lewis Fry Richardson in his book \\"Weather prediction by numerical process\\" published in 1922 (p.108). Darcy's law was developed for saturated flow in porous media; to this Richardson applied a continuity requirement suggested by Edgar Buckingham and obtained a \\"general partial differential equation describing water movement in unsaturated non- swelling soils\\". The transient state form of this flow equation, known commonly as Richards' equation writes in one-dimension (vertical): :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial t}= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} \\\\left[ K(\\\\theta) \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial z} + 1 \\\\right) \\\\right]\\\\ where :K is the hydraulic conductivity, :h is the matric head induced by capillary action, :z is the elevation above a vertical datum, :\\\\theta is the volumetric water content, and :t is time. Derivation Here we show how to derive the Richards equation for the vertical direction in a very simplistic form. Conservation of mass says the rate of change of saturation in a closed volume is equal to the rate of change of the total sum of fluxes into and out of that volume, put in mathematical language: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial t}= \\\\vec{ abla} \\\\cdot \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n{\\\\vec{q}_{i,\\\\,\\\\text{in}}} - \\\\sum_{j=1}^m{\\\\vec{q}_{j,\\\\,\\\\text{out}}} \\\\right) Put in the 1D form for the direction \\\\hat{k}: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial t}= -\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} q Flow in the horizontal direction is formulated by the empiric law of Darcy: :q= - K \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial z} Substituting q in the equation above, we get: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial t}= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} \\\\left[ K \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right] Substituting for H = h + z: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial t}= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} \\\\left[ K \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial z} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right ) \\\\right] = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z} \\\\left[ K \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial z} + 1 \\\\right ) \\\\right] We then get the equation above, which is also called the mixed form of Richards' equation. Formulations The Richards equation appears in many articles in the environmental literature because it describes the flow in the vadose zone between the atmosphere and the aquifer. It also appears in pure mathematical journals because it has non-trivial solutions. Usually, it is presented in one of three forms. The mixed form containing the pressure and the saturation is discussed above. It can also appear in two other formulations: head-based and saturation-based. Head-based : C(h)\\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t}= abla \\\\cdot \\\\left( K(h) abla H \\\\right) Where C(h) [1/L] is a function describing the rate of change of saturation with respect the matric head: : C(h) \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta }{\\\\partial h} This function is called 'specific moisture capacity' in the literature, and can be determined for different soil types using curve fitting and laboratory experiments measuring the rate of infiltration of water into soil column, as described for example in van Genuchten (1980). Saturation-based : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\theta }{\\\\partial t}= abla \\\\cdot D(\\\\theta) abla \\\\theta Where D(Œ∏) [L2/T] is 'the soil water diffusivity': : D(\\\\theta) \\\\equiv \\\\frac{ K(\\\\theta) }{C(\\\\theta)} \\\\equiv K(\\\\theta)\\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{ \\\\partial \\\\theta} Limitations The numerical solution of the Richards equation is one of the most challenging problems in earth science. Farthing, Matthew W., and Fred L. Ogden, (2017). Numerical solution of Richards‚Äô Equation: a review of advances and challenges. Soil Science Society of America Journal, 81(6), pp.1257-1269.

This prevents use of the method in general applications where the risk of non-convergence is high. The method has also been criticized for over-emphasizing the role of capillarity,Germann, P.

Ogden (2003), Hydrol. Proc.,18, pp. 1-22. DOI:10.1002/hyp.1306., which is due to the small size of the representative elementary volume for multiphase flow in porous media. In three-dimensional applications the numerical solution of Richards' equation is subject to aspect ratio constraints where the ratio of horizontal to vertical resolution in the solution domain should be less than about 7.

Best known as a cult performer under the alias Yukio Yung, Burrows is also a prolific author of books relating to music history, theory, and tuition, technology, business, popular psychology and modern history. His works include The Art of Sound (Thames & Hudson), Mute: A Visual Document (co-authored with Daniel Miller) (Thames & Hudson), Guitars Illustrated (Billboard), 1001 Guitars... (Cassell), KISS Guide to Playing Guitar (Dorling Kindersley), Total Guitar Tutor (Barnes & Noble), and ITV Visual History of the 20th Century (Carlton). His books‚Äînow numbering close to one hundred titles‚Äîhave been published in sixteen countries and translated into a dozen languages. As a writer, his pseudonyms include Terence Ashley, Harrison Franklin, Hans-Joachim Vollmer and Yukio Yung.Terry Burrows, Orgone.co.uk (2006). Retrieved 25 September 2006 He has also written for numerous periodicals in the UK, US, and Germany. Burrows was born in Ipswich, Suffolk, England and started studying classical piano at the age of five. (AllMusic describes him as \\"A classically trained keyboardist with an advanced degree in computer engineering.\\") When he was 12 he started to teach himself guitar, and later took up bass, drums, and saxophone. The anti- establishment attitudes of punk subculture appealed to him but his musical influences included Syd Barrett, Kraftwerk, the Who, Brian Eno, the Television Personalities, and the Canterbury progressive music scene. Still in his teens, Burrows founded indie label, Hamster Records, releasing albums by non- commercial acts such as Loch Ness Monster, Rimarimba, R. Stevie Moore and Attrition, and his own \\"post-punk industrial funk\\" under the guise of Jung Analysts. In 1986, Cordelia Records released Burrows' Tree Climbing Goats (And Other Analysing Shanties) LP, his first release under the pseudonym Yukio Yung, chosen because of an obsession at that time with Japanese culture. In 1986, Burrows met Alan Jenkins, leader of The Deep Freeze Mice, and together they formed The Chrysanthemums, with Burrows as lead singer and keyboard. A psychedelic art pop band with a large cult following almost entirely outside of the UK, they released four albums and four EPs.Stewart Mason, 'Yukio Yung', Allmusic (2006). Retrieved 25 September 2006. In 2010, German music magazine MusikExpress placed them at number 23 in their list of the most under-rated bands of all time. At this time, Burrows also recorded a series of \\"abstract industrial\\" albums with celebrated \\"Krautrock\\" musician Asmus Tietchens, a former collaborator with Brian Eno and Cluster. The first volume, Watching The Burning Bride formed the soundtrack to the similarly named film, by Canadian director, Mark Mushet. He also produced a number of albums of instrumental prog-rock-tinged electronica as part of the duo Push-Button Pleasure. In the early 1990s, Burrows flirted briefly with electronic dance music releasing a pair of 12-inch singles as YooKO on the Belgian ZZB label, one of which, \\"Matrix\\", reached the Top Ten in Germany's Network Dance Chart. Burrows later released further solo Yukio Yung material, commencing with 1993's LP Art Pop Stupidity and CD A Brainless Deconstruction of the Popular Song. Over the next four years he released a single and four EPs. In 1997, Burrows rejoined with his ex-Chrysanthemums bandmate Vladimir Zajkowiecz [Martin Howells] to form a new version of that group, renamed with the visual pun Chrys&themums; to distinguish it from the original line-up. Musically, Burrows was uncharacteristically quiet between 1998 and 2004 ‚Äì a combination of ill health and an increasingly demanding publishing schedule. By 2003, he'd had more than 50 books published, and was recognized as one of the world's biggest-selling authors of music tuition titles, with sales of well over 2 million books in the US alone. During this period he also embarked on an additional career as an occasional university lecturer. In 2004, Burrows emerged again with a typically colorful selection of music projects, the most significant of which was the resumption of his collaboration with US home-recording pioneer R. Stevie Moore. The resulting album, compiled by Burrows on an Apple Macintosh computer, was released as Yung & Moore Versus The Whole Goddam Stinkin World. (The sleeve depicts the duo as cartoon superheroes about to demolish the planet ‚Äì an intended visual metaphor for the antipathy the mainstream has shown both artists' music over the years.) 2006 saw Burrows returning to the musical abstraction of his earlier career with Tonesucker, a prolific \\"fundamentalist\\" noise/drone project that has performed widely at festivals across Europe. Burrows has also performed on theremin and VCS3 at Britain's prestigious Aldeburgh Festival.

Its planned route would have extended the railway line which forms part of the present-day Northern line on the London Underground network. Nothing substantial was constructed. History The W&ER; had several proposed routes and stations but was generally intended to branch from the now closed Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&LR;) just before Edgware station and take a northerly route, with intermediate stations suggested at various times for Stanmore (London Road), Elstree (for Brockley Hill), Caldecott Hill (for Bushey Heath), Old Bushey, and Heathbourne Road. The line was planned to terminate at a station on the eastern side of Watford High Street, close to the site of Watford Central which was later planned by the Metropolitan Railway. One of the alternative proposals had it extend the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway from Rickmansworth in the direction of High Wycombe. The company's continuing failure to raise the capital needed to construct its line may have been partly due to the competition that it would have offered to existing services. Opposition came from the London and North Western Railway to a junction at Watford and from the Midland Railway to a junction at Mill Hill Broadway. Eventually the Great Northern Railway (purchasers of the EH&LR; before its opening) bought out the W&ER; and continued to develop proposals although nothing was built. In 1922, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (forerunner of most of the London Underground) purchased the W&ER; with the intention of using its land and right of way to continue the extension of the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway (CCE&HR;, now part of the Northern line) that it was then building north from Golders Green to Edgware. Various plans were made but no construction took place. Work on the route finally started in 1935 as part of Northern Heights plan, through which London Underground was to take over the EH&LR; lines, then part of the London and North Eastern Railway, and join them to the Northern line. This extension adopted much of the W&ER;'s concept, including the location of the junction between Edgware and Mill Hill, the location of the station at Edgware, and the route from Edgware to Old Bushey. The planned extension was to terminate at Bushey Heath due to funding limitations, but provision was made in the design of the station for a further extension to Old Bushey. Earthworks were underway and the tunnel near Elstree South station and the viaduct for Brockley Hill station had been partly constructed when the start of World War II caused works to cease. Work did not restart immediately after the war as there were stronger demands on funds for works elsewhere including the reconstruction of many damaged stations and the extensions of the Central line. After the introduction of Metropolitan Green Belt the Elstree and Bushey areas were protected against development, so the need for new stations to serve new residential developments in the area disappeared and the project was cancelled in 1950.

Domnall's existence is uncertain, and is based on attempts to reconcile eleventh century works such as the poem Duan Albanach and the Synchronisms of Flann Mainistrech with the evidence of the Irish annals.For the Duan and Flann, ESSH, pp. cxxxiv‚Äìcxxxv, provides a table showing their correspondence with the various sources. The Duan says that Domnall reigned for twenty-four years and places him between \\"Aodh\\", √Åed Find, and the two Conalls, Conall mac Taidg and Conall mac √Åed√°in.The full text of the Duan Albanach is available, with translation, at University College Cork's CELT project. Flann gives Domnall's father's name as \\"Constantine\\".ESSH, p. cxlvii. The only person of that relatively uncommon name known is Causant√≠n mac Fergusa, king of the Picts from 792 to 820. Since √Åed Find died in 778, and his brother Fergus mac Echdach was king of D√°l Riata at his death in 781, it is thought unlikely that Caustant√≠n's son could have been king as early as 781. Additionally, a king named Donncoirce is reported to have died in 792, and Conall mac Taidg died in 807, making it very difficult to accommodate a 24-year reign at this time.Broun, pp. 73‚Äì74; ESSH, pp. 248‚Äì251, 254, 255 & 259. Since no kings of D√°l Riata are known for the period from 811, when the four-year reign of Conall mac √Åed√°in is presumed to have ended, and the four- year reign of √Åed mac Boanta who died in 839, Domnall mac Caustant√≠n may have been king from around 811 to around 835.Broun, pp.79‚Äì83.

Corbitt was born in Oldham and knew his hangman even before he committed the crime. At the time of the murder, he was a frequent customer in Pierrepoint‚Äôs pub \\"Help The Poor Struggler\\" (on Manchester Road, in the Hollinwood area of Oldham), sang with him round the piano and called him \\"Tosh\\" while Pierrepoint called him \\"Tish\\" (Tish and Tosh were, at that time, common nicknames used between people who were passing acquaintances but who did not know each other's names; they were also the names of two popular fictional comic characters). Corbitt knew about the official sideline of his publican. At the time of the murder, Corbitt was separated from his wife and his 11-year-old son, and had a mistress, Eliza Woods. In August 1950, he throttled Woods in a hotel room in Ashton-under- Lyne, Lancashire. Her body was found the next morning with the word 'whore' written on her forehead. Corbitt pleaded guilty but insane. At his trial at Liverpool Assizes, the Crown argued the crime was premeditated and cited diary entries detailing Corbitt's plans to kill Woods. In his memoirs (Executioner: Pierrepoint), Pierrepoint wrote about his feelings when returning to the pub after Corbitt's execution: \\"I thought if any man had a deterrent to murder poised before him, it was this troubadour whom I called Tish. He was not only aware of the rope, he had the man who handled it beside him singing a duet. The deterrent did not work.\\" Pierrepoint goes on to relate Corbitt's final moments: Pierrepoint goes on to describe how Corbitt smiled and relaxed after this greeting. After strapping Corbitt's arms, Pierrepoint said \\"Come on Tish, old chap\\", at which Corbitt went to the gallows \\"...lightly...I would say that he ran.\\" The role of Corbitt is played by Eddie Marsan in the 2005 film Pierrepoint, which reproduced the scene. In 2008, Corbitt's son stated his father \\"probably deserved the hangman's noose\\", as he had been contemplating murdering Woods for a year.

It is the fourth film in the Puppet Master franchise, a sequel to 1990's Puppet Master II, and stars Gordon Currie as a youth scientist who, along with his friends, played by Chandra West, Ash Adams and Teresa Hill, is attacked by demons; the animated puppets of Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) serve to protect the group, similar to the role they played in the prequel Toulon's Revenge, rather than terrorize, as they had in the first and second films. Originally, Puppet Master 4 was intended to have the subtitle The Demon. Puppet Master 4, as well as the second, third, and fifth installments of the series, were only available in DVD format through a Full Moon Features box set that has since been discontinued. However, in 2007, Full Moon Features reacquired the rights to the first five films, and the boxset has since been reissued and is available directly from Full Moon, as well as through several online retailers. Plot In the underworld of Hell, a demon lord named Sutekh sends forth a trio of diminutive servants called the Totems, magically controlled by his netherworld minions, to kill those who possess the secret of animation, including the magic Andr√© Toulon used to give his puppets life. It transpires also that a team of researchers working on the development of artificial intelligence are close to discovering Toulon's secret. Sutekh sends one of the Totems as a package to two of the researchers involved, Dr. Piper and Dr. Baker of the Phoenix Division, who are taken by surprise, killed and stripped of their souls by the foul creature. One of the researchers, a talented young man named Rick Myers, is working as a caretaker at the Bodega Bay Inn and has also been using it for a place to conduct his experiments on the A.I. project. The same night Drs. Piper and Baker are murdered, Rick's friends Suzie, Lauren, and Cameron come to visit him. At dinner, Lauren, who is a psychic, finds Blade (who had been discovered earlier by Rick inside the house and is still animate) and then Toulon's old trunk, with the puppets, Toulons diary and some vials with the life-giving formula inside. Out of curiosity, Rick and his friends use the fluid on the puppets, and one by one they awaken; next to Blade, they find Pinhead, Six Shooter, Tunneler and Jester. (Torch, who joins the puppet cast in the sequel, makes no appearance here.) Fascinated by the puppets' spontaneous reactions, and believing that the formula is the answer to the running AI projects, Rick wants to see how smart they are by playing a laser tag game with Pinhead and Tunneler. Cameron, who is competing with Rick for success, tries to use the formula's secret for his personal gain, and he and Lauren decide to use a strange gameboard found in the trunk to try and contact Toulon for its exact composition, whose recipe was not recorded in the diary. But the glowing pyramid icon which goes with the board is a conduit between the mortal world and the underworld; Sutekh uses the link to send two of his Totems to attack. Cameron and Lauren attempt to flee by car, but Cameron is ambushed by one of the Totems inside his car and killed, while Lauren manages to get back into the hotel. When Rick looks after Cameron, the Totem attacks him as well, but he manages to escape. But inside the inn, the third Totem, sent in earlier by package, is also on the prowl. The puppets, intent on protecting Rick, search the hotel and soon manage to kill one of the Totems in the kitchen and, through its supervision link, its controller in the underworld. Then Toulon's spirit, who has been appearing around the hotel all night, tells the puppets to animate the Decapitron. Under Rick and Suzie's astonished eyes, the puppets move up to Rick's room, retrieve a box which contains yet another puppet with a soft plastic head, and revive it with the formula and a lightning strike. The two remaining Totems attack to disrupt the process, but one is electrocuted when Six Shooter uses a wire as a lariat to divert some of the lightning's power into it. Decapitron briefly awakens, and his head morphs into the likeness of Toulon, who explains to Rick the origin and the secret of the life-giving formula. The vial, however, turns out to be missing; immediately suspecting Cameron, Rick goes back to search his body, where he does find the vial. Meanwhile, the last Totem corners the panicked Lauren and prepares to drain her life away when Suzie interferes and douses it with acid. Toulon speaks through Lauren, urging Rick to animate Decapitron to destroy the Totem, and Rick uses his computer to divert power from his generator into Decapitron, bringing him to life. As the Totem attacks, Decapitron exchanges his plastic head for an electron-bolt launching system and destroys the creature. Afterwards, Toulon speaks to Rick yet again, surrendering custody of his puppets and the formula to him and promising his help in times of need.

Toulon committed suicide on March 15, and the film mentioned the Eastern Front, whose conduct of operations didn't take place until summer of 1941. In this film, Toulon's diary recounts Major Krauss's death as being on April 7.

Critical reception AllMusic's Andy Kellman said that, \\"While there are a few standouts on this album, Vazquez sounds tentative and too conscious about making the right moves, and the variety of material must be an experiment to find out where he fits best, including soppy adult contemporary (\\"4 the 1,\\" \\"One Shot\\"), harmless ska-inflected pop (\\"Don't Lie\\"), and marvelously horrible club-oriented garbage (\\"Cohiba\\").\\" He concluded that, \\"[T]he results next time should be significantly improved if Vazquez can work with a smaller team that can give him a more personalized and focused set of songs.\\" Ericka Souter, writing for People, also criticized the various genre- hopping throughout the album but gave credit to the first two tracks for properly showcasing Vazquez's vocal talents and charisma, saying that he's \\"still worthy of a little idol worship.\\" Julianne Shepherd of Vibe praised the Latin pop tracks for displaying Vazquez's tenor but found diversions away from it make his voice lack style.

Members include diocesan bishops, coadjutors, auxiliary bishops, and diocesan administrators. History The first meeting of the German bishops took place in W√ºrzburg in 1848, and in 1867 the Fulda Conference of Bishops (\\"next to the grave of St. Boniface\\") was established, which reorganized as German Bishops' Conference in 1966. The annual autumn conference of the German bishops still takes place in Fulda, while the meeting in spring is held at alternating places. After the construction of the Berlin Wall the ordinaries in the East German Democratic Republic (GDR) were inhibited to participate in the Fulda Conference of Bishops. In 1974 the GDR formally suggested talks with the Holy See. As one of the outcomes the Berlin Conference of Bishops was established for the East German ordinaries on 26 July 1976. The Diocese of Berlin, also comprising West Berlin, was thereafter represented in the German Bishops' Conference and the Berlin Conference alike, in the former by its vicar general, in the latter by the bishop personally. The Catholic Church did not consider the Berlin Conference as a national Bishops' Conference, since the Holy See officially conceived the East German ordinaries as part of the German Bishops' Conference as papally confirmed by its statute on 26 September 1976. East Germany's diocesan structure was complicated. Since 1972 three sees had their seat in East Germany, the dioceses of Berlin and of Dresden-Meissen and the Apostolic Administration of G√∂rlitz. The rest of East Germany belonged to dioceses seated in West Germany, which appointed commissaries for the East German parts of their dioceses. The Berlin Conference was disestablished in 1990. On 25 September 2018, the national Episcopal Conference threw the presentation of a self-commissioned study from which resulted at least 3.700 cases of sexual abuse in Germany from 1946 to 2014. More than a half were child abuses In 2010, the New York Times published the allegations of sexual abuses committed by a priest of the Munich diocese in the 80s. It was preceded by the ones of Lawrence Murphy in Wisconsin, happened in a school for deaf children from 1950 to 1974.

The battle took place outside the gates of Z√ºrich, beyond the Sihl (today's Aussersihl district). The troops of Z√ºrich, with Habsburg reinforcements, met the attacking confederates on the Sihlfeld north of St. Jakob on July 21. The confederation army, which numbered about 6,000 men, was met by Z√ºrich's disorganized troops and about 500 Austrian knights. The following morning the confederation army attacked the front and then the left flank of the army. Z√ºrich's forces were pushed back and had to escape across the Sihl into the city. The confederates did not have the means to lay siege to the city and withdrew. The defeat of Z√ºrich was thus not decisive, and the war continued until 1446. The commander of the Habsburg forces, Albrecht Freiherr von Bussnang, was killed behind the altar of the St. Jakob chapel. According to Z√ºrich chroniclers, Z√ºrich's burgomaster Rudolf St√ºssi fell at this battle amongst the defenders of the bridge across the Sihl. St√ºssi was covering his troops' retreat when he was killed by a confederate hiding below the bridge. This account, which emphasizes the burgomaster's bravery, is considered Z√ºrich propaganda by historians. Another version of the story has St√ºssi stopping in the middle of the bridge, brandishing his broad battle-axe and shouting, \\"Halt, citizens, halt!\\" To this a man of Zurich cried, \\"May God's lightning blast thee! All this evil comes from thee alone,\\" and ran him through with his lance. Additional accounts from Z√ºrich chronicles state that the city was saved by the gatekeeper's wife, one Anna Ziegler, who managed to lower the portcullis of the Rennweg gate just as the pursuing confederates were about to enter the city.

Early years Arthur Farrimond was born to James and Margaret Farrimond at Hill Street in Hindley, Lancashire. He won his first race at the age of seventeen at the Westhoughton town sports in 1910. He joined the Bolton club then Leigh Harriers in 1911. In February 1914, he became a medal winner in the Junior East-Lancashire cross country championships. First World War When the First World War broke out he enlisted in the 9th Royal Scots on 11 November 1914. While serving in France he won the French medallion in a 1¬Ω mile race for his regiment. He reached the front line in January 1915 where he was wounded in the knee; he was again wounded in the stomach in August 1916 as a result of a bayonet charge, and made a full recovery while in Merry Flatts Hospital, Govan, in Glasgow. In March 1915, one of his letters home was published in the local newspaper, speaking of his ordeal in the trenches and also saying he had made up his mind to try to get to Berlin in 1916 for the Olympic Games, but unknown to him, there would be no 1916 Summer Games and he would not resume his training until 1919, too late even for the 1920 Summer Olympics. Post-war athletic career Farrimond married Emily Birch in 1922 and also regained his running fitness after the war and was becoming well known as a distance runner. He was second in the 1923 and 1924 Manchester marathons, and it was from these races that he was selected to run for Britain in the marathon in the 1924 Paris Olympics. Farrimond finished 17th in Paris and had to suffer the last few miles with a twist of his ankle, which he received trying to avoid a civilian who insisted on running alongside him.

It is the sixth film in the Puppet Master franchise and stars George Peck as a scientist, Dr. Magrew, experimenting with transforming humans into puppets, his daughter, Jane, played by Emily Harrison and Robert (Tank) Winsley, played by Josh Green as an orphan commissioned by the scientist to construct a puppet for his experiment. While Puppet Master 5 was intended to be the final installment of the series four years earlier, Curse of the Puppet Master (which borrows quite heavily from the 1973 eco-horror film Sssssss) is a standalone sequel that promptly revived the series, which has been ongoing since. Plot The film begins at The House of Marvels, a doll museum, with Andr√© Toulon's puppets in a cage, watching their current master, a man named Dr. Magrew (George Peck), stuffing something into a crate. Before leaving, he promises the puppets that things will be different next time. He drives into the woods, where he puts down the crate and douses it with gasoline, then sets it on fire. From inside the crate, faint screaming can be heard. The next morning, Dr. Magrew's daughter, Jane (Emily Harrison), has just returned home from college. She asks her father about Matt, his assistant. Her father tells her that Matt left, since his father was ill. He and Jane decide to drive into town to take their minds off things. Robert \\"Tank\\" Winsley (Josh Green), a very tall but meek young man, works at the gas station in town. He passes his time by carving small wooden statues. He is frequently harassed by bully Joey Carp (Michael D. Guerin). Jane and Dr. Magrew arrive and tell Joey to get lost. Jane finds one of the statues that Robert was carving and complements him on it, then shows it to her father. Dr. Magrew introduces himself and Jane to Robert, and offers Robert a job helping him with the Marvel show. Robert accepts and they drive back to the house. Upon arriving, they introduce Robert to Toulon's puppets, which amaze him, since they're alive. At dinner, Magrew reveals that he bought the puppets at an auction years ago, and that he tried to make a living puppet just like Toulons', but has never been successful. He asks Robert if he'll help him carve the puppet, to which he agrees. The next day, during the show, the town sheriff, Sheriff Garvey (Robert Donavan) and Deputy Wayburn (Jason-Shane Scott) arrive. They tell Magrew that Matt is missing, and they wonder if Magrew's seen him since he left. He insists that he has not, but they do not quite believe him. That night, Magrew gives Robert the wood and the blueprints for the puppet. Robert does not understand how the puppet will live. Magrew tells him the way to make a dead thing live is: \\"You put your soul into it\\". Robert begins carving and works non-stop. At dinner a few nights later, Magrew reveals that Matt did carving for him as well. While Matt's work had quality, Robert's work has perfection, which is what he wants to make. He uses Blade as an example: \\"He never tires, never hungers, knows no fear, tells no lies, feels no pain, knows no secrets. And what is man except a being at war with himself? But not Blade. He has no hidden motives, no secret self. He is purely and perfectly what he is. In fact, I think the world would be a better place if we were all like him.\\" That night, Robert wakes up and finds that his legs have turned into carved, wooden legs, like a puppet. But this ends up being a nightmare. While Robert carves the puppet, Jane thinks he is working too hard and while trying to get his attention, causes him to cut himself. She bandages the cut on his hand for him, and asks him about himself. He reveals that he is an orphan, and he has never been smart enough to go to college. Jane tells him that his hands can do things that people with brains only imagine being able to do. They both develop feelings for one another and kiss. Later that night, Robert has another nightmare, but this time, his entire body (minus his head) is wooden, complete with inner clockwork gears. The next day, Jane, thinking that Robert is working too hard, convinces him to take a break. They drive to the woods, and Jane tells him about a beautiful clearing in the woods she found as a little girl. On the way, they stumble upon the half-burnt box that Dr. Magrew burned at the film's beginning. Robert reaches in and pulls out a carved wooden hand, much like a puppet hand. He tries to show it to Jane, but she is walking away. Meanwhile, Joey and his friends are in the woods when Jane arrives. Joey begins to harass her and steps in her way, blocking her. She continuously shoves him to the point where he is angry, and he sexually harasses her. Robert arrives and tells Joey to leave her alone. Joey ignores Robert and threatens to rape Jane. Finally, Robert snaps and throws Joey onto the hood of his car and begins choking him. Jane pulls him off, and they drive back to the house. At the house, Robert confesses that when he was choking Joey, it had nothing to do with him or Jane. He felt like he was choking all the things that ever plagued him in his life. Dr. Magrew tells Robert that he is at war with himself: \\"There's another self inside, a true or more natural self. A creature of violence, with no fear, no conscience. A killer. You spend your whole life battling the self that lives inside. And what happened today, though just for a moment, you lost that battle. The real you, the true you, came out.\\" Robert does not know if he is right or not, but he would \\"rather die than have it come out again.\\" Later that night, Joey comes to the \\"House of Marvels\\" to beat Robert up, but then decides to try to rape Jane again. As Jane sees him and tells him to get out, Pinhead, who was in the room, jumps at Joey and starts choking him, but Joey pulls him off and then starts squashing him with his foot, breaking off his left hand, and breaks his right arm. Dr. Magrew and Tank show up, but Joey makes a run for it. Dr. Magrew, who wants revenge, takes Blade and Tunneler to Joey's house, and sends them to kill him. Joey, who's lifting weights, gets his forehead slashed by Blade, and gets his crotch drilled by Tunneler. Back at the house, Robert shows up at Jane's room and shows her that he fixed Pinhead, Jane thanks Robert, then they start to kiss, she then tells him that he can stay if he likes, then they kiss again. As Dr. Magrew comes back, he sees Robert coming out of Jane's room, and then decides to talk to Jane, and is then surprised when he sees that Pinhead's fixed, but then he starts going crazy when Jane says she loves Robert, and tells her that he does not want to see her get hurt, and then leaves. Five days later, Friday, Jane finds Robert very sick, and then has her father call the doctor, but he really does not, he just fakes it. Then he tells Jane that he has to go pick up a stuffed mermaid oddity for the \\"House of Marvels\\" at the post office at the edge of town, and tricks Jane into offering to picking it up for him, while Dr. Magrew waits for the non-coming doctor to come. Back at Joey's house, the medical examiner (William Knight) believes that Joey's death was intentional. Sheriff Garvey starts to ask one of Joey's friends, named Art (Marc Newburger), when was the last time they saw Joey and who else was there, and he says last Sunday in the woods, and Mr. Magrew's daughter was there. Hearing the name Magrew, Sheriff Garvey and Deputy Wayburn decide to give Dr. Magrew a little visit. But as Garvey and Wayburn arrive at the House of Marvels, Six Shooter throws a rope around Wayburn's neck and Pinhead pulls the rope, causing him to fall and gets his head tunneled by Tunneler, killing him. At the same time, Blade slashes Garvey's leg, making him fall and drop his gun, and then he and Jester start slashing his face, with Magrew laughing as he watches them kill. Meanwhile, at the post office, Jane keeps asking the shipping agent (Patrick Thomas) if he is sure what her father ordered is not there, so the agent calls Tommy Berke (J.R. Bookwalter) to ask him will it come in, but Tommy says that Magrew has not bought anything from him in the past six months. Hearing this, Jane decides to go back to the woods to see what that burned box was. She sees that it's one of Matt's carved puppets, then it starts to speak: \\"Jane!\\" for help in Matt's voice. She then realizes that her father's going to do the same thing to Robert, so she quickly drives back to the House. Meanwhile, at the house, Dr. Magrew puts Robert's soul into the puppet, named Tank, he especially made for Robert via electricity, and it finally works this time, but the puppets are angry because they did not want him to kill Robert, so Blade slashes Magrew's legs, hand, and face, Tunneler drills through his leg, and Pinhead hits him with a metal cane. As Jane arrives at the house, she finds her father nearly dead, bleeding to death, with him pointing at Tank, saying \\"I did it\\". Suddenly, the Tank Puppet starts to move and points its arm at Dr. Magrew. The arm shoots out a bolt of electricity, and electrocutes Dr. Magrew straight between the eyes. The film ends with a shot of Dr. Magrew screaming before death, and Jane screaming in horrified terror.

Gobustan State Reserve is very rich in archeological monuments, the reserve has more than 6,000 rock carvings, which depict people, animals, battle- pieces, ritual dances, bullfights, boats with armed oarsmen, warriors with lances in their hands, camel caravans, pictures of sun and stars, on the average dating back to 5,000-20,000 years. Gobustan State Historical and Cultural Reserve acquired national status in 2006. As a part of the 31st Session of the UNESCO World Legacy Committee held in Christchurch, New Zealand on June 23 - July 2, 2007 included within the World Social Legacy List. Prehistoric carvings The rock carvings and petroglyphs at the site display mesmerizing images of prehistoric life in the Caucasus. The well-preserved sketches display ancient populations travelling on reed boats; men hunting antelope and wild bulls, and women dancing. The famed Norwegian anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl returned many times to Azerbaijan between 1961 and his death in 2002 to study the site in his \\"Search for Odin\\". The language of the ancient population of Gobustan is disputed, but the petroglyphs still give information about the lives of prehistoric people who lived there. More than 4,000 pictures of animals, humans, natural life experiences, hunting, and dancing were carved over a span of thousands of years. Most of the petroglyphs are on large cliffs, divided among multiple ancient residences, and in some cases they have been carved over older images. The first carvings depicted natural human and animal figures, often irregularly, but over time they began to more closely resemble the measurements and proportions of their subjects, including such details as the foot muscles of people in hunting scenes. The heads of the human figures tend to be small and carved without noses, mouths, eyes, or ears. However, experts do not interpret this lack of facial features as an indication that the Gobustan artists lacked technical skill, since some of the carvings demonstrate a higher degree of complexity and detail. Many scenes from tribal life are depicted among the petroglyphs, and images from the Seven Beauties cave suggest that women may have participated in hunting. Gobustan Azerbaijan 01.jpg Gobustan 2.jpg Aserbaidschan 1987 025.jpg Mud volcanoes It's estimated that 300 of the planet's estimated 700 mud volcanoes sit in Gobustan, Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea. Many geologists as well as locals and international mud tourists trek to such places as the Firuz Crater, Gobustan, Salyan and end up happily covered in mud which is thought to have medicinal qualities. Sea water and subterranean gas is what makes these mud volcanoes come alive (36450111543).jpg (L) pal√ßƒ±q vulkanlarƒ±, qobustan 033.JPG (L) Pal√ßƒ±q Vulkanlarƒ±, Qobustan 040.jpg Gobustan mud volcano.jpg  Flora and fauna  The nature of Gobustan is much more suitable than other regions of Azerbaijan. However, the natural conditions of these places were completely different in 20-25 thousand years ago. From the drawings of animals and human figures on the Gobustan, rocks seem to have been under warm climate from 10 to 12 thousand years. People were wearing gentle clothes, men tightened their paws, and women were wearing short leather dresses. Because of the permanent hot weather, greenery and abundant water, these places were the habitats of wild animals: bulls, horses, deer, goats, and other animals lived in Gobustan. From the rock drawings and the archeological findings, wolves, tigers, foxes, jackals and other wild animals have been found in this place in ancient times. In 1968 while cutting off depth stone layer near Atbulakh, accidentally the large bones of an unknown animal were cut off. The workers informed the Ministry of Culture of the Azerbaijan SSR, not knowing what those bones were. After the investigation of the discovered bones, it was determined that these bones were the VI bone of the neck of the southern elephant, which lived in Gobustan. Gaval Dash The Gaval Dash is a natural musical stone which can only be found in Gobustan, Azerbaijan. Among the stone books there are a big flat stone formed out of 3 supports. Suffice it to touch the object with a small stone, musical sounds come from it. The stone is called Gaval Dash, the sound can be compared with a tambourine. The Gaval Dash have been formed due to the combination of unique climate, oil and gas which can be found in the region of Azerbaijan.

Weinbaum, which first appeared in the November 1935 issue of Astounding Stories. Sam Moskowitz has noted that Weinbaum planned to write a series of sequels to \\"The Red Peri\\" but died before he could do so.Introduction by Sam Moskowitz to A Martian Odyssey and Other Science Fiction Tales, Hyperion, 1974, \\"The Red Peri\\" is the only Weinbaum story set on Pluto. The novel also inspired Arthur C. Clarke, who stated that David Bowman's helmetless spacewalk in 2001: A Space Odyssey was inspired by Frank Keene's escape from the pirate base in \\"The Red Peri\\".Arthur C. Clarke, Astounding Days: A Science Fictional Autobiography, Bantam, 1990, . Weinbaum's Pluto \\"The Red Peri\\" was written only five years after the discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh, when the only things known about it were its orbit and the fact that its apparent magnitude was 14.90, too dim to be a gas giant. Given its known distance from the sun, this meant that the higher Pluto's albedo was assumed to be, the smaller it would have to be. Weinbaum assumed that Pluto's surface was as dark as coal, and that its diameter was greater than Earth's, with a correspondingly greater gravity. Weinbaum also assumed that Pluto was airless and had a twenty-hour period of rotation and a surface temperature of 10 kelvins. Despite its harsh conditions, Weinbaum's Pluto includes a number of life-forms, all of them crystalline creatures called crystal crawlers that consume various elements, including aluminum, iron, and carbon. Plot summary Around the year 2080,Approximately a century and a half after the Houston-Westland expedition flew over Mount Everest in 1933. the Dutch spaceship Aardkin out of Venus is approaching Earth when she is boarded by pirates from the notorious spaceship the Red Peri. Passenger Frank Keene, an American radiation engineer and spaceship pilot, sees that one of the pirates has red hair, before that pirate literally tweaks his nose and leaves. A year later, Keene and astrophysicist Solomon Nestor are on board the Limbo, conducting a survey of cosmic radiation in the outer reaches of the Solar System for the Smithsonian Institution. When one of the Limbo's stern jets melts, they are forced to land on Pluto, in the hope of finding some refractory metal to build a new jet. Shortly afterwards, they are captured and taken to the secret lair of the pirates. They meet the Red Peri herself, a nineteen-year-old redhead whose late father built the Red Peri and established the base sixteen years earlier. The Red Peri says she cannot let Keene and Nestor go, but is hesitant to kill them in cold blood. She ponders their fate. One of their guards is a twenty-year-old blonde named Elza. Elza is in love with a fellow pirate named Marco Grandi who, to her dismay, is enamoured with the Red Peri. Keene enlists Elza's aid by promising to help her win Grandi's love. The next morning, Elza tells him that the Red Peri has allowed him the run of the base; he has no access to a spacesuit or the key to his ship. The Red Peri takes him on a tour of the base, ending with a view of a cavern full of oxygen ice. There, Keene rescues his captor from a swarm of \\"crystal crawlers\\". When Keene's toe falls prey to one of them, the Red Peri quickly cuts off the infected area. While treating Keene's toe, the Red Peri reveals that she is the daughter of Perry Maclane, an inventor who was cheated out of his patent by Interplanetary, Inc. Swearing revenge, Maclane built the Red Peri, crewed it with others who had also been wronged by the company, and began preying on its spaceships. When the elder Maclane died three years ago, Peri took his place. Her ultimate plan is to use the money she makes from piracy to start a rival spaceline and put Interplanetary out of business. Meanwhile, Nestor has been plotting with Elza. Her father has been working on the Limbo, so she can get the key. When Nestor tells Keene his plan, Keene is divided. The next morning, after Elza slips him the key, Keene arrives at the base's entrance to find the Red Peri being loaded with supplies. Keene confesses his love for her and tries to persuade her to give up piracy, to no avail. He decides then that he will go along with Nestor's plan. Keene jumps out through the electrostatic field that serves as an airlock, taking a surprised Maclane with him. Carrying her, Keene sprints a thousand feet in the frigid vacuum of Pluto to the Limbo, barely making it to the airlock. He launches the Limbo, then chains the unconscious Maclane to a chair. When she wakes up, he explains that stories of humans exploding in vacuum are a myth--human tissue is strong enough to withstand the body's internal pressure for several minutes. The Red Peri comes alongside the Limbo, but is unable to attack with Maclane on board. Keene falls asleep, and wakes to find Maclane and the Red Peri gone. A note explains that she used an iron- eating crystal crawler to free herself. Keene realizes she braved the vacuum of space by jumping from the Limbo's airlock to the Red Peri. Keene is certain Maclane will set up another base somewhere else in the solar system. He decides to leave government service and get a job on an Interplanetary freighter. Eventually, their paths will cross again. Critical reception Everett F. Bleiler reported that \\"the background is imaginative, but the romance is on the level of the shopgirl pulps, and the writing leaves much to be desired.\\"Everett F.

Described as an \\"upbeat boogie with a strong chorus line\\", the song became popular largely through later interpretations by other artists. Recording and composition Robert Johnson recorded \\"Stop Breakin' Down Blues\\" during his last recording session in 1937 in Dallas, Texas. The song is a solo piece with Johnson providing guitar accompaniment to his vocals. Several songs have been identified as \\"melodic precedents\\": \\"Caught Me Wrong Again\\" (Memphis Minnie, 1936), \\"Stop Hanging Around\\" (Buddy Moss, 1935), and \\"You Got to Move\\" (Memphis Minnie and Joe McCoy, 1934). Of his Dallas recordings, it is Johnson's most uptempo song, with \\"his exhuberant vocal driv[ing] home the story line\\". Two takes of the song were recorded, both sounding very similar, although Johnson flubbed the opening verse of the second take. His record company released both takes on different pressings, with some singles having the first take and others having the second. Although the song is played in a fretted guitar style, on both takes Johnson added a brief slide coda that comes across \\"like a little inside joke\\". In 1970, the second take of the song was included on Johnson's King of the Delta Blues Singers, Vol. II album, making it available for the first time since its initial release. Both takes were later included on the 1990 box set The Complete Recordings. Recordings by blues artists As with most Johnson songs, \\"Stop Breakin' Down Blues\\" failed to generate much interest with the blues record buying public when it was released. However, his work was kept alive by a \\"small circle of Mississippi peers\\" with interpretations recorded by other blues artists. In 1945, Sonny Boy Williamson I recorded his version as an early Chicago blues with Big Maceo (piano), Tampa Red (guitar), and Charles Sanders (drums).RCA Victor 20-3047 Titled \\"Stop Breaking Down\\", the song featured somewhat different lyrics, including the refrain \\"I don't believe you really really love me, I think you just like the way my music sounds\\" in place of Johnson's \\"The stuff I got it gon' bust your brains out, hoo hoo, it'll make you lose your mind\\". Williamson's song inspired the versions sung \\"by most postwar Chicago blues artists\\". In 1954, Baby Boy Warren recorded it as a Chicago-style blues shuffle, but used most of Johnson's lyrics.Drummond Records 3003 Forest City Joe recorded the song in 1959, which was released on a compilation album The Blues Roll On.Atlantic Records SD 1352 In the late 1960s, Junior Wells with Buddy Guy recorded \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" for the Coming at You Baby (1968) and Southside Blues Jam (1969) albums. Their versions are medleys which incorporate lyrics from \\"Five Long Years\\" and Sonny Boy Williamson's \\"Stop Breaking Down\\". The Rolling Stones version The Rolling Stones recorded \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" for their 1972 Exile on Main St. album. They interpreted the song somewhat differently from the earlier versions, with prominent slide guitar work by Mick Taylor and Mick Jagger providing the harmonica and guitar.Of Jagger's guitar part, album recording engineer Andy Johns explained, \\"That's why it's a little choppier\\". Kubernik 2010. The Rolling Stones' only live performance of the song (with Robert Cray on slide guitar and lead vocals) is included on their The Rolling Stones: Voodoo Lounge Live concert DVD. After the release of Exile on Main St., Allen Klein sued the Rolling Stones for breach of settlement because Jagger and Richards had created their version of \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" and composed four other songs on the album while they were under contract with his company, ABKCO. ABKCO acquired publishing rights to the songs, giving it a share of the royalties from Exile on Main St., and was able to publish another album of previously released Rolling Stones songs, More Hot Rocks (Big Hits & Fazed Cookies). Lawsuit over copyright \\"Stop Breakin' Down Blues\\" (along with \\"Love in Vain\\") was the subject of a lawsuit regarding the copyright for the song. In 2000, the court held that the songs were not in the public domain and that legal title belonged to the Estate of Robert Johnson and its successors. Other renditions Lucinda Williams recorded \\"Stop Breakin' Down\\" in 1979 for her first professional release, Ramblin', a blues cover album (which also includes two more Robert Johnson songs, \\"Ramblin' on My Mind\\" and \\"Malted Milk Blues\\"). In 1986, Pussy Galore included the song for their parody of the Rolling Stone's Exile on Main St. The Jeff Healey Band recorded a rendition for Cover to Cover, released in 1995. The White Stripes' 1999 debut album features a version of \\"Stop Breaking Down\\"; a live version recorded by the BBC is included with their 2002 \\"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\\" single. Eric Clapton recorded it along with several other Robert Johnson tunes for his 2004 tribute album, Me and Mr. Johnson. Todd Rundgren also included the song on his 2011 tribute album to Robert Johnson, Todd Rundgren's Johnson. Widespread Panic first performed the song live at the University of New Orleans in October 2000, including a recorded performance on their compilation Live at Myrtle Beach in 2005, and it remains in their song rotation on tour.

Information is representative of a resource which requires effective management and this led to the development of interest in the use of an IA.Ellis et al, 1993, p.134. Prior the 1990s and the methodologies of Orna, Henczel, Wood, Buchanan and Gibb, IA approaches and methodologies focused mainly upon an identification of formal information resources (IR). Later approaches included an organisational analysis and the mapping of the information flow. This gave context to analysis within an organisation's information systems and a holistic view of their IR and as such could contribute to the development of the information systems architecture (ISA). In recent years the IA has been overlooked in favour of the systems development process which can be less expensive than the IA, yet more heavily technically focused, project specific (not holistic) and does not favour the top-down analysis of the IA.Buchanan & Gibb, 2007, p.161.  Definition  A definition for the Information Audit cannot be universally agreed-upon amongst scholars, however the definition offered by ASLIB received positive support from a few notable scholars including Henczel, Orna and Wood; ‚Äú(the IA is a) systematic examination of information use, resources and flows, with a verification by reference to both people and existing documents, in order to establish the extent to which they are contributing to an organisation‚Äôs objectives‚Äù Buchanan & Gibb, 2007, p.159 In summary, the term audit itself implies a counting,Henczel, 2000, p.96. the IA being much the same yet it counts IR and analyses how they are used and how critical they are to the success of a given task.  Role and scope of an IA  In much the same way as the IA is difficult to define, it can be utilised in a range of contexts by the information professional,Wood, 2004, p.6. from complying with freedom of information legislation to identifying any existing gaps, duplications, bottlenecks or other inefficiencies in information flows and to understand how existing channels can be used for knowledge transfer Henczel, 2000, p.92. In 2007 Buchanan and Gibb developed upon their 1998 examination of the IA process by outlining a summary of its main objectives: *To identify an organisation‚Äôs information resource *To identify an organisation‚Äôs information needs Furthermore, Buchanan and Gibb went on to state that the IA also had to meet the following additional objectives: *To identify the cost/benefits of information resources *To identify the opportunities to use the information resources for strategic competitive advantage *To integrate IT investment with strategic business initiatives *To identify information flow and processes *To develop an integrated information strategy and/or policy *To create an awareness of the importance of Information Resource Management (IRM) *To monitor/evaluate conformance to information related standards, legislations, policy and guidelines.  Methodology evolution   Overview  In 1976 Riley first published a definition of IA as a way of analysing IR based on a cost-benefit model. Since Riley, scholars have outlined further developed methodologies. Henderson took a cost-benefit approach hoping to draw focus from manpower-costing to information storage and acquisition which he felt was being overlooked. In 1985 Gillman focused upon identifying the relationships which existed between various components in order to map them to one another. Neither Henderson nor Gillman‚Äôs methods offered alternative approaches beyond the existing organisational frameworks. Quinn took a hybrid-approach combining Gillman and Henderson‚Äôs methods to identify the purpose of existing IR and to position them within the organisation, as did Worlock. The differentiator between Quinn and Worlock lay in Worlock‚Äôs consideration of solutions outside of the current organisational structure. These approaches had thus far had paid little attention to the needs of the user or in making structured recommendations for the development of a corporate information strategy.Ellis et al, 1993, p.137. Therefore, here follows a brief outline and overall comparison of four published strategic approaches in order that one might understand the development of the IA methodology. Burk and Horton In 1988 Burk and Horton developed InfoMap, the first IA methodology developed for widespread use. It aimed to discover, map and evaluate the IR within an organisation using a 4-stage process: *Survey staff using questionnaires/interviews *Measure the IR against cost/value *Analyse resources *Synthesise the findings and map the strengths and weaknesses of the IR against the objectives of the organisation. Although the method inventoried all IR (and therefore met standard ISO 1779) this bottom-up approach revealed limited analysis of the organisation holistically and the steps were not explicit enough.Buchanan & Gibb, 2008, p.4. Paper on methodology selection. Orna Orna produced a top-down methodology in contrast to Burk and Horton, placing emphasis upon the importance of organisational analysis and aimed to assist in the production of a corporate information policy. Initially the method had just 4-stages, this later revised to a 10-stage process which included pre and post-audit stages as below: *Conduct a preliminary review to confirm operational/strategic direction *Gain support/resource from management *Gain commitment from the other stakeholders (staff) *Planning including the project, team, tools and techniques *Identify the IR, information flow and produce a cost/value assessment *Interpret findings based upon current versus desired state *Produce a report to present findings *Implement recommendations *Monitor effects of change *Repeat the IA Orna‚Äôs method introduced the need for a cyclical IA to be put in place in order for the IR to be continually tracked and improvements made regularly. Again this method was criticised for lacking some practical application and in 2004 Orna revised the methodology once more to try to rectify this problem Buchanan and Gibb  In 1998, similarly to Orna's earlier publication, Buchanan and Gibb took a top-down approach, drawing techniques from established management disciplines to provide a framework and a level of familiarity for information professionals. This set of techniques was a notable contribution to IA methodologies and understood the need to be flexible for each organisation. Theirs was a 5-stage process: *Promote benefits of the IA through seminars/surveys/CEO letter for cooperation *Identify the mission objectives of the organisation, define environment (PEST), map information flow and examine organisation culture. *Analyse and formulate action plan for problem areas, flow diagrams and a report of findings and recommendations *Account for cost of IR and related services using Activity Based Costing (ABC) and Output Based Specification (OBS). *Synthesise the whole process in final audit report and provide an information strategy (strategic direction) in relation to the organisation‚Äôs mission statement. This was the introduction of a new approach to costing the IR and had an integrated strategic direction, yet the scholars admitted that this method may be impractical for smaller organisations.Buchanan & Gibb, 1998, p.46. Henczel Henczel‚Äôs methodology drew upon the strengths of Orna and Buchanan and Gibb to produce a 7-stage process:Buchanan & Gibb, 2008, pp.4-5. *Planning and submission of business case for approval to proceed *Data collection and development of an IR database and population through survey techniques *Structured data analysis *Data evaluation, interpretation and formulation of recommendations *Communication of recommendations through a report *Implementing recommendations through a devised programme *The IA as a continuum-establishment of a cyclical process Focus was made once more on the strategic direction of the organisation conducting the IA. Furthermore, Henczel made examination into the use of the IA as a first-step in the development of a knowledge audit or knowledge management strategy Henczel, 2001, p.16. as discussed in the later section. Case studies Scholars and information professionals have since tested the above methodologies with varied results. An early case study produced by Soy and Bustelo in a Spanish financial institution in 1999 aimed to identify the use of information resources for qualitative and quantitative data analysis due to the rapid expansion of the organisation within a six-year period.Soy & Bustelo, 1999, p.30. Part I of the study. Although the methodology was not explicitly credited to any of the above-mentioned scholars, it did follow a strategic (post 1990's) IA process including gaining support from management, the use of questionnaires for data collection, analysis and evaluation of the data, identification and mapping of the IR, cost-analysis and outlining recommendations to assist with the establishment of an Information policy. In addition the IA report suggested that the process would need to be continual (cyclical as Orna, Henczel and Buchanan and Gibb suggest). Conclusions of this case-study stated that the IA allowed a greater understanding of the basis of the organisation's information policy and personnel and identified technical problems within the organisation. In addition this method was believed to be cost and time-effective to the two auditors involved and the organisation used the results of the IA as a marketing tool to promote services users may not have been previously aware of.Soy & Bustelo, 1999, p.61 In 2006 a paper testing the 'viability' of Henczel's methodology was published in the South African Journal of Library and Information Science. The purpose of the study was to determine the financial position of an organisation (Statistics SA) through a report of financial statements made over a period of time. The IA was used as part of the holistic audit process and was limited to just the methodology of Henczel after consideration and dismissal of others.Raliphada & Botha, 2006, p.242. The IA followed the seven-stage process as outlined above (planning, data collection, analysis, evaluation, communicating and implementing recommendations and the IA as a continuum) and the objectives were outlined as identifying the needs of respondents, identifying information sources and their significance, mapping information flow and identifying gaps in available sources. Upon conducting the IA several recommendations were made including making print the preferred format for information and that the library should be responsible for missing information and address this in a development plan. Finally, advantages and disadvantages to this methodology were identified. It was reported that the methodology was flexible in its application as it provided a framework which could be adjusted to suit the needs of an organisation, that the scope could be easily expanded to cover more objectives and that guidelines for data collection and analysis were varied. Secondly it was felt that the methodology was cost-effective as it made use of existing resources (email, workspace etc.). The greatest disadvantage reported was that the process was 'cumbersome' and that the researcher became weary with the repetitive nature of the planning process. In conclusion, the study reported that Henczel's methodology had allowed the information professionals to effectively manage the information management activities of the public sector organisation in question.Raliphada & Botha, 2006, p.248. Positively it had been viewed as cost-effective and depicted a snapshot of the use of information in the organisation, yet it had been a 'cumbersome' process with some repetition within the planning phases. In 2007 Buchanan and Gibb published another examination of the IA to include case studies of their own methodology, an element they had been previously criticised for not including.Buchanan & Gibb, 2008, p.150. In the first case study conducted in a university research department, the objectives were to identify how effective information flow within the department was and what improvement would be required. The methodology was tailored to the study by removing the costing stage and establishing a workgroup to assist at various stages of the process, whilst all other stages remained as per the above (promote, identify, analyse and synthesise). Recommendations were made by the auditor towards greater synergy and systems analysis and it was found that staff immediately recognised the value of this output.Buchanan & Gibb, 2008, pp.151-155. The second case study dealt with a public body within the arts sector with the objectives to streamline evaluation and approval processes and to improve communications between stakeholders. The sponsor also specified that a list of recommendations were required to be incorporated into a change management programme and this aligns well to Buchanan and Gibb's strategic directional method. The IA methodology was scoped to be primarily resource- orientated and once again the costing stage was removed. All else remained as per the original methodology. The IA output recommended that for all organisational processes a shift was needed from process-modelling to capturing process descriptions.Buchanan & Gibb, 2008, pp.155-156. The main strengths identified in Buchanan and Gibb's methodology were its logical structuring of stages, provision of tools, inclusive process for stakeholders, adequate illustration of the role of effective Information Management within an organisation and much like Henczel, the flexibility to tailor the methodology. Their scope matrix was also proven to be useful. A weakness lay still in the limited instructional depth which affected the qualitative data analysis. As regards the applicability of this method, the costing stage was not included in either study and that this might suggest it is not required in an information audit. Further study is required to produce a more conclusive analysis of the methodology.Buchanan & Gibb, 2008, p.160. Methodology comparisons and conclusions The conclusions of the case studies suggested that further development into the methodologies for IA was needed to include further explanation of tools, techniques, templates, interview preparation, process modelling and analysis. In 2008 Buchanan and Gibb drew comparisons from the published IA methodologies of the following scholars: Burk and Horton, Orna, Buchanan and Gibb and Henczel, with the purpose of understanding if a hybrid-methodology could be produced as a ‚Äòbaseline‚Äô from all four. The hybrid-methodology was formed of seven stages and is as below: *Set-up including project plan, communications, endorsements, business case and preliminary analysis *Review strategic (internal and external) analysis and organisational (cultural) analysis *Survey information users, identify IR and map the information flow *Account the cost/business benefits and value of IR *Analyse all findings *Report on the production and dissemination of recommendations *Guide towards development of an organisation‚Äôs information management policy/strategy, establish the IA as a cyclical process, monitor and control. However, Buchanan and Gibb themselves declared that this should not be considered a conclusive comparison as it is high-level \\"and does not assess how well each methodology addresses each stage.\\"Buchanan & Gibb, 2008, p.6. Paper on methodology selection. Development of a knowledge audit In more recent years, since the development of the top-down methodologies, IA have been used as a basis for the development of a knowledge audit, which itself in-turn contributes to an organisation's knowledge management strategy. Once complete, the IA allows examination into where knowledge is produced, where there may be need for further input and where knowledge transfer is required. Furthermore, this analysis develops strategy for knowledge capture, access, storage, dissemination and validation.Henczel, 2000, p.104. Dissimilarly to the IA, the objectives of the knowledge audit are to identify any people-related issues which impact the ways in which knowledge is created, transferred and shared and to identify where knowledge could be captured, where it is required and then determine how best to undertake a knowledge transfer as \\"unlike information, knowledge is bound to a person, organisation or community.\\"Mearns & Du Toit, 2008, p.161 Similarities between the knowledge and information audit methodologies can be noted however, as questionnaires, the development of an inventory, analysis of flow and a data mapBurnett et al, 2004, p.2 are here again used. The importance of this audit therefore is to understand the strategic significance of an organisation's knowledge assets to ensure management is focused to those areas it is specifically required.

His record sales have reached platinum album sales in Zimbabwe and Mozambique for his work with the band Panjea. Chris Berry performing in Vail, CO w/ his band Panjea Chris Berry is an eclectic singer and songwriter, multi-instrumentalist virtuoso, and highly energetic performer and teacher. From his humble beginning during Robert Mugabe's regime in Zimbabwe, he has blasted his powerful Afro-infused sound around the World for over twenty years; rocking audiences from NYC's Irving Plaza to sold out stadiums in South Africa and Sydney, Australia's famous Opera House. He has released over a dozen albums; scored the soundtrack for three films; and has been collaborating and performing with some of the World's best like Eminem, Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann, Senegalese Afro-Pop sensation Yousoou N'dour, Cuban Legends Los Munequitos de Mantanzas, Jazz artist Paul Winter, Jamaican rhythm and production duo Sly (Dunbar) and Robbie (Shakespeare), Fugee's producer Handel Tucker and many more. Chris was born and raised in California where he began his apprenticeship with Master Drummer Titos Sompa (one of the founders of the African drum and dance scene on the West Coast of the U.S.) as a fifteen-year-old boy. This relationship led him into a ten-year journey through Africa. After originally arriving in Congo‚Äôs Brazzaville, his fascination of Zimbabwean mbira music eventually led him to Zimbabwe‚Äôs capital city Harare, where he settled and studied under mbira master Monderek Muchena for ten years. Eight of these years were spent in Zimbabwe during the Mugabe Regime. During this tumultuous political period, Chris found himself living in the ghettos and villages of Zimbabwe where he sought to study the music of the Shona people, adding to his growing repertoire of Traditional African Music. Encouraged by his teachers to create his own compositions, he formed the band Panjea which fused Funk with elements of Hip-Hop, Afro-Pop and traditional African music. The band quickly had No. 1 hits on the radio, toured all over Africa, and reached Platinum Record Sales on an album they recorded with Zimbabwean-based Gramma Records. As Chris Berry and Panjea's popularity rapidly grew, Chris was warned to leave Zimbabwe due to his lyrical opposition to the oppressing government, and instructed to take his music back to his home land, but it wasn't until four of Panjea's band members succumbed to AIDS that Chris left Zimbabwe. From there, Chris has toured extensively around the globe including North and Central America, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Asia and Africa as a frontman and bandleader. He performed the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia; co-wrote for Paul Winter's Grammy Award Winning 2009 \\"Winter Solstice\\" album; taught music and culture as a guest faculty member at Oberlin and Berklee Colleges of Music, University of Colorado Boulder, Williams College, Stanford University as well as his own Panjea Foundation for Cultural Education; and has headlined in major music festivals around the World. In the last few years Chris has collaborated with Steve Kimock, members of the Brazilian Girls, Baaba Maal, Thomas Mapfumo, Oliver Mutukudzi, Manu Dibango, Xavier Rudd, String Cheese Incident and spent six months working and recording with the Central African Republic Pymies to score the soundtrack for the film \\"Oka!\\" Based out of Brooklyn, NY and Hawaii, he is now collaborating with Maverick label Kanaga System Krush with whom he is releasing his newest album, \\"King Of Me\\". On this latest project, Chris breaks through to a whole new level expanding the Mbira's tonal range and electrifying the instrument through a special bass and guitar rig; singing and simultaneously playing bass, rhythm and melodies over Ivorian powerhouse, Abou Diarrassouba on drum set. Chris starts his new tour on June 14, 2013!

St√ºssi's father was elected to offices in Z√ºrich starting in 1388. Rudolf was elected to city offices from 1414. In 1424, he served as Z√ºrich's envoy in the Old Swiss Confederacy. He served as mayor of Z√ºrich from 1430 until his death. In 1433, he traveled to Rome as a representative of Z√ºrich to attend the coronation of Sigismund of Luxembourg. There he was knighted.

He is widely recognized as one of the great danseurs nobles of the twentieth century. Early life and training Born in London, Dowell began his dance training there in 1948, at the age of five. His first ballet teacher was June Hampshire, who nurtured her young pupil and instilled in him the discipline necessary for serious students of ballet. When he was ten years old, he enrolled in the Sadler's Wells Ballet School, then located in Barons Court, and embarked on a course of training for young people interested in pursuing a career in dance. In 1955, the school moved to White Lodge, Richmond Park, and became residential, combining general education and vocational ballet training. In 1956, when a royal charter was granted to the Sadler's Wells Ballet, the school was renamed the Royal Ballet School. Dowell continued his training there, moving to the Barons Court studios for the final three years of his course of study. An outstanding student, blessed with a perfectly proportioned physique and a temperament compatible to the rigours of daily training, he gradually developed a classical technique remarkable for secure control, purity of line, and musical sensitivity. Upon his graduation in 1960, he was immediately taken into the Covent Garden Opera Ballet. After a year dancing with this company, he was invited to join The Royal Ballet. Performing career Among the first to recognize Dowell's potential was the Danish dancer Erik Bruhn. As guest choreographer with the Royal Ballet, he gave Dowell a sparkling solo variation in his 1962 staging of the famous pas de six from August Bournonville's Napoli.Horst Koegler, \\"Dowell, Anthony\\", in The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet, 2nd ed. (Oxford University Press, 1982). Thereafter, Dowell's talent and extraordinary abilities could not be ignored. In 1964, Frederick Ashton, chief choreographer of the company, chose him to create the role of Oberon in The Dream, a balletic retelling of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. With his quicksilver technique and impeccable line, Dowell made the role his own and established himself in the top tier of the company's male dancers. Dancing to Mendelssohn's melodic \\"Nocturne\\" with Antoinette Sibley as Titania, he took the first steps in forming what became a lasting and legendary partnership, as their slender, blond looks and classical purity found a startling echo in each other.Nicholas Drumgoole and Leslie Spatt, Sibley & Dowell (London: Collins, 1976).Barbara Newman, Antoinette Sibley: Reflections of a Ballerina (London: Hutchinson, 1987).Geraldine Morris, \\"Dance Partnerships: Ashton and His Dancers\\", Dance Research (London) 19.1 (Summer 2001), pp. 11‚Äì59. In 1965, Dowell was cast in Ashton's elegant and serene Monotones and then as the boisterous Benvolio in Kenneth MacMillan's historic production of Romeo and Juliet. When Dowell was promoted to principal dancer in 1966, he was already the embodiment of the English classical style: cool, lyrical, aristocratic, and restrained. If the role of Oberon had drawn out a quality of magical glamour from him, the experience of working with Antony Tudor in 1967 on the leading role of Shadowplay considerably deepened his dramatic expression.Debra Craine and Judith Mackrell, \\"Dowell, Anthony\\", in The Oxford Dictionary of Dance (Oxford University Press, 2000). He subsequently created dramatic roles in the ballets of Ashton, MacMillan, and others. Among the most important were Troyte in Ashton's Enigma Variations (1968), Des Grieux in MacMillan's Manon (1974), and Beliaev in Ashton's A Month in the Country (1976).Alexander Bland, The Royal Ballet: The First Fifty Years (London: Threshold Books, 1981). In the classical repertory, he appeared in princely roles in Giselle, Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, and The Nutcracker.John Gruen, \\"Anthony Dowell\\", interview in The Private World of Ballet (New York: Viking, 1975). He undertook more lighthearted roles in La fille mal gard√©e, Card Game, and Varii Capricci, with which, in 1983, Ashton celebrated his continued partnership with Sibley. He was also praised for the passion and musicality he brought to leading roles in Ashton's Cinderella, Daphnis and Chloe, and Symphonic Variations, in MacMillan's Song of the Earth and Romeo and Juliet, in Jerome Robbins's Dances at a Gathering and In the Night, and in George Balanchine's Agon. In the early 1970s, Dowell began to explore activities away from the ballet stage. Trying his hand at costume design, he created stage wear for himself and Sibley in Ashton's Meditation from Tha√Øs and for dancers in MacMillan's Pavane, in Balanchine's Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux and Symphony in C, and in Robbins's In the Night.\\"Sir Anthony Dowell\\", biography, American Ballet Theatre. Retrieved 29 February 2020. He also began to look for opportunities beyond Covent Garden. Between 1978 and 1980, he took leave of absence from the Royal Ballet to dance as guest artist with American Ballet Theatre in New York. There he added Solor in La Bayad√®re and Basilio in Don Quixote to his roster of leading roles. Along with experiencing the challenges of a new repertory, he partnered such bright stars as Natalia Makarova in Swan Lake and Gelsey Kirkland in Romeo and Juliet.Gelsey Kirkland and Greg Lawrence, The Shape of Love (New York: Doubleday, 1990). After his official retirement from the Royal Ballet in 1984, he continued to make occasional dance appearances well into his fifties, creating roles in MacMillan's Winter Dreams in 1991 and in Peter Wright's production of The Nutcracker in 1999.

Administrative career In 1984, Dowell was appointed assistant to Norman Morrice, director of the Royal Ballet. A year later he was made associate director, and in 1986 he was promoted to the post of artistic director of the company. During his tenure, he succeeded in checking declining technical standards among the soloists and the corps de ballet, and he encouraged and nurtured many world-class talents, among them Darcey Bussell, Jonathan Cope, Sylvie Guillem, and Carlos Acosta.Rupert Christiansen, \\"Happy Birthday to Anthony Dowell, a Ballet Marvel\\", The Telegraph (London), 11 February 2013. In 1987, his new production of Swan Lake drew sharp criticism from the press and audiences alike. A number of traditional dance passages, created by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov for their 1885 revival. were cut, much to the displeasure of balletomanes. Additional choreography by Frederick Ashton and Rudolf Nureyev added a certain interest to the development of the story but could not make up for omissions of well-loved dances. Further, radical changes in sets and costume, designed by Yolanda Sonnabend, evoked muttering among viewers. Costumes for acts 1 and 3, set in the opulence of Romanov Russia in the 1890s, were \\"festooned with ribbons and golden squiggles\\" while those for acts 2 and 4 dressed the swans in \\"champagne ball- gowns rather than pristine white feathers\\".Ismene Brown, \\"Will the Real Swan Lake Please Stand Up\\", The Spectator (London), 21 February 2015. Thus, the mysterious beauty of the lake of the swans was lost. Despite these disagreeable features, the production remained in the Royal Ballet repertory for almost three decades. The following season, in 1988, Dowell persuaded Ashton to allow Ondine to be revived after an absence from the repertory of more than twenty years. Maria Almeida was cast as Ondine, the role created in 1958 by Margot Fonteyn, and Dowell shared the stage with her as Palemon, the role originated by Michael Somes. Dowell's next major production of a classic ballet was The Sleeping Beauty, in 1994. Conceived, directed, and produced by him, it starred Viviana Durante as the Princess Aurora and featured Dowell himself in a glittering embodiment of evil as the wicked fairy Carabosse.Mary Clarke, \\"Anthony Dowell's New Sleeping Beauty\\", Dancing Times (London), May 1994, pp. 813, 815‚Äì817. The production was not popular with audiences and was considered a failure, largely owing to the irrational and unattractive designs by Maria Bj√∂rnson. The negative reviews of his Swan Lake and The Sleeping Beauty did not, however, seriously affect Dowell's reputation, as he was held in high regard by all who worked with him.Kate Mosse, The House: Inside the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (London: BBC Books, 1995). In 2001, a gala performance marking his farewell to the Royal Opera House ushered him into retirement in a volley of flowers and nostalgic acclaim.Kathrine Sorley Walker, \\"Letter from Britain\\", Dance International (Vancouver), 29.3 (Fall 2001), pp. 36‚Äì37. At age fifty-eight, he had served fifteen years as director of the Royal Ballet, and British theatregoers paid him well-deserved homage for what he had accomplished in that post as well as for his stage career as one of the most admired and beloved dancers in the company's history.Jann Parry, \\"So Then Hamlet Turned into Calvin Klein\\", The Observer (London), 26 May 2001. Later life After stepping down as artistic director of the company, Dowell staged productions of several works in his repertory, notably The Dream, which he mounted for American Ballet Theatre, Ballet West, the Joffrey Ballet, the Tokyo Ballet, and the Dutch National Ballet. He also appeared as the narrator of Igor Stravinsky's opera-oratorio Oedipus rex at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York and for the Joffrey and Royal Ballet productions of Ashton's A Wedding Bouquet, speaking the verses of Gertrude Stein. He remains active as a guest coach with the Royal Ballet, as a governor of the Royal Ballet School, and as a member of the Royal Academy of Dance and the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing. Honours and awards In 1972, Dowell was presented with the annual Dance Magazine Award for the man whose contributions had made a lasting impact on the dance world.\\"Anthony Dowell and Judith Jamison\\", Dance Magazine (July 1972), pp. 36‚Äì41. In 1973, in recognition of his services to ballet in the United Kingdom, he was named a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours List. He was then the youngest dancer ever to be so honored.\\"Anthony Dowell\\", biography, Royal Opera House. Retrieved 12 October 2015. In 1995, he was the recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award for 1994, the highest honour bestowed by the Royal Academy of Dance, and, capping a lifetime of accolades, he was created a Knight Bachelor, again being named on the Queen's Birthday Honours List of 1995. Upon being knighted by the queen in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace, he was entitled to being addressed as Sir Anthony. In 2002, he was the recipient of the De Valois Award for Outstanding Achievement in Dance, given by the British Critics' Circle at a celebration of the national dance awards for the previous year. Personal life Dowell has always been circumspect about his sexuality, but it is common knowledge that, soon after graduating from the Royal Ballet School in 1960, he began a romantic relationship with Derek Rencher (1932‚Äì2014), a handsome Royal Ballet dancer nine years his senior. They often shared the Covent Garden stage, as Rencher was a powerful and popular character dancer and actor. Some time after that affair ended, Dowell met Jay Jolley, a young American who had starred in London Festival Ballet before being invited to join the Royal Ballet as a principal dancer. Dowell and Jolley formed a more permanent relationship, which has remained solid and steady to the present day. Jolley now serves as assistant director of the Royal Ballet School.\\"Jay Jolley\\", Royal Ballet School. Retrieved 11 October 2015.

Church and rectory St Lawrence, Wyck Rissington In the early 1890s composer Gustav Holst, at the age of 17, was the resident organist for the church. The organ that Holst played is still in use. Until 1984, a liturgical maze existed in the garden of the Rectory. This was built by Canon Harry Cheales, rector of the parish from 1947-1980. Once a year on St Lawrence's Day, 10 August, Canon Cheales would lead the congregation round the maze. Different points of the maze represented different Pilgrim Stations. At each station was a wood carving, twelve of which now decorate the chancel of the church. The design of the maze was such that each point could be visited without turning back. A mosaic plan of the maze is embedded in the wall of the church. The maze was dismantled when the rectory was sold on Canon Cheales' death.

As a result, the mean and the median can be different. Skewness risk can arise in any quantitative model that assumes a symmetric distribution (such as the normal distribution) but is applied to skewed data. Ignoring skewness risk, by assuming that variables are symmetrically distributed when they are not, will cause any model to understate the risk of variables with high skewness. Skewness risk plays an important role in hypothesis testing. The analysis of variance, the most common test used in hypothesis testing, assumes that the data is normally distributed. If the variables tested are not normally distributed because they are too skewed, the test cannot be used. Instead, nonparametric tests can be used, such as the Mann‚ÄìWhitney test for unpaired situation or the sign test for paired situation. Skewness risk and kurtosis risk also have technical implications in calculation of value at risk. If either are ignored, the Value at Risk calculations will be flawed. Beno√Æt Mandelbrot, a French mathematician, extensively researched this issue. He feels that the extensive reliance on the normal distribution for much of the body of modern finance and investment theory is a serious flaw of any related models (including the Black‚ÄìScholes model and CAPM). He explained his views and alternative finance theory in a book: The (Mis)Behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin and Reward. In options markets, the difference in implied volatility at different strike prices represents the market's view of skew, and is called volatility skew. (In pure Black‚ÄìScholes, implied volatility is constant with respect to strike and time to maturity.) Skewness for bonds Bonds have a skewed return. A bond will either pay the full amount on time (very likely to much less likely depending on quality), or less than that. A normal bond does not ever pay more than the \\"good\\" case.

During the First World War, Kellner was an infantryman in a Hessian regiment. After the war he became a political organizer for the Social Democratic Party of Germany, which was the leading political party during the time of the turbulent and short-lived Weimar Republic, Germany's first period of democracy. Kellner and his wife, Pauline, campaigned together as Social Democrats against Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. During World War II, working as a civil servant at a small court house, he wrote a diary to record his observations of the Nazi regime. Based on conversations and attentive reading of newspapers, he described the various crimes of that regime. He titled his work Mein Widerstand, meaning \\"My Opposition\\". After the war Kellner served on denazification boards, and he also helped to reestablish the Social Democratic Party. He gave his diary to his American grandson in 1968 to translate into English and to bring it to the attention of the public. In the epilogue, the author's grandson Robert Scott Kellner tells how the diary came to be published: German publishers were not interested until in 2005 it was reported in Der Spiegel that former US President George H. W. Bush had looked at Kellner's original notebooks in the George Bush Presidential Library at Texas A&M; University. He explained his purpose for writing the diary: :\\"I could not fight the Nazis in the present, as they had the power to still my voice, so I decided to fight them in the future. I would give the coming generations a weapon against any resurgence of such evil. My eyewitness account would record the barbarous acts, and also show the way to stop them.\\" The diary was published in its original language in 2011 and in English in 2018. Biography Family and education Vaihingen an der Enz, Kellner birthplace Kellner was born in Vaihingen an der Enz, a town on the Enz River in southern Germany. At the time of his birth, Vaihingen was part of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in the German Empire. Kellner was the only child of Georg Friedrich Kellner, a baker and confectioner from the town of Arnstadt in Thuringia, and Barbara Wilhelmine Vaigle from Bietigheim-Bissingen near Ludwigsburg. The Kellner family could trace its beginnings to when the Protestant reformer, Martin Luther, lived and preached not far from Arnstadt. The Kellners were Evangelical Lutherans. When Friedrich Kellner was four years old, his family moved to Mainz where his father became the master baker at Goebel's Confectionery (Goebels Zuckerwerk). After completing Volksschule, primary school, Kellner had a nine-year course of non-classical study in the Oberrealschule in Mainz. In 1902 he completed his final exams at Goetheschule, which qualified him for an apprenticeship in courthouse administration. In 1903 he started work as a junior clerk in the Mainz courthouse, remaining there until 1933. He advanced in the administrative ranks to justice secretary, then to court accountant, and in April 1920 to justice inspector. Military service and marriage Friedrich Kellner, 1914 From September 1907 to October 1908 Kellner fulfilled his initial military reserve duty in the 6th Infantry Company of the Leibregiments Gro√üherzogin (3. Gro√üherzoglich Hessisches) Nr. 117 in Mainz. In 1911, he completed an additional two months reserve training. When the First World War began in 1914, Kellner was called up for active duty as a sergeant and deputy-officer in the Prinz Carl Infantry Regiment (4. Gro√üherzoglich Hessisches Regiment) Nr. 118, in Worms. Within the first month of his return to army service, Kellner was in eight engagements in Belgium and France, including fights at Neufch√¢teau, Revigny-Laimont, and Rinarville, associated with what has become known as the Battle of the Frontiers. His regiment also fought at the First Battle of the Marne from 5 to 12 September. Under a prolonged bombardment in the trenches near Reims, he was wounded and was sent to St. Rochus Hospital in Mainz to recover. He spent the remainder of the war as a quartermaster secretary for the 13th Army Corps in Frankfurt am Main. 1908 In 1913, a few months prior to being called up for service in the war, Kellner married Pauline Preuss (19 January 1888 - 8 February 1970), who was from Mainz. Their son, Karl Friedrich Wilhelm (a.k.a. Fred William), their only child, was born in Mainz on 29 February 1916. Political activism Inspector Kellner, 1923. Kellner welcomed the birth of German democracy after the war. In 1919 he became a political organizer for the Mainz branch of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, the (SPD). Throughout the 1920s and into the 1930s, he spoke out against the danger posed to the fragile democracy by the extremists in the Communist Party and the Nazi Party. At rallies near the Gutenberg Museum, which honored Johannes Gutenberg, the founder of the printing press, Kellner would hold above his head Adolf Hitler's book, Mein Kampf, and yell out to the crowd: \\"Gutenberg, your printing press has been violated by this evil book.\\" He would often be accosted by brown-shirted thugs from the Nazi Party, known as Storm Troopers. Two weeks before Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor in January 1933, and before the beginning of Hitler's murderous purge of his political opponents, Kellner and his family moved to the village of Laubach in Hesse, where he worked as the chief justice inspector in the district court. In 1935 his son immigrated to the United States in order to avoid service in the Wehrmacht, Hitler's army. During the November pogrom of 1938, known as Kristallnacht (\\"Night of the Broken Glass\\"), Friedrich and Pauline Kellner tried to stop the rioting. When Kellner approached the presiding judge to bring charges against the leaders of the riot, Judge Schmitt instead opened an investigation into the Kellners' religious heritage. The Kellner family documents, which included baptismal records dating back three hundred years, proved Kellner and his wife were Christians. On 18 November 1938 the district judge in Darmstadt closed the case in Kellner's favor: \\"Doubts about the Kellner bloodlines cannot be validated.\\" A finding to the contrary could have meant imprisonment and death. The war years A page from the diary From his reading of Mein Kampf, Kellner believed the election of Adolf Hitler would mean another war in Europe, and events soon were to support his view. Within a few years after coming to power, Hitler abrogated the Treaty of Versailles, re-militarized the Rhineland, expanded the German military forces, and spent great sums to outfit those forces with modern weaponry. Although the leaders in the democracies were concerned about such rearmament, they failed to take action to stop it. On 1 September 1939, in coordination with the Soviet Union, Hitler ordered the German armed forces to invade Poland. It was on this day that Friedrich Kellner began to record his observations in a secret diary that he entitled Mein Widerstand, \\"My Opposition\\". He wanted the coming generations to know how easily young democracies could turn into dictatorships, and how people were too willing to believe propaganda rather than resist tyranny and terrorism. Kellner did not confine himself to the diary. He continued to express his views, and in February 1940 he was summoned to the district court in Giessen where he was warned by the president of the court, Hermann Colnot, to moderate his views. A few months later he was summoned to the mayor's office in Laubach where he was warned by the mayor and the local Nazi Party leader that he and his wife would be sent to a concentration camp if he continued to be a \\"bad influence\\" on the population of Laubach.Regierungspr√§sident in Darmstadt, I/1pe2-3w02, Reg. Nr. D/34613/85(J)/Ke, 19 Juli 1966 A report written by the district Nazi leader, Hermann Engst, shows that authorities were planning to punish Kellner at the conclusion of the war.Hogen-Ostlender, Klemens. , Gie√üener Anzeiger, 2005-08-20 Throughout the first two years of the war, Kellner looked to America to provide support for England and France. Numerous entries in the diary reveal Kellner's belief that Germany had no chance to win if America would put aside its neutrality and do more than just send supplies to England. When Germany declared war on America in 1941, the diary entries show Kellner's impatience for the Allies to mount an effective invasion of the continent, and to bring the fight to the Germans on their own territory. When the invasion of Normandy took place on 6 June 1944, Kellner inscribed in large letters in the entry of that date: \\"Endlich!,\\" meaning \\"Finally!\\" Kellner rarely wrote about his personal situation. He wrote primarily about Nazi policies and propaganda, and about the war. He noted the injustices in the court system, and recorded the inhumane deeds and genocidal intentions of the Nazis. In all of this he considered the German people as accomplices before and after the fact: first voting Hitler into power, and then acquiescing in his abuse of that power. Part of the 28 October 1941 entry. S√ºtterlin script transcribed to modern German and translated into English. One of the most important historical entries in the diary was written on 28 October 1941. Most Germans after the war would insist they knew nothing at all about the state- sponsored genocide of the Jews,Robert Gellately: Backing Hitler. Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany, Oxford University Press, 2001 - Review by Simon Miller yet very early in the war Kellner recorded this in his diary, showing that word of atrocities reached the average citizens even in the small towns: :A soldier on vacation here said he was an eyewitness to terrible atrocities in the occupied parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish men and women were placed in front of a long deep trench and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians in the back of their heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. :These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. :There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. George Bush Presidential Library and Museum, Friedrich Kellner exhibit. Retrieved 2007-05-14 After the war Robert Scott Kellner, who translated the diary into English, in 1960. The war came to an end for Kellner on 29 March 1945, when the Americans marched into Laubach. Only a few days earlier, beginning on 23 March 1945, in a series of coordinated events between the British and American forces, the Allies had crossed the Rhine River in their invasion of the German homeland. With the approval of the occupation forces, the new mayor of Laubach appointed Kellner deputy mayor. Kellner aided in the denazification process, which primarily meant removing former Nazis from positions of power in the region. Kellner helped to resurrect the Social Democratic Party in Laubach, and he became the regional party chairman. Kellner wrote only a few more entries in the diary. In one of the last entries, on 8 May 1945, the day Germany officially surrendered to the Allies, Kellner noted: :\\"If now, after the collapse, should any of these lackeys of Adolf Hitler have the insolence to claim they were merely harmless onlookers, let them feel the scourge of avenging mankind .... Whoever cries about having lost the Nazi system or wants to resurrect National Socialism is to be treated as a lunatic.\\" Kellner served as chief justice inspector and administrator of the Laubach courthouse until 1948. He was appointed district auditor in the regional court in Giessen until his retirement in 1950. For the next three years he was a legal advisor in Laubach. In 1956 he returned to politics and was Laubach's leading councilor and deputy mayor until he retired in 1960 at age 75. On 19 July 1966 Kellner received compensation from the Federal Republic of Germany because of the injustices committed against him during the time of National Socialism. The compensation ruling included this statement: :\\"Kellner's political opposition was recognized by the ruling powers and they took measures against him. In a memorandum dated 23 June 1937, they noted that Kellner had not been active enough for the National Socialist movement, and that he has caused disturbances with the local party. Further, the incidents in the year 1940 (the threatened incarceration in a concentration camp) had really an unfavorable effect. It was Kellner's open opposition to National Socialism which prevented possible promotions and damaged him in his service.\\" Kellner grave, Mainz Kellner and his wife arranged to have their son, Fred William Kellner, sent to the United States in 1935 out of concern he might otherwise have to fight for Hitler. Fred William returned to Germany in 1945 as a member of the U.S. Army. He was unable to cope with the devastation he witnessed, and in 1953 he took his own life. German He is buried in the American Legion Tomb in Neuilly, France, on the outskirts of Paris. Fred's son, Robert Scott Kellner, grew up in a children's home in Connecticut. In 1960, while in the United States Navy and traveling through Germany, Robert Scott Kellner located his grandparents, Friedrich and Pauline Kellner, and learned of the existence of the diary. In 1968 Friedrich Kellner gave his diary to his American grandson to translate and bring to the attention of the public. He believed his observations during World War II could have meaning in the increasing hostilities in the world brought about by the Cold War with Communism, and the proliferation of neo-Nazi cults. Decades later, Robert Scott Kellner would use the diary to combat the resurgence of fascism and anti-Semitism in the twenty-first century, and to counter historical revisionists who would deny the Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities. He offered a copy of the diary to the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has referred to the Holocaust as \\"a myth\\" and has called for Israel to be \\"wiped off the map.\\"\\"International condemnation has greeted comments by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that the Nazi Holocaust was 'a myth'.\\" \\"Holocaust comments spark outrage\\", BBC News, December 14, 2005. In his offer to Ahmadinejad, Kellner said: \\"We need to renounce ideologies that do not uphold, above all else, human life and personal liberty.\\" Friedrich and Pauline Kellner spent their last few years in Mainz, where Kellner had first begun his service as a law administrator and a political activist. He served as a volunteer legal advisor in Mainz from 1962 until 1969. After Pauline's death on 8 February 1970, Friedrich returned to Laubach for the remaining few months of his life. He died on 4 November 1970 in the regional hospital in Lich, not far from Laubach. He was buried at the side of his wife in the Main Cemetery, Hauptfriedhof, in Mainz. Works Diary Volumes of the Friedrich Kellner Diary. My Opposition consists of 10 volumes with a total of 861 pages. The volumes are sheets of accounting paper bound together by string. There are 676 individually dated entries beginning in September 1939 through May 1945. More than 500 newspaper clippings are pasted onto the pages of the diary. The diary is written in a script called S√ºtterlin, the old German handwriting which was banned in 1941 and replaced by modern Latin lettering to make German easier for the conquered nations of Europe to read and understand. There are separate pages written in 1938 and 1939, considered preliminary pages to the diary, that explain Kellner's intentions. He meant for his observations to detail the events of those years, and to offer a prescription for future generations to prevent what occurred in Germany during Adolf Hitler's rise to power, when a fledgling democracy willingly embraced dictatorship to solve political disputes. Kellner foresaw Germany's defeat, and warned against a recurrence of totalitarianism. He prescribed unrelenting resistance against any ideology that threatened personal liberty and ignored the sanctity of human life. The complete diary was published by in G√∂ttingen, Germany, in 2011. It consists of two volumes, approximately 1,200 pages, with over 70 illustrations and photographs. The title is \\"Friedrich Kellner, 'Vernebelt, verdunkelt sind alle Hirne,' Tageb√ºcher 1939-1945.\\" The English translation of the diary was published in January 2018 by Cambridge University Press. Translated and edited by Robert Scott Kellner, it is a single volume hardback of 520 pages with 53 illustrations and photographs. The title is \\"My Opposition: The Diary of Friedrich Kellner -- A German against the Third Reich.\\" Reception of the diary The diary's first public appearance was at the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum, where it was on display to commemorate the 60th anniversary of VE Day, the end of the war in Europe.George Bush Presidential Library and Museum, Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

The blue one is twisted to demonstrate how they are used. A twist tie is a fastener made of one or more metal wires encased in a thin strip of paper or plastic, in such a way that it can bend and retain its shape. It is used to tie the openings of containers including bags, such as garbage bags or bread bags. It is also called garden twist wire. A twist tie is used by wrapping it around the item to be fastened, then twisting the ends together. They are often included with boxes of plastic food bags or trash bags, and are commonly available individually in pre-cut lengths, on large spools, or in perforated sheets called gangs. The outer covering can be in a variety of colors with or without printing. Plain paper, metallic paper, plastic, poly, or custom coatings are popular for different applications. The plastic, poly, or metallic paper twist ties withstand water better than the uncoated paper versions. Different sizes and strengths are used for different applications, from a small closure for a bag of bread to a large, heavy tie to hold unwieldy garden hoses in place.

Many writings such as criticisms, reviews, reaction papers, editorials, proposals, advertisements, and brochures use different ways of persuasion to influence readers. Persuasive writing can also be used in indoctrination. It is a form of non-fiction writing the writer uses to develop logical arguments, making use of carefully chosen words and phrases. But, it's believed that fiction writing should also be persuasive. Common techniques in persuasive writing Presenting strong evidence, such as facts and statistics, statements of expert authorities and research findings, establishes credibility and authenticity. Readers will more likely be convinced to side with the writer's position or agree with their opinion if it is backed up by verifiable evidence. Concrete, relevant, and reasonable examples or anecdotes can enhance the writer's idea or opinion. They can be based on observations or from the writer's personal experience. Accurate, current and balanced information adds to the credibility of persuasive writing. The writer does not only present evidence that favor their ideas, but they also acknowledge some evidence that opposes their own. In the writing, though, their ideas would be sounder. Ethos, logos, and pathos There are three aesthetic features to persuasive writing. Ethos is the appeal to credibility. It convinces the audience of the credibility of the writer. The writer's expertise on their subject matter lends to such credibility. The level of education and profession of the writer also come into play. Logos is the appeal to logic and reason. It is the most commonly accepted mode in persuasion because it aims to be scientific in its approach to argumentation. In writing, facts are presented in a logical manner, and faulty logic is avoided. Pathos is the appeal to emotion. This aims to convince the audience by appealing to human emotions. Emotions such as sympathy, anger, and sadness motivate humans; using pathos will then get the audience to be emotionally invested in the subject of the writing.

The term Kadyrovtsy is commonly used in Chechnya to refer to any armed Chechen men under the control of President Ramzan Kadyrov. The Kadyrovtsy originated in 1994 as a Chechen separatist militia under Akhmad Kadyrov, and fought against the Russian Armed Forces for the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in the First Chechen War. Kadyrov defected to the Russian side in the Second Chechen War in 1999, and the Kadyrovtsy began fighting separatists and jihadists during the \\"Guerilla phase\\" as a de facto unit of the state police after he was appointed Chechen President in July 2000. Kadyrov was assassinated in 2004, and control of the militia was inherited by his son, Ramzan Kadyrov. In 2006, the Kadyrovtsy were legalized as a motorized regiment of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and when Kadyrov was elected Chechen President in 2007 its current official role as a personal protective service was established. The Kadyrovtsy has been criticized of being Ramzan Kadyrov's private army, and is accused of committing widespread human rights abuses such as kidnapping, forced disappearances, torture and murder. Critics claim the Kadyrovtsy use extrajudicial punishment to cement Kadyrov's autocratic rule, and now surpass jihadist insurgents as the most feared organization among Chechnya's civilian population.Unofficial Places of Detention in the Chechen Republic History Militia Akhmad Kadyrov, a supporter of Dzhokhar Dudayev, began the formation of a personal militia following the outbreak of the First Chechen War in 1994, shortly after the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria declared its official independence from the Russian Federation. The militia, nicknamed the Kadyrovtsy after him, consisted of thousands of armed ethnic Chechen men devoted to the Chechen separatist cause, and participated in fighting against the Russian Armed Forces sent to restore sovereignty over Chechnya. Kadyrov distinguished himself as a militia leader, rising to prominence in the independent Chechen government under Dudayev, and was appointed Chief Mufti in 1995. Dudayev was killed in April 1996, shortly before the Chechen separatist victory in August following the Khasav-Yurt Accord and Russia‚ÄìChechen Peace Treaty. Chechnya's economy and administration had begun to break down largely due to early failed policies enacted by Dudayev and was worsened rapidly by the devastation of the war. The nationalist and secular government almost immediately came under the increasing control of Islamists and warlords. From 1997, the President Aslan Maskhadov replaced the secular Chechen government with an Islamic government based on sharia law and declared Chechnya an Islamic republic. Kadyrov was a powerful official in independent Chechnya and the Kadyrovtsy were maintained for his own interests, however, he was an opponent of the Wahhabism which the increasingly influential foreign jihadist fighters of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya adhered to. Kadyrov abandoned the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria shortly after the outbreak of the Second Chechen War in August 1999, when the country was invaded by Russian federal troops in response to the Dagestan War, and his offer to defect was accepted by the Russian government. The Kadyrovtsy, composed mostly of separatist veterans of the first war, were now fighting for Russia against Maskhadov government troops and Islamist insurgents. The return of Russian rule over Chechnya was declared in July 2000, beginning the \\"Guerilla phase\\", and Kadyrov was appointed acting President of the Chechen Republic by Russian President Vladimir Putin until he was elected President of the Chechen Republic on 5 October 2003. The Kadyrovtsy acted as bodyguards for Kadyrov, who experience several assassination attempts, with security detail headed by Movladi Baisarov. Technically still a personal militia, it functioned as an unofficial part of the Chechen Republic's state police without any legal status in either the republican or federal government. In May 2003, the Kadyrovs established effective control over the Chechen OMON, then estimated at 300 men, earlier considered one of the strongholds of the anti-Kadyrov opposition in the power structures led by Musa Gazimagomadov, who died in a road accident under \\"strange circumstances\\". The Kadyrovtsy OMON was now run by Ruslan Alkhanov, who had been a rebel commander amnestied just a year before, and later became the Chechnya's Interior Minister.KADYROV TAKES OVER SPECIAL-POLICE UNIT In October 2003, Akhmad Kadyrov became the President of the Chechen Republic; by this time his Security Service (SB) was already the largest security body consisting of the Chechens, numbering 3,000 according to Kadyrov himself. According to the next President Alu Alkhanov, in 2005 this figure has grown up to 7,000 armed men. Legalization Kadyrov was killed on 9 May 2004 in the 2004 Grozny stadium bombing, in what is considered to be a deliberate assassination. Control of the Kadyrovtsy was inherited by his son, Ramzan Kadyrov, who was already the second-in-command of the militia. At this point, the backbone of the militia was still made up of former separatist fighters (more than 70% in 2004 according to the Russian military sources), and allegiance to their new leader was questioned. Many of them continued as members of the Kadyrovtsy under Ramzan due to the pressure upon the welfare of their relatives, as coercion was commonly used in Chechnya to demand compliance. The practice of hostage taking, in particular, was widespread and affected many in the country, including the former rebel Minister of Defence Magomed Khambiyev.New Chechen Army Threatens Moscow Shortly after Akhmad Kadyrov's death, the unit of the Kadyrovtsy responsible for his protection was formally liquidated, and most of the remaining units were integrated into the system of Russian law enforcement agencies and security authorities in Chechnya under the Ministry of Internal Affairs. By 2005, two units were formed: the \\"Akhmad Kadyrov\\" Second Road Patrol Regiment of the Police (PPSM-2, Kadyrov Regiment), and the Oil Regiment Neftepolk headed by the Kadyrov's cousin Adam Delimkhanov, comprising around 1,500 to 2,000 men, respectively.Eurasian Secret Services Daily Review By 2006, the total strength of the Kadyrovtsy, which by then included the PPSM-2, the Oil Regiment, and so-called Anti-Terrorist Centers (commanded by Muslim Ilyasov), was not disclosed. Memorial's estimations spoke of around 5,000 people, and in 2007 a similar estimation was made by Reuters. On April 29, 2006, Ramzan Kadyrov officially disbanded his security service, saying on television that \\"These structures are no longer existent, and those calling themselves Kadyrovites are impostors and must be punished in accordance with the law.\\" Some of the Kadyrovtsy gunmen were completely legalized into the Chechen government's power structures, while others, estimated at least 1,800, continued to exist in the semi-legal form of paramilitary formations. The ATCs were quickly closed down and some of the members were transferred to newly formed battalions: Sever (North, led by Muslim Ilyasov and composed of an estimated 500 men) and Yug (South, led by Alimbek Delimkhanov and composed of an estimated 700 men).Unofficial Places of Detention in the Chechen Republic The Kadyrovtsy were rearmed and given heavy equipment, such as armoured personnel carriers they previously did not possess. Observers have considered the open existence of the Kadyrovtsy, and the reason for its legalization by the Russian government as a law enforcement unit, to be so that the presence of federal troops in Chechnya can be decreased and redeployed to the neighboring state of Dagestan where the majority of Islamist insurgency continued. In 2007, Ramzan Kadyrov became the new President of the Chechen Republic and is now controlling all of the Chechen Interior Ministry forces, with the top seats of his government occupied by the former commanders of the Kadyrovtsy. Criticism Human rights violations A significant number of members of these groups are people with a criminal past, including people who had committed criminal offences in the period between wars. Particularly feared are the PPSM-2, named after Akhmad Kadyrov, and the Oil Regiment. Officially PPSM-2 is responsible for security on the streets and the Oil Regiment for the security of industrial sites. In reality, both structures are involved in so-called \\"anti-terrorist operations,\\" according to human rights groups accompanied by grave human rights violations.RIGHTS ACTIVISTS: KADYROVTSY ARE CHECHNYA'S MAIN PROBLEM Human rights activists working in Chechnya have said the group has been heavily involved in kidnapping, torture and murder to cement Kadyrov's clan rule. In October 2006 German human rights group the Society for Threatened Peoples (GfbV), which branded Kadyrov a \\"war criminal\\", has alleged that up to 75 percent of recent incidents of murder, torture, rape and kidnapping in Chechnya have been committed by Ramzan's paramilitary forces.Police tried to silence GfbV - Critical banner against Putin¬¥s Chechnya policies wars The Memorial group investigator stated in its report: \\"Considering the evidence we have gathered, we have no doubt that most of the crimes which are being committed now in Chechnya are the work of Kadyrov's men. There is also no doubt in our minds that Kadyrov has personally taken part in beating and torturing people. What they are doing is pure lawlessness. To make matters worse, they also go after people who are innocent, whose names were given by someone being tortured to death. He and his henchmen spread fear and terror in Chechnya. (...) They travel by night as death squads, kidnapping civilians, who are then locked in a torture chamber, raped and murdered,\\".The Jamestown Foundation Anna Politkovskaya, a veteran Russian reporter (murdered in 2006; case unsolved as of April 2008) who specialized in Chechen reporting, claimed that she had received a video footage of a man identical in appearance to Ramzan. \\"....On them (the clips) were the murders of federal servicemen by the Kadyrovtsy, and also kidnappings directed by Kadyrov. These are very serious things; on the basis of this evidence a criminal case and investigation should follow. This could allow this person to be brought to justice, something he has long richly deserved,\\" she said. She was allegedly working on an article revealing human rights abuses and regular incidences of torture in Chechnya at the time of her murder.The Jamestown Foundation Some observers alleged that Kadyrov or his men were possibly behind the assassination.Yuri Felshtinsky and Vladimir Pribylovsky The Age of Assassins. The Rise and Rise of Vladimir Putin, Gibson Square Books, London, 2008, ; pages 248-250 The Kadyrovtsy are often accused of working as a death squad against Kadyrov's enemies. Ramzan is rumoured to own a private prison in his stronghold of Tsentoroi, his home village south- east of Grozny. Fields around Tsentoroi are reportedly mined and all access routes are blocked by checkpoints. On May 2, 2006, representatives of the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) stated that they were prevented from entering the fortress.Politkovskaya, Anna (2007) A Russian Diary: A Journalist's Final Account of Life, Corruption, and Death in Putin's Russia They have also begun using cell phones to record videos of them beating and humiliating ordinary Chechens accused of crimes. The videos are later circulated, with the intention of intimidating civilians.Chechnya: Cell- Phone Videos Reveal Abuses - RADIO FREE EUROPE / RADIO LIBERTY According to the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights Unofficial Places of Detention in the Chechen Republic\\" report, many illegal places of detention exist in the Chechen Republic; most of them are run by Kadyrovites. In Tsentoroi (Khosi-Yurt), where the Kadyrovite headquarters is located, there are at least two illegal prisons functioning. One consists of concrete bunkers or pillboxes, where kidnapped relatives of armed Chechen fighters are held hostages while the second prison in Tsentoroi is evidently located in the yard‚Äîor in immediate vicinity‚Äîof the house of Ramzan Kadyrov. On November 13, 2006, Human Rights Watch published a briefing paper on torture in Chechnya that it had prepared for the 37th session of the United Nations Committee Against Torture. The paper covered torture by personnel of the Second Operational Investigative Bureau (ORB-2), torture by units under the effective command of Ramzan Kadyrov, torture in secret detentions, and the continuing \\"disappearances.\\" According to HRW, torture \\"in both official and secret detention facilities is widespread and systematic in Chechnya.\\" In many cases, the perpetrators were so confident that there would be no consequences for their abuses that they did not even attempt to conceal their identity. Based on extensive research, HRW concluded in 2005 that forced disappearances in Chechnya are so widespread and systematic that they constitute crimes against humanity. On March 1, 2007, Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the head of the Moscow Helsinki Group rights organisation, stated \\"Kadyrov is to blame for kidnappings of many innocent people. Their bodies were found later with signs of torture.\\" Corruption The Kadyrovtsy were accused of a mass kidnappings (occasionally, even members of the Russian security forces have been kidnapped), tortures and summary executions, rapes, racketeering, participation in the illegal oil trade and other crimes even by Chechen and Russian officials. In October 2003, the former Chechen official and presidential candidate Shamil Burayev, accused the Security Service of \\"hunting for the dissidents\\". In May 2004, Russian Presidential adviser Aslambek Aslakhanov acknowledged that the \\"security guard of the Kadyrovs\\" was operating outside of the law. In June 2005, Beslan Gantamirov, the former Chechen Prime Minister, accused the SB of \\"abductions and murder even of the FSB employees\\" and \\"gansterism in the territory of all the North Caucasus\\". In April 2006, Mikhail Babich, another former Prime Minister of Chechnya and then Deputy Chairman of the Committee of the Russian State Duma on Defense, called the armed formations of Kadyrov \\"an absolutely illegal structure\\". In May 2007, more than 100 members of the United Kingdom's political and cultural elite have appealed to President Vladimir Putin of Russia to restore \\"peace and justice\\" to Chechnya, calling Kadyrov's presidency \\"little more than a regime of fear and oppression\\". Extrajudicial punishment In 2006, a video leaked out in which armed men loyal to Ramzan Kadyrov displayed the severed head of a Chechen guerrilla who was killed in July 2006, separated from his body for public display in the village of Kurchaloi, marking the brutality of the Kadyrovtsy. They mounted the head on a pipe, together with blood-stained trousers, and put a cigarette on him. It was displayed for at least a day as they came back a day later to record it again. According to human rights group Memorial as well as Anna Politkovskaya, the Deputy Prime Minister of Chechnya Idris Gaibov had orchestrated the atrocities by Kadyrovites in the outskirts of the Chechen village in the Kurchaloy on July 27‚Äì28, 2006. Reportedly, he hung the severed head of a killed rebel fighter up as a warning to the rest of the village. As a Chechen state official, he had given orders to members of the Russian security forces who were not subordinate to him to decapitate a dead body. Armed men then spent the next two hours photographing the head of with their mobile phones; the head remained there for 24 hours.MEMORIAL DESCRIBES ‚ÄúMEDIEVAL‚Äù JUSTICE IN CHECHNYA On September 21, 2005 a similar incident occurred, as published by Memorial as well as Kavkazky Uzel which described \\"shocking details\\" of a special operation conducted by forces loyal to Ramzan Kadyrov earlier in September in the town of Argun and the settlement of Tsotsin-Yurt. Citing local residents, the human rights group reported that on September 14, a group of kadyrovtsy placed a severed head on a pipe on a footbridge across the Khulkulau River for \\"general viewing\\" and intimidation purposes.DECAPITATION AS A METHOD OF INTIMIDATION In 2005 unidentified men kidnapped separatist field commander Dokka Umarov's father Khamad, his wife, and one-year-old son. Several months previous, his brother Ruslan Umarov, father of four children, had also been kidnapped by masked men in uniform. His wife and son were later freed, but his father and brothers disappeared. According to some sources, Umarov's father, Khamad Umarov, was kidnapped back on May 5, 2008, by the Kadyrovite employees of the Oil Regiment (Neftepolk) headed by Chechnya's First Deputy Prime Minister Adam Delimkhanov. In April 2007 Umarov declared his 74-year-old father was murdered in captivity.Ojciec przyw√≥dcy czecze≈Ñskiego powstania zamordowanyDoku Umarov's father killed in Chechnya His sister Natalia Khumaidova was also abducted in Urus-Martan in August 2005 by \\"unidentified armed men\\";Umarov's Sister Is Abducted she was released days later after local residents protested for her return. In the past years a cousin Zaurbek and nephew Roman Atayev were also kidnapped; nothing has been heard of these people since. Shortly after the Beslan hostage-taking raid in 2004, Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov suggested the practice of taking rebel leaders' relatives hostage. Memorial, who largely condemned such practices, blamed pro- Russian Chechen forces for the abductions. According to separatists, all the kidnapped persons were put into Ramzan Kadyrov's personal prison in Tsentaroy. Notable incidents Kadyrov-Alkhanov conflict On April 28, 2006, security forces loyal to Ramzan Kadyrov fought a fist and then gun battle with the bodyguards of then the pro-Russian president Alu Alkhanov. Up to two men were reportedly killed and four injured in the clash at the presidential administration, sparking fears of a broader power struggle between the groups of Chechen men who control the republic in support of the Russian authorities. The exchange of fire happened during a meeting between Alkhanov and a federal official, Sergei Stepashin. The Moskovskij Komsomolets newspaper reported that Alkhanov had banned Kadyrov from bringing more than two men of his private army with him into meetings; it reported that Kadyrov had rung Alkhanov and given him 30 minutes to flee the presidential administration as his men wanted to storm it. The official explanation of the whole incident was that \\"an ordinary quarrel\\" had occurred between two men who worked in the security services, and that no shots whatsoever were ever fired. It was the next day that reports came out how Ramzan Kadyrov officially disbanded his security service. On June 4, 2006, President Alu Alkhanov said he would prefer his republic be governed by Sharia law and suggested adapting the Islamic code, as it is championed by Kadyrov; he also dismissed reports of conflicts with Ramzan.The Increasingly Deadly Struggle for Power between Kadyrov and Alkhanov People in Chechnya long ago started talking about the Kadyrov-Alkhanov struggle that already included armed confrontation, murders, and hostage- taking; many of these incidents are provoked by Kadyrov's men. In February 2005, for example, two of Alkhanov's men were killed and three civilians were injured during an attack in the Kurchaloev region of the republic, which was essentially in Kadyrov's personal domain; the ITAR-TASS attributed the killing to \\"members of one of the republic's security services currently involved in anti-terrorist operations\\". In the other incident, members of an OMON unit based at the Grozny railway station exchanged fire with and then jailed a group of Kadyrovites. This incident outraged Kadyrov, who ordered his men to shoot to kill anyone who stood in their way and reportedly called Alkhanov to warn him that there would be a \\"war\\" if his men were further provoked. Both sides called for reinforcements and there was further shooting before the situation was defused. Murder of Abdul Halim Sadulayev On 17 June 2006, a group of the Kadyrovtsy and FSB officers killed the President of Ichkeria, Abdul Halim Sadulayev (also known as Sheikh Abdul-Halim), whose body was driven to Tsentoroy and presented to Ramzan Kadyrov. According to the FSB chief Nikolai Patrushev, two members of the federal forces were killed and five were wounded in a firefight in which Sadulayev and his bodyguard were killed, and two other rebels escaped. In August 2006, rebel commander Isa Muskiev said the federals and the kadyrovtsy lost five men killed in the shootout, one of them shot by Sadulayev personally, and three fighters escaped. The killing of Sheikh Abdul Halim was trumpeted by leaders of the Russian-backed official government of the province, claiming that the separatist forces there had been dealt a \\"decapitating\\" blow \\"from which they will never recover.\\" The next day, June 18, Sadulayev was succeeded as head of the Chechen resistance by the rebel vice-president and an active guerilla commander Dokka Umarov. Goretz unit mutiny The Goretz (Mountaineer) detachment of the Kadyrovtsy was a spetsnaz unit of the FSB headed Movladi Baisarov, the close ally and chief bodyguard to Akhmad Kadyrov, but was formally disbanded and its servicemen were to be reassigned to the Chechen Interior Ministry. After Akhmad Kadyrov's death, conflict with Ramzan Kadyrov led to Baisarov being declared an outlaw, and many men in the detachment refused the reassignment. The Guardian in June 2006 detailed a showdown between Kadyrov's and Baisarov's forces that had taken place the previous month. The Kadyrovtsy ended up backing down in that confrontation when another Chechen warlord, Said-Magomed Kakiev, head of the Spetsnaz GRU unit the Special Battalion Zapad, came down on Baisarov's side. Baisarov went to Moscow and appeared in the Russian media saying that Ramzan Kadyrov was trying to hunt him down to get rid of possible competition. He accused Kadyrov of directing numerous political murders and kidnappings. At the same time, he told Kommersant that he was not hiding from anyone in Moscow and was expecting to return to Chechnya soon to become the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of law enforcement. While as for October 2006, Baisarov was in Moscow, it was believed he still commanded 50 to little over 100 men based in Grozny.The Jamestown Foundation On November 18, 2006, Baisarov was shot dead in central Moscow by a detachment of the Kadyrovtsy.Eurasian Secret Services Daily Review Commanders *Ramzan Kadyrov *Artur Akhmadov *Ruslan Alkhanov *Movladi Baisarov *Alimbek Delimkhanov *Adam Delimkhanov *Idris Gaibov *Muslim Ilyasov *Zelimkhan Kadyrov *Ibragim Khultygov *Alambek Yasayev See also *Politics of Chechnya *Sulim Yamadaev‚ÄìRamzan Kadyrov power struggle *Special Battalions Vostok and Zapad *Kadyrovtsy: ‚ÄúVladimir Putin‚Äôs Combat Infantry‚Äù and Ramzan Kadyrov‚Äôs Henchmen References and notes External links ;Articles * A headless monster, The Guardian, May 21, 2004 * Ana Politkovskaya's last article: Punitive agreement by Anna Politkovskaya, Novaya Gazeta, September 28, 2006 * The Kadyrovtsy: Moscow's New Pawns in the South Caucasus?, The Jamestown Foundation, June 15, 2006 * New Chechen Army Threatens Moscow, AIA, 12.07.2006 * Ramzan's World, Newsweek, October 15, 2007 * Russia rearms former rebels to patrol Chechnya, Reuters/ReliefWeb, 19 March 2008 * Behind the scenes at the death squads of Chechnya, OpenDemocracy, 8 September 2011 ;Video * Russian TV on the Chechen MVD forces * Revival of Brutality in Chechnya (The New York Times investigation) Category:Ramzan Kadyrov Category:Law enforcement agencies of Russia Category:Military units and formations of Russia Category:Paramilitary organizations based in Russia Category:Second Chechen War Category:Indigenous counter-insurgency forces ","title":"Kadyrovtsy"},{"id":"7154472","text":"Hardcore Devo may mean: *Hardcore Devo: Volume One, the first volume (1990) of a pair of albums by Devo *Hardcore Devo: Volume Two, the second volume (1991) of a pair of albums by Devo *Hardcore Devo Live!, a concert film and live album (2014), by Devo ","title":"Hardcore Devo"},{"id":"7154488","text":"is a survival horror stealth video game developed by Artoon.

Retrieved on June 3, 2008 The game received negative reviews.  Plot  Vampires, known as \\"nightwalkers\\", were found to be responsible for the disappearances of civilians in the United States and in other countries. The American Information Bureau (AIB) raises a black ops special forces unit which is deployed to the streets of Los Angeles. Throughout the game the player is haunted by the vision of a young girl, who the player saved in a previous mission. Eventually the player finds out that his team leader has also seen her. Later on it is revealed that the AIB, acting of their own accord, plan for America to enter full-scale war against the Nightwalkers. They send their own human/nightwalker hybrids to kill the player's group to get rid of the evidence, and send the rest of their forces against the Nightwalkers' headquarters in the city. The player defeats all the hybrids and vampires in their way, eventually meeting with the leader of the vampires in an attempt to keep the peace. Unfortunately, the leader also wants full-scale war against the humans, and plans to change the whole city into nightwalkers. The player is forced to fight and defeat him. It turns out the head vampire wasn't really the true leader of nightwalkers in the city, as he was advised by two nightwalkers who were naturally born as vampires and can survive in the daytime. The player fights and kills the first. The second doesn't resist and offers the player the choice to kill him or not, claiming that the future of the nightwalker race will soon be revealed. After the player has left the final battle, if he chose to end him the haunting young girl appears. She pours blood onto the ashes of the leader, and he is resurrected. If one chose not to kill him the lamenting leader vacates the premises only for the little girl to appear beside him and they walk off together.  Gameplay  Vampire Rain is a stealth game similar in nature to the Splinter Cell or Metal Gear series. Players are tasked with navigating their character through city streets, while avoiding the vampire enemies that patrol the streets disguised as ordinary human citizens. Players often have to take alternate routes, such as climbing onto rooftops or through alleys, to avoid enemy encounters. Unlike most stealth-action games, Vampire Rain places heavy emphasis on pure stealth. Enemies are extremely fast and can kill the player in two hits; the first hit usually immobilizes the player, giving the vampire sufficient time to land a second, killing blow. Additionally, for the first third of the game, players lack any weaponry that can kill vampires effectively without spending a large amount of ammunition. In effect, most attempts to initiate combat generally result in the player's death. Also, unlike most stealth games, there is usually no effective means to hide or escape once an enemy has spotted the player, which results in the player dying soon after being spotted. Successful completion of many missions thus generally requires total avoidance of enemies by figuring out the correct route to pass through the mission area without being detected. Later in the game, players are given high-powered weapons which prove more effective against the game's vampire enemies. Also, there are a few pre-scripted action sequences that involve fighting against multiple enemies, generally with the assistance of teammates or special environmental hazards. The player's arsenal includes a handgun, submachine gun, assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, anti-armor rifle and a UV Knife used to stab an enemy from behind for an instant kill. If the player collects enough \\"Medals\\" that are either placed in hidden or difficult to reach spots throughout the game as well as passing certain missions under certain conditions such as within a time-limit, without needing to retry from a checkpoint or without killing any Nightwalkers will reward the player with extra side-missions and challenges. Online multiplayer involves up to eight players in standard modes such as deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag, as well as the unique mode which allows one to become a nightwalker and fight opponents with extreme speed and power. All the firearms are available online and the gameplay is handled like in single-player.  Reception  The game was poorly received. Reviews ranged from lukewarm to scathing.

Current is supplied via force connections 1 and 4. Four-terminal sensing (4T sensing), 4-wire sensing, or 4-point probes method is an electrical impedance measuring technique that uses separate pairs of current-carrying and voltage-sensing electrodes to make more accurate measurements than the simpler and more usual two-terminal (2T) sensing. Four-terminal sensing is used in some ohmmeters and impedance analyzers, and in wiring for strain gauges and resistance thermometers.

This is an advantage for precise measurement of low resistance values. For example, an LCR bridge instruction manual recommends the four-terminal technique for accurate measurement of resistance below 100 ohms.Manual for the Racal-Dana Databridge 9343M: \\"If the resistance value is low, less than 100 ohms, make a four-terminal connection...\\" Four-terminal sensing is also known as Kelvin sensing, after William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who invented the Kelvin bridge in 1861 to measure very low resistances using four-terminal sensing. Each two- wire connection can be called a Kelvin connection. A pair of contacts that is designed to connect a force-and-sense pair to a single terminal or lead simultaneously is called a Kelvin contact. A clip, often a crocodile clip, that connects a force-and-sense pair (typically one to each jaw) is called a Kelvin clip. Operating principle Layout example of a Kelvin connection When a Kelvin connection is used, current is supplied via a pair of force connections (current leads). These generate a voltage drop across the impedance to be measured according to Ohm's law V=IR. A pair of sense connections (voltage leads) are made immediately adjacent to the target impedance, so that they do not include the voltage drop in the force leads or contacts. Since almost no current flows to the measuring instrument, the voltage drop in the sense leads is negligible. It is usual to arrange the sense wires as the inside pair, while the force wires are the outside pair. If the force and sense connections are exchanged, accuracy can be affected, because more of the lead resistance is included in the measurement. The force wires may have to carry a large current when measuring very small resistances, and must be of adequate gauge; the sense wires can be of a small gauge. The technique is commonly used in low-voltage power supplies, where it is called remote sensing, to measure the voltage delivered to the load independent of the voltage drop in the supply wires. It is common to provide 4-wire connections to current-sensing shunt resistors of low resistance operating at high current. 3-wire sensing A variant uses three wires, with separate load and sense leads at one end, and a common wire on the other. Voltage drop in the common wire is compensated for by assuming that it is the same as in the load wire, of the same gauge and length. This technique is widely used in resistance thermometers, also known as resistance temperature detectors or RTDs. It is not as accurate as 4-wire sensing but can remove most of the error caused by cable resistance and is accurate enough for most applications. Another example is in the ATX power supply standard, which includes a remote sense wire connected to the 3.3 V supply line at connector pin 13, but no sense connection for the ground wires.

Early life The son of the founder of Hammer Film Productions, William Hinds, Anthony Hinds was born in Uxbridge, Middlesexhttp://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world- records/england-and-wales- births-1837-2006?firstname=anthony&lastname;=hinds&eventyear;=1922&eventyear;_offset=0 and educated at St Paul's School. He briefly joined his father's business before his war service as a pilot in the RAF during World War II. Career In 1946 Hinds returned to Hammer Film Productions and initially produced a great many modest thrillers. One of these was The Dark Road (1947), one of the quota quickies, which featured a jewellery shop called 'Hinds', a reference to his father's original business. This business had been divided in the 1920s between William and his brother Frank Hinds. Frank's part is now the F. Hinds national jewellery chain. In the summer of 1953 Hinds was enthralled by the BBC's The Quatermass Experiment, a six-part science fiction thriller written by Nigel Kneale. Hinds was so impressed by what he saw that he suggested Hammer buy the big screen rights. They approached the BBC and snapped up the rights. After requesting the new 'X' certificate from the British Board of Film Censors, The Quatermass Xperiment (1955) was a box-office success and was the first of the three Quatermass cinema films based on the television serials. Hinds came up with the idea of hiring country houses and shooting films in the rooms and grounds of the locations, which saved the cost of kitting out a full studio. The company acquired Down Place, renaming it Bray Studios, and was based there until 1966. Under the pseudonym John Elder he was a prolific screenwriter and from the mid-1960s he concentrated on this activity, though he produced the TV series Journey to the Unknown for LWT (1968‚Äì69) and The Lost Continent (1968). The horror script The Unquenchable Thirst of Dracula, which he wrote in the 1970s for Hammer, was never filmed. In October 2015 it was presented as a live stage reading by the Mayhem Film Festival at the Broadway Cinema in Nottingham, featuring the actor and film historian Jonathan Rigby as narrator. In October 2017 a studio production of the script was broadcast on BBC Radio 4, with narration by Michael Sheen.

The village was originally known as Iapun / Lapun and the first reference of the village can be found in the Domesday Book (1086). The village was later known as Yapome with further references in Ancient Petitions, Henry III - James I (1390) when William Lokton petitioned the King for the restoration of the manor of Bolton and other property in Yapome (Yapham). It is not known when the current spelling of the name was adopted. The village Church, St Martin's, is a small church was partially rebuilt in 1777‚Äì8. It consists of chancel and nave, with a western turret, containing one bell. The church was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1967 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. The Wesleyans built a chapel in 1865 however this has been converted into a private house in the 1980s. A school has served the village and surrounding area since before 1773 with a new school built in 1875 to accommodate up to 45 children. The school closed in 1972 with the remaining children transferring to St Martin's Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School in Fangfoss. The old school buildings are now used as a village hall. Yapham was served by Yapham Gate railway station on the York to Beverley Line for a short while between 1855 and 1865. The population of Yapham has remained reasonably unchanged for many years with the 1891 UK census identifying a population of 191 with the 2001 UK census identifying a population of 175. Since 2001, however there have been a number of new houses built in the village. The population of the Civil Parish at the 2011 Census was shown as 217. Yapham Cricket Club has been playing at the Cricket Ground on the edge of the village for almost 100 years and is one of only a few clubs to play on through the war. The club now has a strong junior section as well as both Men's and Ladies Senior Teams. The Gravel Pit Allotment Association was formed in 2009 to convert the old gravel pit field in between Yapham and Meltonby into community allotments.

The economic boost of the new harbour led to a small village developing with fishing being the primary economy of the village. Courtown is situated on the Irish Sea coast and with the recent development during the Celtic Tiger years, has merged into the adjoining village of Riverchapel. It lies on the R742 regional road. Development and amenities Courtown Harbour The name Courtown originally applied to a townland in North Wexford, 4 kilometres east of Gorey town. The townland was home to the seat of Lord Courtown during the 18th and 19th centuries. Courtown House was demolished in 1962. The remains of his private church and cemetery can still be seen in the townland. Today it is home to Courtown Golf Club and Kiltennel Church. In the late 20th and early 21st century, significant urbanisation has taken place, especially in Riverchapel, just south of Courtown Harbour. Large housing estates are now home to commuters working in Dublin. While the population of Courtown is somewhat smaller, the census combines the area of Courtown, Riverchapel and Ardamine. As of the 2006 census the population of this area was 1,421, and had grown to 3,591 by the time of the 2016 census. Courtown is home to 'The Dinky Take-Away', serving the \\"best chips in Ireland\\", as voted on Marty Whelan's morning show on the 2FM radio station. Courtown also has a confectionary shop, ice-cream shop, and hair salons. The town features crazy golf, amusement rides, ten-pin bowling, a golf course, as well as a beach and forest park. Courtown is also home to a Class D RNLI inshore lifeboat. Seal Rescue Ireland (SRI), a charity organisation that works around the clock to rescue, rehabilitate and release native seals found sick, injured or orphaned from across the coast of Ireland is based in Courtown. The main attraction during historical times was Courtown Harbour Courtown Harbour Pirates Cove in Courtown Transport There is a bus once a day (except on Sundays) to and from Gorey, departing in the morning and returning in the afternoon. On Mondays and Saturdays Bus √âireann route 379 operates and continues to Wexford via Curracloe. Route 879 operates on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. On Wednesdays the service is provided by the Rural Roadrunner bus operated by Wexford Local Development.http://www.journeyplanner.transportforireland.ie The nearest station is Gorey railway station, around 7 kilometres away. Tourism  As a harbour and seaside village, there is a high tourism rate during the months of the summer (May‚ÄìAugust). There are a variety of accommodation types such as bed and breakfasts, guesthouses, and caravan and holiday parks.  History  The name 'Courtown' dates back to 1278,http://www.courtownharbour.com/ but the harbour was not built until the mid 1800s as a response by Lord Courtown to the Great Famine, and cost ¬£25,000 to complete. Courtown was by then already well known for its beaches, but the presence of the harbour made it popular as a fashionable destination, with people from Dublin and the midlands frequenting the village and beaches. Its popularity as a summer holiday resort for Dublin people increased after 1863, when the railway line from Dublin reached nearby Gorey.

It was directed by Leslie Arliss and produced by Edward Black from a screenplay by Leslie Arliss and Margaret Kennedy, adapted by Doreen Montgomery from the novel The Man in Grey by Eleanor Smith. The film's sets were designed by Walter Murton. The picture stars Margaret Lockwood, Phyllis Calvert, James Mason, Stewart Granger and Martita Hunt, and melded together elements of the successful \\"women's pictures\\" of the time with distinct new elements. Plot In 1943, a Wren (Phyllis Calvert) and an RAF pilot (Stewart Granger) meet at an auction of Rohan family heirlooms, now all being sold off after the last of the Rohan male line was killed at Dunkirk. After the RAF pilot inadvertently casts aspersions on the Rohan family, the Wren reveals that the last male Rohan was in fact her brother. The RAF man apologises, and reveals that his family are connected to the Rohans in a way, and so they arrange to meet for lunch and at the auction the following day. Back in the Regency period, a new teacher arrives at Miss Patchett's school for young ladies at Bath. This is Hesther (Margaret Lockwood), whose family in Manchester has fallen on hard times and are being done a favour by Miss Patchett. She, however, resents living off charity and so she soon afterwards comes into friction with Clarissa (also played by Phyllis Calvert), a minor heiress who is a pupil at the school. In time, Clarissa and Hesther patch up their differences and become friends, soon before Hesther runs away with Barbary, a penniless ensign. Miss Patchett forbids the disgraced name of Hesther to be mentioned at the school as a result and so Clarissa, out of loyalty to her friend, leaves the school. In London, Clarissa's godmother arranges for her to meet the eponymous man in grey (after his grey clothes), Lord Rohan (James Mason), a notorious rake, misanthrope and duelist with a huge fortune. He marries her, though neither of them does so out of love ‚Äì she does so to please her godmother, and he to gain an heir to the Rohan line ‚Äì and they live separate lives. Clarissa sees an advertisement for a production of Othello in Saint Albans featuring a \\"Mrs Barbary\\", whom she rightly takes to be Hesther under her married name. On the way there in her coach, she is waylaid by a mysterious man (also played by Stewart Granger) who hitches a ride with them to St Albans and turns out to be Rokeby, the actor playing Othello. Hesther is invited to supper after the play by Clarissa, and tells her that Ensign Barbary died in her arms some time past, leaving her penniless. Clarissa promises to get her a position as her son's governess and, though Lord Rohan refuses to grant this position, he does allow Hesther to stay on as Clarissa's companion. Shortly afterwards, when Rohan and Hesther are together, he reveals that he knows she has deceived Clarissa ‚Äì Hesther in fact left her dissolute husband soon after marrying him, and he had in fact then died in the Fleet Prison ‚Äì out of ruthless ambition. Rohan admires this and the two begin an affair. Attending the racing at Epsom Delaney, Clarissa and Rokeby meet again and fall further in love. Hesther gets Rohan to give Rokeby a job on his country estate so as to draw Rokeby and Clarissa away from London and, though Rokeby warns Hesther that he knows what she is trying to do, the ploy succeeds. Later, Rokeby and Clarissa return to London separately and then attempt to elope together to recover his estates in Jamaica (lost to slave rebellions), but Rohan stops them and a duel between him and Rokeby ensues in the Vauxhall Gardens, which is broken up by the Prince Regent. Mrs Fitzherbert persuades Rokeby to embark alone, and wait for Rohan to be persuaded into a separation, but Clarissa pursues him to the port to say farewell. In staying out in the rain watching his ship sail away, she catches a fever and, worse still, is taken back to Lord Rohan's London house and not to the place of safety Rokeby had promised. The fever is not necessarily fatal but Hesther ‚Äì putting Clarissa into a drugged sleep, opening the windows and dousing the fire in her room ‚Äì ensures that it proves so, so clearing the way for herself to marry Rohan. Shortly after the funeral, Hesther manages to get Rohan to offer her marriage but then Clarissa's page boy Toby reveals Hesther's murder to Rohan. Though he did not love his wife, she was still his wife and a Rohan, and so he beats Hesther to death ‚Äì for, as his family motto goes, \\"Who Dishonours Us, Dies.\\" Back in 1943, it is revealed that the RAF man was the descendant of Rokeby. He and Miss Rohan arrive just too late to buy the item they were looking to purchase at the auction, but they do not mind as they have found each other and fallen in love. They then rush for a London bus, with their love-affair seeming better-fated than that of their ancestors. Cast * Margaret Lockwood ... Hesther * Phyllis Calvert ...

The New York Times thought it was old fashioned but enjoyed the depiction of the era saying it created a \\"lively scene for a sad story.\\" The book was a best seller in the US, selling more than 100,000 copies in 1942. Casting Margaret Lockwood later wrote that when she heard about the project, she read the novel and thought she would be ideal for the role of Clarissa. She was not pleased to be cast as Hesther, writing in her memoirs, \\"true, I had played that unpleasant little piece in The Stars Look Down after many misgivings. But Hesther was a different matter. She was downright wicked.\\" She says she was persuaded by Carol Reed's advice to not \\"bother about the number of pages in a part, but think about the motivation.\\" Lockwood \\"didn't like the motivation - but it was a 'meaty' part.\\" Lockwood says that James Mason's role was originally offered to Eric Portman who turned it down. The climax was graphic for its time with Mason's brutal beating of Lockwood's cowering villainess using his walking stick. Lockwood was the only one of the four leads to be a star when the film was made. She told a journalist at the time: > It is a part Hollywood would have given to a star like Bette Davis. I > intend... to 'give it a go.' Its Regency settings are away from the war. It > has plenty of emotional, dramatic quality, yet it calls for subtlety. It is > a role I can handle well under English direction, for British studios don't > concentrate on glamorising stars to such an extent that they become camera- > conscious, thinking only of whether they are at the right angle to the > camera. Lockwood said the second male lead was not cast \\"right up to the day before shooting began... lots of young men had been tried out, all unsuccessfully.\\" Stewart Granger was appearing in a production of Rebecca on stage when he was called in to audition. He says he had been recommended to the producers by Robert Donat, with whom Granger had just appeared on stage in To Dream Again. Granger was the last of the four leads cast and was paid ¬£1,000 for 12 weeks work. \\"I'd have played the part for nothing\\", he later wrote in his memoirs. \\"It was such a chance.\\"Stewart Granger, Sparks Fly Upward, Granada 1981 p 63 Lockwood said \\"as I watched him walk nervously across the set I knew instinctively he [Granger] would get the part.. He was rather an extraordinary young man in those days. He had what seemed to be an enormous inferiority complex, which came out sometimes in a flow of bad language, and at other times in round abuse of everybody, because he hadn't done his piece as well as we wanted.\\" Shooting The film was shot in Gainsborough Studios. Phyllis Calvert was pregnant during filming.Lockwood p 99 Phyllis Calvert later said Leslie Arliss was \\"not at all\\" responsible for the eventual success of the film: > He was a lazy director; he had got a wonderful job there and he just sat > back... Ted Black was the one who would watch it, cut it, and know exactly > what the audience would take. I don't say he wanted to do really good films, > but he knew where the money was and he made all those escapist films during > the war. According to Calvert, one time Arliss was late for a scene between Calvert and Granger so they directed themselves, and \\"Arlissing about\\" became a \\"Gainsborough byword for slackness.\\" James Mason later described his performance as \\"atrocious\\". Reception Box office The film was a massive hit in the UK, turning the four lead actors into stars. Phyllis Calvert later recalled it \\"had two West End premieres. It had one premiere, got terrible notices, went through the provinces and made so much money that it had to come back to London.\\"Brian MacFarlane, An Autobiography of British Cinema, Methuen 1997 p 110 It was the seventh most popular movie at the British box office in 1943.Robert Murphy, Realism and Tinsel: Cinema and Society in Britain 1939‚Äì48 2003 p 206 According to Kinematograph Weekly it came after In Which We Serve, Casablanca, The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, Hello Frisco Hello and The Black Swan It was the tenth most seen movie of the year in Australia. The movie was also successful when released in France in 1945 and in Germany. In 1946 readers of the Daily Mail voted it their second most favourite British film of 1939‚Äì45. Screenonline wrote that it was \\"easy to see why\\" the film was so well received: > It caught the national mood quite brilliantly, by fusing elements of > previously successful \\"women's pictures\\" such as Rebecca (US, d.

It was not as popular in the United States.

Administratively, Yarlington shares a parish council with nearby North Cadbury and forms part of the district of South Somerset. The village gives its name to the Yarlington Mill cider apple. Fruit trees website The village hosts the Yarlington Wassail which has been recently revived. History It was known as Gerlincgetuna, meaning the settlement of Gerla's people, in the Domesday Book of 1086. The manor passed in the 12th century to the Montagues, who later became the earls of Salisbury. Henry VIII gave the manor to his last wife Katherine Parr in 1544 and, in 1547, her brother William Parr, Marquis of Northampton, sold the reversion by licence to Thomas Smyth (Smythe/Smith).Rogers, T.E. (1890) Records of Yarlington. Elliott Stock, London. pp. 94. Thomas Smith was knighted in 1548. Sir Thomas Smith was described as 'of Ankerwicke, in the county of Berks, Knight' when by deed of 6 July 1556, he sold the manor and advowson to William Rosewell, of Loxton, in the county of Somerset, gentleman, and William Rosewell, his son and heir apparent. This William Rosewell became the Solicitor-General to Queen Elizabeth and lived at the manor until about 1562. In 1573, a William Rosewell is presented to the Rectory of Yarlington by William Rosewell, of Loxton. As William Rosewell of Loxton died in 1570 the presentation must have been made by the executors of his estate. The presentee was probably the youngest son of William Rosewell (1499-1568), of Dunkerton, and brother of Thomas Rosewell (1533-c.1602) of Dunkerton who is listed as patron in the presentation. The living was held by William Rosewell until his death in 1627. The Rosewells held the manor for thirty-six years, and William Rosewell, the son of the Solicitor-General, and who is described in the deed of conveyance as 'William Rosewell, of Forde, in the county of Devon, esquire,‚Äô sold the Manor and advowson of Yarlington to Sir Henry Berkeley, of Bruton. The conveyance was dated 8 February 1592. The manor and advowson was held by a branch of the Berkeleys of Bruton from 1592 until their descendant, Lord Carmarthen, sold it to John Rogers in 1782. Rogers built Yarlington House as his manor house. Woolston Manor lay in the south of the parish. It was sold in 1835 to Joseph Goodenough, who rebuilt the manor house further back from the road between 1835 and 1838. The manor house has been a Grade II listed building since 18 March 1986. Yarlington was part of the hundred of Bruton. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wincanton Rural District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The Anglican parish Church of St Mary has an 11th-century tower, however the rest of the building was rebuilt by J.A. Reeve in 1878. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.

The Australian Crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA T. oceanicus populations in Hawaii arose through human-assisted introduction. It is currently unknown whether T. oceanicus was introduced to Hawaii in 1877 by area trade ships, or 1500 years ago with the original Polynesian settlers. Microsatellite comparisons support the idea that the Hawaiian T. oceanicus colonization originated in the Western islands and then spread East. T. oceanicus crickets are black to dark brown in coloration with longitudinal stripes on the back of the head. Males average between 28‚Äì35 mm in length, and the females are typically longer due to the ovipositor with an average of 33‚Äì42 mm. These crickets are typically found on soil ground hiding in fissures or holes in the terrain, and are typically only found in high numbers in landscapes that provide a good deal of cover. T. oceanicus may also be referred to as the black field cricket, a common name it shares with Teleogryllus commodus. The two species are nearly morphologically indistinguishable, the exception being that T. oceanicus males have a greater number of file teeth on their wings. T. oceanicus was originally regarded taxonomically as a geographic race of T. commodus, but was later recognized as a distinct species as growing evidence of reproductive isolation and differences in calling sound were reported. The two species' geographic ranges remain mostly separate with the exception of small overlap zones in Eastern Australia. There have been no reports of hybridization between the species in this overlap zone, thought to be due to differences in calling song acting as a pre-zygotic barrier. No character displacement has been observed in either species in this overlap region. Unlike T. commodus which lays eggs only a single time per season, T. oceanicus crickets breed year round. Song production Like most cricket species, Teleogryllus oceanicus males produce a calling song to attract potential female mates. Crickets produce the sound of their calls using a \\"file-scraper\\" system where, as the male opens and closes its wings, a plectrum (scraper) located on the posterior side of the left wing is rubbed against a filed vein located on the right wing. Structures called the harp and mirror allow the vibrations to resonate, producing the sound that we hear. Courtship Upon being approached by another individual, the male cricket will make antennal contact with the visitor. This contact allows a form of communication through chemoreception, and is important in determining the sex of the other individual. If the visitor is identified as a female, the male will begin the courtship behavior. During courtship, the male will begin singing the courtship song, which is much softer than the calling song, and is made of 7-10 amplitude-modulated chirps followed by a long and fast trill. As courtship progresses, the male will continue to stridulate and stroke the body of the female with his antennae. The female may respond by turning towards the male and contacting his abdomen with her forelegs, antennae and palpi. The male will then flatten his abdomen and spread his forewings, allowing the female to mount him, ultimately leading to copulation. During copulation, the male transfers his sperm to the female via spermatophore. After spermatophore transfer is complete, the male will attempt to remain in contact with the female to prevent her from removing the spermatophore. Unguarded female crickets have been shown to attempt to remove the spermatophore shortly after copulation. In crickets, male guarding behavior duration is closely related to the time it takes to complete sperm transfer. Female preferences In crickets, it is the female sex that is choosy when responding to sexual signals. Sexual signals in Telogryllus oceanicus consists of multiple components. These components may be acoustic in nature, such as the calling song and the courtship song. Chemical components are also present in the form of cuticular hydrocarbons. Calling song Sonogram of the Teleogryllus oceanicus male calling song In Teleogryllus oceanicus, the calling song is complex, consisting of a chirp made up of 4 similar pulses, followed by a trill of pairs of pulses. Properties of this calling song have been shown to vary with temperature. Because the calling song is species specific, and acts as a prezygotic mating barrier in Teleogryllus crickets, it is thought that the calling song is important for females to recognize same-species males. The male calling song also varies between populations. These differences are observed in total song length, pulse duration, and time between pulses. Females in all populations show a consistent preference for a higher proportion of the long chirp element. Because the long chirp element is more energetically demanding, this preference may serve as an honest indicator to the female in regards to the male's fitness. Courtship song The courtship song in crickets is hypothesized to evolutionarily predate the calling song. The male begins the courtship song after a female reacts passively to antennal contact. The presence of the courtship song during male courtship behavior is important in eliciting the female mounting response. Courtship song has been shown to be more variable in Teleogryllus oceanicus than the calling song, and is also more energetically expensive to produce. While calling song is thought to be involved in species recognition, the courtship song is thought to convey fitness information of the singing male. Females show a preference for courtship songs that have a high sound content per unit time. Because the courtship song is energetically expensive to produce, it may serve as an honest indicator of the male's health or fitness. Males that were subjected to an immune challenge were less likely to produce the courtship song, and females showed a preference for the courtship song of males that showed a stronger immune response. Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) In addition to acoustic signals, crickets use chemical signals encoded in cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC). CHCs are waxy chemical compounds that are found on the exoskeleton of most terrestrial arthropods that protect against desiccation, and these compounds have been found to be sexually dimorphic in Teleogryllus oceanicus. It is thought that crickets use the information found in the CHC chemical signal to determine genetic similarity. In other words, crickets can sense how closely related an adjacent individual is by processing the odor exhibited by the CHCs. Females have been shown to exhibit a preference for CHC profiles that show a higher degree of dissimilarity, suggesting that it could serve as a defense against inbreeding. Using CHC profiles in inbreeding defense can occur pre-copulation, in that individuals are less likely to mate when their CHC profile is more similar. This defense can also be exhibited post-copulation, in the form of fertilization bias. After a spermatophore has been transferred to the female's reproductive tract, it takes roughly 40 minutes for the sperm to enter the spermathecal duct, during which time the male remains in contact with the female in a guarding behavior. During this period, females are able to use CHC cues to determine degree of relatedness. Females have control of sperm storage to a degree, and have been show to store more sperm from non-related males compared to related males. Male-male competition If a calling male cricket encounters another cricket, he will make antennal contact with the stranger individual to recognize the sex of the visitor. If the visitor is found to be another male, the calling male will begin aggressive behaviors. A male begins by singing an aggression song to the rival male, which results in the rival reciprocating, or retreating. Male conflicts involve antennal contact, lunging, aggressive chirping, and biting. Outcomes of fights depend on multiple factors, including differences in size, territory residency, differences in behavior, and fighting experience. Dominant males who have previously won fights are much more likely to win future fights. Males who have won 5 consecutive fights have been shown to have an 87% probability of winning the next. A male cricket's aggression song changes as a result of fight outcome (being enhanced after a win or reduced after a loss) thereby reinforcing a male's dominance or submission. Because conflicts can be very costly, winning fights may serve as an honest indicator of a male individual's fitness which can be assessed by females. A male's dominance also has a post- copulation effect by influencing fertilization success. Dominant males produce higher quality ejaculate, leading to females laying more eggs when mated to a dominant male compared to a subordinate male. Rather than focus on ejaculate quality, subordinate males up-regulate the production of their cuticular hydrocarbons to appear more attractive to females. : Males also assess the presence of male competition through auditory cues. Males in an area that has a high number singing males will increase sperm production to combat the perceived sperm competition. Predators Like other small insects, Teleogryllus oceanicus crickets are subject to predation from many sources. This includes other insects, rodents, lizards, and mammals. Sexual signals used to attract a mate are often conspicuous and can by exploited by \\"eavesdropping\\" predators or parasites. Secondary traits that evolved via sexual selection may therefore be simultaneously opposed by natural selection. These species are then presented a conflict between mate attraction and survival. Male crickets are especially vulnerable to attack due to their conspicuous calling song. While this behavior is vital for mate attraction, it also gives up the calling individual's locations to nearby predators, especially those which hunt using acoustic cues. The most common acoustically oriented predators to pose a threat are insectivorous bats. For some T. oceanicus populations in Hawaii, the parasitoid fly species Ormia ochracea also poses a great threat. Bat predation Bats are very well equipped to prey upon crickets. While some bats rely purely on mid-flight echolocation to locate their prey, other species locate their prey through passive listening, orienting towards sounds made by the prey, and often emitting a fainter echolocation call as they approach their target. Teleogryllus oceanicus crickets have been shown to be able to distinguish a range of echolocation frequencies, responding with avoidance flight away from the bats. Multiple species of bats (Nyctophilus major and N. geoffroyi) have been shown to prefer trills in the cricket song compared to chirps. As a result, male crickets prefer to call from shelter, and the calls from males in shelter contain a greater number of trills than those emitted by a non-sheltered male. Ormia ochracea parasitism Ormia ochracea is an acoustically-orienting parasitoid fly that is native to North America, but has also been introduced to Hawaii. Females of this species are able to locate singing male Teleogryllus oceanicus crickets using a hearing apparatus evolutionarily convergent to T. oceanicus females. Once the singing male has been located, the female fly lays eggs on and around the male cricket, allowing her larvae to burrow into the host. The larvae eat and grow inside the cricket, emerging roughly 7 days later to pupate, killing the male cricket in the process. :: T. oceanicus and O. ochracea geographic distributions only overlap in Hawaii. On Hawaii, some T. oceanicus populations live in the presence of the parasitoid fly, while others do not. Populations subject to fly parasitism show differences in calling behavior, when compared to populations where the fly is absent. Parasitized populations refrain from singing at dawn or dusk, when the flies are active. Additionally, differences in the calling song itself have been attributed to pressures from the fly's presence. Populations with greater fly density show more differences in their calling song than populations with a lower fly density, which resemble non-parasitized population songs more closely. :: T. oceanicus males that have been parasitized by O. ochracea show a decrease in reproductive investment. Infected male individuals spend less energy on spermatophore production and calling, and allocate less mass to reproductive tissue. This decrease is contrary to the reproductive compensation hypothesis, which predicts that parasitized individuals will increase reproductive efforts to counteract the decrease in life expectancy. Whether the decrease in reproductive effort is a result of energy trade-offs or chemical changes made by the fly to affect the host remains to be seen. Flatwing wing morph : In 2003, a novel mutation was identified in the highly parasitized Teleogryllus oceanicus population in Kauai that resulted in a wing morphology that renders the male obligately silent (known as flatwing). This mutation is inherited through a single sex-linked allele. With such a heavy parasite presence, males with the mutation could have a survival advantage, which led to rapid evolution, with over 90% of males exhibiting the flatwing morphology after less than 20 generations. While these males were at an advantage when it came to survival, they were also at a disadvantage when it came to reproduction because they were unable to sing to attract a mate. To overcome this barrier and pass on the mutation to future generations, a behavioral change in regards to reproduction would have had to take place to compensate. This behavior is known as satellite behavior. : Satellite male strategy has been shown in a wide range of species including fish, frogs and other cricket species. Satellite males adopt an alternative reproduction strategy in which they are attracted to dominant or, in the case of T. oceanicus, calling males in the hopes of intercepting a female. All male T. oceanicus males are attracted to the song of other males, but wild type males usually distance themselves from the caller by at least 1 meter. Flatwing males in the field move towards a calling song source at a faster rate and settle closer when compared to wild type males. : Once a flatwing male successfully intercepts a female, he is not able to produce the courtship song to evoke the female to mount. In order for flatwing males to persist in a population, changes in female preferences must have occurred. Because founding island populations may be quite small, it could be less advantageous for females to be choosy. While females from ancestral, non-parasitized Australian females will still mate with silent flatwing males, females from parasitized Hawaiian island populations discriminate significantly less against silent courting males. : Purring morph : In 2017, males with a new wing type were identified in another population of T. oceanicus on the island of Molokai. These males produce a different song when stridulating, which superficially sounds like a cat's purr. Unlike the silent, flatwing morph, purring males can use this new calling song to attract females. This may be an evolving private mode of communication between crickets in order to avoid parasitism. : References External links *Cook Islands Biodiversity site, images and sounds *Marlene Zuk Lab site, research and publications Category:Gryllinae Category:Insects described in 1841 ","title":"Teleogryllus oceanicus"},{"id":"7154669","text":"George Scha(e)f(f)er may refer to: * George Schaefer (film producer) (1888‚Äì1981), American film producer and executive * George Schaefer (finance), American banking executive *George Schaefer (businessman) (1928-2013) * George Schaefer (director) (1920‚Äì1997), American television and theatre director and president of the Directors Guild of America * George (Schaefer) (born 1950), bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia * George Schaeffer, American football player * George E.

Passengers embark on a leisurely paced outdoor boat ride through a winding canal featuring settings from Disney animated films recreated in miniature. The Disneyland version was one of the original attractions when the park opened on July 17, 1955, although the miniature buildings and landscaping were not added until the following year. The version in Disneyland Paris is named Le Pays des Contes de F√©es (meaning \\"The Land of Fairy Tales\\" in French) and opened in the spring of 1994. History English church and watermill Dutch landscape The ride's concept dates back to Walt Disney's plans for a \\"magical little park\\" across the street from his Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. This modestly scaled, never-built amusement park was to include a gravity flow canal boat ride among its attractions. When plans for the much grander Disneyland were being made, there was to be a \\"Lilliputianland\\", inspired by Madurodam, a miniature city in the Netherlands that Disney once visited. However, the technology did not yet exist to create the miniature animated figures that were to inhabit the \\"Lilliputian\\" village, so the canal ride opened under the name Canal Boats of the World. It was intended to be a journey past miniature recreations of the great landmarks of the world, but time and money prevented its completion. The ride was plagued by other problems. The outboard motors were prone to overheating, often forcing the boats to be pulled by hand, and because the attraction opened with little landscaping, it earned the nickname among park executives as \\"The Mud Bank Ride\\". After two months of operation, the Canal Boats closed while Storybook Land was constructed and the muddy banks were landscaped with miniature plants, including a bonsai tree planted by Walt Disney himself. The idea of having Monstro the whale consume the canal boats came from a never-implemented concept for a \\"Monstro the Whale\\" ride, in which small boats were to be swallowed by Monstro and then plunged down a watery path into a pond below. The attraction reopened on June 16, 1956, under the new name Storybook Land Canal Boats. The models, scaled 1 inch to 1 foot, included Gepetto's village from Pinocchio, the Pigs' houses from Three Little Pigs, the London park from Peter Pan, Alice's cottage from Alice in Wonderland, the Old Mill from the 1937 Silly Symphony cartoon, Toad Manor from The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' diamond mine, and Cinderella's Castle. Over the years several scenes have been added to and removed from the attraction. Most notably, the Sultan's Palace from Aladdin appeared where the miniature Toad Hall from The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad had previously stood for a major refurbishment done in 1994. Toad Hall returned the following year in another location. For the 50th anniversary of Disneyland in 2005, the Tinker Bell boat was painted gold and the lighthouse given a gold and maroon theme. Beginning December 20, 2014, the attraction at Disneyland added the village of Arendelle from Disney's Frozen including Anna and Elsa's castle, Wandering Oaken's Trading Post, and Elsa's ice palace. These additions replaced the three Dutch miniature windmills representing The Old Mill (1937). Disneyland version Monstro, eye partially closed View of attraction from Casey Jr. Circus Train in 2007 Passengers enter the attraction through a chain queue that winds in front of the loading dock. A lighthouse at the queue's entrance was once a ticket booth from when Disneyland required tickets for riding individual attractions. Storybook Land canal boats originally required a \\"D\\" coupon. The motor-driven boats are scaled-down replicas of Dutch, English, and French boats. All of the boats are named after female Disney characters except for Flower (retired), the male skunk from Bambi. Passengers are seated along the edges of the boat, facing inward, although children are sometimes permitted to ride on the front flat part of the boat. A costumed guide sits just above the passengers on the back of the boat, perched above the engine housing, and narrates the ride. After departing from the dock, the boat passes through a short cave sculpted to look like Monstro, the whale that swallowed Pinocchio. Monstro is partially animated: his eye opens and closes, and periodically steam comes out of his blow hole. The canals past the Monstro cave are landscaped with miniature trees and shrubs. Along the banks are small buildings representing the homes of characters from Disney animated films, although not all the locations were actually depicted in film. Many of these settings feature sound recordings of characters singing or working. The miniature settings include: * The pigs' homes from The Three Little Pigs * An English village, with a church and the entrance to the White Rabbit's hole, from Alice in Wonderland * London Park from Peter Pan * The Sultan's palace from Aladdin * The Cave of Wonders from Aladdin * The dwarfs' cottage and mine from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs * The French countryside village from Cinderella, featuring a gold-spired castle * The patchwork quilt from Lullaby Land * Toad Hall from The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad * Village of Arendelle from Frozen, featuring Anna and Elsa's castle, Wandering Oaken's Trading Post, and Elsa's ice palace * Cobblestone Alpine village with Geppetto's wood shop from Pinocchio * Prince Eric's seaside castle from The Little Mermaid * King Triton's underwater castle, partially hidden behind a waterfall, from The Little Mermaid The boat then returns the passengers to the loading dock from which they boarded. The attraction closes during any fireworks shows and resumes normal operation once the show has ended.

The boats here are guided by an underwater wire rather than being propelled by an on-board motor. Passengers enter their boats via a slowly revolving platform. The whole transport system was developed by Intamin (as a Tow boat ride). The Cave of Wonders from Aladdin midway through the voyage replaces the Disneyland version's Monstro cave.

The attraction's 13 boats are powered by electric inboard motors. When not in use, they are stored in a boathouse hidden behind the waterfall containing Triton's Castle. The houses in Storybook Land are fitted with six-inch doors and quarter-inch hinges that open and close, so the Disneyland electricians can change the lightbulbs.

When construction was finished, the cathedral rivaled both Old South Church and Trinity Church in grandeur. The cathedral is located in the city's South End neighborhood, at 1400 Washington St. Although the South End was initially developed for Boston's emerging Anglo-Saxon Protestant middle class, the neighborhood transitioned to new immigrants, especially Irish, as middle class owners moved to the new Back Bay neighborhood. The cathedral functions both as a cathedral and as a parish. The Cathedral Parish consists of large English- and Spanish-speaking congregations, drawn largely from the local area, and also includes three Archdiocese-wide congregations: the Ge'ez Rite practiced by Ethiopian, Eritrean, and Egyptian Catholics; the German Apostolate; and the Tridentine Mass Catholic community. The first of these congregations moved to the cathedral from the nearby Holy Trinity Catholic Church in 1994, the other two in 2008. History In 1860, Bishop John Fitzpatrick recognized that the church in Boston had outgrown the old Holy Cross Cathedral on Franklin St. However, plans for the new cathedral were disrupted by the outbreak of the United States Civil War. Bishop Fitzpatrick died in 1866 and Bishop John Williams took over planning for the cathedral project. Ground was broken on April 29, 1866 and the completed structure was dedicated on December 8, 1875 by Williams, who was by then Boston's first archbishop. The Cathedral was named after the relic of holy cross that is owned by the church. This relic, supposedly a small fragment of the cross from Jesus' crucifixion was on display in the Cathedral until 2010 when it was stolen from the church by a janitor. The relic was eventually returned to the Cathedral, and since its theft the relic has only been on display during special dates throughout the liturgical year. In 2018, the first major renovation of the cathedral began. During the process, approximately 8,000 square feet of reclaimed wood was salvaged from the building. The 26 million dollar renovation was completed on Palm Sunday 2019. Architecture The cathedral was designed by Patrick Keely, a noted ecclesiastical architect, in the Gothic Revival style. Construction commenced in 1867 and was completed in 1875. With local anti- Catholic sentiments a recent memory, the Gothic Revival edifice was intentionally massive, a statement that the Catholics of Boston were here to stay. Bricks from the 1834 riots in Charlestown, in which an Ursuline convent was burned down, were used in the arch over the front door. Built of Roxbury puddingstone with gray limestone trim, it reaches a height of 120 feet. Until the erection of the new Cathedral of St. Joseph (Hartford, Connecticut) in 1957, Holy Cross was the largest cathedral in New England. The building, measuring in length and at the transepts, can accommodate about 2,000 worshippers in the main level. There is also an oratory for smaller services in the lower level. A planned western spire was never completed. Supervision of the construction fell largely to Keely and his assistant John A. Dempwolf.Virtual York: An Architectural Experience: The Dempwolf Contribution to York's Streetscape The cathedral retains its E. and G.G. Hook and Hastings pipe organ, opus 801, which was installed in 1875. The organ console was replaced in 1929 with a used theatre organ console when the instrument was updated. In 2003, the Andover Organ Company created and installed its opus R-394, a replica of the original three-manual console, and updated wiring and made other needed repairs. Notable events On January 19, 1964, Richard Cardinal Cushing celebrated a Requiem for President John F. Kennedy that was recorded and broadcast to the nation. The Boston Symphony Orchestra accompanied the Mozart Requiem. On October 1, 1979, Pope John Paul II held a 38-minute prayer service for 2,000 priests in the cathedral during his first pilgrimage to the United States. On April 18, 2013, an interfaith prayer vigil in honor of the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing took place at the cathedral, with President Barack Obama delivering the eulogy. Cathedral High School In 1927, Cardinal William O'Connell founded Cathedral High School adjacent to the church and charged the Sisters of St. Joseph with operating the institution. The school remains at this site today.

First aired on March 18, 1975, and written by Everett Greenbaum and Jim Fritzell, the highly rated episode was most notable for its shocking and unexpected ending. The plot of the episode centers on the honorable discharge and subsequent departure of the 4077th MASH's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake (played by McLean Stevenson). The title of the episode refers to the slang use of \\"Abyssinia\\" for \\"goodbye\\". (\\"Abyssinia\\", pronounced \\"ab-ee-SIN-ee-ah\\" can be understood as \\"I'll be seeing you\\".See for example, Oxford English Dictionary: Abyssinia, 2nd edition 1989, online edition September 2011 The highly controversial ending to the episode, which has since been referenced and parodied many times, prompted more than 1,000 letters to series producers Gene Reynolds and Larry Gelbart, and drew fire from both CBS and 20th Century Fox. After the production of this episode, both Stevenson and Wayne Rogers, who played the character of Trapper John McIntyre, left the series to pursue other interests. While Stevenson's departure was announced prior to and written into \\"Abyssinia, Henry\\", Rogers unexpectedly left the series during the break between Seasons Three and Four, and so his character's departure takes place off-screen in the following episode, \\"Welcome to Korea\\", the first of the show's fourth season. These combined departures and their subsequent replacements also signaled the beginning of a major shift in focus of the M*A*S*H series as a whole with story and script focus emphasizing the character of Hawkeye Pierce, played by Alan Alda. Plot The episode opens in the operating room, as the surgeons and medical staff (with the exception of Frank Burns) participate in a game of \\"Name That Tune\\". Tension between Frank, who requests silence, and the other surgeons reaches a peak, and shortly afterwards, Radar O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff) enters the O.R. and informs Blake of his discharge: he has received all of the needed Army service points to be rotated home. Upon the completion of the surgical session, Henry begins planning his upcoming trip home and places a telephone call to Bloomington, Illinois, to inform his wife and family of the good news.\\"Abyssinia, Henry.\\" Written by Fritzell, Jim and Greenbaum, Everett. M*A*S*H. DVD. Prod. by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. Dist. by Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, LLC., 1975 (2003 DVD release). Meanwhile, Major Margaret Houlihan (Loretta Swit) and Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville) are eagerly awaiting the upcoming transfer of command of the 4077th MASH: upon Blake's departure, Burns will become the unit commander. Henry and Radar begin to clean out the main office, sharing a sentimental moment in which Radar tells Blake of his meaning to him. As a token of appreciation and admiration, Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns the favor by spontaneously giving Radar a rectal thermometer that once belonged to his father. On the night before Henry's departure, Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda), Trapper McIntyre (Wayne Rogers), and Radar throw a going-away party for him at Rosie's Bar and Grill. All four inebriated, they share some pleasant memories and reminisce before Blake leaves to go to the bathroom. While Henry is gone, the others prepare a comedic ceremony to \\"drum [Henry] out of the Army\\". As a part of the ceremony, the three present Henry with a brand new suit as a parting gift. The next morning is the first with Frank Burns in charge, and he immediately starts using his \\"gung-ho\\", militarily strict, and whistle-happy attitude to assemble the company. A lack of respect from his subordinates is already evident, as an out of uniform and unshaven Hawkeye and Trapper and an outrageously dressed (even for him) Corporal Klinger (Jamie Farr) show up for the assembly. As Blake leaves his tent for the last time, dressed in his new suit, he is greeted with a round of applause from the unit. Frank and Margaret give Blake a formal \\"ten-hut\\" salute. Henry, in his typical laid-back fashion, tells Frank to \\"take it easy\\" and to \\"stuff that whistle someplace\\". After saying his individual goodbyes to many of the members of the 4077th, Hawkeye whispers to Henry and convinces him to give a long kiss to Margaret, generating another rousing round of applause from the onlookers. Blake then leaves the camp, walking towards the chopper pad with Hawkeye, Trapper, Margaret, Frank, Klinger, Father Mulcahy (William Christopher), and Radar, with the rest of the camp saying farewells and singing \\"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow\\". When the helicopter arrives, it contains a wounded soldier, which occupies Hawkeye and Trapper; they say their short goodbyes before going to care for the soldier. Beginning to board the helicopter, Henry spots an emotional Radar saluting him and pauses for a moment. He runs back to him to return the salute, hug him, and leave him with the words: \\"You behave yourself, or I'm gonna come back and kick your butt.\\" Blake then boards the helicopter and leaves the 4077th. As surgeons are working on wounded soldiers, Radar enters, visibly shaken and not wearing the required surgical mask. Trapper chides him for this (and Hawkeye jokingly asks if this is about his own discharge), but Radar, too dazed to react, delivers a shocking announcement: \\"I have a message. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake's plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan. It spun in. There were no survivors.\\" Radar leaves the operating room as the camera pans the stunned and silent hospital staff, including Trapper and a teary-eyed Hawkeye, who continue to operate on the wounded, and Majors Burns and Houlihan, who are crying. A surgical instrument can be heard being dropped in the background. After a final commercial break, the episode closes with a \\"reluctant and affectionate farewell\\" to Blake by means of a light-hearted montage of clips from past episodes. Production The final scene, in which Radar informs everyone of the death of Henry Blake, was unprecedented: it was the first time in American television history that a main character departing a comedy series was killed off in a tragic way. When Stevenson decided to leave the series part way through the third season, Gene Reynolds and Larry Gelbart, the show's producers, decided to make a statement regarding the unexpectancies and horror of war, especially with the Vietnam War fresh in people's minds. To evoke genuine emotions of shock and sadness, the final O.R. scene was kept a secret from the cast, with the exception of Alan Alda, until immediately before filming; only then did Gelbart hand out the last page of the script. As a result, Stevenson was still on the set to see the final scene being filmed. After shooting was completed, a season-ending cast party was planned. Stevenson left the set almost immediately after the end of filming, and the party was canceled due to the poor mood of the cast. Stevenson later said in an interview that he was deeply hurt that his character's death was revealed in that fashion and the party was \\"ruined.\\" Gelbart later said of the event, \\"I wish we could say to him, 'We didn't mean it, Mac. Reaction and impact Shortly after the episode originally aired, the reactions and feedback of viewers were intense, both in support and condemnation of the events of the episode.Reynolds, Gene. . Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation. August 22, 2000. (Accessed 2011-12-09) It is estimated that over 1,000 letters were received by the producers regarding the episode; \\"some ... were from people who understood. Many were from people that didn't.\\" Many of those who objected also cited the fact that M*A*S*H was considered a situation comedy, and that Blake's \\"cheap\\" killing did not belong in the show; one caller to Reynolds stated after the episode aired that they \\"don't know why [they] did it; it's not necessary, it's just a little comedy show\\" and that \\"you've upset everybody [in the family],\\" before vowing never to watch the show again. Another, more lighthearted response to the episode came from an unhappy viewer in Lubbock, Texas, who sent a telegram stating that \\"Henry Blake has been found in a raft in Lake Lubbock.\\" Initially, Gelbart and Reynolds hand-wrote letters in response to the feedback, but eventually, due to the overwhelming number of letters, a form response was created explaining the rationale of their decisions. Negative reactions were not exclusive to the home viewers of the program: both CBS, the network that aired M*A*S*H, and 20th Century Fox, the company that produced M*A*S*H, expressed their unhappiness at the killing of Henry Blake. In fact, CBS' distaste with the episode was so great that during a later rerun of the episode, the final O.R. scene was cut from the episode. The final scenes have always been shown in syndication, and were uncut on the DVD release of the series' third season in 2003. Not all reaction to the airing was negative: On an episode of the variety series Cher that aired shortly afterward and featured Stevenson as a guest, the situation was parodied when the episode opened to a studio shot of Stevenson as Blake floating on a smoking raft and shouting, \\"I'm OK! I'm OK!\\"Clip from Cher 1975: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxmvqrCNwH8 In Bobbie Ann Mason's 1985 novel In Country, the teenage protagonist recalls having watched the episode as a child and being \\"so shocked she went around stunned for days,\\" and confesses that Blake's death on the show had seemed more real to her than the death of her own father in Vietnam.Bobbie Ann Mason, In Country, 1985. The final scene was spoofed on the Family Guy episode \\"Fifteen Minutes of Shame\\" when a cutaway shows Brian Griffin saying to the rest of the family, \\"I have an announcement. Meg Griffin's plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan. It spun in. There were no survivors.\\"Family Guy episode \\"Fifteen Minutes of Shame\\". In 1997, TV Guide included this episode in their list of the \\"100 Greatest Episodes of All Time,\\" ranking it #20., TV Guide, 6/25/97. \\"As chosen by the staff of TV Guide and Nick at Night TV Land\\". Retrieved from Internet Archive Wayback Machine. Last accessed March 18, 2012. In 2005, TV Land included this episode as part of its \\"Top 100 Most Unexpected Moments in TV History\\", ranking it #15. Aftermath While \\"Abyssinia, Henry\\" is well known for the departure of McLean Stevenson from the series, it was also the final episode in which Wayne Rogers appeared. During the summer 1975 break between seasons three and four, he quit the series. 20th Century Fox sued him for breach of contract, but the lawsuit collapsed. The character of Trapper John McIntyre was subsequently written off the series in \\"Welcome to Korea,\\" the first episode of the next season.. As a result, when the cast returned to begin filming the series' fourth season in September 1975, there were major changes in both the makeup and the direction of the show: The more earnest and faithful family man Captain B.J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell) had replaced Trapper John, and the regular Army Colonel Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan) had replaced Henry Blake as commander of the 4077th. Another change to the composition of the show occurred in the elevation of longtime recurring guest cast member Jamie Farr, who played Corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger, to the regular cast, with his name being featured on the opening credits. Episodes following this represented a major change in focus for the show: The individual effects and psychological damages of war were explored more, often in parallel to the ending of the Vietnam War, and the Korean culture was portrayed in greater depth than had been done before, instead of focusing on a \\"boorish, military mindset\\" as before.Wittebols, James H. Watching M*A*S*H, watching America: A Social History of the 1972‚Äì1983 Television Series. 62‚Äì74. 1998. 272. In general, the show began to take on a more serious tone as a seriocomic (or dramedy) series, in which the focus was on the character rather than the character type, and moved away from its status as a situation comedy.

It is the seventh film in the Puppet Master franchise, a prequel to 1991's Toulon's Revenge, and stars Greg Sestero as a young Andr√© Toulon, Jack Donner as an Egyptian responsible for teaching Toulon how to animate his puppets, and Stephen Blackehart, Robert Radoveanu and Vitalie Bantas as demons who pursue Toulon for his magic. While Retro serves to explain how Toulon began practicing the spell which animates his puppets, it ignores what was originally established in the second film as exactly how he learned the spell of animation. The film was also Guy Rolfe's final appearance as Toulon, save for flashback footage in The Legacy. Plot The film begins in 1944, Switzerland, taking place after the events of Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge. Toulon and his little friends are still on the run, and decide to hide in the Kolewige, an inn 4 miles from the Swiss border. Blade finds the wooden head of an old puppet named Cyclops in their trunk, and when Toulon sees it, he then tells his puppets the adventures with the woman he loves, and his retro puppets, starting in Cairo, Egypt, in 1902. A 3,000-year-old Egyptian sorcerer, named Afzel, has stolen the secret of life, and is fleeing the servants of an evil Egyptian god, named Sutekh. Two servants, imbued with magical power from Sutekh, attack him, but are killed easily by Afzel and his own magical power. After dispatching the two servants he begins his journey to Paris. Meanwhile, Sutekh has given life to three of his oldest servants‚ÄîEgyptian mummies. After they rise from their chamber they too begin to pursue Afzel. Cut to Paris, where a young Andr√© Toulon is putting on a puppet show of Dante's Divine Comedy. Watching from the crowd is Elsa, who has left her cold-hearted abusive ambassador father and harmless mother to view the wonders of the country and has decided to see the play. In the sewers nearby the three mummies have hired two thugs to kill Afzel. The thugs are necessary since Afzel has the power to sense the coming of the mummies. Afzel is beaten brutally until Elsa, leaving the theater, sees them and cries for help. The thugs then scatter, leaving Toulon and Elsa to pick Afzel up and bring him inside. Later, when he stirs from his sleep, he talks with Toulon and reveals that he knows the secret of life, and it's the only thing that can protect humankind when the elder gods rise up in 100-1,000 years, and needs to pass it on to Toulon. Toulon is skeptical until Afzel begins to make the puppets move. Now Toulon realizes he is genuine and begins to learn his powers. Then Afzel starts to make the puppets draw a barrier that's supposed to protect him if the servants come back. While stepping outside for a brief moment, Toulon begins to talk to a beggar who has sat on the steps since the beginning of the movie. However, he is dead, and when Andre becomes aware of this he begins to mourn. Afzel tells him to bring him inside to teach him the true secret of life. After bringing him inside they use a ring to transfer the soul of the beggar to the puppet, \\"Pinhead\\". The puppet starts to move but, after a few questions the puppet runs away into the theater. Later on, Elsa returns to talk to Toulon, until her father's rude servants come by, and they take Elsa and Toulon back to her house, and after Toulon talks to the father, he gets knocked out, and is then thrown into the woods. The next day, back at the theater, Valentin storms in as the barrier written on paper falls off the wall. The three mummies see their chance to attack and begin their rampage through the theater. Valentin finishes repairing the door as two of the mummies break in and kill him. Vigo runs backstage to Duval and Latour and falls dead. Duval stabs the lead mummy in his hand as the mummy kills him with his other hand. Latuor gets out a gun and shoots the lead mummy three times as the other mummy comes in through the back door and all three of them use their magic to kill him. Afzel appears and says Sutekh shall not claim his life, and kills himself with his own magic. Satisfied with victory, the mummies begin to leave. Once Toulon returns from the woods, he sees what has happened and acts quickly by putting their souls inside his puppets. The men return, having sensed someone with the knowledge of the secret of life, and try to kill Toulon. Six-Shooter, however, kills one of the mummies by shooting the chandelier chains, causing it to crush the servant. The two henchmen retreat in order to plot the capture of Elsa to lure Toulon into a trap. Feeling that he had won the battle, Andr√© and his puppets go to a train station to leave Paris to Kara, Togo before things start to get bad, not realizing they had already begun. The servants killed her parents, the guards and capture Elsa, and then send a dream to Toulon that shows Elsa tied up, and a train. Knowing the meaning, he quickly changes trains to Merca, Somalia and gets his puppets ready for the showdown. When the train leaves, Andr√© looks around, having released his puppets and letting them follow him throughout the train, until finally coming to the last car and finding Elsa tied up like in his dream. The two men appear and ask for the secret of life. Andr√© displays the scroll where the secret is written and asks, \\"How do you know I haven't copied it?\\" to which the leader states he did not have enough time to do so, but still is doubtful he hadn't. Andr√©, noticing he is distracted, attacks the leader while his puppets attack the other. A large struggle breaks out, and the other henchman is killed with the final leader of the three being thrown from the car. Freeing Elsa, the group rides away in the train, beginning their adventure. After telling the story, the puppets wonder what happened to the other puppets. Andre tells them that's another story, which he will tell them in the future.

C. Squire and published by Longmans, Green. Each essay in the collection could be considered alternate history or counterfactual history, a few written by leading historians of the period and one by Winston Churchill. Essays The original edition included the following essays:Uchronia Entry * \\"If Drouet's Cart Had Stuck\\" by Hilaire Belloc: In a 1791 point of divergence, the Flight to Varennes is successful and the First Coalition wins the Battle of Valmy, restoring Louis XVI to the French throne as a puppet of the British Empire. France becomes a poor, backward nation, eventually entering World War I, which happens a few years later than in reality and ends with the victory of the still-extant Holy Roman Empire. * \\"If Don John of Austria Had Married Mary Queen of Scots\\" by G. K. Chesterton\\"If Don John of Austria had Married Mary Queen of Scots\\" by G. K. Chesterton (scroll to bottom of page) * \\"If Lee Had NOT Won the Battle of Gettysburg\\" by Winston Churchill: This essay is written from the viewpoint of a historian in a world where the Confederate Army won the Battle of Gettysburg and the Civil War, and the narration frequently asks what would happen if that were not so, the joke being that we know that it isn't so. Although the Confederacy achieves independence, the British Empire becomes a broker between the United States and CSA, resulting in an eventual unification of all three as the \\"English Speaking Association\\", which prevents World War I.\\"If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg\\" by Winston Churchill. Reprinted in Wisconsin Magazine of History: Volume 44, number 4, summer, 1961. * \\"If Napoleon Had Escaped to America\\" by H. A. L. Fisher: Napoleon Bonaparte, fleeing from the Battle of Waterloo, avoids surrendering to the British Empire and catches a ship sailing to New York City. The essay is written from the perspective of a New York scholar who becomes a personal assistant of the former Emperor of the French. Napoleon travels south to join Simon Bolivar in liberating most of Central America and South America from Spanish and Portuguese rule. * \\"If the Moors in Spain Had Won\\" by Philip Guedalla: Islamic Granada survives as a separate political entity, weakening Spain from the late 15th century onward, but resulting in a liberal humanist brand of Islam, the adoption of constitutional monarchy, and Spanish participation on the Central Powers' side during World War I against Granada and the Entente Powers. * \\"If the General Strike Had Succeeded\\" by Ronald Knox: This essay is in the form of an article from The Times of 1931, which describes a Great Britain under communist rule. * \\"If the Emperor Frederick Had Not Had Cancer\\" by Emil Ludwig: Kaiser Friedrich III survives past 1888, and with his wife, Empress Victoria, rules a liberal humanist German Empire where their son Kaiser Wilhelm II never succumbs to militarism, due to the long-term benign effects of this scenario, leading to 1914 being a year of peace. * \\"If Louis XVI Had Had an Atom of Firmness\\" by Andr√© Maurois: As with Hilaire Belloc's essay above, the main story posits Louis XVI as averting his 1793 death in the French Revolution, but the point of divergence happens in the 1770s rather than 1791, and leads to a more optimistic outcome. In a frame story, a recently deceased historian is escorted by an angel to a great library in Heaven, where he gets to read history books of possible worlds that did not come to be. His eye is caught by a book whose cover states that Louis XVI had a 46-year reign as King of France, dying of a lung illness in 1820. In the main story, the young king, shortly after coming to power in the mid 1770s, makes necessary financial and constitutional reforms beforehand that prevent the necessity for the Revolution, resulting in the survival of France as a constitutional monarchy into the twentieth century. Louis refuses to sponsor the American Revolution and later builds an alliance with Great Britain; the United States never exists, but the 13 Colonies get the representation they desired from the British Parliament, so the expanding America effectively controls Britain. The 1790s and 1800s are relatively peaceful decades for Europe, and all nations live happily ever after. * \\"If Byron Had Become King of Greece\\" by Harold Nicolson. The fun-loving poet and playwright recovers from his 1824 illness, becomes chief military strategist in the Greek War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire, and is chosen to be the new nation's first monarch in the 1830s. He is referred to in the story as George I of Greece, a name which in reality was given to a different monarch 30 years later. * \\"If It Had Been Discovered in 1930 that Bacon Really Did Write Shakespeare\\" by J. C. Squire. Not a true alternate history, this is a comic farce wherein cultural upheavals, acts of quick thinking in rebranding tourist attractions, and additions of new slang terms to the English language occur when someone finds a box containing 17th-century documents proving that the plays generally accepted to have been written by William Shakespeare were in fact written by Sir Francis Bacon. * \\"If Booth Had Missed Lincoln\\" by Milton Waldman: Booth's gun fails to fire at Ford's Theatre on April 14, 1865 and isn't able to kill Lincoln. He is later put in an insane asylum. Lincoln is charged with mismanaging the recently concluded Civil War, and there is repeated friction between Lincoln and a hostile United States Congress. Before Congress can impeach him in 1867, Lincoln dies, discredited and castigated as a spendthrift warmonger. Lincoln's role in this story is similar to that of his successor Andrew Johnson in real history. Revised edition A revised edition with the alternate title If: or, History Rewritten was also released by the American Viking Press in 1931, deleting the General Strike essay and adding one new essay along with reprints of two older but previously uncollected ones: * \\"If the Dutch Had Kept Nieuw Amsterdam\\" by Hendrik Willem van Loon. * \\"If: A Jacobite Fantasy\\" by Charles Petrie (1926): Charles Edward Stuart (\\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\") wins the Battle of Culloden in 1745, resulting in George II of England's exile to his ancestral home in Hanover, Germany. The \\"Old Pretender\\" (James Francis Edward Stuart) of the Stuart dynasty is restored to the British throne as \\"James III of England and VIII of Scotland\\", but proves conciliatory in terms of religion and government, and is a great patron of arts and entertainment. When \\"Charlie\\" succeeds his father as Charles III in 1766, his adroit diplomatic skills prevent the American Revolution through sharing his own dislike for the House of Commons with the American intelligentsia. Henry Benedict Stuart, who in this timeline did not enter the Catholic clergy, but instead married and had an heir, succeeds his childless brother in 1788 as \\"Henry IX of England and I of Scotland,\\" reigning until his death in 1807. In the 1920s his descendant reigns as \\"James VI of England and XI of Scotland.\\" \\"If: A Jacobite Fantasy\\" by Charles Petrie * \\"If Napoleon Had Won the Battle of Waterloo\\" by G. M. Trevelyan (1907): Following the titular event, the exhausted, demoralized British Empire becomes a reactionary dictatorship wracked with political instability, and harsh censorship which suppresses much of English Romanticism. France governs much of Europe, and Napoleon eventually dies of natural causes in 1836, by which time he is somewhat senile due to ennui, being ill suited to life in a peaceful world. See also Among many other works of alternate-history science fiction: *Bring the Jubilee (1953) by Ward Moore is one of the earliest popular novels of a world in which the Confederacy was successful in the American Civil War. *The Man in the High Castle (1962) by Philip K. Dick contains a subplot where a novel positing how the Allies could have won World War II is written by a man who lives in a world where they did not, analogous to the alternate-alternate history of Churchill's Gettysburg essay.

Early life Born in Cork, Ireland, Cagney was one of eight children in the family; he left home at age 15 because of difficulties with his father, who he described as a \\"remarkable man\\": an inventor, a musician, a welder, a mechanic, and a lecturer in electronics. Career Cagney learned how to take care of himself as a result of being on his own so early. He longed to have some musical ability, but settled for working with a variety of bands. He also learned about audio and audio studio processes; this got him a job as a shore-based radio operator. He devoted quite a bit of his paycheck to visiting night clubs; when a disk jockey did not show up for work, Cagney was asked to fill in, doing well enough at it to become a regular at the pirate radio station and now had two jobs. Before long, he was at RT√â Radio Cork. He joined RT√â in 1977, and was part of the original line-up of 2FM, broadcasting on its first night on air. During his time with 2FM, he called himself \\"Mark Anthony\\" and presented a variety of shows, from the seminal Night Train to the Drivetime show. In 1985 he won a Jacobs' Award for his midnight radio show. In 1989 he joined the new 98FM, staying there for seven years. He joined Today FM in 1998 and then joined TV3 Ireland. He won the TV Personality of the Year Award in 2005 at the 3rd Irish Film and Television Awards. he hosted the breakfast show Ireland AM on TV3 since it started in 1999. In July 2019, it was announced that Cagney would be leaving Ireland AM at the end of July after twenty years with the programme. On 31 July 2019 Cagney presented his last Ireland AM alongside Karen Koster and Alan Hughes. The show dedicated the last half hour of the show to him and aired a highlights reel. All the production crew, including Ciara Doherty who was on maternity leave at the time, came in to wish Cagney good luck on his future endeavours. Cagney has filled in for Ivan Yates on his Hard Shoulder, drive time radio show on Newstalk. Personal life He lives in Bayside, Dublin in north County Dublin with his second wife Audrey and their four children. His first wife, Ann, whom he met when he was 19, died of a brain haemorrhage; the couple had been married 11 years. When Ann died, Cagney was devastated; Audrey, who worked with him at 98 FM, provided emotional support which turned into love. When Cagney discovered he was having difficulty hearing, he went for testing; the results showed he had a hearing loss. He was fitted with a hearing aid, and in 2008, chose to make the information public. Cagney was a heavy user of cocaine in the 1980s.

Biography  Sigiswald Kuijken with a viola da spalla, 2008 Kuijken was born in Dilbeek, near Brussels. He was a member of the Alarius Ensemble of Brussels between 1964 and 1972 and formed La Petite Bande in 1972. Since 1971 he has taught Baroque violin at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague and the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. He is noted for using the older technique of resting the violin on the shoulder without a shoulder rest, rather than held under the chin. He is a member of the Kuijken String Quartet, which he formed in 1986. In recent years, he has also performed as conductor of symphonies of the Romantic era. His brothers are also known for historically informed performance: Barthold Kuijken is a flutist and recorder player and Wieland Kuijken, also a member of the Kuijken Quartet, is a cellist and gambist. They all have worked extensively with harpsichordist Gustav Leonhardt. On 2 February 2007 he was awarded the degree of Doctor Honoris Causa by the Catholic University of Leuven (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium).  Cantatas of J. S. Bach  Based on the results of research by Joshua Rifkin and Andrew Parrott on the authentic performance of Bach's masses, cantatas and passions, Sigiswald Kuijken limits the vocal part to a solo vocal quartet (which Bach himself sometimes extended to eight singers) instead of a choir. He also reduced the number of instrumentalists performing each cantata. Sigiswald Kuijken adopted this approach in his recording for Accent Records of a 19-part CD series entitled Cantatas of JS Bach (being recorded over the period of 2004‚Äì2012).

Most copies came complete with a two-sided printed sheet that was also produced by Dave Goodman: a mish-mash of lyrics in a typical Jamie Reid style, and a background made up of various phrases that play on the 'fake Pistols' theme of the band (for example: \\"Never Trust a Yuppie\\", \\"Hash From Chaos\\" and \\"Never Mind The Ollocks Here's The Ex Pistols\\", as opposed to \\"Never Trust a Hippy, \\"Cash From Chaos\\" and \\"Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols\\").

C. Penney (106,586 ft.2) and Marshalls. The oldest mall in metropolitan Tucson, El Con Mall, as it was known since its opening in 1960, was renamed in May 2014 at the time of its sale for $81.7 million to Stan Kroenke, owner of numerous sports properties including Arsenal F.C. and the Los Angeles Rams. History 1990s El Con Mall directory map El Con Mall opened in 1960‚Äì61 as the first mall in Tucson, Arizona, adjacent to the El Conquistador Hotel. Although initial plans called for the hotel to be part of the mall itself, these plans were later scrapped. An outdoor mall at the time of its opening (consisting of Stores #21-79 and 2 anchor spaces), El Con Mall was anchored by the local department store Levy‚Äôs,p53 and chain stores Montgomery Ward (February 2, 1961), Skaggs Drug Centers, Kresge‚Äôs,https://newspaperarchive.com/us/arizona/tucson/tucson-daily- citizen/1961/11-23/page-18 El Rancho Market, and Woolworth. Other tenants included House Of Fabrics, The College Shop, Mills-Touch√©, Lerner Shops, Kinney Shoes, El Con Cocktail Lounge, First National Bank Of Arizona, Daniel‚Äôs Credit Jewelers, Sandy‚Äôs Fashions, & Cele Peterson‚Äôs In 1967, the former El Conquistador Hotel space was demolished, and a new Levy‚Äôs store (opening on September 16, 1969), a J. C. Penney (1971), Stores #1-11, #101-106, & #110-124A & some mall space were built on the site, & east of it. Steinfeld‚Äôs moved from its historic 35 North Stone Avenue downtown location into Levy‚Äôs former store at the shopping center‚Äôs original portion‚Äôs NW corner. A new Goldwater‚Äôs (August 14, 1978) store and a 6-screen movie theatre (operated by AMC Theatres as early as January 1988) were built along a connecting link with stores #12-20A, & #80-100, and the entire shopping center was enclosed. Joseph Kivel and the Papanikolas brothers developed the El Con Mall. Joseph Kivel later opened another shopping mall, what is now Park Place, in 1975. After his death in 1995, his interest in both malls was left to his two sons. In 1996, Park Mall was sold to General Growth Properties. Skaggs Drug Centers was eventually bought out by Osco Drug no earlier than May 30, 1983, and no later than March 13, 1995. Steinfeld‚Äôs closed, and became a winter-time-only soup kitchen in 1984, & the Pavilion Food Court in 1993. Levy‚Äôs (which was owned by Federated Department Stores, Inc.) became Sanger-Harris in 1985, marking the first of several name changes in the mall's western anchor store. Sanger- Harris became Foley‚Äôs in 1987, and Robinsons-May February 2, 1997. Goldwater‚Äôs, in turn, became Dillard‚Äôs in 1989. The El Con location of Montgomery Ward‚Äôs closed in mid 2001. On June 4, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney will be closing around October 2020 as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide. After JCPenney closes, The Home Depot, Target, Burlington, Marshalls, Ross Dress for Less, and Walmart will be the remaining anchor stores left. Renovations Until the 2014 sale to Stan Kroenke, El Con Mall was still owned by the heirs of its original developers, Joseph Kivel and the Papanikolas brothers. Following the elder Kivel's demise in 1995, and the deaths of the Papanikolas brothers, their descendants began renovations on the mall. In mid-1998 the entire original wing (save Montgomery Ward), the mall space between Wards & the original wing, and the AMC El Con 6 Theatres (the latter of which had closed on September 1, 1997) were demolished, forcing Osco Drug to move from Store #54 to Store #123 and lose its status as an anchor. Subsequently, the Century El Con 20 Theatres (which became the Cinemark El Con 20 Theatres in 2006) was built on some removed parking space north of the eastern part of the original theatres and a food court was built on the sites of the western part of the original theatres and all of stores #12, 14 and 15, although no restaurants were ever opened in the food court. Additional plans promised \\"a unique variety of retail stores\\", but competition from larger malls, most notably Park Place, caused El Con to lose more stores than it gained. Dillard‚Äôs closed on May 9, 2000. It had decided to when Park Mall‚Äôs Dillard‚Äôs got a new building. Montgomery Ward was renamed Wards in 1997. On March 18, 2001, Montgomery Ward closed along with the company's bankruptcy. The Home Depot (2001) and Target (2003) were built on the east side of the mall, with the latter replacing Wards, Stores #80, #83, & #85, some mall space, as well as some parking space, and the former occupying part of the site of the demolished northeastern wing. The addition of these stores was considered controversial by local residents, many of whom did not want such big box retailers in the area. Neither Target nor The Home Depot was ever directly accessible from within the mall itself. Although many retailers and restaurants opened on the mall's periphery in the 2000s, the enclosed mall itself continued to lose tenants. In 2005, May Department Stores (then owners of the Robinsons-May name) was acquired by Macy's, Inc., who absorbed every one of May Department Stores‚Äô subsidiaries into Macy's in the following year. The Macy's store in El Con Mall was deemed unprofitable, and closed on February 29, 2008, shortly after the addition of a Ross Dress For Less store at part of the site previously occupied by the then recently demolished stores #110-124A. Later in 2008, it was announced that Walmart might move into the former Macy's building. Instead, Walmart built a new building, though, by municipal order, it was in the footprint of the old Macy's. In November 2009, Burlington Coat Factory announced it would open a new store at El Con Mall in the former Dillard‚Äôs space. The store opened on March 5, 2010. As of September 21, 2011 the mall space and all store spaces (except stores #1-6) were demolished and a pathway was built for access. Montgomery Ward's Tucson location was in operation until mid-2001. The store was vacated and liquidated in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The existing lease rights were purchased by the \\"Target\\" Federated Department Store Group - much to the chagrin of the existing ownership team.

He was the Prime Minister of Thailand and head of Thailand's interim government between 2006 and 2008. He is a former supreme commander of the Royal Thai Army and is currently Privy Councilor to King Vajiralongkorn. Surayud came from a military family, but his father defected from the Royal Thai Army to the Communist Party of Thailand when Surayud was a boy. Surayud joined the Thai Army and rose to power as an aide to General Prem Tinsulanonda. He commanded troops during Bloody May, the violent 1992 crackdown on anti-government protesters, but he denied giving his men the order to shoot protesters. He was promoted to army commander during the government of Chuan Leekpai and was promoted to supreme commander in 2003, under the government of Thaksin Shinawatra. Upon his retirement from the army, he was appointed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej to the Privy Council of Thailand. Surayud and Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda played a key role in the promotion of General Sonthi Boonratklin to the position of army commander. Sonthi overthrew the government of Shinawatra in a coup on 19 September 2006 and implored Surayud to be the head of interim government. Surayud's government was controversial. There was a significant worsening in perceived levels of corruption during his government.Transparency International, 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index Surayud's Deputy Finance Minister, Sommai Pasee, was sentenced to jail for abuse of power.The Nation, Convicted deputy finance minister resigns , 13 December 2007 Surayud raised the military budget by 35% and was accused of economic mismanagement, rampant human rights abuses, and flip-flopping on numerous policies.

He has been accused of forest reserve encroachment (a charge that was not investigated since the statute of limitations had run out by two years) and of illegally acquiring train carriages for display in his forest home. He is married to Chitravadi Santhadwet Chulanont () and has three sons, Captain Non, Khao, and Nam.  Family and education  Surayud came from a long line of military leaders. His maternal grandfather was Phraya Sri Sitthi Songkhram (Din Tharab), a royalist leader during the failed Boworadej Rebellion. Surayud's father was Lt. Colonel Phayom Chulanont, a Royal Thai Army military officer who, as \\"Comrade Too Khamtan\\" (), became a member of the Central Committee Communist Party of Thailand and Chief of Staff of the People's Liberation Army of Thailand.The Nation, Comrades-In-Arms: Their war gone by , 12 January 2006 Surayud completed his early education at Saint Gabriel's College and Suankularb Wittayalai School in Bangkok. He graduated from the inaugural class of Armed Forces Preparatory Academy. As a boy, Surayud's father left his family to go underground to join the Communists. Phayom explained his defection by citing corruption in the army and its inability to defend the powerless.Time Magazine, Surayud Chulanont: A soldier who answered to the people, 28 April 2003 His father's defection to the Communists had a large impact on Surayud. Surayud's son, Non, noted that, \\"My father always told me that we must help each other redeem the tarnished family name of Chulanont so that Thais can look up to it.\\" Matichon Weekly, \\"‡∏à‡∏≤‡∏Å '‡∏õ‡∏π‡πà‡∏û‡πÇ‡∏¢‡∏°' ‡∏ñ‡∏∂‡∏á '‡∏û‡πà‡∏¥‡∏≠‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏ò‡πå' '‡∏à‡∏∏‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏ó‡πå' ‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏ï‡∏≤ '‡∏£.‡∏≠.‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏ó‡πå' '‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏Ø‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏¢‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏ò‡πå' ‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏õ‡∏è‡∏¥‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏¥ ‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£\\" (\\"From 'Grandfather Phayom' to 'Father Surayud', 'Chulanont' in the Eyes of 'Captain Non', 'Premier Surayud' and Rebellion in the Eyes of the Son of a Soldier\\"), 15‚Äì21 December 2006 Surayud entered Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy (CRMA) and graduated from Class 12.

He conducted operations against the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT) while his father was a leader of the CPT. From 1972 to 1978, he was an instructor at the Special Warfare School. He was an aide to General Prem Tinsulanonda when Prem was appointed army commander and later Prime Minister of Thailand. Surayud was appointed Commander of the Special Warfare Command in 1992, where he was the commanding officer of Sonthi Boonratklin. Surayud Chulanont's official resume from the Royal Thai Army website During Bloody May, the violent crackdown 1992 on anti-government protesters, Surayud's men were seen at areas near the Royal Hotel, where protesters were seen being searched for weapons and later dragged into the hotel. He later claimed that he never gave orders for his soldiers to shoot.IHT, Thai junta shores up role in politics, 1 October 2006 According to a later interview, \\"It convinced me that the army should never be involved in politics.\\" Days later he told a national television audience that he deplored the loss of life and that he had not given any orders to shoot. In 1994, he was appointed commander of the 2nd Army Region. Surayud was promoted to army commander in late-1998. At the time, his promotion was controversial, as Surayud had been politically \\"shelved\\" at a staff position. To secure his vision of a politics-free army, Surayud appointed several of his classmates from Class 12 of the CRMA to key positions. Among these were Lt Gen Sompong Maivichit, who he made head of army-controlled Channel 5 television station, replacing Gen Pang Malakul na Ayudhya, and Lt Gen Boonrod Somtap, who he promoted to a key subordinate position to replace Gen Charn Boonprasert.The Nation, Editorial & Opinion: Surayuth guns for reforms, 18 February 1999 He also ended a policy of deporting Burmese refugees, especially ethnic Karens, back to Burma. \\"He's been a friend to us,\\" said Pastor Robert Htway of the Karen Refugee Committee. During his term, Thai soldiers took part in the United Nations Peace Keeping Force, assisting UN-PKF efforts in East Timor. To stop drug and drug cartels into Thailand, Surayud, in March 2002, ordered one of Thailand's largest military operations in recent times, when Thai troops moved deep into Myanmar territory to destroy drug labs and military bases controlled by the United Wa State Army.Asia Times, Unplugging Thailand, Myanmar energy deals, 14 November 2006 In 2003, after over four years as Army Commander, Surayud was promoted to the position of supreme commander, a loftier, but less influential, post, during the government of Thaksin Shinawatra. He was replaced as army commander by Somthad Attanan. His promotion was rumoured to be the result of a conflict with the prime minister, possibly over foreign policy towards Myanmar and the crackdown on drugs.  Privy councilor  On 14 November 2003, King Bhumibol Adulyadej appointed Surayud to his Privy Council of personal advisors. Several months later he asked the king for permission to ordain as a monk for a brief period at a forest temple in northeastern Thailand. Surayud and Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda had been perceived to have a key role in the promotion of General Sonthi Boonratklin to the position of army commander.The Statesman, Sonthi: The man who made it happen , 20 September 2006The Nation, Warning from Surayud: Thaksin's return 'a threat' , 28 September 2006 Facing an escalating insurgency in the south of Thailand, Surayud urged the media to paint a more positive picture of the violence. \\"Truthful words that may not be beneficial nor do any good to the public should be avoided\\", noted Surayud to the Press Council of Thailand. He was contradicted by Deputy Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisang, who noted that he couldn't think of any news about the conflict in the South that could or should not be reported by the media.The Nation, Media criticised over 'unhelpful news' , 4 July 2005 In response to numerous claims made by anti-Thaksin activist Sondhi Limthongkul that his People's Alliance for Democracy was \\"fighting for the King\\", Surayud responded by saying that, \\"Recent references to the monarchy were inappropriate.

Political disputes should be solved in a political way.\\"DPA, New Prime Minister a respected former army commander , 1 October 2006 In January 2008, not long after Surayud ended his term as prime minister, he was again reappointed to King Bhumibol Adulyadej's Privy Council.  Environmental protection  Surayud was chairman of the Khao Yai National Park Protection Foundation.Bangkok Post, New Highway Planned to Let Herds Mingle , 26 April 2004 However, after becoming premier in 2006, he was accused of breaching the Forestry Act and the National Forest Reserves Act by illegally owning forest land in Yaithiang Mountain of Nakhon Ratchasima Province. He vowed to resign and return the land (which he did not deny owning) if found guilty.The Nation, Activists call on Surayud to resign for alleged forest encroachment , 29 December 2006 In February 2010 after demonstrations by \\"Red Shirts\\" at Khao Yaithiang Mountain, Surayud, who by then had already left politics, returned the land to the Royal Forestry Department when it was found that the land was within forest reserve land under the ministry's decades old code. The plot of land is now under Royal Forestry Department's care. However, up until now no legal action has been taken by Thai authorities against him or other landowners of similar case around the country. Some opposition pressed him to resign from his post as privy councillor only as to understand later that Surayud \\"had no ill intention\\" and that it was highly inappropriate to ask for resignation of the post on such unreasonable ground.  Prime Minister of Thailand  Surayud (right) with George W. Bush at the National Conference Center in Hanoi Surayud was already considered a strong candidate for appointment as civilian prime minister premiership immediately after General Sonthi overthrew the government of Thaksin Shinawatra. Indeed, Surayud's appointment to the Premiership was confirmed by junta leader Sonthi Boonyaratkalin on the morning of Sunday 1 October 2006. After a couple imploring asks for Surayud to take the temporary premiership, Sonthi had a formal audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej at 4 pm that day to nominate Surayud's name to the monarch.The Nation, Sonthi to be granted an audience to nominate interim PM at 4 pm , 1 October 2006The Nation, Sonthi: Surayud to be PM , 1 October 2006 \\"Security and social unity\\" were cited by Sonthi as the key reasons for appointing Surayud.The Bangkok Post, Surayud's military past posed worry, 2 October 2006 Surayud announced that as premier, he would \\"Focus on self-sufficiency, more than focusing on the GDP numbers. I will focus on the happiness of the people, more than the GDP.\\"CNN, Former Thai army chief sworn in as interim PM, 1 October 2006 He also claimed that he would be \\"Friendly to every party, trying to receive information from every side and meeting people as much as possible. I will lead a government based on justice.\\" Due to influences from junta and those behind the scene, the policies and positions of several ministers in Surayud's cabinet changed very frequently, sometimes on a daily basis. Notable flip-flops included Thailand's refusal to share avian flu samples with the WHO, capital controls against foreign investment, shareholding limits for foreign investors in telecommunications firms, the identity of bombers in the 2006 New Year's Eve bombings, and the role of the Malaysian government in mediating the South Thailand insurgency. While he was prime minister, Surayud's wife, Colonel Khunying Chitrawadee, was awarded the Dame Grand Commander (Second Class) of the Most Illustrious Order of Chulachomklao feudal decoration, allowing her to use the prefix Than Phu Ying.Bangkok Post, PM's wife elevated to 'thanpuying', 6 May 2007  Popularity  Surayud (4th from left) at APEC Summit in Australia The Surayud government's initial nationwide approval rating in October 2006 stood at 60%, with 8% disapproving.

Only 24.6% thought that the situation would improve in six months.Poll: Thais lose trust in govt, CNS, 22 February 2007 By 24 February 2007, his popularity among Bangkokians had further dropped to 34.8%, although he was still more popular than Thaksin Shinawatra, whom 28.8% of Bangkokians favoured.The Nation, Surayud's popularity further drops , 25 February 2007 By 4 March 2007, only 31.3% of people in Bangkok supported the government's political stance. This fell dramatically to 12.5% by 26 March 2007.Bangkok Post, Protests did not enjoy wide support in Bangkok, 26 March 2007 Notably the main reason behind the drop was that people wanted to see quick changes in state policies and that actions and judgments for the ousted former Prime Minister were not forthcoming soon enough. The US government decided to continue holding \\"Cobra Gold\\" joint military exercises with the Thai government. Immediately after the coup, Washington had halted all military co-operation with, and aid to, the junta. US law forbade assistance to governments of a country where an elected leader has been deposed in a coup.Bangkok Post, Cobra Gold war games get green light, 19 February 2007 In early-May 2007, activists from the Assembly of Isaan People met with junta chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin in order to appeal for him to remove Surayud Chulanont.

Thai embassies were ordered not to facilitate his travels. Traditionally, all former prime ministers and foreign ministers of Thailand were permitted to hold on to their diplomatic passports for life.The Nation, FM cancel ousted premier and wife's diplomatic passports , 10 January 2007 Thaksin later publicly announced that he was quitting politics. Surayud's Defense Minister later announced that the junta would refuse Thaksin's reconciliation offer, claiming that Thailand was being threatened by \\"ill-intentioned people\\" and capitalism.Bangkok Post, General scorns Thaksin reconciliation , 3 February 2007 Surayud's government completely purged all senior military officers perceived as loyal to the Thaksin government, replacing them with officers trusted by the new regime.Bangkok Post, Sonthi loyalists put in key military positions, 22 March 2007 In April 2007, during an interview where reporters asked Surayud what he would say to Thaksin if he could meet him in person, Surayud responded, \\"I would say please don't ever come back.\\"The Nation, I want to tell Thaksin \\"don't ever come back,\\" : PM , 26 April 2007 Council for National Security The Surayud government allowed the Council for National Security to interfere with many government responsibilities, including the transfer of civil servants. The CNS was allowed to control a nationwide reshuffle of the civil service in April 2007 in order to weed out officials \\"clinging\\" to the deposed \\"Thaksin-regime\\".The Nation, Non- cooperative civil servants face axe by CNS , 9 January 2007 Surayud also authorised the removal of police chief Kowit Wattana from his position in early February 2007. Kowit had also been police chief under the ousted government of Thaksin Shinawatra. In March, junta leader Sonthi asked Surayud to declare emergency rule in Bangkok in response to the protests by the founders of People's Television. In an interview, Sonthi noted that the protests, attended by approximately 1,500-3,000 people, had so far been peaceful but that he was afraid the movement could lead to \\"mutiny and chaos in the country.\\"The Nation, Thai junta chief calls for emergency rule in Bangkok , 28 March 2007 CNS Spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd asked, \\"What will we do if the numbers of protesters go beyond 100,000? It will greatly damage the country's image.\\" Emergency powers allowed the government to ban public gatherings, impose curfews and censor local news reports.IHT, Thai coup leaders urge government to impose emergency rule, 28 March 2007 On 3 April 2007, Surayud approved a 15% pay rise (on top of an earlier 15% pay rise) for members of the CNS, as a \\"special reward\\" for their \\"honesty, tolerance and dedication on weekdays and weekends.\\"The Nation, Junta at risk of a backlash over lucrative benefits , 5 April 2007 Despite this, relations between Surayud and the CNS deteriorated. Rumours swirled in mid-April 2007 that the CNS would overthrow the government. However, in a meeting with the CNS President, Surayud declared, \\"Don't ever think of launching another coup. If you utter only one word, then I am ready to resign.\\"The Nation, Surayud survives barrage and hangs onto job by a thread , 13 April 2007 Criticism Besides being heavily criticised for gaining power through the 2006 coup and his subsequent actions as Premier, Surayud has been accused of forest encroachment and corruption. Forest encroachment Surayud was accused of breaching the Forestry Act and the National Forest Reserves Act by illegally owning forest reserve land in Yaithiang Mountain of Nakhon Ratchasima province. When Surayud was Commander of the 2nd Army Region, he was sold the plot of land for 50,000 baht. He later transferred ownership of the plot to his wife. Surayud vowed to resign and return the land (which he did not deny owning) if found guilty. He was defended by Interior Minister Aree Wongarya, who claimed, \\"Gen Surayud purchased the land from someone else so the question has to be posed to the first owner whether the land is reserved.\\" National Human Rights Commissioner and Thaksin sympathiser Jaran Ditthapichai noted, \\"I cannot agree to have someone call himself a man of morality and sufficiency if he built a fancy house in a forest reserve.\\"The Nation, Thumbs down for the next charter , 15 January 2007 However, the National Counter Corruption Commission (NCCC) refused to investigate the land encroachment charges, claiming that the statute of limitations on the case had run out. NCCC member Klanarong Chantik noted that Surayud retired from military service in 2003 whereas the charges were made 4 years after his retirement, and that the NCCC could not legally investigate an officer for alleged wrongdoing beyond two years after retirement.The Nation, NCCC rules against probe into Surayud's land , 22 June 2007 In February 2010 after demonstrations by the \\"Red Shirts\\" at Khao Yaithiang Mountain, Surayud returned the land to the Royal Forestry Department, without any removals of structures or plants, weeks before a formal notice from the department was issued. The plot of land is now under the care of the Royal Forestry Department after Surayud moved out. However, up until now no legal action has been taken by Thai authorities against Surayud or other landowners of similar type all over Thailand. Corruption Surayud, an avid collector of model trains, was accused of illegally acquiring four train compartments for his resort home in Kho Yaithiang mountain, Nakhon Ratchasima. Surayud claimed that he had more than 4 compartments, but they were all in his residence in Bangkok and were all models driven by household class electricity of 220V.The Nation, Surayud denies train carriages allegation , 28 December 2006 However, Thai-language newspaper Khaosod published a photo on the front page of its edition of 26 December 2006 which showed a building resembling a railway carriage near Surayud's resort home. The National Counter Corruption Committee was petitioned to scrutinise the land at Surayud's retreat residence, but refused to take action (see above). Before the end of his tenure as Prime Minister, Surayud invited dozens of reporters from various fields to visit and have a lunch at his disputed Kho Yaithiang home, where they realised that what seemed to be train carriages were only a resort building of his friend nearby viewed from a particular angle. While Surayud was frequently accused of corruption, many in the business community believed otherwise. A poll conducted in January 2007 found that 66% of business people thought that local corruption would increase, with only 10.5% thinking that it would decrease. However, only about 14% believed that leading figures in Surayud's administration were corrupt.The Nation, Business leaders see corruption increasing , 29 January 2007 Royal decorations Surayud has received the following royal decorations in the Honours System of Thailand: * 1974 - 80px Freemen Safeguarding Medal (First Class) * 1990 - 80px Rama Medal of the Honourable Order of Rama * 1992 - 80px Knight Grand Cordon (Special Class) of The Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand * 1995 - 80px Knight Grand Cordon (Special Class) of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant * 1996 - 80px Grand Companion (Third Class, higher grade) of the Most Illustrious Order of Chula Chom Klao References External links * News articles related to Thai Coup 2006 Further reading * Janes Defence Weekly, Interview with Gen Surayud Chulanont, 3 November 1999 * TIME Magazine, Asian heroes: Surayud Chulanont, 2003 * BBC News, Profile: Surayud Chulanont, 1 October 2006 * The Nation, Editorial questioning Surayud's judgement in reopening Don Muang Airport, 9 February 2007 Category:1943 births Category:Living people Surayud Chulanont Surayud Chulanont Surayud Chulanont Category:Leaders who took power by coup Surayud Chulanont Surayud Chulanont Surayud Chulanont Surayud Chulanont Category:People from Prachinburi Province Surayud Chulanont Category:Recipients of the Darjah Utama Bakti Cemerlang (Tentera) Surayud Chulanont ","title":"Surayud Chulanont"},{"id":"7154976","text":"Sandra Stotsky is Professor emerita in the Department of Education Reform at the University of Arkansas, and held the 21st Century Chair in Teacher Quality.

His work created new advances in marine technology including the FLIP Floating Instrument Platform, the Deep Tow vehicle for study of the sea floor, and the use of acoustics for underwater navigation and geodetic positioning. Spiess (pronounced SPEES) was born in Oakland, California. He received an undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley and a master's degree from Harvard University. He received his doctorate in physics from UC Berkeley in 1951. Spiess was awarded the John Price Wetherill Medal in 1965 and the Maurice Ewing Medal in 1983. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1985. He was a fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, and was awarded their Pioneers of Underwater Acoustics Medal in 1985 for \\"his leadership and insight in applying acoustics to study the ocean and the sea floor, for his many ingenious scientific and engineering contributions; for his introduction of students, scientists, and many others to underwater acoustics.\\" After graduating in 1941 from the University of California, Berkeley, he received a commission from the US Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. During World War II, he made a record 13 war patrols on submarines in the Pacific Ocean and was awarded Silver and Bronze Stars for gallantry in combat. He continued in the Naval Reserve from 1946‚Äì56 and retired with the rank of captain, serving as the Deputy Oceanographer of the Navy from 1969 to 1974. Spiess' method for reckoning the position of an object from successive sonar contacts is still a standard for training of US Naval Officers. Spiess joined the Marine Physical Laboratory at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1952 and served as director of the laboratory from 1958 to 1980. He served as director of the Scripps Institution from 1964 to 1965. R/P FLIP Spiess is probably best remembered for his role in the creation of R/P FLIP (Floating Instrument Platform), a unique 355-ft long research platform that is towed to the work area and then rotated to a vertical position to form a stable observation post in deep water. FLIP has remained in use for more than 40 years primarily for physical oceanographic and acoustic experiments. Spiess collaborated with Fred Fisher and Phillip Rudnick in development of the vessel. FLIP has been used to study the acoustics of whales and other marine mammals, heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere, and the effects of seismic waves on water. Deep-Tow The development of the echo sounder for sea-floor mapping was refined during World War II. Soon research ships crossing the oceans outlined the mid-ocean ridges, fracture zones, and deep-sea trenches. Because these devices sent out broad-beam sound waves from the sea surface, details of the sea floor shape remained obscured by fuzzy smeared out echoes. Ship navigation was so inaccurate that features smaller than a few kilometers across could not be mapped with any certainty. Spiess‚Äô solution to the resolution and mapping problem was twofold; bring the echo sounder close to the sea floor and locate the device within a seabed survey network. During the 1960s, Spiess and his engineers at the Marine Physical Laboratory of Scripps developed the deep-tow instrumentSpiess, F.N. and Type, R.C.. Marine Physical Laboratory Deep-Tow Instrumentation System. Mar. Phys. Lab., Scripps Inst. Ocean. ref. 73-4. 1973. for mapping the deep sea floor from an altitude of tens of meters. The deep- tow instrument used a narrow-beam downward-looking echosounder, side-looking sonars, and subbottom profiling system to map features in unprecedented detail, e.g., geologic observations that approached that of outcrop mapping for land geologists. Evolution of the deep-tow to improve sea-floor mapping saw the addition of a magnetometer, cameras, video, water samplers, plankton nets, and other instruments as more varied seafloor environments were examined. The Deep-Tow instrument was notably used in Project FAMOUS, the first-ever geologic mapping of the median rift valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Acoustic transponders Spiess recognized that obtaining detailed images of the sea floor was only one component that is necessary for making geologic maps of the deep-sea floor. The position of the deep-tow vehicle must be known to within a few meters, thus leading to the development of the first sea-floor acoustic-transponder positioning system for working in deep water. The acoustic transponder capability eventually evolved into instruments for acoustic geodetic measurements by combining the technologies of seafloor acoustic beacons with shipboard GPS positioning. This geodetic system has been successfully deployed for directly measuring the direction of movement and speed of the oceanic Juan de Fuca lithospheric plate and for documenting movement on submarine landslides. RISE expedition and black smoker hydrothermal vents During the mid 1970s, several deep-tow cruises to the mouth of the Gulf of California at 21o N resulted in production of a geologic map of the East Pacific Rise (EPR) spreading ridge axis. The map was then used as the base for conducting diving programs using both French and US manned submersibles. These were the CYAMEXFrancheteau, J. and CYAMEX Science Team, Massive deep-sea sulphide ore deposits discovered on the East Pacific Rise. Nature, 277, 523, 1979. and RISE expeditions;F. N.

Science, 207: 1421-1444, 1980. the latter led by Spiess and Ken Macdonald. One of Spiess' projects during the RISE expedition (with Bruce Luyendyk) was to use the manned submersible ALVIN for seafloor gravity measurements across the axis of spreading. The diving expedition ultimately resulted in the discovery of high temperature black-smoker vents for which Spiess and his coauthors received the Newcomb Cleveland Prize for the best paper published in Science magazine in 1980.

The square is graced by the equestrian Monument to Nicholas I. The Lobanov- Rostovsky House (1817‚Äì20) on the west side of the square was designed by Auguste de Montferrand. It may be described as an Empire style building that has an eight-column portico facing the Admiralty building. The main porch features the twin statues of Medici lions on granite pedestals; they were made famous by Pushkin in his last long poem, The Bronze Horseman. Nearby is Quarenghi's Horse Guards' Riding Hall (1804‚Äì07), in part inspired by the Parthenon and flanked by the marble statues of the Dioscuri, by Paolo Triscornia. Opposite the cathedral is the Mariinsky Palace, built in 1829-1844 for Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna. Currently the palace houses the Saint Petersburg Legislative Assembly. In front of the palace is the 97-metre-wide Blue Bridge, which used to be the widest in Saint Petersburg. Spanning the Moika River, the bridge is usually perceived as the extension of the square, although in fact it forms a separate square, called Mariyinskaya. To the right from the bridge is so-called Neptune's Scale, with a granite top. This is a stele which marks water levels during major floods. To the east of the cathedral is the six-storey Hotel Astoria, designed by Fyodor Lidval. It opened in 1912 and was one of the most luxurious hotels in the Russian Empire.William C Brumfield. Landmarks of Russian Architecture. Routledge (UK), 1997. . pp. 217-218. Adjacent to the Astoria is the hotel Angleterre, which is remembered as the deathplace of poet Sergei Yesenin. The building found at the corner of Malaya Morskaya StreetCorner of Malaya Morskaya Street, 23 and Voznesensky avenue, 8 is associated with Fyodor Dostoyevsky, who lived there in 1848-1849. At this period, he published his first work of fiction, White Nights. The Russian Institute of Plant Breeding named after Academician Nikolai Vavilov is located in two neo-Renaissance buildings. The institute has a unique collection of 160,000 cultivated plants, which Vavilov collected while travelling in every continent from 1921 to 1940. After the end of the war, a journal published in London reported that Vavilov's collection was lost during the Siege of Leningrad. However, the report was false: although many starved to death, the institute's staff would not consume a single grain of rice or potato tuber from the collection.Online guide to St. Petersburg One of the last buildings to be erected on the square was the trapezoidal red- granite German Embassy (1911‚Äì12), by the architect Peter Behrens. The building is a reference point in the history of Western architecture, as it was the first specimen of Stripped Classicism, a style that enjoyed immense popularity in Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2004, article \\"History of Western architecture\\".

Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are produced by plants as a defense mechanism against insect herbivores. More than 660 PAs and PA N-oxides have been identified in over 6,000 plants, and about half of them exhibit hepatotoxicity. They are found frequently in plants in the Boraginaceae, Asteraceae, Orchidaceae and Fabaceae families; less frequently in the Convolvulaceae and Poaceae, and in at least one species in the Lamiaceae. It has been estimated that 3% of the world‚Äôs flowering plants contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Honey can contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, as can grains, milk, offal and eggs. To date (2011), there is no international regulation of PAs in food, unlike those for herbs and medicines.German Commission E monographs Unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids are hepatotoxic, that is, damaging to the liver. PAs also cause hepatic veno-occlusive disease and liver cancer. PAs are tumorigenic. Disease associated with consumption of PAs is known as pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis. Of concern is the health risk associated with the use of medicinal herbs that contain PAs, notably borage leaf, comfrey and coltsfoot in the West, and some Chinese medicinal herbs. Some ruminant animals, for example cattle, showed no change in liver enzyme activities or any clinical signs of poisoning when fed plants containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Yet Australian studies have demonstrated toxicity Sheep, goats and cattle are much more resistant and tolerate much higher PA dosages, thought to be due to thorough detoxification via PA-destroying rumen microbes. Males react more sensitively than females and fetuses and children. PA is also used as a defense mechanism for some organisms such as Utetheisa ornatrix. Utetheisa ornatrix caterpillars obtain these toxins from their food plants and use them as a deterrent for predators. PAs protect them from most of their natural enemies. The toxins stay in these organisms even when they metamorphose into adult moths, continuing to protect them throughout their adult stage.Conner, W.E. (2009). Tiger Moths and Woolly Bears‚Äîbehaviour, ecology, and evolution of the Arctiidae. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 1-10. Ecology Many plants contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids, and in turn there are many insects which consume the plants and build up the alkaloids in their bodies. For example, male queen butterflies utilize pyrrolizidine alkaloids to produce pheromones useful for mating. The butterfly Danaus chrysippus is known to obtain pyrrolizidine alkaloids in their diet and store these chemicals, making them toxic and unpalatable to predators. Greta oto, the glasswing butterfly, uses pyrrolizidine alkaloids for both toxicity in the adult moth and pheromone production in the male butterfly. The garden tiger moth also stores these compounds as a caterpillar, using them for larval (through the use of spines) and adult defense (in the form of a spray and bad taste).

Foothills Mall features over 2 stores and outlets for consumers and/or tourists, along with 1 restaurant and the AMC Theatres Foothills 15. History Opened in 1982 as a small upscale mall, Foothills Mall originally including Goldwater's (102,939 ft.2) and Levy's (103,429 ft.2) as its anchors, as well as the Plitt Foothills 4 Cinemas. In 1985, Levy's became Sanger-Harris and in 1987, Foley's. In 1988, Foothills 4 Cinemas became Cineplex Odeon Foothills 7 Cinemas while Goldwater's became Dillard's in 1989. Both Dillard's and Foley's closed in 1994, as they were overlapped at nearby Tucson Mall. By the mid-1990s, Foothills Mall was finding little support for its upscale niche and was largely vacant. The mall was re- tenanted as an ancillary/outlet oriented mall, with Barnes & Noble and Saks Fifth Avenue's Off Fifth outlet opening in the former Dillard's space. Meanwhile, a Ross Dress for Less, Linens ‚ÄòN‚Äô Things, and Nike Factory Store moved into the former Foley's, and the Cineplex Odeon Foothills 7 Cinemas was given 8 new screens. A standalone Walmart Supercenter was also added in the mid-1990s, as well as new stores on the perimeter of the property. The Cineplex Odeon Foothills 15 Cinemas became Loews Cineplex Foothills 15 Theatres in 1998, and AMC Loews Foothills 15 Theatres in 2005. After nearly two decades of experiencing success with the outlet mall concept, Foothills Mall faced difficulty in 2016 retaining tenants after the opening of the Tucson Premium Outlets in nearby Marana. Within six months of the outdoor mall opening, major tenants Saks Fifth Avenue's Off Fifth outlet, Old Navy's Outlet, Hanes and Nike Factory Store closed or announced plans to close their existing Foothills Mall locations in favor of a store at Tucson Premium Outlets. Tenants including Bath and Body Works, American Eagle Outfitters and a 15-screen AMC Loews Theaters / IMAX Theater, alongside Applebee's and Outback Steakhouse on the perimeter of the mall remain open.

Though no major battles were fought in New Jersey, soldiers and volunteers from New Jersey played an important part in the war, including Philip Kearny and George B. McClellan, who led the Army of the Potomac early in the Civil War and unsuccessfully ran for President of the United States in 1864 against his former commander-in-chief, Abraham Lincoln. Slavery and prelude to war The Quaker population of New Jersey was especially intolerant of slavery. However, New Jersey ended up becoming the last of the northern states to abolish slavery by enacting legislation which caused the slow abolishment of slavery. Though New Jersey passed an act for the gradual abolition of slavery in 1804, it wasn't until 1830 that most blacks were free in the state. However, by the close of the Civil War, about a dozen African-Americans in New Jersey were still apprenticed freedmen. New Jersey at first refused to ratify the Constitutional Amendments that banned slavery. New Jersey was a major part of the extensive Underground Railroad system. Civil War George B. McClellan. On May 4, 1861, in a response to President Abraham Lincoln's call to arms the U.S. War Department directed New Jersey to fill a quota of three infantry regiments to serve a three-year term of enlistment. Recruitment took place for the new regiments all over the state, and on May 21, the 1st New Jersey Volunteer Infantry was mustered into the Union Army at Camp Olden in Trenton under Maj. Theodore T. S. Laidley of the United States Regular Army. The 9th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, under Col. Joseph W. Allen at Camp Olden, was the last New Jersey regiment to leave the state in 1861 but the first committed to battle. Additional regiments were raised throughout the war, including cavalry and artillery. No battles took place within New Jersey throughout the course of the Civil War. However, over 88,000 soldiers from New Jersey were part of several infantry and cavalry regiments. In total, 52 regiments were created by New Jersey soldiers during this war. 23,116 of those soldiers served in the Army of the Potomac. Soldiers from New Jersey fought generally in the Eastern theater of the Civil WarNew Jersey in the Civil War , retrieved December 18, 2005. Over 6,000 soldiers from New Jersey lost their lives in the war. Philip Kearny, an officer from the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, led a brigade of New Jersey regiments under Brigadier General William B. Franklin. Kearny distinguished himself as a brilliant officer during the Peninsula Campaign, and was promoted to the rank of major general. Another notable officer from New Jersey was Major General Gershom Mott, from Trenton. He served as brigade and division commander and temporarily led the II Corps. Major General Hugh Judson Kilpatrick was one of the first officers to be wounded in the war. He infamously fought in the Battle of Gettysburg and served as Sherman's cavalry leader in the Atlanta Campaign. After the war he served as ambassador to Chile. Colonel Harvey Brown, of Clark, was a veteran of the regular army. He served to great success in Florida and initially commanded the defences during the New York Draft Riots. Brigadier Generals from New Jersey include George W. Taylor, Charles A. Heckman, Joseph W. Revere, Charles G. Harker and Theodore Runyon. On 24 March 1863, the New Jersey legislature passed a resolution that included many aspects of the situation caused by the war. Some of the aspects were:Acts of the Eighty- seventh Legislature of the State of New Jersey and Sixteenth Under the New Constitution. Newark, NJ: E. N. Fuller, Daily Journal Office, 1863, pp. 510-513. New Jersey was one of the few states to vote for Stephen Douglas instead of Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election. The people of New Jersey also gave its electoral votes to George McClellan when he ran for president against Lincoln in the election of 1864, being the only free state that rejected Lincoln twice. McClellan later became the governor of New Jersey, from 1878 to 1881. Many cities like Paterson and Camden, grew extremely strong through the duration of the Civil War. They produced many necessities, including clothing and war materials like ammunition. These cities prospered through constant production even after the end of the war. Cities like those of Paterson and Camden became crucial to the Northern war effort. With the Union's ability to manufacture more supplies, the Union was able to defeat the Confederates and successfully conclude the war and reunite the country.Stewart, Mark (2004).

They are a fundamental structure in Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke's categorical quantum mechanics.Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke, A categorical semantics of quantum protocols, Proceedings of the 19th IEEE conference on Logic in Computer Science (LiCS'04). IEEE Computer Science Press (2004).S. Abramsky and B. Coecke, Categorical quantum mechanics\\". In: Handbook of Quantum Logic and Quantum Structures, K. Engesser, D. M. Gabbay and D. Lehmann (eds), pages 261‚Äì323. Elsevier (2009).Abramsky and Coecke used the term strongly compact closed categories, since a dagger compact category is a compact closed category augmented with a covariant involutive monoidal endofunctor. Overview Dagger compact categories can be used to express and verify some fundamental quantum information protocols, namely: teleportation, logic gate teleportation and entanglement swapping, and standard notions such as unitarity, inner-product, trace, Choi-Jamiolkowsky duality, complete positivity, Bell states and many other notions are captured by the language of dagger compact categories. All this follows from the completeness theorem, below. Categorical quantum mechanics takes dagger compact categories as a background structure relative to which other quantum mechanical notions like quantum observables and complementarity thereof can be abstractly defined. This forms the basis for a high-level approach to quantum information processing. Formal definition A dagger compact category is a dagger symmetric monoidal category \\\\mathbf{C} which is also compact closed, together with a relation to tie together the dagger structure to the compact structure. Specifically, the dagger is used to connect the unit to the counit, so that, for all A in \\\\mathbf{C}, the following diagram commutes: 240px To summarize all of these points: * A category is closed if it has an internal hom functor; that is, if the hom-set of morphisms between two objects of the category is an object of the category itself (rather than of Set). * A category is monoidal if it is equipped with an associative bifunctor \\\\mathbf{C} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{C} that is associative, natural and has left and right identities obeying certain coherence conditions. * A monoidal category is symmetric monoidal, if, for every pair A, B of objects in C, there is an isomorphism \\\\sigma_{A, B}: A \\\\otimes B \\\\simeq B \\\\otimes A that is natural in both A and B, and, again, obeys certain coherence conditions (see symmetric monoidal category for details). * A monoidal category is compact closed, if every object A \\\\in \\\\mathbf{C} has a dual object A^*. Categories with dual objects are equipped with two morphisms, the unit \\\\eta_A:I\\\\to A^*\\\\otimes A and the counit \\\\varepsilon_A:A\\\\otimes A^*\\\\to I, which satisfy certain coherence or yanking conditions. * A category is a dagger category if it is equipped with an involutive functor \\\\dagger\\\\colon \\\\mathbf{C}^{op}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbf{C} that is the identity on objects, but maps morphisms to their adjoints. * A monoidal category is dagger symmetric if it is a dagger category and is symmetric, and has coherence conditions that make the various functors natural. A dagger compact category is then a category that is each of the above, and, in addition, has a condition to relate the dagger structure to the compact structure. This is done by relating the unit to the counit via the dagger: :\\\\sigma_{A, A^*} \\\\circ\\\\varepsilon^\\\\dagger_A = \\\\eta_A shown in the commuting diagram above. In the category FdHilb of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, this last condition can be understood as defining the dagger (the Hermitian conjugate) as the transpose of the complex conjugate. Examples The following categories are dagger compact. * The category FdHilb of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces and linear maps. The morphisms are linear operators between Hilbert spaces. The product is the usual tensor product, and the dagger here is the Hermitian conjugate. * The category Rel of Sets and relations. The product is, of course, the Cartesian product. The dagger here is just the opposite. * The category of finitely generated projective modules over a commutative ring. The dagger here is just the matrix transpose. * The category nCob of cobordisms. Here, the n-dimensional cobordisms are the morphisms, the disjoint union is the tensor, and the reversal of the objects (closed manifolds) is the dagger. A topological quantum field theory can be defined as a functor from nCob into FdHilb.M. Atiyah, \\"Topological quantum field theories\\". Inst. Hautes Etudes Sci. Publ. Math. 68 (1989), pp. 175‚Äì186. * The category Span(C) of spans for any category C with finite limits. Infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not dagger compact, and are described by dagger symmetric monoidal categories. Structural theorems Selinger showed that dagger compact categories admit a Joyal-Street style diagrammatic languageP. Selinger, Dagger compact closed categories and completely positive maps, Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Quantum Programming Languages, Chicago, June 30 - July 1 (2005). and proved that dagger compact categories are complete with respect to finite dimensional Hilbert spacesP. Selinger, Finite dimensional Hilbert spaces are complete for dagger compact closed categories, Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Quantum Programming Languages, Reykjavik (2008).M. Hasegawa, M. Hofmann and G. Plotkin, \\"Finite dimensional vector spaces are complete for traced symmetric monoidal categories\\", LNCS 4800, (2008), pp. 367‚Äì385. i.e. an equational statement in the language of dagger compact categories holds if and only if it can be derived in the concrete category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces and linear maps. There is no analogous completeness for Rel or nCob. This completeness result implies that various theorems from Hilbert spaces extend to this category. For example, the no-cloning theorem implies that there is no universal cloning morphism.S. Abramsky, \\"No-Cloning in categorical quantum mechanics\\", (2008) Semantic Techniques for Quantum Computation, I. Mackie and S. Gay (eds), Cambridge University Press Completeness also implies far more mundane features as well: dagger compact categories can be given a basis in the same way that a Hilbert space can have a basis. Operators can be decomposed in the basis; operators can have eigenvectors, etc.. This is reviewed in the next section.  Basis The completeness theorem implies that basic notions from Hilbert spaces carry over to any dagger compact category. The typical language employed, however, changes. The notion of a basis is given in terms of a coalgebra. Given an object A from a dagger compact category, a basis is a comonoid object (A,\\\\delta,\\\\varepsilon). The two operations are a copying or comultiplication Œ¥: A ‚Üí A ‚äó A morphism that is cocommutative and coassociative, and a deleting operation or counit morphism Œµ: A ‚Üí I . Together, these obey five axioms: Comultiplicativity: :(1_A \\\\otimes \\\\varepsilon) \\\\circ \\\\delta =1_A = (\\\\varepsilon \\\\otimes 1_A) \\\\circ \\\\delta Coassociativity: :(1_A \\\\otimes \\\\delta) \\\\circ \\\\delta = (\\\\delta \\\\otimes 1_A) \\\\circ \\\\delta Cocommutativity: :\\\\sigma_{A,A} \\\\circ \\\\delta = \\\\delta Isometry: :\\\\delta^\\\\dagger \\\\circ \\\\delta = 1_A Frobenius law: :(\\\\delta^\\\\dagger \\\\otimes 1_A) \\\\circ (1_A \\\\otimes \\\\delta) = \\\\delta \\\\circ \\\\delta^\\\\dagger To see that these relations define a basis of a vector space in the traditional sense, write the comultiplication and counit using bra‚Äìket notation, and understanding that these are now linear operators acting on vectors |j\\\\rangle in a Hilbert space H: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\delta : H &\\\\to H\\\\otimes H \\\\\\\\\\\\ |j\\\\rangle & \\\\mapsto |j\\\\rangle\\\\otimes |j\\\\rangle = |j j \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} and :\\\\begin{align} \\\\varepsilon : H &\\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\\\\\\\\\ |j\\\\rangle & \\\\mapsto 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} The only vectors |j\\\\rangle that can satisfy the above five axioms must be orthogonal to one-another; the counit then uniquely specifies the basis. The suggestive names copying and deleting for the comultiplication and counit operators come from the idea that the no-cloning theorem and no- deleting theorem state that the only vectors that it is possible to copy or delete are orthogonal basis vectors.  General results Given the above definition of a basis, a number of results for Hilbert spaces can be stated for compact dagger categories. We list some of these below, taken fromBob Coecke, \\"Quantum Picturalism\\", (2009) Contemporary Physics vol 51, pp59-83. (ArXiv 0908.1787) unless otherwise noted. * A basis can also be understood to correspond to an observable, in that a given observable factors on (orthogonal) basis vectors. That is, an observable is represented by an object A together with the two morphisms that define a basis: (A, \\\\delta, \\\\varepsilon). * An eigenstate of the observable (A, \\\\delta, \\\\varepsilon) is any object \\\\psi for which ::\\\\delta \\\\circ \\\\psi = \\\\psi \\\\otimes \\\\psi :Eigenstates are orthogonal to one another. * An object \\\\psi is complementary to the observable (A, \\\\delta, \\\\varepsilon) if ::\\\\delta^\\\\dagger \\\\circ (\\\\overline\\\\psi \\\\otimes \\\\psi) = \\\\varepsilon^\\\\dagger :(In quantum mechanics, a state vector \\\\psi is said to be complementary to an observable if any measurement result is equiprobable. viz. an spin eigenstate of Sx is equiprobable when measured in the basis Sz, or momentum eigenstates are equiprobable when measured in the position basis.) * Two observables (A, \\\\delta_X, \\\\varepsilon_X) and (A, \\\\delta_Z, \\\\varepsilon_Z) are complementary if ::\\\\delta^\\\\dagger_Z \\\\circ \\\\delta_X = \\\\varepsilon_Z \\\\circ \\\\varepsilon_X^\\\\dagger * Complementary objects generate unitary transformations.

The \\"manifesto\\" was submitted to the Direction Bureau of the PCI with the intent of initiating an internal debate on the Budapest events. It was leaked to the press and provoked a brutal reaction by the Party's leadership and the Direction Bureau; any debate attempt was rejected while the document's authors, labelled as \\"traitors\\", were threatened with heavy political consequences. First worried by the public diffusion of the \\"manifesto\\" then more seriously intimidated by the Party leadership's reaction, a few of the signatories retracted their adhesion while others, who refused to do so, resigned. MP Antonio Giolitti left the following year, in 1957. This episode of dissent was followed by a more general re-thinking on the legitimacy of Communism and its compatibility with democracy and intellectual freedom. Among the Manifesto's promoters, some (Cafagna, De Felice, Sirugo, Colletti) ended up, although at different stages, cutting ideological ties with Communism.

Carnell is heading out to a party where he drinks with his friends, but begins experiencing what feels like electrical shocks and starts having convulsions.

In the hospital, he later suffers from sphincter paralysis, which, combined with his other symptoms usually indicates Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, but the tests do not support their theory.

Carnell's ability to produce white blood cells is severely compromised because of the radiation poisoning, and he will need a bone marrow transplant. He also has a tumor inside his cervical spine, revealed by a PET scan. They successfully remove the tumor, but he has a hemorrhage in his bowel after the surgery.

The fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) is based on admonitions in the Quran for Muslims to be ritually clean whenever possible, as well as in hadith literature (words, actions, or habits of the Islamic prophet Muhammad). Cleanliness is an important part of Islam, including Quranic verses that teach how to achieve ritual cleanliness. Keeping oral hygiene through cleaning the teeth with the use of a form of toothbrush called miswak is considered sunnah, the way of Prophet Muhammad. Ritual ablution is also very important, as observed by the practices of wudu, ghusl, and tayammum (water-free alternative using any natural surface such as rock, sand, or dust). In Muslim-majority countries, bathrooms are often equipped with a bidet. This ablution is required in order to maintain ritual cleanliness. The common Muslims practice of taking off shoes when entering mosques and homes is also based on ritual cleanliness. Islamic cleanliness and hygiene Sunni Islam has its own hygienical jurisprudence. It is preferable for a Sunni Muslim to remove the hair directly below the navel and under the arms also as trimming the nails once a week. Leaving hair and nails is permissible after 15 days and disliked after 40 days. The best day for removing needless hair and cutting nails is Friday. It is permissible to use shaving cream to remove needless hair. Needless hair and nails should be buried to prevent illnesses from spreading. Cutting eyebrows is permissible if they are too long. Sunni women should put their nails and hair removed from the head, below the navel, and under the arms in a place where no non-permissible men can see it. Personal grooming is also a matter of focus in Islam, and comprises all the ritual purity practices known as fitra. Allowing a beard to grow while trimming the moustache is emphasized with it being seen as mandatory by all respected Sunni scholars from the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence. Islamic dietary laws Islamic dietary laws provide a set of rules as to what Muslims eat in their diet. These rules specify the food that is halƒÅl, meaning lawful. They are found in the Quran, usually detailing what is unlawful, or harƒÅm. Islamic genital hygiene Removal of pubic hair and armpit hair is prescribed by the sunnah, and is listed among the ritual purity practices known as fitra. Urine is forbidden to be on a Muslim during prayer times, as it is dirty. The foreskin is a possible spot where urine can accumulate. Circumcision is used to prevent this. Islamic toilet etiquette The Islamic faith has particular rules regarding personal hygiene when going to the toilet. This code is known as Qadaahul Haajah. Issues of laterality, such as whether one uses the left or right hand and the foot used to step into or out of toilet areas, are derived from hadith sources. The only issue which the Qur'an mentions is the one of washing one's hands especially after using the toilet which is mentioned in verse 5:6. Examples of these rules include, but are not limited to: * It is strongly discouraged to relieve oneself into flowing water. * It is preferable to step into the bathroom with the left foot and step outside the bathroom with the right foot. * One should remain silent whilst on the toilet. Talking, answering greetings or greeting others is disliked. * One should not face nor turn one's back on Qibla (the direction Muslims face to pray) whilst relieving oneself. * When leaving the toilet one should say , \\"O Allah! Bestow your forgiveness upon me.\\" * Use of toilet paper is acceptable, but washing with water is still needed for purity and to minimize germs present in feces from touching the skin. Islamic sexual hygiene Sexual hygiene in Islam is a prominent topic in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) due to its everyday nature. explains:Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Dur al-Mukhtar > When there is discharge of thick, cloudy white fluid (wady) (that exits > before or after urinating) or unlustful discharge of thin, sticky, white > fluid (madhy) caused by play or kissing, it requires washing the private > parts and wudu. Regarding things that necessitates ghusl: #sperm or female ejaculate that leaves its place of origin with desire [f: whether actual or effective], even if it exits the body without desire, even if without sexual intercourse; #the head of the penis entering either private part of a living human being who is fit for sexual intercourse, even without any release of sexual fluids‚Ä¶‚Äù After partaking in sexual activity where penetration or ejaculation occurs, both men and women are required to complete a full-body ritual ablution known as ghusl in order to re-establish ritual purity before prayer. Ghusl requires clean, odorless water that has not been used for a previous ritual and begins with the declaration of the intention of purity and worship. A Muslim performing complete ablution then washes every part of his or her body.

It is set in Pacific Grove, California, and on Basidium, a tiny habitable moon of Earth, invisible from the planet in its orbit 50,000 miles away. The \\"Mushroom Planet\\", visited by the protagonists David Topman and Chuck Masterson, is covered in various types of mushrooms and is populated by little green people who are in a state of distress. The Wonderful Flight was published under the Atlantic Monthly Press imprint of Little, Brown in September 1954, and it received a starred review from Kirkus Reviews. Plot summary When two boys find an ad in a newspaper asking for two young boys to build a spaceship, they quickly construct one out of old tin and scrap wood (including the hull of a derelict rowboat), and bring it to the advertiser. This man is the mysterious Mr. Tyco Bass, an inventor and scientist. Using his marvelous stroboscopic polarizing filter he shows the boys a previously undetected satellite of the Earth, which he calls Basidium-X. He refits their spaceship, giving them some special fuel he invented to power it, and tells them to fly to the mushroom planet (after getting their parents' permission). He warns them that their trip will only be successful if they bring a mascot. When it is time for launch, they grab David's hen, Mrs. Pennyfeather, at the last moment for a mascot, and rocket into space. They find the planet of Basidium to be a small, verdant world covered in soft moss and tree-size mushrooms. They quickly meet some residents of the mushroom planet, small men with large heads and slightly green skin, of the same people as the mysterious Mr. Bass. They tell the boys that their planet has had a crisis and that everyone is slowly dying of a mysterious sickness. The boys meet up with the king of the planet, the Great Ta, and end up solving the natives' problem before returning to Earth.

It was written primarily by guitarist Tom DeLonge, with additional songwriting credit to bassist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Scott Raynor. The song's narrative portrays a lustful couple. DeLonge penned the track for his friend, the professional surfer Benji Weatherly. The band first recorded the song for Weatherly's appearance in the 1998 surf film The Show, prior to Raynor's exit from the group. The song was later re- recorded with drummer Travis Barker and included on the band's 1999 album, Enema of the State. This edition had a prominent placement on the soundtrack for the 1999 film American Pie; the song plays during a memorable scene in which the main character attempts to woo a foreign exchange student. A 2016 Rolling Stone reader's poll ranked \\"Mutt\\" among the trio's fans' favorite tunes. Background Guitarist Tom Delonge wrote the song for a surfer friend. \\"Mutt\\" was written primarily by guitarist Tom DeLonge. \\"Mutt\\" was written for DeLonge's friend and former roommate, surfer Benji Weatherly. The two lived together in Pacific Beach, California for three years in the mid-1990s; an editorialist for Men's Journal described the duo's reputation for \\"wine, women, and song\\" as the stuff of \\"local lore\\". Weatherly was known as \\"Mutt\\" among friends, a nickname co-created by musician Jack Johnson, and his popularity among women inspired the song. \\"It's just a song about a guy and a girl who like to have sex and who don't really care about much of anything else,\\" DeLonge said in 2000. The song soundtracks Weatherly's appearance in the Taylor Steele surf film The Show (1998). \\"Mutt\\" tells the story of a popular, affluent, amorous couple. The narrator possesses a \\"loathsome\\" view of their behavior, which Billboard contributor Chris Payne describes as acting as though \\"they're in constant audition for a porn flick.\\" The song opens with a drum fill, followed by a bass riff from Hoppus that alternates between the chords A5 and D5. DeLonge begins the first verse by introducing the male character, purportedly inspired by Weatherly: \\"He pauses shaving and he tells himself that he is the bomb.\\" According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, \\"Mutt\\" is written in common time with a tempo of 212 beats per minute, and is set in the key of A major. DeLonge's vocal parts span from G4 to E5. Recording and production An early version of \\"Mutt\\", with original Blink percussionist Scott Raynor behind the drum kit, was recorded with producer Mark Trombino and appears on The Show 1998 soundtrack. It was recorded at Big Fish Studios, a studio the band had previously utilized when recording their 1997 album Dude Ranch with Trombino. The band later that year re-approached \\"Mutt\\" with producer Jerry Finn and drummer Travis Barker, who replaced Raynor midway through a 1998 tour. The band had signed on to make a cameo appearance in the upcoming teen film American Pie, then in pre-production and titled East Great Falls High. DeLonge and Hoppus had read the film's screenplay and found it hilarious. The trio recruited Jerry Finn, a veteran punk producer who had worked with Green Day, to record a new version of \\"Mutt\\". They were impressed with his production and mixing work, which they viewed as \\"phenomenal\\", and hired him to produce their next album, Enema of the State. Drummer Travis Barker receives no songwriting credit, as he was considered a touring musician at this point in their career. He later grew to dislike the song's final recording, as he was very new to the band and had yet to write a better drum part. In live versions, Barker has often changed the song's breakdown to a more hip hop-inspired beat. Release and reception \\"Mutt\\", as stated above, first appeared as part of the soundtrack for The Show, a 1998 surf film directed by Taylor Steele, and released through Theologian Records. The trio performed the song later in the year on the Australian music program Recovery, first aired May 16, 1998. The re-recorded version of the song appears as part of Enema of the State, released on June 1, 1999. This edition also was synced for placement in American Pie, released on July 9, 1999; its soundtrack features \\"Mutt\\" as well and was issued by Uptown Records on June 29, 1999. \\"Mutt\\" played a significant role in the band's mainstream breakthrough, according to Andy Greene, writer for Rolling Stone. Billboard contributor Chris Payne considered it one of the less memorable songs on Enema. A 2016 Rolling Stone reader's poll placed the song at number nine on a top-ten ranking of the band's best.

The house is the oldest house in the Keys outside of Key West and the only surviving tabby house in the Keys. Adderley was a black immigrant from the Bahamas. He came to the Key Largo, Florida in 1890 and by 1891 was a naturalized citizen of the United States. He and his wife Olivia got a $100 mortgage and bought the 32 acre property in 1901. He collected Sponges and made charcoal which he took by sailboat to Key West to sell to buy provisions he and Olivia could not make themselves. The house was built from 1903 to 1905. The house is made of tabby, a homemade concrete like mixture of burnt shell, ashes, sand, shell and water. When the railroad came through in 1912 George negotiated a flag stop with the railway in exchange for a right of way across his land. Olivia died in 1948 at age 86. George lived on the property one more year until he sold the property to the Crane family in 1949. George moved to a home for the blind in Key West where he lived until his death in 1959, at the age of 88.

This children's book is set in a beach community in California, as well as on a tiny, habitable moon, \\"Basidium\\", in an invisible orbit 50,000 miles from Earth. The \\"Mushroom Planet,\\" visited by the protagonists David and Chuck, is covered in various types of mushrooms and is populated by little green people. Plot summary The story opens with Theo Bass, the cousin of Tyco Bass, coming to Pacific Grove, California, and visiting the two boys (Chuck and David) from the first book. He has been a traveler around the world for many years, and when he finds out about the mushroom planet, he decides to rebuild the boys' lost spaceship and return to what he knows is his ancestral home. Earlier, the boys had written a letter to a nearby university professor inviting him to come and give a lecture to their young astronomers' society. The letter arrives while the professor is away and is received by his ambitious young assistant, who comes to Pacific Grove to give the lecture in the professor's stead. The young assistant, Horatio Peabody, ends up going to the Mushroom Planet as a stowaway, and causing quite a bit of trouble there. This book is much more topical than the last one was, as Peabody insists that the Mushroom Planet must be explored and exploited \\"for the good of science\\" ‚Äî as well as for his own personal glory. Mr. Peabody ends up committing an act of sacrilege on the Mushroom Planet that almost gets everyone involved killed, and in general annoys and scares all. However, by the end of the book, Horatio Peabody learns his lesson about the arrogance of his scientific beliefs, and the situation, overall, returns to equilibrium until the next book.

The Flag of Milan consists of a red cross on a white field. Whilst similar to the Cross of Saint George, the flag instead symbolises the connection between Saint Ambrose and the city of Milan.  History  The association between the red cross on a white field and the city of Milan dates back to the 4th century. Saint Ambrose had been the Bishop of Milan between 374 and 397, and as a result of his influence his symbol, the red cross on a field of white became associated with the Bishop of Milan. In 1176 the Lombard League faced the forces of the Holy Roman Empire, led by Fredrick Barbarossa, at the Battle of Legnano. Upon hearing about the arrival of the Holy Roman army, the Lombard infantry constructed a carroccio, a sacred war wagon which displayed a vexillum, to take into battle. The infantry affixed the symbol of the Bishop of Milan, Aribert, to the wagon and displayed it during the battle. The connotations between the victorious battle and the flag led to a greater association between the city and the symbol. Between 1395 and 1447, the Duchy of Milan used the arms of the ruling House of Visconti, the biscione, a great serpent shown devouring a Saracen. This standard greatly replaced the Cross of Saint Ambrose in Milan. In 1397 the Duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, was granted the usage of the imperial eagle by Emperor Wenceslaw. The flag of the Duchy of Milan then became the arms of House Visconti quarted with the imperial eagle of the Holy Roman Empire. The red and white of flag of Milan most likely contributed to the green-white-red uniforms of the Milan City Militia which had fought against Napoleon during the French First Republic's invasion of Italy. The colours were then chosen by Napoleon for the flag of the Cisalpine Republic in 1797. This flag would later go on to inspire the current Italian Tricolour.  Modern-day usage  The flag of Milan appears on the crest of Serie A side A.C. Milan. Pro-Lombardy independence parties, Lega Lombarda and Pro Lombardia Indipendenza, both use the flag as a symbol for their movements.

History Founded in 1893 as VfB Pankow, the club's initial interests were in cricket and tennis. Within a few years English expatriates introduced football, which soon displaced cricket. The club grew quickly and came to include departments for gymnastics, fencing, and cycling. The football team played in the early Berlin-based leagues and became one of the founding members of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fussball Bund or German Football Association) at Leipzig in 1900. VfB played as a lower table side in the Verbandsliga Berlin-Brandenburg (later the Oberliga Berlin- Brandenburg) through the late 1910s and into the early 1920s until touched by scandal in the 1924‚Äì25 season. Although they finished just clear of relegation on goal difference they were forced into a two-game relegation playoff because the team had come under suspicion of manipulating some of its matches. They lost both contests to Preu√üen Berlin (0‚Äì6, 0‚Äì1) and dropped out of top-flight play for a number of years. Pankow was able to play their way back to premier level football in 1930 and in 1933 earned their best result with a second- place finish in the Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg, Staffel B. The next season German football was reorganized under the Third Reich into sixteen top flight Gauligen and the club joined the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg where they continued to deliver poor finishes until relegated again in 1936. After the end of World War II in 1945 occupying Allied forces ordered most organizations in Germany disbanded, including sports and football clubs. Late in the year the establishment of new clubs was permitted and VfB was re-created as SG Pankow Nord. The club was later the first side to be permitted play under its original name. In 1947 they re-appeared in the Oberliga Berlin (I) but were soon caught up in the Cold War politics of post-war Germany. By the end of the 1950 season they were forced out of the Oberliga and into the DDR-Oberliga, the first division league established in the Soviet-occupied part of the country. In 1951 most of the club's membership fled to the western-occupied zones of the city and set up there ‚Äì what was left of VfB in the east was renamed BSG Einheit Pankow. The crippled side then crashed to a last place finish in the 1951‚Äì52 season, establishing a record of futility nearly as ignominious the one that would be set by Tasmania Berlin in their 1965 Bundesliga appearance: * In 34 matches, Einheit earned just two victories and three draws (7‚Äì61), losing all of its away games. * The club was outscored 29‚Äì131 and went through a stretch of 588 minutes without a goal. * Of thirteen league matches which drew fewer than 2,000 spectators, ten were hosted by Pankow. Incredibly, the team made an appearance in the final of the FDGB Pokal (East German Cup) that same disastrous season. Aided by manipulative sports officials who ‚Äì looking to ensure the presence of a Berlin-based team in the final ‚Äì overturned the result of a cup semi-final match which they had actually lost, Einheit advanced to the final against SG Volkspolizei Dresden where they were beaten 0‚Äì3. Einheit was relegated to the DDR-Liga (II) where they struggled through two more seasons before being sent further down. The club would manage only three more single season appearances in the second division through the early-to-mid-1970s, spending the rest of its time in lower-tier football. A year after German re-unification in 1990, the eastern and western sides which had split 40 years earlier came together again as the current club VfB Einheit zu Pankow which plays today in the Kreisliga A Berlin (IX).

Early life  Durga Mohan was born in a well-known Baidya family at Telirbagh, Bikrampur, Dhaka in Bengal, now part of Munshiganj District of Bangladesh. Bikrampur has a long historical and cultural trail since many centuries. In 12th Century it was the capital of Ballal Sena and Lakshmana Sena, Kings of Sena dynasty and since then considered as an important seat of learning and culture of Eastern India. Durga Mohan's father Kashiswar was a government pleader in the court of Barishal, presently in Bangladesh. Kashiswar had three sons, Kali Mohan, Durga Mohan and Bhuban Mohan, and all of then became practicing lawyer at Calcutta High Court. Durga Mohan lost his mother early in life. After studying for sometime in the village school, he joined an English school at Barisal, where his father used to practice law. Subsequently, he won a junior scholarship and joined Hindu College, Calcutta, then under the University of Calcutta. He used to stay in the house of his uncle Bireswar Dash at Kalighat. After studying for a year at Kolkata, he went to Dhaka and returned to Presidency College with a senior scholarship. As a student of Presidency College he was greatly influenced by Edward Cowley, professor of history and an erudite Sanskrit scholar. Many of the students used to go to the residence of Cowley, who was deeply attached to Christianity. They used to discuss about religious matters. Some of students were influenced by Cowley's deep faith. One of Durga Mohan Das's friends, Bhagaban Chandra Chatterjee became a Christian. Durga Mohan Dash was also swayed for a period. He brought his child-wife, Brahmamoyee to the house of a Christian priest, in order that she could also understand the Christian faith before he finally decided to convert. That led to his being turned out from the house of Bireswar Das. At that time he had passed the licentiate examination in law and had started practising at Kolkata but that was not enough to keep him going in the city and so he shifted to Barisal. Barisal Brahmo Samaj His elder brother Kali Mohan Dash, who later became a famous lawyer of Kolkata High Court, then used to practice in Barisal. He provided him shelter and gave him some books of Theodore Parker. His elder brother asked him to read the books before deciding about his religion. On reading the books he changed his opinion and instead of converting to Christianity, joined the Brahmo Samaj. He got together his friends and established a Brahmo Samaj at Barisal. In order to enlighten devotees, he invited Brahmo preachers from Kolkata to visit Barisal and deliver lectures. Education of women was top priority. He organised many functions and festivals. Soon, Barisal became a great centre of Brahmo activity. In the course of time, the great controversy about remarriage of widows engulfed entire society and Durga Mohan Das plunged forward into that movement. He and his friends publicly promised to organise remarriage of widows. He offered financial support to such couples because they had to undergo severe social boycott. He even went to the extent of getting his young widowed step mother married to a friend of his. That brought in opposition from entire society. His earnings dwindled because people boycotted him but he remained steadfast in his mission. There were few people, other than Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar who have contributed so much to the cause of remarriage of widows. Mention may be made of another person in East Bengal who had also contributed substantially to this cause - Braja Sundar Mitra. It was during this period that the sons of Raj Chandra Roy, zemindar of nearby Lakhutia, joined the Brahmo Samaj and strengthened the movement. One day they took their wives with them to the residence of the English commissioner. That created such a sensation that it reverberated beyond Barisal, across Bengal and became a talking point in Kolkata society, because that was an age when women of respectable families never came out in public from the inner precincts of their houses. Later, the noted Brahmo reformer Nibaran Chandra Mukherjee married into this family. That happened to be a great social event in those days.  The reformist at Kolkata  Around 1870, Durga Mohan Dash shifted to Kolkata High Court. Dwarakanath Ganguly, the great champion of women's emancipation, had already shifted from Dhaka to Kolkata with his newspaper Abalabandhab. There were other young men such as Rajaninath Roy, who were clamouring for reforms within the Brahmo Samaj. Till then women used to sit in the Brahmo Samaj behind a screen. The reformists started bringing their wives into the open. That immediately caused some confusion but ultimately they won the day. Brahmo Samaj allowed women to sit in the open. When Miss Annette Akroyd opened a boarding school for girls in Kolkata, Durga Mohan Dash assisted her financially and admitted his daughters in the school. The school was later merged with Bethune School and his daughters were amongst the earlier batches to pass out of that school. It was during that period that his wife died. Being an outright reformist he sided with such people as Sivanath Sastri, Ananda Mohan Bose, Sib Chandra Deb, and Umesh Chandra Dutta for the establishment of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in 1878. He extended substantial financial support for the new organisation and served as its president. He went to England in 1888 and returned with illness. All his three sons had qualified as barristers and his daughters were married. He led a rather lonely life. He married a widowed daughter of Kali Narayan Gupta of Dhaka. However, old age had caught on and he died on 19 December 1897. Chittaranjan Das was son of his brother Bhuban Mohan Dash. Amongst his children the more renowned were Satish Ranjan Das, Sarala Roy and Abala Bose. Air Marshal Subroto Mukerjee was his great grandson on his daughter's side. After Durga Mohan Das's first wife Bhramamoyee Devi's death, he married a highly respectable widow lady Hemantasashi Sen, daughter of a renowned Brahmo social reformer Kali Narayan Gupta of Dhaka. Hemantasashi Sen's only son by her first husband was noted music composer and songwriter Atul Prasad Sen. References Bibliography Shastri, Shibnath.

Traditional giant kites (4 metres in width and almost 10 metres in length) are made and flown competitively by teams from the villages (banjar) of Denpasar. The event is a seasonal religious festival intended to send a thanking message to the Hindu gods to create abundant crops and harvests. The teams consist of about 70 to 80 people, each team with its own Gamelon band, flag bearers and flyers. Bebean (fish-shaped), Janggan (bird-shaped) and Pecukan (leaf-shaped) are three traditional kites flown during this kite festival. The kites are flown by teams of 10 or more adult kitefliers. The Bebean is the largest kite, and looks like a broad-mouthed, split-tailed fish. The Janggan form has a broad flowing cloth tail that can reach more than 100 metres in length. The Pecukan requires the most skill to fly, as its unstable form often tumbles towards the ground. Red, white and black are traditional colours used in the kite's designs. Each type of traditional kite has its own competition, with heats of 10 teams vying for the best launch and longest flight. Sometimes the kites come down over the adjacent rice paddies, and the team members have to dash through the paddy to rescue the kite before it lands in the water. A competition is also held for 'New Creation' (kreasi baru) kites which may include detailed three- dimensional figures representing the Hindu Gods or sponsorship kites. Traditional and new creation kites are constructed from bamboo and cotton cloth. In the dry season of June through August, the winds blow continually from east to west in most of Indonesia. Balinese children and adults fly kites in the vacant rice paddies during this period. A gamelan orchestra plays music throughout the festival. The festival attracts many tourists and international kitefliers, along with many local spectators.

Early career Thomas Sarsfield Power was born in New York City in 1905, a child of Irish immigrants. His parents were Thomas Stack Power, a dried goods salesman, and Mary Amelia Power (n√©e Rice), who had arrived in the USA in 1900. His parents were from wealthy farming stock but the best land and its livestock was destined for others in Tipperary, Ireland. Power attended Barnard Preparatory School in New York and entered the U.S. Army Air Corps flying school February 17, 1928. Upon graduation and receiving his rating, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps in February 1929. His early service included assignments at most of the famed Air Corps fields of the day ‚Äì Chanute Field, Illinois, as a student officer at the Air Corps Technical School's maintenance engineer course; Langley Field, Virginia, as commanding officer of the 2d Wing headquarters detachment (1934); Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., for duty as an Army Air Corps Mail Operation (Eastern Zone) pilot (1934); engineering and armament officer of the 28th Bombardment Squadron at Nichols Field, Philippines; and at Randolph Field, Texas, as a flying instructor (1938‚Äì1940). He completed his early career at Maxwell Field, Alabama, as a student at the Air Corps Tactical School (1940‚Äì1941). World War II Brigadier General Thomas S. Power with Major General Curtis LeMay and Brigadier General 247x247px After the era of slow promotions during the inter-war years of the 1930s, Power experienced the rapid rise in rank common to many officers of the pre-war Air Corps during World War II, becoming a major in March 1941, a lieutenant colonel in January 1942, and a full colonel in June 1943 eight days after his 38th birthday. He initially performed staff duties to September 1943 at Army Air Forces Flying Training Command headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. Following his promotion to colonel he was assigned as deputy commander of the 58th Bombardment Operational Training Wing (Heavy) at Smoky Hill AAF, Salina, Kansas. After a brief tour as assistant chief of staff for operations of the Second Air Force in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Power gained combat experience flying B-24 missions in Italy while deputy commander of the 304th Bomb Wing between January and July 1944. After returning to the United States in August 1944, he was named commander of the 314th Bomb Wing (Very Heavy) and promoted to brigadier general in January 1945. Power moved his B-29s to Guam in December 1944 as part of the 21st Bomber Command. From Guam, he directed the first large-scale fire bomb raid on Tokyo, Japan, on March 9, 1945. In a command aircraft, flying back and forth over Tokyo during the attack, Power was deeply impressed by the inferno of destruction playing out thousands of feet below. He later commented, \\"True there is no room for emotions in war . . but the destruction I witnessed that night over Tokyo was so overwhelming that it left a tremendous and lasting impression on me.\\" Ronald Schaffer, Wings of Judgment: American Bombing in World War II (New York, NY: Oxford U. Press, 1985), p. 131. On August 1, 1945, General Carl Spaatz, then commander of the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, moved Power up on his staff as deputy chief of staff for operations (A-3). He served in this capacity during the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Cold War and Strategic Air Command  CINCSAC General Thomas S. Power with Air Force Chief of Staff General Curtis E. LeMay and President John F. Kennedy at Strategic Air Command Headquarters. Power was once served as LeMay's Vice Commanders-in-Chief from October 26, 1948 to April 14, 1954, when LeMay served as The Commanders-in- Chief of The Strategic Air Command. During Operation Crossroads, the 1946 atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll, Power was assigned as assistant deputy task force commander for air on Admiral William H. P. Blandy's staff. Then came assignments as deputy assistant chief of air staff for operations in Washington and a period of air attach√© duty in London, prior to his transfer to the Strategic Air Command as vice commander in 1948. During the next six years, Power assisted General Curtis E. LeMay, then commander in chief of the Strategic Air Command, in building up SAC. He was then appointed commander of the Air Research and Development Command in 1954, a position he held for three years. When General LeMay was named vice chief of staff of the Air Force in 1957, Power became commander in chief of SAC and was promoted to four-star rank. Power was the architect of the Operation Chrome Dome airborne alert program of SAC that ensured that a proportion of the nuclear-armed strategic bombers were always aloft so as to survive a first strike.http://www.airforce- magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2011/August%202011/0811dome.aspx When RAND proposed a counterforce strategy, which would require SAC to restrain itself from striking Soviet cities at the beginning of a war, Power countered with: General Thomas S. Power flying a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker during his tenure as Commanders-in-Chief of The Strategic Air Command. Professor William Kaufmann from the RAND Corporation, losing his patience, noted: \\"Well, you'd better make sure that they're a man and a woman.\\" At that point, Power stalked out of the room. The briefing was over.Cited in Fred Kaplan, The Wizards of Armageddon, (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991), p 246. Having been briefed by another famous member of the RAND Corporation, Herman Kahn, on the genetic effects of nuclear weapons, Power replied: \\"You know, it's not yet been proved to me that two heads aren't better than one.\\"Cited in The Wizards of Armageddon, p 246. On October 24, 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, SAC was ordered to \\"Defcon 2,\\" one step short of nuclear war. Although authorized to increase his alert level, Power took the unprecedented ‚Äì and unauthorized ‚Äì action of broadcasting that message to global Strategic Air Command (SAC) nuclear forces \\"in the clear\\" (on non-scrambled, open radio channels), presumably in an attempt to scare the Soviets into complying with American demands. Raymond Garthoff, who was a participant in the crisis, noted that: Garthoff gives as his source: The question becomes a bit murkier when new material uncovered by Stanford's Prof. Scott Sagan led him to write:Air Force System Command General Bernard A. Schriever during senate hearing at The Capitol Hill.|alt= Commanders-in-Chief of The Strategic Air Command General Thomas S. Power at Strategic Air Command Control and Command Center on Strategic Air Command's Headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska on 1957.|alt=|left However, evidence to the contrary (i.e., that Power was trying to do an end run as stated by Garthoff and, earlier, by Sagan) is contained in SAC's history of the Cuban crisis. Pages 94‚Äì95 of that document state Some accounts incorrectly state that General Power went to DEFCON 2 without authorization. As noted by Michael Dobbs in One Minute to Midnight (page 96): Like his mentor General LeMay, Power believed that the only effective form of war strategy against enemy nations run by dictators in possession of nuclear weapons was Mutually Assured Destruction. Power continued supervision of this strategy, both in the development and deployment of the necessary weaponry, and the willingness to use these weapons in case of impending threat. Like LeMay, Power emphasized the value of bomber aircraft, which (unlike missiles) can be recalled in the event of an error in technical threat detection, and offer a strategic recourse short of total war. Power retired from the Air Force on November 30, 1964 and died of a heart attack December 6, 1970. He was a rated command pilot and aircraft observer, and was America's last general officer with no post-secondary education.Air power: the men, machines, and ideas that revolutionized war, from Kitty Hawk to Gulf War II / Stephen Budiansky Awards and Recognition General Power was awarded the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, Silver Star, Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star, Air Medal with oak leaf cluster, Air Force Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster, and the French Croix de Guerre with Palm. * 175x175px Air Force Command Pilot Badge * 150x150px Basic Missile Maintenance Badge * 60px Air Force Distinguished Service Medal * 60px Silver Star * 60px Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster * 60 px Distinguished Flying Cross * 60px Bronze Star * 60px Air Medal * 60px Air Force Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster * 60px French Croix de Guerre with Palm.

Early life and education Weitbrecht was born in Orange, California in 1920. He was born Deaf and his education was mainstream for the most part with the exception of acquiring some signing and lip-reading skills from a Deaf school early on. He went on to earn a B.S. in Astronomy from the University of California, Berkeley in 1942 and finished his formal education with a M.S. in Astronomy from the University of Chicago in 1957. Career Weitbrecht was initially a physicist at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California (now Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory), then an electronics scientist at the U.S. Naval Air Missile Test Center. For his efforts, he earned the United States Navy's Superior Accomplishment Award. Even in his high school days, Weitbrecht was interested in amateur radio and used radiotelegraph to communicate with fellow radio operators around the country. In 1964, this love for communication came together with the need to interact with a colleague who could not operate an amateur radio. To solve this problem, Weitbrecht created a device that used the public telephone system to achieve communication: the teletypewriter (TTY). After being approached by James C. Marsters, Weitbrecht came up with a revised design for the acoustic coupler (a type of modem), which used echo suppression. In 1964, Marsters and Weitbrecht adapted used teletypewriter equipment, and Weitbrecht made the first successful teletypewriter phone call from one deaf person to another. It took several tries, until Weitbrecht's words appeared clearly: \\"Are you printing now? Let's quit for now and gloat over the success.\\" Today, this type of device is known as a telecommunications device for the deaf. Personal life Weitbrecht earned a pilot's license in 1967. Weitbrecht died after being involved in an automobile accident in 1983.

The most recent, TOM III, was a beloved Bengal Tiger mascot for the University of Memphis during of one of the most glorious periods in University and athletics history. He passed away Friday, September 18 less than three weeks after his 12th birthday. Tigers football The Tigers also have a costumed mascot called Pouncer. TOM III was housed and cared for by the Tiger Guard, a committee of the Highland Hundred football booster club. University funds are not used to provide for the tiger's needs. The University of Memphis was one of two universities in the United States that use a live tiger as a mascot (the other being LSU) and has received criticism from animal welfare organizations. Until Tom II Memphis was the only school to have a live tiger mascot present at football games. TOM attends Memphis Tiger home games at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in a special sound proof, air conditioned trailer. History TOM I The first tiger, TOM, was purchased for $1,500 by the Highland Hundred Football Boosters in 1972. TOM was placed in a dog kennel and flown to Memphis on November 9, 1972. The tiger cub was taken to Athletic Director Billy J. Murphy's office for a press conference and was officially presented to Memphis University in a Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium ceremony during the November 11, 1972 football game against the University of Cincinnati. TOM was initially named Shane at the suggestion of the breeder‚Äôs daughter. Once in Memphis, a contest was held to rename the mascot and over 2,500 entries were submitted to a committee chaired by Harry Pierotti. The list was reduced to two choices, Shane, and TOM, which stands for Tigers Of Memphis and TOM was the victor. During his first few months in Memphis, TOM was housed in Highland Hundred member Bill Proctor's garage. TOM was later moved to the Memphis Zoo and put under the care of trainer Louie Bell. The tiger grew to weigh over 600 pounds, becoming one of the larger documented captive Bengal tigers. TOM served as mascot for nearly 20 years until passing away in February 1992. TOM II As TOM grew older, the decision was made by the Highland Hundred to keep the Tiger Tradition alive by securing a new tiger to be raised as TOM II. In the fall of 1991, Highland Hundred President Ray Daniels and President-Elect Bobby Wharton received TOM II as a gift from Tom and Carolyn Atchison of Florence, Alabama. The tiger was born on July 11 of that year, and, as TOM had been, he was presented by the Highland Hundred to the university in a ceremony at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium on November 16, 1991, during a football game against the University of Alabama. TOM II spent his life housed in private facilities maintained by the Highland Hundred Tiger Guard. After a few months spent living in the home of William Nixon, TOM was moved to a tiger house constructed at St. Nick‚Äôs Farm and Zoological Park in the Memphis suburb of Collierville. The $300,000 facility was paid for by the Tiger Guard. TOM II matured, growing to weigh more than 500 pounds. TOM II lived in the Collierville facility for nearly 14 years. In the summer of 2005, the Tiger Guard, led by Bobby Wharton, began construction of a new habitat in a rural area just south of Memphis. The new facility was similar to the original and included two swimming pools, a dedicated water well, a climate-controlled den box, a veterinary facility and multiple redundant security features. TOM II was diagnosed with cancer during an annual 2008 medical examination, and died on October 15 of that year at the age of 17. He outlived all four of his siblings by a number of years. He also far exceeded the life expectancy of a male tiger outside captivity. As was the case with TOM I in 1992, TOM II was cremated. The university's Athletic Department made arrangements for a permanent exhibit to honor all previous and future TOMs in the Athletics Hall of Fame which was to be constructed at the corner of Southern and Normal. University of Memphis president Shirley Raines received pressure from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to cease using a live mascot shortly before TOM III was acquired. TOM III TOM III was the last mascot for the Memphis Tigers. He was born on August 31, 2008 to Vixie and Thor at the Wisconsin Big Cat Rescue & Educational Center in Rock Springs, Wisconsin. TOM III and his two brothers were the result of an unexpected pregnancy at the cat sanctuary. He has two symmetric stripes that run lengthwise down the base of his tail.. TOM III served as the mascot for 12 years and passed away shortly after his 12th birthday on September 18, 2020.

Its general meaning refers to someone who is viewed as being \\"pretentious\\" or overtly \\"hypocritical.\\" The term is used mostly regarding social interactions. It can be heard being used in reference to the political system in general, or applied to political actions, policies, even individual politicians that are deemed untrustworthy, shady or disingenuous. The word \\"shibai\\" entered into the common local vocabulary of Hawaii by way of introduction from Japanese immigrants. The original Japanese language word, ËäùÂ±Ö, literally translates as \\"a play\\" or \\"a dramatic performance,\\" but is also used to describe a situation when someone is merely pretending or being insincere, as if performing a stage role: e.g., ËäùÂ±Ö„Å†„ÇàÔºÅ - \\"...(s)he is only playacting!\\" or, \\"...it's all just an act!\\" As a result of becoming popular in informal conversation, \\"shibai\\" can also be used even in what would be considered more \\"formal\\" venues, such as the local daily newspapersDavid Shapiro.

Her mother had all her children along with her baptized in 1945. Anuarite ran away from home to join the convent, despite her mother's disapproval. Her short religious life was dedicated to teaching and serving as a cook and sacristan. Nengapeta was killed during the nation's civil war at the Simba revolt in 1964 when Colonel Pierre Olombe killed her after she warded off his rape attempts. Nengapeta is the first Bantu woman elevated to the altars, with her beatification on 15 August 1985. Life Childhood Nengapeta was born in Wamba in the Democratic Republic of Congo on 29 December 1939 to Amisi Batsuru Batobobo and Isude Julienne as the fourth of six daughters; she belonged to the Wabudu tribe. The fifth and sixth were twins. Her father ‚Äì a former soldier ‚Äì dismissed his wife in order to take another wife so that he might have a son, but she turned out to be sterile. As a child she forgave her father for leaving her mother. Nengapeta ‚Äì and her birth mother ‚Äì were both baptized together in 1945 and she took the name \\"Alphonsine\\". It seems she was baptized twice because her original certificate of baptism was lost. One sister was L√©ontine Anuarite. Nengapeta once saw a goat get butchered and she refused to eat the meat because she said its blood was much like hers. Each time she finished school she went to help her grandmother with tasks. Once she began her schooling her registration had an error with her sister's name instead of the name she had been given at baptism. Her sister took her to register for her schooling but the Belgian religious sister who met them erred and signed her up with her baptismal name and sister's name. Therefore her name ‚Äì just Nengapeta ‚Äì is now viewed as Anuarite Nengapeta. Religious Nengapeta decided to pursue the religious life, for she admired the sisters and respected Sister Ndakala Marie-Anne. Her mother was against her vocation so she decided to do something about it after learning a truck arrived at the local mission to bring postulants to a convent. She did not tell her mother and instead boarded the truck unseen and went off to the convent. Her mother searched for a week but learned of what happened to her daughter from a village child; her mother was frustrated but did not demand her daughter return, knowing it was to be. The girl entered the religious life in 1959, assuming the name of \\"Marie-Cl√©mentine\\" at her profession on 5 August. Her parents were at her profession celebration and gave two goats to the sisters to express their happiness, though her mother later wanted her to return home to give them financial support. There was one occasion when Marie-Cl√©mentine attacked a hoodlum in anger when he was making overtures to one of the nuns. Capture and death In 1964 a rebellion broke out across the nation and the Simba rebels opposed Westerners but also the indigenous monks and sisters because of their suspicion that these religious were cooperating with foreigners. The rebels stormed her convent on 29 November 1964 and loaded all 46 of them into a truck telling them it was to ensure the sisters were safe. They were told the truck would go to Wamba, though it set off instead for Isiro to Colonel Yuma D√©o's compound. Colonel Ngalo, with the aid of the soldier Sigbande, tried to get her to be his wife and threatened her with death when she kept refusing. Ngalo turned to fellow Colonel Olombe (b. 1938) for his help in seducing her. For dinner on 30 November she had rice and sardines with a fellow religious and warned her sisters not to drink the beer. Olombe then sent the sisters off to bed and asked her to remain behind for he wanted her for himself. He insulted her when she refused his offers and so forced her and Sister Bokuma Jean-Baptiste into a car. The two tried to escape as he went back to the compound for the keys but he caught and began beating them. Bokuma fainted after he broke her arm in three places, while he called some rebels to stab Nengapeta before pulling a revolver and shooting her in the chest. Olombe ordered some sisters to remove her from his sight but she was still breathing for several minutes before she died around 1:00am on 1 December 1964. Between the blows she had the strength to tell her attacker: \\"I forgive you, for you know not what you are doing\\". Her remains were buried in a common grave but were exhumed eight months later and reburied. Her remains were later exhumed in December 1978 and it was found she had an image of the Mother of God in her right hand. Her remains ‚Äì after exhumation ‚Äì were then moved to the Isiro Cathedral. Olombe was sentenced to death in 1965 but escaped from prison. He returned to prison and his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1966, though he received a pardon in 1971. The Anuarite Woman of Courage Prize The Anuarite Woman of Courage in the D.R.C. Prize was established in 2009, named after the late sister to honor her courage and strength. The prize is meant to recognize and honor the vital contribution of women to the development of democratic values in the nation. On an annual basis a cash prize is awarded to a Congolese woman who helped to make her area a better place through hard work and dedication. Beatification The beatification cause commenced under Pope Paul VI on 14 April 1977 and she became titled as a Servant of God. A cognitional process was opened in the Isiro-Niangara diocese from 13 January 1978 until later in 1978. Her writings received theological approval on 9 May 1980 before the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the cognitional process on 12 February 1982. The cause's officials sent the Positio in 1983 before theologians approved the cause on 21 February 1984 as did the C.C.S. on 17 April 1984. Pope John Paul II approved this cause on 9 June 1984 and beatified Nengapeta on 15 August 1985 during his visit to Zaire. She is the first Bantu woman elevated to the altars with her beatification. To the left of the altar sat the late sister's parents. The pope expressed that he also forgave her killer. There were around 60,000 people at the beatification and it was rumored that her killer was present, as was President Mobutu Sese Seko. Her killer tried to secure a meeting with the pope to express his great remorse but it was denied. Joaqu√≠n Navarro said the audience was refused because the former colonel made the request through a news editor who interviewed him. One source said a contributing factor was that he was considered to be unstable. The current postulator for this cause is Fr. Jos√© Antonio P√©rez S√°nchez. She is a patron of the African Jesuit AIDS Network.

One of the earliest battles they helped him in was the Invasion of Buwat. A month after the raid at al-Abwa that was ordered by Muhammad, he personally led two hundred men including Muhajirs and Ansars to Bawat, a place on the caravan route of the Quraysh merchants. A herd of fifteen hundred camels was proceeding, accompanied by one hundred riders under the leadership of Umayyah ibn Khalaf, a Quraysh. The purpose of the raid was to plunder this rich Quraysh caravan. No battle took place and the raid resulted in no booty. This was due to the caravan taking an untrodden unknown route. Muhammad then went up to Dhat al-Saq, in the desert of al-Khabar. He prayed there and a mosque was built at the spot. This was the first raid where a few Ansars took part. After the death of Muhammad Banner of the Ansar at the Battle of Siffin During the tenure of Caliphates after Muhammad, the Ansar mainly became important military elements in many conquests, (as indicated with the appointing of Thabit, bin Qays bin Shammas, an orator of Ansar), to lead Ansaris in support of Khalid ibn al-Walid in the Battle of BuzakhaThe History of al-Tabari Vol. 10: The Conquest of Arabia: The Riddah Wars A.D. 632-633/A.H. 11 at the time of Caliph Abu Bakr.

The community is situated in rolling hills east of the Saint John River valley several kilometres south of Drummond. Its main industry is potato farming and related industries. Once the site of several schools, New Denmark is currently left with one English-language school serving elementary-age students; students in New Denmark can choose to continue school in nearby Grand Falls or Plaster Rock. The community hosts Lutheran, Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Pentecostal churches. Its five major ancestries are: English (50.1%), French (36.4%), Danish (17.0%), Scottish (12.4%), Irish (11.9%). The population has remained at approximately 1,000 residents in recent history, with Denmark Parish reporting a population of 1,668 in 2006. History The community of Hellerup originally derived its name from Captain Sorensen S. Heller with several Danish settlers who sailed from K√∏benhavn to Halifax aboard the Caspian steam ship, then on to the city of Saint John aboard the Empress. Then they paddle-wheeled up the St. John River and the Salmon River to arrive at the gravel bank on the opposite, inhabitable side of Drummond. This concurred with the redrafting of the Free Grants Act and redistribution of land parcels away from the original agreement set in the 1872 Stymest Heller proposal. Eventually this settlement formed the largest and what would become the oldest Danish community in Canada, but in recent decades the Danish influence has diminished somewhat due to out-migration. In 1912, the National Transcontinental Railway constructed a large steel trestle across the Salmon River valley. Today, this bridge remains an important structure on the Montreal-Halifax mainline of the Canadian National Railway. Trivia *On June 19 of every year, the community gathers on the historical grounds of the community to celebrate Founders Day. Through song, dance, prayer, and pure reminiscing, it is a very important day in New Denmark. Many Danish treats such as √Übleskiver and P√∏lse are also served on this day of celebration. * Of the original families to come immigrate in 1872, the descendants of one of them (Anders and Marie Carlsen) are especially numerous, but there are also many other families from subsequent immigrations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today the community is more mixed, but the Danish language can still be heard, and many families with French or English surnames, still proudly proclaim their Danish roots. * During the summer of 2006, the site of the building in which the original settlers spent their first winter (the \\"Immigrant House\\") was declared a Provincial Historical Site by the government of New Brunswick. A plaque was placed at this site, near the New Denmark Museum which stands there today. * During the summer of 2007, the community celebrated its 135th anniversary by holding a queen's pageant, a re-enactment of the founding of the community, by holding a parade and by holding many other planned activities. * New Denmark and its early inhabitants have been the subject of much research. One of the more recent studies was performed by Erik Lang (originally from Perth-Andover), who donated 2 copies of his M.A. (Carleton University) thesis New Denmark, New Brunswick: New approaches in the study of Danish migration to Canada, 1872-1901, to the New Denmark Museum in 2005. Copies of the thesis can also be found in the public libraries of Perth- Andover, Grand Falls, and Fredericton, at the Archives of the Harriet Irving Library on the University of New Brunswick Fredericton campus, at the Provincial Archives of New Brunswick, at the Maxwell MacOdrum Library on the Carleton University Campus, and at the Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa. * The fourth season of CBC's Still Standing includes an episode on New Denmark.

The idea of world unification, both politically and spiritually, is at the heart of Bah√° º√≠ teachings. Bah√° ºu'll√°h taught that the future order will be the embodiment God's scheme for mankind.

This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. A world executive, backed by an international Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the various elements constituting this universal system.\\"  Principles  Some of the principles outlined in the New world order include: *universal peace based on global collective security; *the unity of religion; *the setting up a world government which could enact laws required to satisfy the needs of all people; *an elected world parliament; *a world code of law: based on justice for individuals and justice for nations. *a binding world tribunal; *a world police force; *a universal bill of human rights; *the universal right to education; *the setting up of an auxiliary universal language; *the continued diversity of culture; *a world currency; *a system of world commerce through the establishment of an equitable economic system where the economic security of the individual is assured; *elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty.

It was founded in 1962 by Bingo Hauser, who has been in show business since the mid forties. Raised and educated in Brandon, Manitoba, Bingo started traveling with carnivals at a very early age and became well versed in the business by operating a number of rides and concessions. When he first went out on his own Bingo started an animal show, which is where the Lion in the WCA logo comes from. Bingo eventually sold the animals to zoos, bought a Merry Go Round and gradually built West Coast Amusements into the major Midway operation it is today. WCA is one of Canada's leading traveling amusement (carnival) companies, entertaining all ages with cost effective, safe, environmentally friendly, and fun services including rides, games, food, and much more. WCA employs approximately 350 people every year and have four individual units that travel all over Western Canada and Washington State.

There are many stages to the process, and each individual goes through the stages at different rates. It is a complex process involving psychology, personal finance, and often religion. It is the breach of domestic anticipation, often leading to a divorce or dissolution of the marital relationship. Often there are children, in-laws, and other individuals involved in the process. At the end of the process, there may be no relationship left, or there may be a long-term relationship at a distance. (see legal separation) Every marital breakdown is different in this regard. There are many reasons why some marriages last and others breakdown. The famous 1989 movie The War of the Roses depicts an extremely violent marital breakdown, where two otherwise reasonable people breakdown into violent fits of anger directed at one another. Such violence often requires immediate legal intervention to keep individuals from harming one another. In most States, a domestic violence restraining order (also sometimes called an Order of Protection) is routinely granted when one domestic partner proves that the other has caused violence. Not all marital breakdowns necessarily result in a divorce. Not all divorces result from marital breakdowns, though the courts ordinarily require one of the parties to attest on penalty of perjury that such a breakdown has occurred before a divorce can be granted. In Hausa culture, divorce refers to the wife receiving an agreement that the husband has rejected the marriage; she is expected to return to her father's house.

History When U.S. Route 84 was initially designated in 1926, its western terminus was located in Dothan. In 1934, the route was extended west, overlapping US 43 southward from Grove Hill to end at Chatom, quite a distance south of its present route. By around 1950, this gap had been removed. While US 84's western terminus was extended further westward into Mississippi in 1935 and eventually Texas by the next year, there remained a gap in US 84 between Chatom and Waynesboro, Mississippi. By 1950, this gap had been removed and the highway become continuous. It is unknown when US 84 was moved to its current route through Coffeeville.

It is located at 171 Frederick Street, in the city's downtown. It serves grades Junior Kindergarten (JK) through grade 6. The school building opened in January 1857, and its first principal was Alex Young. Initially, the school building also accommodated the Berlin Grammar School (later the Berlin High School, now Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School) in the second-floor room in the northeast corner of the building. In 1871, due to the growth in population of Berlin and due to school attendance having been made mandatory in Ontario, the school became quite crowded and the high school relocated elsewhere. Attendance continued to increase, and classes had to be held in Berlin's fire hall in 1874. In 1876, a four-room addition was built at the back of the school. In 1877, Ontario's Minister of Education chose the school as a model school for the training of third class teachers. At that time Alex Young stepped down as principal and was replaced by Jeremiah Suddaby. In 1882, the first kindergarten in Ontario, taught by Miss Janet Metcalfe, was opened at the school. In 1886, accommodations again became inadequate. The Berlin Public School Board decided to resolve this problem by opening new schools--Agnes Street School (now King Edward Public School) in 1886, Courtland Avenue Public School in 1890, and Margaret Avenue Public School in 1894. The concept of model schools came to an end in 1908. Suddaby remained principal until his death in 1910, at which point the school was renamed in his honour. In 1921 plans were made for a large addition to the school. The cornerstone of the new building was laid on June 10, 1922, and the addition was formally opened on September 24, 1923. The school celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1957. At that time, the school's original bell was donated to Doon Heritage Crossroads. On November 17, 1980, the school building was designated as a heritage property by Kitchener's city council under the provisions of the Ontario Heritage Act. The designation noted the facade, the archway between the main foyer, the archway between the main foyer and the original kindergarten, and the oil painting of Jeremiah Suddaby that was painted in 1912 by A. Y. Jackson, one of the original members of the Group of Seven. The basement was home to a special-ed program called McQuarrie Enrichment Program. Unfortunately, the McQuarrie Enrichment Program was transferred to Cederbrae Public School and A.R. Kaufman Public School in 2011. The school's most famous alumnus is William Lyon Mackenzie King, former Prime Minister of Canada.

Hannon It was the first release by Dischord Records. Comprising eight songs, Minor Disturbance referenced a number of issues pertinent to the band, from being turned away at local concerts due to their age (\\"Too Young to Rock\\") to what they felt was the increasing complacency of many first wave punk bands (\\"Fleeting Fury\\"). Upon its release, Minor Disturbance received positive reviews from local fanzines and gained airplay on local radio stations. Background The Teen Idles were a Washington, D.C. hardcore punk band that formed in 1979. Comprising vocalist Nathan Strejcek, guitarist Geordie Grindle, bassist Ian MacKaye and drummer Jeff Nelson, the band evolved out of the Slinkees. After original vocalist Mark Sullivan left for college, the Slinkees first tried to recruit Henry Garfield (later Rollins) before Strejcek joined.Azerrad, 2001. p. 123 After renaming themselves the Teen Idles, the band toured locally; they played at a range of venues, including opening for Bad Brains at an art gallery called Madam's Organ. The Teen Idles recorded two demo sessions at a local studio in February and April 1980, despite the engineer and a visiting band openly laughing as they recorded.http://vishkhanna.com/2015/11/12/ep-223-ian-mackaye-steve- albini-part-i/ They chose not to release the recordings, and instead embarked on a tour of the West Coast in August 1980. Upon their return to Washington D.C., the Teen Idles met Skip Groff, owner of the record store Yesterday and Today, to discuss a studio recording of their songs.Azerrad, 2001. p. 126 Recording and production The group entered Inner Ear Studios in September 1980 to record a number of songs, with owner Don Zientara engineering and Groff producing. Inner Ear was merely Zientara's house; he owned a four-track recorder and some home-made gear. The mixing board was on the porch, and was connected to the basement of the house where the band played. Zientara later noted that \\"everything was held together with clothespins\\". Inner Ear was useful to the Teen Idles, as at the time there were few options available to an American independent band between recording on a boombox or at a professional studio. Zientara, a folk music enthusiast, usually engineered recordings of Celtic folk and harp music and was about 14 years older than the Teen Idles, yet appreciated their recording zeal. He later commented: \\"It was them against the world, and they played music with that in mind. This music, it was 'Let's give it 100 percent, for a minute and a half and then drop out of sheer exhaustion, then shove it out of the way and get on to the next one. It wasn't like we were taking the time to archive this for posterity\\".Azerrad, 2001. pp. 126-7 Seven tracks were recorded in total. However, the band had not thought of what to do with the tapes, and shelved them.Azerrad, 2001. p. 127 Music Like the Teen Idles' other material, Minor Disturbance features mainly standard hardcore punk melodies and rhythms. Many of the album's songs feature Strejcek shouting over a fast one-two hardcore beat, with MacKaye and Grindle providing short and speedy riffs. On Minor Disturbance, the band drew inspiration from local punk band Bad Brains, as well as Californian hardcore bands such as Black Flag and Germs. Release and reception After deciding not to release the recordings, the Teen Idles continued to tour locally. However, by October 1980, they had decided to break up, mostly because of Grindle's disillusionment with the band. In their year of touring, they had earned a total of $600.http://www.dischord.com/band/teen-idles The members gave themselves two options; either divide the money between each member, or press the Inner Ear recordings. MacKaye later recalled, \\"We just said, 'Let's document overselves'. We figured that having a record would be pretty cool\\". Nelson added: \\"I don't remember thinking it was going to be anything more than just one record\\".Azerrad, 2001. p. 131 Choosing the latter, MacKaye and Nelson founded Dischord Records with Groff's help to release the recordings.Azerrad, 2001. p. 132 Minor Disturbance, an eight-song EP which included a live version of \\"Too Young to Rock\\", was released in December 1980. Dischord organized the pressing and printing, and ordered an initial run of 1,000 7\\" vinyl discs. However, the packaging of the EP had to be cut, folded and glued by hand; Nelson, Strejcek and MacKaye and friends spent many days assembling the packaging. The EP's front cover was designed by Nelson and featured a photo of MacKaye's younger brother Alec's hands, crossed across his chest, with large under-age Xs (which would later become a symbol of the straight edge movement). The EP's back cover included a photograph of the Teen Idles and a number of friends and fans, outside their penultimate concert at the Chancery in Washington on October 31, 1980. In October 1984, Minor Disturbance was reissued as part of the Four Old Seven Inches compilation, which combined the EPs of four early Dischord bands. The Four Old Seven Inches compilation and the EP itself fell out of print during the 1980s, so Minor Disturbance was unavailable until October 1995, when the compilation was re-released on compact disc.

He reigned for 15 years. In 323 BC, he styled himself \\"king\\" along with the rulers of Han, Wei, Yan and Zhao, becoming the first ruler of Zhongshan to do so. As the son of Duke Cheng of Zhongshan, he inherited the state from his father and expanded it to its peak size. He attacked Yan to the north and Zhao to the south and expanded his territory to nearly double what he inherited. His new gains from Zhao broke the state of Zhao into two pieces, North and South, providing the justification for the state of Zhao to seek to destroy Zhongshan.  Tomb of King Cuo of Zhongshan  Yellow Jade Pendant with Design of Kui Dragons. Unearthed from the Accompanying Tomb of King Cuo. The Tomb of King Cuo of Zhongshan is an archaeological site located in Sanji, Pingshan, Hebei, China. The tomb was built near the ancient city of Lingshou () on the Hutuo River. The tomb contained the remains of King Cuo. Initially, farmers discovered a large river rock inscribed in archaic (large seal) characters during the 1940s or 1950s and stored it for several decades. In the early 1970s, local artefact administrators received news of this rock and examined it. A copy was sent to Li Xueqin, a renowned expert on ancient Chinese writing. He immediately recognised its importance. The inscription was about two men, Gongsheng De and Jiujiang Man, who were servants and fishermen during the king's life and later guarded his tomb after his death. Later it was determined that the king was King Cuo from the inscriptions found on the bronze ware. The plans for the tomb complex were engraved on a bronze diagram found inside the tomb (this is the earliest architectural drawing known from ancient China). The original plan was designed to house five tomb complexes (xiangtang È•óÂ†Ç) in a row, with the tomb of the king in the centre, flanked by tombs of two queens, then flanked by outer tombs of two consorts. The tomb complex was never completed as designed. The site was excavated in the 1970s. Although the central burial chamber had already been looted in antiquity, archaeologists were still able to uncover hundreds of bronze, jade, lacquer and pottery artefacts. Six others were buried alongside the king. Two horse and chariot pits were included in King Cuo's burial complex. Three boats were uncovered, and an underground canal linked the tomb to the Hutuo River. The style and usage of bronze artefacts underwent a drastic change by the time King Cuo died in the fourteenth year of his reign. Among the changes was a de-emphasis on ritual bronze vessels and a new focus on luxury bronze objects. A bronze vessel from the tomb recorded a previously unrecorded invasion of Yan during that year that may have contributed to the change in style; some archaeologists believe that the new techniques may have been introduced by Yan artisans or copied from looted Yan bronzes.Wu, pp. 599-600 The new technique included the use of inlaid silver and gold onto bronze objects, often portraying mythical beasts.

Prior to the massacre, thousands of students, workers and other leftists had been holding ongoing demonstrations against the return of former dictator Thanom Kittikachorn to Thailand since mid-September. Official reports state that 46 were killed and 167 were wounded, while unofficial reports state that more than 100 demonstrators were killed. In the aftermath of the events of 14 October 1973, the military dictatorship which had ruled Thailand for more than a decade was overthrown. Political, economic and ideological factors caused the society to polarize into socialist-minded left, and conservative and royalist right camps. The unstable political climate which was exacerbated by the existence of fragile coalition governments, frequent strikes and protests, and the rise of communist governments in neighboring countries led at least two factions of the armed forces to conclude that they needed to launch another coup in order to restore order; one faction plotted to bring Thanom back in order to provoke turmoil which could be used to justify a coup. On 19 September 1976, Thanom returned to Thailand, was instantly ordained at Wat Bowonniwet Vihara, and was visited by the King and the Queen, resulting in anti-Thanom protests and demonstrations. On 5 October, the protesters were accused of lese-majeste following a mock play which led to right-wing allegations that its actor looked like the Crown Prince; the police and rightist paramilitary groups then gathered outside the university. At 5.30‚Äì11.00 a.m. on the morning of 6 October, the police used war-grade weapons, including assault rifles, grenade launchers, anti-armor rounds and grenades, to wage the crackdown against the surrounded protesters. The protesters briefly tried to defend themselves, but they were quickly defeated. Right-wing paramilitaries also lynched fleeing protesters; they were assaulted, robbed, sexually abused, shot, burned alive, and beaten to death, even some who had already surrendered. Bodies were also desecrated. 3,094 protesters were arrested on that day, while none of the perpetrators were brought to justice to date. On 6.00 p.m. that same evening, a coup was launched citing l√®se-majest√© and heavily-armed protesters. In the aftermath, the preceding age of \\"democratic experimentation,\\" which had lasted only about two years and eleven months, was ended. Thanin Kraivichien was named Prime Minister and the ultra-right government further fuelled the communist insurgency. The public were largely silent following the government stance of \\"forgive and forget\\", even the modern Thai public who are more sympathetic to the massacred protesters. Scholars have pointed out that the monarchy contributed to the events, at least partly, by supporting the rightist paramilitaries and the visit of Thanom.  Background  The 14 October 1973 uprising overthrew the unpopular regime of Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn, and saw him flee Thailand together with Field Marshal Praphas Charusathien and Colonel Narong Kittikachorn, collectively known as the \\"three tyrants\\". Growing unrest and instability from 1973 to 1976, as well as the fear of communism from neighboring countries spreading to Thailand and threatening the interests of the monarchy and the military, convinced the latter to bring former leaders Thanom and Praphas back to Thailand to provoke turmoil and justify another coup to restore order. It is told that in February 1976, admiral Sangad Chaloryu, Commander of the Armed Force and eventual coup leader of 6 October 1976, got an audience with the King and ask him for permission for a coup. The King did not forbid the admiral, and told him to ask Thanin Kraivichien, a stanch royalist and anti-communist judge and the next Prime Minister, for advice. In response to Praphas's return on 17 August 1976, thousands of students demonstrated at Thammasat University for four days until a clash with Red Gaur and Nawaphon left four dead. Apparently the coup plotters were not ready yet, and Praphas left the country. However, one month later, on 19 September, Thanom returned to Thailand and headed straight from the airport to Wat Bowonniwet Vihara, a temple heavily associated with royalty, where he was ordained as a monk in a private ceremony. Massive anti- Thanom protests broke out as the government faced an internal crisis after Prime Minister Seni Pramoj's attempt to tender his resignation was rejected by the Thai Parliament. On 23 September, the King and the Queen visited Thanom at the temple, while one lady-in-waiting for the Queen reportedly quoted her saying that she knew there will be arson at the temple. \\"[I] plea the people to help prevent [this].

On 24 September, in Nakhon Pathom, a small city just west of Bangkok, two labor activists posting anti- Thanom posters were attacked and beaten to death, their bodies then being hung from a gate. The murders were soon shown to have been committed by members of the Thai police. A dramatization of this hanging was staged by student protesters at Thammasat University on 4 October. The following day, as Seni struggled to put together his cabinet, a Thai language newspaper, Dao Siam (), published a photograph of the mock hanging on its front page, pointing out that the student at the end of the noose allegedly bore a resemblance to Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn. Army-controlled radio stations promptly accused the student protesters of l√®se-majest√© and coordinated royalist and rightist paramilitary forces: the Village Scouts, Nawaphon, and Red Gaurs, to assemble to \\"kill the communists\\". At dusk on 5 October, about 4,000 members of the paramilitary forces, joined by uniformed police, gathered opposite Thammasat University. The massacre took place the following day.\`  Massacre  A crowd looks on, some with smiles on their faces, as a man uses a folding chair to beat the hanged body of an unknown student just outside the university. Photo by Neal Ulevich. The police and paramilitary forces blocked all exits from the university from dawn on 6 October, and at 5.30 a.m. began shooting into the campus using war-grade weapons: assault rifles, machine guns, pistols, grenade launchers, armor-piercing recoilless rifles, scoped rifles, and anti-tank guns. The forces fired into the university grounds, later claiming that this was in response to sniper fire from inside the campus, but neutral observers on the spot reported hearing little if any shooting coming from the students. Prevented from leaving the campus or even evacuating the wounded, the student leaders offered surrender and negotiation with the Prime Minister, Seni Pramoj. It is unknown if the Prime Minister still held any real power that morning. The student representatives, including the actors accused of l√®se majest√©, turned themselves in, hoping for a chance to meet with the Prime Minister. However, they were arrested and taken into custody. When one student came out with a white flag to surrender, he was shot and killed. After a free- fire order was issued by the Bangkok police chief around 7.30‚Äì8.00 a.m., the campus was stormed, with Border Patrol Police commandos leading the attack. Some right-wing paramilitaries, working with the police, followed them into the university. Students trying to flee by diving into the Chao Phraya River were shot at by naval vessels. Some who were trying to flee the university via the front gate and the fence was lynched by the paramilitaries and bystanders. Witnesses (protesters and bystanders) reported that the paramilitaries assaulted, robbed, sexually abused, and shot the protesters, even some who had already surrendered. Some were hung from trees and beaten, while others were set afire. Although the majority of victims were shot by the police, some were injured and even killed by the ensuing mob of people that took part in the chaos. The mob also desecrated many of the bodies. At 11.00 a.m., the police gathered the surrendered students in the football arena, where men and women were forced to lie on their stomach and undress to their underwear. The official death toll was 46, including 5 perpetrators. The official records were autopsy reports. However, the unofficial death toll, given by the organization which handled the corpses, was more than 100. Neal Ulevich's photograph was the best-known depiction of the event. Winner of the 1977 Pulitzer Prize for spot news, it illustrates the brutality and lynch-mob mentality surrounding the event, and has since become a symbol for the massacre, and has inspired numerous works of art.  Immediate aftermath  On the afternoon of 6 October after the massacre, the major factions of the military which formed the general staff agreed in principle to overthrow Seni, a plot that King Bhumibol was aware of and did not oppose, which ensured the success of the coup-makers. Later that evening, Admiral Sangad Chaloryu, the newly appointed supreme commander, announced that the military, under the name of the \\"National Administrative Reform Council\\" (NARC) had seized power to \\"prevent a Vietnamese-backed communist plot\\" and to preserve the \\"Thai monarchy forever\\". The king appointed a well-known anti-communist and royalist judge, Thanin Kraivichien, to lead a government that was composed of men loyal to the king. Thanin and his cabinet restored the repressive climate which had existed before 1973.  The trial  After the massacre, none of the perpetrators were held accountable; however, 3,094 students and civilian survivors were detained. Many of the detainees were brutally abused by police. Most were released without charges except for 18 protest organizers, who were accused of rebelling against the state, causing public unrest, attempted murder of government officials and affiliating with communist acts. However, after pressures from within and outside the country, the last 18 detainees were eventually released two years after they were captured and given amnesty. It is speculated that the amnesty given to protestors was within the interest of the government and military to avoid further discussion of who should really be held accountable for the massacre, thus indirectly giving the perpetrators amnesty.  Significance   Return of bureaucratic polity  For forty years from 1932, when the absolute monarchy was abolished, until 1973, when military rule was overthrown in favor of democracy, military officers and civil servants held sway in Thai politics and dominated the government, with King Bhumibol serving as the ceremonial head of state in accordance with his role as a constitutional monarch established by the 1932 constitution. The Thai political system was known as a \\"bureaucratic polity\\" which was dominated by the military and civilian bureaucrats.Riggs, Fred (1976). \\"The Bureaucratic Polity as a Working System\\". In Clark Neher, ed., Thailand: From Village to Nation. Cambridge: Schenkman Books, pp. 406‚Äì424. The massacre disproved the argument that the bureaucratic polity was on the retreat as the military came to play a central role once more in Thai politics, a situation that would continue throughout the 1970s and 1980s until the 1988 general election, when all seats were democratically elected, including that of the prime minister, who from 1976 to 1988 was appointed by the king.  Withdrawal symptoms  Scholar Ben Anderson argues that the massacre and subsequent support for the return to dictatorship represented \\"withdrawal symptoms\\" by the middle class who favored stability and peace above democracy. Following in the footsteps of previous military strongmen like Plaek Phibunsongkhram and Sarit Thanarat, Thanom became prime minister in 1963 following Sarit's death. He oversaw a massive influx of financial aid from the United States and Japan, fuelling the Thai economy, as well as increasing American cultural influence. But by the early 1970s, the US was withdrawing its troops from Indochina. In such a context, the Thai middle class and lower-middle class who had supported student efforts in 1973 to topple the Thanom regime were more a product of their immediate history than devotees of democracy. They lacked political experience and so had no real idea of the consequences of ending the dictatorship. The regime was simultaneously blamed both for failing to exact fuller commitments from its allies and for excessive subservience to Washington. Thus, the support given by the Thai middle class and lower-middle class to the 1973 student protests was not an unconditional stamp of approval for democratic processes and the chaos that followed. The \\"chaotic democracy\\" from 1973 to 1976 was seen as having threatened the economic interests of the middle class and lower-middle class, who turned their backs on democracy, hence Anderson's use of the phrase \\"withdrawal symptoms\\", and welcomed the return to dictatorship on 6 October 1976.  King Bhumibol's role   Overview  King Bhumibol had supported student protesters in their demonstrations in 1973 that led to the downfall of the Thanom regime and resulted in the period of \\"chaotic democracy\\" from 1973 to 1976. By 1976, he had turned against the students and, according to many scholars, played a crucial, if not the most important, role in bringing about the massacre and a return to military rule after a three-year flirtation with democracy. There were two reasons for this about-face. First, Thailand's neighbors either were facing communist insurgencies or had fallen to communist rule and become communist countries, while the US was withdrawing its military presence from the region. The pivotal year in the trajectory of the king's involvement in politics was 1975. South Vietnam fell to the communists and the Communist Party of Vietnam was able to unify the country under its rule and drive out the US. In Cambodia, the communist Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh and began a reign of terror that would only end in 1979. The 1975 incident that arguably shook the Thai monarchy to the core was the overthrow by the Lao People's Revolutionary Party of the Lao Royal Family, to which the Thai monarchy traditionally had cultural and historical ties. Second, the period of chaotic democracy brought instability and chaos as demonstrations, strikes, and protests took place much more frequently. They threatened the economic interests of the monarchy managed by the Crown Property Bureau, which favored a stable and peaceful economic environment that would allow its businesses to thrive. King Bhumibol wielded his influence through a \\"network monarchy\\" that was centered on Privy Council President Prem Tinsulanonda. One of the main features of the network monarchy was that the monarch intervened actively in political developments, largely by working through proxies such as privy councillors and trusted military figures.McCargo, Duncan (2005). \\"Network Monarchy and Legitimacy Crises\\". The Pacific Review, Vol. 18, No. 4, p. 501. This network monarchy suggests that, contrary to the popular belief that the king was a constitutional monarch and above politics, rather he had been intimately involved in Thai politics and had often intervened in order to secure his political and economic interests. The instability brought about by the student protesters until 1976 as well as the growing specter of communist threat in the region, especially after the \\"domino effect\\" where Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos fell in succession to the communists, convinced King Bhumibol to see the protesters as a threat to his rule. The Thai state and its politicians subsequently branded these students, as well as workers and farmers, as \\"communists\\" and a \\"fifth column for the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT) and North Vietnam.\\" In reality, there was little evidence for the claim that protesters, including students protesting at Thammasat University, were communists. While the CPT had grown in strength, they were far from a unified force and they appealed to peasants by focusing on social injustices while avoiding attacking the monarchy and Buddhism. Their gains were fuelled more by the government's alienation of the peasantry. This suggests that the term \\"communists\\" was applied very liberally and indiscriminately and more often than not, deliberately, to those who were deemed to be the sources of instability that threatened the monarchy and the king. In the Thai state's view, communism was simply the enemy of the nation, religion (Buddhism), and monarchy, and a sworn enemy of \\"Thainess\\".Winichakul, Thongchai (1994). Siam Mapped: A History of the Geo-Body of Siam. Honolulu: University of Hawai‚Äôi Press. One of the more persistent counterinsurgency strategies was to link socialists, communists, and the Left to external threats. In order to deal effectively with the \\"communist\\" threat that would undermine his rule and status, in addition to deploying governmental forces such as the Thai military and police, King Bhumibol, through his network monarchy, also encouraged three paramilitary forces‚Äîthe Village Scouts, Nawaphon, and Red Gaurs‚Äîto use violence against protesters from 1973 to 1976, culminating in the Thammasat massacre.  Village Scouts  The Village Scouts organization was a national paramilitary group sponsored by the King and Queen of Thailand since 1972 in order to promote national unity against threats to Thai independence and freedom, particularly against \\"communism\\".Muecke, Marjorie (1980). \\"The Village Scouts of Thailand\\". Asian Survey, Vol. 20, No. 4. The movement was set up explicitly to protect the monarchy from communism. It focused on the central features of Thai identity: love of play, deep respect for the king and religion (Buddhism), and for ethnic Thai \\"specialness\\". The king was held to be central to the Thai nation, to be protected at all costs, alongside the nation and religion, forming the Thai nationalist shibboleth, \\"nation, religion, king\\". The Village Scouts presence provided continuous proof of militant political support for nation- religion-king beyond the Bangkok upper classes, among the \\"establishments\\" of provincial capitals, small towns, and villages. It helped to legitimize private, localized repression of protesting peasants and student activists as essential for the preservation the status quo. During the period from 1973 to 1976, Village Scout membership rose to tens of thousands, almost all in rural, CPT-influenced Thailand. After an Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC) takeover, the Village Scouts metamorphosed into a fascist-style mass political movement that would play a major role in the ensuing massacre.  Nawaphon  Nawaphon was an ISOC operation organized in 1974. It was composed of mainly low-level government functionaries and clerks, rural village and communal headmen, as well as a number of monks.Keyes, Charles (1978). \\"Political Crisis and Militant Buddhism in Contemporary Thailand\\". In Bardwell L. Smith, ed., Religion and Legitimation of Power in Thailand, Laos, and Burma. Chambersburg: Anima Books. The name \\"Nawaphon\\" means \\"nine strengths\\", a reference to either the Chakri Ninth Reign (King Bhumibol) or the nine points of Nawaphon's program to preserve Thai nationalism. The aim of Nawaphon was to protect the king from threats like communism. A key figure of the movement was the monk Kittivudho Bhikkhu, who became its leader in 1975. In a June 1976 interview, he was asked if killing leftists or communists would produce demerits or negative karma, he said that such killing would not be demeriting because, \\"...whoever destroys the nation, the religion or the monarchy, such bestial types are not complete persons. Thus, we must intend not to kill people but to kill the Devil; this is the duty of all Thai\\". In 1967, he established Jittiphawan College. It was inaugurated by King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit who returned regularly even after Kittivudho began to make incendiary speeches about the need to deal with student protesters and communists. This suggests a close relationship between the Nawaphon movement and the royal family. Employing the slogan that \\"killing communists is not demeritorious\\", Kittivudho encouraged the killings of alleged communists from 1973 to 1976 and injected militant Buddhism into the Thai body politic, eventually inciting his followers to commit violence at Thammasat University on 6 October. Earlier, Nawaphon was responsible for the killing of more than 20 prominent farmer activists in 1975. The murders were an attempt to negate the farmers' new-found political agency and, by so doing, return them to their pre-October 1973 state of relative repression.Haberkorn, Tyrell (2009). \\"An Unfinished Past: Assassination and the 1974 Land Rent Control Act in Northern Thailand\\". Critical Asian Studies, Vol. 41, No. 1, p. 28. The assassinations of farmer activists were part of the state campaign to suppress any potential threat to the king's rule, sanctioned and encouraged by the king as an integral part of his anti-communist purge.  Red Gaurs  The Red Gaurs were ex-mercenaries and men discharged from the military for disciplinary infractions mixed with unemployed vocational school graduates, high-school dropouts, idle street corner boys, and slum toughs. In the early-1970s, potential recruits were in dire economic straits, unable to obtain employment, and thus were easy targets of anti-student and anti-worker propaganda. Their grievances were exploited by the state, notably the king's network, and their anger directed towards student protesters. They were recruited not on the basis of ideological commitment, but rather by promises of high pay, abundant liquor, brothel privileges, and the lure of public notoriety. Unlike the Village Scouts and the Nawaphon, the motivation of the Red Gaurs was more sociological than ideological.  Royal family involvement  King Bhumibol and the royal family took part frequently in Village Scout activities and attended ceremonies at Kittivudho's college and Red Gaur training camps, thus illustrating their close ties with these three paramilitary forces. While all three forces differed in their nature, they were united by their allegiance to the king and, concomitantly, their hatred of communists. These paramilitary forces would subsequently be mobilized to attack the student protesters at Thammasat University to end their weeks-long protests.  Remembrance  An enlarged picture of the beaten hanged man on display at a temporary exhibition on 6 Oct According to Ron Corben, the Thammasat University massacre continues to be a \\"...scar on the Thai collective psyche...\\" The government has remained silent over its role, and that of the king, in the killing of student protesters. This silence is deeply embedded in a culture of impunity. In an analysis of the two amnesty laws passed in relation to the massacre, Thailand scholar Tyrell Haberkorn argues that they first created and then consolidated impunity for the coup and the massacre that preceded it.Haberkorn, Tyrell (2015). \\"The Hidden Transcript of Amnesty: The 6 October 1976 Massacre and Coup in Thailand\\". Critical Asian Studies, Vol. 47, No. 1. The first amnesty law, passed on 24 December 1976, legalized the coup and prevented those who seized power on the evening of 6 October from being held accountable. The second amnesty law, passed on 16 September 1978, freed eighteen student activists still undergoing criminal prosecution and dismissed the charges against them. The \\"hidden transcripts\\" of the two amnesties for massacre and coup that followed reveal the careful, calculated legal moves taken to protect those who were behind them. Despite the rhetoric in the streets and on the radio about the need to protect the nation, the coup and the massacre that preceded it unsettled some inside the state, perhaps because they were aware of the extra-legal status of the massacre, perhaps because they worried about their own culpability, and perhaps because they were aware that the violations in need of amnesty were not only those of the criminal code but of the more basic code of being human. Thus, both amnesty laws sought to produce impunity for state violence, particularly the king's involvement. There has been no state investigation into the violence and this impunity is both cause and effect of the silence, ambivalence, and ambiguity surrounding the event for both those who survived it and Thai society. Thai scholar Thongchai Winichakul, one of the student protesters who was jailed for his participation in the protests at Thammasat University, argues that the clearest evidence of the evasive public memories of the uprisings and massacre are the names the events have come to be known by, and the most conspicuous site of contested memories is the controversy over the memorial for the events.Thongchai Winichakul (2002). \\"Remembering/ Silencing the Traumatic Past\\". In Shigeharu Tanabe and Charles F. Keyes eds., Cultural Crisis and Social Memory: Modernity and Identity in Thailand and Laos. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. The massacre continues to be known in Thailand by the deliberately ambiguous term \\"6 October event\\". Thongchai argues that this non-committal name is loaded with many unsettled meanings, which imply the absence of any commitment and obscures the past because it is too heavily loaded with contesting voices, placing the massacre on the edge between recognizability and anonymity, between history and the silenced past, and between memory and forgetfulness. Thus, in \\"remembering\\" it, its nomenclature carries overt political significance that continues to reverberate in present-day Thai politics, particularly in relation to the role played by the state and King Bhumibol in the attack on student protesters. A commemoration event in 1996 represented a significant break in the silence, but despite the events twenty years earlier being retold innumerable times, there was no reference to the \\"undiscussable\\" parts of that history. There was also no reaction, not even any comment, from the military or any conservative organization. More importantly, the denunciation of state crime avoided imputing blame to any specific individual and the victims' self-sacrifice for society's sake was honored. The role played by King Bhumibol in inciting the military and police and paramilitary forces to attack the student protesters was not mentioned so as not to target the king as an \\"individual\\". Yet, this could also be interpreted as an attempt by the state to whitewash history by wishing away parts that it did not want the public to know or remember. In addition, by emphasizing the theme of healing and reconciliation in the remembrance, the Thai state, and by implication the king, have sought to make clear that the commemoration had no interest in and would not be involved in any talk of retribution. Forty years later, the perpetrators remain unnamed and unpunished. Tyrell Haberkorn, a Thailand scholar, speculates that the death of Bhumibol may have made it even more difficult to name the perpetrators as Rama IX's reign becomes more idealized. Doct6.com Former student activists and academics had set up an online archive on the massacre, aimed to raise awareness of the tragedy to the public. The project is managed by Professor Puangthong Pawakapan, a professor at Chulalongkorn University. The archive is set up to fight against authorities‚Äô attempts to erase the tragedy in most history books. The archive can be accessed on Doct6.com, where sources and articles are chronicled digitalized and uploaded for public access. The site presents a multitude of sources from photographs, newspaper clippings to oral testimonies as well as death certificates of those that were murdered due to the protest. Commemoration events The memorial in Thammasat University Thammasat University has been known to host annual commemoration events of the massacre, presenting lectures by historians, interviews with survivors as well as round table discussions, short films and live performances. Films Respectfully Yours Respectfully Yours is a film directed by Pattaraphon Phoothong and producer Prof Puangthong Pawakapan. The film was first screened last October at the 40th anniversary commemoration event of Thammasat Massacre. The documentary features interviews of the relatives of those who died in the massacre. Puangthong explained at a screening that this was an attempt to highlight the faces of the victims, to not ‚Äútreat them like numbers\\". Song Phi Non A short film called Song Phi Nong (The Two Brothers, ‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏û‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á) presents the stories of the two activists whose lynching was portrayed in the student play that incited the massacre. It was made by the same team that created Respectfully Yours and is available for viewing on the Documentation of Oct 6 Facebook page. The film is told through an interview with the two men‚Äôs brothers, a biography that has national implications. The film shows that of the two men, Choomporn has a strong political commitment. He and Vichai borrowed their friend‚Äôs motorcycle and went out to put posters to protest the return of General Thanom, who was exiled three years earlier after the student uprising of 14 October 1973. The documentary also shows the location of the lynching, a gate located in Nakhon Pathom. The gate is called ‚Äúthe red gate‚Äù and stood in the middle of an empty real-estate plot. The current owner did not bother to remove the gates after the lynching as he did not want to waste money, indirectly preserving important historical evidence.

His career spanned four decades in a number of different media, including radio and film. In addition to his artistic contributions, Juliani was a strong advocate of Canadian theatre and the arts. He is the father of actor Alessandro Juliani. Career Juliani trained at the National Theatre School of Canada and was the first alumnus of that school to serve there as a guest teacher. Early in his career, Juliani performed at the Stratford Festival of Canada and was a member of the Stratford Shakespearean Festival Company. In 1966, Juliani joined the theatre department of Simon Fraser University as an instructor. At that time, he also established the Savage God Theatre Company. Juliani took the name from a comment made by William Butler Yeats after Yeats had seen a production of Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi to signify literary and theatrical revolution. During 1973 and 1974, under a grant from the Canada Council, Julian traveled and studied world theatre. Afterwards, in 1974, Juliani established the graduate studies program in theatre at York University. In 1976, Juliani moved to Edmonton where he produced work with Savage God in both that city and Toronto. In 1978, he received a Canadian Film Award nomination for Best Actor at the 29th Canadian Film Awards, for his performance as Jean- Baptiste Lagimodi√®re in the film Marie-Anne.\\"Four films nominated for Etrogs\\". The Globe and Mail, August 24, 1978. In 1982, Juliani joined radio drama department of the CBC in Vancouver, where he was the executive producer of special projects until 1997. In 1983, Juliani and Sharon Riis earned a Genie Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay for the film Latitude 55¬∞, which Juliani also directed. That film earned a total of six Genie nominations. Juliani was an active member of artists‚Äô unions and organizations, including Equity, serving on its West Coast Advisory Committee, and ACTRA. He was the National President of the Directors Guild of Canada for 1986‚Äì1987 and later spent a decade as chairman of the B.C. District Council of the DGC. Juliani also served as President of the Union of British Columbia Performers (ACTRA) from 1998 until his death. Juliani was also a founding member of the editorial board of the Canadian Theatre Review. In Vancouver, under Juliani‚Äôs guidance, Savage God undertook a number of projects, including The Shakespeare Project, a programme of staged readings of the entire works of Shakespeare. The project commenced in January 2000, and had been intended to span a number of years. With Juliani‚Äôs sudden death after a short battle with liver cancer, Savage God produced the remaining plays in a three-day \\"Bard-a-Thon\\" in June 2004, ending with a production of Hamlet.

Kenton and starring Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. It is noteworthy as their first feature that contains no musical numbers. Plot Chick Larkin (Bud Abbott) and Mervyn Milgrim (Lou Costello) both work at the soda counter of a local radio station. Their true passion, however, is to become writers on a radio mystery show. They attend a broadcast of the radio program Murder at Midnight along with one of the writers, Jimmy Turner (Patric Knowles) and the producer, Jane Little (Louise Allbritton). As the show begins, the network president, Colonel J.R. Andrews (Thomas Gomez), is mysteriously electrocuted. Seeing this as an opportunity to become radio writers, Chick and Mervyn impersonate detectives and attempt to solve the crime. Meanwhile, Moran (William Gargan) and Branningan (William Bendix), two real detectives, consider the 'fake' detectives to be prime suspects. A chase ensues throughout the studio and other murders are discovered, including that of Dr. Marek (Ludwig St√∂ssel), Andrews' personal physician. Larkin and Milgrim flee the studio before hearing that Milgrim has apparently won $10,000 on the Wheel of Fortune radio program, for which he must return to the studio in order to claim the prize. Larkin and Milgrim return, only to be arrested by the real detectives, whom Turner and Little manage to convince that there should be a full reenactment of the program that led to the murders, under the ruse that the true culprit will be revealed. An eavesdropping Nazi spy (Don Porter), who uses the radio station to transmit information to his cohorts, attends the broadcast. It turns out that the spy murdered the Colonel and his physician because they found out about his illegal radio transmissions. During the broadcast, he is revealed to be the killer and escapes to the roof, where he is nabbed by Larkin and Milgrim.

He was killed in action near Soissons, France, during the Army's first large- scale offensive operation of the First World War. Background A native of Cincinnati, Ohio, Lupo delivered newspapers before being drafted in October 1917, along with hundreds of thousands of other young American men after Congress declared war on Germany at the behest of President Woodrow Wilson. With only a fifth-grade education, he arrived in France in March 1918, and was assigned to the 18th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division. On July 20, his battalion took part in a French-led attack on a German-held salient near Soissons. Lupo fell in combat on that same day and was hastily buried on the battlefield, in the same grave with another U.S. soldier. In 2003, French archaeologists discovered the remains of both men.

Description Front view Side view The bird is a long, mostly green, multi-colored amazon parrot with a yellowish white, blue and green head, greenish-bronze upperparts, grey feet, reddish eye, and violet blue-green wings. Its tail feathers are blue with broad yellow tips. There is a less yellow-brown morph and a less common green morph. It has grey feet and reddish eyes. Both sexes are similar. The young has lighter plumage and brown iris. Range The Saint Vincent amazon is endemic to the heavily forested mountains of the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent in the Lesser Antilles. Its diet consists mainly of fruits, nuts, flowers and seeds. The female usually lays one to two eggs. Conservation The Nicholas Wildlife Aviary Complex, located within the Botanic Gardens of Saint Vincent (island) maintains a vital captive breeding and conservation program to conserve the St Vincent Parrot. There is also a small population of St. Vincent parrots at the long-closed Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary in Barbados. However, there has been at least one raid on the parrots in the last few years with one being killed so that in 2010 the owner of the Sanctuary requested the Barbados Government if he could move them to an off-shore Island. After some years of prevarication the Barbados Government still has to make a decision on this. Meanwhile, the Sanctuary is suffering from increased poaching and raids, about which the local Police have been reported as not doing anything. Threats and status Hunting for food, trapping for the cage-bird trade and habitat loss were the principal causes of this species' decline.ARKive Deforestation has been the result of forestry activities, the expansion of banana cultivation, charcoal production, the loss of nesting-trees felled by trappers seeking young birds for trade, and natural events such as hurricanes and volcanic eruptions.Snyder, N.; McGowan, P.; Gilardi, J.; Grajal, A. 2000.

(2005) Species conservation plan for the St. Vincent Parrot Amazona guildingii. Loro Parque Fundacion, Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife. A cross-country road is planned, funded by the Taiwanese government, which would destroy large areas of suitable habitat and increase deforestation rates. The genetic isolation of the separate sub-populations may present further cause for concern. The small population of captive birds at the Graeme Hall Sanctuary in Barbados is at very high risk. This is due to the lethargy of the Barbados Government in working with the St. Vincent Government and the owner of the Graeme Hall Sanctuary to move the birds to an off-shore island or even back to St. Vincent. Increased raids and poaching at the Sanctuary, the deliberate cutting off of the Sanctuary's water supply, and little or no support from the local Police when raids occur, all mean that this small population is unlikely to survive. Due to all of these contributing factors, the St. Vincent Parrot is considered Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I and II of CITES.

He is a New York City lawyer-turned- senator with the power of self-propelled flight. Ambitious and pragmatic, Nathan has a decidedly anti-hero streak, which exacerbates his complex relationship with his brother, Peter Petrelli. Nathan serves as a main villain at the beginning of Volume 4: Fugitives.  Genesis  Nathan is the eldest son of Angela and Arthur Petrelli. He was a lawyer working with the District Attorney's office. The District Attorney wanted to expose the Mafia connections of his father's client, Daniel Linderman. As he was driving his wife home from a party in a convertible, another vehicle attempted to run them off the road. Nathan inadvertently flew from his car, causing the car to lose control and veer off the freeway. The resulting crash paralyzed his wife, Heidi. Six months later, Nathan is running for Congress. In the pilot episode, he is approached by his brother Peter, who tells him that he'd been having strange dreams and believed he could fly. Nathan claims to be unconvinced. The following morning, Nathan watches from an alley as Peter jumps off a building in an attempt to fly. As Peter falls, Nathan flies into the air and grabs his brother's hand. They descend for a few seconds, but then the brothers lose their grip on one another. The next day, Nathan denies that he flew and tries to explain away what happened as if it were simply a suicide attempt by Peter. Much later that night, Nathan is called to another rooftop, where Peter threatens to jump unless Nathan admits that he flew. Nathan eventually admits that he did fly. Still more focused on his campaign and his family, Nathan holds a press conference where he broaches the subject of depression. He reveals that his father suffered from it, and that it eventually led to his death. Nathan then claims that Peter's attempt to fly was actually a suicide attempt, to satisfy the press. Peter storms out of the press conference, later cursing Nathan and assaulting him, but goes along with the story in public. On his way to Las Vegas to meet with Linderman, Nathan encounters Mohinder Suresh, who attempts to warn him that his life may be in danger. Nathan mistakes Mohinder for his recently murdered father, Chandra, assumes that Peter sent him, and ignores him. In Las Vegas, Nathan encounters \\"Jessica\\" Sanders and the two sleep together. The one-night stand is recorded in a blackmail attempt by Linderman. Afterwards, Noah Bennet monitors them and has the Haitian kidnap Nathan. Barefoot and in pajamas, Nathan escapes when Bennet is distracted. Flying away, Nathan breaks the sound barrier in the process. Nathan lands outside a diner in the desert outside Las Vegas and calls an aide for help. While waiting for his ride, Nathan meets Hiro Nakamura, who enthusiastically announces that he too has powers. Nathan is skeptical, but humors Hiro, who says he can teleport and manipulate time. Nathan asks about the upcoming election; Hiro says that Nathan wins by a \\"landslide\\". When Nathan's ride arrives at the diner, Nathan agrees to give Hiro a ride back to the city. After dropping Hiro off, Nathan goes back to meet with Linderman, only to run into Niki on the way. Niki confesses her alter-ego Jessica's role in the blackmail attempt, saying that she had been blackmailed herself. When Nathan meets with Linderman's associate again, he works out a deal with her: Though their original deal was for two million dollars, Nathan becomes more certain than ever of his victory and negotiates for four million, saying, \\"two million makes me a congressional candidate in your pocket; four million, makes me a congressman.\\" After Nathan returns to New York, he and his family have brunch with a newspaper reporter. During the brunch, the reporter questions Nathan about his connections to Linderman, and Nathan's meeting with a blonde woman (aka Jessica Sanders) in Vegas. Peter covers for Nathan, telling the reporter that Nathan was arranging a private clinic to treat him for his depression. Before leaving, Nathan tells Peter about the failed kidnapping attempt, and warns his brother to be careful, saying that people would want to lock them up if they realized the two brothers had powers. At home, Nathan inquires about a painting by Isaac Mendez which Linderman had purchased and Peter wants. Linderman sends it to Simone Deveaux's gallery. When the painting arrives, Nathan views it with Simone. The painting depicts a man resembling Peter, dead under a homecoming banner and a clock. After seeing it, Nathan destroys it, telling Simone that he is protecting Peter from getting himself killed. Nathan later appears to bail Peter out in \\"Fallout\\". As they walk away from the jail, Peter collapses. Eventually, Nathan watches helplessly as Peter is comatose for two weeks. Finally, Nathan gets tired of waiting and goes to Mendez's loft. There, Nathan finds several of Mendez's finished \\"future paintings\\". Nathan is especially thoughtful about the \\"exploding man\\" image, which he and Isaac both worry is Peter. Soon, Hiro appears, and happily greets Nathan. Nathan and Hiro talk about their role in stopping the \\"bad man\\" who may blow up New York. Later, Nathan returns to Peter's bedside only to discover that Peter has revived and checked out. In \\"The Fix\\", Nathan goes to Mohinder to find out where Peter is, but neither has heard from Peter in days. Mohinder tells Nathan about a list made by Mohinder's father and explains to Nathan how Peter's DNA causes him to absorb and mimic other people's abilities. Nathan initially refuses to let Mohinder help find Peter, but Mohinder convinces him by stating that if he can study Peter, he may be able to find a cure. They go to Peter's apartment, where Peter is preparing to leave town. Without fully hearing them out, Peter says he doesn't have time to be Mohinder's \\"guinea pig\\". Peter then tricks the two and gets away. At the end of the episode \\"Distractions\\", Nathan receives a telephone call from Meredith Gordon, a woman in Texas with whom he once had a relationship. She informs him that their daughter Claire is still alive. Nathan assumes that her timing the call right before his election means that she wants money, and offers $100,000 to stay quiet, which she accepts;she later lies to Claire saying the amount is only $50,000 and Claire is entitled to half. In \\"Run!\\", Nathan shows up to visit Meredith and deliver the money but states he does not want to get too involved with Claire. Claire was secretly listening to the conversation which, due to lies Meredith told her, did not portray Nathan in a very positive light. At the end of the episode, back in Vegas, Jessica gets a call from Linderman saying that he wants Nathan assassinated. The FBI, who is investigating Linderman, gives Nathan a wiretap to wear so that they can gather evidence. He also helps Hiro sneak into Linderman's casino hotel to steal the sword he needs. Just before Nathan goes to meet Linderman, Niki Sanders confronts him and tells him that Linderman's people know of his plans, including that he wears a wire, and plan to kill him. She advises him to either accept a deal with Linderman or run with his whole family. Nathan refuses, suggesting instead that he should kill Linderman. Niki gives him her gun and tells him to knock her out, to prevent her more ruthless alter-ego, Jessica, from seizing control. Nathan takes the gun and punches Niki. A nervous Nathan goes down to the kitchen to shoot Linderman. Linderman, anticipating Nathan's actions, calmly reasons that if Nathan were to shoot him, his men would kill Nathan within moments. Linderman then tells Nathan that he can give him answers, stating that he knows about his abilities. He offers him the seat in Congress, suggesting that it will lead eventually to the White House, \\"a heartbeat away from the Presidency.\\" Nathan, wavering at this point, puts down the gun. In \\".07%\\", Linderman shows Nathan a painting of Nathan standing in the Oval Office. Linderman tempts Nathan with the prospect of being President and informs him that it will happen the day after Peter blows up. While Nathan is troubled that he will lose his brother and is devastated when he sees the dead body of Peter at his mother's house, he believes that it is Peter's destiny to explode. Later, Nathan meets his biological daughter, Claire, for the first time. Though he tells her that he can't deal with her in his life right now because of the election, he does add that he wants her to return after the election is over so they can be a family. After Claire talks to Peter about Ted, Peter and Claire confront Nathan about Ted. With someone else having the ability to explode, Peter is hopeful that the explosion can be stopped. Nathan is doubtful, and points out that Peter's vision was of his own explosion. Peter responds that he had a vision of flying as well, despite the fact that it was Nathan who could fly - a fact that impresses Claire. After Peter and Claire leave, Nathan makes a phone call, saying \\"Mr. Linderman, we have a problem.\\" It is revealed that Nathan may play a bigger role in the company than expected when, Peter and Claire go to Petrelli Campaign Headquarters to meet with Nathan. Upon arriving, they see Nathan meeting with Thompson, whom Claire recognizes as her adoptive father's old boss. She identifies him to Peter as the man she is running from. Thompson and Nathan, meanwhile, discuss the planned explosion, and Thompson tells Nathan not to worry or have second thoughts. Thompson tells Nathan that Mr. Linderman has a grasp on the situation and that they are aware of who Sprague is. Nathan is upset that he was kept in the dark about Sprague. Later, Nathan's mother arrives and reveals her part in the planning of the explosion in New York. She tells Nathan that after a catastrophe like this, a leader is needed, and tells him that he needs to be that leader. Nathan then encounters Hiro again and Hiro tells him what happens to him in the future. Nathan, however, tells Hiro that the explosion cannot be stopped. Hiro then calls him a villain as Nathan waves to the cameras and drives away. Much later, in \\"Landslide\\", Linderman delivers on his promise and, with Micah Sanders' help, assures Nathan's win as Congressman by a majority of votes. At the same time, Linderman uses his healing powers to restore Heidi's legs as a gift to even further keep Nathan on his side. In \\"How to Stop an Exploding Man\\", the finale to Season 1, Nathan appears committed to the fact that Peter will explode, destroy the city, and kill millions; paving his way to power and the destiny designed by Linderman and others. However, Claire, who has been strong-armed into traveling into Paris with Angela, shames him into changing his mind, stating that the \\"future isn't written in stone.\\" Nathan appears after Peter and Hiro defeat Sylar. After saying, \\"You saved the cheerleader so we could save the world,\\" Nathan grabs Peter and flies far into the stratosphere. With the other heroes looking to the sky, Peter detonates miles above the ground, instead of destroying New York City.  Generations  In \\"Four Months Ago...\\", it is revealed that Nathan suffers severe radiation poisoning and is badly burned by Peter, who he drops after being convinced to do so, and is knocked back when Peter explodes in mid-air. Peter rescues Nathan from falling after his explosion. After regaining consciousness, his mother told him that the Coast Guard never found Peter's body. He recovered after being injected with Adam Monroe's regenerative blood. In \\"Four Months Later...\\", it is revealed that Nathan has become an alcoholic, while hoping for Peter to return. In the opening scenes, he is seen bumping into Ando Masahashi on the street. He has presumably resigned from his office,As confirmed by the statement on his campaign web site: \\"Without going further into further details, I am resigning from my elected seat as Junior Senator of New York state, effective immediately.\\" and his wife and children have left him due to his erratic behavior. After a confrontation with his mother, who blames Nathan for Peter's apparent death, he goes to a bar for a drink. Claire calls him to tell him how she is coping, and Nathan glances in the mirror. In the mirror, a severely scarred image of himself appears. A moment later, it is gone. In \\"Fight or Flight\\" he goes to Philadelphia to help Matt Parkman find his father, with the intention of finding out who really murdered Kaito Nakamura. (Nathan's mother, Angela, confesses to the murder under duress.) When Maury Parkman is confronted with the fact that Matt has the same powers, he agrees to tell them everything; however, instead of helping them, he uses his power to trap them in their own personal nightmare before leaving the apartment. Nathan is on top of the Deveaux Building, watching helplessly as New York burns in the aftermath of the explosion. He is then confronted by himself, still scarred from his attempt to rescue Peter. A fight ensues between him and his disfigured self, which ends when Matt inserts a thought in Nathan's head, causing them to realize they are actually fighting one another. They then find another photo marked with the Symbol, this time of Bob. In \\"Out of Time\\", Nathan confronts Bob about the original 12 members of The Company and it is the first time he is told that Adam Monroe, and not Linderman, founded the shadowy organization. Nathan also learns from Bob that his brother, Peter, is still alive, although Bob admits that they lost track of him. In \\"Four Months Ago...\\", he is seen getting out of a taxi in front of the bar in Cork, Ireland, where Peter spent the first few episodes of the season. In \\"Powerless\\", Nathan convinces Peter of Adam Monroe's intentions to release the Shanti virus and cause worldwide devastation. After the destruction of the virus, Nathan decides that they must schedule a press conference to make their abilities known to the public. It is his hope that public awareness will help stop the actions of the Company. Near the conclusion of his speech, as he is about to announce his ability of flight, Nathan is shot twice in the chest and lies in Peter's arms.  Villains  Nathan is rushed to the hospital with Peter and Matt in tow, and appears to have died. However, he revives seconds later next to Peter, and has an epiphany; he believes that God has given him a second chance at life. Nathan now believes that he must do God's bidding, but he is now haunted by an apparition of Linderman that only he can see and hear. He is later contacted by Tracy Strauss and is asked to take over the position of the late Senator. He mistakes Tracy for Niki Sanders, as the two look exactly alike. The position would be Nathan's second chance at politics, and Linderman persuades him to take this opportunity. Nathan accepts after a small amount of time to himself. After taking the position, he notices that Tracy is nowhere to be found. He heeds Linderman's advice and tries to contact her. He eventually saves her from committing suicide by jumping into the Potomac River by flying and catching her as she leaps off a bridge. They are later seen sitting together in a room and, as Nathan had revealed his powers, Tracy reveals her power to him by freezing his drink. He takes her by her hands and notes that they are not even slightly cold. The two then share a kiss. In the episode \\"Angels and Monsters\\", Nathan and Tracy have consummated their relationship. Tracy explains to Nathan that she accidentally killed an innocent man and that she must turn herself in to the proper authorities. Nathan reassures her that it was not her fault and that God has given them these abilities for the betterment of mankind. Tracy reacts to the statement with bewilderment and reveals that it was not divine intervention, but rather that their abilities are man-made and were manufactured by a doctor in Reseda, California. In order to get closure to Tracy's claim, Nathan seeks out his mother Angela, knowing that she would have information. Angela explains that not every individual who possesses powers has the necessary genetic code to do so. She seems to already be fully aware of Tracy, Niki and Barbara's existence. It is revealed that Dr. Zimmerman created a synthetic variation of the code and imbued certain newborns (Nathan, Tracy and her siblings being amongst them) with abilities. Infuriated and hurt, Nathan scolds his mother for using him and other innocent children as guinea pigs and storms out of her office along with Tracy. In the episode \\"Dying of the Light\\", Nathan and Tracy are still reeling from Angela's revelation about their condition. Nathan suggests that they seek out assistance from Mohinder Suresh. Upon arriving at Suresh's loft, Nathan reveals to him that man does have the ability to imbue other humans with abilities through genetic manipulation. Naturally, Mohinder assumes that Tracy is Niki. Tracy expresses that she just wants her abilities to be removed after demonstrating her freezing ability to him and thus proving that she is not Niki Sanders. Under the guise of assistance, Suresh injects the both of them with a fluid, telling them that the vial contains nothing but a \\"marker\\". Tracy then falls on the floor unconscious as Nathan realizes that the both of them have been drugged by the doctor. After being restrained and regaining consciousness, Tracy then tricks Mohinder into holding her hand, whereby she freezes it and her restraints to the point of making them brittle enough to shatter with ease. She then frees herself and Nathan (who is still under the effects of the drug) and attempts to escape only to be stopped short of the exit by an angry Mohinder. In \\"Eris Quod Sum\\" Nathan and Tracy prepare to face off against Mohinder. He explains to them that since their abilities are synthetic they would both be beneficial to his research. When neither party agrees to Suresh's plea, he suddenly snatches Maya from her cocoon and retreats by using his strength and agility to crash through the skylight of his loft and escape. Bewildered, Nathan and Tracy begin to free Suresh's other cocooned victims when they are interrupted by Noah Bennet and his new partner, Nathan's ex-girlfriend Meredith Gordon. Upon glancing at Tracy, Meredith comments that \\"He still has a thing for blondes\\". After explaining his relationship to the other two people and Claire Bennet to Tracy, Noah asks them if Suresh injected anything into their bodies, then advises them to come to the Company to be checked out. Nathan then receives a call from his biological daughter Claire Bennet who relays the day's events to him, making him promise not to tell anyone where she is. Later, he and Tracy meet up with Claire and an injured Peter Petrelli, who reveals to him not only that their father Arthur Petrelli is still alive, but that he has absorbed his powers. Nathan is skeptical as he is adamant that their father is dead, however, Peter warns him that Arthur must be stopped or he will kill them all. Nathan asks Peter to tell him where their father is, but Peter is hesitant to answer. Claire discloses the information and gives him the name \\"Pinehearst\\". Peter then insists that because it is dangerous, he should not go there. Nathan feigns reassurance and tells Peter that they will shut Pinehearst down legally and promptly leaves. In the hallway, Tracy deduces that Nathan was lying and he confirms this by stating that he is preparing to go and see his father. In \\"The Eclipse\\", the powerless Nathan and Peter assist the Haitian in defeating his half-brother Baron Samedi, a posthuman warlord who uses his ability to make others believe he is a god. Seeing the damage that can be caused by power being in the wrong hands, Nathan concludes that his father's idea of creating a super-powered army would be the best way to deal with it. Leaving Peter behind, he flies away to join Pinehearst. After taking over Pinehearst from his father, Tracy informs him of a project involving giving abilities to 50 Marines. However, he is foiled when Peter, assisted by Flint and Knox, destroy Mohinder's lab and research and burn Pinehearst down. After Peter injects himself with the formula in order to escape and save both of their lives, Nathan, disgusted with his brother, tells Peter he wouldn't have done the same for him, and leaves. Fugitives Three weeks later, Nathan is talking with the President (portrayed by Michael Dorn) and convinces him that people with abilities need to be imprisoned. We later find out in the first episode of Fugitives, \\"A Clear and Present Danger\\", that Nathan has been appointed Chairman of Homeland Security by the President, giving him unlimited power to find and take his fellow evolved humans into captivity, whilst keeping the organization in the dark about his own ability. He plans to contain them and eventually find a cure for their abilities, but this is at odds to the aims of others working on the operation. Nathan hires Emile Danko, referred to as \\"The Hunter\\" by the fugitives, to work with Noah Bennett to try to capture the Heroes. Though Nathan's intentions with the Heroes are well-meaning, Danko sees differently. He wants to eliminate the people with abilities. This difference in perspective proves a strain in their working relationship, especially when Nathan orders Claire, his daughter, immunity. Despite allowing Peter to be targeted, Nathan tries to protect him as best as he can, risking everything to save Peter when he's shot by Danko and falls off a building. Nathan is aware that his plan is derailing in front of his eyes. He is finally able to fire Danko in \\"Shades of Gray\\" which leads The Hunter to confirm his theory about the senator having an ability; Danko pushes him out of a window and watches him fly away. At this point, Nathan, realizing Danko's next move, takes off for Costa Verde to pick up Claire. Though Nathan appears to be cold and calloused, he continues to show empathy for the fugitives. He repeatedly saves Peter, and tries to have a civil relationship with Tracy, whom he persuades to lie for him. He is the one who saves Claire when the agents barge into her room and attempt to kidnap her. In \\"Into Asylum\\" he flies Claire to Mexico in order to try to protect her, and while drunk confesses how badly he realized he had made mistakes and that he wants to try to fix them, so they head back to the US. In \\"Turn and Face the Strange\\", he communicates with Angela and then travels to Coyote Sands with Claire, where they reunite with Angela and Peter, and later in the night, with Noah. In \\"1961\\", he, Peter, Noah and Claire are digging on Angela's orders to find Alice. When Peter decides to get away, Nathan follows him to convince him to return, and once they hear about the sandstorm in Coyote Sands, they head back there. By the end of the day, he is the one who comforts Angela for losing Alice again, and invites her to join the family at the diner. He promises everyone to set things right by talking to the president, but then is shocked to see himself in a live press conference; when Noah identifies Sylar as seen in \\"I Am Sylar\\", Nathan resolves to stop him on his own, leaving everyone behind, not noticing that Peter is following him. Once he gets to his Senate office, he confronts Sylar and is nearly scalped by him, but instead he is \\"saved\\" by Danko who takes Nathan down. In \\"An Invisible Thread\\", Sylar plans to keep him alive a little longer while he acquires more of Nathan's memories in order to approach the President properly; when Claire shows up at the Senate office, Sylar impersonates Nathan and leaves the real one unconscious in the bathroom. Once he wakes up, he is found by Peter, and together they try to stop Sylar from reaching the President. As Nathan informs security agents about a threat against the President, he is forced to reveal his ability so they can be trusted to stop Sylar. Nathan and Peter finally confront him, with Peter and the now rescued Claire fleeing from the room once Sylar seemingly flies away from the building with Nathan out of the window, only for them to return to the room mere seconds later, with Sylar having empathically acquired Nathan's flight. In a shocking twist, Sylar slits Nathan's throat using his telekinesis and laughs, telling the dying Nathan that \\"Claire is going to be so mad at me.\\" After meeting with Matt and Noah, Angela discovers Nathan's body and breaks down in despair, convinced that Matt was supposed to save Nathan, as seen in one of her prophetic dreams. Angela manages to persuade Matt to use his ability on a tranquilized Sylar to make him think he is Nathan Petrelli, intending for Matt to use her own memories of Nathan to essentially 'plant' Nathan's personality in Sylar, hoping that Sylar's stolen power of clairsentience will help the new Nathan 'fill in the blanks'. Once Matt tells him that Sylar is dead, that he is Nathan and wipes his personal memory, Sylar shapeshifts into Nathan and wakes up. 'Nathan' later burns 'Sylar's' (really shape-shifter James Martin) body at Coyote Sands after having convinced the President to shut down the Building 26 operation and proclaims a new beginning. Redemption Six weeks later, 'Nathan' tells Angela that he hasn't felt like himself lately. He then becomes so fixated on a clock that is running fast that he doesn't even hear what Angela is saying, making her extremely worried. Angela tries to convince him he is simply going through a midlife crisis. 'Nathan' also begins to discover some of Sylar's abilities, namely telekinesis and electric manipulation. Angela later brings 'Nathan' various items from the old Nathan's past so he will absorb more memories using another of Sylar's acquired abilities, unbeknownst to him. A baseball cap causes him to visualize someone lying dead in a pool. After talking to Peter, he goes to Millie Houston's home and talks to her about her missing daughter Kelly, and, after touching various objects around the pool, realizes the truth: Nathan accidentally killed Kelly, and it is revealed that Angela hid the truth and had the Haitian erase his memory of it. 'Nathan' tells Millie the truth, and she sends an assassin after him who shoots him multiple times and buries him in a grave. However, he regenerates and emerges in the form of Sylar, suffering from amnesia. Nathan's memories begin to return to Sylar, and when distracted Sylar even briefly assumes Nathan's form once again. However, under the tutelage of Samuel Sullivan, Sylar is encouraged to recall his true self. In \\"Shadowboxing\\", Sylar wakes back up as 'Nathan', with no memory of not being Nathan and is frightened to discover himself at the Carnival and flies off to get Peter's help. He learns that Angela had his schedule cleared for an indefinite vacation. Peter brings 'Nathan' to learn the truth the Haitian directed him to. They find the real Nathan's dead body. 'Nathan' looks at the body's history via touching it and sees Matt Parkman. They find Matt in a hospital, where Peter heals him. Sylar's mind takes over Matt and replants itself in Sylar's body after a tense almost-showdown. 'Nathan' attempts to flee Peter, afraid that Sylar could take over his body, but Peter absorbs Nathan's ability of flight and follows. At Thanksgiving dinner, 'Nathan' and Peter get Angela to admit Nathan's status. Sylar takes over and tries to kill Angela, but Nathan's mind regains control and he flies away, distraught by what his mother has done to him. In \\"The Fifth Stage\\", 'Nathan' has since lost control again to Sylar, but Peter defeats him and helps Nathan regain control with mental manipulation. Peter takes him to the rooftop where he tried to convince Nathan he could fly and the two discuss it. Nathan starts to lose the fight to keep control of Sylar's body and doesn't care as he's accepted that he's really dead and that this isn't his body. He displays parts of Sylar's personality, and giving up, pushes Peter away after their embrace, and throws himself over the edge of the roof. Peter catches him and tries to convince him to pull himself up, but 'Nathan' tells him to give his goodbyes to Angela and to take care of Claire. He also tells Peter that he has always been all that's good in the world, and that the world hasn't seen anything (from evil) yet. When Peter claims he can't do it alone, 'Nathan' tells him he can and convinces him to let him go. After the two tell each other they love each other one more time, Peter lets go and 'Nathan' falls to his \\"death\\", body shape-shifting back into Sylar for the final time before landing on the roof of a car. Sylar survives by regenerating, and Nathan is seemingly gone for good. Peter and Angela later mourn his second death together. In \\"Upon This Rock\\", Nathan's death is faked as having occurred in a plane crash and he gets a full state funeral. At the funeral, Peter gives the eulogy, revealing that Nathan taught him the things his father should have and never was easy on him to prepare him for the real world which Peter believes that Nathan succeeded in. In \\"Let It Bleed\\", a wake for Nathan is held and a devastated Peter, unable to handle things, heads off to an office shooting to try to save people, believing its what Nathan would have wanted him to do. Peter defeats the shooter, but is injured until he replicates Claire's regeneration power and heals. Claire helps him confront Nathan's death and gets him to stop throwing himself into danger. Later, as a way of remembering Nathan, Peter replicates flight from Claire's ex-boyfriend West Rosen and goes for a flight after looking at a picture of himself and Nathan together. In \\"The Wall\\", Peter and Sylar end up trapped in Sylar's mind for what seems like five years to them. Sylar has absorbed Nathan's memories and seems to have some trouble differentiating between Nathan's and his own, resulting in Peter hitting him. At the end of the five years, Peter admits that he's no longer so angry at Sylar, but can't forgive him as he feels he won't be doing right by Nathan. Sylar realizes that Peter believes he'll lose Nathan if he forgives Sylar. Sylar gets Peter to realize that he's no longer the way he was and Peter finally accepts it and seems to forgive him for Nathan's death. In \\"Brave New World\\", Peter and Samuel Sullivan battle it out with Samuel saying that Nathan and his own brother Joseph let them down. This angers Peter who says Nathan never let him down, Nathan built him up and seems to draw more strength from this fact and eventually defeats Samuel. Heroes: Reborn In \\"June 13 - Part 1\\", Angela and Noah, with the help of Hiro, make a plan to separate Claire's twin children and have them grow up in 1999 for their own protection. Since Claire died before she could name the twins, Angela and Noah name them, with Angela choosing to name the boy Nathan after her son and his grandfather. It's later shown that Nathan is actually Tommy Clark.  Alternate futures   Genesis  In the future of \\"Five Years Gone\\", Nathan has been elected President of the United States; however, he is revealed to be Sylar masquerading as Nathan using Candice Wilmer's illusion-casting powers. After his identity is revealed to Peter, Sylar says Nathan had already turned against the heroes before he was killed, which Peter doesn't believe.  Villains  In the future of \\"I Am Become Death\\", Nathan is the President of the United States yet again, and is married to Tracy Strauss. After the future Claire captures the present Peter, Nathan asks him to read his mind to see if his intentions are sincere. While Peter admits that Nathan has good intentions, he tells him that he is wrong in his actions. Sylar's power then begins to overwhelm Peter, who begins to cut open Nathan's skull. Peter regains control halfway through and quickly stops, teleporting away. Future Nathan is last seen on the ground suffering massive bleeding from the head.  Powers and abilities  Shades Of Gray\\". Nathan possesses the power of self- propelled flight. He is one of the characters who has least demonstrated his power in the series, saying that he is afraid both of being seen as a freak and taken in for scientific study. In contrast, however, he also demonstrates a great deal of control over his power. As demonstrated in \\"Hiros\\", Nathan can reach speeds exceeding the sound barrier with no apparent adverse effects to him or his hair and clothes. As revealed in \\"Angels and Monsters\\", his power is synthetic; after discovering that Nathan did not possess the genetic code for abilities, his parents decided that the Formula be used on him. He first discovered his power when he inadvertently used it to save himself from a car crash which left his wife wheelchair-bound. The first on-screen flight is in \\"Genesis\\", when he attempts to save Peter from falling to his death. When the body of Sylar was being manipulated to assume Nathan's role, he possessed the range of abilities attained by the serial killer and used telekinesis, electrical manipulation, psychometry, shape shifting and Sylar's copy of flight. Of these, Nathan seemed to master telekinesis and psychometry- the latter being used to help 'Nathan' fill in the blanks in his personal recollections that Angela and Matt couldn't fill themselves- while he only used electrical manipulation by accident and shape shifting to take on his own form when taking control from Sylar.

The theater, which opened on Christmas Day, 1930, is a historic performing arts and community events center located in downtown Bakersfield, and hosts a variety of events, ranging from ballets, numerous community events, movies to contemporary pop and rock acts.  The early years  Bakersfield's Fox Theater opened on Christmas Day, 1930, with the feature film Just Imagine, a sci-fi film set 50 years in the future. The 1930s were a strong period for the Fox Theater. The silver screen featured the latest \\"talkie\\" pictures, and the stage was graced by numerous acts including Bakersfield native Metropolitan Opera baritone Lawrence Tibbett (1933); world- renowned soprano Kirsten Flagstad (1939); the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra (1939); and the classic pianist Arthur Rubinstein (1940). Because of the Fox Theater's Type I construction of poured concrete over steel, the theater withstood the 1952 Kern County earthquake which shook Bakersfield and leveled many buildings throughout the city. Theater is remodeled to Art Deco theme The Bakersfield Fox was an early work of Los Angeles theater architect S. Charles Lee. The exterior of the building is in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, as was the original interior. The 1500 seat auditorium was designed in the \\"atmospheric\\" style popularized by architect John Eberson, and featured a plain ceiling set with small lights to resemble stars in a night sky, while the walls were lined by decorative false walls with murals painted on the real walls behind them depicting open countryside, all meant to suggest that the auditorium was in fact a Mediterranean walled garden. Though the building survived the earthquake of 1952 intact, the following year the interior of the theatre was remodeled. The original Mediterranean theme was replaced with an Art Moderne motif, which was the style favored by Charles Skouras, then the head of Fox-West Coast Theatres. With the re-theme, a large concession area was added to the lower lobby of the theater. In the auditorium, the \\"garden walls\\" were stripped away, and the murals painted over. The ceiling's night sky effect with its twinkling recessed star lights was retained. A more limited remodeling of the building's exterior brought a new marquee, box office, and entrance foyer, embellished with glitzy neon signage, colorful terrazzo flooring, and bright metals. The remodel was representative of 1950s Hollywood style and showmanship. With this remodel, the screen was replaced with a state-of-the-art super-wide CinemaScope 20' x 45' format and the theater's projectors were upgraded with 6000-watt carbon arc lamps and anamorphic lenses. The Fox closes In 1977, after 47 years in business, the Fox Theater closed its doors. The theater re-opened for a brief period in 1983 and 1984, but would fall into decay until 1994.  The Fox Theater Foundation: Saving a historic landmark in downtown Bakersfield  In 1994, the Fox Theater was threatened by the inevitability of demolition. A small group of city businessmen and women joined together to save the theater, forming the Fox Theater Foundation. The Foundation's \\"Save the Fox\\" campaign raised enough funds from over 380 donors for the down payment on the building. Restoration began on July 1, 1994 and has been a slow, but on-going effort ever since. A large list of restoration and improvement projects is still present for the theatre.

The evening was divided between live music inside the theater, a slideshow with live commentary by Foundation board members, and dinner and dancing to live local music acts in the Theater's large storage and maintenance building, which was partially cleared out and re-decorated for the evening. The evening's highlight was a raffle for a $10,000 diamond pendant, to which all proceeds went the Fox Theater Foundation for bills and restoration projects.

One of the Boyne valley tombs. The prehistory of Ireland, pieced together from archaeological evidence, begins with the first evidence of humans in Ireland around 10,500 BC,\\"New Discovery Pushes Back Date of Human Existence in Ireland by 2500 years\\", Irish Archaeology and finishes with the start of the historical record around 400 AD. Both of these dates are later than for much of Europe and all of the Near East. The prehistoric period covers the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age societies of Ireland. For much of Europe, the historical record begins when the Romans invaded; as Ireland was not invaded by the Romans its historical record starts later, with the coming of Christianity. Bronze Age gold dress-fasteners and torc, amber necklace, Ulster Museum The two periods that have left the most spectacular groups of remains are the Neolithic, with its megalithic tombs, and the gold jewellery of the Bronze Age, when Ireland was a major centre of gold mining. Ireland has many areas of bogland, and a great number of archaeological finds have been recovered from these. The anaerobic conditions sometimes preserve organic materials exceptionally well, as with a number of bog bodies, a Mesolithic wicker fish-trap,100 objects, \\"Mesolithic fish trap\\" and a Bronze Age textile with delicate tassels of horse hair.Wallace and O'Floinn, 92, 3:4 Glaciation and the Palaeolithic During the most recent Quaternary glaciation, ice sheets more than thick scoured the landscape of Ireland, pulverising rock and bone, and eradicating any possible evidence of early human settlements during the Glenavian warm period;Herity and Eogan, start of Ch. 2 human remains pre-dating the last glaciation have been uncovered in the extreme south of Britain, which largely escaped the advancing ice sheets. During the Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 26,000‚Äì19,000 years ago), Ireland was an arctic wasteland, or tundra. This period's effects on Ireland are referred to as Midland General Glaciation, or Midlandian glaciation. It was previously believed that during this period ice covered two thirds of Ireland. Subsequent evidence from the past 50 years has shown this to be untrue and recent publications suggest that the ice sheet extended beyond the southern coast of Ireland.Greenwood, Sarah L., Clark, Chris D., \\"Reconstructing the last Irish Ice Sheet 2: a geomorphologically-driven model of ice sheet growth, retreat and dynamics\\", Quaternary Science Reviews, Volume 28, Issues 27‚Äì28, December 2009, Pages 3101-3123, online Map of Ireland during the last ice age ~~(the \\"first humans\\" annotation at bottom should be disregarded, and the existence of any \\"fresh water lake\\" is doubtful). During the period between 17,500 and 12,000 years ago, a warmer period referred to as the B√∏lling-Aller√∏d allowed for the rehabitation of northern areas of Europe by roaming hunter-gatherers. Genetic evidence suggests this reoccupation began in southwestern Europe and faunal remains suggest the existence of a refugium in Iberia that extended up into southern France. Those originally attracted to the north during the pre-boreal period would be species like reindeer and aurochs. Some sites as far north as Sweden inhabited earlier than 10,000 years ago suggest that humans might have used glacial termini as places from which they hunted migratory game. These factors and ecological changes brought humans to the edge of the northernmost ice-free zones of continental Europe by the onset of the Holocene and this included regions close to Ireland. However, during the early part of the Holocene Ireland itself had a climate that was inhospitable to most European animals and plants. Human occupation was unlikely, although fishing was possible. Britain and Ireland may have been joined by a land bridge, but because this hypothetical link would have been cut by rising sea levels so early into the warm period, probably by 16,000 BC, few temperate terrestrial flora or fauna would have crossed into Ireland.Edwards, R.J., Brooks, A.J. (2008) \\"The Island of Ireland: Drowning the Myth of an Irish Land-bridge?\\" In: Davenport, J.J., Sleeman, D.P., Woodman, P.C. (eds.), Mind the Gap: Postglacial Colonisation of Ireland. Special Supplement to The Irish Naturalists‚Äô Journal, pp 19-34, \\"The Island of Ireland: Drowning the Myth of an Irish Land-bridge?\\" Accessed 21 December 2018.An older view was that a land bridge to the English West Country existed until about 14,000 BC. See: K. Lambeck, P. Johnston, C. Smither, K. Fleming and Y. Yokoyama, Late Pleistocene and Holocene sea-level change, Annual Report of the Research School of Earth Sciences, ANU College of Physical & Mathematical Sciences, Canberra, 1995. Snakes and most other reptiles could not repopulate Ireland because any land bridge disappeared before temperatures became warm enough for them. The lowered sea level also joined Britain to continental Europe; this persisted much longer, probably until around 5600 BC.Cunliffe, 2012, p. 56. The earliest known modern humans in Ireland date back to the late Palaeolithic Age. This date was pushed back some 2,500 years by a radiocarbon dating performed in 2016 on a bear bone excavated in 1903 in the \\"Alice and Gwendoline Cave\\", County Clare. The bone has cut marks showing it was butchered when fresh and gave a date of around 10,500 BC, showing humans were in Ireland at that time.\\"New Discovery Pushes Back Date of Human Existence in Ireland by 2500 years\\", Irish Archaeology; In contrast, a flint worked by a human found in 1968 at Mell, Drogheda, that is much older, probably well pre-dating 70,000 BC, is normally regarded as having been carried to Ireland on an ice sheet, probably from what is now the bottom of the Irish Sea.Wallace and O'Floinn, 45, 2:3 - they date it to 400,000-300,000 BC; picture and different account A British site on the eastern coast of the Irish Sea, dated to 11,000 BC, indicated people were in the area eating a marine diet including shellfish. These modern humans may have also colonised Ireland after crossing a southern, now ice-free, land bridge that linked south-east Ireland and Cornwall, if it existed, or more likely, by boat. In the south, the Irish Sea facing South Wales was at the least a good deal narrower than today until 12,000 BC; in the north, the sea-crossing to Kintyre in Scotland, though much too deep to have ever been a land bridge, is even today only twelve miles at its shortest point and would then have been less. These people may have found few resources outside of coastal shellfishing and acorns, and so may not have continually occupied the region. The early coastline of Ireland is now almost entirely under the sea, so evidence of coastal populations is lost, though ways of investigating undersea sites are being explored. The return of freezing conditions in the Younger Dryas, which lasted from 10,900 BC to 9700 BC, may have depopulated Ireland. During the Younger Dryas, sea levels continued to rise and no ice-free land bridge between Great Britain and Ireland ever returned. Mesolithic (8000‚Äì4000 BC) Reconstruction of a hunter-gatherer hut and canoe, Irish National Heritage Park The last ice age fully came to an end in Ireland about 8000 BC.Herity and Eogan, Start of Ch. 2 Until the single 2016 Palaeolithic dating described above, the earliest evidence of human occupation after the retreat of the ice was dated to the Mesolithic, around 7000 BC.Wallace and O'Floinn, 45 Although sea levels were still lower than they are today, Ireland was very probably already an island by the time the first settlers arrived by boat, very likely from Britain. The earliest inhabitants of the island were seafarers who depended for much of their livelihood upon the sea, and later inland settlements or camps were usually close to water.Herity and Eoghan, Chapter 2 Evidence for Mesolithic hunter-gatherers has been found throughout the island: a number of the key early Mesolithic excavations are the settlement site at Mount Sandel in County Londonderry (Coleraine); the cremations at Hermitage, County Limerick on the bank of the River Shannon; and the campsite at Lough Boora in County Offaly. As well as these, early Mesolithic lithic scatters have been noted around the island, from the north in County Donegal to the south in County Cork.Driscoll, K. The Early Prehistory in the West of Ireland: Investigations into the Social Archaeology of the Mesolithic, West of the Shannon, Ireland (2006). The population has been tentatively estimated at around 8,000. The Moss-side hoard of Mesolithic Bann flake tools and blades, Ulster Museum.BBC, A History of the World in 100 Objects The hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic era lived on a varied diet of seafood, birds, wild boar and hazelnuts. There is no evidence for deer in the Irish Mesolithic and it is likely that the first red deer were introduced in the early stages of the Neolithic. The human population hunted with spears, arrows and harpoons tipped with small stone blades called microliths, while supplementing their diet with gathered nuts, fruit and berries. They lived in seasonal shelters, which they constructed by stretching animal skins or thatch over wooden frames. They had outdoor hearths for cooking their food. During the Mesolithic the population of Ireland was probably never more than a few thousand. Surviving artefacts include small microlith blades and points, and later larger stone tools and weapons, in particular the versatile Bann flake.Wallace and O'Floinn, 45-46, 2:1 Neolithic (4000‚Äì2500 BC) Many areas of Europe entered the Neolithic with a 'package' of cereal cultivars, pastoral animals (domesticated oxen/cattle, sheep, goats), pottery, weaving, housing and burial cultures, which arrive simultaneously, a process that begins in central Europe as LBK (Linear Pottery culture) about 6000 BC. Within several hundred years this culture is observed in northern France. An alternative Neolithic culture, La Hoguette culture, that arrived in France's northwestern region appears to be a derivative of the Ibero Italian-Eastern Adriatic Impressed Cardial Ware culture (Cardium pottery). The La Hoguette culture, like the western Cardial culture, raised sheep and goats more intensely. By 5100 BC there is evidence of dairy practices in southern England, and modern English cattle appear to be derived from \\"T1 Taurids\\" that were domesticated in the Aegean region shortly after the onset of the Holocene. These animals were probably derived from the LBK cattle. Around 4300 BC cattle arrived in northern Ireland during the late Mesolithic period. The red deer was introduced from Britain about this time. Reconstruction of an early Irish farmer's hut, Irish National Heritage Park. From around 4500 BC a Neolithic package that included cereal cultivars, housing culture (similar to those of the same period in Scotland) and stone monuments arrived in Ireland. Sheep, goats, cattle and cereals were imported from southwestern continental Europe, after which the population rose significantly. The earliest clear proof of farmers in Ireland or Great Britain is from Ferriter's Cove on the Dingle Peninsula, where a flint knife, cattle bones and a sheep's tooth were found and dated to c. 4350 BC. At the C√©ide Fields in County Mayo, an extensive Neolithic field system (arguably the oldest known in the world) has been preserved beneath a blanket of peat. Consisting of small fields separated from one another by dry-stone walls, the C√©ide Fields were farmed for several centuries between 3500 and 3000 BC. Wheat and barley were the principal crops cultivated. Pottery made its appearance around the same time as agriculture. Ware similar to that found in northern Great Britain has been excavated in Ulster (Lyle's Hill pottery) and in Limerick. Typical of this ware are wide-mouthed, round-bottomed bowls.100 objects, \\"Neolithic Bowl\\" This follows a pattern similar to western Europe or gradual onset of Neolithic, such as seen in La Hoguette Culture of France and Iberia's Impressed Cardial Ware Culture. Cereal culture advance markedly slows north of France; certain cereal strains such as wheat were difficult to grow in cold climates‚Äîhowever, barley and German rye were suitable replacements. It can be speculated that the DQ2.5 aspect of the AH8.1 haplotype may have been involved in the slowing of cereal culture into Ireland, Scotland and Scandinavia since this haplotype confers susceptibility to a Triticeae protein induced disease as well as Type I diabetes and other autoimmune diseases that may have arisen as an indirect result of Neolithisation. Some regions of Ireland showed patterns of pastoralism that indicated that some Neolithic peoples continued to move and indicates that pastoral activities dominated agrarian activities in many regions or that there was a division of labour between pastoral and agrarian aspects of the Neolithic. At the height of the Neolithic the population of the island was probably in excess of 100,000, and perhaps as high as 200,000. But there appears to have been an economic collapse around 2500 BC, and the population declined for a while. Monuments The most striking characteristic of the Neolithic in Ireland was the sudden appearance and dramatic proliferation of megalithic monuments. The largest of these tombs were clearly places of religious and ceremonial importance to the Neolithic population. In most of the tombs that have been excavated, human remains‚Äîusually, but not always, cremated‚Äîhave been found. Grave goods‚Äîpottery, arrowheads, beads, pendants, axes, etc.‚Äîhave also been uncovered. These megalithic tombs, more than 1,200 of which are now known, can be divided for the most part into four broad groups, all of which would originally have been covered with earth, that in many cases has been eroded away to leave the impressive stone frameworks: ;Types of Irish megalithic tombs File:Creevykeel2.jpg|Creevykeel court cairn, County Sligo. File:Knowth02.jpg|Knowth, a passage tomb at Br√∫ na B√≥inne. File:Pollnabrone.jpg|Poulnabrone dolmen, a portal tomb at The Burren. File:Glantane East Wedge Tomb.jpg|Glantane East wedge tomb. The entrance passage to Newgrange, and the entrance stone *Court cairns ‚Äì These are characterised by the presence of an entrance courtyard. They are found almost exclusively in the north of the island and are thought to include the oldest specimens. North Mayo has many examples of this type of megalith ‚Äì Faulagh, Kilcommon, Erris. *Passage tombs ‚Äì These constitute the smallest group in terms of numbers, but they are the most impressive in terms of size and importance. They are also found in much of Europe, and in Ireland are distributed mainly through the north and east, the biggest and most impressive of them being found in the four great Neolithic \\"cemeteries\\" of the Boyne (Br√∫ na B√≥inne, a World Heritage Site), Loughcrew (both in County Meath), Carrowkeel and Carrowmore (both in County Sligo). The most famous of them is Newgrange, one of the oldest astronomically aligned monuments in the world. It was built around 3200 BC. At the winter solstice the first rays of the rising sun still shine through a light-box above the entrance to the tomb and illuminate the burial chamber at the centre of the monument. Another of the Boyne megaliths, Knowth, has been claimed to contain the world's earliest map of the Moon carved into stone. *Portal tombs ‚Äì These tombs include the well known dolmens. They consist of three or more upright stones supporting a large flat horizontal capstone (table). They were originally covered with earth to form a tumulus, but often their covering has now eroded to leave the impressive main stone structure. Most of them are to be found in two main concentrations, one in the southeast of the island and one in the north. The Knockeen and Gaulstown Dolmens in County Waterford are exceptional examples. *Wedge tombs ‚Äì The largest and most widespread of the four groups, the wedge tombs are particularly common in the west and southwest. County Clare is exceptionally rich in them. They are the latest of the four types and belong to the end of the Neolithic. They are so called from their wedge-shaped burial chambers. The theory that these four groups of monuments were associated with four separate waves of invading colonists still has its adherents today, but the growth in population that made them possible need not have been the result of colonisation: it may simply have been the natural consequence of the introduction of agriculture. Portable artefacts The Malone Hoard of 19 luxury polished Antrim porcellanite axe-heads, dated 4,500-2,500 BC, found in Belfast, Ulster Museum. The stone axe was the primary and essential tool for farming, carefully made in a variety of styles, and often polished. The products of axe factories next to sources of porcellanite, an especially good stone, were traded across Ireland; the main ones were Tievebulliagh and Rathlin Island, both in County Antrim.Wallace and O'Floinn, 46-47, 2:4 There were also imports from Britain, including products of the Langdale axe industry of the English Lake District. There was a much rarer class of imported prestige axe head made from jadeite from north Italy; these may have been slowly traded across Europe to reach Ireland over a period reaching into centuries, and show no signs of use.100 objects, \\"Ceremonial Axehead\\", Wallace and O'Floinn, 46, 2:5 Miniature axes, too small to be useful, were made, and a \\"tiny porcellanite axe\\" has been found in a passage tomb; another example has a hole for a cord, and may have been worn as jewellery or an amulet. Other stone shapes made were chisels, adzes, maces and spearheads. Only one decorated macehead has been found, in one of the tombs at Knowth, but it is extremely fine. Some finds may also be miniature maceheads.Wallace and O'Floinn, 46-47, 2:1-9; 100 objects, \\"Flint Macehead\\" Pierced beads and pendants are found, and two necklaces of shells (from Phoenix Park in Dublin) are very carefully made, with graded periwinkle shells; these were on the remains of two males. As an example of the exceptional preservation sometimes possible in items found in anaerobic bogs, part of a finely woven bag with circular handles has survived; it used reedy plant material wound round thin strips of wood. Decorated pottery, apparently made for funerary rather than domestic use, appears to imitate basketry patterns.Wallace and O'Floinn, 48, 2:10-14; 100 objects, \\"Neolithic Bag\\" Copper and Bronze Ages (2500‚Äì500 BC) Gold lunula, a type of ornament produced in the Bronze Age British Isles, especially Ireland. This example, probably made 2400-2000 BC, was found in Blessington, eastern Ireland. British Museum Metallurgy arrived in Ireland with new people, generally known as the Bell Beaker People (Indo-Europeans) from their characteristic pottery, in the shape of an inverted bell.Michael Herity and George Eogan, Ireland in Prehistory (1996), p.114; M.J. O'Kelly, Bronze-age Ireland, in A New History of Ireland, vol 1: Prehistoric and early Ireland, edited by D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n (Royal Irish Academy 2005). This was quite different from the finely made, round-bottomed pottery of the Neolithic. It is found, for example, at Ross Island, and associated with copper mining there, which had begun by at least 2,400 BC.Wallace and O'Floinn, 49 There is some disagreement about when speakers of a Celtic language first arrived in Ireland. It is thought by some scholars to be associated with the Beaker People of the Bronze Age, but the more mainstream view is, or at least used to be, that \\"Celts\\" arrived much later at the beginning of the Iron Age.J.X.W.P. Corcoram, \\"The origin of the Celts\\", in Nora Chadwick, The Celts (1970); David W. Anthony, The Horse, the Wheel and Language: How Bronze-Age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world (2007). The Bronze Age began once copper was alloyed with tin to produce true bronze artefacts, and this took place around 2000 BC, when some \\"Ballybeg-type\\" flat axes and associated metalwork were produced. The tin needed to be imported, normally from Cornwall. The period preceding this, in which Lough Ravel and most Ballybeg axes were produced, and which is known as the Copper Age or Chalcolithic, commenced about 2500 BC. Tongue-shaped bronze dagger, Hunt Museum Bronze was used for the manufacture of both weapons and tools. Swords, axes, daggers, hatchets, halberds, awls, drinking utensils and horn-shaped trumpets are just some of the items that have been unearthed at Bronze Age sites. Irish craftsmen became particularly noted for the horn-shaped trumpet, which was made by the cire perdue, or lost wax, process. Copper used in the manufacture of bronze was mined in Ireland, chiefly in the southwest of the island, while the tin was imported from Cornwall in Britain. The earliest known copper mine in these islands was located at Ross Island, at the Lakes of Killarney in County Kerry; mining and metalworking took place there between 2400 and 1800 BC. Another of Europe's best-preserved copper mines has been discovered at Mount Gabriel in County Cork, which was worked for several centuries in the middle of the second millennium.Michael Herity and George Eogan, Ireland in Prehistory (1996), pp.115‚Äì6. Mines in Cork and Kerry are believed to have produced as much as 370 tonnes of copper during the Bronze Age. Ireland was also rich in native gold, and the Bronze Age saw the first extensive working of this precious metal by Irish craftsmen. More Bronze Age gold hoards have been discovered in Ireland than anywhere else in Europe. Irish gold ornaments have been found as far afield as Germany and Scandinavia, and gold-related trade was very possibly a major factor in the Bronze Age Irish economy. the Gleninsheen Gorget, 800-700 BC, National Museum of Ireland, no. 12 in A History of Ireland in 100 Objects.\\"A History of Ireland in 100 Objects\\" website In the early stages of the Bronze Age the gold ornaments included simple but finely decorated gold lunulae, a distinctively Irish type of object later made in Britain and continental Europe, and disks of thin gold sheet. Many of these seem to have been long in use before they were deposited. Later the thin twisted torc made its appearance; this was a collar consisting of a bar or ribbon of metal, twisted into a spiral. Other types of gold jewellery made in Ireland during the Bronze Age, most shared with Britain, include earrings,100 objects, \\"Basket Earrings\\" sun disks,100 objects, \\"Pair of Gold Discs\\" bracelets, clothes fasteners, and in the Late Bronze Age, the distinctively Irish large \\"gorgets\\",100 objects, \\"Gleninsheen Gold Gorget\\" and bullae amulets.Wallace and O'Floinn, 49-50, 2:15-21, 2:28-29 (Early to Middle) and 87-90, 3:6-24 (Late); 100 objects, \\"Coggalbeg Gold Hoard\\" After the Bronze Age goldwork almost ceased to be produced in Ireland;Wallace and O'Floinn, 93 the Irish deposits may well have been essentially exhausted. Twisted Gold Pennanular Ring, Late Bronze Age, Hunt Museum, Limerick. Construction of wedge tombs tailed off from about 2,200 BC,Wallace and O'Floinn, 51 and while the previous tradition of large scale monument building was much reduced, existing earlier megalithic monuments continued in use in the form of secondary insertions of funerary and ritual artefacts. Towards the end of the Bronze Age the single-grave cist made its appearance. This consisted of a small rectangular stone chest, covered with a stone slab and buried a short distance below the surface. The body might be cremated, or not. Decorated pots often accompanied the remains,100 objects, \\"Bronze Age Funerary Pots\\" and later cremated remains were placed inside the urn, which was turned upside-down, and might also have grave goods of various sorts. Numerous stone circles were also erected at this time, chiefly in Ulster and Munster. Crannogs are timber homes built in shallow lakes for security, often with a narrow walkway to the shore. Some use or extend natural islets, and the largest probably housed a number of families, and animals. It is thought that most of the 1,200-odd crannogs in Irelandwere begun in the Bronze Age, although many sites seem to have been used, continuously or intermittently, over very long periods, even into medieval times. The large Dowris Hoard, originally of over 200 items, mostly in bronze, has given its name to the Dowris Phase or period, as a term for the final phase of the Irish Bronze Age, about 900-600 BC. With 48 examples, the hoard contained all but two of the known examples of the distinctive \\"crotals\\", bronze rattles in the shape of a bull's testicle, as well as 26 horns or trumpets, weapons, and vessels.Wallace and O'Floinn, 86, 91, 125-126 The rather earlier Dunaverney flesh-hook (perhaps 1050‚Äì900 BC) is suggestive of a culture where elite feasting was important, and reflects influence from continental Europe; very large riveted bronze cauldrons were also made.Wallace and O'Floinn, 90-91, 125; 100 objects, \\"Castlederg Bronze Cauldron\\" Large numbers of bronze weapons were produced, and typical sword shapes changed from shorter ones for stabbing and thrusting on foot, to longer ones, perhaps for a mounted warrior to slash with.Wallace and O'Floinn, 53, 90 This is one example of a Dowris Phase design type originating in the Hallstatt culture of continental Europe, probably transmitted via southern Britain; chapes for scabbards is another.Wallace and O'Floinn, 125 During the Bronze Age, the climate of Ireland deteriorated and extensive deforestation took place. The population of Ireland at the end of the Bronze Age was probably in excess of 100,000, and may have been as high as 200,000. It is possible that it was not much greater than it had been at the height of the Neolithic. In Ireland the Bronze Age lasted until c. 500 BC, later than continental Europe and also Britain.√ì Cr√≥in√≠n, p. lx.

NMI, Dublin Iron Age (500 BC ‚Äì AD 400) Tribes of Ireland according to Ptolemy's Geographia (written c. 150 AD).After Duffy (ed.), Atlas of Irish History, p. 15. The Irish Iron Age has long been thought to begin around 500 BC and then continue until the Christian era in Ireland, which brought some written records and therefore the end of prehistoric Ireland. This view has been somewhat upset by the recent carbon-dating of the wood shaft of a very elegant iron spearhead found in the River Inny, which gave a date of between 811 and 673 BC. This may further erode the belief, still held by some, that the arrival of iron-working marked the beginning of the arrival of the Celts (i.e. speakers of the Proto-Celtic language) and thus Indo-European speakers, to the island.100 objects, \\"Iron Spearhead\\" Alternatively, many hold the view that this happened with the bearers of the Bell Beaker culture, probably Indo- European speaking, reaching Ireland during the earlier stage of the Bronze Age.A New History of Ireland, Volume I: Prehistoric and Early Ireland. D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n (Editor). The Celtic languages of Britain and Ireland, also known as Insular Celtic, can be divided into two groups, Goidelic and Brittonic. When primary written records of Celtic first appear in about the fifth century, Gaelic or Goidelic, in the form of Primitive Irish, is found in Ireland, while Brittonic, in the form of Common Brittonic, is found in Britain. The Iron Age includes the period in which the Romans ruled most of the neighbouring island of Britain. Roman interest in the area led to some of the earliest written evidence about Ireland. The names of its tribes were recorded by the geographer Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD.Wallace and O'Floinn, 171 The recorded tribes of Ireland included at least three with names identical or similar to British or Gaulish tribes: the Brigantes (also the name of the largest tribe in northern and midland Britain), the Manapii (possibly the same people as the Menapii, a Belgic tribe of northern Gaul) and the Coriondi (a name similar to that of Corinion, later Cirencester and the Corionototae of northern Britain). Up to about 150 BC there are many finds that show stylistic influence from continental Europe (as in the preceding Dowris Phase), and some direct imports. After that date relationships with British styles predominate, perhaps reflecting some movement of people. The Keshcarrigan Bowl, possibly made in Britain, is an example of this. Another cup found in Fore, County Westmeath does seem to be an import.Wallace and O'Floinn, 127, 4:8; 100 objects, \\"Keshcarrigan Bowl\\" Gold model boat from the Broighter Hoard, c. 100 BC. Examples from Iron Age Ireland of La T√®ne style, the term for Iron Age Celtic art, are very few, to a \\"puzzling\\" extent,√ì Cr√≥in√≠n, p. lx, \\"puzzling\\" although some of these are of very high quality, such as a number of scabbards from Ulster and the Petrie Crown, apparently dating to the 2nd century AD. This was well after Celtic art elsewhere had been subsumed into Gallo-Roman art and its British equivalent.Wallace and O'Floinn, 126-127, 130-131, 4:5, 4:18; 100 objects, \\"Petrie 'Crown'\\" Despite this it was in Ireland that the style seemed to revive in the early Christian period, to form the Insular art of the Book of Kells and other well-known masterpieces, perhaps under influence from Late Roman and post-Roman Romano-British styles. The 1st century BC Broighter Gold hoard, from Ulster, includes a small model boat, a spectacular torc with relief decoration influenced by classical style, and other gold jewellery probably imported from the Roman world, perhaps as far away as Alexandria.√ì Cr√≥in√≠n, 137‚Äì152; Wallace and O'Floinn, 128-129, 4:10-14; 100 objects, \\"Broighter Boat\\" The headland of Drumanagh, near Dublin and not yet fully excavated, may have represented a centre for trade with Roman Britain. Drumanagh is an example of the coastal promontory fort, using cliff headlands with a narrow neck to reduce the extent of fortification necessary. In Ireland these seem to be mainly a feature of the Iron Age,Wallace and O'Floinn, 126 with some perhaps dating to the Bronze Age, and also continuing to be used into the Early Medieval period. Although today seen as mostly dating from the early historic period, some of the perhaps 60,000 ringforts or raths in Ireland date back to the Late Iron Age. These vary greatly in size and function, with smaller ones a single-family farmstead (with slaves), or merely an enclosure for animals, and larger ones clearly having a wider political and military significance.Charles-Edwards, 151; Wallace and O'Floinn, 126 Model reconstruction of the circular building at Navan Fort, c. 100 BC. There are several ringforts in the complex topping the Hill of Tara, which seems to have its origins in the late Iron Age, although the site also includes a Neolithic passage grave and other earlier tombs. This is one of a number of major sites connected in later literature and mythology with kingship, and probably had a ritual and religious significance, though it is now impossible to be clear as to what this was. Navan Fort (Emain Macha), another major hilltop site, had a very large circular building constructed on it about 100 BC. It was forty metres across, with 275 tree-posts in rings. The largest was the central post, a tree felled about 95 BC. Within the century following the whole building was destroyed, apparently in a ritual fashion.Charles-Edwards, 146-147 Other large-scale constructions, requiring a good degree of social organization, include linear earthworks such as the Black Pig's Dyke and Cliadh Dubh, probably representing boundaries, and acting as hindrances to cattle-raids, and \\"toghers\\" or wooden trackways across boggy areas, of which the best-known is the Corlea Trackway, a corduroy road dated to 148-147 BC, and about a kilometre long and some three metres wide.Megalithic Ireland.com, Corlea Trackway The late Iron Age saw sizeable changes in human activity. Thomas Charles-Edwards coined the phrase \\"Irish Dark Age\\" to refer to a period of apparent economic and cultural stagnation in late prehistoric Ireland, lasting from c. 100 BC to c. AD 300.Charles-Edwards, p. 145. Pollen data extracted from Irish bogs indicate that \\"the impact of human activity upon the flora around the bogs from which the pollen came was less between c. 200 BC and c. AD 300 than either before or after.\\"Charles- Edwards, p. 148. The third and fourth centuries saw a rapid recovery. The reasons for the decline and recovery are uncertain, but it has been suggested that recovery may be linked to the \\"Golden Age\\" of Roman Britain in the third and fourth centuries. The archaeological evidence for trade with, or raids on, Roman Britain is strongest in northern Leinster, centred on modern County Dublin, followed by the coast of County Antrim, with lesser concentrations in the Rosses on the north coast of County Donegal and around Carlingford Lough. As Roman Britain collapsed politically, there was even settlement by Irish people, and leaders, in Wales and western Britain.Charles-Edwards, 155-162, map 8; 100 objects, \\"Cunorix Gravestone\\" Inhumation burials may also have spread from Roman Britain, and had become common in Ireland by the fourth and fifth centuries.Charles-Edwards, pp. 175‚Äì176. It was also during this time that some protohistoric records begin to appear. Early Irish literature was not written down until much later, in the Early Medieval period, but many scholars are ready to accept that the saga cycles preserve in some form elements from much earlier, that give some insights into the world of the last elites of prehistoric Ireland. Bog bodies The bog body called Clonycavan Man, died 392 to 201 BC, NMI The large areas of bog in Ireland have produced over a dozen ancient bog bodies, mostly from the Iron Age. Some were found and reburied before archaeological and scientific investigation was possible. Some survive as skeletons only, but the best-preserved have retained their flesh, hair, and clothing. The oldest appears to be the Neolithic Stoneyisland Man, perhaps the victim of a canoeing accident around 3320‚Äì3220 BC. Cashel Man died violently about 2500-2000 BC in the early Bronze Age, and is one of the possible ritual killings; it is now thought these were deposed kings sacrificed after being seen to fail in their rule, perhaps after crop failures.Kingship and Sacrifice, NMI; \\"Laois 'bog body' said to be world's oldest\\", The Irish Times. 2 August 2013. Two Iron Age examples of apparent elite victims of ritual killing are Old Croghan Man and Clonycavan Man, both from approximately 400 to 175 BC.100 objects, \\"Armlet, Old Croghan Man\\" Other bodies appear to have been normal burials. Collections Almost all prehistoric Irish finds remain in the British Isles. Some are in local museums, but much the most significant collections are in Dublin, Belfast and London. The first \\"national\\" collection for Irish antiquities was the British Museum in London, where many finds from before and after it was established in 1753 have ended up. However, from the foundation of the Dublin Royal Irish Academy in 1785 there was a local rival, which became the main destination of objects that were newly-found, or appeared on the market. The Dublin Society also formed a collection, though this was less important for antiquities. The society was founded in 1731, and by 1733 had opened a museum. Both these collections were transferred to the new \\"Museum of Science and Art\\", now the National Museum of Ireland, by 1890.Wallace and O'Floinn, 4-9 A legal dispute in which the Crown challenged the British Museum's purchase of the Broighter Hoard was won in 1903, and marked the acceptance on all sides of the Dublin museum as the Irish national collection.Wallace and O'Floinn, 8 This was a hoard found in what became Northern Ireland after Irish independence. Northern Ireland had seen its many important finds of antiquities passing to first London and then Dublin, and the Ulster Museum was only recognized as a national museum for antiquities in 1961. This had developed out of the collections of the Belfast Natural History Society, later renamed the Belfast Municipal Museum and Art Gallery, and was renamed again in 1961. Despite this, the pace of new finds has meant that it has an important collection.

George W. Bush (born 1946) was born in the city of New Haven, Connecticut as the eldest of six children. He grew up in the Texan cities of Midland and Houston and studied at Yale University and the Harvard Business School before serving in the Texas Air National Guard. Bush would later be part owner and managing partner of the Texas Rangers baseball franchise, become governor of Texas and eventually become the 43rd President of the United States. Upbringing and education George W. Bush with parents and siblings in the early 1960s. In the front row, from left to right, stand his younger brothers Neil Bush, Marvin Bush, and Jeb Bush In the back row are his younger sister Dorothy Bush, himself, his mother Barbara Bush, and father George H. W. Bush. George Walker Bush, the oldest son of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Bush, was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 6, 1946. Some of his paternal ancestors had emigrated from Somerset in the West Country of England to North America in the seventeenth century. They were connected with the Salem witch trials: Mary Parker, executed for witchcraft, was an 8th great-grandmother, and Bush descended from, or was otherwise related to, as many as 217 people involved in the trials. When Bush was just two years old, his father moved the family from New Haven to the town of Odessa in West Texas to begin a career in the oil industry. According to George W., then age two, the family lived in one of the few duplexes in Odessa with an indoor bathroom, which they \\"shared with a couple of hookers\\".George W. Bush interview with Bob Schieffer on Face the Nation (aired November 9, 2014) He was subsequently raised in Midland and Houston, Texas, with siblings Jeb, Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy. A younger sister, Robin, died of leukemia in 1953 at the age of three, when Bush was 7. His parents came to pick him up from school two days after her death; Bush ran up to their car hoping to see Robin with them, and they told him the news. Bush understood that his sister had died, but his younger brother Jeb did not. The family spent the summers and most holidays at the Bush Compound in Maine. The Midland boyhood home of Bush. Bush attended Sam Houston Elementary School and San Jacinto Junior High School in Midland, Texas. He later moved to The Kinkaid School in Piney Point Village, Texas for two years. Afterward, like his father, Bush attended Phillips Academy (September 1961‚ÄìJune 1964\\"History and research .\\" George W.

W. Bush (1948) and grandfather Prescott S. Bush (1917) were also members of Skull and Bones. Bush was also in the Yale First XV rugby union team in 1968.He was a C student, scoring 77% (with no As and one D, in astronomy) with a grade point average of 2.35 out of a possible 4.00. Bush joked that he was known more for his social life than for his grades.\\"Self- Deprecating Bush Talks to Yale Grads\\" , FoxNews.com, May 21, 2000. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history in 1968. The entire entry from his yearbook read: Bush's 1970 application to the University of Texas School of Law was rejected, and after his service in the Texas Air National Guard he entered Harvard Business School in 1973. He graduated with a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree in 1975, the first U.S. president with an MBA. Rugby Bush was a keen rugby union player, during high school and Yale University.Cain, Nick & Growden, Greg \\"Chapter 21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby\\" in Rugby Union for Dummies (2nd Edition), p297 (pub: John Wiley and Sons, Chester, England) Clarke, Wes Famous Ruggers, retrieved 24th August, 2009 He played at the position of fullback for Yale's 1st XV, and in 1968 was in the Yale team that dramatically defeated Harvard. Service in the Air National Guard After graduating from Yale University, Bush joined the Texas Air National Guard on May 27, 1968, during the Vietnam War, with a commitment to serve until May 26, 1974. He was promoted to first lieutenant on the November 1970 recommendation of Texas Air National Guard commander Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. He served as an F-102 pilot until 1972. Bush was discharged from the Texas Air National Guard and transferred to inactive duty in the Air Force Reserve. He was honorably discharged from the Air Force Reserve on November 21, 1974, at the end of his six-year service obligation. Alcohol use and DUI arrest Bush had described his days before his religious conversion in his 40s as his nomadic period and irresponsible youth. Although Bush states that he was not an alcoholic, he has acknowledged that he was \\"drinking too much\\".Kristof, Nicholas, How Bush Came to Tame His Inner Scamp, The New York Times, July 29, 2000 On September 4, 1976, Bush was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol near his family's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. He admitted his guilt, was fined US$150, and had his driving license in the state briefly suspended.The Smoking Gun: Archive During the 2000 presidential campaign, Bush said that he gave up drinking after waking up with a hangover after his 40th birthday celebration: \\"I quit drinking in 1986 and haven't had a drop since then.\\" He ascribed the change in part to a 1985 meeting with Reverend Billy Graham, after which he began serious Bible study, as well as to gentle but persistent pressure from his wife, Laura.

Today Kittinger is known for the high-quality furniture it produces that is featured prominently in the White House. History The Kittinger Company was founded in Buffalo, New York, in 1866 as \\"Thompson, Colie & Co.\\" Around 1870 the company began crafting hand-made upholstered furniture and by this time had changed its name to \\"Colie & Son\\" after George and Oliver Colie took control. The furniture business proved so successful for the Colie's that in 1885 they built a factory specifically for the crafting of furniture.Design Journal:Kittinger Furniture, Inc. Advertising in 1904,The American Cabinet Maker and Upholsterer October 15, 1904, p. . Colie and Son illustrated one of their armchairs, that showed they were still making furniture in the free Colonial Revival style for their \\"snappy, original styles in Parlor Suites, Odd Chairs, Divans, Easy Chairs etc.\\" Reproductions more closely based on original American 18th- century pieces of furniture would come to characterize the firm's production under George Colie's son-in-lawKittinger Furniture Company: history In 1913, Irvine J. Kittinger, George Colie's son-in-law, and his brother Ralph purchased the company from the Colie family and changed the company's name to the Kittinger Furniture Company. Under the Kittinger family's control, the company's primary focus was to craft the highest quality furniture possible with Irvine Kittinger saying \\"Our business is not primarily to turn furniture into money, but to produce something really worthwhile.\\" By 1929, the company was grossing $1,000,000 annually.Design Journal: Kittinger Furniture, Inc. The Kittinger family controlled and remained involved with the company until they sold their interests in 1966. Between 1966 and 1990, Kittinger Furniture had a total of six owners due to mergers and acquisitions of its corporate owners. In 1995 the company entered bankruptcy after a private owner was sentenced on fraud charges. A former Kittinger employee purchased the Kittinger name and production rights in 1996. The new company has subsequently been profitable. Today Kittinger is one of the oldest surviving crafters of fine built-to-order furniture in the United States. Showrooms and production Kittinger Furniture is available through several showrooms across the country. Kittinger's primary showroom is located at its factory and corporate offices. Showrooms in Georgia, New Jersey, New York City and Pennsylvania represent and carry Kittinger. In 2012 Kittinger Furniture opened a showroom in Tokyo, Japan, at the Sala Azabu store. Every piece of Kittinger Furniture is built- to-order to customers‚Äô specifications and needs in Buffalo, New York, and can be shipped around the world. In recent years Kittinger has become a resource for collectors to create reproductions of hard to find pieces or in different scales that fit their needs. Special projects The White House Nixon's Cabinet with Kittinger furnitureA number of Kittinger reproductions can still be found in the West Wing office area of the White House in Washington, D.C. Colonial Williamsburg Foundation interior designers were commissioned by President Richard Nixon in 1970 to redo the interior design of the President's offices. Kittinger Company furniture was used extensively in the redesign since this company was the sole licensee of furniture for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation's famous program to produce exact reproductions of 18th century antiques. Included in the redesign was a new conference table and chairs for the cabinet room. President Nixon wrote a personal check to pay for the new cabinet room table custom made by The Kittinger Company and donated it to the White House. Along with furnishing areas of the White House, the Kittinger Company has also produced furniture for the inaugurations of former President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. In 2005, the White House commissioned six chairs from Kittinger for the second inauguration of former President George W. Bush. In 2009, the White House commissioned an additional two chairs and utility table for the inauguration of President Barack Obama.http://www.furnituretoday.com/article/162714-Kittinger_Vanguard_help_furnish_White_House.php The White House reused the pieces crafted by Kittinger again for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2013.

Name The word \\"woomera\\" comes from the Dharug language of the Eora people of the Sydney basin. The name was adopted for the town of Woomera, South Australia, founded in 1947 as the home of the Anglo-Australian Long Range Weapons Establishment, also known as the \\"Woomera Rocket Range\\" and now called RAAF Woomera Range Complex.RAAF Base Woomera Retrieved 15 July 2017. Description The woomera is in length. One end is wide and possessing a hollow, curved cross-section not unlike an airfoil, while the other is more pointed and has a hook. Some woomera were traditionally decorated with incised or painted designs that indicated belonging to a particular linguistic group that it may be returned to if found abandoned. Use A sharp stone attached to the end of the handle Records show that the implement began to be used about 5,000 years ago,, although the Mungo Man remains from at least 43,000 years ago show severe osteoarthritis in the right elbow associated with the use of a woomera. It is still used today in some remote areas of Australia.. Like spears and boomerangs, woomeras were traditionally used only by men. Some woomeras, especially those used in the central and western Australian deserts,Gould, Richard A. (Richard Allan) (1970). Spears and spear throwers of the Western Desert Aborigines of Australia. American Museum of Natural History, New York were multi-purpose tools.Cundy, B. J. (1989). Formal variation in Australian spear and spearthrower technology (Vol. 546). British Archaeological Reports Ltd. Chicago Often shaped like long narrow bowls, they could be used for carrying water-soaked vegetable matter (which would not spill and could later be sucked for its moisture) as well as small food items such as little lizards or seeds. Many woomeras had a sharp stone cutting edge called a tula adzeWorld Prehistory: In New Perspective attached to the end of the handle with black gum from the triodia plant. This sharp tool had many uses, such as cutting up game or other food and wood. It is supposed that the woomera could be used as a shield for protection against spears and boomerangs. The woomera is held in one hand while the other hand places the butt of the spear on the woomera's hook; the hollow curved shape facilitates this alignment without looking. The woomera effectively lengthens the thrower's arm, greatly increasing the velocity of the spear. Correcting for the game animal's lateral dodging is accomplished by tilting the wing-shape woomera during the throw for last- second corrections. The kinetic energy of a spear launched from a woomera has been calculated as four times that of an arrow launched from a compound bow. Different aboriginal groups had different shapes and styles of woomera. For example, the Woomera of the central desert tend to be very wide and slightly bowl shaped where as those of the Kimberley are flat long and narrow.

Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was released in May 2011 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2011 for Microsoft Windows, and in November 2017 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Set within Los Angeles in 1947, the story follows Detective Cole Phelps's rise among the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) as he solves a range of cases across five divisions. When he is tasked with investigating a morphine distribution ring that involves several of his former squadmates from World War II, Phelps finds both his personal and professional life falling into a turmoil, and reluctantly joins forces with his former estranged comrade, Jack Kelso. As the pair delve deeper into the case, they uncover a major conspiracy about the Suburban Redevelopment Fund program and several prominent figures in Los Angeles involved with it. The open-world design lets players freely roam Los Angeles's open landscape, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The story is centred on the case sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects; the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed. L.A. Noire also contains elements found in action-adventure games, such as side missions and a branching storyline. The game uses licensed music provided by an in-game radio, and features an original score. The development of L.A. Noire began in 2004, shortly after the founding of Team Bondi, and was shared between the multiple Rockstar studios around the world. The game was delayed numerous times through its seven-year development, which included a change of publisher and platforms. The working hours and managerial style of the studio was met with public complaints from staff members, and Team Bondi closed shortly after the game's initial release. The development team found influence from the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir‚Äîstylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity‚Äîalong with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes of the time for its in-game cases. The game is notable for being the first to use the newly developed MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions from every angle. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as the player is required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game. Extensively marketed, L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival, and received widespread critical acclaim for its advances in storytelling, presentation, and facial animation technology. It had been reported to ship over five million copies worldwide. L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files, a subset of the game's cases for virtual reality supported through the HTC Vive, was released on 15 December 2017.  Gameplay  L.A. Noire is an action-adventure neo-noir crime game played from a third-person perspective. The player completes cases‚Äîlinear scenarios with set objectives‚Äîto progress through the story. The game also features a mode which allows the player to freely roam the open world and engage in optional activities. The world features multiple landmarks, which are all based on real monuments from 1940s Los Angeles. The game takes place in the city of Los Angeles, in the year 1947, with the player assuming the role of Los Angeles Police Department officer, and later detective, Cole Phelps. The game starts with Phelps as a uniformed patrolman, and follows his career as he advances through the police department bureaus (desks) of Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each desk gives the player a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation of a number of cases based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns the player with cases that they must solve. After each case, the player receives a rating of 1‚Äì5 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area for clues to the crime, the player can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps's war memories. Near the end of the final desk, the player assumes control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the player character for most of the remaining cases; although different in appearance and personality, his controls are identical to Phelps. When interrogating witnesses and suspects, the player has the option to believe them, doubt them, or accuse them of lying. The game blends investigative elements with fast- paced action sequences, including chases, combat, interrogations and gunfights. The player character uses melee attacks and firearms to fight enemies, and may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the world. In combat, auto-aim and a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. Should player characters take damage, the character's health will gradually regenerate. Weapons can only be used in appropriate circumstances, such as during firefights. When driving vehicles, the player has the option to skip directly to the destination by nominating their partner as the driver. The player can also ask the partner for directions. In addition to storyline cases, the player may engage in optional side investigations, known as Street Crimes, that are not related to the case that they are working on. Some street crimes will feature characters from previous cases. Suspects and witnesses in a case can be interrogated for information. When the interviewee responds, the player is given the option to either believe them, doubt them, or accuse them of lying. If the player accuses them of lying, they must submit evidence to prove it. When interrogating two suspects at the police station, the player may decide whom to charge with the crime; charging the wrong suspect affects the player's end rating. The player is presented with the option to skip past an action sequence and continue through the narrative if they fail it three times. There is also a free roam mode called \\"The Streets of L.A.\\", which is unlocked after each crime desk is completed, except for the Patrol desk. In this mode, the player and his partner are allowed to freely roam the city of Los Angeles. The player can replay Street Crimes, find Golden Film Reels, discover Landmarks, collect Hidden Vehicles, find Badges or just cruise around and listen to the radio. Plot Following the end of World War II, Cole Phelps (Aaron Staton), a decorated United States Marine Corps veteran, returns to Los Angeles and works as a patrol officer of the LAPD. In 1947, after successfully solving a major murder case and being promoted to detective, Phelps earns a reputation over the next six months for solving difficult cases for both the Traffic and Homicide divisions; he most notably concludes the Black Dahlia case. Upon being promoted into the Vice division, he becomes involved in the investigation into military surplus morphine syrettes being sold on the street, stolen from the ship that had brought home his former Marine unit. He learns that several members of his former unit had stolen and distributed the morphine, only for them to be assassinated on the orders of Mickey Cohen (Patrick Fischler), who controlled the city's drug trade. During this time, Phelps falls for German lounge singer Elsa Lichtmann (Erika Heynatz) and has an affair with her. Roy Earle (Adam J. Harrington), Phelps's partner in Vice and a corrupt cop, helps several prominent figures in the city draw attention away from a major prostitution scandal by exposing Phelps's adultery before he is able to draw a confession from Courtney Sheldon (Chad Todhunter), a member of Phelps's former unit, over his involvement with the stolen morphine. In exchange, Earle is given a place in a syndicate known as the Suburban Redevelopment Fund (SRF)‚Äîa program founded under the pretense of providing affordable housing for returning veterans. Phelps's marriage ends, he becomes disgraced in the LAPD, and he is demoted to the Arson desk, where he is tasked with investigating a number of suspicious house fires. Despite noting a strong connection between them and a housing development that the SRF operates, Phelps is warned off by Earle from pursuing the syndicate and its founder, tycoon developer Leland Monroe (John Noble). Seeking help, Phelps prompts an old comrade, Jack Kelso (Gil McKinney), now an investigator for the California Fire & Life Insurance Company, to look into the matter. Kelso discovers that the development is using unsuitable building materials and that his boss Curtis Benson (Jim Abele), a member of the SRF, is insuring them despite this fact. Following a shootout at Monroe's mansion, Kelso learns that the syndicate used a patient of prominent psychiatrist Harlan Fontaine (Peter Blomquist), a member of the SRF, to burn down the homes of those who would not agree to sell their property to the fund; eventually, his patient accidentally killed four people in one such fire and became irreversibly traumatised. Confronting Fontaine at his clinic, the patient murders Fontaine and kidnaps Elsa. Investigating Fontaine's clinic, Phelps discovers that the syndicate was a front to defraud the US Federal Government: Monroe would acquire land with money invested by the syndicate and build surreptitiously cheap houses on them to increase their value, knowing the government would later purchase the plots through eminent domain to make space for a new freeway. Phelps also discovers that Sheldon, overcome with guilt, had provided Fontaine with the stolen morphine under the pretense that Fontaine would legally provide the morphine to medical facilities with the profits being reinvested into the SRF; Sheldon was later murdered by Fontaine after gaining knowledge of Kelso's investigation into the SRF. Kelso realises that Fontaine's patient was Ira Hogeboom (J. Marvin Campbell), a former flamethrower operator from his and Phelps' unit who became severely traumatised after unintentionally burning out a cave of civilians on Phelps's orders. Phelps and Kelso pursue Hogeboom and Elsa into the Los Angeles River Tunnels. The pair rescue Elsa, and Kelso executes the incapacitated Hogeboom to end his suffering. As the water rises within the tunnels following intense rainfall, the group attempts to escape, but Phelps is unable to reach the exit and drowns. A funeral is held for Phelps. As Earle delivers a eulogy for Phelps, Elsa leaves in disgust. Herschel Biggs (Keith Szarabajka), Phelps's Arson partner, tells Kelso that while Kelso and Phelps were never friends, they were not enemies either. In a closing epilogue flashback, Kelso is revealed to have known about the stolen morphine but refused to be involved in its distribution, knowing the trouble it would cause. Development Team Bondi began to develop L.A. Noire following their founding in 2004. Initially due to be published by Sony Computer Entertainment, the publishing rights were later handed over to Rockstar Games in September 2006. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between Team Bondi and multiple Rockstar studios around the world. Unlike other games by Rockstar, which run on their proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. that was developed around the PlayStation 3's unique Cell Synergistic Processing Units (SPUs). The game is notable for being the first to use MotionScan, developed by Team Bondi sister company Depth Analysis. MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects's reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than US$50 million, which would make it one of the most expensive video games ever made. The game is set in 1947 Los Angeles, and the open world was modelled accordingly. To model the city, the developers used aerial photographs taken by photographer Robert Spence. The team also used the photographs to create traffic patterns and public transport routes, as well as the location and condition of buildings. While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles, the team also took some artistic licence, such as including the appearance of the film set for D. W. Griffith's Intolerance; the set had actually been dismantled in 1919. In addition to recreating the city as it was in 1947, all of the in-game cases that the developers worked upon were each inspired in some part by the actual real-life crimes that the city's media reported on during that year. Each of the game's cases features at least a few of the real-life elements that were reported in newspaper articles of that time, with one example of a case that developers found inspiration for being the \\"Red Lipstick Murder\\". The case, part of the game's Homicide Desk, is based upon the facts and elements that were mentioned in articles about the real-life, unsolved murder of Jeanne French, a woman who was found dead in exactly the same conditions as the victim of the in-game case is found in, including the M.O. used on the victim, the state the body was left in, the lipstick message found on the body, and the initial suspect being the victim's husband, yet the in-game case differs from this in that it is closed by the main protagonist and not becoming a cold case towards the end of its investigation. The original (top) and the final (bottom) logo for the game. The original logo was created by Team Bondi, but Rockstar redesigned the L.A. Noire logo. After a secretive audition process, Aaron Staton and Gil McKinney were selected to portray protagonists Cole Phelps and Jack Kelso, respectively. Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology. In October 2003, Team Bondi announced their first project, for \\"a next-generation Sony platform\\". In 2004, McNamara said that the project was wholly funded by Sony Computer Entertainment America. The title of the game was not revealed until 2005, when they announced that L.A. Noire was to be released exclusively to the PlayStation 3. In September 2006, it was announced that Rockstar Games would be handling the publishing of the game. The debut trailer was released in November 2010, followed by a behind-the-scenes development video the next month. The game missed its original projected \\"fiscal 2008\\" release date, pushed back to September 2010 to allow for further polishing. This was later pushed to the first half of 2011, and then narrowed down to March 2011. Later, the final release date of 17 May 2011 was confirmed for North America, and 20 May 2011 for Australia and Europe. To spur pre-order game sales, Rockstar collaborated with several retail outlets to provide pre- order bonuses. A re-release of the game was announced on 7 September 2017 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with Virtuos handling the port. This enhanced version features finer texture details, upgraded weather effects, and new camera angles; the Switch version also features gyroscopic controls with the Joy-Con. All versions were released on 14 November 2017. Rockstar Games also announced L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files, a subset of seven of the game's cases for virtual reality support through the HTC Vive. Developed by Videogames Deluxe, a new studio founded by McNamara, the game was released on 15 December 2017. Support for Oculus Rift devices was added in March 2018.  Music production  L.A. Noire features an original score. The game's score accompanies the gameplay, alerting players at specific times. Like other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire also contains licensed music tracks provided by an in-game radio. Over thirty songs, from artists such as Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, feature in the game. To work on the score, the team engaged Andrew Hale and Simon Hale, as well as Woody Jackson, who had previously collaborated with the team on Red Dead Redemption (2010). Recorded at Abbey Road Studios, the score was inspired by orchestral scores from 1940s films. In addition to the original score and licensed tracks, the game also features original vocal recordings in order to create an authentic sound to suit the musical identity of the period. When The Real Tuesday Weld were commissioned to compose the original compositions, they sought vocals that could \\"evoke the period\\", ultimately falling upon Claudia Br√ºcken. Three vocal tracks were produced: \\"(I Always Kill) The Things I Love\\", \\"Guilty\\", and \\"Torched Song\\". The game's score won the award for Best Original Score at the 2012 BAFTA Video Games Awards. Additional content Several standalone cases, collectibles and challenges for the game were released as downloadable content in the months following its release. \\"The Naked City\\", released on 31 May 2011, is a standalone Vice case that follows the murder of a model. It is based on Jules Dassin's 1948 film of the same name. \\"A Slip of the Tongue\\", released on 31 May 2011, is a Traffic case that focuses on a grand theft auto. \\"Nicholson Electroplating\\", released on 21 June 2011, is an Arson case based on the 1947 explosion of the O'Connor Electro- Plating company. \\"Reefer Madness\\", released on 12 July 2011, is a Vice case that leads the detectives to further conspiracies about illegal reefer operations. \\"The Consul's Car\\", released on 26 July 2011, is a Traffic case that follows a grand theft auto; initially released exclusively for North American PlayStation 3 versions, \\"The Consul's Car\\" was later made purchasable in Europe, and eventually included in The Complete Edition. All in-game items initially available as pre-order content were also made available as downloadable content on 31 May 2011: two suits, the Broderick and the Sharpshooter; two guns, the Nickel Plated Pistol and the Chicago Piano Gun; and the Badge Pursuit Challenge, challenging players to collect badges placed around the game world. On 28 September 2011, Rockstar announced the PC version of the game, subtitled The Complete Edition, which was released on 8 November 2011 in North America and 11 November 2011 in Australia and Europe. It contained all downloadable content from the original versions. Enhancements include keyboard remapping and gamepad functionality, increased fidelity, graphical enhancements, and stereoscopic 3D support. The Complete Edition was made available for consoles shortly afterwards.  Reception  L.A. Noire received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. L.A. Noire has been widely praised for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. The first review was published by UK newspaper The Guardian, which awarded L.A. Noire a perfect score, praising its similarity to film. GameZone also compared the game to older movies and felt that its attention to detail set it apart from other games. PlayStation: The Official Magazine compared L.A. Noire to an AMC television series that slowly builds and gets viewers hooked. Edge praised the facial technology, and pointed out that while there are no other major aspects of the game that had not been done better elsewhere, the fact that Team Bondi had brought together such a wide range of game genres in such a stylish, atmospheric, and cohesive manner was an achievement that few developers had managed. GameSpot's Carolyn Petit praised the game's investigation system and overall style, while GamesMaster concluded that L.A. Noire is the most mature Rockstar open-world game. Official Xbox Magazine said that the game was the closest thing the Xbox 360 had to Heavy Rain, but noted that it was \\"flawed\\". IGN also thought L.A. Noire resembled Heavy Rain, albeit a poorer version. They did feel that the game \\"almost succeeds\\" at creating a new structure for video games. Joystiq stated that \\"L.A. Noire may not always be 'fun' in the traditional sense, but it's also unsatisfied with being 'merely fun', and the result of that aspiration is something that no one who cares about video games should miss.\\" Despite the overall positive reception, some reviewers thought that the game had too many redundancies in the cases and left too little control to the player, leading to the game being boring at times. Although 1UP gave it a perfect score, they also warned that the extended-cut scenes in the game could make some players feel they lost control of the action. GameTrailers concluded that the game's repetition dragged down, but that it was still an overall positive experience that focused more on the characters than other games. Responding to criticism that accused the characters' bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, defended the game in an interview with Eurogamer. McNamara felt that people were responding to the realism in the faces and it made the bodies look lifeless by comparison because of the lack of animation on characters' clothing. In the same interview McNamara also noted that Phelps responds aggressively to certain prompts because the game was originally written as \\"coax, force, and lie\\". When the game came out, it was changed to \\"truth, doubt, or lie\\" which made Phelps commonly take awkward stances from what the player expected. At the 2012 BAFTA Video Game Awards, L.A. Noire won the award for Best Original Score, the game was also nominated in seven other categories. The Nintendo Switch and VR versions were nominated for Best Remake/Remaster in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards, and for the Tappan Zee Bridge Award for Best Remake at the New York Game Awards 2018, while the VR version itself was nominated for \\"Best VR Audio\\" at the 16th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards. Sales On the day of the game's U.S. release, shares in Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar Games' parent company, closed up 7.75% on the day; a three-year high for the company. The rise was attributed to the positive reviews that L.A. Noire had been receiving. In the last available figures from February 2012, the game had shipped almost 5 million copies. According to NPD Group, L.A. Noire was the best-selling game in the United States in May 2011, at 899,000 copies across the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. L.A. Noire went straight to top of the UK games chart and became the fastest-selling new intellectual property in the UK (a record it held until the 2014 release of Watch Dogs). It stayed top of the UK game chart for three weeks. In Australia, video game stores in major cities reported that the game was going out of stock after a week. L.A. Noire was released in Japan on 7 July and sold a combined 71,057 units on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The PlayStation 3 version topped the chart, with 58,436 units sold, and the Xbox 360 version moved 12,621 units. Possible sequel On 22 May 2011, McNamara said that a sequel to L.A. Noire would take less than the five years it took to develop the first as the technology already exists. He also stated that they were considering using the MotionScan technology for full body performances rather than only faces. The same week, in an investor conference call, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick said that L.A. Noire was \\"a very successful release\\" and that they \\"have every reason to believe that L.A. Noire is another strong franchise for this company\\". He reiterated that they \\"do see L.A. Noire as a powerful new franchise\\". During an investor call in November 2011, Zelnick re-iterated the importance of the game to Take-Two, stating that the game \\"has become an important franchise for the company.\\" He announced that the game was Take-Two's \\"most successful new release\\" in the past fiscal year and has become a key property in its portfolio. Also in November 2011, it was announced that McNamara's next game would be titled Whore of the Orient, described as \\"one of the great untold stories of the 20th century\\". It was to be developed by KMM Interactive Entertainment, a studio set up by Kennedy Miller Mitchell after acquiring most Team Bondi assets in August 2011, but was confirmed to be cancelled in June 2016. On 13 February 2012, Rockstar Games answered numerous fan questions about their games, including a question regarding the future of the L.A. Noire franchise. Rockstar said that they are \\"considering what the future may hold for L.A. Noire as a series\\", adding that they \\"don't always rush to make sequels\\". They also announced that no further DLC or additional content would be developed for the current edition. In March 2013, Karl Slatoff, chief operating officer of Take-Two Interactive, revealed that the company has an \\"extensive pipeline of unannounced titles in development\\" and mentioned that the L.A. Noire franchise was important to the company.

Its main purpose is to protect the capital, Damascus, from any foreign or domestic threats. The Guard was the only Syrian military unit allowed within the capital city before the civil war. History The Guard was formed in 1976 when anti-Syrian Palestinian groups launched attacks on Syrian officials. Major-General Adnan Makhlouf commanded the Guard from 1976 until 1997. The Republican Guard is used mostly to protect top Syrian government officials from any external threats and to serve as a counter-weight to the other powerful Syrian Army formations near the capital, the 4th Mechanized Division, the 3rd Armoured Division, and the 14th Special Forces (Airborne) Division. Many members of the Assad family have served in the Republican Guard. Bashar al-Assad was a Colonel, and was given control of a brigade. His younger brother Maher was also a Colonel in the Republican Guard. Structure At the outset of the 2011 conflict, the Republican Guard included three mechanized brigades and two ‚Äúsecurity regiments.‚Äù The overall force structure is comparable to a conventional mechanized infantry division, but like the 4th Armored Division, the Republican Guard is outfitted with better equipment and maintained at full strength. Order of Battle (2017) In the last days of October 2017, Jane's Information Group published in its Jane's Intelligence Review an article on the current military situation of the Syrian Arab Army and its future challenges. The text reflects the transformation that the battle order has presented through the conflict, from the old order of battle of the soviet influence to the current one, more adapted to the new challenges. Before 2011, it was difficult to access reliable information about the SAA because of the Damascus government‚Äôs sensitivity to potential espionage, particularly by Israel. However, the civil war has provided analysts with considerable insight into the Syrian military. * 101st Infantry \\"Security\\" Regiment * 102nd Infantry \\"Security\\" Regiment (part of 30th Division?)https://www.mei.edu/sites/default/files/2018-12/RG%20Report%2012-12.pdfhttp://www.timripley.co.uk/articles/Operation- Aleppo/2016-Battle-of-Aleppo-24-09_17-11-2016.pdf * 103rd Commando Brigade ** Syrian Marines * 104th Airborne Brigade (merged with the 800th Regiment) * 105th Mechanized Brigade * 106th Mechanized Brigade * 124th Special Forces Brigade (part of 30th Division) * 800th Regiment* (merged with the 104th brigade) * 80th Battalion 83rd Battalion 416th Regiment 112th Brigade* 117th Brigade** The main ground combat unit of the Syrian military is often called a brigade or regiment and is between 500 and 1,000 strong. This is considerably smaller than a corresponding Western formation of that designation. For reasons of esprit de corps, these retain their pre-civil war titles as tank, infantry, mechanised, artillery, special forces, airborne, or Republican Guard brigades or regiments. However, their internal organisation is now very different from their pre-civil war structure. (*)They are subunits that were previously subordinated to one of the original brigades, but that for tactical reasons of the civil war became independent units that depend directly on the General Staff. They perform functions as minor task forces. (**)New Creation Other alleged units:- *Lionesses of Defense Armored Battalion *100th Artillery Regiment *102nd Commando Regiment *30th Division *Popular Security and Support Forces Operational History in the Syrian Civil War At the beginning of the Syrian civil war, the Republican Guard kept out of the conflict, with only the regular Syrian Armed Forces fighting. In June 2012, the Republican Guard clashed with rebels near its housing compounds and bases in the suburbs of Qudsaya and al-Hamah, about 8 kilometers from central Damascus. The unit has been accused by Human Rights Watch of engaging in human rights abuses during the conflict. In 2012, Republican guard units played an important role in repelling opposition offensives on Damascus and Aleppo. Later on, Republican Guard units were deployed to government bases in the North and East of the country, in order to bolster and stiffen the resistance against rebel advances. 400 Syrian Republican Guard fighters were reportedly called in as reinforcements during the Battle of Al-Hasakah. The 103rd brigade reportedly operated in the Latakia province where (in 2013) it assisted other pro-government units in stopping opposition assaults on the Alawit heartland. The brigade also reportedly participated in offensive operations which partially expelled rebels from the Latakia province. The 124th brigade reportedly participated in the unsuccessful defense of the Tabqa airbase in 2014. The brigade reportedly defended the Ithriya-Khanasser highway thus preserving a major supply line to Aleppo. The brigade was reported in January 2018 directing the capture of the al-Hass Plain and the Offensive towards Abu- Duhur from the north (Front of South¬¥s Aleppo) The 104th brigade is well known in the media due to its multi-year ordeal in defending Deir ez-Zor. Deployed to the area in late 2012, according to some sources (other sources state that the brigade was not deployed to Deir ez-Zor before early 2014), the brigade, along with other SAA elements, defended pro-government-held territory in Deir ez-Zor. The brigade has been largely under siege since January 2015 (the Syrian Arab Air Force in cooperation with the Russian Aerospace forces maintain an air bridge). In early 2018 reports emerged that the unit was transferred back to Damascus. In 2016 elements of the 102nd, 106th brigades and the 800th regiment were reported to have taken part in the successful Aleppo campaign which expelled opposition elements from the city. In late 2016 and early 2017, together with other pro-government units, the 800th regiment was reported to have stopped an ISIL offensive by defending the T4 airbase and preventing a possible ISIL assault on Homs. 105th brigade was largely employed in Damascus and the surrounding areas, mainly focusing on the East Ghouta front which has been an opposition stronghold for years, reportedly containing 25,000 opposition fighters. Following several deployments to the Aleppo front the 106th brigade reportedly returned to the Damascus operating area where it continued combat operations. On October 18, 2017, Issam Zahreddine, a Major General leading the Syrian government's fight against ISIL in Deir ez-Zor and known as \\"Lion of the Republican Guard,\\"http://www.jerusalemonline.com/news/middle-east/the-arab-world/senior- level-syrian-army-official-killed-in-battle-31809 was killed when a land mine struck his vehicle in the Hwaijet Saqer area of Deir ez-Zor's countryside during a military operation. Uniform and insignia The Republican Guard uniform is distinct from the regular Army uniform. Service dress consists of red berets, rather than the standard black or green, red epaulettes, red lanyards, and brown leather belts with green camouflaged shoes. On ceremonial occasions, officers wear red peaked caps instead of a beret. Weapons The Republican Guard tends to usually be better equipped than the standard Syrian Army. The Republican Guard has been documented and photographed using the American made M-16 5.56x45mm rifle. https://twitter.com/aln54dz/status/1012939641656434688. The Soviet made AKM 7.62x39mm rifle is also used with a folding stock which makes it the AKMS variant. The AK-74 and the AKS-74U Carbine is used along with the more modern AK-74M which both are chambered for 5.45x39mm. The AK-74M rifles are believed to have entered Syria in the mid to late 1990s following a deal with Russia.The AK-74M is also sometimes seen with an NSPU night vision optic sight or a GP-25 Grenade Launcher in some cases. https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2015/02/19/from-russia-with-love-syrias- ak-74ms/ Members of the Republican Guard have also been seen with the Glock handgun which is in their holster. https://twitter.com/Zinvor/status/526033304978722818/photo/2 The Makarov PM 9x18mm pistol has also been seen in use with the Guard and in holsters. Maher al-Assad, who is in the Republican Guard as a Commander and also is the brother of current President Bashar al-Assadl, is seen with a Springfield Armory XD pistol in his holster while visiting troops. https://syrianobserver.com/EN/news/51233/maher-al-assad-visits-frontlines-in- idleb.html The NSV machine gun chambered for 12.7√ó108mm has also been used by the Republican Guard during the civil war and is usually seen being used whilst the guard members are in a building firing at rebels. The PKM machine gun chambered in 7.62x54mmR is also used by the Republican Guard. https://14milimetros.com/la-ultima-carta-de-issam-zahreddine/ See also * Issam Zahreddine * Republican Guard * Presidential Guard References Further reading * Kenneth M.

Born in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, he was the son of United Empire Loyalists from New York. His family settled in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island around 1787. Bagnall received a limited education on the island but apprenticed with his brother-in-law, a printer, who left Prince Edward Island for the United States. There, Bagnall received experience on two newspapers that his brother-in-law published. He returned to Prince Edward Island in 1804 with a printing press and was appointed King's Printer by the Lieutenant Governor, Edmund Fanning. The newspaper business was unprofitable but better arrangements were made for government printing with Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres, the new Lieutenant Governor. Bagnall made a successful entry into colonial politics with his election to the General Assembly in 1808. However, the economics of the printing business in such a small center made him leave briefly for Nova Scotia where he had limited success with two newspapers. Bagnall returned to Prince Edward Island in 1810 and, from that point onward, struggled to keep his printing business viable. He also returned to politics with some success but his main accomplishments were as a printer. By that endeavour, he ensured that the colony was kept informed through his printed material.

The poem was first published in 1915 in the \\"little magazine\\" Others: A Magazine of the New Verse (New York), edited by Alfred Kreymborg.Thus the poem is in the public domain in the United States and similar jurisdictions, as it is not affected by the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, which extends copyright for works first published after 1922. It is a \\"musical\\" allusion to the apocryphal story of Susanna, a beautiful young wife, bathing, spied upon and desired by the elders. The Peter Quince of the title is the character of one of the \\"mechanicals\\" in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Stevens' poem titles are not necessarily a reliable indicator of the meaning of his poems, but Milton Bates suggests that it serves as ironic stage direction, the image of \\"Shakespear's rude mechanical pressing the delicate keyboard with his thick fingers\\" expressing the poet's self-deprecation and betraying Stevens's discomfort with the role of \\"serious poet\\" in those early years.Bates, p. 117. The poem is very sensual‚ÄîMark Halliday calls it Stevens' \\"most convincing expression of sexual desire\\".Robert Buttel, \\"On 'Peter Quince at the Clavier'\\" (Honorable mention might go to \\"Cy Est Pourtraicte, Madame Ste Ursule, et Les Unze Mille Vierges\\".) But \\"Peter Quince\\" has dimensions beyond Susanna's ablutions and the elders' desire. For instance, the poem's Part IV contains a stunning inversion of Platonism and related theories about universals, such as the universal (property, feature) beauty. Instead of saying that beauty is an abstract unchanging Platonic Form existing perfectly in a world separate from the five senses, or an abstract unchanging concept in the mind, the poem says that, paradoxically, \\"Beauty is momentary in the mind\\": only transient beauty in the flesh is immortal. Kessler notes that \\"Unlike Plato or Kant, Stevens strives to unite idea and image.\\"Kessler, p. 58 Robert Buttel observes that each of the four sections has its \\"appropriate rhythms and tonalities\\", reading the poem as \\"part of the general movement to bring music and poetry closer together\\".Buttel He describes Stevens as \\"the musical imagist\\" and credits the musical architecture with organically unifying the poem. Some don't like it. For the New York Times poetry critic writing in 1931, it is a specimen of the \\"pure poetry\\" of the age that \\"cannot endure\\" because it is a \\"stunt\\" in the fantastic and the bizarre.The New York Times \\"Turning of music into words, and words into music, continues throughout the poem,\\" according to Janet Mcann, \\"becoming metaphor as well as genuine verbal music.\\" She instances the line \\"Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna\\" as mimicking the plucking of strings as well as suggesting the sexual itch. Because music is feeling, not sound, the analogy between music and poetry is tight. Poetry is feeling too. Other commentators bring out Stevens' use of color images: \\"blue-shadowed silk\\", \\"green evening\\", \\"in the green water\\", even the \\"red-eyed elders\\". This is a reminder that he insisted also on the analogy between poetry and painting. In The Necessary Angel Stevens speaks of identity rather than analogy: \\"...it is the identity of poetry revealed as between poetry in words and poetry in paint.\\"Stevens, p. 159. Eugene Nassar explores a more abstract reading (and a more contentious one), according to which the poem is about the poet's \\"imaginative faculty\\", and Susanna represents the poem and the creative process of writing it. Laurence Perrine objects that Nassar's reading does violence to the poem and the story it leans on, naively ignoring Stevens\\" own \\"violence\\" in yoking a character from A Midsummer Night's Dream named in the title with a biblical narrative alluded to in The Merchant of Venice. The greatest \\"violence\\" that Stevens' poem does, though, is to Susanna's biblical reputation for righteousness. Adaptations With all its innate musicality, it is not surprising that the poem has been adapted for music twice. Dominick Argento set it as a \\"Sonatina for Mixed Chorus and Piano Concertante,\\" and Gerald Berg set it for bass voice, clarinets, percussion and piano. Both works have been recorded.

Built by the brothers of the Society of Mary, the chapel is named after the Pacific Island of Futuna on which the missionary Peter Chanel, to whom the project is dedicated, was martyred in 1841. It was awarded the New Zealand Institute of Architects gold medal in 1968 and its 25-year Award in 1986. The Historic Places Trust has placed it on its register as a Category 1 Historic Site. History The Society of Mary's Karori Centre was formed in 1948 by converting an Edwardian villa previously owned by Sidney Kirkcaldie of Kirkcaldie & Stains Ltd. In 1958 Hawke's Bay architect John Scott was approached to design the Futuna Retreat Chapel. The Chapel was built in 1961 by the brothers themselves, with the only sub-contractor being an electrician. Siting The building was originally located on a property at 62-66 Friend Street, Karori, Wellington. Set back from the street, the building is entered from the north-west corner. The Chapel was then situated between three existing buildings, an administration block and two accommodation blocks. Construction Floors are of concrete slab construction and paved with flagstones internally. The walls are a combination of in-situ concrete and concrete block. Walls have a rough plaster finish both inside and out, and concrete block walls are left exposed. The roof is of timber framed construction and was originally clad with asbestos shingles. The main roof is supported by a central timber post and braced with timber struts. The ceiling features exposed rafters and timber sarking. The triangular clerestory windows are formed of gridded clear and coloured perspex. The pews are made of concrete supports and timber benches. Also materials were local Significance In Futuna Chapel, John Scott employed a composite language that references a number of different architectural traditions. The central timber post can be seen as an interpretation of the centre posts of the traditional MƒÅori meeting house or wharenui. The steeply pitched roof forms also allude to the entry porch of the wharenui, with its prominent sweeping barge boards (maihi). The influence of Le Corbusier may be discerned in the rough plastered concrete work, exposed concrete beams and the way the interior is dramatized by light brought into the building by high windows. Precedents may be seen at both Ronchamp and Sainte Marie de La Tourette. Care is taken to clearly express the junctions of different materials by negative detailing and the projection of beams past their point of support. The use of diagonal symmetry, gridded planning and modular dimensions all relate the building to both high modernism and classical architecture. The roof structure is exposed within the building, and the means of support are made explicit in the gothic tradition of a battle against gravity. The extensive use of timber for the roof, with exposed sarking, struts and rafters is typical of architect designed New Zealand houses of the 60's and 70's that delight in the virtuostic display of carpentry work. A book about the building called ‚ÄòVoices of Silence (New Zealand‚Äôs Chapel of Futuna)' was published by Victoria University Press 1987. The author was Russell Walden, then a Reader in the History of Architecture at Victoria University in Wellington. In the book, Walden sets out his thesis that the building represents a blending of MƒÅori and European architectural concepts. On one hand it is a modernist building that uses geometrical forms and influences of the Modern Movement. It also represents aspects of a Marae, such as a large centre pole and sharply sloping eaves. Walden claimed John Scott achieved a fusion of elements of architecture not seen before. Current condition In 2000, the Society of Mary had no further use for the Futuna Retreat and sold it to Wellington builder Art Potter. Subsequently, the buildings surrounding the chapel were removed and replaced with medium-density housing units designed by Hunt Davies Tennent Ltd. The chapel itself was protected from demolition by the Wellington District Plan. While the 66 residential properties now forming Futuna Village were being built, the chapel was used to store materials. While tarnished, most of the fixtures and fittings remain in good condition, but Jim Allen's centrepiece wooden sculpture of the Crucifixion disappeared. Concern about the building's future came from many quarters, leading to the formation of the Friends of Futuna Charitable Trust spearheaded by Simon Mclellan. After lengthy negotiations, an agreement was reached in 2006 between the Friends of Futuna Charitable Trust and Futuna Ltd for the sale of the Chapel and the parcel of land that it sits on to the Trust. A conservation plan is being developed by the Trust to carry out repairs and refurbishments so that the building can be appreciated as originally designed. The building fabric presents a number of challenges such as rot in some windows and externally exposed timber framing. The original asbestos diamond shaped roofing shingles were replaced by metal roofing tiles some time in the past which are unsympathetic to the architecture, and the search continues for a suitable solution. An accessible toilet was recently added to the building to enable a wider range of events to be hosted. In early September 2012 the missing Crucifixion sculpture was discovered by police on a farm in the Taranaki district. It was reinstalled in the building in early 2013 after being refurbished by the National Museum of New Zealand.

It is the final main installment in the decade running Shutok≈ç Battle series of games known as Tokyo Xtreme Racer in North America and Tokyo Highway Challenge in Europe, and was the last Genki- developed video game. Despite being the last Shutokou Battle game, this is the only Shutokou Battle game to be on the Microsoft console. Story After the 13 Devils have been defeated once more in the Kaido Circuit, Motoya Iwasaki, aka Speed King, disappeared suddenly, leaving without a trace. Since then, many drivers from all the Japan come to Tokyo in order to have his title of \\"Speed King\\". The hero here is the best friend of Iwasaki and beats Bloodhound, Midnight Cinderlla, Platinium Prince, Skull Bullet's gang & eventually, the Phantom 9. In the meantime, Bloodhound reveals to the racer why Iwasaki has been depressed for a long time : his girlfriend died because she was ill and Iwasaki wasn't there to support her. Since then, he hate himself for considering that racing was more important than his girlfriend. This explains why he was easily cajoled by Hamagaki during the events of Kaido Battle : Touge No Densetsu. But after the racer beats the Phantom 9, Iwasaki challenged him only to be defeated by his friend. It seems he died against the last rival in his dark blue Fairlady Z S30 : ???, for a tire screech is heard from the highway. Gameplay The player's objective in the game is to make a name of the player out on the highways of Tokyo. The player begins as an unknown driver and as the player progresses through the game by earning increasingly impressive nicknames or Handles as they're called in the game. The player begins the game with a small amount of currency before picking out the first car. When the player picks the first car, the player will begin a race against Iwasaki in the Nissan Skyline 350GT Coupe. After the player finishes the first race, the player will go out on the highways at the selected given day of time. The player will begin a race by flashing the high beams behind an opponent. Both the player and all opponents are given spirit point bars. These bars are depleted by being significantly behind the leader or by being involved with collisions. When a spirit point bar is completely drained, the spirit point bar's associated driver is forced to retire from the race. The player's victory will earn money which the player can use to upgrade the cars or to purchase new cars as well. Another feature of the game is the parking areas. A parking area is the place where the player can get more information about the other racers and the crews and to challenge some opponents. The player can challenge some opponents to a time attack battle which is essentially a traditional race where racers must follow a predetermined route to a specified finish line without any of the racers having to worry about any spirit point bars, three-way SP battles, four-way SP battles or one-on-one SP battles. The player can also challenge other opponents to spirit point battles as well. The further the player progresses in the game, the more challenges, cars, upgrades and highways will become available. Reception While Famitsu received the Japanese version very well, it did not receive well overseas. GameRankings gave it a score of 52.77%, while Metacritic gave it 54 out of 100. TeamXbox's Nate Ahearn rated the game 4.9 out of 10, saying, \\"Tuning the numerous parts of your car provides for some decent variation, but you‚Äôll soon figure out that the actual gameplay just isn't very good.\\" IGN's Erik Brudvig criticized the AI for being too easy, saying, \\"They can be blown away on every turn with only minimal drifting and turning skills.\\" Legacy Many famous rivals in the game were featured in Wangan Midnight for PlayStation 3, such as Jintei/Speed King in his Impreza GDB, The Three Dragons in their Supra JZA80's, and White Charisma in his RX-7 FD3S.

A number of thermo pot models offer an adjustable target temperature. Components An electric water boiler consists of a water reservoir with a heating element at the bottom. Some models offer multiple temperature settings. Other models are part of larger water systems that boil water and provide hot, cold, and lukewarm water. Water may be dispensed in various ways, e.g. by pouring, an electric pump or by pressing a large button that functions as a diaphragm pump. Electric water boilers have a built in thermostat that detects when water has reached its boiling point of to automatically shut off. Sedimentation Sedimentation is the accumulation within the water reservoir of natural minerals that exist in trace amounts in municipal water mains, mainly calcium carbonate. Heating the water causes the minerals to separate and fall to the bottom of the reservoir. This buildup can eventually create a variety of noises in gas boilers, reduce the efficiency of the unit and give rise to a sulfur (or rotten-egg) smell.

History The company was founded in February 1923 as Kikuchi Manufacturing Company in Nishi-ku, Osaka and manufactured Tiger brand vacuum flasks. In 1953, the companies name was changed to Tiger Vacuum Bottle Ind, Co., Ltd., and in 1983 to Tiger Vacuum Bottle Co., Ltd., and from 1999 to its present name, Tiger Magic-jar Corporation. In 1923, Tiger Corporation was established in Osaka by Takenori Kikuchi. At just the age of thirteen, he was sent to serve out an apprenticeship away from home. Every time he had to eat a stone-cold meal after working late, he remembered the warmth of the hot tea his mother had served when he was at home. He wanted to be able to let everyone enjoy a cup of hot tea to warm their bodies and hearts at any time. That was the start of Tiger Corporation. At the time, most vacuum bottles were made of glass and very fragile. With much trial and error, Takenori thought of placing a layer of cardboard between the inner and outer containers to protect the glass. When Japan suffered the Great Kanto Earthquake also in 1923, only Tiger vacuum bottles remained intact among the different products on shop shelves. Today when over 90 years have passed since its inception, Tiger remains committed to developing its products with creative ideas.

At , it is the third-largest single-mountain ski resort in the United States, behind Big Sky and Park City, featuring seven bowls and intermediate gladed terrain in Blue Sky Basin. Vail opened in 1962 and is one of 37 mountain resorts owned and operated by Vail Resorts, which also operates three other nearby ski resorts (Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, and Keystone). Vail Mountain has three sections: The Front-Side, Blue Sky Basin, and the Back Bowls. Most of the resort is wide open terrain with all types of trails. There are cruising runs accessible from most front side and Blue Sky Basin lifts, as well as the wide open Back Bowls, glades, and chutes. Vail has the fourth- largest area of skiable terrain in North America after Whistler Blackcomb, Powder Mountain, and Big Sky. Vail Village is modeled on Bavarian village styles, with pedestrian streets. Unlike other Colorado ski towns such as Aspen, Breckenridge, or Steamboat Springs, which existed as 19th century mining towns prior to the establishment of their ski resorts, the Vail village was built when the resort opened. History 1960s Vail Ski Resort was founded by Earl Eaton, Pete Seibert, Harley Higbie and others in 1962, at the base of Vail Pass, which was named after Charles Vail, designer of the highway that passed through the valley. During World War II, Seibert joined the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain Division which trained at Camp Hale, south of Vail, between Red Cliff and Leadville. During the training Seibert and Eaton became familiar with the surrounding terrain, areas of which would become resorts in later decades. They discovered a peak that they believed to be well-located and with good snow, calling it No-name Mountain, which later became Vail. Construction of the resort began in the then-uninhabited valley in 1962. It opened six months later on December 15. There were originally three lifts, including one gondola that ran from Vail Village to Mid-Vail on the line where Gondola One operates. Several double chairlifts were later built: Golden Peak, which ran from Golden Peak base area up to the Riva Bahn Express midstation; Giant Steps, which ran from Vail Village to the bottom of the Avanti Express lift; the Avanti double chairlift; and two double chairlifts out of Mid-Vail, the Mountaintop and Hunky Dory lifts. A double chairlift, High Noon, serviced the Sun Down and Sun Up Bowls on the backside of the ridge. As Vail grew, a village formed at the base near the gondola, which was taken down in the 1970s and replaced with a Lift Engineering double chairlift. 1970s In the 1970s, the construction of Interstate 70 had begun, replacing US Route 6. The opening of the Eisenhower Tunnel in 1973 provided easier access from Denver to ski resorts like Copper Mountain, Breckenridge and Vail. Also in the 1970s, President Gerald Ford and family vacationed at their Vail home, bringing it international exposure. Later, Vail Village was expanded. In 1970, Denver was awarded the 1976 Winter Olympics, with Vail later selected to host the skiing competitions. However, Colorado voters denied funding by a 3:2 ratio in November 1972 and the games were relocated to Innsbruck in Austria. By the mid-1970s, the mountain had been further expanded, with a second gondola added in the Lionshead area, which also included a residences and shops at the base of the slopes. On 26 March 1976, a goldola cable snagged on a support tower, and two cabins derailed, killing four people and injuring eight. The gondola was closed for the remainder of the season. Afterward, the original gondola in Vail Village was replaced with a double chairlift. 1980s In 1985, Doppelmayr constructed four high speed quads on the Front Side, making Vail the second mountain in the country to use them, after Breckenridge Ski Resort. It was the first to install multiple quads. These lifts were the Game Creek Express (#7), Mountaintop Express (#4), Northwoods Express (#11), and Vista Bahn Express (#16). The Vista Bahn Express replaced the double chairlifts out of Vail Village, bringing skiers from Vail Village to Mid-Vail. The Mountaintop Express lift replaced a Lift Engineering triple chairlift running from Mid-Vail to Patrol Headquarters, while the Northwoods Express and Game Creek Express lifts replaced Riblet double chairlifts. As part of Vail's 25th anniversary in 1988, Doppelmayr constructed two more high speed quads. On the front side, the Born Free Express (#8) replaced a Lift Engineering double chairlift out of Lionshead. In the Back Bowls, the Orient Express lift (#21) opened the China, Teacup, and Siberia Bowls. A year later, another high speed quad, the Avanti Express (#2), was built to replace another Lift Engineering double chairlift. Birds of Prey (ski course), Beaver Creek Vail hosted the Alpine Skiing World Championships in 1989. 1990s In 1992, Vail purchased a Doppelmayr triple chairlift from Beaver Creek the former Upper Horseshoe lift and installed it in Sun Up Bowl as the Sun Up (#17) lift. In 1993, Vail changed primary lift manufacturers, from Doppelmayr to Garaventa-CTEC, who installed three high speed quads. The first was the Pride Express (#26) lift in 1993, which serviced the upper part of the runs on the west Front Side, and combined with the Born Free Express lift, supplemented the Eagle Bahn Gondola as a way to get to Eagle's nest. In 1995, the Wildwood Express lift (#3) was built at Mid-Vail to replace Hunky Dory, a Lift Engineering fixed-grip quad. The lift reused the tower foundations of the original lift. In 1996, the Riva Bahn Express lift (#6) was built out of Golden Peak, improving access from Golden Peak to the rest of the mountain. That same year, the Eagle Bahn Gondola (#19) replaced the original Lionshead Gondola. Vail Associates bought Vail, Breckenridge, Keystone, and Heavenly in California in 1996. The company allowed skiers to buy an all-mountain pass that granted admission to all of their resorts. In the late 1990s, Vail decided to carry out a terrain expansion known as Category III, later renamed Blue Sky Basin. Despite widespread opposition from environmental groups over the potential that Blue Sky Basin would destroy lynx habitat, Vail received approval from the U.S. Forest Service to expand into Blue Sky Basin in 1999. In protest of the expansion, the Earth Liberation Front set fire to Two Elk Lodge, Camp One, Patrol Headquarters, and four chairlifts in October 1998, causing in damage. Most of the lifts suffered only minor damage. However, the drive station for the High Noon lift was destroyed, and later rebuilt. Two Elk Lodge was a total loss, and with no time to rebuild it, Vail replaced it for the 1998‚Äì1999 ski season with a temporary aluminum structure named \\"One Elk\\".Photo of \\"One Elk\\", March 1999 A new Two Elk Lodge and Patrol Headquarters were built the following year. In 1999, Blue Sky Basin, an intermediate-expert back-country area with moguls, tree skiing, cliffs, glades, and ridges, directly across a creek from the Orient Express lift, opened. The expansion was serviced with three new Poma high speed quads: the Teacup Express (#36), the Skyline Express (#37), and the Earl's Express (#38). The Teacup Express improved access to the Teacup Bowl trails, which beforehand had required riding the Orient Express lift and then traversing along a ridge and past Two Elk Lodge via a pair of rope tows. The new lifts opened in February 2000. The following winter, a fourth high speed quad, Pete's Express (#39), was opened, and an additional four trails on the east side of the Basin were added. The 1999 Alpine World Ski Championships were held in Vail/Beaver Creek. 2000s In 2004, the original Lionshead skier bridge was replaced with a newer, wider bridge. In 2006, Vail began offsetting all of its power usage by purchasing wind power credits. They were the second-largest corporation in the United States to do so. In summer 2007, after seven years without a new chairlift, Vail undertook a lift-upgrade project on the East Front Side, as Leitner-Poma built two new high speed quads. The lower of the two lifts, the Highline Express (#10), replaced a Riblet double chairlift that had been in operation since 1973. This lift reduced the ride up the Highline Trail from fifteen minutes to eight minutes. It services several long mogul runs on the east part of the Front Side, and is also one of the less-crowded sections of the mountain due to its remote location. Above the Highline Express, the Sourdough Express lift (#14) replaced a triple chairlift. It services a small pod of beginner trails, but is also used by regular skier traffic to move from Patrol Headquarters to the China Bowl and Blue Sky Basin. The new lift follows a slightly different alignment so as to eliminate a traverse from the original lift to Two Elk Lodge. The West Wall rope tow, which ran along the ridge between Two Elk Lodge and the top of the Teacup Express and Sun Up lifts was removed, redirecting ski traffic down the Whiskey Jack trail to the Sourdough Express. The original Sourdough triple chairlift was relocated to Eagle's Nest and reinstalled as the Little Eagle (#15) lift, replacing a Lift Engineering double chairlift. Around this time, Vail removed two of its older double chairlifts. Giant Steps, which had transported skiers out of Vail Village since 1962, was removed in 2006. In 2008, Minnie's, which serviced learning terrain below Eagle's Nest, was also removed. Minnie's had previously been used in conjunction with the Born Free Express to provide access to Eagle's Nest, but it was shortened in 1994 after the construction of the Pride Express, and operated in shortened form until its removal. A new plaza was opened at Vail Village in 2008. On 27 February 2010, one of the original black diamond trails into Vail Village, International, was renamed Lindsey's to honor Vail's Olympic gold medalist Lindsey Vonn. The trail is next to Giant Steps and one of two flanking the defunct Giant Steps lift line. 2010s In 2010, Leitner-Poma constructed another high-speed quad in the Back Bowls. The High Noon Express (#5) replaced a Doppelmayr triple chairlift that had been in use since 1979 and was the resort's 17th high speed quad to be built. The new quad increased capacity to the Sun Down and Sun Up Bowls, and reduced lengthy lines that the lift often received, especially on powder days. With the construction of the High Noon Express lift, all of Vail's terrain with the exception of the eastern edge of the Mongolia Bowl (only accessible by platter) was accessible from high speed quads. The High Noon Express lift was also meant to alleviate lines at the Northwoods Express lift by providing an alternative route for advanced and expert skiers finishing their time in Blue Sky Basin and the China Bowl to return to the Front Side. In 2011, Vail opened a new ski-in/out fine dining restaurant at mid-Vail. The Tenth, built between the Wildwood Express and the Mid-Vail facility, is named for the famed US Army division that trained nearby and several Vail founders once belonged. By 2012, Vail's original high speed quads from Doppelmayr were beginning to show their age and were due to be upgraded. The first to go would be the Vista Bahn Express, which as part of Vail's 50th anniversary celebration was replaced by a Leitner-Poma ten person gondola. Gondola One (#1) provides a fast, warm and sheltered ride between Vail Village and the Mid-Vail area. The construction of Gondola One saw the return of a gondola to the line that had contained Vail's original gondola until 1976, then contained a double chairlift on the lower section until 1985, and then the Vista Bahn Express from 1985 to 2012. For the 2013-2014 season, Doppelmayr built two new chairlifts.Vail Blog: 2013 lift upgrades Retrieved June 17, 2018. At Golden Peak base area, the resort's last remaining double chairlift, Gopher Hill (#12), was replaced with a recycled Doppelmayr triple chairlift purchased from Beaver Creek. The upgrade to Gopher Hill increased uphill capacity for the ski and ride school, especially for three- to six-year-old skiers and riders who must ride the lift with an adult. The bottom terminal was slightly moved from the original location. More significantly, Vail received their first high speed six pack with the replacement of the Mountaintop Express (#4) lift. It was the first new Doppelmayr detachable chairlift to be built at Vail since the Avanti Express lift in 1989. It increased uphill capacity on the lift line by 33% from 2,800 people per hour to 3,600 people per hour,Upgrading Mountaintop Express Retrieved June 17, 2018. matching the uphill capacity of Gondola One. The new lift follows a slightly different alignment from the old lift, with the bottom terminal being moved 90 feet east of its original location to decrease cross- traffic in the area. The Mountaintop Express was the first detachable chairlift in the western United States to utilize a conveyor belt at the loading area, a system that is widely utilized at European ski resorts, shown to cut down on stops and slows, shortening the ride time (several more six packs built at Vail Resorts properties around the same time would include a loading carpet, including the Colorado SuperChair at Breckenridge in 2014, the King Con Express at Park City Mountain Resort in 2015, and Vail's own Avanti Express lift). For the 2015-2016 season, Doppelmayr built a second high speed six pack to replace the Avanti Express (#2) lift. Just like the Mountaintop Express lift built two years before it, the Avanti Express lift was built with a loading carpet. Unlike its older sister, the Avanti Express reuses the towers from its predecessor. The fun park at Eagle's Nest was also expanded with the addition of a new zipline canopy tour in Game Creek Bowl, and the construction of an alpine coaster to the west of the Pride Express lift. For the 2016‚Äì2017 season, the Sun Up lift was replaced with a high‚Äìspeed quad by Leitner-Poma. The lift was also renumbered as lift #9, instead of lift #17, as Vail sought to plug numbering gaps in their lift system. With the installation of the Sun Up Express (#9) lift, all major uphill lifts on the mountain are high‚Äìspeed detachables, and the only fixed grip lifts are Cascade Village, Gopher Hill and Little Eagle. For the 2017-2018 season, Vail built their third high speed six pack when it contracted Leitner-Poma to upgrade the Northwoods Express (#11) lift, which at that point was the remaining lift servicing Patrol Headquarters that had not yet been upgraded. The upgrade to the Northwoods Express improved uphill capacity from 2,800 pph to 3,000 pph on the east Front Side, especially in the afternoon when skier traffic is using the lift to return from Blue Sky Basin and the China Bowl to the Front Side. With more than 5,289 acres and an average snowfall that has averaged 360 inches a year during the last thirty years, Vail is regarded as one of the best combinations of terrain and dependable snow in the country, often ranking No. 1 in Colorado. Vail has been the number one ski resort in the United States 14 times in a 17-year period. White River National Forest Vail Resorts operates on National Forest System lands under special use permit to the White River National Forest. Master Development Plans, Winter and Summer Operations Plans, Construction Plans, and every phase of the permit holder's skiing operation is approved by the federal government annually prior to construction and operation. In exchange for the use of National Forest system lands the resort pays an annual fee to the U.S. Treasury amounting to about one dollar per skier visit. Twenty-five percent of the fees collected are returned to Eagle County, Colorado, for roads and schools, in lieu of taxes. The federal government supports the objective of providing healthy recreation opportunities in quality natural outdoor environments. Millions of national and international users during all seasons of the year appreciate the opportunities provided by Vail Resorts and White River National Forest through the public and private partnership on federal lands. Reference: Code of Federal Regulations, Title 36: Parks, Forests, and Public Property, Part 251‚ÄîLand Uses, ¬ß 251.51 Definitions. Ski area ‚Äîa site and attendant facilities expressly developed to accommodate alpine or Nordic skiing and from which the preponderance of revenue is generated by the sale of lift tickets and fees for ski rentals, for skiing instruction and trail passes for the use of permittee- maintained ski trails. A ski area may also include ancillary facilities directly related to the operation and support of skiing activities. Forest Service feasibility studies In 1972 the White River National Forest analyzed the terrain surrounding Vail, Colorado, to determine ski area feasibility of the greater regional area and identify additional opportunities for public parking and access to National Forest lands between Vail Pass and Lake Creek above Edwards, Colorado. The investigation was stimulated by the planned construction of Interstate 70 in Colorado over Vail Pass, or alternative Red Buffalo Corridor, and the awarding of the '76 Winter Olympic Games to Denver, Colorado. by the International Olympic Committee with the showcase downhill event planned for the yet to be developed Beaver Creek ski area. New parking areas on Shrine Pass, Battle Mountain, Meadow Mountain, Minturn, Stone Creek, Avon, and Lake Creek were identified as development sites, base areas, and potential new skier entrance portals. Integration of Vail Ski Resort, including Blue Sky Basin, with skiing terrain on Battle Mountain, Grouse Mountain, Meadow Mountain, Stone Creek, Beaver Creek, and Lake Creek were analyzed and considered physically feasible as an integrated mega-resort with multiple portals. Twenty-eight ski lifts were planned for Grouse Mountain above Minturn, which was rated comparable to Snowmass in overall size and capacity with significant amount of terrain in the intermediate category with good snowfall. Findings were presented to William Lucas, Rocky Mountain Regional Forester, by Thomas Evans, Forest Supervisor, and Erik J. Martin, professional landscape architect, lead member of the Blue Ribbon study committee for ski area planning feasibility, and program manager for ski area administration. Grouse Mountain above Minturn was highly rated for developed alpine skiing and conceived by White River National Forest skiing experts as a potential future phase of a large mega-skiing complex on National Forest System lands linking the existing Vail ski area and Battle Mountain east of Minturn with Grouse Mountain, Beaver Creek, Meadow Mountain ski area, Bachelor Gulch, and Arrowhead on the west side. Development of Grouse Mountain did not occur due to the high cost of development, rejection of the '76 Winter Olympic Games, vocal public opposition at the local and statewide levels, and a desire by Vail Resorts to fully develop Beaver Creek and Vail Mountain prior to expansion. The opportunity to provide developed alpine skiing on Grouse Mountain was eliminated from future consideration with the establishment of the Holy Cross Wilderness in 1980. Forest plans The 2002 Revision of the 1984 Land and Resource Management Plan Forest plans, White River National Forest, Chapter 3-Management Area Direction, 8.25 Ski areas - Existing and Potential, pages 3‚Äì80 through 3-8, and 8.31 Aerial Transportation Corridors, page 3-84, establishes long-term planning direction for Vail Ski Resort. Lift access from remote areas and new portals, including Minturn, were analyzed in the plan. The theme of an 8.31 aerial transportation corridor designation is to serve the principal purpose of transporting people to, from, and within communities, and ski areas. The theme of an 8.25 land allocation is to allow ski areas on federal lands to be developed and operated by the private sector to provide opportunities for intensively managed outdoor recreation activities during all seasons of the year. The 8.25 management area prescription includes existing developed ski areas and undeveloped expansion areas with potential for future development. Ski areas provide winter sports activities and other intensively managed outdoor recreation opportunities for large numbers of national and international visitors in highly developed settings. In some areas, use in the summer may be as intensive as in the winter. The White River National Forest forest plan addresses vegetation management, intensity of use, seasons of use, and motorized access. The 8.25 management area includes existing resorts that have already been permitted and developed, as well as additional suitable terrain into which development is planned for the future. The 1984 Forest Plan and 2002 revision were authored by Erik J. Martin, Program Manager for Ski Area Administration, to identify future expansion opportunities and alternative special-use permit boundaries for Vail ski area. The 1984 Land and Resource Management Plan [Forest plan] was revised in 2002,Land and Resource Management Plan - 2002 Revision and analyzed in a Final Environmental Impact Statement.Final Environmental Impact Summary A summary of the Final Environmental Impact Statement to accompany the Land and Resource Management Plan - 2002 Revision is available to the public at local Forest Service Offices, public library, or National Forest web site.

Nine teenaged youths, ages 15‚Äì17, and one 22-year-old were high on drugs and alcohol when they left a high school party in the suburb of The Woodlands and headed for Houston's heavily gay Montrose area in an attempt to gain admittance to dance clubs located in the vicinity. After being refused entry to several establishments, they pulled into a parking lot where they encountered Broussard and two friends, who were also intoxicated. They then attacked Broussard and his friends. Broussard was beaten and stabbed twice with a pocket knife belonging to 17-year-old Jon Buice. He died several hours later as a result of both internal injuries as well as what an expert medical examiner termed \\"a delay in treatment\\" (In the early days of the AIDS crisis, police and medical personnel were slow to respond to calls from the Montrose area for fear of AIDS contamination.) When Houston gay rights leader Ray Hill confronted police about solving the murder, he was told that they had no intention of doing so. Gay rights advocates, frustrated about being ignored and persecuted by city officials, marched through the streets and in front of the mayor's home for several days in what became Houston's largest and long-lasting gay rights demonstration in history. Ultimately, the boys ‚Äì labeled \\"The Woodlands Ten\\" ‚Äì were apprehended and plea bargained into prison without a trial for the murder of Broussard. The attack Paul Broussard was walking across a parking lot just after 2:00 a.m.,\\"Anatomy of a Gay Murder,\\" Chris Bull, 2001 on July 4, 1991, in heavily gay Montrose neighborhood of Houston, Texas, accompanied by his friends Cary Anderson and Richard Delaunay, when the trio encountered ten young men from The Woodlands: Jaime Aguirre, Javier Aguirre, Derrick Attard, Jon Buice, Chance Paul Dillon, Rafael Grable Gonzalez, Gayland Randle, Leandro Ramirez, Brian Spake, and Jeffrey Valentine. All but Dillon attended McCullough High School in The Woodlands. Broussard and friends were just blocks away from home when the boys asked them for directions. The boys then reportedly exited their vehicles and attacked the men with fists, steel-toed boots, bear claws and a small pocket knife wielded by Buice. While Anderson and Delaunay escaped down a busy street, Broussard was surrounded by the ten attackers. Broussard suffered abrasions, puncture wounds, a broken rib, bruised testicles, and two stab wounds. As he lay on the ground, almost unconscious, two of his attackers rifled through his pockets and took a comb as a souvenir. The ten young men then drove off up I-45 towards The Woodlands.\\"Ten Years Later,\\" OutSmart, John Aston, July 2001 When EMS staff finally arrived at the scene early on the morning of July 4, they found a wounded, but still conversant Broussard. As they prepared to transport him to Ben Taub Medical Center, the city's trauma hospital, Broussard requested to be taken to St. Joseph Medical Center as his hospital of choice. For unknown reasons, EMS staff determined that the severity of his wounds warranted low priority transport (no lights or sirens). As a consequence, what should have been an eight-minute trip took forty minutes. It was another hour before a doctor could be located who was willing to address Broussard's wounds. Broussard later died of internal injuries. His mother, Nancy Rodriguez, flew into Houston from Atlanta, Georgia, and met with Houston police as well as with Anderson and Delaunay. Protests Houston gay rights advocate Ray Hill went to the Houston police to find out the progress in the case. Once he learned that police had no intention of pursuing the murder, he met with television and newspaper outlets while helping to organize the largest gay rights protests in the city's history. Queer Nation Houston helped organize the large public protests, some of which took place in front of the mayor's house, with Rodriguez participating. The resulting media attention led to one of the assailants' girlfriends calling the police. Arrests and sentencing Attard went to New York after the attack, and was arrested there. Buice is reported to have turned himself in after being encouraged to do so by his father.\\"Activist urges parole for killer he helped convict,\\" Houston Chronicle, 2003 All ten were soon arrested and signed confessions without attorneys present. Hill lobbied the prosecutor and district attorney for \\"meaningful sentences\\" for the attackers, dubbed the \\"Woodlands Ten.\\" All ten of Broussard's assailants were eventually plea- bargained without the case going to trial. Attard received probation for agreeing to testify against the other nine. Four other boys received probation, and Rodriguez ‚Äì aided by the Houston Crime Victim's Office ‚Äì worked with the D.A. to set the terms. The court also ordered them to pay for Anderson's hospital bill and Broussard's funeral. Attard and Randle violated the terms of their probations and were sent to prison. Buice, who inflicted the stab wounds, received a 45-year sentence. Dillon received a 20-year sentence for attempted murder and aggravated attempted murder. The three remaining assailants received sentences of 15-years-and-one-day for their admitted participation in the beatings. Their sentences were criticized by Rodriguez and Queer Nation as being too light. Prison, parole and release Dillon was the first of the attackers to be released in March 2000, after serving just six years. He owed his freedom to a mandatory release law that was repealed in 1996.\\"TX Gay-Bash Killer Released,\\" Planet Out News, March 20, 2000 Attard, Gonzalez, Randle, Spake, and Valentine also received probation and were released. Buice, who received the longest sentence and is the last of the Woodlands Ten, was denied parole in October 2003, October 2005, and October 2007. He was granted parole in July 2011, however, which was revoked for reasons that were not disclosed to him and his family. Buice's parole was denied again on October 21, 2014. Buice was ultimately granted parole in November 2015 and released to the custody of his father on December 30 under strict and intensive supervision. Rodriguez currently lives near Macon, Georgia and has attended more than 20 parole hearings in her efforts to keep her son's assailants in prison.  The Guy With The Knife  In 2006, while visiting Houston to report on a story about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Canadian filmmaker Alison Armstrong heard about an \\"unusual friendship\\" between Hill and Buice. She learned that after meeting with Buice and others convicted of the murder, Hill became convinced that the Woodlands Ten were not homophobic or had been gay bashing on the night of Broussard's murder. Hill reported that he began to regret fabricating the false motive after meeting and corresponding with Buice and other members of the Woodlands Ten, and began encouraging Buice to pursue his education and worked toward helping Buice win release on parole. \\"I lied to get media attention to get Houston police to solve a gay murder. It was wrong, but it worked,\\" he told Armstrong. \\"Now I'm doing what I have to do on behalf of Jon Buice.\\" Armstrong became intrigued with not only the unusual friendship between the two men, but also the role the media had played in all aspects of the case. Ultimately, she came to believe that the larger issue of a criminal justice system that would plea bargain nine minors into the adult prison system without the case ever going to trial, should also be an element covered by the film. However, much more came to light as the project unfolded. Armstrong's film The Guy With The Knife, uncovered a pattern of delay in responding to the gay community in Montrose by Houston first responders. Houston gay rights activist Maria Gonzalez recounted unfortunate advice that was repeated in Montrose during those years: \\"If you get hurt in Montrose, get in your car and drive some place else ‚Äì and call 9-1-1.\\" In another scene, expert medical examiner Dr. Alan Taylor amends Broussard's cause of death to include \\"a delay in treatment.\\" Other revelations include questionable practices by the Texas penal system and an unusually closed parole process that may violate the civil rights of the accused by withholding key information. The documentary received numerous accolades from several LGBT film festivals. In early November 2015, the film was publicly screened at the LBJ School of Public Affairs in partnership with the University of Texas Law School, the Harvey Milk Society, The Center for Health and Social Policy, and The William Wayne Justice Center for Public Interest Law. It was followed by a panel discussion including Armstrong; Gonzalez; Texas Southern University journalism professor Michael Berryhill; and LBJ School criminal justice policy Professor Michele Deitch. Jon Buice In April 1999, Buice wrote an open letter to the gay community apologizing and seeking to make amends for his role in Broussard's murder, which was addressed to the radio station KPFT and printed in the Houston Voice.\\"Killer apologizes to Houston gays; Man who knifed banker to death in '91 repents in letter\\", Houston Chronicle, April 30, 1999 Buice said he was moved to write the letter after hearing about the murder of Matthew Shepard. In a subsequent interview with a researcher, Buice said that he was not homophobic and had close friends and relatives who were gay. Buice also said that the attack had less to do with Broussard's sexual orientation than with thrill-seeking, male-bonding, peer pressure, and the influence of drugs and alcohol. Some, including Buice, had also used marijuana and LSD. According to prison officials, Buice has a spotless prison record. He has earned associate's degrees in business and accounting and a bachelor's degree in psychology.\\"Parole denied for pair convicted in gay slaying,\\" ReporterNews.Com, October 2, 2003 Buice was denied his parole requests in 2007 and 2009. He was scheduled to be released on parole around October 2011,\\"Killer in 91 Montrose gay-bashing case to be paroled,\\" Houston Chronicle, July 5, 2011 but after protests from Broussard's mother as well as other gay activists, the Parole Board reversed its decision and denied Buice parole.\\"State reverses parole for killer of gay Houston banker√Ω,\\" Houston Chronicle, August 2, 2011 Buice's parole was reviewed in August 2012.\\"Advocates clash over gay-bashing murder case,\\" Houston Chronicle, August 29, 2012 He was denied again on October 21, 2014, but was ultimately granted and released on December 30, 2015 into the custody of his father, Jim Buice, under strict supervision. Buice's attempts at parole were supported by Hill, who is also an ex-convict and host of The Prison Show on KPFT.

The Office had two locations: one in Berlin and one in Munich. Legal basis Article 118 of the Weimar constitution forbade censorship outright, with the text \\"No censorship will take place.\\" On May 12, 1920, however, the Weimar government passed the \\"Lichtspielgesetz\\" (Cinema Act). This law established an ordinance to regulate the exhibition of visual media. The two largest film producers were based out of Berlin and Munich, respectively. As such, the Film Review Office was based out of these two cities. The Munich Office was given jurisdiction over the states of Bavaria, W√ºrttemberg, Baden, and Hessia. The Berlin Office was given jurisdiction over the rest of Germany. In addition, a supervisory headquarters (German: Oberpr√ºfstelle) was established in Berlin. Weimar years From 1920 to 1924, the supervisory headquarters was chaired by Dr. Carl Bulcke; in 1924 he was replaced by Ernst Seeger (who later served as Minister of Film in the Propagandaministerium under Joseph Goebbels). Each office had a chair appointed by the Minister of the Interior. That chair chose a panel out of leading figures from film, literature, the arts, education, and social welfare. The Film Review Office reviewed films along with their titles and advertising material. This included films which were released before the Cinema Act was passed if they were re-released in theaters. Foreign films due for release in Germany also needed to be submitted to the Film Review Office. Review was mandatory; refusal to submit a film carried a monetary fine. The process, however, was not public: reviews were held privately and results were returned directly to the film firms. Censorship by the Film Review Office served as a security consideration. The only grounds on which a film could be censored were in perceived cases of danger to the interests of the state or in threats to public order and security. Films determined unobjectionable were then submitted to the Parliament (German: Reichsrat) for review of artistic aspects by the Central Institute for Education and Instruction. Nazi years The Second Cinema Act was passed on 16 February 1934. This entailed several changes to the Film Review Office, centralizing the censorship of film. The office in Munich was closed; thereafter all film was censored by the Berlin office. The Propagandaministerium took over the job of overseeing the office. With the new system came new principles; the line between censorship for security and aesthetic censorship disappeared and the Film Review Office began censoring on artistic grounds. The F√ºhrerprinzip became the guiding principle of the headquarters. The council was reduced to a purely advisory function and the chair, under supervision of the Propagandaminister, had the final word on all films. See also * Censorship in Germany Resources .

The novel was first released by Ace Books in the United States as a Hardcover edition on October 5, 2004, followed by a Paperback edition on June 26, 2005. Orbit Books released a paperback edition in the United Kingdom in December 2009. It tells the story of a young boy named Tavi who is the only one without any fury crafting abilities. The novel was well received, with critics praising Butcher's turn at a more traditional fantasy setting, fast pacing, action, and his characterization of the antagonists. Plot The story takes place in the Aleran Empire, which contains \\"crafters\\", people who can control the elements: water, air, earth, fire, wood, and metal, through a person's bond with an element's fury. A young woman named Amara travels with her mentor Fidelias as part of her graduation exercise. Amara is training to become one of the Cursori, messengers and spies for the First Lord of Alera, Gaius Sextus. They infiltrate a camp of mercenaries, when Amara is tricked by a watercrafter named Odiana and betrayed by Fidelias. Odiana is the lover of Aldrick ex Gladius, the greatest swordsman since Araris Valerian, a legendary swordsman who had been in the service of the Princeps of Alera, the First Lord's late son. Amara escapes and makes contact with First Lord Gaius using her aircraft. He instructs her to go to the city of Garrison. The story switches to a steadholt controlled by Bernard, a man who lost his wife and children and stays with his sister Isana, and their nephew Tavi who is furyless. Tavi finds that one of his sheep has gone missing. He and Bernard track the sheep when they are attacked by a Marat warrior. The Marat and the Alerans had fought a war before Tavi was born in which the Marat killed Gaius' son, Princeps Septimus. The Marat are a warrior people who form tribes based on bonds with different animals, for example horses. In the fight, Tavi and Bernard kill the warrior's war bird but not before Bernard is wounded. Tavi is running for help when a furystorm hits. While seeking shelter, he finds Amara and the two find the Princeps Memorial, a cave dedicated to Princeps Septimus. Bernard makes it back to his steadholt, where Isana uses her watercrafting skills to heal him. Bernard then finds Tavi and Amara and bring them back to the steadholt. Fidelias, Odiana, and Aldrick stay at the steadholt where they discover Amara and attempt to capture her. Amara and Tavi escape with Fade, a slave of the steadholt who is mentally challenged, and together they travel through the woods before Amara splits from the other two. Tavi and Fade are attacked by Kord, the leader of Kordholt and a slaver. During the fight, Bernard and Amara attack Kord when Fidelias, Odiana, and Aldrick attack. Aldrick kills Kord's son Bittan and after arriving, Isana floods the river. Bernard and Amara go one way; Tavi and Fade a second, and Fidelias and Aldrick another; Isana, Odiana, Kord, and Kord's oldest son Aric are washed to Kordholt. Tavi and Fade are captured by a Marat Headman named Doroga. Odiana and Isana, captured by Kord, are locked away and Odiana is raped. Bernard and Amara continue to Garrison where they rouse the Legionares. Fidelias and Aldrick go to the Marat leader Atsurak, who decides to invade Garrison immediately. Tavi convinces Doroga to let him undergo a trial that can stop the attack on Garrison. Tavi faces the trial with Kitai, Doroga's daughter, and wins, saving Kitai's life in the process, and undergoing some sort of bond with her which changes the colour of her eyes to match his, although he does not understand the meaning of this change. Isana and Odiana convince Aric to help them escape Kordholt, and they split up and head to Garrison. Tavi and the Marat head to Garrison to stop Atsurak. Bernard and Amara hold off the Marat, while realising their feelings for one another, and Isana arrives and hides. Tavi and Doroga attack and kill Atsurak, and Tavi reunites with Bernard and Isana. They are attacked by Fidelias and Aldrick, who defeat Bernard and Amara with ease. Fade then attacks Aldrick, defeats him, and leaves him alive. It is hinted here that Fade is Araris Valerian. Fidelias throws Fade off the wall, attacks Tavi, and takes Aquitaine's dagger. Garrison survived the attack and Tavi is granted a scholarship to the Academy by the First Lord. Bernard and Amara become Count and Countess of the garrison, and Isana is given the title of Steadholder, making her the first woman ever to own a steadholt and gain citizenship through merit rather than marriage. Fidelias and Aldrick return to Aquitaine, greeted by Invidia, Aquitaine's wife and discover Aquitaine sleeping with Gaius' wife Caria. Characters See also Codex Alera characters * Tavi : He is a main protagonist, who is orphaned and raised by his Uncle Bernard and Aunt Isana. He has no abilities to craft \\"furies\\". Butcher mentioned in a Reddit AMA that he'd written Tavi to be the polar opposite of his popular character Harry Dresden from the Dresden Files. * Fidelias : A traitor to the crown. * Gaius Sextus : First Lord of Alera, and the strongest Fury crafter. Butcher revealed that the character had been influenced by \\"a slew of reasonably good Roman Emperors and Erwin Rommel\\". * Bernard : Steadholder of Bernardholt, and former legionnaire.

Publication history Hardcover and paperback The novel was first released by Ace Books in the United States as a Hardcover edition on October 5, 2004, though a Hardcover Bargain Price Edition was already available on October 1, 2004. An author signed paperback edition was also published on January 1, 2005. It was followed by a Paperback edition on June 26, 2005. A Paperback edition with an updated cover art was published in the United Kingdom by Orbit Books in December 2009. Audiobook An unabridged audiobook edition of the novel was released by Penguin Audio on November 26, 2008. It was followed by the release of an audio CD on December 1, 2008. On August 25, 2016, an unabridged audiobook was published by Hachette Audio UK, which was narrated by Kate Reading. Ebook An Ebook version published by Ace Books was available via Amazon Digital Services LLC on the initial release date. It peaked at number 16 on Amazon Books' Greek & Roman category, and at 19 on the Kindle Store's category of the same name. On May 28, 2009, another version was published by Orbit Books, also available via Amazon Digital Services LLC. Reception Furies of Calderon was well received by critics. Writing for The Independent (St. George, Utah), Rich Rogers awarded the novel 5 out 5 stars, calling it a great epic fantasy that stands on its own without borrowing from the usual fantasy tropes. He lauded Jim Butcher's successful turn at the fantasy genre in a more traditional setting, and praised the complex characterization of the antagonists. Reviewing the Audiobook, Gil T. Wilson of the SF Site praised the novel and the series, noting that if the first book was any indication, Codex Alera would prove to be a great fantasy series. She concluded by advising readers to be prepared for a fun read that would have them running through an emotional gamut. David Stoit of Fantasy Book Review criticized Butcher for the style of the book, calling it \\"na√Øve\\", but noted that Butcher had found a \\"stranger yet satisfying balance\\" between the characters. He concluded by saying that the novel was a good start to an interesting series. Notes and references External links * First two chapters.

It is one of five species in the genus Cactoblastis that inhabit South America, where many parasitoids and pathogens control the expansion of the moths' population. This species has been introduced into many areas outside its natural range, including Australia, the Caribbean, and South Africa. In some locations, it has spread uncontrollably and was consequently classified an invasive species.Zimmermann, H., Bloem, S., Klei, H., \\"Biology, History, Threat, Surveillance and Control of the Cactus Moth, Cactoblastis cactorum\\", April 10, 2004. However, in other places such as Australia, it has gained favor for its role in the biological control of cacti from the genus Opuntia, such as prickly pear. Interactions in native habitat In South America, Cactoblastis cactorum has many natural predators, including ants and New World monkeys. Ants, the moths' main predators, consume its larvae. New World monkeys dig the larvae and pupae out from the flattened leaf-like stems, or \\"cladodes\\", of the cacti. The relationship between Cactoblastis cactorum and Opuntia cactus species is parasitic: the moth feeds on the host cactus. Recent work in South America has identified four genetically-structured ecotypes of C. cactorum that infest different hosts and possess different larval morphology. The mechanism driving this isolation and pattern of host- association in the field remains unexplored. Anatomy Adults of Cactoblastis cactorum are nondescript brownish-gray moths with long legs and long antennae. The moth can be identified only by a microscopic examination of dissected male genitalia. They generally appear as typical Pyralidae, with the pronounced labial palps of the female, thus the name \\"snout moths\\". The forewings show a characteristic banding pattern similar to other related moths. The hindwings are whitish and semitransparent, and the wingspan of adult moths varies by age and sex. The average wingspan is 27‚Äì40 mm for females, and 23‚Äì32 mm for males.Materson, J., \\"Cactoblastis cactorum. Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce\\", March 10, 2007. The larvae of C. cactorum are caterpillars that start out with a pink-cream color and gradually become orange, with distinctive black spots or bands. Reproduction and lifespan Cactoblastis cactorum mating occurs before sunrise. Mates are found by scent rather than sight.Everlyn, K. (2011). \\"How Does a moth reproduce? \\" Once a female finds a mate, she begins to release sex pheromones that signal to males her readiness. When the male responds, the mating process is initiated. The initial process of mating begins when the female and male attach themselves at their abdomens. The male passes a sac, known as the \\"spermatophore\\", and the female stores the sac in her abdomen's reproductive center. After an incubation period, the female deposits an \\"egg stick\\" that contains 30‚Äì50 eggs. The eggs are laid on either the tip of the cactus spine, the cactus leaf, the cladode, or the cactus fruit. Egg sticks that resemble cactus spines develop and hatch in 25‚Äì30 days. The gregarious larvae bore into the cactus pad through a single entry hole by chewing through the tough outer cuticle of the cladode. The external damage that results is characterized by yellowed plant tissue with plant fluid ooze and insect frass. The larvae feed inside the cactus and eventually hollow out the cactus pad, consuming everything but the vascular tissues. Larvae will typically spend two months within the host cactus during the summer, and approximately four months during the winter. Mature larvae exit the cactus pad to form cocoons. They pupate under debris on the ground at the base of the plant. As soon as the moths emerge, they search for a mate, and usually reproduce three to four times within their lifetime. The average longevity is nine days for females and eleven days for males. During this time, the female moth does not eat; she uses all of her energy to travel up to in search of dense cactus patches for reproduction. The male moth devotes his energy to maximizing his mating opportunities. Males mate between two and five times, and wait two to three days on average between mating events. Effects and status As a biological control agent An Opuntia infested area in Australia, before Cactoblastis was introduced Cactoblastis cactorum was first introduced to Australia in 1925 from Argentina, where it was successfully used as a biological control agent for Opuntia cacti.Capinera, John L., Encyclopedia of Entomology, Springer, April 10, 2008. Due to this success, it was subsequently introduced into other countries, including South Africa in 1933 and the Caribbean in the 1950s. Following introduction, Cactoblastis exerted an immediate effect on the agricultural community in South Africa, where it diminished the population of the spineless Opuntia species valued as \\"cattle fodder\\".Annecke DP, Burger WA, Coetzee H. \\"Pest status of Cactoblastis cactorum (Berg) (Lepidoptera: Phycitidae) and Dactylopius opuntiae (Cockerell) (Coccoidea: Dactylopiidae) in spineless Opuntia plantations in South Africa\\", Journal of the Entomological Society of South Africa, April 15, 1976. In 1956, the moth was introduced to the Caribbean island of Nevis and successfully controlled a complex of native \\"prickly pear\\" cacti. In 1960 Cactoblastis was introduced into Montserrat and Antigua as a successful biological control agent. Spread Following its introduction into the Caribbean, Cactoblastis cactorum was able to spread across the Atlantic Ocean and throughout the Caribbean through an unknown mix of natural dispersal, intentional and unintentional human transport, and importation on infested livestock fodder. It has been spotted in Saint Kitts, the US Virgin Islands, Haiti, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico and Barbados. It eventually reached the Southeastern United States and was first detected in Florida in 1989. Cactoblastis cactorum likely entered Florida through importation of Opuntia from the Dominican Republic. Cactoblastis is currently moving along both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts at a rate of 100 miles per year, with a constant increase in the rate of colonization along the Gulf Coast. As it spreads, it threatens the population of Opuntia cacti in Florida, in the Atlantic coast up to Charleston, South Carolina, and around the Gulf Coast up to New Orleans. Cactoblastis distribution in the United States: As the moth moves through the Southeastern United States, it endangers many cactus species and threatens many ecosystems. In Florida, the greatest concern is for the endangered semaphore cactus Opuntia leucotricha.Stiling, P., \\"A Worm That Turned\\", Natural History, 109(5), 40-43, March 5, 2000. Current studies aim to identify the most efficient way to prevent the invasion of Cactoblastis cactorum in the semaphore cactus population. In addition to the semaphore cactus, the arrival of Cactoblastis cactorum to the United States caused concern for the ornamental cactus industry in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas. Arizona has the largest economic stake in Cactoblastis; the retail value of its cactus industry is around $9.5 million. Cactoblastis cactorum has spread across the Gulf to Mexico, where it was first discovered on Isla Mujeres, a small island off the northeast coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. It is unknown how the moth migrated to Mexico; speculated means of propagation include winds and hurricanes, unintentional transport by humans, or commercial trade. More recently, Cactoblastis cactorum began to attack Opuntia cacti on San Salvador Island in the Bahamas, where Opuntia cacti, especially the prickly pear cactus, are a major food source for the Cyclura iguanas. The decrease in Opuntia cacti population raises concern of severe damage to the iguana population. Projected spread Researchers are projecting a westward expansion of Cactoblastis cactorum in North America. This threatens cactus industries in the Southwestern United States and inner parts of Mexico. In the Western United States, over sixty Opuntia species are a vital part of the ecosystem. In Mexico, Opuntia is a vital plant; its fruit and clacode (nopal) are a staple food, chopped cacti are used to sustain cattle in times of drought, and some Opuntia species support the cochineal dye industry.Robyn, R., W., Shaharra U., \\"Cactus Moth, Cactoblastis cactorum\\", 2011 Survey Plan for PPQ and State Cooperators, March 5, 2011. Loss of these cacti would have a major environmental and economical impact on the country. Estimated stress factors in the moths' native community indicate that it is restricted to temperate climates, due to the incubation period of its larvae, but host associations may also play an important role in determining spread. Models based on environmental tolerances predict that its eventual range limits in the United States are bound by Charleston, South Carolina, to the north and by California to the west. However, the eventual extent of the western spread remains unclear because we know little about biotic interactions that will occur in this region. Ecological interactions and mechanisms Host selection The ecological relationship between the Cactoblastis cactorum moth and the Opuntia cactus is a parasite‚Äìhost relationship. Cactoblastis larvae feeding on Opuntia cacti Laboratory feeding studies suggest that Cactoblastis cactorum is one of the least selective moths in the genus Cactoblastis when it comes to host selection, but the observed patterns of infestation in the field suggest that host identity is important in determining which sites become infested. The moth selects its host by detecting CAM production in Opuntia cacti. They have a detection system that enables them to detect the carbon and nitrogen gradients in the air surrounding the host. The females have a superior detection system to that of the males because they use this to determine where to implant the larvae, which then destroy the cactus. Competition There have been no formal studies of competition between C. cactorum and other cactophagous species to date. This is an area of great potential interest in the Southwestern United States and Mexico because we know little about how of the diversity of cactophagous insects that are found in the region might influence the spread of C. cactorum. Predation Another factor that allows the moth to spread so easily in the United States is lack of predation. In South America, several parasitoid species as well as many diseases help to control the spread of the moth and its larvae. The parasitoids and diseases seem to be enough to control the spread of Cactoblastis cactorum. These parasitoids and diseases are not present in the areas where the moth has become a problem. This may be allowing the moth to spread more rapidly than normal. It has yet to be determined if these organisms that limit the growth of the Cactoblastis are host-specific enough to be introduced into affected areas as a method of biological control of the moth itself. Life history strategy Adult female moth in the process of laying an egg stick on a cladode. Cactoblastis cactorum shows both r-selected and k-selected life history traits. Although the moth reproduces more than once in its lifetime (a more k-selected trait), it produces a large number of eggs at one time (a more r-selected trait). A female moth can lay up to 50 eggs per generation, and produce at least three generations. Multiple generations are a sign of iteroparous reproduction. However, large amounts of offspring during a single generation time is a trait of semelparous reproduction. In this particular case, the moth also has high adult mortality rates which tend to push organisms towards semelparous reproduction. Also, these generations occur over a short period of time, considering that an adult moth only lives for about nine days. There are many different combinations and gradients between semelparity and iteroparity. However, it is clear in this case that the moth is closer to the semelparous side of the scale. Semelparity is an r-selected trait, whereas iteroparity is a k-selected trait. Other r-selected traits that the moth exhibits besides large breeds of offspring and short life span are: a small body structure, low adult investment in rearing offspring, and high dispersal ability. This shows that the moth is much more r-selected than it is k-selected. Most invasive species tend to be r-selected individuals because of their high growth rate and dispersal ability.Davis, Heather G., \\"r-Selected Traits in an Invasive Population\\", \\"Evolutionary Ecology 19.3 255-274\\", April 14 Control options Many attempts are being made to halt the expansion of Cactoblastis cactorum in order to prevent further damage to Opuntia cacti across Central America and the Southeast United States, where the effect of the moth has been identified as the most dangerous to the native flora. Some attempts to control the population are biological in nature whereas others are more physical attempts to quarantine afflicted Opuntia. Bacterial control One option currently being explored is a bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, which would kill middle-aged larvae of Cactoblastis cactorum. The bacterium was discovered by a group of scientists working in a colonization facility in Tifton, Georgia, who were attempting to rear large colonies of the moth. In their efforts to produce a sterile variety of the moth to eradicate it from its introduced habitat, a unique strain of bacterium was discovered. A particularly virulent variety of the bacterium was cultured that killed 100% of developing Cactoblastis cactorum larvae. This bacterium, when raised with the developing moth larvae, caused 100% mortality due to a combination of excreted exotoxins. The primary lethal exotoxin found in the guts of Cactoblastis cactorum after being exposed to Bacillus thuringiensis is referred to commonly as BtCc. It is being explored as short- term pest suppression because the bacterium is currently unable to be transferred from generation to generation in the gut of the moth. BtCc disrupts the digestive process of the larvae and causes near immediate larvae death. In order for this to be a long-term solution to control the spread of Cactoblastis cactorum, the bacterium or exotoxin would have to be able to reproduce and sporulate within the moth for its effects to spread in the population. Wasp predator control Some researchers are also looking at using a parasitic wasp to curb the spread of Cactoblastis cactorum in the United States. These wasps, native to South America, lay their eggs in Cactoblastis larvae and eat the larvae from the inside out. Current concerns are that the wasp itself could become an invasive species, parasitizing native caterpillars and other native insect larvae. Ant interaction control Another possible control option being explored would utilize ants to serve in a mutually beneficial relationship with the Opuntia cacti. Many ant species in the natural world participate in mutualistic relationships with various species of cactus and it is hoped that this general trend of interaction can be exploited to protect the Opuntia cacti from the Cactoblastis moth. This relationship would offer Opuntia protection from the invader, Cactoblastis, and would offer the ants a place to rear their young and receive nourishment.Robbins, M et all., \\"Patterns of Ant Activity on Opuntia Stricta (cactaceae), a Native Host-plant of the Invasive Cactus Moth, Cactoblastis Cactorum (lepidoptera: Pyralidae)\\", ‚Äò‚ÄôFlorida Entomologist‚Äô‚Äô, 2011 In South Africa, a mutualism already exists between many species of cacti and ants to prevent the spread of Cactoblastis. Many cactus species throughout the world excrete an extrafloral nectar (ENF) that initially attracts the ants. The ants then feed on this nectar and attack anything that disturbs the cacti. Researchers at Rice University in Houston and the Florida A&M; University are collaborating in their research to explore such a beneficial relationship that could be reproduced in the United States. Initial lab experiments showed that the presence of ants living together with the cacti increased the mortality of Cactoblastis eggs laid on the cacti. Quarantine in the United States Currently in the United States, populations of Cactoblastis cactorum have been discovered in Florida, Georgia, and most recently, in Louisiana. Many of these states have already begun their own programs to halt the progress of the moth in conjunction with the 2009 Strategic Plan. The United States began a plan in 2009 through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to quarantine afflicted Opuntia species and slow the migration of Cactoblastis cactorum across the United States. The APHIS hopes to create a permanent barrier across which colonization of the invasive moth would be impossible. This barrier includes not only colonization of new areas across land, but also by sea. By sea, new regulations by APHIS require livestock fodder in transit found with evidence of Cactoblastis cactorum to be destroyed, fumigated, or returned to its country of origin. By land, quarantining means creating a barrier of area over which the moth will be unable to reproduce across the gap; this has been accomplished by physically removing all cacti in swaths of area or by removing and replacing afflicted cacti. One of the primary implementations proposed would be to create a sterile version of Cactoblastis cactorum that would serve to eliminate the westernmost population of the moth and push its current territory eastward. This method would create a generation of moths which is unable to reproduce and would slowly but effectively curb the spread of the species. However, the sterile version of the moth has had little success in spreading to the majority of the affected area. Other methods include identifying infected areas and then mechanically destroying all cacti in that area. Crude methods such as these are being used in Louisiana to eliminate the presence of the moth in swampy areas and generally involve the heavy use of removal by chainsaw, hacksaw, or other mechanical chopping device. Chemical pesticides in most areas have proven to be ineffective due to the large quantity and frequency of treatment of pesticide needed to limit the population and also the effective protection the moth is allotted by the cactus leaves. Uncertainties There is still much to be learned about Cactoblastis cactorum. Its native habitat of South America remains a mostly-unexplored area of scientific research. The moths' interactions with other species are not well understood. Although it is well known that the moth is capable of switching hosts, the full range of host plants susceptible to the moth is unknown. How the moth will affect agriculture in North America will be seen in the next few years, and the effectiveness of many of the control tactics may be seen in even less time. Lastly, a big unknown in the study of Cactoblastis cactorum is how various Opuntia species may develop defenses in response to its invasion. More studies need to be done both to understand the biological mechanisms of the moth and to halt its spread as an invasive species.  Monuments and memorials  Monument to the Cactoblastis cactorum moth in Queensland, Australia Dalby in Queensland, Australia, has a monument commemorating eradication of Opuntia by the moth in a park by Myall Creek, which runs through the town. The Cactoblastis Memorial Hall is located east of Chinchilla, and purports to be \\"the only building dedicated to an insect.\\" It was erected in 1936, and was one of the first insect memorials ever built, following the 1919 Boll Weevil Monument in Alabama.Patterson, Ewen K. 1936.

The auditorium's name commemorates Raleigh citizens who died serving their country during World War I. Situated downtown at the southern end of Fayetteville Street, the Greek Revival structure is an architectural complement to the North Carolina State Capitol located a few blocks away at the northern terminus of the street. The removal of the obstructive original Raleigh Convention Center in 2005 (now replaced with a building on an adjacent site) restored the historic vista along Fayetteville Street between Memorial Auditorium and the Capitol. Following minor improvements in 1963 and 1977, the auditorium was renovated extensively in 1990, with the notable addition of an external modern glass concourse and lobby. The venue seats 2,277 and most often hosts large musical theater productions.  Meymandi Concert Hall  Meymandi Concert Hall seats 1,700 in a shoebox configuration. It is the home of the North Carolina Symphony, which previously held its concerts in Memorial Auditorium. Named for the mother of Raleigh physician and philanthropist Dr. Assad Meymandi, the facility has excellent acoustics.

Rallies can be large or small, and one-time or recurring. Some rallies are ride-in events, whereas some like the Iron Butt Rally involve days of riding and an actual gathering only at the end of the ride. North America Street lined with motorcycles at a motorcycle rally in Marietta, Ohio. Notable annual North American rallies with attendance in the hundreds of thousands from all over the continent include the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, Laconia Motorcycle Week, Black Bike Week and Daytona Beach Bike Week. The Republic of Texas Biker Rally is held each June in Austin, Texas and attracts over 200,000 bikers to the state capitol. There are innumerable smaller, regional rallies around the United States, including the annual BMW MOA international rally, the Oyster Run in the Pacific Northwest, the Golden Aspen Rally (formerly Aspencade) in the Southwest, the Laughlin River Run in the West, Americade in the Northeast, and Motorcycles on Meridian in the Midwest. A popular rally in the East takes place in the mountains of Maryland, Apple's East Coast Motorcycle Rally (formerly East Coast Sturgis). Rallies will often incorporate entertainment such as a burnout pit, motorcycle contests, bike washes, motorcycle stunt performances like wheelie acts and the wall of death, live bands, and dice runs or poker runs. The Indianapolis and Daytona Beach motorcycle rallies have championship motorcycle racing at nearby circuits. In some cases, rallies are held as benefits for organizations or groups such as the American Red Cross, American Cancer Society, American Legion or VFW. Europe The longest established motorcycle rally in Europe is the Elefantentreffen (Elephant Rally), established in 1956 by former Wehrmacht motorcyclists and named in honour of the Z√ºndapp motorcycle that was nicknamed the \\"green elephant.\\" The growing reputation of the Elephant Rally led to the creation in 1962 of a British winter rally, the Dragon rally, held each February in North Wales. One of the largest motorcycle rallies in Europe is the Thundersprint, held annually in May in Northwich, Cheshire, England and usually has notable motorcycle champions or enthusiasts such as Giacomo Agostini and James May. Another large motorcycle rally is Glemseck 101. It takes place around the Glemseck at the Solitude race track in Leonberg, Germany every first weekend in September. A special attraction are the 1/8 mile drag races, where customizers and motorcycle brands send their best bikes and bikers to the race (e.g. Triumph, BMW, Yamaha, Suzuki).http://www.triumphmotorcycles.at/news-and- events/events/germany/2016/september/glemseck%20101https://news.suzuki.de/essenza- sprint-glemseck-am-3-9-2016-vorstellung-sv650-little-bastard/ In the UK, the Iron Ore Rally is held annually in Egremont Cumbria and the Rally of Discovery is held in Ireland. Rallies are held all year round. Many motorcyclists (or bikers) prefer the winter rallies, such as the Mayflower MCCs Force Ten Rally or the Dean Vally MCCs Rallymans Rally. The usual order of the day is camping with a real ale tent and music. Rallies usually start on a Friday afternoon and finish at lunchtime on a Sunday. The point is to travel there by motorcycle, motorcycle and sidecar or trike (not cars or vans), meet friends from all over the country and sometimes further afield, claim a rally badge and enjoy the entertainment. Prizes are awarded for the furthest distance travelled, best bike, best rat bike, oldest person attending, youngest person attending, etc. There are usually planned ride-outs on the Saturday taking in good roads and sometimes historic sites, museums, etc. In the UK many people relate motorcycle rallies to the famous Bulldog Bash near Stratford-upon-Avon. This is a hugely popular event and attracts thousands of people including non- motorcyclists. There are many much smaller rallies that attract between 50 and 500 bikers to each event, organised and controlled by a host club. Rallies are still attended by motorcyclists that have been going to rallies for up to 40 or 50 years. In the UK motorcycle rallies began in earnest in the early 1960s as young, mainly working class men and women (usually on the pillion) gained freedom by motorcycle ownership and set off around the country camping. Some went in groups or clubs and thus the rally was born. Many were Ton-up boys, later Greasers and then Greebos. Gypsy tour Gypsy tour is an American motorcycling term which originated before the 1920s; the term has been mostly but not entirely replaced by rally or run. Gypsy tours were organized where groups of riders all over the country converged on a favorite destination. The term gypsy was used because the riders would travel long distances and often sleeping in tents around a campfire along the way much like the Hollywood stereotype The Romani. One Australian newspaper referring to a Gypsy Tour rally from Melbourne to Sydney in 1927, stated - \\"The idea of a \\"gypsy tour\\" originated in America. There these tours are usually being organised simultaneously in different cities and towns, and routes all converging on one centre, where a great rally is held by the touring parties\\". The term gypsy tour has been used for other activities, but predominantly motorcycle rallies, and the idea quickly spread around the world. Many gypsy tours have been held over the years and are still a regular event for many vintage and modern motorcycle groups. The annual gypsy tour to Laconia, New Hampshire near Lake Winnipesaukee began in 1916 and is the oldest continuous motorcycle event in the U.S. Australia A number of rallies are held throughout Australia, at all times of the year. These range from 'back to basics' rallies, usually held in remote locations with no facilities, to catered rallies held in country towns and other rural locations. Many rallies are held at a local recreation reserve, football ground, racecourse or showground in country towns. These venues often have toilet/shower blocks, and bar/kitchen facilities. Often the motorcycle club organising the rally will arrange for a local service group like the Rotary club, or local sporting club to cater an evening meal and breakfast, and to run the bar. These events often provide much needed revenue sources for the communities in which the rallies are held, and the communities welcome the rallies to their towns. Compared to European and American rallies, Australian rallies are often small affairs, with attendance ranging from a few dozen to a few hundred bikes. The Ulysses Club Annual General Meeting Event is a weeklong affair that brings in thousands of motorcyclists and millions of dollars to its host site, which can be different each year. The 2014 event in Alice Springs is expected to draw 5,000 to 7,000 participants. New Zealand There are number of rallies held throughout New Zealand, most events taking place over the warmer months. There are a couple of cold weather rallies such as the Brass Monkey Motorcycle Rally.

Eventually, he would have the honor of becoming a Significant Sig. Shaffer graduated from DePauw with a degree in social science in 1936. After graduating, Shaffer moved to New York City and became the assistant to the director of personnel Boy Scouts of America.Kirby, op. cit. p. 166 Shaffer received his master's degree from Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1940. He then enrolled in the doctoral program at New York University, from which he received the Ph.D. degree in 1945. He met Marjorie Jane Fitch at the International House in New York City and they married in 1940. In 1941 Shaffer took his first student affairs position as an assistant to the Dean of the School of Business at Indiana University. Shaffer's academic career was interrupted with service in the US Army from 1943 to 1945. After basic and specialized training, he served in a Replacement Depot in Hawaii as a classification specialist. From there he was returned to the US for Officer Training School and was assigned to labor relations work at the Boston Port of Embarkation. Upon returning to Indiana University in 1945, Shaffer was named Assistant Dean of Students and Director of the Veteran's Guidance Center.  Career  Early on at Indiana, Shaffer had a wide variety of experiences. He worked with students in regards to health, housing, financial aid and academic issues.Kirby, op. cit. p. 162 Shaffer worked with several associations of professional student affairs workers. In 1948 Shaffer was elected secretary of the American College Personnel Association (ACPA). In 1951 Shaffer was elected the first president of the newly formed American Personnel and Guidance Association (APGA), the forerunner of the present American Counseling Association. Shaffer worked as dean of students at Indiana from 1955 until 1969. Shaffer proposed a successful student affairs research office as well as a faculty associate program at Indiana University. The faculty associate program is a way to encourage faculty involvement with resident student life. Shaffer spent much of his personal time working with international students. His commitment to issues related to international students lead him to work in Thailand, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. His numerous publications are landmarks in the field of student affairs, and throughout his career he has been a consultant to national educational and government organizations. In 1956 Shaffer organized the student affairs division by function rather than by gender. This controversial approach allowed for the founding of various departments, such as residence life, orientation, financial aid, counseling, career placement and student health.Kirby, op. cit. p. 165 Through the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Movement, and the student protests surrounding these and many other issues, Shaffer engaged student concerns in ways that earned him the respect of both students and faculty. In recognition of his work he received honorary doctorate degrees from both DePauw and Indiana University. Another innovation by Shaffer was his creation of an extern program for student affairs graduate students. Students gain practical experience and gave them access to an environment to apply what was being learned in the classroom. Shaffer went on to serve as an editor of the NASPA Journal in the late 1960s. After leaving his administrative post in 1969, Shaffer became chairman of the Department of College Student Personnel Administration. He would retire from that post in 1981. His first wife having died in 1987, Shaffer remarried in 1989 and lived with his second wife, Joye Coy Shaffer in New Smyrna Beach, Florida until his death. He turned 100 in September 2015 and died on April 21, 2017 at the age of 101. References Bibliography *Kirby, A. F.,& Woodard, D. . Career Perspectives in Student Affairs.

An at risk population is defined as one that has no immunity to the attacking pathogen which can be either a novel pathogen or an established pathogen.

Distressing (or weathered look) in the decorative arts is the activity of making a piece of furniture or object appear aged and older, giving it a \\"weathered look\\", and there are many methods to produce an appearance of age and wear.Log Home Design Jan 2003 - Page 162 \\"Some homeowners use stain and distressing techniques to give their log walls a weathered look and feel.\\" Distressing is viewed as a refinishing technique although it is the opposite of finishing in a traditional sense. In distressing, the object's finish is intentionally destroyed or manipulated to look less than perfect, such as with sandpaper or paint stripper. For example, the artisan often removes some but not all of the paint, leaving proof of several layers of paint speckled over wood grain underneath. This becomes the \\"finished\\" piece. Distressing has become a popular design style and decorative art form. The artisan attempts a rustic, attractive, one-of-a-kind appearance or vintage look. The final appearance is often called the patina. Distressing can be applied to a variety of surfaces and materials such as wood, glass, metal, plastic, stone, concrete, plaster, and paint. Solid pine furniture in particular is one of the most ideal furniture types to apply distressing to.Distressed Furniture The Shabby chic style has made both distressing and antiquing popular. The technique is sometimes applied to electric guitars, where it is referred to as relicing. Antiquing Florentine-style woodwork, with gold paint applied to carved details to resemble gold gilding. Antiquing is a more involved form of distressing where the artisan intends to not only age a piece, but also create an antique appearance. In addition to distressing the finish, the artisan may reapply historical paint colors, antique-like faux finish and crackle varnishes. They might also apply period accent details, such as antique knobs on dresser drawers. Several methods involve glazes in which colors blend into crevices to give an antique appearance. The antiquing process is time-consuming and normally requires many steps to obtain the appearance of an aged and worn finish. In the mass- produced furniture market, it is common for 'distressing' to include faux woodworm holes. These can easily be distinguished from real woodworm holes (as might be present on a genuine antique) as faux woodworm holes will usually be all of identical diameter and vertical into the wood. Genuine woodworm holes, on the other hand, would be of varying diameter and usually not perfectly vertical. Techniques The artisan may deliberately sand, dent, and scrape the finish off of furniture or object. Wood can be hammered softer, or dimpled, bleached, pickled, stained or repainted with crackling paints and varnishes. Antiquing paints and varnishes are available at craft stores or can be mixed at home. New layers of paint can be watered down before they are applied to allow the wood and other layers to show through or to look more like white washing. Layers of paint of varnishes can be sponged on to create an uneven pattern. After any new paint or layers are applied, the corners and features can be painted slightly lighter or sanded down as desired to appear worn. Steel wool can be treated with vinegar to create an acid oxide, then brushed across a stripped and sanded surface of the piece to create a vintage stain effect. In addition, the following antiquing techniques can be used: *Decoupage *Gold leaf and Gilding *Graining and combing *Texturizing *Trompe l'oeil *Liver of sulfur *Verdigris *Wood stain *Chalk distressing See also * Aging (artwork) * Applied patina * Faux painting * List of art techniques * Refinishing * Shabby chic * Stone wash * Wood finishing  References   External links  * Home and Garden Television (HGTV) - Antiquing/Distressing Article Collection * Giving artwork a weathered look Macworld.com Category:Carpentry Category:Decorative arts Category:Surface decorative techniques in woodworking Category:Artistic techniques ","title":"Distressing"},{"id":"7157370","text":"The Italian order of battle for the Second Italo-Ethiopian War on 8 October 1935.

Early life Born in Hamburg, she was the eldest daughter of poet Rosa Maria Varnhagen, raised as a Lutheran, and David Assur, a Jewish physician, who converted to Christianity upon marriage and changed his name to Assing. He became prominent in his field.\\"LOVE ACROSS COLOR LINES.\\" Diedrich, Maria. HILL and WANG: 1999. Accessed January 11, 2017. Her mother was friendly with other literary women, including Clara Mundt and Fanny Lewald, and prominent in liberal circles that supported (but failed to achieve) social revolution in 1848. Her aunt Rahel Varnhagen was a noted salon host. After the deaths of their parents and the Great Fire of Hamburg in 1842, Assing and her sister Ludmilla went to live with their uncle, the prominent literary figure and revolutionary activist, Karl August Varnhagen von Ense. His wife, the noted Jewish writer and saloniste Rahel Varnhagen, was long dead. Ottilie and Ludmilla soon came to blows in that household, and Ottilie left, never to return. Career and personal life In 1852, Assing emigrated to the United States, settling in New York City and eventually nearby in Hoboken, New Jersey. She supported herself by writing articles for the Morgenblatt f√ºr gebildete Leser and often wrote under a male pseudonym. At first, she wrote general interest pieces about culture, but soon her writing focused on the abolitionist movement. Through the hundreds of articles she wrote, hers became one of the central voices in interpreting abolitionism and the realities of the United States' slave-holding society for European audiences. Assing read the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass and impressed, she went to Rochester to interview Douglass in 1856. She suggested that she should translate his work into German. They struck up an immediate friendship. Over the next 28 years, they attended numerous meetings and conventions together. She visited and stayed with his family numerous times, living in their home for months at a time.Brent Staples, \\"Frederick the Great: Review of Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom by David W. Blight\\", New York Times Book Review, 11 November 2018 Assing translated Douglass's works for her German audience, in addition to lining up a publisher for My Bondage and My Freedom (Sklaverei und Freiheit: Autobiografie von Frederick Douglass), distributed by Hoffmann and Campe in Hamburg in 1860. Douglass and Assing are widely believed to have had an intimate relationship, but the surviving correspondence contains no proof for that.David Blight describes their complicated relationship in his biography: Blight, David W. Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom, New York 2018, pp. 521-522, 529, 570, 572-574. She also gave him shelter when \\"he was on the run from conspiracy charges in connection with John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry\\", when he was at risk for capture and execution. Her friend Helene von Racowitza said in her memoirs that Assing was deeply in love with Douglass. Eighteen years into their professional collaboration, Assing wrote \\"...if one stands in so intimate a relationship with a man as I do with Douglass, one comes to know facets of the whole world, of men and women, which would otherwise remain closed, especially if it is a man whom the entire world has seen and whom so many women have loved.\\" In 1884, having already been diagnosed with incurable breast cancer, Assing was in Europe trying to establish her claim to her sister's estate when she learned that Douglass had married Helen Pitts, a younger white woman who worked with him as his secretary in the Recorder's Office. Assing had struggled with depression during much of her life, and her physician was aware that she had suicidal tendencies. In August 1884, Assing killed herself by swallowing cyanide in a public park in Paris. As per her will of November 9, 1871, her correspondence with Douglass was burned. She bequeathed him ongoing income from a $13,000 trust fund. In a later codicil, she had additionally willed him her personal album and his choice of books from her library.

In Japan, they are widely used at the edges of rice paddy fields to provide a strip of bright flowers in the summer, and over 230 cultivars have been selected for garden use. They are locally naturalised in the southeastern United States, where they are often called hurricane flowers, due to their blooming period coinciding with the peak of hurricane season.http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/ep255 In China, people often use them as decorations in festivals or celebrations. Legends Since these scarlet flowers usually bloom near cemeteries around the autumnal equinox, they are described in Chinese and Japanese translations of the Lotus Sutra as ominous flowers that grow in Diyu (also known as Hell), or Hu√°ngqu√°n (Simplified Chinese: ÈªÑÊ≥â; Traditional Chinese: ÈªÉÊ≥â), and guide the dead into the next reincarnation. When the flowers of lycoris bloom, their leaves would have fallen; when their leaves grow, the flowers would have wilted. This habit gave rise to various legends. A famous one is the legend of two elves: Ma√±ju (Simplified Chinese: ÊõºÁè†; Traditional Chinese: ÊõºÁè†), who guarded the flower, and Saka (Simplified Chinese: Ê≤ôÂçé; Traditional Chinese: Ê≤ôËèØ), who guarded the leaves. Out of curiosity, they defied their fate of guarding the herb alone, and managed to meet each other. At first sight, they fell in love with each other. God, exasperated by their waywardness, separated the miserable couple, and laid a curse on them as a punishment: the flowers of Ma√±ju shall never meet the leaves of Saka again. It was said that when the couple met after death in Diyu, they vowed to meet each other after reincarnation. However, neither of them could keep their word. In commemoration of the couple, some call the herbs \\"Ma√±jusaka\\" (Simplified Chinese: ÊõºÁè†Ê≤ôÂçé; Traditional Chinese: ÊõºÁè†Ê≤ôËèØ), a mixture of \\"Ma√±ju\\" and \\"Saka\\", instead of their scientific name. The same name is used in Japanese, in which it is pronounced manju-syage. Some other legends have it that when a person sees someone that they may never meet again, these flowers, also called red spider lilies, would bloom along the path. Perhaps because of these sorrowful legends, Japanese people often used these flowers in funerals. Popular name of Japanese for lycoris is literally higan (the other or that shore of sanzu river) flower means, decorate and enjoyable, flower of afterlife in .

It is about south of Witney.  Manor  In 1086 the Domesday Book records that Walter of Ponz held the manor of Yelford. Walter's other manors included Eaton Hastings, and together his manors were sometimes called the honour of Hastings. By 1221 the overlord of the manor was one Philip of Hastings. In 1651 The Hastings family sold the manor of Yelford to William Lenthall, who was Speaker of the House of Commons during the Long Parliament, Rump Parliament and First Protectorate Parliament. The manor remained in the Lenthall family until 1949. In the latter part of the 15th century the Hastings family built the manor house, a timber-framed building with a moat. It was altered in about 1600, when a first floor was inserted in what until then had been the great hall and a great stone chimneystack was added. Early in the 20th century the house was divided for use by three families and by the middle of the century it was derelict. It was restored in 1952. In the 1970s Jennifer Sherwood described the house as \\"The best, and certainly the most picturesque, large timber-framed house in the county.\\"  Parish church  The small Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas and Saint Swithun may have been founded as a chapel by 1221, when Philip of Hastings was recorded as patron of the living. It was completely rebuilt in about 1500. It was restored at some time between 1869 and 1873, which may be when the bellcote was added.  Parish  Yelford was always a small parish. In 1851 the population was only 17. The ancient parish became a civil parish in 1866, but in 1932 it was merged with the parish of Hardwick and parts of Ducklington and Standlake to form the civil parish of Hardwick-with-Yelford.

He made many television and Broadway appearances as well, including successful runs in Clifford Odets's The Flowering Peach and Harold Rome's The Zulu and the Zayda. Life and career Born in Warsaw, Poland, Skulnik reportedly ran away at the age of 10 to join a circus.

They joined together to officially form the partnership known as CourseInfo and developed the company into a small course management software provider. The product at the time was called the Teachers Toolbox. In 1998 the CourseInfo team met two principals of Blackboard LLC while pursuing a grant for adaptive testing. Shortly after the two companies joined together to form what is now known as Blackboard Inc. Company formation CourseInfo was formed in late 1996- early 1997 via a partnership agreement between Cane and Gilfus. Early on Cane had begun developing web based scripts for professor Cindy van Es at Cornell for her statistics class. This activity was mostly driven by Dr. van Es's desire for bringing technology in the classroom and Cane's experience with new technologies. As one of the five supercomputer centers holding up ARPANET‚Äîthe precursor underpinnings of the internet‚ÄîCornell was an early implementation of email, web and technology usage. Cornell had been using computer based course technology such as PLATO since the early 1970s. Product development In 1996 Cane wrote simple automated scripts for websites for instructors using the Perl programming language and Netscape 2.0. In 1997 after the founding of CourseInfo, version 1.0 of the \\"Teachers Toolbox\\" was launched including a series of named \\"Generator\\" tools including the coursesite generator, announcement generator, quiz generator, survey generator and other tools. Gilfus designed the features and functions and web design of the product through personal experience and instructor feedback while Cane developed the core technology of the product. Gilfus also led sales, marketing and product management for the company. Much of the company's initial communication was on educational listservs and web boards. In mid-1997, the \\"Interactive Learning Network\\" ILN 1.5, was released and installed at several academic institutions including Cornell University, Yale Medical School and University of Pittsburgh. The ILN was the first e-learning system of its kind to leverage and install on top of a relational database MySQL. Access control was added to provide security around course content. Guest access was provided for course shopping. In 1998 the CourseInfo product line (then the Interactive Learning Network or ILN) became the foundation for Blackboard's e-learning product line as Blackboard's CourseInfo. On April 29, 1998 the CourseInfo was among the first to implement emerging industry standards. On November 2, 1998 the company released CourseInfo 2.0, and on July 26, 1999 they released CourseInfo 3.0 CourseInfo 4.0. was released on October 26, 1999 On January 19, 2000 the company released CourseInfo Enterprise Edition. Prior to the Blackboard‚ÄìCourseInfo merger, Blackboard was focused on developing a prototype for IMS (Instructional Management Systems). Blackboard overview Blackboard Inc. was formed by the joining of CourseInfo LLC, founded by Cane and Gilfus, and Blackboard LLC, founded by Michael Chasen and Matthew Pittinsky. Originally the Blackboard company began as a consulting firm contracting to the non-profit IMS Global Learning Consortium. In 1998, it merged with CourseInfo LLC, a small course management software provider that originated at Cornell University. The combined company became known as Blackboard Inc. The first line of e-learning products was branded Blackboard CourseInfo, but the CourseInfo brand was dropped in 2000. Blackboard went public in June 2004. It operated publicly until Providence Equity Partners purchased the company in 2011.

His best-known works are Coal is Our Life (written with Norman Dennis and Fernando Henriques) and Marxism, Ideology and Literature. Index Books published his Not Without a Storm: Towards a Communist Manifesto for the Age of Globalisation in 2006. Early life During the Second World War Slaughter worked in a coalmine as one of the Bevin Boys. He later became a lecturer and writer on sociology and Marxism. As a lecturer at the Universities of Leeds and Bradford Slaughter joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. He left in 1956, following the Soviet invasion of Hungary, and joined Gerry Healy's group The Club.Peter Fryer. Yorkshire Post (Leeds). 4 November 2006. p. 1. Slaughter remained with the group for almost 30 years, during which it became known as the Socialist Labour League and then as the Workers Revolutionary Party (WRP). He came to be regarded as one of the group's leading intellectuals,http://www.revolutionaryhistory.co.uk/marxist- writers/436-bob- pitt/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=4159:chpt6&catid;=112:healey&Itemid;=616 and remained on its Central Committee throughout. Split in the WRP in 1985 In 1985 Healy faced allegations of sexually harassing female members of the WRP, leading Cliff Slaughter and Michael Banda to oppose him. This broadened into a more general criticism of the party's direction. They were able to gain the support of a majority of the group, and forced Healy to retire. When Healy again tried to exert authority Slaughter and Banda led a call for \\"revolutionary morality\\" and expelled Healy and his supporters. This effectively split the organisation between their supporters and those of Healy and his ally Sheila Torrance.http://www.revolutionaryhistory.co.uk/marxist- writers/436-bob- pitt/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=4153:chpt11&catid;=112:healey&Itemid;=616 Slaughter and Banda's group at first called itself the Workers Revolutionary Party (Workers Press). However, Banda soon left the group and repudiated Trotskyism. The international supporters of the group decided to call themselves the Workers International to Rebuild the Fourth International (WIRFI), and published both the Workers Press and the International journal. In the 1990s the members of a sub-group within WIRFI influenced by Slaughter decided that the creation of an elite vanguard party was not the way to build towards socialism. Over the past 20 years Slaughter has been increasingly influenced in his theoretical work by the writings of Istvan Meszaros. In 2006 Slaughter published Not Without a Storm: Towards a Communist Manifesto for the Age of Globalisation,http://www.indexbooks.co.uk/indexnew.html a book intended to open discussion of contemporary issues and the responsibility of socialists.

It lies on the River Til which feeds into the Great Ouse valley and is about 70m above sea level. It is approximately 14 miles north of Bedford, 3.75miles south-east of Higham Ferrers and 6.75 miles west of Kimbolton and is in the Hundred of Stodden. The countryside around the village rises to about 90m above sea level, is generally open and rolling in nature and is predominantly used for agricultural purposes. The centre piece of the village is the Castle Mound or Yielden Castle the site of a Norman motte-and-bailey castle. This is now a complex of grassed over earthworks dominated by a central mound. Other notable features include the church of St Mary, a Wesleyan Chapel built in 1884, the Chequers Public House and the Yelden Village Hall. It has a present population of roughly between 150 ‚Äì 200 adults and 50 ‚Äì 100 children living in about 90 residences. It is in the civil parish of Melchbourne and Yielden. Yelden has its own book under the title Yelden Past and Present produced by the Yelden Parish Study Group that was first printed in 1972. It has since been updated and reprinted in 2001 and is the definitive source of historical information about the village. Much of the information in this article has been made with reference to this publication. Neighbouring villages include Melchbourne, Newton Bromswold, Upper Dean and Shelton. The History of Yelden Archaeological excavations carried out by Bedfordshire County Council along with other historical works have shown evidence of a near continuous occupation in the village dating back to the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age (c.2000 -800 BC). Latterly the village appeared in the Domesday Book of 1086 as 'Giveldene' where an account of its history was recorded. The Castle Mound ‚Äì Motte and Bailey Castle This is a significant archaeological site and one of the most interesting of its type in the county. It was the site of a Norman motte and bailey castle that from Domesday to the 13th century was the stronghold of the Trailly family. It is an imposing feature with a central conical mound rising to about 40 feet above the bottom of its north moat. It is in 2 levels with 2 extensive baileys and is not surrounded by a moat. There have been suggestions that prior to Norman times it was occupied by the Iceni, an ancient tribe of Britains and that they battled with the Romans at the site but opinions differ as to the accuracy of this assertion. By 1360 it had fallen in disuse and ruin. The Church of St Mary It is a good example of a village church mainly in the Decorated style. Originally the Trailly family received it from the monks at Thorney Abbey early in the 12th Century and was confirmed to them by a charter of Pope Alexander III in 1162. Although Norman in origin its shows no indication of this in its construction. It consists of a Nave and Chancel dating back to the early 13th Century and had been considerably re-modelled since then, the most notable feature being the tower and broach spire. Yelden at war 1939 ‚Äì 1945 Home Guard troops 'fighting' Valentine tanks of 6th Armoured Division during large-scale manoeuvres, 27 July 1941. World War II was a significant time in the history of the village because of its close proximity to Chelveston Aerodrome, which was originally built with three runways in 1941. An Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment detachment began flying from the aerodrome in 1942 with Horsa gliders towed by Short Stirling aircraft. Later in 1942, following the entry of the United States into the war, it eventually became the home of the United States Army Air Forces 305th Bombardment Group, which had four squadrons of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses pioneering the daylight formation and bombing procedures of the time. There were almost 2,000 personnel based at the aerodrome flying a total of 337 missions between November 1942 and April 1945. During these missions, a total of 22,362 tons of bombs were dropped on enemy targets and 332 enemy aircraft were claimed shot down at the expense of 154 Allied aircraft and 810 men. During the aerodromes construction, a series of buildings were erected in the village near the church as quarters for the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) but instead became the sergeant's mess for the Americans. In more recent times these buildings, known locally as \\"the camps,\\" fell into rack and ruin and so were demolished to make way for a new housing development.

The remainder of those who died consisted of servicemen who were sleeping in a barrack block which the aircraft hit and the crew of the bomber. It is said that at certain times of the year the distant drone of a B-17 can be heard in the early dawn hours, and there are also various sightings of ghostly airmen seen around the church yard and near to the crash site. Notable Figures In June 1943, as Yielden had a depleted population, an American Air-force Pilot named Dick Rodgers assisted in the administration and running of the town's noted Strawberry Fayre. During his short stay there, Rodgers became a very popular figure within the community. He encouraged his fellow air-force pilots to volunteer and raise funds for the local church during their time at the Yielden airbase. He later died, whilst completing a supply drop during the Battle of the Bulge. Although his body was never recovered, there is a commemorative plaque on a bench outside the Western gate of the Church. Joe Ekins (15 July 1923 ‚Äì 1 February 2012), Tank Gunner, credited by some for killing German tank Commander Michael Wittmann was born in Yielden. Spelling of the village name In common with most other place, the village name has evolved over the centuries. The earliest recorded version was 'Giveldene' in 1086 and since then there have been over 20 changes. At one stage (circa 1390) it was recorded as being 'Yelden' before becoming known as Yeveldene in 1461. Other names include Chivelden, Gyueldene, Yueldene, Yealdon, Evelden, Yeveldene, Yielding and Yeilden. Finally it was recorded as being 'Yelden' again in 1830 with the latest variant 'Yielden' having arrived in more recent times. Yelden spelt wrong on a Signpost in Rushden Depending on which direction you approach from you will find that the name of the village is spelt differently on various sign posts: *Yelden *Yielden *Yeldon There has been much argument over the correct spelling the village name over recent years and it still remains a matter of confusion for those trying to find their way to the village. Currently the 'correct' spelling officially used by the county is 'Yielden' although some other neighbouring counties seem not to have been told. A questionnaire on the subject was circulated to villagers in 1998. 44 considered the village to be called 'Yelden' ‚Äì 30 considered it to be called 'Yielden'. Modern postal systems generally record it as 'Yielden' Modern day Yelden Social Scene Yelden is famed for its Strawberry Fayre which is held on the last Sunday in June each year. This generally attracts thousands of visitors to the village to sample oysters and champagne, strawberry teas, live jazz, classic cars, bikes and tractors and traditional summer fete activities to raise funds for the Church. Village Pub Unfortunately the Chequers Inn has failed to buck the national trend for pub closures and opened for the last time in 2016. Whilst there have been attempts to reopen it tied with some development of land behind the pub, at time of writing (February 2019) the business remains closed.

He developed a polyphony similar to Bach's counterpoint, but based on motivic working and dissonance rather than harmonic progression. Biography Early life Valen was born in Stavanger, Norway in 1887 into a deeply Christian religious family and maintained his religious beliefs all his life. His parents were missionaries, and he spent five years of his childhood in Madagascar . In addition to his aptitude for music, he was also a polyglot, mastering at least nine languages. He earned his examen artium with the highest grades in all subjects except mathematics. He loved cats, nature and literature, cultivated roses (even developed an award-winning hybrid), and after losing them in a devastating freeze took up growing cacti. Musical career In 1906, Valen moved to Oslo to study Norwegian literature and language but also took classes with Catharinus Elling (1858‚Äì1942) at the Oslo Conservatory of Music, graduating with a degree in organ playing. In 1909 he moved to Berlin to study piano, theory, and composition at the Music Academy with (amongst others) Max Bruch . While in Berlin, he worked on exercises in both tonal and atonal counterpoint. In 1916, he returned to Norway and took up residence at his family estate with his mother and sister in Sunnhordland where he started the most productive phase of his career, churning out more than 25,000 piano etudes (though they are not among his official works), while continuing to refine his own dissonant counterpoint. The counterpoint has similarities to that of J.S. Bach and Arnold Schoenberg, though evidence reveals that they were developed independently. After his mother's death, Valen traveled to Rome and Paris during the 1920s, gaining much inspiration from the wealth of art and architecture there. His work became more controversial among many conservative critics, much to Valen's disappointment. In 1924 he returned to Oslo, and from 1927 to 1936 he worked as a musical archivist at the University of Oslo. In 1935 the government gave him a semi-permanent grant for composers. He quit teaching and moved back to Sunnhordland into the care of his sister and began to compose full-time. After 1948, his work began to gain greater recognition, both within Norway and outside . Among others, pianist Glenn Gould became a great admirer of Valen and wrote in a letter to Jane Fiedman of CBS Records at the time of his recording of Valen's Piano Sonata no. 2, \\"I really do feel, for the first time in many years, that I've encountered a major figure in 20th century music\\" . Valen never married. He died in 1952 in Haugesund.

It is a part of Thrissur Municipal Corporation and Nenmanikkara Grama Panchayat. Etymology Since Thalore is situated at a slightly higher altitude compared to neighbouring villages it got the name Thaloor (Malayalam: ‡¥§‡¥≤‡µÇ‡¥∞‡µç) from the two Malayalam words ‡¥§‡¥≤ (meaning head) and ‡¥ä‡¥∞‡µç (meaning place). Thaloor later became Thalore. Geography The Infant Jesus Church at a height of 96 feet above sea level, is the highest situated structure in the village. From there, the terrain slowly tapers down towards all sides; the village boundary is approximately 30 feet above sea level. Transportation Old NH-47 to Thrissur passes through Thalore centre. The new NH-47 by-pass to Palakkad is now the south-east boundary. Thaikkattussery road connects the old NH-47 from Thalore centre to Thaikkattusery. Both KSRTC and private bus services connect Thalore to Thrissur in the north and Amballur, Pudukkad, Kodakara and Chalakkudy in the south. The nearest railway stations are Ollur and Pudukkad stations where local passenger services stop. Express trains are available from Thrissur. Economy In the 1970s, the paddy fields became economically non-viable, and were soon turned into clay brick farms. Thalore and its neighbouring places became the epicenter of this clay brick business, and it remains a major source of income for villagers. Like any other village in Kerala, Thalore also has a significant non-resident kerala community which also brings resources to the village.

The first of these was The Nautch Girl. The fashion in the late Victorian era was to present long evenings in the theatre, and so producer Richard D'Oyly Carte preceded his Savoy operas with curtain raisers.Lee Bernard. \\"Swash- buckling Savoy curtain-raiser\\", Sheffield Telegraph, 1 August 2008 W. J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ‚Ä¶ [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ‚Ä¶ the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen-Pope, Walter James. Carriages at Eleven (1947), London: Robert Hale and Co., p. 23 To create a curtain raiser for The Nautch Girl, Carte turned to Cellier, who was the long-time music director of the Savoy Theatre and had produced other works for Carte. Greenbank, on the other hand, was a new writer who would go on to a very productive and successful career writing lyrics for hit musicals, although he lived to the age of only 33. Synopsis Captain Billy has been absent from Porthaven, his native village, for many years. His relatives do not know that he has been pursuing a very successful career as a pirate. A young foundling, Christopher Jolly, visits the village to examine the parish register in an attempt to find his birth certificate; he does not know his own age. Jolly falls in love with Polly, and they exchange this dialogue: :JOLLY: I love you. ‚Ä¶ But until that certificate is forthcoming, we can never be married. ‚Ä¶ My darling, you surely would not marry a man whose age you did not know? :POLLY: Oh, Christopher, my precious, your personal appearance pleases me very much! Why should I trouble about your age? :JOLLY: ‚Ä¶ How would you feel if the certificate were found, and showed that you had married a man old enough to be your grandfather? Or, possibly, I might turn out to be years younger than you are. Would you like to have it said that you had entrapped a mere boy into marriage? ‚Ä¶ I like to think that I am young; it gives me so much longer to find the certificate in. Billy returns to the village on the same day and is recognised by his brother Samuel Chunk. Billy is reunited with his wife, who is surprised to discover that she is not a widow after all, and Jolly discovers that he is Billy's nephew, whom the old scoundrel had \\"lost\\" in the Sahara Desert many years before. Billy attests to Jolly's age, so that he can wed Polly.

It is sandwiched between a long sandy beach in Cardigan Bay and the beach in the Dyfi Estuary. The area between the sea and the estuary beach is made up of the Ynyslas Sand Dunes which are part of the Dyfi National Nature Reserve and home to many rare plants and animals. The sands of the estuary beach can be driven onto and parked upon. The nature reserve has a visitor centre with toilets and a small shop. At the start of some BBC 1 programmes it shows people flying kites on sand dunes and this was filmed at Ynyslas. The northern end of the Ceredigion Coast Path extends to the Dyfi Estuary National Nature Reserve at Ynyslas.The Long Distance Walkers' Association - Ceredigion Coast Path Ecology The Dyfi National Nature Reserve and the Ynyslas Sand Dunes are situated where the mouth of the Afon Leri joins the Dyfi Estuary at Ynyslas. Cors Fochno is situated to the east beyond the Afon Leri. At low tide the remains of an ancient submerged forest with stumps of petrified oak, pine, birch, willow and hazel are exposed on the beach. Railway From 1867 Ynyslas had a railway station on the Cambrian Railways, with sidings serving the riverside wharves. The Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway proposed to create a narrow-gauge line to the wharves in the 1890s but this was never built. Ynyslas railway station was closed by the London Midland Region of British Railways on 14 June 1965.

Assistant coaching As an assistant coach, Hallman served four seasons (1973‚Äì1976) under Bear Bryant at Alabama, two seasons under Richard Williamson at Memphis State in 1977-78 University of Memphis 1977 & 78 media guides and six seasons (1982‚Äì1987) under Jackie Sherrill at his alma mater, coaching the defensive backs of the famed Wrecking Crew before being offered a head coaching position at Southern Miss. He had additionally coached linebackers (1979‚Äì1980) and defensive backs (1981) at Clemson University under Danny Ford. Southern Miss In 1987, Hallman became the head coach at Southern Miss, where he proceeded to compile the highest winning percentage in school history with the help of future NFL star quarterback Brett Favre. Hallman coached the Golden Eagles to a 23‚Äì11 record in three seasons. In his first year, he guided the team to a 1988 Independence Bowl victory over the UTEP Miners. Over the next two seasons, Southern Miss gained a reputation as \\"giant killers,\\" thanks to victories over national powers such as Florida State and Alabama, all on the road. He is credited for laying the foundation for Southern Miss' rise to regional power status under Jeff Bower. LSU On November 28, 1990, Hallman was hired to coach the LSU Tigers, replacing Mike Archer. He left for Baton Rouge just days before the Golden Eagles were due to play in the 1990 All- American Bowl. Jeff Bower, his offensive coordinator, coached the Golden Eagles in that game. During Hallman's first season in 1991, several of Hallman's football players were accused of instigating a fight with LSU men's basketball players, including All-American Shaquille O'Neal, in Broussard Hall, LSU's athletic dormitory, two days prior to the Tigers' contest with Mississippi State. LSU started the 1991 season with one-sided losses to Georgia (31‚Äì10) and Hallman's alma mater, Texas A&M; (45‚Äì7), and finished 5‚Äì6. The season marked the second time LSU suffered three consecutive losing seasons, and the first time since 1954 to 1956. The 1992 season included being shut out 32‚Äì0 by Ole Miss on Halloween, and beaten 30‚Äì6 at Arkansas in the season finale, which was the first meeting between the Tigers and the Razorbacks upon Arkansas joining the SEC. The Tigers finished 2‚Äì9, still the worst in school history. In 1993, LSU's centennial football season, the Tigers lost 58‚Äì3 to the Florida Gators in Tiger Stadium, the worst loss in school history. Amazingly, just four weeks after that, the Tigers stunned the Alabama Crimson Tide, 17‚Äì13, at Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, ending the Tide's 31-game unbeaten streak. LSU entered the season finale at 5‚Äì5, with a chance at its first bowl bid since the end of the 1988 season. However, the Tigers gave up 412 yards rushing in a 42‚Äì24 loss to Arkansas at home. The beginning of the end for Hallman came on September 17, 1994 at Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium against Auburn. LSU led 23‚Äì9 early in the fourth quarter, and the Bayou Bengals were in good position to end Auburn's 13-game winning streak. But LSU quarterback Jamie Howard threw two interceptions that were returned for Auburn touchdowns, tying the game. LSU regained the lead with a field goal, but when the Bayou Bengals were trying to run out the clock, Howard threw his fourth interception of the game, and incredibly, Auburn returned the pick for another touchdown, giving the home team a 30‚Äì26 lead. LSU drove into Auburn territory in the game's final minute, but Howard threw his fifth and sixth interceptions on consecutive drives, sealing the win for Auburn. LSU never recovered, and ultimately finished 4-7. On November 12, LSU lost to Southern Miss 20-18 in front of the smallest Death Valley crowd since 1974 (announced attendance was 51,718, but LSU officials estimated the actual crowd was closer to 40,000). Two days later, LSU athletic director Joe Dean gave Hallman an ultimatum‚Äìresign or be fired. When Hallman refused to resign, Dean fired him, though he was allowed to finish out the season. He closed out his career at LSU with a 30-12 win over Arkansas‚Äîthe Tigers' first regular-season win in the series since 1956. His overall record was 16‚Äì28; his winning percentage of .364 is the worst for a non-interim coach in school history. To date, Hallman is the only LSU coach since the formation of the SEC to have never tallied a winning record or coached in a bowl game. After LSU Hallman continued working at the college level as a position coach and coordinator for another decade, with stops at SEC schools Alabama and Mississippi State. In 2001, Hallman was the co-defensive coordinator for the Birmingham Thunderbolts in the XFL. From 2004 to 2007, he served as head coach at Muscle Shoals High School in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. His first season at Muscle Shoals resulted in a 3‚Äì7 record. At the conclusion of the 2007 regular season, the Muscle Shoals Trojans had compiled another dismal 4‚Äì6 record, their fourth straight losing season under Hallman. On January 14, 2008, the Muscle Shoals Board of Education accepted Hallman's resignation as head coach. He was replaced by Cordova High School's former head coach Scott Basden. Personal life Hallman is married to former Alabama State Senator Tammy Irons of Florence.

A play begins at either the snap from the center or at kickoff. Most commonly plays occur at the snap during a down. These plays range from basic to very intricate. Football players keep a record of these plays in their playbook.https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a26078069/tom-brady-super- bowl-2019-talent/ Order of a play Drawing up a play. A play begins in one of two ways: *A play from scrimmage begins when the ball is delivered from the center to a back, usually the quarterback. *A free kick Once the play begins, it will continue until one of the following events happens: *The ball carrier is down, usually defined as when any body part besides the hands and feet touches the ground. *The ball carrier's forward progress is stopped to the point where a stalemate occurs and it is clear that the ball cannot be advanced any farther, nor is he easily going down as defined above. *The ball carrier steps out of bounds. *A forward pass touches the ground before it is caught (an incomplete pass). The ball touching the ground in other situations (called a fumble) does NOT end the play. In the case of a fumble, the play still continues until one of the above conditions is met. When the play ends, the ball is set for the next play. For the first three instances above, the ball is set at the point of its maximum forward progress. That means that if a runner is driven back in the process of a tackle OR is ruled down by lack of forward progress, the ball is placed as close to his opponent's goal line as he had gotten before being driven back. If he runs backwards of his own volition, the ball is marked where he goes down. In the case of an incomplete pass, the ball is placed at the previous line of scrimmage. Play then resumes as described above. Formation requirements The offensive team must have seven players on the line of scrimmage at the start of a play. Those players may be positioned at any place along the line of scrimmage (which extends all of the way across the playing field). The defensive team may position as many as 11 players on the line of scrimmage. Usually, there are from 3 to 8 defensive players on the line of scrimmage. Offensive plays Offensive terminology *run block -- An active type of blocking, where the player steps forward in an attempt to push a defensive player out of the path of the ball carrier. *pass block-- A passive type of blocking, where the player steps backward to establish a pocket around the quarterback to give the quarterback a chance to pass. *lead block-- A situation where one player precedes the ball carrier along his intended path in order to clear any defensive players that have not already been blocked. *pull -- When a member of the offensive line takes a step back from his usual place in a line and moves laterally in order to block somewhere else. Pulling can be done on pass and run plays. *pocket -- The protected area around a quarterback established by the offensive line in order to give him adequate time and sight lines in order to complete a pass. *gap -- A space between blockers. Defenders can shoot the gap. *hole -- A space in the line where a ball carrier aims on a running play. These can be predesignated holes defined by the spacing between players before the snap, or they can be established by moving players around and establishing the holes after the snap (in a play called run-to-daylight). *snap The act of the center passing the ball from a resting position on the ground to a player behind the line of scrimmage, usually (but not always) the quarterback. *pass -- Also called a forward pass. A ball that leaves a player's hand and moves towards the opponents goal line. *lateral -- Also called a backward pass, pitch, or pitch-out. A ball that leaves a player's hand and moves parallel to or away from the opponent's goal line. *handoff -- A ball that is handed directly from one player to another without leaving the first player's hands first. Running plays In a running play, the ball is advanced beyond the line of scrimmage by a player who receives it from behind the line of scrimmage. The player advancing the ball can be: *the player (usually the quarterback) who receives the ball from the center, or *any further player to receive the ball via handoff or lateral. Any number of handoffs or laterals can occur on any play at any time. Up the middle Also called dive, plunge, buck, guts, slam or numerous other names. The most basic run play is a run up the middle. In this case, the ball is handed off from the quarterback to a running back. The back then aims for a predetermined hole between his offensive linemen. This hole can be either between center and guard or between guard and tackle. The offensive line will run block, pushing defenders away from the chosen hole. Often, the fullback will lead block through the hole first to clear a path for the half back or running back. *In a run up the middle, the running back will aim for one of the A or B gaps: W T G C G T E ^^ ^^ ^^ ^^ W Off tackle Off Tackle play. The 'bread-and-butter' of a run-oriented offense, this is typically the most common run play. Rather than aiming for a hole in the line, the running back aims for the spot just outside the tackle. This type of play allows for more improvisation by the running back once he is past the line, since there is often more open field in this area than in any run up the middle. Toss In a toss play, the RB \\"curves out\\" toward the sideline on either side and the QB pitches (\\"tosses\\") the ball to the RB. Sweep A fullback sweep play In a sweep play, the fullback begins by running towards the sideline before heading forward. This motion allows for some of the offensive linemen, often one or both guards, to pull from their normal positions and establish a lane for the running back to run through. A lead blocking fullback often leads him through the lane. This play, known as the Packers sweep, was the central play in Vince Lombardi's \\"run-to-daylight\\" offense that was so successful for the Green Bay Packers of the 1960s. Trap In a trap, a guard on the back side of the play (away from the direction the fullback or running back is heading) will pull and lead block for the running back (most of the time, the guard will blindside an unblocked down linemen, and kick him out of the play). Often, the fullback will take the place of the guard, and block the opening allowed by this. *Trap blocking for a run through the 3-hole between the guard and tackle (In some numbering schemes, the left and right sides are reversed, and this would be the 2-hole instead). The running back will follow the guard through the hole. _ _ _ _ _ _    W T G C G T E |W Counter Also called a misdirection. In this play, the runner begins by taking a step or two away from his intended path, then doubling back and heading in the opposite direction. Often defenders are clueing on the first move of the running back. The defenders committed to the first step, but the play moves in the opposite direction. Counter plays are often (but not always) coupled with influence blocking, where the offensive line blocks the defense towards (rather than away from) the intended direction of the play. This gambit often causes the defenders to think the play is going in the opposite direction, and they react as such. Draw Also called a delay. In a draw play, the offensive line drops into pass blocking positions, and the quarterback takes a drop as though he were going to pass. He then hands the ball off to his running back (or keeps it himself) and runs forward past the rushing defenders. The idea is that the defenders will be tricked in advancing on the quarterback as though it were a pass play, and this will vacate the area just beyond the line of scrimmage for the runner to take advantage of. Bootleg The quarterback fakes a handoff to the running back and continues running with the ball opposite from the direction the running back was headed. The bootleg can have blockers similar to a sweep (and in such cases is it often called a quarterback sweep) or it can be run naked, that is without any blockers at all. A naked bootleg relies on the defense buying the fake handoff and moving to tackle the running back rather than the quarterback. Quarterback sneak The quarterback takes the snap and immediately dives to one side of the center or the other. This is often a short yardage play designed when only a yard or so is needed for a first down or a touchdown. Often the only players on either side of the ball that know the play is coming are the quarterback and the center (hence the sneak aspect of it), as the play is often decided by the quarterback upon seeing the defense. The play is often called by a silent signal between quarterback and center (a pinch or a tap in the direction the sneak is headed). End-around The wide receiver takes a handoff directly from the quarterback. The receiver then may proceed to do one of two things: he either runs the ball towards the line of scrimmage in order to gain yardage, or more rarely, he attempts to pass to another eligible pass receiver. Reverse This play resembles a sweep, but before the running back crosses the line of scrimmage, he hands the ball off to a wide receiver going in them reverse (opposite) direction of where the running back was going. If the defense was drawn to the side of the field the running back was going towards, the receiver can outrun the defense to the other side of the field and make a big gain. Option An option play is a play in which the quarterback holds the ball and runs to either side of the offensive line, waiting for an opportunity to run upfield and advance the ball. At the same time, the running back follows, allowing the quarterback the 'option' of pitching the ball just before he is tackled. This tactic forces defensive players to commit to either preventing the pitch or tackling the quarterback, allowing the offensive team to choose the best result. The option play requires a very fast and mobile quarterback to execute it, and employs a great deal of risk, because if the pitch is mishandled it is a live ball that can be recovered by the defense. The option is rarely seen outside of college football, as high school teams lack the skill to execute it properly, and defensive players on professional teams are quick enough to disrupt the play to the point that it doesn't merit the risk involved. College football teams West Virginia and Air Force often employ this playstyle. A common form of the option executed on the high school, collegiate, and occasionally professional levels is the veer. Passing plays Pass routes A route is a path or pattern that a receiver in American football and Canadian football runs to get open for a forward pass. =Go= A go or fly route is a deep route used typically when the receiver has a speed advantage over the defensive back. In the route, the receiver will run as fast as possible in order to get deeper than the defensive back allowing the quarterback to throw the ball in a spot where only the receiver can get to it. Due to the speed of the current NFL and college games the go will often be preceded by a double move. Often used to win the game =Post= A post is a deep play where wide receivers run straight down the field a short distance (10-15 yards), and then angle in toward the center of the field (toward the goal 'posts', or like a 'flag post') where the ball is caught at high speed. When this play was originally designed, the goal posts were on the \\"zero\\" yard line, in the front of the endzone - thus, a cornerback in man coverage would be led into the post. In a skinny post, the route is shorter and quicker than a deep post, which may cover 30 or 40 yards. This may also be referred to as a \\"glance in\\" or a \\"bang eight.\\" =Flag= A flag or corner route is a deep play where wide receivers run straight down the field a long distance (40‚Äì50 yards), and then angle out towards the end zone and sideline. It takes its name from the flags that marked the ends of the goal and end lines before the introduction of flexible pylons. =Out= An out route will usually feature the receiver running 7 to 10 yards downfield and then making a 90 degree turn towards the sideline. =In/Drag= The In or Drag route is the opposite of the Out route. As its name suggests, the route will usually feature the receiver running 7 to 10 yards downfield and then making a 90 degree turn towards the center of the field. =Slant= A receiver takes two steps or more downfield then cuts diagonally across the field behind the linebackers and in front of the safeties. =Hook/Hitch= An eligible receiver runs a predetermined number of steps or yards upfield before stopping and turning back in slightly to face the quarterback, in the hopes that the defender cannot react and disrupt the pass before positive yardage is made. =Arrow= A flat route is named after the area of the field where it takes place. During a typical play, due to the routes of other receivers, there is an area of the field that is vacated. This area known as the \\"flats\\" is typically from the hash marks to the sideline and from the line of scrimmage to 3-5 yards downfield. The route itself may be executed several ways. The most common is also known as the arrow. This consists of a receiver lining up near the offensive tackle and then taking a short angled path directly to this area. Running backs often will execute a special flat route that involves them running toward the sideline without the ball from the backfield and then turning upfield as a receiver. This is often referred to as a swing route. Option routes Particularly in the highest levels of competition (professional and major college), a play may call for the receiver to 'read' the defensive coverage against him, and run a second route if the first option would be ineffectual. As an example, the receiver may be instructed to begin with a slant route, but if the defender has that covered, switch to an out route. For this to work correctly, the passer must make the same read as the receiver. Screen pass A screen pass is a pass that is normally thrown to a receiver or running back behind the line of scrimmage. It is thrown behind the line of scrimmage so that the pulling linemen can get their blocks established. There is another screen called a bubble screen where there are 3 receivers bunched together to one side, and after the snap the ball is almost instantly thrown to the one farthest behind the line of scrimmage. Play-action The quarterback takes the snap and drops back to fake a handoff to the running back. The quarterback then rapidly pulls the ball back from the faked handoff, trying to hide it from the defense. The running back continues to move upfield as if he has the ball in his hands. The offensive line starts to run block, but then quickly goes into pass protection. The receivers appear to block at first, then go into their routes. On a play-action pass, which is essentially the opposite of the draw play, the quarterback hopes to fake the defenders into thinking the offense is going to run the ball. The effects of this play is to slow down the pass rush of the defense and it forces the defensive backs to make a decision between covering a receiver or coming up to help stop the run. Trick/Gadget plays Trick/Gadget plays are plays that are designed to appear to be one type of play while in reality is another. These plays typically will catch defenses off guard. Common examples of trick plays are the Half Back Pass or Razzle Dazzle (Where the running back will pretend to run the ball, but instead throws it to a receiver down field), the Flea flicker (The quarterback hands the ball off to the running back who in turns pitches it back to the quarterback who then throws it to a receiver down field), and the Hook and Ladder, also known as the Hook and Lateral (One receiver runs a hook route and upon catching the ball, laterals it to another teammate as he passes him running down the field). A notable example of a trick play is the touchdown pass to Hines Ward (Steelers) in Super Bowl XL. The Seahawks' Jon Ryan threw a touchdown to Garry Gilliam in the 2015 NFC Championship Game. Defensive plays Rush A pass rush (or, colloquially, 'pressure,' e.g., \\"Chicago really brought the pressure on that last play\\") occurs when the defense reads a pass play and elects to rush some combination of linemen (either 3 or 4 linemen in typical 3-4 or 4-3 schemes), in an effort to affect the pass that the opposing quarterback is attempting to complete. Perhaps the most obvious and tangible result of a successful pass rush is the sack, but even when the quarterback is not sacked, \\"hurries\\" and \\"knockdowns\\" are also important, as they also serve to disrupt in some manner the pass attempt. A \\"hurry\\" occurs when the quarterback is still able to make a throw, but is forced to throw before he would ideally like (e.g., before all of his receivers have completed running their routes). A \\"knockdown\\" occurs when the quarterback is still able to make a throw, but is knocked to the ground immediately upon making his throw because the rushing linemen were so close to him. Knockdowns and hurries can also serve to force the quarterback into making bad decisions, which could possibly result in interceptions for the defense. Stunts Stunts are a special means of rushing the quarterback done to confuse the opposing team's offensive line. Properly executing a stunt requires two or more defensive lineman working together. One defensive lineman will take an angled path towards an offensive lineman that he is not lined up across from. This will usually cause the offensive lineman he is lined up across from to follow him while also occupying the offensive lineman he angled towards. In turn, the defensive lineman who would have been blocked by the offensive lineman that is being angled to will loop behind his teammate and rush through the gap that was created by the offensive lineman who followed the defensive lineman taking the angle. E T G C G T W / \\\\\\\\ / / \\\\ DE |NT DL DE |______Blitz A blitz occurs when the defense sends non defensive-line personnel (either linebackers or defensive backs) to rush the quarterback. A blitz is an expansion upon the effective concept of the aforementioned pass rush. Coverages In attempting to halt the advancing of the football by the offensive team, the defensive team has many options. There are various formations that are commonly employed to defend against a passing attack. Man-to-man Man-to-man coverage is when every receiver is covered by a defensive back or linebacker. It is a coverage often used while blitzing because there are not enough players available to effectively execute zone coverage. Man-to-man coverage may be used while not blitzing by teams who have superior defensive backs or against teams with inferior receivers. :A \\"shut- down back\\" is a superior defensive back who does not need the assistance of another team-mate to cover a receiver. Football coaches value him because they may assign other tasks (for example, blitzing) to his team-mates. Zone Zone defense is when defensive players (typically defensive backs and linebackers) are responsible for a specific area on the field during pass coverage. Zones are usually more effective against long passes. When playing in a zone defense, a defensive player is able to observe what the quarterback is attempting to do, anticipate where a pass may be thrown, and perhaps intercept the pass. Zone defenses tend to produce interceptions of passes or outstanding collisions with receivers after they have made pass receptions.

It stands above sea levelOfficial Italian 1:25,000 mapping; other sources give slightly higher figures. and is located immediately to the east of the capital, San Marino. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008 under the combined title \\"San Marino Historic Centre and Mount Titano\\". Inscribed under reference no. 1245 criteria iii, the two together encompass an area of 55 ha with a buffer zone of 167 ha. It encompasses Mount Titano and the other structures such as the fortification towers, walls, gates and bastions, as well as a neo-classical basilica located on it and its slopes forming a small but unique urban conglomerate. Straddled on the ridge of Mount Titano is the city of San Marino of the Republic of San Marino, the history of which dates from the early 4th century. According to the legend related to the Mount and its precincts, a small monastery existed on top of the Mount during the 8th century. The mountainous landscape provides excellent views of its surroundings, and its isolated location ensured the needed seclusion for San Marino to survive as a Republic over the past several centuries. Trivia The mountain has three peaks; on each is one of The Three Towers of San Marino. Saint Marinus is always represented with Mount Titano in his hands. Geography and environment Monte Titano is located in central San Marino (seen in maps in rough rectangular shape), to the southeast of the City of San Marino and to the north of the village of Murata, at a distance of from the Adriatic Coast. Monte Titano looks like a rugged limestone outcrop, located only 13 kilometres (a figure of 10 km is mentioned in another reference) from the Adriatic Sea on the Apennines. Although the highest point is 739 metres above sea level, the rocky outcrop is about 200 metres in height at most. From the top of Monte Titano views of the entire nation of San Marino and further afield can be viewed scenically. The mountain gives birth to several streams, including the San Marino River, which flows down its western slope through a broad valleyScottish geographical magazine, Volumes 39‚Äì40, Royal Scottish Geographical Society, (1923) and flows into the Marecchia River, through Marecchia Torello and into the Adriatic Sea away and the Cando River, born in Marano, which flows into the Adriatic coast between Rimini and Riccione Ausa. The terrain has fertile soils in Emilia Romagna plain and soft rolling hills in the Marche and Montefeltro region. The mountain dips into the calm Adriatic sea. During the Tertiary era, the area where San Marino lies was the sea. Violent earthquakes caused major upheavals in the Earth's surface. Because of these intensive earthquakes, a mass of rock situated about from the mountain, was lifted and slid slowly toward the Adriatic Sea. This mass of rock gave rise to various mountains, including Mount Titano. The vertebrate fossils found on the slopes of Mount Titano are mostly aquatic in origin, because of the fact this rock was once located underneath the sea in its current spot. Fossils of various fish, especially the fossils of shark teeth have been discovered on Monte Titano, with many dated to the Miocene period. The most important fossil discovery is that of a whale, which is now preserved in the Bologna Archaeological Museum. The precincts of Monte Titano and the San Marino city experiences mild temperate climate; the maximum temperatures reported is of 79 ¬∞F (26 ¬∞C) in summer while the minimum is 19 ¬∞F (‚àí7 ¬∞C) in winter. Annual precipitation varies from about 22 inches (560 mm) to 32 inches (800 mm). Flora and fauna Set in the Mediterranean zone the vegetation is typical influenced by elevation variations. Numerous trees inhabit the mountain, including chestnuts, oaks, laburnum, cypress, fir trees and some shrubs and asparagus, typical of the driest areas, such as the territory in the Three Towers of San Marino vicinity. On the cliffs of Mount Titano is also found Ephedra Nebrodensis, a plant typical of Sicily and Sardinia. Wildlife is represented by all classes of vertebrates and, given the characteristics of the mountainous territory, birds and mammals are the most common animals. In relation to birds, several can be mentioned such as the kestrel, barn owl, owl, tawny owl, the magpie and buzzards. Common animal life includes roe deer, wild boar, deer, weasels, marten, porcupine, hare, hedgehogs, polecats, badgers and foxes. Protected area Since 2008, Monte Titano was allocated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in tandem with the historic centre of San Marino. The reason given by the Committee refers to \\"witnessing the continuity of a free republic since Middle Ages. \\" This heritage site include the towers, walls, gates and bastions of the City of San Marino, the Basilica di San Marino of the nineteenth century, some convents of the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, the eighteenth century Teatro Titano Theatre and the Palazzo Pubblico of the nineteenth century. Culture The layout of the Mount Titano presents three peaks, each crowned by ancient towers named Guaita, Cesta and Montale, with triple fortifications that enclose the capital city. Each tower, in turn, has a metal vane fixed on it which is in the shape of an ostrich plume, (\\"perhaps a pun on the Italian penne, meaning \\"plumes\\") which is attributed to the name of the mountains. Those three towers are represented in the coat of arms in the central part of the National Flag (horizontal white and blue) of the country (which has a width to length ratio of 3 to 4). The capital city is set on the western side of Mount Titano. An urban network of roads links the fortresses.

Cows and horse-drawn carriage in foreground It was in the commote of Ystumanner or Ystum Anner that Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn did homage and swore fealty to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd on 12 December 1263. In return he was made a vassal lord and the lands taken from him about six years earlier were restored to him. The commote was in the cantref of Meirionnydd. From the late medieval period until the twentieth century, Ynysymaengwyn, situated roughly a mile from Tywyn by the road to Bryn-crug, was by far the most powerful estate in the parish. The family's wealth is revealed in official records and also in the Welsh poetry composed to its leading members. The estate may be traced back to the days of Gruffudd ab Adda of D√¥l-goch and Ynysymaengwyn, bailiff of the commote of Ystumanner in 1330 and 1334, whose effegy is thought to lie in St Cadfan's church in Tywyn.For the early histpry of the estate, see Jones, J. Gwynfor. 2001. Government and Society 1536‚Äì1603. In: J. Beverley Smith & Llinos Beverley Smith (eds). History of Merioneth, vol. ii: The Middle Ages, Cardiff: University of Wales Press. , p. 655. His daughter Nest married Llywelyn ap Cynwrig ab Osbwrn Wyddel, and Ynysymaengwyn was to remain in the hands of their direct male descendants for well over two centuries. Llywelyn's great-great-grandson Siencyn (or Jenkin) ab Iorwerth ab Einion ap Gruffudd ap Llywelyn farmed Crown lands in Cyfyng and Caethle as well as the Aberdyfi ferry in the middle of the fifteenth century. Siencyn's son Hywel married Mary the daughter of Sir Roger Kynaston (c.1433 - 1495). Hywel died of the plague in 1494, an event which inspired a memorable elegy by Hywel Rheinallt. He was followed by his son Hwmffre (or Humphrey) who was the subject of a famous request by the poet Tudur Aled to bring to an end a bitter family dispute. This poem has been described as 'one of the great poems of late medieval Wales'.Williams, Gruffydd Aled. 2001. The literary tradition to c. 1560. In: J. Beverley Smith & Llinos Beverley Smith (eds).

Indeed, for some three centuries from the fifteenth century onwards, numerous Welsh poets were welcomed to Ynysymaengwyn and also to several of the most significant houses of Tywyn parish, most of whom were linked by blood or marriage to Ynysymaengwyn. Amongst these were Caethle, Dolau-gwyn, Gwyddgwion, Plas-yn-y-rofft (Esgairweddan), and Trefeddian. 'Sir' Arthur ap Huw (sometimes known as Arthur Hughes), a grandson of Hywel ap Siencyn of Ynysymaengwyn, was vicar of St Cadfan's church in Tywyn between 1555 and his death in 1570, and was also a notable patron of Welsh poets.Fychan, Cledwyn. 1979. Canu i w≈∑r eglwysig gorllewin Sir Ddinbych. Transactions of the Denbighshire Historical Society, 28, p. 120. He is also known for his translation into Welsh of George Marshall's counter-Reformation text A Compendious Treatise in Metre (1554).Bowen, Geraint. 1956. Arthur ap Huw. National Library of Wales Journal, 9.3, p. 376. 'Sir' Arthur's nephew David Johns (sometimes known as David Jones or David ap John, fl. 1572-98) was another important figure in the Welsh Renaissance.Roberts, Brynley F. 2004. ‚ÄòJohns , David (fl. 1572‚Äì1598)‚Äô. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 18 Feb 2012. A great-grandson of Hywel ap Siencyn, he copied an important manuscript of cywyddau (British Library Additional MS 14866) which includes several poems to the Ynysymaengwyn family (amongst them the poem by Tudur Aled mentioned above). Hwmffre (or Humphrey) ap Hywel ap Siencyn of Ynysymaengwyn died in 1545 and was followed by his son John Wynn.For an outline of the history of the families of Ynysymaengwyn in this period, see Davies, William Llewelyn. 'Wynn, Pryse and Corbet families, Ynysmaengwyn', Dictionary of Welsh Biography On-line. He was followed by his son Humphrey Wynn. Upon his death, the estate passed to his daughter Elizabeth and her husband Sir James Pryse of Gogerddan, Cardiganshire, who both died in 1642. The failure to produce a male heir would prove to be the norm for the family from this point onwards.  The Corbet family  Ynysymaengwyn was inherited by Sir James and Elizabeth's daughter Bridget who married Robert Corbet (d. 1644), the third son of Sir Vincent Corbet of Moreton Corbet. Robert Corbet was a Royalist during the English Civil War, during which Ynysymaengwyn was burnt to the ground to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Parliamentarians. Robert was followed by his son Vincent Corbet, who was followed by his son, another Vincent. On this Vincent's death in 1723, Ynysymaengwyn passed to his daughter Anne (d. 1760) who married Athelstan Owen (1676-1731) of Rhiwsaeson, Llanbryn-mair. Corbet Owen, the eldest son, died without issue in 1750, following which the Rhiwsaeson estate was sold. His mother then settled Ynysymaengwyn on her second son Richard. He also died childless, so the estate passed to her daughter Anne (d. 1767), who had married Pryce Maurice of Lloran, Llansilin in 1740. In accordance with the wishes of Anne Owen (n√©e Corbet), the estate then passed to the third son of Pryce and Anne Maurice, Henry Arthur Maurice. As required by the terms of the inheritance, he assumed the name of Corbet, but died at the age of 30 in 1782. He was succeeded by his eldest brother Edward, who also took the name Corbet. He spent several eventful decades as the squire of Ynysymaengwyn before dying in London in 1820.Thomas, Henry. 1962. Edward Corbet, Ynysymaengwyn: an Eccentric Country Squire. Journal of the Merioneth Historical and Record Society, 4.2, pp. 140-45. He left a daughter Eleanor (d. 1826), who married Thomas Powell (1745‚Äì97) of Nanteos, but his sons were illegitimate. The estate was inherited by his nephew Athelstan Maurice (who became Athelstan Corbet on inheritance), the son of his brother Pryce, who was rector of Llangelynnin and vicar of Tywyn from 1785 until his death in 1803. Athelstan Corbet (d. 1835) left no male heirs. His sister Henrietta Maurice married Charles Decimus Williames of Berth-ddu, Llandinam, and it was their daughter Henrietta Corbet Williames and her husband John Soden (later John Soden Corbet, d. 1871) of Bath who inherited Ynysymaengwyn. Their son Athelstan John Soden Corbet (formerly Athelstan John Soden Soden), heavily in debt, decided to sell the estate, and died young in 1878. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Corbet family of Ynysymaengwyn played a leading role in the Tywyn area. They were still patrons of Welsh culture in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Welsh poems to the family were added to David John's manuscript (see above) during the first part of the eighteenth century, when it was in the possession of the Reverend Edward Morgan.Owen, Bob, 1962. Cipolwg ar Ynysmaengwyn. Journal of the Merioneth Historical and Record Society, 4.2, pp. 97-118. Morgan (d. 1749), a native of Llangelynnin and the brother of John Morgan, was vicar of St Cadfan's from 1717 and is also the subject of poems in David Johns' manuscript. The Corbets were responsible for draining much of the morfa or salt marsh between the town and the Dysynni river, which greatly increased the land available for farming in that part of the parish. The estate was also famous for its gardens. The raven was the Corbet family emblem (the name 'Corbet' is thought to come from the Norman French for 'raven') and the bird is still used on the Tywyn town crest. The current Corbett Arms Hotel was formerly known as The Raven. One notable landlord was Griffith Owen (1750‚Äì1833), who had been both butler and harpist to the Corbets. A portrait of him by Benjamin Marshall (1768‚Äì1835) was formerly to be seen at Ynysymaengwyn.  John Corbett (1817-1901)  Ynysymaengwyn was bought by John Corbett of Chateau Impney, Droitwich in 1878.On Corbett, see Middlemass, Barbara & Hunt, Joe. 1985. John Corbett: Pillar of Salt, 1817-1901. Droitwich: Saltway Press. . He was not related to the previous Corbet family, but the thought of moving to an area whose residents were long accustomed to tugging a forelock at the mention of the name certainly appealed to him. Although not a permanent resident, Corbett spent long periods and even more money in Tywyn, and some of the town's key features are the product of his investments. He developed the water and sewerage system and also constructed the promenade at a cost of some ¬£30,000. He gave land and money for the Market Hall, built to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. It was his money that enabled Brynarfor (formerly a private school) to be opened as 'Towyn Intermediate School' in 1894. He rebuilt the Corbett Arms Hotel (from then on spelled with two 't's), and also contributed to the Assembly Room (1893), now Tywyn Cinema. Plaques commemorating his generosity may still be seen on the north end of the promenade and on the Market Hall. Another commemorative plaque was on Brynarfor (now demolished), and his portrait was hung there when the school first opened. Despite the fact that his involvement transformed Tywyn, he was not much loved, and upon his death on 22 April 1901, the Cambrian News noted that \\"he had more than the usual reserve of the Englishman\\".  Later years  John Corbett became legally separated from his wife Anna Eliza (n√©e O'Meara) in 1884, and a court order prevented her from living within 40 miles of Corbett's homes. Upon his death in 1901 the estate went to his brother Dr Thomas Corbett. It was only on Thomas's death in 1906 that Ann Corbett (d. 1914) was able to return to a warm welcome from the local people, as her son Roger John Corbett (1863‚Äì1942) took over the estate. Following Roger's death his sister Mary (d. 1951) eventually gave the estate to the council. The council was unable to fund the necessary repairs, and the house was used for firefighting practice and army training and soon had to be demolished. A dovecote built by Ann Owen (d. 1760) still survives, and Ynysymaengwyn is now a Trust run by trustees (Tywyn town councillors) with part of the land used as a caravan and camping park.  Archives  The most important collection of documents relating to the estate is found in the National Library of Wales amongst the Peniarth Estate Records. Also at the National Library are the Ynysymaengwyn Estate Miscellaneous Papers which relate to the early part of the twentieth century. Some nineteenth-century papers are held in the Meirionnydd Record Office of Gwynedd Archives (The Ynysymaengwyn Estate Papers). A survey of the estate completed by Richard Owen in 1776 is also in the National Library of Wales, as are numerous portraits of family members.

It forms part of the civil parish of Blacktoft and a very small part of the civil parish of Laxton. It is situated on the north bank of the River Ouse, downstream from York, Selby and Goole. Yokefleet is approximately south-east from Howden and south-east from the county town of York. Yokefleet lies within the Parliamentary constituency of Haltemprice and Howden an area that mainly consists of middle class suburbs, towns and villages. The area is affluent, placed as the 10th most affluent in the country in a Barclays Private Clients survey, and has one of the highest proportions of owner-occupiers in the country. Yokefleet Hall is a Grade II listed mansion house of Victorian design by architect Cuthbert Brodrick. The hall is on the eastern edge of the hamlet and the current house was built between 1868 and 1874 according to the York Georgian Society. History In 1823 Yokefleet had a population of 199, which included a yeoman farmer, a corn miller, and a cattle dealer. It contained a windmill which served \\"as a mark for sailors to navigate the river.\\"Baines, Edward; History, Directory & Gazetteer of the County of York 1823, volume 2, p.402. Retrieved 4 July 2014 By 1831 Yokefleet population had dropped to 190, within a parish area of which included ecclesiastical land and Walling Fen. The land mainly belonged to the Empson family who were impropriators--lay persons as patrons of incumbent clergy. There was a Wesleyan chapel. Occupations by this time included seven farmers, a school teacher for the local school, a corn miller, tailor, and two shoemakers, one of whom was a shopkeeper. A descendant of the Empson family, born at Yokefleet Hall, was literary critic and poet Sir William Empson (1906 ‚Äì 1984).Dodsworth, Martin; \\"Empson of Yokefleet in The State of the Letters\\", The Sewanee Review, Vol. 93, No. 3, Summer, 1885Bradbrook M.

Retrieved 4 July 2014 In early December 2013 Yokefleet, among other regional settlements was subject to flooding due to a tidal surge on the Ouse the largest in 60 years. According to the Environment Agency, damage caused would have been worse had it not been for the flood defences in place across the region. A 2014 Flood Investigation Report from East Riding of Yorkshire Council recommended that affected property owners should \\"develop a personal flood plan\\". However, improved flood defences are likely to be introduced across the region, including the significant raising of the river bank in order to ensure such flooding does not reoccur. The Environment Agency expressed confidence in such flood defences being improved by the government in order to prevent further flooding in the Haltemprice and Howden constituency and across the East Riding of Yorkshire.

The series follows the travels and adventures of six teenagers, part of an organization called the Di-Gata Defenders. Their mission as heroes is to defend RaDos against evil factions. The series aired for two seasons. Creation In 2005, Nelvana Entertainment created a project called the Funpack. It was designed to allow creators to pitch and create 5 minute interstitials. At the time, Greg Collinson didn't plan on pitching anything for this project until a colleague of his discussed about it on a train ride. He spent two weeks creating the \\"bible\\" for his series idea, which was initially named Power Stone Warriors. In this bible, he planned out the prototype characters, factions, and the universe the series would take place in. He later meets with the executives at Nelvana and Greg pitches his bible to them. Pleased with the promise this series had, Greg Collinson was given the greenlight to produce this series with help from Ken Cuperus, a script writer. The series then launched September 16, 2006 under its new name - Di-Gata Defenders. Broadcast In 2018 Disney XD (Canada) began to broadcast reruns of the show. Prior to that, it had been available on Bell and Roger's KidSuite in 2016. History of RaDos The humans, or RaDosians, of this world came from another planet. The planet's inhabitants were mostly dark-skinned, white haired individuals with glowing blue eyes. However, these people were struck with a life-destroying Toten'Ka virus, which had spread across their planet and killed millions. A small team of RaDos Primes (the name of these original aliens) escaped from their planet on a starship. These original humans eventually crash landed in RaDos. The sun and atmosphere of RaDos began to take effect on their physical forms, turning them into the people of the current timeline. But in doing so, they eventually exiled the original inhabitants, the Mortigarians, a race of amphibious snake- like humanoids to live under the sea. The people that live in RaDos as of the current timeline are the descendants of these first RaDosians. Before the humans arrived in this world, mystical beings called the Primordials roamed the realm. Their bodies used mystical energies as their life force. As they died, their life force leeched into the rocks of Di-Gata Mountains. Humans soon crash landed on the planet, caused by a stowaway creature named the Wrath-norak and a virus from their dying planet. Under Rados' sun, man's skin colour soon changed. Man was then able to mine the enchanted rocks found in the mountains, but were only able to recover energy from eight of the eleven sigils. Many rocks were mined by man, then carved into dice-like Di-Gata stones, and these were then carved with the sigil their power contained. From this point onward, anyone who used these stones were called stone casters or stone-slingers. It was believed that the first people who used these stones of power were called the Chi'Brek Tribe. This tribe was also the first tribe to document the arrival of the human race onto the planet. There are currently ten known power forms in RaDos called Sigils. These sigils take up energy forms inside of Di-Gata Stones. But because the power of one sigil isn't as strong as the other, multiple sigils must be used, creating Henges. This creates a far greater concentration of power. However, some sigils do not need to be formed into henges, due to the extreme power that is contained within them (Vitus and Nostrum Vitae). The thirteen Power Sigils are: * Ogama - (Order) * Dako - (Chaos) * Yin - (Youth) * Yan - (Wisdom) * Altas - (Balance) * Nega - (Force) * Sum - (Peace) * Infinis - (Eternity) * Vitus - (Renewal) * Nostrum Vitae - (Life - Unconfirmed) * Ethos - (Stagnation) * Orn-Ra - (The First Sigil) * Mal-Ra - (The Last Sigil) \\"The beginning and the end, both portions of the whole, both parts of a cycle without end. See that they are the one and the same and achieve balance\\" Casters choose how many Sigils to use and their combination. A single Sigil was not very powerful on its own, but combining multiple Sigils often led to unpredictable and uncontrollable powers. Most casters choose to specialize in only one or two sigils, to make sure they retain complete control of their power at all times. Otherwise, miscasting (where the forming of the Henge doesn't perform correctly) would become common and hazardous to both the caster or their allies. In short, these stones contain great power. However, some were not using it for the purposes for good. The Wizards of Yan, a powerful order of RaDos' most powerful wizards and stone-casters formed a group, the Di-Gata Defenders. These Defenders were trained to use these stones to police the realm against those who would use such power for evil purposes. But amongst their own ranks, a wizard named Nazmul wanted to keep all the power of the realm for himself. So he recruited powerful stone casters of his own and formed the Order of Infinis. Nazmul's goal was to achieve eternal life by any means necessary and establish his own rule in RaDos. As the Order continued to flourish, Nazmul managed to find a way to re-create a guardian called the Megalith using a large portion of the Realm's energy. This beast had unparalleled power and virtually made Nazmul invincible. The creation of the Megalith forced the Di- Gata Defenders of the previous generation to engage it. The Wizards of Yan came up with a ritual, the Spell of Binding to counter this unbeatable foe. They hired Brim, a stone-carver to create the four Pure Stones, which were the casting mediums for this spell. In the final battle, they used the Four Pure stones against the Megalith and sealed him within the Pure Stones using the Machine of Binding. However, the generation of Di-Gata Defenders made the ultimate sacrifice and also destroyed a portion of the land around the Machine. Nazmul's first body ends up being destroyed as well. Four of the five children of the original Defenders were then taken to a secret Dojo (Adam was the fifth child but was taken by Brackus after his parents died as revealed in the episode, \\"The Adam and Eve of Destruction\\"), to go for training to prepare for the day when the Megalith should break free from his seal. After sensing the Megalith was about to come forth, they left their Dojo behind and ventured forth into the realm, to continue where their parents left behind - to seal the Megalith once more and stop anyone who dares to relive their horrifying incident. However, they do succeed in stopping the Megalith, and crush the Order. Instead of sealing the Megalith as they first planned, they destroyed it with their combined efforts. For if they had proceeded with the seal, it would have brought forth the apocalypse of RaDos. The sealing was meant to be a cycle, to not only keep the Megalith imprisoned but also to keep the Di-Gata vampires known as the Ethos in check. The Ethos want one thing: to merge their world with RaDos, so they can have an unlimited supply of Di-gata energy, which when depleted, could very well bring the end of life to the entire realm. Now with the assistance of Rion, the six Defenders must now stop this ancient evil, as recompense for breaking the cycle and to save RaDos. Eventually they discover a machine called the Celestial Abyss created by Filch to keep the Ethos out of Rados. They set out to find it only to discover that the wizards have scattered different pieces of it all over Rados. They find all of the pieces except for one, which is with Filch and Malco. Malco steals the rest of the pieces and Filch builds the machine. This unleashes the Ethos who reveal that Malco is possessed by one of them and they destroy him. The Defenders also receive a terrible blow as Rion gives in to his Ethonosian half. Adam turns him human just before the life force is sucked out of him and the others. Rion unleashes his anger and remorse by transforming the Celestial Abyss into his armour and defeating the Ethos after which Rados and her people go back to normal.  Provinces of Rados  Ogama-Gor: :Constantly at war with the tribes of Dakor, Ogama-Gor is the most unified, organized and urbanized of all the eight provinces. Made up of dozens of feudal-style city states, Ogama- Gor is ruled by a confederacy called the Omegar. Heavily militarized and xenophobic, Ogamans are naturally distrustful of all the other Sigils and provinces except for Infinor, with whom they have a shaky alliance. :Ogaman military decisions are made on behalf of the civilian government by a council of generals called the Ogamarat. Even though the vast majority of the rank and file Ogaman military are levies and conscripts, the core of Ogaman military structure is the \\"Knights of Ogama-gor\\", a hereditary class of men and women who serve as a reservoir of military knowledge. Dakor: :Mountainous and cold, Dakor is the home of the hearty Dakorian tribes. These tribes are in an almost constant state of war with each other and with their neighbours. Dakorians are very fraternal and bond together in closely knit familial tribes. Even within the tribe, conflict and challenge of authority is looked upon highly, and tribes form Di-Gorums to make decisions. Di-Gorums are essentially assemblies of a representative from each household getting together around an Obelisk and shouting at one another. As people agree with each other, they try to push one of their number to the top of the Obelisk while knocking opponents off. The first person to the top of the Obelisk makes the decision for the tribe. :Needless to say, Dakorian development is erratic and their forays into Ogaman territory to raid and pillage are constantly breaking down into petty squabbling and chaos. Nega-La: :The least populated of the provinces, Nega-La is mainly arid desert and wetlands with the exception of the Binn Yati mountains. Communities in Nega-La are nomadic by nature, and many ply the trade routes that run to the oasis of Maudata in the south, trading in Dakorian Stone, Yantos mystical-technology, and Sumos wood. Actual urban centers are scarce, the largest being the trade capital of Maudata which surrounds the Oasis of NegLa. Maudatan stone carving is highly respected and sought after. Some of the most rare and legendary stones in Rados are carved in Maudata. :The Binn-Yati Mountains are unusual in that they house the Monks of NegLa, who legend says traveled from Maudata in the time before the Wizards and settled on Mount Yati to \\"watch over the Realm.\\" Unlike the Gata-shin monks, the monks of Negla keep to themselves and do not tamper in the affairs of the world. Many pilgrims make the treacherous trek to the Monastery of Mount Yati to study with the Monks and learn the way of the sigils. Yantos: :The most mystical of all the provinces, Yantos is the seat of the Gata-shin monks. Closely allied to the Wizards of Yan and the Di-Gata Defenders, the Gata-shin monks are all that remains of the structure of that old regime. Yantos is punctuated by towns built around various Monasteries who provide spiritual and physical protection. As a result, Yantos has become the reservoir of knowledge and wizard power in the Realm. :The North Veltlands are where the great herds of Yan-on graze, shepherded over by the Yantan herdsmen. Raids by Dakorian tribesmen are regular, but the natural barrier of Lake Di- Gata, Yi-maki and the Bridge of Yan prevent many of them from doing any lasting damage. Sumos: :Sumos is a wild overgrown wilderness of ancient ruins and temples to long lost Sigils. Home to bandits and brigands, there are no known settlements in this area. This is exactly the reason that the monks decided to place the infant defenders in this province, hiding them away from prying eyes until they were ready to reshape the realm. :Of the many dangers that lurk in the woods of Sumos, the Rock Serpents are by far the most lethal. Very territorial, a rock serpent that feels threatened can level many Yantars of woods in an attempt to destroy its perceived challenger. The Serpents originate from the Ban-Gafi Rift and few travel near here. Altamor: :Also known as the ghost province, Altamar used to be almost completely covered by the wizard city of Altamar. Completely destroyed by the Spell of Binding, all that remains of a once beautiful and mystical city is a series of blackened, burnt earth and smoking, charred craters. Some burnt ruins remain to testify to the grandeur and beauty of Altamar, but in essence all that remains is a wasteland. Only the truly desperate or insane spend any time in Altamor as it is widely seen as haunted. :When the Spell of Binding was cast, four great rifts in the earth spread out from the center of Altamor and now serve as great breaks that divide families and tribes. Infinor: :Seat of the ancient Bakkorian kingdom, Infinor‚Äôs geography is defined by the Rift of Yiman, which divides the province into Bakkor in the north and Nord-Binn in the south. Bakkor is the home of the dreaded thieves' guild, which controls much of the Black Vine forest and blighted swamp. In Northern Bakkor, many towns on the bay of Tantar thrive trading with Ogaman towns, despite the constant threat of large scale thieving and protection rackets. :Nord-Binn is mainly made up of farming and herding of the plentiful Yin-on, a close relative of the Yan-on. Direction and guidance is provided by the Elders of Arboth, a mining town in the Binn-ar woods that digs out the most precious and rare stone in the realm. It is said that the stone for the pure stones came directly from Arboth. Attack stones carved from Arbothian stone help defend the Binn-yama bridge from thief incursions. Yin-tos: :Yin-Tos is a very militarized and technologically advanced state like Ogama-Gor, but it lacks the maturity and tradition that the Ogaman military states have. Yin-tos armies are led by a warlord (Brackus currently) who has absolute and dictatorial power. Yin-tos military structure is based on who is the most brutal, ambitious, and cut- throat person amongst them all. The geography of this province closely reflects the nature of its people, made up of mainly barren rock and rotten forests; the land is hard, unyielding and cruel. A large ridge called The Barrier defines the boundaries of Yin-tos; it is said that the ridge is the remains of a once palatial string of fortresses that Yin-tos used to dominate the Realm beyond. :Yintos is despised by the rest of the provinces because of its history of brutality and authoritarian use of power. Before the Wizards of Yan and the Di-Gata defenders reordered the Realm, Yintos held sway through draconian laws and brutal use of military power. When it was defeated by the defenders, Yintos went into a period of almost self-imposed exile from the Realm. When Nazmul betrayed the wizards, he found a very compliant conspirator in Yin-tos and their warlord Brackus. The armies of Yintos marched on Altamar and were all but destroyed in the conflagration of the Spell of Binding. Now rebuilt at great expense to the civilian population, the Yin-tos Armies and war machines are ready to once again claim their former glory. They were known to use carborad tanks. Extending to the east of the province of Yin-Tos is a large expanse known as the 'Blasted Flats.' Essentially, it is a plain that seems to be made of glass and is uninhabitable. No one has ever traveled to the end of the Blasted Flats, but there is a legend that it was made by the ancient Bakkorians, presumably to keep something out of RaDos.  Episodes   Characters   Organizations  Order of Infinis - The Order of Infinis was formed by a corrupt Wizard of Yan, Nazmul, who sought power and eternal life. They were the main antagonists of Season 1. In the end, Nazmul was sealed away (eventually killed), Brackus was banished to the Dark Realm for high treason, and the Yin-Tos army was destroyed in a civil war at the Spell Zone. Flinch was believed to be the only surviving member of the Order, until Brackus was found out to still be alive and Flinch somehow managed to find Malco again. The duo made an alliance with the Ethos to free Nazmul. The high members of the Order were once allies of the Defenders and helped to defeat the Ethos. Ethos - Like the Order of Infinis, they are an organization with evil intentions. Long before the formation of the Order of Infinis, the Wizards of Yan imprisoned the Ethos in the Dark Realm, after the battle of Sum-Yan, using the Celestial Abyss. As part of their imprisonment, the Megalith was created as a result. When the Megalith was destroyed, it caused a force of energy powerful enough to release four Ethos back into Rados. Their plan is to merge both the Dark Realm and RaDos together, giving the Ethos what they desire: The Di-Gata energy they feed on, which will eliminate all life on the planet. They have made an alliance with the weakened Order of Infinis and have taken control over Malco. Wizards of Yan - The most powerful beings of Rados who hold enormous power. The Wizards were responsible for the creation of the Di-Gata Defenders to protect the Realm from evil. They were responsible for building the Machine of Binding, and the Celestial Abyss, as well as sealing away the Ethos and Megalith. Nowadays, they no longer exist except for a select few. Nazmul, Professor Alnar and Melosa including her grandmother are the only known Wizards. Rougon - The most hated hunters in all of the Realm. Rougon are human hunters and do anything for profit. Their base is located underwater, a perfect place for buying illegal items and other treasures. Their hideout was destroyed by the Defenders after the Yinicor was released from its prison. Di-Gata Defenders - The protectors of Rados formed by the Wizards of Yan to protect the realm and its people from those who would use its sigil energy for evil. However, many Defenders over the years were killed in the line of duty and some defected over to the Order of Infinis. The current Defenders are Seth, Melosa, Erik, Rion, Adam and Kara and other notable Defenders were Rayald (killed by Malco), Formally Malco and the current Defenders' parents. Yin-tos Army - They were once allies of to the Wizards of Yan against the Ethos in the Battle of Yan-Suma, then a subgroup of the Order of Infinis forces. These are mercenaries who are motivated by money and will go to any means to acquire it, but in the past were courageous warriors who fought to protect RaDos from evil. They swore allegiance to Brackus (both in the Wizard alliance and the Order of Infinis) and were under the sub-command of General Rube. After the collapse of the Order, some Yin-tos soldiers went to work for the Ethos. Gatashin Monks - The group of monks who carried out quite a few tasks involving the Pure Stones. Four monks each carried a Pure Stone and hid it away, and some took the young Defenders to the Dojo, with the exception of Adam. The Key was hidden in the Amos-Yan Monastery, and guarded by the monks. A sub-sect of these monks also operate the Gatashin Prison, used to contain criminals that use RaDos' power for evil. The Zad - A race of humanoid ant-eaters. They serve and carry out the will of Ethos. (See characters) Yan-Nega class Wizards - They are wizards from the time of the Ethos. Kor Yin-an, a Yan-Nega class wizard who was with the Wizards at the Battle of Yan-Suma, wanted to betray them so he could plead for his life, but found himself locked up in a tomb for his betrayal. Ogaman Federation - A group that Aaron the Hunter served with. They were formerly in possession of the Tome of Al-mortigar.  RaDos sorcery   Games  There were four online games available for the show: #Di-Gata Sigil Shooter #DiGata Defenders: Invasion of Infinis #Power Stone Combat #Di-Gata Battle Training The ATV and Battle games were also available on Teletoon.com while the show was airing. In Di-Gata Online, they have four provinces unlocked, each containing a quest and re-playable mini-game after finishing the quest for that province. The battle arena is currently playable, but it has some bugs in it. Di-Gata.com also released a battle training game based on the trading cards and stones game. It had four quests open and cost $15 CDN to get involved. There was also a game produced for the Nintendo DS.  Stones  Di- Gata Stones draw upon the mystic energy that simmers below the surface of the realm, and unleash it in the form of pure power. Each warrior has a different arsenal of Di-Gata stones. In battle, a warrior must choose how to use his stones to maximum effect, analyzing and opponent's strengths and weaknesses and deciding when to unleash their most powerful attacks. There are nine types of stones, each having a different role of a Di-Gata battle. * Shield Stones (Common) - These defensive stones are used to protect the caster from an opponents attack. The caster must choose wisely how many shield stones to use in a battle. The more shield energy used, the less powerful you will be in attack. * Guardian Stones (Rare) - These stones are home to powerful creatures known as GUARDIANS. Each guardian has different attack and defensive powers. The Guardians vary in size and strength, but even the least powerful among them are a valuable asset to any duel. * Warrior Stones (Rare) - A Warrior Stone exudes energy in many different forms, from an explosive fireball, to a high-voltage bolt of lightning. In battle, warrior stones are combined with booster stones for an additional burst of power. * Booster Stones (Common) - These stones are used to enhance and strengthen the effect of the Warrior Stone. More booster stones added to a cast will result in more powerful attacks but will also increase the chance of a miscast. Only the most experienced casters tend to use more than one or two booster stones at a time. * Champion (Henge) Stones (Ultra Rare) - These enormously powerful stones are extremely hard to come by, and with good reason. Because they already contain the combined Sigil known as a henge, they never fail when cast. The energy levels of the henge stones are also much greater than those of traditional power stones, making them a dangerous addition to any casters arsenal. * Aqua Stones (Rare) - These stones are the only way a caster can cast spells out at sea or in large bodies of water. Since the above stones, except Guardians need physical land to draw on power to cast spells. These stones are made from enchanted rocks from a seabed and draw on trace amounts of power found in water to attack foes. Most spells involve using water manipulation, the manipulation of water. The Defenders and Brackus have some, but they only use them for 4 reasons: : Overcomes one of their weaknesses, they can't swim. : If they need to return to the surface with their sigil stormers. : Survive underwater with no fear of water pressure and oxygen loss. : Manipulate water to attack or imprison foes. * Pure Stones (Only Four) - The four Di-Gata stones used to bind the Megalith. These stones are necessary to complete the Spell of Binding for entire cycles at time. However, due to some freak accident in not casting the Spell of Binding, the Pure Stones were destroyed, allowing the Megalith and Ethos to escape from their prisons. There are only four engraved with the sigils: Dako, Yan, Yin and Ogama. * Nostrum Vitae Stone (Fabled) - First mentioned in \\"The Healer\\", Brackus uses the Sigil Stone called Nostrum Vitae to turn Abborantus into dust. He also uses its power to perform some of his healing miracles for the people or the Defenders. Nostrum Vitae is only used once when Brackus is a healer. Unless another defender uses it, Nostrum Vitae will not be used again. * Wizard Stone (Only Five) - Carved by Mel's grandmother, these stones were created to lead the user to an Icon by giving the a vision of the location. Mel had the first vision, Seth the second, Erik the third, and Rion the fourth. The stones were not used for the fifth icon as Rion had a dream to where it was instead of using the stone.  Power Sigils  There are currently ten known Power Sigils, each used to tap into a unique aspect of the realm's energy through dice-like Di-Gata Stones. Individually, each Sigil is capable of unleashing a burst of raw energy, but when used in combination with each other, the energy aspects blend together to form a Henge. Not only does this create a far greater concentration of power, it also allows access to other kinds of destructive or helpful powers. These sigils are also inscribed on various locations, objects, articles of clothing and sometimes as birthmarks or tattoos on the people's faces (like Brackus' Infinis tattoo on his forehead).To study the Sigils one must first realize that no sigil is evil and no sigil is good. The sigils transcend these moralistic notions, they represent parts of the whole and could never exist without their opposites. It is through the combination of Sigils that one creates true power, this is why pupils focus their study on two sigils, a single sigil is of limited value and power on its own. Ogama, the sigil of Order. To study Ogama is to seek control and order in all things, even in chaos. The Architect of creation, born out of chaos, Ogama's sphere of influence covers meanings from authoritarian to tranquil control. Studying Ogama allows the person to see that even in times of chaos and turmoil, there is still some hope to see order or control. The Sigil: Ogama consists of an arch with two small bars and a bar struck through at the top. The arch represents the containment of something and the two small bars jutting out from the arch to give it a firm footing. The bar at the apex of the arch signifies the single power controlling all that is encompassed by the arch. As a warrior sigil, Ogama's side points and the one atop its arc are used (Erik's Singeing Spar). As a booster, Ogama is either connected to the base sigil using the top bar on the arc (The Yan-Ogama henge on Si'i's stomach), or used as a separate sigil (Erik's Generator and Constructor). Used by: Erik (Ogama and Infinis), Doku, and Bo (inexperienced) (Dako and Ogama). Guardians: Robutus (Ogama), Lockdown (Ogama-Infinis), Voltantis (Ogama-Yin), and Si'i (Ogama-Yan). Opposite Sigil: Dako Infinis, the sigil of Eternity. To study Infinis is to learn and understand the universes‚Äô constant circle of life. The orb of life, Infinis‚Äô sphere of influence covers meanings from greatness to fate. To study Infinis is to learn to see the continuity and connectivity of all things. The Sigil: Infinis consists of a winding path with two protruding bars. This represents the fact that all paths lead to the endlessly cyclical nature of creation. As a warrior sigil, Infinis usually uses the two sides points (Brackus' Blazing Fires of Dako), but can have another sigil strike through it (The Megalith's Henge). As a booster, it can attach itself to complete a sigil (Erik's Forge Fire), or replace a certain part of a sigil (Dreadcrow's henge). Used by: Erik (Ogama and Infinis), Adam (Yin, Yan, and Infinis), Brackus (Dako and Infinis), Flinch, and a nameless warlord (Yin and Infinis). Guardians: Firefox (Infinis), Anaconduit (Nega-Infinis), Dreadcrow (Infinis-Yin), Darkviper (Nega-Infinis-Yin), Lockdown (Ogama-Infinis), and the Megalith (Altas-Infinis). Opposite Sigil: Altas Yin, the sigil of Youth. To study Yin is to see the Realm through fresh eyes everyday and to overturn the past in favour of the new. Energy of the Realm, Yin's sphere of influence covers meanings from inexperience to boundless enthusiasm. The Sigil: Yin is composed of a split bar with another smaller bar driven through it. This represents the sapling growing, reaching its searching tendrils out above the ground. Another amusing interpretation put forward by Disciples of Yan is that Yin represents a man turned on its head, feet in the air peddling madly. As a warrior, Yin either has the top two points used (Malco's Concentration of Yin), or anything below the horizontal line (Rion's Argent Razor), depending on the sigil. As a booster, Yin has the tendency to use its top two points to replace a line with only one (Kara's Tornado, Rion's Argent Wildfire, Malco's Meteor). Used by: Kara (Yin and Altas), Rion (Yin and Nega), Adam (Yin, Yan, and Infinis), Flinch, a nameless warlord (Yin and Infinis), Malco (Yin and Dako), Snare (Yin and Sum), and Kid Cole (Yin, Nega, and Dako). Guardians: V-Moth (Yin), Vehemoth (Yin), Dreadcrow (Yin-Infinis), Darkviper (Nega- Infinis-Yin), Protozoa (Yin-Yan), and Voltanis (Ogama-Yin). Opposite Sigil: Yan Yan, the sigil of Wisdom. To study Yan is to seek the wisdom of the ancients and knowledge from the past. Father of all, Yan's sphere of influence covers meanings from enlightenment to caution. The Sigil: Yan is composed of a twice bent bar struck through by a large bar. This represents the past and the present unchanging and the knowledge and wisdom that comes from age. As a warrior, Yan either has the vertical line replaced (Arvengus' henge) or the north and south ends are in use (Adam's Power of the Guild). As a booster, Yan will be either on top of the base sigil (The Yan-Dako henge), or even inside it (Melosa's Breath of Zephyr). Used by: Mel (Yan and Sum) and Adam (Yin, Yan, and Infinis). Guardians: Draykor (Yan), Arvengus (Nega-Yan), Protozoa (Yin- Yan), and Si'i (Ogama-Yan). Opposite Sigil: Yin Nega, the sigil of Force. To study Nega is to learn that destruction and severance are roads to greater things. The hammer of creation, Nega's sphere of influence covers meanings from barbarity to potency. The Sigil: Nega is composed of a lightning bolt struck through by a bar. This bar is called \\"The Handle of Force\\". This represents destructive power that is controlled by an overseeing force. No force is random, no force is meaningless, force always has direction. As a warrior, Nega's top bar is always used (Anaconduit/Darkviper's henge). As a booster, when there's just one, it either replaces horizontal lines (Rion's Oppressor), or cuts through the sigil (The Nova Henge). When there's more than one, Nega acts more as extensions (Rion's Guise of Pearl) or replacements (Seth's Twisting Chaos). Used by: Seth (Dako and Nega), Rion (Yin and Nega), and Kid Cole (Dako, Nega, and Yin). Guardians: Anaconduit (Nega-Infinis), Darkviper (Nega-Infinis-Yin), Arvengus (Nega-Yan), Tormentor (Dako-Nega), Stinger (Nega). Opposite Sigil: Sum Dako, the sigil of Chaos. To study Dako is to accept and embrace change. Mother of all creation, Dako's sphere of influence covers meanings from complete anarchy to disarray. To study Dako is to ride the wanton breeze of change, to feel its ebb and flow. The Sigil: Dako is composed of an orbit struck through by a broad bar. This represents the broken path, the shattered cycle that is Dako. As a warrior, Dako's vertical line is the key. As a booster, when there's just one, it either sits underneath the warrior sigil (Dark Malco's Black Torpedo) or on top of the sigil (Doku's Blistering Diablo). When there's more than one, it either adds on to the main sigil (Seth's Nega Mass) or replaces a part of it (Malco's Swarm of Locusts). Used by: Seth (Dako and Nega), Doku, Bo (Dako and Ogama), Kali (Dako and Altas), Kid Cole (Dako, Nega, and Yin), Finn (Dako and Sum), Malco/Dark Malco (Dako and Yin), Brackus (Dako and Infinis), and The Zads (Dako and Ethos). Guardians: Kragus (Dako), Omnikragg (Dako-Altas), Revoldenn (Dako-Sum), Tormentor (Dako-Nega), Taurius (Dako). Opposite Sigil: Ogama Sum, the sigil of Peace. To study Sum is to seek inner peace and to know the undying nature of the Realms energy. The reflecting pool of creation, Sum's sphere of influence covers meanings from harmony to stagnation. To study Sum is to know the undying nature of the Realms energy and the rebirth of all. The Sigil: Sum is composed of two spheres, one inside the other, attached by two bars. This represents the peace within. Some claim that the symbol is representative of the child in the womb but there is nothing to substantiate this. As a warrior, Sum tends to have sigils on top, underneath it, and/or inside it (Melosa's Crystal Casket). As a booster, it does the same action except onto another sigil (Melosa's Snow Blast). Used by: Mel (Sum and Yan), Snare (Sum and Yin), and Finn (Sum and Dako). Guardians: Sliver (Sum), Revoldenn (Dako-Sum). Opposite Sigil: Nega Altas, the sigil of Balance. To study Altas is to know the center, to feel the balance of the sigils. The fulcrum, Altas‚Äô sphere of influence covers meanings from equality to stasis. The Sigil: Altas is composed of a sphere with four protruding bars. This represents the fact that all paths are connected and unchanging. As a warrior, Altas uses all four points to its advantage (Kara's Bolt of Altas). It is rarely used as a booster. Used by: Kara (Yin and Altas), and Kali (Dako and Altas). Guardians: Megalith (Infinis-Altas), Omniaxor (Altas), Omnikrag (Dako- Altas). Opposite Sigil: Infinis Vitus is the sigal of Renewal. It is a new sigil described in the episode Vitus. Seth had a Vitus stone carved by Brim, but it could only be used once. The stone was used on Melosa after she was taken over by the Megalith in 'One Down', its power then was to purge its presence from her. It is unknown whether Vitus will reappear elsewhere in the series. Created by a mysterious stone carver in the Kingdoms of Maligor, Vitus is a bit of a Legend in Rados. Few have seen it and even fewer have used its enigmatic power. Encompassing the powers of renewal (and death which is merely a stage of renewal), it is said the Vitus Sigil can bring the dead back to life and grow crops for thousands to eat. But as there is no recorded use of the sigil that can be confirmed, its power remains a mystery. There is a popular folk tale that claims the Amican Forest was create by a Vitus Stone cast by Kor Yin-an to create a magical retreat for the wizards of Yan, but there is nothing to substantiate this. The Ninth Sigil also has no known opposite like the other eight sigils which makes it a very unbalanced and combustible power. Theoretically it will only function once and then the stone will be consumed. The Vitus Sigil represents a spring of water, thrusting up through the two layers of the Realm; the physical and the metasigical. Used by: Seth (in the form of a champion stone) Guardians: None Ethos: This sigil was first introduced by Alnar when he explained to the Defenders about the coming of the Ethos. The Zad and some Ethos emissaries are the only beings in the series so far that use Ethos Stones. It can combine with other sigils to form attacks involving dark sorcery. Also dubbed the \\"Shadow Stone\\" by some people. it was confirmed by Greg Collinson to be called Ethos or Mortagor. Strangely, there has been no mention of what the opposite of Ethos is, although it is obvious there is one since it can be cast in stone form. As a warrior, Ethos uses the two bottom horizontal lines (The Zad's attack that resembles a missile). It has not yet been used as a booster. Used by: The Zads (Ethos and Dako) Guardians: none Opposite Sigil: Nostrum Vitae (Unconfirmed) Nostrum Vitae: When Brackus is a healer, he carries a stone around with another sigil on it. This sigil is confirmed to be called Nostrum Vitae, it was confirmed by Greg Collinson in the Di-Gata Forums. It was introduced in \\"The Healer\\". He uses it against Tormentor, causing him to turn to dust upon contact with its power. Like Ethos, there is no mention of the opposite of Nostrum Vitae, although it is assumed to have one, since the stone was used more than once (the first time being offscreen, to heal a baby; this was when the Defenders approached the tent with the Healer in it) Used by: The Healer (Brackus) Guardians: Nostrum Vitae Mask Opposite Sigil: Ethos (Unconfirmed) Orn-Ra and Mal-Ra: During the main theme for season 2, there are two instances when new sigils appear. The first is when Eric is seen with his welding equipment, working on a yellow-colored stone. The sigil itself looks like a miniature Dako with an X on top of it. This sigil has been confirmed to be either Mal-Ra or Orn-Ra. The second instance is when immediately after Eric is wearing a blue-violet colored cloak with the first stone. He then rotates to show a vermillion-colored stone in his hand. This sigil has been dubbed as the XT sigil and has been confirmed to be the opposite of the sigil mentioned above. Brim apparently knows of their existence and how to carve them, but has had that knowledge transferred to Erik, who is now a master carver.  Key technology  In the Realm, most technology is carved from stone, or metal and powered by Di-Gata Stones. The Key :Not necessarily a piece of technology, but still has properties to make it useful. It is a large blue stone engraved with Yan sigils all over it. It is a detector of great energies. If it senses an energy source nearby, it will react by glowing. As it glows brighter, the source is more closer. It is the only tool besides Mel's power that can find the approximate location where the Pure Stone is hiding. :The Defenders kept it after they defeated Malco in \\"The Key to Victory\\". However, they lost it when Signey forked it over to Flinch in exchange for the safe return of her mother. The Order of Infinis used The Key to track the Defender's movements after they collected the Dako Pure Stone. At one point, The Key was broken in half by Anaconduit and Kragus in their little tussle in \\"Doom Chase\\", the Key was then repaired one episode later. After the key was repaired, Brackus borrowed it to find the Defenders with Malco and Flinch in the sunken Monastery, thinking there would be a Pure Stone and Malco and Flinch may have known where one was. Brackus collects the Ogama Pure Stone in exchance for the return of Melosa. But when Malco and Flinch were going to finish off the Defenders, a sea monster entered the room and attacked them. It grabbed Flinch and tossed him into Brackus as he was leaving. Brackus held on to the Pure Stone, but lost the Key. Seth reclaimed it before they resurfaced from the monastery. :They didn't have the Key for long when they entered the \\"Den of Thieves\\". A man bumped into Erik and swiped it from him. Later, Snare manages to get a hold of it. But things get more strange when Adam is seen holding the Key in \\"The Returning\\" with the Nova Stone. He used it to find the Yin, Yan and Dako Pure Stones, hoping to find the Defenders. As of that point, the Defenders have held on to the key, even when Adam turned over the pure stones and Kara over to Brackus to \\"make things right\\". Erik's Gauntlet :Erik is the only character besides Flinch and Doku that uses a device to launch or activate stones. He describes it as a \\"remote energy manipulation gauntlet\\". His gauntlet can also do other functions like control Robotus, activate other machines, and bio-scans. In Ms. Fortune, it also gave him super strength by using its backup power to operate, however it released a discharge when held on for too long. After this episode ended, this power was inaccessible because the cells that stored this energy were diminished. :Erik added a new function he called the Backlasher. It was designed to absorb energy and redirect it back at its attacker. However, he had problems with the energy flow. Luckily, Von Faustien gave him a sigil flux crystal, which came in handy to contain the energies of an Annihilator stone. Yan-Altas Container : For the duration of the first season, the Container was a device designed to hold the Pure stones to shield them from being found by the Key. It is made from a rock called Ultimite, which has the power to absorb magical essences and prevent any energy emissions from occurring. The Defenders first got it from Brim. However, when they found the Dako Pure stone, and had confrontation with the Dakonauts, the Container was destroyed, enabling the Order of Infinis to track the Stones wherever they were. Erik was able to fashion a new container. When the Pure stones were destroyed and the Megalith released, Seth temporarily used the container as a shield for the Nova Stone, preventing it from sensing Nazmul within the stone. Sigil Stormer :The main transport for the current Defenders to travel around Rados. They are also known as \\"Bikes\\". It is fueled on Di-Gata stones. Each of the Defenders have one, and extra people hitch rides with them, but usually have their own helmets. The Stormers are capable of flight and have energy weapons for combat. Replicator Stone : In the Bang- yadi mountains, Flinch and Malco put together a machine that could created a limitless supply of squid-like Obelisk robots for the Order. However, Brackus ordered immediate mass production and the Replicator Stone had a power overload. As a result, its programming became self-aware and ordered all it Obelisk creations to destroy all of Rados. It was stopped when Flinch used his Cyclone, amplified by Erik's Generator. In doing so, it shut down the Replicator stone and most of the Obelisks (except one which appeared in \\"What Lies Beneath\\", where Seth kills it by ripping out its circuitry via his stone arm). The Machine of Binding :This machine was used to activate the power of the Pure Stones to seal the Megalith. However, it had no control over the outside damage the seal would cause. In \\"Dark Descent\\", the Defenders tried to reverse the polarity of the machine to draw the Pure stones to it, but they nearly destroyed the realm with a Negastorm. However, they managed to keep their Dako Pure Stone and get the Yan Pure Stone in the process. As of now, the Machine of Blinding is now useless, since the Megalith is destroyed and the Pure Stones as well. Even if they could use it again, it was also destroyed by Seth's inhuman strength, because the Spell of Blinding would have destroyed RaDos if it was successful. The Shift Stone :This device is both a timer and a key. Six of the eight sigils are engraved on each face of the stone, and rotate as time goes on. When all the sigils are aligned, the timer reaches 0 and Rados has an equinox. At this point, the device can be used as a key at the Shift Beacon to open a portal between the Dark Realm (where the Ethos reside) and RaDos itself. Large amounts of energies are required along with the Shift Stone to open larger portals or for people to get out of the Dark Realm and back to RaDos. The Defenders acquired this stone from one of the Zad and used it to open the portal to the Dark Realm to rescue Kara and stop the Ethos simultaneously. The Ethos who were currently in Rados fused the Shift stone to the Beacon but Erik was able to pry it out with his father's tools, barely managing to get it out before more Ethos entered Rados. Celestial Abyss :Fifty years before the show's current timeline, the Wizards of Yan were fighting the Ethos in the sieges of Yan-Suma. A superweapon created by Flinch, called the Celestial Abyss, was designed to banish the Ethos to the Dark Realm. However, due to Melosa's interference in the past, the device was frozen and in Ethos hands. It was recovered and a younger Brackus used the device to finish the Ethos. The Celestial Abyss was then broken up into five pieces that would later be known as the Five Icons. Each icon was hidden by a Wizard of Yan so no evil can ever re-assemble it and use it. They can be found in two ways: Either by using the orb of Ogama-Yan, or the five Tracker Stones that the Defenders currently have in their possession. The Ethos are using this weapon to re-open a portal to the Dark Realm, while the Defenders are trying to re-seal them. The Orb of Ogama-Yan is currently in possession of Kara who stole it from Malco's vault. The Defenders now have all but one Icon, which is yet to be found.Later Filch and Malco create the weapon which releases the Ethos after which Rion uses them to form his armour and succeeds in destroying the Ethos. The Guardianizer :It was a rifle-sized weapon, created and developed by Si'i. It had the power to absorb guardians into its mechanism, then release a mutant guardian, made up of both body and sigil parts of the original guardians used. However, the cost was these guardians were psychotic and couldn't distinguish allies from foes. It was used on the Defender's guardians when they was found out about Si'i's illegal operation (It was illegal in RaDos to distribute or sell Guardians unless you had some affiliation with the Gata-shin Monks or Wizards of Yan). The Guardianizer was later modified to have its effects reversed, saving the Defender's guardians from a permanent mutation. :It was later rebuilt by Flinch, into a form of a giant cannon mounted to a chain in the ground (it had the power of levitation). Dark Malco wanted to use it so he could turn Rion into a Guardian, which Si'i split the beans about how this process was done. It was able to turn Rion into a mutated and uncontrollable guardian, and it required Seth to do the same thing to control him (Seth had a spell cast on him by Melosa so he wouldn't become berserk himself). The cannon was eventually trashed by falling debris and Si'i fell into the lava pit with it, after Seth and Rion were turned back into their original forms. However, Si'i became its last victim and flew off. Dakonaut : Tall, levitating, one-eyed robots built for one purpose: to serve Nazmul. About twelve years ago, the Dakonauts were defeated by the Wizards of Yan, but it took a large portion of their order to be able to pull it off. Four of them were rebuilt years later and were sent out to seek the megalith energy inside of Melosa. At first, the Defenders believed they were after the Dako Pure Stone, but they were really after Melosa. Seth then used the Vitus stone against Melosa, which released the Megalith energy within her. The energy that rippled out of her caused the Dakonauts to be destroyed again. Seth's Mech arm : A robotic rock arm made by Erik so Seth could remain a Defender when he sacrificed his hand to Brackus. Erik wasn't finished stabilizing the Infimatter and had the power to influence Seth to work for Doku. Seth removes it after his hand was restored. He loses it again after he nearly destroyed Arboth with its awesome power. Seth later quits the Defenders for the inexplicable acts he committed. : After he returns to the Defenders, he gets another arm. At first it seems like your average metallic hand. But when it touches Seth's Di-Gata stones, it transforms into an arm-cannon, containing the stones within its mechanism. When it fires the stones, the spell is summoned and the hand reverts to a claw mechanism. The stones used are contained within it and Seth has control over the direction the spell is fired, allowing for improved accuracy and control in battles. Wizard Tower : Made after the Ethos war, these mighty castles were meant for the Wizards of Yan to reconnect with the sky. Nazmul's keep is an example. Though meant as a place of healing and knowledge, the Wizards installed a number of gun turrets just in case of attack. :An abandoned one by taken by Doku and his cohorts but they didn't have the necessary codes to operate it. Fortunately for them, Adam had the codes and inputted them one by one. Doku managed to copy the codes to take full control of the tower and sent it to Arboth to harvest its di-gata energy. Using a device called Regenesis, he regenerated his right hand and eye. His further plans were to travel beyond Rados but that required Di-Gata Defender energy. It just so happened that Seth, corrupted by his mech arm, was the perfect subject. But when Seth realizes what he had done, he reversed the energy flow, restoring Arboth and then smashed the Regenesis device, bringing the tower down to the ground.  Henge/Champion Stones  Phase Stone : The Phase stone was owned by Adam and given to Melosa in \\"The Town that Time Forgot\\", as a parting gift. The spell on this stone is cast when tossed into an inanimate object or wall. As long as the spell is active, the user can walk through it as if it never existed. The stone can be recovered while shifting. : Mel only used its power once to get into the shaman's house without breaking the door down. Later on, in \\"Den of Thieves\\", it was used to release the Yinicor upon the Rougon thieves. The monster smashed open the cage that Melosa and Adam were held prisoner in. However, it was then taken back in \\"Adam and Eve of Destruction\\" as Adam used it to bust himself and Brackus out of Nazmul's dungeon. It has the henge of Yin and Infinis (The points on Yin are replaced by Infinis, much like Dreadcrow's henge). The Nova Stone :The Nova stone was carved by Nazmul and Sari and was owned by Seth's father and then given to Seth after his death. It is extremely rare and has great power, making it the ultimate last resort weapon against evil. It has its own power source, so that it can be cast even when the caster's stone energy is depleted. When Seth cast it in The Key to Victory in order to defeat Malco, it fired a large beam of light (much like the beam attacks from Dragon Ball Z). But at the time, Seth's control over it was limited, as the recoil from the stone, knocked him back with the other Defenders. :A portion of its power was later consumed by Brim to construct the Vitus Stone for Seth. Though at the end of the episode, it is shown that Seth was tricked into giving the Nova Stone to Brim. :The stone was then recovered by Adam (mysteriously) and then was given to Seth to destroy the guardian of the Yin Pure Stone, and also gained complete mastery of its awesome power. However, Brackus then stole it because of its modified prison function was necessary to defeat Nazmul. The function was added on by Brim and Brackus found out about its power through Lizel. :Adam then gets it back for the Defenders and it is then used by Seth to separate Nazmul from Malco and sealed his spirit. Its power assisted later with the Warrior Henge and Kara to destroy the Megalith. However, Malco and Flinch stole it to try to free Nazmul, but were unsuccessful in doing so until the Ethos offered their help. :Malco and Flinch eventually take Brim hostage and use him to break open the Nova Stone, freeing Nazmul's spirit. However, Brim designed it so that it needs another host to contain Nazmul's spirit. After draining the life force from Malco, Nazmul began to walk RaDos. Only to have his power cut off by Brackus (to walk on Rados, Nazmul needed the Nova Stone's power) and destroyed by Seth's Nega Mass spell. :The Defenders currently hold onto the Nova Stone, and Nazmul's spirit has been vanquished from its confines. The Nova Stone has the Di-Gata (Ogama and Nega) henge on it (also called Nova). The Flawed Stone :This stone was only seen in Flaw in The Ointment. It corrupted the villager's minds by creating an illusion of a Paradise, when really the village was corrupted and rotten. The elder didn't see that it was flawed. Mel was the only one who was immune to its effects after she saw through the illusion, and wasn't affected by its mind-altering powers. After she found where the stone was, she pulled the plug on the generator that was amplifying the stone's power. And by accident, Sebastian (the elder's robot servant) ran it over, destroying the stone and breaking the curse on the village. :Its henge consisted of Altas and two Negas (The Nega's top points are connected to the left and right sides of Altas). Tracking Stone : The stone that Adam used so that Brackus could be easily found by the rest of the Order of Infinis. It has only appeared in Adam and Eve of Destruction and it is unknown whether that stone will ever show up again or how it works. One theory is that there is a power inside that needs a special device to pick up, another it could be like the GPS system. Its henge was made up of Sum and the Altas-Infinis henges (The line in the centre of Sum was replaced by the Altas-Infinis henge). Transporter Stone :A transport system used in the Bakorian cycle. Brackus discovered it and use the system to transport his entire Yin-Tos army to the Spell Zone. This stone is required to summon and activate its power. :Its henge consists of Yin, Ogama and Altas (joined in order from top to bottom going middle) engraved on the stone. Shaman's Stone :Only seen near the end of The One, the shaman used the stone to absorb the attack that was directed at him. He then cast it and a creature somewhat similar to the absorbed attack came out of it which attacked Malco. It was given to him by a Gatashun monk who was carrying the Dako Pure Stone. :Its henge consists of Yin and Sum (connected in order from top to bottom) The Eternity Stone : This champion stone has appeared in Back Track'. Acquired from Dark Malco, Mel uses this stone and the staff given by a mysterious spirit in order to transport herself into the past. It is unknown whether it will reappear, as Melosa's grandmother kept it when she sent her forward in time. : Erik theorizes that the Eternity stone might tamper with the laws of temporal mechanics in which time is actually a loop instead of a straight line. : Its henge consists of Yin, Altas, Infinis, and Yan (joined in order from top to bottom). Annihilator Stone : First appeared in \\"Von Faustien\\". Von Faustien tracked an Ethos- infested witch, Lady K'Tahsh to Port Reevus, threatening to activate an Annihilator Stone to finish her. It is a superweapon compacted into a stone, with enough raw power to eradicate any life form or structure within a ten- mile radius. The stone was activated by accident, but Erik managed to use his modified Energy Bider to fire the energy into the sky, preventing disaster.

It is preceded by The Outstretched Shadow and To Light a Candle.  Plot summary After the Great Working to scry through the wards of Armethalieh and deflecting the attack of the Demon Queen Savilla, most of the Allied camp is drained for nearly a sennight. However, Savilla is likewise weakened and now both sides know a secret lost for a thousand years, that a combination of High Magick and Wild Magic can kill a Demon. When the Elven King Andoreniel proposes sending all Allied children and pregnant women to the Fortress of the Crowned Horns of the Moon, Knight-Mage Kellen points out numerous flaws but cannot think of an alternative plan. Meanwhile, Savilla plots to break the bonds that bind He Who Is, the creator of the Demons, by casting secret sacrifices on an enchanted spear in one of the many chambers of the vast World Without Sun. From the Crystal Spiders, Vestakia learns that an enclave of Shadowed Elves still exists somewhere in the Elven lands, in a cave associated with crystal and water though she doesn't know precisely where that is. The Elves give Cilarnen, the banished High Mage, a gift of many of their older books which discuss the High Magick. Unfortunately, he still lacks a source of power to cast any spells from. Jermayan, the only Elven Mage, and his Bonded dragon, Ancaladar, depart to begin the evacuation of the pregnant Elven women from the Nine Cities. At the first city, the women refuse to depart to safety while the city is under near constant attack from various Tainted creatures. Jermayan evacuates the entire city through the mountains and burns its Flower Forest so it will not fall to enemy hands. Approximately a third of the already reduced population survives attacks by Coldwarg, Frost Giants, Ice Trolls, and an Ice Drake. As the Allied army holds Council, Kellen reiterates the belief that the many attacks are meant to divide the Allied forces and stop them from interfering with what he believes to be the Endarkened's ultimate goal, Armethalieh. Without word from Andoreniel, the only orders the army commander, Redhelwar, is to give is to allow refugees from the other races to enter the relative safety of Elven Lands. Kellen is given command of a third of the army with directions to go to the Jeweled Caverns of Halacira to make it a suitable fortress for the refugees. Cilarnen confers privately with Kellen to inform him that the books may have given him the answer to his power problem. If he can get permission from them, he believes that he could use the power of the Elemental Powers that sustain the land-wards that surround the Elven nation. Unfortunately, the meeting with Viceroy Kindolhinadetil leaves both Kellen and Cilarnen confused as to whether it would be allowable. Unbeknownst to the side of Light, Crown Prince Zyperis of the Demons initiates a plague to affect both animal and forest to further distract the Allies. Kellen, with a third of the army under his command, moves out to journey to Sentarshadeen. Along the way they discover a village decimated by the plague loosed by the Demons. The Elves recognize it for what it is as the Enemy used the same tactic during the last war. Cilarnen receives a later from the viceroy that gives him permission to do all he can to aid the war effort, including summoning the Elementals of the land wards. A Salamander enters the summoning circle and merges its essence with Cilarnen, giving him much greater power while inside the Elven lands, but shortening his lifespan to a few years. The depleted High Council and High Mage Lycaelon fall further and further into the traitor Anigel's power. With his Magewardens policing the Mages and blindly following his lead, his work continues on lowering the City Wards that protect all within the City from Demons. Demon raids in the farther out City lands allows him to convince the Council that Wildmages are attacking. Cilarnen witnesses via a scrying spell the meeting that sends a unit of the Guard and two High Mages to the village of Nerendale to deal with the fictitious menace. Two days later, he witnesses the destruction of a Demon ambush and the kidnapping of the High Mages. Kellen and his troops reach the mountains where he and Shalkan discover a pass blocked by a Shadewalker, a huge monster with the ability to regenerate nonfatal wounds within minutes. Together they defeat it and determine it to have been the cause that no messages have gotten through between the army and the king. They reach Ondoladeshiron to find it suffering from the plague and news that Andoreniel lies ill and unresponsive in bed in Sentarshadeen. Kellen sends Keirasti and a small unit back to Redhelwar with this news and orders to move to the capital. Vestakia's attempts to discover the (hopefully) last enclave of the Shadowed Elves via telepathic communication with the Crystal Spiders are still fruitless. The only clues she has received are jewels and water. The prolonged communication opens her mind even further than before and she begins to see glimpses of her father, the Demon Prince Zyperis's mind while she's asleep. Finally, the Crystal Spiders manage to convey an image of giant xaique-pieces. The recently returned Jermayan and Idalia realize the enclave must be in Halacira, the cave where Kellen is heading to prepare for the refugees. Cilarnen manages to find and destroy a latent spell placed in his mind by Anigrel that would have caused him to attempt to kill Kellen. With his help, Idalia and Jermayan find Keirasti's group which Jermayan and Ancaladar go to intercept. They return to inform Redhelwar of the king's health, leaving Kellen without Vestakia's warning. Kellen suspects a trap in Halacira regardless and cautiously leads some of his troops in while the rest secure the other exits. The Shadowed Elves release a trap that floods most of the cave with the nearby river but with the help of Wildmages in his party and his casting of a spell he shouldn't have been able to cast, Kellen is able to break through. They eradicate the Shadowed Elves which were the last of their kind. The main army departs as Jermayan takes Keirasti back to her unit and then moves on to inform Kellen of the now-sprung trap. Kellen informs Jermayan of Andoreneil's illness and asks that Cilarnen, Idalia, and Vestakia be brought to assist the king and see if any Shadowed Elves remain. Unfortunately, the Wild Magic isn't strong enough to directly cure Andoreneil, but a combination of treatments seems to help. Savilla uses the High Mages captured at Nerendale to capture a unicorn and bring it to the enchanted spear. With its death, the barrier sealing He Who Is is greatly weakened. However, Zyperis was able to follow the unicorn's trail and know understands his mother's plans. Kellen charges Cilarnen with devising a way to open communications with Armethaleih to form an alliance and create the spells to protect Halacira. Vestakia learns through her dreams and counseling with Ancadalar, the Queen of Shadow Mountain's plans for He Who Is. Though a simple riddle game and a scrying spell, Kellen, Jermayan, and Idalia learn of the bargain Vielissar Farcarinon made to seal He Who Is during the last Shadow War. Idalia specifically learns the Great Working she'll need to cast, but lacks the consent of all the races of the Light which is required. Fortunately, Andoreneil has recovered enough to point her to the banners in his council chamber which are magically bound promises of all the races to serve in the time of need. Jermayan and Ancadalar take her to a Place of Power in the far north where she summons the Starry Hunt, the Powers that the Elves followed during their continual internal wars before the Endarkened first appeared. Their arrival in the world restores the waning of the Wild Mage and closes the door on He Who Is, though doesn't lock it. Jermayan and Idalia return to Redhelwar's army which is moving far too slow to be able to be of use in the spring battles to come. Jermayan offers a solution: a Great Working that would move the entire army to Kellen but would cost his and Ancadalar's lives. Understanding the necessity, the spell is cast and the army moved. However, the Starry Hunt intervenes and spares their lives at the last moment though it costs them all of their magic. Andoreneil gives Redhelwar a Viceroy's ring giving his autonomy and the authority to refuse the king's orders if he see fit. The army moves towards Armethaleih encountering refugees they send to Elven lands and Demon attacks along the way. Cilarnen negotiates with the land ward Elementals to get another Elemental to assist him when he crosses the borders and spends as much time as possible working on a plan with the Unicorn Knights. Anigrel has weakened the City Wards enough to let the mildest of Demonic influence in. With it he convinces Lycaelon of the need for allies against the Wildmages. He tells of another city that has isolated itself and is willing to assist Armethaleih and its inhabitants known as The Enlightened. Although an obvious cover for the Endarkened, Lycaelon and the High Council agree to hear from an envoy. The Endarkened army moves parallel to the Allied one as they approach Armethaleih. Vestakia, now able to read her father's mind even while awake, tells the Allies that the Demons intend to make a Great Sacrifice. By sacrificing a person who represents the Land at a Place of Power (one of which is very near to the Golden City), the Queen of Shadow Mountain will be able to break the bonds on He Who Is, even those created by the Starry Hunt. Upon reaching the city, the Allied army prepares for battle. However, Savilla uses all of the slaves the Demon army has to cast an extremely powerful spell that masks the presence of the Demons even to those with magical abilities. A small party of \\"The Enlightened\\" approach Armethaleih and the Arch Mage's party exits to meet them. Although the Wildmages are temporarily about to dispel the illusion, the Demons succeed in capturing Lycaelon who qualifies as representing the Land. The Demons withdraw from the City's immediate vicinity. Cilarnen leads the unicorns in a pattern that represents runes and manages to shatter the already corrupted City Wards completely. Attempting to regain Savilla's favour, Zyperis proceeds to lead an attack on the Allied army with the Demon forces not located at the Place of Power. Cilarnen, Jermayan, and Idalia enter the Golden City of Bells and confront the remains of the High Council, calling for immediate action in informing the citizens of the true nature of the Tokens of Citizenship, the rebuilding of the City Wards, and sending aid to the Allied army. Cilarnen's father, Lord Setarion Volpiril, intercedes and rejoins the Council and acts as a temporary leader when Cilarnen releases the bonds Lycaelon placed on him. Redhelwar hands leadership of the army over to Kellen shortly before the battle commences. Due to Kellen's reorganization of units, the Starry Hunt, and his Knight-Mage abilities, they are able to hold their own against the Demons and their ilk. With the help of a reclusive and often near-Banished scholar, Idalia works out a spell that combines High Magick and Wild Magic that should break through the Demon's shields at the Place of Power and transport Lycaelon back to the City. Meanwhile, Cilarnen begins the Grand Circle to recast the City Wards, the most complex spell in the High Magick. The Circle completes the casting just as his energy runs out and he collapses. With the help of some High Mages, Kellen's army manages to continue fighting until midnight approaches. Before entering the Circle that will cast the spell to save Lycaelon, Idalia finally accepts Jermayan's token of marriage, a necklace with a silver eight-pointed star. Without saying goodbye, she enters the Circle knowing what no one else does, that Lycaelon cannot merely be transported, a switch needs to be done. It is the final Mageprice for her, the one she incurred when she saved the Elven lands from the released storms nearly a year previous. As Lycaelon appears in the Circle, Savilla strikes Idalia with her blade and Jermayan runs for Ancadalar to try and save her. A wave of light washes over the land replenishing Wild Mages and High Mages and restoring Ancadalar and Jermayan's magical abilities. With it also comes the destruction of Zyperis and half of the Demons at the Place of Power. Jermayan slays Savilla with his re-acquired magic as well as the other Demons in the area. Kellen arrives later to find the surrounding area covered with flowers and Jermayan holding Idalia's body. Cilarnen recovers the next day and finds his memories intact and the Elemental has left him. By an ancient law of the City, he is voted the next High Mage as Lycaelon's mind was too damaged by his time in Savilla's custody. Jermayan and Ancadalar disappear shortly after Kellen found them. Kellen returns control of the army to Redhelwar and is in turn given control of a force to mop up the remains of the Demon's force and orders to then return to Sentarshadeen in three months time for Idalia's funeral. All of the races send their highest-ranking members to Idalia's funeral and many speak of her. Even Lycaelon gives a nominal eulogy, though Kellen declines to do so himself. Cilarnen approaches him afterwards and tells him of the progress he has made in reforming the City. Andoreneil asks to see Kellen in regards to the Fortress of the Crowned Horns. Kellen is to go and inform them of the end of the war and that they may return to their homes. When he, Vestakia, and Shalkan arrive, they find Ancadalar sunning himself on the rocks. Jermayan is inside with Ashaniel, the Elven Queen. Her new baby girl who was born with violet eyes and a silvery eight-pointed star birthmark on her chest. The Wild Magic's gift; Idalia reborn. When he leaves the fortress, Kellen realizes it was over a year ago he was rescued by Shalkan outside the City Gates. Kellen leaves the fortress hand in hand with Vestakia, and with a little prodding from the now-distant unicorn, Kellen kisses her.

It tells the story about a school that teaches students how to do magic and the crazy antics of a normal boy who was admitted under special circumstances. It was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from May 2006 to May 2008, within a total of ninety-nine chapters compiled into ten tank≈çbon volumes. Plot M√ó0 centers around Taiga Kuzumi, a hot-tempered young man who is able to hold his own in a fight. During an interview to determine if he can attend that he had plans of joining, Taiga is asked what he would do if he could use magic. \\"Conquer the World\\" is his reply and it is quickly followed by an outburst of laughter from a girl. Upon confronting the girl, she realizes how rude it was of her to laugh at his answer and tries to apologize, ultimately grasping his hands with tears in her eyes. After that point, he does not remember much else about the interview, but one thing he cannot change: he failed to enter the school. Blaming the girl for his failing to enter the school, he goes to Seinagi to confront her about it, when a teacher mistakes Taiga for a student ditching class and pulls him through some type of strange energy barrier that surrounds the school. Without realizing what has just happened, he has set foot on a school dedicated to teaching its students how to use magic, though the shock of his first encounter with it freaks him out so much that he tries to get away from the teacher as fast as he can, effectively convincing the latter that he is a suspicious person. After a confrontation where he is hit with a rather odd spell, he is able to tie the teacher up and run away. Unfortunately, he gets into some more trouble with some upperclassman and during this time is surprised to have found the girl from the interview attending the school. His main priority is then changed from merely survival in a strange land to finding this girl and conveying his feelings of romantic attraction to her, which have most suddenly become clear to him. Later on, due to various circumstances surrounding strict rules of the school, Taiga is admitted into the school but with only one difference from all the other students: he can't use magic. He must now try to survive in a school of magic and try to fool the entire school that he's a powerful magic user at the same time. Characters ; :Taiga is the protagonist of the story who is a normal guy who fails at first to get into the high school of his choice, but is soon after taken into the school grounds against his will when he is mistaken for a truant student. He tends to have a very strong-willed personality and never wants to back down from anything. His personality is only matched by his physical strength, as he extremely skilled in hand-to-hand combat which is a result of his sister practicing on him constantly. At his preliminary interview into the school of magic he attends, he met a girl named Aika Hiiragi, who he instantly has feelings towards. Once admitted to the school, he quickly finds out that he will not be learning any magic for the time being until they can issue him a proper magic plate, a sort of magical data storage device, which allows for magical spells and power to be stored. As it is, ever since he was admitted to the school, he has wished he could use magic someday. While he is unable to use magic, much of the school believes his magic skills are far superior to any normal freshman, which makes him very popular. :During an incident with school bullies who stole plates from students, Taiga lost his temporary plate. He faced either expulsion, or to make a wish, as all students who graduated from the magic school are allowed a wish in proportion to the amount of magical power they have acquired. Depending on the wish the principal was to judge if Taiga would be allowed to remain in the school as losing a plate was a serious offense. Taiga's wish was so that he could \\"Grant someone else's wish if that person isn't able to grant that wish on their own.\\" The person in question was Aika, who in a chat revealed that her mother died while she was still young, and her greatest wish would be to see her. The principal had a lie-discovering spell cast on herself so she would be able to see if Taiga answered truthfully, which he did. The principal was content and granted him his own personal plate, The M0. ; :Aika is a young girl attending Seinagi Private High School and is thus a mage in training. She has a unique trait in that she is able to laugh at nearly anything relatively comical, which always ends up being loud and unrestrained. Her father is one of the magic teachers at her school. Aika has a naturally kind and forgiving personality and it takes a lot for her to not forgive someone for anything they have done to wrong her. She also has a natural clumsiness, which often makes it difficult for her to recite magic spells. Her main magic revolves around invisibility, changing objects' shape and 'voice warp', something like a sound beam, which is depicted as dangerous and scary by almost everyone (even her father) though its uses in a day are very limited. :During her elementary and junior high school years, she attended all-girl schools, so this is her first time experiencing co-ed schooling. She does not recall her mother because she lost her at a young age; her wish when she graduates is to see her mother, even though the magic to do this must be extremely powerful. At first Taiga got on her bad side, though she grew to see him as a friend and seems to have developed feelings for him. ; :Kenjirou is a 37 year old widower who is Aika's father and the chairman of the magical arts at Seinagi High School. The students of the school show him a lot of respect, always bowing when he passes by and making sure not to upset him. This is because his magic skills are second only to the principal herself and thus every student fears him. The only way he was able to keep his job after Taiga found out about the school was to have Taiga join the school as a student. He is very protective of his daughter, especially if it involves anything having to do with Taiga, who is in the same class as her.

On November 24, 2009, the Department of State announced that it was offering a reward of up to $5 million for Abu Ibrahim, now about 73 years old. The previous reward of $200,000 had produced no results. The aircraft was later put back in service by Pan American World Airways and remained in operation for various carriers until the early 1990s. It was scrapped in 2005. In popular culture It served as a prop for the 1996 film Executive Decision for the fictional Oceanic Airlines.

Biography Born in Somalia to Waceysle parents, Togane was educated in Mennonite schools in Mahaddei and Jowhar in his home country. He subsequently moved to the United States where he attended Hartnell Junior College. He graduated from Eastern Mennonite College with a BA in English literature in 1969, where he was among the first Somali Christians from Muslim background to enroll. He returned to Somalia and taught at the Lafole College of Education from 1970 to 1973. Like many other intellectuals, he left Somali to escape Mohammed Siad Barre's military regime. He settled in Canada in 1973 and acquired Canadian citizenship in 1978.Robert Rhodes \\"Togane Exposed\\" ‚Äì Mennonite Weekly Review, December 17, 2004 He received an MA in creative writing from Montreal's Concordia University in 1982. He has taught and lectured at many colleges and universities in Canada and the United States. He co-founded the Montreal Somali House and the Somali Peace coalition, and has been involved in several efforts for Somali peace and reconciliation including a visit to Somali in 1991‚Äì92. Togane published his first collection of poetry in 1986. The book, The Bottle and the Bushman: Poems of the Prodigal Son, focussed on themes of racism, alcoholism and Christianity. This and future writings also acerbically critique Somali social and political practices, including female genital mutilation, life under dictatorship, prejudice between cultures, clans and religious and the dangers of clans. His works, described as \\"brilliant caustic, controversial, wickedly funny, and associative free-verse commentaries\\". also appear on his and other Somali websites, skewering aspects of Somali politics and experience. The poems, which often examine and reflect on subjects that are taboo in public Somali discourse, and they may be expressed with vulgar language to reinforce the point. Religious, philosophical, literary and pop culture references abound. Critics argue his confrontational style sometimes contributes to the conflict he seeks to expose and oppose. However, others state that his style reflects his acknowledgement that he, like other Somalis, are deeply influenced by clan-based thinking and the influence of the civil war. His poetry has been collected in several anthologies and appeared on Montreal buses as part of the Poetry in Motion program. Togane has written articles for various media, including The Globe and Mail, Zymergy, and African Art.

Life Nothing is known of Troiano's early life other than that he was from the vicinity of Naples, possibly from the town of Corduba, since in his first and second books of canzoni he calls himself \\"Massimo Troiano di Corduba da Napoli\\". Only his activities during the three-year span of 1567-70 are documented, but those in some detail. In 1567 he published in Treviso a book of canzoni, secular songs on his own verse. By early 1568 he was in Munich, in the service of the House of Wittelsbach, singing in the Bavarian Hofkapelle under the direction of Orlande de Lassus. He traveled between Munich and Venice at least twice, with one extended stay in Venice in 1569, where he waited for the Duke of Bavaria to send him money and an acceptance letter for continued service. He remained in Munich until Easter 1570, when he was accused of murdering one of his musical colleagues, and fled. A warrant was issued for his arrest, but he was never found, and there is no known documentation of his activity after that time. Another Troiano, Giovanni, appeared in Rome in 1571, a few months after Massimo's disappearance from Munich. There is no evidence to indicate whether Giovanni was related to Massimo, but they were both composers of secular vocal music. Giovanni lived for an additional half-century, until 1622. Work and influence While Massimo Troiano published four books of secular songs (in three collections--in 1567, 1568 and 1570), he is best known for having provided in his Dialoghi a vivid and colorful description of life in the Bavarian court and especially the lavish marriage ceremony for the Munich wedding of Duke Wilhelm V and Ren√©e of Lorraine. Modern scholars consider Troiano to be an unreliable (since he was being paid to portray the court in the most positive terms), but useful witness.\\"The Dialoghi must be read with caution since Troiano had only been at court a short time, spoke no German, and was expected to portray the court in the most flattering terms.\\" Crook, p. 34. Troiano's Dialoghi was published in Munich in 1568, Venice in 1569 and appeared shortly thereafter in a Spanish translation. The book is the most complete description of how Orlande de Lassus produced and staged his musical performances, and contains accounts of both instrumental and vocal music. \\"The singers [serve] every morning at High Mass and at Vespers on Saturdays and the vigils of the feasts of obligation. The wind instruments are played on Sundays, and on feast days at Mass and at Vespers in company with the singers.\\" Crook, p. 34. The Italian original is given in a footnote. Troiano also gives unusually detailed descriptions of how Mass was celebrated and which parts were sung polyphonically--all important information in reconstructing Renaissance performance practice. Troiano also left an account of the 1567 performance of the largest polyphonic composition of the Renaissance, the 40- and 60-voice Missa sopra Ecco s√¨ beato giorno by Alessandro Striggio. Troiano's music was mostly in the light Neapolitan style of the canzon villanesca alla napoletana, sometimes called simply \\"canzonettas\\", three-part vocal compositions related to madrigals but more formulaic in character, although in Troiano's hands, along with his compatriot Giovanni Leonardo Primavera, they began to approach the artistic world of the madrigal. All of his books of canzonette he published in Venice, and they show aspects both of Neapolitan and contemporary Venetian style. Most of the verse he likely wrote himself, and he sometimes writes nostalgically of his native Naples, for which he longed.Einstein, Vol. II, p. 580-582 References and further reading * David Crook, Orlando di Lasso's Imitation Magnificats for Counter-Reformation Munich.

Background Andrews, a zoology major who played bassoon in the college band, was described by his hometown newspaper as \\"The Nicest Boy in Wolcott\\". In reality, the 18-year-old entertained fantasies of poisoning his family and moving to Chicago, Illinois to become a gangster and professional hitman. Andrews and his sister, Jennie Marie, were both home for the Thanksgiving holiday in 1958. Jennie Marie was watching television with her parents while Andrews was upstairs reading The Brothers Karamazov. When he finished reading the novel, Andrews shaved, put on a suit, and went downstairs carrying a .22 caliber rifle and a revolver. Walking into the room where his parents and sister were, Andrews turned on a light and opened fire with his rifle. He shot his sister, Jennie Marie, 20, between the eyes. He then turned the gun on his parents, shooting his father, William, 50, twice and mother, Opal, 42, three times. His mother moved towards him and he shot her another three times. His father attempted to crawl to the kitchen and was shot repeatedly with the revolver. Andrews fired a total of 17 shots into his father. After opening a window in an attempt to make the crime look like a burglary, Andrews left the house and drove to the nearby town of Lawrence. He drove to his apartment to establish an alibi, claiming that he had needed to pick up his typewriter to write an essay and then went to the Granada movie theater, where he watched Mardi Gras (1958), starring Pat Boone. When the film ended, he drove to the Kansas River, dismantled the weapons and threw them off the Massachusetts Street Bridge. He returned home and called the police to inform them of a robbery at his parents' house. When police arrived, they noticed that Andrews seemed unconcerned over the massacre of his family. He protested his innocence until the family's minister, Pastor Vertio C. Dameron of Grandview Baptist Church in Kansas City, Kansas, was able to persuade him to confess. Lowell eventually confessed that he had committed the murder, stating \\"I'm not sorry and I'm not glad I did it. I just don't know why I did it, I didn't even feel anything as they died.\\"  Conviction and execution  Andrews pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity but was convicted and sentenced to death. His request for clemency from Kansas Governor John Anderson, Jr. was denied. Despite further appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court let the conviction stand and the State of Kansas executed Andrews by hanging on November 30, 1962 at the age of 22. His last meal was two fried chickens with sides of mashed potatoes, green beans and pie √† la mode. He gave no last words. Andrews was on death row at the Lansing Correctional Facility at the same time as Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, murderers of the Clutter family and the subjects of Truman Capote's 1965 book In Cold Blood. Several pages in Capote's book concern Andrews, who was portrayed by C. Ernst Harth in the film Capote and Ray Gestaut in the film Infamous the following year. He was portrayed by Bowman Upchurch in the original film adaptation of In Cold Blood.

Dihydroergocryptine has been shown to be particularly effective as monotherapy in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. Initial monotherapy with a dopamine agonist (other examples include pergolide, pramipexole, and ropinirole) is associated with reduced risk for motor complications in Parkinson patients relative to levodopa. DHEC, like other dopamine agonists, aims to mimic the endogenous neurotransmitter and exert an antiparkinsonian effect. Recent evidence also supports that dopamine receptor agonists, instead of L-DOPA may slow or prevent the progression of Parkinson's disease. Dihydroergocryptine can also be used in migraine prophylaxis, as well as for the treatment of low blood pressure in elderly patients and peripheral vascular disorder. More commonly, it is used in combination with two similar compounds, dihydroergocornine and dihydroergocristine. This mixture is called ergoloid or codergocrine.Drugs.com: Ergoloid Mesylates Chemistry Dihydroergocryptine is a mixture of two very similar compounds, alpha- and beta-dihydroergocryptine (epicriptine) at a ratio of 2:1. The beta differs from the alpha form only in the position of a single methyl group, which is a consequence of the biosynthesis of the parent compound ergocryptine, in which the proteinogenic amino acid leucine is replaced by isoleucine. Dihydroergocryptine is a hydrogenated ergot derivative that is also structurally very similar to bromocriptine, another drug that has anti- Parkinson effects. DHEC differs in that it is hydrogenated in C9‚ÄìC10 and lacks bromine in C2. In fact, all ergot derivatives are uniquely or mainly D2-like receptor agonists. Pharmacodynamics Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that dihydroergocriptine is an effective anti-Parkinson drug, most likely exerting its effects as a potent agonist of D2 receptors. The Kd of DHEC is found to be around 5-8 nM at D2 receptors. Less certain is the contribution of its partial D1 receptor and D3 receptor agonist activity. DHEC has a lower affinity for D1 and D3 receptors (Kd is around 30 nM for both) than for D2 receptors. It is widely believed that dopamine receptor agonists demonstrate their antiparkinsonian effects by stimulating D2 receptors primarily, but other dopamine receptors, such as D1 and D3 may be involved. Remarkably, DHEC does not significantly interact with serotonergic and adrenergic receptors. Pharmacokinetics Dihydroergocriptine has two main pharmacokinetic advantages over levodopa. The first pharmacokinetic advantage is its half-life of 12 to 16 hours. This relatively long half-life is considered to contribute to the compound's effectiveness in Parkinson's disease, particularly since it allows for more continuous stimulation of brain dopaminergic receptors than short-acting drugs such as levodopa. Though the exact reason is not known, continuous stimulation is considered to reduce risk for motor complications. The second pharmacokinetic advantage is the lack of dietary influence on drug absorption. This characteristic also allows for more sustained dopamine receptor stimulation. DHEC can be taken with a single oral dose and is rapidly absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations occur between 30 and 120 minutes after administration. The strong first-pass hepatic metabolism results in poor bioavailability. Less than 5% of the original dosage reaches the circulation. Treatment The relatively long half-life and lack of dietary influence of dihydroergocriptine is considered to contribute to the compound's effectiveness in Parkinson's disease, particularly since it allows for more continuous stimulation of brain dopaminergic receptors than short- acting drugs such as levodopa. DHEC is also proven to be a safe and effective in improving symptoms in Parkinson's patients. Motor improvements Motor improvements in Parkinson's patients are usually observed in patients who take at least a mean daily dose of approximately 40 mg. Patients on DHEC demonstrate a better score than if they were on L-Dopa on the Webster scale, a standardized rating scale of Parkinson's Disease symptoms such as gait parameters and dyskinesia. Another clinical study has shown that DHEC had superior efficacy in reducing the clinical and motorcomplications associated with long-term L-Dopa use, as well as in reducing the incidence and severity of adverse effects. Neuroprotective effects Activation of presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors by dihydroergocriptine leads to reduced dopamine receptor turnover and indirect antioxidant effects. In particular, further activation of intracellular kinase systems due to dopamine agonists are hypothesized to lead to antiapoptotic effects that also help in halting and slowing the disease progression. This may also contribute to prevention of development of motor fluctuations, though more research is needed. Modern agonists like dihydroergocryptine typically cost two to three times more than levadopa therapy. More health economics assessments may be needed to determine whether the initial increased costs of the agonists are offset by less patients needing surgery in later stages of the disease. Side effects Dihydroergocryptine has been suggested to produce fewer side-effects and have similar efficacy to a classical dopamine agonist due to its biochemical profile. There is also no interference with levodopa metabolism. Although DHEC may come with some acute side-effects described further below, DHEC has overall good tolerability with little to no withdrawal or changes in its scheduling. Acute side-effects usually accompany the beginning of treatment but tend to decrease as the patient develops increased tolerance to the drug. In randomized, double-blinded trials, individuals on different dopamine agonists, including dihydroergocryptine, did not differ in discontinuation rate associated with adverse events. However, there do seem to be a higher incidence of dopaminergic related side-effects such as hallucinations and gastrointestinal complaints tend to be more frequent. * Nausea * Vomiting * Anxiety * Cardiac arrhythmias * Postural hypotension * Somnolence * Hallucinations * Impulse control disorders * Peripheral oedema  See also  * Bromocriptine * Cabergoline * Pergolide  References  Category:Dopamine agonists Category:Oxazolopyrrolopyrazines Category:Lactams Category:Ergot alkaloids Category:Lysergamides Category:GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators Category:Isopropyl compounds ","title":"Dihydroergocryptine"},{"id":"7158228","text":"Ivan Thomas Bootham (20 July 1939 ‚Äì 14 July 2016) was a New Zealand novelist, short story writer, poet and composer.F.

In microbiology, streaking is a technique used to isolate a pure strain from a single species of microorganism, often bacteria. Samples can then be taken from the resulting colonies and a microbiological culture can be grown on a new plate so that the organism can be identified, studied, or tested. The modern streak plate method has progressed from the efforts of Robert Koch and other microbiologists to obtain microbiological cultures of bacteria in order to study them. The dilution or isolation by streaking method was first developed by Loeffler and Gaffky in Koch's laboratory, which involves the dilution of bacteria by systematically streaking them over the exterior of the agar in a Petri dish to obtain isolated colonies which will then grow into quantity of cells, or isolated colonies. If the agar surface grows microorganisms which are all genetically same, the culture is then considered as a microbiological culture. Technique Streaking is rapid and ideally a simple process of isolation dilution. The technique is done by diluting a comparatively large concentration of bacteria to a smaller concentration. The decrease of bacteria should show that colonies are sufficiently spread apart to affect the separation of the different types of microbes. Streaking is done using a sterile tool, such as a cotton swab or commonly an inoculation loop. Aseptic techniques are used to maintain microbiological cultures and to prevent contamination of the growth medium. There are many different types of methods used to streak a plate. Picking a technique is a matter of individual preference and can also depend on how large the number of microbes the sample contains. Illustration of streak plate procedure to achieve isolated colonies using aseptic technique. The three- phase streaking pattern, known as the T-Streak, is recommended for beginners. The streaking is done using a sterile tool, such as a cotton swab or commonly an inoculation loop. The inoculation loop is first sterilized by passing it through a flame. When the loop is cool, it is dipped into an inoculum such as a broth or patient specimen containing many species of bacteria. The inoculation loop is then dragged across the surface of the agar back and forth in a zigzag motion until approximately 30% of the plate has been covered. The loop then is re-sterilized and the plate is turned 90 degrees. Starting in the previously streaked section, the loop is dragged through it two to three times continuing the zigzag pattern. The procedure is then repeated once more being cautious to not touch the previously streaked sectors. Each time the loop gathers fewer and fewer bacteria until it gathers just single bacterial cells that can grow into a colony. The plate should show the heaviest growth in the first section. The second section will have less growth and a few isolated colonies, while the final section will have the least amount of growth and many isolated colonies. Growth medium The sample is spread across one quadrant of a Petri dish containing a growth medium. Bacteria need different nutrients to grow. This includes water, a source of energy, sources of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, certain minerals, and other vitamins and growth factors. A very common type of media used in microbiology labs is known as agar, a gelatinous substance derived from seaweed. The nutrient agar has a lot of ingredients with unknown amounts of nutrients in them. On one hand, this can be a very selective media to use because as mentioned bacteria are particular. If there is a certain nutrient in the media the bacteria could most certainly not grow and could die. On the other hand, this media is very complex. Complex media is important because it allows for a wide range of microbial growth. The bacteria growth can be supported by this media greatly due in part to the high amounts of nutrients. Choice of which growth medium is used depends on which microorganism is being cultured, or selected for. Different labs have different standards as to the direction and style of the streaking. Incubation Dependent on the strain, the plate may then be incubated, usually for 24 to 36 hours, to allow the bacteria to reproduce. At the end of incubation there should be enough bacteria to form visible colonies in the areas touched by the inoculation loop. From these mixed colonies, single bacterial or fungal species can be identified based on their morphological (size/shape/colour) differences, and then sub-cultured to a new media plate to yield a pure culture for further analysis. Automated equipment is used at industrial level for streak plating the solid media in order to achieve better sterilization and consistency of streaking and for reliably faster work. While streaking manually it is important to avoid scratching the solid medium as subsequent streak lines will be damaged and non-uniform deposition of inoculum at damaged sites on the medium yield clustered growth of microbes which may extend into nearby streak lines. Importance  Bacteria exist in water, soil and food, on skin, and intestinal tract normal flora. The assortment of microbes that exist in the environment and on human bodies is enormous. The human body has billions of bacteria which creates the normal flora fighting against the invading pathogens. Bacteria frequently occur in mixed populations. It is very rare to find a single occurring species of bacteria. To be able to study the cultural, morphological, and physiological characteristics of an individual species, it is vital that the bacteria be divided from the other species that generally originate in the environment. This is important in determining a bacterium in a clinical sample. When the bacteria is streaked and isolated, the causative agent of a bacterial disease can be identified.

Background Current began his criminal career in 1942, when he was convicted for burglary and sentenced to nine months imprisonment in Oakland County jail and, following his release, would be linked to numerous robberies throughout the west coast and later the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. In August 1948, Current's raid on a Minneapolis loan company would be acknowledged by police officials as \\"...the smoothest stickup in a generation\\" for which he was later sentenced to five years imprisonment. After serving less than three years, Current was released on parole in May 1951 and returned to California where he was identified committing a string of robberies between 1952 and 1953 including a robbery of a Minneapolis tavern of $2,500 in November 1952 and $1,500 from a San Francisco restaurant in January 1953. After yet another robbery in San Francisco, he was officially placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list on May 18, 1953. During this time, Current was frequently on the road and placed in several locations across the country including the March 1 robbery of $22,000 from a St. Paul dairy and $250 from a Minneapolis hotel only two weeks later. Despite his status as a federal fugitive, Current continued his crime spree participating in the robbery of $5,148 from the American Trust Company with two Oakland criminals on June 25. A longtime sufferer of severe tuberculosis, of which his noticeably enlarged larynx attributed to his prison nickname \\"The Apple\\", was worsened by his traveling and fled to Omaha, Nebraska with his teenaged wife in early July. Although believing he would not be recognized, federal agents received an anonymous tip regarding Current's whereabouts and, on July 12, he and his wife were arrested by federal agents and local police officials. Unarmed, Current offered no resistance as he was taken into custody and extradited to California where he was eventually convicted and imprisoned.

He has been involved in the music industry for over 50 years and has earned over 50 gold and platinum records for engineering, producing, and mastering.  Biography  A native Georgian, Rodney began his music career in 1962 playing bass for The Bushmen. During his seven years with the group, Rodney became intrigued with recording music and actively started pursuing a career as an engineer in 1967. In 1968, Rodney became chief engineer at Lefevre Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. During his three years there, he engineered records for several local and national acts ranging from gospel, country, R&B;, rock, and everything in between. Some of the artists he worked with there included Joe South, Billy Joe Royal, Dennis Yost and the Classics IV, The Meters, The Stamps Quartet, James Brown, The Winstons, Mylon LeFevre, and scores of other projects. In 1970, Rodney was approached by Buddy Buie to build a studio for him and become the chief engineer there. He co-designed and oversaw the construction of the famous Studio One in a suburb of Atlanta, Doraville, Georgia. For the next sixteen years, Rodney worked almost exclusively in this studio on numerous projects for different artists and clients. During his tenure at Studio One, Rodney worked with numerous artists as engineer and later as producer/engineer. The list includes: B. J. Thomas, The Atlanta Rhythm Section (11 albums), Lynyrd Skynyrd (4 albums), 38 Special (7 albums), Outlaws, Journey, Eric Martin, Helix, and many other albums and projects. In 1986, Rodney left Studio One to continue his career as a producer independent of any studio. Since then, he has produced records for 38 Special (2 albums), Gregg Allman (2 albums), Cruzados (2 albums), The Radiators (2 albums), The Doobie Brothers (2 albums) and several other projects. In 1989, Rodney produced Billboard Magazine's number one Adult Contemporary Song of the Year with 38 Special's \\"Second Chance\\".

One of his first engineering projects included recording a 45rpm single for a Washington, D.C. based gospel group called The Winstons. The single for the group, titled \\"Color Him Father\\", went on to sell over 500,000 copies (RIAA certified gold) and won a Grammy Award the same year for Best R&B; Song. The B-Side of the 7\\" vinyl single was an up-tempo instrumental rendition of an older gospel music classic titled \\"Amen Brother\\". This song included a 4 bar drum solo played by Winstons drummer G.C. Coleman, which years later was to become known as the famous \\"Amen Break\\". It has now become one of the world's most sampled beats of all time and has been used by many artists including 2 Live Crew, N.W.A, Heavy D, Salt-N-Pepa, Scarface, Schoolly D, Nine Inch Nails, Oasis and Prodigy and has spawned entire musical genres such as Jungle and Acid.  Awards and recognition  1996 was a special year for Rodney, as he was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame. The annual black tie event held at the Georgia World Congress Center honors Georgians in the music business. Along with the acceptance of this most prestigious award, he was enshrined in the Hall of Fame building in Macon, GA. among other notable inductees including Ray Charles, Lena Horne, James Brown, Bill Lowery, Buddy Buie, Little Richard, Gladys Knight, Joe South, TLC, R.E.M. and many others.  Affiliations  Rodney has served on the Board of Governors for NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Science), and has served on several committees and panels for their Music In The Schools program. This organization is responsible for the nomination and voting of the Grammy Awards, one of the highest honors awarded for excellence in music. He currently serves on the Board of Governors for Friends of Georgia Music, which oversees the induction process for the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.

He also was a defensive backs coach at the University of Northern Colorado and the Defensive quality control coach for the Denver Broncos. College career A native of California, he attended Santa Monica High School. Gordon was recruited to play at the University of Kansas as a wide receiver, arriving on campus in 2002. In 2003, as a redshirt freshman, Gordon had 57 pass receptions for 769 yards, both totals set school records for freshmen. These marks were good enough to earn Gordon first team freshmen All-American honors. Gordon finished the season as one of the team's starting cornerbacks in addition to his starting roles as a wide receiver and punt returner. The following season Gordon was moved to defense on a full-time basis. He led the nation in interceptions (7) and earning first team All-Big 12 and third team All-American honors. Going into his junior season, Gordon was named a pre-season first team All-American at cornerback by numerous publications, however, Gordon was moved back to being primarily a wide receiver early in the conference season. For his efforts during his junior campaign, Gordon was named first team All-Big 12 kick returner, as well as second team cornerback and honorable mention wide receiver. At the conclusion of the 2005 season, Gordon announced that he would forgo his senior season to enter the NFL Draft. Professional career Minnesota Vikings Gordon went undrafted in the 2006 NFL Draft but signed with the Minnesota Vikings shortly after. Initially signed to the practice squad, Gordon was added to the active roster on November 7, 2006. Gordon suffered a broken leg on a punt return against the Green Bay Packers on November 9, 2008. The next day he was placed on season ending injured reserve.

It is by far the longest of the epistles of Plato and gives an autobiographical account of his activities in Sicily as part of the intrigues between Dion and Dionysius of Syracuse for the tyranny of Syracuse. It also contains an extended philosophical interlude concerning the possibility of writing true philosophical works and the theory of forms.R. G. Bury, Prefatory note to \\"Epistle VII\\" in Plato IX, Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1929): 463‚Äì75. Assuming that the letter is authentic, it was written after Dion was assassinated by Calippus in 353 BC and before the latter was in turn overthrown a year later. Authenticity Of all the letters attributed to Plato, the Seventh Letter is widely considered the only one that might be authentic. R. Ledger defends its authenticity on the basis of computer analysis.R. Ledger, Re-counting Plato: A Computer Analysis of Plato's Style (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989), 148‚Äì50. Anthony Kenny is likewise inclined to accept it as genuine.Anthony Kenny, A New History of Ancient Philosophy. Volume I: Ancient Philosophy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), 49. The main objections to its authenticity involve its statement that there are forms or ideas of artificial things, whereas Aristotle attributes to Plato the idea that there are forms or ideas only of natural things, as well as the fact that the letter's purported historical setting seems unlikely: the letter implies that Dion's followers wrote to Plato asking him for practical political advice while at the same time insinuating that he had not been loyal to Dion, that Calippus permitted the letter to get to Plato, and that Plato replied by recounting in detail recent history to people who were immediately involved in those events and included in his advice a long digression on the theory of forms. These problems lead R. G. Bury to conclude that the letter was an open letter intended to defend Plato in the eyes of his fellow Athenians rather than to be sent to Dion's followers in Sicily; there probably never was any letter from them to Plato, he says. Nevertheless, the Seventh Letter has recently been argued to be spurious by prominent scholars such as Malcolm Schofield,Malcolm Schofield, \\"Plato & Practical Politics\\", in Greek & Roman Political Thought, ed. Schofield & C. Rowe (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 299‚Äì302.

Terence Irwin,Terence Irwin, \\"The Intellectual Background,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Plato, ed. R. Kraut (Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 1992), 78‚Äì79n4. and Julia Annas. According to Annas, the Seventh Letter is \\"such an unconvincing production that its acceptance by many scholars is best seen as indicating the strength of their desire to find, behind the detachment of the dialogues, something, no matter what, to which Plato is straightforwardly committed.\\"Julia Annas, \\"Classical Greek Philosophy,\\" in The Oxford History of Greece and the Hellenistic World, ed. Boardman, Griffin and Murray (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 285. Structure and summary The Seventh Letter touches upon a variety of themes, not always in an organized fashion. This article follows Bury in dividing its summary into the following sections.  Introduction (323d‚Äì326b)  Plato opens by assuring Dion's followers that he shares Dion's political goals. He then says how he came to hold his opinions concerning politics by recounting his early life and political disillusionment following the Thirty Tyrants and the trial of Socrates.  First visit to Sicily (326b‚Äì328d)  Plato tells of his first visit to Syracuse, where he befriended Dion during the reign of Dionysius the Elder. Dionysius the Elder died after Plato had returned home and Dion urged him to educate the younger Dionysius, who had ascended to the tyranny, with the aim of transforming him into a philosopher king.  Second visit to Sicily (328d‚Äì330b)  Plato explains that he agreed to Dion's proposal lest he seem to be a bad friend and to care nothing for philosophy's reputation, but the visit turned out to be a failure. Dion fell from Dionysius' good graces due to courtiers' slanders; Plato himself fell under suspicion of seeking to overthrow Dionysius. He continued to attempt to give the tyrant good counsel, however.  The limits of counsel (330c‚Äì331d)  Plato leaves off the historical narrative, but before giving his advice to Dion's friends and followers he notes that one should not attempt to advise those who will not heed good advice. One should not tell those who do not wish to be virtuous how best to satisfy their vicious desires, nor should one compel those who are not willing to listen.  The effects of attempting to advise Dionysius (331d‚Äì334c) Plato advises Dion's followers in the same way that he and Dion had advised Dionysius the Younger. They had attempted to remind him of his father's unhappiness, counseling him to lead a moderate personal life and make friends with good men. This advice would have required him to renounce the company of those courtiers who benefited from his immoderation, so these conspired to slander Dion such that he was exiled again. Dion returned to admonish Dionysius \\"by deed\\" (333b; i.e., at the head of an army), but the Syracuseans themselves believed slanders that Dion was attempting to set himself up as a tyrant and supported Dion's murder. Because those who assassinated Dion were Athenians, Plato defends Athens, saying that Dion's best friend (himself) was also Athenian.  Plato's present advice (334c‚Äì337e)  Plato admonishes the addressees with the same advice that he and Dion had given Dionysius the Younger, viz. to abolish the despotism in Sicily and establish a constitutional government in each city with just laws. He claims that Dionysius lives an ignoble life because he did not heed this advice, while Dion died a noble death because he followed it. Dion would have ruled by law. Plato counsels his followers to avoid partisan strife, live moderately, and seek no reprisals in their hour of victory. Since the ideal political order of rule by a philosopher king is now impossible, he says, let the second-best of rule by law come about.  Between Plato's second and third visits to Sicily (337e‚Äì340b)  Plato resumes his historical narrative where he had left off. War compelled Plato to leave Sicily during his second visit there. Before permitting him to leave, however, Dionysius had extracted a promise that he would return when hostilities ceased and Plato had agreed on the condition that Dion be recalled from exile. Dion was not recalled and Plato was reluctant to return, but was persuaded by Dion and by Archytas of Tarentum of the prudence of doing so, especially as Dionysius himself was rumored to be interested in philosophy again.  Third visit to Sicily (340b‚Äì341a)  Upon his arrival, Plato decided to test whether Dionysius' attachment to philosophy was genuine by informing him of the various unexciting preparatory studies he would need to undertake.  Long digression on the Forms (341b‚Äì345c)  Dionysius claimed to already be an expert on philosophy and therefore turned out to be a bad pupil, Plato claims. Plato claims that Dionysius was an impostor, for he had written a metaphysical treatise that he claimed was superior to Plato's lectures. Plato can claim that Dionysius was an impostor because the truth about metaphysics cannot be expressed in writing and all those who know the truth know this; hence, if Dionysius thought he had expressed the truth about metaphysics in writing, he did not know the truth. Plato's explanation of why the deepest truths cannot be expressed in written form is famously abstruse. Before one attains the \\"thing which is cognizable and true\\" (gn≈çston te kai alƒìthes), one must have apprehended the \\"name,\\" \\"account\\" (logos), \\"image,\\" and \\"knowledge\\" (epistƒìmƒì). Name and account are approached through verbal description, while sense perception perceives the image. One attains knowledge only from the combination of verbal description and sense perception, and one must have knowledge before one can attain the object of knowledge (which Plato calls simply \\"the Fifth,\\" name, account, image, and knowledge being \\"the Four\\"). The Fifth, moreover, differs from what is sensible and verbal expressions of it. Name and account provide the \\"quality\\" of a thing (to poion), but not its \\"essence\\" or \\"being\\" (to on). They are, moreover, akin to sense perceptions in that they are ever shifting and relative, not fixed. As a result, the student who attempts to understand the Fifth through name, account, image, and knowledge is confused; he seeks the essence, but always finds the quality intruding. Only certain kinds of student can scrutinize the Four, and even then the vision of the Fifth comes by a sudden flash. Since this is how philosophy is conducted, no serious person would ever attempt to teach serious philosophic doctrines in a book or to the public at large. Dionysius' motivation for having written a philosophic text must have been a desire for glory. Indeed, he had received only one lecture on metaphysics from Plato.  Resumption of the narrative of the third visit (345c‚Äì350b)  Dionysius abused Plato in several ways during his third visit to Syracuse. He had promised to send Dion the revenues of his property in Sicily, but reneged. Plato in response threatened to leave and was assuaged only when Dionysius proposed a compromise; Plato agreed to remain only until Dion had replied. Before that could happen, however, Dionysius sold Dion's property on the cheap, appointed himself the warden of half of the proceeds on behalf of Dion's son, and would let Plato take only the other half to Dion in exile. Moreover, the sailing season had already ended and so Plato was forced to remain in Syracuse anyway. In the meantime, Dionysius' attempts to cut the pay of the mercenaries who supported his rule provoked a mutiny that was blamed on Heracleides, the leader of the democratic party in Syracuse. Theodotes persuaded Dionysius in Plato's presence to permit Heracleides to leave the city in peace, but Dionysius used this merely to flush him out of hiding. When Dionysius claimed never to have made any promise to let him go, Plato spoke up and affirmed that he had. As a result, Dionysius found a pretext for expelling Plato from the palace (where he had been housed) and lodging him in the soldiers' quarters. He then claimed that Theodotes' visits to him there were a sign that he was conspiring with his enemies. Plato pleaded with Archytas, who persuaded Tarentum to send a vessel for him.  Dion's invasion and assassination (350b‚Äì351e)  After leaving Sicily for the third and final time, Plato traveled to Olympia, where he met Dion preparing for war. Dion asked Plato for his support, but he refused, claiming that he had been a guest in Dionysius' house and that he did not relish the problems that would be caused by a civil war. Dion invaded anyway and was successful. Plato eulogizes Dion, claiming that he sought power only for the common good. Dion fell, he says, because he underestimated the viciousness of the men he was opposing.  Conclusion (351e‚Äì352a)  Plato explains why he went into such detail about his third visit, despite having already given his advice as to how Dion's followers should proceed. He desired, he says, to defend himself against slanders that had circulated about his motives and actions. Editions * Henri Estienne (ed.), Platonis opera quae extant omnia, Vol. 3, 1578, p. 323.

Blair wrote some two dozen history books and hundreds of magazine articles that reached a popular audience. Early life and military service Blair was born in Lexington, Virginia.University of Wyoming. American Heritage Center. Inventory of the Clay Blair Papers. Retrieved on July 26, 2009. Blair enlisted in the United States Navy in 1943, during World War II. During 1944 he attended Basic Enlisted Submarine School followed by Quartermaster Class A School, after which he was assigned to Sperry (AS-12), a submarine tender. During 1945, Blair was posted to the fleet submarine Guardfish (SS-217). He on that boat's last two war patrols off Japan. Blair served on Guardfish into 1946, after the war was over, then was discharged from the Navy. His highest rank was Quartermaster 2nd Class. Education and journalism career Blair attended both Tulane University and Columbia University. He attended the first as a prospective architecture student, but decided instead to go to New York and attend the Columbia School of Journalism. In the end he graduated from neither institution. Blair later wrote for Time and Life magazines. At Time- Life during the 1950s he covered the Pentagon, focusing on issues of national security and nuclear weapons policy.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, p. 140. Over the years, Blair worked for the Curtis Publishing Company as both a correspondent and an editor.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, p. 189n69. In particular he became editor-in-chief of The Saturday Evening Post during the early 1960s. During his stint there, he made an emphasis of publishing exclusive reports but also faced a series of libel suits, at least one of which was successful. Beginning in 1962, Blair was also in editorial charge of all of Curtis Publishing's other magazines in addition to the Post, and held the titles of executive vice president and directory. He departed Curtis Publishing in 1964 during a struggle for control of the company. Following that, he became a full-time freelance writer. He lived in Wisconsin but often travel to various locations to research materials for his books. He was for many years married to Joan Blair, who co-wrote some of his books. Prior to that marriage he was married to Agnes Kemp Devereux Blair, with whom he had seven children. That marriage resulted in a divorce. Historian One of Blair's first books, The Hydrogen Bomb: The Men, The Menace, The Mechanism (1954), was co-written with Times Washington bureau chief, James R. Shepley, and provoked considerable controversy at the time with its charges that the U.S. development of the hydrogen bomb had been intentionally delayed by some scientists led by J. Robert Oppenheimer and that the Los Alamos Laboratory had been infiltrated by Communists. While the book was positively reviewed across a large number of newspapers and magazines at the time of publication,Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, p. 141. several scientists who had worked at Los Alamos on the bomb's development soon issued statements refuting its narrative. Interviews conducted during the mid-to-late-1950s (but not published until many decades later) showed almost no scientists speaking well of the book, even those portrayed favorably within it.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 142, 144, 189n61. Subsequent scholarship has established that the Shepley and Blair account was largely inaccurate and was guided by stark H-bomb proponent, and Oppenheimer antagonist, Lewis Strauss.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 139‚Äì147. Blair later earned trust as a collaborator when he assisted General Omar Bradley in the writing of his autobiography, A General's Life (1983), published after the general's death. Blair's history of the Korean War The Forgotten War: America in Korea, 1950‚Äì1953 (1987) is considered one of the definitive historical works on the war. This work was notable for its criticism of senior American political and military leaders. Blair criticizes President Harry S. Truman and his Secretary of Defense, Louis A. Johnson, for failing to maintain the military's readiness in the years immediately following World War II. His history, while comprehensive, primarily employs a top-down perspective, with less emphasis on individual soldiers than on larger operational issues and the perspectives of general and field-grade officers. He has also been criticized by some historians for not making sufficient use of Communist sources.Gifford, 224‚Äì228. Blair also wrote extensively on the submarine war of World War II, notably in the bestselling Silent Victory: The U.S. Submarine War Against Japan (1975), considered the definitive work on the Pacific submarine war. Silent Victory was also Blair's most popular book. It, and several other of this works, were selected by various kinds of book of the month clubs, a target audience that Blair and his wife aimed at. Blair's last books were Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunters, 1939‚Äì1942 (1996), followed by Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunted, 1942‚Äì1945 (1998). The first of these was criticized by Gary E. Weir of the U.S. Naval Historical Center. Weir pointed out the lack of footnotes in the text, Blair's inability to read German and dependence on translations, his failure to consult the German Federal Military Archives or Michael Salawski's book Die deutsche Seekriegsleitung, 1935-1945 as well as his \\"painfully obvious bias in favor of the U.S. Navy, and expressions of stereotypical sarcasm aimed at the French and Italians.\\" Weir said that Blair \\"missed the point\\" by failing to appreciate the \\"technically and strategically revolutionary\\" nature of the Type XXI U-boat and preferring to focus on \\"solvable engineering problems\\". Weir dismissed Blair's fundamental assumptions and theses on the German Navy as primitive and anachronistic and called Hitler's U-Boat War a \\"handicapped chronicle\\". Novelist Blair also published fiction, such as Pentagon Country (1970). His novels tended to have military settings and focus on themes of ambition and hypocrisy. Death Blair died on Washington Island, Wisconsin, of a heart attack.

It was established in conjunction with the other components of Armenia's military on January 28, 1992, several months after the republic declared its independence from the Soviet Union.Balance in Europe 2011\\"., March 07, 2011. The army's first head was the former deputy commander-in-chief of the main staff of the Soviet Ground Forces, Norat Ter-Grigoryants.Petrosyan, David. \\"Formation and Development of Armenian Armed Forces.\\" Moscow Defence Brief. Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, Moscow, 6-2002, accessed November 2009. Ter-Grigoryants had previously served with the 40th Army (Soviet Union) in Afghanistan as chief of staff, supervising operations in May 1982. Since the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War, Armenia has committed many elements of the army to help bolster the defense and defend the unrecognized Republic of Artsakh from a possible renewal of hostilities with neighboring Azerbaijan. Jane's World Armies reports that both conscripts and officers from Armenia are routinely sent for duty to Artsakh, often posted to the frontline between Artsakh Armenian and Azerbaijani forces.  History  An Armenian fedayi group fighting under the Armenian Revolutionary Federation banner, ca. 1890s. The Armenian army's history is described to have gone through three stages of development. It entered the first stage in February 1988, from the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, when Armenian militias were formed to combat Azerbaijani units in Artsakh. On 20 September 1990, the first military unit was created, the Yerevan Special Regiment, with the first oath being held in the Republican Assembly Point and was attended by the first President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Prime Minister Vazgen Manukyan, Vazgen Sargsyan. The second phase of the development of the army began in 1992, several months after Armenia declared its independence from the Soviet Union. Ter-Grigoryants and civilian officials in the Armenian Ministry of Defense, including Vazgen Manukyan and Vazgen Sargsyan, sought to establish a \\"small, well-balanced, combat-ready defense force.\\"Curtis, Glenn E. and Ronald G. Suny. \\"Armenia,\\" in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia Country Studies, ed. Glenn E. Curtis. Washington D.C.: Federal Research Division Library of Congress, 1995, p. 72. The third phase began after the end of the war and continues to today. Most of the army's staff officers were members of the former Soviet military. An estimated 5,000 Armenians were serving as high-level officers in the military at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union.Mirsky, Georgiy I. On Ruins of Empire: Ethnicity and Nationalism in the Former Soviet Union. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1997, p. 63. . Almost immediately after its independence, Armenia was embroiled in the Nagorno-Karabakh War with neighboring Azerbaijan. Intending to establish a force of 30,000 men, the army's standing force increased to 50,000 by early 1994. During the war, the military remained on high alert and bolstered defenses in the region of Zangezur, opposite the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhichevan. Purported artillery bombardment in May 1992 from the region led to skirmishes between the two sides, including the Armenian army's incursion into several villages into Nakhichevaan. Since 1994, the army has taken an active role in ensuring the defense of the Republic of Artsakh in conjunction with the Artsakh Defense Army.See Richard Giragosian, \\"Armenia and Karabakh: One Nation, Two States .\\" AGBU Magazine. ‚Ññ 1, Vol. 19, May 2009, pp. 12-13.

Latin speakers at first used afer as an adjective, meaning \\"of Africa\\". As a substantive, it denoted a native of Africa; i.e., an African. The ultimate etymology of the term for the country remains uncertain. It may derive from a Punic term for an indigenous population of the area surrounding Carthage. (See Terence for discussion.) The name is usually connected with Phoenician  øafar \\"dust\\"Venter & Neuland, NEPAD and the African Renaissance (2005), p. 16 (also found in other Semitic languages), but a 1981 hypothesisNames of countries , Decret and Fantar, 1981. asserted that it stems from the Berber ifri (plural ifran) \\"cave\\", in reference to cave dwellers.Geo. Babington Michell, \\"The Berbers\\", Journal of the Royal African Society, Vol. 2, No. 6 (January 1903), pp. 161-194. (See Tataouine.) The same word may be found in the name of the Banu Ifran from Algeria and Tripolitania, a Berber tribe originally from Yafran (also known as Ifrane) in northwestern Libya.Edward Lipinski, Itineraria Phoenicia, Peeters Publishers, 2004, p. 200. . The classical historian Flavius Josephus asserted that descendants of Abraham's grandson Epher invaded the region and gave it their own name. This ethnonym provided the source of the term Africa. The Romans referred to the region as Africa terra (land of the Afri), based on the stem Afr- with the adjective suffix -ic, giving Africus, Africa, Africum in the nominative singular of the three Latin genders. Following the defeat of Carthage in the Third Punic War, Rome set up the province of Africa Proconsularis. Afer came to be a cognomen for people from this province. The Germanic tribe of the Vandals conquered the Roman Diocese of Africa in the 5th century; the empire reconquered it as the Praetorian prefecture of Africa in AD 534. The Latin name Africa came into Arabic after the Islamic conquest as Ifriqiya.Names of countries , Decret & Fantar, 1981 The name survives today as Ifira and Ifri-n- Dellal in Greater Kabylie (Algeria). A Berber tribe was called Banu Ifran in the Middle Ages, and Ifurace was the name of a Tripolitan people in the 6th century.

The route, assigned in the late 1920s, is the last remaining F-X designation in Vermont. F-X route designations were previously used for roads leading to ferries across Lake Champlain. VT F-5's western terminus is at the Charlotte‚ÄìEssex Ferry traversing Lake Champlain, which links VT F-5 with New York State Route 22 (NY 22) on the opposite side of the lake. The eastern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Route 7 (US 7) in Charlotte. It is known as Ferry Road for its entire length. Route description VT F-5 heading westward from US 7 towards the Charlotte‚ÄìEssex Ferry From the Charlotte‚ÄìEssex Ferry dock on the east bank of Lake Champlain in Charlotte, VT F-5 curves to the east for a short time before turning to the north. After a half-mile, Ferry Road and VT F-5 turn for the final time, making an eastward turn onto a straightway that leads to US 7\\\\. Despite the lack of curves on the straightaway, the hilly terrain of the area makes navigating the road a challenge at times. History VT F-5 was assigned in the late 1920s as part of a series of 11 F-X routes connecting ferries across Lake Champlain from New York to the remainder of the Vermont state highway system. The routes were numbered from VT F-1 to VT F-10 (with one suffixed route, VT F-9A) and assigned in order from north to south, with VT F-1 connecting to the northernmost ferry between the two states. A 12th route, VT F-10A, was added ca. 1930, but merged with VT F-9 by the following year.Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering Over the next three decades, many of the F-X routes were eliminated or renumbered to standard numerical designations as all but four Lake Champlain ferries ceased operations. By the early 1960s, only two F-X routes remained: VT F-5 and VT F-3, a loop route on Grand Isle serving the Grand Isle‚ÄìPlattsburgh Ferry.

NX-26927 was a Lockheed P-38 Lightning being test- flown for acceptance by the Government of Bolivia by Erick Rios Bridoux of the Bolivian Air Force. The two aircraft collided in mid-air at an altitude of 300 feet about half a mile southwest of the threshold of Runway 3 at Washington National Airport, killing all 55 aboard the DC-4 and seriously injuring the pilot of the P-38.

Turn Left. TIME, November 14, 1949. Retrieved August 25, 2009 The tower controllers on duty that day at National testified that the P-38 had taken off on Runway 3, turned left north of The Pentagon, circled over Arlington, then returned, requesting permission to land due to engine trouble. The controller cleared the aircraft to join the left traffic pattern, but instead it flew south of the airport and entered a long straight-in approach at the same time Flight 537 was turning onto a shorter final. The controller then called Flight 537 ordering it to turn left; it began the turn, but by then the P-38, being considerably faster than a DC-4 on final, overtook the aircraft 1/2 mile southwest of the threshold of Runway 3. The DC-4 was cut in half by the left propeller of the P-38 just forward of the trailing edge of the wing. The aft portion of the DC-4 fell to the ground on the west bank of the Potomac River; other pieces were located in Alexandria, Virginia at the Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac Railroad Potomac Yard and on a highway passing near the Yard. The fore portion of the aircraft fell into the river, as did the P-38. Air Force Sergeant Morris J. Flounlacker hauled the weakly treading Bridoux out of the Potomac, just as the wounded pilot lost consciousness. At Alexandria Hospital, doctors found he had a broken back, crushed ribs and serious contusions. Bridoux contradicted much of the tower controllers' testimony when he spoke to Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigators. He claimed he had taken off from Runway 36, had been in constant contact with the tower, and had been explicitly cleared to land on Runway 3 under the call sign \\"Bolivian 927\\". However, the testimony of both the tower personnel and a military controller listening in on the frequency from his position at Bolling Air Force Base (as well as other discrepancies in the P-38 pilot's testimony) led the CAB to discount Bridoux's version of events. As Bridoux spoke and understood English well, it was thought that language difficulties played no part in the accident. The CAB determined the primary probable causes of the accident to be the P-38 pilot's decision to land without proper clearance and his failure to exercise normal vigilance in looking out for conflicting traffic. The CAB also found that the tower controllers failed to exercise due vigilance in not notifying the pilots of Flight 537 earlier as to the critical traffic situation developing. However, the report also states that even if Flight 537 had received earlier advice with respect to the P-38's location, it might still have been too late to avoid the accident, as Bridoux's actions left Flight 537 only a few seconds in which to turn. Among the dead on Flight 537 were Congressman George J. Bates, New Yorker cartoonist Helen E. Hokinson, and former Congressman Michael J. Kennedy.

Plankeye's style could be defined as melodic post-grunge combined with indie and alternative elements. Their first few albums also incorporated a fair amount of punk rock elements, but this aspect faded when original singer Scott Silletta left the band. History In 1994, Plankeye released Spill, their first album, which was able to garner enough sales to catch the interest of Tooth and Nail Records. Spill was re-released on Tooth and Nail, as Plankeye went into the studio again to record a slightly less aggressive album, The Spark. In 1996, Plankeye released Commonwealth, which introduced a more polished and mature sound. Over the course of the next year, the group toured constantly, opening for the Newsboys. In November 1997, the group released their best selling album, The One & Only. To promote this album, Plankeye headlined \\"The One & Only Tour\\", featuring opening act, the Insyderz. One year later, lead singer Scott Silletta and drummer Adam Ferry left Plankeye. Adam Ferry left to become a youth pastor and Scott Silletta left to form the short-lived pop-punk band Fanmail. Silletta later formed a record label called \\"Vanishing Point Records\\" with a lineup including his new band \\"The Franchise\\". He also created his own recording studio called Orange Crush Studio located in Orange, California. In 1999, Balmer and Garcia released Relocation on a new record label, BEC Recordings. This album featured Plankeye's heartfelt single, \\"Goodbye\\". Some wondered if this song was subtly referencing Scott and Adam's departure from the band, something which Eric and Luis refuted. In 2001, Plankeye's song, \\"When It Comes\\", was chosen by MP3.com to be included on their radio show 'The Download'. Plankeye beat out 12,000 or so other Alternative bands on MP3.com to get on the show. In spring of 2001, Kevin Poush and Louie Ruiz joined Plankeye to record Plankeye's most experimental album to date, Strange Exchange.

The state park occupies bordering Meshomasic State Forest and is accessible from State Route 85. In addition to its deep forest, millpond, and marshland, the park bears trace remnants (foundations, stone walls, and ditches) of the mill town that occupied the site for most of the 19th century. The park is managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. History Looking southward at the Blackledge River from a foot bridge at the southernmost point on the border between Connecticut's Gay City State Park and Meshomasic State Forest. The isolated hollow on the Blackledge River was first settled by religious leader Elijah Andrus and his followers in 1796. A succession of ill- fated mills marked the town's history‚Äîthe first built around 1800 and the last burning down in 1879. Village history has also been burdened with tales of community tensions caused by the free use of alcohol during twice weekly religious services and of grisly murders gone unpunished. Following construction of a sawmill and wool mill, the village became known as Factory Hollow and grew to about 25 families, many of whom bore the surname Gay. The wool mill's commercial success ended with the War of 1812; the mill burned down in 1830. A paper mill revived the village's fortunes but it too fell victim to fire, leading to the village's ultimate demise. The property was sold to the state by one of the town's last descendants in 1943, at which time the name Gay City was bestowed on the site. A year later the land became a state park, then entered the official roles as Connecticut's 54th state park, with 680 acres, in 1946. Activities and amenities Gay City Connecticut State Park Split Rock Formation The park offers pond fishing and swimming, picnicking, and a youth campground. The park's trail system, which is used for hiking and cycling, includes a five-mile trail that tours the entire park. Trails also connect Gay City to Blackledge Falls in Glastonbury and through the surrounding Meshomasic State Forest to Birch Mountain Road in Glastonbury where the Case Mountain trail system can be accessed.

The song is a dramatic and despairing ballad, in which Martini sings about two \\"old lovers\\" who happen to meet in a bar. She sings that they have \\"left their families, betrayed their friends\\" as part of their quest for \\"another youth\\", still \\"they don't want advice about how to be happy\\". They ask themselves \\"who they really are\\", as they sit there \\"worn out, ashamed, yet sincere\\", wondering \\"why it all had to end\\", confessing that they can't get \\"this life\\" to work out. The entire situation is described as \\"this immense and hopeless rhapsody\\", and as the old lovers leave the bar ‚Äì and each other ‚Äì they both become \\"songs of once upon a time\\". The song was performed nineteenth on the night, following Denmark's Kenny L√ºbcke & Lotte Nilsson with \\"Alt det som ingen ser\\" and preceding Yugoslavia's \\"Extra Nena\\" with \\"Ljubim te pesmama\\".

It was directed by Chuck Jones. It stars Bugs Bunny, who was voiced by Mel Blanc. The Stacey's (pun on Macy's) manager was voiced by Dick Nelson. The title is a play on \\"air conditioned\\"; before air conditioning became widely used, it was sometimes advertised as incentive for the public to visit department stores, where they could avoid the heat of a hot day and, ideally for the store, make purchases. Hare Conditioned was the second Bugs Bunny cartoon in the Looney Tunes series. Hare Conditioned uses many of the same limited animation techniques which Jones had previously introduced in The Dover Boys two years prior, including rapid motions and sliding backgrounds. Plot Bugs is revealed to be on display in the \\"Stacey's Department Store\\" window, helping to advertise camping gear. After closing time, Bugs retires to have a well- earned carrot. The store manager appears and informs Bugs that since the summer sale's over, he's being transferred to another department, which Bugs puzzles over (\\"tax-ee-doy-mee?\\") The man tells the rabbit he will look splendid... after he has been \\"stuffed\\". Right after Bugs does what he thinks could be a suitable pose, he ponders this for a second. Upon realizing that the manager intends to cut him open to be \\"stuffed,\\" Bugs screams and begins a cartoon-long chase. The manager then chases Bugs into the jewelry department with a gun and fires when he catches sight of Bugs' ears sticking up from a counter. Bugs moves his ears so the bullets miss, but seems to raise his hands in surrender. As the manager gloats that he'll finish Bugs off, Bugs pops out from behind the counter (revealing that the raised hands were just a pair of gloves on the tips of his ears), armed with a gun as well, and states he'll finish off the manager. He pulls the trigger, to which the gun sticks out three \\"bang\\" signs, prompting the manager to stick three \\"ouch\\" signs out of his mouth. When the manager laughs that he outsmarted Bugs, Bugs distracts him, saying that he sounds \\"just like that guy on the radio: The Great Gildersneeze!\\" Bugs is right, the voice is a good imitation of Harold Peary's character in The Great Gildersleeve. The actor providing that voice here is uncredited, although most animation historians seem to agree it was Dick Nelson (for unknown reasons, Blanc dubbed one line for him). The manager gushes over this comment, and Bugs swipes the gun away, making it go off in the process. The manager demands to know if Bugs had been trying to outsmart him, to which Bugs innocently states that he just did and gives the manager a wacky kiss on the nose. The manager then chases after Bugs into the ladies' department, where he sees a customer (Bugs in disguise). Bugs asks for a pair of bedroom slippers, to which the gushy manager removes Bugs' high heel and tickles his feet. While they're laughing, Bugs falls to the floor, revealing that what the manager was tickling was actually a mannequin leg, to which Bugs wiggles his real toe and escapes. The manager then chases Bugs through several departments where they each wear the outfit associated with that department (little boys, Turkish Baths, costume, sports). Bugs then blows his cover when the manager sees Bugs isn't wearing any lingerie. As Bugs rushes upstairs, the manager gets into the elevator, where Bugs (in disguise again) brings him down. Just as the manager gets wise after exiting, Bugs tricks him into getting aboard another elevator going up, where the manager sees multiple Bugs's thumbing lifts on the elevator on each floor. Just as he comes back down, Bugs shoves the manager out of the elevator, making the manager rush up hundreds of flights of stairs to the top of the building. Once at the top, Bugs pushes the manager down a shaft with an elevator under repair. Bugs then listens to the manager crash to the ground floor, and while he remarks 'What a dope. What a maroon.', the manager, looking worse for wear, zips back up ready to strangle Bugs. Just when Bugs is about to be captured, he distracts the man again by tricking him into thinking there is a \\"frankincense\\" monster behind him, just like in a good book he just read. When he looks behind, Bugs has leaped into position, making a hideous face. The frightened man leaps off the building with a scream. Bugs tut-tuts, then pulls out a mirror, makes the same face to himself, turns to the audience in horror, and then he leaps off the building with a scream, thus ending the cartoon. Analysis The camping scene, soon revealed to be part of the window display for a department store is an outdoor recreation turned into an illusion. The taxidermy department represents \\"a more deadly artificial display on nature\\". Robin L. Murray and Joseph K. Heumann argue that these serve as monuments to a disappearing natural world.Murray, Heumann (2011), p. 17 This animated short contains a reference to wartime shortages. Bugs impersonates an elevator operator and introduces the items available on the sixth floor: rubber tires, girdles, nylons, alarm clocks, bourbon, butter. Then he makes clear these are only available as picture postcards. These were indeed rare items during World War II.Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 181 Bugs scares the store manager and himself by doing an impersonation of \\"a horrible Frankincense monster\\". This serves as an indirect reference to Frankenstein's monster.Picart, Smoot, Blodgett (2001), p. 147-148Glut (2002), p. 102 Availability This cartoon is found on Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2.

Assistant coaching career Crean spent two stints at Michigan State, first during the 1989-1990 season as a graduate assistant under then head coach Jud Heathcote at the behest of then assistant coach Tom Izzo, whom Crean had befriended on the summer camp circuit. From 1990 to 1994 Crean served as the associate head coach under Ralph Willard at Western Kentucky. When Willard left Western Kentucky to become head coach at Pittsburgh in 1994, Crean was considered to replace him as head coach. Ultimately Crean followed Willard to Pittsburgh, serving as associate head coach for one year. In 1995, Crean returned to Michigan State as assistant coach under the leadership of Tom Izzo. Izzo and Crean became such good friends that Crean lived in Izzo's house and Izzo was an usher in Crean's wedding. According to Crean at the time, \\"It was a great opportunity for me to go back home. We've been friends a long time. I don't think I would have left Ralph for anything else.\\" During this period Crean served at various times as recruiting coordinator and, for the last two seasons, associate head coach. In each of Crean's four seasons, Michigan State's win total increased, culminating with a 33-5 season and a 15-1 Big Ten ledger in 1999. Michigan State later went on to honor Crean with a 2000 National Championship ring; even though he wasn't on the staff at the time, he'd helped recruit and develop many of the players on the title team. Marquette University Crean on January 17, 2007 coaching at Freedom Hall On March 30, 1999, Crean was named head coach at Marquette University. According to Crean, \\"Once Marquette became available, that's where my sights were. I had unbelievable respect for the tradition and the name. When I thought of Marquette, I thought of a true basketball school and to me that had a lot to do with it.\\" Crean immediately made a number of changes at Marquette, creating a new team image by increasing the significance of the team's media day and instituting a \\"Midnight Madness\\" event commonly held by schools on the night teams are allowed to begin practice. Crean's first recruiting class was considered by experts to be among the top twenty in the country, Marquette's first in a long time. In his nine years with Marquette, Crean's teams earned five NCAA Tournament bids, one more than the previous four Marquette coaches had in the 16 years prior to his arrival. During his tenure there Crean recruited, developed and coached a number of skilled players that made significant contributions in both the NCAA and NBA, including Dwyane Wade, Dominic James, Steve Novak, and Travis Diener. Over his final seven seasons at Marquette, Crean compiled an aggregate record of 160-68 (.702). The 2002-03 season was one of the best in Marquette history. The team made a Final Four appearance for the first time since winning the NCAA Championship in 1977. Crean has referred to the team's run as \\"one of the greatest four or five days of my life.\\" Later that year, Marquette accepted an offer to leave Conference USA for the Big East Conference after the 2004-2005 season. Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese cited his friendship with Crean as contributing to the invitation, saying, \\"That, to me, was one of the great appeals, to get Tommy as well as Marquette into the league.\\" Indiana University On April 1, 2008, Crean was hired as head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers, succeeding interim head coach Dan Dakich. Dakich had replaced former coach Kelvin Sampson, who resigned after NCAA recruiting violations. Between Crean's hiring and the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season, freshman Eric Gordon opted to leave early for the NBA and star forward DJ White graduated. Two players kicked off the team by Dakich were not allowed back by Crean, one was dismissed by Crean and two transferred.Decker, John. Thomas Dismissed, Ellis and Bassett Also Gone. Hoosier Nation, May 2, 2008. As a result, Crean began with a roster consisting only of two walk-ons who had scored a combined 36 points in their careers. Despite the long odds, Crean was known to approach games and practices as if Indiana could compete in each one and to continue stressing Hoosier Hysteria and the long tradition of success at the school. He was well aware that he was walking into a difficult situation. However, when asked why he left Marquette, Crean replied, \\"It's Indiana. It's Indiana, and that is the bottom line.\\"Crean: It's Indiana and that is the bottom line\\". Inside Indiana Business, April 10, 2008. With a depleted roster and damaged recruiting lure, Crean's first three seasons saw consecutive losing records of 6‚Äì25 (the worst in school history), 10-21, and 12-20. However, during this period Crean's recruiting classes progressively improved, most notably with the signing of five-star recruit and McDonald's All-American Cody Zeller, an Indiana native. Zeller was the highest ranked recruit to join the Indiana program since the Sampson era. Despite his difficult early years at Indiana, Crean did much to establish goodwill with the fans. For instance, at the first \\"Midnight Madness\\" festivities before his first season, Crean brought back \\"Martha the Mop Lady,\\" the subject of a popular ad that opened Hoosier basketball games on WTTV for 30 years. It featured a cleaning lady whistling \\"Indiana, Our Indiana\\" while cleaning Assembly Hall. Since the actress who had appeared in the original ads was unavailable, singer Sheila Stephen stepped in as the new Martha. Starting with the 2010‚Äì11 season, video of the original ad was shown at home games after the National Anthem and right before tip off. Later, the video was shown just before the Hoosiers took the court. The 2011-2012 season was a watershed one for Crean and the program, which saw a 27‚Äì9 record and a sweet 16 appearance. The season also saw home wins over #1-ranked Kentucky (on a buzzer-beater at the end of regulation), #2-ranked Ohio State, and #5-ranked Michigan State. This made Crean the first Indiana coach to defeat the #1- and #2-ranked teams in the same season and the first Indiana squad ever to defeat three programs ranked in the top five in a single season. The Hoosiers earned a number four seed in the 2012 NCAA Tournament and defeated New Mexico State in the Round of 64. After defeating VCU in the Round of 32, the Hoosiers lost in the Sweet Sixteen to rival Kentucky, who would go on to win the national championship. The fifteen game win improvement in 2011-2012 was the largest single turnaround in the NCAA that season. Crean's guidance of the program to success from \\"unthinkable depths\\" was widely regarded as one of the most remarkable rebuilding projects in NCAA basketball history. As a result, he was named the mid-season Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year, the Sporting News Big Ten Coach of the Year,Sporting News conference awards, retrieved March 6, 2012. and the ESPN.com National Coach of the Year.Ranking the Sweet 16 field, retrieved March 20, 2012. For the 2012‚Äì13 season, Crean signed five highly touted recruits, self-dubbed \\"The Movement.\\" Combined with the returning players from the previous season, Indiana dominated the college basketball landscape, spending 10 weeks ranked #1 in the country and all but two weeks in the top 5. The Hoosiers won their first outright Big Ten regular season title in 20 years, and garnered a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, also their first in 20 years. The team, led by seniors Christian Watford and Jordan Hulls, along with eventual top-five NBA draft picks Victor Oladipo and Cody Zeller, advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament before losing to eventual Final Four participant Syracuse. The next two seasons, 2013‚Äì14 and 2014‚Äì15, the Hoosiers slipped to records of 17‚Äì15 and 20‚Äì14 with eighth and seventh-place finishes in the Big Ten, respectively. Despite these low finishes and player arrests,http://wishtv.com/2015/05/12/iu-basketball-player-arrested-on-drug- charge/ Crean was retained after appearing on many media \\"hot seat\\" lists.http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/college/indiana/2015/11/09/ius-tom- crean-leads-list-coaches-hot-seat/75472922/ After a slow start to the 2015-2016 season, Crean and the Hoosiers would eventually go on to be outright Big Ten Regular Season Champions and Crean was named by the coaches and media the Big Ten Coach of the Year. During the 2016‚Äì17 season, the Hoosiers missed the NCAA Tournament for the 5th time in 9 years under Crean despite being ranked #3 in the AP Poll earlier in the season and finished with an 18‚Äì16 record, losing in the first round of the NIT to Georgia Tech. Crean was fired by Indiana on March 16, 2017. University of Georgia On March 15, 2018, Crean was named head coach of the Georgia Bulldogs. Coaching style and philosophy Crean's basketball philosophy emphasizes fast breaks and deflections. On offense, he has a reputation for the magnitude of his offensive sets and their multitude of options, with one opposing coach estimating about 400 different sets run. Shot selection is extremely important, with a focus on spacing, inside-out attacks, penetration and kick. On defense Crean emphasizes contesting each of the opponent's steps on the court. Crean utilizes the halfcourt defense which requires great ball pressure, help from teammates, challenging shots, and defensive rebounding. Crean is considered an excellent recruiter and one of college basketball's best talent evaluators. A hallmark of Crean's programs is the notion that players are joining a family and making sure that players' families are involved in the program. Crean is also known to excel in public relations. At Marquette he began the tradition of Midnight Madness, which was seen as an immediate success. Between 1999 and 2006, Marquette saw a 70% overall increase in attendance, three total attendance records broken, and 1.5 million fans pass through the turnstiles. On the court Crean is known to walk the sidelines with an intensity normally reserved for football coaches. For inspiration, Crean has a library filled with biographies of coaches and business executives, with favorites being Jim Collins' management guide \\"Good to Great\\" and the story of Bill Belichick's rise in New England, \\"Patriot Reign\\". During his time at Indiana, Crean was criticized by fans and media for the amount of turnovers his teams committed, poor defense,http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/college/indiana/2017/01/26/iu- blown-out-start-michigan/97033978/ lack of team fundamentals, poor in-state recruiting,http://www.wdrb.com/story/34691428/bozich-whats-next-for-crean-and- indiana-the-basketball-world-wonders large numbers of players transferring,http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/college/indiana/2015/03/25/transfers- from-iu-during-the-tom-crean-regime/70434440/ and his \\"blow-by\\" handshakes of opposing coaches.  Awards and recognition  Crean has been chosen to coach a number of national teams. In 2001, he was selected by USA Basketball as one of eight coaches. In 2004, he served as an assistant coach for USA Basketball's under-20 team in the FIBA Americas World Championship. The team won its second title since the tournament.

He served as one of two Latin tutors for the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, along with Trosius Aper.Jul. Capit. Vit. Ant. c. 2. He was from the North African city of Sicca Veneria (modern El Kef in Tunisia). It is possibly this Proclus who is mentioned by Trebellius Pollio as the most learned grammarian of his age.Pollio Aemil. Tyr. For his work with the emperor, Proculus was later given senatorial rank, and a consulship,Fabric. Bibl. Graec. ix.365. though it is not clear what year he served as consul. He also required financial support from Marcus in order to carry the financial burdens of a senatorial career, so from here we may assume he was not born into a wealthy or aristocratic family. Works His writings are now lost, though there is a (probably fictitious) work occasionally attributed to him titled De peregrinis regionibus. This is likely because of some of the confusion over his identity. Some scholars through the 19th century believed that he was to be identified with the author of a Chrestomathy which is our most important source of information on the Epic Cycle.See e.g. D.B. Monro 1883, \\"On the fragment of Proclus' abstract of the Epic Cycle contained in the Codex Venetus of the Iliad\\", Journal of Hellenic Studies 4: 305-334. Most modern scholars consider this attribution likely incorrect however, as this was a Greek work and Eutychius Proclus was a grammarian of Latin. Identity There was historically some confusion over his identity based on earlier scholarship. Raffaello Maffei, the Italian historian and humanist of the 15th and 16th centuries, published information about Proculus in his Commentariorum rerum urbanarum libri XXXVIII, which was a historical source for many later writers. The work itself was quite unreliable in many places. Maffei identifies the 5th-century Platonist philosopher Proclus with \\"Tuticius Proculus\\", even though the two men lived three centuries apart, and states that the philosopher was the one who was Aurelius's tutor. Numerous other confusions stemmed from this error, including attribution of works not actually authored by him, and many later writers made similar errors based on Maffei's writings. As to his name, scholar Anthony Birley has suggested that the name \\"Eutychius\\" is actually a corruption of the text, and in all cases should properly read \\"Tuticius\\". We have an inscription from El Kef that mentions a \\"Marcus Tuticius Proculus\\" as procurator Augusti (that is, financial procurator, or CFO of a Roman province). This could be the same man, or a relative.

In mathematics, and particularly geometric graph theory, a unit distance graph is a graph formed from a collection of points in the Euclidean plane by connecting two points by an edge whenever the distance between the two points is exactly one. Edges of unit distance graphs sometimes cross each other, so they are not always planar; a unit distance graph without crossings is called a matchstick graph. The Hadwiger‚ÄìNelson problem concerns the chromatic number of unit distance graphs. It is known that there exist unit distance graphs requiring five colors in any proper coloring, and that all such graphs can be colored with at most seven colors. Another important open problem concerning unit distance graphs asks how many edges they can have relative to their number of vertices. Examples The hypercube graph Q4 as a unit distance graph. The following graphs are unit distance graphs: * Any cycle graph * Any grid graph * Any hypercube graph * Any star graph * Any matchstick graph or penny graph * The Petersen graph; * The Heawood graph * The wheel graph W7 * The Moser spindle, the smallest 4-chromatic unit distance graph Any Cartesian product of unit distance graphs produces another unit distance graph. However, the same is not true for other commonly-used graph products. Subgraphs of unit distance graphs A unit distance drawing of the M√∂bius-Kantor graph in which some nonadjacent pairs are also at unit distance from each other. Some sources define a graph as being a unit distance graph if its vertices can be mapped to distinct locations in the plane such that adjacent pairs are at unit distance apart, disregarding the possibility that some non-adjacent pairs might also be at unit distance apart. For instance, the M√∂bius-Kantor graph has a drawing of this type. According to this looser definition of a unit distance graph, all generalized Petersen graphs are unit distance graphs. In order to distinguish the two definitions, the graphs in which non-edges are required to be a non-unit distance apart may be called strict unit distance graphs.. The graph formed by removing one of the spokes from the wheel graph W7 is a subgraph of a unit distance graph, but is not a strict unit distance graph: there is only one way (up to congruence) to place the vertices at distinct locations such that adjacent vertices are a unit distance apart, and this placement also puts the two endpoints of the missing spoke at unit distance. Counting unit distances The Hamming graph(3,3) has 27 vertices and 81 unit distances posed the problem of estimating how many pairs of points in a set of n points could be at unit distance from each other. In graph theoretic terms, how dense can a unit distance graph be? The hypercube graph provides a lower bound on the number of unit distances proportional to n\\\\log n. By considering points in a square grid with carefully chosen spacing, Erd≈ës found an improved lower bound of the form :n^{1+c/\\\\log\\\\log n}, and offered a prize of $500 for determining whether or not the maximum number of unit distances can also be upper bounded by a function of this form. The best known upper bound for this problem, due to , is proportional to :n^{4/3}; this bound can also be viewed as counting incidences between points and unit circles, and is closely related to the Szemer√©di‚ÄìTrotter theorem on incidences between points and lines. Representation of algebraic numbers and the Beckman‚ÄìQuarles theorem For every algebraic number A, it is possible to find a unit distance graph G in which some pair of vertices are at distance A in all unit distance representations of G.. This result implies a finite version of the Beckman‚ÄìQuarles theorem: for any two points p and q at distance A, there exists a finite rigid unit distance graph containing p and q such that any transformation of the plane that preserves the unit distances in this graph preserves the distance between p and q. The full Beckman‚ÄìQuarles theorem states that any transformation of the Euclidean plane (or a higher-dimensional space) that preserves unit distances must be a congruence; that is, for the infinite unit distance graph whose vertices are all the points in the plane, any graph automorphism must be an isometry. Generalization to higher dimensions The definition of a unit distance graph may naturally be generalized to any higher-dimensional Euclidean space. Any graph may be embedded as a set of points in a sufficiently high dimension; show that the dimension necessary to embed a graph in this way may be bounded by twice its maximum degree. The dimension needed to embed a graph so that all edges have unit distance, and the dimension needed to embed a graph so that the edges are exactly the unit distance pairs, may greatly differ from each other: the 2n-vertex crown graph may be embedded in four dimensions so that all its edges have unit length, but requires at least n ‚àí 2 dimensions to be embedded so that the edges are the only unit-distance pairs. Computational complexity It is NP-hard, and more specifically complete for the existential theory of the reals, to test whether a given graph is a unit distance graph, or is a strict unit distance graph. It is also NP-complete to determine whether a unit distance graph has a Hamiltonian cycle, even when the vertices of the graph all have integer coordinates.

She was the youngest of ten siblings (hence, the name \\"Decima\\"). Her sister, actress Eva Moore, was the mother of actress Jill Esmond, the first wife of Laurence Olivier. Moore made her stage debut starring as Casilda in the Gilbert and Sullivan hit, The Gondoliers, in 1889 at the age of 17 and stayed with the company for two years. She then starred in a variety of West End theatre plays and musical pieces over the next two years, joining the George Edwardes company to create the ing√©nue role of Rose Brierly in the hit Edwardian musical comedy A Gaiety Girl in 1893. After touring with Edwardes's company in musicals, she returned to England and light opera later playing the role of Scent of Lilies in The Rose of Persia (1899) and starring in Florodora (1900‚Äì01) and My Lady Molly (1903), among other West End shows. In 1905, Moore married Major (later Brigadier General) Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg, moving with him to West Africa. Over the next decade, she frequently returned to England and also toured, mostly in legitimate theatre, as well as singing in concerts. In 1908, she was one of the founding members of the Actresses' Franchise League and became very active in the suffrage movement. Her last London stage appearance was in 1914. During World War I, Moore worked in France on behalf of British soldiers. In 1918 she was honoured with the CBE for her services to her country. Moore was active in charity work during her long retirement. She was the last surviving original creator of a Gilbert and Sullivan role. Life and career Moore was born in Brighton, Sussex, the ninth daughter and tenth child of Edward Henry Moore, an analytical chemist, and his wife, Emily (n√©e Strachan). Four of her sisters sang on the concert platform or the stage, including Eva (1870‚Äì1955), Jessie (d. 1910) and Bertha Moore (?-?).

Arlecchino und Colombina Giovanni Domenico Ferretti (Giandomenico), also called Giandomenico d'ImolaM. Farquhar (15 June 1692 - 18 August 1768) was an Italian Rococo style painter from Florence. According to the contemporary Giovanni Camillo Sagrestani, Ferretti was a pupil of the Bolognese painter Giuseppe Maria Crespi. Others say he worked with painter Giovanni Gioseffo dal Sole. He returned to Florence with a letter of recommendation of Cardinal Gozzadini seeking patronage from Cosimo III de' Medici. He found work in the studio of Tommaso Redi and Sebastiano Galeotti. He travelled to Bologna to work under Felice Torelli and then resettled in Florence in 1715. Ferretti soon joined the Florentine Accademia del Disegno, where he later taught painting but also designed tapestries for the Medici. He found abundant patronage in fresco painting for the Florentine Abbey (Badia Fiorentina), the Chapel of San Giuseppe in the Duomo, and the altar and cupola of the Church of San Salvatore al Vescovo. One of his most important works was the decoration of the ceiling of the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine, since lost in a fire. Ferretti's fresco style was influenced by Sebastiano Ricci's lively, colourful, and pastel-hued frescoes in the Palazzo Marucelli-Fenzi. Ferretti himself decorated the Palazzo Amati Cellesi in Pistoia, the Palazzo Sansedoni in Siena, and the Villa Flori in Pescia. The frescoes for the cupola of the cathedral of San Zeno in Pistoia are attributed to him.

Over a 20-year span, she contributed 68 covers and more than 1,800 cartoons to The New Yorker. Life and career She was born in Mendota, Illinois, the daughter of Adolph Hokinson, a farm machinery salesman, and Mary Hokinson, the daughter of Phineas Wilcox, the \\"Carpenter Orator\\". She studied at the Academy of Fine Arts (now known as the School of the Art Institute of Chicago), and worked as a freelance fashion illustrator in Chicago for department stores such as Marshall Field's. In 1920, Hokinson moved to New York City to work as a fashion illustrator and study at the School of Fine and Applied Arts (now Parsons School of Design). Encouraged by an instructor she began submitting comic drawings to magazines, and became one of the first cartoonists to be published in The New Yorker, appearing in the magazine for the first time in the July 4, 1925 issue. She specialized in wealthy, plump, and ditsy society women and their foibles, referring to them as 'My Best Girls', those dowager denizens of woman's clubs, beauty parlors, art galleries, summer resorts and Lane Bryant; they were also popularly known as ‚ÄúHokinson Women‚Äù. According to James Thurber and Brendan Gill, Hokinson relied on the magazine's staff writers to provide captions for her cartoons, a common practice at The New Yorker in the Harold Ross era, until entering into a professional partnership with James Reid Parker in 1931. Hokinson and Parker also provided a monthly cartoon, \\"The Dear Man,\\" for the Ladies' Home Journal as well as occasional cartoons for advertising campaigns and other magazines. Hokinson died in the Eastern Airlines Flight 537 mid-air collision at Washington National Airport on November 1, 1949, en route to an appearance at the opening of a Community Chest Drive in DC. She left dozens of cartoons, many of which were published by The New Yorker in subsequent months. Books In addition to her own cartoon collections, she also illustrated books by others. Her estate published three volumes of her cartoons during the 1950s. Bibliography Works by Helen Hokinson *So You're Going to Buy a Book! Minton, Balch & Co. 1931 *My Best Girls E. P.

The hotel is managed by the InterContinental Hotels Group. The chain operates over 5,000 hotels and resorts in approximately 75 nations. The Mark Hopkins is the oldest InterContinental in the United States. The 19th floor penthouse suite was converted in 1939 into the glass-walled Top of the Mark restaurant cocktail lounge. InterContinental Mark Hopkins Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.  History  Mark Hopkins Mansion c. 1890s Mark Hopkins, one of the founders of the Central Pacific Railroad, chose the southeastern peak of Nob Hill as the site for a dream home for his wife, Mary. The mansion was completed in 1878, after his death. Since the tower of the mansion was at the time the highest point in San Francisco, Eadweard Muybridge chose to shoot his 1877 panoramic photograph of the city from this location. Mary Sherwood Hopkins, on her death in 1891 at the age of 73, left the Nob Hill mansion and a $70 million estate to her second husband, Edward Francis Searles. In 1893, Searles donated the building and grounds to the San Francisco Art Association (now San Francisco Art Institute), for use as a school and museum. It was called the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art and valued at $600,000 at the time. The Mark Hopkins mansion survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; however, it was destroyed in the three-day fire that followed the earthquake. Mining engineer and hotel investor George D. Smith purchased the Nob Hill site, removed the Art Association building, and began construction of a luxury hotel. The San Francisco architectural firm Weeks and Day designed the 19-story hotel, a combination of French ch√¢teau and Spanish ornamentation. Detail of Calafia mural One of the banquet areas, \\"The Room of The Dons\\", contains a piece of California history. Nine seven-foot-high panels painted by artists Maynard Dixon and Frank Von Sloun in 1926 for the hotel's opening decorate the upper walls. One panel shows Queen Calafia and her Amazons set against a gold leaf sky. Calafia is the namesake for the state of California. During World War II, the Top Of The Mark lounge was a favored place for Pacific-bound servicemen and their sweethearts to meet before being deployed. In 1962, the hotel was sold by the original owner George D. Smith to San Francisco financier Louis Lurie. In 1973, Lurie's heirs signed a long-term management contract for the Mark Hopkins with InterContinental Hotels Corporation. Woodridge Capital Partners Affiliates and funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management acquired the hotel in 2014. The Mark Hopkins became a social center for the City, and is rated AAA Four-Diamond and has won the Gold-Key award. Landmark status A bronze plaque installed by the California State Park Commission, designating the site California Historical Landmark #754, was commissioned October 20, 1961. The plaque marks the former site of the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. The Mark Hopkins Hotel is also listed as a San Francisco Designated Landmark.

He is considered a jazz musician, though he rejects this label. Career His main influences were Sun Ra and Anthony Braxton, both connected to but \\"apart from\\" the jazz world. A short solo saxophone piece can be found on the '(Y)Earbook, Volume One' CD (on Rastascan Records, 1991), which also features music from guitarist Henry Kaiser and percussionist Greg Bendian, among others. He received his degree from Yale University and won a commission from Bang on a Can in 1999. Also in 1999, Plonsey toured the Netherlands with Steve Horowitz' Mousetrap Quartet, alongside of reed players Peter van Bergen and Michael Moore. While in the Netherlands, he engaged in one-off improvised music concerts with The Amsterdam String Trio and trumpeter Eric Boeren among others. Two notable CDs with John and Peter Hinds of \\"Sun Ra Research\\" fame were released on the tiny Omni Sonic label in 1994 and 1995: Connections and Another Curiosity Piece. Typically, his infrequent recording output consists mostly of self-produced material or extremely limited editions by connaisseur record labels like Limited Sedition. A 1997 solo CD called Ivory Bill on the American Music and Arts label highlights Plonsey's use of multiple saxophones, mostly recorded by overdubbing two or more saxophones in the recording studio. Plonsey's 1999 album open door and desire, released on the Italian Felmay label, can be seen as a further volume of solo saxophone experiments with occasionally added keyboards, played and programmed by Plonsey himself. In 2003 Plonsey wrote What Leave Behind, a concerto for electric guitar and toy orchestra, for the Oakland, California-based experimental music group Toychestra and English experimental guitarist Fred Frith to perform. A recording was released on CD in 2004. Other productions include the opera Leave Me Alone! with Real Time Opera.  Organizational work  Dan Plonsey, like Gino Robair, is also noted for his organizational contributions to the music world. Before focusing on operatic composition, he was one of the leading members of the Bay Area Improv Scene, particularly during his time at the Beanbenders music venue.

He is Britain's hero using a power-rod used by his father (The Beefeater of the Second World War), to try to protect Britain, but instead causes havoc as he goes. Michael Morice is a staff member at the Justice League London embassy. Supporting him is his wife and Esteban, the latter of whom has a poor grasp of English (both resembling characters from Fawlty Towers). Michael finds the original Beefeater's costume and power-rod in the attic. After accidentally blowing a hole in the attic floor, he is confronted by his wife, who dislikes the entire deal.

His wife, like most people, believe General Glory's adventures to be fictional comic book events, which is exactly what Glory's superior officers had wanted. Furthermore, she believes that the original Beefeater flubbed his first mission and spent the war in a Bulgarian prison, only later to use the 'stick' for tricks down at the pub. It is not made clear which version is correct, especially with the subterfuge surrounding Glory. Michael, ever determined, leaves the embassy while his wife is trying to have Esteban contact Maxwell Lord, the current League boss. After donning the costume he decides to join Justice League Europe, however the JLE Embassy's security system saw him as a threat and attacks him. The JLE, Kilowog and Beefeater try to defend themselves from the security system, leading to the destruction of the embassy itself. Morice later appears as caretaker of the JLE:s London embassy, closed down at the time. When the embassy is attacked by Despero, Beefeater and the JLI Interpol liaison, Inspector Camus, bravely battle the alien conqueror, but are savagely beaten. They survive, though, and stick together for some time.Justice League of America vol. 2 #37-40 (April‚ÄìJuly 1990) 52 Beefeater appears in 52, week 18 (Day 4), carrying Booster Gold's coffin after attending a memorial in a Cincinnati church.

Former garden elevation The palace, commissioned by Jan Fryderyk Sapieha, Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, was built in Rococo style in 1731-1746 by Johann Sigmund Deybel. It was constructed as a French-style city palace, so-called H√¥tel particulier. At that time it consisted of five- axial main buildings (corps de logis) and two outbuildings between the palace and a street. Between 1741-1742 the existing one-story outbuilding was connected with the main outbuilding of the palace complex, and between 1771-1790 another wing was erected to connect the inhabited corps de logis with the second outbuilding. In 1818‚Äì1820 the palace was converted into the Sapieha Barracks (Koszary sapie≈ºy≈Ñskie) for the use of the army. The Neo- Classical remodelling in the early 19th century was the work of Wilhelm Henryk Minter. During the November Uprising of 1830‚Äì1831 it served as the barracks for the famous Polish 4th Infantry Regiment (Czwartacy). Destroyed in 1944 by German occupying forces, it was rebuilt in the 1950s by Maria Zachwatowiczowa.

They are dedicated to the instruction and care of the neediest of the world. Moye saw the lack of educational opportunities for females in the rural sectors of his large parish in the then Duchy of Lorraine, soon to be a part of France. It took its final form in 1852. The General Motherhouse of the larger congregation is in Saint-Jean-de-Bassel, Moselle, France. The Sisters of this congregation serve on four continents. They both use the postnominal initials of C.D.P.. History Origins Jean Martin Moye was a parish priest in the area of Lorraine, France. Concerned about the lack of educational opportunities for young women and girls, and the general ignorance in the region about the faith, Father Moye instructed several young women. On 14 January 1762, Moye sent out four literate women, under the leadership of Marguerite LeComte, whom he had recruited to teach in the remote hamlets of the region what was needed for the improvement of the peoples' lives, as well as the Catholic faith. These women were to live alone and without provisions, like the first Christians, sharing in the daily labor of the local populace and trusting in God's Divine Providence to provide for them. Though pious, the women lacked any formal knowledge of teaching. Moye trained them in child psychology, in order to prepare them to teach effectively and in a Christian manner, instructing all those whom they met. They were instructed to provide special help to the less gifted and to the poor who had become distasteful to others from the situations of their lives. This innovative ministry by single women quickly came under criticism by some for this irregular behavior. In their first year of operation, the association was suppressed by the religious authorities. They did not, however, close the schools opened by the women, which immediately began to expand. Father Moye gave them the title ‚ÄúPoor Sisters of the Child Jesus‚Äù, but the villagers called them \\"Poor Sisters of Providence\\", which was given to the women by the villagers. Moye later traveled to China to do missionary work, then returned to France to administer the new congregation. Driven into exile during the French Revolution, in 1793 he succumbed to typhus contracted while nursing fellow refugees, and was beatified by Pope Pius XII in 1954. His feast day is celebrated on May 4. Restoration and division The French Revolution caused the closing of the schools of the congregation and scattered the Sisters. The loss of their founder and guide left the Sisters uncertain as to their future. When two priests returned from exile to Lorraine, they guided the surviving Sisters in re-forming the community. The German-speaking Sisters established a base in the town of Saint Jean de Bassel in 1827, opening schools throughout Moselle and Alsace. The French-speaking Sisters were headquartered in Portieux, serving the Department of Vosges. The two groups separated into separate congregations in 1852. The Sisters of Providence of Portieux continue to serve in that region as a congregation of diocesan right. In 1905, during the French Protectorate of Cambodia, these Sisters opened a mission in Battambang, where they operated a hospital and orphanage. Expansion The Sisters began to establish an international presence in 1866, with a mission to the United States. In 1868 they sent a small group of Sisters to Algeria, who returned to France in 1871. During that period, they began to expand into new forms of service, opening a trade school for boys in Lixheim that same year, as well as ones to train girls in housekeeping. In 1879 Sisters began to serve in Belgium, and in 1889 a new mission was sent to the United States in Kentucky. During World War II, Alsace was again made part of Germany, and the Sisters faced the anti-Catholic regulations of the Nazi regime, under which their schools were closed. Many Sisters fled to the part of the region under the government of Vichy France until the end of the war. A few, however, stayed and operated clandestine private schools at great personal risk. After the war, a mission to Madagascar was established in 1950, in response to a request to staff a sanatorium there. The Sisters began to serve in the French Department of Mayotte in the Pacific region, their first presence in a Muslim country. They served there until 1988. They expanded to Ecuador in 1982. Presence At present, the Sisters of Divine Providence serve in Belgium, Comoros, Ecuador, France, Madagascar, Mali, Poland and the United States. They have served briefly in Algeria, Germany, Ghana and Romania. The congregation was divided in 1999 into three provinces: * The European Province, with its motherhouse in Saint Jean de Bassel, numbers about 400 Sisters, serving in Belgium, France and Poland. * The Madagascar Province currently numbers about 100 members, most of whom are native Malagasys. * The American Province, established in 1889, is based in Melbourne, Kentucky, and has 115 Sisters serving in the United States and Ecuador. It currently has 115 members. Legacy The first overseas mission of the congregation was established in 1866 in the United States. The Sisters were recruited by Claude Dubuis, the Bishop of Galveston, Texas, to teach in the rural towns of his diocese. It developed into an autonomous congregation in 1886, with its motherhouse in San Antonio, Texas. This congregation has a province in Mexico. They operate Our Lady of the Lake University and Providence High School in San Antonio. Another congregation which has a connection to this one is that of the Sisters of Providence of Ruill√©-sur-Loir, France, founded in 1806, whose founder adopted the Rule of Life and religious habit of this congregation. An offshoot of the Ruill√©-sur-Loir congregation is the American congregation of the Sisters of Providence of St. Mary of the Woods, based in Indiana.

He nonetheless refused to endorse Molinaro, instead endorsing Stephanie Miner, a Democrat running against Cuomo on a third-party line. On April 26, DeFrancisco announced that he would not seek re-election to the Senate in November. Personal life DeFrancisco and his wife, Linda, have three children and eight grandchildren. They reside in DeWitt, New York. DeFrancisco plays the saxophone; according to Russ Tarby of Syracuse New Times, he \\"blows a mean sax on Night Train.\\" He is a Roman Catholic.

During a five-year Major League career, Frost played for the White Sox (1978), California Angels (1978‚Äì1981), and Kansas City Royals (1982). Frost made his MLB debut on September 11, 1977 against the California Angels at Anaheim Stadium. He turned in a quality start, pitching 6 innings and giving up just two earned runs. He struck out three, walked none, and received a no decision in the 5-4 White Sox loss. His first big league win came a week later in another great start against the Angels, this time at Comiskey Park. He went 7 innings, gave up three runs, and won 7‚Äì3. He was traded along with Brian Downing and Chris Knapp to the Angels for Bobby Bonds, Richard Dotson and Thad Bosley on December 5, 1977.Durso, Joseph. \\"Angels‚Äô Bonds Is Acquired By White Sox,\\" The New York Times, Tuesday, December 6, 1977.

He spent some of the period of the Taliban's administration in the United States of America, and became an American citizen. Early political career In the mid-1960s Wardak held the position of Deputy Governor of Badakhshan ProvinceRoyal Audience. Kabul Times. vol. iv. no. 71. June 19, 1965 In the 1970s he served as Governor of Badakhshan Province and Governor of Laghman Province. Governor of Paktia Wardak was appointed Governor of Paktia province in Afghanistan in the winter of 2002. He served for only a few months due to opposition from local warlord Pacha Khan Zadran. Minister of the Interior According to Guantanamo captive Hafizullah Shabaz Khail, in testimony before his Combatant Status Review Tribunal Taj Mohammed Wardak was the first governor Hamid Karzai appointed for the Province of Paktia. Summarized transcripts (.pdf) , from Hafizullah Shabaz Khail's Combatant Status Review Tribunal - pages 11-21 Khail said he was appointed the District Chief of Zormat because the new governor, Taj Mohammed, trusted him. He said Taj Mohammed Wardak was replaced, as governor, by Raz Mohammed Dalili when Hamid Karzai asked him to assume a position in Kabul. According to the BBC the \\"relatively unknown\\" Wardak was appointed Interior Minister on Wednesday, June 19, 2002. According to Islam Online Wardak's appointment raised controversy within the Ministry. They quote unnamed Ministry officials, and sentry Mohammad Halim: :\\"The interior ministry is on high alert because the people say why Qanooni Saheb has been transferred. He should come back, It is a state of high alert and strike. We do not like Wardak, because we do not know him and we want the return of Qanooni.\\" Wardak was one of several cabinet ministers Karzai appointed to a high level commission to investigate the assassination of Abdul Qadir, Vice President, and also one of Karzai's leading rivals. Qadir, like Wardak, was a Pashtun. Analysts said Karzai picked cabinet ministers from each of Afghanistan's ethnic groups, so each group would realize he was taking the investigation seriously. The commission included Vice President Mohammad Karim Khalili, Intelligence Services Director Mohammad Arif Sarwari, Rural Development Minister Mohammad Hanif Atma, and former Interim Irrigation Minister Hajji Mangal Hussain. Wardak and Karzai differed in their interpretation of the deaths of students shot during a demonstration. Karzai called the first student known to have died a \\"martyr\\". Wardak said that student was shot by other students. Wardak was replaced on January 28, 2003, by Ali Ahmad Jalali. An article published on the web-site of The Jamestown Foundation on June 23, 2004 described Wardak as a \\"presidential aide\\". 2004 elections Wardak was one of the running mates for presidential candidate Mohammad Yunos Qanuni.

They were formed in 1998 by two ex-members of The Stunning ‚Äì brothers Steve and Joe Wall. Their debut album Hi-Lo was released in 2000 and included the singles \\"Bone Deep\\", \\"Something's Wrong\\" and \\"Some Kind of a Girl\\". U2 invited The Walls to support them at their second show in Slane Castle in 2002 after the band sent them copies of their debut. A number of songs from Hi-Lo featured in movies: Goldfish Memory, On the Edge, and Dead Bodies. In 2002 they released the single \\"To the Bright and Shining Sun\\". It was used on an Irish TV commercial and became a hit in Ireland. The subsequent album New Dawn Breaking (2005) included \\"To the Bright and Shining Sun\\" and three other singles: \\"Drowning Pool\\", \\"Passing Through\\" and \\"Black and Blue\\". The 2013 movie Begin Again starring Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo features \\"Drowning Pool\\" over the opening credits. The first track on the album \\"Open Road\\" proved a favourite with Nic Harcourt on his KCRW show Morning Becomes Eclectic and he invited the band to play a session on the show in 2006. They played SXSW in Austin, Texas, a few days beforehand. The following year the band travelled to Australia and played their first shows there, opening up for Crowded House on the latter's first reunion gigs. The Walls opened the shows in Sydney and Melbourne and also performed their own gigs in both of those cities. The band's third album Stop the Lights was released in 2012. The first single \\"Bird in a Cage\\" became a firm favourite with Irish radio, in particular with Irish DJ Tony Fenton who championed them. The second single was the title track \\"Stop the Lights\\", an autobiographical story of a motorbike crash. A video was shot for the song in the brother's hometown, Ennistymon, and in the Dublin mountains. In March 2013 the band played their first shows in Russia and performed live on the Evening Urgant show. They returned the following year. In 2014 the band decided to take a break to concentrate on other projects, but they have not broken up. Drummer Rory Doyle recorded and toured with Irish band Bell X1 and also Hozier with whom he appeared on the 2015 Grammy Awards. Steve developed a new career as an actor, appearing in the History channel series Vikings and in Chris O'Dowd's Moone Boy, amongst others, including Silent Witness and Crossing Lines.

Their Camden housemate Carl Harms joined the band on guitar and keyboard duties. Drummer Rory Doyle joined soon afterwards. They set up their own label, Earshot Records (later changing it to Dirtbird Records) and recorded and released a string of singles. A remix of one of the album tracks, \\"Bone Deep\\", became a nationwide hit. Many of the songs have featured on a number of TV series and feature films such as Bachelors Walk, Dead Bodies, Goldfish Memory and On the Edge (starring Cillian Murphy). Their debut album Hi-Lo was released in May 2000. The Walls heard rumour of a second Slane Castle date for U2 in 2001 (as the first concert had sold out in hours). They sent four copies of their album to the band. Bono loved it and offered The Walls a support slot. That day the band played to their biggest crowd to date, around 80,000 people. \\"To the Bright and Shining Sun\\" was their next single. That June they supported Red Hot Chili Peppers. They spent the next year gigging while building their own studio in Dublin. In February 2004, original member Carl Harms decided to leave the band to make his own record. They recruited bassist Jon O'Connell, who had two weeks to learn all the songs before a two-week tour of the new European Union accession states: Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. \\"To the Bright and Shining Sun\\" also featured on the EA Sports soundtrack for the UEFA Euro 2004 official licensed game. Track listing 2004‚Äì2007; New Dawn Breaking For the next album, the band went to Studio Black Box in France to record with producer and ex-The Frames guitarist David Odlum. Originally scheduled for a release date in September 2004, The Walls decided to hold their album until the new year. In October 2004, they released a taster, \\"Drowning Pool\\", a blues song. It took people by surprise and divided opinion. They supported Bob Dylan to a capacity crowd in Galway that summer and played a storming set that showed there were changes afoot in The Walls sound. They christened the album New Dawn Breaking after the final track on the record. It went straight into the Irish charts at no. 5 in its first week of release in June 2005 and produced four hit singles: \\"To the Bright and Shining Sun\\", \\"Passing Through\\", \\"Drowning Pool\\" and \\"Black and Blue\\". The band kicked off 2007 with a gig in Dubai. They also supported Crowded House on their Australian comeback tour before retreating into their studio to work on their third album. Track listing 2010‚Äì2014; Stop the Lights In 2010, the double A-side \\"Carrying The Fire\\"/\\"Phantom Power\\" was released. Following this, in March 2011, the \\"Bird In A Cage\\" EP was released, of which the title track was revealed to also be on the band's forthcoming album Stop The Lights, which was to be released in 2012. Following this announcement, the band's new single \\"Stop The Lights\\" was released in January 2012. Stop the Lights, The Walls' third album, was released on 9 March 2012, going top 20 in Ireland. The singles \\"Bird in a Cage\\" and \\"Stop the Lights\\" received strong airplay. Part- funded by the band's fans, people involved in the making of it include Rob Kirwan. For the artwork a five-meter high installation was designed and constructed by 'Conor & David'. As well as playing some shows in Ireland, the band made their first trip to Russia in March 2013 playing Moscow, Bryansk and Kaluga. They played live on the Ivan Urgant TV show and on Moscow FM radio. They returned in 2014, playing three shows in Moscow. Steve Wall returned to acting, landing roles in Moone Boy for Sky TV, Vikings (MGM/History Channel), Silent Witness (BBC), Crossing Lines and Rebellion (RTE/Sundance 2016). Begin Again, the 2014 film, features The Walls' \\"Drowning Pool\\" throughout the opening credit sequence. The song is not included on the soundtrack album of the movie.

In 1937, Milne published Ostrich Heads, a book predicting an upcoming war and encouraging young Australians to become involved in public life.Biography - Milne, Kenneth Lancelot Before the outbreak of the Second World War, Milne and his wife moved to 51 Hackney Road, St. Peters. He enlisted in the Australian Defence Force on 9 November 1940 in Adelaide. Milne was a highly competent airman in the military, with his superior officer stating: Popular amongst his fellows, he [Milne] has a frank countenance and manner.National Archives of Australia - A9300 He was married to Mary on 3 May 1941 and they moved to Stanley Street, North Adelaide. Milne reached the rank of Flight Lieutenant and piloted Supermarine Spitfires during World War II. Local politics Milne was elected to the Council the Town of Walkerville in July 1961 and was immediately elected mayor. His term began on 1 July 1961 South Australian Government Gazette, 6 April 1961 and ended on 4 July 1964.South Australian Government Gazette, 26 March 1964 Milne defended the trams that extended into suburban Adelaide and wished for them to be preserved for cultural significance.From A Times Correspondent - 1 March 1963 Also during his time on the council, Milne initiated action for a free public library in Walkerville and campaigned for the establishment of the town's YMCA Youth Centre. Milne joined the Labor Party in the mid-1960s and supported the party in the 1966 Australian federal election. He resigned from the Walkerville council in December 1965 when he was appointed the Agent-General of South Australia in London by Premier Frank Walsh. Milne held many positions in the 1960s and 1970s, including President of the Municipal Association, Chairman of the Local Government Act Revision Committee, member of the Municipal Tramways Trust and Chairman of the State Government Insurance Commission. In December 1970, when the prospects of the United Kingdom joining the European Union started to grow greater, Milne said \\"If more countries go into the Common Market, it will start the gretatest war ever seen,\\" later comparing the common market to the Roman Empire, stating that both would eventually become rich and subject to external pressures.\\"War Warning\\", 10 December 1970 When his term as South Australian Agent-General ended in 1971, he was made a Freeman of London. State politician Milne was elected President of the South Australian Democrats in 1977 and was elected to the South Australian Legislative Council in September 1979, making him the first upper house member of the Parliament for the Democrats. Milne's 1979 election manifesto included policies supporting rural South Australians, subsidies on petrol, and the decentralisation of government.Democrats to Support Rural Sector - 12 September 1979 During his term, he served as the Parliamentary Leader of the South Australian Democrats. He introduced bills to ban cigarette advertising, supported environmental protection measures, opposed some state taxation measures, and spoke out against increases to parliamentarians‚Äô salaries.

He was chairman of the South Australian branch of the Royal Life Saving Society from 1974 to 1995. Towards the end of his life, Milne was very ill and was diagnosed with cancer.Biographical Cuttings of Kenneth Lancelot Milne He organised a meeting of Partnership SA to defend small businesses in December 1995. Due to illness he could not attend this meeting. In February 1996, Deputy Premier Stephen Baker told a story about Milne from November 1995: We had the annual general meeting of the Royal Life Saving Society, of which Lance was President.. He came down with Joan for that night to say hello to the people he had worked with and supported, having harassed and harangued the Government to gain better results for one of his favourite organisations. Lance was so ill that he should not have been out of bed, but he attended that meeting. That story epitomises Lance Milne, the man, who had tremendous inner strength and who had enormous regard for his fellow human beings.South Australian House of Assembly Hansard, 6 February 1996 Milne died at his home in Stirling on 27 December 1995 of cancer.

He commanded the Lithuanian Army contingent of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during the campaign to lift the Siege of Vienna by the Ottoman Turks. When the main Polish Army under the King of Poland John III Sobieski, who was nominated the Supreme Commander of the Holy League, marched on Vienna and played a decisive role in the battle, it left Poland undefended. As a result, the Lithuanian troops were drawn into a fight along the Polish border tying down the anti-Habsburg Hungarian Kuruc forces under the vassal king of Upper Hungary, Imre Th√∂k√∂ly, along the border between Upper Hungary and Poland. This punitive action on the edge of the overall campaign was successful in keeping these irregular Hungarian troops (bolstered with Ottoman levies) from either raiding into Poland or coming to the assistance of the besieging Ottoman Army when the Holy League attacked their positions outside Vienna on 12 September 1683. He was meant to break off his attack along the Hungarian border and participate in the Battle but by the time he arrived in Vienna at the head of the Lithuanian Army this famous Battle was concluded.

(API) was a very early developer of local area network technologies in the 1980s, based first in Brewster, New York, moving later to Brookfield Center, CT.Town of Brookfield, Connecticut 06804 History American Photonics, Inc., was founded in 1982 by James Walyus (1938‚Äì2000)Augusta Georgia: metro@ugusta: Mr. James Walyus 01/02/00 while he was employed by Exxon Optical Information Systems (Exxon OIS) of Elmsford, New York. His intention was to create an organization that would develop leading- edge, yet commercially viable, optical communication technologies that could be sold into large potential markets. After some initial research in networking technologies, API was contracted by Interlan (another early Ethernet networking company, subsequently acquired by Micom and then by Racal Electronics PLC) to develop an adjunct to its 10Base5 Ethernet transceivers and network interface cards (NICs, or network cards). This adjunct product was to extend the distance between the transceiver and the NIC by way of fiber optics, as the distance was severely limited by the 15-pin Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) cable used in this connection. Building upon this early success, API developed the RL1000 line of Ethernet 10Base5 transceivers. The RL1000 physical design was patterned on the rugged 3Com 3C107 transceiver, with the added feature of indicator lamps much like the Cabletron Systems ST500 transceiver,http://www.retrocomputing.net/parts/cabletron/ST500/docs/0008_02.pdf and it became relatively popular as a result. Another early Ethernet product designed by API was the RL6000 Ethernet Repeater. This unit directly competed with the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) DEREP-AA repeater, but had the advantages of being modular (allowing for fiber interfaces, Thinnet or AUI Cable interfaces) and smaller (occupying less than half the space of a DEREP- AA). Consequently, API was able to overtake DEC in sales of this product in 1984, a significant feat for a start-up in the Ethernet industry. The penultimate Ethernet product developed by API was the RL8000 Modular Ethernet Hub. This unit was released at about the same time as the Cabletron Systems MMAC-8 modular hub and the Astra Communications (soon to be SynOptics) LattisNet concentrator. The RL8000 was complete with network management software and modular AUI and fiber optic ports, and was supplied with RL3000 fiber-to-AUI adapters for the remote ends of the fiber optic cables. This product was successfully installed in its first customer application in 1986. Despite raising $6 million from investors such as Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and Mura Corp. over the course of four investment rounds, American Photonics ran aground in 1987 due to a variety of reasons, among them product distribution problems, insufficient funding for growth, and the stock market crash of October 19, 1987, also known as Black Monday. Investors brought in a CEO to replace James Walyus in November 1987 and the decision to close down was made in January 1988. The company was placed in Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and its assets sold to the public in mid-1988. The rights to the design of the RL6000 were acquired by Siecor Electro-Optic Products of Research Triangle Park, NC, but they were unable to produce the unit in quantity. Although largely forgotten at this time, API played an important role in the history of development of Ethernet technology in the early-mid 1980s. In addition to its Ethernet products, API also produced fiber optic RS232 converters and RS232-to-T1 time-division multiplexers (TDMs) which were provided on an OEM basis to Fibermux Corp. (later acquired by ADC Telecommunications) and early 850/1310 nm wavelength-division multiplexers (WDMs) and demultiplexers. API also developed, but did not commercially produce, a unique fiber optic power meter based on a design licensed from McDonnell Aircraft Corp. and 64Net, an early local networking hub product designed specifically for the Commodore 64 computer, in 1982.

New\\", The Theatre, 1 March 1896, pp. 144‚Äì45 is a genre of theatrical entertainment that was popular in Victorian England and in the New York theatre of the mid-19th century. It is a form of parody in which a well-known opera or piece of classical theatre or ballet is adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, usually risqu√© in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and often quoting or pastiching text or music from the original work. Victorian burlesque is one of several forms of burlesque. Like ballad opera, burlesques featured musical scores drawing on a wide range of music, from popular contemporary songs to operatic arias, although later burlesques, from the 1880s, sometimes featured original scores. Dance played an important part, and great attention was paid to the staging, costumes and other spectacular elements of stagecraft, as many of the pieces were staged as extravaganzas. Many of the male roles were played by actresses as breeches roles, to show off women's legs in tights, and some of the older female roles were taken by male actors. Originally short, one-act pieces, burlesques were later full-length shows, occupying most or all of an evening's programme. Authors who wrote burlesques included J. R. Planch√©, H. J. Byron, G. R. Sims, F. C. Burnand, W. S. Gilbert and Fred Leslie. History Burlesque theatre became popular around the beginning of the Victorian era. The word \\"burlesque\\" is derived from the Italian burla, which means \\"ridicule or mockery\\".The Oxford English Dictionary, which defines the word as \\"That species of literary composition, or of dramatic representation, which aims at exciting laughter by caricature of the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects; a literary or dramatic work of this kind.\\"Baldick, Chris. \\"Burlesque\\", The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms, Oxford University Press, 2008.

R. Planch√©.Adams, W. Davenport. A Book of Burlesque (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44 In these pieces, comedy stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the grand classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the everyday modern activities portrayed by the actors. For example, Olympic Revels opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing whist.Reinhardt, p. 541 In the early burlesques, the words of the songs were written to popular music, as had been done earlier in The Beggar's Opera. Later in the Victorian era, burlesque mixed operetta, music hall and revue, and some of the large-scale burlesque spectacles were known as extravaganzas.For example, H. J. Byron's 1863 Il trovatore parody, which was labelled \\"a burlesque extravaganza\\": see Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. \\"Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture\\", Cambridge Opera Journal, Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), p. 42, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 The English style of burlesque was successfully launched in New York in the 1840s by the manager and comedian William Mitchell, who had opened his Olympic Theatre in December 1839. Like the London prototypes, his burlesques included characters with nonsensical names such as Wunsuponatyme and The King of Neverminditsnamia, and made fun of all kinds of music currently being presented in the city.Rogers, Delmer D. \\"Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850\\", Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical, Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5‚Äì50, accessed 2 February 2011 Unlike pantomime, which aimed at all ages and classes, burlesque was aimed at a narrower, highly literate audience; some writers, such as the Brough brothers,Robert Barnabas Brough and his brother William Brough wrote successful burlesques, sometimes jointly and sometimes alone. Their burlesques include The Enchanted Isle (1848), Medea (1856), Masaniello (1857), The Sphinx (1849) and The Last Edition of Ivanhoe (1850).

Byron's success was attributed to his skill in appealing to the lower middle classes.Speaight, George. \\"All froth and bubble\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 1 October 1976, p. 1233 Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. From the 1850s onwards, burlesquing of Italian, French and, later in the century, German opera was popular with London audiences. Verdi's Il trovatore and La traviata received their British premieres in 1855 and 1856 respectively; British burlesques of them followed quickly. Our Lady of the Cameleon by Leicester Silk Buckingham and Our Traviata by William F. Vandervell (both 1857) were followed by five different burlesque treatments of Il trovatore, two of them by H. J. Byron: Ill Treated Trovatore, or the Mother the Maiden and the Musicianer (1863) and Il Trovatore or Larks with a Libretto (1880).Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. \\"Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture\\", Cambridge Opera Journal, Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33‚Äì66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 The operas of Bellini, Bizet, Donizetti, Gounod, Handel, Meyerbeer, Mozart, Rossini, Wagner and Weber were burlesqued. In a 2003 study of the subject, Roberta Montemorra Marvin noted: > By the 1880s, almost every truly popular opera had become the subject of a > burlesque. Generally appearing after an opera's premiere or following a > successful revival, they usually enjoyed local production runs, often for a > month or longer. The popularity of stage burlesque in general and operatic > burlesque in particular seems to have stemmed from the many ways in which it > entertained a diverse group, and the manner in which it fed and fed on the > circus-like or carnivalesque atmosphere of public Victorian London. W. S. Gilbert wrote five opera burlesques early in his career, beginning with Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack (1866), the most successful of which was Robert the Devil (1868).Stedman, p. 62 In the 1870s, Lydia Thompson's burlesque troupe, with Willie Edouin, became famous for their burlesques, by such authors as H.

The witches greet them with \\"Hail! hail! hail!\\": Macbeth asks Banquo, \\"What mean these salutations, noble thane?\\" and is told \\"These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'\\". Musically, Shakespearean burlesques were as varied as the others of the genre. An 1859 burlesque of Romeo and Juliet contained 23 musical numbers, some from opera, such as the serenade from Don Pasquale, and some from traditional airs and popular songs of the day including \\"Buffalo Gals\\", and \\"Nix my Dolly\\".Jacobs, Henry E., \\"The Bard Debunked\\", Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 31, No. 2 (Summer, 1980), pp. 294‚Äì96, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011 Sheet music from Faust up to Date The dialogue for burlesques was generally written in rhyming couplets, or, less often, in other verse forms, such as blank verse; it was notable for its bad puns. For example, in Faust up to Date (1888), a couplet reads: :Mephistopheles: \\"Along the Riviera dudes her praises sing.\\" :Walerlie: \\"Oh, did you Riviera such a thing?\\"Lubbock, Mark. \\"History of British musical theatre\\", The Complete Book of Light Opera, New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962, pp. 467‚Äì68 According to Grove, although \\"an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in travesty roles ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency.\\" Some contemporary critics took a sterner view; in an 1885 article, the critic Thomas Heyward praised Planch√© (\\"fanciful and elegant\\") and Gilbert (\\"witty, never vulgar\\"), but wrote of the genre as a whole, \\"the flashy, 'leggy', burlesque, with its 'slangy' songs, loutish 'breakdowns', vulgar jests, paltry puns and witless grimacing at all that is graceful and poetic is simply odious. ‚Ä¶ Burlesque, insensate, spiritless and undiscriminating, demoralizes both the audience and the players. It debases the public taste.\\"Heyward, Thomas, \\"Burlesque: Its Uses and Abuses\\", Tinsley's Magazine, November 1885, p. 477 Gilbert expressed his own views on the worth of burlesque: > The question whether burlesque has a claim to rank as art is, I think, one > of degree.

S., Letter to > Blanche Reives, quoted in \\"Modern Burlesque\\", The Orchestra, November 1880, > p. 104 In his 1859 Longfellow burlesque Hi-A-Wa-Tha, the American playwright Charles Walcot encapsulated the character of burlesque in the epilogue, addressed to the audience by Mrs. John Wood as Minnehaha: :Ye who love extravaganza, :Love to laugh at all things funny, :Love the bold anachronism. :And the work of paste and scissors, :And \\"the unities\\" destruction, :Nigger airs, old glees, and catches, :Interspersed with gems of Op'ra, :Jokes and puns, good, bad, and so-so, ‚Äì :Come and see this mutilation, :This disgraceful Hiawatha, Mongrel, doggerel Hiawatha!Quoted in Hewitt, Barnard. \\"Mrs. John Wood and the Lost Art of Burlesque Acting\\", Educational Theatre Journal, Vol. 13, No. 2 (May, 1961), pp. 82‚Äì85, Johns Hopkins University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 In a similar vein, ten years later, Gilbert gave an English viewpoint on burlesque, in his epilogue to The Pretty Druidess: :So for burlesque I plead. Forgive our rhymes; :Forgive the jokes you've heard five thousand times; :Forgive each breakdown, cellar-flap, and clog,Three types of dance popular in burlesque :Our low-bred songs ‚Äì our slangy dialogue; :And, above all ‚Äì oh, ye with double barrel ‚Äì :Forgive the scantiness of our apparel! Gilbert, p. 25 Gender reversal and female sexuality Ben Hur, c. 1900. Actresses in burlesque would often play breeches roles, which were male roles played by women; likewise, men eventually began to play older female roles.Hall, Edith. \\"Classical Mythology in the Victorian Popular Culture\\", International Journal of the Classic Tradition, 1999, vol. 5, issue 3, pp. 336‚Äì366, accessed 4 March 2012 These reversals allowed viewers to distance themselves from the morality of the play, focusing more on joy and entertainment than catharsis, a definitive shift away from neoclassical ideas. The depiction of female sexuality in Victorian burlesque was an example of the connection between women as performers and women as sexual objects in Victorian culture.Buszek, Maria-Elena. \\"Representing 'Awarishness': Burlesque, Feminist Transgression, and the 19th-Century Pin-up\\", The Drama Review, 1999, vol. 43, issue 4, pp. 141‚Äì162, accessed 4 March 2012 Throughout the history of theatre the participation of women on stage has been questioned. Victorian culture, according to Buszek in 2012, viewed paid female performance as being closely associated with prostitution, \\"a profession in which most women in the theatre dabbled, if not took on as a primary source of income\\". Gaiety Theatre Florence St. John in Carmen up to Data Burlesque became the specialty of London's Royal Strand Theatre and Gaiety Theatre from the 1860s to the early 1890s.Sherson, Erroll, \\"Lost London Playhouses\\", The Stage, 28 June 1923, p. 21, one of a series of articles later published in a 1925 book of same name. In the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using pastiches and parodies of popular songs, opera arias and other music that the audience would readily recognize. Nellie Farren starred as the Gaiety Theatre's \\"principal boy\\" from 1868, and John D'Auban choreographed the burlesques there from 1868 to 1891.\\"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps\\". The Times, 17 April 1922, p. 17Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, The Theatre Museum, London (2009) Edward O'Connor Terry joined the theatre in 1876. Early Gaiety burlesques included Robert the Devil (1868, by Gilbert), The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole (1877), Blue Beard (1882), Ariel (1883, by F. C. Burnand) and Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed (1883). Beginning in the 1880s, when comedian-writer Fred Leslie joined the Gaiety, composers like Meyer Lutz and Osmond Carr contributed original music to the burlesques, which were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format.\\"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies\\", The Times, 20 February 1914, p. 9 These later Gaiety burlesques starred Farren and Leslie.

A versatile and prolific scholar, he contributed to many fields of humanities, including history, archaeology, epigraphy, folklores, religion, art history, musicology, literature, and Near Eastern Studies. He published more than 100 books and about 1,000 academic articles over a career spanning more than 80 years. Jao and Ji Xianlin were considered China's two greatest humanities academics by their contemporaries. Called the \\"pride of Hong Kong\\" by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Jao has won many awards including the Grand Bauhinia Medal, the highest honour bestowed by the Hong Kong government. The Jao Tsung-I Petite Ecole of the University of Hong Kong, the Jao Studies Foundation, and the Jao Tsung-I Academy in Kowloon have been founded in his name. Early life and education Jao was a native of Meixian, Guangdong. He was born in 1917 in Chao'an County (now Xiangqiao District, Chaozhou), Guangdong, into a scholarly Hakka family of Jiaying county, Guangdong ancestry. Jao grew up in Shantou, Guangdong. He also used the courtesy names Gu'an and Bolian, and the art name Xuantang. Largely home-schooled and self-taught, he wrote The Scholastic Journals of Gu Tinglin at the age of 14. Career Jao taught at several colleges in mainland China before moving to Hong Kong in 1949. In the following years, he taught at the University of Hong Kong, the National University of Singapore, Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica in Taiwan, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, √âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me- Orient, √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes of Paris, and Yale University in the US.

Over his 80-year-long career, he published more than 100 books and about 1,000 scholarly papers. He spent ten years translating the Akkadian epic En√ªma Eli≈° into Chinese, filling a major gap in Chinese knowledge of ancient Babylon. In 1959, he published Yindai zhenbu renwu tongkao (), which earned him the Prix Stanislas Julien from the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1962. In 2000, he was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal, the highest honor bestowed by the Hong Kong government. Arts In addition to his academic pursuits, Jao was also a renowned calligrapher, painter, and musician. He created his own calligraphic style called Jao's Clerical Script.

Biography He was born at Martres, in the d√©partement of the Haute-Garonne, France, 17 May 1604, and died in Paris on 21 January 1674. At the age of seventeen he passed from the college of the Jesuits in Toulouse to the Dominican convent of St. Thomas in the same city. He made his religious profession there on 16 May 1622, where he also completed his course in philosophy and theology, and taught these subjects. As early as 1634 he was first professor in his convent and conventual doctor in the University of Toulouse. Rare erudition, depth of thought and clearness of exposition earned for him the reputation of being one of the leading theologians of France. While discharging his professorial duties he delivered courses of Lenten sermons in the principal churches of Toulouse, Avignon, Bordeaux and other cities of Southern France. Upon the invitation of the bishops of Languedoc he preached throughout their dioceses for ten years, reviving the faith of Catholics, elevating their morals, and combating the doctrine of the Calvinists, with whose ministers he frequently joined in open debate, sometimes in their public synods. In the pulpit Father Baron was always a teacher; but while intent upon forming the minds of his hearers he won their hearts by his disinterestedness, sincerity and charity. From 1630 to 1659 he filled the office of prior in the convents of Toulouse (twice), Rhodez, Castres, Albi and Avignon and in the general novitiate in Paris, always promoting the reforms in study and religious observance inaugurated by Sebastien Michaelis in the first years of the century. In 1660, having declined the office of provincial in the Province of Toulouse, he was sent by the master-general of his order to make a canonical visitation of the Portuguese convents. On his return to Paris he devoted himself during the remaining fourteen years of his life to the composition of theological works. Works He published an abridgment of his controversies with Lutheranism under the title \\"L'heresie convaincue\\" (Paris, 1668). Of his sermons to Catholic congregations we have only those preached at Paris in 1658 and 1659 (Paris, 1660), doctrinal discourses and panegyrics, composed in the forced style and manner of his age. His most important productions were written to satisfy the desire expressed by Pope Alexander VII to the Dominicans assembled in a general chapter at Rome in 1656, that they should publish a course in moral theology conformable to the doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas, and thus correct the laxity of morals encouraged by certain casuists. These works were: *(1) \\"Theologiae Moralis adv. Laxiores probabilistas pars prior\\" (Paris, 1665); *(2) \\"Manuductionis ad Moralem Theologiam pars altera\\" (Paris, 1665); *(3) \\"Theologia moralis Summa bipartita\\" (Paris, 1667). In these works, while condemning opinions that seemed too lax, and censuring others that appeared to be too rigorous, he defended the system of Probabiliorism. With Jean de Launoy he was long in controversy as to the Summa Theologiae of Thomas Aquinas, the authenticity of which he ably defended, although he did not demonstrate it, as later writers have done. The manuscript of a work entitled \\"Apologia pro sacra congregatione Indicis\\" having been published with alterations made by a stranger, which brought upon it the condemnation of the Sacred Congregation, he promised a new edition, which was embodied in his \\"SS. Augustini et Thomae vera et una mens de libertate humana\\" (Paris, 1666). Another work is his \\"Libri V apologetici pro religione, utraque theologia, moribus ac juribus Ord. Praed.\\" (Paris, 1666). At the time of his death he was engaged on a complete course in theology to be entitled \\"D. Thomas sui Interpres\\". From this work, but half completed and never published, the one bearing the same title by Antoninus Massouli√©, O.P., is entirely distinct.

Dodik stated that this referendum is \\"inevitable\\" and says that Bosnia and Herzegovina has no viable future.Link to reprint of article by Croatian newsagency Hina Bosniak politicians request for the suspension of Republika Srpska, saying that it was created on the backbone of genocide and war crimes. Haris Silajd≈æiƒá, party leader of Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina, has repeatedly stated that he wishes to see the RS dismantled. Miroslav Lajƒç√°k, former High Representative of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has responded to this by saying that \\"Republika Srpska does not have the right to secede from BiH, at the same time no one can unilaterally abolish Republika Srpska.\\" President of Serbia Boris Tadiƒá says that Serbia does not support a breakup of Bosnia and that, as a guarantor of the Dayton Accords that brought peace to Bosnia, supports Bosnia's territorial integrity.Policy of peace Serbia-Republika Srpska relations In 1997, the Agreement on Special Parallel Relations was signed between the two on February 28, 1997. A council has been established to bolster relations, in which presidents and prime ministers participate. The Agreement was implemented December 15, 2010. So far, four councils have been held. On July 26, 2010, the Serbian Minister of Finance Diana Dragutinoviƒá and her Republika Srpska counterpart Aleksandar D≈æombiƒá signed an Agreement on Cooperation in the Financial Sector, which will further develop mutual relations in the financial system.

The corporation operates a fleet of 165 vehicles and employs over 1,300 people, including 891 professional paramedics. Urgences-sant√© is one of the largest paramedical services in Canada. Organization Urgences-sant√© as a corporation was formally created in 1989 under section 149.1 of the Loi sur les services de sant√© et les services sociaux and granted jurisdiction as a public health agency on the islands of Montr√©al and Laval, where it is responsible for the planning, organization, coordination and evaluation of emergency medical services; the operation of an ambulance service, a first responder service, and a medical communications centre; providing management, training and expertise consultancy services to emergency medical service partners and maintaining the ability to commercialize such services in Qu√©bec, Canada and abroad. The corporation is the sole provider of advanced life support services in its jurisdiction, and a major provider of basic life support (BLS) alongside the Service de s√©curit√© incendie de Montr√©al (the Montreal City Fire Department), the D√©partement de s√©curit√© incendie de Laval (Laval Fire Department), and various partners in the community, including C√¥te Saint-Luc Emergency Medical Services. Field operations are carried out by 891 full-time paramedics. Operations Urgences-sant√© is responsible for an area of over with a population of over 2.3 million people. It maintains a fleet of 165 ambulances and performs over 272,000 medical transports every year to, or between, 23 hospitals in the Montreal metropolitan region. Of the 363,000 emergency and non-emergency calls received in 2011, 285,000 required an ambulance dispatch, 226,000 required an ambulance transport, 70,000 required a priority 1 response for life-threatening situations, and 224 required a major emergency service mobilization. Operations are managed from three regional divisions: East, West and North. The ambulance service also maintains specialized units: *Montreal Metro team that performs over 600 interventions a year in the metro *Bicycle patrol team that performs over 450 sorties to cover summer festivals and events *Technical support team that performs close to 3,000 interventions in support of paramedics *Tactical team that is tasked with performing some 270 high-risk medical interventions alongside the Montreal and Laval SWAT teams. History A citywide ambulance service was originally introduced by the Service de police de la Ville de Montr√©al in 1958. Many of the suburban municipalities followed Montr√©al's lead; island- wide service was provided when police services were centralized under the Montreal Urban Community in 1970. By the late 1970s, however, police ambulance training and equipment had fallen behind contemporary standards and the service was finally withdrawn. Urgences-sant√© was created in 1981 by forming a centralized dispatch system for the region's 25 privately owned ambulance services. The original full name was Centre de coordination des urgences sant√© (Health Emergencies Coordination Centre). As part of the program, a single telephone number for emergency medical services was introduced for the islands of Montreal and Laval (514-842-4242). All private services were invited to use Urgences-sant√© for dispatch and later, billing. The contracting companies were paid to maintain ambulance availability and on a per-call basis. Consolidation of the private companies and the formation of a militant labour organization caused much instability including a strike in 1986. In 1989, following the transfer of ambulance service to the health and social services department, the system was re-organized and formalized by an act of the Quebec National Assembly. Advanced care paramedics Historically staffed exclusively by primary care paramedics, one cohort or advanced care paramedics was trained in the late 1980s. In 2016, a new 2-year advanced care paramedicine program was launched at Universit√© de Montr√©al. The first cohort graduated in 2018.

A social democrat, he led the Patriotic Front (PF), a major political party in Zambia. Under President Frederick Chiluba, Sata was a minister during the 1990s as part of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government; he went into opposition in 2001, forming the PF. As an opposition leader, Sata ‚Äì popularly known as \\"King Cobra\\" ‚Äì emerged as the leading opposition presidential contender and rival to President Levy Mwanawasa in the 2006 presidential election, but was defeated. Following Mwanawasa's death, Sata ran again and lost to President Rupiah Banda in 2008. After ten years in opposition, Sata defeated Banda, the incumbent, to win the September 2011 presidential election with a plurality of the vote. He died in London on 28 October 2014, leaving Vice President Guy Scott as Acting President until a presidential by-election was held on 20 January 2015. Early years Michael Charles Chilufya Sata was born on 6 July 1937,Official Verbatim Report of the Parliamentary Debates of the First Session (Resumed) of the Fifth National Assembly, Government Printer, Lusaka\\"China's stake in Zambia's election\\", BBC, 19 September 2011. and brought up in Mpika, Northern Province. He worked as a police officer, railway man and trade unionist during colonial rule. He spent time in London working on the railway sweeping the platforms. Among other things, he was a porter at Victoria railway station. Sata began actively participating in the politics of Northern Rhodesia in 1963. Following independence, he worked his way up through the rough-and- tumble rank-and-file of the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP) to the governorship of Lusaka in 1985. As Governor, he made his mark as a man of action with a hands on approach. He cleaned up the streets, patched roadways and built bridges in the city. Afterward he became a member of parliament for Kabwata constituency in Lusaka. Though once close with President Kenneth Kaunda, he became disillusioned by Kaunda's dictatorial style and he left the UNIP to join the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) during the campaign for multi-party politics in 1991. Personal life Sata's first marriage was to Margaret Manda. He later married his second wife, Christine Kaseba, who became First Lady of Zambia during his presidency. Michael Sata reportedly had at least ten children between his two marriages. In 2016, Sata's widow, Christine Kaseba, denied claims by another woman that she too had also been married to Michael Sata as well as herself. Michael Sata has a Bachelor in Political Science from Atlantic International University. Early politics After Frederick Chiluba defeated Kaunda in 1991, Sata became one of Zambia's most instantly recognisable faces. Under the MMD, he served as minister for local government, labour and, briefly, health where, he stated that his \\"reforms brought sanity to the health system\\". In 1995, he was appointed as minister without portfolio, the party's national organising secretary during which his political style was described as \\"increasingly abrasive\\". Formation of Patriotic Front In 2001, President Chiluba nominated Levy Mwanawasa as the MMD's presidential candidate for the 2001 election. In frustration, Sata left the MMD and set up a new party, the Patriotic Front (PF). He contested the 2001 election but did not do well‚Äîhis party only won one seat in parliament. Sata conceded defeat and continued to campaign 2006 election and afterwards Sata contested the September 2006 presidential election as a populist championing the causes of the poor in the face of Mwanawasa's economic reform policies. While others on the slate of candidates contesting the election frequently resorted to personal attacks and insults, Sata's remarks were at times quite equally scathing. At one campaign event in particular, Sata was reported to have ripped apart a cabbage in front of his supporters. The cabbage was a reference to Mwanawasa's speech impediment, which was the result of an injury sustained in a 1992 car crash.\\"Zambia campaign draws to a close\\", BBC News, 27 September 2006. He has also accused Mwanawasa of \\"selling out\\" Zambia to international interests, and at one event, he referred to Hong Kong as a country and Taiwan as a sovereign state. In response, China, which is interested in Zambia's copper reserves, threatened to cut off relations with Zambia if he was elected.\\"Tough election race in Zambia\\", Al Jazeera, 30 September 2006.\\"Profile: Zambia's 'King Cobra'\\", BBC News, 29 September 2006.

He served a number of ministerial positions during the Chiluba government.\\"Tilyenji comes to his father‚Äôs defense\\" , Times of Zambia. Sata also received the public backing of Chiluba.\\"Vote out president, Chiluba says\\", BBC News, 18 September 2006. Initial results from the election gave Sata the lead, but further results put Mwanawasa in first place and pushed Sata into third place.\\"Zambian President Takes Election Lead, Opposition Claims Irregularities\\" , Voice of America, 1 October 2006. Interim results released after votes from 120 of 150 constituencies were counted put Mwanawasa on just over 42% of the vote; Hakainde Hichilema had 28%; and the Michael Sata had slipped to 27%.

Sata was arrested in early December 2006, accused of making a false declaration of his assets when applying to run for president in August, along with other charges. He was questioned by police and released on bail. If convicted, he could have received a prison sentence of least two years.\\"Zambia opposition leader arrested\\", BBC News, 5 December 2006. As a convict, he would also be unable to hold public office. Sata said the charges were politically motivated, and in court he pleaded not guilty to them.Peter Clottey, \\"Zambian Opposition Leader Pleads not Guilty to Charges\\", Voice of America, 7 December 2006. On 14 December, the charges were dropped on the grounds that the declaration of assets was not made under oath.\\"Zambian court quashes charges against Sata\\", AFP, 14 December 2006. On 15 March 2007, Sata was deported from Malawi shortly after arrival. Sata said that he was only there to meet with the business community, and alleged that the Zambian government had effected the deportation by falsely claiming that Sata was in Malawi to assist that country's former president, Bakili Muluzi. The Zambian government denied this,Shapi Shacinda, \\"'Coup smear' blocks trip to Malawi\\", Reuters (IOL), 17 March 2007. while the Malawian government gave no explanation for Sata's deportation.

After losing his passport in London in late 2007, Sata was issued another; however, on 10 November 2007, Minister of Home Affairs Ronnie Shikapwasha announced that Sata's passport was withdrawn temporarily because he had obtained the new passport without following the necessary procedures and proving that he needed a new passport. Shikapwasha said that an investigation would follow, that Sata had been interrogated, and that he could face arrest.\\"Zambia opposition leader's passport withdrawn\\" , AFP (Mail & Guardian Online, South Africa), 11 November 2007. Sata suffered a heart attack on 25 April 2008 and was evacuated to Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he was said to be in stable condition on 26 April.\\"Zambian opposition leader 'stable'\\", Sapa (IOL), 26 April 2008.

Mwanawasa's death and the 2008 election After Mwanawasa suffered a stroke and was hospitalised in France, Sata questioned the official claims about Mwanawasa's health on 15 July 2008, and he called for a team of doctors to be sent by the Cabinet to examine Mwanawasa; this team would then disclose Mwanawasa's actual condition.\\"Is Mwanawasa fit to rule?\\", Sapa-AFP (IOL), 15 July 2008. Mwanawasa died in office in August 2008. On 25 August, Sata attempted to attend funeral proceedings for Mwanawasa at Chipata in Eastern Province; however, Maureen Mwanawasa, Mwanawasa's widow, ordered Sata to leave, saying that he was politicising the event and that he had never reconciled with Mwanawasa's family. Sata, who was removed from the scene by security, said that he was only there to mourn Mwanawasa and that he had hoped to escort the body while it was taken to provincial capitals across Zambia; he maintained that his reconciliation with Mwanawasa himself was sufficient to justify his presence.\\"Zambia's opposition leader ordered to leave late President's funeral proceedings\\", Xinhua (People's Daily Online), 26 August 2008. He also said that Maureen Mwanawasa had acted inappropriately. Sata was unanimously chosen as the PF's candidate for the presidential by-election at a meeting of its Central Committee on 30 August 2008. Accepting the nomination, he expressed the need \\"to scrub this country and wash it\\"; he also said that he would refrain from campaigning until after Mwanawasa's funeral.\\"Zambia's biggest opposition picks candidates for presidential by-elections\\", Xinhua, 31 August 2008.

Although he held the lead in early vote counting, which reflected his strong support in urban areas, his lead grew smaller as votes from rural areas were counted. In the end, Banda overtook Sata, and final results on 2 November showed Banda with 40% of the vote against 38% for Sata.\\"Zambia: Banda sworn in, riots spread\\", Sapa-DPA (IOL), 2 November 2008. Sata subsequently stated that he had not been defeated and accused Banda of fraud.\\"Sata: I have not lost this election\\", Sapa-DPA (IOL), 4 November 2008. Presidency Sata ran for President for a fourth time in the election held on 20 September 2011. In the early stages of the campaign he was more vitriolic in his anti-Chinese rhetoric, but he later toned down his rhetoric. Results showed him receiving about 43% of the vote against 36% for Banda, and Chief Justice Ernest Sakala accordingly declared that he had won the election in the early hours of 23 September. He was sworn in later in the day. He was said to have won because of the urban vote. Despite the toning down of his rhetoric, the investment climate in Zambia was considered uncertain in the wake of his victory. Policies On 8 September 2008, Sata claimed that he would protect Chinese investments if he was elected, abandoning the hostility towards Chinese investment that he had expressed during the 2006 presidential election campaign.Shapi Shacinda, \\"Sata warms to Chinese investment in Zambia\\", Reuters, 8 September 2008. During the 2006 election campaign he was reported to have said of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe that \\"Mugabe hasn't done anything wrong. It is the imperialists, the capitalist-roaders, who say he is a villain.\\"\\"Long queues in tight Zambian poll\\", BBC News. In 2008, he said that he would revoke licenses for foreign investors if they resisted his orders to give at least a 25% stake in their companies to Zambians.\\"Sata to help local investors\\" , News24.

Illness and death Concerns about Sata's health grew during 2014 and some suggested that he was no longer really running the government due to his condition, although the government denied that. He stopped appearing in public, which seemed jarringly uncharacteristic for the notably extroverted and outspoken president. Observers thought he seemed unwell when he opened parliament on 19 September and over the course of the following month he failed to appear in public again. MMD leader Nevers Mumba alleged that the government was lying about Sata's health.\\"Zambia: Has 'King Cobra' lost his bite?\\", Mail & Guardian, 17 October 2014. He also missed a speech at the general debate of the sixty-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly amid rumours he had fallen ill at a New York City hotel. On 19 October, he left the country for what was described as a medical check-up, leaving Edgar Lungu, the Minister of Defense, in charge of the country in his absence.\\"Zambian President Michael Sata goes for medical check-up\\", BBC News, 20 October 2014.\\"Party rivalries grow as Sata ails\\", Africa Confidential, volume 55, number 21, 24 October 2014. Given the circumstances, including the sudden nature of the trip, Sata's absence from public view and the fact that the 50th anniversary of Zambian independence was only days away, many believed that Sata was very seriously ill. Sata died on 28 October in London.\\"Zambian President Michael Sata dies in London\\", BBC News ‚Äì Africa, 29 October 2014. He was receiving treatment for an undisclosed illness. Cabinet Secretary Roland Msiska issued a statement that he died late in the day. \\"As you are aware the president was receiving medical attention in London. The head of state passed on October 28. President Sata's demise is deeply regretted. The nation will be kept informed on burial arrangements.\\" When he died at 23:00 in King Edward VII Hospital, his wife, Christine Kaseba, son, Mulenga,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/29/scott-president-interim- zambia-sata-death and other family members were with him at the time. Vice- President Guy Scott was named acting leader until an election, making him the first white leader of a democratically elected Sub-Saharan African government and the first since F. W. de Klerk in Apartheid South Africa. Reactions Domestic Sata's predecessor, Rupiah Banda, said that Sata \\"was more than a public servant. He was a passionate competitor, a man of conviction and determination. He was also a loving son, a husband, a father, and to me, despite everything we've been through, a friend. Above all, Michael Sata was a Zambian, in body, soul, and spirit. We have gone through this before as a country and we made it to the other side because we were united. Let this be a time that we set aside the ideas that separate us, and embrace the humanity and dignity that unites us as a country and defines us as a people.\\" Mark Chona, former special assistant to Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's first president, said: \\"We are very devastated because he was a very hard working and committed president and leader. He was extremely passionate about anything he had decided to achieve.\\" International The South African government (which Vice President Scott had previously irritated by calling \\"backwards\\") issued a statement that read: \\"President Sata belongs to the generation of leaders produced by Zambia during the colonial times and gallantly pursued the anti- colonial struggle. His death reminds the people of South Africa of Zambia‚Äôs immeasurable sacrifice and the sterling leadership role that Zambia played in ridding the African continent of the yoke of colonial domination and apartheid rule.\\" Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta hailed Sata as an \\"outstanding son of Africa\\" and added: \\"He was gifted with unique, admirable abilities and strong values.\\" The Foreign Secretary of Zambia's former colonial power Britain, Philip Hammond, said: \\"[Sata] played a commanding role in the public life of his country over three decades...and finally as president.\\" References External links *Presidency of Zambia (State House) Official Website *Patriotic Front website *Photo of Sata Obituary in The Independent by Marcus Williamson *Sattaking Category:1937 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Members of the National Assembly (Zambia) Category:Movement for Multi-Party Democracy politicians Category:Patriotic Front (Zambia) politicians Category:People from Mpika District Category:People who died in office Category:Presidents of Zambia Category:United National Independence Party politicians Category:Zambian Roman Catholics Category:Zambian trade unionists Category:Local government ministers of Zambia Category:Labour and Social Security ministers of Zambia Category:Health ministers of Zambia ","title":"Michael Sata"},{"id":"7159158","title":"Family of Jogaila"},{"id":"7159160","text":"NBA Showdown is a 1993 video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game console.

Firmware revisions: * v1.33 and older: If the version of firmware is older than v1.33 (released in July 2005), the player could lock software-activated controls from operating. The solution is to reset the player with this procedure: remove the battery and let the internal capacitors discharge for several minutes, then connect to a PC by the USB cable and reinstall the firmware. The issue is gone in post-July 2005 firmware. * v1.66: This unofficial version adds MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) support. * v3.04: This unofficial version, named \\"The Developers Cut\\", adds several new features such as large SD card support, and proper support for bookmarks with VBR (Variable Bitrate) .mp3 files. There are no known issues with this version. See external links section below. Reliability issues Rio Forge units suffer from a design flaw where the case-mounted controls operate switches which are surface-mounted on the internal PCB. If the player becomes damaged, taking either out of tolerance, the control (usually the volume) will not operate. An option for players with volume control failure is to use headphones with an in-line volume control.

The series is set within fictionalized versions of various real-life cities, including Okinawa, Japan; Hanoi, Vietnam; Yekaterinburg, Russia; Paris, France; London, England; Fayetteville, North Carolina; and New York City The central character of the series is Saya Otonashi, a seemingly ordinary teenage girl who was adopted into the family of Kai and Riku Miyagusuku a year before the series begins and who cannot remember her past. Her life is dramatically changed when she learns that she is a chiropteran‚Äîa vampire-like creature‚Äîwho was born in 1833, survives by drinking the blood of others or receiving it through blood transfusion, and is the only one who can destroy other chiropterans and her twin sister Diva. Saya and Diva are the \\"queens\\", the descendants of a line of supremely powerful chiropterans that are always born as twin females. Aiding Saya in this century-long quest is an organization called the Red Shield, with a man named David assigned to be Saya's primary \\"handler.\\" With Saya forced to return to her former life, she is reunited with Hagi, her chevalier‚Äîa special form of chiropteran created by feeding a human the blood of a queen which causes a powerful bond to form and compels the chevalier to serve and protect his queen at all costs. As the series progresses, it is revealed that Diva has five chevaliers to aid her: Amshel Goldsmith, Solomon Goldsmith, Karl Fei-Ong, James Ironside, and Nathan Mahler. They have formed their own organization, Cinq Fl√®ches, which they use to create additional chiropterans from Diva's blood. Working against both sides are the Schiff, a group of escaped artificial chiropterans created by Diva's group who attacks both sides in search of the blood of Saya, Diva, or one of their chevaliers in hopes that one will be the right blood to save them from a fatal and painful disease they call the Thorn. Organizations Red Shield The Red Shield is an organization dedicated to eliminate Diva and chiropterans. The organization was started by the grandchildren of Joel Goldschmidt, who first found Saya and Diva in 1833 and raised them at the Zoo. He separated the sisters after birth, raising Saya like his own daughter, while locking the unnamed up in a tower, for scientific reasons. Joel took care of Saya, while his assistant Amshel provided for Diva's basic needs. Joel was killed by Diva in 1883 on his seventy-second birthday after Saya released her from the tower to sing at his birthday party. Leadership of the Red Shield is passed down from father to son, with the current leader being Joel Goldschmidt VI. Many of its members have endured tragic encounters with chiropterans in the field and all members of the Red Shield carry an item containing a piece of red crystal taken from the crystallized body of destroyed chiroptera. According to the Blood+ light novels, the organization's name is taken from the idea that the members are Saya's shield of blood, incapable of killing chiropterans themselves but willing to die to protect Saya. Cinq Fl√®ches The Goldsmiths are a branch of the Goldschmidt family. Cinq Fl√®ches, a pharmaceutical company owned by the Goldsmiths, is also active in other industries operating hundreds of companies, including food production, the high-tech industry, and military contracts. The group has influential contacts within the United States government. This company is what causes humans to turn into chiropteran when hearing Diva's Song; most likely because they put Delta 6-7 in the food they distribute. The Schiff The three longest living Schiff. From left to right: Lulu, Moses, and Karman The Schiff are soldiers created by a group of scientists led by Boris using Diva's blood, under the sponsorship of Amshel Goldsmith. Slaves at first, the ten Schiff decided they wanted to be free and escaped from the lab where they were created, killing most of the humans there. Trained only for fighting, they mostly know no other way of living or of getting what they want except by force. However, they are deeply attached to each other. Like chevaliers and chiroptera, the Schiff have enhanced speed and strength, and must drink blood to survive. However they are different in two key ways: sunlight will burn them to death, and they form a condition they call \\"Thorn\\" that causes them to slowly crystallize. It initially manifests itself as red cracks that usually appear on the neck, spreading along the body until the afflicted Schiff shatters completely. Due to the parting words of one the scientists from the lab, they believed that they were created from Saya's blood, and so her blood would save them from their destined short life spans. They attack Saya and Hagi, but when one of the Schiff, Ghee, drinks Hagi's blood, it kills him almost instantly.Note: In the Region 1 English dub, Ghee is changed from male to female. They later try again with Saya's blood, but it also causes the Schiff, Ir√®ne, who drinks it to die instantly. They realize that the scientist lied and that it is Diva's blood they require to live, not Saya's and devote themselves to hunting Diva down. The Schiff do not appear in the manga at all. Protagonists Saya Otonashi was \\"born\\" in 1833 from one of two cocoon-like objects taken from the belly of a chiropteran mummy, the other cocoon containing her sister Diva. Both are kept by Joel Goldschmidt at the \\"Zoo\\", where Saya is treated as his daughter and Diva, who is left nameless, is confined to a tower. Saya does not learn about Diva's existence until 1863, when she hears Diva singing and finds her locked in a room at the top of the tower. Saya then names her Diva. In 1870, Amshel purchases a twelve-year-old boy named Hagi from his parents to become Saya's companion and friend, though she later falls in love with him and vice versa. During a birthday party for Joel in 1883, Saya releases Diva so that she can sing for Joel; Diva, however, slaughters everyone in the Goldschmidt house while Saya and Hagi are out looking for Joel's favorite flower. Realizing that Diva is a monster, Saya spends her periods of activity hunting Diva to try to kill her, her chevaliers, and any chiropterans they have created. During a flashback dream, she is hunting Diva after the presumed death of Grigori after the Russian Revolution. It turns out the girl Sonia is Grigori. Grigori is crystallized after Diva escaping with Amshel. After that, Saya goes into her deep sleep (30-year hibernation). Saya is a skilled athlete and fights using a special katana with an edge she can touch with her thumb while gripping it so as to draw blood, and grooves specially designed to spread her blood through its entire blade. Once loaded with her blood, it is a deadly weapon against Diva and any chiropteran created from Diva's blood. After Saya's first blade is broken, David gives her a new one that has a red crystal at the base of its blade, symbolizing her membership in the Red Shield organization. The crystal is a piece of her adoptive father's body, which crystallized when she killed him with her own blood in order to spare him the fate of turning into a chiropteran. In 2005, when Blood+ begins, Saya is a high school girl living in Okinawa who was adopted a year ago by George Miyagusuku after waking from her hibernation cycle with no memory of her identity or past. Though she appears to be a normal teenager, any injuries she sustains heal almost instantly and she must receive regular blood transfusions to remain healthy. When a chiropteran attacks her school, she finds her life turned upside down. She is reunited with her chevalier Haji, though she doesn't remember him, and learns that her blood can kill the chiropterans. She is approached by David, from the Red Shield, who tells her it is her duty to kill chiropterans because she is the only one who can. Neither David nor Haji will tell her the truth about her past, telling her she must remember on her own. Though at first Saya is reluctant to fight and afraid of who she might be, she slowly comes to accept her duty and regain her memories. After Riku's death, Saya disappears for a year, along with Haji. When she returns, she has longer hair and a harder, darker appearance. Now accepting of her chiropteran biology, she accepts the necessity of feeding on Haji's blood to live and be strong enough to fight. However, she has a less cheerful personality, is more morose and less talkative than she used to be. Moses and Lulu both remark that she has lost hope. Believing the fight with Diva is hers alone, and not wanting to have to grieve for any more lost comrades, she avoids cooperating with Kai or the Red Shield. Saya's friends repeatedly work to help her understand that this fight is not for her to bear by herself, and that she is never alone. As the battle with Diva continues, Saya's next hibernation period draws nearer, she starts having sudden bouts of fainting spells, and her regeneration ability slows. At the Metropolitan Opera House, Saya confronts Diva in a final duel, which ends as they simultaneously pierce each other with their blood-coated swords. Saya is unaffected by Diva's blood, because it lost its potency when she became pregnant. Diva, however, begins to crystallize, and Saya cries for her and tries to hold her shattering pieces together. With Diva dead, Saya turns to kill the babies and herself, fearing that if they lived, they would be forced to become military weapons. Kai pleads with her to live, promising to protect her and the babies and make anyone afraid of her understand. Hagi disobeys Saya for the only time in his life, taking her sword and confessing he has loved her from the moment they met. Saya tearfully admits she wishes to live as she kisses Haji. A month later, back in Okinawa, Saya finally goes into her next thirty-year hibernation period. At her request, Kai puts her back in the Miyagusuku family crypt to sleep, and he watches over her, and Diva's children. Several years later, a pink rose with Haji's blue ribbon is left at the crypt. Hagi is alive and he is watching from afar, waiting patiently for his love to awaken after her thirty-year sleep. In the anime, Saya is the object of romantic interest for Kai, Hagi, and Solomon Goldsmith. Of the three, only Solomon shows his interest openly, effectively abandoning Diva and his brothers in order to spend his life with Saya. Although she appreciates his affections, Saya does not feel the same way and gently rejects his advances. Both Kai and Hagi spend most of the series suppressing their true feelings for Saya, stating that they only wish to protect and support her. Eventually, Kai suggests that when their war with Diva is finished that they both return to Okinawa to run their father's restaurant together, and offers her a key to the restaurant. It is never explicitly stated whether Kai intended their relationship to become romantic and he may only have meant that they could run the restaurant as siblings. In the series finale, Hagi admits that Saya is the one who taught him how to live and that she was the only person that ever made him happy. He regrets not being able to do the same, by protecting her from the suffering caused by her conflict with Diva. He begs her to rethink her request of suicide and to live, with him. The two kiss and she admits, she wants to live and with him and the others. Saya showed great distress when she thought he had died. After Saya enters her next 30-year hibernation period, Kai and the twins see a rose with a ribbon on it. Hinting that Hagi is alive and will wait for Saya until she awakens. In the manga (showing part of Saya's past from the 19th-century era), Saya doesn't care much for Hagi at first, telling him to find her one of every type of rose. When he cannot find the blue rose she requests, she tells him to leave. She visits Diva often, telling her of what goes on in her life. When she tells of Haji, Diva convinces her that Haji is just the same as her other companions. Saya intends to drive Haji away again, until she finds that all the roses he has picked her now had no thorns. After this, Haji and Saya grow closer and she teaches him how to play the cello. As he grows older, Saya is shown to be flustered after merely touching his hand. At one point Saya gets a cut and runs away when Haji sees it healing so quickly, believing he will think her a monster. She stays locked in her room for days, unwilling to come out even to take her 'medicine'. Unexpectedly Haji crashes through her window, with her medicine, and tells her she is beautiful and gives her the hair comb he had been waiting so long to give her. They share their first kiss. Their romantic relationship results in Saya no longer visiting Diva very often. When Saya lets Diva out of the tower, Diva pierces Haji's chest with her hand, leaving him to die for \\"being a nuisance\\". Upon discovering him, Saya gives him her blood and turns him into a chevalier. Hagi/Haji Hagi|„Éè„Ç∏|Haji}} is Saya's first and only living chevalier. In 1870, he was purchased by Joel and Amshel from his parents for a loaf of bread to be a companion for Saya, with hopes that they might mate and create more specimens for future experimentation. Hagi lives with her in Joel's mansion for many years, him growing up but her never aging. In 1883, he falls from a cliff attempting to pick a flower that Saya wants as a present for Joel's birthday. Misunderstanding an earlier conversation between Hagi and Joel about why Saya lives on blood, and wanting to save him, Saya feeds him some of her blood, unwittingly turning him into a chevalier. Saya feels some guilt over this through the years, but when she apologizes, Hagi assures her that he has no regrets as it allows him to always be at her side while she lives her dream of traveling the world with her sword. Hagi plays the cello, a skill he learned from Saya. He usually carries his cello in a large black case that he can also use as a blunt weapon and a shield, and the case also holds Saya's sword. Hagi also fights with a handful of silver daggers that he keeps on hand. As with most chevaliers, Hagi doesn't need to eat or sleep, and he stays awake while Saya eats, sleeps, or goes into long periods of hibernation. Unlike Diva's chevaliers, Hagi never makes a full transformation into a chiropteran form; however, this is by his own choice rather than a limitation of his power. He keeps his right hand bandaged most of the time to hide the fact that its form is permanently chiropteran since Saya injured it while going crazy from being forced awake decades ago in Vietnam. In the opening credits of the final season, Hagi is shown with wings, but he does not use them in the series until the forty-third episode. After Diva's death, Hagi convinces Saya to live, confessing that he has always loved her. Agreeing that she does wish to live, Saya kisses him. As they, along with Kai and the rest of the Red Shield operatives, try to escape the opera house, Amshel attacks them, ripping off one of Hagi's arms. Saya reloads her sword with blood and is ready to fight him to protect Diva's babies. However, Hagi takes her sword and pushes her aside so she can escape while he impales Amshel himself. As Amshel crystallizes, he stabs Hagi through the chest and the ceiling collapses on them both. He tells Saya that he'll always love her. Saya screams his name before they leave. She believes he may be dead, but Kai reassures her that Hagi will return. Years after Saya goes into her hibernation, Kai brings Diva's daughters to visit the Miyagusuku crypt where Saya is sleeping. When they arrive, they find a fresh pink rose with Hagi's blue hair ribbon tied to it. Hagi is alive and he is watching from afar, waiting patiently for his love to awaken after her thirty-year sleep. In the manga, Diva convinces Saya that Hagi is like the rest of her companions and should get rid of him. But when Saya sees that Hagi cut the thorns off the roses for her, she warms up to him. Unlike the anime, when Diva is set free, Hagi sees her and thinks it is Saya at first. Diva, jealous of Hagi being Saya's lover, kills him. Saya finds him, and Joel tells her that if she truly cannot live without him, then she should give him her blood. Although Hagi shows jealousy towards Kai in the anime, it is more obvious in the manga. He even pushes Kai into the helicopter, telling him that \\"Saya is my lover\\". His name can be spelled either Hagi or Haji. Kai Miyagusuku is Saya's adopted \\"elder\\" brother. Once a popular student at school and a star athlete, he quits playing baseball shortly before Saya's arrival and has been getting into more fights at school. His father's death forces him to grow up and try his best to keep his family united. He struggles greatly over Saya, and later Riku, not being human. As he finally comes to terms with both, Riku is raped and killed by Diva, and Saya disappears for a year. As the last surviving family member of Saya's adoptive family, he has sworn to protect her and return to Okinawa with her once everything has been settled. Towards the end of the series he convinces Hagi to confess his feelings to Saya. Initially Kai has little skill in fighting or marksmanship, but he improves as the series goes on. When George is kidnapped, Kai steals his father's M1911 pistol to try to rescue him. David confiscates it, but later returns it to show that he feels Kai had matured enough to handle it. Kai uses it as his primary weapon for the remainder of the series. After the destruction of the Red Shield, he lives with Lewis and David in an orphanage in London, actively hunting chiropterans with Lewis and honing his skills as a soldier in the war against Diva and her minions. With David drowning in alcohol and regret, Kai takes over many of his responsibilities in chiropteran-hunting. Following the tradition of Red Shield, Kai wears a diamond-shaped pendant with a crystal from Riku's remains crested in it. After Saya kills Diva, he is able to convince her to continue living, and prompts Hagi to \\"disobey\\" Saya and confess his own love for her. Saya and Kai return to Okinawa and reopen their late father's restaurant. A month later, Saya goes into her hibernation cycle and Kai puts her in the family crypt to sleep. Per his promise to Saya, he raises Diva's daughters as though they were his own. Together, they regularly visit Saya's resting place to keep an eye on her while she sleeps. David David was the sole survivor of a chiropteran attack on his special forces squad before joining the Red Shield. His father was also a member of Red Shield and was one of Saya's victims in the Vietnam incident. It is implied that he, along with Joel, are the only members that are descended from a line of Red Shield operatives. He is aware of Saya's past life and wishes to use her in the struggle against the chiroptera. David's red crystal item is a cross. David tends to be straight-faced and serious, with a somewhat cold personality. However, he also assumes an unofficial guardianship of Kai and Riku, and would be instrumental in helping Kai come to terms with what Saya is and with Riku's conversion to a chevalier. He seems to take a particular interest in helping Kai grow up to be a strong man who can support Saya and Riku as their brother, despite their unusual natures. David wields a Smith & Wesson Model 500 magnum revolver as his primary weapon. Carrying a handgun this powerful and large is unusual for an agent, but since chiropterans cannot be killed by normal means Red Shield personnel must rely on the knockdown power of their guns to keep the monsters at bay. When the Red Shield's headquarters are destroyed and Saya is believed to have gone down with it, David sinks into a deep depression and becomes an alcoholic. Hagi helps David snap his world back into focus, though, after Hagi makes an observation about David's unhappiness, and he picks up his gun and is able to fight once more. During the investigations into one of Cinq Fl√®ches's lab, he finds Julia and she tells him something about the research they are doing. He talks to her briefly again at Amshel's party, and lets her know that she will always be welcome back with the group. Towards the end of the series, Dr. Collins tries to murder Julia, but David jumps in front of her, getting critically wounded himself. Julia keeps vigil over him in the hospital, and after he recovers they begin a romantic relationship. At the end of the series, Julia is pregnant with his child. He mentions later in the series that he saw action in the Gulf War. Antagonists Diva as she appears in the second half of the series accompanied by James Ironside, one of her chevaliers. Diva is Saya's younger twin sister and the primary antagonist of the series. In 1833, Joel Goldschmidt discovered the mummy of an unknown creature that had two cocoons that react to human blood. Diva was born from one of these cocoons. As an experiment, Joel separated the twin girls, raising Saya as if she were his own daughter while Diva, who was given no name at the time, was locked in a tower and given only the basic necessities to live by Joel's assistant, Amshel. In 1863, Saya discovers the girl locked in the tower and names her Diva. Twenty years later, Saya releases Diva from her tower so that she can sing at Joel's birthday party; however, Diva murders Joel along with the rest of the people attending the party before fleeing the area. By 2005, when Blood+ begins, Diva has five living chevaliers, who head up the Cinq Fl√®ches Group. Due to her upbringing, Diva has a ruthless nature wrapped in an often childlike demeanor. She giggles after killing people, shows little reaction to the death of her own chevaliers, and tends to destroy things when bored. Diva seems to enjoy tormenting Saya and frequently says she wants to kill her. After meeting Riku, Saya's adopted brother, she drinks most of his blood and Saya is forced to turn him into a chevalier to save his life. After this incident, Diva becomes increasingly interested in Riku, eventually infiltrating the Red Shield headquarters with Karl to find him. She rapes Riku, and kills him by giving him her blood which crystallizes him. A year after this attack, when the Red Shield is able to regroup, Diva has changed her physical appearance to resemble Riku and retains that appearance until her final battle with Saya. Diva becomes an opera singer in New York, sponsored by the Group. Cinq Fl√®ches has spread the Delta 67 agent, which can turn people into chiropterans, across various populations of the world, including the United States. When heard live, Diva's voice greatly increases the effectiveness of the agent. As a result of her attack on Riku, Diva becomes pregnant. She does not give birth for over a year, when Amshel cuts the cocoons out of her body. Diva seems to treasure her babies and caring for the cocoons. At the Metropolitan Opera House, Diva is set to perform a live broadcast which would cause much of the world's population to turn into chiropterans. The Red Shield and Saya are able to stop the broadcast, and the sisters have their final battle, while Diva's chevalier Nathan watches nearby with the babies. The fight ends as Diva and Saya pierce one another with their swords, which each had coated with their own blood. Saya is unharmed by the attack, due to Diva's blood having lost its power when she became pregnant. Diva, on the other hand, begins to crystallize from the effects of Saya's blood. Her babies do not emerge from their cocoons before Diva reaches for them, with a vision of herself with her daughters. In the manga, Diva does not take orders from any of her chevaliers except for Amshel, who she believes truly loves her. Otherwise, she does as she pleases, so much so that she even takes on the identity of Grand Duchess Anastasia, the famous youngest daughter of Nicholas II. Although the manga never states how Diva became acquainted with the Romanov family, it is likely that Diva murdered the real Anastasia and learned the customs necessary to masquerade as a Grand Duchess from her chevalier Rasputin. She develops an attachment to the tsarevich Alexei, but soon becomes tired of her mortal brother and forces him to become her chevalier. Diva soon realizes how alike she and Alexei are in that neither of them were ever able to do the same things as their siblings, and appears to have been saddened by his death at the hands of Saya. Also her twins are never born, because she was not interested in having a family. Another great difference, is that she and Saya already knew about one another and she became greatly jealous when Saya developed a relationship with Hagi. Not so ironically, after all their years as enemies, when Saya tries to commit suicide to die with her; Diva stops her. With a smile of peace, she tells her sister to live. Amshel Goldsmith Diva's living chevaliers, from left to right: Nathan, James, Amshel, Solomon, and Karl. Amshel Goldsmith was the assistant of the original Joel Goldshmidt, and the secondary antagonist. Amshel was responsible for bringing Diva food and taking care of her basic needs while she was locked in the tower. In 1883, after Diva's release from the tower, Diva spares Amshel during her murder spree and turns him into a chevalier. Amshel refers to her as his \\"little treasure\\", later revealing that he was completely obsessed with Diva, which he feels is the \\"ultimate form\\" of love for her. He once tells Saya that he wished she hadn't freed Diva because then Diva would still be his and his alone. Amshel is generally seen as the leader of Diva's chevaliers and is the head of Cinq Fl√®ches. Despite referring to his fellow chevaliers as his brothers, he seems unaffected when Karl dies and grows increasingly disgusted with Solomon's love for Saya and orders his execution. He also ordered the death of Diva's third chevalier, Martin Bormann, who is only seen in photograph form in the series. After Saya's awakening, Amshel initially tried to bring her to their side. In Russia, he killed the Red Shield contact Liza and took her place during a train ride to Ekaterinburg. He reveals to Saya her true nature as a chiropteran and that she is killing her own kind with her sword. When Saya remains determined to fight and kill Diva, he decides she must be exterminated. After a fight with Hagi above New York City, Amshel was impaled on the Chrysler Building and struck by lightning. He was presumed dead, but reappeared in a half human-half chiroptera form and tries to attack Saya again. Hagi stabs him with Saya's blood-covered sword, crystallizing him, moments before the opera house collapses on top of them both. In the manga, Amshel has more control over Diva and is the only one she'll really listen to. Solomon Goldsmith Solomon Goldsmith was a medical doctor who was introduced to Diva by Amshel in 1917 during the Russian Revolution. At this time, he became one of her chevaliers, after which he wears only white clothing as a symbol of his being Diva's chevalier because it was what he was wearing when he met her. At the time, he wanted to free himself from seeing humans kill each other, but afterwards, he started seeing humans as insignificant and beneath him. As time passed, he realized the world of the chiropterans is just as full of war as the human one. Although he agrees that Saya is now a threat to him and his partners, he harbors strong feelings for her and regularly tries to protect her, despite his brothers' intentions to destroy her. He was first introduced to her as a delightful young man at the ball in her Vietnam school, and danced his only dance with her. After the dance he apologized, telling her that he had only asked her as she was the only girl who wasn't staring at him. He did not discover who she was until later. He later saves Saya from James and says he wishes to protect her because he is in love with her. Solomon's love for Saya only continued to grow as the series progressed, bringing him into conflict with his chevalier brothers and with Diva. Solomon eventually decides that he simply cannot kill Saya or continue to support Diva's efforts to do so, and wants to live with her as someone who loves her. While Amshel thinks Solomon's love for Saya is just part of his instinct as a chevalier, Solomon disagrees and knows he loves Saya as himself. Diva disowns him and tells him to do whatever he wants. As a sign of his no longer being Diva's chevalier, Solomon stops wearing his signature white suits, instead switching to black ones. Solomon kidnaps Saya after saving her from Amshel. He confesses his love for her and asks her to marry him, but Saya gently rejects him. Afterwards, Solomon briefly sinks into a depressed mood. Nathan visits him and takes him to visit Diva and the babies, but Solomon uses the opportunity to try to kill her. Diva easily defeats him and he is imprisoned at the mansion. James taunts him by promising to kill Saya and bring her head in front of him. Amshel tells Nathan to kill him, but Nathan frees him instead. Solomon rushes to save Saya from James, but during the battle he is accidentally cut by Saya's sword coated in her blood. He proclaims his allegiance to Saya as her chevalier once more, then leaves. In an alley, he begins to crystallize and shatters as Amshel watches. In the manga adaption, Solomon wants to find out whether a chiropteran can reproduce or not and tries to make Diva mate with Riku after the boy was made into Saya's chevalier. Solomon doesn't take kindly to her childish behavior when she throws a temper tantrum and scratches his face, and renounces his status as her chevalier. After reuniting Riku with Saya and Kai, Solomon attempts to take Saya as his \\"bride\\" but she doesn't trust him and tells him to prove himself by helping her kill Diva. Solomon survives at the end of the manga with Van's assistance and is shown observing Saya and the others from a van and vows to try to mate with her after she wakes up from her 30-year hibernation. Karl Fei-Ong Karl Fei-Ong was introduced to Diva in 1917 by Amshel. When he met her, he requested that she turn him into a chevalier. Amshel later says he only chose Karl to use him as a guinea pig for their new Delta project. Karl's body was heavily modified by Amshel's experiments, including having the arm Saya destroyed in Vietnam in 1972 replaced with a spiked arm. His traumatic past, Diva's inability to give him the love he sought, and forced conversion seems to have left Karl severely mentally unbalanced. However, Solomon, the only one who could calm Karl's mania, believed Karl's problems stemmed from his being lonely and not seeing that Solomon was always there and watching over him. Disguised as his alter ego \\"The Phantom\\", Karl kidnapped girls that looked like Saya in his desire to see her again to finish their fight. After finding her again, Karl became completely obsessed with killing her. He considered Saya his hated enemy, his beloved soul mate, and his only reason for living. While in London, he stole the Corpse Corps from Amshel and went after Saya while she was at Gray's home. He planned to die together with her by drinking all of her blood. Solomon, who'd come after him at Amshel's request, cuts off Karl's arm freeing Saya's sword arm. Realizing she has too much to live for, Saya stabs him by impaling her own body. With her sword coated in her blood, Karl crystallizes and is destroyed. Solomon mourns his death and tries to explain Karl's actions. In the manga, Karl's appearance and mannerisms are completely changed. He is the only one besides Amshel that Diva cares for and is said to be her \\"favorite\\" chevalier. After Saya cuts off his arm in Vietnam, he is not allowed to see Diva again and stripped of his status as a chevalier, even getting his name changed to Charles. He forms a sort of friendship with Van, who uses him for various experiments, including producing the Corpse Corps, and with Riku, who bonded with Charles while held in his captivity. Riku shields Charles from getting shot by Van; when Saya comes across them, she slays Charles (believing him to be responsible for killing Riku) and turns Riku into her chevalier. Riku later encounters one of Charles' clones and mistakes it for his deceased friend. Though his clone is feral and apparently unable to talk normally, he bonds with Riku as well and the two have a strange but loyal friendship. NOTE: In the English Dub, his name is spelled Carl. James Ironside James Ironside became one of Diva's chevaliers in 1945 in Berlin, Germany during the second World War. He is the Cinq Fl√®ches' contact with the US military, and later was appointed by Amshel as leader of the Corpse Corps and to take on the task of killing Saya. He is extremely devoted to caring for and protecting Diva. He considers her his beloved \\"Mama\\" and always carries her picture with him in a locket. When he lured Saya's group to Christina Island to eliminate Saya, he was struck by Saya's sword and fell into the trap he'd set to bury her in. He was saved when Nathan retrieved him and Amshel had most of his body replaced with Schiff parts. Once Diva realizes that most of his body has been replaced with Schiff parts, she disapproves of it, and begins to avoid him. Towards the end of the series, James begins to lose his sanity due to his crumbling relationship with Diva, and he takes out his rage on the Schiff, whom he regards as inferior organisms to himself. In his final battle against Saya, James begins to succumb to the Thorn before being killed by Saya. In the manga adaption, James is killed by Saya during the attack on Red Shield headquarters. Nathan Mahler In the original Japanese series, Nathan often speaks in a manner usually employed by the feminine gender, such as using kashira and wa. In the Sony English dub, this is represented by Nathan speaking in the manner of a stereotypical homosexual character. Unlike the other chevaliers, Nathan rarely participates in battle. In the opening credits of the final season, Nathan is shown fighting with Saya though they never do in any episode. Behind his seemingly effeminate and lackadaisical manners, Nathan may be the most powerful of the chevaliers and will assert his dominance over his younger \\"brothers\\" if he feels he needs to. He is the only one of Diva's chevaliers who can make Amshel and James back down if he chooses to, and the only one Amshel rarely attempts to manipulate. He says he wishes to destroy Saya on a \\"stage\\" prepared for the occasion, which prompts him to stop some battles between Saya and his brothers in order to save Saya for the death he has planned for her. Nathan is more empathetic to Diva's true intentions than Amshel, telling Saya after Diva's death that the only thing Diva actually wanted was to have a family. Towards the end of the series, while talking with Amshel, Nathan states that the world exists to showcase Diva's beauty, as was predestined before she was born. When Amshel says Nathan talks like he was there, Nathan claims that he was, and cryptically tells Amshel that before Diva and Saya were born, their mother had a \\"faithful chevalier\\" just as her daughter has now. After Diva's death, Nathan asks that Saya kill him, changing into his chiropteran form and allowing Saya to cut him in half with her blood-loaded sword, after which he falls through an opening in the stage to his presumed death. In the last episode, however, Nathan makes a reappearance in human form among some reporters outside of Van's trial. In the light novels, the original Nathan Mahler was killed by a surviving chevalier of Saya and Diva's mother. This chevalier transformed into Nathan, thus assuming his place as one of Diva's chevaliers. In the manga, Nathan is made a chevalier because Amshel ordered Diva to turn him. During the attack on Red Shield headquarters, he is shocked by James' death and Diva's lack of grief over it, prompting her to reveal that she doesn't care about James or Nathan himself. She later badly injures Nathan in the midst of a mental breakdown. These incidents haunt Nathan, eventually causing him to snap and murder Diva. He is in turn killed by an enraged Saya, who had been on the verge of reconciling with her sister. Supporting characters George Miyagusuku , an Okinawan-American US Army veteran who served in the Vietnam War, George is one of the soldiers present when Saya goes insane in Vietnam, killing friends and enemies alike. One of the few survivors, he is asked by the first David to watch over Saya's sleeping body after she falls into another hibernation cycle. He lost his wife and biological children in an accident years before, but is inspired to live by the sound of Saya's heart beating in her cocoon. When she wakes up from her sleep and he sees she is no longer a threat, he adopts her as his daughter. By this time, he also has two adopted sons, Kai and Riku. While protecting Saya, he is attacked by a chiropteran. While recovering from his wounds, he is kidnapped from the hospital and taken to a US military base where he is infused with Delta 67. After escaping, he is again wounded by a chiropteran while protecting Saya. The Delta 67 and the wounds from the chiropteran begin to change him into a chiropteran, so he asks Saya to pour her blood into his wounds and kill him. Saya is very reluctant, though, because he is the only father she has ever known. While they talk, he holds her hands, causing her blood to slowly run down his arms to drip into his wounds and kill him. In the manga adaption, George survives and is not turned into a chiropteran. He remains in Okinawa, patiently waiting for his children to come home, and welcomes them back at the end of the manga. Riku Miyagusuku is the adopted brother of Kai and Saya, the youngest of George Miyagusuku's three adopted children. He is a very kind and intelligent boy who loves to cook. His kind, gentle nature even rubs off on the reclusive Hagi to some degree, particularly after he brings Hagi a plate of food and asks him to join the others. Hagi teaches Riku how to play the cello and protects him from a bad injury after Riku falls from a moving train. After Diva drinks most of his blood at the \\"Zoo\\", Saya is forced to turn Riku into a chevalier to save his life. Afterwards, Riku shows a compulsion similar to Hagi's to protect Saya at any cost. Despite a brief estrangement, Riku remains close to his older brother Kai and works to heal the broken relationship between Kai and Saya after Kai learns the truth about her. Draining Riku's blood seems to cause Diva to develop a strong interest in him. She takes Karl to the Red Shield headquarters to find Riku. Once she finds him, she rapes him then kills him with her blood. In the light novel adaptation, it's explained that something in Diva's eyes causes the Chevalier blood in Riku to react with a \\"maddening desire\\" that causes him to be incapable of escaping or physically resisting Diva's actions. After Riku's death, Kai has a piece of his crystallized body made into a pendant, which he wears around his neck to remember his lost brother. In the manga adaptation, Riku befriends Charles (Karl) during his captivity. He is made into Saya's chevalier when he intervenes on Van's attempt to kill Charles. On Solomon's orders Diva attempts to mate with Riku but stops when he confuses her with Saya and she becomes upset. Riku becomes determined to save Diva from Saya, because he wants chiroptera (himself included) to peacefully co-exist with humans. Initially oblivious to Charles' death, Riku meets a clone of Charles whom he takes care of. Mao Jahana , the daughter of the head of the Jahana Yakuza, is often bossy and likes to be in control, a trait she probably picked up from her father. Her blunt, confrontational demeanor seems to be a brave facade she puts up whenever things don't go her way or she's scared. A strong-willed and stubborn schoolmate of Kai's, after Mao meets Okamura and realizes he knows something about Kai's disappearance, she forces him to take her along by financing the trip with money she steals from her father, implying he would try to kill Okamura for the theft. She is determined to stick by Kai's side, despite his best efforts to shield her from the danger surrounding him and Saya. As the series progresses and she comes to terms with Kai not returning her feelings, Mao warms up to Saya. The only girl \\"in a group of men,\\" she grows more protective and concerned about Saya's well-being as Saya's health seems to decline. When she accidentally overhears Saya and Hagi's conversation about Saya's impending thirty year hibernation cycle, Mao becomes furious and slaps her. She agrees to keep it a secret from the others, then tells Saya she will make a promise with her, a promise between two women, to personally bring Saya back to Okinawa once everything is over. Mao finally decides to test Kai's feelings once and for all and kisses him, but he doesn't respond and seems baffled by her actions. Realizing her love will never be returned, she gives up and tries playing matchmaker between Kai and Saya. She later accompanies Okamura to the Middle East. In the manga, Mao appears only at the beginning. She plans to put Saya in her play just to get Kai to come see it. After briefly bonding with Saya, Mao is horrified when she witnesses Saya recover from mortal injury by drinking her blood when the play is attacked by chiropterans. Julia Silverstein Julia Silverstein is a medical doctor working for the Red Shield. She is first seen in the series acting as Saya's doctor and supervising Saya's blood transfusions. She is committed to researching the true nature of chiropterans to help destroy them. Her supervisor and mentor, Dr. Collins, defects to Cinq Fl√®ches wanting to be able to publish his research and because he disagrees with the idea of killing chiropterans. He is able to convince Julia to join him and betray the Red Shield. She meets with David several times while he is investigating Cinq Fl√®ches and the Corpse Corps, and he always reminds her that she will be welcome back to the Red Shield when she is ready. When Diva becomes pregnant after raping Riku, Julia becomes her personal physician. This sends Collins into a jealous fit and he attempts to murder her, but David saves her and is shot instead. Afterwards, Julia keeps vigil over the critically wounded David in the hospital and is shown kissing him while he sleeps. She also returns to the Red Shield and is able to use the knowledge she gained to aid them in the final battle with Diva. After Diva is killed and the group returns to Okinawa, Julia is able to use the knowledge she gained to extend the Schiff Lulu's life span and develop a serum from Saya's blood that can stop the effects of the Delta 67 agent. She also is revealed to be pregnant with David's child. Lewis Lewis is an oversized brown-skinned man who is responsible for providing gadgets and transportation for the Red Shield operatives. He also provides intel from the CIA during American operations thanks to the connections formed when he was CIA agent, working under the name of Sammy. He regularly accompanies David during operations, and after Kai becomes a member of Red Shield they frequently work together as well. In the English dub of the series, Lewis is given a Jamaican accent despite his being a native-Okinawan in the original Japanese track. Van Argiano Van Argiano is a Frenchman and the head scientist studying chiropterans for Cinq Fl√®ches. He was in charge of the development of Delta 67, working under Solomon and with his assistant Archer. After Solomon defected from the group, Amshel appoints him to the head of the Cinq Fl√®ches American branch. Despite knowing their true nature and plans, Van sided with the chiropterans and aided them in their efforts to spread chiropterans around the world. Van is often shown to be eating some kind of hard candy, sometimes offering some to colleagues. However, he was betrayed at the Metropolitan Opera House and was not told of the plans to turn people there into chiropterans. He was left to face the monsters on his own by his American contact, Secretary of Defense Grant, but is saved by David. At the end of the series, he is shown being taken to trial to face charges for his crimes. His assistant Archer is also revealed to be a government appointed investigator who had infiltrated Cinq Fl√®ches to gather evidence. In the manga, he acts as Charles aid, almost as a caretaker, frequently providing the chevalier with his trademark candy. Van is aloof and stoic and cold, viewing Charles only as a guinea pig and even tries to kill him when he has outlived his usefulness. While Van never pays for his crimes, he does save Solomon and is seen in the end with him. Akihiro Okamura , a somewhat jaded, down-on-his-luck, chain-smoking newspaper reporter, Okamura is the son of the photographer and Vietnam war correspondent who had taken several mysterious black-and-white photos depicting a young girl killing soldiers, villagers, and grotesque monsters with a sword. After seeing them as a child, the photographs have always haunted Okamura, spurring him to discover the truth behind them. After tracing wine dumped by the military to Vietnam, Okamura sees Saya fighting Karl and manages to take some pictures of her. He is caught by David, but later released. Back in Okinawa, his research comes to a standstill as his paper refuses to fund a trip to France to continue tracing the origins of the wine. He runs into Mao, who has been searching for Kai. When she realizes Okamura can help her find him, she forces him to pair up with her by stealing money from her Yakuza father and leaving a note saying she is running away with Okamura. As the pair continue exploring the truth, Okamura realizes that it is larger and more disturbing than he ever imagined. Okamura and Mao catch up with Saya and the others in Paris and are taken to the Red Shield headquarters. At first considered pests, David eventually taps Okamura's investigative abilities and requests their aid in looking into Diva's New York concert. After this, Okamura and Mao become unofficial members of Saya's group, first researching in Los Angeles, then joining them in New York after their apartment is blown up by Cinq Fl√®ches. Okamura tends to be relatively cynical, and though he often expresses annoyance at her tempestuous nature, he never seems to get tired of having Mao with him. Despite their regular bickering, they work well together. When he is asked to go with the others to Staten Island, Okamura leaves his favorite camera with Mao, asking her to look after it, though when she asks why he refuses to explain. At the end of the series, Okamura decides to go to the Middle East and Mao joins him. He is not shown in the manga at all. Joel Goldschmidt VI Joel Goldschmidt VI is the current head of the Red Shield and a descendant of the original Joel who found Saya and Diva. Every man in his family who bears the name Joel must live and fight against the chiroptera throughout their life until they are no longer a threat. His \\"diary\\" contains a record of all of the Red Shield's activities since its formation as well as all known information on Saya, Diva, the chevaliers and the chiroptera. Joel became the head of the Red Shield in 2002, Joel primarily works in the background, trusting his operatives to handle the day-to-day work while he supports them. When Diva and Karl attack the Red Shield headquarters, Joel is badly wounded and left paralyzed from the waist down. After David recovers emotionally from the destruction of the headquarters, Joel reforms the Red Shield to continue to support Saya and stop Diva. Aston Collins Dr. Aston Collins was once the second-in-command of the Red Shield, primarily in charge of researching the chiroptera with Julia as his assistant. He grew increasingly frustrated at being unable to ever publish his research. Van Argiano approaches him about joining Cinq Fl√®ches and Collins agrees. He betrays the Red Shield by revealing the location of the organization's headquarters. Collins convinces Julia to join him, but turns against her after Amshel makes her Diva's personal physician. Sent into a jealous rage, he confronts Julia and attempts to murder her so he can regain his position. Right as he is about to shoot her, David runs in and acts as a human shield to protect Julia. Despite being shot, David is able to throw a scalpel into Collins' arm which causes him to run away screaming. Collins is never seen again in the series and his current location is unknown. Moses is the leader of the Schiff who uses a scythe. He was the one who had encouraged the Schiff to leave the lab for the sake of hope. Clones of Moses are used to make up the Corpse Corps. He committed suicide along with Karman, who was about to die from Thorn, by both removing their hoods in direct sunlight. Karman is a tall, slender boy with a tendency to be aggressive, particularly towards humans. He can be hot- headed and impulsive, but seems to genuinely care for his fellow Schiff. After Karman is inflicted with the Thorn, he commits suicide with Moses. Lulu is a diminutive young girl with sunken eyes who befriends Saya's group after the death of Ir√®ne, despite the objections of Karman and Moses. Lulu has a somewhat innocent and childlike personality, and comes to enjoy some of the human elements of life such as watching television. After Karman and Moses kill themselves, Lulu becomes the last living Schiff and starts to live with Saya and the others. She continues to aid the Red Shield in the battle with Diva as best as she can. After Diva is killed, Julia is able to use the knowledge she gained while working with Cinq Fl√®ches to extend Lulu's life and ward off the Thorn. Ir√®ne is one of the Schiff, but unlike her companions she is greatly bothered by the idea of killing humans to drink their blood, refusing to do so despite its leaving her in a weakened state. She fights with a wide, double-sided sword. After Kai saves her from some thugs in Paris, Ir√®ne tells him how the Schiff came to exist, how they are dying from Thorn, and why they keep attacking Saya. She also tells him that they think Saya's blood will save them, so he offers to ask Saya. When the Schiff later attack Saya's group, she and Kai try to convince both sides to stop fighting because of their new friendship, but the fighting only stops when Ir√®ne collapses from her progressing Thorn. Saya reluctantly agrees to feed her some of her blood, but it ends up killing Ir√®ne. Her death is mourned by Kai, Saya, and the Schiff alike. Realizing its Diva's blood they really need, Ir√®ne's death is the precipice for the end of the hostilities between Saya's group and the Schiff. Forrest is a regular customer to George Miyugyasiku's bar. He ends up being attacked by a Chiropterian and is infected.

Doctrine Compensationism maintains that a doubtful law is not devoid of all binding force, and that there must be a compensating reason, proportionate to the probability and gravity of the law, to justify the performance of the action which is probably forbidden. This teaching is based on an analogy with an act which has two effects, one good and the other bad. It is not lawful to perform such an act unless there is a justifying cause proportionate to the evil. In the case of a doubtful law the bad effect is the danger of material sin, and the good effect is the benefit, which arises from the performance of the action which is probably forbidden. Hence in this as in the former case, a compensating cause, proportionate to the probable evil, is required to justify the performance of the action. Probabilists reply that this moral system leads to Tutiorism, because it implies that if no compensating benefit exists, it is not lawful to perform an action so long as it certainly is not forbidden. Again, Probabilists say that the preservation of liberty is of itself a sufficient compensating reason when there is question of a law which is not certain. Finally, Probabilists are prepared to admit that, as a point of expediency though not of obligation, it is advisable to look for a compensating cause over and above the preservation of liberty when a confessor is directing penitents in the use of probable opinions. If no such compensating reason exists, the penitent can be advised, though not under pain of sin, to abstain from the performance of the action which is probably forbidden.

The two aircraft collided in mid-air over Key West, killing all 43 aboard both aircraft. Flight history Flight 493 departed Miami at 11:09 a.m. that day and was cleared to climb to 4,000 feet on a direct heading to Key West. Approximately ten minutes later, the SNB-1 took off from Key West NAS for simulated instrument training. Although the flight was not cleared to a specific altitude or heading, standard instrument training procedures were in place. At 11:49 a.m. Flight 493, heading south, and the SNB-1, heading west, collided over the Key West NAS at an estimated altitude of 4,000 feet. Investigation Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) investigators determined that there were no mechanical problems with either aircraft. Both were operating under visual flight rules, as the weather at the time of the crash was clear and calm. The probable cause of the accident was given by the CAA as a failure on the parts of both air crews to exercise due vigilance in looking for and avoiding conflicting traffic.

It is the only surviving of several palaces formerly belonging to the Sapieha family in the city. The palace, ordered by Polish prince and Great Hetman of Lithuania Jan Kazimierz Sapieha the Younger was built in Baroque style in 1691-1697 in the place of former wooden mansion of Lew Sapieha (who died here in 1633). The palace was designed by Giovanni Pietro Perti and decorated with frescos by Michelangelo Palloni. The piano nobile has initially displayed Dutch tiles and mosaics representing blazons, churches, castles, and palaces owned or built by the Sapiehas. Originally, the palace had multi-floor arcades on its sides, which were later built up to gain more space inside the building. Jan Kazimierz Sapieha the Younger by building the luxurious Sapieha Palace ensemble wished to surpass the John III Sobieski projects and to show his power and ability to be a Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. In 1809 the palace was acquired by the Russian government and restructured (according to J√≥zef Poussier's design) into a military hospital in 1843. Much of the rich interior was destroyed throughout the 19th century. The exterior of the palace was restored only in 1927-1928 and the building housed University's ophthalmology institute until World War II. Since the war it has been used as military hospital again and fell into disrepair. Today the complex houses the Sapiega Hospital (). The palace is surrounded by the remains of the 17th-century formal park, with parterres, ponds, and avenues. The impressive Baroque gate secures the entrance to the park from the Antakalnis street and the other gate is in the opposite side of the park, near the palace. Both of them have been restored in 2012. Since 2012, the palace has been undergoing restoration, in an attempt to bring it as close as possible to its original Baroque appearance.

The album Periode was released in March 1998, and Magenta went on tour in Norway and Germany. They signed a new record deal in April 2001 with the German label Re:pop Music. In summer 2001. They recorded the album Little Girl Lost, with the producer Vegard Ibo Blomberg. The album was released in Germany on 24 June 2002, and was very well received in the German alternative press. It reached number 4 in the German Alternative Charts during fall 2002. Magenta made a video for \\"All Over\\" featuring the band Mortiis, and were surprised to find that The Coca-Cola Company wanted the song for their worldwide release of Sprite Zero. Magenta's best chart position so far has been for the CD single \\"All Over\\", which reached number 2 in the official charts in Greece on July 8, 2002, when the advertising campaign was shown there. Magenta played a number of gigs in 2002 and 2003 and then took some time off after the Arvika Festival in Sweden in 2003. In 2006, Magenta was reinforced with the bassplayer Daniel Hill. This was very inspiring for the band and led to one of the most creative periods in the band's history. Magenta released a track with Apoptygma Berzerk called \\"Friendly fire\\" in the beginning of 2006, and this led Magenta into a serious writing process for a new album. The first new song of the new direction was \\"Darkest Dream\\". Magenta was also strengthened by Jonas Groth who contributed to the production of the rest of the new album. Art and Accidents was released digitally in November 2008 and officially on February 9, 2009.Magenta ‚Äì Art And Accidents at Discogs This album was followed with a full European tour with Gothminister and Trail of Tears. Magenta was joined by the drummer, Erik Engebretsen, for this tour. With Hill now permanently on bass guitar, Magenta had for the first time in their history a stable live line up. Odden decided to explore new grounds for Magenta and decided to write lyrics in Norwegian: the idea came to him as an epiphany on stage in London on his birthday, 20 December 2009, when he performed with Satyricon watching 1000 Englishmen sing along to \\"Den Siste\\" in Norwegian. Magenta Aus Norwegen was recorded between September and December 2011 and was first be released as a series of digital EPs. The first single, \\"To Var Ett\\"/\\"Tvillingsj√§l\\" featured guest musicians Niklas Kvarforth and Peter Huss from the Swedish black metal band, Shining In the beginning of 2013, Magenta began recording their comeback album, Songs For the Dead, for which they have returned to their roots of dismal dark and misty music with enchanting vocals, in English. ‚ÄúSongs For The Dead‚Äù was born out of a deep tragedy. The Magenta family had been invited to stay at Ministry leader, Al Jourgensen‚Äôs 13th Planet Studios compound during the Xmas of 2012. They arrived the same day that Ministry guitarist Mike Scaccia left after finishing some recording. Shortly after, on December 22, news reached them that Mike had died. Everyone at Al‚Äôs compound was overwhelmed with grief. To try to get somewhat back to normal in the midst of this, they all decided to record something. Vilde and Anders‚Äô daughter, Regine, had written a song called \\"Ghost\\" in the castle of Duke Hank Von Hell (ex-Turbonegro) the Xmas before. They recorded this track with Al's magic touch and the idea for the album dedicated to those who have past on, was born. The album is like a requiem and is a new birth for Magenta. It is the first album Magenta have done that they feel represent them fully as the kind of musical entity they want to be. In March 2015 Magenta signed to well known industrial rock label, Cleopatra Records Cleopatra Records.

The company is based in Irvine, California, USA. Early history The company was founded in 1969 by Bob Boucher and Roland Boucher. Their goal was the development and production of a high-performance radio controlled sailplane for use in AMA- certified competition. That first sailplane, the \\"Malibu,\\" finished third in its very first outing in San Jose that same year. Bob Boucher would use a Malibu in 1970 to set a closed-course world record for soaring. His record flight of 302 km took place at Waimanalo Beach, Hawaii. The introduction of the Fournier RF-4 electric R/C airplane in 1971 marked the debut of the world's first practical electric-powered model airplane. This would be the model which Roland Boucher would use to set a world record for duration and distance with a flight of one hour and a distance of on a single charge. Since no official categories for electric flight existed at the time, neither the AMA nor the FAI recognized the record. The Northrop Corporation awarded Astro Flight a contract in 1972 to develop a low- altitude electric surveillance drone. Project manager Bob Boucher along with Roland Boucher and their lone employee Dave Shadel finished the design in only six months. The result was the Model 7212 flying wing. With a wingspan of 8', the 7212 was powered by three of the company's Astro 40 ferrite motors each turning a three-blade, 8x8 propeller. The 7212 would set another unofficial record in August 1973 by carrying a 7.5 pound lead payload over a closed course for an hour and twenty minutes at speeds reaching . The world's first solar-powered airplane Astro Flight was awarded a DARPA contract through Lockheed in 1974 in order to build the Sunrise, the world's first solar-powered airplane. The historic flight, powered only by sunlight, took place November 4, 1974 at Fort Irwin, California.NASA Two Astro Flight Astro 40 ferrite motors powered the craft via a 6:1 gearbox swinging a 36x24 wood propeller. More than one thousand solar cells on the wing were the sole source of energy, producing roughly 450 watts of power. The craft, weighing in at 27 pounds with its 32' wingspan, had a service ceiling of depending on available sunlight. 1975 saw both the departure of Roland Boucher and damage to Sunrise I in a windstorm. It also saw the introduction of the improved Sunrise II, built in just three months. Its maiden flight was on September 27, 1975 at Nellis AFB. Improvements included a single Astro Flight Cobalt 40 motor powered by 4480 solar cells with an output of 600 watts. Climb rate was drastically improved at over per minute as was the estimated service ceiling of , although actual flights did not exceed due to problems with both command and control. The world's first human-carrying solar-powered airplane Gossamer Penguin In 1979, DuPont sponsored Dr. Paul MacCready in his attempt to create a solar powered plane capable of carrying a human. The result was the Gossamer Penguin which had its first flight on May 16, 1980 in Shafter, California. It utilized the 600 watt solar panel used to power Sunrise II along with a production version Cobalt 40 motor. Thrust was via a three-stage transmission turning an 11' propeller at 120 rpm. Motor speed was 15,000 rpm. The success of Gossamer Penguin prompted DuPont to agree to sponsor a solar plane capable of crossing the English Channel. The Dupont Solar Challenger required three months to build the solar panels with their 16,128 cells. The setup was capable of 4000 watts at operating altitude and 2500 watts at sea level. A motor, specially designed for the project, turned 9000 rpm through a 22:1 belt-drive reduction unit, resulting in a propeller speed of about 400 rpm. On July 7, 1981, pilot Steve Ptacek piloted the Dupont Solar Challenger from Pontoise, France to the Manston RAF base in Kent, England. Today, Astro Flight continues to provide hobbyists with motors, battery chargers and electronic speed controls. Their model 4005 AC/DC battery charger, introduced in 1982 at the Toledo R/C Show became an industry standard, with more than 500,000 units produced over the next decade. They serve industrial customers with custom-made brushless motors. Their Astro Model 300 ten-horsepower DC motor is the same one used in the GM Sunraycer experimental solar powered automobile.

He is the leader of the ARIA Award- winning Melbourne Ska Orchestra, frontman of his band, Bomba, as well as the former drummer and percussionist of John Butler Trio (2003‚Äì04, 2009‚Äì13). He has performed in other acts and as a solo artist. Note: [on-line] version was expanded from the 2002 edition. His youngest sister, Danielle Caruana, (who performs as Mama Kin), is married to his former bandmate, John Butler. His older brother, Michael Caruana, is a member of Bomba and of Mama Kin's backing band. Biography Nicholas Caruana was born on 7 September 1963 in Malta, he later performed under the name Nicky Bomba. His father, Nicholas \\"Nicol\\" Caruana (born 4 June 1933) and mother, Iris (born 8 October 1934) had four children, Josephine, Michael, Carmen and Nicholas, in Malta. The family migrated to Australia in late 1964 and lived in the Melbourne suburb of Newport. They had two more children, including their youngest daughter, Danielle (who later performed as Mama Kin). Bomba started learning drums when he was six years old. In 1978 Bomba formed a cover band with his brother, Michael, called Fugitive Flight. In 1982 they began playing original music with Peter Miller on lead vocals, Steve Morgan on bass guitar (later of Icehouse), and Peter Weeda on guitar. They soon changed their name to Guided Tour. After working in a variety of lesser known bands, Bomba formed The Truth in 1991 in Melbourne as a funk group. Initially Bomba was on drums with Michael on keyboards, Tony Kopa on lead vocals and Geoff Wells on guitars. Their debut single, \\"Secrets\\", was recorded in December 1992 and was followed by \\"My Heavy Friend\\" (1993). The Truth released a self-titled album in 1995, and in 1997 added a bass player, Mick Girasole, for the release of their second album, Headspace with the band re-branded as Truth. The Truth broke up in late 1997. Back in September 1996 Bomba had supplied drums for The Ross Hannaford Trio, with Hannaford on lead vocals and guitar and Howard Cairns on bass guitar. The trio issued a self-titled album on Mushroom Records before Hannaford disbanded the group. By 1998 Bomba had formed a jazz band, Banana Oil, with Andy Baylor on guitar, Tim Neal on keyboards and David Williamson on saxophone. They released an album, Guavo Lampo. At the APRA Music Awards of 1998 Banana Oil members, Bomba (as Nicholas Caruana), Chris Tabone and Trevor Wright, won Most Performed Jazz Work for their composition, \\"My Family\\". The group were also nominated in the same category for \\"\\"Baylorology\\" by Baylor and \\"Neal Shuffle\\" by Neal. In 1999 he formed Bomba as a reggae-funk group with himself on guitar, percussion and lead vocals; Simon Bourke on keyboards; Phil Bywater on alto and tenor saxophones and clarinet; Paul Coyle on trumpet and trombone; Barry Deenick on bass guitar and vocals; George Servanis on drums, percussion and vocals; and Mal Webb on trombone and vocals. In 2003 his brother, Michael, replaced Bourke on keyboards. By 2006 the group had released four albums, Population (April 2000), Solar Plexus (February 2002), Learn to Breathe (March 2005) and Bomba Vs. Laroz (September 2006). In 2000 Bomba together with fellow musician, Joe Camilleri, founded Transmitter Records. In March 2003 Bomba founded the Melbourne Ska Orchestra with an ensemble of between 27 and 32 musicians. His \\"idea was to get as many horn players as possible on stage at the same time playing ska skank, the accented upbeat that is typical of ska, the genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s.\\" In November that year Bomba joined John Butler (his brother-in-law), together with Shannon Birchall on upright bass, as part of the John Butler Trio to record that group's third studio album, Sunrise Over Sea. In March 2004, after the release of the album, he resumed his association with Bomba and with Melbourne Ska Orchestra. During 2006 Bomba and Camilleri released, Limestone, an album of covers and original music. In 2007 he recorded an album of Maltese songs, Nicol Caruana, with his father, Nicol. This was followed in 2008 by his first solo release an extended play, Jah in the Moment, which he then toured with a trio around Australia. In 2009 he released, Planet Juice, his first solo album, on which he played drums, guitar, ukulele and marimba. Nicky Bomba at a rally in Warburton, Victoria, 2008 By July 2009 he had re-joined John Butler Trio, now with Byron Luiters on bass guitar alongside Butler. They recorded the group's fifth studio album, April Uprising (March 2010). Bomba and Butler co-wrote the track, \\"Take Me\\". The trio's sixth album, Flesh & Blood, was released in February 2014. On 31 August 2013, Butler announced that Bomba had left John Butler Trio. Bomba appears on ten of its eleven tracks and co-wrote material with Butler and Luiters. During 2012 Bomba focussed on a side-project, Bustamento, to perform mento music with a line-up of Bomba band members, Michael, Coyle, Deenick and Servanis, and new collaborators, Lennox Jordan on steelpans and Peter Mitchell on saxophone. They recorded Intrepid Adventures to the Lost Riddim Islands over a week-end and released it on 14 May 2012; they followed with a tour in June and July. Bustamento issued their second album, Intercontinental Journey 7, on 28 November 2014. Lukas Murphy of Issuu magazine felt the album was \\"to be taken with a healthy dose of carefreeness\\" as exemplified by lyrics where \\"nonsense is rarely utilised in such a juxtapositional way, matched with both expertise and musical frivolity.\\" From September 2014 Bomba worked with Melbourne Ska Orchestra to provide a musical accompaniment to the fireworks display for Melbourne's New Year's Eve celebrations. Personal life Bomba's sister, Danielle Caruana, performs as Mama Kin, and is married to John Butler. His brother Michael Caruana also plays in Mama Kin and Bomba.

Dadhichi is primarily known for sacrificing his life so the Devas, or benevolent celestial beings, could make the weapon called \\"vajra\\" from his bones. After being driven out from Svarga, or heaven, by the serpent king Vritra, the Devas needed a powerful weapon to aid their fight. By making use of the vajra, made from the sage Dadhichi's bones, the Devas defeated the Asura and reclaimed heaven. Dadhyancha or Dadhyanga in Sanskrit is a conjunction of two words Dadhya (curd) + anch (parts), which means \\"body parts taking strength from Curd.\\" The name Dadhichi is a deteriorated form of Dadhyanga or Dadhyancha, as pointed out by famous ancient Sanskrit scholar Panini in his work Ashtaadhyaai. By defeating Vritra, the personification of drought, the Deva also released water to the living beings who were innocent victims of the evil Asura. By helping the Deva defeat the Asura through his sacrifice, Dadhichi became revered among the Rishi, or Hindu sages, for his selflessness. Dadhichi symbolizes the notion that no sacrifice is too great in order to help defend the defenseless from evil. This symbolization has inspired the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military award for gallantry, which is most often posthumously awarded to soldiers who show exceptional courage in battle. Dadhichi is also known as an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva. After Shiva was separated from Shakti, a goddess personifying the sacred feminine, he went to a forest to live in seclusion as a Rishi. The annual festival of Maha Shivratri marks the first time Lord Shiva appeared as a Rishi to his devotees, including Dadhichi and his disciples, who had been offering prayers to Shiva. In the Bhagavata Purana, Dadhichi was the son of the sage Atharvan and his wife Chiti. Atharvan is said to be the author of Atharvaveda, which is one of the four Vedas (a collection of texts upon which the Hindu religion is based). Chitti was the daughter of the sage Kardam. The Dadhich Brahmins, a Brahmin clan primarily found in Rajasthan, later migrating to other parts of the world, claim to be his descendants. The names of Dadhichi's wife and son were Swarcha and Pippalada, respectively. Pippalada was a rishi associated with the Pippalada school of thought in Hinduism, he is known for creating the Pra≈õna Upanishad. Dadhichi had established his ashram in Misrikh, in Naimisharanya near Lucknow, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Naimisharanya is cited in all of the puranas as the location of his ashram, which is still in existence. The current place of the Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad is also one of the ancient sites of his ashram. In Ancient India, sages often traveled long distances. It may be that he stayed near Sabarmati River for some time. The popular legend about Dahod also says that Sage Dadhichi once meditated at the banks of Dudhimati river in Dahod. Dudhimati is name of his sister , on whose name a 4th Century old temple exists in Naguar, Rajasthan as Dadhimati Mata Temple. His name is found in the 1st mandala of the Rigveda (Bhagavata Purana, Srimad Devi Bhagavatam and in the Puranas. Dadhichi is mentioned also in the various hymns (Richas ‚Äì Suktas) of Rigveda.Rigveda hymns 1.80.16, 1.84.13‚Äì14, 1.116.12, 1,117,22, 1.139.9, 9.108.4 Dadhichi is believed to have written the \\"Narayana Kavacham\\", a famous hymn in southern India, sung for power and peace. Dadhich Brahmins are descendants of Maharishi Dadhichi. Their deity is Dadhimathi, who was sister of Maharishi Dadhichi.  Legends  King of Deities Indra pray to Dadhichi to give his spinal cord to make a thunderbolt Dadhichi is associated with many Hindu legends and is sometimes portrayed as having a horse's head.  Ashwashira ‚Äì The One With The Horse's Head  Dadhichi is said to have been a master of a Vedic art known as Brahmavidya (Madhu Vidya) that would enable one to attain immortality. Indra, the King of the Devas, felt his position was insecure with such power in the hands of a mortal man, especially one with as much power as Dadhichi possessed by virtue of being a rishi. Indra was also against the Ashwini twins (Gods of Medicines) learning Brahmavidya and swore that he would behead the one who taught them the art. However the Ashwini twins wished to learn this art and devised a plan to protect Dadhichi from Indra's power. They learned the art from Dadhichi and thereafter cut off his head, preserving it and replacing the original head with one from a horse. Indra, blinded by wrath, beheaded the horse-headed sage and left. The Ashwini twins then replaced Dadhichi original head to the beheaded body and revived Dadhichi with the Madhuvidya that he had taught them. This was how the sage came to be called Ashvashira ‚Äì The One with the Horse's head.  Defeating Kshuva and Indra :-  Once Dadhichi and a king named Kshuva, a devotee of Vishnu, got into an argument over superiority of Kings over Brahmans and vice versa. Dadhichi punched Kshuva and Kshuva attacked Dadhichi with Thunderbolt. The injured sage was treated by Shukracharya. Dadhichi then did heavy penance to Lord Shiva who granted him three boons:- 1. He will never be Humiliated 2. He could never be killed 3. His bones will become as hard as a Diamond. Dadhichi returned to Kshuva and this time he defeated him. When Kshuva asked Lord Vishnu for help, the latter tried to trick Dadhichi. Dadhichi discovered the ruse, and attacked with the Trishula, upon which, all deities except for Lord Vishnu fled the scene. In spite of this hostility, Dadhichi had utmost respect for Lord Vishnu. When the demigods approached Dadhichi for his bones in their struggle against Vritra, Dadhichi readily agreed hearing that they have been sent by the Lord Vishnu.  Indra and Vritra ‚Äì The Tale of the Vajrayudha  Indra, the King of the Devas, was once driven out of Devaloka by an asura named Vritra. This asura was the recipient of a boon which made him invulnerable to any known weapon. This Demon, Vritra, also stole all the water in the world for his own use and for that of his Demon army. He did this so that all other living beings would die of thirst and hunger, leaving no Human or God alive to challenge his place in Heaven. Indra, who had lost all hope of recovering his kingdom, went to seek the aid of Vishnu. Vishnu revealed to Indra that only weapons made from the thunder-containing (called in Sanskrit as Vajra) diamond bones of the sage Dadhichi could kill Vritra. Indra and the other Devas therefore approached the sage, whom Indra had once beheaded, and asked him for his aid in defeating Vritra. Dadhichi acceded to the Devas' request, but said that he wished that he had time to go on a pilgrimage to all the holy rivers before he gave up his life for them. Indra then brought all the water of the holy rivers together at Naimisharanya, thereby allowing the sage to have his wish fulfilled without a further loss of time. Dadhichi then went into a deep meditative state and released his life force from his body. The celestial Kamadhenu Calf then licked and removed the flesh from his bones, after which the Devas fashioned the Vajrayudha (Thunderbolt) from his spine and made numerous other weapons. This weapon was then used to kill the asura, allowing Indra to reclaim his place as the king of devaloka and releasing the water for all living beings. Another version of the story exists where Dadhichi was asked to safeguard the weapons of the devas, as they were unable to match the arcane arts being employed by the asuras to obtain them. Dadhichi is said to have kept at the task for a very long time and, finally tiring of the job, is said to have dissolved the weapons in sacred water, which he then drank. The devas returned some time later and asked him to return their weapons so that they might defeat the asuras, headed by Vritra, once and for all. Dadhichi, however, told them of what he had done and informed them that their weapons were now a part of his bones. Realizing that his bones were the only way by which the devas could defeat the asuras, he willingly gave his life in a pit of mystical flames that he summoned with the power of his austerities. Brahma is then said to have fashioned a large number of weapons from Dadhichi's bones, including the Vajrayudha, which was fashioned from his spine. The devas are then said to have defeated the asuras using the weapons thus created.  Other legends  Various other legends are associated with Dadhichi. Dadhichi is said to have been the first to leave from Daksha's yagna when he realized that Shiva had not been invited due to spite.Mudgala Purana 1.3.19 The mantra or incantation for Devi Hinglaj is attributed to Dadhichi. To save some Kshatriya children from being killed by Parshurama, Dadhichi hid them inside the temple of Hinglaj and created the incantation of Hinglaj to protect them from Parshurama's wrath.

Harvey was a long-serving correspondent and contributor with the Nine Network from 1975 to 2013. Career Harvey studied his journalism cadetship with the Sydney newspaper The Daily Telegraph and won a Walkley Award in 1964. He worked at radio stations 2UE and 2GB before moving to London and working for BBC Radio. He then went on to The Guardian (where he received the British Reporter of the Year Award for a series of articles about the sale of confidential information) and the American Newsweek magazine as a reporter in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Harvey changed to television when he joined the Nine Network in 1973 and served as its news director in the network's Canberra bureau for many years. One of his first major stories was the dismissal of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in November 1975. It was from this work, and his regular political reporting on Nine's flagship nightly news bulletins, that his sonorous closing line of \\"Peter Harvey, Canberra\\" and deep baritone voice became something of a catchphrase and was lampooned by numerous comedians, including Australian television's Full Frontal and The Late Show. Harvey also reported for the network from numerous international trips by Australian prime ministers and was based in Saudi Arabia in 1990 with American forces at the commencement of the first Gulf War. He transferred from Canberra to the network's Sydney headquarters in February 1997. In later years he contributed to Today and 60 Minutes, where he presented a weekly viewers' feedback segment. Harvey was awarded a Centenary Medal in 2001, for service to Australian society in journalism.HARVEY, Peter Michael (Centenary Medal), It's an Honour, 1 January 2001.

Teaching #If the opinions for and against the current existence of a law have equal or nearly equal probabilities, it is permissible to act on the less safe opinion. #If the opinions for and against the cessation of a previously existing law have equal or nearly equal probabilities, then it is not permissible to act on the less safe opinion. #If the safe opinion is certainly more probable than the less safe opinion, then it is unlawful to follow the less safe opinion. With the first of these propositions Probabilists agree‚Äîbut they deny the truth of the second and third propositions (cf. Marc, \\"Institutiones Morales\\", I, nn. 91-103). Arguments for √Üquiprobabilism # In proof of their first proposition, √Üquiprobabilists quote, among other things, the axiom: in dubio melior est condition possidentis. When the doubt regards the existence, as distinguished from the cessation of a law, liberty is in possession and accordingly the opinion which favours liberty can be followed in practice. # In proof of their second proposition, √Üquiprobabilists quote the same axiom: in pari delicto melior est conditio possidentis. When the doubt concerns the cessation of a law, the law is in possession, and therefore the law must be observed until it is displaced by a stronger probability in favour of liberty. Probabilists reply to this argument that liberty is always in possession, since law and obligation presuppose liberty in the subject. # In proof of the third proposition √Üquiprobabilists put forward various arguments, of which the following are the most forcible: ## A person is bound to endeavour to bring his actions into harmony with objective morality. But a person who follows the less probable opinion in favour of liberty fails to observe this dictate of prudence, and consequently acts unlawfully (cf. Wouters \\"De Minusprobabilismo\\", p. 71). Probabilists reply that this argument would end in Rigorism if carried to its logical conclusion. Because the only way efficiently to bring our actions into perfect harmony with objective morality is to follow the safe opinion so long as the less safe opinion has not acquired moral certainty. This is the only way of preventing all serious danger of committing material sin and consequently is the only way of observing perfect harmony with objective morality. However, since Rigorism is universally condemned, the argument must be rejected, and the principles of Probabilism must be adopted which hold that it is sufficient to observe harmony with objective morality insofar as this is known with moral certainty (cf. Lehmkuhl, \\"Theologia Moralis\\", I, n. 191). ## On 26 June 1680 the Holy Office, under the presidency of Innocent XI, issued, in connection with the teaching of Thyrsus Gonzalez, S.J., a Decree of which the authentic text was published 19 April 1902, by the Secretary of the Holy Office. So much controversy has recently arisen in regard to the value of decree, that it is advantageous to quote the whole text: \\"A report having been made by Father Laurea of the contents of a letter directed by Father Thyrsus Gonzalez, S.J., to Our Most Holy Lord; the Most Eminent Lords said that the Secretary of State must write to the Apostolic Nuncio of the Spains [directing him] to signify to the said Father Thyrsus that His Holiness, having received his letter favourably, and having read it with approval, has commanded that he [Thyrsus] shall freely and fearlessly preach, teach, and defend with his pen the more probable opinion, and also manfully attack the opinion of those who assert that in a conflict of a less probable opinion with a more probable, known and estimated as such, it is allowed to follow the less probable; and to inform him that whatever he does and writes on behalf of the more probable opinion will be pleasing to His Holiness. - Let it be enjoined upon the Father General of the Society of Jesus, as by order [de ordine] of His Holiness, not only to permit the Fathers of the Society to write in favour of the more probable opinion and to attack the opinion of those who assert that in a conflict of a less probable opinion with a more probable, known and estimated as such, it is allowed to follow the less probable- but also to write to all the Universities of the Society [informing them] that it is the mind of His Holiness that whosoever chooses may freely write in favour of the more probable opinion, and may attack the aforesaid contrary [opinion]; and to order them to submit entirely to the command of His Holiness.\\" √Üquiprobabilists say that in this Decree there is a clear expression of the mind of Innocent XI about the morality of teaching that it is permissible to act on the less safe opinion when the safe opinion is certainly more probable. The pope disapproves of this teaching, commends Father Gonzalez for his opposition to it, and orders the General of the Jesuits to allow full liberty so that anyone who pleases may write against it. Probabilists reply that, though Innocent XI was opposed to Probabilism, his official Decree merely commanded that liberty of teaching be allowed to the members of the order. Moreover, they point out that Gonzalez was not an √Üquiprobabilist, but a Probabiliorist of a strict type whom St. Alphonsus Liguori regarded as an extremist.

In 1940, she married Harry Whitman, and they divorced in 1945. Nocona Boot Company The Nocona Boot Company Her father was the famed boot-maker Herman Joseph Justin, who cobbled his first pair of boots while working in a Texas barber shop. A student of the boot-making craft herself, Enid opened the Nocona Boot Company in 1925 after her brothers, John, Sr., Avis, and Earl, decided to move her father's business to Fort Worth, Texas. > I designed my first pair of boots when I was 14; I got the idea for the > pattern from a velvet-brocaded couch.--Enid Justin at the National Cowgirl > Museum and Hall of Fame Enid Justin launched her company with employees from her father's business. Her husband, Julius, served as president, and Enid worked many jobs including shipping clerk, bill collector, and salesperson. The discovery of oil in Nocona's North Field in 1926 brought new business to the bootmakers, who supplied lace-up boots to oil field workers. The company prospered, even during the Great Depression and World War II period and moved to a new . facility on U.S. Route 82 in 1947. Nocona Boot Company became one of the top five boot-makers in the country as a result of Justin's intrepid work ethic, diligence, and devotion to her employees. The company expanded in the late 1970s and early 1980, having opened factories in Vernon and Gainesville, Texas. In 1981, Enid Justin merged the company with her brothers' Justin Industries. Throughout the 1980s, she continued to devote her energies to civic actions and causes. She donated to expand the Nocona City Park and to underwrite both boys' and girls' Little League programs. On October 14, 1990, Enid Justin died in Nocona at the age of ninety-six. In 1999, Justin Industries closed the Nocona Boot Company plant in Nocona and consolidated all boot-making at El Paso, Texas, and Cassville, Missouri, thus ending more than a century of quality boot-making in Nocona.

It was first published by Del Rey Books in 1985. It was the eighth of Kurtz' Deryni novels to be published, and the second book in her third Deryni trilogy, The Histories of King Kelson. Although The Legends of Camber of Culdi trilogy was published immediately prior to the Histories trilogy, the Histories trilogy is a direct sequel to Kurtz' first Deryni series, The Chronicles of the Deryni. Plot introduction The novel is set in the land of Gwynedd, one of the fictional Eleven Kingdoms. Gwynedd itself is a medieval kingdom similar to the British Isles of the 12th century, with a powerful Holy Church (based on the Roman Catholic Church), and a feudal government ruled by a hereditary monarchy. The population of Gwynedd includes both humans and Deryni, a race of people with inherent physic and magical abilities who have been brutally persecuted and suppressed for over two centuries. The novel begins four months after the conclusion of The Bishop's Heir, and the plot details the continuing efforts of King Kelson Haldane to defeat the combined forces of a political adversary and a fanatical religious enemy. Plot summary The plot of The King's Justice spans a period of two months, from May 1124 to July 1124. The novel begins as King Kelson Haldane is making final preparations to launch a military campaign into the province of Meara. Although Meara has been a part of Gwynedd for over a century, a descendant of the ancient Mearan rulers, Caitrin Quinnell, has gathered an army and risen against Kelson to secure her place as queen of an independent and sovereign Meara. Additionally, Caitrin has allied herself with Edmund Loris, the rabidly anti-Deryni former-Archbishop who has managed to escape from his imprisonment. Kelson plans to set the Haldane potential in his uncle, Prince Nigel Haldane, before his departure, ensuring that his family's legacy of magic will not perish if Kelson should not survive the war. However, Kelson's plan deeply concerns the Camberian Council, who has long believed that multiple Haldanes cannot wield the Haldane magic simultaneously. Further complicating matters is the ill-timed return of Kelson's mother, Queen Jehana, whose anti-Deryni sentiments cause considerable friction with her son. Nonetheless, Kelson carries through with his plan and sets the Haldane potential in his uncle. The following day, Kelson sends off the first half of his army, placing it under the command of Bishop Duncan McLain and Earl Dhugal MacArdry. As Caitrin's forces prepare to do battle with Kelson's armies, Kelson receives the homage of King Liam Lajos II Furst√°n of Torenth, who travels to Rhemuth to acknowledge Kelson as Overlord of Torenth. However, Kelson decides to take both Liam and his mother as honorable hostages, ensuring that Torenth will make no aggressive move against Gwynedd while Kelson is occupied with the Mearan situation. Shortly thereafter, Kelson and Duke Alaric Morgan lead the second half of the royal army out from Rhemuth to meet the Mearan rebels. Over the following weeks, the Gwyneddan armies attempt to hunt down and destroy the Mearan forces. In the north, Loris and Sicard MacArdry, Caitrin's husband, continually elude Duncan and Dhugal. Meanwhile, in the south, Kelson and Morgan chase after Caitrin's son, Prince Ithel, whose own acts of rape and destruction have fueled Kelson's anger. Kelson eventually succeeds in capturing Ithel, who is summarily executed for his crimes. On the same day, Sicard and Loris lure the northern Gwyneddan army into a trap. Realizing that Loris is determined to capture him, Duncan orders Dhugal to flee the battle, hoping that the rest of the army will survive. Dhugal manages to escape the battle, but Duncan is defeated and captured. In Rhemuth, Jehana suffers a crisis of conscience when her own Deryni powers enable her to discover a Torenthi plot to assassinate Nigel. Jehana finally decides to warn Nigel, and the assassination attempt is foiled. Loris tortures Duncan horribly, mutilating the Deryni bishop in an attempt to force him to confess to charges of heresy. That night, Dhugal succeeds in contacting Kelson and informs the king of Duncan's plight. As Kelson's army marches through the night to rescue their comrades, Loris prepares to burn Duncan at the stake. However, Duncan's execution is interrupted by the arrival of Kelson's army. Both Kelson and Morgan use their Deryni powers to protect Duncan, but it is ultimately Dhugal who rescues the bishop. Kelson corners Sicard, but the Pretender's husband refuses to surrender. Unwilling to allow Sicard's defiance to cost additional lives, Kelson kills Sicard with a single arrow. The remaining Mearan soldiers throw down their arms, and the Gwyneddan army is victorious. After several days of resting the army, Kelson leads his host to Laas, the Mearan city to which Caitrin has fled. Kelson demands the Pretender's surrender, and Dhugal convinces his aunt to accede to the king's terms. After Kelson's army takes possession of the city, Loris and his aide are executed for their crimes, and Kelson reluctantly orders the execution of the last member of Caitrin's family, Prince Judhael. With the Pretender's bloodline extinguished and her army defeated, Kelson secures his authority over the land of Meara.

The poll was won by Roger Zelazny for his novel, Trumps of Doom. (Kurtz and Zelazny were also finalists for the 1971 and 1973 Mythopoeic Fantasy Awards.) This was the highest ranking for any of Kurtz' Deryni novels on the annual poll, matching the sixth-place ranking of Kurtz' Camber the Heretic in the 1982 poll.

He came from the noble family of Yelizarovs, descended from Yelizar, the son of tatarian prince Yegud, who served Vasili II. In the winter of 1647‚Äî1648, by order of the Novgorod prikaz, Yelizarov searched the Stroganovs' and monasteries' estates for fugitive peasants, and settled them at the Kungurka River, \\"so that they would live under the Sovereign and not run away anywhere.\\" Elizarov assigned oversight of the settlement construction to his representative Surovtsev and podyachy Vakhtin. The 1,222 people settled at Kungurka were exempted from taxes for three years and received plots of land. These steps attracted the fugitives who were earlier hiding in the wood. Thus the town of Kungur was founded. Yelizarov is also known for taking a census of the Stroganovs' estates in 1647, by order of Alexis I. He composed the census books which are now of great interest to historians, since they contained the earliest mentions of several cities and towns of Perm Krai.

He was known for displaying various feats of strength, including setting a British record in 1938 by lying on his back, and pulling over at arm's length a 200-pound barbell. At 240 pounds, Assirati was one of the heaviest men to perform the iron cross. Career Assirati began weight-training at the age of twelve. At the age of seventeen, Assirati formed part of the acrobatic stage duo Mello and Nello. Travelling to every port they could reach, the pair performed a variety of hand-balancing acts. At the age of twenty, Assirati began his career as a professional wrestler, but continued to train as a weight-lifter. At his highest weight, he was one of the strongest men in the world, and could still perform such acrobatic maneuvres as the iron cross and a one-arm hand stand. After winning matches, Assirati would perform a standing back flip. In 1938, Assirati deadlifted 800 pounds. He trained for his career in wrestling under Atholl Oakeley. Assirati was known as a vicious competitor. He is said to have taken pleasure in injuring his opponents, and often refused to play along with the predetermined nature of professional wrestling. Many promoters were reluctant to book him, because of his reputation for double- crossing his opponents, and many wrestlers were said to be afraid to wrestle him. Assirati stated that Lou Thesz was one of the wrestlers afraid to face him. In one version of the story, Assirati challenged Thesz to a match, but Thesz refused. According to Thesz's account in his autobiography, he challenged Assirati for a series of wrestling matches, but Assirati did not respond to his request. Wrestler Les Thornton stated that Assirati's eagerness to hurt people in the ring helped establish credibility for competitors who were willing to face him. Assirati won his first major championship while competing in the British Wrestling Association (BWA). He had claimed to be the British Heavyweight Champion but did not win the title officially until 27 January 1945. Two years later, he also won the European version of the World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Paul Yvar Martinsen in the final round of a tournament on 18 February 1947. He later dropped this title to Martinson but continued to hold the British Heavyweight Championship. To this, he added the European Heavyweight Championship in 1949 by defeating Felix Miquet. Miquet regained the title belt later that year, however. In 1950, Assirati left the British Wrestling Association to wrestle in India. As a result, he was stripped of the British Heavyweight Championship. He returned to Europe and won back the European Heavyweight Championship in 1952. After Assirati was chosen to wrestle the long time AWA World Heavyweight Champion Maurice Tillet The French Angel who was known as Unstoppable, and had won for a span of 19 consecutive months. Tillet's final wrestling match was in Singapore on February 14, 1953, he was working for The National Wrestling Alliance Mid South Area then known as Tri-State and owned by Leroy McGuirk had agreed to lose to Bert Assirati, because Tillet's health had begun to fail due to being diagnosed with acromegaly at the early age of 20. The condition usually caused by a benign tumor on the pituitary gland, resulting in bone overgrowth and thickening. Because of this Tillet could no longer be advertise as Unstoppable. Shortly after Tillet died on September 4, 1954, in Chicago, from cardiovascular disease. Afterwards Assirati, again, left for India and was forced to vacate the title. In 1955, he won his final championship by defeating Ernie Baldwin for the vacant British Heavyweight Championship. He was stripped of the title in 1958 by Joint Promotions, the governing body, although the British Wrestling Federation (BWF) continued to recognize him as their champion. In 1960, Assirati sustained an injury, and the BWF stripped him of the title as well. The championship was awarded to Shirley Crabtree, later better known as Big Daddy. Disgusted with the choice of successor, Assirati began a (non storyline and unauthorised) campaign of harassment against the new champion at shows until Crabtree retired for six years in 1966.The Wrestling, Simon Garfield, Faber & Faber 1997 Later in his life, Bert worked as doorman at the Ebbisham Halls in Epsom, Surrey, especially on the dance nights when many of the top acts of the sixties were playing there. He used to enjoy showing a party trick of placing a metal drink cap between each of the fingers on both hands and completely crush them all at once. On 31 August 1990, Assirati died of bladder cancer. In 1996, he became one of the first inductees to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame.
