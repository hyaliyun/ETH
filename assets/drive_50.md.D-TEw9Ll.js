Historical context Ball games played between opposing teams were widespread in pre-modern Europe. Many localities are known to have had a variety including the Calcio of Florence and La Soule of northern France In Scotland football games were common enough for the Scottish Parliament to attempt to outlaw them on several occasions. The act of 1457, under James II, is typical.Laws forbidding football and golf in Scotland. (National Library Of Scotland). The act was principally intended to encourage archery practice but decreed that football, and also golf, should be simultaneously discouraged. :Item. It is ordanyt and decretyt that Wapinschawing be haldin be the lordis and baronys spirituale and temporale four tymes in the yeir. And that the futebawe and the golf be uterly cryt done and not usyt. or in translation, :Item. It is ordained and decreed that weapon shows be held by the Lords and Barons, Spiritual and Temporal, four times a year and that football and golf be utterly cried down and not used. Several ball games which appear to predate the modern era exist in modern Scotland. The Kirkwall Ba Game is an example. The text Modern Association Football (Saint Mirren versus Hamilton Accies) The Bewties Of The Fute-ball is preserved only in the Maitland Folio Manuscript of the latter sixteenth century. It consists of two pairs of rhyming couplets and it is attributed to no author. :Brissit brawnis and brokin banis, :Stride, discord and waistie wanis. :Crukit in eild syne halt withal, :Thir are the bewties of the fute-ball. In Modern Scots: :Birsed brawns an breuken banes, :Stride, discord an wastie hames. :Creukit in eild syne haut withaw, :Thir are the beauties o the fitbaw. The poem might be translated into modern English as, :Torn muscles and broken bones, :Strife, discord and impoverished homes. :Stooping in old age then lameness too, :Those are the beauties of football. It is not clear whether the poem is genuinely criticising the game for its roughness or praising it ironically for the same reason.

The management of the company is usually replaced by an insolvency practitioner whose statutory duty is to rescue the company, save the business, or get the best result possible. It is the equivalent of Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code, although with significant differences. While creditors with a security interest over all a company's assets could control the procedure previously through receivership, the Enterprise Act 2002 made administration the main procedure. History The Insolvency Act 1986, Schedule B1 contains the procedure for a company entering administration, as updated by the Enterprise Act 2002. It was first introduced following the Cork Report's priorities for transparency, accountability and collectivity and, crucially, fostering a rescue culture for business.See E McKendrick, Goode on Commercial Law (4th edn Penguin 2010) 928 and Colin Gwyer & Associates Ltd v London Wharf (Limehouse) Ltd [2003] BCC 885, on the \\"rescue culture\\". Appointment In general the conditions for a court to grant an administration order are first, whether the company is insolvent, or 'is or is likely to become unable to pay its debts'. Second, it has to be shown that one of the purposes of administration in paragraph 3 will be achieved.Insolvency Act 1986, schedule B1, para 11 In Re Harris Simons Construction Ltd Hoffmann J held that 'likely to achieve the purpose of administration' meant a test lower than balance of probabilities, and more like whether there was a 'real prospect' of success or a 'good arguable case' for it. So here the company was granted an administration order, which led to its major creditor granting funding to continue four building contracts.See also Re AA Mutual International Insurance Co Ltd [2004] EWHC 2430, [2005] 2 BCLC 8, Lewison J held the test for debts in para 11(a) is \\"more probable than not\\", while for achieving purposes in para 11(b) it was \\"real prospect\\". =Floating charge holders= When applying to the court, the petitioners for administration may be either the company's directors, or any creditor.Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, para 12 But an important change since the Enterprise Act 2002 is that it is also possible for a director and, crucially, the holder of a floating charge over the company's whole property to apply for appointment of an administrator out of court.Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, paras 22 and 14 If a director applies for an out of court appointment, they must give 5 days' notice to any such qualifying floating chargee, who may in turn intervene in court to have their own 'specified person' appointed as the administrator.Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, paras 22-26 The court may refuse if the 'particular circumstances of the case' (undefined) suggest otherwise.Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule, para 36 The effect is that the holder of a qualifying floating charge is in a robust position to have their preferred insolvency practitioner installed. =Pre-packaged administration= Because an administrator can, since the Enterprise Act 2002, be appointed out of court, a new practice of pre-packaged administration became increasingly popular, whereby typically the company directors negotiate with a prospective administrator for the sale of the business to take place immediately after entering administration, and often to the company's former management.cf the definition in Institute of Chartered Accountants, Statement of Insolvency Practice 16, known as \\"SIP 16\\", para 1 The perceived benefits of this practice, originating in the 1980s in the United States,See generally, V Finch, 'Pre-packaged Administrations: Bargaining in the Shadows of Insolvency or Shadowy Bargains?' [2006] JBL 568, 569 is that a quick sale without hiring lawyers and expending time or business assets through formalities, can be effected to keep the business running and employees in their jobs. The potential downside is that because a deal is already agreed among the controlling interested parties (directors, insolvency practitioners and usually the major secured creditor) before broader consultation, unsecured creditors are left behind as the momentum behind the deal carries events forward. The concern in the business community is thus that a plan gets foisted on creditors without much time for consideration that works most in favour of the people who ran the company or the large secured lender. In Re Kayley Vending Ltd, which concerned an in-court appointed administrator,[2009] EWHC 904 (Ch), [2009] BCC 578 HH Judge Cooke held that a court will ensure that applicants for a prepack administration provide enough information for a court to conclude that the scheme is not being used to disadvantage unsecured creditors. Moreover, while the costs of arranging the prepack before entering administration will count for the purpose of administrator's expenses, it is less likely to do so if the business is sold to the former management. Here the sale of a cigarette vending machine business was to the company's competitors, and so the deal was sufficiently \\"arm's length\\" to raise no concern. In their conduct of meetings, the Court of Appeal made clear in Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Maxwell that administrators appointed out of court will be scrutinised in the way they treat unsecured creditors. Here the administrator did not treat the Revenue as having sufficient votes against the company's management buyout proposal, but the court substituted its judgment and stated the number of votes allowed should take account of events all the way in the run up to the meeting, including in this case the Revenue's amended claim for unlawful tax deductions to the managers' trust funds and loans to directors.[2010] EWCA Civ 1379 Moratorium When an administrator is appointed, she will replace the directors.Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, para 67 Under paragraph 40, creditors are precluded by a statutory moratorium from bringing enforcement procedures to recover their debts, including a bar on secured creditors taking and or selling assets subject to security with leave of the court.Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, paras 40‚Äì44 The moratorium is fundamental to keeping the business's assets intact and giving the company a \\"breathing space\\" for the purpose of a restructure, and even extends to a moratorium on the enforcement of criminal proceedings. So in Environmental Agency v Clark,[2001] Ch 57 the Court of Appeal held that the Environment Agency needed court approval to bring a prosecution against a polluting company, though in the circumstances leave was granted. In Re Atlantic Computer Systems Ltd (No 1),[1992] Ch 505 the company in administration had sublet computers that were owned by a set of banks who wanted to repossess them. Nicholls LJ, in outlining the considerations for giving leave to execute repossession, held that leave should be given if it would not impede the administration's purpose, and while the banks were bound to apply for permission, discretion was exercised in their favour. The moratorium is effective for a default, but extendable, period of one year.Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, para 76 Administrators' duties Just as for directors' duties in UK company law, an administrator owes its duties to the company, and to the court. In Oldham v Kyrris it was held that creditors may not sue administrators directly in their own capacity, because the duty is owed to the company.By analogy with the UK company law cases such as Peskin v Anderson [2001] BCC 87C or Percival v Wright In this case, a former employee of a Burger King franchise with an equitable charge for ¬£270,000 for unpaid wages could not sue the administrator directly, outside the terms of the statutory standard, unless responsibility had been directly assumed to him.[2003] EWCA Civ 1506, [2004] BCC 111 =Rescue the company= While the moratorium is in effect the administrator's core purpose and duty under paragraph 3 is to rescue the company, or if impracticable, typically transfer the business as a going concern, or as a last resort break up the business and distribute proceeds to creditors.Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, para 3 This and other duties, found in Schedule B1, paragraph 3, are theoretically meant to be exercised for the benefit of the creditors as a whole. There is some tension, however, between the duties on paper, and the administrator being appointed in fact by secured creditors, or through a pre-packaged insolvency. Once in place, the first task of an administrator is to design a restructuring proposal. This should be given to the registrar and unsecured creditors within 8 weeks, followed by a creditor vote to approve the plans by simple majority. If creditors do not approve the court may make an order as it sees fit.See Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, paras 49-55 Until then, the powers of administrator extend under Schedule B1, paragraph 59 to 'anything necessary or expedient for the management of the affairs, business and property of the company'.Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, paras 60-66 whereby a list of specific powers, set out in Schedule 1, are referred to. Administrators may also replace directors, call creditor meetings, apply to court for directions, control company officers, and distribute assets to creditors in accordance with statutory priorities or to fulfil the administration's purpose. In Re Transbus International Ltd Lawrence Collins J made the point that the rules on administration were intended to be \\"a more flexible, cheaper and comparatively informal alternative to liquidation\\" and so with regard to doing what is expedient \\"the fewer applications which need to be made to the court the better.\\"[2004] EWHC 932, [9], referring to the judgment of Neuberger J in Re T&D; Industries plc [2000] BCC 956. See also Royal Trust Bank v Buchler [1989] BCLC 130. This wide discretion of the administrator to manage the company is reflected also in paragraph 3(3)-(4), whereby the administrator may choose between which result (whether saving the company, selling the business, or winding down) \\"he thinks\\" subjectively is most appropriate. This places an administrator in an analogous position to a company director.cf Companies Act 2006 s 172, as a matter of UK company law =Duty of care= An administrator's further duties allow a broad scope for the administrator to exercise good business judgment. An administrator is subject to a duty to perform her functions as 'quickly and efficiently as is reasonably practicable',Insolvency Act 1986 Schedule B1, para 4 and must also not act so as to 'unfairly harm' a creditor's interests. In Re Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2) the administrator sold the insolvent company's business at an allegedly undervalued price, which creditors alleged breached his duty to not unfairly harm them.Or \\"prejudice\\" as the statute said at the time, under the former Insolvency Act 1986 section 27 Millett J held the standard of care was not breached, and was the same standard of care as in professional negligence cases of an \\"ordinary, skilled practitioner\\". He emphasised that courts should not judge decisions which may turn out sub-optimal with the benefit of hindsight. Here the price was the best possible in the circumstances.

Along with the humble guitar, the piano accompanied the popular Cuban guarachas and contradanzas (derived from the European country dance) at salons and ballrooms in Havana and all over the country.Carpentier, Alejo. La m√∫sica en Cuba. Editorial Letras Cubanas, 1979, p. 83. 19th century Juan Federico Edelmann. As soon as in 1804, a concert program in Havana announced a vocal concert ‚Äúaccompanied at the fortepiano by a distinguished foreigner recently arrived‚ÄùCarpentier, p. 81 and in 1832, Juan Federico Edelmann (1795-1848), a renowned pianist, son of a famous Alsatian composer and pianist, arrived in Havana and gave a very successful concert at the Teatro Principal. Encouraged by the warm welcome, Edelmann decided to stay in Havana and very soon he was promoted to an important position within the Santa Cecilia Philharmonic Society. In 1836 he opened a music store and publishing company.Carpentier, p. 142. Edelmann worked also as a piano professor and had several prestigious disciples. One of the most renowned is Manuel Saumell Robredo (1818-1870). Although his activity as a pianist never transcended the limits of his country, he acquired fame as a composer for elevating the category of the Cuban contradanza, from a simple dance tune to an actual ‚Äúpi√®ce de concert,‚Äù meant to be performed in the elegant salons of the Cuban haute bourgeoisie.Carpentier, p. 149. Differently from Saumell, two other disciples of Edelmann, Pablo Desvernine (1823-1910) and Fernando Arizti (1828-1888), achieved recognition outside their country. After studying with Edelmann, Desvernine went to Paris to continue studies with Kalkenbrenner and Thalberg. He gave concerts in several European and American Cities, and also worked as a piano teacher in New York before returning to Cuba.Orovio, Helio. Cuban Music from A to Z.Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, UK, 2004, p. 67. Ferando Arizti also studied in Paris with Kalkenbrenner and played with his friend Desvernine in Spain. After his return to Cuba in 1848, he dedicated himself to teaching and had several important disciples such as: Nicol√°s Ruiz Espadero (1832-1890), his daughter Cecilia Aristi (1856-1930) and Angelina Sicouret (1880-1945).Orovio, p. 19. Ruiz Espadero also studied with Polish composer Julian Fontana, the first to compose a piece of complex format for piano that included Cuban themes, La Havanne, Fantaisie sur des motifs am√©ricains et espagnols op. 10, from 1845.Tieles, Cecilio: Panorama de la contradanza: https://www.academia.edu/28048873/Panorama_de_la_contradanza.docxTieles, Cecilio: Nicol√° Ruiz Espadero: https://www.academia.edu/s/cf77cb2ac1/categoria-nicolas-ruiz-espadero Espadero was a close friend of American pianist and composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk and was certainly a virtuoso pianist, but rarely played in public due to his introverted character. He was also a fine composer and professor.Orovio, p. 190. Fernando Arizti's daughter, Cecilia, studied with his father and with Espadero. She gave concerts in Cuba and America and was an accomplished composer and professor. Nicol√°s Ruiz Espadero was also a professor of other distinguished artists such as Carlos Alfredo Peyrellade (1840-1908) and Ignacio Cervantes Kawanagh (1847-1905). After studying with Espadero, Peyrellade went to continue his musical education in Paris, where he pursued a piano performance career. In 1865, he returned to Cuba where he opened two well known music schools in Havana and Camag√ºey.Orovio, p. 164. Ignacio Cervantes. One of the most prestigious Cuban musicians, Ignacio Cervantes studied in Paris with professors Marmontel and Alkan. He received several piano awards, was a candidate to the Rome Award and received compliments from Rossini, Liszt and Paderewski. During the Ten Years' War, Cervantes lived and gave concerts in the United States and Mexico. After the Cuban independence he worked as orchestra director at the Tac√≥n Theatre. Ignacio Cervantes is considered one of the greatest composers of his country, and his Cuban Dances for piano are an outstanding contribution to the island's cultural patrimony.Orovio, p. 49. Another successful Cuban pianist from the 19th century was Jos√© Manuel \\"Lico\\" Jim√©nez (1851-1917). He studied with Reinecke and Moscheles in Leipzig and with Marmontel in Paris. Jim√©nez gave numerous successful recitals throughout Europe and Wagner and Liszt complimented him as a pianist. Lico Jim√©nez returned to Cuba in 1879 and in 1890 he established himself in Hamburg, Germany, where he was appointed as professor at the conservatory.Orovio, p. 116. =Late 19th century= At the turn of the century, two notable pianists established themselves in Cuba and founded conservatories that contributed to the academic formation of numerous Cuban pianists and musicians. They were Hubert de Blanck (1856-1932), a Dutch pianist,Orovio, p. 28. and the Asturian professor Benjam√≠n Orb√≥n (1874-1914), father of the renowned pianist and composer Juli√°n Orb√≥n (1925-1991), a distinguished member of the ‚ÄúGrupo de Renovaci√≥n Musical.‚Äù Orovio, p. 154. Alberto Falc√≥n (1873-1961) studied piano at Conservatorio Hubert de Blanck in his early years and at a later time won a competition for the piano professorial chair at the Bordeaux Conservatory in France. He studied composition with Jules Massenet and toured through Europe and Cuba as a pianist. Upon returning to his country he opened a conservatory that bore his name, where he encouraged the practice of chamber music. He also created an orchestra for that purpose. Falc√≥n was a member of the Honor Committee at the Paris Conservatory and also a member of the National Academy of Arts and Humanities.Orovio, p. 77. Very much like Alberto Falc√≥n, Cuban pianist, composer and professor Joaqu√≠n Nin Castellanos (1879-1949) lived most of his life outside his motherland. He studied in Spain and in France at the Schola Cantorum, and lived in Germany for some years. After returning to Cuba in 1910 he moved to Brussels where he gave concerts and lectures. He worked also as a professor at the University of Brussels. Nin Castellanos returned to Havana in 1939 where he dedicated himself to teaching piano.Orovio, p. 150. Pianist and composer Ernestina Lecuona (1882-1951) began his musical studies at the Centro Asturiano Music Academy in Havana and continued studies at the Paris Conservatory. As a pianist, she gave numerous concerts in Cuba and throughout America. She taught the first music lessons to her famous brother Ernesto Lecuona and was also the grandmother of the prestigious composer and guitarist Leo Brouwer.Orovio, p. 122. 20th century=Pre-revolutionary period= Ernesto Lecuona. One of the most prestigious Cuban musicians, Ernesto Lecuona (1895‚Äì1963) began studying piano with his sister Ernestina and continued with Peyrellade, Saavedra, Nin and Hubert de Blanck. A child prodigy, Lecuona gave a concert at just five years of age at the C√≠rculo Hispano. When graduating from the National Conservatory he was awarded the First Prize and the Gold Medal of his class by unanimous decision of the board. He is by far the Cuban composer of greatest international recognition and his contributions to the Cuban piano tradition are exceptional. Margot Rojas. There were three important professors that made an outstanding effort, from the beginning to the middle of the 20th century, toward the implementation of the highest standards in the academic formation of piano performers. Three of them, C√©sar P√©rez Sentenat (1896‚Äì1973) and Margot Rojas (1903‚Äì1996) lived and worked in Havana, and the other one, Dulce Mar√≠a Serret (1898‚Äì?) in Santiago de Cuba.Orovio, pp. 163, 200, 184. C√©sar P√©rez Sentenat began to study piano in 1913 with Hubert de Blanck, Rafaela Serrano and Antonio Saavedra, and music theory with Jos√© Molina. In 1922 he travelled to Paris, where he studied with Joaqu√≠n Nin Castellanos.EcuRed: C√©sar P√©rez Sentenat: http://www.ecured.cu/C%C3%A9sar_P%C3%A9rez_Sentenat In 1922, P√©rez Sentenat was appointed as professor of piano and harmony at the National Conservatory, and in 1940 he served as associate professor at the Sherwood Music School in Chicago. Sentenat also served as professor at the Conservatorio Municipal de M√∫sica, and in 1931 he was appointed as director of that educational institution. In 1931, he founded the Escuela Normal de M√∫sica along with composer Amadeo Rold√°n, where he expanded the courses and organized a night school.Cultura Cubana: C√©sar P√©rez Sentenat: http://culturacubana.net/9-12-3-cesar-perez-sentenat/ He also participated in the foundation of the Conservatorio Internacional de M√∫sica, directed by Mar√≠a Jones de Castro, in collaboration with Caridad Ben√≠tez, where they implemented the first musical Pre-school and College in Cuba. In 1945 he was designated as Provincial Inspector of Music in Havana, and in 1948 as General Inspector. In 1961 he was appointed as professor of piano and director of the Guillermo M. Tom√°s Conservatory in Guanabacoa, and in 1965 he served as General Music Director of the National Culture Council and President of the Musical Education Reform Commission. His students included renowned musicians such as Solomon Mikowsky, Magaly Ruiz, Juan Pi√±era and Horacio Guti√©rrez. Margot Rojas was born in Veracruz, Mexico, in 1903, and established her residence in Cuba in 1912. She began studying piano at the National Conservatory, where she received several awards; and at a later time she went to New York to continue her piano training with Alexander Lambert. Rojas was a distinguished teacher in several educational institutions, including the Amadeo Rold√°n Conservatory and the National School of Arts (ENA). She also offered concerts as a soloist and accompanied by orchestras such as the National Symphony Orchestra.Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 184. Dulce Mar√≠a Serret was born in Santiago de Cuba, in 1898, and began studying music with Gustavo Rogel and Ram√≥n Figueroa. At a later time she travelled to Spain with a government grant to study piano at the Madrid Conservatory with Joseph-√âdouard Risler. After offering several successful concerts in Madrid and Paris, she returned to Cuba in 1926, where she played at the National Theater. In 1927 Serret established her residence in Santiago de Cuba, where she founded a Conservatory and taught piano to many renowned performers.Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 200. Jorge Bolet (1914‚Äì1990) studied at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia and after graduating in 1935 he served as professor at the same institution and at the Indiana University School of Music. A virtuoso pianist closely associated with the works of Franz Liszt, he was a friend of Rachmaninoff, and enjoyed a great international reputation.Orovio, p. 31. Other notable pianists that began their careers during the Cuban Pre- Revolutionary period (1900‚Äì1959) are Zenaida Manfug√°s, Emma Bad√≠a, Ester Ferrer, √ëola Sahig, Luis Gonz√°lez Rojas, Huberal Herrera, Silvio Rodr√≠guez C√°rdenas and Rosario Franco.Orovio, pp. 130, 23, 82, 193, 111, 182, 87. One of the most accomplished Cuban pianists of the 20th century, Ivette Hern√°ndez (born 1933) gave a piano recital at seven years of age at the University of Havana.

As keystone of his career, he received the justiciarship of Southern Finland which he held from 1487 to 1520. He was the first male member of his agnatic house to rise to great prominence in his country. The only surviving son of squire Henrikki Ollinpoika, lord of Joensuu, and his wife (Silja) Laavuntyt√§r of Nyyn√§inen, heiress of Kankainen manor, he was born in about 1445 or a bit earlier. In his lifetime, no surname was used of him and his family. His forefathers were squire-class noblemen in Finland already in the 14th century (confirmation in 1407 from King Eric XIII) and their family crest depicts 'Drinking Horn'. On the other side, his maternal grandfather (sir Klaus 'djekn' Lyderinpoika) had been as long as for almost two decades (1416..1434) the Castellan of Turku, the regional capital of all Western Finland, and became quite wealthy, so the maternal grandfather's children inherited good fortunes each. Klaus' mother brought the big estate of Kankainen in Masku of southwestern Finland to their own family. Klaus was named after his successful maternal grandfather. From his father Klaus inherited the Joensuu manor in Halikko, southwestern Finland. Later in life, Klaus inherited Kankainen manor from his sister. Klaus' first wife brought some rights to the manor of Haapaniemi in Kisko to the family, and apparently Klaus purchased other heirs out of that inheritance. All in all, towards the end of is life, lord Klaus was one of biggest and wealthiest landowners in Finland. Klaus' second wife inherited several farms in her home district, Vehkalahti, which belonged to the Margraviate of Viipuri (Vyborg). In 1472, squire Klaus became the district judge of Halikko, the district where his ancestral manor of Joensuu is located. In this position he was successor to his father-in-law, the justiciar 'Kristo' Frille. lord Klaus was the justiciar of Southern Finland as long as over three decades: 1487..1520. Up to 1472, also that office had been held by his father-in-law, 'Kristo' Frille. This position was the most important one in all the judiciary of Finland. From 1488 to his death, lord Klaus was High Councillor of the Realm. In the 1490s, lord Klaus of Joensuu was one of the most important leaders of negotiations about defence against the Russians. In the 16th century, the Danish became a threat, and in 1407 lord Klaus of Joensuu was mentioned as one of leaders of negotiations about defence against the Danes. In 1511, the elderly lord Klaus of Joensuu (already in his sixties) was deemed suitable yet and sent to act as commander and administrator in Viipuri, the fief (margraviate) which was at the time in the transition under the Dowager Margravine Gunilla, widow of the recently deceased castellan and margrave Eerikki Tuurenpoika. Vyborg Castle was effectively the regional capital of Eastern Finland, and more importantly, the cornerstone and key stronghold against the Russians.  Family  In 1470, young lord Klaus received a papal dispensation for his marriage with lady Kristiina Kristontyt√§r Frille, co-heiress of Teijo and Haapaniemi (b bef c1455; d bef 1508), who was daughter of a second cousin of Klaus' and of the high councillor Krister Frille, justiciar of Southern Finland. After the death of lady Kristiina, Klaus married anew, in c1511, presumably somewhere in the region of Viipuri, where he acted at the time as commander of the Viipuri castle and an administrator of the province. The new wife was the much younger lady Kirsti of Salmenkyl√§, heiress of T√∂yt√§rinhovi and of several farms in Salmenkyl√§, Sivatti, Py√∂li, Husupy√∂li, Teinpy√∂li, Reitkalli and Hietakyl√§ of Vehkalahti district, as well as of houses in at least in Hietakyl√§ local harbor and in Salmenkyl√§. Klaus' widow, lady Kirsti of Salmenkyl√§ (b bef 1495; dc1553), lived long after her first husband, was Dowager of Haapaniemi where she usually resided, and in c1531 married anew. According to research of the historian Kaarlo Blomqvist, the most likely time of the death of lord Klaus of Joensuu was the Summer 1520. At least three of his children have descendants. The son (castellan Kristo) and daughter (lady Piriitta/Kirsti) of his first marriage do, as well as does the only child of his second marriage, his youngest son, knight Henrikki Laavunpoika of Kankainen (bc 1512; d 1595). These two mentioned sons (Kristo and Henrikki) each founded one of the two main branches of the family: that of Joensuu and that of Kankainen.

Martin Luther's Death House () is the historic building in Eisleben, Germany, long regarded as the place where Martin Luther died on 18 February 1546. Since then it has become a museum and a UNESCO world heritage site. The city of Eisleben, located in Saxony-Anhalt, is also where Martin Luther was born and baptized; his birth house is also a UNESCO world heritage site and museum.  History  Luther travelled on 23 January 1546 from Halle to Eisleben on a mission to solve an inheritance dispute in the House of Mansfeld. This mediation was protracted and in the meantime Luther was tormented by cramps in his chest. Luther anticipated his death many days beforehand because he was increasingly suffering many heart attacks. By 17 February 1546 the inheritance dispute had finally been resolved and at dinner that day Luther commented he would finally lie down to sleep in his coffin and allow the worms to have a good meal. The pain in his chest continued to worsen and many medications were tried on him, but to no avail. It was claimed that in his last hours more than twenty people were with him, including his son Paul Luther. The theologian Justus Jonas documented the version of his death accepted by Luther‚Äôs followers. According to this version, Luther recited prayers, begged the Lord to take his soul and then his senses faded. On 18 February 1546, Luther died at the age of 62 years. The reason for his death is assumed to be a cardiac infarct. The question of how Martin Luther died became essential to the fate of the Protestant Reformation. The Roman Catholic church preached that the manner of death attests the life and that the devil uses the last moments of life as his last chance to tempt the individual. Immediately after Luther's death, Catholic pamphlets spread rapidly, alleging that Luther had drunk himself to death with alcohol. One of his retainers, Ambrosio Kudtfeld, attested that he had hanged himself, and some of the details he gave of Luther‚Äôs appearance were corroborated. The site of Luther's last rest became a place of worship for the faithful of the Protestant religion and they went on pilgrimages to the house until this was banned in 1707.  Restoration and reopening  In February 2013 the building was reopened, after two years of major restoration and extension of the museum costing 5.8 million euros. A new exhibition, \\"Luthers letzter Weg\\" (in English: Luther's last path), now chronicles his decease and reveals Luther's attitude to death. Now for the first time in history, it is possible for visitors to explore all chambers of the building. The new exhibition contains about 110 exhibits, including historic furniture, documents and signatures, as well as the original cloth that covered Luther's coffin. Unfortunately in 2013 it became clear that in 1726 the chronicler Eusibius Francke confused the site of the houses of Barthel Drachstedt and of his father Dr. Philipp Drachstedt. The consequence of this mistake was that in 1862 the town of Eisleben took over the ‚Äúfalse‚Äù house. In 1892 the house was almost completely rebuilt in order to reflect what was believed to be its appearance at the time of Luther‚Äôs death, even down to a reconstruction of the supposed room of his death. Accessed 24 September 2013. N.B.: The information is provided in the German language version of the page, but not in the website's English version of the page. It is now known that in fact Luther died in a house at Am Markt 56, which is currently occupied by the ‚ÄòHotel Graf Mansfeld‚Äô. This mistake is rather unfortunate as a considerable sum of money has been invested in building the Luther ‚ÄòSterbe Haus‚Äô Museum at what is now known to be the wrong site. The Hotel Graf Mansfeld in turn has no desire to become a museum or a pilgrimage site. On the other hand, Protestants are not urging it to become one, and there is not much of an ongoing dispute about the matter.  Museum  From November until March the museum is open from Tuesday to Sunday (it is closed on Monday), from 10am‚Äî5pm. From April until October the museum is open on all days of the week, from 10am‚Äî6pm .

Frisco 1630 is currently one of two operating Decapods in service in America; the other one is former Great Western 90 at the Strasburg Rail Road outside of Strasburg, Pennsylvania. History The locomotive was built in 1918 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works for use in Russia as a class Ye locomotive. However, it, along with about 200 other locomotives, remained in the United States because the Bolshevik government could not pay for them after the Russian Revolution. 1630 was converted from Russian track gauge to standard gauge. After being re-gauged, #1630 was sold to the USRA and was numbered 1147. Shortly after, 1147 was briefly leased for use on the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1920, the locomotive was sold to the St. Louis ‚Äì San Francisco Railway, where it was used as a mixed traffic engine. In 1951, the locomotive was sold to Eagle-Picher, which used it to haul lead ore from a mine to their smelter. In 1967, the locomotive was donated to the Illinois Railway Museum, in Union, Illinois where they began restoring it in 1972 and returned it to operating condition and revenue runs in 1974. Sometime after arriving at the museum, 1630 was restored from her Eagle Picher appearance to her Frisco appearance. 1630 was taken out of service in 2004, and after more than six years undergoing repairs and a federally mandated rebuild, it was returned to operational condition on October 30, 2013. On Memorial Day weekend 2014, the locomotive returned to excursion service. In 2016, the locomotive received a cylinder overhaul, which, according to Steam department curator Nigel Bennett, made the locomotive \\"probably more powerful than she has been since her [sic] first arrival at IRM in the 1970‚Äôs.\\" The locomotive, during Memorial Day weekend 2016, pulled 135 empty coal cars in storage at the museum as what was considered to be one of the longest revenue freight trains powered by a steam locomotive in at least 25 years, Bennett said. On the evening of September 14, 2019 during the Museum Showcase Weekend, 1630 doubleheaded with recently restored J. Neils Lumber Co. 5 (aka Shay 5), as this was the first time a doubleheader has been seen at the Illinois Railway Museum in a long time.

The version in the Church of England's Common Worship of 2000 is the 1988 ecumenical (ELLC) version, but amended at the Incarnatus to read: \\"was incarnate from the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and was made man.\\" The Anglican Church of Canada's Book of Alternative Services (1985) uses the 1975 ICET version, but unusually, it omits the Filioque (\\"and the Son\\") phrase in accordance with the 1978 Lambeth Conference Statement, and the Anglican-Orthodox Joint Doctrinal Commission. But in many churches of the Anglican Communion the version in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer is still the one in use: :I believe in one God the Father Almighty, :Maker of heaven and earth, :And of all things visible and invisible: :And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, :Begotten of his Father before all worlds, :God of God, Light of Light, :Very God of very God, :Begotten, not made, :Being of one substance with the Father, :By whom all things were made; :Who for us men, and for our salvation came down from heaven, :And was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, :And was made man, :And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate. :He suffered and was buried, :And the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures, :And ascended into heaven, :And sitteth on the right hand of the Father. :And he shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead: :Whose kingdom shall have no end. :And I believe in the Holy Ghost, :The Lord and giver of life, :Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son, :Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, :Who spake by the Prophets. :And I believe in one Catholick and Apostolick Church. :I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins. :And I look for the Resurrection of the dead, :And the life of the world to come. :Amen. The version above, except with moderized spelling of \\"Catholic\\" and \\"Apostolic\\", is found in the 1928 (American) Book of Common Prayer, and in the Anglo- Catholic devotional manual Saint Augustine's Prayer Book (1947 and 1967 editions). The 1979 American Book of Common Prayer, in the celebration of The Holy Eucharist: Rite One, provides for the use of either the 1975 ICET version or the traditional version, identical to that found in the 1928 Prayer Book. =Lutheran churches= The version in Evangelical Lutheran Worship (2006) of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC) is the 1988 ecumenical (ELLC) version. But the Lutheran Service Book (2006) of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS) and the Lutheran Church‚ÄìCanada (LCC) uses that of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer with slight changes, substituting the word \\"Christian\\" for \\"catholic\\" and modernizing the spelling of the word \\"apostolic\\", with changes in capitalization of this and other words, and with \\"Holy Spirit\\" in place of \\"Holy Ghost\\".The Commission on Worship of The Lutheran Church‚ÄîMissouri Synod,Lutheran Service Book, (Saint Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 2006), 158. The Missouri Synod uses the following for the Nicene Creed: :I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible. :And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only‚Äêbegotten Son of God, begotten of His Father before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made; who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate.

The band consists of lead vocalist /guitarist Michael Gossard, drummer Matt Whitaker, guitarist/vocalist Josh Bennett, and bassist/vocalist Max Myrick. History Gossard, with childhood friend Ted Dubrawski (former bassist of ACIDIC) started performing together in their high school‚Äôs rock band (Crespi Carmelite) before Michael formed the band now known as ACIDIC in his freshman year. In 2008, looking to add a drummer to their new group, they found Matt Whitaker at a rival high school (Loyola). Drummer Whitaker is a cancer survivor, having overcome leukemia when he was seven. ACIDIC's debut tour in Southern California began in October 2008, at what was then the Knitting Factory in Hollywood, followed by the first of many appearances at the Whisky a Go Go. ACIDIC was a three-piece band with Gossard, Dubrawski, and Whitaker, but they soon added a fourth member, guitarist Andy Sabatine. Their early promotional efforts soon focused beyond their local shows but also on their first full self-released CD Ironic Dreams. In 2009, the band included new member, guitarist/vocalist Michael Thompson. ACIDIC bridged 2010 and 2011 in Europe, on a New Year's tour with the Armed Forces Entertainment Network, performing at the US Army/NATO base Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo and Ramstein AFB and Spangdahlem AFB in Germany. The band also began a collaboration with producer John Ryan of Chicago Kid Productions (Styx, Santana, the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and more). ACIDIC's touring expanded into the Midwest in 2011, adding another showcase at SXSW, a second performance at the Sunset Strip Music Festival, and with routings supporting Marcy Playground, Fuel, and Alien Ant Farm. ACIDIC's \\"Strata Red\\" from the Getting Lucky CD also won the Alternative category in the 18th Billboard WorldWide Song Contest.

Standout events in 2012 included a featured performance at the Florida Music Festival, and their first-ever headlining show at Doug Weston's Troubadour in mid-summer, By year's end, guitarist/vocalist Josh Bennett, formerly of the Palmdale CA rockers Order 66, settled in as ACIDIC's fourth band member, replacing Thompson. They then started work on their next album. ACIDIC started 2014 with bassist/vocalist Max Myrick coming aboard, replacing Dubrawski.

It existed for nearly 120 years, operating such various enterprises as a boarding school for boys and a winery. It is listed on the National Register of Historical Places. History=Expansion= Two Benedictine monks were sent in 1886 from St. Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and traveled to Breckenridge, Colorado, to establish a monastic community in what was still frontier territory. They went at the invitation of Joseph Projectus Machebeuf, then still the Vicar Apostolic for Colorado and Utah. Their first foundation was the Priory of St. Mary in Boulder. Other monks followed in ensuing years. The growth of the community led the community to move to Ca√±on City in 1924, where a larger monastery was built in the Gothic Revival style. The house was raised to the status of an abbey at that time, and it assumed a new name. A boarding school was opened at the abbey, and initial attempts were made at establishing a winery, which were not pursued at the time. Like other religious communities in the United States, the abbey saw its numbers prosper during the 1950s and 1960s, only to see a steep decline begin after that. The abbey school was closed in 1985. By the early 2000s, the community was composed of about 20 monks, mostly elderly. In an effort to find a means of income for themselves, in the year 2000 the monks decided to return to the idea of planting a vineyard again. They entrusted the production to a professional viticulturist who began to produce wine the following year. =Decline= By the year 2005, however, it was determined that the monastic community was no longer viable and, in a final chapter meeting, the monks voted to dissolve it. They found homes for themselves in various other monasteries, and the abbey was closed the following year in september of 2006. = Winery at Holy Cross Abbey = The winery and tasting room opened to the public in 2002, welcoming visitors to its beautiful and serene Rocky Mountain vineyard. The Winery at Holy Cross Abbey invites visitors into its tasting room where staff guide them through a flight tasting on award-winning wine. Additional services include a VIP wine and cheese tasting during the summer months. The tasting room also sells world and locally-made goods. In the spring and summer, visitors may sit in an outdoor garden setting while viewing thriving vineyards growing against the backdrop of the Rocky Mountains. In the winter, visitors may taste wine beside a roaring fireplace.  Annual Events  The Winery at Holy Cross Abbey hosts and participates in several annual events.

Description The Bug-A-Salt device uses granular table salt as non-toxic projectiles to kill insects. The plastic gun is designed to spray up to 80 discharges of salt, which forms a conical spread pattern, similar to the blast pattern from a shotgun. Biologist Michael Dickinson of the California Institute of Technology says flies cannot dodge the tiny salt particles but they will be protected by their arthropod exoskeleton and will only be stunned. History Bug-A-Salt was created by Lorenzo Maggiore and patented in 2012. Maggiore invented the tool to kill houseflies at a distance, without creating a mess. The Skell Inc company launched its Bug-A-Salt product in 2012 on the Indiegogo platform. At the close of Skell's crowd-funding campaign on September 11, 2012, the company had sold greater than 21,400 units of the original model of the Bug-A-Salt salt gun.

The player grasps the takuapu in the middle, holds it vertically, and drops it so that it strikes the ground, producing a deep sound. The name takuapu is a compound of the Guaran√≠ words takua (‚Äòbamboo‚Äô) and pu (‚Äòsound‚Äô). A takuapu is up to two meters long and 20 to 30 centimeters in diameter. The varieties of bamboo used are taku√°ra (Guadua angustifolia) and takuarusu (Guadua trinii). All of the inner partitions of the bamboo cane are removed except for the one closest to the ground, producing a hollow tube closed at the bottom. Holes are often drilled in the side of the tube to modify the sound it produces, and sometimes a handful of pebbles are put in the tube to add a rattling sound. When a takuapu is played outdoors or on a dirt floor, a board is often placed on the ground to make the sound louder. The takuapu was originally played only by women as part of ritual ceremonies of the Guaran√≠ religion that include dances and songs. The singing in the rituals is accompanied by women playing takuaras and men playing mbarakas (maracas). Similar instruments are found elsewhere in South America, usually without the restriction of being played only by women. In Trinidad and Tobago, it is customarily men who play the tamboo bamboo while marching. The band Alba Llaleq from the Formosa Province of Argentina (part of the traditional Guaran√≠ region) include the takuara in their performances. The takuara is a type of idiophone and can be classified in category 1.11.231 (individual percussion tubes) in the Hornbostel‚ÄìSachs classification of musical instruments.

Beasley had reconciled with Helen after they had been separated for 18 years, and the remarriage took place three years later. After Beasley's death, an \\"ugly dispute ... erupted\\" among Beasley's five children on the division of his $55 million estate, with competing claims from his two daughters by his first marriage versus his two daughters from his second marriage in a battle over the handling of his $55 million estate. The sisters from Beasley's first marriage accused Beasley's son James Beasley Jr. of mismanaging the estate.

He is a former student of Raymond Leppard, Herbert Howells and Malcolm Arnold. The bulk of his composition is choral. Career Fleming served as a chorister at Salisbury Cathedral and later studied Music at the University of Cambridge. He was appointed Director of Music at Abingdon School from 1968 until 1974. He started composing his most significant works in the 1980s. His works include Four Partitas for string orchestra, Nocturnes for chamber choir and piano quintet, Serenade for strings, Magnificat for soprano, chorus, and chamber orchestra, and Cantate Domino for double choir, organ and orchestra. In 2000, he was commissioned by the Exeter Chamber Choir to set words by Hilaire Belloc and Heinrich Hoffmann for chorus, piano and orchestra. Matilda, drawn from one of the Cautionary Tales for Children by Belloc, was described by the composer as \\"mixing in the somewhat acidic taste of Hoffmann with the misadventures of 'Matilda' and 'Henry' while allowing the exemplary C A Fortescue to have the final say.\\" A selection of his choral works was recorded on CD (Meridian CDE 84360) by the Oxford Pro Musica Singers and the Saint Cecilia Players. Reviewing it for the BBC Music Magazine website, Terry Barfoot wrote that le Fleming \\"composes for choral forces with assurance and considerable subtlety\\" and noted the evident influence of le Fleming's teacher Herbert Howells in the \\"assured handling of the vocal balances\\" and \\"eloquent string writing,\\" while also expressing reservations, e.g. that his \\"development technique often relies on predictable imitations and harmonies.\\" Besides performances in the United Kingdom, le Fleming's music has received some international attention. Nocturnes, Nunc dimittis, and the Magnificat are among le Fleming's works that have been performed in concert by the Canticum Novum chamber chorus and orchestra of Santa Fe, New Mexico, whose director Kenneth Knight writes that le Fleming \\"has become one of the ensemble's favorite composers.\\" Anthony le Fleming is currently the Director of Music at St Mary's Church Hadlow, Kent.

He carried messages across Long Island Sound between Major Tallmadge and the ring's main spies on Long Island, New York, and in New York City. He also made direct reports to Washington concerning naval activities in the New York City area. Personal life Brewster was born in Setauket, New York, a hamlet of Brookhaven, and was a descendant of Mayflower passenger William Brewster. After the Revolutionary War, he was a blacksmith, an officer in the United States Revenue Cutter Service for 20 years, and a farmer. Culper Ring Major Benjamin Tallmadge convinced General George Washington on August 25, 1778, that Abraham Woodhull of Setauket, Long Island, would make a good agent to gather intelligence in New York City, the British Army's headquarters and base of operations during the American Revolutionary War. Brewster served as a courier in what became the Culper spy ring, carrying messages between Woodhull and Tallmadge, and he ran regular trips in whaleboats across the Sound on a variety of smuggling and military missions. Woodhull and Robert Townsend were the main agents in the Ring, alias \\"Samuel Culper, Sr.\\" and \\"Samuel Culper, Jr.\\" respectively. Brewster also participated in military actions as a Continental Army officer serving under Tallmadge. Anna Strong's role in the Ring was to signal Brewster that a message was ready, according to widely accepted local and family tradition. She did this by hanging a black petticoat on her clothesline at Strong Point in Setauket, which Brewster could see from a boat in the Sound and Woodhull could see from his nearby farm. She would add a number of handkerchiefs for one of six coves where Brewster would bring his boat and Woodhull would meet him.Hunter, 2013, p. 42. In February 1778, Brewster sent a message of his own through the Culper channel which concerned flat-bottomed boats being built in New York which could be used to ferry troops, and Loyalist privateers being outfitted. On another trip, he was waiting for Woodhull in Anna Strong's back garden when he surprised a passing British lieutenant. Brewster pulled him off his horse and had the opportunity to capture or kill him, but he refrained from doing either in order to avoid drawing suspicion on Anna as a member of the Ring, and instead pretended that he and his men were thieves. After the war Brewster married Anne Lewis of Fairfield, Connecticut, after the war and moved to Fairfield with her, where he set up a blacksmith business. The couple had eight surviving children. In 1793, he joined the United States Revenue Cutter Service, predecessor of the United States Coast Guard. He took three years off from the service because he disagreed with policies of President John Adams, and he commanded the revenue cutter USRC Active (1812) from 1812 to 1816. He retired to his farm in Black Rock, Connecticut. Brewster died February 13, 1827, aged 79, and is buried in Fairfield Cemetery.

(;In isolation, van is pronounced . usually translated in the literature as \\"High Court of Holland and Zeeland,\\" though \\"Supreme Court\\" may better designate its function, and the literal translation is: \\"High Council of Holland and Zeeland\\") was the supreme court of the provinces of Holland and Zeeland in the Dutch Republic in the period 1582-1795. This court is considered a direct predecessor of the current Hoge Raad der Nederlanden (Supreme Court of the Netherlands). It played an important role in the formation of Roman-Dutch law, which still influences law in Southern Africa, through its jurisprudence. History The Great Council of Mechelen was the final Court of Appeal in the Habsburg Netherlands for all provincial High Courts. When, however, the rebellious provinces of Holland and Zeeland became physically separated from this court due to the difficulties for travellers during the military campaigns of the early Eighty Years' War after 1572, the practical lack of a possibility of appeal from sentences of the Hof van Holland (the provincial High Court for both provinces since 1428) was felt as a serious problem. This could only be solved after the Act of Abjuration of 1581 had formalised the deposition of the overlord of the Netherlands, Philip II of Spain. The States-General of the Netherlands decided to replace the Great Council in the provinces of the Union of Utrecht with its own \\"supra- provincial' court in 1582. But only the States of Holland accepted for the time being such a supreme court, which meant that its jurisdiction remained limited to that province. Only in 1587 did the States of Zeeland accede to the Supreme Court. No other provinces joined them. The court was dissolved together with the other institutions of the Dutch Republic after the Batavian Republic overthrew the old Republic in 1795. The Instruction of 1582 The Instructie that the States-General drew up, promulgated on 31 May 1582 by William the Silent, to regulate the Supreme Court was in large part based on the Ordonnance of 1559 that governed the Great Council. This text, comprising 289 articles, would essentially remain in force during the entire history of the Court. The first 50 articles describe the jurisdiction and competence, composition and internal procedures of the court. Then follow the articles governing the work of the procureur-generaal (sollicitor-general) and advocaat-fiscaal (attorney-general) (art. LI-LXIII). Next follow articles regarding the griffier (Clerk of court) and secretaries (art. LXIV-XCIII). Then follow rules governing the competence and procedure of the court (XCIV- CIV), directly followed by rules about the way the bailiffs would execute the decrees of the court (CV-CXX). Then follow rules about the division of work between procureurs (sollicitors) and advocaten (attorneys, barristers), and the tariff for their services (CXXI-CLXVI), followed by rules about the procedures during trials (CLXVII-CXC). And finally details about the different legal remedies to be sought before the court were given (CXCI-CLXXXXIX). Jurisdiction and competence The organisation of the Judiciary that the Dutch Republic inherited from the Habsburg Netherlands was a patchwork of city and feudal courts on a local level, applying local law, like Schepenbanken, Baljuw's courts, and Heerlijkheid's courts that acted as courts of first instance in both criminal and civil cases. In general, appeal from criminal verdicts was not possible, so that the Apellate courts only took appeals of civil cases. The provincial High Court (the Hof van Holland) took these appeals, but also acted as court of first instance in a number of cases. The Supreme Court of Holland and Zeeland provided a possibility of (higher) appeal from cases decided in the provincial high court and the courts of the Hoogheemraadschappen (which handled certain land-use cases). It also had original jurisdiction in certain cases, e.g. commercial cases involving foreign merchants (and foreign law). Cases of Reversal (i.e. in which a final verdict was reviewed and possibly overturned) were reserved for the States- General which as Hoge Overheid or sovereign power in the Republic was the ultimate fount of justice (the States-General exceptionally also took politically sensitive cases, like the trial of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius in 1618 and the trial of the Amboyna judges). In appeals cases the Supreme Court generally had three remedies available: direct appeal from a decree of a lower court (comparable to a writ of Certiorari), and judicial review of an entire case (comparable to a petition for a writ of Mandamus), both in cases decided by the judiciary, and by an arbiter. In cases of original jurisdiction (which were ipso facto also cases of final jurisdiction) the court had all the usual legal remedies avalilable. The court had also single jurisdiction over petitions for rechterlijke middelen van herstel en gunst, a number of legal remedies that had been executed by the Hoge Overheid (Sovereign) under his powers of Grace and Pardon but now fell to the courts. An example are acts of cession by debtors. In these cases the Supreme Court usually committed the case to a lower court for disposal. Finally, the Supreme Court acted in cases of voluntary adjudication of Public instruments (in Dutch: Authentieke akten). Composition The Supreme Court in 1582 had nine raadsheren (councillors, justices) and a president-raadsheer (president- councillor) all from Holland. When Zeeland joined the court in 1587 that province got 2 of the 9 councillors. In 1596 the number of councillors was increased to 10 and Zeeland got 3 councillors. This remained the composition of the court till 1795. The griffier and his deputy were the main administrative support of the court. The court further had two \\"first bailiffs\\" or deurwaarders to maintain order in the court and to execute its writs within the city of The Hague. The ontvanger der exploiten (receiver of fees) collected the fees and fines and made payments for the court. These were the offices in the court that were filled by the Stadtholder (for life, in the case of the councillors) on the nomination of the States of the two provinces. (During the First Stadtholderless Period and the Second Stadtholderless Period, when the office of stadtholder was left vacant, the provincial States filled vacancies.) The court further had a modest administrative staff that in case of need was augmented with servants of the Hof van Holland, which also resided in The Hague, next door in the Binnenhof. Two councillors held the weekly audience in which petitioners and lawyers presented documents for the cases the court heard. Generally one councillor was charged by the president to hear the case as a judge-commissioner in evidentiary hearings, called the enqueste, while another councillor (rapporteur) reported the case to the full court for its deliberations (a quorum of seven councillors was required for a valid deliberation). Individual councillors informally acted as mediators between parties to promote settlements (which could be reached at any stage of a case before the final verdict). The procureurs and advocaten were officers of the court, but acted for individual clients. They also appeared before the Hof van Holland. The procureur-generaal and the advocaat-fiscaal were officials appointed by the stadtholder to advise the court (and sometimes to take part in the deliberations of the court if otherwise a quorum could not be reached due to illness of a councillor), but mainly to represent the state in cases before the court. =Presidents= *Treslong, Johan van (18-01-1582 - 05-06-1583) *Nicolai, Aarnout (22-10-1583 - 22-01-1592) *Egmond van de Nijenburg, Dirk van (11-05-1592 - 07-01-1597) *Banchem, Johan van (01-02-1599 - 29-11-1601) *Brederode, Reinoud van (18-03-1602 - 07-01-1633) *Haga, Cornelis (17-06-1645 - 12-08-1654) *Pauw, Reynier (14-05-1655 - 20-01-1676) *Fagel, Fran√ßois (24-05-1677 - 12-11-1680) *Druyff, Hendrik (02-04-1681 - 18-11-1690) *Rooseboom, Hubertus (03-03-1691 - 04-10-1722) *Admiraal, Simon (23-03-1723 - 02-03-1724) *Bijnkershoek, Cornelis van (26-05-1724 - 16-04-1743) *Hees, Hendrik van (20-06-1743 - 04-08-1754) *Grande, Adriaan de (14-11-1754 - 09-08-1763) *Mollerus, Hendrik (29-10-1763 - 08-12-1783) *Pauw, Willem (19-03-1784 - 24-06-1787) *Mauregnault, Johan Boreel de (02-11-1787 - 1795) =Councillors= *Amstel van Mijnden tot Cronenburgh, Amelis van (1582 - 1592) *Oem van Wijngaerden, Gerard (18-01-1582 - 1591) *Foreest, Nanning van (18-01-1582 - 1592) *Hogendorp, Gijsbert van (18-01-1582 - 01-1584) *Egmond van de Nijenburg, Dirk van (18-01-1582 - 10-05-1592) *Loosen, Sebastiaan van (18-01-1582 - 24-04-1597) *Banchem, Johan van (18-01-1582 - 30-01-1599) *Mortagne, Geraart van (18-01-1582 - 03-1583) *Beets, Johan (09-06-1582 - 07-1583) *Wensen, Adriaan (24-10-1583 - 1587) *Nieuwstad, Cornelis Mathiasz. van der (23-02-1584 - 25-06-1606) *Valcke, Jacob (05-1589 - ) *Hermansz., Frederik (06-07-1589 - 11-1593) *Leyden van Leeuwen, Dirc Adriaensz. van (30-09-1591 - 21-04-1596) *Does, Johan van der (30-09-1591 - 08-10-1604) *Vranck, Franchois (11-05-1592 - 11-10-1617) *Bouchorst, Amelis van den (24-06-1593 - 1602) *Voogt, Leonart (04-01-1594 - 09-06-1613) *Hoogerbeets, Rombout (21-05-1596 - 22-12-1617) *Hermansz., Frederik (15-01-1597 - ) *Hinojossa, Pieter de (15-01-1597 - 16-05-1607) *Brederode, Reinoud van (16-05-1597 - 17-03-1602) *Santen, Johan van (17-11-1603 - 26-10-1609) *Honert, Rochus van den (17-11-1603 - 30-01-1638) *Veen, Simon van (20-03-1607 - 26-10-1610) *Vosbergen, Caspar van (09-10-1608 - 13-03-1626) *Scotte, Apollonius (09-10-1608 - 01-11-1639) *Veer, Albert de (26-05-1611 - 08-02-1620) *Asperen, Paulus van (02-01-1613 - 13-05-1641) *Ruychaver, Nicolaas (28-01-1614 - 14-07-1620) *Duyck, Anthony (04-10-1619 - 09-02-1621) *Fagel, Fran√ßois (06-10-1619 - 02-03-1644) *Pauw, Reynier (26-01-1621 - 13-05-1655) *Coren, Jacob Gerritsz.

He started at RBS TV in Rio Grande do Sul and has not stopped since. He worked in Santa Catarina, Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo before becoming an International Correspondent in 2000. Between 2004 and 2007, he covered Middle East events. Indeed, he recorded several stories about the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict from his base of Jerusalem. He returned to Europe to coordinate the Office of Rede Globo in London, where he lived with his wife, Ana L√©lia and their children Arthur, Helena and Mariana. Now they live in the capital of Brazil, Bras√≠lia. \\"My vocation, I believe, is Journalism. Where I practice journalism is just a geographical detail‚Äù (Marcos Losekann) Early life and career Marcos Losekann was born in Independ√™ncia, a small town in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. He is the only child of Elaine Ciechowics Losekann and Ary Losekann, a truck driver. Losekann was a law student when, as he said, ‚ÄúThe journalism chose him‚Äù. One night, he was invited by friends to go to a pizzeria, \\"I had already eaten dinner, there was no reason to be there, and I had no money to pay for the pizza. But I went. And right at the entrance, one person became ill, had a seizure and collapsed. This person was called Flavio Damiani. He was the chief reporter of local TV. \\" Damiani TV was an affiliate of TV Globo, RBS Cruz Alta. Losekann began making visits to his new friend and became accustomed to the editorial room routine. Eventually, he ended up being hired and turned out to be a reporter. Within a few months, he scored his first field on Globo in 1984. He also worked in television on Pelotas and Caxias do Sul, and in radio on Gaucha de Porto Alegre (RBS radio). Than, he moved to Santa Catarina, where he continued as a reporter at RBS TV Florian√≥polis. At age 22, Marcos Losekann became one of the youngest reporters of TV Globo: he was responsible for reporting Santa Catarina state news to National TV. Thanks to this position, Marcos Losekann spawned more than 200 reports of national newscasts between 1988 and 1990. In 1990, TV Globo itself invited him to join its team of special reporters, this time in Brasilia, where Losekann would remain until 1992. His next destination was the Amaz√¥nia. Living in Manaus, Mark Losekann became Globo‚Äôs correspondent in the entire Amazon, covering Acre, Rondonia, Amazonas, Amap√°, Roraima, Tocantins and Par√° as well. He also covered the countries surrounding the Brazilian Amazon. He made his first war coverage in 1994 during the confrontation between Ecuador and Peru. His talents of investigator were noticed as well, having been responsible for the dissemination of numerous cases of corruption, administrative impropriety and local governments in the Amazon area. In addition, he revealed drug trafficking routes in the Amazon, and denounced countless environmental crimes. In 1995, he was invited to work in TV Globo in Rio de Janeiro. After only five months, Losekann was incorporated into the TV Globo S√£o Paulo team, where he remained until the beginning of 2000. War correspondent Between January and July 2000, Marcos worked again in TV Globo in Rio de Janeiro, only to be transferred in August 2000 to London‚Äôs Journalism Globe. In 2004, Marcos was again transferred, this time to Jerusalem, where he became the first Brazilian television correspondent in the Middle East. He covered the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, with reports in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The consecration occurred in July 2006, when the war between Israel and Lebanon, more precisely against the militant Lebanese group Hezbollah fundamentalists, burst. During this 33-day war, Losekann covered directly from the Israeli front, where he luckily avoided being shot by missiles fired by Hezbollah militants. In order to provide maximum transparency, balance and impartiality, the correspondent passed the strict Israeli security and crossed the border to show to the Lebanese side the result of the offensive in cities, towns and villages at the border (southern Lebanon). In Beirut, another reporter, Safatli Munir, was in charge of sharing the consequences of the bloody war in the Lebanese capital. Losekann and Safatli then became the first journalists of TV Globo to cover an entire war directly from the front, without interruption in coverage. Thanks to the work of both trenches, the history of this war could be told in a balanced and unbiased way ‚Äì as the high audience ratings of TV Globo's news programs attested during that period. Arrested by Hezbollah On August 15, 2008, Markos Losekan, his producer and a camera man were doing a story on Dahiye local restaurant inspired in militaries forces when two militants from Hezbollah showed up in a car and ordered them to stop filming. They instantly arrested them. The crew was driven in a van with colored windows. They were separated and each one of them interrogated. They stayed for more than five hours in different rooms when the captors left them on a road on the outskirts of Beirut, without their equipment and belongings. Footage taken by Pimentel and posted on Globo showed the journalists being rushed into a car by Hezbollah militants. Writer Marcos Losekann is also a writer. His first book, O Ronco da Pororoca, is inspired by the stories he gathered as a reporter in the Amazon. It was published by Editora Senac in 1999. The Entrevista com Deus trilogy marks his debut as a novelist. The Editora Planeta has published O Dossi√™ Iscariotes (2006), Segredo do Sal√£o Verde (2007) and Entre a Cruz e a Su√°stica (2009). It is fiction, but with traces of reality. The writer-reporter is currently preparing to write about his experience in the Middle East, focusing on Gaza. The book, which is already under preparation and research.

As a land bank, the Cuyahoga Land Bank acquires financially distressed properties, including those which have been foreclosed due to unpaid tax liens or mortgages, rehabilitates or (in most cases) demolishes the structures on the property, and then either sells the properties, or holds them off the market, with the goal of reducing the glut of undervalued properties (and stabilizing surrounding property values) until economic conditions improve.Brian Louis, \\"Rust Belt Cities Demolish Homes as Defaults Blight Neighborhoods\\", Bloomberg News, November 17, 2010.Lindsey Rupp, \\"BofA Donates Then Demolishes Houses to Cut Foreclosures\\", Bloomberg News, July 27, 2011.Brian Bull, \\"Ohio Tears Through Blighted Housing Problem\\", NPR, April 5, 2012.

He was a prominent advocate for alternatives to incarceration for offenders as well as for the de-institutionalization of individuals with developmental disabilities. His career involved university teaching, administration of juvenile justice services for three states, clinical work with offenders and advocacy for systemic change in public sector correctional services. Miller's work first drew national attention for his leadership in closing several juvenile reformatories in Massachusetts in the early 1970s. Miller went on to emerge as a prominent national advocate, administrator and educator working for systemic change in public sector corrections and disability service delivery systems. He was the co-founder of the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives. Early years Jerome Gilbert Miller was born on December 8, 1931 and grew up in Wahpeton, North Dakota. His parents were George Miller, a high school music teacher, and the former Beatrice Butts. He earned academic degrees from Maryknoll Seminary, Glen Ellyn, Il (B.A., 1954), Loyola University Chicago (M.S.W., 1957) and The Catholic University of America (D.S.W., 1965). After his undergraduate studies, he spent a year in a Maryknoll novitiate in Bedford, Massachusetts.JGM biographical notes sparkaction. com, Retrieved 24 January 2013. Miller's doctoral studies concentrated in psychiatric social work, and he was qualified as a licensed clinical social worker. Career Miller was an Associate Professor in the School of Social Work at Ohio State University, when in 1969 he was chosen by Massachusetts Governor Francis Sargent to serve as the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Youth Services (DYS). =Massachusetts experiment= Within three years of leading DYS, Miller had shut down the state's two juvenile reformatories in favor of community based alternatives to incarceration. The first closure involving Lyman School for Boys in 1971, caught many juvenile justice professionals in the state by surprise. Lyman School was the first reformatory for delinquent adolescent boys to be established in the United States. Anticipating the possible closure of the Massachusetts Industrial School for Boys at Shirley, various forces tried to mobilize against it, but Miller was successful in closing the school in 1972. Highly controversial at the time, and still debated today, the basic deinstitutionalization reforms implemented by Miller in the state's juvenile justice services forty years ago are still in place today.\\"Reforming Juvenile Justice‚Äù August 14, 2005, The American Prospect, Retrieved 24 January 2013. =Alternatives to incarceration= Recognized as a successful reformer capable of taking on entrenched state-level systems overly reliant on institutionalizing children and adolescents, Miller moved to Illinois in 1973 to serve as the Director of Children and Family Services and then to Pennsylvania in 1975 to serve as the Commissioner of Children and Youth. From 1989 to 1994 Miller was the jail and prison monitor for Judge Howell W. Melton in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. From 1995 to 1997 Miller served as the court appointed receiver for Washington D.C.'s child welfare system. As a leader and reformer in these jurisdictions, he sought to address and overcome the traumatizing consequences of incarceration, to maximize the use of community resources as alternatives to imprisonment, to lower the disproportionate rates of locking up youth of color, to reduce recidivism by improving offender outcomes and to reduce unsustainable costs associated with escalating levels of incarceration. =National Center for Institutions and Alternatives= In 1977, together with Herbert J. Hoelter, Miller co-founded the National Center for Institutions and Alternatives (NCIA). The focus of NCIA involves sentencing advocacy, parole release advocacy and developing credible alternatives to incarceration and institutionalization. Miller has written and lectured widely on juvenile and adult corrections and strategies for promoting and implementing systemic reforms that utilize community-based alternatives to replace counterproductive and financially unsustainable institutionalization of offenders and developmentally disabled patients. Miller also served as the founder and clinical director of NCIA's Augustus Institute for Mental Health, named for John Augustus, known as the 'father of probation' for his pioneering efforts to promote offender rehabilitation in the United States. Miller died on August 7, 2015 in Woodstock, Virginia.New York Times Jerome G Miller who reshaped juvenile justice dies at 83 Impact Jerome Miller's dramatic closure of two juvenile reformatories in Massachusetts in the early 1970s launched a forty- year career as a pioneering administrator, educator and advocate for alternative models for responding to offenders and developmentally disabled persons. Miller's capacity to articulate the need for reform, to envision models for systems transformation and ability to implement institutional change have been widely acknowledged, sometimes condemned and often praised.\\"Let His Children Go\\" David C.

The club's members are current and former members of the United States Armed Forces. Membership in Gladiators is limited to men who have served in the United States Armed Forces and ride \\"cruiser\\" style motorcycles. Unlike some other Military-based clubs, Gladiators acceptance is not based on discharge status or race. History Gladiators MC was founded by former members of Untamed Spirit MC and was established in August 2009 near Columbus, Ohio. Unlike Gladiators MC, Untamed Spirit MC accepted female members to be fully patched, in addition to holding officer positions. While this position was accepted by the dominant 1% club in the area, other organizations were not as accepting. As problems increased, Untamed Spirit MC memberships declined and the club eventually dissolved. In order to distance itself from the problems experienced with Untamed Spirit MC, the newly formed Gladiators MC established a presence, without the wearing of patches. In 2013, approval was requested by the dominant clubs of the area to enter inside the city of Columbus. After several months of failed attempts to reach an agreement, the Gladiators have remained outside of the city limits as a show of respect to the established clubs. Clubs with similar names A number of motorcycle clubs are called Gladiators, e.g. Norway.:no:Gladiators MC and Australia. These are not part of GMC USA and share only the name, having a different patch design and colors. On August 2, 2013, the Gladiators MC (USA) met with Gladiators Norway in the town of Bod√∏ after receiving an invitation by the Norwegian Gladiators to attend a party in Oslo, Norway. This was the first meeting of the two organizations. During their stay in Bod√∏, the Avisa Nordland newspaper printed an article in their August 6, 2013 edition (Nr. 178) in regards to the visit between the two organizations. On August 9, 2013, both clubs united with Gladiators Germany, just outside the city of Oslo. Not only was this the first time Gladiators MC meet the German Gladiators, but this was also the first time all three clubs would be together.

It was first broadcast on ITV on Wednesday, 26 October 1994 and was watched by 14,450,000 viewers during its original broadcast.  Plot = Act 1: At School = Attending the opening day of a new school, Mr. Bean is unable to find a parking space but spots a Mini looking near-identical to his own (albeit with missing wing mirrors) in a reserved parking space, finds it unlocked and replaces the one in the parking space with his own. Two Army Cadets then find him pushing his Mini (actually the one moved from the parking space) and help him. While they push the Mini, Bean slowly closes the door and runs behind a wall and makes a humorous sound as if he were inside. He then confuses a troop of Army Cadets, while the commander has gone into an office, by coughing, which causes them to respond by stomping once simultaneously, and then giving military-like commands which cause them to respond by standing in unusual ceremonial stances and heads inside the school while the angry commander scolds his troop of Army Cadets upon his return. Bean then gets in another man's way, messes up a philatelist's stamp collection and frightens a calligrapher, causing him to make a mistake. Later, he sees a woman using a Van de Graaff generator to make her hair stand on end, and then tries it himself but finds it doesn't work on him. However, it leaves his body electrostatically charged, such that when he then picks up a leaflet to read it, it remains stuck to him. After multiple failed attempts to get rid of the leaflet he hands it to a woman, but the static electricity causes her skirt to rise up to cover her head and reveal her legs and white knickers. Bean promptly leaves while other people try to pull down her skirt. = Act 2: Laboratory Trouble and the Art Class = In the chemistry lab, Bean experiments with several chemicals and makes a creative but very unstable chemical reaction, forcing Bean to escape from the laboratory as a young boy (Sam Driscoll) enters and inspects the experiment. As Bean walks out of the laboratory, a violent explosion erupts, with blue smoke emerging from beneath the door. In a still-life art class, Bean is first made to draw a bowl of fruit. A moment later, the bowl of fruit is replaced with a nude model (Cindy Milo); he does not notice this immediately, but then suddenly realises he has drawn the woman's breasts and not a piece of fruit; like he initially thought he was doing. Bean is so appalled at realising what he was drawing was a naked woman, he is reluctant to draw any further despite the French art teacher's (Suzanne Bertish) attempts to persuade him. While the teacher is tending to somebody else, Bean goes over to the potter's wheel and makes some clay pots; when he is doing it, the boy from the chemistry lab, now covered in blue chemical powder, and his teacher arrive inside the room to seek the person responsible for causing the explosion. Failing to find him, and having just noticed the nude model, they rush out of the classroom. After Bean finishes making clay pots, he puts them on the model's breasts, allowing him to draw her without embarrassment. The teacher confronts Bean for drawing the wrong object again, suddenly realising that the grimaced woman's chest is covered in a clay bra. After that, Bean finishes his work and walks proudly out of the class, while the teacher looks at Bean's work and turns out to be impressed with it. = Act 3: The Judo Class and the Toilet = At a judo class, a frightened Bean is reluctant to allow himself to be thrown, but ultimately manages to confuse his teacher by running behind him during the bowing process, push him over from behind, and roll him up in a mat. After the class, when Bean has just changed back into his regular clothes, he finds that he has swapped trousers with someone else and goes on a long search for his own. In the men's toilets, he spots them, cleverly seeing his name on the label while the man is sitting on the toilet. Bean distracts the man, frantically grabs him by the legs and tries to grab his trousers. While this is happening, a guard enters the toilet and Bean fools him by cleaning the man's shoes and the guard immediately leaves the toilet. Bean continues and finally retrieves his trousers, as well as the man's underwear, which he throws back to the man‚Äîthough his underpants end up falling into the toilet. = Act 4: The Unexpected Disaster = Just as Bean exits the school, there is an announcement over the PA system stating that there will be a demonstration shortly (the man giving the announcement is voiced by Rowan Atkinson). Bean walks over to where he parked his Mini at the beginning of the day, but soon realises it is no longer where he parked it. After looking, he sees his Mini in the middle of the car park, with a lot of people watching it from behind. Not bothered by this, Bean makes a beeline for his Mini, but on the way, he is distracted by a woman's cake stall set up nearby. He walks over to the stall and buys a delicious cupcake, unaware that a giant Chieftain tank has just appeared in the car park and that the crushing sound he hears is his Mini being crushed. After the tank leaves, Bean turns around, does a double take, drops his cupcake on the road and slowly walks over to his Mini with a sad look on his face. As the ending credits roll, Bean examines the destroyed Mini and finds that the padlock he uses to lock his Mini was left intact and unharmed. Seemingly satisfied with this, he pulls the lock off and happily leaves. = Continuity = During The Best Bits of Mr. Bean, Bean finds the wreckage of his destroyed Mini in his loft. Although the Mini has been crushed it reappears two episodes later in \\"Goodnight, Mr Bean\\". This Mini was also Austin Citron Green with a matte black bonnet also with the registration number SLW 287R It is possible that this Mini was the one (registration ACW 497V) that was supposed to have been crushed in the episode and that Bean took it in as his own after his was destroyed by the tank.

On Boomerang Australia, the scene where he searches for his trousers was cut out.  Production  There were three cars crushed during filming. Two cars were specifically built for filming this episode and were painted with the same colour scheme as the main car; but with the engines removed. One of these two Minis was also used for the part where Mr. Bean substitutes his car with the identical car (registration ACW 497V). One of the three main cars with the engine removed was also crushed by the tank.http://www.theminiforum.co.uk/forums/topic/336384-mr-beans-mini/ The art class scene in Act 3 inspires an episode of Mr. Bean: The Animated Series titled \\"Artful Bean\\" while one part of Act 1 where Mr. Bean tried to use the Van de Graaff generator is reused in the episode \\"Gadget Kid\\". The Mini identical to Mr. Bean's possibly inspired the episode \\"Double Trouble\\". The chemistry scene in Act 2 possibly inspires the episode \\"Back to School\\" of Mr. Bean: The Animated Series. The scene where the Army Tank crushes Bean's Mini is also similar to the scene in the episode \\"Car Wars\\" of Mr. Bean: The Animated Series where the machine in Dickle Dickie's Garage had Bean's Mini turned into a box.

Muhak was his Buddhist name (meaning \\"the uneducated\\"), while his real name was Jacho (ÏûêÏ¥à). It is thought that Muhak's reputation as a geomancer influenced Yi's decision to move the capital from Gaeseong to Hanyang (present-day Seoul). According to a historical account dating from 14th century,Yoon 2008 Yi Seong-gye asked Muhak to find a site for the new capital. After searching for a suitable place, the monk stopped and saw an old farmer passing by on his ox. The farmer pointed toward the northwest and said to him, wangsimni (ÂæÄÂçÅÈáå), literally meaning 'go ten more ri.' The startled Muhak went to the northwest as he was told and ended up at the southern foot of Mt. Bugak, where Gyeongbokgung now stands.

It was located northwest of Amanty, in the Meuse department in the Lorraine region in northeastern France (48.527383,5.598371). History The airfield was set up early 1917, with French escadrille C 4 (observation for 2nd Army Corps/French Second Army) arriving on 6 March, and staying until 2 April. The field then fell asleep until escadrille C 43 showed up on 19 Oct, teamed with the 1st Aero Squadron. Later on 14 December, they were joined by the ground personnel of 91st Aero Squadron (their pilots still training in Issoudun ‚Äì they would arrive in March 1918). The I Corps Observation Group School was organized early January 1918 on the field, the ground troops of 91st Squadron certainly used for construction works; the airfield was officially transferred to the Air Service, United States Army on February. As with most temporary airfields during World War I, it was set up quickly on existing farmer's fields which was used as an all-way airfield for aircraft takeoffs and landings. Canvas and metal tubing type hangars were erected for aircraft maintenance, and wooden buildings were set up for barracks, operations, maintenance and other station needs. 477th Aero Squadron (Construct.) stayed 12 Jun - 1 August 1918 to improve the camouflage of the installations. The I Corps Observation Group School trained pilots and observers for aerial observation and photography. 1st Aero Squadron left on 4 April, and 91st Aero Squadron on 24 May.

After the Armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918, the First Army Air Service remained in place until it was ordered demobilized in April 1919. Afterwards Amanty Airdrome was dismantled, and the airfield was returned to the local farmers for agricultural use. Today little or no traces of it remain.

In support of the flying squadrons, the 3d Air Park had a flight of mechanics for repair of both aircraft and vehicles. Also, the airfield was the home of Photo Sections #2 and #10 for processing and analyzing aerial photography. The ground support station consisted of various aircraft hangars, support buildings and quarters for personnel. After the armistice in November 1918, Vavincourt remained active as 1st Army Observation Group HQ stayed here until it was disbanded on 15 April 1919. It this time, the 24th Aero Squadron alone was still present. Once empty, the airfield was turned over to the 1st Air Depot for de- construction: all hangars and other structures were dismantled and all useful supplies and equipment were removed and sent back to the Depot for storage. Upon completion, the land turned over to the French government.Series 1, Paris Headquarters and Supply Section, Volume 30 History of the 1st Air Depot at Colombey-led-Belles, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917‚Äì1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C.

The phenomenon's name derives from the name of the woman who mentioned the phenomenon in a magazine article in 1985. According to Japanese social psychologist Shozo Shibuya, the specific causes that trigger a defecation urge in bookstores are not yet clearly understood (as of 2014). There are also some who are skeptical about whether such a peculiar phenomenon really exists at all, and it is sometimes discussed as one type of urban myth. The series of processes through which being in a bookstore leads to an awareness of a defecation urge is something that cannot be explained from a medical perspective as a single pathological concept, at least at present. According to a number of discussions on the topic, even if it can be sufficiently found that this phenomenon actually exists, it is a concept that would be difficult to be deemed a specific pathological entity (such as a \\"Mariko Aoki disease\\", for example). On the other hand, it is also a fact that a considerable number of the intellectuals (particularly clinicians) who discuss this phenomenon have adopted existing medical terminology such as from diagnostics and pathology. Borrowing from this approach, this article also uses expressions from existing medical terminology for convenience. Origin The term receives its name from Mariko Aoki, an otherwise little-known Japanese woman who contributed an essay in 1985 to the magazine ' (which means \\"Book Magazine\\"). In that essay, she related how she came to the realization that for some years, walking around a bookstore inevitably made her want to go to the restroom. The editors of the magazine received reports of other readers who had similar experiences, and named it the \\"Mariko Aoki phenomenon\\". Hypotheses Possible theories behind the phenomena include the smell of paper or ink having a laxative effect, the association with reading on the toilet at home, and the posture of browsing making bowel movement easier. The evidence for these explanations however remains weak. The psychological hypothesis that the effect arises from feelings of nervous tension in the face of all the information represented on the bookshelves is well supported by literary figures (see 6.4.1). History in Japan= Before \\"Mariko Aoki\\" = One known mention in Japan dating back many decades regarding a relationship between bookstores and the defecation urge is in Jun'nosuke Yoshiyuki's Amidst the Hustle and Bustle (1957), and similar mentions can be found in works by Jo Toyama (in 1972's The Emperor and the Lieutenant) or Shoichi Nejime (in 1981's Words, Too, Can Sweat‚ÄîLiterally), but it is uncertain from exactly what point in time the phenomenon first began to be a topic of discussion. It appears to have already been raised in the media from as early as the 1980s. For example, the magazine Common Man Weekly (August 31, 1984 issue) records television newscaster Tetsuo Suda talking about a similar experience. Also, the radio program Young Paradise (on Nippon Broadcasting System from 1983 to 1990) had a corner for sharing bowel movement related episodes, and one time the defecation urge felt in bookstores was discussed by being referred to as the \\"Yoshiko Yamada syndrome\\".

The classic clinical picture can be defined based on Mariko Aoki's original letter as follows: # after being in a bookstore for a long period of time (contributing factor), # suddenly (timing of onset), # an urge to defecate arises (symptom). All variations of the phenomenon are expressed in the form of the symptom of \\"an inexplicable defecation urge related to bookstores\\". It is not the case that there is any one particular disease or disorder called the \\"Mariko Aoki phenomenon\\".

(1970, Chikuma Shobo), Yoshio Kawakita asserted that \\"illness is actually not a scientific concept but is a pragmatic concept based on an understanding between the patient side and the physician side\\", and this assertion was borrowed by clinical psychologist Toshio Kasahara (2010), who stated that since most of the people who experience the Mariko Aoki phenomenon do not seek medical attention at hospitals or medical clinics, he does not consider it an illness.„ÄéÊú¨ÂøÉ„Å®ÊäµÊäó Ëá™Áô∫ÊÄß„ÅÆÁ≤æÁ•ûÁóÖÁêÜ„Äè„ÄÅp22 Psychiatrist Takashi Sumioka (1997), meanwhile, has noted the possibility that hidden behind the symptom of \\"wanting to go to the bathroom\\" may be a condition such as irritable bowel syndrome or anxiety disorder. = Contributing factors = Mariko Aoki relates that \\"being in a bookstore for a long period of time\\" or \\"smelling the scent of new books for a long period of time\\" will set off the series of symptoms. According to Aoki, the symptoms can develop in such situations regardless of the type of book, whether \\"when cradling a high-brow literary tome\\" or \\"when standing to browse-read a manga comic\\". Aoki also notes that the phenomenon can be reproduced more readily \\"when a bit constipated\\" or \\"on the morning after having a nightcap\\".

These kinds of \\"notions\\" are referred to in diagnostics as patient explanatory models, and can assist in elucidating the pathological condition. Many of the opinions look for a cause in chemical or physical stimulants existing in the bookstore environment. Mariko Aoki herself has offered as explanatory models \\"that the smell of new books upregulates metabolism\\" or \\"that the defecatory nerve center is stimulated by tracking your eyes across the spines of books\\".[„ÄéÊú¨„ÅÆÈõëË™å„Äè40Âè∑„ÄÅp55] An editor of Book Magazine believes that experiencing a defecation urge at certain bookstores is often due to the abdomen becoming being cooled as a result of the bookstores economizing on heating.[„ÄéÊú¨„ÅÆÈõëË™å„Äè41Âè∑„ÄÅp5] In contrast to this, a column on the website of secondhand bookstore chain Book Off stated that \\"it is because the air conditioning is too cold\\".[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö\\"Êú¨Â±ã„Åß„Éà„Ç§„É¨„Å´Ë°å„Åç„Åü„Åè„Å™„Çã„ÄåÈùíÊú®„Åæ„Çä„ÅìÁèæË±°„Äç„ÅÆË¨é] Other explanatory models than these include \\"paper allergy\\",[„ÄéÈÄ±ÂàäÂπ≥Âá°„Äè1984Âπ¥8Êúà31Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp100] \\"the scent of the ink unique to the color pages of centerfolds stimulates the bowel\\",[„ÄéÊï£Ê≠©„ÅÆÈÅî‰∫∫„Äè2005Âπ¥10ÊúàÂè∑„ÄÅp21] \\"the orderliness of books arranged on the shelves stimulates the brain\\",[„Äé„Ç≠„Éç„ÉûÊó¨Â†±„Äè2003Âπ¥7Êúà‰∏ãÊó¨Âè∑„ÄÅp184] \\"reading printed characters stimulates the cranial nerves, which issue a command to the lower body\\",[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö\\"Êú¨Â±ã„Å´Ë°å„Åè„Å®ÂÇ¨„Åô„ÅÆ„ÅØ„Å™„Åú\\"] \\"the tactile sensation of holding a book evokes the defecatory act\\",[„ÄéÊÄùÊÉ≥„ÅÆÁßëÂ≠¶„Äè1993Âπ¥3ÊúàÂè∑„ÄÅp125] \\"the relaxed upright posture when standing to read books instore causes feces to move downwards\\", and \\"because it is the person's custom to always fill up their empty stomach before going to a bookstore\\".[„ÄéÊú¨„ÅÆÈõëË™å„Äè40Âè∑„ÄÅp93] On the other hand, there is also a view that intrinsic factors such as individuals' mental status are the cause. For example, one university student who reported experiencing bodily distress in large bookstores and whose symptoms resolved upon entering a narrow bathroom cubicle interpreted the symptoms as being due to a type of agorapbhobia.[„ÄéÊú¨„ÅÆÈõëË™å„Äè41Âè∑„ÄÅp6] A 27-year-old worker living in Kyoto City who struggled with bookstore defecation urges heard that his steam locomotive obsessed friend, by contrast, had experience being struck by sudden defecation urges whenever locomotives approached, and thus considers that the \\"thrilling\\" mood felt when one is close to something one likes could be related to this phenomenon.[„ÄéÊú¨„ÅÆÈõëË™å„Äè41Âè∑„ÄÅp4] An Onojo City-based 26-year-old female piano teacher with a book bowel tendency has reflected that it may be due to the ethereal mental state when standing to read books in bookstores, one that is a mix of both relaxation and nervous excitement. = Olfactory stimulation hypothesis = Chemical substances  A hypothesis had existed for a long time that some chemical substances contained in the paper or ink of books emit a smell that induces the defecation urge by way of acute sensory stimulation. According to the Japanese essayist Mariko Ishibashi, this was \\"the leading theory\\" as of 1995.[„ÄéÈÄ±ÂàäÊúùÊó•„Äè1995Âπ¥7Êúà21Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp125] It also has a strong foothold in the online community as a dominant theory.[„ÄéÊú¨ÂøÉ„Å®ÊäµÊäó Ëá™Áô∫ÊÄß„ÅÆÁ≤æÁ•ûÁóÖÁêÜ„Äè„ÄÅp1] At the same time, it is also a theory that has been subject to much rebuttal. The television program The Real Side of Un'nan (TBS TV) conducted experiments from 1998 to 1999 to see whether the smell of ink could induce a defecation urge, but no results were obtained that supported the theory.[„Äé„Ç¢„É≥„Ç¢„É≥„Äè1999Âπ¥2Êúà19Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp60] In 2006, the philosopher Kenji Tsuchiya once attempted an experiment in which he gathered together some freshly delivered newspapers and newly purchased books, and then covered his face in the newspapers and books for 10 minutes each while doing deep breathing. Ultimately, no defecation urge eventuated, and instead he fell asleep with his face covered by the reading materials.[„ÄéÈÄ±ÂàäÊñáÊò•„Äè2006Âπ¥8Êúà31Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp90] Based on this experience, Tsuchiya contests that it can hardly be the case that paper, ink, adhesives, or some other substance from which books are composed could be the cause of the defecation urge. Shinichiro Namiki, a researcher of paranormal phenomena, held that this theory is difficult to sustain since (i) symptoms are not observed in workers at places such as printeries or bookstores and (ii) symptoms can occur at places unrelated to the smell of books, such as rental video stores.[„ÄéÊúÄÂº∑„ÅÆÈÉΩÂ∏Ç‰ºùË™¨3„Äè„ÄÅp187]  Conspiracy hypothesis There is also a hypothesis on the Internet that seeks to pin the cause on a conspiracy by the paper manufacturing industry.[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö\\"Êú¨Â±ã„Å®‰æøÊÑè„ÅÆË¨é\\"][„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö\\"Êú¨Â±ã„Åß„Éà„Ç§„É¨„Å´Ë°å„Åç„Åü„Åè„Å™„Çã„ÄåÈùíÊú®„Åæ„Çä„ÅìÁèæË±°„Äç„ÅÆË¨é\\"] According to this theory, the industry mixes large quantities of certain chemical substances into books and other paper products handled in day-to-day life, and these chemicals have the effect of stimulating the defecation urge, which increases the demand for toilet paper. = Conditioned response hypotheses= Defecation habits  Issue 41 of Book Magazine contains an interpretative model based on the notion of a conditioned response. The manga author Sadao Shoji has stated that he often experiences a defecation urge when looking at street maps or atlases, and that this occurs not only when in bookstores but also when at home. He has remarked that since the times that he usually looks at maps are before he has to go out somewhere, and since he has a habit of using the toilet before leaving the house, his mind became conditioned to react in that way.[„ÄéÊú¨„ÅÆÈõëË™å„Äè41Âè∑„ÄÅp13] There is also an interpretation that it is simply \\"because people always read on the toilet when at home\\".[„ÄéÊï£Ê≠©„ÅÆÈÅî‰∫∫„Äè2005Âπ¥10ÊúàÂè∑„ÄÅp21][„ÄéÊÄùÊÉ≥„ÅÆÁßëÂ≠¶„Äè1993Âπ¥3ÊúàÂè∑„ÄÅp125][„ÄéKansai„Ç∂„ÉÜ„É¨„Éì„Ç∏„Éß„É≥„Äè1998Âπ¥10Êúà24-30Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp82] The psychiatrist Kazuo Mishima interprets people with a book-bowel tendency as probably being people who by reading books on the toilet acquire a Pavlovian conditioning of \\"book reading ‚Üí bowel moving\\". There are some people who say that they are unable to successfully move their bowels unless they read something,[„ÄéÊú¨„ÅÆÈõëË™å„Äè41Âè∑„ÄÅp11] while some people so completely link defecation with reading that they \\"are able to finish off their reading readily when they have diarrhea but struggle to make progress in reading when they are constipated\\".[„ÄéÊÄùÊÉ≥„ÅÆÁßëÂ≠¶„Äè1993Âπ¥3ÊúàÂè∑„ÄÅp125] However, since it is not the case that all persons with a book-bowel tendency have the habit of reading while on the toilet, this theory has been criticized as not offering a wholly integrative explanation.[„Äé„Å™„ÅúÊú¨Â±ã„Åï„Çì„Åß„Éà„Ç§„É¨„Å´Ë°å„Åç„Åü„Åè„Å™„Çã„ÅÆ„Åã„Äè„ÄÅp56]  Hyperresponsiveness  In response to a request for an interview by the editorial team of Book Magazine in 1985, the psychiatrist Masao Nakazawa attempted to explain the set of symptoms by using the term \\"hyperresponsiveness\\".[„ÄéÊú¨„ÅÆÈõëË™å„Äè41Âè∑„ÄÅp14] In hyperresponsive reactions to stress, the sympathetic nerves take precedence, ordinarily leading to a constipative tendency. However, it is considered possible, in special circumstances‚Äîfor example, when shown a glass of cold milk‚Äîfor the gut to experiencing a loosening by way of a type of conditioned response mechanism. Nakazawa suggested that a similar mechanism could be involved in the Mariko Aoki phenomenon, but he refrained from providing a clear answer to the question, saying that \\"it needs to be looked into more first\\". The Japanese orthopedic surgeon and author Naruhito Fujita has said in relation to the Mariko Aoki phenomenon that the functions of the nervous system on the intestines are not as simple as something that can be explained in dualistic terms with the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö\\"‰æøÁßò„ÇíÊîπÂñÑ„Åô„ÇãÁßòÁ≠ñ Ëá™ÂæãÁ•ûÁµå„ÉÄ„Ç§„Ç®„ÉÉ„Éà„Éª„Åù„ÅÆ1\\"]  Trauma from childhood experiences  Among the discussions on the topic that took place in the television program The Real Side of Un'nan from 1998 to 1999, a theory was put forward that a conditioned defecation urge may be related to the trauma of a childhood experience, specifically, that the urge results from the flashback of a childhood memory of the embarrassment of soiling oneself in front of a public toilet. However, the psychologist who introduced this theory considered it to be a \\"lame explanation\\".  False belief  Mariko Aoki has said that she was initially skeptical about a \\"defecation urge experienced in bookstores\\", but after hearing about it from her friend she herself soon presented with the symptoms. In this way, it has been known from the outset that the phenomenon has a tendency to be transmitted from person to person.[„ÄéÊú¨„ÅÆÈõëË™å„Äè41Âè∑„ÄÅp15] In fact, despite the five members of the Book Magazine editorial team who reported on the phenomenon all being non book-boweled initially, three of them had developed a book bowel tendency by the time that their investigations into the topic had concluded. Certain types of psychiatric disorders such as delusion can be transmitted between people who are intimately close such as mothers and daughters or romantic couples by way of a kind of \\"false belief\\". In his book \\"Why Do People Feel the Need to Go When They're In a Bookstore?\\" (2012, Arimine Shoten), the gastroenterological surgeon Masayoshi Ido touches on the Mariko Aoki phenomenon by stating that the \\"past experience and future expectation of having experienced a defecation urge\\", the \\"supporting of this by knowledge that many others have had the same experience\\", and a \\"false belief that you will experience the same urge as other people\\" can have a psychosomatic impact by way of a conditioned response (a placebo effect).[„Äé„Å™„ÅúÊú¨Â±ã„Å´„ÅÑ„Çã„Å®„ÇÇ„Çà„Åä„Åô„ÅÆ„Åã„Äè„ÄÅp136] Ido acknowledges that this alone is unable to explain all aspects of the phenomenon as a whole, but considers that it at least accounts for part of the connection between bookstores and the defecation urge.[„Äé„Å™„ÅúÊú¨Â±ã„Å´„ÅÑ„Çã„Å®„ÇÇ„Çà„Åä„Åô„ÅÆ„Åã„Äè„ÄÅp137] On the other hand, there is also a report that casts a negative light on this theory. An online reporter conducted an experiment in which, in order to verify the effectiveness of bookstores in alleviating constipation, four constipated females were sent to a \\"trendy book cafe\\" to eat and drink.[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö\\"‰æøÁßòÂ•≥Â≠êÂøÖË¶ã!? „Å®„ÅÇ„ÇãÂ†¥ÊâÄ„ÅßÂ•≥Â≠ê‰ºö„Çí„Å≤„Çâ„ÅÑ„Å¶„Åø„Åü\\"] In order to prevent against the effects of false belief, the subjects were not told about the actual nature of the experiment (a blinded experiment). The result of the experiment was that, except for one subject with severe constipation, three of the test subjects soon achieved bowel movements. = Altered mental state hypotheses= Feelings of nervous tension or frantic frustration  It has been reported that the Mariko Aoki phenomenon is often seen in writers or people related to the publishing industry.[„ÄéÂãáÊ∞óÂáúÂáú„É´„É™„ÅÆËâ≤„Äè„ÄÅp237][„ÄéË™≠Â£≤Êñ∞ËÅû„Äè1997Âπ¥10Êúà9Êó•‰ªòÊúùÂàä„ÄÅp29] In an essay from 1981, the poet and novelist Shoichi Nejime confessed that he \\"is a person who experiences a defecation urge when he enters bookstores\\". Using the metaphor that these people \\"are the type of people who place themselves in the narrow gap between the borders of genre\\" (for example, a person who, despite being a poet, takes the attitude of seeking to avoid a literary odor in his work), Nejime holds that it is this type of people who possess \\"the sweat of the dynamism of the unconscious\\" (the power to move the minds of their readers).[„Äé„Å≠„Åò„ÇÅÊ≠£‰∏ÄË©©ÈõÜ„Äè„ÄÅp116] The essayist Mariko Ishibashi stated in a 1995 essay that the defecation urge is induced by the nervous tension generated when a \\"flood of information\\" pours into one's field of vision. Author Takashi Higaki has stated that one of his highly pleasing daily duties is to buy up a large number of books at the bookstore as part of his work, but that he \\"doesn't like hanging around in a bookstore for a long time because it triggers a defecation urge\\".[„Äé„Ç®„Ç≥„Éé„Éü„Çπ„Éà„Äè1997Âπ¥11Êúà11Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp11] In 1997 when The Yomiuri Shimbun interviewed two novelists, the first‚ÄîMariko Koike‚Äîproffered the theory that \\"the feeling of nervous tension provoked by being in a sacred place in which knowledge is collected sets off peristaltic movement\\", while the second‚ÄîJiro Asada‚Äîindicated a belief that \\"the mental pressure in response to printed words is the cause\\". On a 1998 episode of the television program The Real Side of Un'nan (broadcast October 28, 1998 on TBS Television), the novelist and lyricist Seiko Ito offered the hypothesis that the feeling of frantic frustration that \\"I have to decide which one to buy\\" gives rise to a defecation urge.[„ÄéKansai„Ç∂„ÉÜ„É¨„Éì„Ç∏„Éß„É≥„Äè1998Âπ¥10Êúà24-30Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp82] The thinker Tatsuru Uchida has stated that he is assailed by a defecation urge the moment that he reaches the state of an \\"academic high\\" when, after the plotting out of the content of an academic article has been protracted over a long period, an idea suddenly comes into his head.[„ÄéË™≠Â£≤Êñ∞ËÅû„Äè2006Âπ¥11Êúà26Êó•‰ªòÊúùÂàä„ÄÅp11] The astrologist Rene van Dahl Watanabe stated that intellectual appetite and curiosity are characteristics of bookstores, theorizing that the feeling of a type of nervous tension in response to these characteristics provoke the series of symptoms.[„Äé„É´„Éç„ÅÆÂ§¢Ëß£„Åç‰∫ãÂÖ∏„Äè„ÄÅp151] Touching on the phenomenon in which hamsters and other small animals defecate when they feel fear or nervous tension,[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö\\"‰æøÁßò„ÇíÊîπÂñÑ„Åô„ÇãÁßòÁ≠ñ Ëá™ÂæãÁ•ûÁµå„ÉÄ„Ç§„Ç®„ÉÉ„Éà„Éª„Åù„ÅÆ2\\"] the orthopedic surgeon and author Naruhito Fujita has explained the similar points between that and the phenomenon of a defecation urge being triggered by the \\"exciting and thrilling feeling\\" of being in a bookstore.[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö\\"‰æøÁßò„ÇíÊîπÂñÑ„Åô„ÇãÁßòÁ≠ñ Ëá™ÂæãÁ•ûÁµå„ÉÄ„Ç§„Ç®„ÉÉ„Éà„Éª„Åù„ÅÆ3\\"]  Psychosomatic disorder  When a patient is seen by a medical institution with complaints of \\"intolerable abdominal pain or discomfort due to constipation\\" and organic diseases are able to be ruled out through a detailed examination, the patient will receive treatment for psychosomatic disorder from a psychiatrist or a shinryo naika physician (psychosomatic internal medicine).[„ÄéË™≠Â£≤Êñ∞ËÅû„Äè1997Âπ¥10Êúà9Êó•‰ªòÊúùÂàä„ÄÅp29] From his examinations of patients complaining of \\"a defecation urge in bookstores\\", psychiatrist Takashi Sumioka has analyzed the causal factors that could affect psychosomatry as including \\"being surrounded by printed matter and feeling a pressure to find the book you're looking for\\", and says that he responds to such complaints by treating them as falling within the category of irritable bowel syndrome.[„ÄéË™≠Â£≤Êñ∞ËÅû„Äè1997Âπ¥10Êúà9Êó•‰ªòÊúùÂàä„ÄÅp29] Sumioka says that the reason why he tends to see more younger people and women among such patients is because these demographics are more readily susceptible to feelings of shame.[Ibid] This is because shame heightens psychological tension and this serves to aggravate the symptoms.[Ibid]  Somatic marker hypothesis  Working from Sumioka's abovementioned reference to irritable bowel syndrome, critic Ryoichi Takahashi interprets the Mariko Aoki phenomenon by raising theories such as \\"gut-brain correlation\\" and a \\"somatic marker hypothesis.\\" The essence of gut-brain correlation from the view of neurogastroenterology is that signals originating from the digestive tract exert a strong effect on the brain, and this is known to be one of the causes of irritable bowel syndrome.[„Äé„Å™„ÅúÊú¨Â±ã„Åï„Çì„Åß„Éà„Ç§„É¨„Å´Ë°å„Åç„Åü„Åè„Å™„Çã„ÅÆ„Åã„Äè„ÄÅp58] The somatic marker hypothesis, proposed by American neurologist Atonio Damasio, holds that somatized affect influences decision-making. Modern society has seen the increased advancement of information technology, but too much information can end up being harmful.[„Äé„Å™„ÅúÊú¨Â±ã„Åï„Çì„Åß„Éà„Ç§„É¨„Å´Ë°å„Åç„Åü„Åè„Å™„Çã„ÅÆ„Åã„Äè„ÄÅp75] Takahashi states that, according to the somatic marker theory, even a sudden defecation urge can be interpreted as a purposive response, and that the Mariko Aoki phenomenon is a state in which the body is unconsciously seeking to escape from an excess of information.[„Äé„Å™„ÅúÊú¨Â±ã„Åï„Çì„Åß„Éà„Ç§„É¨„Å´Ë°å„Åç„Åü„Åè„Å™„Çã„ÅÆ„Åã„Äè„ÄÅp76]  Anxiety disorder  Another well-known theory is that which states that a person entering a bookstore may feel psychological stress from worrying about what to do if they need to go to the toilet but there isn't one in the store, and that this has the unfortunate effect of focusing the person's conscious thoughts on bowel movements.[„Äé„Ç¢„Ç®„É©„Äè2003Âπ¥11Êúà17Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp74] In psychiatry, this type of mental stress is called \\"anticipatory anxiety,\\" and it is a characteristic symptom of panic disorder and other anxiety disorders. Japanese psychiatrist Takashi Sumioka states that when a patient complains of anxiety regarding the defecation urge, he sometimes diagnoses this as anxiety neurosis, which is a type of anxiety disorder.[„ÄéË™≠Â£≤Êñ∞ËÅû„Äè1997Âπ¥10Êúà9Êó•‰ªòÊúùÂàä„ÄÅp29] Yu Yuki, the pen name of prolific Japanese pop psychology author and psychiatrist Yuichiro Yasuda, considers it a possibility that the limited number of toilets in bookstores is responded to with obsessive elements.[„Äé„É¨„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Äè3Âè∑„ÄÅp21] Obsession is a subtype of anxiety disorder. Clinical psychologist Toshio Kasahara, meanwhile, conjectures that if a person suffering from this phenomenon is still going all the way to a bookstore despite experiencing anticipatory anxiety, their desire to go into a bookstore must be greater than that strong anxiety. According to Kasahara, it is easier to think that not the anxiety but rather something that seeks to overcome the anxiety is a contributory psychogenic cause of the phenomenon.[„ÄéÊú¨ÂøÉ„Å®ÊäµÊäó Ëá™Áô∫ÊÄß„ÅÆÁ≤æÁ•ûÁóÖÁêÜ„Äè„ÄÅp22]  Relaxation effect  There is also the converse opinion: that bookstores have a relaxation effect that stimulates bowel movements. In the stressful life of modern-day society, many people experience interrupted bowel habits and the constipation that this causes. In the weekly magazine Aera (November 17, 2003 edition; The Asahi Shimbun Co.), Japanese psychiatrist Kazuo Sakai--after first prefacing that he does not know the real answer--suggests that the activity of searching for the books one likes in the special environment of a bookstore might relax the body and give rise to a defecation urge.[„Äé„Ç¢„Ç®„É©„Äè2003Âπ¥11Êúà17Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp74] However, the notion of \\"bowel movement stimulation due to a relaxation effect\\" being behind the phenomenon is repudiated in the work of clinical psychologist Toshio Kasahara, who argues that although people attempting to enter relaxation states through the likes of autogenic training or meditation sometimes end up getting more nervous or even falling asleep, they do not experience a defecation urge.[„ÄéÊú¨ÂøÉ„Å®ÊäµÊäó Ëá™Áô∫ÊÄß„ÅÆÁ≤æÁ•ûÁóÖÁêÜ„Äè„ÄÅp24] On the other hand, psychiatrist Yu Yuki holds that the experiential fact that reading books makes people sleepy is proof of the relaxation effect of bookstores. He considers it a likely explanation that smells and movement and other such external stimuli as well as psychological factors bring about a relaxation effect, and that the resulting parasympathetic dominance in the autonomic nervous system induces effects such as intestinal peristalsis or contraction of the bladder.[„Äé„É¨„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Äè3Âè∑„ÄÅp21] Japanese social psychologist Shozo Shibuya, describing bookstores as places where our mutual disinterest in each other is naturally on display, theorizes that the phenomenon may be due to focusing one's attention on books without interference from other people and the resulting mental state of relaxation making one want to go to the toilet.[„Äé„Éû„É≥„Ç¨„Åß„Çè„Åã„ÇãÂøÉÁêÜÂ≠¶ÂÖ•ÈñÄ„Äè„ÄÅp9] = Posture and gaze related hypotheses = Posture when browse-reading while standing  The posture or gaze of a person while they browse-read a book while standing is often focused on as a contributory cause of the defecation urge. This is based on an interpretive model in which a defecation urge arises due to focusing one's gaze on a single point while adopting an upright or a slightly head-down posture.[„ÄéÂ≠£Âàä Êú¨„Å®„Ç≥„É≥„Éî„É•„Éº„ÇøÁ¨¨‰∫åÊúü„Äè2004Âπ¥ÂÜ¨Âè∑„ÄÅp59] It has also been suggested that upright reading while also carrying or shouldering baggage could put force on the abdominal muscles and stimulate a defecation urge.[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö‚ÄúÊú¨Â±ã„Åß‰æøÊÑè„ÇíÂÇ¨„ÅôÁêÜÁî±‚Äù] Based on his many years of observing customers, Mitsutaka Oka, former managing director at Japanese bookstore chain Junkudo, suggests that the phenomenon may be caused by a moderate level of nervous tension and the repeated action of slowly walking and then coming to a halt.[„ÄéÊΩÆ„Äè2002Âπ¥3ÊúàÂè∑„ÄÅp292] Rectal curvature when standing (left) and leaning over (right). The low-height book displays requiring the second posture are particularly common in Japanese bookstores.  Curvature of the bowel  An Osaka, Japan, clinical radiologist who issues an e-magazine about gut issues draws attention not to the posture of standing upright to read a book but the bodily movement of bending over to pick up books from flat piles on lower display cases.[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö‚ÄúÊú¨Â±ã„Åï„Çì„Å∏Ë°å„Åè„Å®„Å™„Åú„Åã„Éà„Ç§„É¨„Å´Ë°å„Åç„Åü„Åè„Å™„ÇãÊñ∞Ë™¨‚Äù] The rectum, located at the terminus of the digestive tract, is curved toward the rear when standing upright. The radiologist proposes that when the rectum stoops forward, the curvature is lost and any stool held there moves down to toward the anus.[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö‚ÄúÊú¨Â±ã„Åï„Çì„Å∏Ë°å„Åè„Å®„Å™„Åú„Åã„Éà„Ç§„É¨„Å´Ë°å„Åç„Åü„Åè„Å™„ÇãÊñ∞Ë™¨‚Äù]  Oppressiveness of bookshelves  Bookstores with narrow aisles may be particularly problematic. In discussions on the Japanese television program The Real Side of Un'nan from 1998 to 1999, the theory was advocated that, in addition to standing in an upright position for a long period of time, the \\"oppressive nature of bookshelves\\" may be a cause of stimulating the defecation urge.[„Äé„Ç¢„É≥„Ç¢„É≥„Äè1999Âπ¥2Êúà19Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp60] It was propounded that browse-reading books while standing upright in crowded bookstores which also have narrow aisles results in restricted movement of the body and induces a defecation urge. Actual experiments were conducted on the television program, but no clear conclusions were reached.  Gaze and autonomic nerves  Japanese plastic surgeon Kiyoshi Matsuo is cited as one of the thinkers who has focused on the relationship between the gaze of a person reading while standing in a bookstore and the autonomic nervous system. His theory was described in the December 17, 1998 edition of the magazine Bungei Shunju (published by Bungeishunju-sha). As a specialist in eyelids, Matsuo has performed many operations on patients with palpebral ptosis (drooping eyelid), and after noting that many of the patients suffering from ptosis also have symptoms like headaches and shoulder stiffness, has proposed the concept of \\"eyelid headaches.\\" Matsuo proposes that because the muscles that contract when we open our eyes (particularly M√ºller's muscle) are modulated by the sympathetic nervous system, the sympathetic nervous system of a person with ptosis can easily become hypertonic due to the constant effort being exerted to keep the eyelid raised, and that this impact becomes observable in the form of complaints such as headaches.[„ÄéÈÄ±ÂàäÊúùÊó•„Äè2003Âπ¥4Êúà18Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp37] Conversely, it can be considered that if the eye-opening muscles are in a continually relaxed state, the activity of the sympathetic nervous system is reduced and parasympathetic dominance is attained. Matsuo raises the example of meditation, in which loosening the eyelids can result in a relaxation effect.[„ÄéÊñáËóùÊò•Áßã„Äè1998Âπ¥12Êúà17Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp95] It is known that peristalsis of the digestive tract involves inhibitory action by the sympathetic nervous system and stimulatory action by the parasympathetic nervous system. Matsuo believes that because a person reading a book while standing in a bookstore will tend to have a downcast gaze, the operation of a mechanism similar to the foregoing may serve as one cause of motility being stimulated.[„ÄéÈÄ±ÂàäÊúùÊó•„Äè2003Âπ¥4Êúà18Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp37] According to Matsuo, by maintaining such a posture for 30 minutes or longer, it is possible to recreate this symptom not only in bookstores but also in libraries, video rental stores, and supermarkets.[„ÄéÊñáËóùÊò•Áßã„Äè1998Âπ¥12Êúà17Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp95] This theory has been considered comparatively strong.[„Äé„Ç¢„Ç®„É©„Äè2003Âπ¥11Êúà17Êó•Âè∑„ÄÅp74] However, it has also been opined that data exists that \\"relaxing the eyelids did not result in a defecation urge\\" and that it is not realistic that this theory alone can explain the phenomenon completely.[„ÄéÊú¨ÂøÉ„Å®ÊäµÊäó Ëá™Áô∫ÊÄß„ÅÆÁ≤æÁ•ûÁóÖÁêÜ„Äè„ÄÅp25]  Gazing-intensive search work  When following the letters on the spine of a book with our eyes, our gaze moves in a vertical direction. One famous interpretative model holds that this movement stimulates the defecation urge.[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö‚ÄúÊú¨Â±ã„Åß‰æøÊÑè„ÇíÂÇ¨„ÅôÁêÜÁî±‚Äù][„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö‚ÄúÊú¨Â±ã„Å´Ë°å„Åè„Å®„ÅäËÖπ„ÅåÁóõ„Åè„Å™„ÇãÁêÜÁî±‚Äù] According to those who have experienced the phenomenon, it is to do with the importance of the \\"angle of one's gaze when looking for something.\\"[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö‚Äú‰ªäÂ§ú„ÇÇÁîü„Åß„Åï„Å†„Åæ„Åï„Åó‚Äù] There is also the view that walking around a bookstore looking at printed text causes dizziness, which brings about a change in physical condition.[„Ç¶„Çß„Éñ„Éö„Éº„Ç∏Ôºö‚ÄúÊú¨Â±ã„Å´Ë°å„Åè„Å®„ÅäËÖπ„ÅåÁóõ„Åè„Å™„ÇãÁêÜÁî±‚Äù] In his book Why Do We Need To Go Whenever We're In A Bookstore? (Naze hon'ya ni iru to moyo'osu no ka) (2012; Arimine Shoten), the Japanese gastroenterological surgeon Masayoshi Ido states that, though there is no medical evidence, from experience the work of \\"moving one's eyes to find the target of our search from among rows of neatly arranged items\\" can induce the defecation urge.[„Äé„Å™„ÅúÊú¨Â±ã„Å´„ÅÑ„Çã„Å®„ÇÇ„Çà„Åä„Åô„ÅÆ„Åã„Äè„ÄÅp137] = Theory based on \\"denial of happiness\\" = Conception of Kasahara's idea  The Japanese clinical psychologist Toshio Kasahara is known for energetically seeking to have people understand the phenomenon through his original concept of \\"denial of happiness.\\" \\"Denial of happiness\\" is a concept based on the hypothesis that \\"when we are conscious of something that will benefit us, an unconscious 'resistance' to it appears in the form of a bodily symptom.\\" Although it is generally difficult to observe this concept in a visible form, he asserts that a similar concept to this is the so-called \\"slump\\" seen in sportspersons or artists.[„ÄéÊú¨ÂøÉ„Å®ÊäµÊäó Ëá™Áô∫ÊÄß„ÅÆÁ≤æÁ•ûÁóÖÁêÜ„Äè„ÄÅp116] First, Kasahara closely read the first article by Mariko Aoki then analyzed that the following two situations are those in which a \\"sudden defecation urge\\" emerges as a symptom: # being in a bookstore for an extended period of time # picking up a book (especially a book in which one is interested) and reading it  See also  *Bathroom reading *Irritable bowel syndrome *Toilets in Japan  References  Defecation Health in Japan Japanese mythology Japanese urban legends ","title":"Mariko Aoki phenomenon"},{"id":"38650564","text":"Monj-e Bala or Monj Bala () may refer to: * Monj-e Bala, Fars * Monj-e Bala, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari ","title":"Monj-e Bala"},{"id":"38650565","text":"\\"Tee Off, Mr. Bean\\" is the twelfth episode of the British television series Mr. Bean, produced by Tiger Aspect Productions and Thames Television for Central Independent Television. It was first broadcast on ITV on Wednesday, 20 September 1995.  Plot = Act 1: The Laundry = Mr. Bean goes to the launderette where he experiences a series of mishaps. Firstly, he realises that the cost of washing has increased from ¬£2 to ¬£3, so he curses and has to take out another pound coin from a specially designed envelope in his trousers. A black belt thug (Grant Masters) arrives and rudely pushes Bean away into the next front-load washing machine. Bean then proceeds to put his laundry, which consists of some shirts, an inflatable toy, a lampshade, Teddy, a welcome mat, two oversized fuzzy dice and a few pairs of underpants (each labelled with a different day of the week), into the washing machine. Bean then realises he has the wrong day's underpants on, so he stands behind a partition to change out of them, accidentally getting his trousers mixed up with a lady's skirt. As Bean, now wearing a skirt, walks past the man, this motivates the thug into taunting him. Bean then realised that another pair of underwear has accidentally not been put into the machine, but by this time, the machine has already been turned on, so he simply tries to put them on but the bully interferes by stepping on them for his own amusement. Finally having had enough of being bullied by the thug, Bean decides to get revenge by replacing the man's softener with a cup of black coffee from the vending machine. This works, as the man does not realise that he is pouring the coffee into the machine instead of his detergent. However, when the thug gets suspicious after sniffing the cup, Bean appears to drink the softener to make it look as if he is drinking coffee. Later, the thug blames the launderette's manager as his martial arts gear comes out of the machine, all severely stained from the coffee. After retrieving his mutated washing (including a shrunken Teddy) from the clothes dryer, Bean attempts to retrieve his trousers from the lady's washing by climbing into a dryer to find them just as the lady returns. Not noticing Bean is inside, the lady closes the door and turns the machine on, resulting in Bean spinning inside the dryer along with the clothes. = Act 2: The Game of Golf = Following the launderette, Bean heads to a golf course to play a game of mini golf. He scores a hole-in-one on the first hole, but on the second hole, he hits the ball onto the open grass. The owner (David Battley) orders him to play properly by using the club to get the ball back to the course and not with his hands. After accidentally hitting the ball outside the golf course, Bean goes on a very elaborate journey around London as the ball ends up on a bus, inside a lady's shopping bag (she is later seen explaining the scene to a police officer), on a boy's ice cream cone, up the exhaust pipe of a Proton Saga (causing the engine to explode), down a drain, into a litter bin, into a rubbish collection vehicle and finally onto the village green. When Bean attempts to hitchhike back to the golf course, the first car that drives in is the blue Reliant, which Bean ignores although the unseen driver opens the door for him. When another car pulls up, Bean cuts out the patch of turf the golf ball landed on with the golf club in order to allow him to return to the course without physically touching the ball. As the sun sets and the ending credits, Bean makes it back to the course just as it is closing for the day and finally rolls the ball into the hole, before leaving with a final score of 3,427 strokes.

Act 1 was recorded at Teddington Studios before a live audience. The Vauxhall Omega car that stops to give Bean a lift has the theme of the (already established) theme tune to The Vicar of Dibley (another Richard Curtis comedy) playing on the stereo. The music was also composed by Howard Goodall. A new version of the theme is used in the opening titles, performed by the Choir of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The golf course is close to Boulters Lock in Maidenhead ‚Äì just south of the junction between Ray Mead Road and Derek Road. The Village Green is in Littlewick Green near Maidenhead ‚Äì also seen in the episode where Teddy enters the Pet Show. The shops where Mr. Bean attempts to putt his ball out of a lady's shopping bag are located on Shifford Crescent, Maidenhead. Despite the Village Green and the lady's shopping bag incident taking place in Maidenhead, Bean was seen boarding a South London 405 bus when his golf ball bounces into it. This bus route runs from Redhill to West Croydon station and is many miles away from Maidenhead, even though the filming location for this scene is on Ray Mead Road, Maidenhead. The scene were Bean shreds a bar of soap with a cheese grater to create makeshift laundry detergent was later reproduced in an episode of Mr. Bean: The Animated Series titled \\"Spring Clean\\", while the scene where Mr. Bean went inside the washing machine and is spun around is replicated at the end of the episode \\"Goldfish\\".  Censorship  The scenes where Bean drinks the laundry detergent and climbs into the dryer are usually removed from reruns on Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland), along with the scene where the car engine explodes due to the golf ball stuck inside the vehicle exhaust pipe.

The march starts in Hyde Park and moves through Oxford Street in the famous West End shopping district, stopping traffic. It is followed by a rally in Trafalgar Square, with survivors of violence speaking to the crowd. MWR has no corporate sponsors, and the organisers are grassroots activists without ties to large charities or NGOs. It was founded in 2007 by campaigner and former outreach worker Sabrina Qureshi. She was motivated in part by her childhood experiences growing up on a multicultural London housing estate, where violence against women was often treated as normal and unremarkable. She was also inspired by women's movements around the world, including women she met during a visit to Palestine and the DRC who continued their activism even amid danger and violence. Million Women Rise (MWR) believes that male violence against women and children is a global pandemic that devastates lives and threatens to undermine efforts to bring about sustainable development.

Main characters= DCI Tom Barnaby = Detective Chief Inspector Thomas \\"Tom\\" Geoffrey Barnaby (John Nettles) (series 1‚Äì13)‚ÄîA senior member of Causton CID, Barnaby used to work for MI6. A patient, tolerant man, Barnaby's style of investigation is methodical and fair. Barnaby is a sagacious and perceptive individual, able to recognise seemingly obscure clues. Barnaby's social life revolves around his wife Joyce and his daughter Cully, who often provide a personal connection with the crimes that he is investigating. Barnaby's parents are both deceased by the episode \\"Blue Herrings\\". In his last appearance, \\"Fit for Murder\\", we learn that his father died on his birthday, at Barnaby's current age. = DS Gavin Troy = Detective Sergeant (later Inspector) Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey) (main: series 1‚Äì7; guest: series 11)‚ÄîDCI Barnaby's first assistant. Troy is bright and ambitious. Early in the series, Troy is also known for his careless driving, causing a number of near-accidents (which does not stop at all, even in his final/guest appearance). Troy is also prejudiced towards gay people (in the very first episode, \\"The Killings at Badger's Drift\\", he shows his discomfort by using a slur against the gay undertaker & in the episode \\"Blue Herrings\\", he uses a slur against a character who he perceives as being gay) and the elderly, referring to them as \\"wrinklies\\". In \\"Market For Murder\\" and \\"Destroying Angel\\" Troy provides valuable insight, finding out how the killers committed the murders, so oddly it was not Barnaby who solved those cases. In \\"Painted In Blood\\", Barnaby is forbidden to take part in the investigation, but Troy supplies him with information. Later on, Barnaby is taken hostage in a bank robbery and might have died until Troy snuck in and attacked the robber, yet at the same Troy would himself have been killed had Barnaby not stepped in, but together they overpower the robber. Troy's relationship with Barnaby is warm, and the two make a formidable pair. Troy was promoted to Inspector and transferred to Northumbria in the first episode of the seventh series, called \\"The Green Man\\". Troy makes one re-appearance in the first episode of Series 11, \\"Blood Wedding\\", to attend the wedding of Tom's daughter, Cully Barnaby (whom he once secretly kissed, which temporarily strained his relationship with Barnaby), where he met his second successor, Sgt Jones. = Dr George Bullard = Doctor George Bullard (Barry Jackson) (series 1‚Äì14)‚ÄîCauston's resident pathologist. Bullard goes about his work with a professional skill and a cheery personality. He is a good friend of Tom Barnaby's and has been a regular throughout the series (save for a brief spell, when his place was taken by Dr Dan Peterson played by Toby Jones). In later episodes Bullard has often played a greater role in the plot, even making a sterling appearance in the Midsomer Worthy Choir in \\"Death in Chorus\\". In one episode he admits to the \\"accidental\\" death of his first wife while on tour at a slaughter house. At the end of \\"The Oblong Murders\\" Bullard tells Barnaby that he's going to take some time off: \\"I've decided to do some fishing. Like Tom. He suggested a holiday in Ireland.\\", which is most likely his retirement (like Tom). = Joyce Barnaby = Joyce Barnaby (Jane Wymark) (series 1‚Äì13)‚ÄîDCI Tom Barnaby's long-suffering wife. She is tolerant of her husband, despite his being a workaholic who spent their honeymoon solving the case of the \\"Pimlico Poisoner\\", which suggests that they met in London. Joyce is an easy-going and friendly woman who likes to be involved in community activities. She has long possessed a desire to move out of their Causton home and into one of the picturesque Midsomer villages‚Äîonly to be put off by the grisly murders that occur there. She's known to her family as an experimental, but not always successful, cook. Thus, Tom is often seen taking advantage of every opportunity to dine out. She married Tom in 1973 and their only child, Cully, was conceived on their honeymoon. Her parents are called Muriel and Douglas. = DS Dan Scott = Detective Sergeant Daniel \\"Dan\\" Scott (John Hopkins) (series 7+8)‚ÄîHe is a lot cockier than his predecessor DS Troy; he is a Londoner who was not thrilled at being transferred from the Metropolitan Police Service to Midsomer, which he regards as the \\"sticks\\". His relationship with Tom was prickly at first; but it mellowed into a slightly awkward marriage of convenience, with Barnaby still disapproving of Scott's methods and Scott grudgingly starting to respect Barnaby. In \\"The Straw Woman\\", Scott develops a love interest who is brutally murdered. The episode is notable for Barnaby's lack of sympathy for Scott. Scott's departure from the show was abrupt. In \\"The House in the Woods\\", Barnaby describes Scott as having called him to say he was sick and thus unable to come to work. Barnaby invites Ben Jones to assist him on that case. After this incident, no more is heard from Scott, and Jones becomes the new deputy. = DS Ben Jones = Detective Sergeant (later Inspector) (previously Police and Detective Constable) Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Jones (Jason Hughes) (main: series 9‚Äì15; guest: series 19)‚ÄîJones is Tom Barnaby's third and final junior. as well as being the only one to serve opposite both of the Barnaby cousins. Unlike Troy and Scott, who first appeared on the series as plain-clothed detective sergeants, Jones was a uniformed police constable when he was first introduced. Jones was first appointed as a Detective Constable, as well as Barnaby's second-in-command (after assisting Barnaby during Sgt Scott's absence), and promoted to Detective Sergeant by the end of his first series. Jones is considerably less naive than Troy or Scott, possessing an insight into cases that neither would have. Jones was born in Wales and remarks about his love for Wales when he and Tom travel there in the episode \\"Death and Dust\\". He used to be a Freemason, as revealed in \\"King's Crystal\\". In the episode \\"Death in Chorus\\", Jones exhibits a remarkable vocal talent and is recruited to sing tenor in the Midsomer Worthy choir. In \\"Death in the Slow Lane\\", it is revealed that Jones was interested in replacing Tom Barnaby upon his retirement and was a little put out by his cousin, John Barnaby, being transferred to the position instead. In reality, he could not have been given the post because it would have required him to bypass the rank of inspector. In \\"Murder Of Innocence\\", it is revealed that Jones is in a relationship with firefighter Susie Bellingham. In the series 16 opener, \\"The Christmas Haunting\\", it is revealed that Jones had been promoted to Inspector and transferred to Brighton. A photo of Jones (alongside Kate Wilding, who also moved to Brighton) is shown in the series 18 opener \\"Habeas Corpus\\". DI Jones made a further appearance in episode 3 of series 19 \\"Last Man Out\\", in an undercover role - erroneously still listed in the credits as DS Ben Jones. = DCI John Barnaby = Detective Chief Inspector John Barnaby (Neil Dudgeon) (guest: series 13; main: series 14‚Äìpresent)‚ÄîBarnaby transferred from Brighton to Midsomer's Causton CID to replace his older cousin, Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, when Barnaby retired. He has a degree in Psychology from Durham University, which earned him some ribbing from DS Jones when he first arrived; however, despite a rocky start, the two make a formidable team. Barnaby lives in a large country cottage with his wife Sarah, daughter Betty, and their dog Sykes (later Paddy). He first makes a guest appearance in the series 13 episode, \\"The Sword of Guillaume\\" before taking over in the series 14 premiere, \\"Death in the Slow Lane.\\" Dudgeon actually made his first appearance on the show not as John Barnaby, but as womanising gardener Daniel Bolt in the series 4 opener \\"Garden of Death\\". = Sarah Barnaby = Sarah Barnaby (Fiona Dolman) (series 14‚Äìpresent)‚ÄîJohn Barnaby's wife is the headmistress of a local secondary school. As she has a full-time career of her own (unlike Joyce), she does not figure as much in her husband's cases; and they don't have any children (until the end of the sixteenth series), although you may consider Sykes, their dog, as their child. They have a loving marriage and celebrated their fifteen-year anniversary in \\"Schooled for murder\\". Throughout the sixteenth series Sarah is pregnant and in the last episode of the series she gives birth to their first child, a daughter, called Betty. = Dr. Kate Wilding = Doctor Kate Wilding (Tamzin Malleson) (series 14‚Äì17)‚ÄîDr George Bullard's replacement as resident pathologist. Her confident, competent, no-nonsense approach has earned the detectives' respect. She is unmarried and is also a professor. Her parents, Giles and Laura, have appeared in one episode, \\"The Flying Club\\".http://www.itv.com/documents/doc/darkrider1.doc In the series 18 opener, \\"Habeas Corpus\\", Wilding has left Midsomer to take up a professorship in Brighton. She is briefly seen on-screen in a photo with Ben Jones, who had previously relocated to Brighton. = DS Charlie Nelson = Detective Sergeant Charlie Nelson (Gwilym Lee) (series 16‚Äì18)‚ÄîWhen Jones was promoted, he was replaced by DS Charlie Nelson. Nelson was the first Sergeant to not serve alongside Tom Barnaby. He was a lodger at Kate's house. Nelson left the series after season 18. = Dr. Kam Karimore = Doctor Kam Karimore (Manjinder Virk) (series 18+19)‚ÄîDr Kate Wilding's replacement as resident pathologist. She said that she grew up with four red setters and a Labrador. At the end of series 19 she has taken a job in Montreal. = DS Jamie Winter = Detective Sergeant Jamie Winter (Nick Hendrix) (series 19‚Äì)‚Äî At the beginning of series 19 DS Jamie Winter arrived. It is revealed that Winter had previously crossed paths with Dr Kam Karimore. Supporting characters= DC Gail Stephens = Detective Constable Gail Stephens (Kirsty Dillon) (series 10‚Äì13)‚Äîa colleague of Tom Barnaby and DS Jones, who often helps them in their cases, sometimes providing valuable insight. Gail was transferred to Midsomer from Binwell. Gail is cheery but emotional, breaking down in tears when, after initially serving as a uniformed woman police constable, she was appointed as a plain- clothed CID detective. Throughout Gail's appearances, it is implied that she is on the point of having an affair with Sgt Jones, but when it came to the crunch he decided that he did not want to get too heavily involved with a colleague, after which Gail effectively snubbed him. Strangely, Gail has not been seen since \\"Fit For Murder\\". = Cully Barnaby = Cully Barnaby (later Dixon) (Laura Howard) (series 1‚Äì13)‚ÄîTom and Joyce's only child takes her first name from a village on Lake Geneva in Switzerland, where she was conceived during her parents' honeymoon. An inquisitive and bold young woman, she's inherited her parents' friendly attitudes and community spirit. Early in the series, she attended Cambridge University and dated a fellow drama student, called Nico. After that, she sometimes went out with and secretly flirted with DS Troy and DS Scott.

It was first broadcast on ITV on Tuesday, 31 October 1995.  Plot = Act 1: The Hospital = Because his left hand got stuck in a teapot, Mr. Bean drives to hospital where he parks his car right behind an ambulance, obstructing the rear doors in the process. Inside, Bean gets impatient while waiting in the queue and cheats his way to the front by rudely throwing a little girl's doll and then starting a fight between two men. After Bean pulls his numbered ticket from the dispenser, he races towards the last remaining chair in the waiting room, sitting down just in time to prevent a frail old man from sitting there. He sits next to a seriously- injured female patient (with head wrapped in bandages, and an arm and a leg in plaster), and taunts her by stretching his neck, waving his hands, and crossing his legs. Bean sees his ticket numbered 76 as the digital counter shows 23. Just as Bean checks the time on his watch, he inadvertently reveals his hand stuck in his teapot, prompting the woman at the reception desk and the patient sitting next to him to laugh at him. Annoyed with how long he is forced to wait, Bean then swaps his ticket for a lower numbered ticket, showing 52, from the severely-injured patient, and sneakily turns the digital counter upside down so that 25 will look like 52. However, the patient thwarts Bean by grabbing on the handle of the teapot on his hand, and the digital counter is returned to its normal position after patients complain of their tickets being ignored. Some time later, Bean falls asleep in waiting and, as the digital counter reaches the real 52, wakes up and loses his ticket (back to the patient who originally had it). As a result, Bean has to get another ticket and he, once again, starts a fight between the same two men from earlier to get immediately to the reception desk. Bean gets angry and frustrated when he takes a higher number ticket and he throws it in the bin, but his other hand becomes stuck as he tries to push down the ticket into the bin to show his frustration. Unable to recover it, he uses his mouth to take out another ticket from the dispenser, and Bean walks to his seat with his hand still stuck in the bin. = Act 2: The Queen's Guard = Following the hospital, Bean visits Windsor Castle where he takes a few photographs, including one of the inside of a dustbin and another of a nude statue after covering the private part with a plastic wrapper from the bin. He then pries the gnomon off a sundial to place his Polaroid camera on the stand, in order to get a photo of himself with a Queen's Guard (Rupert Vansittart). He dresses the guard up with flowers and other things, trims his moustache (into a toothbrush style, similar to that of Adolf Hitler and Charlie Chaplin) and hangs Teddy off his bayonet. While Bean is doing this, the guard attempts to remain motionless (which proves difficult as especially when Bean starts to dangerously clean the trigger of his rifle). Just as Bean has wound the self- timer on his camera, the charge is called and the guard marches away along with Teddy just before the camera snaps the photo. Off screen, Bean groans in anger and frustration from this. = Act 3: Sleeping Trouble = Later that night, Bean gets ready for bed (after using his new electric toothbrush to clean his teeth and ears, reading an Asterix comic with Teddy and then putting Teddy to sleep and finally shooting out the incandescent light bulb with a pistol) but has trouble falling asleep. He scares away noisy cats outside the window by disguising himself as a dog and barking, then tries sleeping in different positions (along with sleeping with his face on pillow until he can't breathe), then watches a chess game on TV. As he nearly falls asleep, he becomes startled when the television channel cuts to a Bodyform advertisement via a star swipe featuring loud rock music. Finally, he takes out a picture of a flock of sheep and begins counting them, first with his finger and then, after losing count a few times, with the assistance of a calculator. When he sees the number of sheep (albeit inaccurate) on the calculator display, he finally falls asleep. After the closing credits, he rolls out of bed and falls onto the floor, ending the episode. Cast * Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean * Elizabeth Bennett as Hospital Receptionist * Suzy Aitchison as Hospital Nurse * Rupert Vansittart as Queen's Guard  Production  The opening and closing titles featured a new recording of the choral theme, performed by the Choir of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, which debuted in Tee Off, Mr. Bean. The first act was filmed at the permanently closed National Temperance Hospital in London. Studio sequences were recorded before a live audience at Teddington Studios. The scene in Act 2 where Bean covered the private part of the nude statue of an angel with a plastic wrapper from the waste bin for censorship purposes before the picture was taken was replicated in the Mr. Bean: The Animated Series episode \\"Art Thief\\". The other episode \\"Big TV\\" also featured Bean turning on his television with a glove attached to a broomstick, as referenced on the latter part of Act 3. The scene in Act 1 where Mr. Bean parked the car behind the ambulance and obstructing the rear doors was reproduced in the episode \\"A Running Battle\\".  Censorship  The scene where Bean turns the light off by shooting the incandescent light bulb with his pistol was cut from some broadcasts for this episode on Nickelodeon, due to its violent nature.

RFC954 NICNAME/WHOIS, IETF, October 1985, Accessed 26th February 2013 WHOIS was an early networked directory service, originally maintained by SRI International for the Defense Data Network. The WHOIS protocol is still widely used to allow domain ownership records in the Internet to be easily queried. WHOIS++ attempted to address some of the short comings in the original WHOIS protocol that had become apparent over the years. It supported multiple languages and character sets to help with I18N issues, had a more advanced query syntax, and the ability to generate \\"forward knowledge\\" in the form of 'centroid' data structures that could be used to route queries from one server to another. The protocol was designed to be backward compatible with the older WHOIS standard, so that WHOIS++ clients could still extract meaningful information from the already deployed WHOIS servers. Whilst WHOIS++ as a white pages directory service never really took off compared to competitors such as X.500, it did gain a notable amount of use in the United Kingdom as the underlying search and retrieval protocol of a number of subject based gateways funded as part of the Jisc Electronic library programme. This was achieved using software called ROADSROADS open source (GPL) software distribution containing WHOIS++ server and client implementations that provided WHOIS++ base and index servers and CGI based web interfaces to WHOIS++ clients. The use of centroids to provide forward knowledge and query routing allowed a subject gateway to not only provide resources to academic users from their own database but also point them at other JISC funded subject gateways that might have useful information. The WHOIS++ protocol is now designated by the IETF as a historic protocol and is no longer deployed in new systems or developed.

Gremium claims to be the largest German motorcycle club since the patchover of the also formerly Mannheim-based german chapters of the Bones MC to the Hells Angels MC in 1999, with 73 full chapters in Germany, 71 chapters in other European countries, several associate chapters (Bad 7 MC support club) in Germany, and a prospect chapter opened by German expatriates in Pattaya, Thailand in 2007. The club was established in 1972 in Mannheim. The club colors are black and white, on the back patch appears the word \\"GREMIUM\\" and the name of the country with a fist rising through clouds. Often, the terms \\"Black Seven\\" and the number 7 are used: the word \\"Gremium\\" consists of seven letters, and \\"G\\" is the seventh letter in the alphabet. Criminal investigations and sanctions The society as a whole was prohibited on 10 November 1988 by the Ministry of the Interior of Baden-W√ºrttemberg as a criminal organization.Landesrecht BW B√ºrgerservice At the time of confrontation with the Mannheim judiciary, the bylaws were closely based on the Mannheim Studentenverbindung (student society or fraternity) \\"Hermunduria\\" in which the then President Michael \\"Mike\\" Heyer had been a member as a law student. Unaware of its origins, the prosecutor made accusations regarding forming a criminal association in addition to other offences. In subsequent criminal proceedings ordered by the District Court of Mannheim, the prosecution accused certain members of the club of crimes. The prosecutor, whose club informant turned out to be unreliable in court, had the charge of forming a criminal organization then fail. On 16 January 1992, the club ban was lifted by the Administrative Court of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Despite appropriate investigative efforts of the authorities,For example, Verfassungsschutzbericht Bayern 2005 , page 240‚Äì since it came only to convictions of individual members only and not as a renewed accusation against such a club. Gremium is regularly listed among other large motorcycle clubs, for example in the Annual Report on the Protection of the Constitution on Bavaria. In these reports, the body, with other mentioned motorcycle clubs associated with it, is associated with human trafficking, illegal prostitution, drug and/or weapons trafficking and organized crime. According to the German Federal Criminal Police Office in 2010, there were five organized crime investigation with respect to Gremium.

Maceljski (born Freivel Benjamin Deutsch; March 16, 1828 - May 6, 1919) was Croatian nobleman, industrialist who had a significant impact on the development of Turopolje near Velika Gorica and timber industry in that region. Deutsch was born on March 16, 1828 to a Jewish family. He was married to Amalija (n√©e Schwarz) Deutsch with whom he had three sons, Vilim, Albert and Benko. His sons later became notable Croatian industrialists and philanthropists. From early age Deutsch was active entrepreneur, in Zagreb he had a storage company for timber and firewood sale. In 1884 his company \\"Filip Deutsch i sinovi Zagreb\\" (Filip Deutsch and sons Zagreb) produced the columns for the Podsused bridge. Deutsch bought, in 1910, 50 acres of land from the noble municipality Turopolje. On that land, in 1911, Deutsch founded the steam sawmill in Turopolje which he named \\"Paropilana Filipa Deutscha sinova\\". He immediately began to lift the objects for the sawmill, houses for workers and specialists which were brought from Zagreb and other Croatian regions. Houses were built in a rows and were called \\"Kolonija\\" (The Colony). In June 1911 Deutsch sawmill started to produce oak sawn wood, mostly from the Turopolje forest, with the capacity of 40,000 m3. Deutsch built and spread the sawmill as production expanded. He also built about 10 kilometers of railways for the Burdelj and Turopoljski lug. At the peak of success Deutsch sawmill employed about 600 workers. Deutsch workers were treated fairly with eight-hour working day, which was a rarity at the time, with supplied hot meals, decent salaries and housing for every worker. Deutsch was also a great philanthropist who often aided the poor. In Zagreb, twice a year, he would donated two to three wagons of wood during the winter. For his contribution on the development of Turopolje region Deutsch was awarded with the title pl. (plemeniti = noble ) Maceljski per Macelj forest.

An appeal from a decision in the Cape Provincial Division by Yekiso J, it was heard in the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) on 18 February 2008. Mpati DP, Cameron JA, Mlambo JA, Combrinck JA and Cachalia JA presided, handing down judgment on 31 March. Counsel for the appellant was KPCO von Lieres und Wilkau SC (with RB Engela); NJ Treurnicht SC (with AC Oosthuizen SC) appeared for the respondent. The appellant's attorneys were Van der Spuy Attorneys, Cape Town, and Hill McHardy & Herbst Ing, Bloemfontein. The respondent was represented by the State Attorney, Cape Town, and the State Attorney, Bloemfontein. The court found that the right to fair labour practices, in section 23(1) of the Constitution, imports into the common-law contract of employment the general term that the employer will not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated and likely to destroy or seriously damage its relationship of confidence and trust with its employee. The court thus imposed \\"a new general and contractual obligation on employers\\"Basson and Christianson Essential Labour Law 47.‚Äîa duty of fair dealing with employees. In this the court had broken with the much-criticisedSee Brassey New Labour Law 2-9. common-law rule that \\"an employer is free to terminate the contract at any stage, for any reason or indeed for no reason or the worst possible reason, provided only that the requisite notice is given.\\"Grogan Workplace Law 3. The contract of employment, therefore, may now be relied upon where there is an overlap with section 186(2) of the Labour Relations ActAct 66 of 1995. (LRA), or where that section does not provide for a remedy.Basson and Christianson Essential Labour Law 196. The court also considered what constitutes constructive dismissal: that is to say, broadly speaking, resignation due to intolerable conditions at work. It found that, although certain employees are not recognised as such for the purposes of the LRA, the constitutional right to fair labour practices is nevertheless applicable to them, and that the common-law contract of employment now includes protection against constructive dismissal. The employee had a contractual right not to be dismissed. It was also held that, for a successful claim based on constructive dismissal, the employer must not only be responsible for the circumstances which induce the employee to resign; it must also be to blame for those circumstances.  Facts  Murray instituted action in the High Court in which he claimed damages for loss of income consequent upon his alleged constructive dismissal from the South African Navy, because its \\"continual unfair and ill-treatment\\" of him over a period of some two and a half years had left him with no alternative but to resign from his post. The Navy's response to the operational conundrum involving the appellant had been to offer him, immediately prior to his resignation, an alternative post at Naval Headquarters in Pretoria. The Navy made no effort, however, to explain the job to the appellant, and so he rejected the offer. Had Murray been covered by the LRA, he would have had specific remedies in terms of the Act. As the Act does not apply to members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), however, he relied on purely contractual grounds when he approached the High Court.Basson and Christianson Essential Labour Law 47. The High Court found that the employment relationship had not broken down irretrievably and that none of the appellant's complaints had rendered his position intolerable or caused him to resign, and accordingly dismissed the action.  Judgment  On appeal to the SCA, Cameron JA held‚Äîand Mpati DP, Mlambo JA, Combrinck JA and Cachalia JA concurred‚Äîthat, since the LRA expressly excluded members of the SANDF from its operation, there was no directly applicable statute to the present set of circumstances. Section 23(1) of the Constitution, which guaranteed everyone \\"the right to fair labour practices,\\" did, however, cover members of the defence force. Consistent with that right, Cameron broadened the common law of employment so as to impose a duty of fair dealing with their employees on all employers, including those not covered by the LRA. In addition to the right to fair labour practices, Cameron found that Murray was entitled to rely on his right to dignity and his contractual rights.Para 5. Cameron held further that South African employment law implied into a contract of employment a general term that the employer would not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner calculated and likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust with the employee. Breach of the term would amount to a contractual repudiation justifying the employee in resigning and claiming compensation for dismissal.Para 8. Viewed, in the alternative, through the constitutional standard, the constitutional guarantee of fair labour practices, Cameron found, continued to cover a non-LRA employee who resigned because of intolerable conduct by his employer, and to offer protection through the constitutionally-developed common law. If it was thus found that unfair conduct by the navy had forced the appellant to resign, he would be entitled to damages for dismissal.Para 9. Cameron determined that the mere fact that an employee had resigned because his work had become intolerable was not enough to make it a constructive dismissal. The critical circumstances had to have been of the employer's making; in addition, the employer had to be to blame, culpably responsible in some way, for the intolerable conditions. The conduct had to have lacked \\"reasonable and proper cause.\\"Para 13. There could be little doubt in Cameron's mind that, when the appellant had resigned his position at work, it had been intolerable. There was equally little doubt that this was because of the navy's conduct. The question, then, was whether or not the navy had had reasonable and proper cause for what it did in making the appellant's position intolerable, or (viewed through the constitutional standard) whether it had acted fairly in making his position intolerable. Was the navy to blame, in other words?Para 14. Cameron held, on the evidence before him, that the Navy had established in most respects that its management of the appellant's employment was substantially fair. Only in one respect was it unfair: its decision to downgrade the appellant's post without first consulting with him.Paras 43, 53. The answer to the appellant's action lay in the navy's offer of an alternative post to the appellant immediately prior to his resignation. Given the background of the appellant's case, the Navy could not be faulted for not returning the appellant to his original post. In the particular circumstances, however, the law clearly placed a duty on the employer to consult fully with the employee affected and to share information to enable him to make informed decisions. The navy, noted Cameron, had not fulfilled that responsibility: Explaining the job offer was anything but superfluous, since it was an entirely new position, and in addition the appellant's subjective condition of suspicion, demoralisation and depression, which was evident to those dealing with him, was materially relevant to how the navy was required by fairness to deal with him. His condition meant that an unexplained offer of a new post was likely to be rejected. The lack of explanation, follow-up and elucidation did not constitute fair dealing. The navy had breached its common-law duty to treat Murray fairly, thus rendering his resignation a constructive dismissal.Paras 55, 59. Had the navy adequately and fairly explained the post to the appellant, and the backup it offered, his position would not, Cameron found, have been intolerable. Its failure to do so meant that the operating cause of the appellant's resignation was the navy's conduct.Para 63. The appeal, accordingly, had to be upheld. The order of the court a quo was set aside and replaced with an order declaring that the plaintiff was entitled to such compensation as he might prove for his constructive dismissal by the defendant.Para 68. The decision in Murray v Minister of Defence2007 (3) SA 374 (C). was thus reversed.  Legacy  Murray was followed in Daymon Worldwide SA Inc. v CCMA and Others,(2009) 30 ILJ 575 (LC). where the Labour Court found that a company had done what it could to assist a woman who had resigned because she had allegedly been sexually harassed. In Mogothle v Premier, Northwest Province,Unreported J2622/08 dd 5/1/2009. the Labour Court relied on the employer's duty of fair dealing with employees to find the suspension of an employee unfair not in terms of section 186 of the LRA, but rather in terms of the common law.

Examples of these include Search, Gmail, Translate or Google Maps. Third-party apps can use these APIs to take advantage of or extend the functionality of the existing services. The APIs provide functionality like analytics, machine learning as a service (the Prediction API) or access to user data (when permission to read the data is given). Another important example is an embedded Google map on a website, which can be achieved using the Static maps API, Places API or Google Earth API.  Authentication and Authorization  Usage of all of the APIs requires Authentication and Authorization using the Oauth 2.0 protocol. Oauth 2.0 is a simple protocol. To start, it is necessary to obtain credentials from the Developers Console. Then the client app can request an access Token from the Google Authorization Server, and uses that Token for authorization when accessing a Google API service.  Client libraries  There are client libraries in various languages which allow developers to use Google APIs from within their code, including Java, JavaScript, Ruby, .NET, Objective-C, PHP and Python. The Google Loader is a JavaScript library which allows web developers to easily load other JavaScript API provided by Google and other developers of popular libraries. Google Loader provides a JavaScript method for loading a specific API (also called module), in which additional settings can be specified such as API version, language, location, selected packages, load callback (computer programming) and other parameters specific to a particular API. Dynamic loading or auto-loading is also supported to enhance the performance of the application using the loaded APIs.  Google Apps Script  Google Apps Script is a cloud-based JavaScript platform which allows developers to write scripts only owner can manipulate API services such as Calendar, Docs, Drive, Gmail, and Sheets and easily create Add-Ons for these services with chromium based applications.  Common use cases  User registration is commonly done via Google, which allows users to securely log into third-party services with their Google account through the Google Sign-in system. This is currently available from within Android (operating system) or by using JavaScript. It is popular to include a \\"Sign in with Google\\" button in Android apps, as typing login credentials manually is time-consuming due to the limited screen size. As the user is usually signed into their Google account on their mobile device, signing-in/signing-up for a new service using a Google account is usually a matter of a few button clicks. Drive apps are various web applications which work within Google Drive using the Drive API. Users can integrate these apps into their Drive from the Chrome Web Store, allowing them to work entirely in the cloud. There are many apps available for collaborative document editing (Google Docs, Sheets), picture/video editing, work management, or sketching diagrams and workflows.

The route ran from Watsontown, Pennsylvania to Berwick, Pennsylvania. The railroad was 39.22 miles long, with 3.51 miles of branches, totaling 42.83 miles. The railroad was also known as the \\"Sweet By and By\\". Trains typically ran along the railroad six days a week. What remains of it is currently a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Predecessors The Susquehanna, Bloomsburg and Berwick began as the Wilkes-Barre and Western Railway, incorporated on June 22, 1886 to build from Watsontown to Shickshinny. It opened of line from Watsontown to Millville in 1887, and in 1891, opened an additional from Millville Junction, just south of Millville, to Orangeville. The promoters of the Wilkes-Barre and Western envisioned it as part of a trunk line which would move bituminous coal east from the Clearfield Coalfield and anthracite west from Wilkes-Barre. Two affiliated railroads were chartered to help build these connections: the Turbotville and Williamsport Railroad was incorporated on November 18, 1892 to build from Turbotville to Williamsport, while the Orangeville and Lehigh Railroad was incorporated on December 12, 1892 to build north from Orangeville to Hauser's Mills, now Pocono Lake, on the line of the Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Railroad. Neither of these two roads were constructed and they were consolidated with the Wilkes- Barre and Western on March 1, 1893 to form the Central Pennsylvania and Western Railroad. This railroad was reorganized on July 31, 1902 as the Susquehanna, Bloomsburrg and Berwick Railroad. History The Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad was originally called the Wilkes-Barre and Western Railroad, but renamed when its ownership was passed to a different company. Under this name, it was formed in 1885 and carried the first trains in 1887. The railroad was mostly constructed using manual labor. The laborers consisted of locals, Italian workers, and Hungarian workers. By 1891, the road extended as far east as Orangeville, but this course was abandoned in favor of routing the railroad to Berwick via Lightstreet. The Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad originally only ran from Watsontown to Lightstreet, Pennsylvania. However, in 1903 the railroad was extended from Berwick to Eyers Grove. In that year, the railroad company discontinued its branch line from Eyers Grove to Orangeville due to a lack of business. However, it retained its branch line from Eyers Grove to Millville. By 1911, the Pennsylvania Railroad owned nearly all of the Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad Company's stock.http://www.multimodalways.org/docs/railroads/companies/PRR/PRR%20Centenial%20History/PRR%20CH%20Part%20Eight.pdf The Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick railroad was absorbed by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1918. It carried passengers for some years longer, although by 1940, passenger trains stopped running along the Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad. However, the rail line continued to be used for other purposes until the late 1960s, when the American Car and Foundry plant in Berwick closed. After the closing of the plant, the railroad's use was negligible and the tracks entered a state of disrepair. By the beginning of the 1980s, the tracks east of Washingtonville had been removed. However, as of 2009, the railroad tracks from Washingtonville to Watsontown are still used. There were once plans to extend the railroad as far east as Shickshinny, but these plans were never put into practice. Additionally, there were plans to extend the railroad west from Watsontown to merge with railroads carrying coal from Clearfield County. Stations and Intersections The Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad intersected the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad near Lightstreet. The Susquehana, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad intersected another railroad in Eyers Grove. The railroad had stations in Watsontown, McEwensville, Warrior Run, Turbotville, Schuyler, Ottawa, Washingtonville, Derry, Jerseytown, Eyers Grove, Millville, Buckhorn, Paper Mill, Lightstreet, Bloomsburg, Cabin Run, Fowlersville, Dennis Mills, and Berwick. Financial information In 1908, the total assets of the Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad company were $1,826,856.48. The Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad, then known as the Wilkes-Barre and Western Railroad was sold in 1902. Some months later in 1902 the railroad was sold again, and this time renamed the Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick railroad. In 1905, the total cost of the Susquehanna, Bloomsburg and Berwick Railroad was $1,672,118.13. Between 1910 and 1916, the net income of the railroad ranged from $7342 in 1915 to $159,159 in 1916. Their gross revenue between 1910 and 1916 ranged from $108,687 in 1915 to $320,072 in 1916. The company's capital stock consisted of $1,000,000 in the form of $50 shares. Course The Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad started in Watsontown, and, passing through Jerseytown, Mordansville. From Mordansville, the railroad went down the Little Fishing Creek river valley, then turned east to cross Fishing Creek. The route also passed through Lightstreet and Briar Creek before terminating in Berwick. The Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad had two branch lines. One of them went from Eyers Grove to Millville and the other went from Eyers Grove to Orangeville. Uses When the Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad was first built in 1887, it was intended to be used for the anthracite fields on the North Branch and West Branch Susquehanna River. Starting in 1902, the Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad carried most of the cars manufactured by Berwick's American Car and Foundry Company to their owners. Despite usually running only six days a week, trains would sometimes go along the railroad on Sundays to the Bloomsburg fairgrounds and picnic grounds at Eyers Grove. These runnings of trains were termed \\"Special Sunday excursions\\". In the 21st century, the remaining part of the railroad is used to provide service to the Pennsylvania Power and Light plant.

E. Raht, c. 1870 Julius Eckhardt Raht (June 26, 1826 ‚Äì August 15, 1879) was a mining engineer, entrepreneur, and businessman who pioneered the mining and smelting of copper in the Copper Basin in Eastern Tennessee and reputedly became the richest man in the state. Raht was born in Dillenburg, Duchy of Nassau (today a town in the Lahn-Dill-Kreis in the state of Hesse, Germany). The son of an appellate judge, Raht attended the University of Bonn, 1844-45, and then the University of Berlin, 1845-47, where he studied \\"chemistry, mineralogy, etc. etc.\\"R. E. Barclay, Ducktown Back in Raht's Time (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1946), 186. After the failed German revolution of 1848, Raht immigrated to the United States in 1850 and became a citizen in 1853.Duncan Maysilles, Ducktown Smoke: The Fight over One of the South's Greatest Environmental Disasters (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 2011), 32; Barclay, 186. Eventually three of his brothers also made their way to the United States, including the noted architect Edward E. Raht. Raht worked for short periods in Missouri, Dubuque, Iowa, and Wisconsin before taking charge of mining at Harpers Ferry, Leesburg, and Jamestown, Virginia, and Guilford County, North Carolina.Barclay, 187. By 1854, he decided that the best opportunity to make his fortune lay in the copper mining industry near Ducktown, Tennessee, in the extreme southeastern corner of the state. After a brief trip to Germany to marry Mithilde Dombois, Raht became \\"captain\\" of a mining operation. Six years later he was chief of operations of all the mines and smelting works at Ducktown and had already purchased a farm and mule teams for copper hauling. He also engaged in what was to become his most profitable enterprise, running commissaries for the miners.Barclay, 189-91. In 1859 he bought a slave named Edom, who was sold with a mule team, but Raht soon freed him. As his biographer has written, Raht was \\"spirited, methodical, ambitious, honest...no less a stern taskmaster in his own behalf than he was a loyal employee of those in whose interests he served.\\" Soon he was wealthy enough to lend money to his erstwhile employers.Barclay, 190-91. Early in the Civil War, the Confederate government effectively confiscated the Ducktown mines. Raht at first continued to operate them in an attempt to protect the investments of the owners in New York and New Orleans; but in 1863, after he was forced to purchase a Confederate army substitute and Federal troops destroyed the rail facilities and copper rolling mill in nearby Cleveland, Raht crossed the lines to live out the remainder of the war in Cincinnati, where there was a significant German community.Barclay, 87-96, 193. Following the war, Raht once again operated the Ducktown mines, personally financing much of the necessary repairs, but he maintained his home and office in Cleveland. He founded the Cleveland National Bank and became manager of the Ocoee Turnpike and Plank Road Co., a transportation route needed to move copper to the nearest railroad. Raht had hidden some copper in the mines during the war, and he managed to produce more than a million pounds of copper during the first year of peace.Maysilles, 33 He also built new smelters using innovative methods developed by his brothers, including steam engines and diamond and compressed air drills. Nevertheless, falling copper prices, lower quality ore, and the lack of a rail connection culminated in the temporary closing of the mines in 1878.Mining Hall of Fame; Maysilles, 33. When the railroad reached Ducktown in 1890, more than a decade after Raht's death, the mines were reopened. As the local mining industry was dying, shareholders of the United Consolidated Mining Company unsuccessfully sued Raht believing that his great wealth must have been created from their loss.Barclay, 170-84. \\"The truth was much simpler. He made his fortune legally by running a commissary business to supply food and sundries to the miners, and then by making shrewd investments of his profits throughout Ducktown and eastern Tennessee.\\"Maysilles, 35. Raht and his wife had twelve children, six sons and two daughters surviving to maturity. Raht made numerous donations to charitable causes, especially churches and schools. Officially a Republican, he was \\"more interested in politics as a science of attaining desired ends than in politics as the term is more commonly understood.\\"Barclay, 229, 244. Though a nominal Lutheran, he was not a church goer.Barclay, 243. A lover of the table, Raht's \\"voracious appetite transformed his stocky and powerful figure into one of commanding rotundity.\\" He died suddenly of a heart attack on August 15, 1879.Barclay, 247. Two months earlier he had boasted in a letter of his good health and expressed concern about the poor health of his brother, August, who survived him by 38 years. Raht is buried in Fort Hill Cemetery, Cleveland.

The caf√© opened in 1899. The original interior was designed by renowned architect Adolf Loos. The caf√© became a meeting place for Viennese artists.  Location  The caf√© is situated on the ground floor of the corner Friedrichstra√üe 6 / Operngasse 7 in the first district in Vienna, Austria. The following places are close by: Naschmarkt, Karlsplatz, St. Charles‚Äôs Church, Secession Building, Academy of Fine Arts. History Caf√© Museum in the 1930s (original furnishings by Josef Zotti) Caf√© Museum was established in a building designed in 1872 by Otto Thienemann. Ludwig Frisch, who opened the caf√© in 1899, chose the name referring to the Caf√© zum Museum, which is located next to Kunsthistorisches Museum. The furnishings of the caf√© were influenced by the simple and sober style, which was expressed with bentwood chairs made by the firm Gebr√ºder Thonet. In view of this, Ludwig Hevesi created the nickname Caf√© Nihilismus (caf√© nihilism) for the caf√©. Even the front is held in a very simple style ‚Äì nowadays you can only see the golden letters ‚ÄúCaf√© Museum‚Äù on a white background. At the beginning of the 1930s the architect Josef Zotti, a student of Josef Hoffmann, redesigned the caf√©. He installed lodges and half-round sofas with red pleather along the walls. Hence he created a living room atmosphere that stood in contrast to the earlier design. After the renovation in 2003, which reconstructed Loos‚Äô original design, some of the original items made by Zotti can be found in the Viennese Imperial Furniture Collection. The Loos-reconstruction was criticized for the lack of authenticity and the uncomfortable furnishings. The cafe was again remodeled in 2003 and no longer retains the interior as designed by Adolf Loos. At the end of 2009, Caf√© Museum was closed until its operation was resumed by Irmgard and Berndt Querfeld in the summer of 2010.  Details  Metallic lamp in the Caf√© Museum = Interior furnishing = Adolf Loos, architect of the caf√©¬¥s original furnishings, had the opinion that an architect had to focus on the functional aspects and not on the artistic ones. He concentrated on a very plain design for the Caf√© Museum, which was revolutionary in the time of its opening. When the caf√© was renovated in 2010, the architect Peter Schwarz followed the original design of Josef Zotti. The half-round sofas are not covered with red pleather as in the original Zotti-design but with red velvet. Also the metal lamps made out of chromium-nickel steel, which reflect the interior of the caf√©, were restored. The light source is inside of the globe, which has an aperture at the top. The light is reflected by the smaller half globe that is attached to the ceiling above the lamp. Nowadays the caf√© can seat 207 guests. = Coffee House Readings = The Caf√© Museum offers regular readings since October 2011. The authors, who have held readings, include Daniel Glattauer, Christine N√∂stlinger, Franzobel, Lisa Lercher, Armin Thurnher, Susanne Scholl, Gerhard Loibelsberger and Elfriede Hammerl.  Famous Guests  Regular guests of the caf√© in the early twentieth century included Peter Altenberg, Joseph Schmidt, Richard Tauber, Alban Berg, Hermann Broch, Elias Canetti, Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, Karl Kraus, Franz Leh√°r, Robert Musil, Leo Perutz, Joseph Roth, Roda Roda, Egon Schiele, Georg Trakl, Otto Wagner, Franz Werfel and Ernst Jandl.

The document labeled 4Q186, was known as \\"Astrological Physiognomies\\" or \\"Horoscopes\\".  Astrological characteristics  Although 4Q186 is not a horoscope in the Greek sense, it has horoscopic characteristics. Vermes' translation of 4Q186 describes different parts of its subject \\"him\\" as in light and in darkness, which determines some characteristics of physiognomy, based on the astrology during an individual's birth (in this case relating to Taurus). This light and darkness could be explained by the location of Taurus above or below the horizon at the moment of birth.  Parts  The zodiac nature of the horoscope can only be inferred through \\"in the foot of the bull\\" in the text and then applying zodiacal thought from other sources. This phrase can then be understood through possible Greek zodiacal sources, such as Teukros. This form of interpreting the text does not use the typical locations of the sun, moon and planets as in modern horoscopes. Rather, Qumran physiognomies utilizes the location, as mentioned before, of different \\"parts\\" of Taurus (see Teukros) on or above the horizon. Therefore, a man born with more parts of the zodiac sign above the horizon (or in the light), is good, and with more parts below the horizon (or in the darkness) is bad. The first subject of 4Q186 therefore, will be \\"meek\\" (in other words, good) because he has \\"six parts in the House of Light and three in the Pit of Darkness,\\" while the second subject has \\"eight (parts) in the House of Darkness\\" and is therefore \\"very wicked.\\" These predictions about their \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\"ness are therefore physiognomies.

He previously played for the San Diego Padres. Jankowski attended Stony Brook University and played college baseball for the Stony Brook Seawolves, leading Stony Brook to a Cinderella appearance in the 2012 College World Series during his junior season. Jankowski was selected by the Padres in the first round of the 2012 MLB draft, becoming Stony Brook's first-ever first-round draft pick. After five seasons with the Padres, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds. Amateur career Jankowski graduated from Lancaster Catholic High School in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 2009. He enrolled at Stony Brook University. As a sophomore for the Stony Brook Seawolves baseball team in 2011, Jankowski earned first-team All-America East Conference honors after hitting .355, setting a school record for stolen bases and going the entire season without an error. That summer, Jankowski was invited to play for the Bourne Braves, where he led the Cape Cod Baseball League in hits, runs, and triples, earning league most valuable player honors. In 2012, Jankowski had a breakout junior year, breaking his previous school record for stolen bases and setting single- season school records in batting average (.414), hits (110), runs (79), and triples (11). In leading the Seawolves to their first ever College World Series appearance, Jankowski earned First Team All-American and America East Player of the Year honors. In 2017, Jankowski was inducted into the Stony Brook Hall of Fame. Professional career=San Diego Padres= Jankowski was drafted in the first round of the 2012 MLB draft by the San Diego Padres with the 44th overall pick. He became Stony Brook's highest-ever draft pick and the highest draft pick out of the America East Conference since Northeastern's Carlos Pe√±a was taken 10th overall in 1998. He was signed by the Padres' Northeast Scouting Director, Jim Bretz. After just two games with the AZL Padres, he was promoted to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the Padres' Class A affiliate, for the remainder of the 2012 season. With the TinCaps, Jankowski hit .282 with 17 stolen bases in 59 games. He spent the 2013 season with the Class A-Advanced Lake Elsinore Storm where he batted .286/.356/.355 with one home run, 38 RBIs, and 71 stolen bases in 122 games. Jankowski began the 2014 as the center fielder for the Double-A San Antonio Missions, but he broke his wrist in a collision with the outfield fence in April. He returned in July with the Rookie League club and worked his way back to the Missions over the season. Jankowski again began 2015 with the Missions, but was promoted to the Triple-A El Paso Chihuahuas in July. He batted .335 with one home runs, 25 RBIs, and a .413 on-base percentage between the two clubs while playing center field. Jankowski was promoted to the Padres from the Chihuahuas on August 19, 2015. He replaced Will Venable who had been traded to the Texas Rangers the previous day. As the starting center fielder in his MLB debut in a 9-3 win over the St. Louis Cardinals at Petco Park on August 21, Jankowski singled off John Lackey in each of his first two plate appearances, drove in a run with his second hit and scored on Yangervis Solarte's two-run fifth-inning homer. He is the first Stony Brook Seawolves position player in the MLB and was the first Padre since Tony Gwynn to record at least two hits and a RBI in his big- league debut. Jankowski played 34 games with the Padres in 2015, including 21 starts in center and six starts in right, and hit .211 with two home runs. Jankowski made the Padres 25-man roster out of spring training in 2016 and was mostly used early in the year as a late-inning defensive replacement and pinch-hitter, recording only 62 plate appearances before June 19. On that date, regular center fielder Jon Jay suffered a fractured forearm, sending him to the disabled list. Jankowski then became the Padres regular center fielder until the late September call up of Manuel Margot. Jankowski stole home plate twice within the month of August 2016. His first came when Wil Myers was caught in a rundown between first and second base at the back end of a double steal attempt in the eighth inning of a 7-3 home victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on August 1. An initial ruling of fielder's choice was changed to a stolen base the following day. Jankowski stole home again when he broke for the plate on Eric Fryer's return throw to Antonio Bastardo in the eighth inning of a 4-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park on August 10. Jankowski finished the 2016 season with a .245/.332/.313 batting line and 30 stolen bases in 131 games played, including 82 starts. Jankowski was the Padres Opening Day left fielder in 2017, but he fouled a ball off his foot on April 14, resulting in what was initially diagnosed as a deep bone bruise. After trying to play through the injury, he was eventually diagnosed with a hairline fracture and moved to the disabled list on April 24. Jankowski began a rehab assignment in July and was activated and optioned to El Paso in August, as Jos√© Pirela had taken over in left field for the Padres. Jankowski returned to the big league club after the Chihuahuas ended their playoff run in mid-September. Hampered by the injury early in the year, he finished 2017 with a .187 average in 87 Major League plate appearances, and a .268/.358/.325 line for 179 plate appearances in the minors. Jankowski began the 2018 season with El Paso, but was recalled to the Padres at the end of April when Wil Myers joined Hunter Renfroe on the disabled list. Jankowski had a breakout May, making 21 starts in the outfield while moving into the lead-off role and ending the month with a .305 average and .371 on-base percentage. He credited his batting coaches with a new approach at the plate that lowered his strikeouts. Jankowski stayed with the Padres for the rest of the year as a fourth outfielder and defensive replacement, making 29 starts in right field, 27 starts in center, and 22 starts in left, and appearing in a total of 117 games. At the plate, he batted .259 with a .332 on-base percentage and 4 home runs, setting or matching career highs. He stole a team-high 24 bases at a 77% success rate. =Cincinnati Reds= On October 31, 2019, the Padres traded Jankowski to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for international bonus slot money.https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2019/10/reds-acquire-travis- jankowski.html On October 14, 2020, Jankowski was outrighted off of the 40-man roster.https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2020/10/reds-outright-four-to- triple-a.html Personal life Jankowski and his wife, Lindsay, were married in 2017.

Michael and his brother Robert Budi are the owners of kretek (clove cigarette) manufacturer Djarum, which they inherited from their father Oei Wie Gwan upon his death in 1963. Growing the business to a large conglomerate including Bank Central Asia, electronics, plantations and various properties, they became the richest in the country with Michael himself having a net worth in excess of $10 billion. Early life Michael Hartono was born on 2 October 1939, in the town of Kudus, in Central Java. His father, Oei Wie Gwan, had purchased a small Kretek cigarette factory called Djarum Gramophon (lit: Gramophone needle) in April 1951, and renamed it to just Djarum. In 1963, however, the factory burned down and shortly thereafter Oie Wie died, leaving Michael and his younger brother Robert Budi Hartono to inherit the factory. After completing his highschool in Kudus, Michael studied in the faculty of economics and business at Diponegoro University starting 1959, but returned to Kudus upon his father's death. Career The cigarette company grew under the two brothers, making its first export in 1972 and introducing new products. Today, the cigarette brand is one of the largest in Indonesia, with a 19 percent market share in 2012. As the cigarette business continued to grow, the group began expanding to other fields, founding an electronics brand Polytron in 1975. The group also expanded into businesses like palm oil, papermaking and communication towers. Starting their entry into the banking business through Haga Bank and Hagakita Bank, the brothers under the Mauritius-registered corporation FarIndo Investments in a consortium with Farallon Capital took over 51.15% of Bank Central Asia in 2002, defeating other bidders despite making a lower offer. While initially only holding less than 10% stake in the consortium, Djarum held a 92.18% stake in the consortium by 2006, though the Haga and Hagakita Banks were sold to Rabobank. After a Rp 3.45 trillion deal with UBS in 2010, the brothers controlled a majority of the company's shares. The shares were transferred to an Indonesian holding company PT Dwimuria Investama Andalan in 2016 during a tax amnesty program. As of September 2017, the company was jointly held by Michael and Robert, and possessed a 54.94% stake in BCA. Aside from the aforementioned businesses, the Djarum group also controls several shopping malls and buildings in Jakarta, including Grand Indonesia, Hotel Indonesia and BCA Tower.

Career From 1990 until 1992 Kane (as Silvana Petrozzi) was a member of Canadian pop band West End Girls. After extensive travels throughout Europe and a stint in Toronto, Kane finally settled back in Vancouver. It was there that she reconnected with former high school-bandmate Adam Popowitz and formed Pacifika. A few years later Kane and Popowitz were joined by Toby Peter. The band‚Äôs one requirement was that all their music needed to have a ‚Äúpositive vibe‚Äù. The trio have released two albums under Six Degrees Records: Asuncion (2008) and Supermagique (2010). Kane‚Äôs solo debut, La Jardinera (2012), pays tribute to the South American musical heroes of her youth.

They chose a two-funnelled, four-masted steel passenger-cargo liner of about , which was laid down in 1886 with the provisional name Nulli Secunda (\\"Second to none\\"). For about a year the builders tried to find a buyer until, believing that she would be bought by Canadian Pacific Steamships for their new route between Vancouver, British Columbia and the Far East, they named her Trans-Pacific; she was launched by the Mayoress of Sunderland with that name on 8 February 1887, even though by then negotiations with Canadian Pacific had not been concluded. Some time after the launch, British India Steam Navigation Company (B.I.) became interested, to upgrade their London- Calcutta service. They required considerable alterations to meet their service, which were not finished until October 1888. Golconda was registered at Glasgow on 25 September 1888 and allocated British Official Number 95098 and signal letters K.V.C.G. Completed as Golconda, she measured and , with registered length of , a beam of and depth of . She was powered by a single 550nhp/4360ihp triple-expansion steam engine, also made by Doxfords, that drove a single screw propeller, giving her a trial speed of . The ship had cabin capacity for 80 1st-class and 28 2nd-class passengers, and could carry about 6000 tons of cargo. British India Line service After prelinary loading in the Tyne and at Antwerp, Golconda sailed from London on 19 October 1888 on her maiden voyage to Calcutta. She had an inauspicious start, suffering engine damage after leaving London, putting in to Spithead to undertake repairs and not leaving there until 27 October. Thereafter she traded successfully on the Calcutta route for 12 years; her low passenger capacity for her size was popular with travellers and the accommodation was more spacious than was usual. She suffered only two minor casualties: a small fire in December 1890 and was rammed by the Liverpool iron barque Lathom two years later, both in the Hooghly River, but was only lightly damaged. In 1900 Golconda was chartered as a troopship during the Boer War, sailing from London to Malta on 3 January 1900 with nearly 1000 troops of the Royal West Kent Regiment. Taken up again, in August 1902 she brought 500 Boer prisoners to Durban from Calcutta, and then carried 900 returning troops to Southampton. This was followed by 1000 Boer prisoners from St Helena to Simonstown and troops from Durban to Ceylon. Returning to her regular London-Calcutta service, Golconda was gradually outclassed by more modern vessels in the B.I. fleet and was transferred to the company's East African service. Indian Expeditionary Force transport In October 1915 Golconda was again taken up as a transport, for the Indian Expeditionary Force. In addition, six hundred German civilian internees from the camp in Ahmednagar were transported to London, from where they were repatriated via the Netherlands. A further group of five hundred Germans were repatriated in a similar way in March 1916. Loss Golconda struck a mine laid by German submarine UC 3, and sank in the North Sea on 3 June 1916, south east by east of Aldeburgh, Suffolk () with the loss of nineteen lives. She was lost while on a voyage from Tees and London to Calcutta with general cargo.

Kernel Approximations for Efficient SVMs (and other feature extraction methods). Typically, these take the form of a function z that maps a single vector to a vector of higher dimensionality, approximating the kernel: :\\\\langle z(\\\\mathbf{x}), z(\\\\mathbf{x'}) \\\\rangle \\\\approx \\\\langle \\\\varphi(\\\\mathbf{x}), \\\\varphi(\\\\mathbf{x'}) \\\\rangle = K(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{x'}) where \\\\textstyle\\\\varphi is the implicit mapping embedded in the RBF kernel. One way to construct such a z is to randomly sample from the Fourier transformation of the kernel.Ali Rahimi and Benjamin Recht (2007). \\"Random features for large- scale kernel machines\\". Neural Information Processing Systems. Another approach uses the Nystr√∂m method to approximate the eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix K, using only a random sample of the training set.

It was built under the direction of legendary surveyor Len Beadell as part of a network of roads for the Weapons Research Establishment at Woomera, South Australia. It is located approximately west of Alice Springs. History Following construction of the Gunbarrel Highway (completed in 1958), Beadell and the Gunbarrel Road Construction Party were tasked to survey and build a road connecting it with a proposed east-west road some further north. The requirement was related to future National Mapping Council surveys for the Woomera Rocket Range. On 31 March 1960, Beadell selected a stand of desert oak trees south-east of Giles as the commencement point for the road. From there the road steered north-east past Schwerin Mural Crescent (named by Ernest Giles in 1874) then veered north towards Walter James Range. When examining this area Beadell discovered a small rock basin containing crystal- clear water, Bungabiddy (or Pangkupirri) Rock Hole. He ensured that his new road passed close by the water hole for the benefit of future travellers. A problem confronting Beadell was to find a way around Lake Hopkins, a large salt lake consisting of many muddy patches linked by narrow connections. His preference was to head north-east towards Sir Frederick Range, but after much trial and error, he was forced to the west, and it took until mid May to bypass the obstacle. On reaching Sir Frederick Range, Beadell had his team bulldoze a side track to the highest point as access to the site for a future Trig station. Just beyond this point, Beadell discovered a series of Aboriginal petroglyphs on a smooth rock surface located in a creek bed. Neatly carved spirals, concentric circles, shapes of animal and bird tracks were revealed to him, the only ones of this type he had seen. The track then veered to the east, passed south of further obstacles (Lake Macdonald and Bonython Range) and headed towards Davenport Hills. It was on this section that the border between Western Australia and the Northern Territory was crossed. Beadell determined the latitude and longitude using his theodolite for astronomical observations, and marked the border with four desert oak poles and associated aluminium plates on 10 June. Construction of the track continued past Davenport Hills (22 June) and the Tropic of Capricorn (25 June), which was marked with a pole and aluminium plate. The team arrived at Mt Leisler on 29 June. Beadell had spent some time near Mt Leisler looking for a tree which had been blazed by the explorer William Tietkens in May 1889, and when he discovered its position, made the road pass nearby, marking the location with his trademark signpost. By 4 July the road had passed the northern end of Kintore Range to the present position of a T-junction with the future east-west Gary Junction Road, and continued north for another . Up until then, the road was simply known as the north road, and on 7 July work was halted while Beadell was recalled to Adelaide. During his trip to rejoin the crew he was smitten with a severe eye ailment known as Sandy blight (Trachoma). Despite concerted efforts by the doctor and padre at Woomera to persuade him to rest, he continued on. The condition caused him great difficulty with star observations, so he decided that the T-junction would be called Sandy Blight Junction. On 27 August 1960, the precise location of the junction was fixed, and the name Sandy Blight Junction Road came into general use. The section to the north was never used. As soon as it was finished, Beadell and team began work on their next assignment, the Gary Junction Road. Points of interest The Sandy Blight Junction Road is considered to be one of the most picturesque tracks in outback Australia, and was Beadell's favourite. Its present-day southern terminus is west of Kaltukatjara (Docker River) and east of Warakurna Community (Giles). The original start point has been bypassed by more recent construction of the Great Central Road. Beadell placed eleven signposts and one large rock (200 mile mark) at significant points along the road. Most of the signs have since been replaced with replicas, as many original plates have been taken as souvenirs. At Bungabiddy rockhole (of which there were two pools) he was unable to touch the bottom when in the water, so he presumed that it was deep enough to be permanent water. Beadell may have thought he was the first European to sight this feature, but a notorious dingo bounty hunter named Paddy de Conlay had carved his name and the date \\"1936\\" on a rock nearby. During a reconnaissance in the Davenport Hills vicinity, Beadell sighted an animal he had never seen before. He was a fairly accomplished artist, so when he returned to his Land Rover, he drew a sketch of the animal from memory. When the sketch was shown to zoologists later, the animal was instantly recognised as the Black-footed Rock-wallaby, Petrogale lateralis. The dirt road can be heavily corrugated, there are no food or fuel facilities along the track, but there is a bore water hand pump available for passing travellers. A turnoff to the community of Tjukurla is marked by a giant stiletto shoe, brightly painted in indigenous motifs by local artists. Tietkens' blazed tree is visible near Mt. Leisler, however it has fallen over. When Beadell rediscovered the tree in 1960, it was still standing with leaves on its branches. Just east of Kintore Range near Sandy Blight Junction, Beadell discovered a pile of huge granite boulders, reminiscent of the Devils Marbles south of Tennant Creek. Photographs he took appear in his book Beating About the Bush. The nearest available fuel to the southern end is at Kaltukatjara (Docker River) on the Great Central Road, and to the north is at Kintore near Sandy Blight Junction. Two permits are required to travel on the road, one for the Western Australian section and one for the Northern Territory section, with prescribed travel conditions for both. Additionally, a permit is required for travel on the Great Central Road.

He was commissioned to paint Confederate Civil War battle scenes and murals. At times Ruple lived in Arkansas and Oklahoma where he traveled to study American Indians and early settlement in the Midwest.‚ÄùHuge Painting Depicts Run Into Oklahoma,‚Äù Tulsa Daily World, March 20, 1932‚ÄùPainting Depicting ‚ÄòRun‚Äù To Be Presented State,‚Äù The Daily Oklahoman, Sunday, March 20, 1932 The Oklahoma Land Run of 1889 inspired Ruple to create his most famous painting \\"The Spirit of '89\\". As a painter, Ruple took commission jobs that came from builders and decorators who hired him to paint murals and designs on public buildings. The work he did along these lines was among the most prominent in America.  Early life  Frederick Ruple was born on September 19, 1871 in Unterhallau, a part of Hallau, in the canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland. His parents were butcher Hermann Rupli and Barbara Neukomm. Hermann Rupli wandered off to America without his family on May 24, 1872.\\"Dr. phil. Roland E. Hofer, Staatsarchivar, according to Familienregister Der Gemeinde Hallau, volume 3, page 238, State Archives Schaffhausen, Switzerland\\" Hermann and Barbara were divorced on November 12, 1874 according to Schaffhausen court records. Frederick was 3 years old at that time. Frederick's mother relocated to Basel in 1885, when Frederick was 14 years old. Barbara Neukomm was registered in the address book of Basel in 1885 at the address Mattweg 53rd, from 1886 to 1891. She worked as a housekeeper at the address 30 Greifengasse, Basel.\\"Staatsarchiv Basel-Stadt,\\" Pr√§sidialdepartement, Martinsgasse 2, CH 4001 Basel, www.staatsarchiv.bs.ch When Frederick Ruple was 14 he became an apprentice to an artificial limb manufacturer.\\"Frederick Ruple will be buried here Wednesday,\\" South West American, May 25, 1938 In the summer of 1887, he attended the General school.

In 1891, at age 19, Ruple immigrated with his mother to America. Around this time, his last name changed from Rupli to Ruple. In the United States he first lived with his mother's sister in Cincinnati. During this time, an art dealer saw his drawings and ordered a copy of a photograph in colors, which was the first such piece of work sold in that country. Ruple, while still a young man, moved to Little Rock to become the prot√©g√© of Mrs. James P. Eagle, wife of the state's governor at the time, and his work of painting portraits began. Governor Eagle, General Forest and other prominent men of the state sat for him.  Personal life  After three years in America he married Almira C. King on December 25, 1894 in Belmont, Ohio. Almira was born June 1873, in West Virginia. The 1900 U.S. Federal Census stated that Frederick (28) and Almira (26) lived in Lonoke, Arkansas; had been married for six years; and had a three-year-old son, Frederick D. Ruple. The boy was born on November 6, 1897 in New York in Cincinnati, Ohio. The 1910 stated that Frederick and Almira had 2 sons and a daughter: Frederick D. (13 and born in Ohio); George W. (6 and born in Arkansas); and Almira C. (3 years old and born in Pennsylvania) living in their home in Ruddell township, Independence, Arkansas. The 1920 Census stated that the couple were renting a home in Batesville, Independence, Arkansas. An obituary in Southwest Times Record on March 7, 1925 reported that Almira (Mollie) (King) Ruple died March 5, 1925 in her home at 600 South 2 Twenty-First Street, while her family survived. The 1930 stated that Frederick was by then married to Mildred Ruple (age 31), and that they lived with their son Robert Ruple (2) and daughter Mary Louise (six months) in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Fred and Myra also lived with them. Frederick had his Fayetteville studio on the public square, along with a private painting school. Many of his paintings hung in private homes. Mary Louise attended Helen Dunlop Memorial School at Winslow before attending the University of Arkansas. George died from tuberculosis on September 13, 1934. In 1936, Frederick Ruple resided at 2647 N Norfolk avenue in Tulsa, OK, and by 1938 he lived at 1505 S Columbia, Tulsa, OK, where he battled with poor health and died from a heart attack on May 23, 1938, in his house.

Stages of threat vary along a spectrum referred to as the \\"predatory imminence continuum\\", spanning from low-risk (pre-encounter) to high-risk (interaction) threats.Fanselow MS, Lester LS (1988) A functional behavioristic approach to aversively motivated behavior: Predatory imminence as a determinant of the topography of defensive behavior. In Evolution and Learning. Bolles RC, Beecher MD, Eds,; Earlbaum, Hillsdale NJ:185-211. The main assumption of the predatory imminence continuum is that as threat levels increase, defensive response strategies change. During the pre-encounter period, an animal may engage in activities like exploration or foraging. But if the animal senses that a predator is nearby, the animal may begin to express species specific defense reactions such as freezing in an attempt to avoid detection by the predator. However, in situations where a threat is imminent, once the animal is detected by its predator, freezing may no longer be the optimal behaviour for survival. At this point, the animal enters the circa-strike phase, where its behaviour will transition from passive freezing to active flight, or even attack if escape is not possible.  Development  The development of the predatory imminence continuum began with the description of species-specific defence reactions. Species-specific defence reactions are innate responses demonstrated by an animal when they experience a threat. Since survival behaviours are so vital for an animal to acquire and demonstrate rapidly, it has been theorized that these defence reactions would not have time to be learned and therefore, must be innate. While these behaviours are species-specific, there are three general categories of defence reactions - fleeing, freezing, and threatening. Species-specific defence reactions are now recognized as being organized in a hierarchical system where different behaviours are exhibited, depending on the level of threat experienced. However, when this concept was first proposed, the dominant species-specific defence reaction in a certain context was thought to be controlled by operant conditioning. That is, if a species- specific defence reaction was unsuccessful in evading or controlling conflict, the hierarchical system would be rearranged because of the punishment, in the form of failure, experienced by an animal. It would then be unlikely for that species-specific defence reaction to be used in a similar situation again; instead, an alternative behaviour would be dominant. However, if the dominant behaviour was successful it would remain the recurring behaviour for that situation. After experimentation, this theory was met with much opposition, even by the person who proposed it. One point of opposition was found through the use of shock on rats and the species-specific defence reaction of freezing. This experiment found that while punishment did seem to affect freezing, it was not through response weakening but through the evoking of different levels of the behaviour. Other criticisms for this theory focused on the inability for species-specific defence reactions to effectively rearrange in this manner in natural situations. It has been argued that there would not be enough time for punishment, in the form of an animal being unsuccessful in its defence, to reorder the hierarchy of species-specific defence reactions. The rejection of the operant conditioning mechanism for the reorganization of species-specific defence reactions, led to the development of the predatory imminence continuum. The organization of defensive behaviours can be attributed to the level of threat an animal perceives itself to be in. This theory is one of adaptiveness, as the dominant defence reaction is the behaviour which is most effective in allowing the survival of the animal and the one which is most effective in preventing an increasing level of threat, also known as increasing imminence. The probability of being killed by a predator, known as predatory imminence, is what is responsible for the expressed defensive behaviour. The predatory imminence is dependent on many factors such as the distance from a predator, the potential for escape, and the likelihood of meeting a predator. Three general categories of defensive behaviours, based on increasing predatory imminence, have been identified. These are labelled as pre-encounter, post-encounter, and circa-strike defensive behaviours.  Stages of threat = Pre-encounter = Behaviours exhibited by animals when the threat of a predator is extremely low are known as preferred activity patterns. When the likelihood of predation increases above this point an animal enters into pre-encounter defensive behaviours. These behaviours are used to reduce the probability of having to exhibit avoidance behaviours, which are evoked when a predator is detected. Pre- encounter behaviours can be observed when an animal has left the safety of its residence to perform tasks such as mating or foraging, and occur before a predator has been identified. The animal does not perform these behaviours because of a predator, instead these behaviours are performed or altered depending on the probability of being detected by a predator when executing a task. One well studied example of a pre-encounter behaviour is that of varying meal frequency and size seen in foraging rats. When rats forage they do not typically hoard food, instead they either ingest the food where it was found or retreat to a nearby safe space to consume their meal. Depending on the level of perceived threat, a rat will vary the frequency of foraging and the size of its meal. In laboratory studies investigating this pre-encounter behaviour, density of shocks are often used to represent the risk of predation. A number of shocks are administered daily on a random schedule, the more shocks administered per day the higher the perceived predatory imminence. The shocks only affect the rats when they are outside of their safe nest area, but to get food they have to leave this area and press a lever to dispense their meal. This models the real-life situation of a rat needing to leave the relative safety of its nest to go foraging for food. The common finding is that, as the perceived threat of predation increases, the frequency of foraging decreases but the size of the consumed meal increases. The increased meal size ensures that even though the rat leaves the safe area in search of food less often, it still consumes a relatively constant amount of food each day, regardless of shock density. This organized modulation of foraging behaviour is consistent with a pre-encounter defensive behaviour. The frequency and meal size associated with foraging are reorganized depending on the perceived level of threat but they are not directly influenced by the interaction with a predator. = Post-encounter = Post-encounter defensive behaviours are avoidance behaviours performed when a predator is present and has been detected. When this stage of threat has been reached, behaviours are limited to species-specific defence reactions. These behaviours are commonly freezing, fleeing or threatening. The goal of a post-encounter defensive behaviour is to prevent the predatory imminence from further increasing. The dominant post-encounter defensive behaviour can depend on whether the predator has also detected the prey and how far away the two animals are from one another. Varying levels of predatory imminence, even in post-encounter situations, can affect the expressed defensive behaviour. If the prey has yet to be detected, the goal of the post-encounter behaviour will be to prevent the predator from detecting the prey. If both the predator and prey have detected each other, the goal will be to avoid making contact with the predator. Freezing behaviour in rats is an example of a post-encounter defensive behaviour which has been well studied. Freezing in rats is characterized by sudden, extended immobility, followed by a decreased heart rate and an increased respiration rate. This behaviour is often the dominant post-encounter defence behaviour in rats. In the laboratory setting, post- encounter defensive behaviours can be elicited by pairing a neutral stimulus, such as a light, with an aversive stimulus, such as a shock. The rat will engage in its post-encounter defensive behaviour when it becomes aware of the neutral stimulus, as the stimulus is acting as a predictor for the shock. Since the freezing behaviour is dominant in these situations, it can be assumed that it serves an adaptive function by preventing an additional increase in predatory imminence. Freezing is the dominant post-encounter behaviour because even when there are alternative defensive reactions available, freezing has been observed to be the rat's response the majority of the time. Even when a clear method of escape was made available, rats would freeze instead of fleeing. Freezing can prevent the perceived level of threat from increasing in several ways. If a rat becomes aware of a predator before the predator is aware of the prey, freezing can reduce the likelihood that the prey will be detected. As well, since many predators rely on motion to keep track of their prey, freezing may cause the predator to either lose site of their prey or shift their attention to a more active object. = Circa-strike = When a predator is prepared to strike or has stricken, the prey's behaviours change from post-encounter to circa-strike defensive behaviours. These reactions are employed if the post-encounter behaviours are unsuccessful. A predator making contact with its prey is the highest level of predatory imminence experienced before being killed by a predator. Therefore, the goal of circa-strike behaviours are to survive and escape from the predator during or after contact. These defence behaviours are often more reactive than post-encounter behaviours and are commonly in the form of jumping, vocalizing, striking or biting. If the animal is successful in evading its predator then, when it has found a safe location, it will eventually return to its preferred activity patterns. One example of an extremely successful circa-strike defensive behaviour is the evasive leaping of the kangaroo rat. Kangaroo rats are desert dwelling mammals preyed upon by venomous sidewinder rattlesnakes. When rattlesnakes strike, kangaroo rats exhibit a quick and forceful circa-strike behaviour in the form of a leap using their hind legs. This leaping reaction serves several functions both to help escape and prevent envenomation. First, the kangaroo rat is able to jump within around 50ms after perceiving an incoming snake strike. This gives the rat the ability to avoid contact with the predator all together, thus allowing it to escape unharmed. If the leap is unsuccessful in completely avoiding the snake's strike, it still serves the purpose of preventing the fangs from embedding. The jumping action is so forceful that the rat may be able to disrupt the snake's striking movement. Finally, if all else fails and the fangs have made contact with the kangaroo rat, it is still able to employ its evasive leaping behaviour, and with the use of its hind legs, forcefully dislodge the snake's fangs and prevent envenomation. This leaping behaviour serves the function of preventing or escaping contact with a predator immediately before, during, or after an attack, therefore, it is consistent with a circa-strike defensive behaviour.

Prior to his election, he was the chairman of R8 Capital Partners and chairman of the private equity firm GTCR, based in Chicago. The Republican nominee in the 2014 Illinois gubernatorial election, he defeated Democratic incumbent Pat Quinn by 50.3% to 46.4%. In 2018, after narrowly surviving a challenge in the Republican primary from State Representative Jeanne Ives, Rauner lost the general election to Democratic challenger J. B. Pritzker in a landslide. Early life and education Bruce Rauner was born in Chicago and grew up in Deerfield, Illinois, a suburb 25 miles north of Chicago. His mother, Ann (n√©e Erickson) Rauner (1931‚Äì2011), was a nurse, and his father, Vincent Rauner (1927‚Äì1997), was a lawyer and senior vice president for Motorola. He has three siblings, Christopher, Mark, and Paula, and is of half Swedish and half German descent. After his parents divorced and his father remarried to the former Carol Kopay in 1981. Through his father's second marriage, he has a stepsister, Larisa Olson. His first job was as a paperboy. Rauner graduated summa cum laude with a degree in economics from Dartmouth College. He later received an MBA from Harvard University. Business career Rauner was the chairman of private equity firm GTCR, where he had worked for more than 30 years, starting in 1981 after his graduation from Harvard through his retirement in October 2012. A number of state pension funds, including those of Illinois, have invested in GTCR. In 2013, Rauner opened an office for a self-financed venture firm, R8 Capital Partners. The firm planned to invest up to $15 million in smaller Illinois companies. Rauner served as Chairman of Choose Chicago, the not-for-profit that is the city's convention and tourism bureau, resigning in May 2013, and as Chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund. Rauner has also served as the Chairman of the Education Committee of the Civic Committee of The Commercial Club of Chicago. In 2015, Rauner reported earning over $180 million. Political career Prior to his 2014 run for Illinois governor, Rauner served as an advisor to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. =2014 gubernatorial election= Governor Pat Quinn. Rauner's 2014 campaign logo In March 2013, Rauner formed an exploratory committee to look at a run for Governor of Illinois as a Republican. Rauner said that his top priorities included streamlining government, improving education, and improving the state's business climate. He supported term limits and said he would serve no more than eight years (two terms) as governor. On June 5, 2013, Rauner officially announced his candidacy for governor, telling Chicago magazine's Carol Felsenthal that his platform would include overhauling tax policy and freezing property taxes. In October 2013, Rauner announced that his running mate would be Wheaton City Councilwoman Evelyn Sanguinetti. Rauner won the March 18, 2014 Republican primary with 328,934 votes (40.13%), defeating State Senator Kirk Dillard, who received 305,120 votes (37.22%), State Senator Bill Brady (123,708 votes, 15.09%) and Illinois Treasurer Dan Rutherford's (61,848 votes, 7.55%). For the general election, Rauner was endorsed by the majority of Illinois newspapers,Merda, Chad (October 14, 2014) ‚Äì \\"Who's Winning the Endorsement Battle in Illinois?\\" . Chicago Sun-Times. Retrieved November 30, 2014. including the Chicago Tribune, the Daily Herald, and the Chicago Sun-Times. During the general election, television ads aired regarding Rauner's role in a chain of long-term care homes owned by his companies that faced lawsuits stemming from the death and alleged mistreatment of residents. Among the problems outlined in court cases, state records, and media reports were the deaths of developmentally disabled residents in bathtubs, \\"deplorable\\" living conditions, sexual assaults, and a failure by employees to stop residents from harming themselves. Also during the election, the media reported on a controversy regarding Rauner's daughter being admitted to Walter Payton Prep school in Chicago in 2008 through the \\"principal picks\\" process. The family maintains several residences, including one in downtown Chicago that enabled her to apply to the Chicago-based school. Although she had top grades, she had missed several days of school and therefore did not qualify through the regular admissions process. It was later revealed that Rauner had sought information on this process from his personal friend Arne Duncan, then CEO of Chicago Public Schools. Rauner has said he had no recollection of speaking with Duncan directly. According to another source, she was not a \\"principal pick\\", but was let in following the phone call between Bruce Rauner and Arne Duncan. The Rauners donated $250,000 to the school during the subsequent school year; Rauner has a long history of contributing to Chicago Public Schools. On October 22, 2014, Dave McKinney, a Chicago Sun-Times political reporter and bureau chief, resigned from the paper, citing pressure brought to bear on him by Sun-Times management with regard to his coverage of Rauner. McKinney had completed an investigative news story about a lawsuit filed by Christine Kirk, the CEO of LeapSource, a firm at which Rauner served as director. The piece, written by three reporters and approved by the newspaper's editors, described Rauner using \\"hardball tactics\\" to threaten Kirk and her family. According to McKinney's attorney, the Rauner campaign requested the story include that McKinney had a conflict of interest due to his marriage to Ann Liston, a Democratic media consultant; the campaign eventually published details about the Liston's LLC sharing office space with a legally separate, long-term Democratic strategist firm, of which Liston was part-owner. The LLC was employed by a pro-Quinn PAC. McKinney says any notion of conflict of interest was untrue, a position backed up publicly by Sun-Times management. Rauner is a former investor of the Sun-Times and received the newspaper's backing, marking the first time the media organization endorsed any candidate after imposing a moratorium on political endorsements three years earlier. On November 4, 2014, Rauner was elected Governor of Illinois; Pat Quinn conceded defeat the next day. Rauner received 50.27% of the vote, while Quinn won 46.35%. Rauner carried every county in the state except for Cook, home to Chicago. Rauner spent a record $26 million of his own money on his election. =2018 gubernatorial election= On June 20, 2016, Rauner confirmed that he would run for a second term; he formally announced his re-election campaign on October 23, 2017. In the Republican primary, Rauner faced State Representative Jeanne Ives, who ran against him from the political right. Rauner was endorsed by the Chicago Tribune, The Daily Herald, and the Chicago Sun-Times, and by 37 elected officials from DuPage County, part of which was represented by Ives. On March 20, 2018, Rauner narrowly won the Republican primary, with 51.4% of the vote; Ives received 48.6% of the vote. In the November general election, Rauner lost to Democratic nominee J. B. Pritzker; Pritzker received 54% of the vote while Rauner received 39%. It was the most lopsided margin in an Illinois gubernatorial race since Jim Edgar's bid for a second term in 1994. =Governor of Illinois= Rauner was sworn in as Governor of Illinois on January 12, 2015. In his first executive order, he halted state hiring as well as discretionary spending and called for state agencies to sell surplus property. The conflict between Rauner's demand for budget cuts and Speaker of the House Michael Madigan's demand for tax increases resulted in the Illinois Budget Impasse, with major credit agencies downgrading the state‚Äôs debt to the low investment grade of triple-B by the end of 2015. Governor Rauner's Proposed Budget Cuts to Higher Education On February 9, 2015, Rauner signed an executive order blocking so called \\"fair share\\" union fees from state employee paychecks. The same day, Rauner hired a legal team headed by former U.S. Attorney Dan Webb and his law firm Winston & Strawn to file a declaratory judgment action in Federal Court to affirm his action. In February 2015, Rauner proposed $4.1 billion in budget cuts affecting higher education, Medicaid, state employee pensions, public transit, and local government support. In April, Rauner also suspended funding for programs addressing domestic violence, homeless youth, autism, and immigrant integration. Critics called these moves \\"morally reprehensible\\" and harmful to the state economy. On June 25, 2015, Rauner vetoed the Illinois state budget passed by the legislature, which would have created a deficit of nearly $4 billion but which covered what Illinois Democratic lawmakers called \\"vital services\\". He stated that he would not sign a budget until the Democratic state legislature passed his \\"Turnaround Agenda\\" to reduce trade union power and freeze property taxes. With no state budget, social service agencies cut back on services, state universities laid off staff, public transit service ceased in Monroe and Randolph Counties, and Child Care Assistance eligibility was cut by 90%. On June 30, 2016, just before the beginning of the next fiscal year, Rauner signed a temporary bipartisan stopgap budget that would allow public schools to continue operating for an additional year and for necessary state services to continue for 6 months. However, the stopgap budget covered only 65% of social services agencies' normally allocated funds and provided $900,000 less for colleges and universities than FY15, while attempting to cover eighteen months' worth of expenses, all while continuing the uncertainty that Illinois nonprofits faced during FY16. In July 2017, Rauner vetoed a budget that increased the state income tax from 3.75% to 4.95% and the corporate tax from 5.25% to 7%, an increase of $5 billion in additional tax revenue. However, the Illinois legislature, with the help of several Republicans, overrode his veto. Following this action, considered a political defeat for Rauner, he made major changes to his staff; among others, he fired his chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, and spokesperson, and replaced them with high-ranking officials from the Illinois Policy Institute along with a former spokesperson for Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. These moves were seen by the media as a shift to the right. In August 2017, Rauner fired several of those new officials after they issued a controversial statement related to race. Political positions Rauner governed Illinois as a moderate or liberal Republican, as evidenced by his stances on abortion, same-sex marriage, and immigration, among other issues. =Education= Rauner had made a priority to fully funded education for the first time in years, increasing K-12 education funding by nearly $1 billion, and increasing early childhood education funding to historic levels. In 2017, Rauner signed Senate Bill 1947, which moved Illinois to an \\"evidence- based model\\" of education funding, taking into account each district's individual needs, as well as its local revenue sources, when appropriating state aid ‚Äì prioritizing districts that are furthest from being fully funded. The new law created a scholarship plan that earmarked up to $75 million for scholarship tax credits. Lawmakers said those credits would go to low- and middle-income parents, impacting roughly 6,000 private school students whose families make less than $73,000 per year. The new law created the first revision in two decades of the way general state-aid dollars to schools were distributed, establishing a multifaceted procedure for determining need and setting a goal for \\"adequacy\\" of funding in each of the state's 852 school districts. The bill received praise from the Chicago Tribune, Daily Herald, and Chicago Sun-Times, along with numerous civic organizations. =Unions= Rauner's stance on labor unions received considerable attention and controversy. Rauner said that local governments should be allowed to pass right to work laws. Additionally, Rauner said that the state should ban some political contributions by public unions, saying, \\"government unions should not be allowed to influence the public officials they are lobbying, and sitting across the bargaining table from, through campaign donations and expenditures\\". In 2014, Rauner's election campaign was helped financially by Kenneth C. Griffin, CEO of Citadel, a successful global investment firm, who made a rare and impassioned plea to the sold-out audience at the Economic Club of Chicago (ECC) in May 2013 to replace the Democrats at all levels of governance. He supported Rauner's campaign promises to \\"cut spending and overhaul the state's pension system, impose term limits, and weaken public employee unions\\". Griffin called for a show of financial support to Rauner that met with an increase in campaign donations representing tens of millions of dollars, or half the $65 million spent on Rauner's 2014 election campaign. Of this half, such money originated from Rauner himself along with \\"nine other individuals, families, or companies they control\\". =Minimum wage= Rauner received media attention for his political stance on the minimum wage. Rauner favored either raising the national minimum wage so Illinois employers were on the same level as those in neighboring states, or unilaterally raising Illinois' minimum wage, but pairing the change with pro-business reforms to the state's tax code, workers compensation reform, and tort reform. Rauner's position on the minimum wage changed significantly during his campaign. At a candidate forum on December 11, 2013, Rauner stated that he would favor reducing Illinois's minimum wage from $8.25 to the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The Chicago Sun-Times also uncovered video of Rauner at a campaign event in September 2013, where he said that he was \\"adamantly, adamantly against raising the minimum wage\\", and audio of an interview with Rauner from January 10, 2014, when he said: \\"I have said, on a number of occasions, that we could have a lower minimum wage or no minimum wage as part of increasing Illinois' competitiveness.\\" =Tax policy= Rauner strongly opposed Governor Pat Quinn's proposal to make the 2011 temporary income tax increase permanent, instead calling for the Illinois' income tax rate to gradually be rolled back to 3 percent. On January 1, 2015, the income tax increase automatically decreased, with the personal income tax rate falling from 5% to 3.75% and the corporate tax rate from 7% to 5.25%. In July 2014, Rauner called for expanding Illinois' sales tax to dozens of services, such as legal services, accounting services, and computer programming, which were not subject to the sales tax in Illinois. Rauner estimated the expanded sales tax would bring in an additional $600 million a year. Rauner's services tax proposal was harshly criticized by Quinn, who said it would fall hardest on low income people. Rauner opposed a graduated income tax. Rauner received a 92% approval from Taxpayers United for America, the first time a sitting Illinois governor received a score of more than 70 percent from that organization. =Term limits= Rauner strongly favored term limits, and pledged to limit himself to no more than eight years as governor. He organized and funded a push to put a constitutional amendment imposing term limits on Illinois legislators on the November 2014 ballot, gathering 591,092 signatures. However, the term limits amendment was struck down in court as unconstitutional. =Infrastructure and transportation= During his 2014 campaign, Rauner called for \\"billions\\" of dollars per year in public spending on infrastructure, but declined to detail how he would pay for the spending. Also during his campaign, Rauner declined to take a position on the controversial Illiana Expressway and Peotone Airport projects advanced by Quinn. After taking office in 2015, he suspended the Illiana project, pending a cost-benefit review. In February 2015, Rauner proposed raising highway funding and slashing transit funding, which he saw as inefficient spending. =Gun control= Rauner stated that while he wanted laws and policies to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, he would not go beyond that due to constitutional concerns. =Abortion= Rauner has a record of supporting abortion rights. The Rauner family has donated \\"thousands of dollars\\" to Planned Parenthood, and prior to his 2014 campaign, the Rauner Family Foundation donated $510,000 to the American Civil Liberties Union's Roger Baldwin Foundation. On July 29, 2016, Rauner signed S.B. 1564 into law, which required doctors and pregnancy centers that refuse to perform abortions for religious or moral reasons to refer patients to places where they could have an abortion. The bill was passed on partisan lines, with no Republican legislators voting for the bill. Rauner's decision to sign the bill into law angered conservative groups. The same day, Rauner also signed a bill that extended insurance coverage for nearly all contraceptives. On August 5, Rauner was sued by a crisis pregnancy center, a Rockford, Illinois-based medical center, and a Downers Grove physician, claiming that SB 1564 was unconstitutional. On December 20, 2016, a Winnebago County Circuit Judge issued a preliminary injunction, which temporarily prohibited the State of Illinois from enforcing the law after it went into effect on January 1, 2017. As a candidate in 2014, Rauner stated that he opposed the Illinois law that restricted abortion coverage under Medicaid and the state employee health plan. Nevertheless, in April 2017, Rauner pledged to veto an abortion rights bill that would remove those restrictions, in addition to removing a clause that would make abortions illegal if Roe v. Wade were overturned. In the end, Rauner signed the bill into law on September 28, 2017, which earned him harsh criticism from conservative Republicans. =Death penalty= In 2018, Rauner called for the death penalty to be imposed on convicted cop killers. =Voting laws= On August 12, 2016, Rauner vetoed a bill that would have automatically registered as a voter anyone in Illinois who sought a new or updated drivers license as well as other services, unless they chose to opt out. Rauner said that he supported automatic voter registration, but that he vetoed the bill because he was worried that \\"the bill would inadvertently open the door to voter fraud and run afoul of federal election law\\". On August 28, 2017, Rauner signed a revised version of the automatic voter registration bill. =Immigration enforcement= On August 28, 2017, Rauner signed a bill into law that prohibited state and local police from arresting anyone solely due to their immigration status or due to federal detainers. Some Republicans criticized Rauner for his action, saying that the bill made Illinois a sanctuary state. On November 15, 2017, the United States Department of Justice announced that a preliminary conclusion had been reached that Illinois was now a sanctuary jurisdiction in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1373 and issued a warning to state authorities on the issue. Subsequently, , there is still no evidence that Illinois responded stating that it was in compliance with the law. The deadline to do so was December 8, 2017. = Same-sex marriage and LGBT rights = Rauner supported same-sex marriage. As a gubernatorial candidate in 2014, he said that he had no comment on same-sex marriage but would not change the law legalizing gay marriages. In 2015, Rauner signed legislation banning the use of conversion therapy on minors. He also signed a bill making it easier for transgender people to change their birth certificates. He also marched in Aurora and Chicago LGBT pride parades. In 2018, Rauner officiated the wedding of a same-sex couple. Philanthropy Rauner was awarded the 2008 Distinguished Philanthropist award by the Chicago Association of Fundraising Professionals. In 2003, Rauner received the Daley Medal from the Illinois Venture Capital Association for extraordinary support to the Illinois economy and was given the Association for Corporate Growth's Lifetime Achievement Award. Rauner and his wife were nominated for the Golden Apple Foundation's 2011 Community Service Award. Rauner has been a financial supporter of projects including Chicago's Red Cross regional headquarters, the YMCA in the Little Village neighborhood, six new charter high schools, an AUSL turnaround campus, scholarship programs for disadvantaged Illinois public school students, and achievement-based compensation systems for teachers and principals in Chicago Public Schools. He provided major funding for the construction of the Rauner Special Collections Library at Dartmouth College, endowed full professor chairs at Dartmouth College, Morehouse College, University of Chicago, and Harvard Business School, and was the lead donor for the Stanley C. Golder Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurial Finance at the University of Illinois. As of 2013, Rauner served on the board of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Personal life Rauner and his wife in January 2015 Before being elected governor, Rauner resided in Winnetka, Illinois, with his wife, Diana Mendley Rauner, and family; they have three children. He also has three children from his first marriage, to Elizabeth Konker Wessel, whom he married in 1980, separated from in 1990, and was legally divorced from in 1993. During Rauner's governorship, he and his family resided in the Illinois Governor's Mansion in Springfield. They also own ranches in Montana and Wyoming. Rauner is an Episcopalian. Rauner's exact net worth is unclear, but has been estimated at being at least several hundred million dollars. During his campaign for governor he promised that he would accept only $1 in salary and no benefits from his office, including forgoing a pension and any reimbursement for travel expenses. After losing the 2018 election, Rauner moved to Florida. By August 2020, he was registered to vote in Florida rather than Illinois.

Natsume attributes this to the great importance placed on smiling in the Japanese service industry, particularly for young women. Previewed at Smiling is an important skill for Japanese women working in the service industry. Almost all service industry companies in Japan require their female staff to smile for long periods of time.Leo Lewis, Smiling can seriously damage your health, The Times, February 9, 2008 Natsume says that his female patients often talk about the importance of smiling when the topic of the conversation is on their workplace. He relates examples of patients saying that they felt their smile had a large effect on whether they were hired or not, and that their superiors had stressed the effect that good smiles had on customers. According to Natsume, this atmosphere sometimes causes women to smile unnaturally for so long that they start to suppress their real emotions and become depressed. Japanese author Tomomi Fujiwara notes that the demand for a common smile in the workplace emerged in Japan around the 1980s, and blames the cultural changes wrought by the Tokyo Disneyland, opened in 1983, for popularizing the demand for an obligatory smile in the workplace. The smile mask syndrome has also been identified in Korea. Korean writer Bae Woo-ri noted that smiling gives one a competitive advantage over the others, and has become a necessary attribute of many employees, just like a \\"neat uniform\\". Yoon-Do-rahm, a psychology counselor, compared the current society, which is full of smile-masks, to a clown show; both are characterized by plentiful, yet empty and fake, smiles. Smile mask syndrome can cause physical problems as well as mental ones. Natsume relates that many of his patients developed muscle aches and headaches as a result of prolonged smiling, and says that these are similar to the symptoms of repetitive strain injury.

Presented as a response to the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism initiated by the Czech government in 2008 to condemn communism as totalitarian and criminal, it explicitly rejects the idea that the regimes of Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler can be compared, i.e. the totalitarianism theory that was popularized by academics such as Hannah Arendt, Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski and became dominant in western political discourse during the Cold War, and that has gained new momentum in many new EU member states following the fall of communism, resulting in international resolutions, establishment of research institutes and museums, and a day of remembrance. The declaration also claims communist regimes did not commit genocides, citing a 1948 definition that deliberately excluded politically motivated mass killings as demanded by the Soviet Union when it was adopted. More recent definitions do however include such crimes, and e.g. The Holodomor is recognized as a genocide by the United States, Ukraine and other countries. The declaration advances the position that the Holocaust was \\"unique\\" as compared to other genocides, a subject of some debate. This position first appeared in discourse in 1967, but has become less common since the 1994 Rwandan genocide,Jones, Adam, ed. (2010). Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction (2nd ed.).

It was released on the 70th anniversary of the Wannsee Conference in Berlin.  Background =The Prague Declaration and the totalitarianism paradigm= SPD leader and concentration camp survivor Kurt Schumacher is famous for his early comparison of Nazism and Communism, claiming the ideologies were similar. He notably made the comparison in a famous 1930 speech confronting political extremism, and in a famous 1946 speech. Ever since the 1920s, the issue of comparisons or attempted equalization of the evils of Nazism and Communism, and especially Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism, has been the subject of extensive controversy.Michael Geyer and Sheila Fitzpatrick. \\"The New Man in Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany\\" by Peter Fritsche and Jochen Hellbeck, Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared. New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University Press, 2009.Abbott Gleason, Totalitarianism, New York, Oxford University Press, 1995 Initially, this comparison was made by the Social Democratic Party of Germany in their campaign against the Communist Party of Germany and the Nazi Party. Leading social democrat Kurt Schumacher famously called Communists \\"red-painted Nazis,\\" arguing that the Communists and the Nazis posed an equal danger to liberal democracy and that the two movements enabled each other.Mike Schmeitzner: Totalitarismuskritik von links: deutsche Diskurse im 20.

During the Cold War, the theory of two totalitarianisms, fascism and communism, gained strong momentum in the Western world, for example through the work of Hannah Arendt (notably her influential book The Origins of Totalitarianism) and other scholars, such as Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski, who argued that Nazi and Soviet regimes were equally totalitarian.Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski, Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy (2nd edn 1967) According to Volker Berghahn, \\"as Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski later put it in their classic analysis of the totalitarian paradigm that came to sweep the board in Western ideological discourse in the 1950s, Nazism and Stalinism were \\"basically alike\\" and represented very modern and brutally destructive versions of twentieth-century dictatorship.\\"Volker R. Berghahn, \\"Philanthropy and diplomacy in the American century,\\" in Michael J. Hogan (ed.), The Ambiguous Legacy: U. S. Foreign Relations in the \\"American Century\\", p. 389 Since the end of the Cold War, eastern and central European countries have established institutes and enacted laws to address crimes committed by former totalitarian regimes in their countries, both communist and fascist. Examples include the Czech state Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, the Polish state Institute of National Remembrance, the Lithuanian state Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania, the German state Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism and the Hungarian state House of Terror museum. The theory of two totalitarianisms also gained new momentum in the West in the 1990s, especially following the publication of the 1997 French book The Black Book of Communism, which said that \\"the genocide of a \\"class\\" may well be tantamount to the genocide of a \\"race,\\"\\" arguing that deaths caused by Hitler's and Stalin's regimes were \\"equal.\\" In its introduction, St√©phane Courtois argued that communism and national socialism are slightly different totalitarian systems, that communism is responsible for the murder of around 100 million people in the 20th century, that the National Socialists adopted their repressive methods from Soviet methods, and that \\"a single-minded focus on the Jewish genocide in an attempt to characterize the Holocaust as a unique atrocity has [...] prevented the assessment of other episodes of comparable magnitude in the Communist world\\". The United States Congress claimed in 1993 that 100,000,000 victims died in \\"an unprecedented imperial communist holocaust,\\" establishing the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. An increased focus on the crimes of communism after the fall of communism resulted in the 2006 Council of Europe resolution 1481, which condemned the \\"individual and collective assassinations and executions, death in concentration camps, starvation, deportations, torture, slave labour and other forms of mass physical terror\\" perpetrated by communist regimes, and in early 2008, the European Union initiated the European Public Hearing on Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes. In mid-2008, the Czech government initiated the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism, signed by V√°clav Havel, Joachim Gauck, and others. It called for \\"Europe-wide condemnation of, and education about, the crimes of communism.\\" As proposed by the declaration, the European Parliament in 2008‚Äì2009 with support of all political factions designated the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism as \\"a Europe-wide Day of Remembrance for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, to be commemorated with dignity and impartiality,\\" and a remembrance day for victims of totalitarian regimes was also adopted by Canada. In 2009, the European Parliament called for the recognition of \\"Communism, Nazism and fascism as a shared legacy,\\" reconfirmed \\"its united stand against all totalitarian rule from whatever ideological background,\\" and condemned \\"strongly and unequivocally all crimes against humanity and the massive human rights violations committed by all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes.\\" The remembrance day was endorsed by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in its 2009 Vilnius Declaration, which said that \\"in the twentieth century European countries experienced two major totalitarian regimes, Nazi and Stalinist, which brought about genocide, violations of human rights and freedoms, war crimes and crimes against humanity\\" and condemned \\"the glorification of the totalitarian regimes, including the holding of public demonstrations glorifying the Nazi or Stalinist past.\\" The European Parliament and the EU Council also endorsed the establishment of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience, as conceived by the Prague Declaration, by the governments of the Visegr√°d Group, the Polish EU presidency and several European state institutes, as an EU educational project to raise awareness about totalitarian crimes and to \\"prevent intolerance, extremism, anti-democratic movements and the recurrence of any totalitarian rule in the future.\\" The Greens‚ÄìEuropean Free Alliance argued that \\"the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism should be the common basis for the research on and evaluation of communist regimes in all countries in East-Europe.\\" The Prague Declaration was opposed by Russian bodies and organisations affiliated with Putin's government, such as the Presidential Commission of the Russian Federation to Counter Attempts to Falsify History to the Detriment of Russia's Interests and World Without Nazism. It was also opposed by several European communist parties, such as the Communist Party of Greece and the Communist Party of Britain. There were isolated critiques of the Prague Declaration in 2009 by (in chronological order of appearance in print): Dovid Katz, formerly professor of Yiddish at Vilnius University, who founded the web journal Defending History in part to oppose the Prague Declaration; Israeli activist Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Israel office; British MP John Mann, who called it a \\"sinister document\\", Anti- Germanhttp://www.redaktion-bahamas.org/auswahl/web64-2.html political scientist Clemens Heni, and others.Dovid Katz in 2009 op-eds in the Jewish Chronicle and Irish Times. He was followed by Efraim Zuroff in the Jerusalem Post, John Mann in the Jewish Chronicle, and Clemens Heni. A collection of links to opposition to the Prague Declaration is provided on a page of Defending History. The Prague Declaration was also criticised by eurosceptic John Laughland, who has instead compared the EU to Nazism.Conference of World Without Nazism, 9 October 2012, Strasbourg However, there has also been support for the Prague Declaration from Israeli academics such as Barry Rubin and Lithuanian centrist politician Emanuelis Zingeris, a former honorary chairman of that country's Jewish community. =Response by the Seventy Years Declaration= Against this backdrop, and on the initiative of Katz, Danny Ben-Moshe drafted the Seventy Years Declaration as a response to the Prague Declaration. Seventy members of the European Parliament signed it on 20 January 2012, to mark the seventieth anniversary of the 1942 Wannsee Conference in Berlin that had decided on the \\"Final Solution\\" (genocide) of European Jewry. The text of the Seventy Years Declaration was published on 20 January 2012 in Defending History, and subsequently in European languages.Danny Ben-Moshe, \\"Remembering Wannsee\\", The Jerusalem Post, 18 January 2012Dovid Katz, \\"The Seventy Years Declaration and the Simple Truth\\", Algemeiner Journal, 3 February 2012 Its launch was covered by Roger Cohen in the New York Times,Roger Cohen, \\"The Suffering Olympics\\", The New York Times, 30 January 2012 Danna Harman in Haaretz,Danna Harman, \\"European leaders to mark 70th anniversary of Nazi Wannsee Conference\\", Haaretz, 19 January 2012 Frank Brendle in Taz.de,Frank Brendle, \\"Der Holocaust ist einzigartig/The Holocaust is unique\\", taz.de, 19 January 2012 among others. In 2013, its own website was launched. The Seventy Years Declaration condemns Stalinist tyranny and calls for distinct, separate recognition of the various European tragedies of the 20th century. The SYD explicitly rejects the Prague Declaration and its \\"attempts to obfuscate the Holocaust by diminishing its uniqueness and deeming it to be equal, similar or equivalent to Communism.\\"[5] It was published on 20 January 2012, on the 70th anniversary of the Wannsee Conference and signed by 71 parliamentarians from 19 EU countries,[3] including eight MPs and MEPs from Lithuania. On the same day Audronius A≈æubalis condemned the Lithuanian signatories,[27] arguing that \\"it is not possible to find differences between Hitler and Stalin except in their moustaches.\\"[28] One of the signatories, MP Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis, now the nation's Health Minister, responded to the foreign minister.[29]UK MP Denis MacShane entered the fray with a letter in support of Andriukaitis and the other Lithuanian signatories. The Seventy Years Declaration form part of the subject material of the documentary film Rewriting History, which premiered on Australian television in September 2012,[30] and is scheduled for a number of US screenings in 2013.Graeme Blundell, \\"Lithuania‚Äôs Lies and Deception Exposed\\", The Australian, 14 September 2012Ian Cuthbertson, \\"Rewriting History: When Truth is the Enemy\\", The Australian, 8 September 2012Tim Elliott, \\"Free to Air\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 14 September 2012Hobart Mercury, \\"When Truth is the Enemy - in Time Out\\", The Hobart Mercury, 14 September 2012Nicholas Soames, \\"Rewriting History documentary Screens Tonight\\", The Surf Coast News,14 September 2012[31] The Declaration also opposes various alleged East European attempts to glorify Nazi collaborator organisations, specifically mentioning the honouring of the Waffen SS in Estonia and Latvia, and the Lithuanian Activist Front in Lithuania. It acknowledges the need to honour Jewish partisans who joined the battle against Hitler, a reference to Lithuanian government efforts to prosecute Holocaust Survivors who joined the resistance. The Declaration opposes attempts to inflate the definition of \\"genocide\\" to encompass sundry crimes of totalitarian regimes, calling for a strict definition in the spirit of the 1948 definition. The Seventy Years Declaration was presented to Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, on 14 March 2012.European Parliament Video, \\"Martin Schulz, European Parliament President meeting with Dovid Katz. Handing over of the Declaration on the Final Solution of the Wannsee Conference 70th anniversary.\\", European Parliament Press, Strasbourg, 14 March 2012European Parliament Transcript, \\"Martin SCHULZ, EP President, meeting with Dovid KATZ: - Handing over of the Declaration on the Final Solution of the Wannsee Conference\\" , European Commission, Strasbourg, 14 March 2012  Criticism and Controversy  Israeli academic Barry Rubin has written, referring to the initiators of the Seventy Years Declaration, that \\"a relentless campaign has been waged by a tiny group of people to persuade Jews and Israelis to oppose the June 3, 2008 Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism, as if it were some horrible anti-Semitic document. This is a slanderously wrong claim.\\" The Seventy Years Declaration was attacked by the incumbent Lithuanian foreign minister, who said in response that \\"It is not possible to find differences between Hitler and Stalin except in their moustaches (Hitler's was shorter).\\" The response came in anger at the fact that eight Lithuanian Social Democrats (two MEPs and six MPs) signed the Declaration. A lively debate ensued when a subsequent article by the foreign ministerAudronius A≈æubalis - Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania, \\"Havel was not an Antisemite, and the Tragedy of the Holocaust is Not a Toy in Your Election Game\\", Delfi, 3 February 2012 was replied to by MP Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis,Vytenis Povilas _ Lithuanian MP, \\"Honorable A.

The foreign minister's \\"moustache comparison\\" led to individual letters of support from British MP Denis MacShane to each of the eight Lithuanian signatories, and to coverage in the New York Times.  Text of the Seventy Years Declaration  On this the 70th anniversary of the formal adoption by the Nazi leadership of the \\"Final Solution of the Jewish Problem\\" we the undersigned Remember: With humility and sadness, the Final Solution plan which formalised and industrialised the by-then ongoing Holocaust of European Jewry The horror and brutality of the genocidal campaign of total annihilation of European Jewry conducted by the Nazis and their collaborators That the mass killing of European Jewry preceded that formal adoption of the Final Solution plan by half a year, and began on the Eastern Front in 1941 upon the initiation of Operation Barbarossa and the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union That millions of non-Jews suffered in numerous ways under the Nazis and other forms of tyranny in Europe during the Second World War. Recognise: The Nazi campaign of annihilation of the Jewish people was philosophically, qualitatively and practically profoundly distinct and different to other forms of oppression experienced by European people during World War II, such as the horrors of Stalinism also before and after the War Our dismay that the lessons of the Holocaust were not learnt and genocide continues to occur in the international arena The nobility of Jewish partisans who survived ghettos or camps and went on to fight the Nazis and their allies The efforts of European states to acknowledge forthrightly their role in the Holocaust past That discussion about genocide in Europe must be based on the definition of the UN Genocide Convention 1948 That antisemitism continues in various forms in Europe and beyond. Reject: Attempts to obfuscate the Holocaust by diminishing its uniqueness and deeming it to be equal, similar or equivalent to Communism as suggested by the 2008 Prague Declaration Equating Nazi and Soviet crimes as this blurs the uniqueness of each and threatens to undermine the important historical lessons drawn from each of these distinct experiences Attempts to have European history school books rewritten to reflect the notion of \\"Double Genocide\\" (\\"equality\\" or \\"sameness\\" of Nazi and Soviet crimes) As unacceptable the glorification of Nazi Allies, and of Holocaust perpetrators and collaborators, including the Waffen SS in Estonia and Latvia, and the Lithuanian Activist Front in Lithuania Attempts to legalise or sanitize the public display of the swastika by racist and fascist groups Efforts to have the Holocaust remembered on one common day with the victims of Communism. Advocate: Distinct days and distinct programs to remember the Holocaust and other victims of other twentieth century totalitarian regimes EU member states continue efforts to acknowledge their own roles in the destruction of European Jewry The need for ongoing genuine Holocaust education and memorialisation across the European Union Opposition to all forms of contemporary racism and discrimination and its manifestation, including antisemitism, contempt for Muslims, hate of Roma, homophobia, and other prejudice and intolerance generated by extremist politics.

(\\"Belvidere\\" means \\"beautiful to behold\\" in the Italian language.) This 300-year-old tree is believed to have served as a gathering place for pow wows held by the Native American Wamesit tribe. (\\"Wamesit\\" is an Algonquian word meaning: \\"a cornucopia of plenty for all.\\") The Wamesit Indians congregated in this area for thousands of years, and the land on which this tree grew on (which was high ground with an underground spring close by) was held as sacred to them as was the tree itself. It is also said that Revolutionary War soldiers such as Deacon Thomas Clark, Captain John Trull, and General Joseph Varnum, as well as others from this New England hamlet, traveled past the Pow-Wow Oak on their way to defend Lexington and Concord on Patriots Day, April 19, 1775. This was the very beginning of the American Revolution, which started in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In 1909, Middlesex County decided to pave Clark Road, then a dirt and gravel road that was referred to as \\"The Old Bridal Path\\". Albert E. O'Heir, an immigrant from Canada, who lived in the old Hunt Home at 241 Clark Road, did not want to see the tree, which stood in the middle of the road, cut down. In order that the tree might stand, O'Heir donated for one cent to the City of Lowell, 9,463 square feet of his land on Clark Road. In May 1931, the Molly Varnum Chapter of the Massachusetts Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) erected a sign next to the tree to commemorate the ancient oak, the Wamesit Indians, and the local militia who passed by it while traveling through that Lowell neighborhood (then still part of the town of Tewksbury) during the Revolutionary War.\\"Historic Spot Marked - Pow Wow Oak in Clark Road Set Apart by Members of Molly Varnum Chapter,\\" Lowell Sun, May 30, 1931.Massachusetts Daughters of the American Revolution, Bay State News , Volume 4, Fall Issue (August 2012), page 8. Pow-Wow Oak Commemorative Sign, January 1974 (Photo by George Koumantzelis) In September, 2009, a local, grass-roots, neighborhood, environmental organization called the Pow-Wow Oak Protectors (a registered, non-profit, public-charity), founded by George Nicholas Koumantzelis, was formed to ensure the continued safety of the tree, as it had been encroached upon for decades, doing damage to its health.\\"Lowell group pushes to save historic oak\\" Lowell Sun (LowellSun.com), May 2, 2010 In May 2011, local groups, including a current chapter of the Old Concord DAR and the Pow-Wow Oak Protectors, raised funds to have the tree's commemorative sign refurbished. The Pow-Wow Oak has also been recognized and preserved by the American Forests Historic Trees Program,\\"Preserving history: Pow Wow Oak Ceremony\\" Tewksbury Town Crier, October 8, 2012. and by the City of Lowell via the Pow Wow Oak Tree Preservation Covenant, which was recorded on March 12, 2012, at the Middlesex (North District) Registry of Deeds, Book 25799, Page 105. In May 2011, a documentary movie called \\"The Last Pow-Wow Oak\\" about the Pow-Wow Oak and the crusade to save it by the Pow-Wow Oak Protectors, as well as other, local, concerned groups, was produced and released by local artist, musician, film maker, and documentarian, Andrew Szava-Kovats. In March 2014, an accompanying book (with the same title) to the movie, including more detailed legal documents and historical data about the whole Pow-Wow Oak saga, was written and produced by Andrew Szava-Kovats. On May 21, 2013, during a very strong wind storm, a large upper branch (not the lower horizontal \\"arm\\" that pointed west) of the Pow-Wow Oak collapsed onto nearby Clark Road. Painful Bough for Lowell's Pow-Wow Oak, Lowell Sun, May 22, 2013 The following day, the decision was made by the City Manager's Office of the City of Lowell to, questionably, cut down the entire tree to the ground because extensive interior decay in the mid to upper sections of the tree had more than partially compromised the tree and the safety of pedestrians and nearby motorists. Iconic Pow-Wow is felled, Lowell Sun, May 22, 2013 On Thursday, November 12, 2015, a dedication ceremony was held at the Peter W.

Design An patent illustration of the Osann portable sewing machine A typical early 20th century sewing machine, like the Singer 27, was designed to be mounted in a treadle or table, and though reduced-size models with hand cranks and wooden cases were introduced, their weight strains the meaning of the word 'portable.' The first sewing machine designed for portability, with a completely enclosed movement, was invented in 1928 by Raymond Plumley and Richard Hohmann, engineers for the Frederick Osann Company, who took advantage of then-recent advances in alloy technology to create a machine housed in a lightweight cast aluminum body. Osann subcontracted manufacture and assembly to the Standard Sewing Machine Company of Cleveland, Ohio, which marketed the machine under a number of brands, including Osann, Standard, and General Electric. Both companies encountered financial difficulties as the Great Depression worsened; Osann was acquired by Standard, which was in turn acquired by the Singer Manufacturing Company. Singer continued production of the Sewhandy under the Standard brand through the early 30s while working on an improved design, which would be introduced as the Model 221 during the 1933 World's Fair. Like the Sewhandy, the 221 featured aluminum construction and small size, weighing only , as well as an improved self-fastening bobbin case which simplified the design of the machine's bobbin driver. Production It is estimated that Singer produced and sold some 3.0-3.5 million Featherweight machines during the model's lifetime. Production of the original Featherweight ended in 1961, but continued at Singer factories in Quebec and Scotland until 1969. Later British versions have numerous cost-saving components including a belt drive and a simpler front thread guide. An especially sought-after free arm version, Model 222K, was produced in Scotland from c.1953 to c.1961 exclusively for the non- US market. Attachments Singer Sewing Machine Ruffler Attachment A number of attachments are available for the Featherweight, including the following feet: * Foot hemmer -- used for hemming, making hemmed and felled seams, and for sewing on lace while hemming * Adjustable hemmer -- to make hems from 3/16\\" to 15/16\\" wide * Multi-slotted binder -- to apply unfolded bias binding 15/16\\" in width and folded bias bindings in sizes 1-5 (1/4\\" - 1/2\\"), or to add piping * Edge-stitcher -- replaces the presser foot, used to accurately stitch at the very edge of the fabric * Gatherer -- used to slightly gather material * Ruffler -- to make and apply ruffles in one step, to pipe ruffles, or to pleat material In popular culture In the Reba episode \\"You May Kick the Bride,\\" the eponymous series star can be seen sewing a dress on a Singer Featherweight.

Early life and education In the mid-1960s, Bill Boysen, professor emeritus from Southern Illinois University Carbondale, originated one of the first university-based blown glass programs in the United States. Both Boysen and glass artist Dale Chihuly studied under Harvey Littleton at the University of Wisconsin. Littleton and Dominick Labino are widely credited with co-founding the studio glass movement in 1962 when they demonstrated glassblowing using \\"a small-scale glass furnace at the Toledo Museum of Art in Toledo, Ohio.\\"The Penland Book of Glass: Master Classes in Flamework Techniques. Ed. Ray Hemachandra. New York: Lark Books, 2009. 8.  Career  In 1965, when Bill Brown was the director at the well- known Penland School of Crafts, he asked Bill Boysen to set up a glass studio at the facility and offer courses during their summer term. This early enthusiasm for studio glass led Penland \\"to become the site of the founding of the Glass Art Society in the early 1970s.\\" Boysen travelled to Australia in 1974, where he promoted glass artistry by presenting a \\"revolutionary demonstration of glass blowing\\"\\"Blow-in Bill leaves locals glassy-eyed.\\" Weekly Times (Australia), 31 August 2005: 95. to a gathering of around 250 attendees. Boysen's mobile studio \\"successfully toured eight eastern states' venues in '74, thus greatly enhancing the credibility of hand crafted glass.\\" Boysen's visit is credited with helping \\"inspire a generation of [Australian] artists to work with glass and eventually led to the creation of the national art glass collection\\" in Wagga Wagga, Australia.

Students in the program named the original mobile studio \\"Aunt Gladys,\\" and it remained one of only a few mobile glassblowing studios in the country until it was replaced by \\"Aunt Gladys 2\\" in the early 2000s. In an interview, Boysen explains the name, \\"We thought (the vehicle's) character was more like an aunt in the family that might come over on the weekend, bring some exciting stories, teach some new ideas and then in the blink of an eye, she's gone again.

Amnesty International, 568 U.S. 398 (2013), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that Amnesty International USA and others lacked standing to challenge (also known as Section 702) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act as amended by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008. Background Clapper was a challenge to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which empowers the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to authorize surveillance without a showing of probable cause that the target of the surveillance is an agent of a foreign power. The government need only demonstrate that the surveillance targets ‚Äúpersons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States‚Äù and seeks ‚Äúforeign intelligence information.‚Äù The plaintiffs alleged that they sustained greater inconvenience and higher costs because of the need to conduct secure communications with parties overseas whom the U.S. government had probably targeted for surveillance. The challenge was brought against James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence. Decision The Court dismissed the case by following the US government's argument that \\"the claims of the challengers that they were likely to be targets of surveillance were based too much on speculation and on a predicted chain of events that might never occur, so they could not satisfy the constitutional requirement for being allowed to sue.\\" \\"Respondents cannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending,\\" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion. Justice Breyer, in dissent, said that the case should have proceeded to trial. Of the spying, he wrote: ‚ÄúIndeed it is as likely to take place as are most future events that commonsense inference and ordinary knowledge of human nature tell us will happen.‚Äù Reactions According to Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who argued the case on behalf of the plaintiffs before the Supreme Court, the challenged amendments made in 2008 to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act essentially allow the National Security Agency (NSA) \\"to engage in dragnet surveillance of Americans‚Äô international communications\\", even those \\"who might not be suspected at all of having done anything wrong,\\" so that \\"it‚Äôs a very broad surveillance statute\\", \\"arguably broader than any surveillance statute that Congress has sanctioned in the past.\\" According to him, the Supreme Court, by requiring the plaintiffs to show that they, themselves, have been monitored under the law, has essentially created a barrier to judicial review preventing anyone from ever challenging this kind of statute in court as, indeed, nobody can show that they have been monitored under the law since the government is not disclosing its targets. Following the decision in favor of the government, several legal experts expressed that \\"Clapper also hints at a rocky reception for the challenge to the NDAA in Hedges.\\" Aftermath Before the process, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. denied that ruling in the U.S. government's favor would immunize the surveillance program from constitutional challenges. ‚ÄúThat contention is misplaced,‚Äù Verrilli wrote in a brief. ‚ÄúOthers may be able to establish standing even if respondents cannot. As respondents recognize, the government must provide advance notice of its intent to use information obtained or derived from‚Äù the surveillance authorized by the 2008 law ‚Äúagainst a person in judicial or administrative proceedings and that person may challenge the underlying surveillance.‚Äù Specifically Verrilli unequivocally assured the Supreme Court in its brief, that criminal defendants would receive notice of FAA surveillance and an opportunity to challenge the statute: > If the government intends to use or disclose any information obtained or > derived from its acquisition of a person's communications under [the FAA] in > judicial or administrative proceedings against that person, it must provide > advance notice of its intent to the tribunal and the person, whether or not > the person was targeted for surveillance under [the FAA]. The USCC then took Verrilli assurance and ruled in accordance with the FAA ¬ß1881a according to which criminal defendants who are prosecuted using evidence obtained or derived from FAA surveillance are entitled to notice:See 50 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1806(c), 188le(a) > If the Government intends to use or disclose information obtained or derived > from a ¬ß1881a acquisition in judicial or administrative proceedings, it must > provide advance notice of its intent, and the affected person may challenge > the lawfulness of the acquisition.Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, No. 11-1025, > slip op. at 22, 568 U.S._ (Feb. 26, 2013) (citing 50 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1806(c), > 1806(e), 1881e(a)) The opposite of what Verrilli told the Supreme Court happened since then in actual criminal prosecutions. Federal prosecutors, apparently unaware of his representations, have refused to make the promised disclosures. In a prosecution in Federal District Court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., against two brothers accused of plotting to bomb targets in New York, the government has said it plans to use information gathered under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, or FISA, which authorized individual warrants. But prosecutors have refused to say whether the government obtained those individual warrants based on information derived from the 2008 law, which allows programmatic surveillance. Prosecutors in Chicago have taken the same approach in a prosecution of teenager accused of plotting to blow up a bar. While both the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the FISA Amendments Act requires the government to notify defendants when evidence being used against them is derived from surveillance authorized by the corresponding law, there is a crucial difference between both laws with respect to warrants. A traditional FISA court order pursuant to the original, unamendend Act requires the government to go to a FISA judge and show probable cause that the target is an agent of a foreign power. Under the expanded surveillance program authorized in 2008 the FAA however targets non-U.S. persons ‚Äúreasonably believed‚Äù to be located outside the United States and does not require that the government obtain individual warrants before intercepting communications. Moreover, the purpose of the collection is ‚Äúforeign intelligence,‚Äù a broad category that may include everything from information on terrorism to nuclear proliferation to what a European journalist is writing on human rights abuses or an African businessman is saying about global financial risk. In essence the FAA law authorized the government to wiretap Americans‚Äô e-mails and phone calls without an individual court order and on domestic soil so long as the surveillance is ‚Äútargeted‚Äù at a foreigner abroad. Judge John O'Sullivan explained it this way in the Florida case: > Before passage of the FAA in 2008, FISA generally foreclosed the government > from engaging in \\"electronic surveillance\\" without first obtaining an > individualized and particularized order from the Foreign Intelligence > Surveillance Court (\\"FISC\\"). To obtain an order from the FISC, the > government had to satisfy certain requirements including that a \\"significant > purpose\\" of the surveillance was to obtain \\"foreign intelligence > information. 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 1805(a)(2)(B). > When FISA was amended in 2008, the FAA provided legislative authority for > the warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens' and residents' > communications. Although the FAA left FISA intact regarding communications > known to be purely domestic, the FAA expanded FISA by allowing the mass > acquisition of U.S. citizens' and residents' international communications > without individualized judicial oversight or supervision. See Clapper v. > Amnesty Intl USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 1143-44 (2013). Under the FAA, the > Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence (\\"DNI\\") may > \\"authorize jointly, for a period of up to one year ... the targeting of > persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to > acquire foreign intelligence information.\\" 50 U.S.C. ¬ß 1881(a). Verrilli had told the Supreme Court justices that somebody would have legal standing to trigger review of the program because prosecutors would notify people facing evidence derived from surveillance under the 2008 FISA Amendments law. But it turned out that Verrilli's assurances clashed with the actual practices of national security prosecutors, who had not been alerting such defendants that evidence in their cases had stemmed from wiretapping their conversations without a warrant. For Verrilli, this led to the question of whether any persuasive legal basis exists for failing to clearly notify defendants that they faced evidence linked to the 2008 warrantless surveillance law, thereby preventing them from knowing that they had an opportunity to argue that it derived from an unconstitutional search. After internal deliberations, in which Verrilli argued that there was no legal basis to conceal from defendants that evidence derived from legally untested surveillance, preventing them from knowing they had an opportunity to challenge it, the U.S. Justice Department concluded ‚Äúthat withholding disclosure from defendants could not be justified legally.‚Äù As a consequence of this the Justice Department is, as of October 2013, setting up a potential Supreme Court test of whether it is constitutional, by notifying a criminal defendant ‚Äî for the first time ‚Äî that evidence against him was derived from eavesdropping that was authorized under the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. The first defendant who received notice that he had been monitored under the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA) was Jamshid Muhtorov on October 25, 2013. According to the New York Times the move is expected to set up a Supreme Court test of whether eavesdropping from a warrantless wiretap is constitutional. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the Soilicitor General Verrilli for providing criminal defendants who are prosecuted using evidence obtained or derived from FAA surveillance and are entitled to notice that this evidence was acquired under the FISA Amendments Act with such statutorily required notice required under the FISA Amendments Act. This gives defendants the opportunity to move to suppress FAA-derived evidence and to right to challenge the warrantless wiretapping law, and trial courts the opportunity to adjudicate the FAA's constitutionality. Despite its praise, the ACLU urged Verrilli \\"should now submit a letter-brief alerting the [Supreme] Court to the significant factual error in the government‚Äôs submissions. His letter should explain what the NSD's [National Security Division of the U.S. Justice Department] notice policy was when Clapper was before the courts; on what basis the NSD came to the conclusion that the policy was justified; how it came to pass that the government misrepresented the NSD‚Äôs policy; and what the NSD‚Äôs notice policy is now.\\" See also * Litigation over global surveillance * ACLU v.

Biography  Anna Herr was born in Pennsylvania on March 9, 1866. She married James W. Clise. James‚Äô sister urged Anna and James to relocate to Seattle, and so they did on June 7, 1889. James and Anna lived together on a farm in Redmond, which later became known as Marymoor Park. One of their children, named Willis, became seriously ill when he was 6 years old. He died on March 19, 1898, from untreatable inflammatory rheumatism. Anna wanted to prevent other families from experiencing similar tragedies, so she thought of establishing a hospital. On January 4, 1907, Anna gathered 16 of her friends to discuss the lack of treatment options for children in local hospitals. They decided that all children should receive care regardless of the family's ability to pay. They all agreed that support for the hospital will have to come from the community. So Anna called 23 of her friends to create a facility to treat crippled and malnourished children. Each of them contributed $20 to launch the hospital. On January 11, 1907, Anna incorporated the Children's Orthopedic Hospital Association. The hospital initially shared space with an adult hospital. This institution became the first pediatric facility in the Northwest and the third on the west coast. Anna needed to raise money to move out of the shared space and build the first children's-only facility on Queen Anne Hill in Seattle. She did this in 1908 by raising $50,000 (worth more than $1 million in today's money), which also helped her rent seven beds for about $7 each per week. The rental fee covered bedding, meals, nursing care and operating room charges. This facility remained in Queen Anne until 1953, when it moved to its current location in Seattle's Laurelhurst neighborhood. Anna was not alive to witness that, as she died on February 11, 1936, in Los Angeles, California.

History The company was founded in 1891 by Winthrop Ingersoll when he moved W.R. Eynon & Co. from Cleveland, Ohio to Rockford. Originally, Ingersoll Machine Tools focused almost entirely on milling machinery and processes for metal removal. It acquired contracts from General Electric and, by 1917, was closely involved with wartime production and had a workforce of 600. It went on to produce customized machines for industries such as airplane and auto manufacturing. In the period from the 1960s to the 1980s, the company employed around 2,000 people at its plant, also developing CNC technologies to introduce automation into its manufacturing processes. Bankruptcy In 2003, Ingersoll International went bankrupt. The company was purchased by the Italian Camozzi Group. Since its purchase by Camozzi, the company has attempted to redefine its place in the market, continuing with milling machines but also expanding into other areas. Activities today Ingersoll Machine Tools is involved in advanced fiber placement (AFP) for the aerospace industry. It has made the wing molds for Mitsubishi, supplier of the wings on the Boeing 787. Retrieved 2013-03-04 In 2010, it received Best Supplier Award from Alenia Aeronautica. Ingersoll's AFP machines are also installed at UTC Aerospace Systems' (formerly Goodrich Corporation) facilities in Riverside, California. At this facility, the machines are used to layup the engine nacelles for the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350.

Life Born Emily Frances Adeline Sergeant at Ashbourne, Derbyshire, the second daughter of Richard Sergeant and Jane (Hall), she was home schooled until the age of thirteen, when she attended school in Weston-super-Mare. Her mother was a writer of stories for youngsters that were published under the pen name 'Adeline'; Emily later adopted this name for her own writings. At fifteen a collection of Emily's poems were published in a volume that received positive notice in Weslayan periodicals. She won a scholarship to attend Queen's College, London. Her father died in 1870, and for several years she became a governess at Riverhead, Kent. In 1882, her novel Jacobi's wife resulted in a small award of ¬£100, and the work was published serially in London. For the next several years her writings were serialized in the Dundee newspaper, where she lived from 1885-7. Adeline then moved to Bloomsbury, London, where she earned enough keep to support herself through her writings. In the late 1880s she developed an interest in Fabianism and the plight of the poor in London. Over her literary career, she produced over ninety novels; with some involving a religious theme. Her religious views evolved over time, including a period in the 1880s when she was briefly agnostic. Finally, she converted to Catholicism at the end of the century. Emily served as literary adviser to the publishing company R. Bentley & Sons. She frequently traveled abroad, making trips to Egypt and Palestine. In 1901 she moved to Bournemouth, where she died in 1904. Bibliography * Beyond recall (1882) * Jacobi's wife (1882) * An open foe.

Mar√≠a D√≠az II de Haro (b. c. 1318 or 1320 - d. 16 September 1348) was a Spanish noble of the House of Haro. She was the daughter of Juan de Castilla y Haro and his wife, Isabel of Portugal and was Lady of Biscay from 1334 until her death in 1348.  Family Origins  Daughter of Juan de Castilla y Haro and of Isabel of Portugal, she was the paternal granddaughter of infante John of Castile and of Mar√≠a I D√≠az de Haro, Lady of Biscay. Her maternal grandparents were the infante Afonso of Portugal and his wife, Violante Manuel  Biography  In 1326, her father was assassinated in Toro by order of King Alfonso XI of Castile who also subsequently confiscated all her father's property. Mar√≠a D√≠az II was taken to France where she lived in the city of Bayonne. While at Bayonne, Juan N√∫√±ez III de Lara, head of the House of Lara and noble Magnate of the Kingdom of Castile and Leon solicited her hand in marriage. The two were married that same year. During the first part of the reign of Alfonso XI, her husband Juan N√∫√±ez III reclaimed from the king in her name, all properties that had previously belonged to her father. In the process, Juan N√∫√±ez III fought against the king on various occasions until his final definitive reconciliation with the king after his being besieged and defeated at Lerma. After the peace between her husband and the king, all parties were able to coexist peacefully with the Castilian-Leonese monarch. Alfonso XI ratified the possession of the Lordship of Biscay as belonging to Mar√≠a D√≠az II and promised to not use the title himself in any way, something that he had previously done since 1332.Rodr√≠guez Garc√≠a, Francisco (2002) [1865]. p. 69.  Death and Sepulcher  Iglesia de San Francisco, Palencia that formed part of the former convent of San Francisco where Mar√≠a D√≠az de Haro was buried beside her son, the infante Tello de Castilla. Mar√≠a D√≠az II died on 16 September 1348 shortly after giving birth to her son, Nu√±o D√≠az de Haro who went on to briefly inherit the Lordship of Biscay after the death of his father in 1350 at Burgos. She was buried at the Convento de San Francisco in Palencia. Today, the only remains on the site are those of the church.Rodr√≠guez Garc√≠a, Francisco (2002) [1865]. p. 50. Upon his death, Tello of Castile, the husband of Mar√≠a D√≠az II's daughter Juana de Lara was also buried at the convent. The sacristy of the church still contains the grave of Tello de Castilla who wrote in his will the desire to be buried in a silver coffin.Rodr√≠guez Garc√≠a, Francisco (2002) [1865]. p. 64. Unfortunately the sepulcher belonging to Mar√≠a D√≠az II de Haro has been lost to time, probably having been destroyed during the Peninsular War when the convent of San Francisco de Palencia was converted into a barracks billeting French troops. It could have also been lost when the Convent of San Francisco was sold in 1835.  Marriage and Descendants  In 1331, she married Juan N√∫√±ez III de Lara, the head of the House of Lara and the grandson of Alfonso X of Castile. The couple had the following children: * Juana de Lara - XV lady of the House of Lara and Lady of Biscay. Wife of the infante Tello de Castilla, she was assassinated in Seville at the age of 24 by order of King Peter of Castile * Isabel de Lara, lady of Lara and of Vizcaya (Biscay), from 1359 through 1361, she succeeded her younger brother in the possession of the Lordship of Biscay. In 1354, she married infante Juan de Arag√≥n y Castilla, son of King Alfonso IV of Aragon. Her husband was later assassinated by his cousin, Peter I of Castile * Nu√±o D√≠az de Haro, Lord of Lara and Lord of Biscay. He was named the Lord of Biscay in 1350 at the age of 2.

Banker (born Asatour Sarafian; May 31, 1895 ‚Äì January 1979) was an Armenian American inventor who patented a number of works, including an automatic transmission for automobiles, the needleless inoculation gun, the primary controls of the first Sikorsky helicopter, and power steering. He is considered by some as the \\"father of automatic transmission.\\" He is accredited as the inventor of the first practical automatic transmission, though Alfred Horner Munro of Canada patented an automatic transmission 14 years before Banker. (Munro's invention relied on the medium of compressed air and therefore lacked power and was never developed commercially.) Life and career Oscar Banker was born Asatour Sarafian in the Ottoman Empire in 1895 to an Armenian family. His family survived the Hamidian Massacres of the 1890s. Sarafian, who was an infant at the time, became sick and was not expected to live due to the lack of caregiving by his mother, who became traumatized from the massacres. His father saved the child's life by using a goat's udder as a feeding bottle in order to feed him grape juice. This technique ultimately brought Asatour back to full health. Asatour left the Ottoman Empire as a teenager and settled in Chicago. On his arrival in Ellis Island, Asatour Sarafian took up the name Oscar Banker and began working for a shop that specialized in machinery. While working at the machine shop, Banker invented a saw-filing machine. After his first invention, Banker dedicated his life to inventing. When General Motors incorporated the semi-automatic transmission system, the mechanism had many flaws. Oscar Banker proposed an automatic transmission system for the company that would be more safe and durable. After battling for eight years with automobile engineering companies, Banker's proposition was accepted and his automatic transmission was adopted by General Motors. Eventually, Banker came to be known as \\"the man who made [consumer advocate] Ralph Nader.\\" He was also mentioned in Ralph Nader's book Unsafe at Any Speed. Banker was also noted for his contribution to aviation mechanics. He invented the primary control of the first Sikorsky helicopter. The invention eventually led to the mass production of helicopters during World War II. Banker invented a pneumatic inoculation gun. Banker's wife heard on the television that military surgeon Dr. Robert Hingson suggested such a mechanism, and she told her husband. Banker ultimately patented the gun in 1968. The gun was accepted by the Med-E-Jet company in Cleveland, Ohio. It had the ability to administer 2,000 shots an hour. The gun was used throughout the world. When Grenada suffered an epidemic, Med-E-Jet issued many of Banker's pneumatic inoculation guns. On August 2, 1979, Grenada issued a postage stamp to commemorate his achievement. Bob Hull has published Oscar H. Banker's memoirs titled Dreams and Wars of an American Inventor: An Immigrant's Romance in 1983. In his memoirs Banker writes: \\"America is yet the greatest country existing for opportunity, for achievement and if a person can endure the hardships, ridicule, rebuffs, whatever and keep on going! That is what counts. And absolutely nothing else.\\" Oscar Banker had a son named Oscar Banker Jr. Oscar Banker died in Cleveland, Ohio in 1979 at the age of 83.

On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin-off Liberty Starz into a separate public company; the transaction includes about $1.5 billion of debt. The spin-off of the subsidiary was expected to be completed by the end of 2012, but was actually completed on January 11, 2013. As a result of the spin-off, Liberty Starz changed its name to \\"Starz Inc.\\" Starz Inc.'s businesses and assets consist of Starz Networks, Starz Distribution, and its minority stake in Arc Productions. =Acquisition by Lionsgate= On February 11, 2015, John C.

Since the late 1990s, it has increasingly become home to many Internet start-up companies and has acquired the nickname Silicon Sentier. Geography A typical street in the neighborhood, Rue du Sentier The area is a rectangle of buildings bounded by rue Montmartre to the west, the Boulevard de Sebastopol to the east, Boulevard Poissonni√®re and Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle to the north and by rue Reaumur in the south. It is crossed by several roads including rue d'Aboukir, rue de Caire and Place du Caire. Sentier's Textile Products *The textile industry includes: wholesalers, distributors, small tailors and retail shops etc.. *Fabric, clothing, lingerie, footwear, jewellery, fashion, accessories, supplies, raw textile materials, linen, leather goods, luggage, haberdashery, etc. From textiles to \\"Silicon Sentier\\" Because of its proximity to the former Paris stock exchange building (the Palais Brongniart), the AFP and many financial companies, several operators have deployed high-speed fibre optic networks in the area. Around this time specialized companies also opened datacenters in the area for telephone operators, internet service providers and large companies, allowing them greater network connectivity. One of the first was the \\"Telehouse-1\\" datacenter opened by the company Telehouse Europe in 1996 on rue de Jeuneurs. Despite much larger datacenters now existing in the Parisian suburbs, Telehouse-1 is still used today by some thirty operators, including specialist services for large companies such as Neuf Cegetel, Completel, Verizon and Orange Business Services. During the Dot Com Boom in the late 1990s, approximately fifty startups settled in the Sentier area, including offices for Yahoo!, Nomad, Lastminute.fr, Net2one, BuyCentral, Webcible and MandrakeSoft. The area was attractive to startups because of its proximity to fibre optic routes and also because there were many empty spaces left over when some of the garment factories moved out. At first rents were affordable, however free spaces are now becoming rare, and rents in the neighbourhood are rising.Journal \\"Les Echos\\" from 2000.20.04, \\"On the Sentier district in Paris: the Net-economy in the footsteps of textile\\" After the Dot-Com bubble burst (around 2000) many firms that were established in the area closed. Sentier in Literature By the 19th century, Sentier was the center of the textile industry in France. Honor√© de Balzac refers to it several times in Le Bal de Sceaux, where Emilie de Fontaine discovers Maximilien Longueville selling fabric. It was also traditionally the area housing the headquarters of the many newspapers, as Balzac mentions in the Rabouilleuse where Philippe Bridau files his copy before going to dinner at the Rocher de Cancale.Furne edition, vol. VI, p. 122, 133 Dominique Manotti in Sombre Sentier (Seuil Policiers, 1995), is set against the backdrop of striking illegal Turkish workers in Sentier.

It continues to represent manual laborers and semi-skilled workers in all of Peninsular Malaysia.2 Ethnically, its membership has historically been of predominantly Indian origin, reflecting the workforce in the industry. An assessment of the NUPW's record as of 1996 concluded that it had made contributions to the welfare of its members, such as subsidising adult education and school education for members' children, and through campaigning against alcohol abuse; and also had some positive impact on pay, albeit largely tied to productivity bonuses. However, it struggled to respond to the restructuring of estates, often used by employers to undermine workers' rights, invested in numerous unsuccessful businesses, and spent an excessive proportion of funds on union employees.

Construction started, but was suspended in 2013. Plans to resume construction were announced in August 2015. It is in Dawei, the capital of the Tanintharyi Region. It aims to transform Dawei into Myanmar's and Southeast Asia's largest industrial and trade zone. It aims to develop local businesses, provide local employment opportunities, and stimulate the construction of infrastructure. It is notable for its tumultuous history, as many financial and human rights violations have arisen during the project's history. If completed, it will be the largest industrial zone in Southeast Asia.  Dawei Special Economic Zone law  The Dawei Special Economic Zone Law, officially known as The State Peace and Development Council Law No. 17, was passed on 27 January 2011. The law has a number of notable tax breaks for investors and developers, in order to spur investment in the region. The law stipulates that two zones, the promotion zone and the exempted zone, are to exist within the special economic zone itself. The two zones differ in their tax breaks. Tanintharyi Region in Myanmar =Income tax breaks= Investors in the project are exempt from income taxes on their businesses for their first seven years of operation in the exempted zone, and for their first five years of operation in the promotion zone. In both zones, investors receive 50% relief in their second five years of operation, and 50% relief on all profits in their third year of operation. Developers have all of the same stipulations, except they are exempted from income tax in their first eight years of operation. =Customs duties= Developers are exempted from customs duties for construction materials, machinery, equipment, heavy machinery, and vehicles. Investors have the same exemption in the exempted zone, but in the promotion zone pay 50% of normal duties for the first five years of transport into Dawei. =Business and investors' rights= Businesses in the Dawei port project have been granted a number of rights by the law which are not common elsewhere in Burma. They are given the right to open foreign bank accounts, and have relaxed currency exchange restrictions. Additionally, foreign companies and investors are allowed to invest in the project, and the government does not regulate product pricing. The law also stipulates that the government will not seize, or nationalize businesses in the zone. =Proposed zones= The project, as stipulated by The Dawei Special Economic Zone Law, aims to construct many differentiated zones. High-tech industrial zones, information technology zones, export processing zones, port area zones, transportation zones, technological research & development zones, service business zones, sub-trading zones, and governmental zones are all part of the construction project. In the construction of these zones, law also stipulates that investors and developers must employ local workers. Businesses are supposed to find these workers via labor recruitment agents. Twenty-five percent of their non-specialist workforce is required to be employed by Burmese citizens during their first five years, 50% during their second five years, and 75% during their third five years. Businesses are also required to supply adequate training for all of their employees. The project is also set to include a 160 kilometer-long two lane super highway that connects the zone to the Thai-Burma border. A large amount of infrastructure is required to be built as well, so a high-speed railway, an electric grid, a dockyard, a deep sea port, and oil and gas pipelines are slated for construction. The entirety of the special economic zone is slated to be 196 square kilometers, and will be ten times larger than Thailand's largest industrial zone.  Construction timeline =Initial plan and project suspension= Thailand and Burma signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to develop the Dawei Special Economic Zone (·Äë·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äù·Äö·Ä∫·Ä°·Äë·Ä∞·Ä∏·ÄÖ·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äï·ÄΩ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äõ·Ä±·Ä∏·Äá·ÄØ·Äî·Ä∫) in 2008. Another MOU was signed in July 2012. The Burmese and Thai governments then agreed to complete the project by 2015 at an ASEAN summit in November 2012. The estimated total costs of the project were US$8.6 billion, but those estimates have since risen to US$10.7 billion. Member Countries of ASEAN Burma initially granted Italian- Thai Development PCL (ITD) a 75-year concession in 2008 to construct the project, and attract investment, as a part of the first memorandum of understanding. The investment required to develop the zone at the time was estimated to total US$8.6 billion, and require 1,000 laborers. Progress slowed due to a lack of funds, but the Thai and Burmese government opted to continue construction despite this. In 2012, Max Burma Conglomerate confirmed that it would pull out, giving up its 25% stake in the project. In 2013, after failing to attract enough investment, and failing to commit to a power source, ITD was stripped of its position as the sole leader of development in the zone. The Thai and Burmese governments temporarily seized responsibility from ITD, in an attempt to rescue the floundering project. Han Sein, the Chairman of the Dawei Special Economic Zone Management Committee told reporters, \\"In this economic zone, there needs to be a lot of investors.\\" The ITD was then required to halt activities so that the three international auditing companies Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Deloitte could check to see if the project was being built to international standards. Up until the suspension of construction in 2013, the ITD had spent US$189 million on the project. Following this suspension and Max Burma Conglomerate's pullout, the Burmese and Thai governments both took 50% stakes in the project, and looked to attract international investors. Thailand and Burma proposed involving Japan as a third-party investor, but the Japanese government declined to invest in the project. Despite consistent pressure from the Thai government, significant funding from Japanese investors did not occur. In 2013, Thailand's Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning conducted a new feasibility study of the zone's infrastructure, as Japan had disagreed with the plan made by Italy- Thai group. Thai banks committed US$4 billion following these issues, in an attempt to keep the project moving. =Resumption= The initial resumption of construction was set for 15 May 2014, but was delayed as both governments looked for investors. Additionally, they created a new plan, which involved two phases of construction, the initial phase, and the full-fledged phase. The new plan also stipulated that the zone would cover 196 square kilometers, instead of 204.5 square kilometers. Many experts thought that the Dawei Special Economic Zone was doomed to failure. The Economic Affairs Officer at The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific said that Kalargote Island looked like a more promising, and more feasible opportunity, noting that a logistically-sound deep sea port should be the singular focus of Burma's next step forward in their industrialization. In 2014, the Thai and Burmese governments officially announced that they planned to revive the project, which had been dormant for the past two years. They plan to utilize ITD once again, while bringing in the help of Rojana Industrial Park PLC. Burmese Vice President Nyan Tun at the World Economic Forum in 2013 On 30 January 2015, Japan agreed to participate in the project. It was revealed that they will hold equal partnership to Thailand and Burma in the Dawei Special Economic Zone Development Co, and intend to provide technical and financial support for the project. On the same day, Rojana and ITD announced that they will sign an agreement in March 2015 to develop the initial phase of the project, which is estimated to cost US$1.7 billion. The new plan states that the 160 kilometer road to the Thai-Burmese border will be built first, with a budget of US$119 million. The Thai government will provide Burma with soft loans to help provide the necessary capital. Thai Deputy Prime Minister Pridiyathorn Devakula said that during this first phase of construction, they aim to complete a small port, a reservoir, a telecoms network, and other basic infrastructure projects in the next five years. This initial phase is set to cover 27 square kilometers of the planned 196 square kilometer industrial complex. Burma's Vice President Nyan Tun said that with the help of Japan, this project will now be able to move along quickly. Moving away from the stipulations made in the Dawei Special Economic Zone Law of 2011, it was also announced that the Neighboring Countries Economic Development Cooperation Agency are being hired to redevelop a master plan for the zone.  Controversy and human rights issues =The Dawei Development Association= This special economic zone project has been criticized extensively for its human rights abuses of local villagers. There is significant opposition from local populations, due to alleged land seizures, forced evictions, insufficient compensation for confiscated farmland, and denial of their right to sufficient food, and adequate housing. Additionally, there is a significant fear of health problems, as the massive industrial complex will be a significant polluter. The Dawei Development Association, a coalition of civil society groups, was set up by residents of Dawei to look into the project, and raise awareness. U Tin Maung Swe, chairman of the Support Group for the Deep Sea Port and Special Economic Zone, responded to concerns by telling the media, \\"People have criticized this project because of the chemical industries and their fears of the effect on the environment and the social structure. We won't accept any investment that could have a negative impact. We want labor-intensive industries that can produce value- added local products. We're always thinking about the public interest.\\" According to U Phone Shwe, Deputy Minister for Social Welfare, Relief, and Resettlement, residents, who have in total lost over 6,000 acres of land to the project thus far, have received US$33 million in compensation. The project expects to owe villagers about US$307 million more moving forward. According to the villages of the area and the Dawei Development Association (DDA), villagers were either underpaid by the project, or not paid at all. When villagers were paid, they weren't given enough money to buy new farmland, which lowered their standards of living. They estimate that 20 to 36 villages housing 22,000 to 43,000 people will be affected by the project. The DDA called for a freeze on the special economic zone in 2014, in hopes to prevent it from resuming at a large scale without human rights abuses being attended to. The DDA also called for The National Human Rights Commissions of Thailand and Burma to conduct a full investigation on human rights abuses in the mega- project, as a part of a report that they released, titled Voices From the Ground: Concerns Over the Dawei Special Economic Zone and Related Projects, which evaluated the abuses. The DDA received an audience with The National Human Rights Commission of Thailand in October 2014 after releasing their report, to submit findings on human rights abuses in the project. According to the report, two-thirds of households didn't receive information from the ITD or the government about the project. Only 15% of households received any form of compensation for lost land, and many families were coerced or tricked into relocation. Additionally, only 27% of surveyed residents ever received consultation meetings, and said meetings were oftentimes one-way and non- negotiable. Despite the stalling of operations in 2013, much of the land for the project has been seized and cleared, and 71% of households in the area are expected to lose their land to the project. Upon receiving the report, Thai officials deflected the blame onto the Burmese government, whose own National Human Rights Commission has not offered the DDA an audience. =The Tavoyan Women's Union= The Tavoyan Women's Union, a local rights NGO in Dawei, released a 2014 report titled Our Lives Not for Sale, that claimed the project was destroying local economy. The report describes how the Dawei Special Economic Zone project has undermined local agricultural and fishing livelihoods, through the confiscation of land, restriction of coastal access, and destruction of farmland. The report also found that villagers in Dawei were now facing food insecurity, and three-quarters of people surveyed reported that they had to take their children out of school for financial reasons. In another report, they found that people near the proposed site had a loss in income, which forced many of them to send family members to Thailand to work. Five weeks after Our Lives are Not for Sale was published, U Phone Swe, a Deputy Minister in the Tanintharyi Regional Government, organized a public demonstration in support of the special economic zone. The 300 demonstrators shouted that the TWU, and everyone else who didn't support the project was their enemy. The TWU also reported that government officials went to teachers in the region, and told them not to teach about the negative impacts of coal. They allegedly warned the teachers not to oppose the coal project, as they were \\"teaching politics\\".

It flows through the municipalities of Stryn, Gloppen, Stad, Bremanger, and Kinn, and it is the central feature of the entire Nordfjord region which makes up the northern third of the county. Map of the fjord and surrounding areas The long fjord stretches from Husev√•g√∏y island in Kinn Municipality to the village of Loen in Stryn Municipality. The fjord starts as runoff from the Jostedalsbreen, Europe's largest mainland glacier, in the east and it flows west, emptying into the ocean just south of the Stadlandet peninsula. The mouth of the fjord lies between the large islands of V√•gs√∏y and Bremangerlandet (with the smaller island of Husev√•g√∏y lying in the middle of the mouth). There are several smaller fjords which branch off the main Nordfjorden: Eidsfjorden, √Ölfotfjorden, Hyefjorden, and Gloppefjorden. The fjord reaches a maximum-depth of near the mouth of the Eidsfjorden and also by the village of Bryggja. Transportation View of the Anda-Lote ferry crossing The fjord has no road or rail crossings, but it has three regular ferry crossings. There is an electric ferry from Anda to Lote as part of the European route E39 highway, using 75 kWh per crossing. Another crossing is from Isane to St√•rheim. The final crossing is near the mouth of the fjord from the town of M√•l√∏y to Oldeide. This final crossing also includes a stop at the island of Husev√•g√∏y in the middle of the fjord.

Thomas Davy was born on 1 May 1890 in Auckland, New Zealand, the eldest son of a doctor, Thomas George Davy, and his wife Emily, Gates. The family moved to London in 1894 before migrating to Western Australia in 1895. Dr Thomas Davy practised medicine firstly at Coolgardie, then Fremantle and West Perth. Davy went to school at Coolgardie, then in Fremantle and at the High School, Perth (now Hale School), where in 1909 he received a Rhodes scholarship. He left to study law at Exeter College in Oxford, before being called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1913. The following year he returned to Western Australia, practising law for a time. In February 1915 Davy joined the Royal Field Artillery and served in France from May 1915 until he was wounded in action in September 1916. Davy continued his service in India until 1919. On 21 December 1915 Davy married Penelope Ethel, daughter of Horatio William Sholl, a Western Australian politician. At the end of World War I he returned to Western Australia and resumed his law practice, subsequently becoming a partner in the legal firm of Northmore, Hale, Davy and Leake, and was appointed a King's Counsel in March 1932. Davy sat on the High School's Board of Governors from 1920 and as its chairman in 1929 instigated the change in the school's name to Hale School. In 1924 Davy was endorsed by the Nationalist Party to contest the Legislative Assembly seat of West Perth, against the sitting member Edith Cowan, who was herself a Nationalist. It was not unusual at the time for the Nationalist Party to endorse more than one candidate for a seat, but in this case Cowan was seen as unreliable in her support for the \\"party line\\", and the party devoted most of its resources to the election of Davy. Davy narrowly won the seat. He was re-elected in 1927, again against Cowan, who contested the seat as a Women's Electoral League candidate, and again in 1930. On 29 April 1930 Davy was appointed as Attorney-General and in October 1931 also took on the position of Minister for Education. In 1932 he was also made the Minister for the North-West. He was deputy leader of the Nationalist Party from 1927 to 1933, and was acting Premier on several occasions during the absence of Sir James Mitchell. On 18 February 1933 Davy died unexpectedly of a heart attack while playing cards with close friends at the Savoy Hotel. His widow, two daughters and a son survived him. Davy was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery. Despite being a lawyer, King's Counsel and the attorney-general, Davy died intestate, leaving an estate worth ¬£8,946. A memorial aviary, designed by Harold Boas, was constructed at the Perth Zoo and named after him, and a street in Wembley Downs is named after him.

Roberta was born in Bonham, Texas before studying singing in Nashville, Chicago, and Paris. While in Paris, she married Prince Kojo Tovalou Hou√©nou of Dahomey. When Hou√©nou died in a French prison, Roberta was left without access to their marriage funds and returned to Paris where she lived through the Nazi occupation from 1940 until 1944. After the war, she returned to Texas where she died in 1954 in Dallas. Early life Roberta Dodd Crawford was born on 5 August 1897 in the Tank Town section of Bonham, Texas. She was one of eight children of Joe and Emma Dodd (n√©e Dunlap). She was active in the church choir and any other musical opportunities in Bonham while growing up. She worked at the Curtis Boarding House in town in 1914 and would often perform regular songs for customers. Because of her singing talents, five white women in the community paid for her to attend Wiley College until she transferred to Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee and then in 1920 to the Chicago College of Performing Arts. She studied with many prominent singers and vocal coaches at these institutions including Roland Hayes and vocal coach Hattie Van Buren. While studying in Chicago, she married William B. Crawford, a captain in the U.S. Army. Musical career and marriages Her first major performance was on 15 April 1926 at Kimball Hall in Chicago where she sang pieces in five different languages and included songs by African American composers, like N. Clark Smith. She was one of the few opera singers who would sing in Spanish at the time. She followed this performance with a number of shows throughout Missouri, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas (including a concert in Bonham). At some point in the late-1920s, her relationship with William B Crawford ended; sources disagree, with some claiming that Roberta was widowed and others that she divorced. After a number of concerts, she moved to Paris in 1928 to study with mezzo-soprano Blanche Marchesi. While in Paris in 1931, she met and began a relationship with Kojo Tovalou Hou√©nou, a prominent African lawyer and writer who was related to the royal family of the kingdom of Dahomey (in present-day Benin). Crawford and Hou√©nou married on 6 March 1932 in Paris and lived in the city for the early years of the marriage. The couple were very connected to the African and African-American communities in Paris during the 1930s and were active in the arts and cultural scenes. During this period, she went by the name Princess Tovalou Hou√©nou and continued to perform in Paris. However, much of the later years were spent outside of Paris, in Dahomey, Senegal and other parts of West Africa as Hou√©nou was continually harassed and arrested by French authorities for his political involvement. He died on 13 July 1936 while in a French prison. World War II and death After Hou√©nou's death, Crawford was unable to gain access to their shared property, which included her concert earnings, because they were all impounded by the French colonial authorities. She returned to Paris, lived with friends, and worked for the National library of Paris in the late 1930s. However, having little money, meant that she was unable to escape Paris when Nazi Germany took over the city at the beginning of World War II. As an African-American, her work and freedom were severely constrained, including periods under house arrest, in internment camps, and the inability to get work permits. Although she was a prisoner for a period during this time, there are conflicting reports regarding whether she was ever held in a concentration camp. When Allied troops entered Paris, she resumed singing and worked for the Red Cross entertaining troops. However, anemia and malnutrition prevented her from regular work and she returned to Texas sometime around 1950. She died on 14 June 1954 of a heart attack in Dallas and is buried, in an unmarked grave, in Gates Hill Cemetery in Bonham.

In the words of historian Mike Foster, Frank Rhoda was an \\"artist, musician, writer, surveyor, naturalist, social critic, defender of civil liberties and champion of Christ - the only theme unifying his versatile life was idealism that aimed to reform almost everything he encountered.\\" Born in Crescent City, California, he grew up on a large fruit farm in the Fruitvale section of Oakland. Rhoda studied civil engineering at the University of California and in 1872 at age 19 he was the youngest member of that institution's first graduating class. The University tried to recruit him to teach mathematics. In addition he informally studied ancient Greek and Hebrew during his college days. For three summer seasons (1873‚Äì75) he worked with his half brother A. D. Wilson as assistant topographer producing eloquete notes and detailed sketches of mountains in southwestern Colorado. Rhoda's chronicling of the 1874 Hayden Survey has been considered one of the \\"best of the last century in American mountaineering\\", and parts of his account were published in the Pittsburgh Gazette. Through the efforts of Mike Foster, his 1874 survey notes were published in a 1984 book, \\"Summits to Reach.\\" As part of the surveys, he scaled six mountains over 14,000 feet including Uncompahgre Peak, Mt. Wilson (named for A.D. Wilson), Mt. Sneffels, Handies Peak, San Luis Peak, and Sunshine Peak. In all, Wilson and Rhoda ‚Äúclimbed 35 summits over 12,000 feet in order to triangulate for mapping the great San Juan uplift. Mount Rhoda a 13,402 foot peak in San Juan County, CO is named for him.Mount Rhoda : Climbing, Hiking & Mountaineering : SummitPost A photography of Rhoda and A.D. Wilson on top of Sultan Mountain appears on the cover of ‚ÄúGreat Surveys of the American West‚Äù by Richard A. Bartlett. While Rhoda was assisting his father, Frederick Rhoda in operating the fruit farm during the 1870s, he was also active in many social and political causes. He wrote numerous articles \\"attacking financiers, especially stockbrokers and real estate agents...he fired equal wrath at apparently socialistic Irishmen who were organizing the labor force in California. He was particularly upset about the persecution of the Chinese and wrote detailed letters to local and national newspapers defending them. Newspapers also published his writings on nature, philsophical and political topics. Frank Rhoda was always religious and in 1880 he co- founded a Presbyterian Sunday School in Fruitvale which evolved into a full church in 1890. In 1882 he published a small book, \\"Bible Gems,\\" a collection of verses from the Old and New Testaments which he grouped into 39 key themes. In 1883 Rhoda enrolled at the San Francisco Theological Seminary, but soon dropped out to follow his own religious path which involved co-editing two religious monthlies, practicing and teaching \\"mind cure\\" an offshoot Christian Science, the \\"holiness movement,\\" street preaching/singing, co-founding a \\"Church of the New Age\\" and founding an \\"Underground Mission\\". This religious odyssey led Frank back toward traditional Protestantism and in the fall of 1887 he rejoined the Theological Seminary. He completed the program this time, but took off from May to August 1888 to travel to Japan and China as an unofficial missionary. His trip journal indicates he visited several Christian missions and schools in each country and tried to convert people to Christianity throughout the trip. During the trip his mind and daily thoughts were primarily focused on God and religion. Unfortunately, upon returning to San Francisco nobody could disembark as the ship was placed in quarantine because two passengers had smallpox. In 1889, he was officially ordained as a Presbyterian minister and served as pastor for the Memorial Presbyterian Church in South San Francisco for three years. In 1890 he married Clare Rebecca ‚ÄúBessie‚Äù Williams 15 years his junior and daughter of his landlady, who had helped him establish the ‚ÄúChurch of the New Age.‚Äù The couple had ten children and spent most of their married life in Fruitvale near his boyhood home. He did not manage financial matters well and felt that money was the root of all evil. He renounced several mortgages bequeathed to him and sold off portions of the land he inherited to support his ten children. Fortunately, his half-brother A.D. Wilson provided him with a stipend during the latter days of his life. Frank Rhoda served as pastor in the Bay Area for about 25 years, including 17 years at the Presbyterian Church in Fruitvale, which he had organized as a Sunday school in 1880. He injected evangelical enthusiasm into his pastorships by ‚Äúpreaching twice on Sundays, leading prayer meetings before regular services, and also on Wednesday evenings, instituting evening song services scores of times during each year, and by inviting other evangelists to preach.\\" He reached out to numerous ethnic groups including Blacks, Chinese, Mexicans and Native Americans. Rhoda was an active prohibitionist. In 1901, he was instrumental in getting the Alameda county supervisors to close five drinking establishments in the community. Franklin Rhoda was the 1903 Prohibition Party candidate for Supervisor of the Alameda‚Äôs 2nd district and in 1913 he was a speaker at the Women's Christian Temperance Union of Alameda County. He also actively opposed smoking, gambling and prostitution. Rhoda retired 1918 and lived out his life in his house on Lincoln Avenue (named for his son Lincoln Rhoda) in Fruitvale. He remained active in retirement continuing his religious convictions and interest in nature, local history and civic affairs. Rhoda‚Äôs philosophy and knowledge were based on personal insights and direct experience, he was ‚Äúsuspicious of professors, book learning, and the specialization of experts‚Äù and he \\"laughed at evolution, but just as ruthlessly made fun of creationists.\\" Bibliography * Summits to Reach: An Annotated Edition of Franklin Rhoda's Report on the Topography of the San Juan Country, Rhoda, Franklin.

Salim Lawzi, alternatively written Salim El-Lozi or Salim Al-Lawzi, died after being kidnapped on 25 February 1980, brutally tortured and murdered. His body was found on 4 March 1980. Neither precise date of death nor the identity of killers was revealed. But it was widely suspected that the assassination was ordered and/or executed by the Syrian Intelligence.Al Mustakbal: ÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿÆÿ®ÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™ - ÿ≥Ÿàÿ±Ÿäÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿØÿßÿ¶ÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßÿ™ŸáÿßŸÖ ŸÖŸÜÿ∞ ÿßÿ∫ÿ™ŸäÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ™ŸÜŸä ÿ≠ÿ™Ÿâ ÿ™ŸàŸäŸÜŸä Lawzi had established a number of publications, and most notably the Lebanese Al Hawadeth magazine () which he had turned into one of the biggest and most prominent pan-Arab political weekly publications. Early life and education Lawzi was born in Tripoli, Lebanon in 1922 and had his studies at Sanayeh school in Beirut. Career Lawzi travelled to Jaffa, Palestine in the early 1940s for better opportunities. In 1944 he became a radio journalist in Near East Radio () where he wrote radio plays. In the late 1940s, he quit the radio to start writing for the famous Egyptian Rose al-Y≈´suf (). He had to return to Beirut, Lebanon after criticizing the Egyptian Prime Minister and started writing for Lebanese As Sayyad () weekly. After the 23 July Revolution in Egypt, he worked in Al Goumhour al Gadeed () and correspondent to two very prominent publications namely Al Musawwar () and Al Kawakeb (). Becoming a renowned pan- Arab journalist and writer, he founded his own weekly, Al Hawadeth () after buying an existing licence of the same name. In 1957, it took the side of opposition to the Lebanese government during the rule of President Camille Chamoun, and because of his criticism was jailed and his magazine temporarily suspended in May 1957. He returned after release launching his weekly into a prominent pan-Arab weekly. With the Lebanese Civil War of 1975, his criticism of the Syrian role in Lebanon escalated leading to serious threats on his life. The Hawadeth main building was destroyed during the war. Fearing for his life due to the threats he was receiving, Lawzi chose self-exile in London, from where he continued editing his magazine. He particularly criticized harshly the Syrian interference in Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War. Death When his mother died in February 1980, Lawzi decided to return to Lebanon to attend her funeral. Despite close friends and relatives strongly advising him not to, he refused to listen and decided to return to Lebanon for a few days. After descending in Beirut International Airport, he was kidnapped by gunmen on the Airport Road on 25 February 1980. His heavily bruised tortured body was found nine days later on 4 March 1980 in Aramoun, on the outskirts of Beirut. Forensic reports found heavy signs of torture, including a broken and dislocated right arm, maimed and disjointed writing hand, fingers burnt and blackened through use of acid and phosphoric substances, pens pierced into abdomen and intestines (obvious messages in mutilation for other critics of Syria) and an assassination-style bullet in the head. Alleged perpetrator was the Syrian intelligence agents. Salim Lawzi was a brilliant journalist and considered a martyr of the press journalism after his murder.

The Chadakoin lies entirely in Chautauqua County in Western New York in the United States. The stream drains an area of , covering much of Chautauqua County. The creek begins at the southern end of Chautauqua Lake. Its watershed is bounded to the north by the Chautauqua Ridge, a continental divide that results in the water flowing eventually to the Gulf of Mexico rather than the nearby Great Lakes. History Little is known about the indigenous population around the river prior to the 17th century; it was likely inhabited by either the Erie or the Wenro. √âtienne Br√ªl√©, the first European to explore the area, did not document what tribes lived there at the time he passed through in 1615. The Seneca people, of the Iroquois League, invaded the region in the 1650s as part of the Beaver Wars. The Chadakoin was part of their water route system that connected the Great Lakes and Canada with Pennsylvania and destinations further south. The first recorded European exploration of the Chadakoin was by Pierre Joseph C√©loron de Blainville. To strengthen France's claim to the Ohio Valley, C√©loron carried out an expedition in the summer of 1749. The expedition from Montreal landed on the shore of Lake Erie, at the mouth of Chautauqua Creek in present-day Westfield, New York. The expedition carried their boats and equipment overland to Chautauqua Lake, then followed the Chadakoin River and Conewango Creek to the Allegheny River, reaching it on July 29, 1749. The site for Jamestown was chosen in the early 1800s on the Chadakoin as a source of water power for mills. Later, flat bottomed boats brought manufactured goods from downstream to the growing village. Jamestown's mills shipped lumber downstream. Upstream traffic stopped about 1825 and by 1840 downstream commerce had ended. As Jamestown became more populated, the area around the Chadakoin became the industrial core of the city. The river, especially below Warner Dam, was hidden by factories and sections of the river were covered by buildings. Neglected, the river became polluted and its banks were littered with trash. The first few miles of the river, from Chautauqua Lake to Jamestown at the Fairmount Avenue bridge, are locally referred to as \\"The Outlet\\" and have been continuously used for water recreation, such as boating, canoeing and kayaking. The marsh areas along this length of the Chadakoin hold many birds and other animals. The revitalization of the riverfront that runs through Jamestown has received more attention recently, with the goal of increasing public access to the Chadakoin River by creating small parks and a pedestrian trail along the river. Recent cleanup efforts and the demolition of abandoned factory buildings have opened up the Chadakoin below Warner Dam to limited kayaking. Historically, the river has been dyed green for Saint Patrick's Day celebrations in the city, a tradition that ended after the 2012 event due to budget cuts. The dyeing of the river resumed in 2018. The Greater Jamestown Riverwalk is a series of parks and hiking trails along the Chadakoin River in the City of Jamestown. Course Flowing entirely within Chautauqua County, New York, the Chadakoin River begins by emptying Chautauqua Lake at Celoron. It then flows generally eastward through the City of Jamestown to Falconer where it is joined by a major tributary, Cassadaga Creek, east of Jamestown in Levant, in the town of Ellicott, New York. The river then flows south to Frewsburg where it empties into the Conewango Creek, which then flows southward into Pennsylvania and joins the Allegheny River at the city of Warren, Pennsylvania. River modifications Warner Dam, at Washington Street in Jamestown, controls the level of Chautauqua Lake and the flow of the Chadakoin. There is a weir at Buffalo Street in Jamestown. There are several other river modifications. There is the former raceway that was abandoned that flowed through downtown Jamestown being diverted west of Main street flowing under Main street and buildings to power the Broadhead Mills. Also, there are many retaining walls along the river including 2nd street, railroad tracks from main to institute st, building on institute street, parking lot for St.James church, The former Artone building, Former Crescent Tool building, A break wall or former wier near Winsor St., Rear of building on Willard st., Webber Knapp building, walls at former Dahlstrom building, Break wall or partial wier at Hopkins Ave. There are other obstructions in the village of Falconer.

The German term used for this was Kinderlandverschickung (KLV), a short form of Verschickung der Kinder auf das Land (\\"relocation of children to the countryside\\"). Background The term Kinderlandverschickung (KLV) was used from the late 19th century for Erholungsverschickung (\\"recreational deportation\\") of sick and underprivileged children to foster care in the country.Keim, p394. From 1916, the Reichszentrale Landaufenthalt f√ºr Stadtkinder (Reich Central Office Country Residence for City Children) coordinated country holidays for city children, usually of around ten to fourteen years of age for a duration of up to three weeks. Around 488,000 children were sent in 1923 and 650,000 in 1934. From May 1933 the responsibility for the scheme was transferred to National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV). Evacuation from air raids KLV children taking \\"special leave\\" from Berlin. At the outbreak of World War II, there were no large scale evacuation of civilians in Germany as there was in Britain. From early 1940, KLV was extended to children under the age of 10 but participation was voluntary. Adolf Hitler personally intervened following the Royal Air Force bombing of Berlin on 24 September 1940, instructing the evacuation of children from areas at risk of bombing.Kock, pp76-82. On 27 September of that year, Martin Bormann wrote in a confidential memo: The NSV organised the relocation of mothers with children up to 3 years of age (later raised to 6 years), with or without older siblings, and some pregnant women to host families in safer areas . An estimated 202,000 mothers with 347,000 children were relocated by special trains up to the middle of 1942.Kock, p143. The NSV also organised the relocation of younger children aged 3 to 10 to host families and the transport arrangements for children of all ages to stay with relatives in safer areas. The relocation of children aged between 10 and 14 was the responsibility of the Hitler Youth. The Reichsdienststelle KLV (Reich KLV Office) provided overall coordination. The term Evakuierung (\\"evacuation\\") was avoided and the terms Unterbringungsaktion (\\"housing action\\") and Erweiterter (\\"Extended\\") KLV were used instead. However the SS reported the public was using terms such as \\"evacuation of endangered cities\\" and \\"disguised forced evacuation\\". KLV was extended to Essen, Cologne and D√ºsseldorf and areas of Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony and Westphalia. By the start of 1941, 382,616 children and young people, including 180,000 from Berlin and Hamburg, had been sent to safer areas of Bavaria, Saxony and Prussia by 1,631 special trains and 58 boats. Around half were sent to host families and half to 2,000 KLV camps.Gehrken, p16. Relocations peaked in July 1941 with 171,079 relocated that month. By April 1942, around 850,000 had been evacuated. From 1941, the list of safer areas was expanded to include parts of Austria, Pomerania, Silesia, Sudetenland and Reichsgau Wartheland. Some children of \\"proper attitude and performance\\" were sent to Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Denmark to \\"take the German reputation abroad\\".B√∂ge, Deide- L√ºchow and Morgenland, p72. The German leadership was expecting a swift victory and initially children were not expected to be away for more than a few weeks. Children started returning to their parents after six months. In mid-1941, parents were advised that children would be away for six to nine months and earlier repatriation was prohibited.Kock, p172. This was extended unless parents expressly objected. The total number of evacuations is unknown as Reichsdienststelle KLV documents were destroyed at the end of the war but Otto W√ºrschinger, a senior official in the Hitler Youth, wrote that by 1943 the total operation comprised about 3 million children and young people, including 1 million in KLV camps.Hermand, xxv. Postwar estimates frequently cite the figure of 2.8 million evacuations in total,Kock, p138.Dabel, ix-x. although one estimate puts the figure as high as 5 million. Organization Ultimate responsibility was with the Reichsdienststelle KLV, under the direction of the Reichsjugendf√ºhrer. Baldur von Schirach appointed Stabsf√ºhrer Helmut M√∂ckel, his deputy and a member of the Reichstag, to oversee the day- to-day operation. As was the case with the polycratic organizational structure of National Socialist institutions, there was considerable overlap of responsibility with the NSV, the Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Popular Culture, and the National Socialist Teachers League.Kock, p14. Selection of participants Initially, children of \\"German blood\\" were accepted provided they were not suffering from infectious diseases. Children suffering from epilepsy and chronic enuresis were subsequently rejected, as were \\"maladjusted antisocial youths\\".B√∂ge, Deide-L√ºchow and Morgenland, p171. Children covered by the Nuremberg Laws were excluded. Mischling of the second degree (children with one Jewish grandparent) were initially excluded, but this was relaxed in November 1943.Kressel, p190. Accommodation=Host families= Most mothers with young children were housed with host families. The host family received some additional public holidays as well as increased food rations. Financial compensation was provided from 1943.Kock, p111. Children aged 6 to 10 were generally housed with foster families. The initial relocation was planned for six months but was usually extended several times. The host family was provided with an additional ration card and an allowance of 2 Reichsmarks per day. Children with foster families attended local schools. Children also were sent to ethnic German or pro-German host families in Denmark, Latvia, Croatia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Poland.Hermand, p13. =Relatives= A large number of children were sent to stay with relatives in safer areas. These arrangements were made privately but the NSV arranged for transport by special trains. Staying with relatives became more popular later in the war, particularly with those who rejected the ideology of KLV camps or who rejected state evacuation on principle.Kressel, pp225-226. =KLV camps= Flag raising at a KLV camp About 9,000 KLV camps were established throughout safer areas of the Reich, including Austria, Sudetenland, Reichsgau Wartheland and Bohemia-Moravia. The size varied from as few as 18 children to as many as 1,200 children. Camps were established in hotels, hostels, monasteries, remote schools and in some cases converted warehouses. Children were grouped by gender and age with each group placed under the supervision of a teacher. The camp director was also a teacher. For leisure activities, children were divided into groups of up to 45 under the direction of a Hitler Youth team leader. The daily routine was strictly regulated by the Reichsdienststelle KLV which published a 61-page manual of instructions. It was based the same regime of order, discipline and obedience as military training and used military jargonB√∂ge, Deide-L√ºchow and Morgenland, p172. and children were required to wear KLV uniforms. Children were woken at 06:30 after which they would wash, clean their dormitories and report any health problems. Breakfast was after a flag-raising ceremony at 07:30. Academic education was provided from 08:00 to 12:00. There was a one- hour rest period after lunch, followed by Hitler Youth activities, learning practical outdoor skills, outdoor games, sports and evening entertainment such as music and newsreels. Children were normally in bed at 21:00.Kock, p158. Sunday worship was permitted, but the camps were officially non-religious and were instructed in February 1941 to watch out for \\"religious counter- propaganda\\". Some former KLV children report slightly different daily routines. Older boys also received pre-military training such as marching and shooting. In October 1940, Gottlob Berger convinced Hitler that one KLV camp in every HJ Region should be for the exclusive use of the SS. By 1942 the SS was running 42 of the camps. This required around 500 SS staff, including 135 non-commissioned officers with combat experience assigned as trainers.Rempel, p188 About 90,000 youths went through the camps, but due to the recruitment quota system most were compelled to join the Army when they reached the required age. However at one camp near Linz around half the boys joined the SS. During 1942 the number of SS-run camps was significantly reduced due to the requirement of the SS for combat-ready personnel.Rempel, p189 However, in late 1942, Stabsf√ºhrer M√∂ckel and Berger convinced Hitler and Heinrich Himmler that special camps should be used specifically for pre-military training. By the middle of 1943, three KLV camps in Germany and four in occupied countries were specifically operated to train Germanic youths willing to join the Waffen-SS. In August 1944, M√∂ckel suggested that 100,000 boys in the KLV camps should be trained in \\"self-defense squads\\" to fight guerrillas around the camps. Boys from the some KLV camps were formed into HJ irregular units and issued with small arms to guard field workers against partisans. The idea never came to fruition and KLV boys aged 15 to 17 were among the 300,000 members of the HJ reserved as the third wave of the Volkssturm. However 400 boys were trained to be part of Operation Werwolf. Jost Hermand, later a professor of modern German literature and German cultural history, wrote of torturous paramilitary exercises, constant drill, a permanent intrusive indoctrination and brutalization of weaklings. Alois Pappert described it as \\"a political rape, a kind of brainwashing\\". However some children who lived in KLV camps reported little political indoctrination and recalled the time as cheerful and carefree, although overshadowed by homesickness.Keim, p154. Resistance to evacuation Despite KLV relocating children to relative safety, by 1943 KLV was becoming increasingly unpopular with parents who (correctly) expected years of separation and felt children would become alienated.Kock, p75. After the devastating air raids on Hamburg in October 1943, the SD found that of the 70,000 school age children present, only 1,400 had agreed to KLV. There was also religious opposition to KLV, notably from Clemens August Graf von Galen, Bishop of M√ºnster, who wrote in a pastoral letter that the children remained in the camps without any ecclesiastical and religious care. Repatriation Repatriation towards the end of the war was often hasty and arranged at short notice in the face of advancing Allied armies, or in some cases repatriation was prevented by fighting. In many cases trains were provided, but in some cases children were ordered to march to other camps.B√∂ge, Deide-L√ºchow and Morgenland, p212. Some camps were closed and the children hidden by local farmers, and in a few cases children escaped and made their own way home.B√∂ge, Deide-L√ºchow and Morgenland, p214. Around 4,000 children were repatriated by the Allied armies in the second half of 1945 with the remainder in the spring of 1946.B√∂ge, Deide-L√ºchow and Morgenland, p218. Effectiveness Many historians regard KLV to be largely positive, saving many children from air raids and providing them with relative safety, good food and education in difficult times, resulting in them being less burdened by traumatic experiences than those who remained in cities during heavy bombing.Dabel, p297.Kock, p19.Gehrken, p149.

Morro Solar is notable for being a site of the Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos between Peruvian and Chilean forces in 1881. Notable landmarks include an astronomical observatory and a monument to an unknown soldier. Its geological formations are rich in silver which is being extracted by several mining companies. Geography Morro Solar. Lima, Peru. Morro Solar, a cluster of hills, is roughly in elevation. It lies near Chorrillos, a southern suburb of Lima, occupying an area of . Alexander George Findlay described it as \\"a remarkable cluster of hills, standing on a sandy plain; when seen from the southward it has the appearance of an island in the shape of a quoin, sloping to the westward, and falling very abruptly in-shore; on its sea face, however, it terminates in a steep cliff, with a sandy bay on each side.\\" The sandy shore between Morro Solar and Lurin is known as Conchan Beach. The southwest point of Morro Solar is formed by the Solar Point, located from San Franscico Island and to the southwest of Callao. Its sea face terminates in a steep cliff at Codo Point with a sandy bay on each side. The northern side of Morro Solar is the Chorillos Bay which was used in the 1860s for anchoring of ships only in exceptional circumstances as the bottom of the sea consisted of hard sand, clay stones and boulders, which was upsetting the stability of the ships. The summit of the hill range provides scenic views of the Bay of Lima, the city of Lima and South Spas. Geology Geological stratification of sedimentary formation, about 140 million years old, of Morro Solar. Lima, Peru. The Morro Solar is part of the very strange topography of Lima which evolved as a result of geological readjustments. It resulted from high sea winds which shaped the rocky formations in the form of a hollow ring. The geological formation of these hills consists primarily of sedimentary outcrops (shallow marine sedimentary facies) and also of the Andean spurs located North and South of the city. The sedimentary sequence has been mapped with appropriate notes on directions and dips of the strata, faults and dykes and the interpreting geological events. The lithology of rock and other features such as oxidation, fracturing and mineralization have been recorded. The mapping has indicated three terraces with a substantial amount of boulders, at altitudes of , and near the coast, from the Quaternary Period. Quartzites, shales and sandstones from the Cretaceous and Lower Cretaceous have been reported. Dykes have outcrops of trachytic andesite, dacite and rhyodacite. One of the faults in the dykes runs north to south, another east to west, in the sedimentary rocks. =Mining= Peru has been a leading silver-producing nation (since 2008, the production was 3680 t). Silver from a newly discovered vein in Morro Solar, reported to be of high grade, is to be extracted at the Morococha mines by the Pan American Silver Corporation. According to the explorations already carried out in 2008, the Morro Solar area is reported to have silver resources of 53 million ounces (Moz). Further exploration under the Morococha Exploration programme was in progress, covering a silver-bearing vein with a continuous length of 2.5 km along a strike. History During the War of the Pacific, Morro Solar was the scene of one of the bloodiest battles, the Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos. Historical remains of uniforms and weapons have been found here and several forts were built in the vicinity. There are now monuments to the fighters; prominent among them is the \\"Monument to the Unknown Soldier\\". The new wild potato species, S. neoweberbaueri, collected by Augusto Weberbauer on Morro Solar, was named by Ludwig Wittmack in 1914. Landmarks A war monument erected on the mountain is dedicated to the \\"Unknown Soldier\\". It is a stone obelisk with a tall bronze plaque and is painted in olive green with a photo of a Peruvian soldier carrying the national flag. Bronze plaques on the sides of the base along the path leading to the site are set in low reliefs which give the allegorical narration of the history of the heroic defense of Peruvian soldiers against Chilean attack in the battles of San Juan and Miraflores. Another monument stands to Miguel Iglesias, the national hero of Peru. Museo Planetario y Observatorio del Morro Solar, a museum, planetarium and Peru's first astronomical observation center, is located on Morro Solar. It was built and run by the engineer Victor Estremadoyro, after land was donated in 1951. Since 2010, it has had a digital projection system, making it one of the most modern in the country. The museum has exhibits of modern and antique telescopes, meteorological models and pictures, civil rocketry artifacts, along with a variety of items found in the Morro from the Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos. There are also archaeological relics such as aerolites (recovered from Morro Solar) and vestiges of the pre-Inca Ichma culture, fossils of marine fauna, and samples of geological activity related to Morro's rock layers. Near to the planetarium rises a large illuminated cross, which was built with what had been pylons. It was designed as a welcome gesture for the visit of Pope John Paul II to Peru. The cross lights up at night and can be seen from long distances. Next to the cross, stands a shrine to the Virgin Mary, which is visited by faithful Catholics. A new statue of the \\"Christ of the Pacific\\" was proposed to be installed in Lima and there was controversy as to its chosen location which was earlier approved. According to the controversy raised by the Mayor of Lima, the statue would interfere with the scenic view of the Morro Solar, a heritage monument, and hence should be shifted to some other location. The statue is tall and was privately funded by Alan Garc√≠a, the President of Peru (till 2011). The statue was formally consecrated by Cardina Juan Luis Cipriani on the top of Morro Solar in 2011 when Pope Benedict XVI sent a message of greetings and blessings to the people of Peru. The statue contains 26 lights of different colours that are illuminated at night. Utilities The hills surrounding the Morro Solar contain antennas which rebroadcast TV channels and some radio stations in Lima. The transmitting station was installed with a NEC transmitter of 400W with one seg signal with live content provided by America TV.

UNAIDS estimates there to be about 15,000 prostitutes in the country. Most of these are migrants from neighbouring countries, mainly Nigeria, Togo and Ghana. Only 15% of the prostitutes are Beninese. Prostitution occurs on the streets, in bars, restaurants, hotels and brothels. With advent of the smartphone, many prostitutes use apps to make arrangements with clients. Many women enter prostitution for economic reasons. Some young Beninese women learn English so they can go to Nigeria to work as prostitutes as Nigeria has a thriving sex industry. In rural areas widows will discretely turn to prostitution to support her family. This is a cultural and social tradition that is not regarded as prostitution by the community, but is regarded as a method of preserving the family name. Any children born from these liaisons take the dead husband's name. It's not uncommon for a widow to have five children after her husband has died. HIV, sex trafficking and child sex tourism are problems in the country. Sexual health As with other sub-Saharan African countries, HIV is a problem. Sex workers are amongst the high risk groups. Clients are often soldiers and truck drivers. Because of their travelling, if they become infected, potentially they spread the infection over a wide area. In 1992, a prevention project, supported by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) was implemented among sex workers in the largest city, Cotonou. This saw condom use increase and HIV amongst sex workers fall from 53.3% in 1993 to 30.4% in 2008. The prevalence of other STIs also fell significantly in the same period: gonorrhoea 43.2 to 6.4% and chlamydia 9.4 to 2.8%. The NGO, Centre d'Etudes, de Recherches et d'Interventions pour le D√©veloppement (CERID), provides sex workers with free medical treatment and counselling. UNAIDS reported in 2016 that the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers in the country was 15.7%. Sex trafficking Benin is a source, transit, and destination country for women, children subjected to sex trafficking. Most identified victims are Beninese girls subjected to sex trafficking in Cotonou and across Benin's southern corridor. Togolese girls are exploited in commercial sex in Benin. Cases of child sex tourism involving both boys and girls along the coast and within the department of Mono have been reported in previous years. A 2016 survey conducted in the cities of Cotonou in southern Benin and Malanville in northern Benin indicated that girls are subjected to sexual exploitation, including potential sex trafficking, in these two cities. The department of Oueme in southeast Benin was reportedly a primary area of recruitment for child trafficking victims subsequently exploited in the Republic of the Congo. Most child victims intercepted in Benin, either from Benin or other West African countries, are exploited or en route to exploitation within the country. Benin is the largest source country for trafficking victims in the Republic of the Congo; Beninese victims are also subjected to trafficking in Nigeria, Gabon, and Lebanon. West African women are exploited in commercial sex in Benin. Young Beninese women are recruited from Benin by unlicensed Beninese and Lebanese recruiters for domestic work in Lebanon and Kuwait; reportedly, some are forced into commercial sex. OCPM reports that traffickers no longer travel with child victims being moved internally or to nearby countries. Victims now travel alone and are met by traffickers or their accomplices once they reach their destination. This tactic makes investigations more difficult. Existing laws do not prohibit all forms of trafficking. The 2006 Act Relating to the Transportation of Minors and the Suppression of Child Trafficking (act 2006-04) criminalizes child trafficking but focuses on movement of children rather than their ultimate exploitation and prescribes penalties of six months to two years imprisonment or fines if children are moved for the purpose of labor exploitation; these penalties are not sufficiently stringent. The penal code outlaws procuring or offering a person for prostitution and the facilitation of prostitution with punishments of six months to two years imprisonment. None of these punishments are sufficiently stringent or commensurate with punishments prescribed for other serious crimes. Comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation that would criminalize all forms of trafficking, including the trafficking of adults, has been pending MOJ review since September 2012. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Benin as a 'Tier 2' country.

Prostitution is prevalent in all areas of the country, and especially in the largest city (and former capital), Bujumbura, and prior to the security crisis in 2015, the tourist areas around Lake Tanganyika. UNAIDS estimate there are 51,00 prostitutes in Burundi. Many women have turned to prostitution due to poverty. Previously law enforcement made little effort to curb prostitution. Political pressures, including from the mayor of Bujumbura, Freddy Mbonimpa, have led to crackdowns all over the country. HIV, sex trafficking and child prostitution are problems in the country. HIV As with other sub-Saharan African countries, HIV is a problem in Burundi. Sex workers are one of the high risk groups. The Burundi Second Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project, funded by the World Bank, ran from 2008 to 2011 and worked to increase availability and use of preventive services to high risk groups. HIV prevalence rates amongst sex workers has fallen from 38% in 2007 to 21% in 2016. Sex trafficking Burundi is a source country for children and possibly women subjected to sex trafficking. Due to a complex political, economic, and security crisis in 2015, Burundi's fragile economic and security environment created an opportunity for criminals, including traffickers, to take advantage of Burundians in precarious or desperate situations. There is little official data available on abuses committed against Burundi's approximately 60,000 IDPs, 60 percent of whom are younger than age 18 and are highly vulnerable to exploitation. Between April and December 2015, approximately 70,000 Burundians refugees fled to Rwanda, which contributed to an increase in child sex trafficking of both male and female refugees in Rwanda. Burundian refugee girls residing in Rwanda's Kigeme refugee camp were reportedly exploited in sex trafficking in nearby towns. Traffickers allegedly include victims‚Äô relatives, neighbours, and friends, who recruit them under false pretences to exploit them in forced labor and sex trafficking. Children are fraudulently recruited from rural areas for domestic work and later exploited in sex trafficking, including in Bujumbura. Women offer vulnerable girls room and board within their homes, eventually pushing some into prostitution to pay for living expenses. These brothels are located in poorer areas of Bujumbura, along the lake, on trucking routes, and in other urban centers such as Ngozi, Gitega, and Rumonge. Some orphaned girls are exploited in sex trafficking, with boys acting as their facilitators, to pay for school, food, and shelter. Incarcerated women facilitate commercial sex between male prisoners and detained children within the Burundian prison system. Men from East Africa and the Middle East, as well as Burundian government employees including teachers, police officers and gendarmes, military, and prison officials, are among the clients of Burundian girls in child sex trafficking. Business people recruit Burundian girls for exploitation in sex trafficking in Bujumbura, as well as in Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, and the Middle East. In 2015, Rwandan officials and international and local NGOs reported that Burundian refugee girls were exploited in sex trafficking in Uganda after transiting Rwanda.

He has conducted operas in historically informed performance at major European opera houses and festivals, and has made award-winning recordings.  Career  Born in Lugano, Fasolis studied in Zurich, at both the Zurich Conservatory and the Musikhochschule, organ with Erich Vollenwyder, piano with J√ºrg Wintschger, voice with Carol Smith, and conducting with Klaus Knall, achieving all four diplomas with distinction. He further studied organ and organ improvisation with Gaston Litaize in Paris, and historically informed performance (HIP) with Michael Radulescu. In 1985 and 1986, he performed the complete organ works by Johann Sebastian Bach, Felix Mendelssohn and Franz Liszt. He received several international awards such as the Stresa first prize, the first prize and scholarship of the Migros-G√∂hner Foundation, the Hegar Prize, the Traetta Prize 2020, and he was a finalist in the Geneva Competition.

Three years later he became director of the ensemble , recording with them several works by Bach, George Frideric Handel and Antonio Vivaldi. His recording of Handel's Faramondo was acclaimed by critics; Margarida Mota-Bull noted that \\"I Barocchisti and the Coro della Radio Svizzera under the excellent direction of Diego Fasolis deliver a remarkably well-judged and restrained interpretation of this opera by Handel\\", and Tim Ashley wrote in The Guardian: \\"A cool, brilliant operatic game, it's devastatingly realised by Diego Fasolis and I Barocchisti\\".

He is also accredited as the inventor of a self-discharging motorized transit mixer that was the predecessor of the concrete mixer truck. Stepanian is often called the \\"father of the ready-mix concrete industry.\\" Life Of Armenian descent, Stepanian moved to Grandview Heights, Ohio, in 1906. He is credited with rescuing 13 people from a tree using a makeshift raft during the 1913 flood in Columbus, Ohio. They had been in the tree some 48 hours when Stepanian used a raft he made from floating timbers and a pole to navigate them, 2-3 at a time, to safety. He resided on Glenn Avenue near Bluff. Stepanian became president of Marble Cliff Quarries and the Central Ohio Concrete Company. Eventually, Stepanian founded the Arrow Concrete Company, a company that is still in service today. He was elected as an honorary member of the board of directors for the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association. Stepanian was honored by the 1954 National Ready Mixed Concrete Association annual convention which named him an honorary lifetime member. In 2004, Stepanian was selected as one of the Top 100 Transportation Private Sector Professionals by the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. Inventor of concrete mixing truck Stephen invented a self- discharging motorized transit mixer that was the predecessor of the concrete mixer truck and applied for a patent in 1916. However, the patent was rejected in April 1917 by the patent office because it was believed that a truck could not support the weight of a concrete mixer on top of it. The patent office also noted that there was no previous patenting information that proves integration was possible with both the mixer and the design of the truck. Other sources suggest that the patent was rejected because Stepanian was not an American citizen. However, on December 21, 1928, Stepanian reapplied for the patent and received approval on November 21, 1933.

As of February 2013, Legout is ranked no. 108 in the world by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). He is also left-handed, and uses the classic grip and Butterfly Legout blade. Table tennis career Since he became a member of the national team in 1991, Legout is considered one of France's most prominent and popular table tennis players in its sporting history. He is a multiple-time French champion in both the singles and doubles tournaments, and has won a total of ten medals (three golds and seven silver) in the same discipline at the ITTF World Tour series. Legout is previously a member of the table tennis team at the Levallois Sporting Club in Paris, before he moved to Provence to train for Istres Ouest Provence, under his personal coaches Jean Claude and St√©phane LeBrun. Legout made his official debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where he competed only in the men's doubles tournament. Legout and his partner Patrick Chila placed second in the preliminary pool round against China, Sweden, and Ghana, receiving only two victories, four winning matches, and a total score of 133 points. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Legout teamed up with two-time world bronze medalist Damien √âloi in the men's doubles tournament, where the French pair placed first in the preliminary pool round against Canada's Johnny Huang and Kurt Liu, and Argentina's Liu Song and Pablo Tabachnik, receiving four winning matches and a total score of 96 points. Legout and Eloi defeated Sweden's J√∂rgen Persson and Jan-Ove Waldner in the first round of the knock-out stage, before losing out their next match to the formidable Chinese duo Wang Liqin and Yan Sen, with a unanimous set score of 0‚Äì3. Having been chosen as one of the top 16 seeded players, Legout received a bye in the preliminary pool stage of the men's singles, before beating South Korea's Ryu Seung-min in his first match. He progressed to the second round, but lost to Belarus' Vladimir Samsonov, with a final set score of 0‚Äì3. Eight years after competing in his last Olympics, Legout qualified for his third French team, as a 35-year-old, at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, by receiving a place as one of the top 8 seeded players from the European Qualification Tournament in Nantes.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the death of the sitting Unionist MP, Norman Carlyle Craig on 14 October 1919. He had been MP here since winning the seat in January 1910. The constituency had been held by the Unionists since its creation in 1885. Electoral history At the 1918 general election, Craig was returned unopposed, having been in receipt of the Coalition 'coupon'. The result at the last contested election was Candidates right *The local Unionists adopted as candidate, 22-year-old Hon. Esmond Harmsworth. He was part of the Northcliffe-Rothermere Press family which owned newspapers such as the Daily Mail. Although adopted by the Unionists, he considered contesting the election as an 'Anti-Waste' candidate, opposed to what the Rothermere Press had labelled as excessive Coalition Government spending. However, he was persuaded to stand as an official Unionist but allowed to fight the election on a programme of measures in opposition to the Coalition Government and as a result did not receive the coalition 'coupon'. *The Liberals chose William J. West as their candidate. He had contested Winchester at the last election, coming second. West had been politically active in Battersea working for John Burns. In 1904 he served as Mayor of Battersea and was a founder of the Railway Clerks Trade Union.The Times House of Commons, 1929 Main issues and campaign At the 1918 general election, Coalition Liberal Prime Minister, David Lloyd George had famously stated that the task for the new government would be to build \\"Homes fit for Heroes\\". His plan was for the government to raise funds through taxation to allow local councils to build houses and Coalition Liberal Reconstruction Minister, Christopher Addison successfully steered through Parliament the Housing Act 1919. However, there were parts of the Unionist Party that opposed these plans including Harmsworth. Harmsworth's Anti-Waste platform of cuts in government spending and reductions in Income Tax was enthusiastically supported by The Times, the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror. He also had the active support of Horatio Bottomley, a prominent right-wing MP who had founded the People's League in opposition to the government. At an eve of poll meeting in support of Harmsworth, Bottomley proclaimed that he expected in about 2 years to be asked by the King to form a 'business administration'.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies Result As expected, the Unionists held the seat but the Liberals polled strongly. Compared to the last contested election, there had been a 9% swing to the Liberals. When Harmsworth took his seat he became the Baby of the House. Aftermath Despite Harmsworth's disappointing result, the issue of taxes/public spending continued to dominate the 1919-22 parliament and an Anti-Waste League was formed to rally right-wing opinion and contest future by-elections. The Coalition Government's Council House Building Policies continued. Bottomley was not asked to form a government by the King but was to serve at His Majesty's Pleasure for 7 years at Wormwood Scrubs. The result at the following General election; Harmsworth continued to sit for the constituency until 1929.

According to Varahmihir, this Yoga is formed when one house in front and back from the Moon are vacant. In other words, the second and the twelfth house from the Moon should be vacant so that this Yoga can be formed. This Yoga is not at all inauspicious as believed by the astrologers in the modern times. A person should not be afraid of this Yoga at all. In fact it provides strong power to a person to face all sorts of struggles in life so that he may excel and achieve success. People with this Yoga are generally seen to be excellent Generals, Ministers, Councillors, Advisors, Teachers, Professors, Coaches and highly paid & in-demand consultants. The general idea is that they may not be in 'one opinion within' for their own life but are the best people to seek advice from. For example: A person with this Yoga may not be a great soccer player being an average implementer however due to the deep knowledge of technique might guide someone to become one of the best soccer players in the Century. Most phenomenal Astrologers who have contributed to groundbreaking discoveries were born with this Yoga. It is believed that people with such type of a planetary setting, when once channelize their energy and calm the chattering mind either with meditation, yoga, mantra recitation, etc. - they can learn and store 'the entire knowledge available to humanity ever' which is what had made them great advisors & gurus throughout the history. A key distinguishing factor in such individuals is that they are theoretical gurus of all trades but average or below average implementers of that knowledge. These individuals when clubbed with an equally good implementer (who readily accepts 'a person with this Yoga' as his teacher), results in a highly successful union which is an unstoppable team in every aspect. How is Kemdaruma Yoga formed Kemadruma Yoga is formed if the second and twelfth house from the Moon are vacant. It is also formed when the Moon is not aspected by an auspicious planet or is not in association with an auspicious planet. Rahu and Ketu are not analyzed when we talk about Kemadruma Yoga. There is a misconception about Kemadruma yoga that it provides a person with a troubled life. Hence, many astrologers believe this yoga to be inauspicious. This notion is not totally true. People born in Kemadruma yoga do well in their profession. They also receive respect and appreciation in their field of work. Usually, astrologers in modern times only talk about the inauspicious effects of this yoga. But, if they start talking about the auspicious results too, people would know that due to the presence of some yogas, Kemadruma yoga is converted into Raj yoga. Therefore, while analyzing a person‚Äôs natal chart, it is important to observe the yogas which neutralise Kemadruma yoga. Cancellation of Kemadruma Yoga According to some shastras, if there is a planet conjunct, or in the second, twelfth or ninth houses from the Moon, Kemadruma yoga is cancelled. Kemadruma yoga is also cancelled if Moon is in the sign of an auspicious planet. Mercury, Jupiter and Venus are considered to be auspicious planets and confer such results. Remedies for Kemadruma Yoga Remedies may help in decreasing the effects of Kemadruma Yoga. Remedies also increase the auspicious effects of Kemdruma Yoga. These are : * Fast on the day of Purnima for four consecutive years. Begin this fast from a Purnima which is on Monday or from the day of Chitra nakshatra when it is on Monday. * Visit a temple on Mondays and pour a cow‚Äôs milk on Shivalinga and worship lord Shiva. Worship Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Recite ‚ÄòOm Namah Shivaya‚Äô with a Rudraksha mala. * Keep a Dakshinavarti shell in the house and read Sri Suktam regularly. Keep water in this shell and pour it on an idol of Goddess Lakshmi. Wear a Sri Yantra made of silver with a pearl in it. * Chant Mahamrityunjaya mantra 108 times on your birthday. https://astrobix.com/astrosight/Post/156 References Yogas ","title":"Kemadruma yoga"},{"id":"38654296","text":"The \\"Cordoba Near Eastern Research Unit\\" (CNERU), is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary unit of the Faculty of Humanities of the University of C√≥rdoba (Spain), which offers undergraduate and graduate courses and seminars related to all areas of Near and Middle Eastern Studies and seeks to foster knowledge of Near and Middle Eastern societies from the ancient period to the modern times.

In 1981, he founded Art & Text, the contemporary art journal considered to be responsible for generating and promoting postmodernist discourse in Australian art.  Life  Taylor was born in 1957 in Melbourne, Australia. He completed a Bachelor of Arts (Hons.) at Monash University, Melbourne in 1979, studying under Patrick McCaughey (founder of the Visual Arts department at Monash University) with fellow students including Jenepher Duncan and Jan Minchin. In 1981, Taylor founded the contemporary Australian art journal Art & Text. He curated the landmark exhibition 'Popism' in 1982 at the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, and, the following year, the smaller though equally significant 'Tall Poppies' at the University of Melbourne Gallery. In 1984, Taylor edited and published an anthology of criticism titled Anything Goes: Art in Australia 1970‚Äì1980. In the same year, Taylor invited Sydney theorist and critic Paul Foss to edit Art & Text when Taylor planned to move to New York. Taylor established himself there as an art journalist, writing for Vanity Fair, Interview, Parkett, Flash Art and The New York Times. In 1988, he curated the exhibition Impresario: Malcolm McLaren and the British New Wave for the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York. In 1992, Taylor returned to Melbourne, where he died from AIDS-related lymphoma. In 2012, Taylor was the subject of the symposium Impresario: Paul Taylor, Art & Text POPISM at Monash University. A book, based on the symposium, was published in 2013.  Art & Text  Taylor's journal Art & Text presented a new vision for Australian art that was grounded in the translation, interpretation and application of French poststructuralist theory to contemporary art. In 1983, issue 11 included the first English translation of Jean Baudrillard‚Äôs essay \\"The Precession of Simulacra\\". Taylor maintained an enduring commitment to New Wave sub-culture and its subsequent theorisation by sociologists such as Dick Hebdige. Notably influential on Taylor's thinking was Hebdige's book 1979 book, Subculture: The Meaning of Style. Under Taylor's editorship, Art & Text worked closely with contemporary artists to publish both their writings and their artworks in the form of artist pages. These artists included Imants Tillers, John Nixon, Maria Kozic, Peter Tyndall, Howard Arkley, David Chesworth, Philip Brophy, Juan Davila and Vivienne Shark LeWitt among others. Following a symposium organised by Monash University's MUMA\\"Symposium: Paul Taylor\\", Monash University, 2012. in September 2012, a plan to produce a book about Taylor was announced. In December 2013, Helen Hughes and Nicholas Croggon released Impresario: Paul Taylor, The Melbourne Years, 1981-1984.\\"Impresario: Paul Taylor, The Melbourne Years, 1981‚Äì1984\\", Monash University, 2013.

The denomination adopted the Westminster Confession of Faith as its official confession along with the Apostles Creed.www.apmt.org.br/index.php/central-de- noticias/1073-safs-enviam-2250-biblias-para-angola Organisation of the denomination follows the Presbyterian church government, local congregations, presbyteries, synods, and the highest level is the General Assembly.

In January 2014 Rev Rondinho Antonio Bento said that reinforced house to house evangelisation will continue to help youth to life a socially useful life.  Recent issues  In early 2011 the Independent Presbyterian Church in Angola and the Christian Presbyterian Church in Angola teamed up with the Presbyterian Church in Angola (IPA). The integration of the denomination into one is a result of a long period of dialogue. Both Christian denomination took this decision because they understand that the Presbyterian Church in Angola is a large community not only in Angola, but internationally. Regard to its evolution there was a need of reunification, to integrate everything into one single denomination. The Independent Presbyterian Church in Angola and the Presbyterian Christian Church in Angola integrated with all of their congregations, pastors, elders and deacons into the Presbyterian Church in Angola. This effort was supported by the PC in Angola. The President of the Generas Synod of IPA said that : \\" The IPA are open to welcome all who are open to and want to a union, to serve better the Lord. The Presbyterian community become stronger in Angola.he pastor Rondinho Antonio Bento, president of the IPA General Synod, he said, in the worship of reception that sealed the integration of these two communities, \\"Now we are great in number and solid in our structures.\\" He said that the IPA, the name that drives will work with two other Presbyterian churches that until very recently acted in isolation. And invited them to follow suit, to create a Presbyterian community increasingly united. Also according to the pastor Rondinho Antonio Bento, the IPA's doors are open to welcome in its midst all those who understand the need for unity, where efforts lead all members to better serve the Lord in the church.\\"  Seminary  The Presbyterian Church in Angola with the partnership with the Transcultural Presbyterian Mission Agency of the Presbyterian Church of Brazil built a Seminary building in the end of 2012 in Luanda, Angola. This building sits in a 660 m high area.

An estimated 19 people, who were mostly labourers working in the market were killed in the accident. Initial reports indicate the fire might have been initiated by a short circuit in the first floor of the market. The other major fire accidents in Kolkata are the 2011 AMRI hospital fire accident that killed 90 people and 2018 Bagri Market fire in which no people were killed but lasted for 4 days which destroyed nearly 1000 shops. The accident The Surya Sen street market was an illegal market operating in the area of Surya Sen street. An estimated 19 people, who were mostly labourers working in the market were killed in the accident, and 17 people were admitted to the hospital in critical condition. Most of the people who were killed in the accident were shopkeepers and labourers who stayed overnight in the market. The accident occurred at around 3:50 in the morning. The rescue operations took nearly 3 hours for the 20 fire tenders who fought the fire. The rescue operations were hampered by smoke in the narrow lanes leading to the fire and in the only exit available in the building. Eyewitness have alleged that the fire brigade were late and the rescue operations were delayed as gas masks and gas cutters were not brought along. Initial reports suggest that fire might have been initiated by a fire in the eatery. The market fire is the second major one in Kolkata after the 2011 AMRI hospital fire accident that killed 90 people. The Hon'ble Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee, admitted lapses on implementing the fire safety steps from the 2011 incident. The Chief Minister of the state, Mamata Banerjee visited the site afterwards. Post accident In the aftermath of the fire, the market was closed for entry for days. The shop owners were allowed to set up temporary shops on the pavements adjoining the market. While the exact value of losses of the shop owners are not known, it is inferred that many of the small shop owners have lost their lifetime savings in the fire. Many of them were reported to be on the lookout for alternate employment and seeking relief from the state government.

As of February 2013, Eloi is ranked no. 88 in the world by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). He is also right-handed, and uses the attacking grip and Tibhar 4S blade. Table tennis career Since he became a member of the national team in 1990, Eloi is considered one of France's top-level table tennis players in its sporting history. He is a multiple-time French champion in both the singles and doubles tournaments, and has won a total of seven medals (one gold, five silver, and one bronze) in the same discipline at the ITTF World Tour series. Playing with four-time Olympian Jean-Philippe Gatien (1988‚Äì2000), Eloi had won two bronze medals in the men's doubles at the 1995 and 1997 World Table Tennis Championships, held in Tianjin, China, and in Manchester, England, respectively. Eloi is previously a member of the table tennis team at the Levallois Sporting Club in Paris, before he moved to Chartres to train for Chartres Table Tennis Sports Association (). Eloi made his official debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where he competed only in the men's doubles tournament. Eloi and his partner Jean-Philippe Gatien won the preliminary pool round against Poland, Nigeria, and New Zealand, receiving only three victories and a total score of 143 points. The French pair, however, lost the quarterfinal match to the Chinese duo L√º Lin and Wang Tao, with a set score of 1‚Äì3. At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Eloi and Gatien repeated their position in the men's doubles tournament, when the French pair lost for the second time to former West German duo and Olympic silver medalists J√∂rg Ro√ükopf and Steffen Fetzner in the quarterfinal match, receiving a unanimous set score of 0‚Äì3. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Eloi teamed up with new partner Christophe Lego√ªt in the men's doubles tournament, where the French pair placed first in the preliminary pool round against Canada's Johnny Huang and Kurt Liu, and Argentina's Liu Song and Pablo Tabachnik, receiving four winning matches and a total score of 96 points. Eloi and Legout defeated Sweden's J√∂rgen Persson and Jan-Ove Waldner in the first round of the knock-out stage, before losing out their next match to the formidable Chinese duo Wang Liqin and Yan Sen, with a unanimous set score of 0‚Äì3. Being chosen as one of the top 16 seeded players, Eloi received a bye in the preliminary pool stage of the men's singles, before beating South Korea's Lee Chul-Seung in his first match. He progressed to the second round, but narrowly lost to China's Liu Guoliang, with a final set score of 2‚Äì3. Eight years after competing in his last Olympics, Eloi qualified for his fourth French team, as a 38-year-old, at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, by receiving an allocated spot from the Final World Qualification Tournament in Budapest, Hungary.

History  On November 11, 1880, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (now the United Church of Christ in the USA) and the Congregational Church in Canada sent missionaries and began to evangelize in the highlands of Angola. The leaders of this mission were the Rev. William W. Bagster, the Rev. William Henry Sanders and the Rev. Samuel Taylor Miller (the first black African missionary in Angola). In 1940, a theological school was established to train pastors and ministers. This resulted in significant growth and development in the church. In 1957, the work of the North American Congregational Churches was united and the Council of Evangelical Churches in Angola was founded. In 1975, after the country had gained independence, The Angolan Civil War broke out. The war devastated Angola's infrastructure and severely damaged the nation's public administration, economic enterprises and religious institutions. The war forced foreign missionaries to leave the country. The church was divided into two parts; rural and urban. During and after the war, the church remained divided into the Evangelical Congregational Church in Angola and the Evangelical Reformed Church in Angola. The Church Today The headquarters of the church is in Huambo. The fast-growing denomination is present in 16 of the 18 Angolan Provinces. It has 60 primary and secondary schools and a medical program. The Evangelical Congregational Church in Angola is the second oldest Protestant denomination in Angola. It trains ministers in the Interdenominational Seminary in Huambo. The church has approximately 1,000,000 members in 2,800 congregations across the country.

As a result, PEDELTA have designed a slender pedestrian structure; a pure minimalist solution. The bridge main span is 58.4 m. The structural system is a weathering steel frame with only one span, embedded on both ends into the concrete abutments.  Description  The bridge comprises a 3.5 m wide deck and it is characterized for being a weathering steel box girder of variable height between 0.6 m (L/97) at middle span and 1.7 m (L/34) at supports. The steel hand rail has been conceived to be part of the main structure. Civil engineering mention award (2¬∫ Prize) in Construmat Exhibition for the Sant Feliu footbridge design in Girona (2000). This bridge was also selected for the FAD Awards (1997) and Eduardo Torroja Awards (1999).  Construction  The steel girder was prefabricated in three segments. The three pieces were lifted to their final position, using two auxiliary supports, and finally welded together. Thereafter, the two concrete abutments were cast in place to complete the final structure.  References  Sobrino J.A; , Spain.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees requested Norwegian authorities to provide personnel with experience from working in emergency situations. The Norwegian Foreign Ministry agreed to establish and fund a standby roster, while the Norwegian Refugee Council was given the task of building, managing and developing the roster further. The Norwegian Refugee Council also established a set of regional standby forces ‚Äì NORAFRIC, NORMIDEAST and NORASIA ‚Äì with personnel from Africa, the Middle East and Asia. In 2009, the various standby rosters, NORSTAFF, NORAFRIC, NORMIDEAST, NORASIA and the observer roster NOROBS, merged under the name NORCAP (Norwegian capacity to international operations).

Biography  Rodolphe Marchais began his career in the Group in 1982. He has held different positions, starting in the Group as Paris Orly Hub Manager, then as Network Manager of TAT‚Äôs express parcel subsidiary, TAT Express. In 1986, he became CEO of Chronopost, a start up joint venture between TAT and the French Post Office specialising in express mail. Chronopost became a very successful business with the powerful leverage of 12 000 offices of the French Post. By 1988, Rodolphe MARCHAIS was CEO of TAT Express and had achieved a good profitability of this business for TAT. In 1990, he became the CEO of TAT European Airlines, the biggest subsidiary of TAT Group and participated in convincing British Airways to become a shareholder of this company which was operating the first private French domestic and European network. In 1996, when TAT Group sold all its shareholding in the airline and express parcel businesses, Rodolphe MARCHAIS became President & CEO of TAT Group, replacing Michel MARCHAIS, his father and founder of the Group. From that moment on, with Rodolphe Marchais at its head, TAT Group focused on its leasing and aircraft maintenance activities, through its subsidiaries, TAT leasing and Sabena technics. In a decade, TAT Group increased its maintenance activity and took part in a concentration movement in a fragmented market: it acquired successively AOM Industries in 2000, Sabena technics (at the time maintenance subsidiary of the Belgian National Airline) in 2005 and EADS Sogerma Services as well as EADS Barfield in 2007, making his subsidiary, Sabena technics, the world‚Äôs third largest independent MRO. Today, Sabena technics has all the necessary skills and agreements to perform maintenance on a large range of narrow and wide-body aircraft (Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Embraer, ATR,‚Ä¶) and has developed a very specific skill to perform maintenance in operational condition on different countries‚Äô fleets, representing today 40% of its activity. TAT leasing, based in Ireland, pursued its development by investing in a regional aircraft fleet ‚Äì essentially ATRs ‚Äì which is placed in operational leasing through different operators worldwide. Thus, the company acquired more than 50 ATRs and also offers assistance services for sales, purchases, leasing as well as technical and financial database management. Since 2006, still under the leadership of Rodolphe Marchais, TAT Group undertook the construction of offices intended for leasing and developed a 50 000 m¬≤ real estate stock, added to 255 000 m¬≤ of technical facilities occupied by its subsidiary Sabena technics.

He was the most liberal of the first generation of bishops after the 1940 Concordat. He is famous for having openly criticised, in the name of the social doctrine of the church, both forced labour and forced cultivation in Mozambique. In the 1960s he leaned towards the idea that Mozambique should become independent. Biography Sebasti√£o Soares de Resende was born in 1906 in Milheir√≥s de Poiares, in Northern Portugal. He entered in 1923 and the Major Seminary of Oporto in 1926. He was ordained in 1928, after which he went to Rome at the Gregorian University where did a doctorate in Philosophy.C. A.

He entered the diocese in December 1943 and stayed there until his death in 1967. The Bishop led a massive expansion of the Catholic church in Beira. Aside numerous missions and schools (paid for by the Portuguese state who had outsourced education for Africans to the Catholic church), Dom Sebasti√£o created a newspaper, the Di√°rio de Mo√ßambique.Jos√© Capela, \\"Para a hist√≥ria do Di√°rio de Mo√ßambique\\", Arquivo. Boletim do Arquivo Hist√≥rico de Mo√ßambique, n¬∫ 6 (1989), pp. 177-180 From 1943, Dom Sebasti√£o wrote yearly pastoral letters which gained much readership and influence. His pastoral letters of 1948 and 1949, entitled Ordem comunista e Ordem anticomunista, exposed the social doctrine of the Church and on that basis criticised forced labour and forced cultivation in Mozambique.re- published in S. Soares de Resende, Profeta em Mo√ßambique, Linda-a-Velha : DIFEL, 1994 Because of his public criticism, Dom Sebasti√£o got into trouble with the colonial authorities several times. His pastoral letter was prevented from circulating in 1949 and his newspaper was suspended several times in the 1960s because of its critical stance in relation to colonialism. Dom Sebasti√£o led and managed his diocese very successfully, even after the start of the liberation war in 1964 deeply divided his diverse clergy - White Fathers, Franciscans, Burgos fathers, etc. After his death in 1967, the diocese entered a period of turmoil as Dom Sebasti√£o's successors failed to repeat his even hand.Eric Morier-Genoud, The Catholic Church, religious orders and the making of politics in colonial Mozambique: The case of the diocese of Beira 1940-197, PhD dissertation, State University of New York at Binghamton, 2006, ch.5 Dom Sebasti√£o is fondly remembered in Beira, and Mozambique more generally, to this very day.

Billion tonne-kilometres of rail freight moved in the UK from 1983 to 2019.https://dataportal.orr.gov.uk/media/1456/freight-moved- table-137.xlsx The railway network in Great Britain has been used to transport goods of various types and in varying volumes since the early 19th century. Network Rail, which owns and maintains the network, aims to increase the amount of goods carried by rail. In 2015-16 Britain's railways moved 17.8 billion net tonne kilometres, a 20% fall compared to 2014-15.Office of Rail Regulation, http://orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/22008/freight-rail- usage-2015-16-quarter-4.pdf Coal accounted for 13.1% of goods transport in Britain, down considerably from previous years. There are no goods transported by railway in Northern Ireland. History= Pre-19th century = Even in the 16th century, mining engineers used crude wooden rails to facilitate the movement of mine wagons steered by hand. In Nottingham, 1603, a tramway was constructed to transport coal from mines near Strelley to Wollaton. Horse- drawn lines were increasingly common by the 18th and early 19th centuries, chiefly to haul bulk materials from mines to canal wharves or areas of consumption.A goods train hauled by a LNWR Class C locomotive, passing through Crewe in 1907 =19th century= The world's first steam locomotive engine was demonstrated by Richard Trevithick in 1804. Steam powered rail freight operated regularly on the Middleton Railway, near Leeds, long before any passenger services. Many of the early railways of Britain carried goods, including the Stockton and Darlington Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The LMR was originally intended to carry goods between the Port of Liverpool and east Lancashire, although it subsequently developed as mixed passenger-goods railway. The network expanded rapidly as small private firms rushed to build new lines. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained (see Railway mania). The Post Office began using letter-sorting carriages in 1838, and the railway quickly proved to be a much quicker and more efficient means of transport than the old mail coaches. It was estimated in 1832 that using the LMR to transport mail between the two cities reduced the expense to the government by two-thirds. It was also much faster to send newspapers across Great Britain. =Early 20th century= The First World War was dubbed the \\"Railway War\\" at the time. Indeed, thousands of tonnes of munitions and supplies were distributed from all over Great Britain to ports in the South East of England for shipping to France and the Front Line. Due to pre-war inefficiencies in the rail goods transport, a number of economisation programmes were needed to allow the railways to meet with the huge demand that was being put on their services. The Common User Agreement for wagon usage and regulation of coal services through the Coal Transport Act of 1917 are examples of such programmes, which enabled better utilisation of railway assets across the industry. The success of such schemes was entirely down to the collaboration of more than 100 railway companies, who abandoned the fierce competition of the pre-war years to work together in the national interest. In no sector was this more obvious than in rail goods transport. During the Second World War, vast quantities of materials were moved around Britain by rail. During the early stages of the war, goods trains ran to rural stations in Norfolk to enable airfields to be constructed. In 1944, 500 special trains ran every day on the network and over a million wagons were controlled by the government's Inter-Company Freight Rolling Stock Control organisation. A pre-World War II LMS Fowler Class 4F steam locomotive hauling a mixed freight train at Carnforth in 1964 Beer was a major rail-hauled commodity, but gradually switched to the improving road network. The complex network of brewery railways in Burton upon Trent became disused by 1970. Likewise, milk was widely transported by rail until the late 1960s. The last Milk Tank Wagons ran in 1981. =Nationalisation era= Britain's railways were nationalised in 1947 including goods operations. Under the 1955 British Rail Modernisation Plan, massive investment was made in marshalling yards at a time when the use of small wagon load traffic with which they dealt was in steep decline. Railway freight services had been in steady decline since the 1930s, initially because of the loss of the manufacturing industry and then road haulage's cost advantage in combination with higher wages. By 1959 it was realised that the Modernisation Plans were not working. The wagon load traffic lost ¬£57 million on receipts of ¬£105 million in 1961. Signal boxes would have to be manned 24 hours a day in order to accept a limited amount of traffic. Even the most rural stations transported goods in the form of postal services; 3,368 stations generated only 4% of Royal Mail's receipts. The Beeching cuts included a reduction in freight services, especially the marshalling yards, to concentrate on long distance bulk transport. In contrast to passenger services, they greatly modernised the goods sector, replacing inefficient wagons with containerised regional hubs. The industry today is very similar to Dr Beeching's vision half a century ago. Tinsley Marshalling Yard (pictured here in 1982) was one of several large yards which never handled the large volumes of freight required to make them economical. The yard is now closed but a new cargo terminal opened nearby in 2011. In the 1980s, British Rail was reorganised into \\"sectors\\" including four goods sectors: *Trainload Freight took trainload goods *Railfreight Distribution took non-trainload goods *Freightliner took intermodal traffic *Rail Express Systems took parcel traffic The 1980s, however, also brought a huge down-turn in freight traffic, with the sector increasingly seen as irrelevant and without a future. In 1986, quarrying company Foster Yeoman prompted a turnaround in the reliability of rail freight by obtaining permission to run its own locomotives, and importing the first four EMD class 59s. This design was developed into the class 66 which became widely used by EWS and other operators over a decade later. =Privatisation era= British Rail was privatised in the 1990s. Six freight operating companies (FOCs) were set up: * Trainload goods was split into three geographical units (all were purchased by Wisconsin Central and merged to form English, Welsh & Scottish (EWS) in 1996): ** Mainline Freight in the south- east ** Loadhaul in the north-east ** Transrail in the west * Railfreight Distribution was also sold to EWS in 1997 * Rail Express Systems was also sold to EWS in 1996 * Freightliner was privatised with the brand name retained The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 allowed direct goods trains to run between the UK and the continent for the first time. Freight services are also offered by the Getlink truck shuttles. Subsequently, EWS's nuclear flask train operations were sold to the new company Direct Rail Services set up by British Nuclear Fuels. GB Railfreight was a new freight company established in 1998 by GB Railways. It was later owned by FirstGroup, Europorte and EQT Partners. Deutsche Bahn purchased EWS for ¬£309 million\\"EWS sold to German Railways\\" The Railway Magazine issue 1276 August 2007 page 6 on 13 November 2007.Annual Accounts for 9 months ended 31 December 2007: English Welsh & Scottish Railway Holdings Limited On 1 January 2009, EWS was rebranded as DB Schenker along with Deutsche Bahn's Railion and DB Schenker divisions. In March 2016, DB Schenker was rebranded as DB Cargo\\"New name for DB Schenker\\" Rail issue 796 16 March 2016 page 18 throughout Europe.\\"EWS becomes DB Schenker\\" Rail issue 608 31 December 2008 page 17 Since 1995, the amount of freight carried on the railways has increased sharply due to increased reliability and competition, as well as new international services. Major road haulage operations such as the Stobart Group and WH Malcolm move goods by rail, hauling supplies from Asda and Tesco. Morrisons also uses rail freight, as does Marks & Spencer and many more retailers. A symbolic loss to the rail freight industry in Great Britain was the custom of the Royal Mail, which from 2004 discontinued use of its 49-train fleet, and switching to road haulage after a near 170-year- preference for trains. Mail trains had long been part of the tradition of the railways in Great Britain, famously celebrated in the film Night Mail, for which W. H. Auden wrote the poem of the same name. Although Royal Mail suspended the mail train in January 2004, this decision was reversed in December of the same year, and Class 325s are now used on some routes including between London, Warrington and Scotland. The Department for Transport's Transport Ten Year Plan called for an 80% increase in rail freight measured from a 2000-1 base. By the year 2015 rail-borne intermodal traffic is scheduled to double, and by 2030 the whole of rail freight is expected to double at 50.4 billion tonne km. Current operations Goods carried by rail are either intermodal (container) freight or trainload freight which includes coal, metals, oil, and construction materials. There are four main freight rail operating companies in the UK: Direct Rail Services, Freightliner, GB Railfreight, and the largest, DB Cargo UK (formerly EWS). There are also three smaller independent operators, which are Colas Rail, DCRail and Mendip Rail. The Rail Delivery Group set up by the DfT includes representatives of rail freight companies. Statistics on freight are specified in terms of the weight of freight lifted, and the net tonne kilometre, being freight weight multiplied by distance carried. 116.6 million tonnes of freight was lifted in the 2013-4 period, against 138 million tonnes in 1986-7, a decrease of 16%. However, a record 22.7 billion net tonne kilometres (14 billion net ton miles) of freight movement were recorded in 2013-4, against 16.6 billion (10.1 billion) in 1986-7, an increase of 38%. Coal used to make up around 36% of the total net tonne kilometre, though its share is declining. Rail freight has slightly increased its market share since privatisation (by net tonne kilometres) from 7.0% in 1998 to 9.1% in 2011 and around 12% in 2016. Recent growth is partly due to more international services including the Channel Tunnel and Port of Felixstowe, which is containerised. Nevertheless, network bottlenecks and insufficient investment in catering for 9' 6\\" high shipping containers currently restrict growth. Intermodal freight An example of intermodal freight: a Freightliner Class 90 at Stratford, hauling an intermodal train from Crewe to Felixstowe A \\"liner train\\", or \\"freightliner\\", is a UK term for a train carrying intermodal containers. The name was coined by Richard Beeching in the 1960s, and later became the Freightliner sector of British Rail. This was sold off as a private enterprise, Freightliner, in 1995, as part of the privatisation of BR. \\"Freightliner\\" or \\"liner\\" may mean either intermodal services run solely by Freightliner, or intermodal services in general. Additionally, a \\"bin liner\\" or \\"binliner\\" is a slang term for a liner train carrying containers of waste for disposal. =Terminals= The rail access to the Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal (DIRFT), a major intermodal terminal Major intermodal freight terminals include: Sea ports *Port of Bristol *Felixstowe *Port of Grangemouth *Port of Hull *Immingham *Seaforth Dock, Liverpool *Southampton *Thamesport *Tilbury *Teesport Inland terminals *Birch Coppice near Tamworth, West Midlands *Barking Rail Freight Terminal *Burton upon Trent Rail Freight Terminal *Birmingham (Lawley Street) Terminal *Coatbridge (Glasgow) Terminal *Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal, West Midlands *Doncaster Inland Port *Doncaster International Railport *Dollands Moor, Kent - for freight via the Channel Tunnel *East Midlands Gateway Rail Freight Terminal, Kegworth, Leicestershire.

These are run using merry-go-round trains. *40 coal trains per day run from Immingham to coal- fired power stations in the Aire Valley (Drax, Eggborough) and the Trent Valley (Cottam, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, West Burton). The south humber ports generate close to one fifth of total UK freight by tonnage via the South Humberside Main Line. = Oil and petroleum = * GB Railfreight runs up to two 20 tank trains a week for Petrochem Carless Ltd, transporting gas condensate from North Walsham to a refinery in Harwich. The company also transports up to 3 trains per week of petroleum products from the North East to Inver Terminal at the Queen Alexandra Dock in Cardiff * Colas Rail Freight will provide haulage for bitumen from the Lindsey Oil Refinery to Total UK‚Äôs Preston production plant. * DB Cargo UK moves petrochemicals from Grangemouth, Fawley, the Humber, Lindsey and Milford Haven refineries. =Construction materials= *Lafarge uses rail freight in its various cement works. *GB Railfreight hauls raw materials and finished goods including gypsum, aggregates, limestone, iron ore, sleepers, ballast and rails. Its customers for this include Lafarge Tarmac, British Gypsum, Yeoman, Aggregate Industries, Network Rail and TfL. *Mendip Rail operates aggregates trains for its parent companies Aggregate Industries (due to acquisition of Foster Yeoman) and Hanson (due to acquisition of ARC). It holds the record for the longest and heaviest British train. =Food and drink= Tesco \\"Less CO2\\" intermodal containers at Rugby Yard *Asda grocery goods have been moved between distribution centres in Daventry, Grangemouth and Aberdeen using Malcolm Group and Direct Rail Services since 2001. *Tesco products are moved by Stobart Rail (Direct Rail Services) from Daventry to Mossend and Inverness. The company was responsible for the longest train journey in Europe by a single operator when fresh Spanish produce was transported in a refrigerated train from Valencia to Dagenham - a 1,100 mile journey. *Colas Rail imports melons as part of the regular Norfolk Lines train from Italy to the Midlands. *Soft drinks manufacturer Britvic uses Malcolm Logistics for its rail freight from Daventry to Grangemouth and Mossend. =Nuclear flask trains= * Direct rail Services operates all nuclear flask trains in Britain which, until the late 1990s, were previously operated by EWS (and British Rail before it). Destinations served include the UK nuclear power stations at Heysham, Valley (for Wylfa), Bridgwater (for Hinkley Point), Berkeley (for Oldbury), Hunterston, Torness, Seaton Carew, Dungeness and Sizewell. * The company formerly operated trains to the railhead at Southminster for fuel from Bradwell nuclear power station, however this installation is now in the process of being decommissioned. * There are also occasional trains from Ramsden Dock at Barrow-in-Furness to the processing plant at Sellafield, carrying nuclear waste from nuclear power stations in Japan and the Netherlands for treatment. DRS also have a contract to supply the Royal Navy's Devonport Dockyard with fuel for Britain's nuclear submarine fleet. These trains only run as required. There is also a train from Hull to Sellafield which reprocesses Russian spent fuel. * Low-level nuclear waste is carried by rail in containers from Sellafield to the Low Level Waste Repository at Drigg, several miles down the Cumbrian Coast. * There are plans to start running trains between Sellafield and Georgemas Junction in 2012, returning spent fuel from Dounreay to Sellafield. =Steel= *Tata move steel products from Margam to Llanwern by rail,Network Rail - Value and Importance of Rail Freight, July 2010 and from Scunthorpe to Ebange (France) via the Channel Tunnel. 10 trains run to/from the major Tata plant at Scunthorpe. =Timber= * Colas Rail operates timber trains to Chirk from Carlisle, Ribblehead in the Pennines, Baglan Bay in South Wales and Teigngrace in Devon. =Vehicles= Road vehicles, particularly passenger cars, can be moved by rail using autoracks. Ford and Honda are two companies who use rail to transport road vehicles. Ford launched its Dagenham Dock to Halewood train using Cartic 4 wagons (up to 34 cars on each double deck wagon) on 13 July 1966. It was expected 200,000 Ford vehicles would be carried each year at a rate of 50 to 60 trains a week, plus 10 a week to the docks.Modern Railways September 1966 p. 469 538 sets of Cartic 4 wagons were built between 1966 and 1972 and not finally scrapped until 2013. Jaguar Land Rover and BMW also use rail to transport vehicles. 90% of all finished vehicle rail movements within the UK are run by DB Cargo UK. Wagons transporting Honda cars at Bristol Temple Meads =Waste= \\"Binliner\\" routes include: *Northolt and Cricklewood to Calvert landfill site *Routes from Greater Manchester to Roxby Gullet landfill site (Freightliner) *Brentford to Appleford in Oxfordshire by DB Cargo UK *Dagenham and Hillingdon to Calvert landfill for West Waste, also a DB Cargo UK service *North London Waste Authority uses Freightliner Heavy Haul to operate a daily service from the transfer station at Hendon to Stewartby *Bristol and Bath Councils have used rail since the 1980s and Freightliner now operate the service completing a daily circuit between the two transfer stations in Bristol and Bath to the landfill site at Calvert in Buckinghamshire *DB Cargo UK carries Manchester‚Äôs household waste on daily services from four transfer stations at Northenden, Bredbury, Pendleton and Dean Lane to Roxby near Scunthorpe, a distance of roughly 85 miles *Edinburgh has used rail since 1989 and the DB Cargo UK service is booked to run Mondays to Saturday from Powderhall waste transfer station to a landfill site at Dunbar a distance of 27 miles ReferencesExternal links *Network Rail - Freight *Mode Shift Centre - How the Rail Freight Industry works *Rail Freight Group Rail freight transport in the United Kingdom ","title":"Rail freight in Great Britain"},{"id":"38655506","text":"Jaidi is a development committees of Baglung District of Gandaki Pradesh, situated in western Nepal.

The VDC is again divided into smaller villages called Ward, and it has 9 different Ward within VDC. The climate of this VDC is warm summer and mild winter. All people depends on the agriculture, this is the far remote area and there is no any industries so the one and only option is agriculture. For the job and everything people have to leave the village to the urban areas. Since there is very warm summer and good climate its easy to grow everything like rice, barley, corn and so on. Especially Chaura, Chhorelauwa, are the good places for the growing rice and everything. Health And Education For the health purpose every VDC have small health post which are very small and is only for the primary medicine. The health condition is not good as expected. It's difficult to get doctors and medicine in case of emergency. For the education purpose, Since the VDC is divided into smaller villages called Ward, and in every Ward there in one primary school, and within the VDC there are 6 primary schools, one lower secondary school, one secondary school and one higher secondary school. There is no option for the higher education, and the people have to move to the headquarters or capital to pursue higher education. It has one of the oldest high schools of Baglung district and it has turned into a Higher Secondary School (Jaidi Higher Secondary School situated at Ward No.5- Jaidi) since 2010.

Also product marketing is defined as being the intermediary function between product development and increasing brand awareness. For example, product management deals with the basics of product development within a firm, whereas product marketing deals with marketing the product to prospects, customers, and others. Product marketing, as a job function within a firm, also differs from other marketing jobs such as social media marketing, marketing communications (\\"marcom\\"), online marketing, advertising, marketing strategy, and public relations, although product marketers may use channels such as online for outbound marketing for their product. A product market is something that is referred to when pitching a new product to the general public. Product market definition focuses on a narrow statement: the product type, customer needs (functional needs), customer type, and geographic area.  Role  Product marketing addresses five strategic questions: * What products will be offered (i.e., the breadth and depth of the product line)? * Who will be the target customers (i.e., the boundaries of the market segments to be served)? * How will the products reach those customers (i.e., the distribution channel and are there viable possibilities that create a solid business model)? * At what price should the products be offered? * How should we position the product in the minds of the customer? To inform these decisions, Product Marketing Managers (PMMs) act as the Voice of the Customer to the company. This includes gaining a deep understanding of‚Äîand driving‚Äîcustomer engagement with the product, throughout its lifecycle (pre- adoption, post adoption/purchase and after churning). PMMs collect this customer information through surveys and interviews and when available, product usage and competitive data. This informs the product roadmap, as well as driving customer product education to enhance engagement. PMMs answer these questions and execute on the strategy using the following tools and methods: * Customer insights: interviews, surveys, focus groups, customer observation. * Data analysis: internal and external data. * Product validation: test and validate product ideas (the minimum viable product or rapid prototyping), before committing engineering resources. * Market testing: optimal prices and marketing programs are developed through A/B testing of elements including language (copy), prices, product line-ups, visuals.  Relationship to product management  Product marketing generally performs different functions from product management. Product managers take product requirements from sales and marketing personnel and create a product requirements document (PRD) for the engineering team. The product marketing manager creates a market requirements document (MRD), source material for the PRD. These roles may vary across companies. In some cases the product manager creates both MRD and PRD, while product marketing does outbound tasks such as trade show product demonstrations, marketing collateral (hot-sheets, beat-sheets, cheat sheets, data sheets and white papers). This requires skilled in competitor analysis, market research, technical writing and in financial matters (ROI and NPV analyses) and product positioning. Typical performance indicators for product marketers include feature adoption, new revenue, expansion revenue, and churn rate. Product marketers are chartered with developing the content for sales, marketing communications, customers and reviewers.  Qualifications  The typical education qualification for this area of business is a marketing or business degree, e.g. an BBA, MBA, M.A./M.S. in Marketing, M.A./M.S. in I/O Psychology, along with work experience. A key skill is to be able to interact with technical staff, increasing the value of a background in engineering or computing.

No major highways nor rivers cross the Sierra, nor are there any towns or cities. The population is rural. Abundant small, clear waterways drain from the highest points of the Sierra outward in all directions. Precipitation in the Sierra de Tamaulipas ranges from about at the lowest elevations to more than at higher elevations. Most precipitation is in the summer between May and October, although winters are not as dry as in much of Mexico. Freezes are rare at lower elevations, but common in the temperate forests at higher altitudes. The climate of the hamlet of Santa Maria de los Nogales is typical of the higher elevations of the Sierra. Climatic classification. Cwa (Koppen); Cwab (Trewartha) Pre-Hispanic cultures Due to greater precipitation than the surrounding lowlands, the Sierra de Tamaulipas was probably the northernmost area of eastern Mexico in which the cultivation of maize was practiced during pre-Hispanic times. Northward in the semi-arid brushlands extending into Texas lived the nomadic non-agricultural peoples collectively called Coahuiltecans. Archaeologist Richard MacNeish found evidence of cultivation of maize in the Sierra de Tamaulipas dating from 2,500 BC which suggests a transition in culture from nomadic hunter-gathering to a more settled lifeway.Fiedel, Stuart J. Prehistory of the Americas, London: Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp. 171-172 From 300 to 550 C.E., several settlements in the Sierra de Tamaulipas comprised the northern outpost of the Mesoamerican Huastec culture. The Sierra settlements featured villages built around public squares and small pyramids, indicating a centralized and possibly theocratic government. The archaeological ruin of El Sabinito, about l3 miles (20 km) southwest of the city of Soto la Marina, is at the northern edge of the Sierra. El Sabinito may have consisted of 600 houses with a population of 1,500 at its peak. It was abandoned in about 1300 C.E., possibly because climatic changes made agriculture less feasible. Archaeologists speculate that the inhabitants reverted to a hunting-gathering means of subsistence.\\"Zona Arqueologica el Sabinito\\" http://www.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=5500, accessed 3 Mar 2013 The first European to visit the coastal area adjacent to the Sierra was Francisco de Garay in 1523. Garay found maize cultivation up to about the Tropic of Cancer. From there northward lived hunter-gatherers who, according to Garay's men, were numerous and warlike on the lower stretches of the Soto La Marina River.Salinas, Martin.

Lord John Russell had intervened with a proposal that the war should be submitted to a European conference on behalf of the United Kingdom; the proposal was supported by Russia, France and Sweden. The negotiations were influenced by the Prussian and Austrian victory in the Battle of Dybb√∏l, giving Otto von Bismarck and his delegation an advantage over their opponents. The conference broke up 25 June 1864 without having arrived at any conclusion. Background The government of Denmark attempted to integrate Schleswig, by creating a new common constitution (the so-called November Constitution) for Denmark and Schleswig. On 18 November 1863 Christian IX of Denmark signed the constitution, merging Schleswig into Denmark and separating Schleswig from Holstein. On 28 December a motion was introduced in the Federal Assembly by Austria and Prussia, calling on the German Confederation to occupy Schleswig as a pledge for the observance by Denmark of compacts of London Protocol 1852. This implied the recognition of the rights of Christian IX, and was indignantly rejected by Denmark; whereupon the Federal Assembly was informed that the Austrian and Prussian governments would act in the matter as independent European powers. Initially Lord John Russell proposed a European conference based on status quo. The German powers signed an agreement on 11 March, under which the compacts of 1852 were declared to be no longer valid. The negotiations The British plans for a ceasefire should have been presented on 12 April, but Bismarck was successful in postponing the opening of the conference to 25 April. Meanwhile, the German and Austrian troops had a decisive victory in the Battle of Dybb√∏l. The proceedings of the conference only revealed the inextricable tangle of issues involved. The 11 March agreement made the Germans participate if the 1852 London Protocol was not taken as a basis, and the duchies were bound to Denmark by a personal tie only. Furthermore, the Germans demanded a Danish withdrawal of the blockade of the German ports. The Danish delegation refused, arguing that cutting off all maritime transport from and to the enemy was essential to the Danish strategy of war. Proposals for a partition of Schleswig/Southern Jutland On 12 May 1864, the conference in London led to a ceasefire, which soon broke down, as the delegations could not agree on a clear fixing of the boundaries; partitioning the duchy of Schleswig was seen as possible. On 28 March, Lord Russell declared support for a Partition Plan that separated the German parts of Schleswig from the Danish monarchy. Napoleon III, a supporter of the self-determination principle, demanded a referendum. Beust, on behalf of the Confederation, demanded the recognition of the Augustenburg claimant; Austria leaned to a settlement on the lines of that of 182. Prussia, it was increasingly clear, aimed at the acquisition of the duchies. The first step towards the realization of that ambition was to secure the recognition of the absolute independence of the duchies, which Austria could not oppose because of the risk of forfeiting any influence among the German states. The two powers then, agreed to demand the complete political independence of the duchies bound together by common institutions. The next move was uncertain. As to the question of annexation, Prussia would leave that open but made it clear that any settlement must involve the complete military subordination of Schleswig-Holstein to herself. That alarmed Austria, which had no wish to see a further extension of Prussia's already overgrown power and began to champion the claims of the duke of Augustenburg. That contingency, however, Bismarck had foreseen and himself offered to support the claims of the duke at the conference if he would undertake to subordinate himself in all naval and military matters to Prussia, surrender Kiel for the purposes of a Prussian war-harbour, give Prussia the control of the projected Kiel Canal, and enter the Prussian Customs Union. Beust: Mem. 1. 272 The Danish Foreign Minister, George Quaade, declared his country ready to follow ‚Äúthe road of peace‚Äù but had no answer from Copenhagen on the issues of the Partition Plan. On behalf of Prussia, Bismarck agreed in a partition of Schleswig, only leaving a minor part for Denmark. On 25 June the London conference broke up without having arrived at any conclusion. On the 24th, in view of the end of the truce, Austria and Prussia had arrived at a new agreement, the object of the war being now declared to be the complete separation of the duchies from Denmark. As the result of the short campaign that followed, the preliminaries of a treaty of peace were signed on August 1, the King of Denmark renouncing all his rights in the duchies in favour of the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia.

List of World War I cemeteries and memorials at Verdun  One French Lieutenant at Verdun who was later killed by an artillery shell wrote in his diary on 23 May 1916 The Battle of Verdun Verdun was a fortified French garrison town on the River Meuse, east of Paris and in December 1915, General Erich von Falkenhayn, Chief of Staff of the German Army, decided to launch a major attack against it. The attack started on 21 February 1916, and a million German troops, led by Crown Prince Wilhelm, were to be faced by 200,000 French defenders. The following day the French were forced to retreat to their second line of trenches and by 24 February had moved back to their third line and were only from Verdun. By early 1916 one could divide the Western Front into the section from the North Sea to the Somme, which was defended by French, British and Belgian forces, and the section from south of the Somme to the Swiss border, which was defended solely by the French. This latter section was subdivided into the Northern, the Centre and the Eastern sectors and were under the command of generals Ferdinand Foch, Augustin Dubail and Fernand de Langle de Cary respectively. The front line at Verdun was in fact around the edge of a salient, similar to those at Ypres and St Mihiel and this would have influenced Von Falkenhayn's decision to choose Verdun for this major attack; with a salient one can launch converging attacks from two sides. Another reason for the choice of Verdun was that it was cut in half by the River Meuse which would make it harder for the French to defend their position. He would also have been aware that the forts of the \\"Verdun Fortified Region\\", as the French called the area, were now badly organised, under-equipped and under- manned, this because the French High Command had lost faith in the virtues of permanent fortifications after the Germans had crushed and taken the forts of Li√®ge, Namur and Manonvillers in 1914, and had stripped them of many of their artillery pieces and men. In 1915 many French troops and guns were moved from Verdun to the Champagne front. Finally Von Falkenhayn would have been aware of the advantage that the Germans were given by the major communications network in the Verdun region which involved seven railways and also the proximity of the fortified camp in Metz whilst conversely the French had only three supply routes into Verdun. These were the railway from Sainte-M√©nehould, the small, narrow-gauge \\"Meusien\\" railway and the road from Bar-le-Duc to Verdun. The Sainte-M√©nehould railway was to be cut off early in the battle. Verdun was also important for psychological reasons. On the German side, 14 February 1916 had seen the Kaiser issue a proclamation to his troops glorifying the imminent attack The morale of the French army at the time was a factor and Marshal P√©tain was to write Verdun was France's soul. General von Falkenhayn's initial objective was to take the town in order to clear the way for an invasion of the area beyond Verdun and it is highly unlikely that he anticipated waging a battle of attrition as has sometimes been claimed, with talk of the intention being \\"to bleed France white\\" and it is much more likely that it was the failure of his first attempts to break through the French lines and the battle's overall conditions that were to lead to a strategy of \\"wearing down the enemy\\". At the beginning of the battle the Germans concentrated a huge amount of artillery in front of Verdun. These included the 5th Army's twenty- five 305 and 420mm mortars plus three 380mm navy guns and 1,200 cannons. The Germans were poised to release an unprecedented bombardment on Verdun. The first German attack lasted from 21 February to 5 March 1916, and took place on the right bank of the Meuse. At dawn on 21 February the Germans unleashed their guns and early that evening around 80,000 German soldiers stormed the French positions. The troops did not believe that the French troops could have survived such a fierce artillery bombardment but were to be surprised at the ferocity and strength of the French resistance. By 25 February, the French front line appeared to break and the Germans were able to advance and take Fort Douaumont. The Germans were now just from Verdun and Joffre gave General de Castelnau full powers and sent him to Verdun to prevent a complete breakdown of the French lines and a catastrophic retreat. On 24 February he had ordered the right bank of the Meuse, north of Verdun, to hold out- Joffre also replaced the existing Verdun defensive organisation with his 2nd army, which he put under the command of General P√©tain, who was given the task of organising the defence of Verdun. P√©tain based his headquarters in Souilly, from Verdun and quickly looked at the possibilities of reinforcing the forts, issuing an order which forbade surrender in case of an enemy attack. He also mobilised the artillery, which was to relieve the infantry by concentrating its fire on the German positions but also play a defensive role by crushing the enemy's attacks. Throughout the Battle of Verdun, P√©tain never stopped saying He also tried to address the problem of access to Verdun and the means of replenishing supplies. The road from Bar-le-Duc to Verdun now became known as the \\"Sacred Way\\" and in order to keep 2,900 lorries moving on the road in both directions every day, P√©tain had quarries opened up alongside it. Teams of territorial troops and Indochinese auxiliaries ceaselessly threw shovelfuls of stones under the wheels of the lorries, which passed by at the rate of one every five seconds. Some 70,000 tonnes of stones were used without interrupting traffic. Replenishing Verdun's supplies on the Sacred Way was a huge undertaking: every day the 300 officers, 8,000 men, 2,000 cars, 200 buses and 800 ambulances of the Commission R√©gulatrice Automobile carried an average of 13,000 men, 6,400 tonnes of equipment and 1,500 tonnes of munitions, consuming two tonnes of grease, 20,000 litres of oil and 200,000 litres of fuel. The little \\"Meusien\\" railway also supplied the 2nd Army. Every day the Saint-Dizier regulating station sent 21 trains of foodstuffs, 7 of munitions, 9 of equipment and 2 of troops to Verdun, as well as evacuating 5 to 7 trains of wounded. Altogether, 119,000 railroad cars travelled the route between 21 February and 1 June. All of this foiled Falkenhayn's plans and on 5 March 1916, he halted his offensive on the right bank but the French were given little time to celebrate and now the Germans were to launch a massive attack on the left bank of the Meuse. Now the battle of attrition was under way. From 5 March to 15 July, the Germans remained in strategic control of the battle by regularly alternating their offensives between either the right bank or the left bank of the Meuse. On the left bank, German troops took Goose Hill, Avocourt, Malancourt and B√©thincourt in their 6 March attack. On 9 April, the German army dug in on the northern flanks of Hill 304 and Mort-Homme. On 1 May, Joffre replaced P√©tain as commander of the Second Army by General Nivelle and made P√©tain head of the group of armies of the Centre and some have argued that he wanted to distance P√©tain from making direct daily decisions. The Germans were still in control of the terrain and thwarting the French army's deep counter-thrusts, such as the one on 22 May, when General Mangin's 5th Infantry Division stormed Douaumont Fort but did not have the resources they needed to take it and taking heart from that failure, the Germans pursued their offensives and began a five-day siege of Fort Vaux Fort which they totally encircled. The Germans were ruthless and after Major Raynal's men ran out of munitions, food and water, with some being so thirsty that they were said to have drunk their own urine, the Germans attacked them with gas and flame-throwers and the fort surrendered on 7 June. For the rest of the summer the Germans launched various offensives and in June they took Thiaumont, the village of Fleury and the Froideterre defence works They were now just three kilometres from Verdun and the French had to send in a steady stream of reinforcements to hold the front but these encounters undoubtedly exhausted the 5th German army who had lost nearly as many men as the French. On 11 July the Germans launched what was to be their last offensive but this failed in front of Souville Fort and now Falkenhayn had to move regiments and artillery to the Somme, Russia and Romania. The German's exhaustion at Verdun and troop transfers to other fronts caused them to halt their offensive in mid-July and General Ludendorff was to describe Verdun in his memoirs as \\"a gaping wound that ate away at our forces\\". In early September, Nivelle and P√©tain developed plans to break through the German positions on the right bank and focused on strengthening their artillery power, in particular by using French 370 and 400mm howitzers for the first time at Verdun. The French pounded the right bank area from 20 to 23 October and at dawn on the 24th, four divisions commanded by General Mangin stormed Douaumont and the colonial infantry regiment of Morocco and parts of the 321st Infantry overran the ruins and held onto them. A week later the Germans evacuated Fort Vaux, which was then reoccupied by the French and on 15 December a new thrust pushed the German front to north of the C√¥te du Poivre-Louvemont-Bois des Cauri√®res-Bezonvaux line. By late 1916 French troops had taken back the ground lost since 21 February on the right bank of the Meuse north of Verdun and the town was relieved.The Battle of Verdun Chemins de Memoire.

These forts had protected Verdun since the 1890s but having seen the Belgian forts fall to the power of the German 420 mm (16 in) Gamma guns the French High Command judged Fort Douaumont and the other Verdun forts to be less important that they were previously thought to be, and they were, as a consequence, often left seriously under-manned and many guns and munitions in them were moved elsewhere. It was no surprise then that on 25 February 1916, Fort Douaumont was entered and occupied without a fight by a small German raiding party comprising only 19 officers and 79 men. This caused the French High Command great dismay and the Fort was only recaptured by three infantry divisions of the French Second Army, during the First Offensive Battle of Verdun on 24 October 1916 after which the Verdun battle slowly ground to a halthttp://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/german-troops-capture-fort- douaumont-verdun =Fort Souville= Fort Souville, located to the south of Fort Douaumont, played a most important role in Verdun's defences and was never taken by the Germans. As part of the Thiaumont-Fleury-Souville ridge it dominated the combat zone and for the Germans, possession of the Fort would have literally put Verdun in their sights. It was Captain Gustave de la Taille who built this fort and gave it the name of the Loiret village, Souville, in which his ancestor, Bertrand de la Taille, groom to the Lord of Souville, had been laid to rest in 1319. Fort Souville was 388 metres above sea level, the same altitude as Fort Douaumont, and built between 1875 and 1879 from limestone covered with 3-5m of earth. The ditches that surrounded it featured built-in scarps and counterscarps, flanked by caponniers armed with revolver cannons and 12 tonne breechblock cannons and in 1889, the whole thing was wrapped in barbed wire 30m thick. It was one of the S√©r√© des Rivi√®res belt's \\"first generation\\" forts, like those at Belleville, Saint Michel and Tavannes. In 1888, the gunpowder magazine was reinforced with 2.5m of concrete and a 1m thick layer of sand. Connecting passageways were built, as well as six 18m by 5m shelters, each protected by an 8m thick layer of blocks made from rock, marl, and loose stones. The fort housed the district's telephone exchange, consisting of two underground lead circuits that connected it to Fort Douaumont and the fortification at Thiaumont, plus two overhead cables linking other forts and the Verdun citadel exchange. Before conflict began, there were plans to establish a communication system for clear days, using lights, with the fortified town of Longwy, more than away. Criss-crossing alleys formed a communication network that can still be seen all over the fortification and this ensured that relief soldiers could reach the fort and the injured could be taken to safety. The network of alleys began both at the Marceau barracks (one of the entrances to the battlefield) towards Souville and at the village of Fleury, then headed for the river and the village of Vaux (the Carri√®res alley), the Vaux R√©gnier, Fumin woods and Fort Vaux.

The file opens in October 1917 and we learn that a Union Jack had been presented to the City of Verdun by General Cowans. and the Mayor of Verdun had written to the Foreign Office as follows:-- \\"The town of Verdun is proud to possess this testimony of admiration to the immortal soldiers who preserved it from the pollution of the enemy, but it would like to keep in its archives a written certificate conferring on it the guardianship of this flag\\". The Secretary of State for War duly wrote the following letter to the Mayor of Verdun on 5 March 1918. \\"In fulfilment of the promise made by my predecessor, Mr.Lloyd George, when he visited Verdun, it is my pleasant duty and high privilege to ask you, M.le Maire, to accept the custody of the British Flag which Lieutenant General Sir John Cowans, Quarter Master General to the Forces, in the name of His Majesty the King and on behalf of the Army Council, handed to you on 20 September last. Animated by the sincerest feelings of admiration for the brilliant valour of which the city of Verdun was at once the scene and the inspiration, the British Army desire that this tribute to their comrades in arms may, by the permission of yourself, M.le Maire, and your successors in office, remain in your citadel to commemorate the definite repulse of a common enemy in the anxious but victorious months of February and March, 1916\\". The fighting there in 1916 would see large numbers of French and German dead.

The French military archives document that Nivelle's promotion to lead the Second Army at Verdun, in June 1916, had been followed by manifestations of indiscipline in five of his front lire regimentsAlain Denizot, 1996, pp.146-149 This unprecedented disquiet would eventually reappear with the French army mutinies that followed the unsuccessful Nivelle offensive of April 1917.

All of depicted aircraft arrived in Japan as a result of international flights. Larger aircraft such as the Airbus A380 are often used for international flights. An international flight is a form of commercial flight within civil aviation where the departure and the arrival take place in different countries. An important difference between international and domestic flights is that, before boarding the aircraft, passengers must undergo migration formalities and, when arriving to the destination airport, they must undergo both immigration and customs formalities, unless both the departure and arrival countries are members of the same free travel area, such as the Schengen Area. Airports serving international flights are known as international airports. Origins One of the first flights between two countries was on January 7, 1785, when Jean- Pierre Blanchard and John Jeffries crossed the English Channel in a hot air balloon. It took more than a century for the first heavier-than-air object to repeat this process: Louis Bl√©riot crossed the English Channel on July 25, 1909, winning a Daily Mail prize of ¬£1,000. Aviation technology developed during World War I, with aviation between the World Wars seeing the development of international commercial flights. There was a combination of aircraft types which included airships and airplanes. The first airline to operate international flights was Chalk's Ocean Airways, established 1917, which operated scheduled seaplane services from Florida to the Bahamas. The first regular international service in the world was covered by the British Aircraft Transport and Travel, from Hounslow Heath Aerodrome to Le Bourget, near Paris. After World War II, international commercial flights were regulated by the creation of the International Air Transport Association and the International Civil Aviation Organization.

As a child she took up running on her own volition. By age 10 she was running a hilly 5 mile run daily, timing herself to make herself faster each day. By age 15 she was a high school phenom. She won her hometown Bolder Boulder three consecutive times. Between Cross Country and Track, she won eight state titles and became only the second person to defend their title at the Foot Locker Cross Country Championships, then called the Kinney Cross Country Championships, winning in 1989 and 1990.http://www.footlockercc.com/history/finals.php Her 1990 winning time of 16:39, reputed to be by a quarter of a mile, is the still standing Morely Field course record. She is the first female scholastic athlete to run two miles in less than 10 minutes (9:55.9). a record she held for 22 years. While still in high school, she finished third in the 1991 World Junior Cross Country Championships behind a couple of Kenyan runners (the winner only 13 years old). By the time she reached the University of Oregon on a track scholarship, injuries and an eating disorder prevented her from running for her first two years. She gave up her scholarship her junior year, only to return to earn it back as a senior, placing ninth in the 1995 NCAA Women's Division I Cross Country Championship & 1996 NCAA Championship Indoor Track at 3,000 meters.

Sibisi is renowned for her cultural activism and becoming the first black female to own an art gallery in South Africa at the age of 25. She was born in rural KZN and is the daughter of farmers. Sibisi initially moved to Johannesburg to study and pursue a modelling career, which she eventually moved away from to start her first business, Invogue Concepts, which she founded at the age of 18. Sibisi now runs several businesses, including an art gallery, Sibisi Gallery, for which she is so widely acclaimed. Early life and education Sibisi was born on 4 November 1986 in Estcourt, South Africa to Siphiwo Sibisi and Sizeni MaMncube Sibisi. She is the last born of 9 children, and has three sisters, and five brothers. Sibisi grew up in Weenen, a small town well-known for its political and tribal conflicts. Sibisi and her family lived in a village named KwaMtebhelu, sorrounded by faction fighting. As a 6-year-old Sibisi encountered the brutal murder of 12 men on her front yard. Sibisi and her family moved to Ladysmith when she was 7-years-old to escape the conflict in Weenen. Sibisi's parents were subsistent farmers of corn and cattle. Sibisi grew up herding cows and tending to the corn fields with her mother, father and siblings. Sibisi credits this time as her best years, and her mother, her best teacher, \\"she instilled in me a deep profound love for Africa. She told me stories about the history of a glorious continent and taught me to love it and serve it always.\\" At the age of 12, Sibisi moved to Utrecht to live with her oldest sister, a prison social worker, in a maximum security prison called Waterval Prison. At 16, she witnessed her brother's tragic death while farming, when the tractor he was driving lost control and ploughed down the Klip River, killing him instantly. Struggling to come to terms with her brother's death Sibisi's mother decided to relocate her to Estcourt to live with another one of her sister and to finish school at the local Estcourt High School. Sibisi finished high school at age 17 and moved to Johannesburg. She studied Business Management at the University of Johannesburg and dropped out after one year to start her own business in marketing. Sibisi inspired by her rural South African roots started Invogue Concepts at the age of 18, with the aim to promote African arts and culture. Her aim was to shine a spotlight of African arts and culture, remind Africans of their intrinsic identity by showcasing it to the world. In 2017, Sibisi enrolled at the University of South Africa to study towards a Law degree. Career Early in her career Sibisi struggled to get her marketing company to take off. She describes this time as a blessing in disguise, \\"it was character building. I learned to rely on myself, as I was always alone persuing the impossible. I am grateful for this time because it taught me humility.\\" At age 22, Sibisi's career began to take off, when she moved to Mahikeng, to consult with various government departments. While working with the Department of Arts and Culture (South Africa), Sibisi discovered a love for contemporary African art. This led her to take an apprenticeship with acclaimed art curator and art broker Andile Magengelele, who became her teacher and mentor. Sibisi also credits Christopher Till, director of the Apartheid Museum as her teacher and inspiration, and her mother who taught her to love and dedicate her life to the nurturing of the African continent, \\"in her own unique way, using her passions\\". During a 6-month hiatus in Paris, France, Sibisi made a resolution to open Sibisi Gallery, a contemporary art gallery specialising in African investment art. At 25, Sibisi became the first black woman to own an art gallery in South Africa, when she opened Sibisi Gallery at the Melrose Arch in Johannesburg. In 2015, Sibisi reincorporated her company into a holdings company, Sibisi Holdings, a creative agency, hosting under its umbrella several businesses in the creative and art space, gaining valuable founder and investor experience. Sibisi is passionate about local economic development. Sibisi Holdings' main focus is the promotion and accessibility of African arts and culture. Sibisi is the sole director of Sibisi Holdings, which is set to launch a landmark inaugural event in 2020.Inaugural event Philanthropy and causes As a cultural activist, Sibisi uses art to advocate for her philantropic endeavours and responsibilities, to promote the welfare of rural women and girls in South Africa. Sibisi is the founder and director of the Sibisi Foundation. =The Injusuthi Project= is a Sibisi Foundation initiative which documents the stories of Ukuthwala, the act of forcing young women to enter into wedlock as young as 12-years-old. Ukuthwala is a cultural practice prevalent in South Africa, especially in KwaZulu Natal and Eastern Cape. Being born around this practice, Sibisi saw how this practice devastated families and young victims and has since sought to create awareness around it. Although the practice has been integrated into the Traffic of Persons Act in South Africa, it is still rife in rural communities. As a result of this practice, young women lose the opportunity to get an education, they often find themselves having to grow up living with HIV and AIDS, and become victims of gender-based violence. Sibisi Foundation believes that this practice should not exist in a free and fair South Africa. =As an art practitioner= Sibisi works closely with artists and crafters at the grassroots level assisting in the development of their skills and creating an art market for the commercialization of their works of art. A big part of that involves sustainable development for female artists and crafters from previously disadvantaged backgrounds. Personal life Sibisi is a traditionalist and attributes her beliefs to African spirituality, traditional African religions, to which she advocates.

It was built for the naval officer Niels Juel in the 1680s but his Baroque mansion was later adapted to the Neoclassical style by the French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin in 1763. The building takes its current name after the Thott family who owned it from 1750 to 1930. It now houses the French embassy. History Niels Juel painted by Jacob Coning =Niels Juel's mansion= Originally known as the Juel Mansion, the house was built from 1683 to 1686 for the Danish naval officer Niels Juel. It was the second building which was completed on Kongens Nytorv which had been laid out by Christian V of Denmark in the years following his coronation in 1670 inspired by the royal squares of Paris. Niels Juel's victory in the Battle of K√∏ge Bay had won him fame and wealth. His new mansion was designed by Lambert van Haven as an L-shaped building in the Dutch Baroque style. =The next owners= The Danneskjolds Mansion in 1749 After Juel's death in 1697, Christian V arranged for his official mistress and mother to five of his children, Sophie Amalie Moth, to take over his mansion. She immediately passed it on to their eldest son, Christian Gyldenl√∏ve, who in about 1700 extended the building with a third wing. The house stayed in Gyldenl√∏ve's family for two more generations, although it was rented out to foreign envoys during some periods. The owners included Frederik Danneskiold-Sams√∏e, Gyldenl√∏ve's second oldest son, who played an important role in the development of the Nyholm naval base and dockyard. Countess Anne Sophie Schack acquired the mansion from Count Frederik-Christian Danneskjold in 1734. =Thott era= The Thott Mansion in c. 1875 The house was then sold at auction. The buyer was Otto Thott, who gained a reputation for being one of the most learned and competent statesmen of the 18th century in Denmark. He spend his summers at Gavn√∏ in the far south of Zealand and the winters in his mansion at Kongens Nytorv. In 1763, he commissioned Nicolas-Henri Jardin to adapt the building to a more modern style. The mansion housed Thott's extensive collections. At the time of his death, he had a book collection of 138,000 volumes and the largest private art collection in Denmark. His will provided that the latter be sold at auction. The catalogue contains 4,500 items of which 1,000 are oil paintings. After Otto Thott's death, the mansion stayed in his family. The most notable of his descendants to own the house was Tage Reedtz-Thott. Later the department store Magasin du Nord, located on the other side of the square, had a window exhibition in the mansion's ground floor and a tea garden opened in the courtyard. =French ownership= The property remained in the ownership of the Thott family until 1930 when it was purchased by the French State and turned into the French Embassy in Denmark. In 2012, the French State decided to put the mansion through a major restoration under the leadership of Fr√©d√©ric Didier, head architect at the Palace of Versailles. Architecture Roof-top statue Decorations above the main entrance Niel's Juel's original mansion was an L-shaped building in the Baroque style. The facade stood in blank red brick decorated with pilasters. Nicolas-Henri Jardin dressed the brick and adapted the building to the Neoclassical style. The triangular pediment above the main entrance towards Kongens Nytorv replaced a belvedere. The sandstone festons below the first floor and the balustrade with vases and statues on the roof also date from his alterations. The pilasters' original Tuscan capitals can still be seen on the Bredgade facade while they have been replaced by composite Ionic-Corinthian capitals facing the square. It has previously been assumed that Jardin was also responsible for adapting the interiors. However, examination of Countess Shack's private letters have shown that transformation of the interior actually happened a few years earlier during her ownership to designs by the French architect Christophe Jacob Vallois.

She is mostly popular in France, where she is often cited as an example of successful role of women in science during the 20th century.  Biography  In 1941, Vugo became a medical doctor. In 1949, she joined the Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University in England. She initially worked with Francis Crick on transcoding protein chains and aromatic adenosine triphosphate. She demonstrated the canine sense of \\"master returns\\". Her research underlay the research of French biologist Jacques Monod. Bessa Vugo is also famous for her illustration boards related to nutrition (French iconography scientific boards Deyrolle, etc.). She was also interested in medical physics and conceived new tools to measure olfactory abilities.  Research  Her experiments were carried out on chimpanzees and humans and expanded knowledge of the five senses. = Molecular diffusion = She introduced a phenomenological law of molecular diffusion, which was known as the 'Law of Vugo'. It proposed an inverse relationship between the flux and the concentration gradient of a diluted chemical species. This law invalidated Fourier's Law for heat transfer. = Food shape = Bessa offered experimental subjects food compacted into geometric forms (e.g. cubes, pyramids, croissant) measured the behavior of different species in response to different foods. Famously, small children accepted brussels sprouts shaped in the form of a crescent moon. The experiments supported Vugo's hypothesis that \\"smell precedes the direct mouthing information on odor or smell of food.\\" Her work demonstrated the natural tendency of primates to use scent to assess an object they assume fragrant. = Taste = Bessa discovered the five types of taste buds in the oral cavity.in : Medisch Zaknoek op Reis (2014), 1.001 medische termen, vragen en uitleg van Nederlands in het Frans She found 100 to 600 epithelial cells arranged in the shape of an onion peel; \\"sour\\", \\"spicy\\", \\"strong\\", \\"pleasant\\" and \\"unpleasant\\". She showed that the presence or absence of receptors do not alter the experience of the taster. Perceived taste is driven by retro nasal olfaction. The aromas released in the mouth by chewing diffuse to the nasal cavity and stimulate nerve cells in the nose. Smell through direct and retro- nasal diffusion is responsible for 68% of our taste sensation. = Hearing = Bessa showed that in mammals, the ear size (e.g. fennec fox) is proportional to acuity of the 5 senses.
