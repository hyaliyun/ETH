The story is set in a private high school in Bonn, where an intellectual precocious girl and a classmate play a sexual prank on a teacher. Reception Die Zeit's reviewer placed the novel in a tradition of \\"German student tragedies\\" such as Frank Wedekind's Spring Awakening and Hermann Hesse's Beneath the Wheel. The critic compared the language to Robert Musil, and wrote: \\"It is astonishing, it is admirable, how the only 30-year-old writer, with a well-trained language for all horses and a highly educated ingenuity, races her story through more than 500 pages across the finish line, a story, which couldn't have been more uneasy. Uwe Wittstock of Die Welt found the novel tiresome and unoriginal. He compared its ideas to \\"commercial reports about the 'youth of today'\\", and wrote that \\"at the same time the novel's motif of 'blackmail with compromising photos' strikes me as about as corny as that of the forged letters in novels and plays from the 18th century.\\" The novel received the Per Olov Enquist Award and the Prix Cévennes for Best European Novel.

Biography  According to Kenneth Setton, Stefano Magno was born around 1499 (his father's name was Andrea) and died on 14 October 1572. According to the Marios Philippides he was born in 1490 and died in 1557. He was a member of the noble Venetian Magno family.  Works   Cronaca Magno  The authorship of the manuscript often named as Cronaca Magno is attributed to Stefano Magno. This work is based on the work of Aeneas Sylvius (Pope Pius II). Stefano Magno frequently quotes dispacci of Bartolomeo Minio in his chronicle.  Annali Veneti e del Mondo  His work Annali Veneti e del Mondo is a five-volume manuscript archived in the library of the Museo Correr. This manuscript is described as \\"one of the more important literary sources for the last two decades of fifteenth century\\", providing \\"extraordinary coverage\\" of events almost all over Europe and Levant. It also covers the process of Islamization of Albanians and presents information about the Muslim conquest of Skanderbeg's stronghold, Krujë. A Greek historian and researcher Constantine Sathas published extracts of the Venetian chronicle of Stefano Magno connected with the history of Greece (Mnemeia Hellenikes Historias [Monuments of Greek History]), which Kenneth Setton considers carelessly transcribed. The first volume of his Annali Veneti e del Mondo describes the origins of the Venetian noble families and presents the alphabetically arranged list with dates of their admission to the Great Council of Venice, with their coats of arms presented in color. The fourth volume describes the period from 1478 to 1481, and contains a description of the Siege of Krujë in 1478.

It is now in the Louvre in Paris. History This work is the only painting by Bruegel in the Louvre, received as a gift in 1892. Attempts have been made to interpret the picture of five cripples and a beggar-woman as an allusion to a historical event: the badger's tails, or foxes' tails, on their clothes might refer to the Gueux, a rebel party formed against the government of Philip II of Spain and Granvelle; but these also occur in Bruegel's The Fight Between Carnival and Lent in Vienna, dated 1559. Still, the beggars are not quite ordinary beggars, as they wear carnival headgear representing various classes of society: a cardboard crown (the king), a paper shako (the soldier), a beret (the bourgeois), a cap (the peasant), and a mitre (the bishop). The work clearly has some satirical meaning, which has so far eluded interpretation. Perhaps physical imperfections are meant to symbolise moral decrepitude, which can affect all men irrespective of class.V. Barker, Pieter Bruegel the elder: A study of his paintings, Arts Publishing Corp. (1926); see also W. S. Gibson, Bruegel, Thames & Hudson Ltd (1977). On the back of the painting are two inscriptions which seem to date from the 16th century. One is in Flemish, and in a very fragmentary state;Reconstructed by the Louvre as \\"Cripples, take heart, and may your affairs prosper.\\", cf. Louvre webpage the other is in Latin and records the admiration some humanist felt for Bruegel, whose art surpasses Nature itself.R. H. Marijnissen, Bruegel, tout l'oeuvre peint et dessiné, Éditions Albin Michel (1988), pp. 354-358 The painting dates from the end of Bruegel's career, when he showed a keener interest in the natural world. Tiny though it is, the landscape seen through the opening is bathed in a delicate light which simmers like dew on the foliage. Description On the back of the painting is written: What nature lacks, is lacking in our art, So great was the grace accorded to our painter. Here nature, expressed in painted forms, is astonished To see through these cripples that Bruegel is her equal. Analysis Modern eyes may be inclined to conclude that Brugel intended to invoke sympathy for the plight of the crippled figures, but from a historical perspective this is unlikely. Europeans of Bruegel's time gave little regard to beggars, and the painting provides hints that Bruegel shared this denigration: the figures are outside the town walls and are posed in such ways as to provoke contempt and amusement. The foxtail on some of the figures was a symbol at the time of ridicule in political caricature and real life. The woman behind them bears an empty bowl and may appear to be ignoring the beggars.

He made his MLB debut with the Yankees in 2015. He was named the American League's Rookie of the Month and Player of the Month for August 2016. Sánchez burst onto the scene with a record-breaking rookie debut in 2016, finishing second in Rookie of the Year voting despite playing in only 53 games. He was named an All-Star and Silver Slugger in 2017. Sánchez is the fastest catcher in MLB history to hit 100 home runs. Early life Sánchez grew up in La Victoria, Dominican Republic. His parents separated when he was young and he, his three brothers, and one sister were raised by their mother, Orquidia Herrera, and her mother, Agustina Pena, though they saw their father frequently. One of his brothers, Miguel Sánchez, played in the Seattle Mariners organization. Professional career Minor leagues Sánchez with the Tampa Yankees in 2012 Sánchez signed with the New York Yankees as an international free agent in July 2009, receiving a $3 million signing bonus. Before the 2010 season, Baseball America ranked him as the Yankees' seventh-best prospect. He began his professional career playing for the Gulf Coast Yankees. On August 18, 2010, he was promoted to the Staten Island Yankees of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League. He finished the season hitting .329/.393/.543 with eight home runs and 43 runs batted in (RBIs) in 47 games. Before the 2011 season, Sánchez was ranked among the top prospects in baseball. He was rated as the second best prospect in the Yankees organization and 30th best prospect overall by Baseball America. He spent the season playing for the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League. He played in 82 games before suffering a season ending finger injury. He finished the season hitting .256/.335/.485 with 17 home runs and 52 RBIs. Before the 2012 season, Sánchez was ranked as the Yankees fourth best prospect by Baseball America. He began the 2012 season with Charleston and received a midseason promotion to the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. Sánchez with the Trenton Thunder in 2014 Sánchez began the 2013 season with Tampa. After batting .254 with 13 home runs and 61 RBIs, the Yankees promoted him to the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League on August 3. He was added to the Yankees' 40-man roster after the 2013 season. Sánchez began the 2015 season with Trenton and was chosen to represent the Yankees at the 2015 All-Star Futures Game. After the Futures Game, the Yankees promoted Sánchez to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Class AAA International League, where he hit a home run in his first at-bat. New York Yankees 2015 After the conclusion of the RailRiders' 2015 season, the Yankees promoted Sánchez to the major leagues. He made his major league debut as a pinch hitter on October 3. He went hitless in two at bats during the regular season. The Yankees included him on their 25-man roster for the 2015 American League (AL) Wild Card Game. The Yankees then assigned Sánchez to the Arizona Fall League (AFL) after the season. He led the AFL in home runs, and was named the Fall Stars Game Most Valuable Player, and the second-best prospect in the AFL by Baseball America. As a result of his strong season, the Yankees felt comfortable trading fellow catcher John Ryan Murphy during the offseason. 2016 Sánchez in August 2016 Sánchez competed with Austin Romine to serve as the backup catcher to Brian McCann on the Yankees' Opening Day roster in 2016, but he began the season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. He was called up to the majors for one game in May, where he went 0-for-4. The Yankees again promoted Sánchez to the major leagues on August 3, and he recorded his first major league hit, a single off Hansel Robles, that same day. On August 10, Sánchez went 4-for-5, with his first major league home run and 3 singles. On August 16, Sánchez had his first two home run game against the Toronto Blue Jays. On August 22, Sánchez was named AL Player of the Week, after hitting four home runs with a .523 average. Sánchez became the first player in MLB history with at least 11 home runs and 31 hits in his first 23 career games. On August 29, Sánchez was named AL Player of the Week for the second straight week, and on September 3 MLB named him AL Player of the Month and Rookie of the Month. On September 21, Sánchez hit his 18th and 19th home runs in his 45th game, making him the fastest player to reach 19 home runs in the modern era. Sánchez in September 2016 For the 2016 season, Sánchez played in 53 games for the Yankees with a .299 batting average, 20 home runs, and 42 RBIs. On defense, in 2016 he had the best average pop time to second base (1.90 seconds) of all major league catchers. He finished second in the voting for AL Rookie of the Year, behind Michael Fulmer. 2017 On April 8, 2017, Sánchez left the game after straining his right brachialis muscle in the bicep and was placed on the 10-day disabled list. He returned to the Yankees on May 5 after missing 21 games. On June 10, Sánchez hit the hardest home run of his career, a 115.1-mph laser to left-center field against Mike Wright of the Baltimore Orioles. The following day, Sánchez hit the farthest home run of his career, a 450-foot shot off Kevin Gausman of the Orioles. Sánchez was named to the 2017 American League All-Star team, his first, as a reserve. He participated in the 2017 MLB Home Run Derby, upsetting Miami Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton 17–16 in the first round before losing to Minnesota Twins third baseman Miguel Sanó 11–10 in the second round. Prior to the competition, Sánchez engaged in a feud with Tampa Bay Rays first baseman Logan Morrison, who stated that Sánchez did not deserve an invitation to the Derby, having hit only 13 home runs so far compared to Morrison's 24. Sánchez responded by saying \\"It's not my fault he didn't get selected.\\" Sánchez played a key role in the Yankees' four-game sweep of the New York Mets by hitting three home runs and throwing out multiple runners trying to steal. On August 23, Sánchez hit two home runs against the Detroit Tigers; the first measured at 493 feet, the second-longest in the majors behind teammate Aaron Judge's 495-foot home run. On August 24, Sánchez hit a home run off of Tigers starter Michael Fulmer in the second inning; it was the fourth home run he had hit in the series and his 27th of the season. In his next at-bat, he was hit by a pitch from Fulmer, presumably in retribution for the home run. This served as a catalyst for a large brawl in which Sánchez threw punches at Tigers players. He was suspended for four games, which was later reduced to three games upon appeal. On September 14, Sánchez hit his 31st home run of the season, breaking the record for most homers in a single season by a Yankees catcher, previously held by Yogi Berra (1952, 1956) and Jorge Posada (2003). He finished the season batting .278/.345/.531 with 33 home runs, 90 RBIs, 20 doubles, 131 hits, 40 walks and 79 runs scored, and leading the majors in pull percentage (51.6%). On defense, in 2017 he had the best arm strength (87.8) and the third-best average pop time to second base (1.93 seconds) of all major league catchers, but tied for the major league lead in passed balls (16). In the postseason, he batted .208/.218/.415 with three home runs and eight RBIs as the Yankees lost in Game 7 of the ALCS to the Astros. At season's end, Sánchez received the Silver Slugger Award after the season as the best hitting catcher in the American League. 2018 Sánchez catching in 2018 On April 26, Sánchez hit his first career walk-off, a three-run home run off of Minnesota Twins closer Fernando Rodney as the Yankees won 4-3. On June 24, 2018, he injured his groin following an awkward landing at first base. He was placed on the disabled list, allowing backup catcher Austin Romine to fill his place and become the primary catcher. On July 23, after a game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Sanchez was criticized for lack of effort twice during the game. In the bottom of the first inning, a low pitch from Luis Severino bounced off Sanchez’s foot and rolled up the third base line. Sanchez jogged slowly to the ball, and Rays baserunner Jake Bauers took advantage of the lack of effort and scored after an errant throw from Sanchez. In the ninth inning, the Yankees were one run down with a chance to tie the game. Aaron Judge was at third, with Giancarlo Stanton at second, Aaron Hicks at first, and Sánchez up at bat. Sanchez hit a sharp ground ball to Daniel Robertson, who flipped it to Willy Adames, but Hicks hustled enough to be safe at second. Sánchez jogged slowly all the way to first, and Adames noticed, throwing to Bauers to get Sánchez out and end the game. Judge would have scored and tied the game but instead the Yankees lost to the Rays 6-7, due to Sánchez’s lack of hustle. On July 24, Sánchez went on the disabled list again due to re-aggravating the same groin. Sánchez finished the 2018 season with a disappointing .186 batting average with 18 home runs and 53 RBIs in 89 games played. On defense, he led the major leagues in passed balls, with 18. During the 2018 off-season, Sánchez underwent shoulder surgery to remove debris from the AC joint. 2019 Sánchez batting in July 2019 On April 7, 2019, Sánchez hit 3 home runs in one game against the Baltimore Orioles. On April 27, 2019, Sánchez hit his first career grand slam against the San Francisco Giants. On May 19, 2019, Sánchez hit his first career triple against the Tampa Bay Rays. On August 23 2019, Sánchez hit his 100th career homerun against the Los Angeles Dodgers making him the fastest catcher to hit 100 homeruns and second fastest player of all time to hit 100 homeruns. On September 3, 2019, Sánchez broke his own franchise record by hitting two home runs (number 33 and 34), a winning effort against the Texas Rangers. He now has the two highest single-season home run totals ever for a Yankees catcher, as well as becoming the second with multiple 30-homer years, joining Yogi Berra. In 2019, Sanchez dropped his passed balls from the league lead of 18 in 2018 to 7. However on defense he led all major league catchers in errors committed, with 15. 2020 Sanchez struggled during the 2020 season. In 49 games, he batted .147 with 10 home runs and 24 RBIs. By September, he was benched by manager Aaron Boone and relegated to the backup role. On defense, in 2020 he led all major league catchers in errors, with six.  Personal life  He and his wife, Sahaira, have one daughter. Sánchez credits his daughter's birth for his transformation from a player \\"going through the motions\\" early in his professional career, to a player lauded for his work ethic.

In September 2009, Ríodoce published a series on drug trafficking entitled \\"Hitman: Confession of an Assassin in Ciudad Juárez.\\" One morning a few days after the conclusion of the series, a grenade was thrown into Ríodoce's office, damaging the building but causing no injuries. The attackers were never identified. Awards In 2011, Valdez Cárdenas was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\". In his acceptance speech, he called the violence of Mexican drug trafficking \\"a tragedy that should shame us\\", blaming the citizenry of Mexico for giving the drug war its deaths and the governments of US and Mexico for giving the drug war its guns. Later in the same year, the trustees of Columbia University awarded Ríodoce the Maria Moors Cabot Prize for journalism that contributes to \\"inter-American understanding\\". Death Demonstration against the murder of Javier Valdez, in Mexico City On May 15, 2017, Valdez Cárdenas was shot and killed by unidentified gunmen around noon, blocks away from the Ríodoce offices in Culiacán, Sinaloa when he was 50 years old.

The Ancestral Puebloans (Anasazi) of the Chaco Canyon and surrounding region are believed to have prospered greatly from their production and trading of turquoise objects. Native American nations Within the last millennium, Athabaskan peoples emigrated from northern Canada in the southwest. These include the Navajo and Apache. Sandpainting is an aspect of Navajo healing ceremonies that inspired an art form. Navajos learned to weave on upright looms from Pueblos and wove blankets that were eagerly collected by Great Basin and Plains tribes in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the introduction of the railroad in the 1880s, imported blankets became plentiful and inexpensive, so Navajo weavers switched to producing rugs for trade. Pueblo, Navajo and Apache tribes cherished turquoise for its amuletic use; the latter tribe believe the stone to afford the archer dead aim. Among these peoples turquoise was used in mosaic inlay, in sculptural works, and was fashioned into toroidal beads and freeform pendants. The distinctive silver jewelry produced by the Navajo and other Southwestern Native American tribes today is a rather modern development, thought to date from c. 1880 as a result of European influences. Colonial Spanish With a need to be self-sufficient, many Hispanic people woodworking, weaving, tinsmith, farming and leather work skills to create the furniture and furnishings for their homes. Anglo-Americans Ancient artistic traditions have been manifested in native craft for generations when Europeans began to settle in the American Southwest; an important acknowledgement for understanding the inherent aesthetic allure of this area to the Anglo-American artists. Integration of influences Silverworking was adopted by native Southwest artists beginning in the 1850s, when Mexican silversmiths had to trade their silverwork for cattle from the Navajo. The Zuni admired the silver jewelry made by the Navajos, such as Atsidi Sani (Old Smith), so they began trading livestock for instruction in working silver. By 1890, the Zuni had taught the Hopi how to make silver jewelry.Hewett, Edgar. Native Peoples of the American Southwest. 1968 Native Americans were also influenced by the introduction of paintings made with oil and watercolor on canvas, where they traditionally painted objects such as hides or inside buildings, such as on the walls of a kiva. The Native American paintings provided artwork that was realistic of the Native American lifestyle in contrast to the work of Anglo- Americans romantic depictions. Traditional design elements were formalized at the Studio at the Santa Fe Indian School, defining flatstyle Native American art. The Studio was developed in 1932 by Dorothy Dunn, who taught there until 1932, and was replaced by Geronima Cruz Montoya (Ohkay Owingeh), who taught art at the Studio until its closing in 1962, when the Institute of American Indian Arts was established.Bernstein and Rushing, p. 14 Following World War I, the completion of the Santa Fe Railroad enabled American settlers to travel across the west, as far as the California coast. New artists’ colonies started growing up around Santa Fe and Taos, the artists' primary subject matter being the native people and landscapes of the Southwest. Images of the Southwest became a popular form of advertising, used most significantly by the Santa Fe Railroad to entice settlers to come west and enjoy the “unsullied landscapes”. Walter Ufer, Bert Geer Phillips, E. Irving Couse, William Henry Jackson, and Georgia O'Keeffe are some of the more prolific artists of the Southwest. Basketry Native Americans, including those of the American Southwest, traditionally make their baskets from the materials available locally.

(1986). \\"Determining Quality in Native American Art\\" in The Arts of the North American Indian: Native Traditions in Evolution. New York: Philbrook Art Center. p. 150. Navajo textiles were originally utilitarian blankets for use as cloaks, dresses, saddle blankets, and similar purposes. Toward the end of the 19th century, weavers began to make rugs for tourism and export. Typical Navajo textiles have strong geometric patterns. They are a flat tapestry-woven textile produced in a fashion similar to kilims of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, but the warp is one continuous length of yarn and does not extend beyond the weaving as fringe.

Yellow mountain to the north, blue mountain to the west, red mountain to the south, white mountain to the east, the multi-colored mountain above, and the black mountain below. Each direction is represented by a \\"Prey God\\", or guardian animal each having protective or healing powers, and are listed by Cushing as follows: north - the mountain lion, south – the badger, east – the wolf, west – the black bear, the sky or upper – the multi-colored eagle, and the underground or lower – the black mole.\\"Indian Fetishes: Southwest tribal miniature carvings that some say are imbued with spirit forces.

Zuni kachinas are believed to live in remote northeastern Arizona and bring life by giving rain and additional support, such as promote success for hunters and farmers, combat depletion of fur-bearing animals over the 19th and 20th centuries, or influence peoples' prosperity or well-being. There are more than 400 different kachinas in Hopi and Pueblo culture. The local pantheon of kachinas varies in each pueblo community; there may be kachinas for the sun, stars, thunderstorms, wind, corn, insects, and many other concepts.Wright, Barton; Roat, Evelyn.

Kokopelli Kokopelli is a hunchbacked flute player who represents the spirit of music and is a Native American fertility deity, sometimes depicted with a phallus, who presides over childbirth and agriculture. Kokopelli is one of the most easily recognized figures found in the petroglyphs and pictographs of the Southwest, the earliest known petroglyph is dated about A.D. 1000. He is often featured in rituals relating to marriage, and Kokopelli himself is sometimes depicted with a woman called Kokopel Mana by the Hopi. Kokopelli chases away winter and brings about the warmth and rains of spring with his flute playing. Among the Hopi, Kokopelli carries unborn children on his back and distributes them to women.

Southwest silverwork includes designs of channel inlay, cluster, mosaic, and petite point and materials of shell, gemstones and beads. While the Navajo favored the squash blossom necklace, they often also combined turquoise, coral, and other semi-precious gemstones. Stones were set into silver scrolls, leaf patterns, and strung on cord for necklaces. Hopi are renowned for their overlay silver work, developed in the 1940s. Zuni artists are admired for their cluster work jewelry, showcasing turquoise designs, as well as their elaborate, pictorial stone inlay in silver.

When she lands an audition for the lead role in a massive movie franchise based on the 'Prince of Chaos' novels by legendary author Horatio King, she goes after the opportunity with all guns blazing. However a sleazy agent trying to pimp her to the director Vincent Catalano, pushes her to the other extreme. Determined to prove her strict professionalism, she starts second guessing Vincent's interest in her. Dáithí Carroll is an earnest young filmmaker studying in London. Chosen to direct one of his college's graduation films, he needs a crew. Enter Joanne Webber, a hard-nosed Londoner with a penchant for role-play and her eye on this vulnerable Irishman. Together they recruit a motley crew for their film, and Dáithí enlists Kate to star. A restless Vincent inserts himself onto their set through his friend and casting director Deborah Whitton, who is tutor to the young filmmakers. Kate's resolve to maintain her integrity is put to the test as she finds herself drawn to Vincent when they are repeatedly thrown together. Add to the mix rival starlet Luci, a wannabe WAG with designs on both Kate's coveted role in 'Prince of Chaos', and on Vincent! In the cut- throat arena of show-business, Kate stands to learn that her profession is personal, and sometimes friction can create a spark.

Families living in the district, as well as in surrounding communities, choose to enroll their children at Parkview where innovation, high achievement and global education.\\" are at the heart of the school. This K-8 public school was established in 1989. The building is also home to the school district's Early Childhood Family Education Center, which serves children from birth to five years old. Parkview Center School has procedures designed to allow equitable access for enrolling at PCS. An annual enrollment application timeline, followed by a lottery drawing every February, governs access to the School. The district neighborhood elementary schools draw their students from a specific district attendance area. The school's choice program attracts students from throughout the Roseville School District which serves Falcon Heights, Lauderdale, Little Canada, Maplewood, and Shoreview, Minnesota, as well as from St. Paul and neighboring suburbs. History Parkview started in the fall of 1989 when a group of Roseville Area School district educators created an alternative or \\"choice\\" elementary school for grades kindergarten through four. Grade five was added a year later, followed by grade six the year after that. Grades 7 and 8 were added in 1994 and 1995, respectively. The school is housed in the former Parkview Middle School built in 1967. Unlike the neighborhood elementary schools and middle school in the district, Parkview offered \\"flexible, multi-aged groupings of students in each classroom and used a thematic approach to learning that emphasized global education and community involvement.\\" Parkview teachers incorporated whole language with traditional learning approaches. Classrooms were structured along multi-age groupings, pairing first and second grade students, third and fourth, etc. Only Kindergarten and grades seven and eight were not paired. The school was the only school in the district, until 2012, to offer a K-6 foreign language program, settling on Spanish in 1995. In 2015 the Spanish program for grades K-6 was dropped and an E-STEM program was added. Parent involvement was encouraged at this alternative school. In addition to the traditional parent volunteer roles parents could participate in, such as, classroom volunteer, room parent, field trip chaperone, etc., parents could also be on the AESOP Committee (today's PEACE Program) or Parkview Advisory Committee (today’s Site Council). Parkview continues to be the only school in the district with a parent advisory committee - the PCS Site Council. Parkview Center School currently enrolls 750 students in grades K-8. Academics Parkview Center School offers an inclusive educational program with 30 regular classrooms and additional facilities provided for Instrumental/Vocal music; Art; an E-STEM program; a grade 7-8 Spanish language program; Child Study Team Services; Speech/Language; and Special Education. The Special Education program offers a full continuum of services for children with disabilities including IShine and Home Base programs. Chorus, band and orchestra programs are available for students in grades four through eight. An example of the interage connections students make is the Parkview tile mural project. After a year-long initiative, involving students from Pre-K to grade 8, the permanent PEACE (Peace, Equity, Action, Community and Environment) mosaic mural near the cafeteria and the main entrance to the building was unveiled at a school-wide assembly on May 26, 2011. The project was funded with a grant that allowed local artists and a local tile company to work with students across the age spectrum for a month. P.E.A.C.E. Program The P.E.A.C.E. Program (originally called AESOP) began in 1989 as a collaboration between parents, community members, and teachers offering special classes taught by parents and others from the community providing a world community focus to the entire Parkview program. AESOP stood for Academic Enrichment Special Options Program. Reorganized in the fall of 2002, A.E.S.O.P. incorporated cultural studies (Affirming Diversity), environmental education including the School Forest (Environmental Stewardship), service learning opportunities (Service to our Community and Ownership as Responsible Citizens), and the Peace Program (Peace in our World). On October 1, 2010, the AESOP Program became the P.E.A.C.E. Program. Five weeks throughout the school year are chosen to focus on a letter in PEACE (Peace, Equity, Action, Community, Environment). Each grade level develops specific activities they will complete during these weeks. * Peace --- Promoting peace in our world * Equity --- Equitable acceptance * Action --- Acting with responsibility to others, ourselves, and places * Community --- Community building through service learning * Environment --- Encouraging earth friendly endeavors Parkview Center School was dedicated as an International Peace Site in 1995 and displays their Peace Pole next to the building's entrance. Recipient of the National Blue Ribbon School Award- Category: High Performing - 2010 \\"The US Department of Education Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and private elementary, middle, and high schools that are either high performing or have improved student achievement to high levels, especially among disadvantaged students.

The school also started looking at other ways to reduce, reuse, and recycle.  Emmy Award  In 2011 Parkview Center School and their partners won a 2011 Upper Midwest Regional Emmy Award. The video is a guide to school recycling initiated and funded by Saint Paul - Ramsey County Public Health, produced by the City of Roseville, filmed and edited by CTV North Suburbs, and starring students and staff at Roseville's Parkview Center School. \\"Boxes, Bottles and Banana Peels: A Guide To School Recycling,\\" won first place in the \\"Education/Schools - Program/Special/Series\\" category of the Regional Emmy Award competition of The Upper Midwest Chapter of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The video offers a step-by-step guide for schools considering establishing or improving a program for recycling paper, bottles cans and food leftovers. Urban School Forest Parkview has a school forest, an official designation bestowed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in 1993. The school forest is an outdoor classroom where students learn and apply math, art, science, language arts, and geography while gaining an appreciation and awareness of natural resources. School forests promote peace through use of environmental action in schools and community with participation from the Department of Natural Resources; the local Forestry office; local community leaders and members; and parents. Parkview is part of a network of just 120 school forests, out of Minnesota's 2,006 public schools, located around the state. Trees planted by students in 1993, led by an active team of parents, teachers, and natural resource professionals, literally transformed the landscape around the school. School Forest projects continue to include planting and landscaping projects on the school grounds. Periodically these projects are featured on the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources web site, the latest in 2012. Web Presence Parkview Center School was one of the first schools in Roseville Area Schools District 623 to have a website thanks to the efforts of three parent volunteers, the University of Minnesota School of Forestry (now part of the College of Natural Resources), and the staff of the University of Minnesota Remote Sensing Lab. The page was first posted during the spring of 1995. On October 1, 1996, the pages were moved to the Roseville Area Schools website. Parent volunteers Pam Jakes, Jerrilyn Thompson, and Dorothy Anderson envisioned a School Forest program at Parkview and part of that vision included putting the school on the web in 1994, hosted by the Department of Forest Resources, GIS and Remote Sensing Laboratory and webmaster Steve Lime. The Parkview website moved during the summer of 1996 to the Roseville Area Schools district website.

Kistler represented Pennsylvania as its Democratic National Committeeman from 1928 through 1936. In 1930, he was the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate seat left vacant by the disqualification of William Vare, but lost to Labor Secretary James Davis in one of the most lopsided defeats in state history.  Political career  Kistler first became interested in politics and international affairs after high school. He became involved in politics with the campaign of 1914 with A. Mitchell Palmer and Vance McCormick in rehabilitating the Democratic party. Kistler later became involved with the Pennsylvania Democratic National Committee, until he was elected as the Democratic National Committeeman in 1928. In 1930, Kistler was selected as the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in that year's election. He lost in one of the most lopsided defeats in state history. Kistler was an anti-Prohibition “wet” candidate, and it is likely that it was this position that cost Kistler the election. Kistler sided with the leaders of the Democratic National Committee, Chairman John Raskob and Executive Chairman Jouett Shouse in wanting to align the Democratic Party in support of big business. Kistler was a noted supporter of Al Smith since 1926, and remained something of a figurehead for Al Smith supporters in the party. As Franklin Delano Roosevelt rose in popularity within the Democratic Party, Kistler was reelected as national committeeman in order to assure Al Smith supporters. By 1936, Kistler stepped down from his position in the party as support for FDR increased. Kistler was strongly anti-FDR, especially with his New Deal policies. Kistler was aligned with Al Smith on the New Deal, agreeing it was too radical and would not even bring about the change it was intended to create. Even after he was done working with the Democratic National Committee, Kistler continued to voice his opinion on FDR’s presidency, strongly protesting his third term bid as a move towards “dictatorship.” Kistler was highly involved in his party, both locally and nationally. Kistler met with the local Young Democrats club of Lock Haven. From 1928 to 1932, Kistler personally financed the Democratic State headquarters in Philadelphia so that the party could keep offices open.  Business career  Kistler carried on his family’s tannery business in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, which was started by his grandfather in Tannersville, Pennsylvania in 1840. He provided old age pensions to his employees. Aside from his business, Kistler ran a 120 acre model farm not far from Lock Haven. He was also the vice president of the First National Bank of Lock Haven. Kistler owned The Lock Haven Express Printing Company after its merger in 1917.  Personal life  Sedgwick Kistler and his wife, Bertha Kaul, had one daughter Gertrude Kistler (b. August 11, 1907), who drowned in the Merced River on a family trip to Yosemite, California on July 7, 1920 at the age of 12. Kistler himself, also at times along with his wife, funded many philanthropic projects. He funded the construction for housing for nurses at the Lock Haven hospital. He made donations to the Ross Library and local churches of various denominations. Kistler and his wife made generous donations to Rosemont College in Rosemont, Pennsylvania in memory of Gertrude. They specifically funded the construction of the library and annual student awards, both named in Gertrude’s honor. Kistler was Presbyterian, and was locally involved with the Presbyterian Brotherhood in Lock Haven.

It was located on the banks of the Llano River in Llano County, and no trace of the settlement remains today. The community was named after German artist and social activist Bettina von Arnim and was one of five attempted by the Darmstadt Forty. It was also known as the Darmstaedter Kolonie. The community was sponsored by the Adelsverein, and founded on idealistic philosophies of European freethinkers of the day. It is notable for the community's camaraderie and mutually respectful relations with local indigenous tribes. Lack of a formal community framework caused Bettina to fail within a year of its founding. History The colony had its beginnings in 1846 in Darmstadt, Giessen, and Heidelberg, where Prince Carl of Solms- Braunfels delivered speeches on behalf of the Adelsverein, promoting Texas as a utopian frontier for university graduates. The Darmstadt Forty was a freethinker organization founded by Hermann Spiess, Ferdinand Ludwig Herff, and Gustav Schleicher, and based on ideals of Étienne Cabet and Charles Fourier. The Darmstadt Forty group set sail with dogs, goods, supplies, and an array of musical instruments aboard the St. Pauli from Hamburg in April 1847, arriving in Galveston on July 17. From Galveston they sailed to Indianola, where Adelsverein Commissioner-General John O. Meusebach had arranged for numerous wagons to haul the group and its freight inland. They were paid $10,000 in gold to help finance the first year of their settlement. During the four weeks it took them to travel to New Braunfels, the trek took on the ambiance of a collegiate party, with beer and singing and youthful high spiritedness filling the journey. Spiess and Meusebach scouted the area of the Llano River and chose the location for Bettina. Member Louis Reinhardt described the Llano River as so pure and crystal clear they named it the Silvery Llano. Upon reaching the site of Bettina, the group unloaded their musical instruments and began to sing their favorite songs. An adobe house was constructed with an outer siding of 10,000 shingles carved from a single pecan tree. The house was topped with a weather vane made by August Strauss. As made possible in part by the Meusebach–Comanche Treaty, the group's interactions with local indigenous tribes were cordial. Reinhardt listed seven tribes among the colony's visitors: Comanche, Lipan Apache, Waco, Delaware, Kickapoo, Choctaw and Shawnee. The colonists and the tribes shared food and goods, and tried to learn each other's languages. Reinhardt claimed that the indigenous people usually gave back three times more than the colonists gave them. The downfall of the colony was brought about by its own ideals of having a community not regulated by authority figures. Conflicts arose between individuals over who would shoulder the bulk of the workload. Only one crop ever came to fruition, which was 200 bushels of corn. After the Adelsverein's funding ran out, members of the group gradually drifted elsewhere.

Goodman (born November 9, 1945)Goodman, Morris (1985). The Miracle Man: An Inspiring Story of Motivation and Courage. Miracle Man Productions, Inc. . is an American motivational speaker and author. Goodman has been called \\"The Miracle Man\\" following his recovery from a plane crash which left him paralyzed and unable to move, breathe, talk or swallow. Biography In the summer of 1970 Goodman \\"was a college dropout, lacking purpose and direction\\" according to his 1985 autobiography. At a local book store, Goodman found the 1937 book Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill,Success Magazine: \\"Morris Goodman: Miracle Man\\" June, 2013 http://www.success.com/article/morris- goodman-miracle-man as well as other books and tapes by motivational speakers such as Zig Ziglar. Following this, Goodman sought a sales career in the insurance industry, where his uncle worked. Within a year, he had joined the Million Dollar Round Table, an association of insurance salesmen. Within ten years, he was running his own company, Morris Goodman and Associates. In March 1981 Goodman had obtained his pilot's license and had bought his own airplane, a Cessna 172. On March 10, 1981, Goodman took a flight around Chesapeake Bay and the southern tip of the Delmarva Peninsula. Without any warning, the plane's engine lost power. Goodman attempted to maneuver the aircraft back toward the airstrip in Cape Charles, Virginia, to make an emergency landing. (The official NTSB accident report makes no mention of engine trouble.)https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief.aspx?ev_id=28506&key;=0 As he approached the runway, the plane flew through a low-hung set of power lines, crashed to the ground, and flipped over. Goodman broke his C-1 (atlas) and C-2 (axis) cervical vertebrae, and was left fully paralyzed. He was unable to breathe, talk, or swallow on his own,\\"CNN.com - Larry King Live Transcripts\\" 2006-10-27. http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0610/27/lkl.01.html. and could only communicate by blinking his eyes.\\"The Violet Ray Magazine, August 2, 2010 http://issuu.com/violetray/docs/tvr_go_green_dec08. After initial treatment at a local hospital in nearby Nassawadox, Virginia, Goodman was moved to Norfolk General in Norfolk, Virginia, where surgery was performed. Goodman's sister, Pat Waldo, realized that Goodman was conscious by noticing his limited eye movement. Waldo constructed a series of charts which contained the alphabet and other important subjects, each item correlating to a particular number. Goodman was able to blink his eyes for the number of times to relate to a particular object on each chart, which allowed Goodman to communicate in a limited capacity. On April 6, 1981, Goodman was transferred to the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville, Virginia. After weeks of intense practice, voluntarily using other abdominal muscles, Goodman was able to take his first breath without the use of a machine. Doctors slowly reduced the settings on Goodman's ventilator until he was finally able to breathe on his own. Soon Goodman began working with speech therapists until he was able to utter a single word - \\"Mama.\\" On June 1, 1981, Goodman was moved to The Towers - a former rehabilitation center at UVA Medical Center where he began to eat, and began working on learning to walk again. On July 6, 1981, Goodman was admitted to the Woodrow Wilson Rehabilitation Center in Fishersville, Virginia. With physical therapy and occupational therapy, Goodman continued to work to improve his leg muscle strength and stamina until he could stand on his own. After several weeks, Goodman was able to walk unassisted, and was released on November 13, 1981. Morris has since gone on to become a world- renowned motivational speaker who has worked with many Fortune 500 companies and religious organizations. Media appearances Goodman wrote a book about his experiences, The Miracle Man: An Inspiring Story of Motivation and Courage. A motivational/training short film about Morris' experience was also made, and a feature film of his story, written and to be directed and produced by filmmaker Brian Jude is currently in development. Goodman also appeared in Rhonda Byrne's documentary film and book The Secret.

After competing in amateur events since he was a toddler and representing Stanford University on a golf scholarship, Woods left college after two years to turn professional at the age of 20. 1996–1998: Early years and first major win USS George Washington. With the announcement \\"Hello, World.\\" Tiger Woods became a professional golfer in August 1996 and signed endorsement deals worth $40 million from Nike, Inc. and $20 million from Titleist. These endorsement contracts were the highest in golf history up to that point. He played his first professional golf event at the Greater Milwaukee Open, tying for 60th place, recorded a hole-in-one, and would win two events in the next three months to qualify for the Tour Championship. For his efforts, Woods was named Sports Illustrated's 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. He began his tradition of wearing a red shirt during the final round of tournaments, which was a link to his college days at Stanford. The following April, Woods won his first major, The Masters, with a record score of 18-under-par 270, by a record margin of 12 strokes. The landmark victory made Woods the tournament's youngest-ever winner, as well as its first African- American winner (and its first Asian-American winner). Woods set 20 Masters records in 1997 and tied six others. He went on to win another three PGA Tour events that year, and on June 15, 1997, in only his 42nd week as a professional, rose to number one in the Official World Golf Ranking, the fastest-ever ascent to world No. 1. At the conclusion of the 1997 season, Woods was named PGA Player of the Year, the first time a golfer had won the award in just his second year as a professional. While expectations for Woods were high, his play faded in the second half of 1997, and in 1998 he only won a single PGA Tour event. He answered critics of his \\"slump\\" and what seemed to be wavering form by maintaining he was undergoing extensive swing changes with his coach, Butch Harmon, and was hoping to do better in the future. 1999–2002: Slams In June 1999, Woods won the Memorial Tournament, a victory that touched off one of the greatest sustained periods of dominance in the history of men's golf. He completed his 1999 campaign by winning his last four starts —- including the PGA Championship -— and finished the season with eight wins, a feat not achieved since 1974. Woods was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year and Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for the second time in three years. Picking up where he had left off in 1999, Woods started 2000 with his fifth consecutive victory and began a record-setting season. He extended his win streak to six at the AT&T; Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in February with a memorable comeback—trailing by seven strokes with seven holes to play, he finished eagle-birdie-par-birdie for a 64 and a two-stroke victory. His six consecutive wins were the most since Ben Hogan in 1948 and only five behind Byron Nelson's record of eleven in a row. At his next tournament, the Buick Invitational, he finished tied for second, breaking the streak, but earned enough money to put him at the top of the PGA Tour's career money list, a position he has held ever since. In the 2000 U.S. Open, he broke or tied nine U.S. Open records with his 15-stroke win, including Old Tom Morris's record for the largest victory margin ever in a major championship, which had stood since 1862. He led by a record ten strokes going into the final round, and Sports Illustrated called it \\"the greatest performance in golf history.\\" In the 2000 Open Championship at St Andrews, which he won by eight strokes, he set the record for lowest score to par (−19) in any major tournament, and Woods at one time held at least a share of that record in all four major championships (since eclipsed by Rory McIlroy's −16 at the 2011 U.S. Open and Jason Day's −20 at the 2015 PGA Championship). At 24, he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career Grand Slam. Woods's major championship streak was seriously threatened at the 2000 PGA Championship, when Bob May went head-to- head with Woods on Sunday at Valhalla Golf Club. However, Woods played the last twelve holes of regulation seven under par, and won a three-hole aggregate playoff over May with a birdie on the first hole and pars on the next two. He joined Ben Hogan (1953) as the only other player to win three professional majors in one season. Three weeks later, he won his third straight start on Tour at the Bell Canadian Open, becoming only the second man after Lee Trevino in 1971 to win the Triple Crown of Golf (U.S., British, and Canadian Opens) in one year. By the end of Woods' 2000 campaign, he had won three consecutive majors, nine PGA Tour events, and had set or tied 27 Tour records. Of the twenty events he entered, he finished in the top three fourteen times. His adjusted scoring average of 67.79 and his actual scoring average of 68.17 were the lowest in PGA Tour history, besting his own record of 68.43 in 1999 and Byron Nelson's average of 68.33 in 1945. He was named the 2000 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, becoming the first athlete to be honored twice, a feat that was matched by LeBron James in 2016. Woods was ranked as the twelfth best golfer of all time by Golf Digest magazine just four years after he turned professional. The following season, Woods continued to dominate. His 2001 Masters Tournament win marked the only time in the modern era of the Grand Slam that any player has held all four major championship titles at the same time, a feat now known as the \\"Tiger Slam\\". It is not viewed as a true Grand Slam, however, because it was not achieved in a calendar year. Surprisingly, he was not a factor in the three remaining majors of the year, but finished with the most PGA Tour wins in the season, with five. In 2002, he started strongly, joining Nick Faldo (1989–90) and Jack Nicklaus (1965–66) as the only men to have won back-to-back Masters Tournaments. Two months later, Woods was the only player under par at the U.S. Open, and resurrected buzz about the calendar Grand Slam, which had eluded him in 2000. All eyes were on Woods at the Open Championship, but his third round score of 81 in dreadful weather at Muirfield ended his Grand Slam hopes. At the PGA Championship, he nearly repeated his 2000 feat of winning three majors in one year, but bogeys at the 13th and 14th holes in the final round cost him the championship by one stroke. Nonetheless, he took home the money title, Vardon Trophy, and Player of the Year honors for the fourth year in a row. 2003–2004: Swing adjustments Tiger and his father Earl Woods at a press conference at Fort Bragg Woods putting at Torrey Pines Golf Course during a practice round at the 2008 U.S. Open The next phase of Woods's career saw him remain among the top competitors on the tour, but lose his dominating edge. He did not win a major in 2003 or 2004, falling to second in the PGA Tour money list in 2003 and fourth in 2004. Nevertheless he was named 2003 PGA Player of the Year and PGA Tour Player of the Year after winning two World Golf Championships and finishing fourth at the Open Championship. In September 2004, his record streak of 264 consecutive weeks as the world's top-ranked golfer ended at the Deutsche Bank Championship, when Vijay Singh won and overtook Woods in the Official World Golf Ranking. Many commentators were puzzled by Woods's \\"slump,\\" offering explanations that ranged from his rift with swing coach Butch Harmon to his engagement and marriage. At the same time, he let it be known that he was again working on changes to his swing, this time in hopes of reducing the wear and tear on his surgically repaired left knee, which was subjected to severe stress in the 1998–2003 version of his swing. Again, he anticipated that once the adjustments were complete, he would return to his previous form. Woods changed coaches, working with Hank Haney after leaving Harmon. 2005–2007: Resurgence In the 2005 season, Woods quickly returned to his winning ways. He won the Buick Invitational in January, and in March he outplayed Phil Mickelson to win the Ford Championship at Doral and temporarily return to the Official World Golf Ranking number one position (Singh displaced him once again two weeks later). In April, he finally broke his \\"drought\\" in the majors by winning the 2005 Masters Tournament in a playoff, which regained him the number one spot in the World Rankings. Singh and Woods swapped the #1 position several times over the next couple of months, but by early July Woods had reclaimed the top spot, propelled further by a victory at the 2005 Open Championship, his 10th major. He went on to win six official money events on the PGA Tour in 2005, topping the money list for the sixth time in his career. His 2005 wins also included two at the World Golf Championships. Woods on the green at The Masters in 2006. For Woods, the year 2006 was markedly different from 2005. While he began just as dominantly (winning the first two PGA tournaments he entered on the year) and was in the hunt for his fifth Masters championship in April, he never mounted a Sunday charge to defend his title, allowing Phil Mickelson to claim the green jacket. Death of father On May 3, 2006, Woods' father, mentor and inspiration, Earl, died at age 74 after a lengthy battle with prostate cancer. Woods took a nine-week hiatus from the PGA Tour to be with his family. When he returned for the 2006 U.S. Open, the rust was evident—he missed the cut at Winged Foot, the first time he had missed the cut at a major as a professional, and ended his record-tying streak of 39 consecutive cuts made at majors. Still, a tie for second at the Western Open just three weeks later showed him poised to defend his Open Championship crown at Hoylake. Returns to top form At the 2006 Open Championship, Woods almost exclusively used long irons off the tee (he hit driver only one time the entire week—the 16th hole of the first round), he missed just four fairways all week (hitting the fairway 92% of the time), and his score of −18 to par (three eagles, 19 birdies, 43 pars, and seven bogeys) was just one off of his major championship record −19, set at St Andrews in 2000 (since eclipsed by Jason Day). The victory was an emotional one for Woods, who dedicated his play to his father's memory. Four weeks later at the 2006 PGA Championship, Woods again won in dominating fashion, making only three bogeys, tying the record for fewest in a major. He finished the tournament at 18-under-par, equaling the to-par record in the PGA that he shares with Bob May from 2000 (since eclipsed by Jason Day). In August 2006, he won his 50th professional tournament at the Buick Open—and at the age of thirty years and seven months, he became the youngest golfer to do so. He ended the year by winning six consecutive PGA Tour events, and won the three most prestigious awards given by the PGA Tour (Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Byron Nelson Awards) in the same year for a record seventh time. At the close of his first 11 seasons, Woods's 54 wins and 12 major wins had surpassed the all-time eleven-season PGA Tour total win record of 51 (set by Byron Nelson) and total majors record of 11 (set by Jack Nicklaus). He was named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year for a record-tying fourth time. Woods and tennis star Roger Federer, who share a major sponsor, first met at the 2006 U.S. Open tennis final. Since then, they have attended each other's events and have voiced their mutual appreciation for each other's talents. Woods began 2007 with a two-stroke victory at the Buick Invitational for his third straight win at the event and his seventh consecutive win on the PGA Tour. The victory marked the fifth time he had won his first tournament of the season. With this win, he became the third man (after Jack Nicklaus and Sam Snead) to win at least five times in three different events on the PGA Tour (his two other events are the WGC- Bridgestone Invitational and WGC-CA Championship). He earned his second victory of the year at the WGC-CA Championship for his third consecutive and sixth overall win at the event. With this victory, he became the first player to have three consecutive victories in five different events. At the 2007 Masters Tournament, Woods was in the final group on the last day of a major for the thirteenth time in his career, but unlike the previous twelve occasions, he was unable to come away with the win. He finished tied for second two strokes behind winner Zach Johnson. Tiger Woods drives the ball down range at the inaugural Earl Woods Memorial Pro-Am Tournament, part of the AT&T; National PGA Tour event, July 2007. Woods earned his third victory of the season by two strokes at the Wachovia Championship, the 24th different PGA Tour tournament he won. He has collected at least three wins in a season nine times in his 12-year career. At the U.S. Open, he was in the final group for the fourth consecutive major championship, but began the day two strokes back and finished tied for second once again. His streak of never having come from behind to win on the final day of a major continued. In search of a record- tying third consecutive Open Championship, Woods fell out of contention with a second-round 75, and never mounted a charge over the weekend. Although his putting was solid (he sank a 90-footer in the first round), his iron play held him back. \\"I wasn't hitting the ball as close as I needed to all week,\\" he said, after he finished tied for twelfth, five strokes off the pace. In early August, Woods won his record 14th World Golf Championships event at the WGC- Bridgestone Invitational by 8 strokes for his third consecutive and sixth victory overall at the event. He became the first golfer to win the same event three straight times on two different occasions (1999–2001) and (2005–2007). The following week, he won his second straight PGA Championship by defeating Woody Austin by two strokes. He became the first golfer to win the PGA Championship in back-to-back seasons on two different occasions: 1999–2000 and 2006–2007. He became the second golfer, after Sam Snead, to have won at least five events on the PGA Tour in eight different seasons. Woods earned his 60th PGA Tour victory at the BMW Championship by shooting a course record 63 in the final round to win by two strokes. He sank a fifty-foot putt in the final round and missed only two fairways on the weekend. He led the field in most birdies for the tournament, and ranked in the top five in driving accuracy, driving distance, putts per round, putts per green, and greens in regulation. Woods finished his 2007 season with a runaway victory at the Tour Championship to capture his fourth title in his last five starts of the year. He became the only two-time winner of the event, and the champion of the inaugural FedEx Cup. In his 16 starts on Tour in 2007, his adjusted scoring average was 67.79, matching his own record set in 2000. His substantial leads over the second, third, and fourth players were similar in 2000 (1.46 (Phil Mickelson), 1.52 (Ernie Els), 1.66 (David Duval)) and 2007 (1.50 (Els), 1.51 (Justin Rose), 1.60 (Steve Stricker)). 2008: Injury-shortened season Woods started the 2008 season with an eight-stroke victory at the Buick Invitational. The win marked his 62nd PGA Tour victory, tying him with Arnold Palmer for fourth on the all-time list. This marked his sixth victory at the event, the sixth time he has begun the PGA Tour season with a victory, and his third PGA Tour win in a row. The following week, he was trailing by four strokes going into the final round of the Dubai Desert Classic, but made six birdies on the back nine for a dramatic one-stroke victory. He took home his 15th World Golf Championships event at the Accenture Match Play Championship with a record- breaking 8 & 7 victory in the final. In his next event, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Woods got off to a slow start, finishing the first round at even par and tied for 34th place. After finishing the third round in a five-way tie for first place, he completed his fifth consecutive PGA Tour victory with a dramatic putt on the 18th hole to defeat Bart Bryant by a stroke. It was also his fifth career victory in this event. Geoff Ogilvy stopped Woods's run at the WGC-CA Championship, a tournament Woods had won in each of the previous three years. He remains the only golfer to have had more than one streak of at least five straight wins on the PGA Tour. Despite bold predictions that Woods might again challenge for the Grand Slam, he did not mount a serious charge at the 2008 Masters Tournament, struggling with his putter through each round. He would still finish alone in second, three strokes behind the champion, Trevor Immelman. On April 15, 2008, he underwent his third left knee arthroscopic surgery in Park City, Utah, and missed two months on the PGA Tour. The first surgery he had was in 1994, when he had a benign tumor removed, and the second in December 2002. He was named Men's Fitness's Fittest Athlete in the June/July 2008 issue. Tiger Woods walks off the 8th green at Torrey Pines during a practice round at the 2008 U.S. Open Woods returned for the 2008 U.S. Open in one of the most anticipated golf groupings in history including Woods, Phil Mickelson and Adam Scott, the top three golfers in the world. Woods struggled the first day, notching a double bogey on his first hole. He would end the round at +1 (72), four shots off the lead. He scored −3 (68) his second day, still paired with Mickelson, managing 5 birdies, 1 eagle and 4 bogeys. On the third day of the tournament, he began with a double bogey once again and was trailing by five shots with six holes to play. However, he finished the round by making two eagle putts, a combined in length, and a chip-in birdie to take a one-shot lead into the final round. His final putt assured that he would be in the final group for the sixth time in the last eight major championships. On Sunday, June 15, Woods began the day with another double bogey, and trailed Rocco Mediate by one stroke after 71 holes. He winced after several of his tee shots, and sometimes made an effort to keep weight off his left foot. Woods was behind by one stroke when he reached the final hole. Left with a putt for birdie, he sank it to force an 18-hole playoff with Mediate on Monday. Despite leading by as many as three strokes at one point in the playoff, Woods again dropped back and needed to birdie the 18th to force sudden death with Mediate, and did so. Woods made par on the first sudden-death hole; Mediate subsequently missed his par putt, giving Woods his 14th major championship. After the tournament, Mediate said \\"This guy does things that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination,\\" and Kenny Perry added, \\"He beat everybody on one leg.\\" His third win in the U.S. Open tied him with Bobby Jones for the career lead in USGA championships won, with nine. Two days after winning the U.S. Open, Woods announced that he would be required to undergo reconstructive anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery on his left knee and would miss the remainder of the 2008 golf season, including the final two major championships: The Open Championship, and the PGA Championship. Woods also revealed that he had been playing for at least ten months with a torn ligament in his left knee, and sustained a double stress fracture in his left tibia while rehabbing after the surgery he had after the Masters. Publications throughout the world asserted his U.S. Open victory as \\"epic\\" and praised his efforts, especially after learning of the extent of his knee injury. Woods called it \\"My greatest ever championship – the best of the 14 because of all the things that have gone on over the past week.\\" Woods' absence from the remainder of the season caused PGA Tour TV ratings to decline. Overall viewership for the second half of the 2008 season saw a 46.8% decline as compared to 2007. 2009: Returning to the PGA Tour Called \\"one of the most anticipated returns in sports\\" by the Associated Press, Woods' first PGA Tour event after an eight-month layoff came at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. He lost to Tim Clark in the second round. His first stroke play event was the WGC-CA Championship at Doral, where he finished 9th (−11). Woods won his first title of the year at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he was five strokes behind Sean O'Hair entering the final round. Woods shot a final round 67 and made a birdie putt at the final hole to defeat O'Hair by one stroke. Afterwards, he would continue to perform consistently. At The Masters, he finished sixth, four strokes behind eventual winner Ángel Cabrera. Then, despite having the 18-hole lead at the Quail Hollow Championship, he finished two strokes behind Sean O'Hair. At The Players Championship, he played in the final group on Sunday, but finished eighth. Woods won his second event of 2009 at the Memorial Tournament. He trailed by four shots after three rounds but shot a final round 65, which included two consecutive birdies to end the tournament. The win was Woods' fourth at the event. Woods won his third event of the 2009 season on July 5 at the AT&T; National, an event hosted by Woods himself. However, for the third time going into a 2009 major, Woods failed to capitalize on his preceding win. Instead, at the 2009 Open Championship, played at Turnberry, he missed the cut for only the second time in a major championship since turning professional. On August 2, Woods captured the Buick Open for his fourth win of the season, with a three-shot victory over three other players. After firing an opening- round 71 that put him in 95th place and outside of the cutline, Woods responded with a second-round 63, nine-under-par, that vaulted him into contention. A third-round 65 put him atop the leaderboard and he coasted to victory with a final-round 69 for a 20-under 268 four-round total. This was his biggest turnaround pro victory to date. Woods won his 70th career event the following week at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. He went head-to-head against Pádraig Harrington on Sunday until the 16th, where Harrington made a triple-bogey-8 on the par-5 hole, and Woods made birdie. Tiger went on to win the event by four strokes over Harrington and Robert Allenby. At the 2009 PGA Championship, Woods shot a 5-under 67 to take the lead after the first round. He remained leader or co-leader through the second and third rounds. Going into the final round, Woods had a 2-stroke lead at 8-under. However, at the 68th hole, Woods was overtaken for the first time atop the leaderboard by Yang Yong-eun. Yang eventually won the tournament by three strokes over Woods, who finished second. It marked the first time that Woods failed to win a major when leading or co-leading after 54 holes, and the first time he had lost any tournament on American soil when leading by more than one shot. It also meant that Woods would end the year without a major for the first time since 2004. Woods won his 71st career title at the BMW Championship. The win moved him to first place in the FedEx Cup standings going into the final playoff event. It was his fifth win at the BMW Championship (including three wins as the Western Open) and marked the fifth time he had won an event five or more times in his career on the PGA Tour. Woods finished second at The Tour Championship to capture his second FedEx Cup title. At the 2009 Presidents Cup, Woods had a spectacular performance, winning all five of his matches at the event. He joined his friend Mark O'Meara, who won all five of his matches at the 1996 Presidents Cup, and Shigeki Maruyama, who accomplished this feat in the 1998 Presidents Cup. In all three instances, their respective teams won the competition. Woods was paired with Steve Stricker for all four partners' rounds of the competition, in foursomes and four-ball. On the first day of foursomes, they won 6 and 4 over the team of Ryo Ishikawa and Geoff Ogilvy. In Friday's match of four-ball, they won over the team of Ángel Cabrera and Geoff Ogilvy, 5 and 3. On Saturday, they beat the team of Tim Clark and Mike Weir after trailing for most of the match, by winning the 17th and 18th holes to win 1-up in morning foursomes, and in the afternoon four-ball they defeated the team of Ryo Ishikawa and Y. E. Yang by the score of 4 and 2. In the singles match, Woods was paired with his nemesis from the 2009 PGA Championship, Yang. Yang grabbed the quick 1-up lead on the first hole, but on the third hole lost the lead and Woods went on to win the match by a score of 6 and 5. In addition, Woods clinched the Cup for the United States, which was the first time ever in his career he had the honor and opportunity to do this in a team event competition. In November 2009, Woods was paid $3.3 million to play in the JBWere Masters, held at Kingston Heath in Melbourne, Australia from November 12 to 15. The event was sold out for the first time. He went on to win at 14 under par, two strokes over Australian Greg Chalmers, marking his 38th European Tour win and his first win on the PGA Tour of Australasia. 2010: Turbulent, winless season After his past marital infidelities became known, with massive worldwide media coverage which would eventually last for several months, Woods announced an indefinite break from competitive golf at the end of 2009. He apologized for his behaviour at a news conference held at PGA Tour headquarters on Feb. 19; the statement received live network coverage. In March 2010, he announced that he would be playing in the 2010 Masters. Missing the start of the 2010 season, Woods returned to competition for the 2010 Masters Tournament in Augusta, Georgia, starting on April 8, 2010, after a break lasting nearly 20 weeks. He began with a 4-under-par round of 68, his best ever start at the Masters, and remained in contention until nearly the end of the fourth day, eventually finishing the tournament tied for fourth. Woods next competed at the 2010 Quail Hollow Championship at the end of April, but missed the cut for just the sixth time of his career. He shot his second-worst round as a professional on April 30, a 7-over 79 during the second round to miss the 36-hole cut by eight strokes. Woods withdrew from The Players Championship during the fourth round, on May 9, later citing a neck injury. He had scored 70-71-71 in the first three rounds, and was two over par for the round, while playing the seventh hole, when he withdrew. Hank Haney, who had coached Woods since 2003, issued a statement resigning as his coach shortly after The Players Championship. Woods returned to competitive golf four weeks later to defend his title at The Memorial Tournament. He made the cut and went on to finish T19, his worst finish in that tournament since 2002. His next competitive tournament began June 17 at the U.S. Open held at Pebble Beach, the site of his 2000 win by a record 15 shots. After a relatively unspectacular performance through the first two rounds, Woods showed signs of his pre-2010 form, as he managed a back nine 31 en route to shooting a five- under-par 66 on Saturday, which would tie for the low round of the tournament and put him back into contention. However, he was unable to mount a charge on Sunday, despite the collapse of 54-hole leader Dustin Johnson, and went on to finish the tournament at three-over-par and in a tie for fourth place, repeating his top-5 result at the 2010 Masters Tournament. Woods then played in the AT&T; National in late June, which he had formerly hosted, before AT&T; dropped his personal sponsorship. He was the defending champion, and the favorite among many, but he struggled all four days of the tournament, failed to post a round under par, and tied for 46th place. Woods then flew to Ireland to play in a two-day charity event, the JP McManus Pro-Am, and then flew home to Florida to \\"see his kids\\", before preparing for The Open Championship just over a week later. He changed his putter for the Open Championship at St Andrews Old Course, saying he always struggled on slow greens and needed this new Nike Method 001 putter to \\"get the ball rolling faster and better\\". This was a somewhat surprising statement, considering he had won the previous two Open Championships held at St Andrews, in 2000 and 2005. It was the first time Woods had used any other putter than his Titleist Scotty Cameron since 1999. Woods putted well the first day of the tournament, shooting a 5-under 67, but wind gusts of over 40 mph suspended play for 66 minutes the next day at St Andrews, and Woods was never able to get anything going. It was the same story Saturday. He repeatedly missed short putts. He changed his putter back to his old Scotty Cameron for the final round, but did not putt any better. Woods finished 3-under overall, 13 shots behind winner Louis Oosthuizen (tied for 23rd place). Woods finished in 18-over par, tying for 78th place (second-to- last place) in the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational on August 8. He posted his worst four-round result as a professional golfer. Woods began working with Canadian golf coach Sean Foley in August 2010; the two had been discussing a possible partnership for several previous weeks. In the 2010 PGA Championship, played at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin, Woods made the 36-hole cut but failed to mount a challenge, ending in a tie for 28th place. Woods's inconsistent play in the 2010 FedEx Cup playoffs failed to qualify him into the top 30 players for The Tour Championship, for the first time since he turned professional in 1996. He had won the FedEx Cup in 2007 and 2009. He also failed to qualify on points for the 2010 Ryder Cup team, for the first time in his career. But captain Corey Pavin chose Woods as one of his four captain's picks. Woods, again partnering with Steve Stricker in pairs play, played inconsistently in terrible weather conditions at Celtic Manor in Wales; the matches were delayed several times when the course became unplayable, and the format had to be significantly modified and then even extended to a fourth day to complete the event. The U.S., entering as Cup holders, lost the Cup to the European team, by the narrowest possible margin, 14.5 to 13.5. However, Woods played impressive golf in his final-day singles match, winning decisively over Francesco Molinari. Woods then took an extended break from competition, to refine new techniques with Foley. He returned in early November, after more than a month off, at the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai, where he had placed 2nd in 2009, but failed to challenge seriously. Next was a visit to Thailand, his mother's birthplace, for a one-day Skins Game, honoring King Bhumibol. At the 2010 JBWere Masters, held near Melbourne, Australia in mid-November, Woods arrived as defending champion and was paid an appearance fee of more than $3 million. He charged late on the final day to finish in fourth place. Over his final six holes, Woods made two eagles, two birdies, and two pars, to end with a round of 6-under 65. Three weeks later, resuming his role as host of the elite-field Chevron World Challenge near Los Angeles (he had skipped the 2009 event because of personal crisis; the tournament serves as a primary benefactor of his charitable foundation), Woods put up three straight rounds in the 60s, and led going into the final round for the first time in 2010. But he struggled with his long-game control in mixed weather conditions on Sunday, and putted much worse than he had in previous rounds, winding up in a tie with Graeme McDowell after 72 holes. McDowell sank a birdie putt on the final green; Woods then sank his own short birdie putt to tie. McDowell again made birdie on the first playoff hole (the 18th) from to take the title, when Woods missed from shorter range. The playoff loss meant that Woods went winless for an entire season, for the first time since turning professional. However, Woods finished the 2010 season ranked #2 in the world. He again used the Nike Method 003 putter for his final two events of 2010. 2011: Work in progress Woods at a charity event in October 2011 Woods opened his 2011 season at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course near San Diego. He has enjoyed tremendous success there, with six past Tour titles and a dramatic playoff win in the 2008 U.S. Open, but was making his first appearance at the course since that 2008 major win. Woods played strongly for the first two rounds, scoring 69-69 to sit five strokes behind halfway leader Bill Haas. But on the weekend, many wayward approach shots found greenside bunkers, and Woods was unable to recover sufficiently well to stay in contention. He scored 74-75 to end at one-under- par 287, 15 strokes behind winner Bubba Watson, in a tie for 44th place. It was the worst season-opening performance of his career. Woods made his next appearance at the Dubai Desert Classic, an event he had previously won twice and always ended inside the top five, in six previous appearances. Woods, ranked #3 in the world, was grouped with #1 Lee Westwood and #2 Martin Kaymer for the first two rounds. Woods started with 71 and scored 6-under 66 in round two to move into contention, and stayed in the hunt with 72 for round three, but struggled on Sunday with 75, to end in a tie for 20th, at 4-under 284, seven shots back of winner Álvaro Quirós. During the final round of that competition, Woods spat on the ground a few feet from the hole, after missing a putt at the 12th green. The incident was shown on televised coverage worldwide. Woods apologized for the incident in which he breached the European Tour's code of conduct; he will be fined an undisclosed sum. Later starters had to play across the area where Woods spat. Sportswriter John Feinstein stated on Golf Channel a few days after the incident that Woods is in fact the most-fined player in the history of the PGA Tour. Woods made his next appearance at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, a World Golf Championship event for the top 64 players. He was playing in this tournament for the first time since Accenture dropped his personal sponsorship some 14 months earlier. Woods, a three-time champion who has more match wins in the event than any other player, came in as one of the four #1 seeds, but lost in the first round on the first sudden-death hole, the 19th, to Thomas Bjørn, after the two players had tied their 18-hole match. On February 27, Woods had his world ranking drop to #5. Woods played next in the WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral's Blue Monster course, where he had never missed the top ten in any event. Woods was never in contention to win, but kept his streak going with a tie for tenth place, scoring 70-74-70-66, for eight-under-par 280, eight shots behind winner Nick Watney. His final round tied for best of the day, and was his lowest 18-hole score on the PGA Tour since the third round of the 2010 U.S. Open. After the final round, Woods commented that he was making good progress on his game with coach Sean Foley, being able to identify and correct faults during his final round at Doral. Woods put a Nike heel-shafted blade putter in play for the final two rounds, replacing his center-shafted Titleist Scotty Cameron blade model; he explained afterward that he had wanted a hotter putter to tackle Doral's grainy greens. Woods competed in the 2011 Tavistock Cup, a charity interclub team event, held at his home course, Isleworth Country Club, but represented the new club Albany, of the Bahamas, where he is an investor. Woods teamed with Arjun Atwal the first day to post a better-ball score of 64, and shot 69 on his own ball on day two. Woods next competed in the 2011 Arnold Palmer Invitational, an event he has won six times. Woods showed inconsistent play over the four rounds, carding 73-68-74-72 to finish at one-under-par 287, in a tie for 24th place, seven shots behind winner Martin Laird. His world ranking dropped to #7 the following week, the lowest it has been since the week before the 1997 Masters. Woods contended strongly in the 2011 Masters Tournament, scoring 71-66-74-67 to finish at ten-under 278, in a tie for fourth place, four shots behind winner Charl Schwartzel. His ranking rose to #5. Woods was sidelined from tournament play until May 12 by two leg injuries incurred in round three of the Masters. He entered the 2011 Players Championship, but withdrew after nine holes of the first round, with a score of +6, as his injuries caused him to limp noticeably. His world rank fell to #15 on June 5, his lowest since early 1997, more than 14 years ago. On June 6, Woods stated that he would remain with longtime agent Mark Steinberg after the agent's contract was not renewed by the International Management Group. The following day, he announced that he would not be playing in the 2011 U.S. Open, set to begin June 16, due to continued pain in his left Achilles tendon and left anterior cruciate ligament. Woods stated he was very disappointed to be unable to play in the season's second major championship, but that he was listening to his doctors, continuing to work on his recovery, and planning for the long term. Woods also missed the 2011 British Open, still recovering from injury. He fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams following the AT&T; National in early July; Williams now caddies for Adam Scott. Woods returned to tournament play in early August, following a break of 11 weeks, at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, where he is a seven-time champion. He had Bryon Bell as caddy; Bell is a childhood friend, former high school golf teammate, and current employee of Tiger Woods Design; Bell had caddied for Woods on several previous occasions, dating back to amateur golf. Woods stated in a pre-tournament press conference that Bell is serving temporarily as his caddie, and that he has yet to make a decision on a permanent replacement for Williams. Woods also stated he is \\"completely healthy\\". He tied for 37th place after rounds of 68-70-71-70, as Adam Scott won with a 17-under-par total 263. Woods finished last in the field of 76 players in driving accuracy, hitting only slightly more than 40% of his fairways. Fred Couples, 2011 Presidents Cup U.S. team captain, stated he would use a captain's pick to select Woods for the team should he not automatically qualify.pgatour.com, August 9, 2011 Woods had his contract discontinued by sponsor Tag Heuer, a luxury Swiss watchmaker, on August 10.thegolfchannel.com, Aug. 10, 2011 Woods, again with Bell on his bag, missed the cut at the 2011 PGA Championship, held at Atlanta Athletic Club, for the first time in that major and for only the third time in a major championship as a professional. After starting with three birdies and two pars over his first five holes, he collapsed to shoot 77, his highest first-round major score since turning pro in 1996, and followed this up with 73 the second day, to finish at ten-over-par 150, missing the cut by six strokes. He had five holes with double bogey or worse in 36 holes; the only other previous event where he had this was the 2007 Arnold Palmer Invitational. Woods also failed to qualify for the 2011 FedEx Cup playoffs since he is outside the top 125 qualifying point earners. Woods competed in the Frys.com Open, part of the PGA Tour Fall Series for the first time in his career, finishing tied for 30th place, ten shots behind the winner, Bryce Molder. In mid-November 2011 Woods rose to 50th in the Official World Golf Ranking, from a low of #58, after finishing third at the Emirates Australian Open, his best result to date in 2011. In addition, Woods made the clinching point at the Presidents Cup when he defeated Aaron Baddeley in their singles match. Woods broke a career-long winless streak of 107 weeks when he birdied the last two holes to capture his fifth career win in the Chevron World Challenge, by one stroke over Zach Johnson, in early December. The Chevron is an elite-level invitational event with 18 of the world's top players, and benefits the Tiger Woods Foundation; Woods donated his entire prize, $1.2 million, to that charitable organization.pgatour.com, December 4, 2011, Tiger ends two-year winless streak 2012: Back to form and winning again His 2012 season started at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship on the European Tour in late January. For the first two days of play Tiger was grouped with Rory McIlroy and world No.1 Luke Donald. He shot under par rounds of 70 and 69 on Thursday and Friday respectively, which left him in joint 4th place at 5-under par. His low round of the week came on Saturday, shooting a 6-under par 66, giving him the joint lead with England's Robert Rock. Woods struggled on Sunday and couldn't mount a big enough charge, shooting a level par 72 and settling for joint 3rd place. Woods' second tournament of the year came at the AT&T; Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in early February which he had not played since 2002. His amateur partner for the week was Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Woods shot solid rounds of 68-68-67 on the first three days, and began Sunday in third place, four shots behind leader Charlie Wi. However, he struggled with his putting and shot a final round 75 while his playing partner Phil Mickelson shot a 64 and won the tournament. His next tournament was the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona. Woods battled to win his first round match against Gonzalo Fernández-Castaño, 1-up, and then played Nick Watney in the second round. On the 18th hole, Woods had to make birdie to extend the match, however his 5-foot putt missed and he was knocked out of the tournament. Woods commented that his putting was hindered technically and required some work after battling with it throughout the round. The following week Woods teed off at the Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Woods commented that he had referred back to putting basics instead of new technique he had been applying. Woods' putting over the first three days of tournament play was noticeably better, but the ball was struggling to fall into the hole. Tiger began the fourth round on 2-under par, 9 shots behind leader Rory McIlroy. After parring the first hole and being delayed by adverse weather, Woods returned and played the remaining 17 holes in 8-under par including two eagles and no bogeys. A birdie-eagle finish set up Woods to possibly claim the title, however McIlroy kept his cool and won the tournament. Tiger finished joint second, and the round also marked his lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. Woods played the following week at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami, Florida. Tiger spent the first three days near the top of the leaderboard and shot 72-67-68 to start the fourth round in tied 8th place at 9-under par, 8 shots behind leader Bubba Watson. Woods struggled on the front 9 and shot 2-over par going out. He then began to noticeably limp on the next three holes and went on to withdraw from the tournament with an apparent left leg injury, which was later confirmed as a strain on his left Achilles tendon that had been injured previously at the 2011 Masters Tournament. After a short time off, Woods played in the Tavistock Cup at the Lake Nona Golf and Country Club, representing Team Albany, finishing 4th. The same week, Woods began the Arnold Palmer Invitational. After three rounds of 69, 65 and a 71, he began Sunday in the lead at 11-under par, one shot ahead of Graeme McDowell. Woods remained in the lead throughout the round and shot a 2-under par 70 to claim his seventh win at Bay Hill and also marked his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. After a week off, he returned to Augusta for the Masters Tournament. Over the four days, Woods was never close to contending the title, and shot rounds of 72-75-72-74 to finish tied 40th. After a 3-week break from competition, Woods traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, for the Wells Fargo Championship. Although starting positively with a 1-under par 71, Woods' second round of 73 (1-over) derailed his tournament hopes and resulted in him missing his eighth cut as a professional by 1 shot and second in as many years for the tournament. The following week, Woods played The Players Championship. After an opening round of 74 (2-over), he was in threat of missing a second consecutive cut, a first for his professional career, however after a 4-under 68, he was firmly staying in the tournament as well as being in the hunt for the weekend. However, a weekend charge never mounted despite good ball striking and he settled for T40th at 1-under par. In June, Woods won his 73rd PGA Tour event at the Memorial Tournament. He shot rounds of 70-69-73 to begin on Sunday at 4-under par. He birdied three of his last four holes to shoot 67 and win by two shots over Andrés Romero and Rory Sabbatini, including a chip-in at the par-3 16th. Jack Nicklaus, the tournament's host, said \\"I don't think under the circumstances I've ever seen a better shot\\". Fittingly, Woods' 73rd victory also tied Nicklaus' number of PGA Tour victories. In July 2012, Woods surpassed Nicklaus' total number of PGA Tour wins (73) after winning the AT&T; National in Maryland. 2013: World Number One again Woods began the year with a win in his first event in late January at the Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego. This was his eighth win as a professional at Torrey Pines (including the 2008 U.S. Open). He took a six- shot lead into the final round and hung on to win by four in a Monday finish caused by fog delays. Woods next won in early March at the WGC-Cadillac Championship event held at Doral. After shooting an opening round 66, Woods led or shared the lead in every round and won by two strokes over Steve Stricker with a 269 (−19) total. In his next event, Woods won for the eighth time at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, out-dueling Rickie Fowler in the final round. With this win, Woods reclaimed the number one spot in the Official World Golf Ranking for the first time since late in 2010, taking the spot away from Rory McIlroy. Woods remained number one throughout the remainder of the season. Though never seriously in contention, Woods finished tied for fourth at the Masters Tournament, won by Adam Scott in a sudden-death playoff over Ángel Cabrera. In his next event, Woods won The Players Championship for the second time. Tied with Woods going to the 71st hole, Sergio García hit two balls in the water surrounding the famous island green essentially handing Woods the tournament. Woods finished far down the leaderboard at the U.S. Open at Merion in June won by Justin Rose. At the Open Championship at Muirfield in July, Woods was in contention but a poor fourth round dropped him into a tie for sixth, five shots behind Phil Mickelson, who won his first Open Championship. In early August, Woods won the WGC- Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone for the eighth time. A second round 61 propelled Woods to a seven-shot victory, his fifth and final win of the season. Woods finished far down the leaderboard at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill where Jason Dufner won his first major. Despite hurting his back during The Barclays, Woods finished in second place, one shot behind Adam Scott. Woods did not seriously contend in the remaining FedEx Cup playoff events. In his final appearance of the season, Woods went 4–1 and led the U.S. team to a victory over the International team at the Presidents Cup held at Muirfield Village in Ohio. For the 2013 season, Woods won five PGA Tour tournaments giving him 79 for his career, only three behind Sam Snead's leading all-time total of 82. Woods won the tour's money title for the 10th time and the Vardon Trophy for lowest adjusted scoring average for the 9th time. Woods was named both PGA Player of the Year and PGA Tour Player of the Year for the 11th time.  2014–2017: Injury frustration   2013–14 Season  Woods made his first appearance on the 2013–14 PGA Tour at the Farmers Insurance Open. However, for the first time in his career, he missed the cut at the event. A poor showing at the Dubai Desert Classic would follow, before Woods withdrew through injury at the Honda Classic – casting doubt on his participation at the Masters. After being in visible pain throughout the WGC-Cadillac Championship, Woods was forced to withdraw from the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Subsequently, Woods announced that he would miss the Masters Tournament for the first time since 1994 to undergo a microdiscectomy. Woods returned ahead of schedule at the 2014 Quicken Loans National. However he struggled with every aspect of his game, missing the halfway cut. His next appearance came at the third major of the year – the Open Championship. This took place at Hoylake – location of his 2006 victory. Despite a strong start, Woods faded over the weekend to eventually finish 69th. Woods' back pain was clear to see at the 2014 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, where he withdrew from the tournament. Against all expectations, Woods made an unexpected appearance just one week later at the final major of the year, competing at the PGA Championship. Woods though would miss the cut. This would mark the end of the season for Woods. During the off-season, Woods split with swing coach Sean Foley.  2014–15 Season  The injury woes would continue into the 2015 season. Woods missed the cut at the 2015 Waste Management Phoenix Open, with his second round 82 the worst round of his professional career. Woods then withdrew once again from the Farmers Insurance Open, citing back pain. Woods opted to return at the 2015 Masters Tournament. Woods put in a strong showing, eventually finishing 17th. This was as good as it got for Woods in the 2015 season. For the first time in his career, he would miss back-to-back cuts at majors, failing to make the weekend at both the U.S. Open and Open Championship. Woods would once again miss the cut in the final major of the season – the PGA Championship. In a last-ditch bid to make the season-ending playoffs, Woods competed at the Wyndham Championship. Despite a strong showing, Woods placed 10th, missing out on the playoffs. In September, Woods underwent a second microdiscectomy.  2015–16 Season  Due to the effects of his surgery, Woods missed the 2016 Masters Tournament. Woods revealed he had no \\"timetable for his return\\". Woods didn't compete in any events during the 2015–16 PGA Tour season; it was the first time in his professional career that he missed all four major championships.  2016–17 Season  Woods finally returned to professional golf at the 2016 Hero World Challenge, placing 15th in the 18-man event. After 18 months out, Woods made his return to the PGA Tour at the 2017 Farmers Insurance Open. He missed the cut. The following week, Woods withdrew from the Omega Dubai Desert Classic after an opening round 77, citing back spasms. Woods had been expected to play several events in 2017 after making his return to the PGA Tour, but after withdrawing in Dubai, he announced that he was pulling out of two PGA Tour events in late February, and stated that he would evaluate his schedule after the Honda Classic. Despite Woods doing 'everything he could' to recover in time for the 2017 Masters, he announced he would not compete at the event. Woods underwent a fourth back surgery in April 2017, two weeks after the Masters and subsequently missed the rest of the season, the second time in his professional career that he did not compete in any of the four major championships. In the aftermath of the surgery, Woods stated he remained 'optimistic' of a return to professional golf. However at the 2017 Presidents Cup, where Woods was a vice-captain for Team USA, he admitted he might not ever play professional golf again. Yet in late October, Woods announced his intention to play at the 2017 Hero World Challenge. At this limited-field event, Woods entered the week ranked 1,199th in the Official World Golf Ranking, and Woods produced a positive performance, finishing tied for ninth.  2018: \\"The Comeback\\"  Woods stated that he would make his first appearance of the 2018 PGA Tour at the Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego, California, an event he had previously won seven times. Woods finished in a tie for 23rd, 7 strokes behind winner Jason Day. In February, Woods appeared in back-to-back PGA Tour events for the first time since August 2015. Woods missed the halfway cut at the Genesis Open in Los Angeles, before finishing 12th in at the Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Woods finished tied for second at the Valspar Championship on March 11 which was his best finish on Tour since The Northern Trust in August 2013. He then finished in a tie for 5th the next week at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Woods competed at the 2018 Masters Tournament, thus entering a major championship for the first time since 2015. He eventually finished tied for 32nd, which moved him up to 88th in the World Rankings meaning that he returned to the top 100 of the World Rankings for the first time since early 2015. Three weeks later, Woods appeared at the Wells Fargo Championship, where he finished tied for 55th. He then appeared at The Players Championship for the first time since 2015, where he finished tied for 11th. Woods completed his preparation for the U.S. Open by appearing at the Memorial Tournament, where he finished tied for 23rd. At the 2018 U.S. Open, Woods missed the cut by three strokes. Woods played next at the Quicken Loans National, where he finished tied for fourth. Woods impressed at the 2018 Open Championship. After a steady first two rounds, Woods rallied in the third round to get into contention for a first major championship victory since 2008. In the final round, Woods temporarily held the sole lead of the tournament, only to see his challenge ultimately fall short. Woods finished tied for sixth, his best finish in a major since 2013. Woods next teed it up at the 2018 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational - an event he had won eight times previously. After a positive start, Woods faded over the weekend, eventually finishing tied for 31st. At the 2018 PGA Championship, Woods started off on Thursday morning with a bogey-double bogey start, before grinding his way to an even par 70. During the second round that was played over both Friday and Saturday due to weather, Woods shot a strong 66 to make his first cut in the PGA Championship since 2013. Woods shot a 66 on Saturday to head into the final round 4 strokes back of Brooks Koepka. Not hitting a single fairway on his opening nine, Woods made the turn in 3 under par before ultimately shooting a 6-under 64, his best ever final round in a major championship. Capping it off with a 19 foot birdie putt on 18, Woods was greeted with large standing ovation from the St. Louis crowd as he walked the bridge over to the scoring trailer. He would ultimately finish in solo 2nd, two strokes back of Koepka, Woods' best finish in a major championship since the 2009 PGA Championship. Woods' impressive season secured his qualification for the 2018 FedEx Cup Playoffs. He appeared at the Northern Trust Open, where he finished tied for 40th. Woods played a week later at the Dell Technologies Championship, where he finished tied for 24th. Woods then recorded his seventh top-10 finish of the season at the BMW Championship, where he finished 6th. Woods qualified for the season-ending Tour Championship in 20th place for the FedEx Cup. At the Tour Championship, Woods produced a spectacular performance throughout the tournament, including 6 birdies in the front nine of the third round that propelled him to 12-under-par with a 3-shot lead entering the final round. Neither FedEx Cup leader Justin Rose nor playing partner Rory McIlroy were able to close the gap on Sunday, and towards the end of the tournament Woods was actually in contention to win the FedEx Cup outright when Rose dropped 3 shots on the back nine – however, Rose was able to hole a crucial birdie on the final hole to secure the FedEx Cup title. Still, Woods was joined by thousands of fans on his walk up to the 18th green after his second shot – the crowds were so overwhelming that Woods described himself as \\"holding back tears\\" during the walk. After a bunker shot and a two-putt for par, Woods ended a five-year victory drought with a win by two shots. This was Woods' 80th PGA Tour victory, leaving him just two short of Sam Snead's overall record. Woods rounded off 2018 by appearing in two unofficial events. First, he competed against Phil Mickelson in a head-to-head match play event, with a purse of $9 million. Following a tie through 18 holes, Mickelson eventually won in a playoff at the 22nd hole. Woods then hosted the Hero World Challenge, where he finished tied for 17th.  2019: Masters Glory  Woods made his first appearance of the 2019 PGA Tour season at the Farmers Insurance Open. At this event, Woods finished tied for 20th. His next appearance came at the Genesis Open, where Woods placed tied for 15th. Woods next played at the 2019 WGC-Mexico Championship, where he finished tied for 10th. Woods had planned on next appearing at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. However, a neck strain caused him to withdraw from the event, raising fears of further injury disruption to Woods' career. Woods allayed any such concerns by appearing the following week at the 2019 Players Championship. At this event, Woods finished tied for 30th. Woods then competed at the 2019 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play – the first time he had played at this event since 2013. Woods topped his group following victories over Aaron Wise and Patrick Cantlay, albeit losing to Brandt Snedeker. Woods therefore advanced to the last 16, where he defeated Rory McIlroy 2 & 1 in a highly-anticipated match. Woods was knocked out at the quarterfinal stage however, losing 1 down to Lucas Bjerregaard. Woods' next appearance came at the 2019 Masters Tournament – the first major championship of the 2019 season. Woods opened up the tournament with a round of 70, following this up with a 68 to enter the weekend one behind the leaders. Woods made a slow start to his third round, but rallied to a round of 67 to finish the day tied for second, two shots behind leader Francesco Molinari. Woods entered the final round in the last group, aiming for a first major championship since the 2008 U.S. Open. Molinari held on to his lead on the front nine, with Woods at one point falling three shots behind. However, Molinari encountered problems on the back nine. The tide swung in Woods' favor at the 12th hole, with Molinari putting his tee shot in the water and consequently double-bogeying the par-3, while Woods made a par. As Woods' group entered hole 15, Woods was one of five players tied for the lead. Woods birdied the hole to move one shot ahead, while Molinari found the water twice, making a double bogey, before Woods moved two ahead following another birdie at 16. After making par at 17, Woods bogeyed the final hole to complete a round of 70, thus claiming a one-shot victory. This was Woods' 5th Masters Tournament triumph, 15th major championship victory, and his first when trailing after three rounds. The victory put him three shy of Jack Nicklaus' overall record. Woods' victory was also his 81st PGA Tour win, and was lauded by many as the greatest sporting comeback of all time. After the Masters win, Woods rose into the top 10 of the Official World Golf Ranking at number 6. The following day, President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that he would present Woods with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, for his incredible comeback in sports and life, which was awarded to him on May 6, 2019. At the 2019 PGA Championship, which was moved from August to May effective in 2019, Woods shot a 5-over-par 72-73 over the first two rounds, missing the cut by one stroke. At the end of May, he shot 9-under-par to finish tied for 9th at the Memorial Tournament, a tournament he has won five times. In June, Woods shot 2-under-par 282 to finish tied for 21st at the U.S. Open, held at Pebble Beach. At the 2019 Open Championship, Woods shot a 6-over-par 78-70 over Thursday and Friday, missing the cut by five strokes. Woods' next tournament was at The Northern Trust, the first tournament of the FedEx Cup playoffs. Citing a mild oblique strain, he withdrew after shooting a 4-over-par 75 in the first round. At the BMW Championship the next week, he finished tied for 37th at 7-under-par, 18 strokes behind the winner, Justin Thomas. With that finish, Woods failed to qualify for the Tour Championship.  2019–2020: 82nd win  Coming off minor knee surgery in late August, Woods played his first event of the 2020 PGA Tour season in October 2019 at the inaugural Zozo Championship in Japan. With rounds of 64-64-66-68 he won by three strokes over Hideki Matsuyama. The win gave him 82 wins on the PGA Tour, moving Woods into a tie with Sam Snead for the most career wins on the Tour. His next event came at the Hero World Challenge. After struggling with some evident rust in round 1, he rebounded with 3 consecutive rounds in the 60s and finished solo fourth. He ended the calendar year by leading the U.S. team to a 16–14 win in the 2019 Presidents Cup. As a playing captain, Woods, won all three matches in which he competed. He concluded the 2019 calendar year in sixth place in the Official World Golf Ranking, his best year-ending result since 2013. Woods' first appearance in 2020 came at the Farmers Insurance Open – where he finished tied for 9th. Three weeks later, he competed at the Genesis Invitational, but a disappointing weekend performance contributed to a final position of tied 69th. Woods opted to skip the 2020 WGC-Mexico Championship, stating that he felt he 'wasn't going to be ready' for the event, having played at the Genesis Invitational the previous week. Woods unexpectedly skipped two more events in the following two weeks – the Honda Classic and the Arnold Palmer Invitational; the latter of which he attributed to 'back stiffness'. Having then opted to sit out the Players Championship, fears grew that Woods may be unable to defend his Masters title. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Players Championship was cancelled after one round and the PGA Tour entered a three-month hiatus, including the postponements or cancellation of all four major championships. Woods, after choosing not to play in the first five tournaments of the revamped schedule, rejoined the Tour at the Memorial Tournament, where he finished tied for 40th at six over par. In the first major of the year, Woods finished the PGA Championship at one under par, tied for 37th. Woods' next two tournaments were the first two rounds of the FedEx Cup playoffs. At The Northern Trust, he shot 68-71 (three under par) on Thursday and Friday, making the cut by one stroke. Over the weekend, he had rounds of 73 and 66 to finish tied for 58th at six under par. The following week at the BMW Championship, for the first time in ten years Woods shot four rounds over par in a single tournament to finish eleven over par, tied for 51st. Woods finished the season in 63rd place in the FedEx Cup standings. Cut streak Woods owns the PGA Tour record for consecutive cuts made at 142. The streak started in February 1998 at the Buick Invitational and ended at the Wachovia Championship in May 2005. Woods' tournament previous to the Buick Invitational was the AT&T; Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, from which he withdrew after its third and final round was postponed from February to August due to weather. The tournament that ended Woods' streak was the 2005 EDS Byron Nelson Championship, where he missed the cut by one stroke. He beat the previous record of 113, held by Byron Nelson, at The Tour Championship in November 2003. In both Nelson's and Woods's eras, \\"making the cut\\" has been defined as receiving a paycheck. However, in Nelson's day, only players who placed in the top 20 (sometimes as few as 15)Gettin' To The Dance Floor, by Al Barkow, 2000, Burford Books, Short Hills, New Jersey, , p. 76. in an event won a paycheck, whereas in Woods's day only players who reach a low enough score (top 70 and ties for most events) within the first 36 holes win a paycheck. Several golf analysts argue that Woods did not actually surpass Nelson's consecutive cuts mark, reasoning that 31 of the tournaments in which Woods competed were \\"no-cut\\" events, meaning all the players in the field were guaranteed to compete throughout the entire event regardless of their scores through 36 holes (and hence all \\"made the cut,\\" meaning that they all received a paycheck). These analysts argue that this would leave Woods's final consecutive cuts made at 111, and Nelson's at 113. However, at least ten of the tournaments in which Nelson played did not have modern-day cuts; that is, all of the players in these events were guaranteed to compete past 36 holes. The Masters, for example, did not institute a 36-hole cut until 1957 (which was well after Nelson retired), the PGA Championship was match play until 1958, and it is unclear whether or not three other events in which Nelson competed had 36-hole cuts. Therefore, these analysts remove \\"no 36-hole cut\\" events from both cut streak measures, leaving Nelson's consecutive cuts made at 103 (or possibly less) and Woods's at 111. In the tournaments in which Nelson competed that did not have 36-hole cuts (that is: the Masters, PGA Championship and the possible three other tournaments), only the top 20 players received a paycheck even though all players in these events were guaranteed to compete past 36 holes. Hence, in these no-cut events, Nelson still placed in the top 20, so Nelson's 113 cuts made are reflective of his 113 top 20 finishes. Woods achieved a top 20 finish 21 consecutive times (from July 2000 to July 2001) and, in the 31 no-cut events in which he played, he won 10 and finished out of the top 10 only five times. Others, including Woods himself, argue that the two streaks cannot be compared, because the variation of tournament structures in the two eras is too great for any meaningful comparison to be made. A more relevant comparison on cut streaks is the 105 consecutive cuts made by Jack Nicklaus between 1970 and 1976, ending at the 1976 World Open. The cut format from that era was virtually identical to the current PGA Tour practice, and most events in Nicklaus' streak, except for the Tournament of Champions (now the SBS Championship), the World Series of Golf (now the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational), and the U.S. Professional Match Play Championship (10 events for Nicklaus) had a cut made after 36 holes. Ryder Cup performance Despite his outstanding success on the PGA Tour, Woods had little success in the Ryder Cup early in his career. In his first Ryder Cup in 1997, he earned only 1½ points competing in every match and partnering mostly with Mark O'Meara. Costantino Rocca defeated Woods in his singles match. In 1999, he earned 2 points over every match with a variety of partners. In 2002, he lost both Friday matches, but, partnered with Davis Love III for both of Saturday's matches, won two points for the Americans, and was slated to anchor the Americans for the singles matches, both squads going into Sunday with 8 points. However, after the Europeans took an early lead, his match with Jesper Parnevik was rendered unimportant and they halved the match. In 2004, he was paired with Phil Mickelson on Friday but lost both matches, and only earned one point on Saturday. With the Americans facing a 5–11 deficit, he won the first singles match, but the team was not able to rally. In 2006, he was paired with Jim Furyk for all of the pairs matches, and they won two of their four matches. Woods won his singles match, one of only three Americans to do so that day. Woods missed the 2008 Ryder Cup competition altogether, as he was recovering from reconstructive surgery on his left knee. Despite Woods' absence, the United States team posted its largest margin of victory in the event since 1981. In 2010, Woods had a successful Ryder Cup going 3–1–0. He played all team matches with Steve Stricker and defeated Francesco Molinari 4&3 in his singles match where he made 9 birdies. However, Europe won in a very close match, 14.5 to 13.5. In 2012, paired again with Stricker, both players struggled going 0–3–0 together for the week. For the first time in his career, Woods would sit out a session in the Ryder Cup. Himself and Stricker were the only Americans who did not have a point going into the Sunday singles. In his singles match against Francesco Molinari, Woods was 1 up on the 18th fairway. After seeing Martin Kaymer clinch the Ryder Cup for Europe, Woods conceded the hole after missing his par putt. He would halve the match giving Europe the outright victory, and finish his week at 0–3–1. In 2018, Woods was initially named a vice-captain by Jim Furyk. Despite only playing half as many events as his peers, Woods still finished 11th in the final standings and was subsequently chosen as a captain's pick. Paired with Patrick Reed for the two four-ball sessions, they lost each time to Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who went 4–0 together for team Europe, with Molinari going 5–0 at the event. In his Saturday afternoon foursome match, he again lost to the European duo, paired this time with Bryson DeChambeau. Woods would also go on to lose his singles match to Jon Rahm 2&1 to mark the first time in his career that he lost every match he played in one Ryder Cup tournament. Europe would defeat United States by a score of 17.5 to 10.5. In the 8 Ryder Cups that Woods competed in from 1997 to 2018, he won 14.5 points from a possible 37.

However, it is later revealed that Phoebe has been shot while working late in the garage and the bullet travelled through the window and shot her. She is rushed to hospital the following day after being discovered by Mercedes, Darren and Patrick, and the McQueens are told that Phoebe may make a full recovery, or she may never wake up. After remaining in a coma for several weeks Lindsey tells the McQueens that Phoebe's organs are shutting down. John Paul McQueen (James Sutton) visits Robbie in prison and tells him about Phoebe. He asks him to talk into a phone so that he can play it for Phoebe in the hope hearing his voice may wake her up. After listening to the recording Phoebe becomes worse but Dr. Charles S'avage (Andrew Greenough) gives the McQueens a lifeline by telling them there is an operation Phoebe could have on her brain but the surgery may kill her. The McQueens eventually agree to the operation but Robbie arrives at the hospital, having got out of prison and on finding out about the operation barricades himself in Phoebe's room, refusing to let them operate on Phoebe. Joe and Freddie talk Robbie down and Phoebe goes for the surgery. Phoebe survives the surgery and becomes conscious and she talks to the McQueens. After they leave Robbie rushes into her room and Phoebe tells him Grace shot her. Robbie traps and attacks Grace in the garage ready to take revenge on her but Joe reveals that he shot Phoebe by accident. Robbie rushes back to the hospital and he asks Phoebe to marry him. Phoebe initially refuses but she eventually agrees and Robbie leaves to get cleaned up. Outside, Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis) wants to take a break and asks Kim to cover for her in performing vital checks on Phoebe. Shortly after, an unknown figure enters Phoebe's room. Assuming it is time for her medicine, Phoebe allows the culprit to pour a large dose of potassium chloride in her medical drip. The person leaves and Robbie finds Phoebe going into cardiac arrest and gets help, but the crash team fail to resuscitate her, and she is pronounced dead on the scene. Robbie is deeply upset and shocked no one was there to resuscitate her. An investigation was later launched into Phoebe's death and she was ruled to have died of natural causes, although Tegan was suspended when it emerged that she failed to conduct the right checks on Phoebe. Lindsey was later revealed to have killed Phoebe. Reception Anthony D. Langford of AfterElton.com bemoaned the dearth of realism when George assumed Phoebe was safe because he found her bracelet. Langford also felt that Hollyoaks wanted the human trafficking storyline to end quickly and said that the plot was more about George and Callum moving in together. Langford said that he was \\"totally horrified\\" when Phoebe lured George into Deena's trap for the sake of her dog. He added that George had good sense to be \\"appalled and disgusted\\" with her and hoped he would disown Phoebe.

Maitland is situated along a number of important transport networks connecting the Cape Town city bowl to the rest of the city. The most important being the railway line that runs through the middle of the suburb and the N1 that is situated on its northern boundary. The area has always been an important transport hub for the city. In 1845 one of the first roads from Stellenbosch through the Maitland area was completed. This effectively connected Cape Town to the rest of Africa as at the time the dunes of the Cape Flats prevented much traffic between the two locations. The suburb is named after Sir Peregrine Maitland who was governor of the Cape in the mid 1840s.

Bot. Explor. S. Afr. (1981): 143; He associated with the leading botanical lights of the day, including Rudolf Marloth,Rosenthal, Eric. \\"Southern African Dictionary of National Biography\\", pub: Frederick Warne, 1966 to whom he donated many specimens and many of the photographs that appeared in Marloth's monumental work, “The Flora of South Africa”.Marloth, Rudolf. “The Flora of South Africa” 1932 Pub. Cape Town: Darter Bros. London: Wheldon & Wesley. Some plant species were named after him. As a young man he fought in the Second Boer War. In World War I he was one of the first to die in the campaign in South-West Africa. Career Edward Dyke's father was a cashier in Cape Government Railways and in that respect Dyke followed in his father's footsteps; he was a railway employee most of his life. At first he was stationed at the Cape and later in the Transvaal. Possibly however, he merely used his salaried employment as means to more adventurous pursuits. Nearly all his spare time, he devoted to camping and mountaineering, and he had fought in the Second Boer War as a young man. Eventually, at the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted as a Trooper in the Imperial Light Horse Regiment. Botanical achievements In his spare time during his working life, he climbed the Cape Peninsula mountains, the Hottentots-Holland mountains, and nearby ranges, all of which are spectacular examples of Fynbos, including Peninsula Granite Fynbos, Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos and a number of related biomes. Later, when the railway administration moved to Johannesburg, he continued his explorations in various parts of the Drakensberg mountains, as well as on visits to Lesotho. On such excursions he collected avidly and sent specimens to Dr Rudolf Marloth. He extended his explorations to other regions as well; for example, while climbing the Cockscomb Mountains in the Winterberg range near Uitenhage he discovered a hitherto unrecognised species of Protea, later named Protea dykei Phill (now seen as a synonym of Protea rupicola). On Matroosberg in the Hex River Mountains, he discovered a new species of \\"everlasting\\", flowers that in those days were generally included in the genus Helichrysum. That species was described by Harry Bolus under the name Helichrysum dykei Bolus. The genus has since been split however, and the species has been assigned to another genus, as Syncarpha dykei (Bolus) B. Nord. Dyke's name also appears in the names of Erica dykei L. Bolus (= Erica thodei Gilg) and Lessertia dykei L. Bolus. Not content with discovering and documenting plant life, Dyke also grew an extensive collection of Karoo plants in his own garden. Death and contemporary assessment While on patrol in Walvis Bay he was mortally wounded and died shortly afterwards on 21 January 1915, aged 42, one of the first victims of the campaign in South West Africa. Dr Marloth, in his obituary for the Mountain Club Journal, mentions the last delivery he received from Dyke: 50 species of plants collected during a week of camping on Mont-Aux-Sources. Marloth considered Dyke's landscape and botanical photography among the best to date, and published many examples in his Flora of South Africa (1913-1915).

A cholera pit was a burial place used in a time of emergency when the disease was prevalent. Such mass graves were often unmarked and were placed in remote or specially selected locations. Public fears of contagion, lack of space within existing churchyards and restrictions placed on the movements of people from location to location also contributed to their establishment and use. Many of the victims were poor and lacked the funds for memorial stones, however memorials were sometimes added at a later date. Burials Often the bodies of cholera victims were wrapped in cotton or linen and doused in coal-tar or pitch before placing into a coffin. Each burial was in a pit 8 ft deep and liberally sprinkled with quicklime. The bodies were sometimes burnt before interment.Friar's Bush Retrieved : 2012-01-17 ;Long term risks It is considered that the cholera risk posed through disturbance of cholera pits from the 19th century is non-existent as transmission is through contaminated water or food. Cholera outbreaks An early 19th century incidence of asiatic cholera in Europe was recorded in Russia and other continental countries in the spring of 1831. The first occurrence in England was in the Autumn of 1831 when it reached Sunderland, by 1832 it was at Exeter, and it spread rapidly through the British Isles, reaching Kilmarnock in July 1832.McKay, Page 240 Other less severe outbreaks were recorded in 1849 and 1853.McKay, Page 242 In the USA Outbreaks of cholera took place in 1834, 1849, and 1861.Gehealogy Forum Retrieved : 2012-01-17 Traditions, legends, and history associated with cholera pits Detail of the site of the old cholera pit below South Barr farm, known locally as the 'Dead mans planting' The site of the cholera pit near Spier's Old School Grounds. At Barrmill in North Ayrshire the tradition is that the disease was passed on from a group of gipsies camped on Whin Hill that local boys had gone out to meet. Troops were regularly placed to prevent entry or exit during cholera outbreaks and normal burial in Beith was impossible and impractical, given the number of deaths. The burial site was fenced off and bordered by trees, kept in order by the Crawford Bros. from the factory until they died. It has been neglected since then.Porterfield, Page 35. In 1834 cholera broke out in Beith and although 'clothes were burned, bedding fumigated, stairs and closes whitewashed, a nurse who was a veteran of the Dalry outbreak was engaged and a ban placed on entertainments at funerals.' There were 100 cases in September 1834, 205 people were eventually affected with 105 deaths. Some of the people were buried in the parish churchyard, but others were buried in a field, close to what became Spier's School, on the little common south-west of where the Geilsland Road meets the Powgree Burn.Porterfield, Page 36. Robert Spier, the father of John Spier, was a member of the local Health Board.Cholera deaths in Beith The burial at Cleeves Cove is said to that of a member of the family who lived at Cleeves Farm. Tradition has it that \\"A prediction was uttered many long ages ago, that Cleaves , on three successive occasions, would be the first place in the parish visited by the pestilence. The cholera of 1832 was called the fulfillment of the second visitation : accordingly, many of the older inhabitants talk of one still being in reserve.\\" When attempting to create a burial pit in Little Bury Meadow near Exeter, the locals attacked the grave-digger when he arrived to break the ground. In Kilmarnock a patch of ground was purchased in Howard's Park \\"partly because the common-burying ground of the town was considered too small to meet the necessities of the case, and partly to prevent apprehended infection, as the graves in the new locality might remain in an undisturbed condition for a longer period.\\" The construction of the proposed rail link to Glasgow Airport involved disturbance of the Paisley cholera pit; however, the project was cancelled.

History Bought by the Louvre in 1867 from the collection of Marshal Soult, Duke of Dalmatia, this painting was perhaps part of the high altar of San José in the church of the Discalced Fathers of Mercy in Seville, together with a Saint Joseph Crowned by Christ and a God the Father now in the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville, and possibly a Saint Lucy in the Museum of Chartres, believed to be a companion piece to the Louvre painting - this last must be a studio work, however.L. Monagle and A. Sawkins, \\"Historical analysis of Zurbarán's Saint Apollonia\\", Journal of the History of Dentistry, (2008) Winter;56(3):131-2. The painting can be grouped with the pictures for the altar in the transept of the church of San José in Seville, dated 1636. It belongs to Zurbarán's most balanced period, when he produced his greatest masterpieces. Renaissance artists had clothed their saints in classical draperies. Adopting to a certain extent the attitude of the Middle Ages, certain 17th century painters, such as Georges de La Tour, Zurbarán, and Caravaggio dressed them in the contemporary fashion. The natural mediators between God and the faithful are thus seen in a kind of mystical familiarity.J. Gállego and J.

LEC offers secondary school (Gr. 10-12) options for teens and adults to continue and complete a secondary education or upgrade their courses. The courses are offered one of two ways: # Structured, semester and blended classes meeting once or twice a week in either the morning, afternoon or evening for two to three hour periods, providing flexibility for students as to when they attend. Registration happens at the beginning of each semester in August/September, and January/February. # On-site and Online Directed Learning classes (Langley Online and Distributed Learning) that allow continuous intake throughout the year and allows students to work at their own pace. Students can either attend their tutorial session once a week to work with their teacher, or complete courses online, working in a web-based environment.  History  Established in 1986, LEC was founded as an alternative secondary school located in commercial space at Sundel Square in the City of Langley, British Columbia (20216 Fraser Highway, Langley, BC). In November 2006, the Board of Education decided to move LEC from its original location to its new home on a shared campus with Langley Secondary School. The decision came as the Board of Education was facing budgetary constraints and underutilized facilities and LEC was facing increasingly inadequate and aging commercial space. The move was completed in February 2008 at a cost of $1.4 million. The new shared campus at Langley Secondary School provided LEC with a 900 square metre, state-of-the-art facility which includes eight classrooms: three shared with LSS, two located with the LEC office in the main building, and three in new modulars linked to the main building by covered walkways. In addition, a child minding facility on the premises.

Palma. The novel is written from the point of view of the narrator and follows three interwoven story lines. The book has been called \\"part mystery, part fantasy, and part historical fiction\\". The book is the first part of a \\"Trilogía Victoriana.\\" The second book, The Map of the Sky (featuring Wells's The War Of The Worlds), was released in late 2012. The third, The Map of Chaos, was released in Spanish on October 16, 2014, and in English translation on June 30, 2015.  Development  Palma said of the development that the story could not be written from a single point of view nor by a narrator who followed only one character. It required an omnipresent narrator who could tell all of the stories together. Plot The story follows three interwoven plots: 1\\\\. The story of Andrew Harrington, a man who fell desperately in love with \\"Marie Jeanette Kelly\\" (or \\"Mary Kelly\\"), one of the victims of Jack The Ripper. Harrington falls into a deep depression after discovering Kelly's body, and turns to alcohol and eventually opium to cope with the grief. He eventually decides to commit suicide, but is interrupted by his cousin Charles, who begs him to come with him to meet a man who claims he can travel in time. 2\\\\. The story of Claire Haggerty, a \\"New Woman\\" and feminist who is deeply unhappy with her life. She is supposed to choose a husband, but most of her suitors are only interested in her finances or in the continuation of their family line. Haggerty stumbles upon \\"Murray's Time Travel\\", and meets Captain Derek Shackleton, the man who leads the human race in the battle against the machines in the year 2000. 3\\\\. The final section of the story focuses on HG Wells himself, as he tries to discern if the fourth dimension is actually something that can be broken through, or if it is just a storytelling mechanism in stories (like the ones he writes). He discovers the \\"Map Of Time\\" in a house in London (that is reputedly haunted), he discovers that time is not a plaything - and his actions could have serious repercussions.  Reception  The Map of Time won the 2008 Ateneo de Sevilla XL Prize, and was mostly well-received. AVClub.com said the book is \\"packed with flowery language, and it features a playful narrator who's concerned with keeping the reader's attention as he bounces from character to character.\\" The Washington Post praised the book but remarked, \\"Fans of serious science fiction may find the story too metafictional. (Others may object that it’s clogged with too many adjectives.)\\" The Los Angeles Review of Books said that a passage in the book (during which H. G. Wells criticizes some writing) is similar to problems with Palma's writing, \\"inevitably produc[ing] boredom in the reader, or if not, then a profound aversion to what he is reading\\", but also stated, \\"Palma demonstrates a real skill at storytelling, especially character development and narrative suspense.\\"http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=794&fulltext;=1  References   External links   Official homepage for Felix J.

In the statement made by the government when setting up the commission, it referred to the West Lothian question, a term coined in 1977 to refer to anomalies existing in the pre-devolution government of the UK. The commission, chaired by Sir William McKay, considered changes to the procedures of the House of Commons in relation to legislation that only affects part of the UK. It started its work in February 2012 and reported in March 2013. It recommended that future legislation affecting England but not other parts of the UK should require the support of a majority of MPs sitting for English constituencies. BBC News, England-only laws 'need majority from English MPs' , 25 March 2013. Retrieved 25 March 2013 Background The term \\"West Lothian question\\" refers to issues concerning the former ability of members of parliament from constituencies in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to vote on matters that affect only people living in England and therefore have no direct consequence on their constituents, whilst being unable to influence matters that affect their own constituencies. Anomalies of this kind are considered to have been made more apparent by the devolution of power from Westminster to the National Assembly for Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Scottish Parliament. The Conservative Party manifesto for the 2010 general election included a commitment to introduce the idea of \\"English votes on English laws\\" and the party had previously explored this issue through a taskforce led by Kenneth Clarke. Scottish Conservative Sir Malcolm Rifkind has also written about the issue, proposing an English grand committee as a possible solution. The Liberal Democrat manifesto included a commitment to address the status of England as part of wider UK constitutional reforms. The 2010 coalition agreement between the parties included a commitment to establish a commission to examine the West Lothian question. Plans for a commission were announced in September 2011 and its membership was disclosed in January 2012. Membership The commission was set up with six members, described \\"independent, non-partisan\\" experts. The members were: Galligan *Sir William McKay, former Clerk of the House of Commons *Sir Geoffrey Bowman, former First Parliamentary Counsel (resigned 20 June 2012) *Sir Stephen Laws, retiring First Parliamentary Counsel *Sir Emyr Jones Parry, former UK Ambassador to the United Nations *Prof Charlie Jeffery of the University of Edinburgh Academy of Government *Prof Yvonne Galligan of Queen's University Belfast Terms of reference The terms of reference for the commission were: Publication of report The report of the commission was published on 25 March 2013. Its main conclusions are: The McKay Commission’s Report on the consequences of devolution for the House of Commons published – 25 March 2013. Retrieved 25 March 2013 *\\"Evidence suggests that people in England feel unhappy with present arrangements, which take too little account of their grievances. A response is necessary. *\\"Decisions taken in the Commons which have a separate and distinct effect for England (or England-and-Wales) should normally be taken only with the consent of a majority of MPs sitting for constituencies in England (or England-and-Wales). *\\"That principle should be clearly set out in a resolution of the House of Commons, and House procedure should be changed to encourage MPs to follow this approach. *\\"A range of procedural changes is suggested, all of which would allow the English voice to be heard. Some of them involve committees on bills, with majorities reflecting the party balance in England (or England-and-Wales). Others take the form of motions on the floor of the House. They are not a single package but a menu from which choices can be made to suit the circumstances of a particular bill. *\\"A select committee on Devolution should be appointed, which would (among other things) assist the House to hold UK ministers to account for their responsibilities in connection with devolution and their relations with the devolved administrations. *\\"Under the Commission's recommendations, no MPs would be prevented from voting on any bill, and the right of the House as a whole to make final decisions would be preserved. However, there would also be scope for additional roles for MPs from England (or England-and-Wales).\\" Sir William McKay said: > Our proposals retain the right of a UK-wide majority to make the final > decisions where they believe UK interests or those of a part of the UK other > than England should prevail.

They followed an ultimatum from the Soviet Union to allow Soviet troops to enter the country and operate freely. President Antanas Smetona left Lithuania on 15 June as the Red Army occupied the country and took control of the government. The elections were rigged so that only communists and communist-approved candidates could run. On 1 July the puppet People's Government led by Justas Paleckis announced elections to a new parliament, the People's Seimas, to be held on 14 July. The Communist Party of Lithuania emerged from underground with 1,500 members. Soon afterwards, the government announced the formation of the Union of the Working People of Lithuania, ostensibly a popular front. Voters were presented with a single list of candidates, including some non-communists. Just one candidate was presented for every seat in the new parliament and no other organizations were allowed to participate. On 11 and 12 July, the Soviet authorities stifled the opposition by arresting leading figures of the previous government and deporting some of them to the interior of the Soviet Union – even though Lithuania was still formally an independent state. The elections were later extended into 15 July. Each voter had his or her passport stamped after voting. According to the official results, voter turnout reached 95% and the Union list received over 99% of the votes. Most of the original election records were destroyed. The remaining data shows that turnout was indeed high, but that many ballots were invalid (missing, destroyed, left blank, or marked with anti-Soviet slogans). The results were announced even before the polls closed. The new parliament was convened on 21 July and voted unanimously to established the Lithuanian SSR and request to join the Soviet Union. The country became the Soviet Union's fourteenth member on 3 August.

It provides disaster relief to large scale catastrophes around the world and also carries out humanitarian capacity building programs in post-conflict nations. Time magazine recognized the work of GlobalMedic in its 2010 Time 100 issue. Rahul Singh, a Toronto paramedic, founded the David McAntony Gibson Foundation in 1998 in honour of a best friend who lost his life the same year. GlobalMedic has a roster of over 1,000 volunteers from across Canada that includes many professional rescuers, police officers, firefighters and paramedics who donate their time to respond overseas. The volunteers compose the Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) that operate rescue units designed to save disaster victims, Water Purification Units (WPUs) designed to provide clean drinking water; and Emergency Medical Units (EMUs) that use inflatable field hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment. Since 2004, GlobalMedic teams have deployed to over 60 humanitarian disasters around the world.  Origins and volunteer training  GlobalMedic trainees being instructed on procedures inside an inflatable field hospital tent during one of its cross- Canada training sessions, June 2011. Rahul Singh, a Toronto paramedic, created GlobalMedic in 1998 after seeing ineffective and wasteful relief efforts deployed in Nepal. Singh was touring the country when disastrous monsoon downpours triggered numerous mudslides, resulting in the destruction of several villages. Mr. Singh later noted in an interview that \\"There were inefficient relief efforts. I decided to do something to ensure efficient and immediate relief to disaster-struck people. After returning [to Canada], I founded GlobalMedic\\". GlobalMedic later established annual Rapid Response training days near its Toronto headquarters and at several other locations across Canada. Recruiting is concentrated, but not restricted, to members of paramedic services, police forces and others in professional rescue service communities. Rapid Response training days typically involves groups of trainees receiving several lectures and demonstrations, and typically involves 'hands on' experience with the various inflatable hospital tents and water purification systems that are employed in the field. The large inflatable tent structures can be deployed in minutes after arriving in a disaster zone, allowing its medics to concentrate on providing immediate triage and emergency medical care. By June 2011, some 120 people attended GlobalMedic's annual training day near its Toronto headquarters, with attendance growing to approximately 150 trainees in 2013. Several other recruiting and training sessions were also being held cross-Canada annually.  Deployments  Trainees practice assembling and operating a Nomad water purification system (blue unit), capable of producing 100 litres of purified drinking water per minute being fed into in a canvas reservoir at left. GlobalMedic volunteers make up the Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) that operate a Rescue Unit designed to save disaster victims; a Water Purification Unit (WPU) designed to provide clean drinking water; and an Emergency Medical Unit (EMU) that uses inflatable field hospitals to restore medical infrastructure. Since 2004, GlobalMedic teams have deployed to over 60 humanitarian disasters around the world. Responses have included hurricanes in Grenada and Guatemala; earthquakes in Pakistan, Indonesia, Peru, Haiti and Japan; tsunamis in Sri Lanka, the Solomon Islands and Japan; typhoons in the Philippines; floods in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mexico, Sudan, Somalia and India; and complex humanitarian emergencies in Gaza, Libya and Somalia. The deployment of its medical volunteers and its field hospitals and clinics are capable of treating hundreds of patients per day, The organization additionally identified that it can make an even greater post-disaster impact by preventing waterborne diseases from causing secondary disasters such as typhoid and dysentery epidemics. Such epidemics can occur after earthquakes that damage municipal or regional water treatment facilities and even, counter-intuitively, following severe hurricanes, typhoons or monsoons that flood large land areas with turbid, contaminated water. The organization and its volunteers work to help prevent secondary epidemics by having its WPUs both distribute decontamination tablets and by setting up portable water purification equipment which can render even completely contaminated water sources safe for humans. This is achieved by various methods, including filtration media, flocculation, chemical disinfection and the application of ultraviolet light (UV light), which breaks down the genetic code of almost all microorganisms. After arriving in a crisis area, motorcycles are sometimes employed to transport and set up small suitcase-sized Noah Trekker water purification units, due to their ability to circumnavigate damaged roadways and other rough terrain in order to reach outlying regions in need of aid. In areas without electrical power, the small purification units will operate off of a motorcycle's 12 volt battery with its engine running, able to purify about 200 litres of water per hour. Some of GlobalMedic's notable deployments include:  Typhoon Haiyan Philippines catastrophe, 2013  In the wake of Typhoon Haiyan which generated Category 5 winds that exceeded all previously recorded values, as well as a storm surge of more than 6 metres (20 feet) height that built up in 'mere minutes', large areas of the Philippines were heavily damaged. More than 5,000 dead, 1,600 people missing, and 23,000 injuries were initially reported in the first two weeks. Two months after the storm would see the confirmed death toll easily exceeding 6,000 with some 4 million people made homeless. GlobalMedic had its first four-man team airborne to the Philippines a day after the disaster, soon establishing a headquarters and three teams based in key areas of the disaster zone, operating out of Iloilo, Cebu, and the worst hit location, Tacloban. Within 10 days over 20 rescuers and disaster responders were providing medical assistance and, of equal importance, safe drinking water using a Rainfresh AquaResponse10 water purification system and over 10 separate Trekker purification units. A larger Nomad water unit was also shipped to Tacloban, capable of purifying 100 liters of water per minute. Over 1.4 million water purification tablets were also shipped to the region as well from the organization's Toronto headquarters. Using connections established on five previous humanitarian relief missions in the Philippines, GlobalMedic had its water purification equipment flown to Tacloban and Ormoc on a private C-130 Hercules a day after their arrival. Teams also initiated a Quick Intervention Project to deliver bags of rice and boxes of food obtained from within the Philippines, alongside of a water tankering program using tank trucks to speed the delivery of safe water to surrounding communities. Employing two tank trunks, its volunteers attempted to deliver clean water to some 50 communities surrounding Tacloban, but could only service three to four of them a day due to the demand at each location. GlobalMedic also ordered an additional inflatable field hospital from Dynamic Air Shelters of Grand Bank, Newfoundland and Labrador for immediate shipment to replace a damaged district hospital in Sara on Panay Island. The by hospital tent structure was funded in part by the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador which contributed $151,000 for the unit. Critical medications, emergency shelters, tents and other supplies and assistance for the Philippines were also being received from partner charities and agencies, including Health Partners International of Canada, the Compassionate Service Society (CSS Charity) and the Léger Foundation in Quebec. Included among the volunteer responders was Pipito Biclar, a Filipino doctor born in the region and who was serving as a Toronto EMS paramedic after arriving in Canada. The reports emanating from the disaster zone prompted Rahul Singh to comment \\"[the] situation on the ground is dire. We are in a race against time to stave off disease and keep people alive. If we fail to deliver, the suffering will be unimaginable.\\" The deployment became based at a temporary facility in Cebu, headed by Matt Capobianco, GlobalMedic's Manager of Emergency Programs. The Philippines response was joined by other GlobalMedic team members on assignment in India at the time the disaster occurred, and who then were quickly transferred to Tacloban. Among them was David Sakaki, a firefighter from Kamloops, British Columbia, who later returned to Canada and reported he was amazed that anyone had survived within the zone of destruction, which he had observed was spread out over great distances from the Filipino city. \\"The airport is gone. ... There’s no power... [the city] is just in ruins. There isn’t a building that’s untouched. It doesn’t matter how far out of Tacloban one drives, the degree of destruction is the same.\\" Sakaki believed the number of fatalities would greatly exceed a projected estimate of 6,000 deaths. By the end of November 2013, GlobalMedic had treated some 1,200 patients in their field hospitals. By the second half of January 2014 its staff and assistants had distributed more than five million water purification pills and also purified over 2.4 million litres of contaminated water—making it both safe to drink and palatable—with their dozen Noah Trekkers, a Nomad purification unit, as well as some 3,000 smaller household purification units produced by volunteers in Toronto and Montreal that month. Its medical staff were treating patients at a rate of 'hundreds per day' in its clinics, while other volunteers were helping to rebuild damaged medical facilities so they could resume their own operations. Fresh teams of medics and volunteers were being rotated into the disaster zone ever few weeks.  Horn of Africa drought, 2011–2012  Some of the approximate 2,000 Rainfresh Water Filtration units in kit form produced by GlobalMedic volunteers during the Fall of 2011, for emergency shipment to drought areas in Kenya and Somalia. Between July 2011 and mid-2012, a severe drought affected the entire East Africa region, often referred to as the Horn of Africa drought. Said to be the worst in 60 years, the East Africa drought caused a severe water and food crisis across Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Kenya, threatening the lives and livelihoods of over nine million people. GlobalMedic responded by freighting over 2.8 million Aquatab purification pills and PUR water cleansing sachets to Kenya and Somalia. The volunteer organization additionally produced over two thousand water filtration devices using large plastic food pails, converted by dozens of its volunteers in the borrowed warehouse space of a Mississauga, Ontario air freight company. The filtration kits were then matched with commercial Envirogard ceramic water filter cartridges. Matt Capobianco demonstrating a small, four filter gravity- fed water purification unit, Toronto, June 2011 The components for two thousand filtration units were then marshaled together and shipped by intermodal containers to the drought region, with each kit able to provide the clean water needs of a large family. A GlobalMedic WPU team travelled to Africa and worked with local aid agencies, including the Compassionate Service Society, ADRA Kenya, ADRA Somalia, MATE and FCC Kenya, to distribute its purification supplies and filtration kits. The materials distributed by GlobalMedic's WPU team resulted in the provision of tens of millions litres of safe drinking water to the affected populations in three countries. Ten Emergency Medical Kits (EMKs) for the treatment of some 6,000 patients were also supplied to aid internally displaced refugees in Benadir and Mogadishu in Somalia.  Haiti earthquake catastrophe, 2010  GlobalMedic was one of the international relief organizations to respond to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. The organization worked with local partners to quickly provide emergency medical assistance and clean drinking water to people in the Carrefour district of Port-au-Prince. An initial Rapid Response Team, composed of paramedics, a doctor and an engineer traveled into the city with an inflatable field hospital tent structure, an Explorer and several Trekker water purification units, plus millions of water purification tablets. The advance team arrived two days after the earthquake even though the country's airports were rendered unusable to any movements except military flights. They journeyed there by flying to the neighbouring Dominican Republic, and then taking an arduous 18-plus hours land route over chaotic roads in several rented trucks and a small bus. Among the advance group were Rahul Singh and Dr. Michael Howatt, who assisted throughout the night with surgeries at the Université Adventiste d'Haïti (Adventist University of Haiti) in the capital city starting shortly after his arrival there. A large capacity Explorer water purification unit was also set up within 12 hours of the group's arrival, drawing water from a ruptured swimming pool being filled with river-fed ground water. Within a month of their first arrival GlobalMedic had distributed millions of Aquatab purification tablets, set up two inflatable field hospitals that were treating 300 patients a day, brought in satellite phones and radios, and set up some 64 water purification units including 62 portable Noah Trekkers dispatched daily by a team of 15 to 20 hired motorcyclists. Motorcycles were used extensively due to their ability to circumnavigate damaged roadways and rough terrain in order to reach outlying areas in need of aid. The Canadian organization ultimately treated over 7,000 patients, distributed over 10 million litres of clean drinking water, five million water purification tablets, and deployed 20 Canadian volunteer rescuers at a time in response to the Haiti earthquake.  Burmese cyclone and Sichuan, China earthquake, 2008  In May 2008 Cyclone Nargis sent a storm surge 40 kilometers up Myanmar's densely populated Irrawaddy river delta, causing catastrophic destruction and at least 138,000 fatalities. It was the worst natural disaster in the country's history, with allegations that government officials stopped updating the death toll after 138,000 to minimize political fallout. Relief efforts were slowed for political reasons as Myanmar's military rulers initially resisted large-scale international aid. Hampering the relief efforts, only ten days after the cyclone, nearby central China was hit by a massive earthquake, known as the Sichuan earthquake. The powerful earthquake in Sichuan Province in May 2008 measured 8.0 Mw (surface wave magnitude), killing more than 69,000 people and leaving some 4.8 million people homeless, though the number may have been as high as 11 million. It was the strongest earthquake in China since 1950, and the 21st deadliest earthquake of all time when it occurred. Shortly after the Burmese cyclone, GlobalMedic's disaster relief staff were staged in neighbouring Thailand after being refused permission by the Burmese military government to enter the country to distribute aid and water purification supplies. After frustrating delays land routes were established from a town on the Thai border in order to transport aid to the disaster areas using Burmese partners. A portion of GlobalMedic's team was then unexpectedly diverted from Thailand into China's disaster zone, less than 48 hours after the massive Sichuan earthquake. In Sichuan Province where more than 10 million people were affected, the quake damaged over 1,200 water treatment plants and more than 800 water storage tanks, as well as some 5,000 kilometres of buried water pipes. The earthquake and its aftershocks severely compromised the supply of safe drinking water. Operating from the provincial capital of Chengdu, GlobalMedic's team helped set up and operate some 140 Noah Trekker suitcase-sized purification units in the area, each capable of supplying safe drinking water for about 1,000 people. They also brought in a much larger Nomad purification unit with a flow rate of 100 litres per minute, capable of serving some 70,000 people. Its volunteer staff further coordinated the distribution of almost 22 million Aquatab water purification tablets, each capable of disinfecting a litre of contaminated water. After being asked by the Chinese Government to provide disaster assistance, GlobalMedic worked with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) on its aid delivery and coordinated directly with the Sichuan Water and Farmland Bureau. It then helped the staff of local water distribution utilities set up and maintain the purification equipment shipped to China, and to also distribute its water purification tablets. GlobalMedic's efforts in China were lauded by Jim Karygiannis, M.P., a Canadian Member of Parliament, who joined in helping to load emergency supplies for shipment from the organization's Toronto headquarters, saying:  Acknowledgements and honours  For his work with GlobalMedic, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper presented Rahul Singh with the ICCC’s \\"Humanitarian of the Year Award\\" in 2006. Singh also became a recipient of \\"Canada’s Top 40 Under 40 Award\\" in 2009, and was named to the 2010 Time 100 list of \\"The World's Most Influential People\\". The Globe and Mail included him on the list of \\"Canadians changing the world\\", and he was chosen by the Toronto Star as one of 12 \\"Canadians changing the way we think.\\" In 2012, Singh was made a member of the Order of Ontario. Following Singh being portrayed as among the world's 100 most influential people in 2010, he and GlobalMedic have been called \\"the face of Canadian relief efforts around the world\\".

Earlier functions include Minister of Public Health and Interior Minister. Sanoh played a supporting role in the rise to premiership of Banharn Silpa-archa, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, Thaksin Shinawatra and Surayud Chulanont Education and family Sanoh was born into a Thai Chinese business family involved in the lumber industry.New Wine in an Old Bottle: Female Politicians, Family Rule, and Democratization in Thailand He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree from the Sripatum University. He is married with Uraiwan Thienthong, who is also a politician. They have six children together. Among them are Sorawong Thienthong, who is an MP for Sa Kaeo and Surachat Thienthong, who is an MP for Bangkok, after having been product manager for Thai Beverage, the producer of Beer Chang. Sanoh's nephew and niece, Thanit and Trinuch Thienthong, are both MPs for Sa Kaeo. Moreover, Thanit serves as a Deputy Interior Minister in Yingluck Shinawatra's cabinet. Sanoh's brother Witthaya was a long-term MP for Sa Kaeo as well (since 1996, all three Sa Kaeo seats in the House of Representatives have been controlled by members of the Thienthong family), while his sister Kwanruan was a member of the Senate in 2006. Political career Sanoh has an influential trucking business, his home district being located near an important checkpoint at the Thai-Cambodian border. Sanoh entered politics with the Thai Nation Party in 1975. One year later, he was elected to parliament representing Prachinburi Province which at the time still contained today's Sa Kaeo Province. From 1986 to 1988, he was Deputy Minister of Agriculture and, for a short phase of less than two months in 1992, Deputy Minister of Transport. When Banharn Silpa-archa became leader of the Thai Nation Party in 1994, he made Sanoh secretary-general. The following year, Banharn became Prime Minister and called up Sanoh to the government, appointing him Minister of Public Health. In 1996, Sanoh resigned from the Thai Nation Party and joined the New Aspiration Party of Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, and immediately took up the position of secretary-general. After Chavalit had won the election and become Prime Minister, he made Sanoh Minister of the Interior. As a minister, Sanoh Thienthong is said to have coined the term Ya ba (\\"madness drug\\") instead of \\"Ya ma\\" (\\"horse drug\\") for the mix of methamphetamine and caffeine which used to be prevalent in Thailand. For the election in 2001, he changed to the Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT) of Thaksin Shinawatra. Sanoh was made chief adviser of the party. He was not given a government office, but his wife Uraiwan was appointed minister. Alternately, she led the Ministries of Culture and Labour. Inside the Thai Rak Thai Party, Sanoh led a faction called the \\"Wang Nam Yen group\\", named after Sanoh's home district. In 2004, around 70 MPs, mainly from the Northeastern region were affiliated with this group. After discord with Thaksin, Sanoh Thienthong left TRT on 25 February 2006. After Thaksin had dissolved the parliament, Sanoh spoke at several rallies of the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD, or \\"Yellow Shirts\\"), an anti-Thaksin pressure group. He formed a new party, called Pracharaj Party (Royalist People's Party). Sanoh became leader of the party which declared political reform and the removal of the Thaksin regime as its aims. On 13 May 2011, he abandoned his Pracharaj Party to join the Pheu Thai Party. He supported the top candidature of Yingluck Shinawatra and on 5 August, it was Sanoh who proposed her election as Prime Minister to the parliament.

He also wrote on the history of Ohio, the culture of North Carolina, and the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, of which he was a survivor. Early career illustration from The Heart of the Alleghanies depicting \\"Campbell's lowly cabin in the center of the narrow corn-fields\\" beside the \\"limpid\\" Nantahala River Zeigler was born near Fremont, Ohio in 1857. His father, Henry Zeigler, was of German ancestry. His mother, Elizabeth Gorham (née Gleason), was a descendant of Thomas Fitch. Zeigler studied law in Cleveland, Ohio, and in 1881 was admitted to the bar. He joined in a partnership with R. P. Buckland and H. S. Buckland, but after a year left to develop an interest in literature.The Bay of San Francisco, Vol. 2, Pages 375-376, Lewis Publishing Co, 1892 Zeigler contributed historical material to the History of Sandusky County Ohio (1882). He also travelled through North Carolina with fellow lawyer Ben S. Grosscup to research their jointly written book The Heart of the Alleghanies; or, Western North Carolina. It was published in 1883. According to journalist George Ellison, the book is a \\"neglected classic\\", > The co-authors wrote in a lively fashion about the Cherokees and their lore, > the native mountaineers and their lore, bear hunting and trout fishing, > famous hunters and renowned fishermen, farming and livestock, mountain > scenery and customs, the coming of tourism, mining, the distinctive > characteristics of Asheville and other mountain communities, and much more. > It would be difficult to think of a topic they didn’t touch upon, often in > passing but not infrequently in depth. The book is a neglected classic of > Southern Appalachian literature.George Ellison, Back Then, Smoky Mountain > News, 04/09/2008. In 1883, Zeigler settled in San Francisco, and returned to legal work, concentrating on civil law. Eventually he formed the partnership Galpin & Zeigler. Marlovian theory Zeigler returned to literature with his novel It was Marlowe: a Story of the Secret of Three Centuries, (1895). In the preface to the book Zeigler commented on the then-popular Baconian theory that Francis Bacon was the true author Shakespeare's works. He argued that the two authors were very different, and put forward his alternative suggestion that Christopher Marlowe, who is recorded to have been killed in a fight in 1593, faked his death.Samuel Schoenbaum, Shakespeare's Lives (2nd ed.), Oxford University Press, 1991, p.446. He pointed out that accounts of the death were very inconsistent and that no evidence had ever been found concerning his mysterious killer. He noted similarities between Marlowe's and Shakespeare's styles and the fact that the latter's career began almost simultaneously with the end of Marlowe's in 1593. Zeigler dealt with the anticipated objection that, unlike Shakespeare, there is little humour in Marlowe's work, by referring to the comic scenes in Doctor Faustus. He also noted that Shakespeare's own name first appears on plays in 1598 with the publication of Love's Labour's Lost and that John Aubrey later wrote that Ben Jonson \\"killed Mr. Marlow, ye poet, on Bunhill, coming from the Green Curtain play house\\" in the same year. Zeigler suggests that the two events are linked and that Marlowe survived until 1598 when Jonson may have killed him. In the novel, Zeigler creates a fictional narrative about how the deception may have occurred and why there appear to be two reported dates for Marlowe's death. He also puts arguments about similarities between Marlowe's work and Shakespeare's into the mouths of Ben Jonson and Thomas Nashe. In footnotes and an appendix Zeigler expands on connections between Marlowe's and Shakespeare's work and suggests that Jonson was behind the 1623 First Folio, in which he thinks he had a financial interest. Plot of It Was Marlowe Marlowe kills Frazer, while Anne turns away in horror. Illustration from the novel Marlowe meets a man who tells him an old girlfriend of Marlowe's called Anne is now unhappily married to a violent man called Francis Frazer. Still in love with her, Marlowe tries to visit Anne in secret, but he and Frazer get into a fight in which the latter is killed. Because the two resemble one another there is initial confusion about who has been killed. Marlowe exchanges clothes with Frazer. Helped by a clever lawyer and his friends William Shakespeare and George Peele Marlowe escapes. At the inquest his friends identify the body as Marlowe's. Meanwhile, Richard Bame, a puritanical Brownist, has accused Marlowe of atheism. Convinced that Marlowe is still alive, he pursues him. The two meet in a church, where Marlowe explains that his 'atheism' is really a belief in a spiritual ideal that transcends church dogma. After a fire is accidentally started in the church when thieves arrive, Bame is arrested as one of the thieves. Marlowe escapes and goes into hiding. Bame's lawyer attempts to track down Marlowe, resulting in another fire in which Marlowe's own lawyer dies. Bame is eventually hanged for theft. After Marlowe writes Titus Andronicus, Shakespeare and Peele pass it off as their own work. The new plays are published anonymously with no problem. Marlowe eventually returns in 1598 in disguise to the Curtain Theatre for a performance of Hamlet. In the audience Ben Jonson and Thomas Nashe express the suspicion that the work is very like Marlowe's, discussing the details of the parallels. Anne in the crowd looks up and recognises her beloved; at the same time Jonson and Nashe see him. Context Zeigler was writing before Leslie Hotson discovered the records of the inquest into the death of Marlowe, identifying his killer as Ingram Frizer. The name \\"Francis Frazer\\" derives from a document in the parish book of Deptford, which states that Marlowe was buried there after he was \\"slain by Francis Frezer\\". Hotson discovered the records in 1924, and published his findings a year later.Saxon, Wolfgang (November 20, 1992). Retrieved 2008-05-07 Obituary, \\"Dr. John Hotson, 95, Unraveler Of Elizabethan Literary Puzzles\\". New York Times. Jonson did indeed kill a man in 1598, but it was an actor called Gabriel Spenser. It is usually assumed that Aubrey mixed up the two killings.Harry Guest, The Artist on the Artist, Intellect Books, 2000, p. 95. Gabriel Spenser is briefly mentioned in the novel at the very beginning, as an actor who played the title role in Marlowe's play Edward II. His performance is mentioned again at the end in the dialogue between Jonson and Nashe, but it is never implied that Marlowe has adopted his identity in 1598. Richard Bame is based on Richard Baines, the informer who denounced Marlowe. The claim that he was executed for a crime he may not have committed is derived from surviving evidence concerning the execution of a man of that name. Zeigler's ideas were picked up by Archie Webster in 1923, who was also writing before Hotson's discovery. The Marlovian theory was later expounded in detail in the light of the known facts by Calvin Hoffman in 1955. San Francisco earthquake After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Zeigler wrote The Story of the Earthquake and Fire: San Francisco (1906), a first-hand account of the disaster. Zeigler expresses the view that the city will re- emerge in better shape after the disaster, because new public spaces can now be planned and created. The book was republished in 2010. It contains a large number of photographs of San Francisco after the earthquake and some before- and-after comparison images. Notes External links It was Marlowe.

Career In 1902-03 he conducted geological studies of northern Madagascar that included Diego Suarez. In 1904 he performed geological/exploratory investigations in Morocco. From 1908 to 1919 he was head of the Géologie au Laboratoire Colonial in Paris. During this time period he also taught classes in geology at the Ecole spéciale d'Architecture (1909-1920). Following the retirement of Stanislas-Étienne Meunier (1843-1925), he was appointed chair of geology at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle (1920). From 1932 to 1936 he was director of the museum. Annales, Paul LEMOINE (1878-1940). In 1916 in collaboration with other scientists, he created the Société de Documentation Paléontologique, which later became known as the Syndicat de Documentation Géologique et Paléontologique.

Evolution Lemoine has been cited in creationist literature as being anti-evolution. A quote often attributed to him from the Encyclopédie française (Volume 5, 1937) is: > \\"It results from this explanation that the theory of evolution is not exact > ... Evolution is a kind of dogma which its own priests no longer believe, > but which they uphold for the people. It is necessary to have the courage to > state this if only so that men of a future generation may orient their > research into a different direction.\\"\\"Old, Out of Context Quotations from > French Scientists\\".

They have won the Kenyan Premier League a record 18 times, Five more than their arch-rivals A.F.C. Leopards, and have also won the FKF President's Cup a record 10 times. They are the only team from Kenya and the CECAFA region to win an African continental title to date, having won the African Cup Winners' Cup in 1987 after previously reaching the final in 1979. The club was formally established on 17 February 1968 as a merger of Luo Union and Luo Sports Club (also known as Luo Stars) and won the national league at the first time of asking. Some of its original leaders were politicians Tom Mboya and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. However the club was founded much earlier, in the 1915, and participated intermittently in local tournaments in Western Kenya. Various groups used this name at different times. The club plays its home games at the Nairobi City Stadium. Alternatively they also play their home games at the Moi International Sports Centre and the Nyayo National Stadium. It has been proposed that the club hosts some of its home matches at its alternate stadiums in its earlier days, the renovated Kisumu County Stadium and the Mombasa Municipal Stadium. The club won the Kenya National Football league in 1968, having been formally founded only in February of the same year. In 1976, Gor Mahia won the national league unbeaten, and repeated the same feat 39 years later under the leadership of Frank Nuttall. Towards the end of the 2000s, Gor started bouncing back to fame steadily bringing Kenyan football fans back to the pitch and regularly filling sold-out stadiums. The club returned to silverware in 2008 when it won the KFF Cup after a thirteen-year drought of any major trophies. Gor proceeded to win the Kenya DSTV Super Cup against the year's defending champs, Mathare United before the beginning of the 2009 KPL season. On 26 October 2011 Gor Mahia in typically dominant fashion trounced Sofapaka to win the 2011 edition of the FKL Cup having dispatched their archrivals AFC Leopards 6 days earlier in a 20 October Heroes Day thriller. History Formation Gor Mahia Football Club was formally established on 17 February 1968 after the merging of Luo Union and Luo Sports Club. The club was named after a legendary medicineman from Kanyamwa, Ndhiwa, Homa Bay in Luo mythology, whose nickname was Gor Mahia (\\"mahia\\" is Luo for \\"magic\\") because he was famous for performing magic. The club's most famous nickname, K'Ogalo, also stems from the medicineman, whose full name was Gor Wuod Ogada nyakwar Ogalo (Gor son of Ogada grandson of Ogalo), and as such was known as Gor Makogalo, or Gor K'Ogalo in short, which means \\"Gor of Ogalo's homestead\\".About Gor Mahia – GorMahia.net. Retrieved 9 May 2014. Several prominent Luos from all walks of life met in Nairobi to christen the club. The name Gor Mahia was settled upon from a shortlist of other Luo cultural heroes and warriors such as: Nyathi Kwach; Lwanda Magere from Kano; Okore wuod Ogonda Mumbo from Kisumu; Oguttu wuod Kipapi from Ugenya; Kech Kamajwala from Asembo and Tao K'Ogot also from Ugenya. 1970s Gor Mahia won the league title in their inaugural season in 1968 with legendary Kenya striker William Ouma \\"Chege\\" scoring 19 goals. They would win the league title for the second time in 1974. In 1976, Gor Mahia became the first Kenyan football club to win the National League unbeaten thanks to the exploits of playmaker Allan Thigo who also acted as coach. He was ably assisted by stars such as Festus Nyakota, James Ogolla and new recruits Jerry Imbo who had been recruited from Black Mamba and legendary goalpoacher Maurice Ochieng who had been recruited from Kenya Police. Goalkeeper George Ayuka was in sensational form throughout the season. Maurice Ochieng finished as leading scorer in the league with 18 goals, ahead of the legendary William \\"Chege\\" Ouma who scored 16. The 1976 is one of the strongest the club had ever fielded. It included such stars as Masanta Osoro, Paul \\"Cobra\\" Oduwa, Festus Nyakota, Duncan Aluko and Duncan Migan, all of whom played for the national team at one point. Current Roads Minister in the Kenyan Cabinet Chris Obure also played for Gor in their inaugural season in 1968 and 1969. In the 1979 African Cup Winners' Cup final, Gor Mahia faced Canon Yaounde of Cameroun, the defending champions. Over confidence played a part in Gor Mahia losing the 1st leg 0–2. Lack of experience took its toll as Gor Mahia inexplicably lost the second league 0–6. There were unconfirmed rumours that some players had been bribed. 1980s Gor Mahia beat AFC Leopards 1–0 to win the 1983 league and at the end of the match, President Moi presented the league to captain Peter Otieno Bassanga. Gor Mahia won the inaugural Moi Golden Cup by beating Bandari 1–0 in the final. An injury time goal by Hezborn Omollo secured the victory at Nyayo stadium. The tough Bandari outfit coached by Mohammed Kheri was at the time playing in the Coast Provincial League. Winning the Moi Golden Cup enabled Gor Mahia to participate in the 1987 Africa Cup Winners Cup. In 1989 K'Ogalo retained the Moi Golden Cup for the 3rd successive year by beating Kenya Breweries 2–0 in the final. After the match, Abass Magongo who was man of the match was carried shoulder high by fans. Gor Mahia however lost the league title to a resurgent AFC Leopards who benefited from their recruiting spree and sponsorship from Crown Paints Kenya. Having won the Moi Golden Cup the previous year, Gor Mahia were back in the Cup winners Cup in 1989. In the 1st round they received a walk over when Villa of Uganda pulled out. In round 2 they beat Costa Do Sol of Mozambique 2–1 at home and tied them 0–0 away. In the quarter finals they faced LPRC Oilers of Liberia. The 1st leg was played at Nyayo stadium. Gor Mahia played a disjointed game and the game ended 0–0. By this time, After the match, Liberian players celebrated as if they had won a Cup final. Gor Mahia team manager told the media that K'Ogalo would conquer the return leg. Indeed, they did, winning 3–1 in Monrovia. Coach Mohammed Kheri had been drafted from Bandari on a temporary basis to replace Johnson. In the semis they faced El Merreikh of Sudan. After winning the 1st leg 1–0, they lost 0–2 in the return leg in Omdurman. So Gor Mahia bowed out in the semi-final. 1990s 1996 was the most disastrous year in the club's history. The club was eliminated in the 1st round of the Africa champions league by Zimbabwean outfit, Dynamos, leading to one of the worst riots ever seen in Nairobi. In the League they finished 8th which was unprecedented in the club's history. In 1997, the club recovered and almost won the National League, only losing by goal difference to eventual winners, Utalii. Among the players who were instrumental in that campaign were Victor Onyango in goal; Josiah Ougo and Tillen Oguta in defence; Frazier Ochieng and Dan Ogada in midfield and Bonaventure Maruti, Steve Okumu and Steve Odiaga in attack. The club was unable to hold on to these superb players, many of whom left for various destinations including the Middle East. The last two years of the 20th century were characterised by inconsistent performances by the club mainly due to lack of finances. Because the club was flat broke they were unable to hire a qualified professional coach, Additionally the club has been unable to retain its quality players most of whom left after a short period for greener pastures. 2000s At one point, the club refused to pay a KPL imposed fine. However, KPL managing director received full payment of the Gor Mahia penalty from an anonymous \\"senior official of another KPL club\\" who wrote in an unsigned letter that \\"it is deeply disappointing that a few colleagues who are senior Gor Mahia officials refuse to respect the KPL policy against assaults on referees which their representative approved in February. Their refusal to respect the rules also saddens me because it is not those officials but their own players who are suffering the most after playing so well this year. Out of respect and sympathy for the Gor Mahia players, I enclose full payment of Ksh 45,063 so they can resume playing.\\" 2010s From a financial perspective, 2011 was a landmark year because that was the year that Gor Mahia secured their first ever legitimate shirt sponsorship. Previously in 1991, Gor Mahia wore shirts emblazoned International Casino. However the proceeds from that sponsorship are unknown and clouded in mystery. The Ksh. 38 million Tuzo sponsorship by Spin-Knit Dairy was the most lucrative by any club in Kenya when announced. Gor Mahia went on to win the FKL Cup and finish fourth in the league. At the beginning of the season, the club acquired Moses Odhiambo, a former international who had played in Tanzanian and Rwandese leagues and he proved to be a revelation. Teenage striker Edwin Lavatsa was also a big hit in his first season in the KPL. After strong performances in mid-season, the steam run out and Gor finished 4th in the league, largely due to disharmony in the technical bench and overcommitment of head coach Zedekiah Otieno to the Kenya national team. In Otieno's absence, Cameroonian assistant coach Anaba Awono led the club to win the FKL Cup after beating bitter rivals A.F.C. Leopards in the semis, and then edging out Sofapaka in the final. The club also conducted its elections towards the end of November and brought in many youthful officials. Gor Mahia started the 2012 season in high tempo after attending the traditional Nyanza tour to meet fans and recruit more players from the fanatical homeland. The tour itself was a gruelling 6-day affair where the team played 9 matches, winning 7 and drawing two. The club went on a signing spree in preparation for the 2012 CAF Confederation Cup, bringing in more than 10 players. Baldwin Ngwa and Ibrahim Kitawi rejoined the squad Soccer pundits and fans had cautiously termed this as one of the strongest squads ever in decades at the club. However, this was not to be, as the club, despite a winning start against Thika United in the league on 12 February 2012, went on to lose 3–0 away to debutants Muhoroni Youth and 1–0 at home to Ferroviário de Maputo of Mozambique in the first hurdle of the Confederation Cup. These matches coupled with the Super Cup loss to Tusker and another league loss to Karuturi Sports led to the disbandment of the entire technical team led by Awono. Others shown the door included assistant coach Ken Odhiambo, team manager Jolawi Obondo, coach Julius Owino and fitness coach Zablon Otieno. The 2013 season saw Gor Mahia clinch their first league title in 18 years, under the leadership of goalkeeper Jerim Onyango and coach Bobby Williamson. On the way to a record 13th title, fans of the club popularised the phrase \\"Giniwasekao\\" around the country, which is Luo for \\"we have taken this thing\\". Gor Mahia players further added to the club's mystique by finishing their Sportspesa Premier League fixtures for 2015 season unbeaten, under Head Coach Frank Nuttall Top Scorers Data compiled by K'Ogalo Pundit indicates that the club's top all-time goal scorer is Sammy Onyango 'Jogoo' who scored 92 goals in all competitive matches for the club. He is also the club's leading all-time scorer in the league competition with 79 goals. Sammy Onyango joined Gor Mahia from Hakati Sportiff in 1981 and played for the club till 1989 before seeing out his career at Kisumu Posta. He is followed by Allan Thigo with 88 goals (66 league goals) and Hesbon Omollo with 84 goals (75 league goals). Peter Dawo is the club's all-time scorer in contentinental competitions with 14 goals followed by Andrew Obunga with 7 goals and Allan Thigo with 6 goals Managerial history John Bobby Ogolla A caretaker coach, former captain and all-time legend Bobby Ogolla, took the position of head coach, assisted by Technical manager Tom Ogweno (a former Kenya national striker and Ulinzi Stars player) and was immediately thrust into tough fixtures against Tusker and A.F.C. Leopards. The team gave a very good account of themselves in both games despite losing 2–0 to the former and drawing 0–0 against the in-form Leopards in a match marred by crowd trouble. In the next matches, Gor drew 1–1 with Rangers and 0–0 with Sony as Ogolla tried to steady the ship from sinking. Zdravko Logarušić In April 2012, Croatian tactician Zdravko Logarušić was drafted as head coach. Bobby Ogolla, ever the gentleman, accepted to deputise. The first match for the pair ended in 1–1 with Mathare United, followed by a 0–1 loss to Oserian FC, a win against Sofapaka and a loss against Ulinzi in late April. This was the last loss for the club this year in any match. From there the club has won 7 out 8 KPL matches against Nairobi City Stars, Chemelil FC, KCB FC, Western stima – by doing the double in both legs except for a 1st leg fixtures ender draw against Stima. On 12 August, the club is number 6th on the log after languishing in relegation places in the first two months of the 2012 league. The club also has qualified for the KPL Top 8 tourney final against Ulinzi after dispatching Tusker in both legs of the semi-final. This after, getting a walkover in the quartes against AFC Leopards who 'feared' showing up on matchday, giving a myriad of excuses. Gor Mahia also qualified for the next round of the FKF Cup (the domestic title) after dispatching Borabu Chiefs 5–2 and are in contention for a treble. This success is attributed to the good working synergy in the technical bench, a tough fitness regime introduced by a Finnish expert, acquisition of a professional goalkeeper coach but mostly to the excellent field combination of the team's players. The technical bench has revamped and reorganised the playing unit to create a potent force within just a few months. After failing to return on time from holiday, Logarušić was sacked with immediate effect on 25 June 2013, and replaced by former Uganda national team manager Bobby Williamson 9 days later, on 5 July 2013. Bobby Williamson Bobby Williamson's managerial debut came in a league match against Sugar FC on 17 July 2013. He left the club in September 2014, being replaced by Frank Nuttall, whom he recommended to the club.

The original story (L'Aviateur) upon which the translation was based was Saint-Exupéry's first published work. L'Aviateur was excerpted from a longer unpublished manuscript, L'Évasion de Jacques Bernis (The Escape of Jacques Bernis). L'Aviateur was released in April 1926 in its excerpted form by editor Jean Prévost. It was published by Adrienne Monnier in the eleventh issue of the short-lived French literary magazine Le Navire d'Argent (The Silver Ship),Ibert, Jean-Claude. (1953) \\"Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\\", Classiques de XXe Siècle, Paris: Éditions Universitaires, 1953, p. 123. after Saint-Exupéry rewrote L'Évasion de Jacques Bernis from memory, having lost his original manuscript.Saint-Exupéry, Antoine de. A Sense of Life, Funk & Wagnalls, 1965, p. 4.M.A.K. Book Reviews: A Sense Of Life, Flying Magazine, January 1966, pg.114. Saint-Exupéry was killed during the Second World War while flying with the Free French Air Force. The work's editor, Jean Prévost, was killed only one day after Saint-Exupéry, while serving in the French Resistance. The Aviator appears as the first chapter in the Saint-Exupéry anthology, Un Sens à la Vie (A Sense of Life). The original French compilation was published posthumously in 1956 by Editions Gallimard, and translated into English by Adrienne Foulke. The story recounts various episodes in the life of the fictional French flyer, Jacques Bernis, from his early experiences as an aviator to his work as a flying instructor, to his last flight when the wing of his monoplane shatters during an aerobatic maneuver. The work is an example of Saint-Exupéry's formative writing style which would evolve into the more evocative, winning form he would later become famous for. In his short work the author uses picturesque metaphors, for example comparing the propeller wash flowing backwards like a river in his description of the movements of the grass behind an airplane: \\"Battue par le vent de l'hélice, l'herbe jusqu'à vingt mètres en arrière semble couler\\", as well as his descriptions of the physical sensation of the air becoming solid: \\"Il regarde le capot noir appuyé sur le ciel\\". In a short foreword to the story, Jean Prévost wrote: \\"I met [Saint-Exupéry] at the home of friends and greatly admired his vigor and finesse in describing his impressions as a pilot.... He has a gift for directness and truth that seems to me amazing in a beginning writer\\".  References  ; Footnotes ; Citations ; Bibliography * Commire, Anne; Gale Research Company.

He was raised as a western Canadian pioneer. He undertook his own aviation education in his eagerness to join the Royal Flying Corps. He overcame physical problems and a tendency toward airsickness to become a wingman to famed Canadian ace William George Barker. After scoring seven victories in Italy, Hilborn died on 26 August 1918, of injuries received in a flying accident. Early life William Carrall Hilborn was born on 5 July 1898 in Quesnel, British Columbia, Canada; his middle and family names were later variously given as \\"Carroll\\" and \\"Hillborn\\". His parents were Josephine Elizabeth and Stephan Lundy Hilborn. William Carrall was the second son; he would come to have six younger siblings. He grew up on his family's ranch and was taught his primary education in a school built by his father. In later years, Stephen Lundy Hilborn would build an in-town house near the nearest high school for his children to live in while receiving their post-primary education. In 1916, during World War I, William Carrall Hilborn and his older brother Clarence decided to learn to fly so they could join the Royal Flying Corps. They borrowed money towards fees of C$300 each and began training at British Columbia Aviation School Limited in October 1916. When they ran out of money, they returned home. However, they were called for training at Deseronto and graduated in Summer 1917. William enlisted on 23 July 1917, commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant on probation,Flight, 6 September 1917, p. 926. and embarked on the troopship Scotian for England, all on the same day. World War I aviation service HIlborn began advanced training in England at the Central Flying School on 15 August 1917. On 3 October 1917 he was appointed as a flying officer onto the General List, signifying his readiness for deployment as a pilot.Supplement to the London Gazette, 23 October 1917, p. 10872. He actually graduated from the Central Flying School on 14 October 1917. He was then supposed to have a nasal operation and spend two weeks recovering. He confided to his brother Clarence that he got airsick in anything but straight level flight, and that he expected to become an instructor at Upavon. However, young William joined 66 Squadron in France on 10 November 1917 just before its transfer to Italy. By December, he was in action in Italy, crashing one of the squadron's Sopwith Camels upon landing because he had lost a wheel to antiaircraft fire. On 24 December, he broke his nose while scuffling with a messmate in a friendly boxing match. On 1 May 1918 at 0850 hours, Hilborn scored his first aerial victory over Fonzano, Italy;Above the Trenches, p. 194. he set an Austro-Hungarian Albatros D.III afire with a burst of machine gun fire at 14,000 feet for his first kill. The Albatros plummeted about 1,000 feet before it came apart. Three days later, Hilborn was one of a flight of four Sopwith Camel pilots who tackled a formation of 14 enemy fighters at 0945 hours. Hilborn destroyed another Albatros D.III, this time over Conegliano. On 11 May 1918 at 1050 hours, while flying as a wingman for famed ace William George Barker, Hilborn destroyed a third Albatros over Torre di Mosto. At noon on 20 May, again flying as Barker's wingman, the young British Columbian destroyed an Austro-Hungarian Berg D.I over Fontane, Italy. Hilborn would not score his fifth victory until 18 July 1918. At 0807 hours, he destroyed an Albatros D.III over Stoccareddo. Eleven days later at 0740 hours, he would score his final triumph with 66 Squadron, destroying one more Albatros D.III, over Feltre. On 2 August 1918, Hilborn transferred to 28 Squadron. At 1140 hours on the 12th, he fired 50 rounds into a D.III over Cessalto; the Albatros stalled, Hilborn pumped in another 50 rounds, and the enemy plane broke up at 14,000 feet for Hilborn's final kill. The next day, he transferred to 45 Squadron as the flight commander of C Flight.Above the Trenches, pp. 194-195. Note: Appointment as a flight commander carried with it a promotion to captain. On 16 August, while practicing night flying, he smashed into a tree on his new home aerodrome of Grosso, fracturing his skull. He died of his injuries on 26 August 1918, and was buried in Plot 6, Row A, Grave 8, Montecchio Precalcino Communal Cemetery Extension, Italy.

The document is slid under a stationary, over-the-desk camera by hand until all parts of the document are snapshotted by the camera’s field of view. As the document slid under the camera, all motion of the document is coarsely tracked by the vision system. The document is periodically snapshotted such that the successive snapshots are overlap by about 50%. The system then finds the overlapped pairs and stitches them together repeatedly until all pairs are stitched together as one piece of document. The document mosaicing can be divided into four main processes. *Tracking *Feature detecting *Correspondences establishing *Images mosaicing. Tracking (simple correlation process) In this process, the motion of the document slid under the camera is coarsely tracked by the system. Tracking is performed by a process called simple correlation process. In the first frame of snapshots, a small patch is extracted from the center of the image as a correlation template as shown in Figure 1. The correlation process is performed in the four times size of the patch area of the next frame. The motion of the paper is indicated by the peak in the correlation function. The peak in the correlation function indicates the motion of the paper. The template is resampled from this frame and the tracking continues until the template reaches the edge of the document. After the template reaches the edge of the document, another snapshot is taken and the tracking process performs repeatedly until the whole document is imaged. The snapshots are stored in an ordered list to facilitate pairing the overlapped images in later processes. Feature detecting for efficient matching Feature detection is the process of finding the transformation that aligns one image with another. There are two main approaches for feature detection. * Feature-based approach : Motion parameters are estimated from point correspondences. This approach is suitable for the case that there is plenty supply of stable and detectable features. * Featureless approach : When the motion between the two images is small, the motion parameters are estimated using optical flow. On the other hand, when the motion between the two images is large, the motion parameters are estimated using generalised cross-correlation. However, this approach requires a computationally expensive resources. Each image is segmented into a hierarchy of columns, lines, and words to match the organised sets of features across images. Skew angle estimation and columns, lines and words finding are the examples of feature detection operations. Skew angle estimation Firstly, the angle that the rows of text make with the image raster lines (skew angle) is estimated. It is assumed to lie in the range of ±20°. A small patch of text in the image is selected randomly and then rotated in the range of ±20° until the variance of the pixel intensities of the patch summed along the raster lines is maximised. See Figure 2. To ensure that the found skew angle is accurate, the document mosaic system performs calculation at many image patches and derive the final estimation by finding the average of the individual angles weighted by the variance of the pixel intensities of each patch. Columns, lines and words finding In this operation, the de-skewed document is intuitively segmented into a hierarchy of columns, lines and words. The sensitivity to illumination and page coloration of the de-skewed document can be removed by applying a Sobel operator to the de-skewed image and thresholding the output to obtain the binary gradient, de-skewed image. See Figure 3. The operation can be roughly separated into 3 steps: column segmentation, line segmentation and word segmentation. # Columns are easily segmented from the binary gradient, de-skewed images by summing pixels vertically as shown in Figure 4. # Baselines of each row are segmented in the same way as the column segmentation process but horizontally. # Finally, individual words are segmented by applying the vertical process at each segmented row. These segmentations are important because the document mosaic is created by matching the lower right corners of words in overlapping images pair. Moreover, the segmentation operation can organize the list of images in the context of a hierarchy of rows and column reliably. The segmentation operation involves a considerable amount of summing in the binary gradient, de-skewed images, which done by construct a matrix of partial sums whose elements are given by p_{iy}=\\\\sum_{u=1}^{i}\\\\sum_{v=1}^{j}b_{uv} The matrix of partial sums is calculated in one pass through the binary gradient, de-skewed image. \\\\sum_{u=u_{1}}^{u_{2}}\\\\sum_{v=v_{1}}^{v_{2}}b_{uv}=p_{u_{2}v_{2}}+p_{u_{1}v_{1}}-p_{u_{1}v_{2}}-p_{u_{2}v_{1}} Correspondences establishing The two images are now organized in hierarchy of linked lists in following structure : * image=list of columns * row=list of words * column=list of row * word=length (in pixels) At the bottom of the structure, the length of each word is recorded for establishing correspondence between two images to reduce to search only the corresponding structures for the groups of words with the matching lengths. Seed match finding A seed match finding is done by comparing each row in image1 with each row in image2. The two rows are then compared to each other by every word. If the length (in pixel) of the two words (one from image1 and one from image2) and their immediate neighbours agree with each other within a predefined tolerance threshold (5 pixels, for example), then they are assumed to match. The row of each image is assumed a match if there are three or more word matches between the two rows. The seed match finding operation is terminated when two pairs of consecutive row match are found. Match list building After finishing a seed match finding operation, the next process is to build the match list to generate the correspondences points of the two images. The process is done by searching the matching pairs of rows away from the seed row. Images mosaicing Figure 5 : Mosaicing of two document images. Blurring is evident in the affine mosaic (b), but not in the mosaic constructed using a plane-to- plane projectivity (a). Close-ups of typical seams of (a) and (b) are shown in (c) and (d) respectively. Given the list of corresponding points of the two images, finding the transformation of the overlapping portion of the images is the next process. Assuming a pinhole camera model, the transformation between pixels (u,v) of image 1 and pixels (u0, v0) of image 2 is demonstrated by a plane-to-plane projectivity. \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{c} su'\\\\\\\\\\\\ sv'\\\\\\\\\\\\ s \\\\end{array}\\\\right]=\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{ccc} p_{11} & p_{12} & p_{13}\\\\\\\\\\\\ p_{21} & p_{22} & p_{23}\\\\\\\\\\\\ p_{31} & p_{32} & 1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{c} u\\\\\\\\\\\\ v\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right] \\\\qquad Eq.1 The parameters of the projectivity is found from four pairs of matching points. RANSAC regression technique is used to reject outlying matches and estimate the projectivity from the remaining good matches. The projectivity is fine-tuned using correlation at the corners of the overlapping portion to obtain four correspondences to sub-pixel accuracy. Therefore, image1 is then transformed into image2’s coordinate system using Eq.1. The typical result of the process is shown in Figure 5. Many images coping Finally, the whole page composition is built up by mapping all the images into the coordinate system of an “anchor” image, which is normally the one nearest the page center. The transformations to the anchor frame are calculated by concatenating the pair-wise transformations found earlier. The raw document mosaic is shown in Figure 6. However, there might be a problem of non- consecutive images that are overlap. This problem can be solved by performing Hierarchical sub-mosaics. As shown in Figure 7, image1 and image2 are registered, as are image3 and image4, creating two sub-mosaics. These two sub- mosaics are later stitched together in another mosaicing process. Applied areas There are various areas that the technique of document mosaicing can be applied to such as : *Text segmentation of images of documents *Document Recognition *Interaction with paper on the digital desk *Video mosaics for virtual environments *Image registration techniques Relevant research papers D.G.

It has been in continuous publication since 1837. Since 1980 the newspaper has been part of the Tindle Newspaper Group of local newspapers owned by Farnham Castle Newspapers and chaired by Sir Ray Tindle.Monmouthshire Beacon, British Newspapers Online, accessed 20 January 2012 The newspaper's editorial office is at Cornwall House, Monnow Street, Monmouth. The Beacon is published every Wednesday. Its sister paper, the Ross Gazette, covers nearby south Herefordshire. History The first issue was published on 14 October 1837, priced at 4½d (1.9p). It was printed by Thomas Farror at Castle Hill, Monmouth, and published by him at Agincourt Square. The first editor was Richard Ramsey Dinnis (assisted by the Rev. George Roberts). This paper had to compete with the Monmouthshire Merlin which had started publication eight years earlier. The Merlin had been started by Charles Hough in 1829, but it had bankrupted him by 1831 and it was his co-owner Reginald James Blewitt who eventually built the Merlin to have the largest newspaper circulation in Wales by 1854. The Beacon's attacks on R.J.Blewiit were so strong that the Merthyr paper disagreed with the Beacon despite their shared politics. The Beacon was backed by the Ironmaster Sir Joseph Bailey Bt. and local conservatives. It was said that the Beacons circulation was only just over 500 and was thought to run at a loss, with copies being given away. Cornwall House, where the editorial offices are located today In 1840, the Beacon produced a 200-page special report on the trial of the Chartist leaders in the Shire Hall. Monmouthshire Beacon: About Us, accessed 20 January 2012 A similar issue was published by the Monmouthshire Merlin but they took different lines. The Merlin defended the Whig government whilst the Beacon blamed it for an uprising that had led to the ring-leaders being sentenced to death. Although the Beacon did not support the uprising and realised that those involved were obliged to \\"be dealt with as enemies and aliens\\". In 1840 there was also a Monmouthshire Advertiser but this was absorbed into the Monmouthshire Beacon and Advertiser by 1850. Around 1840, John Dix claimed to have been editor of this paper but supporting evidence is not available. The Beacon's printing works and offices moved to the new Market Hall in Priory Street in 1876.Monmouth Civic Society, Guide to the Monmouth Heritage Blue Plaque Trail, n.d., p.10 In 1963, the newspaper's offices and print works were completely destroyed, together with much of the building itself, when a fire started in its paper store.Gathering the Jewels: The New Market Hall fire, Monmouth, 1963, accessed January 2012 Its offices then moved to 50 Monnow Street, and in 1987 moved again to Cornwall House, where the new offices were opened during the newspaper's 150th anniversary year by Princess Margaret.

He launched the Bitcoin platform bitLanders in 2014 and serves as the President. Rulli also co-founded Mrs. Mudd, a fashion and design consulting firm with American actor, producer and director John Malkovich. Rulli was a featured actor in Malkovich's documentary Flipping Uncle Kimono.  Career  In 2001, Rulli met Malkovich in New York through mutual friend and then ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey, and asked Malkovich if he would be interested in doing a men's clothing line. In 2002, they founded Mrs. Mudd, a fashion company selling outfits designed by Malkovich. The company released its John Malkovich menswear collection, \\"Uncle Kimono\\", in 2003 The line expressed the idiosyncratic tastes of Malkovich, with items such as the \\"Nervous Breakdown Jacket.\\"  Film Annex  Rulli founded Film Annex, a Web TV Network that allows filmmakers to create free Web TVs to present their work under specific domain names, in 2006. Film Annex helps filmmakers create a brand out of their name, company, or project, in an effort to avoid a \\"forward-slash mentality\\". The company's distribution of movies and web television aims to allow artists and filmmakers to fund their projects and promote their works with a shared advertising model. An editorial team approves the content of all films before release to ensure they are made by professionals. * In May 2010, Film Annex launched www.AbelFerrara.com a new web TV site in partnership with American screenwriter and director Abel Ferrara. Abel Ferrara TV broadcasts Ferrara’s videos, including excerpts from his films, news about his latest projects, and interviews with the filmmaker and other members of his creative team. * In November 2011, Film Annex became the online distributor for METAN Development Group to distribute Hello! Hollywood! to China, US, and Canada. * On June 27, 2013, Film Annex partnered with Matthew Modine's production company Cinco Dedos Peliculas to re-release his short film, Jesus Was a Commie, among other projects.  Afghan Citadel Software Company  As another Film Annex project, in 2012, Rulli and Roya Mahboob, founder and CEO of the Afghan Citadel Software Company (ACSC), launched the Afghan Development Project and Women's Annex. The project aims to show the world positive developments in Afghanistan by broadcasting current event videos, interviews, and news clips as well as archival material directly from Afghan Youth Development. Mahboob supplied technology training to students in 40 schools with the help of Rulli, and said it is a chance for girls to broaden their horizons. Women's Annex is an educational and financing initiative that provides women with mentoring and monetizing options for any video content they post on social media, allowing them to find opportunities to begin filmmaking careers.  Judo  Rulli is a member of the New York Athletic Club's Judo Club, chaired by Kevin Earls and Owen Tunney, and he is a Yodan (4th degree black belt) as an active competitor in Judo. He is a coach of and helps run the NYAC’s Saturday morning program, which is organized for NYAC members’ children to receive exposure to and basic training in judo. Rulli is the Producer of JudoArts.com. Film Annex and Rulli sponsored the 2013 New York Judo Open. Competition directors were Mel Appelbaum, Dr Arthur Canario, and John Walla. Film Annex has filmed the tournament and conducted interviews with the athletes since 2010. As a supporter of Judo, Rulli and Malkovich presented an unconventional fashion show in the documentary \\"Flipping Uncle Kimono\\", using 20 Judo fighters as models during a Milan fashion show that looked like a championship Judo match with the fighters wearing men's suits from the Mrs. Mudd fashion line by Malkovich. They did this on a stage in a courtyard in Milan, in front of a live audience, and with Malkovich and Rulli directing the action.

After he documented abuses of prisoners at Kahrizak detention center, he was sentenced to five years in prison by the Iranian government, drawing international protest on his behalf.  Early life  As a student, Davari volunteered to fight in the Iran-Iraq War, in which he was wounded in the eye and leg. He went on to become a journalist, acting as editor-in-chief for the Saham News, the news website of opposition presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi. In early 2009, Davari began to document abuses at Kahrizak detention center, videotaping statements from prisoners who alleged that they had been raped, abused, and tortured, and posting the interviews on Saham News. By July, the detention center was closed amid public uproar. On 8 September 2009, however, Davari was arrested when authorities launched a series of raids on the offices of opposition leaders. The Saham News office was sealed, and authorities confiscated documents, computers, and photographs. Davari was later sentenced to five years' imprisonment for \\"mutiny against the regime\\", and transferred to Evin Prison. According to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran (ICHRI), he was then tortured in an attempt to make him testify against Karroubi. Davari's term was later increased by an additional year for his inability to pay a $5,000 fine levied against him for attending a teacher's union protest in 2006. In 2011, ICHRI reported that Davari's health was deteriorating due to the conditions of his confinement, and that he was suffering from severe depression. Davari's imprisonment received international attention, with Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, and the Committee to Protect Journalists all issuing statements on his behalf. The Committee to Protect Journalists also awarded him the 2010 International Press Freedom Award, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\".

She is also known for her work in DDT Pro-Wrestling, where she is a former three-time Ironman Heavymetalweight Champion. After a three-year hiatus, she returned in November 2015, now working for Apple Star Puroresu. Professional wrestling career Ice Ribbon (2006–2012) Minami was trained by Gatokunyan wrestler Emi Sakura and made her professional wrestling debut at the age of eleven on February 12, 2006, working under the ring name Hikari and facing Sakura, Aika Ando, Hinata and Kinoko in a five-way match at an event in Itabashi, Tokyo. On April 29, Hikari won her first professional wrestling championship, defeating Aika to win Dramatic Dream Team's (DDT) Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship. Six days later, Hikari lost the title to Misae Genki, only to regain it from Miki Ishii later that same day. Hikari's second reign with the title came to an end on June 5, when she was defeated by Natsuki☆Head. In April 2006, Emi Sakura left Gatokunyan and took most of her trainees, Hikari included, with her to form the core of her new Ice Ribbon promotion. Hikari made her debut for Ice Ribbon at the promotion's second ever event on June 20, defeating her elementary school friend Seina. During the next six months, Hikari and Seina developed a storyline rivalry, facing each other in four more singles matches, with Hikari winning the series 4–1. On December 5, Hikari wrestled male wrestler Ken Ohka to a time limit draw, which led to the two forming a partnership on January 8, 2007. The two have wrestled semi-regularly as a tag team ever since. In late January, Hikari began competing under the ring name Hikari Minami, after getting the blessing of former All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling performer and family friend Suzuka Minami to use the surname. In storyline, Hikari is sometimes referred to as Suzuka's niece and billed as the \\"Second Generation Marine Wolf\\"; Marine Wolves being the former tag team of Suzuka Minami and Akira Hokuto. During the rest of the year, Minami's rivalry with Seina also came to include Seina's younger sister Riho. From December 7, 2007, to December 13, 2008, Minami took an entire year off professional wrestling to concentrate on finishing junior high school. In her return match, Minami wrestled old rival Seina to a time limit draw. The following year, Minami began making challenges for Ice Ribbon's top championship, the ICE×60 Championship, failing in two title matches against Emi Sakura and one against Tsukasa Fujimoto. On June 5, 2010, Minami turned heel by attacking ICE×60 Champion Emi Sakura from behind, after she had successfully defended the title against Tsukushi, before announcing her intention of going for the championship herself. On July 10, Minami defeated Hikaru Shida, Riho and Tsukasa Fujimoto in a four-way match, scoring all three eliminations in the process, to become the number one contender to Sakura's title. Nine days later, Minami defeated Sakura to win the ICE×60 Championship for the first time. After a 66-day reign, Minami lost the title to JWP Joshi Puroresu wrestler Command Bolshoi in her first defense. Minami in March 2011 On December 24, Minami made her debut for Smash at Happening Eve, where she teamed with Chii Tomiya and Kushida in a six-person tag team match, where they were defeated by Isami Kodaka, Makoto and Yusuke Kodama. In late 2010 and early 2011, Minami made appearances for Union Pro Wrestling, performing under a mask and the character of Black Cherry #2 as part of the storyline rivalry between Cherry and Black Cherry, portrayed by fellow Ice Ribbon wrestler Riho. Minami returned to Smash on March 31, 2011, at Smash.15, where she, Riho and Tsukushi defeated Emi Sakura, Makoto and Mochi Miyagi in a six-woman tag team match. The following month, Minami and Riho began producing their own events under the banner of \\"Teens\\", which would focus on spotlighting Ice Ribbon's younger wrestlers. On May 27, Minami defeated Tsukushi to win Ice Ribbon's 19 O'Clock Girls ProWrestling project's Internet Wrestling 19 Championship for the first time. Minami lost the title to Chii Tomiya only five days later in her first defense. On June 15, Minami defeated Remi Nagano to win the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship for the third time. She would lose the title to Emi Sakura later that same day. On August 7, Minami made her debut for the JWP promotion, losing to Command Bolshoi. During the match, Minami suffered a bloody lip and a ruptured eardrum as a result of Bolshoi hitting her with multiple shoteis. Upon her return to Ice Ribbon, Minami pinned ICE×60 Champion Tsukasa Fujimoto on August 13 in a ten-woman tag team captain's fall match and was as a result named the number one contender to her title. On August 21, Minami defeated Fujimoto to win the ICE×60 Championship for the second time. During the next few weeks, Minami went on to successfully defend the title against Chii Tomiya and Hikaru Shida. In October, Minami, Emi Sakura, Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto traveled to Nottingham, England to take part in events promoted by Pro Wrestling EVE and Southside Wrestling Entertainment (SWE). During the tour, Minami successfully defended the ICE×60 Championship for the third time, against Shanna. During 2011, Minami also took part in Ice Ribbon's interpromotional rivalry with the Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling promotion. On October 27, Minami, Emi Sakura, Hikaru Shida, Tsukasa Fujimoto and Tsukushi represented Ice Ribbon in Sendai's Joshi Puroresu Dantai Taikou Flash tournament, a single-elimination tournament, where different joshi promotions battled each other. The team was eliminated from the tournament in the first round by Team Sendai (Meiko Satomura, Dash Chisako, Kagetsu, Miyako Morino and Sendai Sachiko). After successfully defending the ICE×60 Championship against Kurumi on November 5, Minami continued her heelish behaviour, first refusing to accept Tsukasa Fujimoto's challenge for the title and then calling Emi Sakura a dictator and accusing her of playing favorites, after the title match was made official. On November 19, Minami lost the ICE×60 Championship back to Fujimoto in her fifth defense, ending her reign at 90 days. Despite already being a former three- time Ironman Heavymetalweight Champion, Minami only began working regularly for DDT Pro-Wrestling in November 2011, when she took part in an audition battle royal, which eventually led to Danshoku Dino and Makoto Oishi electing her as the newest member of their Homoiro Clover Z stable, breaking Minami's longtime partnership with Ken Ohka in the process. On December 25 at RibbonMania 2011, Seina returned to Ice Ribbon, after a two-year hiatus, to wrestle her retirement match against her sister Riho. After the match, a tearful Minami entered the ring and challenged her childhood friend to a three-minute match, which she accepted. Minami went on to win the match in just under three minutes with the Blockbuster. On January 4, 2012, Minami won Ribbon: The Best 2012, a six-person tag team match set to determine the new face of the promotion in the aftermath of Emi Sakura's departure. After a nine-month break, Minami brought back the Teens concept, producing Teens4 on March 3, where she was defeated by Riho in the main event. On July 28, Minami reunited with Command Bolshoi to enter JWP's annual Natsu Onna Kettei Tournament, which JWP this time co-produced with Ice Ribbon. After a victory over the team of Kazuki and Miyako Matsumoto, Minami and Bolshoi were eliminated from the tournament by Arisa Nakajima and Hikaru Shida in a semifinal match that went to overtime following an original fifteen-minute time limit draw. On August 20 at Teens7, Minami teamed with Stardom's Mayu Iwatani in a tag team main event, where they were defeated by Stardom's Eri Susa and JWP's Manami Katsu. Following the match, Minami announced that she was taking an indefinite break from professional wrestling to concentrate on her college entrance exam. On January 2, 2013, it was announced that Minami had officially quit Ice Ribbon effective December 31, 2012. Apple Star Puroresu (2015–present) On October 6, 2015, it was announced that Minami would be returning and wrestling her first match in over three years at Apple Star Puroresu's inaugural event on November 27, 2015. On November 27, Minami was defeated in her return match by Ayako Hamada. On January 10, 2016, it was announced that Minami had signed an exclusive contract with Apple Star Puroresu. On February 28, Minami made her debut for Reina Joshi Puroresu, teaming with Konami in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Kagetsu and Yako Fujigasaki.

She was trained by Emi Sakura and debuted for her Ice Ribbon promotion in May 2006, at the age of nine. She would work for the promotion for the next six years, becoming its first Triple Crown Champion, having won the ICE×60 Championship, the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship and the Triangle Ribbon Championship once each. She also became a Jiyugaoka 6-Person Tag Team, Sea Of Japan 6-Person Tag Team and UWA World Trios Champion, unifying the three titles in July 2010, teaming with The Great Kojika and Mr. #6. Riho left Ice Ribbon in September 2012 to join Gatoh Move Pro Wrestling, a new promotion founded by Sakura, who had left Ice Ribbon the previous January. In November 2014, Riho won the IWA Triple Crown Championship. In May 2019, Riho began making appearances for All Elite Wrestling (AEW). She defeated Nyla Rose to become the inaugural AEW Women's World Champion, and held the title for 133 days, before Rose defeated her at Revolution. Riho also began appearing in World Wonder Ring Stardom, working in conjunction with her AEW committments. She won the High Speed Championship in her first match for the promotion, and held the title for 351 days, dropping it to AZM in July 2020. Professional wrestling career Ice Ribbon (2006–2012) In 2006, when Riho was only nine years old and still in elementary school, she and her older sister Seina began training professional wrestling under Emi Sakura at her Ice Ribbon dojo. She made her debut in an exhibition match against Nanae Takahashi on May 29, 2006 in Shinagawa, Tokyo. On July 25, Riho made her debut for Ice Ribbon at the promotion's third ever event, defeating Makoto. Riho's first year in professional wrestling consisted mainly of matches with Emi Sakura, Hikari Minami and Seina. In March 2008, Riho and Seina faced each other in a four match series, which Riho won 3–1. On October 24, 2008, Riho won her first professional wrestling championship, when she teamed with Yuki Sato to defeat Chounko and Masako Takanashi for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. On December 23, Riho was entered into a tournament to determine the inaugural ICE×60 Champion, but was eliminated in the semifinals by Seina, who would go on to become the champion. After successfully defending the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship against Emi Sakura and Ribbon Takanashi, Riho and Sato vacated the title, after Riho fractured her right leg on March 31, 2009. For most of 2009, Riho was involved in a storyline rivalry with Chii Tomiya, which eventually led to the two forming the tag team Miniature Dachs in November. On November 28, 2009, Riho defeated Nanae Takahashi and Tsukasa Fujimoto to become the inaugural Triangle Ribbon Champion. After one successful title defense, Riho lost the title to Miyako Matsumoto on March 22, 2010. However, just twelve days later, Riho came back to defeat Matsumoto for the ICE×60 Championship, the promotion's top title. In the process, Riho also became Ice Ribbon's first Triple Crown Champion. During the post-match celebration, Riho nominated her trainer Emi Sakura as her first challenger for the belt. On May 3 at Golden Ribbon, Riho became the youngest person to ever main event a show in Korakuen Hall, when she lost the ICE×60 Championship to Sakura in her first defense, ending her title reign at just 30 days. Riho in February 2010 In January 2011, Riho came together with Ice Ribbon's younger wrestlers, including former associates Chii Tomiya and Hikari Minami, to form the Heisei YTR (Young Traditional Revolution) stable, under the leadership of Makoto. On February 6, Riho and Makoto made it to the finals of the Ike! Ike! Ima, Ike! Ribbon Tag Tournament, before being defeated by Muscle Venus (Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto) in a match that was also contested for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. On March 31, Riho made her debut for Smash at Smash.15, where she teamed with Hikari Minami and Tsukushi to defeat Emi Sakura, Makoto and Mochi Miyagi in a six-woman tag team match, scoring the deciding pinfall over Miyagi. The following month, Riho and Minami began producing their own events under the banner of \\"Teens\\", which would focus on spotlighting Ice Ribbon's younger wrestlers. In August, the alliance between Riho and Makoto was broken, when Makoto announced that she would be leaving Ice Ribbon for Smash. On August 11, Riho interrupted a Smash press conference, where the transfer was made official, by attacking Smash promoter Tajiri and challenging him to a match. The match took place on August 21, during Makoto's final night in Ice Ribbon, and saw Tajiri pick up the win. On December 25 at RibbonMania 2011, Seina returned to Ice Ribbon, after a two-year hiatus, to wrestle her retirement match against her Riho. Riho won the match in eight minutes and afterwards refereed a three-minute match, where Seina was defeated by her longtime friend Hikari Minami. In early 2012, Riho began teaming regularly with Hikari Minami, after the latter brought back the Teens concept, producing Teens4 on March 3. On April 15 at Teens5, Riho won a tournament to earn the right to book herself a match for Teens6. On May 24, Riho made her debut for Wrestling New Classic (WNC), the follow-up promotion to Smash, when she replaced an injured Mio Shirai in a tag team match, where she and Makoto were defeated by Kana and Syuri.

On September 1, Riho announced that she was quitting Ice Ribbon after the September 23 Korakuen Hall event to reunite with Emi Sakura, who had left the promotion in the beginning of the year. On September 17, Riho wrestled her final match at the Ice Ribbon Dojo in Saitama, teaming with her hand-picked partner Tsukasa Fujimoto in a tag team match, where they defeated Hiroyo Matsumoto and Hamuko Hoshi, with Riho pinning Hoshi for the win. On September 23 at Ribbon no Kishitachi 2012, Riho was defeated by Aoi Kizuki in her Ice Ribbon farewell match. DDT Pro-Wrestling (2010) In June 2010, Riho began making appearances for DDT Pro-Wrestling (DDT). On June 13, she teamed with Kenny Omega and Mr. #6 to defeat Mr. Strawberry, Muscle Sakai and O.K. Revolution for the Sea Of Japan 6-Person Tag Team Championship. On July 20, Omega left the championship team, after which the title was declared vacant, before Riho, Mr. #6 and The Great Kojika were announced as the new champions on July 24.

Jumonji remained with Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling her entire career, before retiring in January 2016. Professional wrestling career Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling (2005–2016) On October 2, 2005, Jumonji, along with her sister Chisako, took part in a professional wrestling audition held by Meiko Satomura. After passing the audition, both of the Jumonji sisters were admitted to the first training class of Satomura's new Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling promotion, and began training under her the following December. Jumonji made her professional wrestling debut on July 9, 2006, at Sendai Girls' first ever event, where she, working under the ring name Sachiko Kanari, was defeated by Kyoko Inoue. Much like her sister, Jumonji's career started with a losing streak, which finally ended on May 6, 2007, when she defeated Yurie Kaneko. In August, the Jumonji sisters began regularly wrestling together as a tag team, and on September 8, both of them were given new ring names, when Sachiko began wrestling as Sendai Sachiko and her sister as Dash Chisako. In late 2007, the sisters also began making appearances for Ibuki and JWP Joshi Puroresu, with one notable match seeing the Jumonji sisters defeating the Shirai sisters (Io and Mio) on December 31, 2007, at JWP's 5th Junior All Star event. Following the loss, both Sachiko and Chisako began concentrating on their singles careers. On January 18, 2008, Sachiko made it to the finals of the 1st New Year tournament, before losing to Ryo Mizunami. On May 23, Sachiko was eliminated by Ayako Sato in the quarterfinals of her first Jaja Uma tournament. The following month, Sachiko reformed her tag team with her sister. On December 21, the Jumonji sisters made it to the finals of a one night tag team tournament, before losing to the team of Devil Masami and Ryo Mizunami.

On April 19, Sachiko first defeated Misaki Ohata in the semifinals and then Ryo Mizunami in the finals to win the 2009 Jaja Uma tournament. However, Sachiko's singles career came to a halt on May 31, 2009, when she broke her fibula and tore ligaments in her left ankle in an Ibuki match, where she, Ryo Mizunami and Yukari Ishino faced Esui, Fuka and Shuu Shibutani, leaving her sidelined from professional wrestling for ten months.

USUV is a flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis complex. USUV has been reported from several African countries including Senegal, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, and Morocco. Only two human cases have been identified in Africa, in 1981 and 2004, with one benign and one severe case described. The virus was identified for the first time outside of Africa in 1996 in Italy, where it caused significant mortality among Old World blackbirds.doi: 10.3201/eid1902.121191. The first human case outside of Africa was reported in Italy in 2009, where an immunocompromised patient was infected, causing encephalitis. thumb|Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of USUV-uninfected (A, C) and –infected (B, D, F and F) blackbird organs using an USUV-specific murine monoclonal antibody.

A 2008-2009 survey of mosquitoes and birds in Emilia-Romagna detected USUV in 89 Culex pipiens pools and in 2 Aedes albopictus pools. Twelve wild birds, primarily European Magpies (Pica pica), Hooded Crows (Corvus cornix), and Eurasian Jays (Garrulus glandarius), were determined to be USUV-positive. USUV detection in mosquito species confirms the role of Culex pipiens as the main vector and the possible involvement of Aedes albopictus in the virus cycle.

The book, first published in France by François Maspero, established Althusser's reputation. However, Althusser later criticized the work, believing that in it he had neglected the class struggle. Summary Althusser, a leading theoretician of the French Communist Party, discusses the work of the philosopher Karl Marx, including texts such as Das Kapital and The German Ideology (1932). He also discusses the work of the philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach. Background and publication history Except for its introduction, the chapters of For Marx first appeared as articles that were published in journals of the French Communist Party between 1960 and 1964. For Marx was first published in 1965 by François Maspero. An Italian translation was published in 1967, and an English translation, by Ben Brewster, in 1969. The book has been published in English by Verso Books. Reception For Marx established Althusser's reputation. Together with Reading Capital (1965), the book drew Althusser to the attention of French intellectuals and attracted a significant international readership. It provided one of the most politically influential of the philosophical reinterpretations of Das Kapital that were made by Marxists in the 1960s and 1970s. The appearance of Reading Capital and For Marx in English translation influenced the development of Marxist thought in the Anglophone world throughout the 1970s. However, For Marx has attracted criticism from both anti-Marxists, such as the philosopher Roger Scruton, and from Marxist theorists, such as the Marxian economist Harry Cleaver. According to the philologist Sebastiano Timpanaro, the Marxist Italian philosopher Cesare Luporini, despite his largely favorable view of Althusser, commented that Althusser's anti-humanism, \\"manifests itself in a tendency to make man disappear as much as possible from the framework of the so-called human sciences.\\" 'For Marx'-bubble: Wikidata SPARQL-query regarding editions of Althusser's For Marx Scruton maintains that For Marx is poorly written and obscure. Scruton criticizes Althusser for employing technical terms without explaining them. He also argues that it is doubtful that Althusser's interpretation of historical materialism is true to Marx's intentions, and that it does not deserve to be considered a coherent theory, that it effectively abandons the Marxian thesis that base determines superstructure, that it effectively abandons historical materialism itself, that it is irrefutable in the sense that no possible event would be inconsistent with it, and that it makes no useful predictions. He further suggests that Althusser's supporters had difficulty agreeing on how For Marx should be understood. Cleaver considers For Marx and Reading Capital an attempt by Althusser and his colleagues to reinterpret Marx with the \\"aim of revitalizing dialectical materialism as an ideology to mediate the widely discredited political practices of the French Communist Party.\\" He criticizes Althusser's science of history for being ahistorical and abstract. According to Cleaver, Althusser was subsequently critical of For Marx, believing that it largely ignored the class struggle. Cleaver writes that the only revision Althusser considered necessary was to redefine philosophy, from being a \\"theory of theoretical practice\\" to being \\"the class struggle in theory\\", and that Althusser thus retained the basic theoretical structure of For Marx.

Two versions of this painting exist, one in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the other in the Louvre Museum (La Madeleine a la veilleuse). History The Louvre version of the painting was bought in 1949 from the French Administration des Douanes. In the somewhat uncertain chronology of Georges de La Tour's work, this painting has been allotted the date of 1640, by analogy with the Saint Mary with a Mirror, which has been dated between 1635 and 1645. The location of this painting before 1949 is unknown.  Georges de La Tour  Georges de La Tour was a Catholic Baroque artist with a successful career, despite the fact that he was working at an unsettling time of religious wars and the violence that followed. He learned many tricks from Caravaggio such as tenebrism, an especially dramatic contrast between light and shadow. Like Caravaggio, in Georges de La Tour's younger days he was interested in low-life disreputable scenes of hoaxers, thieves, and swindlers. Unlike Caravaggio, Georges de La Tour was not violent or a murderer. His artwork is known to be thoughtful, genuine, and sincere. He painted many versions of the Magdalene, which suggests that several of his patrons were interested in this theme. Throughout his Magdalene series he demonstrates small changes in lighting, pose, and symbolism. Although the changes are small, the paintings seems to portray a number of different meanings and emotions. By the 1620s, de La Tour was offered substantial court patronage in Lorraine and royal patronage in Paris. In the 1630s, during the Thirty Years War, La Tour spent time in Paris painting for Cardinal Richelieu. He also painted for King Louis XIII and presented him with a Night Scene with Saint Sebastian. He was then titled painter-in-ordinary to the king.  Mary Magdalene in Baroque art  During the 17th century, great devotion was shown to Mary Magdalene in all Catholic countries. She was the perfect lover of Christ, her beauty was made more appealing because of her repentance, which had a special attraction for a period so passionately interested in problems of mysticism, quietism and asceticism. The theme of the repentance of sinners and trials sent by God is illustrated in subjects such as the Repentance of St. Peter, Mary Magdalene, and Job. A number of written works give evidence to the cult of Magdalene and this cult became widespread since Provence contained two great sanctuaries dedicated to her: the grotto of La Sainte-Baume, and the Saintes-Maries-de-la- Mer. After being introduced to Jesus Christ, and along with her sister Martha, Mary Magdalene became one of Christ's most devoted followers. Mary Magdalene became a symbol of the sacrament of penance and contemplation. In Baroque art, Mary Magdalene is usually shown beneath Christ's feet because according to interpretations of the Bible, she was a prostitute who washed Jesus's feet using her hair and tears. She is also known to have witnessed Jesus's crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. In paintings, she is usually recognized as a saint with a halo above her head and she often holds an ointment jar. In the Baroque era, the image of Mary Magdalene went through a change. If the medieval Magdalene was shown as a former sinner who was saved through salvation, Mary Magdalene during the Counter-Reformation was depicted as beguilingly seductive. Like other saints, Mary Magdalene was often used as propaganda for the Catholic sacraments. For example, Francesco Vanni's painting, The Last Communion of Mary Magdalene, shows the practice of communion with a dying woman, which made a statement about the triumph of the Catholic faith against disagreements with Protestantism. Visual analysis  Subject matter  The Magdalene with the Smoking Flame portrays Mary Magdalene with a skull on her lap and a brightly lit candle on the desk. She has her hand under her chin while staring at the candle. There are two books placed on the desk, like the books in the other versions of the paintings. One of the books is the Holy Bible. There is also a cross and a rope on top of the desk. The rope looks similar to the rope that is tied around her waist. Her shoulders are bare and her skirt only reaches to her knees leaving her legs bare. Georges de La Tour paints Magdalene with her hand tucked under her chin, contemplating death with the slight touch of the skull with her other hand. In the Magdalene with the Smoking Flame there is no mirror in the painting compared to Magdalene at the Mirror and Magdalene with Two Flames. The Magdalene in this painting is not monochrome like the other versions.  Influences  Most of Georges de La Tour's paintings were influenced by Caravaggio and his followers from Rome. Caravaggio's followers spread throughout other European countries; therefore, it was not necessary for Georges de La Tour to travel to Italy. De La Tour was not only inspired by Caravaggio's style, but also by other northern styles. He concentrated on dramatic effects of light and shade called tenebrism. Georges de La Tour took Caravaggio's style of tenebrism and made it into something new and entirely his own. He created several monumental paintings that are different from both Italian art and Caravaggism. He brought many characteristics of mystery, tranquil grandeur, and silence into his artwork which brings it closer to French classical art and literature.  Versions  Georges de La Tour, Magdalene at a Mirror or Repentant Magdalene, 1635-1640, oil on canvas, National Gallery of Art Georges de La Tour, Magdalene with Two Flames, 1625-1650 (exact date unknown), oil on canvas, Metropolitan Museum of Art NY There are two other works on the same theme by de La Tour. Magdalene at the Mirror (National Gallery of Art) is an oil on-canvas painting created circa 1635–1640. This version is known to be the original painting out of the Magdalene series. In Magdalene at the Mirror, Magdalene is shown in profile view sitting in front of the mirror, candle, and skull. The skull is on top of the Bible on the desk and the candle is covered by the skull. The viewer can only observe the top of the slightly shown candle and the light illuminating around it. The mirror shows the side of the skulls face yet the skull has its back towards the mirror. The mirror symbolizes vanity while the skull is a metaphor of mortality. The candlelight most likely stands for spiritual enlightenment. Martha with Magdalene at the Mirror was also painted by Caravaggio during the 16th century. Magdalene with Two Flames (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) is an oil-on-canvas painting created between 1625 and 1650. The date exact date is unknown. The skull is placed on Magdalene's lap with her hands clasped over the head. The candle is brightly lit and is reflected within the mirror. The light from the candle illuminates throughout the room and on the wall where we see Magdalene's shadow.

He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig in 1725 for the third Sunday after Epiphany and first performed it on 21 January 1725, as part of his chorale cantata cycle. It is based on the hymn by Albert, Duke of Prussia, published in 1554, on the topic of the Christian's acceptance of God's will.  History and words  When Bach composed the cantata, he was in his second year as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig. During his first year, beginning with the first Sunday after Trinity 1723, he had written a cycle of cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year. In his second year he composed a second annual cycle of cantatas, which was planned to consist exclusively of chorale cantatas, each based on one Lutheran hymn. It included Was mein Gott will, das g'scheh allzeit. Bach wrote the cantata for the Third Sunday after Epiphany. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the Epistle to the Romans, rules for life (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the healing of a leper (). The cantata text is based on a chorale in four stanzas, which is still popular. Three stanzas were written by Albert, Duke of Prussia, who introduced the Reformation into Prussia. An anonymous hymnwriter added the final stanza already in the first publication in 1554. In the typical format of Bach's chorale cantatas, the first and last stanza are retained unchanged, while an unknown librettist paraphrased the inner stanzas to texts for recitatives and arias. In this case, he transcribed rather freely each stanza of the hymn to a sequence of aria and recitative. Similar to Bach's cantata for the same occasion in the first cycle, , the text deals with the Christian's acceptance of God's will.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Chorus: # Aria (bass): # Recitative (alto): # Aria (alto, tenor): # Recitative (soprano): # Chorale:  Music  In the opening chorus, the soprano sings the melody of the chorale as a in long notes. The melody appears in an interesting combination of phrases of different length, two measures alternating with three measures. Bach used a simpler version of the melody, with all phrases of measures, when he used the first stanza in his St Matthew Passion as movement 25. In the cantata, the lower voices prepare each entrance by imitation, sometimes repeating the line to the soprano's long final note. The vocal parts are embedded in an independent orchestral concerto of the oboes, the strings and at times even the continuo. In movement 2, a bass aria, the librettist kept the line from the hymn \\"\\" unchanged, Bach treats it to quotation of the chorale tune for both the quotation and the free continuation \\"\\" (and the life of your soul). Movement 4 is a duet of alto and tenor, \\"\\" (Thus I walk with encouraged steps). The steps are taken together in 3/4 time, in \\"a minuet of a strongly assertive and confident character. But this should not surprise us; we have seen how Bach often takes suite rhythms, particularly minuet and gavotte, to represent the civilized movements of souls progressing towards heaven\\", as Julian Mincham describes it. Movement 5, a soprano recitative stresses the final words \\"O blessed, desired end!\\" in an arioso. It leads to the closing chorale, a \\"simple but powerful four-part setting\\" of the last stanza.

Working mainly in a Neo-Classical style, his extensive output made a significant contribution to the Monmouth townscape. The architectural historian John Newman writes that his buildings \\"give(.) Monmouth its particular architectural flavour. For two decades from the mid-1820s he put up a sequence of public buildings and private houses in the town, in a style deft, cultured, and only occasionally unresolved.\\" The Market Hall and 1-6 Priory Street are considered Maddox's \\"most important projects\\". Life and works Maddox was born in 1802, the son of another architect, John Maddox,Public Architecture, House of Correction, Usk , accessed 19 January 2012; \\"the only son of James Maddox, a builder of Monmouth, and was doubtless related to George Maddox\\" (Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600–1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Maddox, George Vaughan\\". who also worked in the county. Maddox designed some of Monmouth's most notable buildings, including the Market Hall, \\"his major work\\", the Beaufort Arms Hotel, the Methodist Church, the Masonic Hall, Kingsley House, Oak House, and 18 St James Street,.NONCONFORMITY IN MONMOUTH, Newsletter No. 29, Capel, The Chapels Heritage Society, accessed January 2012 For much of his life, Maddox lived at 8 Monk Street, Monmouth.Building permission , accessed January 2012 In the early 1830s, Maddox won a competition organised by the Borough Council in Monmouth, to design a new scheme which would relieve Church Street of through traffic, and provide new accommodation for slaughterhouses and a new Market Hall to replace the market beneath the Shire Hall which faced disruption because of the need to extend the accommodation for the Assizes. Maddox proposed a new carriage road running above the bank of the River Monnow, supported by a viaduct. The Market Hall, with a crescent-shaped frontage of Bath Stone in a Doric style, and an Ionic cupola and clerestory above the central part of the building, was built on one side of the road, and a long convex stuccoed frontage, 1-6 Priory Street, on the opposite side. The new slaughterhouses, comprising 24 rooms with openings onto the river so that their waste would drain directly into it, were sited beneath the sandstone arches of the viaduct. The new road – now Priory Street – was opened in 1834, and the Market Hall in 1840. His other works include Pentwyn at Rockfield, which he built as his own residence in 1834–37; and Croft-y-Bwla, a villa midway between Monmouth and Rockfield which was the home of Alexander Rolls and his first wife Kate Steward Rolls. He also undertook a limited early re-building of The Hendre, and carried out work in Commercial Street, Pontypool. Cadw suggests that Maddox was also the architect of the main block of Piercefield House, near Chepstow, working to designs by Sir John Soane. Given the date of Maddox's birth, and the construction period for Piercefield, this seems unlikely. The architectural historian John Newman follows the more conventional attribution to Soane himself. Maddox died at Hempsted Rectory, Gloucestershire on 27 February 1864.

History Shropshire was historically split between the diocese of Hereford (under the Archdeacon of Shropshire) and the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield (under the Archdeacon of Salop). The Shropshire archdeaconry in the Hereford diocese included the deaneries of Burford, Stottesdon, Ludlow, Pontesbury, Clun and Wenlock and the Salop archdeaconry in the Coventry and Lichfield diocese the deaneries of Salop and Newport. In 1876, the archdeaconry of Shropshire became the archdeaconry of Ludlow, with the additional deaneries of Bridgnorth, Montgomery, Bishops Castle, Condover, and Church Stretton, which had been added in 1535. The archdeaconry of Salop, now entirely in the Lichfield diocese, includes the deaneries of Edgmond, Ellesmere, Hodnet, Shrewsbury, Telford, Wem, Whitchurch and Wrockwardine. Part of Welsh Shropshire was included in the diocese of St Asaph until the disestablishment of the Church in Wales (1920), comprising the deanery of Oswestry in the archdeaconry of Montgomery, and two parishes in the deanery of Llangollen and the archdeaconry of Wrexham.

The courts considered the question whether the Nazi law was so iniquitous that it should refuse to recognise it as law, thus raising the \\"connection between the concepts of law and morality\\".Meyerson, Denise, Essential Jurisprudence, Routledge, Cavendish, 2006 The respondent, Frederick Cattermole, was HM Inspector of Taxes. In the House of Lords, Lord Cross of Chelsea famously held: Background Mr Meier Oppenheimer \\"was born in Germany in 1896. He qualified there as a teacher and for some 20 years from 1919 to 1939 he taught at a Jewish orphanage in Bavaria. He was detained for a short time at the concentration camp at Dachau, but soon after his release he left Germany in 1939 for England and has resided here ever since. In 1948 he applied for naturalisation and became a naturalised British subject. In 1953 the German authorities determined to make compensation to the employees of Jewish religious communities. They awarded the taxpayer a pension from 1 October 1952. In 1961 he became 65 and they awarded him a second pension. Both pensions were payable out of the public funds of Germany.\\"http://uniset.ca/naty/maternity/oppenheimer1.html The pensions were as compensation for the injustice which had been done to him. The question for the courts was whether Oppenheimer was liable to pay English income tax on his two pensions. This depended on his nationality. If he was a national of the United Kingdom only, the tax was payable. If, on the other hand he had dual nationality of both the UK and Germany, then he was exempt of English income tax. This stemmed from the double taxation conventions concluded between the UK and Germany, later incorporated into English law. In 1968, the German Federal Constitutional Court decided that the 1941 decree was void ab initio, but that decision had no retrospective effect. Mr Oppenheimer became entitled to apply for reinstatement as a German national and did so, with the status being granted automatically. He subsequently benefited from the dual nationality provision in the double taxation agreement, so the case only covered his status and pension from 1953-54 to 1967-68. The decision at first instance The case was first determined by the UK Special Commissioners for income tax, who decided that Oppenheimer was only British, and not also German, and therefore had to pay tax on his pensions. Their decision was based on a 1913 German law, when there were no complications of the countries being at war, which stated that a German lost their German nationality if they acquired a foreign nationality without permission. The commissioners found it unnecessary to decide the case on another German law of 1941, which decreed that a Jew in Germany lost his German nationality as soon as he left Germany. It is important to note that under Art. 116 (2) of the post-war German Constitution, any victim of the 1941 decree was entitled to resume his German citizenship by applying to the German authorities. This he had not done. Oppenehimer submitted on his UK nationality form that he was German at the time of being nationalised in 1948. Judgment by Goulding J The administrative decision by the Special Commissioners for income tax was then decided by Goulding J, who determined in Oppenheimer’s favour; he was declared to have both nationalities, and did not need to pay tax on his pensions.Goulding J Chancery Division Oppenheimer v Cattermole (Inspector of Taxes) [1972] 2 All ER 529 Goulding agreed with the argument of counsel for Oppenheimer that the 1913 German Act had no effect as he had already lost his nationality with the 1941 Act which was effective only on Jews. This then created the option by English law that he was also German, a legal fiction. The logic behind this is the subject of an article written by the legal commentator J. G. Merrills, the Edward Bramley Professor of Law at Sheffield University.The International and Comparative Law Quarterly. Vol. 23, No. 1, Jan., 1974. One Nationality or Two? Page 143. Judgment in the Court of Appeal The decision by Goulding J was appealed by the Special Commissioners for income tax, and was heard in the Court of Appeal, by Lord Denning M.R (Master of the Rolls)., Buckley and Orr L.JJ. They decided in favour of the Special Commissioners, and so Oppenheimer now had orders to pay tax on his pensions.Oppenheimer v Cattermole and Notham v Cooper Transcript [1972] EWCA Civ J0720-3 In Lord Denning's view when Oppenheimer assumed his United Kingdom nationality in 1948 it was impossible for him to retain his German nationality because nationality and allegiance go hand in hand and a person cannot owe allegiance to two countries which are at war with each other. Lord Denning stated that it was for English law to determine the nationality in this case. He also made reference to Russell J. in Stoeck v. Public Trustee [1921] 2 Ch. 67, 82:\\"Whether a person is a national of a country must be determined by the municipal law of that country. Upon this I think all text writers are agreed.\\" Lord Cross of Chelsea, see below, did not agree with this assessment. Judgment in the House of Lords The court of final appeal in 1976 was the House of Lords, and the case was heard by Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone, Lord Hodson, Lord Pearson, Lord Cross of Chelsea and Lord Salmon. The appeal to the House of Lords was dismissed.http://uniset.ca/naty/maternity/oppenheimer.htmlOppenheimer v Cattermole and Nothman v Cooper [1976] AC 249; [1972] 3 WLR 815; [1975] 2 WLR 347; (1975) 72 ILR 446 All Lords agreed with Lord Cross of Chelsea who ordered in the following terms: Precedents applied In all hearings it was contended on behalf of Oppenheimer that on the authority of Rex v Home Secretary, ex parte L. [1945] 1 K.B. 7, and Lowenthal v Attorney General [1948] 1 All E.R. 295, Oppenheimer's purported loss of German citizenship under the decree of 1941 could not be recognised by English courts and that irrespective of German law, under English law he remained a German national after 25 November 1941 on the grounds that English law did not recognise a change of nationality by a decree of a foreign enemy state in wartime, and English law would not give effect, as far as it related to matters in England, to a penal and confiscatory decree of a foreign country. It was thus a decision based on a mixture of public policy and morality. Outcome \\"... the decision turned ultimately upon an issue which the English courts treat as a question of fact, namely the appellant's nationality in German law.\\"International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol 4, No 24, Oct 1975, page 617.

Oppenheimer v. Cattermole - The Curtain Falls; Merrills, J. G.

He participated in World War II and fought in a number of significant battles in the Pacific Theater, including the Battle of Okinawa. From May 1961 to January 1963, Watson served as Commandant of Berlin and commanded American military forces there when construction of the Berlin Wall began. A major diplomatic incident occurred when members of Watson's staff were refused access to East Berlin. Riots also broke out during his tenure following the death of Peter Fechter. From 1964 to 1965, Watson filled the position of Commissioner of the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands. He increased Ryuku autonomy but ultimately spoke against the significant lessening of American administration authority in the Ryukyus. Watson received two Army Distinguished Service Medals during his career. Personal life Watson was born on January 5, 1909, and grew up in Mount Vernon, Illinois. His father was an army colonel and his grandfather, Albert Watson, was a member of the Supreme Court of Illinois. His family raised him Episcopalian and he remained so throughout his life. Watson married Anne Dunlap Bucher and had two children with her: Albert Watson III and John B. Watson. Both of his sons attended military schools in Pennsylvania. He became reasonably fluent in German while serving in the country. His hobbies included playing tennis and golf. The Berlin press also noted that he enjoyed horseback riding, bridge, light opera, and mystery novels. Syracuse University holds the collection of his writings in their Special Collections Research Center. Military career Watson graduated from the United States Army Field Artillery School as part of the 1934–1935 class. Watson both graduated from and served as a member of the faculty at the United States Army War College. At the college he taught strategy, tactics, and geopolitics. Watson participated in Operations Reckless and Persecution, the Battle of Leyte, and the Battle of Okinawa during World War II. He served mainly with the Tenth Army in New Guinea. Afterward he served as the Director of Personnel Plans in the Office of Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel. He also fought in the Korean War. Watson commanded the United States Third Army from 1963 to 1964. He also commanded two infantry divisions stationed in West Germany, including the 24th Infantry Regiment. Upon retiring he had reached the rank of lieutenant general. Commandant of Berlin Watson was Commandant of Berlin as a major general from May 5, 1961, to January 2, 1963. In this position he fulfilled many roles, reporting to Ambassador Walter C. Dowling in a diplomatic role, General Lauris Norstad in a military role, and communicated directly to the United States Department of State through United States mission head E. Allan Lightner, Jr. He received his first Army Distinguished Service Medal during his years as commandant. Construction of the Berlin Wall began during his tenure as commandant. In a show of defiance regarding a portion of the Wall set up there, Watson was ordered to set up a military presence in the Steinstücken enclave and sent continuing helicopter flights to the contested area. Tank showdowns would also take place in the wall's early years. A small diplomatic incident occurred when Watson cancelled an appointment with the Soviet Commandant of East Berlin, Soloviev. East German border guards, whose authority the United States did not recognize, denied access to his two aides and his interpreter after they did not show papers at the border despite being in an official army car and the American insistence that only Soviet officials could demand that American military show identification; this prompted Watson to turn around and send protest to the Soviets instead of meeting with them. Ironically, the meeting had in part been called to discuss the barring of an American official's entry into East Berlin less than a week earlier. Watson responded by blocking Soloviev and his chief political adviser from entering the American sector. A second diplomatic crisis occurred when Soviet official P. V. Signaov refused to meet with Watson over the latter's refusal to stop West German youth from throwing stones at East German buses. He also dealt with the Peter Fechter incident and the riots that followed Fechters murder. Commissioner of the Ryukyu Islands Watson became Commissioner of the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands on August 1, 1964. The State Department originally intended General Charles H. Bonesteel III for the role; when Bonesteel proved unable to fill the position due to failing eyesight, they offered Watson the job instead. In August 1965, Watson received Prime Minister of Japan Eisaku Satō, becoming the first Commissioner of the islands to meet with a Japanese head of government. Watson also greatly increased the amount of aid that Japan was allowed to give to the islands far above the figures that his predecessors had allowed. He made attempts to improve relations between the American military and Ryukyu legislature. He expanded autonomy and Japanese involvement to an extent and expressed a more lenient attitude to the residents of the island chain. However, he refused to give up United States administrative rights to the island, stating that doing so would lower troop mobility and threaten national security. Despite a promising start, Watson continued the trend of his predecessor and practiced a tumultuous relationship with United States Ambassador to Japan, Edwin O. Reischauer. The two accused each other of keeping the other out of the loop and breaking agreements. He received a second Army Distinguished Service Medal at the end of his term as commissioner.

It receives a large number of visitors and exerts a pivotal influence in the country's economy. Both multinational and Brazilian companies, such as Google, Oi, and Fiat maintain offices or headquarters in the city. The service sector plays a very important role in the economy of Belo Horizonte, being responsible for 85% of the city's gross domestic product (GDP), with industry making up for most of the remaining 15%. Belo Horizonte has a developed industrial sector, being traditionally a hub of the Brazilian siderurgical and metallurgical industries, as the state of Minas Gerais has traditionally been rich in minerals. Belo Horizonte is the distribution and processing center of a rich agricultural and mining region and the nucleus of a burgeoning industrial complex. Production is centred on steel, steel products, automobiles, and textiles. Gold, manganese, and gem stones mined in the surrounding region are processed in the city. The main industrial district of the city was set during the 1940s in Contagem, a part of greater Belo Horizonte. Multinational companies like FIAT (which opened its plant in Betim in 1974), Arcelor, and Toshiba have subsidiaries in the region, along with other textile, cosmetic, food, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, furnishing and refractory companies. Between the companies headquartered in the city we can list siderurgicals Açominas (held by Gerdau, one of the largest multinationals originated in Brazil); Usiminas; Belgo-Mineira (held by Arcelor); Acesita (partially held by Arcelor); mobile communication Vivo; and Telecom Italia Mobile, as well as the NYSE-listed electrical company CEMIG. Leading steel product makers Sumitomo Metals of Japan and Vallourec of France have also plans to construct an integrated steel works on the outskirts of the city. There are also a large number of small enterprises in the technological sector with regional to nationwide success, particularly in the fields of computing and biotechonology. Because of both governmental and private funding in the diversification of its economy, the city has become an international reference in Information Technology and Biotechnology, and is also cited because of the advanced corporate and university research in Biodiesel fuel. The number of jobs in the Information sector has been growing at annual rates above 50%. The Belo Horizonte Metropolitan Area, composed of 33 cities under the capital's direct influence, is home to 16% of the country's biotechnology companies, with annual sales of over R$550 million. Projects in these fields are likely to expand because of integration between universities, the oil company Petrobras and the Brazilian Government. One of the largest events that ever took place in the city, the Inter-American Development Bank meeting, occurred in 2005 and attracted people from everywhere in the world. For a long time it was marked by the predominance of its industrial sector, but from the 1990s there has been a constant expansion of the service sector economy, particularly in computer science, biotechnology, business tourism, fashion and the making of jewelry. The city is considered to be a strategic leader in the Brazilian economy. The move towards business tourism transformed the capital into a national hub for this segment of the tourist industry. * In 2008, the city's GDP was R$42 billion (or about of US$26,2 billion). * In 2008, the Greater Belo Horizonte's GDP was R$98,5 billion (or about of US$61 billion). * In 2008, the city's per capita income was R$17,313 (or US$10,820). In 2007, it was R$15,830 (about of US$9,893). The network in Belo Horizonte accounted for 7.2% of GDP in 2002 and came to 7.6% in 2006. The GDP per capita of the network was R $6,624 in 2002 and changed to R $10,638 in 2006, below the national level. The GDP per capita in the city of Belo Horizonte, who heads the network, it remained higher than the network, but with lower growth in the period, R $9,077 in 2002 and R $13,636 in 2006.

The parasitophorous vacuole itself is surrounded by a single membrane but towards the intestinal lumen it is also covered by the cell membrane. Sporogony takes place outside the fish or intercellularly. The wall of the sporocyst opens at its apex through a round pore.

Course of events The fire started around at one o'clock in the night, in the home of a carpenter in a wooden building within the city block west of the street Dronningens gate. The wind was blowing from the north, and within one hour five houses were set on fire. Within three hours buildings east of Dronningens gate started burning. This block had many old wooden houses, and the whole block was soon on fire and burned down completely except for one building. An important task for the firefighters was to prevent the fire from spreading southwards across the street Prinsens gate. A fire engine pump from the fortress was placed here, and the crew managed to stop it spreading further southwards. Somewhat unexpectedly the fire jumped across the wide street of Kirkegaten. Some of the buildings collapsed rather quickly, and two of the firefighters perished during those events. To the east, crew from the ship Lindesnes managed to prevent the fire from crossing the street Skippergaten. After great efforts the firefighters succeeded in stopping the fire from spreading north and westwards across the streets Kongens gate and Østre gate. Outcome bazaar halls burned down in 1858. The old firewatch building is seen behind to the left. Eventually the whole block between the streets Prinsens gate, Kirkegaten, Østre gate and Dronningens gate was destroyed. Also nearly all buildings of the block east of Dronningens gate burned down, as well as large parts of the block west of Kirkegaten. A total of 41 buildings burned down.Hammer 1923: p. 431 Based on the census from 1855, the number of persons living within the destroyed area was 808. Adding an assumed extra number due to later development, it was estimated in contemporary newspaper reports that about 1,000 persons lost their homes due to the fire.Hammer 1923: p. 432 The number of livestock numbered to 38 horses and eight cows in 1855, and was presumed to be of the same order in 1858, although no specific report is available. Large quantities of household contents and goods had been saved from the burning houses, much of it assembled at the market place. Aftermath The fire had a definite impact on decisions regarding the future of the city. Funding for a new water supply was decided four weeks after the fire. This included a new dam at Maridalsoset, the outlet of Maridalsvannet. The old piping system of the city was made of linked pine logs with drilled holes. The new water pipelines were based on cast iron. The old water pumps at the crossroads disappeared, and households got tap water installed. Also, the fire department of the city was eventually reorganized.

Franco, presenting himself to world opinion as the defender of the Church, was greatly displeased at criticism levelled against him by some European Catholics who condemned not only the murders of priests in the Republican zone, but also those of workers and peasants in the nationalist zone. Nearly all the Spanish bishops had spoken publicly in favour of the insurrection but this was insufficient for Franco. On 10 May 1937, Franco asked Isidro Goma y Tomas to promulgate \\"a text, addressed to bishops the world over with a request that it be published by the Catholic press everywhere, which would set out truth clearly and in proper perspective\\" (from a letter, Goma to Eugenio Pacelli, 12 May 1937). Goma immediately set to work on the propagandistic statement aimed at international Catholic opinion.Chapter Six, The Collective letter , Gunpowder and Incense, Hilari Raguer, Routledge The letter carried the date 1 July 1937 but was not made available to a wide public until August because time was wanted both to obtain the signatures of a small number of bishops who withheld their assent to the letter, and also to ensure that bishops all over the world, to whom the letter was addressed, received it before the press revealed its contents. The letter was edited by Goma with some alterations by Enrique Pla y Deniel, Bishop of Salamanca, and additions from Eijo Garay, Bishop of Madrid-Alcala. The letter calls the Civil War an \\"armed plebiscite\\" and discusses the meaning of the armed conflict - its description of the killings of priests and nuns, \\"was to have the strongest impact upon the recipients\\". Goma gave enthusiastic support to Franco - though he warned against the danger of Nazi influence - \\"the effect on the State of a foreign ideology which tends to draw us away from Christian ideas and influences, will create enormous problems when grafting a new Spain\\". Non-signatories Forty-three bishops and five chapterhouse vicars signed the letter. Five bishops did not sign the letter - though they were not equally significant. *Francisco Vidal y Barraquer the Cardinal Archbishop of Tarragona, the most significant non-signer, was in exile in Italy in 1937 - and was never allowed to return to Spain. In January 1939 Franco's ambassador to the Holy See informed the Cardinal of Tarragona he would not be allowed to return to his diocese - the principal accusation against him was that he had not signed the Collective Letter. Vidal believed that in the fratricidal war in progress the Church should not identify itself with either of the two sides but work hard for pacification. *Torres Ribas, the Bishop of Menorca, very old, half blind, and out of contact in an island under Republican dominion. *Cardinal Segura, in Rome, - Goma did not request his signature since he was the resigned Archbishop of Toledo. *Javier de Irastorza Loinaz, Bishop of Orihuela-Alicante - had been ordered to reside outside his diocese since 1935. *Mateo Mugica Urrestarazu - the Bishop of Vitoria - distressed by the number of the priests, nuns, monks and Catholic faithful that the Nationalists had massacred, would not sign a document which commended the manner in which Francoist repression operated. In a letter to the Holy See in June 1937 Mugica said; \\" According to the Spanish episcopate, justice is well administered in Franco's Spain, and this is simply not true. I possess long lists of fervent Christians and exemplary priests who have been murdered with impunity and without trial or any legal formality.\\" Raguer, p.145 *A sixth bishop, Justi Guitart i Vilardebo, Bishop of Urgel nearly did not sign. Goma insisted \\"in terms that were unmistakably menacing\\", telling the bishop that though Mugica and Vidal both had special motives for withholding their signatures, the unanimity of the others was \\"guarantee enough that we are not going down the wrong road\\". Guitart rejected this and similar threats from Goma. He finally agreed to sign because Vidal y Barraquer agreed he should do so.Raguer, p.112-113 Limitations of the letter Alvarez Bolado, a writer on the religious factor in the Civil War, highlighted four limitations of the letter ; *1:The trivialization of the social conflict - Goma too easily absolves the Spanish Church of the accusation that, in common with the rich, it forgot the poor and that electorally the Church had identified itself with the Right, which opposed social reform, and, when it won the elections in 1933, repealed the best of the moderate changes that had been brought in 1931-1933. *2:The simplification of the Basque problem. *3:An absence of a democratic sensibility in politics. It was too simplistic to categorize the Republican side as Communists, while the praise bestowed on the Franco side revealed Goma's ties with the ultra-rightist group Accion Espanola.Raguer, p.115. Note:The martirologio of the diocesan archivist Josep Sanabre, referring to the situation in Barcelona, remarked that from September 1936 priests and religious generally received only prison sentences, and that after the events of May 1937, when the Anarchists lost power \\"it is indisputable that the assassinations of our companions, the priests, came to a stop\\" and the majority of the priests held in prison, were released.(Raguer, p.128) The writer George Orwell observed that in 1937 the Communists were responsible for imprisoning, not Fascists but revolutionaries [-]\\"Communism is now a counter-revolutionary force\\"; \\" the anticlerical movement, in its violent form, is a popular movement and a native Spanish movement. It has its roots not in Marx or Bakunin, but in the condition of the Spanish people themselves.\\" *4:Insufficiency and concealment of information concerning repression in the nationalist zone - \\"the gravest defect of the document\\" Raguer, p. 115-116  References  External links * Full text in translation of the Collective Letter of the Spanish Bishops Category:1930s in Spain Category:Spanish Civil War Category:Catholic Church in Spain Category:1937 in Spain Category:1937 documents ","title":"Collective Letter of the Spanish Bishops, 1937"},{"id":"34414483","text":"The Chismon Collection is a collection of Croatian philatelic material formed by Harvey John Chismon and given to the British Library by his son Joseph Chismon in 2009.

Such a quarterback is seen as a major factor in neither his team's wins nor their losses; his performance is good enough to not negatively affect the performances of other players on his team, even if he himself does not have the skills to be considered an elite player. Game managers often benefit from strong defense and rushing offense on their teams. Arizona Sports said that \\"game manager\\" was \\"a term that often comes with negative connotations of a non-talented, play-it-safe type of quarterback\\". The New York Times called it a \\"backhanded compliment\\". The San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"As consolation ...

History DealDash was founded in 2009 by William Wolfram, a 16-year-old Finnish entrepreneur, who had lost $20 bidding unsuccessfully for a MacBook on an earlier penny auction site. Wolfram had generated approximately $500,000 in affiliate sales a year earlier buying popular YouTube videos for $50, borrowed from his mother, then collecting revenue from affiliate marketing links he would add. He used the money he had saved to start DealDash. The company's business model, as with prior sites, is that customers enter a bidding process where they pay for each bid on an item, regardless of whether they succeed or not. Each bid marginally increases the price of the item until the end of the auction, at which point the item is sold to the final bidder. DealDash differs from predecessors mainly in that losing bidders are given an option to apply money they had spent unsuccessfully bidding on an item towards purchasing the item at a posted retail price. DealDash obtained early financing from a youth program of Tekes, a Finnish public funding agency. It later raised approximately $1.5 to $2 million in venture financing from the Chief Executive Officers of Rovio Entertainment (publisher of Angry Birds) and Carbonite. The company grew quickly, quadrupling its revenue yearly for its first three years. As of early 2012 it was earning $1 million profits on $44 million revenue. By 2013 it had 67 employees, yearly revenues approaching $100 million, and was ranked as Finland's second-most visible startup based on attention from media, bloggers, influencers, and users. According to Socialbakers, DealDash was the most talked about brand on Facebook's \\"People Talking About This\\" during a period in May 2013, and had the highest engagement rate that September. In 2013, when Wolfram was still 20 years old, DealDash moved its headquarters from Helsinki, Finland to Minneapolis, Minnesota. In August of that year, the company also created the site DealDashReviewed.com to house and aggregate reviews and testimonials from their customers. Business model DealDash, like other auction sites, has been described as a gamified approach to e-commerce. To participate, registered bidders first buy \\"bids\\" priced at $0.60 each, that they may spend bidding on auctions. Standard auctions begin with an opening price of $0.00, with every bid placed increasing the price by $0.01 and removing one paid \\"bid credit\\" from the user's balance. Bidders may choose to place single bids, by manually clicking the bid button, or through an automatic bidding tool called the \\"BidBuddy\\". An auction clock restarts from a maximum of 10–30 seconds, depending on the auction, every time a bid is placed. If no new bids are placed before the clock runs out, the last and highest bidder is declared the winner of the auction. Criticism DealDash has been criticized for offering poor value to customers and for making disclosures only in fine print. Penny auction sites, including DealDash specifically, have often been criticized for failing to disclose or include the cost of bids in what customers actually spend in total to win a product. In a conventional auction, bids are based on prices that participants are willing to pay, with the item sold to the final bidder within a set period that bids the highest price. This usually allocates the item to the person who is willing to pay the most. By contrast, penny auctions award items to parties that are persistent or lucky enough to place the final bid, with money raised primarily from the cost of bidding rather than the final price of the item. In most cases, users spend substantial sums of money without winning anything. DealDash and others have been compared to gambling by consumer groups. According to Consumer Reports, the \\"buy it now\\" prices can be significantly higher than the same products on Amazon.com. Unsuccessful bidders not using the option lose the value of the bids placed. A company spokesperson says DealDash generates significant business from bidders who choose to buy items after losing, with hundreds of orders processed daily. Consumer Reports also reported that many “luxury” brands touted on Deal Dash are non-existent beyond the website and their trademarks are registered by the owner of DealDash, through another company that he is associated with, namely Galton Voysey.https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/customer-accuses-dealdash- of-selling-cheap-generic-products-disguised-as-independent-luxury-brands/ Consumer organization Truth in Advertising reported that a DealDash television commercial shows \\"Roseanna\\" winning a $349 kitchen mixer for \\"less than $25\\". Small print explains she bid 761 times on that mixer, which cost her over $456, plus the $25 \\"price\\" she won it for. This means she paid closer to $481 - well over the stated $349 retail price. Both Truth in Advertising and Consumer Reports noted that DealDash's own terms of service tell users that they are likely to spend more than the retail cost for products and are unlikely to save money using the site.

The film revolves around an aging baseball scout whose daughter joins him on a scouting trip. Filming began in March 2012, and the film was released on September 21, 2012. This was Eastwood's first acting project since 2008's Gran Torino and his first acting role in a film he did not direct since his cameo in 1995's Casper. A year after its release the film became the subject of a plagiarism lawsuit by a producer alleging that his former partner had taken an unfinished script after a dispute and conspired with his agent and Warner Brothers to present it as the work of a relative unknown.  Plot  An aging Atlanta Braves baseball scout, Gus Lobel (Eastwood), is given one last assignment to prove his value to the organization, who views him as unable to adapt to changes within the game, especially advanced statistical analysis. His boss and friend Pete (Goodman) does not want to see him let go, but he must contend with an ambitious junior executive, Phillip Sanderson (Lillard), who is trying to get a promotion to the team's general manager post and wants Gus fired as an obstacle to his own baseball philosophy and methods. Pete suspects Gus is hiding problems with his health, so against Gus's wishes, Pete contacts Gus's daughter Mickey (Adams), a workaholic lawyer pursuing a partnership at her firm, to join her father on a scouting trip to North Carolina. Gus is to review a top prospect named Bo Gentry, a brash amateur whose gaudy statistics make him a likely top draft pick. Mickey realizes that Gus's vision is failing and starts to take an active role in his work to make up for his shortcoming. Along the way, Gus reconnects with a former player he once scouted, Johnny \\"The Flame\\" Flanagan (Timberlake), who is now a scout for the Boston Red Sox, and who takes an interest in Mickey. The Red Sox have the top pick in the draft, just ahead of the Braves, and Johnny is also scouting Bo Gentry. When Mickey questions Gus about his leaving her with an uncle she barely knew as a child, after her mother's passing, Gus explains to Mickey that he had taken her with him on a scouting trip when he saw a man molest her, and he believed that he was not going to be able to protect Mickey the way he properly should. Mickey tells him that keeping her away was worse and that her other relationships suffer because of it. She then walks away, leaving Gus frustrated. As Gus and Mickey watch Bo play with other scouts present, they use Gus's hearing and Mickey's sight to determine that Bo has difficulty hitting a curveball. Gus advises Johnny to pass on Bo in the draft, and Johnny takes his advice. However, when Gus calls Pete and the Braves' management with the same advice, Phillip disagrees based on his statistical analysis and stakes his career on his opinion, leading Braves general manager Vince (Patrick) to draft Bo against Gus's advice. When Johnny learns of the move, he believes that Gus and Mickey double-crossed him to allow the Braves to draft Bo instead and angrily leaves. Gus abandons Mickey at the hotel. She hears a pitcher throwing outside her room, and realizes he is talented just from the sound. She approaches the young man, Rigoberto, and volunteers to catch for him. After seeing him throw a few curveballs, she calls Pete, who reluctantly agrees to have him attend a tryout in Atlanta. Gus returns to the Braves' office where Vince and Phillip criticize him for his evaluation of Bo. Pete interrupts to let them know that Mickey has brought Rigo to the field. As Bo practices batting, Phillip mocks Gus and Mickey for bringing in Rigo, an unknown. Bo remembers Rigo selling peanuts at a high school game, and also mocks him. Mickey insists, however, that they allow Rigo to pitch. Rigo throws several fastballs, which Bo repeatedly misses. Mickey calls for Rigo to throw his curve, and again Bo cannot connect with the ball on three straight attempts. The staff realize they were wrong about both Bo and Gus. The management resume their meeting, intent on signing Rigo. Gus suggests Mickey could be Rigo's sports agent, due to her legal background and knowledge of the game. When Phillip makes another snide remark towards Gus, Vince fires him and offers Gus a contract extension. Mickey then gets a partnership offer from her firm. Outside the stadium, Mickey and Gus find Johnny waiting. Mickey approaches him and they kiss while Gus lights a cigar and walks away.

Box Office Mojo. Retrieved on 2013-07-13.). Plagiarism lawsuit A year after the film's release, another producer, Ryan Brooks, filed a lawsuit in federal district court against Warner, the producers, two talent agencies, screenwriter Brown and Don Handfield, an actor and former partner of Brooks. He alleged copyright infringement and conspiracy, claiming the produced screenplay of the film bore striking similarities to Omaha, an unproduced screenplay he had commissioned from Handfield that had as its main character an older college baseball coach working through a difficult relationship with his grown daughter, as well as other plot elements. Brooks, a former minor league baseball player himself, claimed that Handfield took the unfinished Omaha script with him after the two had a falling out over a rewrite. Handfield then, Brooks claims, conspired with Charles Ferraro, his agent at United Talent, to present it—with minor alterations such as changing the setting from college baseball to the major leagues—as the work of Brown, a fellow client of Ferraro with only two minor credits to his name who had primarily worked as a musician. Brooks' suit claimed that Brown's interviews to promote the film seemed rehearsed and frustrating to interviewers trying to understand how he created the film, and questioned how an unknown writer in his fifties managed to land the well- connected Ferraro as an agent. All the named defendants who spoke to the media about the claims, including Brown, denied and derided them. Warner responded with a letter to Brooks' lawyer threatening serious legal actions in response if he did not withdraw the \\"reckless and false\\" complaint within a week. Attached to it was a draft of the Trouble with the Curve script, credited to Brown, that had purportedly been optioned by another production company in 1998. Brooks' lawyer questioned its authenticity to The New York Times suggesting that it bore signs of fabrication, such as the anachronistic use of wireless laptops, and that there was no record of it having been registered with the Writers' Guild of America, a common practice for screenwriters establishing authorship of their work before getting a production company interested. Lawyers for the studio responded with a motion for summary judgement in their favor and presented evidence that they claimed proved Brown had written the first drafts of the script as early as 1996, including an affidavit from a computer forensics expert authenticating the timestamps on a floppy disk containing those early drafts. Brooks' lawyers called all of the evidence of earlier creation forged or tampered with, in addition to calling attention to anachronistic passages in those purported earlier drafts. In February 2014 Dale S. Fischer, the judge hearing the case, granted the motion, saying that Brooks had overstated the similarities between the two scripts and that, even if he hadn't, \\"the idea of a father-daughter baseball story is not protectable as a matter of copyright law.\\" Two months later Fischer dismissed the remaining claims under federal law, but said claims under state law could still be filed in state court. Brooks appealed her decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and in October refiled the case in Los Angeles County Superior Court. This time he alleged only breach of contract and did not name either Warner or Eastwood as defendants, as he had in the original claim. He demanded $5 million in damages. Home media Trouble with the Curve was released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 18, 2012.

When the British invaded Iceland in 1940, people gathered on the streets to see the troops and the fact that many young Icelandic girls were captivated by them did not go unnoticed. Immediately discussions began over what effect this would have and minimal interaction with British forces was encouraged, but this proved to be difficult as many Icelanders had jobs in some way connected to the troops. A committee was formed which produced a damning report on the soldiers, which shed light on widespread prostitution amongst the troops. Some sources suggested that girls as young as twelve years old were involved in prostitution. The Icelandic authorities tried unsuccessfully to reduce the soldiers' encounters with Icelandic girls but with time the issue lapsed and was no longer part of the current affairs. The soldiers went home with the conclusion of the war in 1945. US troops returned to Iceland in 1951 as part of the Iceland Defense Force during the Cold War. In order to reassure Icelandic authorities, the troops were quarantined in the Keflavík Air Base, which remained in operation until 2006.

In 1938, Oregon voters, by a three-to-one margin, approved an initiative to regulate water pollution and to create an enforcement agency under the jurisdiction of the Oregon State Board of Health. Political pressure that led to the initiative had begun as early as the 1920s, when the Board of Health, the U.S. Public Health Service, the Izaak Walton League, and others had expressed concerns about water pollution and its threats to human health. Pollution had caused many fish kills on the Willamette River in the 1920s, and Portland, on the lower river, had often closed its part of the Willamette to swimming because of sewage in the water. Since many of the biggest polluters were along the Willamette, OSSA focused its efforts there. Raw domestic sewage from cities and wastes from pulp mills, paper mills, and other industrial sites produced the greatest volumes of pollutants. By the late 1940s, OSSA had induced communities along the river to install sewage treatment plants. However, the agency had less success with mill owners, who resisted pollution controls on grounds of the expense. Of particular concern were sulfite process mills that discharged plumes of waste that were deadly to many aquatic plants and animals. As late as 1969, low oxygen levels related to pollution were preventing upstream migration of salmon on the Willamette. The fish were able to continue only after Governor Tom McCall, the OSSA chairman, ordered the temporary closure of four sulfite mills along the river. In 1969, the Oregon Legislative Assembly replaced OSSA with the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). Its responsibilities include protecting the state's air quality as well as its water quality; managing solid- and hazardous-waste disposal; helping with contamination cleanup, and enforcing the state's environmental laws.

Zgromadzenie Przyjaciół Konstytucji Rządowej (in English, also variously rendered as Association of Friends of the (Governing) Constitution, Society of Friends of the Government Ordinance, Society of Friends of the Constitution, Assembly of Friends of the Government Constitution) was the first modern Polish political party (with a charter and organizational discipline), formed in May 1791, shortly after the adoption of the Constitution of May 3, 1791, by the efforts of the Patriotic Party. The purpose of the Friends of the Constitution was to defend the reformed political system and to introduce further reforms.\\"Zgromadzenie Przyjaciół Konstytucji Rządowej\\" (\\"Society of Friends of the Constitution\\"), Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN, vol.4, Warsaw, Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1976, p. 785.

The Friends of the Constitution had their own charter and organizational discipline and have been described as the first modern political party in Poland. Since many of the party's members participated in the Sejm's (parliament's) deliberations, the Friends of the Constitution have also been described as the first Polish parliamentary caucus. Members were also active outside the Sejm and enjoyed support among many segments of society, from szlachta (nobility) salons to more radical, Jacobin-influenced bourgeois circles. The first meeting of the Friends of the Constitution took place on 21 May 1791. Their charter declared their support for the May 3 Constitution, and their aim of perfecting the Constitution and the polity that it served. The party numbered at least 213 members whose names are known to history, including those of 126 deputies and 14 senators. Most of the members were of the szlachta, but at least 7 were townsmen. The charter stipulated that all members were equal. Decisions were taken by majority vote. Many members had connections with the Patriotic Party. Prominent members included: Deputy Chancellor of the Crown Hugo Kołłątaj, Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, Prince Józef Poniatowski, Marcin Badeni, Franciszek Barss, Joachim Chreptowicz, Jan August Cichocki, Ignacy Dembiński, Ignacy Działyński, Ksawery Działyński, Antoni Dzieduszycki, Augustyn Gorzeński, Paweł Jerzy Grabowski, Ludwik Szymon Gutakowski, Janusz Stanisław Iliński, Michał Kochanowski, Stanisław Kublicki, Jan Paweł Łuszczewski, Antoni Madaliński, Józef Andrzej Mikorski, Mikołaj Morawski, Tadeusz Mostowski, Adam Naruszewicz, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Józef Kajetan Ossoliński, Tomasz Adam Ostrowski, Scipione Piattoli, Grzegorz Piramowicz, Ignacy Potocki, Stanisław Kostka Potocki, Józef Ignacy Rybiński, Walenty Sobolewski, Stanisław Sołtan, Stanisław Sołtyk, Michał Strasz, Józef Weyssenhoff, Mikołaj Wolski, Ignacy Wyssogota Zakrzewski. The founding members of the Friends of the Constitution included King Stanisław August Poniatowski's Italian secretary, Scipione Piattoli, who appears in the above list of prominent members. Notable absentees included the King himself (a co-author of the Constitution of May 3, 1791) and Stanisław Małachowski, the Marshal of the Great Sejm, both of whom preferred to maintain a semblance of political neutrality. The party's meetings were generally held at the Radziwiłł Palace — now the Presidential Palace — on Warsaw's Krakowskie Przedmieście, a few minutes' walk from the Royal Castle. The Friends of the Constitution were active until the Commonwealth's defeat in the War in Defense of the Constitution and the demise of the May 3 Constitution.

These Computer Inquiries created rules and requirements designed to prevent cross subsidization, discrimination, and anti-competitive behavior from companies such as Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) to enter the enhanced services market. Background In the 1960s, The Federal Communications Commission (\\"FCC\\" or \\"Commission\\") awoke to the reality of powerful computers running communications networks, and communications networks over which humans interacted with really powerful computers. In 1966, the FCC was interested in the difference between computers that facilitate communications and computers with which people communicate. The Commission had to make a decision on whether both of these types of computers should be regulated as a basic phone service. \\"The task before the Commission was the nature and extent of the regulatory jurisdiction to be applied to data processing services; and whether, under what circumstances, and subject to what conditions or safeguards, common carriers should be permitted to engage in data processing.\\"Reg. and Policy Problems Presented by the Interdependence of Computer and Communications Services, Tentative Decision, 28 FCC2d 291, 18 Rad. Reg.2d (P & F) 1713 (1970). To answer these questions, the Commission launched the first Computer Inquiry.In re Regulatory & Policy Problems Presented by the Interdependence of Computer and Communication Services & Facilities, Notice of Inquiry, 7 FCC 2d 11, para. 25 (1966) Computer I In the 1960s the FCC faced a problem with existing regulated communication networks, such as AT&T; who offered basic communication service. Companies such as AT&T; had found a way to add computers to the ends of these existing networks by layering protocols on top of the network to achieve data processing. These enhancements if left unregulated threatened growth of these services. In 1970, the FCC made its first attempt at dividing the computer world into two categories: computers that ran communication networks and computers at the end of telephone lines that people interacted. \\"The division was technological, focused on computer processing, attempting to divide the difference between circuit or message switching and data processing.\\"Second Computer Inquiry, Final Decision, 77 FCC2d 384, para. 19, 47 Rad. Reg.2d (P & F) 669 (1980) This division by the Commission were either called \\"pure communications\\" or \\"pure data processing.\\"Delbert D. Smith, The Interdependence of Computer and Communications Services and Facilities: A Question of Federal Regulation, 1117 U. Pa. L. Rev. 829 (1969). p 203  Pure Communications/Pure Data Processing/Hybrid cases  If a message is sent from one location to another and it does not change, the FCC defined it as Pure Communication. On the other hand, if a changes or processing happen at the end of phone line the FCC defined it as Pure Data Processing. In pure data processing the computer processes the information and determines if it is a circuit or message-switching. Also, in pure data processing the computer processes the information by using storing, retrieving, sorting, merging or calculating data functions based on how the computer is programmed. Some computer processing, however, use both pure communication and pure data processing. The FCC was not too sure how to handle these situations and created a third category known as hybrids. Hybrid cases were considered a gray area and the FCC planned to resolve these gray services on case-by-case basis.Reg. and Policy Problems Presented by the Interdependence of Computer and Communications Services, Final Decision, 28 FCC2d 267, 21 Rad. Reg.2d (P & F) 1561 (1971) p. 31-38 The FCC determined if there is more communications, then it was communications; if it was more data processing, then it was data processing. Hybrid cases became Computer Inquires I's undoing as it did not clearly define pure and data communications.  Regulations  Pure communications and pure data processing have very different characteristics that led to different policy results. The markets that the technology existed on assisted the FCC make its policy decisions. \\"The pure data processing market was viewed as an innovative, competitive market with low barriers to entry and little chance of monopolization.\\" The FCC established that no additional regulation or safeguards where required for the pure data processing market. The pure communications market on the other hand was being managed by an incumbent monopoly. The FCC had four concerns about the incumbent telephone companies which were: \\"the sale of data processing services by carriers should not hurt the provision of common carrier services, the costs of such data processing services should not be passed on to telephone rate payers, revenues derived from common carrier services should not be used to cross subsidize data processing services, and the furnishing of such data processing services by carriers should not hurt the competitive computer market.\\"  Safeguard: Maximum Separation  With concerns relating to communication facility, the FCC developed its \\"Maximum Separation\\" safeguards. The FCC made it so that if carrier wanted to enter the unregulated data processing market they could only do so by going through a fully separate subsidiary. The separate subsidiary needed to have a separate data processing corporation, accounting books, offices, personnel, equipment, and facilities. The carrier also could not use the separate subsidiary to promote their data processing services, use network computers for non-network purposes, or use network computers during peak hours to provision data processing services. Computer II In 1976, the FCC was astounded by the number of hybrid cases that used both \\"pure communication\\" and \\"pure data processing\\" thus leading to the launch of the Second Computer Inquiry.Second Computer Inquiry, Tentative Decision and Further Notice of Inquiry and Rulemaking, 72 FCC2d 358, paras. 6-7, 17, 45 Rad. Reg.2d (P & F) 1485 (1979) After Computer I took effect, new technological developments in the telecommunications and computer industries exposed flaws in its definitional structure approach to evaluating the \\"hybrid category\\".Amendment of Sections 64.702 of the Comm’n’s Rules and Regs. (Third Computer Inquiry), Report and Order, CC Docket No 85-229, 104 F.C.C.2d 958, 60 Rad. Reg.2d (P & F) 603 (1986) Dumb terminals had become smart, the cost of computer processing units (CPU's) dropped, logical networks overlaying physical networks, and microcomputers made their appearance that set the stage for the scrapping of Computer Inquiry I. The Commission's situation was \\"more complicated\\" and eventually led to the birth of the basic versus enhanced services dichotomy. This established a division between “common carrier transmission services from those computer services which depend on common carrier services in the transmission of information.” Basic versus Enhanced Dichotomy If a carrier offers a pure transmission over a path that is transparent in terms of its interaction with customer supplied information, the FCC considered this to fall into the basic service category.Computer and Comm. Indus. Ass’n v. FCC, 693 F.2d 198 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Basic service includes processing the movement of information and computer processing, which includes protocol conversion, security, and memory storage. The category of basic service is everything from \\"voice telephone calls\\" to a phone company's lease of private lines. If a carrier offers services over common carrier transmission facilities that employ computer processing applications that act on the format, content, code, protocol or similar aspects of the subscriber's transmitted information; provide the subscriber additional, different, or restructured information; or involve subscriber interaction with stored information, the FCC consider this to fall into the enhanced services category. The Commission found that e-mail, voice mail, the World Wide Web, newsgroups, fax store-and-forward, interactive voice response, gateway, audiotext information services, and protocol processing are enhanced services. The FCC did not want to fall into the same trap as they did with Computer Inquiry I and having a hybrid category. They wanted to make sure that every application fell into either the basic or enhanced service. \\"The Commission made the classification dependent upon the nature of the activity involved.\\" The nature of the activity involved would determine if it fell into the communications or data processing service. This changed the process from an examination of the technology to an examination of the service provisioned. To eliminate the hybrid cases in the basic versus enhanced dichotomy the FCC designed a \\"bright-line test\\" The FCC bright-line test defined enhanced services as anything more than the transmission capacity of basic service.\\"Establishment of a Funding Mechanism for Interstate Operator Servs. for the Deaf, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 11 F.C.C.R. 6808, 2 Comm. Reg. (P & F) 744 (1996) A three prong test was also established to test enhanced services. The three prong test \\"employs computer processing applications that: act on the format, content, code, protocol or similar aspects of a subscriber's transmitted information; provide the subscriber additional, different, or restructured information; or involve subscriber interaction with stored information.\\" \\"The enhanced service is layered on top, creating a new service for the edge user.\\" \\"The image the Commission has at this time is of enhanced service providers (“ESPs”) acquiring basic services, adding enhanced services, and then selling the bundled service to consumers on a resale basis.\\" Adjunct Services If a regulated service uses a traditional telephone service and it does not change the fundamental character of the telephone service, the FCC considered it as an Adjunct service.US West Comm., Inc., Petition for Computer III Waiver, Order, 11 F.C.C.R. 1195, 1 para. 2-5 Comm. Reg. (P & F) 1261 (1995) An example of this would be directory assistance. Directory assistance provides a phone number that uses a telephone network. Directory service is characterized as a basic service, which does not transform into an enhanced service. Computer III In 1985, the FCC launched the last phase of regulations, Computer Inquiries III prior to the deployment of the Internet to the consumer. Computer Inquiries II established the basic and enhanced service dichotomy, but Computer Inquiries III kept the policy objectives the same while changing how these services were implemented. The Computer Inquiries III wanted to make sure that the separate subsidiary requirements of Computer Inquiry II did not have additional costs to the public with decreased service and innovation by Bell Operating Companies (BOCS) from using existing regulated operations to benefit from the unregulated enhanced services. The FCC found that the cost of structural separation was more important than not having nonstructural safeguards in place for the Enhanced Service Providers (ESPs) by the BOCs. \\" These separate structural subsidiaries were not required to be set up by the BOCs if they were moving from a structural safeguard to non-structural safeguard. To set up these safeguards the FCC created two non-structural safeguards called the Comparatively Efficient Interconnection (\\"CEI\\") and Open Network Architecture (\\"ONA\\"). Comparatively Efficient Interconnection The BOCs to solve the non-structural separation for entering into enhanced services created a temporary solution called the Comparatively Efficient Interconnection (CEI). The CEI allowed BOCs to enter the enhanced service market on a non-structural basis. This allowed the ESP to integrate with the BOC and the separate subsidiary was no longer needed. Under current rules, the FCC permitted the company to post their CEI plans on the company website.Computer III Further Remand Proceedings: Bell Operating Co. Provision of Enhanced Servs., Order on Reconsideration, 14 F.C.C.R. 21628, para. 6 Comm. Reg. (P & F) 1344 (1999) The following information must be included in the CEI plan: information on interface functionality, unbundling of basic services, resale, technical characteristics, installation, maintenance and repair, end-user access, CEI availability, minimization of transport costs, and recipients of CEI.\\"Computer III Further Remand Proceedings: Bell Operating Co. Provision of Enhanced Servs., Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 13 F.C.C.R. 6040, para. 4, 15 Comm. Reg. (P & F) 2017 (1998) The CEI plans were used to make sure that if a BOC had terms and conditions with an affiliated ESP’s they would provide the same provisions to non-affiliated ESP’s. This was intended to provide ESPs equal access to basic services that the BOCs use to provide their own enhanced service. Open Network Architecture The second safeguard that the FCC introduced required BOCs to break their networks into “basic building blocks” and make those available to ESPs to build new services, which became known as the Open network architecture (ONA) The basic service offering by the BOCs were to be broken apart to help the ESP market. The building blocks would be divided by the BOCs as follows: Basic Service Elements, Basic Serving Arrangements, Complimentary Network Services, and Ancillary Network Services.Computer III Further Remand Proceedings: Bell Operating Company Provision of Enhanced Services; 1998 Biennial Regulatory Review B Review of Computer III and ONA Safeguards and Requirements, Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, CC Docket No. 98-10, 13 FCC Rcd 6040 (Jan 30, 1998) Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Jan 30, 1998) Even if a BOC did not want to enter the ESP market they were required to file with the FCC their ONA plans.Bell Operating Cos.

If the BOCs successfully filed an ONA plan with the Commission, it would then be permitted to provide integrated ESP services without filing a CEI plan.BOC’s Joint Petition, supra note 87, para. 3. Safeguards The Computer Inquiries III provided safeguards that fell upon different entities into the following categories: annual ONA reporting, network information disclosure, cross- subsidization prohibitions, accounting safeguards, and customer proprietary network information. Annual ONA Reporting In 1989, the FCC created a reporting structure that the BOCs are required to file quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports for their ONA that include the following information: \\"annual projected deployment schedules for ONA service, by type of service (BSA, BSE, CNS), in terms of percentage of access lines served system-wide and by market area; disposition of new ONA service requests from ISPs; disposition of ONA service requests that have previously been designated for further evaluation; disposition of ONA service requests that were previously deemed technically infeasible; information on Signaling System 7 (SS7), Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), and Intelligent Network (IN) projected development in terms of percentage of access lines served system-wide and on a market area basis; new ONA services available through SS7, ISDN, and IN; progress in the IILC (now NIIF) on continuing activities implementing service- specific and long-term uniformity issues; progress in providing billing information including Billing Name and Address (BNA), line-side Calling Number Identification (CNI), or possible CNI alternatives, and call detail services to ISPs; progress in developing and implementing Operation Support Systems (OSS) services and ESP access to those services; progress on the uniform provision of OSS services; and a list of BSEs used in the provision of BOC/GTE's own enhanced services.\\"Cybertelecom 2002. Notes: ONA \\"In addition, the BOCs are required to report annually on the unbundling of new technologies arising from their own initiative, in response to requests by ISPs, or resulting from requirements imposed by the Commission.\\" As of February 2011, the FCC to better serve the public interest have temporarily waived the reporting of these ONA reports to eliminate added expenses to the BOCs in preparing these reports. Network Information Disclosure Carriers are required by the FCC to disclosure to the public all information relating to network design and technical standards and information affecting changes to the telecommunications network which would affect either inter-carrier interconnection or the manner in which customer-premises equipment is attached to the interstate network prior to implementation and with reasonable advance notification.47 C.F.R. § 64.702(d)(2) (2001). This information is called Network Information Disclosure and is set in 47 CFR 51.325 through 51.335. These procedures require public notice by the carrier if changes are made to the network that would cause it to be unavailable with another service provider or affect a provider's performance. If network changes are made the carrier must provide references to technical specifications, protocols, and standards regarding the transmission, signal, routing, and facility assignment as well any new technology or equipment that may affect the connection to the consumer. Cross-Subsidization Prohibitions A carrier may not use services not subject to competition to subsidize a service that is subject to competition, if they do the FCC consider it as cross-subsidization prohibitions. An example of this would be a carrier could not fund their Internet services from a noncompetitive local telephone revenue. Accounting Safeguards The FCC created a series of accounting safeguards that can be found in Subpart I of Part 64 of Title 47, Code of Federal Regulations. Annual independent audits are performed to ensure certain carriers are not improperly cross subsidizing their services. The final reports of these independent audits are publicly available and can be obtained by contacting the Accounting Safeguards Division of the FCC’s Common Carrier Bureau. The FCC provides information about Common Carrier account on their ARMIS database on their website.Common Carrier Filing Requirements - Information for Firms Providing Telecommunications Services Customer Proprietary Network Information The FCC needed to create restrictions on BOCs to gather sensitive information from their subscribers. This safeguard to protect subscriber's information has become known as the Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI). The FCC require carriers to provide any customer proprietary network information available to the public on the same terms and conditions of the affiliated ESP if requested.Ameritech's CEI Plan, ¶ 41; GTE ONA, Bell Atlantic's CEI Plan;ONA Review, ¶ 25, 398-447. In 1996, Congress passed the new Privacy of Customer Information provision, codified as Section 222 of the Communications Act.47 U.S.C. § 222. Under this section 222 Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) is defined as \\"information that relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of use of a telecommunications service subscribed to by any customer of a telecommunications carrier, and that is made available to the carrier by the customer solely by virtue of the carrier-customer relationship; and information contained in the bills pertaining to telephone exchange service or telephone toll service received by a customer of a carrier, except that such term does not include subscriber list information.

Shortly after midnight, the plane crashed and burned following a refueling stop in Florida. Background NROTC midshipmen attend civilian colleges during the fall and spring semesters, and spend part of the summer on active-duty training. The summer between their sophomore and junior years was dedicated to aviation and amphibious-warfare training. Half of the midshipmen started training with aviation and the other half started with amphibious- warfare training. After three weeks, a group of military transport aircraft airlifted the midshipmen to the other training location. Transport had been by train through 1952, and 1953 was the first summer during which midshipmen were airlifted between the training locations.Hamilton, Harry D. Signal Charley (2005) pp.16-18 Crash On 17 July 1953, 23 midshipmen from the University of Oklahoma, ten from Rice University, two from the University of Missouri, two from Oregon State University, one from the University of Oregon, one from the University of Utah, and one from the Georgia Institute of Technology were flying aboard United States Marine Corps R4Q Packet BuNo 131663 from Corpus Christi, Texas to Norfolk, Virginia. The plane was the second of five transports making a midnight refueling stop at NAS Whiting Field. The port engine lost power during initial climb following takeoff and the plane hit a clump of trees a mile north of the runway. The plane then destroyed three parked cars and a barn as it crashed and burned. Six injured men were found in the wreckage, but only two midshipmen and one of the 6-man USMC crew survived. Aftermath The accident remains the greatest recorded loss of United States midshipmen in a single event. The crash was the 19th operational loss of a R4Q / C-119 type aircraft. At the time, it was the heaviest loss of life from an accident with that type of aircraft, but two subsequent accidents had higher fatalities. When it occurred, it ranked as the eleventh highest fatality count for an aircraft accident in the United States. Many of the Holloway Plan midshipmen were engineering students; and surviving midshipmen on other planes recalled one of those killed had completed an evaluation of the R4Q aircraft as an exercise and shared his conclusion that the aircraft could not maintain altitude if one engine failed during takeoff with a full load of fuel and cargo. Loss of most of the University of Oklahoma NROTC graduating class of 1955 severely disrupted the NROTC program at that school. Students from all NROTC schools were uniformly distributed among transport aircraft in subsequent summer training programs.

In a career that lasted from May 1839 to July 1841 he ran ten times and won four races. His most important win came on his first racecourse appearance when he won the 1839 Derby. He went on to win important races at Ascot and Liverpool before his retirement after his five-year-old season. He was later exported to stand as a stallion in Germany. Bloomsbury's controversial origins were the subject of two formal objections and a court case which led to a crisis in English racing. Background Bloomsbury was a bay horse described as looking \\"coarse\\" but very powerful, standing 15.3 hands high, bred by Mr Cattle, a farmer from Sheriff Hutton. The colt was sired by Mulatto the winner of the 1827 Doncaster Cup who went on to be a good, but unexceptional sire. Bloomsbury's dam, Arcot Lass, was one of the few mares to produce two Derby winners: her son St. Giles had won the race in 1832. According to one account, the colt was acquired as a foal from his breeder by Robert Ridsdale, a professional gambler with a dubious reputation. When Ridsdale was forced to sell his horses in 1836, no bids were made for a weanling colt by Mulatto and his ownership was transferred to Ridsdale's brother, William, who also trained the horse, later named Bloomsbury, for racing. Ridsdale then sold the colt to Lord Chesterfield. According to another version, he was bought by Lord Chesterfield direct from his breeder as a yearling and then sent to be trained by William Ridsdale. Bloomsbury was certainly recorded as the property of Mr Ridsdale when entries for the 1839 St Leger were published at the start of 1838. The best contemporary account states that Robert Ridsdale had an arrangement with Mr Cattle to buy all the offspring of Arcot Lass. This arrangement was inherited by William Ridsdale who thereby acquired Bloomsbury and sold him to Chesterfield, although the details of the sale were never formally recorded. The exact details of Bloomsbury's breeding and ownership later became the subject of controversy. Racing career 1839: three- year-old season In early 1839 Lord Chesterfield, withdrew the horses he owned from Ridsdale's stable and claimed Bloomsbury as his property. The dispute looked likely to result in Bloomsbury's entry for the Derby being declared void, but the matter was resolved when it was agreed that Chesterfield should be paid compensation for all Bloomsbury's entry fees and forfeits. The money was believed to come from Harry Hill, a bookmaker who stood to win a great deal of money if Bloomsbury won the Derby. The \\"snowstorm\\" finish of the 1839 Derby, by James Pollard. Bloomsbury was entered in the Clarendon Stakes at Newmarket on 18 April, but was withdrawn, meaning that he was sent to Epsom for the Derby without having raced in public. At Epsom on 15 May he started as a 25/1 outsider in a field of twenty-one runners, with Sleight-of-hand being made the 5/1 favourite. The day was bitterly cold and the race itself was run in a snowstorm. Ridden by Samuel \\"Sim\\" Templeman, he was well-placed (\\"always handy\\") and turned into the straight in third or fourth place behind the filly Deception who had a clear advantage over Euclid. At one stage, the filly's lead grew to five lengths, but Templeman moved steadily closer on Bloomsbury and made his challenge a furlong from the finish. Bloomsbury overtook Euclid and then caught the filly to win \\"cleverly\\" by a length. Questions about the true identity of Bloomsbury were raised immediately after the Derby. Deception's owner, Fulwar Craven, lodged an official objection, claiming that Bloomsbury's pedigree had been inaccurately recorded. The colt had been registered by Weatherbys in the General Stud Book as having been sired \\"by Mulatto or Tramp\\", implying that his dam had been \\"covered\\" by both stallions in the year of his conception, but when entered for the Derby he was recorded as being simply \\"by Mulatto\\". The objection was not sustained by the stewards who felt that there was insufficient evidence. Craven was unwilling to accept the decision, claiming that he had been given insufficient time to prepare his case and announced his intention of taking legal action. The gambling community was left in a state of confusion, with bookmakers refusing to pay out on \\"winning\\" bets. Bloomsbury was then sent to Royal Ascot where he ran twice. On 4 June he ran in the Ascot Derby, a race now known as the King Edward VII Stakes. Despite carrying a five pound weight penalty as a result of his Derby win, he started 1/5 favourite and won by a length from the 2000 Guineas winner The Corsair. Two days later at the same meeting he won a £200 Sweepstakes, beating his only rival, an unnamed \\"sister to Hector\\", who reportedly had only been entered in the hope that Bloomsbury would be declared ineligible to run because of his questionable pedigree. More controversy followed Bloomsbury's Ascot success. The Corsair's owner, Lord Lichfield, with the support of Lord George Bentinck, lodged an objection on the grounds that Bloomsbury's identity was not as described in the race entries. The Jockey Club declined to adjudicate and the matter went to court in Liverpool where, on 22 August, a special jury found in favour of Ridsdale. Several witnesses gave evidence that Mulatto had been the only stallion to cover Arcot Lass in 1835. The information given to the compilers of the Stud Book on the other hand, was shown to have been inadequately sourced, relying on the word of a local racing official named Orton rather than Weatherbys staff. The editor of the Sporting Review, commenting on what he called \\"The Crisis of English Racing\\", expressed the view that the case had been unfairly represented as a clash between \\"might and right\\", with the jury siding with the \\"yeoman\\" against \\"his lord\\". The New Sporting Magazine took the opposing view characterizing the case against Ridsdale as a vindictive action conducted by the racing establishment and disgruntled gamblers. The case reportedly caused \\"a great sensation in the sporting world\\". Future editions of the Stud Book removed the reference to Tramp. In September, Bloomsbury was sent to Doncaster for the Great St Leger. He looked much less impressive than he had in summer, appearing underweight and suffering from a cracked heel. Bloomsbury started second favourite but lost his unbeaten record as he finished sixth of the twelve runners, having apparently \\"cut it\\" (given up) when put under pressure just after half way. The race was won by Charles the Twelfth, who defeated Euclid in a run-off following a dead-heat. Two days later Bloomsbury reappeared in a £200 Sweepstakes in which he started odds-on favourite but was again struggling well before turning into the straight and finished last of the three runners behind to Epidaurus and The Corsair. 1840: four-year-old season Bloomsbury's first start as a four-year-old came at Royal Ascot in June, when he ran in the Ascot Gold Cup, starting the 7/2 second favourite. According to press reports, Bloomsbury's jockey was unable to restrain him and he took the lead from the start. He was overtaken in the straight and finished third of the eight runners behind St. Francis. In July at Liverpool Bloomsbury started odds-on favourite and recorded his first win for over a year by beating an unnamed three-year-old filly by Lamplighter at weight-for-age in the one and a quarter mile Croxteth Stakes. At Newmarket in October, Bloomsbury carried top weight of 126 pounds in the second running of the Cesarewitch Handicap. Ridden by Sam Chifney, Bloomsbury was produced with a strong run at the end of the two and a quarter mile race, but hung away from Chifney's whip, and in a very rough and close finish, he was beaten by a neck into second place by Clarion. 1841: five-year-old season On his first start as a five-year-old, Bloomsbury returned to Royal Ascot for a second attempt at the Gold Cup on 3 June. On this occasion he finished fifth of the six runners behind Lanercost. Bloomsbury's final race came at Liverpool on 14 July when he ran in the Croxteth Stakes. He disputed the lead from the start with the four-year-old Doctor Caius, and after a \\"severely contested\\" race finished second by a neck. Assessment During this period there were rumours that several horses entered for the Classics, races restricted to three-year-olds, were in fact four-year-old \\"ringers\\". \\"Running Rein\\" was disqualified from the 1844 Derby on these grounds and there were serious doubts about the 1840 winner Little Wonder. A modern source claims that there were \\"good grounds\\" for suspecting that Bloomsbury was four when he won the Derby. When describing the colt, the Farmer's Magazine commented that he was \\"overgrown\\" and appeared to have been trained and fed to \\"what may be called a state of precocious maturity\\" while remarking that he was most unlikely to improve with age. Stud career At the end of his racing career, Bloomsbury was sold and exported to stand as a stud in Germany. In 1842, Bloomsbury was reported by a correspondent for New Sporting Magazine to be in Baron Malzahn's stud farm in Kummerow standing alongside Gustavus. He sired A Better One and Leonidas who both won the Henckel-Rennen and was the damsire of the Preis der Diana winners Lady Bird and Caro Dame. He died in 1861.

Bostich is an electronic music composer. Amezcua is an important figure in electronic music, especially in Mexico, Tijuana, and along the Mexico–United States border regions, but also in the United States and internationally. He has written songs for The Nortec Collective, as well as Nortec Collective presents: Bostich+Fussible. He has earned several Grammy Nominations, the most recent in 2011 for Bulevard 2000 by Nortec Collective Presents Bostich+Fussible under the category of Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album. Amezcua is considered the Godfather of Nortec by producers and fans alike since Bostich's early Nortec music clearly established the characteristics of his style: an interest in the electronic exploration, fragmentation, and reconstitution of tarola (snare drum) rhythmic patterns and tuba sounds and timbres, and their combinatorial possibilities. His song “Polaris“ marks the genesis of the Nortec style of music with its sequenced burpy tubas and machinegun drum sprays. Amezcua began his career as a recording artist and performer in the early 1990s when electronic music began to gain prominence in Mexico. He has recorded consistently since 1992 using the aliases Bostich, Point Loma, Monnithor and Las Cajas del Ritmo. As Bostich, he has collaborated with visual artists (Fritz Torres, Jorge Verdin, Checo Brown, Ernesto Aello), film directors (Les Bernstein, Hans Fjellestad, Emilio Maillé, Alex Rivera), writers (José Manuel Valenzuela, Alejandro L. Madrid, Juan Carlos Reyna), and musicians and composers (Pauline Oliveros, Kronos Quartet, Alan Parsons, The Baja California Orchestra, and Pepe Mogt). Since 2007, Amezcua has performed with Pepe Mogt, together known as \\"Bostich+Fussible,\\" and presenting themselves in concert as Nortec Collective presents: Bostich+Fussible. In 2011, the duo were honored performers at the opening ceremony of the 2011 Pan-American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico. Early life Ramón Amezcua is the son of Agustin Amezcua and Elizabeth Sanchez and father of Ramón Andrés, Luis Fernando, Amor and Eduardo Amezcua. In his youth, he was influenced heavily by his brothers' record collection. Consequently, Amezcua developed a varied record collection that included electronic music and progressive rock including Kraftwerk, Klaus Schulze, Bartók, Schoenberg, Luciano Berio as well as classical music like Ludwig van Beethoven and Mozart. Amezcua graduated from CECyT High School in Tijuana and went on to study Dentistry at the University of Baja California with a minor in Orthodontics at IDAP Tijuana. He then studied piano at the Casa de la Cultura Conservatory of Music in Tijuana and at 26 entered an accelerated college program at the Escuela de Musica del Noroeste in Tijuana, where he studied Composition and Cello. Career In Tijuana, Amezcua discovered electronic music by listening to Kraftwerk and Karlheinz Stockhausen. By then he had produced two albums: Tempo D'Afrodita in 1992 and Elektronische in 1994, with excellent reception in Mexico and abroad. Amezcua became a major promoter of the electronic music scene in Mexico by organizing massive electronic music concerts or raves in cities like Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara and Tijuana. In 1999 Amezcua founded the record label Mil Records with Pepe Mogt. They began mixing electronic music with musical elements and instrumentation of Tambora and Norteño music, resulting in the Nortec style. Mexican and international press dubbed his song Polaris as emblematic of the new Nortec sound. Polaris was later selected by the Mexico's Federal Government as the theme song for its millennium celebrations in Mexico City's Zócalo/Plaza Zócalo. Amezcua also composed the music for Mexico's pavilion at the Hanover Expo 2000, in Germany, along with fellow Nortec Collective member Pepe Mogt. In 2005, Amezcua and The Nortec Collective released the album Nortec Collective presents: Tijuana Sessions Vol.3 to excellent reviews by Rolling Stone and Billboard magazines, as well as The New York Times and other international publications. In 2006 Nortec performed at the Palacio de Bellas Artes de México, the most prestigious concert hall in Mexico. In 2008, Amezcua produced the album Tijuana Sound Machine with Pepe Mogt. The album received another Latin Grammy nomination. In 2008, Amezcua and Mogt, known as Bostich and Fussible respectively, made an extensive European summer tour. They performed in France, Spain, Morocco, Finland, England, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, and Turkey, among others. In 2008 Oxford University Press published the book Nortec Rifa by musicologist and professor Alejandro Madrid, P.h.D. at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In 2009, Amezcua was again nominated for an International Grammy for the Tijuana Sound Machine LP. The Winter Music Conference also nominated the album for the 24th Annual International Dance Music Award. In 2010, Amezcua earned another International Grammy nomination for the album Bulevar 2000 produced with Pepe Mogt. Amezcua and Mogt performed at the 2011 Pan-American Games opening celebration as Bostich and Fussible. Amezcua's theme Polaris was selected by the organizing committee as the main theme for the evening. Awards and nominations * 2006.

Françoise de Dreux was married to a member of the Paris Parlement and cousin of two judges in the Poison Affair. She was a popular member of the Paris high society and described as a charming beauty. She was passionately in love with Armand Jean de Vignerot du Plessis, the Duke de Richelieu, and a regular client of the poisoner Marguerite Joly. She was brought to trial in April 1679 after having been pointed out by Marie Bosse on the charges of murder of: Monsieur Pajot, Monsieur de Varennes; one of her lovers; one of her competing lovers of the Duke de Richelieu; the attempted murders of her husband and of Anne de Richelieu (wife of the Duke de Richelieu); and of having ordered poisoned wine from La Voisin. She was acquitted 27 April 1680. An epigram was written about her and the matter. After her poison supplier, Joly, was arrested, an order for her re-arrest was ordered in 1681. She left the country to avoid arrest, and upon the appeal from both her husband and her lover, she was spared any punishment for her crimes except exile from the capital. In the end, she was allowed to live in the capital anyway under her husband's supervision. The case against Françoise de Dreux and Marguerite Leféron, as well as that of Marguerite de Poulaillon, attracted attention as they were the first clients, and the first members of the upper classes to be implicated in the affair, and the light sentences toward them, despite their guilt, was considered damaging for the legitimacy of the court; they were obviously a proof of class discrimination, as other accused for the same crime in the case, but belonging to a different social class, were sentenced to be executed for the same crime. One example was that of Madame Philbert, who in 1673 murdered her carpenter husband Brunet by poison from Marie Bosse in order to marry her lover, musician Philippe Rebille Philbert: her crime was identical to that of Leféron, but she was sentenced to hang after having her right hand cut off.

Directed, written, and edited by Jean-Marc Vallée, the film garnered 13 nominations for the 2012 Genie Awards.\\"‘Café de Flore’, ‘A Dangerous Method’ lead Genie Awards race\\" . Toronto Star, January 17, 2012. The title refers not to the popular café on Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris, but to a Matthew Herbert song of the same name which the film uses to represent its musical current. Plot The film cuts between two seemingly unrelated stories. One, set in present-day Montreal, focuses on Antoine, a successful club DJ torn between his new girlfriend Rose and his still-complicated relationship with his childhood friend and ex-wife Carole; the other, set in 1960s Paris, features Jacqueline, the fiercely protective single mother of Laurent, a child with Down syndrome who has a crush on Véronique, a friend and companion who also has Down syndrome. The film builds toward the revelation of how the two stories are linked: after Jacqueline, Laurent, and Véronique are killed in a car accident, Carole, Antoine, and Rose are their subsequent reincarnations. Cast A small (last credit on screen) but important role is \\"la médium\\", played by Emmanuelle Beaugrand-Champagne. She helps Carole understand that her recurring dreams of a young mongoloid (word used in the dialogue) boy, and of a horrendous car crash, are the memories from when she was Jacqueline, going through her own emotional trauma that her love for Laurent (Carole for Antoine) was being displaced by his love for Véronique (Rose). Production Filming Café de Flore was shot in Montréal and Paris, from 16 August 2010 until 19 November 2010. In Paris, a scene was filmed on Boulevard Saint- Germain in front of the famous Parisian café of the same name. Soundtrack Café de Flore's multi-genre soundtrack includes tracks from The Cure, Sigur Ros, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Pink Floyd. By fusing modern electronic and avant-garde elements with old world orchestral sounds, the music connects the two major time periods of the film. The film borrows its title from the electronic-tinged \\"Café de Flore\\", a song written and performed by British musician Matthew Herbert in 2000. The song is used throughout the film to represent and reinforce its central themes. Café de Flore features two a capella performances: an a capella rendition of The Cure's Just Like Heaven performed by Florent and Parent, and a cover of Herbert's \\"Café de Flore\\" performed by Paradis, Brochu and Les Petits Chanteurs du Mont Royal. Vallée had originally planned to put Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" on the soundtrack, but lead singer Robert Plant turned down its use.  Reception   Critical response  Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 62% based on reviews from 53 critics, with an average rating of 6.4 out of 10.Café de Flore at Rotten Tomatoes. In Canada, Café de Flore was generally well received by critics. CineAction critic Alsegul Koc describes Valleé's film as \\"the aftershocks of an amorous earthquake\\"; a story which \\"amplifies the horrors and joys of letting go and starting anew\\". He admires the film's ability to delve into deeper, more emotionally vulnerable areas of the human psyche than conventional love stories.Koc, Alsegul (2012). Emotional Fault Lines in Café de Flore.

Shamanism  Shirokogoroff once wrote that by being transformed into a reindeer, the shaman feels himself to be \\"swift, vigilant, watchful, the best animal the Tungus know.\\" Reindeer antlers, in particular, serve simultaneously as weapons and representations of power. Also, the definition of shamanism varies widely. Soviet scholars perceived them as a version of the priesthood, but Willerslev posits that shamanism is a \\"broad-based activity practiced to varying degrees by common hunters rather than as a form of 'mysticism' under the control of a religious elite.\\" Equipment ;Baton A shaman's baton is an important object for religious celebrations, where it represents the shaman's spirit helper and serves as the tool for striking his drum, which is perceived as \\"driving the reindeer.\\" The Evenks utilise the baton to predict the future regarding the growth and welfare of their reindeer herds by throwing the baton towards the inquiring person and determining the answer based on how it falls. ;Drum The drum is the most important shamanic utensil because the sounds a shaman makes with it permit him to summon spirits to aid him in his work. A shaman's drum consists of a circular wooden hoop over which reindeer hide has been stretched. The drum is closely associated with reindeer, the riding of which facilitated the shaman's ability to go on journeys, and was the source of the shaman's strength. A shaman's drum was initiated and brought to life in an initiation ceremony that concluded with a feast of reindeer meat that had been slaughtered the day before. The ceremony in which the drum is brought to life spans several days. On the second day, the ceremony is devoted to retracing the steps of the life of the reindeer whose skin was used to make the drum. The shaman collects everything dropped by the deer, including all hairs, and brings everything to the swamp, where Ylyunda kotta, the mistress of the universe, lives. With the help of eight wolves, the shaman catches the soul of the reindeer for his drum. ;Clothing A shaman's outfit was prepared so that the power of the reindeer whose skins constructed the robe would be transferred to the one who wore it. The headdress often consists of a metal cap with reindeer antlers, and reindeer antlers also figured heavily in the designs of objects hung on the cloak. Attached to the cloak were strips of reindeer hair or reindeer skin, referring to the body of the reindeer and to the fact that shamans regain the ability to fly that, according to the belief of the Ket people, reindeer had once possessed. Shamans also have wooden stakes that represent the reindeer on which they ride to other worlds. The best of the Enets shamans have iron reindeer staves with a face at the tip of its handle and a lower end shaped like a hoof. These staves are used for treating the sick and sending the souls of the dead to the next world. Medical treatment A shaman's main strategy in treating the sick was to intercede between the sick person, and the spirits and deities whose behaviour was associated with disease, by banishing the evil spirit from the patient and returning the soul stolen by the spirits. Shamans invite spirits inside themselves by swallowing and yawning and treat them to reindeer blood and fat before using their influence to cast his baton to discover the most effective source of treatment. They also called upon helper spirits, which were often reindeer, to transfer the disease from a human body into the helper spirit. A sick person can also be cured by placing the injured part of his body inside the \\"belly\\" of a reindeer; when the injured area is too large for this management of the problem, the reindeer's entrails are pulled out to form a loop through which the ill person can step.  Ceremonies and sacrifices  Although different Siberian peoples follow different traditions, many ceremonial practices involving reindeer possess similar underlying features. These often relate to the well-being of the herd and the monetary benefits gained as a result, reflect the people's nomadic heritage, and express humanity's relationship to the cyclic progression of the seasons. In general, sacrifices take place in \\"sacred places\\", which are usually sanctified thickets in the woods that are home to gods or spirits and where hallowed trees stand. Reindeer skins, hoof, and antlers hang in the trees, because it is believed necessary for the deity to receive the entirety of the animal being sacrificed. Although different peoples perform reindeer sacrifice in different ways, all of these rites involve the offering of the animal to a spirit or deity in some way.  Khanty  To the Khanty people, reindeer sacrifice is part of a series of overarching practices around ritual killings, offered to \\"make life for a man easier\\", in order to prolong life and help men to recover from sickness, according to the son of a shaman. Khanty differentiate between \\"bloody\\" sacrifices, or yir, in which the blood of the sacrificed animals is preserved and consumed, in addition to portions of the raw meat, and \\"bloodless\\" sacrifices, or pori, in which the meat of the sacrificed animal is boiled and eaten. Khanty have sacrificed other animals besides reindeer, including horses, cows, bulls, rams, and roosters, but reindeer are infinitely preferable because the sacrifice of a useful animal is considered to be more significant. The choice of location for the sacrifice is revealed in a dream to the chirta-ko, or Khanty cultural specialist. The chirta-ko prepared by leading the tribe in singing spirit songs accompanied by his drum. During a specific song, he consumes mushrooms and is enlightened by their influence as to the logistical details of the sacrifice. The reindeer to be sacrificed have coloured cloths tied to their necks, and the different colours hold special meanings: white is associated with the sky, black is associated with the underworld, and red is associated with earthly mortality. The gender of the reindeer should be the same as that of the spirit to whom it is being offered. The reindeer's colouring is an important factor in determining the specific individuals to be sacrificed. The number of animals offered in communal sacrifice is usually either three or seven. After a ritual with chanting prayers, the reindeer are killed and skinned without spilling any blood on the snow. The people clean the butchered carcasses and consume raw muscle meat with salt and cooked stomach, heart, and liver. The ceremony ends by chanting prayers of thanksgiving. They then hang the reindeer skins and bones in trees for the purpose of returning the animal's spirit to the \\"Keeper of Game or Master of Animals\\" for the purpose of being \\"reclothed with new flesh and sent back to the earth-surface world for the benefit of the people\\".  Koryaks  Among the Koryaks, men bring the reindeer herds away from the summer camp during the summer, but the women, children and old people remain. At the first notice that the herds are returning, the people run out to meet them with burning fire.  Chukchi  The Chukchi hold a similar celebration, where they greet the returning herd with a boisterous welcome, before slaughtering a series of both fawns and bucks, skinning their carcasses, and extracting marrow from the reindeer's bones as sustenance. They then use reindeer blood in a painting ritual. The \\"fawn festival\\" is an annual Chukchi event which takes place every spring, during which a reindeer is sacrificed to the \\"One-On-High.\\" The Chukchi also hold a \\"ceremonial of antlers\\" in which they collect all of the antlers of all of the animals in their herds, and when the collection becomes too cumbersome to move, they place them all in a large pile and hold a sacrifice.  Burial traditions  In general, sacrifices take place in \\"sacred places\\", which are usually sanctified thickets in the woods that are home to gods or spirits and where hallowed trees stand. Reindeer skins, hooves and antlers hang in the trees, because it is believed necessary for the deity to receive the entirety of the animal being sacrificed. Although different peoples perform reindeer sacrifice in different ways, all of these rites involve the offering of the animal to a spirit or deity in some way. Many cultures have some version of the idea that the souls of the dead need a vehicle to transport them to the next world, so it is logical that the peoples of Siberia, where reindeer are the most common large draught and riding animals, believe that reindeer perform this service.  Khanty  Reindeer antlers are often found piled on top of burial sites.  Yugra  The Yugra peoples also use reindeer to transport their dead for burial, but they then strangle the animals at the gravesite before slaughtering them. They then wrap the bones in the skin and leave the bundle to the left of the grave, also positioning the head (with attached antlers) on the roof of the grave-house.  Evenks  The Evenks believed in spirits that inhabited the underground, so they buried their dead above ground by sewing the bodies into reindeer skins and placing the wrapped cadavers on high poles.  Chukchi  Among the Chukchi, the burial ceremony provides the dead person with the means to travel to the underworld and to send them on their way, if not to carry them the whole distance. First, the shaman divines where the person wished to be buried. Friends of the deceased carry the body out of the tent through its smoke hole or out the back and tie it to a new or freshly repaired sledge to which reindeer have been harnessed. When the funeral cortège arrives at the burial site, the reindeer are untied and stabbed, then rehitched to the sled. The leader of the funeral procession then takes the reins and cracks the whip, pretending to drive the reindeer to the country of the dead, and he only ceases when the reindeer are dead. Then the reindeer are butchered and the carcasses are left on the burial site with the sledge, and harness. The deceased's family places the skins from the slaughtered reindeer on the floor of their tent and places iron objects on top of them, preventing the dead from reemerging through the ground. The Chukchi also hold a \\"ceremonial of antlers\\" in which they collect all of the antlers of all of the animals in their herds, and when the collection becomes too cumbersome to move, they place them all in a large pile and hold a sacrifice.

Early life Metropolitan Valentin (Rusantsov) was born on March 3, 1939 in the town of Belorechensk, Krasnodar Krai. Since his father had died from war wounds and his mother was seriously ill, the young Anatolii was sent to an orphanage. He was adopted by Yekaterina Buriak, from the city of Maykop, Krasnodar Krai, who was a member of the Russian Orthodox Church in the Catacombs. In 1952, during a religious pilgrimage in Georgia, the young Anatolii met with monastics who showed him the beauty of Orthodox monasticism. In 1956 he traveled to Holy Dormition Monastery, in the city of Odessa, where he met Archbishop Nestor (Anisimov), a well-known missionary to Kamchatka, and who had served one of the Far Eastern eparchies of the Russian Church Abroad prior to World War II. Together with Archbishop Nestor, Anatolii traveled to the Novosibirsk diocese where he was tonsured reader in the village of Bolshoi Ului, Krasnoyarsk Krai. Priesthood and Episcopacy In 1957, Anatolii was sent by Archbishop Nestor to the Monastery of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius. In 1958 he was tonsured by into monasticism, receiving the name Valentin, by archimandrite Seraphim (Smykov), who had been ordained to the priesthood by Metropolitan Anthony (Khrapovitsky). In 1960, he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Anthony (Romanovky) of Stavropol and Baku, who had Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow among his consecrators to the episcopacy. Hieromonk Valentine served throughout the Stavropol and Vladimir dioceses, becoming the rector of the Orthodox Cathedral in Makhachkala (a predominant Muslim area), where he revived Orthodox Christianity, saving the Cathedral from closure. In 1970, he graduated from the historical faculty of Dagestan University. He completed his theological studies at the Moscow Theological Seminary in 1973 and in 1979 he obtained a Doctor of Theology degree from the Moscow Theological Academy. In 1973, Archimandrite Valentine was appointed as the rector of the Church of Kazan in the city of Suzdal. In 1977 the Communist authorities forced the community to leave the church building, which was situated on the city's trading square, and move to another, less prominent location, at the Saint Constantine the Great Church, also in the city of Suzdal. Since 1987 Archimandrite Valentin was persecuted by the Communist authorities and the leaders of the Moscow Patriarchate primarily for his commentaries during a lecture tour in the United States regarding the lack of religious freedom in the USSR. On April 11, 1990, Archimandrite Valentin and his parish were received into the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, and on October 4 of the same year, he was appointed exarch of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia within the territory of the USSR. On February 10, 1991, by the decision of the Synod of Bishops of the Russian Church Abroad, Archimandrite Valentin was consecrated bishop of Suzdal and Vladimir in the church of St Job the Much-Suffering in Brussels, Belgium. His consecrators were Archbishop Anthony (Bartoshevich) of Geneva and Western Europe, Archbishop Mark (Arndt) of Berlin and Germany, Bishop Barnabas (Prokofiev) of Cannes and Bishop Gregory (Grabbe) of Washington, all members of the episcopacy of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. In 1992-1993 followed a conflict with the Synod of Bishops of ROCOR. In July 1993 he was retired by the Synod. In March 1994, Bishop Valentine founded the Higher Church Administration of the Russian Orthodox Church. In June 1995 the Temporary Higher Church Administration (THCA) of the Russian Church was re-established, Archbishop Lazar (Zhurbenko) of Tambov and Odessa becoming its leader. At this time, by synodal decree of the THCA, Bishop Valentine was raised to the rank of Archbishop. Two years later, in 1996, the Hierarchal Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church was created with the official name of Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church (ROAC). At the Synod meeting of March 15, 2001, it was decided that the primate of the Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church should have the rank of Metropolitan. Metropolitan Valentine Rusantsov died on January 16, 2012 in Moscow, Russia.

The postcanine teeth are further reduced. Deepening of the postorbital region of the skull (behind the eyes) produced a larger temporal opening, indicating more muscle mass. The boss on the angular (rear of the jaw) has become very prominent, again, another sign of powerful jaw muscles. These huge animals were clearly formidable predators. In the Anteosaurinae, pachyostosis is taken to extremes. The dorsal (upper) surface of the nasal, frontal, and postfrontals (around and between/above the eyes) is thickened and rugose in the same manner as the tapinocephalids. Nevertheless these animals are too specialized and too late in time to have been the ancestors of the herbivorous tapinocephalids, so these characteristics evolved independently. Boonstra notes that the hip joint and the femur of Anteosaurus is comparable with those of the crocodile and that these animals may have had a crawling habit.

It was used extensively during World War II to transport servicemen, and played a minor role in the Civil Rights Movement. It was saved through the intervention of preservationists. Most of the building was incorporated in the new 1100 New York Avenue high-rise office building when it was built in 1991. First terminal On September 1932, a hearing involving the Public Utilities Commission, Several DC Streetcars, the Short Lines and representatives of the Greyhound Lines took place regarding the request for a new Terminal for the bus company on the Northern side of New York Avenue NW between 14th and 15th Street NE. A previous permit had been denied.Greyhound Station Hearing Ordered - September 10, 1932 - The Washington Post - page 10 The Washington Railway and Electric Company and the Short Lines opposed the project while the Capital Traction Company had no objection on the location of the terminal. The Washington Chamber of Commerce, the Board of Trade and the Merchants and Manufacturers Associations supported the project. A week later a building permit was granted by the Public Utilities Commission to build a terminal at 1403-11 New York Avenue NW with a circular driveway right outside of the border of the city congested zone. However the approval also implemented a limit on the number of arrivals and departures that could take place during peak traffic hours.Greyhound Station Will Be Approved - September 29, 1932 - The Washington Post - page 3 In June 1933, the terminal started to operateBus Industry Leaders To Attend: Souvenirs to Be Given Visitors To $1,000,000 Capital Station - March 25, 1940 - The Washington Post - page 13 but by 1938, this terminal had been outgrown by the number of buses and a replacement Terminal was needed.Company Plans New Terminal For Buses Here - December 15, 1938 - The Washington Post - page 16 Design and construction Areal View of the Greyhound Bus Terminal A plan for a new terminal was announced on December 15, 1938. It was estimated to cost $750,000 and to start in April 1939 with a completion date of November 15, 1939. It would house the buses of the Pennsylvania, Richmond, Capital and Atlantic Greyhound Lines as well as the Corporation managing the terminal and have air- conditioning. The site had previously been occupied by Annapolis Railway which had closed down in 1935. The architects were Wischmeyer, Arrasmith & Elswick of Louisville, KY and Frances P. Sullivan of Washington, DC. The current tenants were given 90-day notices. On August 10, 1939, it was announced that the old terminal had been leased to Arthur G. Dezendorf who operated a chain of automobile service stations and parking lot. Portions of the building would be rented out and possibly a bowling alley and a large parking garage. The transfer would take place on December 1939 when the Greyhound Lines would move to the new location.Present Greyhound Terminal Leased - August 10, 1939 - The Washington Post - page 26 On March 25, 1940, the Greyhound Lines Terminal was officially opened at 1100 New York Avenue NW. This was the Greyhound flagship at the time. The building and land cost $1 million. It was designed by William S. Arrasmith who designed over 50 streamline bus stations in the 1930s and 1940s.Greyhound Bus Terminal, DC Historic Sites, accessed March 16, 2018. The public was invited to attend the grand opening from 4pm to 9pm with entertainment and souvenirs were handed out (the nature of which is not known). A preview for the Greyhound executives was scheduled from 2pm to 4pm. Layout The Waiting Room in 1941 with lockers in the background The building was built of steel and cement. The facade line with Indiana limestone neatly rimmed along the upper edges with glazed black terracotta coping. Aluminum trim and glass-block accentuate the entrance. The main entrance was on New York Avenue NW on the ground floor and opened on a foyer which led to the main waiting room. Eight ticket windows were located on one side of the waiting room to offer quick and efficient service. The air-conditioned waiting room was finished in walnut with benches and trimmed with burnished copper. The floor was covered with checkerboard terrazzo. 24 photo murals showed scenic places in the United States. The domed ceiling was finished in coral buff green and tan as well as touches of burnished copper. On the same floor, visitors could find Highway Tours Inc. as well as the baggage checkrooms, parcel checking facilities, telephone booths, the information desk, a restaurant and a large drug store on the 12th Street NW side of the building. Directly behind the waiting area, in the rear of the building were the thirteen covered docks used for loading and unloading of arriving and departing buses. Twenty additional spaces were also available to park more buses and a cab stand was to be provided. In the basement, one could find the restrooms for men and women as well as the store rooms used by the restaurant. On the second floor where the executive offices of the Washington branche of the Greyhound Lines, the telephone system and telephone operators as well as the accounting department and the traffic department. Early years On March 26, 1940, the first bus entered the terminal at 12:01. All buses from the Greyhound Lines, Peninsula Bus Company and the Blue Ridge Bus Company would arrive and depart from this terminal. All buses entered the terminal from 11th Street NW and exited on 12th Street NW. In the first few years, the station was to experience heavy use with servicemen and civilians moving all over the country for the war effort in World War II. Sailors, soldiers and airmen were being moved all over the country. Greyhound Lines played an important role in the war effort due to rationing of gas and rubber and advertised it. On July 31, 1945, an altercation involving two men took place in the waiting room of the terminal. A man identified as John Velardi, 39, from Newark, NJ shot another man identified as Carl Steele, 29, from Washington, DC and then shot himself. The victim took a taxi to the hospital and survived while the shooter died at the hospital from his wounds. It was ruled as suicide. While it was not clear why the altercation took place, it appeared that the shooter did not have any previous record but had drinking heavily, was separated from his wife and a son who was a sailor was missing in the Pacific.

Picture recovered by the FBI. The terminal was the departure point for the Freedom Ride 1961 on board a Greyhound bus.Old Greyhound Bus Station, African American Cultural Heritage Trail, Cultural Tourism DC On May 4, 1961, thirteen black and white men and women aged 18 to 61 divided into two mixed groups boarded a Trailways bus (from the Trailways Terminal located a block away) and a Greyhound bus (from this terminal) in Washington, DC to begin a two week trip into Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. They planned on arriving in New Orleans, Louisiana on May 17, 1961.Freedom Rides, CORE Website This trip was called \\"Freedom Ride 1961\\" and was sponsored by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). It was inspired by the \\"Journey of Reconciliation\\" undertaken in 1947 by eight black men and eight white men. The 1961 trip was to test the non-enforcement of the Supreme Court of the United States decisions Morgan v. Virginia (1946) and Boynton v. Virginia (1960) which ruled that segregated public buses were unconstitutional. The Southern states had ignored the rulings and the federal government did nothing to enforce them. The Freedom Riders' tactics for their journey were to have at least one interracial pair sitting in adjoining seats, and at least one black rider sitting up front, where seats under segregation had been reserved for white customers by local custom throughout the South. The rest of the team would sit scattered throughout the rest of the bus. One rider would abide by the South's segregation rules in order to avoid arrest and to contact CORE and arrange bail for those who were arrested. The participants where all volunteers and did not encounter any issues on their departure from the Greyhound and Trailways Terminals in Washington, DC. They encountered some small incidents in Virginia and North Carolina and John Lewis was attacked in Rock Hill, South Carolina. However, in Birmingham, Alabama and in Anniston, Alabama extensive violence took place which made international news. With the support of local authorities, the Ku Klux Klan organized violence against the group. The Greyhound bus was attacked and firebombed and both groups were beaten by the mobs. This trip played a significant role in the Civil Rights Movement.See Freedom Riders (Wikipedia). Decline By the 1970s, the terminal had lost most of the elegance and charm of the 1940s. Bus transportation had lost it glamour and the station reflected this. This is how a journalist from the Washington Post described the terminal in 1973: The population has also changed. While there are still some travelers and servicemen, there are also many locals trying to earn some money legally and illegally. Hustling, drugs and homelessness were major issues and it impacted the safety of passengers. Guards and police officers were on duty to keep order the terminal was in decline. The main entrance during the 1976 remodeling North front and west side during the 1976 remodeling On September 28, 1972, a bomb made of of dynamite attached to a clock was left in the terminal. An anonymous phone call was placed at 9:45am announcing that they had placed a bomb in the terminal. After arriving on site, DC police searched but did not find anything and left. A second phone call came in at 10:50am and informed the staff that it was in a locker. The police returned with a dog trained in detecting explosives and using a stethoscope, the locker was found on the west wall. The locker was pried open and the bomb found at 11:15am.Bus Station Bomb Defused - Alfred E. Lewis Washington - September 29, 1972 - The Washington Post - page A9 In the summer of 1974, the Greyhound Lines were ordered by the city to clean the bathrooms. It followed an inspection on July 30, 1974 by the DC Environmental Health Administration based on a consumer complain. Flies, roaches, broken toilet seats, broken trash containers, windows with no screens, absence of paper towels and general uncleanliness were witnessed. The company was given five days to start the work and two weeks to complete all repairs.Greyhound Given 2 Weeks to Clean Up Its Rest Rooms - Erwin Washington - July 31, 1974 - The Washington Post - page A28 In 1976, Greyhound Lines decided to remodel the building to make it fit more in the modern downtown Washington, DC was becoming. It was decided to box up the art deco building. Architect Gordon Holmquist was tasked with the job. The remodel would install concrete asbestos panels and a metal mansard roof around the building. The entire remodel cost $1 million.Bus Companies Want Place in Union Station - Vernon C. Thompson - June 15, 1978 - The Washington Post - page DC4 By 1978, it was clear that the terminal was reaching the end of its life as a bus terminal. It was suffering from its age, its design which did not work anymore with so many people present and crime was a major issue in the area. The future seemed to be in the vicinity of the train station. The association with Union Station had been proposed by the Department of Transportation back in 1974 at a cost of $50 million but had been put on hold as Congress had not acted on this proposal. While Congress was attempted to help Union Station recover from the National Visitor Center failure and the lack of parking there, adding a bus terminal in Union Station was not on the agenda but both Greyhound Lines and Trailways were in talks to get closer to the Station. On June 2, 1981, Greyhound Lines announced a multi-million land swap with developer Morton Bender in the presence of Mayor Marion Barry. The developer would build a new terminal at 90 K Street NE, a block from Union Station and he would gain the old terminal which was not located in a prime location downtown. Prices had gone up rapidly in 1980 in the vicinity of New York Avenue NW. The new terminal would be twice the size of the old terminal but the city would have a say in how the land would be developed as it was located in an urban renewal area. It was hoped construction would be completed by the end of 1982. The old location was valued at between $6.5 million and $19 million for the 32,000 square-foot lot. The developer did not have any precise plans for the old terminal.Greyhound Plans Terminal Near Union Station - Martha M. Hamilton - June 3, 1981 - The Washington Post - page A1 It was rumored that Trailways was also working on moving closure to Union Station. The Trailways Bus Terminal had been a neighbor of the Greyhound terminal since the 1950s at the corner of 12th Street NW and New York Avenue NW. On July 20, 1982, it was announced that they were also moving to the corner of First Street NE and L Street NE, a block away from the new Greyhound Terminal near Union Station.D.C. Sells Land For New Station For Trailways - LaBarbara Bowman - July 21, 1982 - The Washington Post - page C24 Preservation Rear view of the building after excavation. By 1987, the building and the land were owned by Carlyle Associates of New York. They wanted to develop a 12-story building on the site which would have led to the Art Deco building to be demolished. The 1940s architecture was still covered with the panels from 1976 and it was unclear how the old facade had been preserved under the asbestos panels and the metal cladding. Preservationists had mobilized to get the structure designated as a historic landmark to protect it.D.C. Greyhound Station to Be Saved For Its Hidden Art Deco Architecture - Wendy Swallow - January 24, 1987 - The Washington Post - page F1 On January 24, 1987, the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board voted unanimously to designate the old Greyhound Terminal a historical landmark in spite of the fact that Art Deco details were covered and the condition unknown. It was the first time such a decision was made and it was a national precedent for the preservation of historic buildings across the United-States. In 1988, the developers and the future owners of the building agreed to a 10% reduction of the office space. This allowed the entire terminal to be saved and to serve as the entrance and lobby of the new 1100 New York Ave. On February 1, 1989, the 1976 remodel was finally removed and it appeared that the art deco details had been preserved, including the two flag on the front of the building. It was cause for celebration with a 1973 Greyhound bus brought in for the occasion. The entire building would be restored and the history of the building put forward.Bus Terminal Sheds Modern Image; New Building on N.Y.

As stated in the Manifesto, one of the key objectives of the RSM is \\"all-round support to all forms of workers' struggle and self-organisation, primarily through militant trade unions. Defending the interests of the labour movement as a whole, the RSM will develop and strengthen independent and grass-roots trade union movements, focusing itself on a decisive struggle for democratic and anti-capitalist demands.\\" Activities After the unification of left-wing organisations, the RSM included more than ten regional branches with centres in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Kaluga, Novosibirsk, Perm, Saratov, Yaroslavl and other cities. The organisation is actively involved in various social movements, in particular trades unions and urban, environmental and women's movements. Of particular note is the participation of RSM activists in a campaign against the limitation of women's right to abortion, during which actions were staged in many Russian cities. A demonstration was held in Moscow on the reproductive rights of Russians (The Institute of Collective Action, 6 September 2011) [http://www.baltinfo.ru/2011/06/24/V-Peterburge-proidet-piket-protiv- ogranicheniya-prava-zhenschin-na-aborty-213242 Demonstrators picket in St Petersburg against the restriction of the right of women to abortion (Baltinfo, 24 June 2011) Members of the organisation were prominent in the campaigns to save the Khimki and Siverskiy forests, due to be destroyed to construct a new highway. During the defense of Khimki forest, the RSM and other leftist and anarchist organisations came out in favour of giving the campaign an explicitly left-wing character and stood in opposition to the participation of liberal and right-wing politicians in the campaign. The RSM also acted as one of the organisers of a training camp for defenders of the forest, which was attended by anarchists and representatives of other leftist organisations.

In 1864 he began work as an \\"assistant naturalist\\" to geologist Gabriel Auguste Daubrée (1814–1896), who was an important and lasting influence to Meunier's career. In 1867 he became affiliated with the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle, where from 1892 to 1920 he served as chair of geology. Meunier is remembered for his work in comparative and experimental geology, and is credited for introducing experimental geology into the classroom as a specific branch of physical science. In his studies of meteorites, he identified thirty chemical elements that could also be found in Earth-based rocks. Referring to research of Gustav Kirchhoff (1824–1887) and Robert Wilhelm Bunsen (1811–1899) involving spectral analysis of the Sun, he stated that a unity of chemical composition existed in the solar system. The meteorite collection of the National Museum of Natural History Meunier also performed important geological studies (general and experimental) of the Paris Basin. Meunier was a prolific author, publishing more than 570 works that included around thirty books. Many of his articles were printed in La Nature and Revue Scientifique.

Like other range wars in the Old West, the war pitted cattlemen against sheepherders. Because the cattlemen were unwilling to share the open range with the sheepherders, due to concerns about overgrazing, they formed paramilitary organizations with the goal of eliminating the flocks of sheep and anyone who attempted to stop them. Between 1895 and 1906, the Sheepshooters, as they were called, slaughtered at least 25,000 sheep. A few men were also killed during gunfights or related incidents. The war Since the cattle industry arrived first in Oregon, the cattlemen, or cattle barons, held a monopoly on Oregon's pasturelands in the east of the state. So, when they arrived, the sheepherders quickly became a threat to the cattle industry. Sheep were known to strip a valley clean of all vegetation, leaving it barren and desolate, while cattle ate only grass, leaving behind weeds, which held down the topsoil and allowed grass to regrow. Some cowboys even asserted that sheep stunk very badly and left behind smelly fields that cattle would not use. Water was also a concern, sheep polluted water holes to a point that cattle couldn't drink from them without becoming ill. The cattlemen weren't entirely guiltless themselves; even though the open range meant public land, the cattlemen were known for fencing off territory that didn't belong to them, in order to prevent sheepherders, or other ranchers, from using the resources. By the early 1880s, sheepherding was becoming more and more popular in Oregon, but the cattlemen and the newcomers seemed to coexist mostly peacefully until 1895, when the first Sheepshooters group was formed in Grant County. Calling themselves the \\"Izee Sheepshooters,\\" the cowboys began attacking sheep camps and establishing deadlines, a type of border in which sheep were not allowed to cross. Because the Izee cowboys were successful with their campaigns, a \\"Sheepshooters Association\\" was formed in neighboring Crook County and another in Union County. According to the Insiders Guide to Bend and Central Oregon, all of the sheepshooters agreed that \\"if a sheepherder was killed during a mission, he would be buried on the spot\\" and \\"if one of their own were killed, he would be brought home to be buried, with no mention of how he met his demise.\\" Also, \\"if any association member was captured by the law [police] and brought to trial, he was duty-bound to lie on the witness stand about his involvement with the group.\\" Usually the sheepshooters would launch a surprise attack on a camp, capture the herders, and then shoot or club all of the sheep. Often the herders were beaten, but occasionally there were small shootouts. According to William R. Racy, a rancher interviewed by author Richard Negri, he met an old sheepherder who was the victor of one of the gunfights, though the story has not been confirmed. William R. Racy said the following: The conflict didn't reach its height until after the turn of the century and most of the violence occurred in the High Desert, between the Cascades and the Blue Mountains. By 1898, the Cascade Range Forest Reserve was expanding its boundaries. This meant that sheepherders, who had used the area unmolested for years, were now suddenly forced to go elsewhere to raise their animals. Many headed east towards the Blue Mountains, an area already exploited by cattle. Over time, the influx of sheep into the Blue Mountains area led to overgrazing. Deadlines were established and large sheep massacres became very common. Sometimes the cowboys left notices attached to a tree that marked the boundary. A typical notice would be similar to the following: \\"Warning to Sheep Men – You are hereby ordered to keep your sheep on the north side of plainly marked line or you will suffer the consequences. Signed Inland Sheep Shooters.\\" One of the largest sheep massacres occurred in 1903, on the High Desert near Benjamin Lake. Nearly 2,400 sheep were \\"herded off a rimrock\\" and those that survived the fall were shot to death. In 1904, over 6,000 sheep were killed in three central Oregon counties, although the secretary of the Crook County Sheepshooters Association claimed that his men had killed between 8,000 and 10,000. The only known human death attributed to the conflict occurred on or about March 4, 1904. John Creed Conn was neither a cattleman or a sheepherder, but a storekeeper from the town of Silver Lake. He was, however, the brother of a district attorney and member of a prominent family. Though investigators concluded that the death was a suicide, Conn's body was found outside of town, seven weeks later, with two bullet holes in the chest, wounds that the doctor who performed the autopsy said could only have been caused by another person. The war ended in the latter half of 1906, when the Blue Mountain Forest Reserve was created by the Department of Agriculture and when the United States government began establishing grazing allotments. Because the cattlemen and the sheepherders were no longer sharing the same land, there was no more reason to fight each other.

It carries out and promotes observance of the rule of law, justice, protection of the rights and legitimate interests of the individual and society in criminal and other legal proceedings. History On 23 July 1812, the authorities of the Russian Empire in Bessarabia laid the foundation for the activities of the prosecutor's office in Bessarabia. In May 1818, a prosecutor was appointed under the provincial government, county prosecutors appeared in the districts and county prosecutors were established, and prosecutors were approved by civil servants. The regional prosecutor’s office existed in Bessarabia until 1859, when the Chisinau district court was created and prosecutors appeared at the district courts and the Court of Appeal. After the October Revolution and the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Moldavian Democratic Republic was formed on the territory of the right-bank part of the Bessarabian province, which lasted less than a year and became part of the Kingdom of Romania. By decree of the King Ferdinand I on 6 October 1918, the prosecutor's supervision is carried out by the prosecutor under the leadership of the Minister of Justice, who was the general prosecutor. After the establishment of Soviet power in Moldova on 2 August 1940, 6 district prosecutor’s offices were created in the following cities: Balti, Bender, Cahul, Chisinau, Orhei and Soroca. The procedure for the creation and powers of the prosecutor's office were established in accordance with the regulation on 17 December 1933.Положение о прокуратуре Союза ССР By decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on 22 June 1941, Moldovan prosecutors were either enlisted in the Red Army or continued to monitor public order, labor discipline, the rights and interests of the military and their families. In the post-war period, the activities of the prosecutor's office were focused on strengthening the rule of law in various fields. In October 1947, the original district prosecutor's offices were liquidated with all city and district prosecutors being directly subordinate to the prosecutor's office of the Moldavian SSR.Указ Президиума Верховного Совета СССР «Об утверждении Положения о прокурорском надзоре в СССР» With the adoption of the Constitution of the USSR (1977) and the Constitution of the Moldavian SSR (1978), the position of the prosecutor's office was significantly strengthened.

Ozu had wanted to name the film Tokyo Twilight, but studio executives preferred a title that referenced motherhood, a popular theme in Japanese cinema at the time of release. The film tells of the strained relationship between a mother and her two sons after the death of the family patriarch. Ozu once said that he remembered making this early film \\"not because it was any good, but because my father died while I was making it\\". Plot Mr. Kajiwara (Yukichi Iwata) promises his two sons, Sadao and Kosaku, a weekend trip to the beach. Later that day his wife, Chieko (Mitsuko Yoshikawa), receives a phone call informing her that her husband has collapsed at work. After Kajiwara's funeral, his friend Okazuki visits Chieko, asking her to continue to raise the eldest boy, Sadao, as if he were her own. It is revealed that Chieko was Kajiwara's second wife and that Sadao is Kajiwara's son from his first marriage. Several years later Okazuki visits Chieko again. Chieko tells him that she has just argued with Sadao because, when preparing materials for his university application, Sadao consulted his birth certificate and discovered the secret of his parentage. Okazuki explains to Sadao that the deception was necessary because it allowed Chieko to treat Sadao as her own son. At first, Sadao complains that he feels tricked, but then tearfully apologizes to his mother. Sadao persuades a friend on the university rowing team, Hattori (Chishū Ryū), to leave the whorehouse in which he has been living. He asks Chieko for a loan to pay Hattori's debts but then discovers that Chieko has asked Kosaku to cancel an expensive trip he had been planning. Sadao tries to return the loan, but Chieko refuses it, so he instead gives the money to Kosaku to pay for his trip. At first, Chieko resists, but when the sons point out that she always treats Sadao more favorably than Kosaku, she relents. While Kosaku is away, Sadao again argues with Chieko that she is treating the sons differently. Later, Kosaku asks Sadao why he made their mother upset. Kosaku becomes angry and repeatedly strikes Sadao, who storms away. To explain Sadao's behavior, Chieko reveals the truth of his parentage to Kosaku. The next day Chieko finds Sadao at the whorehouse and begs him to come home, but he refuses. After Chieko leaves, a cleaner asks Sadao to reconsider. Moved by her words, he returns home, and the family is reconciled.

Scott Speedman stars as Canadian gangster and alleged murderer Edwin Alonzo Boyd. The film originally premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival under the title Edwin Boyd, but was retitled Citizen Gangster in general release.  Plot  A veteran of World War II, Edwin Boyd (Scott Speedman) is disillusioned and barely getting by as a Toronto bus driver. With his wife Doreen (Kelly Reilly), whom he met in England during the war, and two young children to support, he finds it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. Adding to his dissatisfaction, Boyd has deep, unfulfilled dreams of making it as a star in Hollywood, a desire frowned upon by his retired policeman father (Brian Cox). In a moment of desperation, Boyd grabs an old pistol, disguises his face with theatrical greasepaint, and goes out to rob a bank; this sets off a series of events leading to one of Canada’s most infamous crime sprees. Boyd forms a gang, which includes Lenny Jackson (Kevin Durand), Ann Roberts (Melanie Scrofano), and Val Kozak (Joseph Cross). Jackson is also a veteran of WWII, and with his muscular build is the picture of the hardened criminal. There is an uneasy relationship between him and Boyd, given the attention lavished on the latter by the media; yet the two of them, both war vets, have a deep, unspoken brotherly bond. Val Kozak (Joseph Cross) is in a similar bind as Boyd, with a young wife and a desperate need to support his family. But he is also carrying on an affair with Mary Mitchell (Charlotte Sullivan), a fur-coat-wearing, flashy blonde party girl, whose flamboyant facade reveals a woman with past hurts and a deep-seated need for love and attention. The foil to the gang’s mayhem is Detective Rhys, (William Mapother). A sombre family man who takes his work seriously, Rhys is the face of law enforcement in the movie, constantly on the gang’s trail. Boyd's marriage grows increasingly strained. Despite the fact that Boyd’s initial motivation was a bid to provide for his young family and prove himself as a man, the nature of his lifestyle proves too much for her to handle.  Cast   Production  Filming began February 17, 2011 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.  Release  Citizen Gangster premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. IFC Films distributed it in the United States.  Reception  , the film holds a 53% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, based on 15 reviews with an average rating of 5.5 out of 10. Metacritic rated it 56/100 based on 9 reviews. Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star rated it 3/4 stars called it a \\"carefully crafted, sympathetic examination of Canada's most notorious bank robber\\". Joe Leydon of Variety called it \\"generally low-key but sporadically exciting\\". Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times wrote, \\"Citizen Gangster is a good-looking but passionless affair that remains stubbornly aloof from its audience.\\" Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times called it a stylish but overly familiar film whose main draw is Speedman's performance. The film won the award for Best Canadian First Feature Film at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.\\"The people choose a surprise: Small Lebanese film triumphs over rivals with higher profiles\\". Toronto Star, September 19, 2011. The film garnered three Genie Award nominations at the 2012 Genie Awards: Best Actor (Speedman), Best Supporting Actor (Durand) and Best Supporting Actress (Sullivan).

A backchannel response can be verbal, non-verbal, or both. Backchannel responses are often phatic expressions, primarily serving a social or meta-conversational purpose, such as signifying the listener's attention, understanding, or agreement, rather than conveying significant information. Examples include such expressions as \\"yeah\\", \\"uh-huh\\", \\"hmm\\", and \\"right\\".  Definition and use  The term was coined by Victor Yngve in 1970, in the following passage: \\"In fact, both the person who has the turn and his partner are simultaneously engaged in both speaking and listening. This is because of the existence of what I call the back channel, over which the person who has the turn receives short messages such as 'yes' and 'uh-huh' without relinquishing the turn.\\"Yngve, Victor. \\"On getting a word in edgewise,\\" page 568. Papers from the Sixth Regional Meeting [of the] Chicago Linguistic Society, 1970. Backchannel responses are a part of basic human interaction because to have a productive or meaningful person-person interaction humans must cooperate with one another when participating in a conversation. Meaning, when two people are involved in a conversation one person is generally the one talking and the other is listening and the listener can show the speaker they are cooperating through backchannel responses. The term \\"backchannel\\" was designed to imply that there are two channels of communication operating simultaneously during a conversation.White, Sheida. \\"Backchannels across cultures: A study of Americans and Japanese .\\" Language in society (1989): 59-76. The predominant channel is that of the speaker who directs primary speech flow. The secondary channel of communication (or backchannel) is that of the listener which functions to provide continuers or assessments,Li, Han. \\"Patterns of Backchannel Responses in Canadian-Chinese Conversations\\" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, TBA, San Francisco, CA, May 23, 2007 . 2009-02-04 defining a listener's comprehension and/or interest. In other words the term \\"backchannel\\" is used to differentiate between the roles of the people involved in a conversation. The person doing the speaking is thought to be communicating through the \\"front channel\\" while the person doing the listening is thought to be communicating through the \\"backchannel.\\" The term \\"backchannel\\" does not necessarily define the listener's role in the conversation but helps us to understand how the person that is taking on the role of the listener responds to the person taking on the role of the speaker. Recent research, which can be seen below, has also suggested new terms for these two functions. They have proposed the term generic in place of continuers and specific in place of assessments. Usually, the way backchannel is used would be a person telling a story or explaining something to one or more individuals, involved in a conversation, who would respond to him with short verbal messages or non-verbal body language. In order to indicate that they are listening and paying attention to the speaker, they might produce sounds as \\"right\\", \\"yeah\\", etc. or give a nod. Such acknowledgments or small gestures help the speaker understand that the listeners are interested and he should go on with his story. [22] In recent years, scholars have challenged the mainstream definition by adding the \\"optionality\\" in the definition of \\"backchannel\\". The use of backchannel is never necessary and is always a supplement to a pre-existing conversation.  Classification of Backchannels  The Cooperative Principle was first introduced in 1975 by Paul Grice, a British philosopher of language. The principle implies both speaker and listener contribute and cooperate with one another throughout a conversation in order to have a mutual understanding. \\"Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.\\" [19] The Cooperative Principle consists of four following maxims: maxim of quantity, quality, relations, and maxim of manner, respectively.[20] The maxim of quantity stands for there being enough information in order to properly understand the context. The second maxim, the maxim of quality, requires a speaker have his speech backed up by evidences and facts in order to prevent any leak of misinformation. The maxim of relation makes sure that the person speaking is being relevant and sticks to the main point or topic of the conversation. The last and fourth maxim of manner, is responsible for getting straight to the point, being lucid, brief and having a clearly expressed or precise presentation. [21]  Applicability  Backchannel responses can show that the listener understands, agrees, is surprised by, is angered by, and more by what the speaker is saying. Backchannel communication is present in all cultures and languages, though frequency and use may vary. For example, backchannel responses are not only a key component of spoken languages but they are also important in sign languages. Another example of the variability that occurs in backchannel responses in different languages is that Germans produce less backchannel responses and use back channel responses less frequently. Confusion or distraction can occur during an intercultural encounter if participants from both parties are not accustomed to the same backchannel norms.Ward, Nigel G. and Yaffa Al Bayyari. \\"American and Arab Perceptions of an Arabic Turn-Taking Cue.\\" Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology (2010): 270-275. Studies have shown that when people learn a second language they learn or adapt to how people that are native speakers of that language use backchannel responses. This may occur in terms of the frequency that a person produces backchannel responses or what those responses sound like.  Types of backchannels  Due to research development in recent years, backchannel responses have been expanded to include sentence completions, requests for clarification, brief statements, and non-verbal responses and now fall into three categories: non-lexical, phrasal, and substantive.Young, Richard F. and Jina Lee. \\"Identifying units in interaction: Reactive tokens in Korean and English conversations.\\" Journal of Sociolinguistics (2004): 380-407.  Non-lexical backchannels  A non-lexical backchannel is a vocalized sound that has little or no referential meaning but still verbalizes the listener's attention, and that frequently co-occurs with gestures. In English, sounds like uh-huh and hmm serve this role. Non-lexical backchannels generally come from a limited set of sounds not otherwise widely used in contentful conversational speech; as a result, they can be used to express support, surprise, or a need for clarification at the same time as someone else's conversational turn without causing confusion or interference. English allows for the reduplication, or repetition, of syllables within a non-lexical backchannel, such as in responses like uh-huh, mm-hm, or um-hm, as well as for single-syllable backchanneling. In a study examining the use of two-syllable backchannels that focused on mm and mm-hm, Gardner found that the two tokens are generally not identical in function, with mm being used more productively as a continuer, a weak acknowledgment token, and a weak assessment marker. In contrast, mm-hm is generally used as a backchannel to signal that the speaker is yielding their conversational turn and allowing the other speaker to maintain control of the conversational floor.  Phrasal and substantive backchannels  Phrasal backchannels most commonly assess or acknowledge a speaker's communication with simple words or phrases (for example, \\"Really?\\" or \\"Wow!\\" in English). Substantive backchannels consist of more substantial turn-taking by the listener and usually manifest as asking for clarification or repetitions. One of the conversational functions of phrasal backchannels is to assess or appraise a previous utterance. Goodwin argues that this is the case for the phrasal backchannel oh wow, where use of the backchannel requires a specific conversational context where something unexpected or surprising was said. Similarly, more substantive backchannels such as oh come on, are you serious? require a context where the speaker is responding to something exasperating or frustrating. In both of these cases, Goodwin argues that the backchannels focus only on addressing some aspect of the immediately proceeding utterance rather than the larger conversation itself. As a result, they have a broad conversational distribution, appearing both in the middle of extended talk as well as at the end of longer conversational turns.  Recent research  Research in 2000 has pushed back on the notion of backchannels, in which the listener's role is merely to receive information provided by the speaker. Bavelas, Coates, and Johnson put forth evidence that listeners' responses help shape the content of the speaker. They grouped acknowledgment tokens into two categories: generic and specific. Generic responses could be considered back channels and would include mm hm and yeah, while specific responses would involve a reaction to the given context. Examples might include Oh! or a facial display of concern. They transcribed students telling a fellow participant about a close call experience that they had had. With one group of participants, they had the listener perform another task to distract them from the story being told. The researchers asked independent reviewers to code the verbal and visual responses of the narration events as generic or specific. They also asked other independent reviewers to gauge the quality of the narration in each case. They concluded that the responses from the distracted listeners included significantly fewer specific responses than from the undistracted listeners. In addition, they found that the quality of the narration was dramatically lower when the listener was distracted. Their basic contention was that listeners are co-narrators and help the storyteller in his or her narration. In other words, a storyteller tells a better story with an audience that is engaged than one that is not. Tolins and Foxtree have also published research demonstrating how backchannel communication influences speakers. Their research was specifically looking at how speakers respond to generic responses compared to specific responses. In 2017, Kyoto University's Graduate program of Informatics began developing a robot to assist individuals, more specifically the elderly, with mental health through the use of attentive listening. They utilized backchannel generation as a method for the robot to have some form of feedback to feel like a real conversation. Further research is being conducted to be more practical. In 1997 there was a study on 205,000 general utterances that showed 19% of those constituted a \\"backchannel\\". This study was a part of a new method of \\"discourse detection\\" and \\"statistical modeling\\" that allowed them to have such a large sample size, giving the possibility of generalizing this data to larger communities.

Description The peninsula occupies the south- eastern corner of Grande Terre, to which it is connected by the narrow, wide Haulage des Swains isthmus at its north-west end, and by the similarly narrow Haulage des Naufragés isthmus to Presqu'île Ronarc'h towards the eastern end of its north coast. It is about long from west to east and wide. Port Jeanne d'Arc is the site of an abandoned Norwegian whaling station at the western end of the peninsula's north coast that is subject to a cultural heritage conservation program. Important Bird Area The southern coast of the peninsula has been identified as a Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its breeding seabirds. It consists largely of cliffs that rise steeply from the shore to a height of over . To the east, a large glacial valley opens into the Baie de l’Antarctique. With the exception of the Canyon des Sourcils Noirs, at the eastern end of the site, which is regularly visited by scientists monitoring a study population of black-browed albatrosses, human presence is rare.BirdLife International.

They are undated, but were probably written during the 1260s, separately chastising one noblewoman and one nobleman for inappropriate activities. According to historians such as Hans E. Mayer and Peter W. Edbury, the letters were written in 1261 or 1262, and were intended for the Cypriote queen Plaisance of Antioch (1235-1261) and her lover John of Jaffa (1215-1266), who left his wife Marie of Armenia to pursue the relationship. Other historians such as David Nicolle, Steven Runciman and Christopher TyermanTyerman, pp. 728-729 believe that the date is more likely 1268, that the noblewoman was another Cypriot queen, Isabella of Ibelin (1252-1282), and it was her affair with Julian of Sidon (born c. 1230, d. 1275) that prompted the papal letters.Runciman. History of the Crusades. pp. 342-343 Audi filia et Audi filia et admonishes a dowager queen of Cyprus, telling her to give up her unchaste life because of the scandal it is causing among her subjects. She must either resume chastity or remarry, rather than burn in hell. It is not certain which queen is being referred to, but is likely either Plaisance of Antioch or Isabella of Ibelin. Queen Plaisance, who was widowed from King Henry I in 1253, married Balian of Arsuf and divorced him in 1258, and then had an affair with John of Jaffa. Isabella had been betrothed as a child to King Hugh II of Cyprus, who died in December 1267, leaving Isabella a teenaged widow who then engaged in an affair with Julian of Sidon. De sinu patris The other letter, De sinu patris, was addressed Nobili viro J. comiti to a count who had rejected his wife (a sister of the King of Armenia), and was engaged in an inappropriate relationship with an unnamed noblewoman. The count is ordered to cease his adultery and return to his family, or suffer the consequences. The recipient of this letter was likely John of Jaffa (married to Marie, a sister of King Hetoum I of Armenia), though some sources have identified the recipient as Julian of Sidon, who was married to Euthemia, King Hetoum I's daughter (and therefore sister of King Leo II of Armenia). A marginal note with the letter, arguitur de incestu quod dicebatur committere cum regina Cipri, stating it was not just an adulterous relationship but also an incestuous one, is probably referring to the fact that John of Jaffa was an Ibelin, grandson of Balian of Ibelin, and his mistress Isabella was Balian's great-great-granddaughter. At the time, this relationship meant they were forbidden to marry, and a sexual relationship would have therefore been regarded as incestuous. However, it is not clear who wrote the note, nor whether or not it is accurate. It may have simply been a misinterpretation at the time.

Written by Ali Adler and directed by co-creator Brad Falchuk, the episode aired on Fox in the United States on February 14, 2012, and features Valentine's Day love songs performed by the McKinley High glee club. It also features the debuts of special guest stars Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell as Rachel's two fathers and The Glee Project winner Samuel Larsen as transfer student Joe Hart. Whitney Houston's version of Dolly Parton's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" is performed by Mercedes (Amber Riley) in the episode, and the completed episode had been delivered to the network and was scheduled to run in three days when Houston died unexpectedly on February 11, 2012; a dedication to her was added in the episode's end credits. Reviewers gave Riley's rendition a very positive reception, the best of those given to the ten songs that were heard in the episode, though the performances in general were well received. It was one of two songs from the episode to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100, along with \\"Stereo Hearts\\", while the other six singles did not chart. Reviews of the episode varied widely, but there was more positive reaction than not. The greatest enthusiasm was for Rachel's fathers, though Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) was complimented on his brief scenes, and the scene with Kurt (Chris Colfer) and Karofsky (Max Adler) was also praised. The episode was also significant because it featured an on-screen kiss by Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris), which was the show's first lesbian kiss. Upon its initial airing, this episode was viewed by 6.99 million American viewers and received a 2.8/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic, the lowest rating of the third season to date. The total viewership was down over 11% from the previous episode, \\"The Spanish Teacher\\". Plot Will (Matthew Morrison) assigns the members of New Directions to perform the best love songs for Valentine's Day. Sugar (Vanessa Lengies) takes the opportunity to announce a Valentine's Day party, for which everyone must have a date, including herself. Artie (Kevin McHale) and Rory (Damian McGinty) both set out to woo Sugar with gifts, and she vacillates between them, so they move to song: Artie sings \\"Let Me Love You\\" and Rory, after he says he has been informed that his visa for a second year at McKinley has been denied, performs \\"Home\\". Sugar chooses Rory as her date. Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris) are about to kiss in the hall when Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) stops them. He tells them that he has received complaints about their public displays of affection, which Santana decries as a double standard, citing the much longer public kisses of Finn (Cory Monteith) and Rachel (Lea Michele). Quinn (Dianna Agron), Mercedes (Amber Riley) and Sam (Chord Overstreet) are members of a Christian club called the God Squad and decide to raise money by performing singing telegrams for Valentine's Day; their newest member is the previously home- schooled Joe Hart (Samuel Larsen), who is now a junior at McKinley. The group serenades Rachel with \\"Stereo Hearts\\" at Finn's behest. Santana then hires them to sing for Brittany, which sparks a discussion among squad members on the morality of homosexuality; Joe must decide whether he is comfortable delivering a singing telegram for a gay couple. Mercedes breaks up with Shane (LaMarcus Tinker), but she will not date Sam because she feels guilty for hurting Shane and wants to be sure of her own feelings. She performs \\"I Will Always Love You\\" as her song, and Sam leaves in tears. Finn and Rachel reveal their marriage plans to New Directions, most of whom are less than enthused. Rachel's two fathers Hiram and LeRoy Berry (Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell), along with Finn's mother Carole (Romy Rosemont) and his step-father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley), act very supportive and arrange for the couple to spend the night together in Rachel's room, expecting that the reality of having to live together will encourage the teens to postpone their wedding. The ruse backfires, and the engaged pair announce that they will be getting married even sooner than planned. Kurt has been receiving valentines and gifts all week from a secret admirer that he believes to be Blaine (Darren Criss), who is still home recovering from eye surgery. He arrives at Sugar's party early to discover his admirer is actually former bully Karofsky (Max Adler), who declares his love for Kurt. Kurt lets him down gently, but their parting words are overheard by a classmate of Karofsky's, and Karofsky flees. Once the party is underway, the God Squad delivers their singing telegram, a \\"Cherish / Cherish\\" mash-up, to Brittany on Santana's behalf, and the couple kisses. Sugar and Rory dance, but he is confused by her saying that she will miss him when he has to leave. Blaine arrives, having finally recovered, to lead the group in singing \\"Love Shack\\". Production \\"Heart\\" is the second episode to be written by co-executive producer Ali Adler, and it was directed by co- creator Brad Falchuk. It commenced filming on January 13, 2012, the same day that the eleventh episode, the Michael Jackson tribute episode, completed its final musical number, and while the twelfth episode was being filmed, which had begun on January 5, 2012. The episode completed its filming with two musical numbers on January 31, 2012. On December 8, 2011, it was reported that the show had begun casting Rachel's two fathers. It was not until January 17, 2012, that the actors playing Hiram and LeRoy Berry were identified as Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell, respectively. Two days later they were on the set, shooting their first scenes with Lea Michele, who tweeted a picture of the three of them. The appearance was long in coming, and Goldblum and Stokes Mitchell were not the first actors cast in those roles, though they are the first to appear on screen. A scene had been written in 2009 for the second episode, \\"Showmance\\", that featured Rachel's fathers, but it was subsequently cut from the script even though the actors had already been cast and reported for work. Shortly before the final nine episodes of the first season were to begin airing, co-creator Ryan Murphy, when asked at PaleyFest in March 2010 whether her fathers would be appearing, replied: \\"Not this season. We've never met them; I think that's a great surprise. I think you want to hold that a little bit.\\" Between the second and third seasons, co-creator Ian Brennan said, \\"It's tricky with parents\\", referenced the scene cut from \\"Showmance\\", and noted, \\"we've talked about it forever, about different sets of parents\\", but \\"when you're in high school, your parents stop being the major influence in your life\\". He then added, \\"I think soon we'll probably reveal more and more\\". \\"Heart\\" is dedicated to Whitney Houston, who died three days before the episode aired. The second of the two winners of The Glee Project seven-episode arc, Samuel Larsen, debuts in this episode as a new transfer student to McKinley named Joe Hart. Larsen had arrived on the set by January 17, 2012, according to Cory Monteith, who described Larsen's role as one that \\"ties into a lot of preexisting storylines\\", and \\"a smart way to bring him into the show\\". Larsen's first day of filming with the glee club was January 25, 2012, and a number of his fellow actors tweeted of his arrival, including Lea Michele, Dianna Agron, and fellow Glee Project winner Damian McGinty. Although it was originally thought that Darren Criss would be missing \\"one and a half episodes\\", and therefore might return in time to appear in this episode after missing the twelfth one, co-star Chris Colfer initially stated that Criss would not be appearing: \\"You'll find out how [Blaine] leaves for a little bit and then comes back, but it’s nothing too bad or serious\\". He later said that Blaine \\"is in the episode, it's not in the way you might think\\"; Criss did return in time to appear in the musical finale. Recurring guest stars who are appearing in the episode include glee club members Sam Evans (Overstreet), Rory Flanagan (McGinty) and Sugar Motta (Lengies), Principal Figgins (Theba), Finn's mother Carole Hudson-Hummel (Rosemont) and stepfather Burt Hummel (O'Malley), former McKinley student Dave Karofsky (Adler) and McKinley football player Shane Tinsley (Tinker). The episode features cover versions of ten songs, nine of which have been released as eight singles available for downloading, with the two-song mash-up released as one single, but no release of \\"Chapel of Love\\", which was heard in only a brief snippet on the show. Performances include Nat King Cole's \\"L-O-V-E\\" sung by Jenna Ushkowitz and Harry Shum, Jr.; Dolly Parton's \\"I Will Always Love You\\" in the style of the Whitney Houston cover version sung by Riley; \\"Stereo Hearts\\" by Gym Class Heroes featuring Adam Levine sung by Larsen, Overstreet and Riley; and Mario's \\"Let Me Love You\\" sung by McHale. Other songs that are featured include Cole Porter's \\"You're the Top\\" from the musical Anything Goes, \\"Love Shack\\" by The B-52's, Michael Bublé's \\"Home\\", and a mash-up of two songs entitled \\"Cherish\\": The Association song and the Madonna song. Whitney Houston died unexpectedly on February 11, 2012, three days before the episode was scheduled to air and the day after the finished episode was delivered to the network. The producers subsequently announced that they would pay tribute to Houston with a dedication to her in the end credits. Reception Ratings \\"Heart\\" was first broadcast on February 14, 2012 in the United States on Fox. It received a 2.8/8 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic, and attracted 6.99 million American viewers during its initial airing, a significant decrease from the 3.3/9 rating/share and 7.81 million viewers of the previous episode, which was broadcast on February 7, 2012, and the lowest rating of the third season to date. In Canada, however, viewership increased, and 1.72 million viewers watched the episode on the same day as its American premiere.

Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summed up their appearance as \\"annoyingly perfect\\", and TV Guide Kate Stanhope devoted an entire article to the pair, wrote, \\"What's not to like? Seamless chemistry, witty back-and-forth\\", and noted that their appearance filled out Rachel's backstory. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was another who pointed out that you could see, from their characterization, \\"how Rachel got to be the way she was\\". Billboard Rae Votta approved of the episode as a whole and of the Berry parents: \\"For a pair that have been noticeably absent from the show for two and a half seasons, they cram a ton of character moments into a single scene\\". VanDerWerff wrote that the scheme by the Berry fathers \\"to get the two to break off their marriage plans by talking earnestly about teenage lovemaking\\" was \\"very, very creepy and just a little unsound, but I sort of like that it suggests to me that, yeah, this is who these guys are.\\" He characterized Hiram and LeRoy as \\"goofy sitcom characters\\", unlike Burt or Carole. Kevin Sullivan of MTV stated that Principal Figgins \\"stole the show with his outburst and the passing reference to Finchel\\", and VanDerWerff said his was \\"a very funny moment in the episode\\", and also complimented the sequence for having alluded to \\"how it’s still much harder to have a same-sex kiss on a broadcast network than it is to have Rachel and Finn neck disgustingly\\". The God Squad, however, was not well received: Canning described it as \\"conveniently arriving for the sake of one storyline in this episode\\" and debating \\"a forced issue that we all knew would result in acceptance\\", and VanDerWerff pointed out that as \\"we already know how the other three kids are going to shake out\\", it was \\"surprisingly undramatic\\" and its sole purpose to \\"watch a new character decide if he's okay with gay people\\". Futterman, on the other hand, felt that the sequence \\"tastefully incorporated religion's views into the show's ongoing look at gay relationships\\". While the sequence featuring Mercedes singing \\"I Will Always Love You\\" was very well received, Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch was not happy about the state of Mercedes and Sam's relationship: \\"If these two don't get together soon, I'm voting we just call the whole thing off, because I'm tired of these false starts.\\" VanDerWerff, referring to the third member of that romantic triangle, wrote that one of the two \\"tertiary characters\\" he responded to most was \\"Shane, who didn’t say anything but gave good cry-face\\". VanDerWerff's other character was Karofsky, and Michael Slezak of TVLine characterized his scene with Kurt as \\"electric, with Kurt tenderly giving the 'just friends' speech to Dave\\". Lynch thought the plot of having Karofsky be Kurt's secret admirer was \\"vaguely stalker-ish on Karofsky's part, and contrived on the part of the show\\", and Canning accurately predicted that after Karofsky had been seen by his classmate, it would \\"just be an episode or two before Karofsky gets bullied into thinking about suicide, if not actually taking his own life\\". Music and performances Amber Riley was acclaimed for her performance of \\"I Will Always Love You\\" The theme of the episode—love songs—inspired VanDerWerff to note that such songs \\"are great for musicals because they pretty much do all of the work necessary in terms of expressing inner emotions and moving the plot forward\\". He said that \\"every song in this episode had a clear emotional and plot purpose\\" except for the \\"Love Shack\\" finale. Futterman wrote that the glee club succeeded in finding and performing \\"the world's greatest love songs\\", and the reactions from other reviewers were generally favorable as well. With the death of Whitney Houston three days before the episode aired, a great deal of attention was given to Amber Riley's performance of Houston's hit during the episode, \\"I Will Always Love You\\", and its unexpected function as a tribute to the singer. Reviews were glowing: Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times called it a \\"gorgeous, lush take\\" that was \\"definitely an episode highlight\\", and Bell described is as \\"a beautiful cover\\", \\"the perfect song for Mercedes to sing to Sam\\" and a \\"haunting performance\\". Flandez wrote that it was a \\"heart-rending love song that becomes a homage of the 48-year-old fallen star\\", and \\"brought goosebumps\\"; the shot near the end, \\"of Mercedes dressed in a sweetheart gown, standing alone, reaching for the stars, was memorable\\". The Washington Post Jen Chaney said that \\"Riley deserves a standing ovation\\", and that she sang the song with \\"a power motivated by genuine emotions that tied in directly to her storyline\\"; the \\"heartbreaking context of Houston's death ... immediately elevated this moment to the very best one of Glee entire third season.\\" In December 2012, TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee best performances. Chaney characterized Tina and Mike's duet of \\"L-O-V-E\\" as \\"cute and buoyant\\" and gave it an \\"A−\\", and Bell called it \\"absolute perfection\\". While Slezak praised their \\"sweet vocals\\", he wondered why their \\"rare moment in the spotlight had to serve as a backdrop to the Artie-Sugar-Rory triangle\\" and gave the performance a \\"B\\". Chaney thought the \\"quick edits actually gave the song a nice energy, but also prevented us from seeing more of Tina and Mike dancing\\", which she said \\"was a shame\\". Flandez and Lynch both praised Mike's singing; Lynch said his \\"voice sounded great\\", and Flandez declared that \\"Mike has really come into his own as a singer\\". For \\"Let Me Love You\\", Lynch wrote that \\"Artie busted out some serious sex appeal\\" and gave the \\"spot-on smooth\\" performance a \\"B+\\". He also described Artie as \\"effortlessly convincing\\" on the song. Slezak bestowed an \\"A−\\" and said, \\"Artie finally finds an R&B; jam that lets him get his swag on and fits his voice to a tee!\\" Votta made mention of \\"Kurt, Sam, Puck and Mike doing an impressive job as boyband style backup\\", but Chaney called the performance, including the choreography, \\"underwhelming\\" and gave it a \\"C\\" grade. Futterman noted that \\"Rory's a natural to sing Bublé\\" on \\"Home\\" and Chaney said he \\"sang it nicely enough\\", but neither expressed much enthusiasm about the rendition, and Chaney gave it a \\"C\\" grade. Slezak and Lynch were slightly more generous with their matching grades of \\"C+\\", but were also unimpressed: Lynch declared it \\"too schmaltzy for my tastes\\", and Slezak admitted he doesn't \\"get\\" McGinty. The two songs sung by Hiram and LeRoy Berry received little comment, in part due to their brevity. Chaney was disappointed that \\"Chapel of Love\\" was so brief, while Lynch called it \\"acceptably fun\\", and similarly approved of \\"You're the Top\\", which he called \\"goofy, lighthearted family fun\\". Futterman characterized the latter song as \\"appropriately over-the-top\\", though Slezak maintained that \\"no gay dads in the world would perform this song with their teenage daughter\\". The pair of performances by the McKinley High God Squad, however, received rather more attention. The first, \\"Stereo Hearts\\", received a trio of \\"B−\\" grades from reviewers: Chaney said it was \\"a bit much\\" but \\"semi-enjoyable\\", Slezak described it as a \\"somewhat bland rendition\\", and Lynch wrote that \\"Joe Hart's vocal debut on Glee proper was fine, but Sam's rapping was not\\". Bell said \\"Mercedes was flawless\\" and then called the song's rapping \\"one major flaw\\", but Futterman wrote that \\"Sam wins for most surprising Glee vocalist by convincingly taking on Travie McCoy's rap\\". Flandez said that the \\"voices melded well together\\". The \\"Cherish\\" mash-up was better received, and garnered grades from \\"B\\" up to \\"A−\\", the highest from Slezak, who deemed it a \\"delicious\\" dessert. Lynch said \\"Quinn sounded great\\" with his \\"B\\" grade, and Chaney's \\"peppy, sweet number\\" was attached to a \\"B+\\". Flandez called it a \\"cute mashup\\", and VanDerWerff said the rendition was \\"nice and understated\\". Hankinson, despite his criticism of the episode, liked \\"Love Shack\\" so much it was his favorite song of the episode, and Futterman called it a \\"well-executed note\\" on which to end the show. Both Lynch and Slezak said that Blaine failed to project the campiness the song required, and that they were glad Kurt took over from him. Their grades were quite different: Slezak gave a \\"C−\\", while Lynch, who complimented Mercedes as well as Kurt, bestowed a \\"B+\\". Chaney was more enthusiastic than both and gave the \\"rousing\\" cover an \\"A\\": she was enthusiastic about Criss \\"bebopping all over the place\\", and also noted that \\"the most entertaining all-company performances on Glee are the ones where it's clear how much fun everyone had during filming\\".

It is designed for true anterior/subcoracoid glenohumeral dislocations in patients who can fully adduct their humerus.https://dislocation.com.au/cunningham This is distinct from anteroinferior/subglenoid glenohumeral dislocations for which alternative techniques should be used.https://dislocation.com.au/algorithmic-approach-1 The method is one of several techniques used for shoulder reduction. Mechanism Shoulder dislocation is a common complication of upper limb trauma (arm pulled while in abduction or direct impact to shoulder) resulting with the humeral head sitting anteriorly out of the glenoid fossa. Technique is as follows:https://dislocation.com.au/cunningham Step 1 Sit patient up (without slouching, towel or pillow down spine) and place into analgesic position. ‘Hold’- take control of the affected limb with a 'hold.' This is a firm steady downward hold (not a pull) designed to move the humeral head towards where it needs to be, taking off some of the stretch from the capsule (reducing pain), and providing confidence to the patient that you have taken control of the limb. Once you are in this position, it can be useful to ask the patient their pain level, and explain again what you are going to do. It’s important to note that the elbow is not being supported from below, but is being placed in a downwards ‘hold’. The affected arm is adducted (next to the body) and the elbow fully flexed (optimally shortens the biceps muscle, allowing full relaxation) The humerus points directly down and should be in a neutral position (no forward flexion or external rotation). Ask the patient to “shoulders back, chest out.” (reducing scapular anteversion and so reducing the static obstruction of the glenoid rim). Kneel next to your patient and place your wrist onto their forearm, with their hand resting on your shoulder. Step 2 Massage the biceps. Ask your patient to again put “shoulders back, chest out” and relax. Massage the biceps (gently) at mid humeral level. Wait for your patient to fully relax and the humeral head slips back into place. Tell your patient that they will feel “strange” as the joint slips back in and not to fight this movement. Continue to gently move the humerus forwards and back in order to find the perfect angle, and provide a small amount of momentum to allow the head to slide across the glenoid. Step 3 anterior/posterior humeral movements. The humerus can then be gently moved forwards and back in order to find the perfect angle, and provide a small amount of momentum to allow the head to slide across the glenoid. This combines the principle of overcoming the movement inertia with the apposition of the slippery articular surfaces of the glenoid rim and the humeral head.  Success  If performed correctly most patients do not require analgesia for the performance of this technique. Inappropriate use of traction will result in pain for the patient with subsequent spasm and failure to reduce. If the patient is unable to adduct the humerus, or unable to cooperate with positioning, the technique should not be attempted. The patient may require analgesia or sedation if they are in pain or unable to relax spasming muscles.

It also references Thor and King Arthur having adventures in Eden. Background Cover The spine of the book features a swastika \\"imprinted in gold color\\". The swastika was chosen because of it being a \\"Sun-cult symbol to the Phoenicians and Hittites\\", two subjects covered in the book. The front of the book features an image of the Snake Goddess from the Boston Goddess collection. According to Waddell the statuette was first created in 2700 B.C. as an example of \\"Eve or Ifo, Gunn-Ifo or Guen-Ever, as Serpent-Priestess of Eden before marriage with King Her-Thor, Arthur, or Adam\\". He also stated his belief that the Snake Goddess was from a representation of \\"prototypes\\" from Sumerian and Hittite gods, rather than from Crete as is commonly thought. Title The title of the book, The British Edda, was chosen because of Waddell's belief that the work upon which his translation was based, the Elder Edda, was mistakenly believed by many to be written in Scandinavian. Waddell, meanwhile, objected to this, explaining that the language had been found to be from an Icelandic family that had originally come from Scotland. Due to this, Waddell used the word British in the title to emphasize where the Elder Edda had come from. Waddell also went on to state that many other Eddic poems had been written in the British Isles before and up to the 6th century, but that most of them had been eradicated in the 11th century by Christian missionaries, contributing to the confusion. Content One of the subjects discussed in The British Edda is the \\"genesis of civilization\\", which, as stated by Waddell, was commonly believed in the \\"pagan days\\" in Britain to be in \\"Cappadocia and Eden\\", but was very broad due to the lack of knowledge about the region beyond mere stories and also no knowledge of specific place names. This oral tradition of stories was written down on \\"parchment by 'the Learned'\\", composed into what is known as the Elder Edda. Waddell also explained that other works that copied down the stories were made, but all of these had been destroyed by Christian missionaries in Britain, leaving only the one work. These stories returned to the common populace in the 12th century by being melded into the \\"Arthurian legends\\", while the original sources of Cappadocia, the Trojans, and Sumeria were lost. Legacy Waddell's writings on the origins of civilization would soon after influence the poetry of Hugh MacDiarmid from 1937 on, impressing on him the belief that the \\"original impetus to civilization was an Ur-Gaelic initiative\\". This belief was later incorporated into his poems, such as in The Fingers of Baal Contract in the Communist Salute. In two letters Charles Olson wrote to Frances Boldereff in July 1950, Olson discussed Waddell's works and specifically commented on The British Edda, stating that, in it, Waddell \\"dances all over this thing, like some damned witch doctor, trying to squeeze out the old and lost history\\", referring to the discussion in the book on how the Sumerians were the origination of civilization. The British Edda and one of Waddell's other works, The Makers of Civilization in Race and History, would go on to inspire Olson's essay titled \\"The Gate and the Center\\".

Field & Stream, November 1997, p. 113 In it, Cooper uses short chapters to teach about both physical and mental preparedness for successful rifle shooting, whether for defense, hunting, or competition. His goal was to help the rifle shooter be accurate at any time or place.Long Range Hunting on rifle accuracy Col. Cooper was particularly well known for his pistol shooting expertise,*Cameron Hopkins, Jeff Cooper: Father of modern pistol shooting. American Rifleman. May 18, 2011 popularizing the widely used “Weaver stance” and establishing a large training center in Arizona for military, law enforcement and civilians interested in gaining skill with firearms and defense techniques.David Petzal. Shootout at Gunsite. Field & Stream, July 2002, p.102 Col. Cooper also authored at least half a dozen other books related to shooting since the 1950s. As of 2012, The Art of the Rifle was still in print in hardcover, softcover and electronic formats. Rifle common sense The Art of the Rifle suggests reasons for owning a rifle. These include the defense of oneself or one's country. A rifle can also be used to properly fell an animal while hunting. A rifle is used to compete in target shooting matches or just for personal enjoyment. It is important for the rifle to be comfortable for the shooter. Cooper suggests that if the rifle is uncomfortable to hold out from the body with the right arm for a minute, it is too heavy. The general rules of firearm safety apply before, during, and after use of the firearm. The general safety rules are: all guns are always loaded, never point the muzzle toward anything you are not willing to destroy, keep your finger off the trigger until the sights are on the target, and be sure of your target and what is beyond. Trajectory: curve of a bullet in flight A bullet in flight is in projectile motion, meaning no other forces are acting on it except the acceleration due to gravity (and sometimes wind). When a bullet leaves the muzzle, it not only travels forward, but also begins to fall due to the influence of gravity. The downward acceleration is constant and does not depend on how fast the bullet leaves the muzzle. Therefore, in order for a shooter to aim at a distant target and then hit it, the actual trajectory, or path that the bullet follows is a curve, not a straight line. That is, the bullet is shot at a slightly upward angle, and the goal of sighting in the rifle is to match the vertical position of the bullet on the downward part of its trajectory with the target. This is the reason why rifles are sighted in for specific target distances. This means that the sights are adjusted so that the bullet will hit the location on the target viewed in the center of the sights at a known distance. When shooting at a target significantly closer or farther than the distance for which the rifle was sighted in, the shooter must know about how much higher or lower than the center of the sights the bullet will hit and adjust the aim accordingly. The study of bullet trajectories after they leave the firearm is known as external ballistics. Positioning of the body while shooting Cooper instructs that, in the field, the shooting position taken depends on the situation. A standing position would be used when the hunter has to shoot over brush. The animal has usually spotted the hunter and is on the move. The standing position is the least stable of all shooting positions. The kneeling position can also be used when brush is in the way, but the animal is usually unaware of the hunter. It is somewhat steady. The hunter can use shooting sticks or a bi-pod to support the front of the gun while in the position. A rest can also be used in the sitting position. The sitting position is more accurate than the kneeling position; however it is not as quickly assumed. Shooters in the prone position are usually on a somewhat flat surface. Prone is the most comfortable of all the shooting positions, but it takes the longest to assume. The rest positions used in the field can be almost anywhere. The different shooting positions can be used to take advantage of the rest opportunities. The fork in a tree, a rock, a log, a stump; any of these can be used to steady the gun and show a clearer sight picture. The shooter's right hand should be such that the index finger is above the trigger, but can be adjusted quickly to fire the weapon. The shooter's left hand is usually steadying the firearm in front of the trigger system. When adjusting the position of the crosshairs on a scope, the shooter should keep their “good” eye open. This is the eye that the shooter is the most comfortable with. Switching eyes is not recommended. Breathing techniques vary, however most prefer to exhale before the shot. The rifle will move the slightest bit when you breathe, so practice is great to determine the breathing patterns while shooting. The shooting sling can be used to carry a gun when it is more efficient to do so. The gun can be slung muzzle up over the shoulder, or muzzle down. Keeping the firearm pointed in a safe direction is extremely important when using a shooting sling. The shooting sling can also be used to steady the firearm in the sitting, kneeling, or standing positions.Rifle Accuracy Reports on shooting positions Some shooting competitions are designed to test the ability of the shooter in several positions. The International Shooting Sports Federation (ISSF) recognizes four, three-position events. Two of these events, both called 50 m Rifle, are shot in the Olympics, one for men, the other for women. The two Olympic events are shot with a rimfire rifle at 50m. The two three position events not in the Olympics, 300 m Rifle and 300 m Standard Rifle, are shot with a centerfire rifle at a distance of 300m. Being prepared for different situations Cooper insists that practice is the only way to prepare for a situation that requires a quick shot. When that situation arises, the gun is usually not ready. Quickly raising the gun, loading, aiming, and firing take time. When the situation comes, the shooter will be better prepared is he/she practices the scenarios beforehand. If time allows, sighting in the firearm is important. The scope needs to be adjusted for different ranges, so knowing the expected range beforehand is helpful. Knowing the direction and force of the wind is also important. For a moving target, keeping as steady a sight picture as possible is paramount. Keeping the rifle steady and at the same latitude is good. If the target is moving in longitude, adjustments need to be made. If the target is moving directly toward or away from the shooter, the rifle should not need to be moved side to side. In the case of a rifle, Cooper suggests that keeping the chamber empty is usually a good idea for safety considerations. However, loading quickly can make the difference between life and death. Keeping the ammunition on the shooters person in a readily accessible position minimizes the time taken fumbling for it. Practicing the slide or action of the rifle gives the shooter a better idea of how smoothly he/she can gain access to the chamber. Putting in the round and closing the access point can be difficult. Practice smooths the process considerably. Mindset If the shooter gets too excited, necessary concentration will be lost. Concentrating on the task at hand is more important than worrying or what ifs. The celebrating and adrenaline rush need to be kept in check. Professionalism needs to be kept right after the shot as well, in case a second shot is needed. Every hunter dreams of killing the target in one shot. Even if the shooter is confident that the target is mortally wounded, quickly reloading before checking to see if the animal has dropped can make the difference between possessing the target and having the target get away because of premature celebration. Practicing before the hunt or shooting match will hone or refresh marksmanship skills. Practicing from different positions can prepare the shooter for many of the situations that could arise. Every aspect of practice is important to performance in an actual situation.Cooper, Jeff, The Art of the Rifle, Paladin Press, Boulder, Colorado, 1997.

She is portrayed by Diana DeGarmo, who is famed for being runner-up on the third season of the reality television competition American Idol. She was introduced by former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell on October 31, 2011, as the daughter of mob boss Angelo Veneziano (Mike Starr). Angelina was described as a mob boss daughter and aspiring singer by Zap2it. DeGarmo described her as an over-the-top \\"jersey girl\\", and noted her flamboyant costumes and voice. The show's executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell offered DeGarmo the role of Veneziano after seeing her performance of Penny Pingleton in the musical production of Hairspray. Originating from New Jersey, Angelina arrived in Genoa City, Wisconsin to be with her father Angelo. She also wanted to fulfill her new-found dreams of becoming a recording artist. Her father hired music producer Devon Hamilton (Bryton James) to create her music. However, it was soon evident that she lacked in talent. She developed a crush on Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), which she takes to extreme heights, conning him into a short- lived marriage with the help of her father. Angelina eventually achieved her musical dream, having released a song entitled \\"Good Goodbye\\" which was written and produced by DeGarmo. The song was about how the character evolved into a better person when she left, and detailed her \\"emotional journey\\". DeGarmo said that she had finally gotten rid of her selfish ways and expressed this through music. After a five-month stint on the series, on March 27, 2012, Angelina left Genoa City to further pursue her music career in Los Angeles. Described as \\"mafia princess\\" and an alter ego, TV Guide credited her as being comedic relief for the daytime drama. However, Luke Kerr of Zap2it was not receptive of the character's Jersey Shore concept, criticizing the soap opera for it. DeGarmo likened Angelina's transformation to My Fair Lady. Casting On September 12, 2011, it was announced that DeGarmo was to join the cast of The Young and the Restless in the contract role of \\"jersey girl\\" Angelina. DeGarmo is well known for placing second on the third season of the reality television competition, American Idol. After her departure from American Idol, she ventured into on-stage musicals. Upon Angelina's debut on the show, it was revealed that she would be romantically linked to Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). According to Entertainment Weekly, \\"Angelina, wants to be a singer – but she's not exactly good at it.\\" DeGarmo began filming scenes on September 22, with her first airdate being October 31, 2011. Speaking about how she landed the role of Angelina, DeGarmo said that she was doing a special performance of the musical Hairspray at the Hollywood Bowl for three nights that August, to which head writer Maria Arena Bell had attended. She stated: According to CBS Soaps In Depth DeGarmo said: \\"I'm definitely spicing things up! Angelina is getting into a bit of shenanigans and trouble along the way, just to make sure people are on their toes.\\" Additionally, she noted that: \\"Angelina may have a little bit of a crush on Kevin and she is not afraid to show it.\\" CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: \\"viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City.\\" DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was \\"super excited\\" about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast- paced it was, stating: \\"I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have to give my best performance at that very moment.\\" She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: \\"Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can be a bit of a stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to take a chance on me. They are so fantastic.\\" Development Characterization TV Guide introduced Angelina as: \\"the Jersey girl daughter of mob boss Angelo Veneziano (Mike Starr). She comes to Genoa City with dreams of being a chart-topping vocalist. And what Angelina wants, Angelina gets!\\" Fred Bronson of The Hollywood Reporter noted that DeGarmo already had experience of playing the part of a \\"Jersey Girl\\" because she had once starred in the musical The Toxic Avenger, which is set in New Jersey. Bronson also noted that she was having a fun time playing the part. Describing Angelina, DeGarmo labeled her as \\"over- the-top\\" and a \\"gum-smacking, tone-deaf princess whose hair is as large as her attitude.\\" She said \\"I'm having a blast! Angelina believes she's Barbra Streisand mixed with Celine Dion.\\" The character is described as an alter ego by DeGarmo. DeGarmo revealed that she was having a \\"blast\\" picking out costumes for the over-the-top part: \\"Her hair and make-up are icing on the cake\\" she stated. Additionally, she noted that \\"Angelina’s style has taken a few notes from the cast of Jersey Shore.\\" Comparing Angelina to herself, she said: \\"There are some things that I, Diana, would be too terrified to walk out of the house wearing, but Angelina is not afraid.\\" She is also described as a \\"mafia princess\\". DeGarmo said: \\"You never know what she's going to do, which keeps everyone on their toes. One minute she's nice, the next she snaps\\". According to DeGarmo, Angelina is fully aware that her father is a mob boss and: \\"she doesn't mind. She likes throwing around her weight at any time. She loves the perks of being a mob boss's daughter. She lives for it.\\" Also, her character was probably based on Angela Viracco, in the 1985 movie The Last Dragon.  Music career  Angelina's dream is to be a successful singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, \\"who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels\\" puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: \\"Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people.\\" DeGarmo commented: \\"It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!\\" She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: \\"the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them.\\" Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed \\"skill to play a bad singer\\", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: \\"but it's really liberating to get out there and be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus.\\" Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track. As her time on the show was nearing its end, it was announced that DeGarmo was to debut a country ballad song entitled \\"Good Goodbye\\". Kelly Ballhorn of Ryanseacrest.com noted that: \\"Fans of 'Young and the Restless' and Diana have been waiting for her to sing on the show like she can in real life ... well, the wait’s over\\". \\"Good Goodbye\\" was co-written by DeGarmo and her real-life fiance Ace Young, who was also a competitor on American Idol, and details Angelina's \\"emotional journey\\" on the show. She was approached by the show's award-winning composer David Kurtz, and he asked her to make a song for Angelina. Rodney Ho of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said: \\"It’s supposed to be a turning point to her character. Her character on the most part has been pushy and full of herself.\\" During an interview with TV Guide, DeGarmo said that the song will \\"tug at your heartstrings\\" and marks a big turning point for Angelina's storyline: \\"where she's finally starting to grow up. She's coming to realize that she needs to get rid of her selfish ways. She doesn't know how to go about that like a normal person, so she does it through song.\\"  Relationship with Kevin Fisher  Greg Rikaart plays Kevin Fisher, Angelina's crush, who eventually becomes her husband. When she first arrived in Genoa City, Angelina set her eyes on Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), whom she developed a huge crush on. Of her crazy crush, DeGarmo said: \\"Ooh, she wants him bad! Angie has her eyes, her heart and her body set on landing Kevin — and it scares him to death.\\" She said that Kevin was too sweet and nervous, and is weakened to Angelina's preying on him. \\"She loves seeing him squirm\\" DeGarmo stated. Of working with Rikaart, she said: \\"Greg and I can't stop laughing during our scenes together.\\" During an interview with MSN, she stated: \\"I've had the great pleasure sharing the screen with Mr. Greg Rikaart. Angelina gets a little bit of a crush on Kevin, and she's not afraid not to show it. It's a blast, because she makes him incredibly nervous The sparks that fly on screen are just hilarious. It's wonderful to be a part of.\\" Just before Kevin was set to marry his girlfriend Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson), Angelina persuaded him to help her escape town, as she was in danger. They returned home safe. Eventually, things got to the stage where Angelina's father forced Kevin to marry his daughter. Becca Badget of Yahoo! wrote: \\"Kevin keeps to himself that he married Angelina to avoid a bullet from Angelo's henchman. The guests are unaware that he married her to stay alive.\\" While this happened, Kevin's mother Gloria Bardwell (Judith Chapman) was involved with Angelo, who had kidnapped and sent away her husband Jeffrey Bardwell (Ted Shackelford) to have Gloria for himself. On whether or not Kevin will ever love her, DeGarmo said: \\"I know she sure hopes so. She did try to get him to marry her.\\" The relationship, however, ended when Angelina realizes that he never loved her. DeGarmo said: \\"Kevin does see the light inside Angelina, even though that light may be a little dim sometimes.\\"  Storylines  Angelina was introduced as Angelo's daughter who had a dream of becoming a successful recording artist. Angelo's girlfriend Gloria requested that music producer Devon should help her out, only for everyone to find out she had no talent. Angelina developed a crush on Gloria's son, Kevin Fisher, who was already engaged to his girlfriend Chloe. Angelina attempted to seduce Kevin, making Chloe hate her. Angelo put Kevin in charge of keeping Angelina safe from her dangerous ex-boyfriend Carmine Basco (Marco Dapper). Devon found out that Angelina sang well only if staring into Kevin's eyes. At Kevin and Chloe's wedding, Angelina told Kevin that she was pregnant with Carmine's child and that they needed to leave town immediately. Kevin ran away with her after shots were fired during the wedding ceremony. They set out on a journey to get away from Carmine, first going to a hotel near Niagara Falls. Hearing of this, Angelo assumed that Kevin wanted to win over Angelina, and sent over his friend Dino to \\"break his legs\\". They fled to Angelo's fishing cabin on an island where a homeless man is living. It is later revealed to be Gloria's estranged husband Jeffrey who had been kidnapped and sent away by Angelo, but lost memory of it. Jeffrey stole their motor boat, leaving them stranded there. Angelina then finally revealed to Kevin that she was never pregnant and faked the ordeal so that he would fall in love with her. Dino arrives at the Island and nearly killed Kevin, but Angelina tells him he can't because she will be married to Kevin. Because of this, Kevin reluctantly had to marry her at a ceremony in Glowarm because Angelo forced him. Kevin was extremely miserable and told Chloe that the marriage was a sham. Angelo told Kevin that he would hurt Chloe if he didn't devote himself wholeheartedly to Angelina. While at a bar at Jimmy's, Angelina revealed to him that she really does love him, and he admits to her that he doesn't, breaking her heart. The marriage ended and Angelina confessed to tricking Kevin into marrying her. They are officially divorced and she released a song entitled \\"Good Goodbye\\". She made sure that Chloe and Kevin get back together. She left Genoa City to further pursue her music career in Los Angeles, with Angelo as her manager. Moments after they leave, Angelina's infamous ex-boyfriend Carmine arrived and threatened that he is going to steal Chloe from Kevin because Kevin \\"stole\\" Angelina from him. Carmine ended up kidnapping Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan). Days after he kidnapped her, they ended up falling love and returned to Genoa City.  Reception  The character's reception has been mixed. Upon DeGarmo joining the show, Luke Kerr of Zap2It was not receptive of the character's concept. He compared her to Snooki of the reality television series Jersey Shore and said that the show has fallen under Jersey Shore's \\"drunken spell\\". He wrote: \\"Regardless of who portrayed the character—because I have absolutely nothing against DeGarmo—why does Y&R; need yet another big name stunt cast?\\" Additionally, he said: \\"every time I read something about the new character I find myself asking myself why, just why?\\" DeGarmo said: \\"Angelina nor I need to watch ‘Jersey Shore’ for pointers. But we are fans. Definitely Snooki is someone we look up to.\\" Before the character aired, Deanna Barnert of MSN TV said of DeGarmo: \\"The young songstress may even prove there's something more dangerous than a mob wife or a \\"Jersey Shore\\" diva: a mob daughter.\\" Michael Logan of TV Guide praised DeGarmo and Angelina as comic relief for the show. Lynette Rice of Entertainment Weekly regarded Angelina as Angelo's ambitious \\"little angel\\" and called DeGarmo's casting as \\"not exactly the next Mariah Carey\\" a \\"bit of a twist\\". Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music called her a: \\"gum- smacking mob princess with a heart of gold\\".

It was first published in Galaxy Magazine in 1953 and has been anthologised many times. It was included in the anthology The Golden Age of Science Fiction. Plot Humanity is spreading rapidly through the galaxy, and a planet known as Glade has been identified as suitable for colonization as it has a near-Earth climate (and presumably near-Earth gravity and atmosphere). A colonisation expedition lands on Glade; one rocket contains the potential colonists and their equipment, whilst a second rocket returns to Earth to confirm the suitability of the planet and bring more settlers. Under the energetic leadership of Executive Hafner, the colonists start to assemble agricultural equipment and prepare for planting fast-growing crops that they will need to survive. But biologist Dano Marin is already concerned that all is not as it should be. Biological controls have previously surveyed the planet, without actually landing, and cleared it as being benign, but very soon mice appear and attack the crops and food stocks. Attempts are made to control them, but they then appear in plague proportions. Marin thinks he knows what has happened. The apparently harmless native lifeform, which he dubs the 'omnimal', has the ability to adapt to threats as they appear. They can mutate and reproduce with amazing speed. As the mice are brought under control by robot cats, they are replaced with rats who attack one of the cats en masse and manage to destroy it. The humans bring in terriers to fight the rats, but this only stops them temporarily. They are then further replaced by tiger-like creatures. Marin now knows what the next mutation will be and is proved right when food again goes missing from the fields. With Hafner only partially convinced, he seeks out the new creature. Hafner wants to shoot it, but Marin convinces him not to, knowing that a further mutated creature will be unstoppable. They come face-to-face with the creature and the story ends with the line: \\"It looked very much like a man.\\" In other media \\"Student Body\\" was adapted as the sixty-third episode of the radio anthology series X Minus One, first broadcast July 31, 1956.

SoRI-20041 is believed to be the first example of a drug that separately modulates uptake versus release in the dopamine transporter (possibly showing how inward and outward transport represent distinct operational modes of DAT); it produces the same effects as SoRI-20040 and SoRI-9804 in uptake assays and binding assays, inhibiting the re-uptake of dopamine, but does not modulate d-amphetamine-induced DA release by inhibiting that as well, like 'agonists' of the series do. This suggests the possibility of simultaneous action and increase of indirect-agonism through the dual action of DRA and DRI efficacy existing together. This increases the inhibition of re-uptake at synaptic dopamine concentrations without interfering in the flow of release of dopamine from amphetaminergic phosphorylation at the affected transporter. This overcomes the obstacle of a compromised binding site that would be rendered unusable through the action of amphetamine. Conventional dopamine re-uptake inhibitors (such as cocaine or methylphenidate) would otherwise ineffectively target such a site on each specific transporter so affected by amphetamine, making this an example of a DRI that does not have a mutually exclusive functionality against DRA action at individual instances of DAT.

Page from Ramanujan's notebook stating his Master theorem. The result is stated as follows: If a complex-valued function f(x) has an expansion of the form : f(x)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\,\\\\varphi(k)\\\\,}{k!}(-x)^k then the Mellin transform of f(x) is given by : \\\\int_0^\\\\infty x^{s-1}\\\\,f(x) \\\\, \\\\operatorname d x = \\\\Gamma(s)\\\\,\\\\varphi(-s) where \\\\Gamma(s) is the gamma function. It was widely used by Ramanujan to calculate definite integrals and infinite series. Higher- dimensional versions of this theorem also appear in quantum physics (through Feynman diagrams). A similar result was also obtained by Glaisher.  Alternative formalism  An alternative formulation of Ramanujan's master theorem is as follows: : \\\\int_0^\\\\infty x^{s-1}\\\\,\\\\left(\\\\,\\\\lambda(0) - x\\\\,\\\\lambda(1) + x^{2}\\\\,\\\\lambda(2) -\\\\,\\\\cdots\\\\,\\\\right) \\\\, \\\\operatorname d x = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\,\\\\sin(\\\\pi s)\\\\,}\\\\,\\\\lambda(-s) which gets converted to the above form after substituting \\\\lambda(n) \\\\equiv \\\\frac{\\\\varphi(n)}{\\\\,\\\\Gamma(1+n)\\\\,} and using the functional equation for the gamma function. The integral above is convergent for 0 < \\\\mathcal{Re}(s) < 1 subject to growth conditions on \\\\varphi .  Proof  A proof subject to \\"natural\\" assumptions (though not the weakest necessary conditions) to Ramanujan's Master theorem was provided by G. H. Hardy employing the residue theorem and the well-known Mellin inversion theorem.  Application to Bernoulli polynomials  The generating function of the Bernoulli polynomials B_k(x) is given by: : \\\\frac{z\\\\,e^{x\\\\,z}}{\\\\,e^z - 1\\\\,}=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty B_k(x)\\\\,\\\\frac{z^k}{k!} These polynomials are given in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function: : \\\\zeta(s,a) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{\\\\,(n+a)^s\\\\,} by ~\\\\zeta(1-n,a) = -\\\\frac{B_n(a)}{n} ~ for ~ n \\\\geq 1~ . Using the Ramanujan master theorem and the generating function of Bernoulli polynomials one has the following integral representation: : \\\\int_0^\\\\infty x^{s-1}\\\\,\\\\left(\\\\frac{e^{-ax}}{\\\\,1 - e^{-x}\\\\,}-\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\right) \\\\, \\\\operatorname d x = \\\\Gamma(s)\\\\,\\\\zeta(s,a) \\\\\\\\! which is valid for ~ 0 < \\\\mathcal{Re}(s) < 1 ~.  Application to the Gamma function  Weierstrass's definition of the Gamma function : \\\\Gamma(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\,e^{-\\\\gamma\\\\,x\\\\,}}{x}\\\\,\\\\prod_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left(\\\\,1 + \\\\frac{x}{n}\\\\,\\\\right)^{-1} e^{x/n} \\\\\\\\! is equivalent to expression : \\\\log\\\\Gamma(1+x) = -\\\\gamma\\\\,x + \\\\sum_{k=2}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\,\\\\zeta(k)\\\\,}{k}\\\\,(-x)^k where \\\\zeta(k) is the Riemann zeta function.

Early life and career Born in Colombo, Sri Lanka, 19 November 1955. Secondary education at St Thomas's College, Mount Lavinia. BSc (Eng.) Hons. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, King's College, University of London 1977; M.Phil. in Biomedical Engineering, University of Sussex 1980. Service From 1981-82 Pethiyagoda served as an engineer in the Division of Biomedical Engineering of the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka, and from 1982-87 as director of that institution. In 1984 he was concurrently appointed chairman of Sri Lanka's Water Resources Board. He served as Advisor on Environment and Natural resources to the Government of Sri Lanka from 2002–2004 and was in 2005 elected Deputy Chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission. In 2008 Pethiyagoda was elected to the board of trustees of the International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature, having previously served a four-year term as Deputy Chair of the Assurance Group of the British American Tobacco Biodiversity Partnership. In 2009 he was appointed a Research Associate of the Australian Museum, Sydney, and from 2015 to 2018 he served as Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board. Naturalist life He resigned from government office in 1987 to commence work on a project to explore the island's freshwater fishes, which led to his first book, Freshwater fishes of Sri Lanka (1990), a richly-illustrated account of the country's freshwater- fish fauna. Pethiyagoda diverted the profits from this book to an endowment for the Wildlife Heritage Trust (WHT), a foundation he established in 1990 to further biodiversity exploration in Sri Lanka, with the business-model of publishing natural-history books and channeling the proceeds into further exploration and research. Between 1991 and 2012 WHT published some 40 books in both English and Sinhala, including widely circulated titles such as A field guide to the birds of Sri Lanka, one of several titles translated into Sinhala and, aided by a grant from the Biodiversity Window of the World Bank / Netherlands Partnership Programme, provided free to 5,000 school libraries. This program served, for the first time in Sri Lanka, to put scientific local- language biodiversity texts in the hands of young people. Discoveries Together with colleagues at WHT Pethiyagoda has been responsible for the discovery and/or description of almost 100 new species of vertebrates from Sri Lanka, including fishes, amphibians and lizards, in addition to 43 species of freshwater crabs. This work also led to the finding that some 19 species of Sri Lankan amphibians have become extinct in the past 130 years, the highest national extinction record in the world. Recognition In 1998, concerned by the rapid loss of montane forest in Sri Lanka, Pethiyagoda began a (still on- going) project to convert abandoned tea plantations into natural forest, for which he was honoured by the Rolex Awards for Enterprise. In recognition of his contribution to biodiversity conservation Pethiyagoda, a Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences. In addition to some 60 papers in the scientific literature, his most recently published books are on the history of natural- history exploration in Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan primates and Horton Plains National Park. He is a Research Associate of the Australian Museum and serves as editor for Asian Freshwater Fishes of the journal Zootaxa. Legacy Several new species have been named in his honour, including the fishes Dawkinsia rohani and Rasboroides rohani; the microhylid frog Uperodon rohani; the dragon lizard Calotes pethiyagodai; the jumping spider Onomastus pethiyagodai and the dragonfly Macromidia donaldi pethiyagodai. In July 2012 Pethiyagoda and colleagues named a genus of South Asian freshwater fishes Dawkinsia in honour of the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, following which Pethiyagoda told AFP that \\"Richard Dawkins has through his writings helped us understand that the universe is far more beautiful and awe-inspiring than any religion has imagined\\". Pethiyagoda also named the freshwater cyprinid genus Haludaria after the Begali youth known only as Haludar, who illustrated the fishes depicted in Francis Hamilton's (1822) \\"Fishes of the Ganges\\", the founder work of Indian ichthyology.

The second letter is addressed to the Hyparch of the district from the Strategos of the Carian satrapy: : [Anaxim]brotos to Dionytas, greeting. Enclosed is the copy of the decree written by the king concerning the appointment of Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy son of Lysimachus, as chief priestess of the queen of the satrapy.

Background and recording All but four songs were written in 2011. Three of the exceptions were songs previously released in live version, the other released on Wrecking Ball: *\\"Jack of All Trades\\", which was written in 2009. During Springsteen's Wrecking Ball World Tour he addressed the crowd and talks about the current state of the economy, which inspired him to write this song three years previously. *\\"Wrecking Ball\\", which was written in 2009 prior to a series of E Street Band shows at Giants Stadium as a tribute to the venue, which was set to close and be demolished. Springsteen later dedicated a live version with revised lyrics to the closing of the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The song made other appearances throughout the final two months of the Working on a Dream Tour; *\\"American Land\\", which was written during the 2006 Seeger Sessions with a studio version being recorded though never released. The song was played throughout that tour and heavily on the subsequent two E Street Band tours; and *\\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\", which was written by Springsteen sometime in 1998 or early 1999 and first performed on the 1999 Reunion Tour with the E Street Band. A studio version was originally recorded in 2002 during the sessions for The Rising album although it was never released. The album includes tracks that feature Clarence Clemons, who died in June 2011. Clemons performs the saxophone solos on \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\", and backing saxophone rhythms on the title track. While the tour in support of the album featured the full current E Street Band lineup, the only E Street Band members to appear on the album are Clemons, Steven Van Zandt, Max Weinberg, and Patti Scialfa; adjunct members Charlie Giordano and Soozie Tyrell are also heavily featured. The album features members of the Sessions Band, including the horn section, and special guest appearances by Tom Morello and Matt Chamberlain.  Music and lyrics  The Hollywood Reporter called the album Springsteen at his \\"angriest yet\\", and some of the tracks address topics such as economic justice. Musically, the album was described the Hollywood Reporter as being \\"very rock 'n' roll ... with unexpected textures—loops, electronic percussion[, and] an amazing sweep of influences and rhythms, from hip-hop to Irish folk rhythms.\\" According to Consequence of Sound's Dan Caffrey, Wrecking Ball is a heartland rock album that sounds like a subtler version of We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, but also draws on sounds from Springsteen's Human Touch (1992). Andy Gill of The Independent wrote of the album's musical style, \\"[I]t's couched in a mix of the classic Boss rock bombast and the muscular hootenanny folk-rock of his Seeger Sessions album, with touches of noble gospel, poignant jazz trumpet and feisty Irish rebel music colouring the songs according to their mood.\\" The A.V. Clubs Steven Hyden called it \\"a mainstream rock record\\" and noted that, musically, the album features \\"booming drums, squealing guitar solos, violins, banjos, trumpets, pianos, pots, pans, and every available hard surface at Bruce's home studio.\\" Music writer Robert Christgau interpreted its first six tracks as \\"heavy irony shading over into murderous rage, with refurbished arena-rock to slam it home\\". He cited the opening track \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" as an example, writing that \\"it's perversely anti-political to lay any other interpretation on the opening [track], which cites places 'From the shotgun shack to the Superdome' where we—meaning the U.S.A. so many Americans weren't even born in—documentably haven't taken care of our own.\\" Steve Leftridge of PopMatters found the characters in the songs \\"less elusive about whom to blame for their troubles, cutting out the middle figures like foremen and hiring men and taking on the real culprits unambiguously.\\" He compared the album to Springsteen's The Rising (2002), writing that if that was his \\"9-11 album\\", Wrecking Ball is his \\"Occupy album\\".  Songs  The title track was originally written as a tribute to Giants Stadium (pictured in 2003), when Springsteen and the E Street Band played the venue's final concerts. According to Springsteen, in 2009 he wrote his first song about a \\"guy that wears a tie\\". Springsteen has \\"spent much of his career writing about characters struggling in tough economic times, but the financial crisis reportedly convinced him it was time to write about the people and forces that brought America to this 'ugly point.' [The album is an] indictment of Wall Street greed and corruption and a look into the devastation it has wrought.\\" The opening track, \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\", recalls \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" in terms of its themes that reflect Springsteen's frustration with the lack of accountability he sees in government. In the vein of \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", the seemingly unabashedly patriotic chorus \\"Wherever this flag is flown/we take care of our own\\" is contrasted in the verses with references to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina suggesting that perhaps we don't \\"take care of our own.\\" The song \\"Death to My Hometown\\" is an angry, thinly veiled protest song regarding the practices of Wall Street bankers and the economic crisis for which Springsteen considers them accountable. \\"They destroyed our families’ factories and they took our homes/They left our bodies on the planks, the vultures picked our bones,\\" he sings. The song features heavy Irish folk influences (including a prominent tin whistle riff), as well as samples of Sacred Harp singing. The title track was originally written in commemoration of the then-pending demolition of Giants Stadium in New Jersey and is written from the stadium's point of view (\\"I was raised out of steel here in the swamps of Jersey\\"). However, in the context of the album it becomes a defiant anthem in the face of economic adversity with the refrain \\"C'mon on and take your best shot/Let me see what you got/Bring on your wrecking ball!\\" The album version is only slightly differently arranged than the original live version and features no major lyrical changes. This is one of the two songs on the album to feature E Street Band legendary saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who died in 2011. The song \\"Rocky Ground\\" is perhaps the most experimental track on the album. While the song does recall Springsteen's previous work, such as the similarly gospel music–influenced \\"My City of Ruins\\" and the hip-hop tinged \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\", it features a brief rap by Michelle Moore, a first for a Springsteen song. The song features an atmospheric arrangement that includes a gospel choir and vocal looping (the words \\"I'm a soldier\\" from the Church of God in Christ Congregation's recording of \\"I'm a Soldier in the Army of the Lord\\" are looped throughout the song). The song's lyrics contain extensive religious imagery, including biblically-inspired lyrics such as \\"40 days and nights of rain washed this land/Jesus said the moneychangers in this temple will not stand,\\" which reflect the theme of economic equality covered earlier in the album. However, the tone of this song is much more optimistic than most of the previous songs on the album despite its somber arrangement, with Springsteen singing \\"there's a new day coming\\" in response to the Gospel Choir's refrain \\"we've been traveling over rocky ground.\\" The next and penultimate track, \\"Land of Hope and Dreams\\", continues the religious themes and more hopeful outlook with its uplifting lyrics and chorus that use an extensive train metaphor to express Springsteen's take on the American dream. \\"This train/dreams will not be thwarted/this train/faith will be rewarded,\\" he sings. The song ends with a gospel choir singing excerpts from The Impressions' \\"People Get Ready\\" and Springsteen repeating \\"you just get on board/you just thank the Lord.\\" Compared to its previous live version, which the E Street Band has been performing since 1999, it has been re-worked in a somewhat more compact version and now features electronic drums and the aforementioned use of a gospel choir. The album's closing track, \\"We Are Alive,\\" is a \\"campfire song\\" for ghosts of the oppressed, martyred strikers, protesters, and immigrant workers. \\"I was killed in Maryland in 1877/When the railroad workers made their stand/I was killed in 1963/One Sunday morning in Birmingham,\\" he sings during the verse. The chorus, however, has a much more celebratory tone with the refrain \\"We are alive/And though our bodies lie alone here in the dark/Our spirits rise/To carry the fire and light the spark/To stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart.\\" The song, which has an Irish-wake feel to it, is an acoustic number with Springsteen being backed by mariachi horns. The horn riff greatly resembles that from Johnny Cash's hit \\"Ring of Fire\\". According to producer, Ron Aniello, \\"American Man\\" and a re- recorded version of \\"American Skin (41 Shots)\\" were recorded for the album but not released. \\"American Skin (41 Shots)\\" would be released two years later on Springsteen's High Hopes album.  Critical reception  Wrecking Ball was released on March 5, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on March 6 in the United States. It received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from selected mainstream critics, the album received a metascore of 78, which is based on 41 reviews. David Fricke of Rolling Stone gave the album a rave review, dubbing it \\"the most despairing, confrontational and musically turbulent album Bruce Springsteen has ever made.\\" BBC Music's Ian Winwood dubbed the album \\"a work of commanding range and masterful execution\\", and complimented its music as \\"varied and surprising\\". Steve Leftridge of PopMatters called it \\"cohesively designed\\" and wrote that it \\"finds Springsteen still firing on all cylinders—writing with poetic urgency, drawing on traditions old and new, singing and playing with prime strength and energy, and delivering a new set of killer melodies with fresh sonic wallop.\\" The Guardians Alexis Petridis wrote that the album \\"paints almost entirely in broad brushstrokes, but its bombast rarely seems hollow: it exists [...] in service of an anger that feels righteous, affecting and genuine.\\" Andy Gill of The Independent found the album \\"much darker than any of Springsteen's earlier blue-collar tirades\\" and stated, \\"There's few, if any, moments of musical innovation, but in terms of political intent, there won't be a harder, more challenging album released all year.\\" However, Slant Magazines Jesse Cataldo accused Springsteen of being \\"borderline jingoistic\\" and called his perspective \\"rose-colored\\", writing that he \\"seems more concerned with overtures toward harmony than actual dissent, a newfound wishy-washiness that leaves him sounding entirely defanged.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found the album \\"cumbersome and top heavy\\" and stated, \\"Springsteen sacrific[es] impassioned rage in favor of explaining his intentions too clearly.\\" Although he commended the album's themes, Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot criticized its music as \\"sterile\\" and commented that Springsteen \\"lost his nerve as a coproducer, going for stadium bombast instead of the unadorned grit these stories of hard times demand.\\" Despite commending Springsteen's energy with the songs' \\"ambitious arrangements\\", Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found the \\"energy [to be] in service of deeply nebulous ideas\\" and stated, \\"the text is far more ambiguous, and in plenty of places on this album, just outright flat.\\" In the same review, Jon Pareles argued that the album is \\"sincere, ambitious and angry, which can lead to mixed outcomes. It also — which may be a surprise on an album billed as a broadside — holds some of Springsteen’s most elaborate studio concoctions since Born to Run.\\"  Commercial performance  The album debuted at No. 1 in 16 different countries including both the US and UK charts with approximately 196,000 and 74,000 records sold, respectively. \\"Wrecking Ball\\" became Springsteen's tenth No. 1 album in the United States, tying him with Elvis Presley for third-most No. 1 albums of all-time. Only the Beatles (19) and Jay-Z (12) have more No. 1 albums. By November 2013, Wrecking Ball had sold 506,000 in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. President Barack Obama used \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" as one of his top campaign songs and it was played during many of his re-election campaign stops including right after his victory speech on election night. Springsteen also appeared at quite a few of his late campaign stops where he performed a short acoustic set. Use of the song helped boost sales of the song by 409%.  Accolades  The album and its single, \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" was nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song for \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" and Best Rock Album. Springsteen along with the E Street Band performed at the event. Rolling Stone ranked Wrecking Ball the number-one album of the year on their Top 50 albums of 2012 list. In his list for The Barnes & Noble Review, Christgau named it the tenth best album of 2012 after calling it \\"his best since Tunnel of Love if not Born in the U.S.A.\\" Track listing Wrecking Ball was released as a two-LP set, a single CD, and a digital download. The CD and download versions were also available in a \\"Special Edition\\" format, which included two bonus tracks along with exclusive photos and artwork. The vinyl version included a copy of the standard CD (without the two additional tracks).

Königsberg, East Prussia - May 10, 1996 in Arlington, Virginia) was a German-American palaeontologist and geologist, noted for his contributions to geology, paleozoic stratigraphy and paleontology, Cephalopoda, ancient and modern reefs, and correlation, the matching of strata of the same age in different locations.Memorial to Curt Teicher 1905–1996 - John A. Reinemund He studied geology at universities in Munich, Freiburg and Königsberg, receiving his Ph.D. degree from Albertus University in Königsberg in 1928. The same year he married Gertrud Kaufmann, daughter of Walter Kaufmann, a physics professor in Königsberg, and sister to Rudolf Kaufmann, the tragically short-lived palaeontologist. He was appointed as assistant at Freiburg from where he went to Washington to study cephalopods on a one-year Rockefeller Foundation award in 1930. In 1931-32 he took part as geologist in a Danish expedition to Greenland. With the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany in the 1930s, he was advised by the University to divorce his wife as she had a Jewish ancestry. The couple hastily left for Copenhagen in 1933, and eked out a living there for the next four years.http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830906138.html A Carnegie Foundation grant in 1937 enabled the Teicherts to settle in Australia where Curt had been offered a position at the University of Western Australia in Perth. Here he was the only palaeontologist in a vast and unexplored fossil- rich area. With the outbreak of World War II the Teicherts were interned by the authorities, and were later offered a trip back to Germany in exchange for Australian prisoners of war, an offer which was politely declined. The position as research lecturer at Perth lasted from 1937 to 1945. During the war years he investigated reefs from a naval shipping point of view, and was a consultant to Caltex Oil in their search for oil in Western Australia. After the War he became assistant chief geologist in the Mines Department of Victoria until 1947, and lastly senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne until 1952. In 1949 Raymond C. Moore of the University of Kansas had asked Teichert to assist in compiling a volume on the Cephalopoda for the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology (1953–1981). A Fulbright Fellowship allowed Teichert to go on a fifty-university tour in 1951–52 to interview potential contributors to this volume. In 1952 Teichert started work at the New Mexico School of Mines in Socorro where he studied the local Devonian age rocks, his paper being published by the U.S. Geological Survey. In 1954 he joined the USGS, setting up a laboratory and the necessary infrastructure at the Denver Federal Center. He also found time to return to Germany as guest professor of the universities of Bonn, Freiberg, and Göttingen. The success of the Denver laboratory led to Teichert's transferring to Quetta in Pakistan in 1961, where an International Development-USGS project was improving the minerals and exploration mapping. Teichert's part in the program was a detailed study of the Permian-Triassic boundary in the Salt Range. He helped develop a National Stratigraphic Code for Pakistan, leading to stratigraphic correlations among Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey, all members of the Central Treaty Organization. When the Pakistan project was wrapped up in 1964, Teichert became Regents’ Professor at the University of Kansas. During this period he edited seven volumes of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. He left the University of Kansas in 1977 for the University of Rochester in New York where he stayed until 1993. He left Rochester in 1995, two years after his wife's death, and moved to Arlington in Virginia to close out his final years near many of his friends and former associates. During his career Teichert served on the faculties of seven universities on three continents. He was co-editor of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology from 1964 to 1979, president of the Paleontological Society in 1971–72, and president of the International Paleontological Association between 1976 and 1980. His major moves were from Europe to Australia in 1937, and Australia to the US in 1952. The Curt Teichert Festschrift (Ellis Yochelson, Wolfgang Struve, editor, Senckenbergiana Lethaea, v. 69, 628 p., 1988/1989) describes his many notable contributions to palaeontology. He authored or co-authored more than 325 papers during his lifetime.

He began his working life as an apprentice to a firm of architects and ended it as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, having had a keen interest in astronomy since childhood. Early life Thomas Thorp was born on 26 October 1850, the son of a farmer who worked land around Narrow Lane (now known as Victoria Avenue), Besses o' th' Barn, Whitefield, Lancashire. He was educated first at the local Park Lane School and subsequently at Manchester Grammar School, following which he was apprenticed to Maycock and Bell, a firm of architects and surveyors in Manchester. During his apprenticeship, he had a role in the town-planning of New Brighton, which was then rising as a Victorian resort town. He had an interest in the practical application of scientific knowledge, as did his inventive father, and a consequence of this trait was an inclination towards civil and mechanical engineering.Royal Astronomical Society (1915), pp. 250–251. Later in life Thorp was to be the appointed engineer for both the Local Board of Whitefield and also its District Council.Sanitary Record (1891), p. 102. Engineering As early as 1872, while still working for Maycock and Bell, he was sole patentee of a mechanism for tap valves.London Gazette (1872). In 1875, he was jointly named with A. P. Bell, architect, on a patent application regarding improvements to the automation of gas lighting,London Gazette (1875).Laxton (1877), p. 446. and continued to design items for the gas industry thereafter. In 1880 he established a business for the manufacture of his designs, originally known as Thomas Thorp & Co., with premises at Narrow Lane, Whitefield.Williams (1994), p. 26. One significant innovation was the design, patented in 1889,Nasmith (1895), p. 188. for the first practical mechanism that allowed gas to be dispensed by insertion of a penny into a meter, an early point-of-use prepayment system. Although frequently attributed as being his invention alone, the patent was jointly held with Thomas Gardiner Marsh. The device was a major advance and, for example, the Manchester Institution of the Association of Gas Engineers and Manufacturers reported in 1898 that Despite its practicality, the meter design of Thorp and Marsh was rapidly superseded and by 1894 J. Nasmith was reporting that it was \\"practically out of the running\\".Nasmith (1895), p. 198. The Edinburgh-based William Cowan and the Manchester business of Sawyer and Purves were among those who had been granted patents for improvements to the mechanism by that time.Nasmith (1895), pp. 190, 194. Around the same time, Thorp and Marsh were among the many people experimenting with the possibilities of using acetylene gas as an alternate to coal gas. Acetylene – produced by mixing calcium carbide and water – was thought to produce a better quality of light but there were practical difficulties to overcome. They discovered that adding the carbide to the water was less dangerous than adding the water to the carbide, and they surmounted problems related to gradual \\"choking\\" of the burners when in use by mixing air with the product. They also invented a safety valve that they claimed cut off the burner outlet in the not unusual event that the supply to it was interrupted, thus preventing unlit gas from being emitted when the supply was restored. This valve was capable of use in both acetylene and coal gas installations. Thorp also invented the rotary gas meter in 1902,Gerhard (1908), p. 152. and, what his obituary describes as \\"a tiny device ... for economical regulation of gas delivery [that] has been very widely employed by manufacturers and public authorities.\\" Other inventions included a push-tap for water and improvements to gas lamps and pneumatic tools. Thorp retired from business at the age of 50 to devote more time to his scientific studies. An advertisement of 1906 shows Marsh as chairman of the Manchester-based Rotary Meter Company Ltd and director of a similarly named business in New York. The latter had bought the sole US and Canadian manufacturing rights for all products regarding which Thorp held or might in future hold US patents.American Gas Light Journal (1906), p. 591. Scientific instruments Thorp was a \\"scientific and mechanical genius\\". In pursuit of his childhood interest in astronomy, he developed considerable skills in the manufacture of optical glass and both reflector and refractor telescopes. He also created celluloid diffraction grating replicas, polarising solar eyepieces and prominence spectroscopes that were widely used, as well as objective prisms. His high resolutionPowerhouse. diffracting grating replicas were significant advances of the ideas developed by Henry Rowland, whilst his multi-slit spectroscope was the first to enable the showing of both celestial and terrestrial objects and has formed the basis for the present day spectrohelioscope.Duckworth (1975). Father Aloysius Cortie, of Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, was one whom achieved good results from an example of the objective prisms. Eventually owning houses in Whitefield and also in Prestatyn, North Wales, he constructed observatories at each of these and favoured the Cooke equatorial telescope for his own observations. This device was fitted with a photo-visual objective, a spectroscope and other attachments that enabled it to be used for photography. Thorp's innovative design for celluloid diffraction grating replicas won him the Wilde Premium for Original Research in 1901, principally in recognition of his paper of 1899 entitled Grating Films and their application to Colour Photography.Manc. Lit. & Phil. (1902–1903), Awards of Medals & Premiums, p. lxxii. He was also recognised by awards from other bodies, including international exhibitions. His diffraction gratings were particularly noted in an obituary, which said that they made Prior to his developments, details of which he published but did not patent, interested people had to rely upon the photographic methods that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh and Izarn. Thorp's \\"brilliant idea\\", announced in 1898 and improved thereafter through experimentation and the development of new materials, was to take \\"a cast of the ruled surface in a transparent medium [comprising] a thin solution of celluloid in amyl acetate.\\" He described his method on numerous occasions, including in a letter published in the edition of 29 December 1905 of the British Journal of Photography (reproduced in Popular Astronomy, 1906), He emphasised the need for a dust- free environment and a uniform drying of the solution as well as asserting that his was the \\"first method of producing optically useful replicas of gratings and one which after all has not in my opinion been superseded.\\" By 1900 he was able to apply his developments to colour photographyThorp (1906), pp. 93–96. and he went on to demonstrate to the British Astronomical Association a method for projecting natural colours that used \\"three replicas adjusted to diffract the proper colour sensations to the eye\\". Flash spectrum of total solar eclipse, Burgos, August 1905 His work with celluloid was not limited to investigation of its uses in astronomy. He reported in 1902 that he had demonstrated the explosive nature of the substance by substituting it for the cordite in a bullet and then firing that bullet through a thick piece of wood.Manc. Lit. & Phil. (October 1902), p. ii. Similarly, although he used partial vacuums in his development of his diffraction gratings, he also investigated their use elsewhere as, for example, in his paper of 1903 entitled On the Production of Polished Metallic Surfaces having the Properties of Japanese \\"Magic\\" Mirrors.Manc. Lit. & Phil. (January 1902), Article 7 & pp. xix These and numerous other contributions – including experiments in soldering aluminiumManc. Lit. & Phil. (November 1902), p. vi. and the use of optics for gunsightsManc. Lit. & Phil. (February 1903), p. xxii. – were reported to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, of which he had been elected a member on 21 January 1896.Manc. Lit. & Phil. (1902), List of Ordinary Members, p. lxiv. He served as member of the Society's Council for all but one year between 1902 and 1912, was a vice-president for three years and was offered, but refused, a nomination to be president. Thorp was a member of expeditions to view the total solar eclipses of 1900 and 1905, which visited Algiers and Burgos, respectively. Examples of his inventions were used by various members of the parties.Maunder (1901), pp. 62, 156–158, 160–161, 221.Levander (1906), pp. 7, 13, 15, 40–41, 61. Proposed by David G. Simpson, Thorp was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society on 11 April 1902.The Observatory (1902), p. 114. He was also a vice-president of the Manchester Astronomical Society, of which he had been a member since 1892. Death Thorp died at Prestatyn on 13 June 1914, leaving a widow and three sons, one of whom – Franklin – also had involvements in the gas industry.Gas Age (1914), p. 59. He was buried at All Saints' Church, Stand, a few days later.Manchester Guardian (1914), p. 20. He also left a partially developed scheme for the manufacture of a ruling machine that obviated the need for a screw drive, being controlled instead by a mercury clepsydra and micrometre valve, and had been working on the design of a cinema screen. Thorp's Cooke telescope was given by the family to Stand Grammar School. One obituarist remarked on his \\"unassuming and genial manner to all with whom he came into contact, and his readiness to explain and to make suggestions on any subject in which his wide knowledge could be of any assistance.\\"WHT in Manc.

Ljubljana: Odbor 15. brigade, p. 432. After graduating from an upper secondary school she enrolled in the University of Ljubljana’s Faculty of Medicine. During her studies she was a member of the Slovene Club and the student revolutionary movement. She was accepted for membership in the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1940. Vrhovnik joined the underground movement immediately after the occupation of Yugoslavia. She became a courier for the organizational secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Slovenia, Tone Tomšič (1910–1942). When the occupying forces became aware of her activity they sentenced her to life in prison in absentia, holding her parents as hostages for several months. Vrhovnik nonetheless remained in Ljubljana. She participated in organizing an underground printshop for the resistance in Ljubljana. As a courier, she carried manuscripts for the underground printshops in Ljubljana codenamed Podmornica 'submarine' at Brdo Street () no. 95 and Tunel 'tunnel' at Emona Street () no. 2. With the assistance of her brother, she managed to set up a bunker where, starting on 4 May 1943, she reproduced copies of Ljudska pravica (The People’s Justice), Slovenski poročevalec (Slovenian Reporter), Radio vestnik (Messenger Radio), and various other brochures for nine months. At her own choosing, on 22 January 1944 she was sent to the Slovenian Littoral. There she served as an instructor for the Young Communist League of Yugoslavia (SKOJ) for Idrija and an instructor for SKOJ training courses for the SKOJ Regional Committee for the Littoral. However, she did not remain there long, but volunteered to work in Carinthia.

To date, the only other regular member of the band was Joanne Schornikow, who played keyboards and sang in the band at most performances between 2009 and 2012. History The Shivers’ first record, The Shakes, was recorded at Context Studios in Brooklyn. It was released independently and sold at shows and is now out of print. Shortly thereafter, Erdos left the band and Zarriello was left to continue on alone playing New York City clubs for the next few years both solo and with a revolving cast of musicians. In 2004, Zarriello was spotted by touring musician Red Hunter who offered to take him on the road and release an album on his label/collective, Whiskey and Apples. The album, CHARADES, released in October 2004, received little critical attention but began to develop The Shivers a following. The track \\"Beauty\\" has gone on, in subsequent years, to receive good reviews on sites such as Pitchfork, who said Zarriello's voice carried a \\"mesmerizing eroticism\\", and was a subject of a column in The Guardian and Spin.Barton, Laura \\"Hail, Hail, Rock'n'Roll\\", The Guardian (15 July 2010) While Zarriello was living in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, he was contacted by a former high school classmate, Sheldon Roberts, who had discovered The Shivers' music through a friend and proposed releasing their next album on a label he and friends were forming, Outerborough Records. Zarriello agreed and took measures to return to the United States. Five- piece band: 2004-2008 Back in New York City, Zarriello started performing again and sending CHARADES to college radio stations around the country. At one station Fordham University's WFUV, the album was discovered in the garbage can by young intern/DJ, Benham Jones, who reached out to Zarriello at a Tuesday night show at Arlene's Grocery. He offered Zarriello a gig at Fordham and the two became friends. Zarriello, now having his deal with Outerborough, gathered musicians and reached out to Jones to play bass. Jones agreed and helped the band record the album secretly overnight in the studios of WFUV. The album featured William Martina on cello, Matthew Jahn on guitar, Benham Jones on bass, and Alex Saltz and Danny Fischer on drums. Also featured on one track was visiting Australian pianist, Joanne Schornikow. The album, Phone Calls, released in early 2006. The Shivers continued as a five-piece, including Schornikow on piano and new drummer, Evan Pazner on drums. Schornikow having an expiring visa was forced to return to Australia. She was however, sold on The Shivers and begun plans to return to the US on an artist's visa with the primary goal of joining The Shivers. Zarriello and Schornikow kept in touch via the mail sending each other packages and tapes. The five-piece band played the SXSW music festival in 2007. In 2008, Zarriello decided to fund the production of the next Shivers album himself. Using money he had earned as a real estate agent, Zarriello hooked up with engineer Dan Hewitt and the band recorded the album Beaks To The Moon in four days at the now defunct LoHo Studios on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The album was released by the band via their own label in April 2008. Once again, the critics largely ignored the release with the growing independent critics/blogs, like Quiet Color championing it. As a duo: 2008-2012 Frustrated by a lack of commercial success and what he felt was an unacceptable level of commitment to the band, Zarriello dismissed all the band members except Schornikow, and the two continued as a duo. The Shivers had been in talks with Hewitt about releasing a DIY record on his micro-indie, State Capital Records. The label and the band would split all costs and profits. The album, In The Morning, was recorded on a 4-track tape recorder. It was the rawest, most analog/DIY album The Shivers had made since CHARADES and featured a more experimental duo sound. Again it did very little commercially and was primarily used as something to sell while on tour. The Shivers bought out Hewitt and now solely own the record. The Shivers continued on as a duo doing national tours and short stints overseas, and decided to independently record an album. The band used their own funds from day jobs and donations from their following decided to record their next album at all analog studio, Analogue Catalogue outside of Manchester, England. The album, More, was recorded by Producer Julie McLarnon and assisted by Rob Ferrier in five days to 2\\" inch tape. No computers were used. Tom Raysmith played drums. Semay Wu played cello and Jon Thorne played bass. Andrew Southern (bass) and Ryan Thornton (drums) were the rhythm section on the track \\"Love Is In The Air\\". The album was released in May 2011 on Silence Breaks Records (US). It was the most regularly released album The Shivers had to that time, and the first that included a proper public relations campaign. The album gained them some further recognition and a wider audience. Musician and label owner Johnny Lynch The Pictish Trail from Scotland had discovered In The Morning and decided to release More on his Fence Records in the UK in September 2011. The Shivers subsequently toured the UK in late fall of 2011 including performing a sold-out show in London and recording a session for the BBC Radio 1's Rob Da Bank show at Maida Vale Studios.\\"The Shivers Maida Vale Session\\" on the BBC Radio 1 website Schornikow has also continued her own career alongside her work with the band, and undertook a small club tour of the U.K with New Yorker Scott Rudd in the summer of 2012.  Forever Is A Word: 2015-present  The Shivers latest album Forever Is A Word was self-released on February 14, 2015. The band is currently working on a new full-length album and playing shows around New York City. In popular culture In May 2013, the song \\"Beauty\\" was sung by wedding guests at actor Aaron Paul's wedding. The band is featured in Matthew Bonifacio's film The Quitter. The Shivers music appears in other films such as Short Term 12, The Benefactor and Horns.

When logging into a site supporting Authenticator (including Google services) or using Authenticator-supporting third-party applications such as password managers or file hosting services, Authenticator generates a six- to eight-digit one-time password which users must enter in addition to their usual login details. Previous versions of the software were open-source but since 2013 releases are proprietary.Willis, Nathan (22 January 2014).\\"FreeOTP multi-factor authentication\\". LWN.net. Retrieved 10 August 2015. Typical use case To use Authenticator, the app is first installed on a smartphone. It must be set up for each site with which it is to be used: the site provides a shared secret key to the user over a secure channel, to be stored in the Authenticator app. This secret key will be used for all future logins to the site. To log into a site or service that uses two-factor authentication and supports Authenticator, the user provides username and password to the site, which computes (but does not display) the required six- digit one-time password and asks the user to enter it. The user runs the Authenticator app, which independently computes and displays the same password, which the user types in, authenticating their identity. With this kind of two-factor authentication, mere knowledge of username and password is not sufficient to break into a user's account; the attacker also needs knowledge of the shared secret key, or physical access to the device running the Authenticator app. An alternative route of attack is a man-in-the-middle attack: if the computer used for the login process is compromised by a trojan, then username, password and one-time password can be captured by the trojan, which can then initiate its own login session to the site or monitor and modify the communication between user and site. Technical description During setup, the service provider generates an 80-bit secret key for each user (whereas RFC 4226 §4 requires 128 bits and recommends 160 bits). This is transferred to the Authenticator app as a 16, 26 or 32 character base32 string or as a QR code. Subsequently, when the user opens the Authenticator app, it calculates an HMAC-SHA1 hash value using this secret key. The message that is HMAC-ed can be: * the number of 30-second periods since the Unix epoch (TOTP); or * a counter that is incremented with each new code (HOTP). A portion of the HMAC is extracted and displayed to the user as a six-digit code. Pitfalls Google Authenticator uses default parameters which are weaker than the suggestions in RFC 6238. Such defaults can be reasonably exploited, as demonstrated in Hashcat's TOTP cracking engine. For this reason, operators using Google Authenticator should take care with the secrets being used. Other authentication software The Google Authenticator app for Android was originally open source, but later became proprietary. Google made earlier source for their Authenticator app available on its GitHub repository; the associated development page states: > \\"This open source project allows you to download the code that powered > version 2.21 of the application. Subsequent versions contain Google-specific > workflows that are not part of the project.\\" Following Google Authenticator ceasing to be open source, a free-software clone named FreeOTP was created, predominantly a fresh rewrite but including some code from the original. Google provides Android,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2 A BlackBerry, and iOS versions of Authenticator. Several other versions of authentication software are available.

A component layer of act 2 of the opera , it may also be performed as an independent composition. It has a duration of 69 minutes. Function in Dienstag Oktophonie forms a layer of the music in act 2, (Invasion—Explosion with Farewell). The very forceful nature of the electronic music required a technical solution in order that the instrumentalists, who perform at the same time, can always be heard. Stockhausen solved this problem by providing each player with a microphone and a transmitter for amplification, which allows them to move freely throughout the auditiorium. This became a central part of Stockhausen’s performance practice in subsequent parts of the Licht cycle. Materials and technique Yamaha DX7-II synthesizer, similar to one of the synthesizers used in producing Oktophonie Oberheim Matrix 1000 synthesizer module, of the type used in producing Oktophonie Casio FZ-1 sampler, of the type used in producing Oktophonie Oktophonie was realised in the Studio for Electronic Music of the Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Cologne, in two phases of work: from 23 August to 30 November 1990, and from 5 to 30 August 1991. Studio collaborators were recording engineers Volker Müller and Daniel Velasco-Schwarzenberger, and recording technician Gertrud Melcher. Production was made using a single 24-track tape recorder. A 64-track recorder would have been preferable, or alternatively three synchronisable 24-track recorders, but the WDR studio had only the one machine. Spatialisation was facilitated by the use of a QUEG (Quadrophonic Effect Generator), a device manufactured by EMS in the early 1970s. It was developed by Stockhausen in collaboration with Peter Zinovieff, owner of the firm at that time. Despite having only four outputs, the QUEG could still be used to produce an octophonic output, by manually switching to four outputs, not only between the square on the floor and the one on the ceiling, but between all six squares forming the sides of the cube. A number of synthesizers and modules were used in the production of the sound layers: *two Yamaha DX7II-FD synthesizers *two Casio FZ-1 samplers *a Roland D-50 synthesizer *an Oberheim Matrix-1000 synthesizer module (without keyboard) *an Art Proverb effects unit *a Roland SDE 2000 reverberation unit *an SVC 350 vocoder *an Atari 1040 St computer *C-Lab Unitor Hardware and Notator Software *a Yamaha MR 12/4/2 mixing console In addition, an EMS Synthi 100 was used for control of the spatialization in some layers during the concluding portion. Analysis The music of Oktophonie is developed, like everything in , from the basic superformula, and consists of eight musical layers, each provided with different spatial distributions and sound movement patterns. For technical reasons of playback the music had to be produced in two segments, with the second tape beginning at 36'23\\" and a \\"bridge\\" tape used only for performances of the second act of Dienstag.)

Bathurst Resources Limited (through its subsidiary company Buller Coal Limited) intends to extract and export between one and four million tonnes of coal a year from open cast mining in an area of 200 hectares of conservation land on the southern Denniston Plateau. The proposed mine would be the second largest opencast coal mine in New Zealand after Solid Energy's Stockton Mine on the Stockton Plateau. Environmental groups such as Forest and Bird and the West Coast Environment Network oppose the project. History In March 2010, the Perth-based coal company Bathurst Resources announced it was buying L&M; Coal Holdings' hard-coking coal exploration assets and mining permit areas in the Buller District of the West Coast. In June 2010, Bathurst Resources announced plans to develop an opencast coking and thermal coal mine for exporting in 2011 in a joint venture with Christchurch-based company L&M.; The proposal had an exploration target of between 17 and 23 million tonnes of coal in the Denniston area. In early September 2010, Bathurst Resources confirmed plans for a US$57 million hard coking coal opencast mine on the Denniston plateau above Westport. The plan included a slurry pipeline to carry coal down the steep plateau slope from a processing plant to a rail load-out 10 km from Westport. Managing Director Hamish Bohannan said a recent feasibility study had been definitive and had confirmed the technical and economic feasibility of the project. Site biodiversity In March 2012, Forest and Bird organised a bioblitz as part of their campaign against the mining project. In November 2012, Massey University scientist Steve Trewick said that a new species of cave weta had been identified in the March 2012 field-trip to the Denniston Plateau. Consenting In September 2010, L&M; Coal Limited applied for 24 resource consents for the Escarpment Mine Project from both the Buller District Council and West Coast Regional Council. Bathurst Resources Limited later purchased L&M; Coal Limited and renamed it Buller Coal Limited. Bathurst also has to apply for and be granted an access agreement and a concession from the Department of Conservation to excavate the coal and to have a coal processing plant within a conservation area. Environmentalists have questioned the lack of ability to make public consultation on the application for an access agreement. In August 2011, after a public submission and hearing process, the West Coast Regional Council and Buller District Council granted Buller Coal Limited the resource consents required under the Resource Management Act. In September 2011, the West Coast Environment Network and Forest and Bird appealed the granting of the consents to the Environment Court because of the likely impacts on rare landscapes and habitats for threatened species in the conservation estate and because of the climate change impacts from the carbon dioxide released from the coal. The Environment Court hearing of the appeals of the resource consents began on 29 October 2012 and ended on 18 December 2012. Climate change In March 2012, Buller Coal and Solid Energy initiated a hearing in the Environment Court to get a declaration that for the appeal of the Bathurst consents, the Environment Court has no jurisdiction to consider the global warming effects of the greenhouse gas discharges from the downstream combustion of the coal. In May 2012, the Environment Court made a declaration that the climate change effects from the combustion of coal from the mine could not be considered as part of the effects of the land use consents for the mine. The West Coast Environment Network and Forest and Bird appealed the Environment Court's decision to the High Court. In August 2012, the High Court upheld the decision. In September 2012, the West Coast Environment Network appealed the High Court decision to the Court of Appeal. On 29 November 2012, the Supreme Court gave leave to hear the appeal in place of the Court of Appeal. Views The project has both supporters and critics within New Zealand. The resource sector lobby group Straterra describes the project as a \\"green mining case study\\" that \\"seeks to achieve a net positive benefit for the environment\\". In March 2012, a crowd of environmental activists and Green Party MPs rallying against coal mining greeted Prime Minister John Key Energy and Resources Minister Phil Heatley with boos and jeers as they attended the opening of Bathurst Resources’ new Wellington offices. On 25 September 2012, Minister of Economic Development Steven Joyce called on Forest and Bird and West Coast Environment Network to withdraw their appeals.

Stiller, The Silent Cry, Kathmandu: Sahayogi Prakashan, 1976, p 23 One source however states that the Chinese Amban had also suggested King Rajendra not to send wicked Rana Jang Pande, but to nominate another good, virtuous person to lead the quinquennial mission to the Ching Emperor's Court.Chinese Amban to King Rajendra, Tao Kwang 16th Year (1839 B.S., Magha 21, MFA, Pako No Pa. 64 Despite this, Jagat Bam Pande was originally supposed to lead the 1837 mission.Bhim Bahadur Pande Chhetri, Rastra Bhakti Ko Jhalak:Pande Bamsa Ko Bhumika, 1596-1904 B.S., kathmandu: Ratna Pustak Bhandar, 2034 B.S, P. 156 After Chautariya Pushkar Shah left for Peking there was a big political upheaval in Nepal with the dismissal and imprisonment of the Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa. Bhimsen Thapa held the post of Prime Minister continuously for thirty one years. The Nepalese court informed the Chautariya about the political developments in Nepal and dispatched him a letter to hand over to the Ching Emperor. Due to the political turmoil in Nepal, the Chautariya tried to complete his mission and return to Nepal as early as possible. He completed the round-trip journey to Peking in less than fourteen months. The mission of 1837 recorded a detailed and systematic summary of the routes from Kathmandu to Peking as traveled by the Nepalese envoy to Peking.B.H.

However, the Nepalese Delegation was met with a stern refusal of its petition for monetary aid, and were also requested not to go to war with the British.Hodgson to Gov of India, 26 May 1838, Foreign Dept Sec, 13 June 1838, No 10, NAI The Quing court did not support Nepal's call for help. Importance of this mission The 1837 mission was the first Nepalese quinquennial mission ever led by a prominent political personality like Chautariya Pushkar Shah. This mission was different from other Nepalese quinquennial missions in several ways. Firstly, the deputy leader of the 1837 mission was Captain Kirti Dhoj Pande, being the first time that the highest Nepalese military official was assigned the post of deputy leader of the mission. Secondly, the mission carried many expensive presents to the Ching Emperor. The Nepalese presents were so far the most expensive thus far. Thirdly, soon after his return from Peking as the leader of the Nepalese quinquennial mission to China, Chautariya Pushkar Shah was appointed to the post of Prime Minister in 1838.H. Ambrose Oldfield, Sketches from Nepal, Volume I, Delhi: Cosmo publications, Reptrint, 1981, p. 313 Thus Chautariya Pushkar Shah established his important role in the history of Sino-Nepalese relations. Prime Minister of Nepal/Commander in Chief - Nepali Army Puskar Shah was the prime minister of Nepal for a brief time from August 1838 to early 1839. He was made the Prime Minister and the Chief of the Nepalese Army of Nepal by King Rajendra against the will of his Queen Rajya Laxmi. At the time when he was made the prime minister, the court of Nepal had been divided into two factions: one faction opposed the British and wanted to declare war, whereas the other faction wanted to maintain peace. Puskar Shah was a supported war. He believed that only by maintaining peace with the British, Nepal could maintain its independence. He was forced to resign from the post of the Prime Minister in early 1839 mainly because the British persistently requested King Rajendra Bikram Shah to remove Shah from the post and install Rana Jang Pande, a minister supporting the British. Children Chatariya Puskar Shah had four sons: Sri Chautaria Bhim Bikram Shah, Rana Bikram Shah, Colonel Sri Chautaria Bir Bikram Shah, and Colonel Ambar Bikram Shah. Colonel Ambar Bikram Shah was killed by the Ranas for his part in the attempted coup d'état, at Teku, January 1882. Fearing wrath from the Ranas, his son Jabber Jung Shah was taken to a village in Dhading by a Jogi and settled there.

Belarusian courts have found him guilty of tax evasion and terrorism, but international human rights organization Amnesty International has stated that he is a prisoner of conscience imprisoned solely for peaceful protest. Prior to his arrest, Autukhovich worked at the Vaukavysk-based taxi company Nika-taxi 22222. He also ran as an opposition candidate in the 2004 Belarusian parliamentary elections. On 7 July 2006, he was arrested and charged with \\"large scale tax evasion and running business without a registration and a license\\". He was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to three-and-a-half years' home arrest. He was released in early 2009 following \\"pressure from the European Union and the United States\\". Shortly after his release, he was charged with involvement in a 2005 arson case, along with two other activists. Authorities later added additional charges of illegal weapons possession and \\"preparing a terrorist act\\". Autukhovich responded to the charges with a three-month hunger strike that lasted from February to April of that year, demanding that he be allowed to face to trial. In May, Autukhovich was tried, and while the terrorism charge against him was dropped, he was convicted of illegal possession of weapons and ammunition and given a five-year, two-month prison sentence. Autukhovich is currently serving his sentence in a labor camp in Ivatsevichy. He reportedly lacks legal representation after his lawyer, Paval Sapelka, was disbarred for representing opposition presidential candidate Andrei Sannikov in court. In December 2011, prison officials reported that Autukhovich had attempted suicide by slashing his wrists, but had survived and was in stable condition. According to the Viasna Human Rights Centre, following the incident, he was moved into a \\"closed regime\\", largely isolating him from contact with other prisoners.

His involvement in the lawsuit led to the publication of an autobiographical op-ed piece in The New York Times in October, 1993. Lyon was born and raised in Southern California and was a founding member of the Hagfish punk Rock band. Music Banning Lyon co- founded the punk rock band Hagfish with Doni and Zach Blair in 1991. Lyon drummed for the band for approximately two years, opening for bands such as ALL, Swervedriver, and Poster Children. He finally left the band after several break ups when tensions between members and line up changes left his relationship with the Blair brothers difficult. Lyon went on to reunite with Jarrod King (guitar) and Jef King (vocals), with Damon Earnheart on bass, to form the skate punk band Cleaners, based in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metroplex. They recorded and released Walking on Eggshells before ultimately splitting up in 1999. Class action lawsuit Shortly after his finally leaving Hagfish in 1993 Mr. Lyon became involved in a class action suit against National Medical Enterprises (NME). NME is now known as Tenet Healthcare. The suit was led by Robert Andrews of the law firm Andrews and Clark located in Ft. Worth, Texas. Mr. Lyon authored an autobiographical op-ed piece for The New York Times that was published on October 13, 1993. The article details his experience with having been hospitalized in Brookhaven Psychiatric Pavilion, a hospital owned by NME. Less than a week later, on October 18, Business Week published an article detailing Lyon’s story, going on to reveal further details regarding the Federal government’s involvement in an ongoing investigation of NME. That investigation led to what would become one of the largest health-care-fraud cases in American medical history. Shortly after the publishing of the articles National Medical Enterprises agreed to settle out of court. In June 1994, Peter Alexis and NME plead guilty to federal criminal and civil charges that included paying kickbacks to doctors in return for patient referrals. The chain paid a $379 million fine. At the time it was the largest fine levied for health care fraud. In February 1995 the doctors that had been defendants in the class action suit in which My. Lyon had been involved sued Lyon, his attorney Robert Andrews, and others. The doctors claimed that Lyon and the others had defamed them, citing Lyon’s statements made in the Dallas Morning News and Business Week. The case was ultimately dropped by the doctors. Outdoors In the summer of 2010 Mr. Lyon lived and worked as first mate aboard the SV Valora based out of Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts. He was briefly featured in an article in the Martha's Vineyard Times. Mr. Lyon now lives in northern California and works as an outdoor educator.

He was world professional track sprint champion in 1946 and 1957. He was the only rider to win a gold medal at Milan, Italy, in 1939 – in the world amateur sprint – before the championship was abandoned at the outbreak of the Second World War.The Bicycle, UK, 22 July 1942, p. 6 Derksen became a riders' agent and race promoter after retiring from racing and lived in a house on the outskirts of Amsterdam, named after the Ordrup track in Denmark where he won the professional omnium – akin to a pentathlon in athletics – 10 times.Cycling, UK, 2 February 1991 Biography Jan Derksen was born at Geertruidenberg in central western Holland on 23 January 1919. He became interested in cycling after listening to radio reports of six-day races on the track. His father gave Derksen his first racing bike after he passed his last school exams at 15. He took out a racing licence with the Dutch cycling federation, the KNWU, and raced on the track at Alkmaar. A coach saw him when he was 18 and he joined the national team. He had worked until then in a cycle business. At 19 he was third in the world amateur sprint championship, held in Amsterdam, and he became the only world champion in 1939 when the championship in Milan was abandoned because of the outbreak of the Second World War. His ride against the Italian, Astolfi, whom he beat in two rides, was the only event completed. He had been selected for the Dutch team for Olympic Games in Helsinki. “It was as good as certain that I would win two gold medals, because I was already world champion, but then the war broke out. There were no Olympics and that really upset me.” He continued racing during the German occupation of the Netherlands, travelling until 1942 to other occupied countries. He was Dutch sprint champion in 1943. Derksen’s professional career after the war was marked by his competition with another Dutch sprinter, Arie van Vliet. Derksen won 13 Dutch championships, seven of them by beating van Vliet, but he also came second to van Vliet ten times. He became world champion in 1946 by beating the Frenchman, Georges Senfftleben. He won the title again in 1957, beating van Vliet in the final. His championship ride in the quarter-final in 1955 was abandoned after he and the Italian, Antonio Maspes came to a balancing standstill for 32 minutes. The judges stopped the race.

Bella Fromm (20 December 1890 – 9 February 1972) was a German journalist and author of Jewish origin, who lived in exile in the United States from 1938. She is best known as the author of Blood and Banquets (1943), an account of her time as diplomatic correspondent for Berlin newspapers during the Weimar Republic, and of her experiences during the first five years of the Third Reich. Although this book was published as an authentic contemporary diary, and is frequently cited as such, recent research suggests that Fromm wrote it in the U.S. after leaving Germany. Fromm was born to Her father Siegfried Fromm and her mother Greta Fromm is a sister of Max Fromm the sons of Nathan and Marie Fromm in Nuremberg and grew up in Kitzingen in Lower Franconia, part of a family of prosperous assimilated Jewish wine merchants. The Fromm family came from Spain and lived for 500 years until the Holocaust in Germany. By her own account, her family was on friendly terms with the Bavarian royal family and other leaders of Bavarian high society.Blood and Banquets: a Berlin Social Diary, Garden City Publishing Company, New York, 1943, 4 Her father died when she was a child, and her mother, to whom she was devoted, died in 1918. In 1911 she married a Jewish businessman, Max Israel, with whom she had a daughter, Grete-Ellen (known as “Gonny” in Fromm’s writing). After her divorce from Israel she married Karl Julius Steuermann, from whom she was also later divorced. During World War I Fromm worked for the German Red Cross and was decorated by the King of Bavaria. After her mother’s death she inherited the family fortune and was able to devote her time to social work. The inflation of 1923, however, destroyed her wealth and she was forced to look for work. Using family contacts, she was employed by the Ullstein press, a major Jewish-owned publishing house, and worked for the Ullstein newspapers, notably the Berliner Zeitung (“BZ”) and the Vossische Zeitung, a leading Berlin liberal newspaper. Initially confined to traditional roles for female journalists such as fashion and social gossip, Fromm proved talented and ambitious and soon graduated to writing about politics and diplomacy. Journalist As diplomatic correspondent for the Ullstein papers, Fromm became a well-known figure in Berlin high society. Among those with whom she claimed acquaintance were Frederick Birchall (The New York Times correspondent and editor), Aristide Briand (French Prime Minister), Vittorio Cerruti (Italian Ambassador), William E. Dodd (U.S. Ambassador), Andre Francois-Poncet (French Ambassador), Ernst Hanfstaengl (friend of Adolf Hitler and his first foreign press chief), Louis P. Lochner (veteran American correspondent), Otto Meissner (head of the Presidential Chancellery, and later of Hitler’s Chancellery), Konstantin von Neurath (German Foreign Minister), Sir Eric Phipps (British Ambassador), Leni Riefenstahl (filmmaker), Hjalmar Schacht (Economics Minister) and Kurt von Schleicher (Chancellor before Hitler). By her own account Fromm met Hitler, Hermann Göring, Rudolf Hess and Joseph Goebbels several times at diplomatic events, but was not friendly with any of them. Fromm portrays herself as a leading figure in Berlin political society, on intimate terms with ministers, editors and diplomats, and the recipient of confidential information from many of them. She makes much of her close friendship with Schleicher and his wife, and writes of her attempts to warn Schleicher that President Paul von Hindenburg was about to remove him as Chancellor in favour of Hitler. It is notable, however, that two of the best-known contemporary accounts of politics and the press in Berlin at this time do not mention Fromm: William Shirer’s Berlin Diary,Johns Hopkins University Press, 1941 and the memoirs of Hitler’s press chief Otto Dietrich, Zwolfe Jahre mit Hitler Otto Dietrich Zwolfe Jahre mit Hitler, 1955; published in English as The Hitler I Knew, Skyhorse Publishing 2010 As a Jew and an outspoken liberal, Fromm found her position increasingly precarious after the Nazis came to power in 1933. She was protected to some extent by her friendship with leading foreign diplomats and also with conservative members of Hitler’s government such as Schacht and von Neurath. In 1934 she sent her daughter to the United States. After 1934 she was no longer able to write under her own name, but her journalism continued to appear anonymously. She continued to be invited to diplomatic and social events. Deprived of most of her income from journalism, Fromm returned to her family’s trade as a wine merchant, exploiting her contacts with foreign embassies and wealthy Berliners. According to her account, she also used her contacts to secure visas for many German Jews desperate to emigrate. For this reason, she wrote, she refused to heed the advice of her friends that she should leave Germany before it was too late. In 1938, however, Jews were excluded from the wine trade. Left with no income, and in the face of increasing anti-Semitic persecution, Fromm emigrated to the U.S. in September 1938. In New York, Fromm worked as a typist and secretary, and met her third husband, Peter Wolff. With the entry of the U.S. into World War II in December 1941, Fromm decided to write a book about her experiences in Weimar and Nazi Germany. The book was aimed at a war-time American readership and is stridently anti-Nazi and pro-American in tone. A fabricated diary? In Blood and Banquets Fromm asserted: \\"In preparing this book, I made excerpts from the original entries in my diary… The parts of my diary which are contained in this book stand just as they were originally written…\\" Fromm, Blood and Banquets, x This assertion, however, has been challenged by the American historian Henry Ashby Turner, who examined Fromm’s private papers in the Boston University library. In a 2000 journal article Turner maintained that Fromm wrote the book in New York, basing it on her extensive collection of newspaper cuttings, on secondary sources and on her own memory.Henry Ashby Turner, \\"Two dubious Third Reich diaries\\", Central European History 33 (2000), no. 3, 415-422. In this article Turner also casts doubt on the authenticity of another well-known work, the Berlin Diaries of Marie Vassiltchikov. Turner noted that Fromm’s papers contain no original manuscript of a diary, only a series of typescripts produced on an American typewriter and on American writing paper. Turner also noted significant changes between successive drafts, contradicting Fromm’s assertion that the entries in the published book “stand just as they were originally written.” Turner also pointed out factual errors in Blood and Banquets, which, he said, arose from Fromm’s use of secondary sources, and which would not have occurred if the book had been an authentic contemporary diary. He cites as an example an entry for 29 January 1932, in which Fromm refers to a speech given by Hitler on 27 January. In fact, Turner says, Hitler gave his speech on 26 January, which Fromm would have known had she been basing her book on an actual contemporary diary. The error, Turner says, is also to be found in Fritz Thyssen’s book I Paid Hitler, published in the U.S. in 1941. He concludes that Fromm wrote her “diary” entry based on Thyssen’s book rather than on an actual diary. In other entries, he says, Fromm gives erroneous dates for speeches by Goebbels (including one she claimed to have witnessed) as a result of relying on newspaper cuttings rather than her own knowledge. Turner is also sceptical about Fromm’s claims to have been a close friend of Kurt von Schleicher and the recipient of his confidences. He writes: “A first-name relationship – for upper-class Germans of that time a near-ceremonial matter – between Kurt von Schleicher and a society columnist he had met at a diplomatic reception is, to say the least, lacking in plausibility.” He concludes: “To sum up, Blood and Banquets, a memoir about events in Germany that was composed years later in America in demonstrably inventive fashion… should be regarded by historians with skepticism.”Turner, \\"Two dubious Third Reich diaries,\\" 419 Despite these doubts about its authenticity, Fromm’s book, with its many colourful descriptions of social life in Berlin in the 1920s and '30s and its robustly anti-Nazi views, continues to be widely quoted by postwar historians of the Weimar and Third Reich periods. Among recent works to cite Blood and Banquets are biographies of Goebbels (by Toby Thacker), Hess (by Peter Padfield), Riefenstahl (by Steven Bach), Magda Goebbels (by Anja Klabunde), Eva Braun (by Angela Lambert), William E. Dodd (by Erik Larson) and Stephanie von Hohenlohe (by Martha Schad). Other works to use Fromm as a source include Royals and the Reich by Jonathan Petropoulos, High Society in the Third Reich by Fabrice d'Almeida and Hitler’s Women by Guido Knopp. In 1946 Fromm returned to Germany for several research trips, not permanently. In 1961 she published a novel based on her experiences in exile, Die Engel weinen (The Angels Cry), which was poorly received. In 1958 she was awarded the Cross of Merit First Class (Verdienstkreuz Erster Klasse) by the Federal Republic of Germany. She died in New York in 1972. In 1993 Blood and Banquets was translated into German and published under the title Als Hitler mir die Hand küsste (When Hitler Kissed My Hand).

D5. (Retrieved 4 March 2018)) was a New Zealand poet. Background Challis was born in a Welsh family in Birmingham, England, and raised there and in Sydney. After living for a time in Spain, he arrived in New Zealand in 1953 and worked as a postman in Wellington and studied psychology and social work at Victoria University. After working as a psychiatric social worker in Porirua Hospital 1961–62, he joined the new Hastings psychiatric unit as a psychologist. He returned to psychiatric social work in 1973, at Canberra, and retired from it in 1988, at Porirua, and moved to Nelson.Andrew Mason, \\"Challis, Gordon\\", in Roger Robinson and Nelson Wattie (eds), The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature, Oxford, Auckland 1998, pp. 99 and 100. During his final years, Challis lived in Golden Bay.Neil, Wilson, \\"Poet Gordon Challis rediscovers 'the young me'”, The G.B. Weekly, 8 April 2009 (retrieved 20 January 2012) Poetry Challis began writing poetry at Victoria University. His work was widely published in literary periodicals, especially Landfall, and in 1960 Charles Brasch nominated him as one of the four leading contenders for poetic fame in New Zealand in the coming decade. A poetic sequence, \\"The Oracle\\", was published in Landfall 60 (1961), the first poem of which subsequently appeared in Challis's collection, Building (Caxton, 1963). The intense pressures of mental health work led Challis to abandon writing poetry and, apart from translations from Spanish for Landfall, he published no poetry. After his retirement from mental health care, Challis found \\"to his surprise\\" that writing slowly began returning to him. He had new work published in The New Zealand Listener and Landfall. In 2003 Challis published his second collection, The Other side of the brain and in 2009, his third collection Luck of the Bounce appeared. Challis's work has been linked with Louis Johnson (the most influential), Peter Bland and Charles Doyle, all three immigrant English poets writing in Wellington from the mid-1950s. These poets dealt with personal experience in a contemporary urban, often domestic, setting, and using modernist techniques. Andrew Mason see Challis's most enduring work as more distinctive than the work of those poets. In Building, certain poems (\\"The Iceman\\", \\"The Shadowless Man\\", \\"The Thermostatic Man\\", \\"The Asbestos- Suited Man in Hell\\" and its sequel \\"The Inflammable Man\\") explore psychological states and the development of personal identity. Others in that first collection (\\"The Black One\\", \\"The Sirens\\" and \\"The Oracle\\") are an often ironic reworking of myths or archetypes into contemporary situations. The poems are all \\"linguistically inventive\\" but \\"carefully crafted\\". Challis's poetry published in the twentieth century is characterised by an \\"apparent distance\\", almost a \\"clinical detachment\\", which \\"subverts the immediate or expected emotional response\\". \\"Beneath that, however, there is a deeper identification with psychological conditions that are unique to the individual yet common to humankind\\". In his third collection, Luck of the bounce (2009), the poems became \\"sometimes light and quirky, often witty, occasionally self- deprecating but always compassionate\\". There was a satirical edge to some of the humour, but (in Challis's words) \\"never his intention to hurt people\\". He described Luck of the bounce as \\"part of a progression in his work\\" with the poems being lighter and more humorous. His earlier works were \\"news stories from the unconscious mind\\" but in his third collection they were \\"news stories from a more conscious kind of awareness\\" with direct references to local and every day life . For example, the poem \\"Getting the music (on 91.4FM)\\" begins: Living under the hill you have to take /the luck of the bounce – /the diffractive spray from waves clipping /just the right rocks. /This is Upper Takaka /this is Golden Bay /twice as far from Nelson /as Nelson is from it. But he retained his interest in more fundamental matters as he engaged in poetry because of its \\"intensity of its reflection and its ability to make connections with an audience in its endeavours to fathom the human condition\\".

Description The peninsula occupies the north- western corner of Grande Terre and is named after Jean Loranchet, the first officer of Raymond Rallier du Baty’s second Kerguelen survey expedition in 1913. It has a rugged, mountainous interior, with altitudes exceeding 500 m and a coastline of steep cliffs deeply incised by fjords. It is some 50 km long with a width of up to 20 km. As with most of Grande Terre it is infested with introduced feral cats, rats and rabbits. Human visitation is infrequent. Important Bird Area The northern end of the peninsula, and the northernmost part of Grande Terre, extending northwards from the head of the Baie de la Dauphine, has been identified as a 60 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its breeding seabirds. At least 23 bird species breed in the IBA.

It is the type species of the genus Bohadschia; Jaeger, 1833. Description Emperor shrimp on Bohadschia argus Bohadschia argus is sausage-shaped with a smooth, tough, leathery skin and can grow to in length. It is a greyish-brown colour, paler below, with distinctive dark eye-spots surrounded by white haloes. There are several rows of tube feet on the underside. Surrounding the mouth at the anterior end is a ring of paddle-shaped, black tentacles fringed with white. The anus, at the posterior end, has Cuvierian tubules situated at its base which are readily ejected as sticky threads if the animal is disturbed or handled. These contain toxins which deter predators and are irritating to human skin. Bohadschia argus North Australian Sea Cucumbers. Retrieved 2012-01-18.Bohadschia argus DiveGallery. Retrieved 2012-01-18.

Biology Bohadschia argus is an omnivore. As it moves across the seabed, it sweeps sand grains and detritus into its mouth using its sticky tentacles. It obtains some nourishment from the biofilm that coats the grains. Ecology Fish of the species Carapus mourlani are sometimes found living in the coelomic cavity of Bohadschia argus; the fish enter through the anus, either going in head first or more frequently tail first. In a study in the Banda Islands in the South Moluccan Sea, 15 individual fish were found to be inhabiting the body of one sea cucumber in length. The small emperor shrimp (Periclimenes imperator) is often associated with Bohadschia argus and may help keep it clear of ectoparasites. Uses A new triterpene glycoside, Arguside A, has been extracted from the tissues of Bohadschia argus. This compound appears to exhibit cytotoxicity against several different types of human tumour cells.

Function in Donnerstag The opera Donnerstag aus Licht concerns the development of the earthly life of young Michael. He personifies a divine spirit capable of achieving immortality and absolute knowledge, who discovers beyond death a supraconsciousness that protects him from the anti-knowledge of Lucifer. The Invisible Choirs represent the divine immanence, disembodied and beyond logic, activated like a mantra that forces Michael into transcendence. It is played back on tape over eight groups of loudspeakers, set in a circle around the audience. It sounds softly in the background throughout the first scene, \\"Childhood\\", of act 1 (Michael's Youth), and rather louder during \\"Festival\\", the opening scene of act 3 (Michael's Homecoming). Text The work sets three texts in Hebrew (\\"Judgement Day\\" from The Ascent of Moses, \\"The End of Time\\" from the Apocalypse of Baruch, and a Hymn of Praise, \\"The Heavens Rejoice\\", from the Book of Leviticus), and a different passage from \\"The End of Time\\", sung in German. deliberately selecting the \\"positive, creative, and invigorating\\" passages and avoiding the \\"gruesome\\" segments that \\"describe drastic things, that speak of blood and destruction\\". Materials and technique A click track was recorded on the sixteenth track of a sixteen-track tape recorder. This was used to synchronise the choir, who were recorded separately by sections, with each voice group (sopranos, altos, tenors, and basses) superimposed on itself as many as four times. From this fifteen-track version, Stockhausen then mixed down an eight-track version, in the process changing the positions of the choir groups in space. The result could never be performed by a choir live, with as many as 180 separate vocal parts synchronised at some points.
